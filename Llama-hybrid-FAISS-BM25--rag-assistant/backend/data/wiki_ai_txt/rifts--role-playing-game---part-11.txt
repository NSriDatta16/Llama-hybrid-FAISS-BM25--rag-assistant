le Entertainment Group announced a series of supplements converting Rifts to the Savage Worlds system. April 2016 Pinnacle announced a 2-month Kickstarter. By November 2016 they had dubbed this project Savage Rifts. Titles released in the series include: The Tomorrow Legion's Player's Guide (PG) Game Master's Handbook (GM) Savage Foes of North America (SFoNA) Character Folio Archetypes Set 1 Archetypes Set 2 Coalition Field Manual Contamination Principle Adventures: The Garnet Town Gambit (TGTG) Tome of Destiny Reception John Kovalic called Rifts "the runaway success of 1990". Rod Lockwood of the Springfield News-Sun in 1996 declared Rifts "one of the most popular games on the market" noting that regularly outsold other products in local shops in Springfield, Ohio. In Issue 48 of Challenge, Lester W. Smith found the information about rifts and the new Earth gave both players and referees a good base of knowledge. He especially liked the section on magic, saying, "The magic system, when taken as a whole, is clear, concise and logical, explaining magic in general in a new and 'realistic' light." However, he didn't like the lack of an introductory adventure, commenting, "For a game that is meant to stand alone, itâ€™s surprising that no introductory scenario was included. Nor were any character sheets, handouts or pull-outs provided to aid the players." Smith had thought that the completely new rules system would clear up some of the long-standing problems with old Palladium rule systems. However, Smith found that "Instead of clearing up old discrepancies, Rifts creates many of its own." He also found the rules badly organized. Despite these issues, Smith concluded, "I highly recommend Rifts because of its setting and potential for great scenarios. [...] There is enough here to keep any GM busy thinking up new scenarios and creating new archvillains for players for quite a while." Josh Timbrook reviewed Rifts in White Wolf #26 (April/May, 1991), rating it a 4 out of 5 and stated that "Overall, Rifts is an incredible roleplaying experience, and its setting seems to be as original and fun to play as the recent multi-genre games, Shadowrun and Torg. Those who are into bleak worlds, hi-tech magic, twisted rituals, fascist empires, brutal weaponry, mind-boggling power armor, and fantastic stories should really give it a try." In Issue 13 of Arcane (December 1996), Lucya Sachnowski was disappointed in the Rifts World Book 11: Coalition War Campaign, saying that "There are just five pages of short adventure ideas which are usable and versatile - providing a good mixture of combat and moral dilemmas - but they aren't enough." She gave the book a below-average rating of 6 out of 10. In a readers' poll conducted by the UK magazine Arcane in 1996 to determine the 50 most popular role-playing games of all time, Rifts was ranked 22nd. The magazine editor Paul Pettengale commented: "It's the ultimate in old-style high-energy RPGs. It uses a class-and-level system, and its supplements are full of new character classes, as well as weapons, robots and power armour. Fantasy-style creatures are a bit less common, and tend to be rather conventional elves and orcs - although it's perfectly possible to play a baby dragon. One of the key concepts is 'mega-damage', which is important when you're playing with giant robots and such. This is the game for people who want to have everything possible in their campaigns - and then to blow a lot of it up with cool super-weapons." Scott Taylor for Black Gate in 2013 rated Rifts as #9 in the top ten role-playing games of all time, saying "Think about how many gaming groups have fallen apart, how many campaigns have turned to dust, all because people got tired of the same old story. Rifts changes all that, because one week your characters could be fighting aliens in giant mecha and the next they could be raiding a dragon's hoard with Vikings. Not bad, Mr. Siembieda, not bad at all..." In his 2023 book Monsters, Alie
