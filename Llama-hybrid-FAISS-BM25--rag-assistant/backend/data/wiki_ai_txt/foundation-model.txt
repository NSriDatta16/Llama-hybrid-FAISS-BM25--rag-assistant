In artificial intelligence (AI), a foundation model (FM), also known as large X model (LxM), is a machine learning or deep learning model trained on vast datasets so that it can be applied across a wide range of use cases. Generative AI applications like large language models (LLM) are common examples of foundation models. Building foundation models is often highly resource-intensive, with the most advanced models costing hundreds of millions of dollars to cover the expenses of acquiring, curating, and processing massive datasets, as well as the compute power required for training. These costs stem from the need for sophisticated infrastructure, extended training times, and advanced hardware, such as GPUs. In contrast, adapting an existing foundation model for a specific task or using it directly is far less costly, as it leverages pre-trained capabilities and typically requires only fine-tuning on smaller, task-specific datasets. Early examples of foundation models are language models (LMs) like OpenAI's GPT series and Google's BERT. Beyond text, foundation models have been developed across a range of modalitiesâ€”including DALL-E, Stable diffusion, and Flamingo for images, MusicGen and LLark for music, and RT-2 for robotic control. Foundation models are also being developed for fields like astronomy, radiology, genomics, coding, times-series forecasting, mathematics, and chemistry. Definitions The Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence's (HAI) Center for Research on Foundation Models (CRFM) coined the term "foundation model" in August 2021 to mean "any model that is trained on broad data (generally using self-supervision at scale) that can be adapted (e.g., fine-tuned) to a wide range of downstream tasks". This was based on their observation that preexisting terms, while overlapping, were not adequate, stating that "'(large) language model' was too narrow given [the] focus is not only language; 'self-supervised model' was too specific to the training objective; and 'pretrained model' suggested that the noteworthy action all happened after 'pretraining." The term "foundation model" was chosen over "foundational model" because "foundational" implies that these models provide fundamental principles in a way that "foundation" does not. The term Vision-Language Model (VLM) is also used as a near-synonym. As governments regulate foundation models, new legal definitions have emerged. In the United States, the Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence defines a foundation model as "an AI model that is trained on broad data; generally uses self-supervision; contains at least tens of billions of parameters; is applicable across a wide range of contexts". In the United States, the proposed AI Foundation Model Transparency Act of 2023 by House Representatives Don Beyer (D, VA) and Anna Eshoo (D, CA) defines a foundation model as "an artificial intelligence model trained on broad data, generally uses self supervision, generally contains at least 1,000,000,000 parameters, is applicable across a wide range of contexts, and exhibits, or could be easily modified to exhibit, high levels of performance at tasks that could pose a serious risk to security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters." In the European Union, the European Parliament's negotiated position on the E.U. AI Act defines a foundation model as an "AI model that is trained on broad data at scale, is designed for generality of output, and can be adapted to a wide range of distinctive tasks". In the United Kingdom, the Competition and Markets Authority's AI Foundation Models: Initial Report defines foundations model as "a type of AI technology that are trained on vast amounts of data that can be adapted to a wide range of tasks and operations." The United States's definitions are the only ones to make reference to the size of a foundation model
