nd models from existing components (reverse engineering), hand formed samples or sculptures, natural objects or artifacts. Challenges As with all optical methods, reflective or transparent surfaces raise difficulties. Reflections cause light to be reflected either away from the camera or right into its optics. In both cases, the dynamic range of the camera can be exceeded. Transparent or semi-transparent surfaces also cause major difficulties. In these cases, coating the surfaces with a thin opaque lacquer just for measuring purposes is a common practice. A recent method handles highly reflective and specular objects by inserting a 1-dimensional diffuser between the light source (e.g., projector) and the object to be scanned. Alternative optical techniques have been proposed for handling perfectly transparent and specular objects. Double reflections and inter-reflections can cause the stripe pattern to be overlaid with unwanted light, entirely eliminating the chance for proper detection. Reflective cavities and concave objects are therefore difficult to handle. It is also hard to handle translucent materials, such as skin, marble, wax, plants and human tissue because of the phenomenon of sub-surface scattering. Recently, there has been an effort in the computer vision community to handle such optically complex scenes by re-designing the illumination patterns. These methods have shown promising 3D scanning results for traditionally difficult objects, such as highly specular metal concavities and translucent wax candles. Speed Although several patterns have to be taken per picture in most structured light variants, high-speed implementations are available for a number of applications, for example: Inline precision inspection of components during the production process. Health care applications, such as live measuring of human body shapes or the micro structures of human skin. Motion picture applications have been proposed, for example the acquisition of spatial scene data for three-dimensional television. Applications Structured light scanning is a versatile and precise 3D scanning technology widely used across various industries and fields. Its applications include: Small plastic parts: Captures intricate details and ensures high accuracy for quality control and reverse engineering. Additive manufacturing: Enhances prototyping and production workflows by ensuring precise measurements and quality control. Tooling, mould, and die: Reduces production cycle times, such as in glass bottle mould machining, and improves efficiency in multi-blade inspections. Casting: Provides full surface coverage with the highest precision, crucial for defect detection and mould validation. Electronic parts: Ensures high accuracy and adaptability for inspecting complex geometries in small components. Arts and culture: Enables the digitisation and preservation of cultural heritage, including statues, sculptures, paintings, ancient scripts, and archaeological artefacts, ensuring historical records remain accessible for future generations. Palaeontology and anthropology: Facilitates the study and preservation of fossils, bones, and other findings by creating detailed 3D models for analysis. Archaeology: Digitises architectural structures, walls, and inscriptions, aiding in research, restoration, and conservation efforts.
