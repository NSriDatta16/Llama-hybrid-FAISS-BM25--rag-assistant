Laplacian Support Vector Machines (LapSVM) Support vector machines (SVMs) are a family of algorithms often used for classifying data into two or more groups, or classes. Intuitively, an SVM draws a boundary between classes so that the closest labeled examples to the boundary are as far away as possible. This can be directly expressed as a linear program, but it is also equivalent to Tikhonov regularization with the hinge loss function, V ( f ( x ) , y ) = max ( 0 , 1 − y f ( x ) ) {\displaystyle V(f(x),y)=\max(0,1-yf(x))} : f ∗ = arg min f ∈ H 1 ℓ ∑ i = 1 ℓ max ( 0 , 1 − y i f ( x i ) ) + γ ‖ f ‖ K 2 {\displaystyle f^{*}={\underset {f\in {\mathcal {H}}}{\arg \!\min }}{\frac {1}{\ell }}\sum _{i=1}^{\ell }\max(0,1-y_{i}f(x_{i}))+\gamma \left\|f\right\|_{K}^{2}} Adding the intrinsic regularization term to this expression gives the LapSVM problem statement: f ∗ = arg min f ∈ H 1 ℓ ∑ i = 1 ℓ max ( 0 , 1 − y i f ( x i ) ) + γ A ‖ f ‖ K 2 + γ I ( ℓ + u ) 2 f T L f {\displaystyle f^{*}={\underset {f\in {\mathcal {H}}}{\arg \!\min }}{\frac {1}{\ell }}\sum _{i=1}^{\ell }\max(0,1-y_{i}f(x_{i}))+\gamma _{A}\left\|f\right\|_{K}^{2}+{\frac {\gamma _{I}}{(\ell +u)^{2}}}\mathbf {f} ^{\mathrm {T} }L\mathbf {f} } Again, the representer theorem allows the solution to be expressed in terms of the kernel evaluated at the data points: f ∗ ( x ) = ∑ i = 1 ℓ + u α i ∗ K ( x i , x ) {\displaystyle f^{*}(x)=\sum _{i=1}^{\ell +u}\alpha _{i}^{*}K(x_{i},x)} α {\displaystyle \alpha } can be found by writing the problem as a linear program and solving the dual problem. Again letting K {\displaystyle K} be the kernel matrix and J {\displaystyle J} be the block matrix [ I ℓ 0 0 0 u ] {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}I_{\ell }&0\\0&0_{u}\end{bmatrix}}} , the solution can be shown to be α = ( 2 γ A I + 2 γ I ( ℓ + u ) 2 L K ) − 1 J T Y β ∗ {\displaystyle \alpha =\left(2\gamma _{A}I+2{\frac {\gamma _{I}}{(\ell +u)^{2}}}LK\right)^{-1}J^{\mathrm {T} }Y\beta ^{*}} where β ∗ {\displaystyle \beta ^{*}} is the solution to the dual problem β ∗ = max β ∈ R ℓ ∑ i = 1 ℓ β i − 1 2 β T Q β subject to ∑ i = 1 ℓ β i y i = 0 0 ≤ β i ≤ 1 ℓ i = 1 , … , ℓ {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}&&\beta ^{*}=\max _{\beta \in \mathbf {R} ^{\ell }}&\sum _{i=1}^{\ell }\beta _{i}-{\frac {1}{2}}\beta ^{\mathrm {T} }Q\beta \\&{\text{subject to}}&&\sum _{i=1}^{\ell }\beta _{i}y_{i}=0\\&&&0\leq \beta _{i}\leq {\frac {1}{\ell }}\;i=1,\ldots ,\ell \end{aligned}}} and Q {\displaystyle Q} is defined by Q = Y J K ( 2 γ A I + 2 γ I ( ℓ + u ) 2 L K ) − 1 J T Y {\displaystyle Q=YJK\left(2\gamma _{A}I+2{\frac {\gamma _{I}}{(\ell +u)^{2}}}LK\right)^{-1}J^{\mathrm {T} }Y} LapSVM has been applied to problems including geographical imaging, medical imaging, face recognition, machine maintenance, and brain–computer interfaces. Limitations Manifold regularization assumes that data with different labels are not likely to be close together. This assumption is what allows the technique to draw information from unlabeled data, but it only applies to some problem domains. Depending on the structure of the data, it may be necessary to use a different semi-supervised or transductive learning algorithm. In some datasets, the intrinsic norm of a function ‖ f ‖ I {\displaystyle \left\|f\right\|_{I}} can be very close to the ambient norm ‖ f ‖ K {\displaystyle \left\|f\right\|_{K}} : for example, if the data consist of two classes that lie on perpendicular lines, the intrinsic norm will be equal
