r violations of the known laws of physics, and no "naval analogy" space battles. Certain speculative technologies, such as the creation of "negative mass" (averaged null energy condition-violating) exotic matter and the manipulation of strange forms of matter, such as magnetic monopoles and Q-balls, on length scales much smaller than that of an atom, strong artificial intelligence and artificial life appear in the setting, distinguishing it from "ultra-hard" science fiction (which assumes only technologies proven to be possible at the time it is written). Nanotechnology is common. Ringworlds, Dyson spheres and other "megastructures" exist. Much of civilized space is connected by a network of wormholes. Brain-computer interfaces, or "DNIs" (Direct Neural Interfaces), are required to operate most forms of common technology, and an option to use machine translation to unwittingly use a foreign language is considered a basic capability and component. Virtual reality technology is ubiquitous and advanced, with some societies choosing to live entirely within simulated universes. These and other simulated reality technologies lead to such risks as "actualys," a condition where one loses the ability to distinguish between simulation and reality. When software is integral to the functioning of something in the Orion's Arm Universe, it is usually sentient, if not necessarily sophont. Mind uploading is also commonplace, as is partial and total copying of a person's mind-state for various purposes. Prominent theoretical technologies Technologies that feature prominently in the Orion's Arm setting include: Advanced nanotechnology able to manipulate matter. Extremely advanced artificial intelligences possessing vast superintelligence. Space megastructures. Production and manipulation of averaged null energy condition-violating negative stress energy tensor fields, including quintessence and scalar quantum field fluctuations, for use in reactionless space drives and wormholes. Stable wormholes, allowing apparent faster-than-light travel between star systems, though they must be transported to the systems at sublight speeds (with physical limitations intended to prevent time travel). Several types of reactionless sublight space drive, including Displacement, Halo, and Void drives, which are themselves based upon the ESAA/Van den Broeck metric solution to the Alcubierre/Natario warp drive. Prominent theoretical artifacts Examples of nearly all types of megastructures feature prominently in the Orion's Arm setting, but the most mentioned include: Dyson spheres (shells around stars), both swarm-based and dynamically supported. Ringworlds (rigid hoops around stars at a distance of about 1 AU). Bishop Rings (large ring-shaped habitats), described as the largest spinning ring-shaped habitats that can be built using non-exotic materials. Similar to Iain M. Banks' Orbitals or Halo. Complex orbital ring variants (suprastellar and supraplanetary shells) that perform functions similar to Dyson spheres. Shellworlds Topopoli Space elevators Types of nanotechnology-based artifacts include: Utility fog (swarms of microscale robots that act as a reconfigurable bulk material). Disassembler swarms (grey goo-like swarms of nanorobots that dismantle hostile craft/objects). Angelnets / Demonnets / Guardwebs (nanotechnology-based infrastructures allowing for complete control of the local environment, up to and including mind uploading in the case of severe accidents, that provides backup copies in addition to its holodeck-like uses). Other noteworthy artifacts are usually unique items whose principles of operation are unknowable to "baseline" humans (named Clarketech, after Clarke's third law). Toposophic levels A core component of the overall project is the specific distinction between "toposophic levels" on the "sophonce scale", which categorizes beings based on their ability to process information and how they comprehend their sense of Self, with beings who ope
