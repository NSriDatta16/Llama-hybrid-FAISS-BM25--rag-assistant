st, 7 June 2007: "[Investors] were put off by the term 'voice recognition' which, like 'artificial intelligence', is associated with systems that have all too often failed to live up to their promises." Patty Tascarella in Pittsburgh Business Times, 2006: "Some believe the word 'robotics' actually carries a stigma that hurts a company's chances at funding." John Markoff in the New York Times, 2005: "At its low point, some computer scientists and software engineers avoided the term artificial intelligence for fear of being viewed as wild-eyed dreamers." Many researchers in AI in the mid 2000s deliberately called their work by other names, such as informatics, machine learning, analytics, knowledge-based systems, business rules management, cognitive systems, intelligent systems, intelligent agents or computational intelligence, to indicate that their work emphasizes particular tools or is directed at a particular sub-problem. Although this may have been partly because they considered their field to be fundamentally different from AI, it is also true that the new names helped to procure funding by avoiding the stigma of false promises attached to the name "artificial intelligence". In the late 1990s and early 21st century, AI technology became widely used as elements of larger systems, but the field was rarely credited for these successes. In 2006, Nick Bostrom explained that "a lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore." Rodney Brooks stated around the same time that "there's this stupid myth out there that AI has failed, but AI is around you every second of the day." Current AI spring (2020â€“present) AI has reached the highest levels of interest and funding in its history in the 2020s by every possible measure, including: publications, patent applications, total investment ($50 billion in 2022, a predicted $364 billion in 2025 by large tech companies, as of August 2025) and job openings (800,000 U.S. job openings in 2022). The successes of the current "AI spring" or "AI boom" are advances in language translation (in particular, Google Translate), image recognition (spurred by the ImageNet training database) as commercialized by Google Image Search, and in game-playing systems such as AlphaZero (chess champion) and AlphaGo (go champion), and Watson (Jeopardy champion). A turning point was in 2012 when AlexNet (a deep learning network) won the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge with half as many errors as the second place winner. The 2022 release of OpenAI's AI chatbot ChatGPT which as of January 2023 has over 100 million users, has reinvigorated the discussion about artificial intelligence and its effects on the world.
