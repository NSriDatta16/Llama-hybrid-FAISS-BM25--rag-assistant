pe of the individual, the self-replicating error mutation, UM, alters both the genotype of the individual, and its associated lifetime. The presence of mutations in the quantum artificial life experiment is critical for providing randomness and biodiversity. The inclusion of mutations helps to increase the accuracy of the quantum algorithm. Death At the instant the individual is created (when the genotype is copied into the phenotype), the phenotype interacts with the environment. As time evolves, the interaction of the individual with the environment simulates aging which eventually leads to the death of the individual. The death of an individual occurs when the expectation value of σ z {\displaystyle \sigma _{z}} is within some ϵ {\displaystyle \epsilon } of 1 in the phenotype, or, equivalently, when ρ p = | 0 ⟩ ⟨ 0 | {\displaystyle \rho _{p}=|0\rangle \langle 0|} The Lindbladian describes the interaction of the individual with the environment: ρ ˙ = γ ( σ ρ σ † − 1 2 σ † σ ρ − 1 2 ρ σ † σ ) {\displaystyle {\dot {\rho }}=\gamma (\sigma \rho \sigma ^{\dagger }-{\frac {1}{2}}\sigma ^{\dagger }\sigma \rho -{\frac {1}{2}}\rho \sigma ^{\dagger }\sigma )} with σ = I ⊗ | 0 ⟩ ⟨ 1 | {\displaystyle \sigma =I\otimes |0\rangle \langle 1|} and without ρ = ρ g ⊗ ρ p {\displaystyle \rho =\rho _{g}\otimes \rho _{p}} . This interaction causes the phenotype to exponentially decay over time. However, the genetic material contained in the genotype does not dissipate which allows for genes to be passed on to subsequent generations. Given the initial state of the genotype: ρ g = ( a b − i c b + i c 1 − a ) {\displaystyle \rho _{g}={\begin{pmatrix}a&b-ic\\b+ic&1-a\\\end{pmatrix}}} The expectation values of the genotype and phenotype can be described as: ⟨ σ z ⟩ g = 2 a − 1 {\displaystyle \langle \sigma _{z}\rangle _{g}=2a-1} , ⟨ σ z ⟩ p = 1 − 2 e γ t ( 1 − a ) {\displaystyle \langle \sigma _{z}\rangle _{p}=1-2e^{\gamma t}(1-a)} . Where 'a' represents a single genetic parameter. From this equation, we can see that as 'a' is increased, the life expectancy decreases. Equivalently, the closer the initial state is to | 1 ⟩ ⟨ 1 | {\displaystyle |1\rangle \langle 1|} , the greater the life expectancy of the individual. When ⟨ σ z ⟩ p = 1 − ϵ {\displaystyle \langle \sigma _{z}\rangle _{p}=1-\epsilon } , the individual is considered dead, the phenotype is used as the ancillary state for a new individual. Thus, the cycle continues and the process becomes self-sustaining. == References ==
