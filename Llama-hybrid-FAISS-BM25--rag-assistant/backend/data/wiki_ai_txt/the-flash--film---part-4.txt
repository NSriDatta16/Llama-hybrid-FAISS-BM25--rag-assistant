an film and the 1966–1968 television series. Archival audio and footage also feature Cesar Romero and Jack Nicholson as their respective versions of the Joker from the 1960s Batman series and the 1989 film, along with Eartha Kitt as Catwoman from the 1960s series. Production Development Early attempts Development on a film based on the DC Comics character the Flash began in the late 1980s when Warner Bros. Pictures hired television writer Jeph Loeb to write a screenplay, before DC Comics president Jenette Kahn hired him to instead write a revivial of the comic book Challengers of the Unknown (1991). After impressing Warner Bros. with his script for the DC Comics–based film Batman Begins (2005), the studio offered David S. Goyer the choice to work on a film featuring either the Flash or Green Lantern, but it was also primarily interested in one for Wonder Woman. Goyer chose the Flash due to the cinematic possibilities of the character and his abilities, and he was hired to write, direct, and produce a new version of The Flash in December 2004, as part of an overall production deal with the studio. Warner Bros. executive vice president (EVP) of production Lynn Harris was set to oversee the film's development after working with Goyer on the Marvel Comics–based film Blade: Trinity (2004) at Warner Bros.' New Line Cinema. Goyer approached his Blade: Trinity co-star Ryan Reynolds to portray the Wally West version of the Flash and intended to have the character Barry Allen appear in a supporting role. For the film's tone, Goyer was influenced by director Sam Raimi's Spider-Man film trilogy (2002–2007) and The Flash comic book runs (1987–2008) by Mike Baron, Mark Waid, and Geoff Johns, and was inspired by the Greek myth of Icarus for handling Wally West's use of super speed and the character being a "screw up". Reynolds met with Goyer to discuss the role in March 2005, when Goyer was writing the script, which was described as having dark themes. Reynolds said he would portray the Flash if Warner Bros. provided the film with a greenlight, while Goyer contrasted the Flash with Batman, noting that he is not a vigilante, does not have a secret identity, and enjoys being a superhero. By June 2006, Goyer planned to direct The Flash as his follow-up to The Invisible (2007). He had completed the first draft by early October, but quietly left the project in the following months over creative differences with the studio. Goyer announced his exit in early February 2007, and Shawn Levy was subsequently hired to direct and oversee the writing of a new draft written by Chris Brancato, which used elements from Goyer's script. Charles Roven and Alex Gartner joined as producers, with Levy also expected to produce in some capacity. Unlike his prior works, Levy did not intend for the film to be a comedy, but wanted it to have a lighter tone than some prior DC films. Later that month, Warner Bros. announced the development of a Justice League film, with Michelle and Kieran Mulroney writing the screenplay. In August, Reynolds reaffirmed The Flash's development was continuing alongside the Justice League film, and Brancato had completed a draft by early September. George Miller signed on to direct the Justice League film, titled Justice League: Mortal, later that month. It was envisioned as the start of a franchise with planned sequels and spin-offs, including the Flash film. Levy left The Flash in October 2007 because of scheduling conflicts with Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian (2009). David Dobkin took over as director and began developing the film as a spin-off from Justice League: Mortal, with a focus on Wally West, but it was soon reported to not be connected to that film. Craig Wright was writing a script for the film early the next month, days before the start of the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike, which delayed further development on the film. In December 2007, Adam Brody was cast as the Wally West version of the Flash for J
