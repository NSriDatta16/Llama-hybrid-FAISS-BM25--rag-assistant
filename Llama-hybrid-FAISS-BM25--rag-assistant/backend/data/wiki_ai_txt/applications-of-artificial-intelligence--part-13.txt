ontinue flight until a safe landing can be achieved. The software compensated for damaged components by relying on the remaining undamaged components. The 2016 Intelligent Autopilot System combined apprenticeship learning and behavioral cloning whereby the autopilot observed low-level actions required to maneuver the airplane and high-level strategy used to apply those actions. Maritime Neural networks are used by situational awareness systems in ships and boats. There also are autonomous boats.
