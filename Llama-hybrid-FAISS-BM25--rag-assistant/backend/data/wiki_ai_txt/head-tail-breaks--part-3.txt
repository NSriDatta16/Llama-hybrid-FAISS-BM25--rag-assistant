ks method can be used iteratively to obtain head parts of a data set, this method actually captures the underlying hierarchy of the data set. For example, if we divide the array (19, 8, 7, 6, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0) with the head/tail breaks method, we can get two head parts, i.e., the first head part (19, 8, 7, 6) and the second head part (19). These two head parts as well as the original array form a three-level hierarchy: the 1st level (19), the 2nd level (19, 8, 7, 6), and the 3rd level (19, 8, 7, 6, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0). The number of levels of the above-mentioned hierarchy is actually a characterization of the imbalance of the example array, and this number of levels has been termed as the ht-index. With the ht-index, we are able to compare degrees of imbalance of two data sets. For example, the ht-index of the example array (19, 8, 7, 6, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0) is 3, and the ht-index of another array (19, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8) is 2. Therefore, the degree of imbalance of the former array is higher than that of the latter array. Delineating natural cities The use of fractals in modelling human geography has for a longer period been seen as useful in measuring the spatial distribution of human settlements. Head/tail breaks can be used to do just that with a concept called natural cities. The term 'natural cities' refers to the human settlements or human activities in general on Earth's surface that are naturally or objectively defined and delineated from massive geographic information based on head/tail division rule, a non-recursive form of head/tail breaks. Such geographic information could be from various sources, such as massive street junctions and street ends, a massive number of street blocks, nighttime imagery and social media users' locations etc. Based on these the different urban forms and configurations detected in cities can be derived. Distinctive from conventional cities, the adjective 'natural' could be explained not only by the sources of natural cities, but also by the approach to derive them [1]. Natural cities are derived from a meaningful cutoff averaged from a massive number of units extracted from geographic information. Those units vary according to different kinds of geographic information, for example the units could be area units for the street blocks and pixel values for the nighttime images. A natural cities model has been created using ArcGIS model builder, it follows the same process of deriving natural cities from location-based social media, namely, building up huge triangular irregular network (TIN) based on the point features (street nodes in this case) and regarding the triangles which are smaller than a mean value as the natural cities. These natural cities can also be created from other open access information like OpenStreetMap and further be used as an alternative delineation of administrative boundaries. Scaling law can also at the same time correctly be identified and the administrative borders can be created to respect this by the delineation of the natural cities. This type methodology can help urban geographers and planners by correctly identifying the effective urban territorial scope of the areas they work in. Natural cities can vary depending on the scale on which the natural cities are delineated, which is why optimally they have to be based on data from the whole world. Due to that being computationally impossible, a country or county scale is suggested as alternative. Due to the scale-free nature of natural cities and the data they are based on there are also possibilities to use the natural cities method for further measurements. One of the main advantages of natural cities is that it is derived bottom-up instead of top-down. That means that the borders are determined by the data of something physical rather than determined by an administrative government or administration. For example by calculating the natural cities of a natural city recursively the dense areas within a natural city are ide
