History 1986 Synesthesia concept smartglasses: such as for deaf persons - converting audio frequency & volume respectively into color & brightness display (presented on the periphery of visual field - so as not to interfere with ordinary visual perception); and for blind persons - converting color & brightness respectively into audio frequency & volume (within a very limited range - so as not to interfere with environmental cues); thus, a class of wearable noninvasive prosthetics - embodied in glasses. While these were first specified as analog transformation devices, some later ones are amenable for digital application in many smartglasses. see: Experimental model for the study of changes in the organization of human sensory information processing through the design and testing of non-invasive prosthetic devices for sensory impaired people 2012 On 17 April 2012, Oakley's CEO Colin Baden stated that the company was working on a way to project information directly onto lenses since 1997, and has 600 patents related to the technology, many of which apply to optical specifications. On 18 June 2012, Canon announced the MR (Mixed Reality) System which simultaneously merges virtual objects with the real world at full scale and in 3D. Unlike the Google Glass, the MR System is intended for professional use with a price tag for the headset and accompanying system as $125,000, with $25,000 in expected annual maintenance. 2013 At MWC 2013, the Japanese company Brilliant Service introduced the Viking OS, an operating system for HMD's which was written in Objective-C and relies on gesture control as a primary form of input. It includes a facial recognition system and was demonstrated on a revamped version of Vuzix STAR 1200XL glasses ($4,999) which combined a generic RGB camera and a PMD CamBoard nano depth camera. At Maker Faire 2013, the startup company Technical Illusions unveiled CastAR augmented reality glasses which are well equipped for an AR experience: infrared LEDs on the surface detect the motion of an interactive infrared wand, and a set of coils at its base are used to detect RFID chip loaded objects placed on top of it; it uses dual projectors at a frame rate of 120 Hz and a retro-reflective screen providing a 3D image that can be seen from all directions by the user; a camera sitting on top of the prototype glasses is incorporated for position detection, thus the virtual image changes accordingly as a user walks around the CastAR surface. At D11 Conference 2013, the startup company Atheer Labs unveiled its 3D augmented reality glasses prototype. The prototype includes binocular lens, 3D images support, a rechargeable battery, WiFi, Bluetooth 4.0, accelerometer, gyro and an IR. User can interact with the device by voice commands and the mounted camera allows the users to interact naturally with the device with gestures. 2014 The Orlando Magic, Indiana Pacers, and other NBA teams used Google Glass on the CrowdOptic platform to enhance the in-game experience for fans.
