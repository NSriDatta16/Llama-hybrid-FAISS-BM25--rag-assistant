ulations concerning deepfakes, which became effective in January 2023. In July 2023, Huawei released its version 3.0 of its Pangu LLM. In July 2023, China released its Interim Measures for the Administration of Generative Artificial Intelligence Services. A draft proposal on basic generative AI services safety requirements, including specifications for data collection and model training was issued in October 2023. Also in October 2023, the Chinese government launched its Global AI Governance Initiative, which frames its AI policy as part of a Community of Common Destiny and aims to build AI policy dialogue with developing countries. The Initiative has expressed concern over AI safety risks, including abuse of data or the use of AI by terrorists. In 2024, Spamouflage, an online disinformation and propaganda campaign of the Ministry of Public Security, began using news anchors created with generative artificial intelligence to deliver fake news clips. In March 2024, Premier Li Qiang launched the AI+ Initiative, which intends to integrate AI into China's real economy. In May 2024, the Cyberspace Administration of China announced that it rolled out a large language model trained on Xi Jinping Thought. According to the 2024 report from the International Data Corporation (IDC), Baidu AI Cloud holds China's largest LLM market share with 19.9 percent and US$49 million in revenue over the last year. This was followed by SenseTime, with 16 percent market share, and by Zhipu AI, as the third largest. The fourth and fifth largest were Baichuan and the Hong-Kong listed AI company 4Paradigm respectively. Baichuan, Zhipu AI, Moonshot AI and MiniMax were praised by investors as China's new "AI Tigers". In April 2024, 117 generative AI models had been approved by the Chinese government. As of 2024, many Chinese technology firms such as Zhipu AI and Bytedance have launched AI video-generation tools to rival OpenAI's Sora. Chronology of major AI-related policies Government goals According to a February 2019 publication by the Center for a New American Security, CCP general secretary Xi Jinping â€“ believes that being at the forefront of AI technology will be critical to the future of global military and economic power competition. By 2025, the State Council aims for China to make fundamental contributions to basic AI theory and to solidify its place as a global leader in AI research. Further, the State Council aims for AI to become "the main driving force for China's industrial upgrading and economic transformation" by this time. By 2030, the State Council aims to have China be the global leader in the development of artificial intelligence theory and technology. The State Council claims that China will have developed a "mature new-generation AI theory and technology system." According to academics Karen M. Sutter and Zachary Arnold, the Chinese government "seeks to meld state planning and control while some operational flexibility for firms. In this context, China's AI firms are hybrid players. The state guides their activity, funds, and shields them from foreign competition through domestic market protections, creating asymmetric advantages as they expand offshore." The CCP's fourteenth five-year plan reaffirmed AI as a top research priority and ranks AI first among "frontier industries" that the Chinese government aims to focus on through 2035. The AI industry is a strategic sector often supported by China's government guidance funds. Due to security concerns around strategically sensitive economic sectors, the government dissuades executives at Chinese AI companies to travel to the U.S. and, if required to travel, to brief authorities before and after travel. Research and development Chinese public AI funding mainly focused on advanced and applied research. The government funding also supported multiple AI R&D in the private sector through venture capitals that are backed by the state. Much analytic agency research showed that, while China is
