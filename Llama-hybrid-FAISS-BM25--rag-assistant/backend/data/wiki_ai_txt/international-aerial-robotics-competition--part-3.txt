 one, and redirect them toward the designated boundary.Zhejiang University was the overall winner of Mission 7, of 52 teams from 12 nations entered as competitors. Eighth mission In 2018, the 8th mission was announced. Mission 8 focused on non-electronic human-machine interaction for the first time, with four aerial robots assisting humans to complete tasks that one person could not independently accomplish. The gist of mission 8 involved a swarm of autonomous aerial robots working with a human to achieve a task in the presence of hostile "Sentry aerial robots" which were trying to impede the human. In 2018, the inaugural year of mission 8, the American Venue was held on the campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia, and the Asia/Pacific Venue was conducted at Beihang University in Beijing China. The following year, Mission 8 was successfully completed in Kunming China at the Yunnan Innovation Institute of Beihang University in under 8 minutes by three teams. Of those, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA) was able to complete the mission in the fastest completion time. Completing the mission within 10 seconds of NUAA was Sun Yat Sen University. Harbin Institute also completed the mission, with 12 seconds remaining on the clock. NUAA won the grand prize of $10,000. Ninth mission In 2023, the 9th mission was concluded. Mission 9 focused on fully autonomous flight using only onboard computing while avoiding obstacles and other aerial robots over a 3 km route, to replace a 2 kg (4.4 pound), approximately 1m (39 inch) long communications module on the mast of a moving platform (a boat in Sea State 3) and return home in under 9 minutes. Twelve registered teams from four different nations attempted to conduct the mission at their home universities, necessitated by COVID travel restrictions. The team putting forth the best performance was from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). This team demonstrated all of the required behaviors called out in the mission 9 official rules on several authenticated runs, but on its final scoring run, suffered a failure of equipment that had been demonstrated successfully on prior runs. In the end, however, the aggregate performance was judged to qualify the team as the overall winner. Tenth mission Mission 10 of the International Aerial Robotics Competition was announced at the beginning of 2025. The mission focuses on the direction of a swarm of small autonomous aerial vehicles (1 pound weight category) by a human, using only gestures or voice commands (no control station). The swarm will be released by a human attempting to cross a 100 meter mine field in under 10 minutes. The swarm of small autonomous aerial vehicles capable of obstacle avoidance and simultaneous flight coordination will detect and map the location of simulated anti-personnel mines in real time while calculating and communicating a safe path for the human through the minefield. The focus of Mission 10 is autonomous aerial coordination, mapping, communication, and speed rather than detection technologies (e.g., ground-penetrating radar, magnetic, hyperspectral imaging, or acoustic/seismic techniques). The simulated mines will be detectable by pre-defined active and passive infrared signatures. The venue for the 10th IARC mission is the UAS & Counter-UAS Center of Excellence Test Range near Huntsville, Alabama, U.S.A. Participants Collegiate teams participating in the IARC have come primarily from the United States and the People's Republic of China, but also from Germany, England, Switzerland, Norway, Spain, Canada, Chile, Qatar, Iran, and India. Teams range in size from several students, up to twenty or more. Both undergraduate and graduate students populate the teams, but some teams have been composed entirely of undergraduates or postgraduates. Industry is not permitted to enter, but it may assist the student teams with funding and equipment. Aerial robots The aer
