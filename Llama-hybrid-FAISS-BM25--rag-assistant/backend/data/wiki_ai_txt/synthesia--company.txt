Synthesia is a British multinational artificial intelligence company based in London, United Kingdom. Is a synthetic media generation company that develops software used to create AI-generated video content. Its customer base, as of January 2025, includes over sixty percent of Fortune 100 companies. Overview Synthesia is most often used by corporations for communication, orientation, and training videos. It has been used in advertising campaigns, reporting, product demonstrations, and to create chatbots. Synthesia's software algorithm mimics speech and facial movements based on video recordings of an individual's speech and phoneme pronunciation. From this a text-to-speech video is created to look and sound like the individual. Users create content via the platform's pre-generated AI presenters or by creating digital representations of themselves, or personal avatars, using the platform's AI video editing tool. These avatars can be used to narrate videos generated from text. As of August 2021, Synthesia's voice database included multiple gender options in over sixty languages. The platform prohibits use of its software to create non-consensual clones, including of celebrities or political figures for satirical purposes. Explicit consent must be provided in addition to a strict pre-screening regimen for use of an individual's likeness to avoid “deepfaking”.
