as "wry and witty", or "accessible" due to its "laconic style and dry humour". Matthew Hutson of the Wall Street Journal said "Mr. Russell's exciting book goes deep while sparkling with dry witticisms". A Library Journal reviewer called it "The right guide at the right time". James McConnachie of The Times wrote "This is not quite the popular book that AI urgently needs. Its technical parts are too difficult, and its philosophical ones too easy. But it is fascinating and significant." By contrast, Human Compatible was criticized in its Nature review by David Leslie, an Ethics Fellow at the Alan Turing Institute; and similarly in a New York Times opinion essay by Melanie Mitchell. One point of contention was whether superintelligence is possible. Leslie states Russell "fails to convince that we will ever see the arrival of a 'second intelligent species'", and Mitchell doubts a machine could ever "surpass the generality and flexibility of human intelligence" without losing "the speed, precision, and programmability of a computer". A second disagreement was whether intelligent machines would naturally tend to adopt so-called "common sense" moral values. In Russell's thought experiment about a geoengineering robot that "asphyxiates humanity to deacidify the oceans", Leslie "struggles to identify any intelligence". Similarly, Mitchell believes an intelligent robot would naturally tend to be "tempered by the common sense, values and social judgment without which general intelligence cannot exist". The book was longlisted for the 2019 Financial Times/McKinsey Award.
