Data philanthropy refers to the practice of private companies donating corporate data. This data is usually donated to nonprofits or donation-run organizations that have difficulty keeping up with expensive data collection technology. The concept was introduced through the United Nations Global Pulse initiative in 2011 to explore corporate data assets for humanitarian, academic, and societal causes. For example, anonymized mobile data could be used to track disease outbreaks, or data on consumer actions may be shared with researchers to study public health and economic trends. Definition A large portion of data collected from the internet consists of user-generated content, such as blogs, social media posts, and information submitted through lead generation and data forms. Additionally, corporations gather and analyze consumer data to gain insight into customer behavior, identify potential markets, and inform investment decisions. United Nations Global Pulse director Robert Kirkpatrick has referred to this type of data as "massive passive data" or "data exhaust." Challenges While data philanthropy can enhance development policies, making users' private data available to various organizations raises concerns regarding privacy, ownership, and the equitable use of data. Different techniques, such as differential privacy and alphanumeric strings of information, can allow access to personal data while ensuring user anonymity. However, even if these algorithms work, re-identification may still be possible. Another challenge is convincing corporations to share their data. The data collected by corporations provides them with market competitiveness and insight regarding consumer behavior. Corporations may fear losing their competitive edge if they share the information they have collected with the public. Numerous moral challenges are also encountered. In 2016, Mariarosaria Taddeo, a digital ethics professor at the University of Oxford, proposed an ethical framework to address them. Sharing strategies The goal of data philanthropy is to create a global data commons where companies, governments, and individuals can contribute anonymous, aggregated datasets. The United Nations Global Pulse offers four different tactics that companies can use to share their data that preserve consumer anonymity: Share aggregated and derived data sets for analysis under nondisclosure agreements (NDA) Allow researchers to analyze data within the private company's own network under NDAs Real-Time Data Commons: data pooled and aggregated among multiple companies of the same industry to protect competitiveness Public/Private Alerting Network: companies mine data behind their own firewalls and share indicators Application in various fields Many corporations take part in data philanthropy, including social networking platforms (e.g., Facebook, Twitter), telecommunications providers (e.g., Verizon, AT&T), and search engines (e.g., Google, Bing). Collecting and sharing anonymized, aggregated user-generated data is made available through data-sharing systems to support research, policy development, and social impact initiatives. By participating in such efforts, these organizations contribute to causes regarded as beneficial to society, allowing institutions to give back meaningfully. With the onset of technological advancements, the sharing of data on a global scale and an in-depth analysis of these data structures could mitigate the effects of global issues such as natural disasters and epidemics. Robert Kirkpatrick, the Director of the United Nations Global Pulse, has argued that this aggregated information is beneficial for the common good and can lead to developments in research and data production in a range of varied fields. Digital disease detection Health researchers use digital disease detection by collecting data from various sourcesâ€”such as social media platforms (e.g., Twitter, Facebook), mobile devices (e.g., cell phones, smartphones), online search
