 songs were old Belgian and French flute minuets, from which the chip learned the rules at play and then applied them. The Blue Brain Project, led by Henry Markram, aims to build biologically detailed digital reconstructions and simulations of the mouse brain. The Blue Brain Project has created in silico models of rodent brains, while attempting to replicate as many details about its biology as possible. The supercomputer-based simulations offer new perspectives on understanding the structure and functions of the brain. The European Union funded a series of projects at the University of Heidelberg, which led to the development of BrainScaleS (brain-inspired multiscale computation in neuromorphic hybrid systems), a hybrid analog neuromorphic supercomputer located at Heidelberg University, Germany. It was developed as part of the Human Brain Project neuromorphic computing platform and is the complement to the SpiNNaker supercomputer (which is based on digital technology). The architecture used in BrainScaleS mimics biological neurons and their connections on a physical level; additionally, since the components are made of silicon, these model neurons operate on average 864 times (24 hours of real time is 100 seconds in the machine simulation) faster than that of their biological counterparts. In 2019, the European Union funded the project "Neuromorphic quantum computing" exploring the use of neuromorphic computing to perform quantum operations. Neuromorphic quantum computing (abbreviated as 'n.quantum computing') is an unconventional computing type of computing that uses neuromorphic computing to perform quantum operations. It was suggested that quantum algorithms, which are algorithms that run on a realistic model of quantum computation, can be computed equally efficiently with neuromorphic quantum computing. Both, traditional quantum computing and neuromorphic quantum computing are physics-based unconventional computing approaches to computations and do not follow the von Neumann architecture. They both construct a system (a circuit) that represents the physical problem at hand, and then leverage their respective physics properties of the system to seek the "minimum". Neuromorphic quantum computing and quantum computing share similar physical properties during computation. Brainchip announced in October 2021 that it was taking orders for its Akida AI Processor Development Kits and in January 2022 that it was taking orders for its Akida AI Processor PCIe boards, making it the world's first commercially available neuromorphic processor. Neuromemristive systems Neuromemristive systems are a subclass of neuromorphic computing systems that focuses on the use of memristors to implement neuroplasticity. While neuromorphic engineering focuses on mimicking biological behavior, neuromemristive systems focus on abstraction. For example, a neuromemristive system may replace the details of a cortical microcircuit's behavior with an abstract neural network model. There exist several neuron inspired threshold logic functions implemented with memristors that have applications in high level pattern recognition applications. Some of the applications reported recently include speech recognition, face recognition and object recognition. They also find applications in replacing conventional digital logic gates. For (quasi)ideal passive memristive circuits, the evolution of the memristive memories can be written in a closed form (Caravelli–Traversa–Di Ventra equation): d d t X → = − α X → + 1 β ( I − χ Ω X ) − 1 Ω S → {\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dt}}{\vec {X}}=-\alpha {\vec {X}}+{\frac {1}{\beta }}(I-\chi \Omega X)^{-1}\Omega {\vec {S}}} as a function of the properties of the physical memristive network and the external sources. The equation is valid for the case of the Williams-Strukov original toy model, as in the case of ideal memristors, α = 0 {\displaystyle \alpha =0} . However, the hypothesis of the existence of an ideal memristor is debatable.
