nd facilitate informed usage. Though still relatively new, Google believes this framework will play a crucial role in helping increase AI transparency. Measurement Modeling: This method combines qualitative and quantitative methods through a social sciences lens, providing a framework that helps developers check if an AI system is accurately measuring what it claims to measure. The framework focuses on two key concepts, examining test-retest reliability ("construct reliability") and whether a model measures what it aims to model ("construct validity"). Through these concepts, this model can help developers break down abstract ideas which can't be directly measured (like socioeconomic status) into specific, measurable components while checking for errors or mismatches that could lead to bias. By making these assumptions clear, this framework helps create AI systems that are more fair and reliable. Datasheets for Datasets: This framework emphasizes documenting the motivation, composition, collection process, and recommended use cases of datasets. By detailing the dataset's lifecycle, datasheets enable users to assess its appropriateness and limitations. Opening up ChatGPT: tracking openness of instruction-tuned LLMs: A community-driven public resource that evaluates openness of text generation models . Model Openness Framework: This emerging approach includes principles for transparent AI development, focusing on the accessibility of both models and datasets to enable auditing and accountability. European Open Source AI Index: This index collects information on model openness, licensing, and EU regulation of generative AI systems and providers. It is a non-profit public resource hosted at Radboud University Nijmegen, the Netherlands. As AI use grows, increasing AI transparency and reducing model biases has become increasingly emphasized as a concern. These frameworks can help empower developers and stakeholders to identify and mitigate bias, fostering fairness and inclusivity in AI systems.
