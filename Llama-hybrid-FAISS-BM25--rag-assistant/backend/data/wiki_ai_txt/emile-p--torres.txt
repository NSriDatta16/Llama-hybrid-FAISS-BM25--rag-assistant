Ã‰mile P. Torres (born 2 July 1982), formerly known as Phil Torres, is an American philosopher, intellectual historian, and activist. Their research focuses on eschatology, existential risk, and human extinction. Along with computer scientist Timnit Gebru, Torres coined the neologism "TESCREAL" to criticize what they see as a group of related philosophies: transhumanism, extropianism, singularitarianism, cosmism, rationalism, effective altruism, and longtermism. Early life and education Torres grew up in Maryland. They were raised in a fundamentalist evangelical Christian family, but later left the religion and became an atheist. They attribute their interest in eschatology to their fundamentalist upbringing, which exposed them to substantial discussion of the Rapture. Torres attended the University of Maryland, College Park and earned a Bachelor of Science with honors in philosophy in 2007. In 2009, they earned a Master of Science in neuroscience from Brandeis University. Simultaneously, from 2008 to 2009, they were a special student at Harvard University in the philosophy department. In 2020, Torres began a philosophy Ph.D. program at the Leibniz University Hannover. Career Much of Torres's work focused on existential risk, the study of potential catastrophic events that could result in human extinction. More recently, they have focused on "existential ethics", which they define as "questions about whether our extinction would be right or wrong to bring about if it happened". In 2016, Torres published a book titled The End: What Science and Religion Tell Us About the Apocalypse, which discusses both religious and secular eschatology, and describes threats from technologies such as nuclear weapons, biological engineering, nanotechnology, and artificial intelligence. In 2017 they published another book, titled Morality, Foresight, and Human Flourishing: An Introduction to Existential Risks. Like their first book, it discusses a range of existential threats, but also delves into what they term "agential risk": the roles of outside agents in existential risk. Morality, Foresight, and Human Flourishing was positively reviewed in Futures as a "current and timely" introduction to existential risk. From 2023 to 2024, Torres was a visiting postdoctoral researcher at Case Western Reserve University's Inamori International Center for Ethics and Excellence. Also in 2023, Routledge published Torres's Human Extinction: A History of the Science and Ethics of Annihilation. The book posits that the rise of Christianity, along with Christianity's focus on salvation, removed the topic of human extinction from public discourse.They argue that concerns around human extinction have re-emerged amid increasing secularism. While Torres does not in practice "wish to see or promote" human extinction, they contend that it would not be inherently bad if it were to occur without violence, such as through declining birthrates. Torres has published in popular media including The Washington Post and Current Affairs, and is a contributing writer to Salon and Truthdig. Transhumanism, longtermism, and effective altruism For the first decade of their career, Torres identified as a transhumanist, longtermist, and effective altruist. Before 2017, Torres contributed writing to the Future of Life Institute, a non-profit organization focused on technology and existential risk. After turning against the organization and opposing techno-optimism with ideas such as a need for a moratorium on the development of artificial intelligence, Torres says they were ousted and their writing removed from the website. Torres later left the longtermist, transhumanist, and effective altruist communities, and became a vocal critic. Torres claims that longtermism and related ideologies stem from eugenics, and could be used to justify "dangerous" consequentialist thinking. Along with Timnit Gebru, Torres coined the term "TESCREAL" to refer to what they see as a group of related philosop
