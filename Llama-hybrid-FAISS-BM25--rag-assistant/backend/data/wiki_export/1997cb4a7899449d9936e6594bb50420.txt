Severna Park High School is a public high school in the United States located in the suburban CDP of Severna Park, Maryland. It is a part of the Anne Arundel County Public Schools system. SPHS opened its doors to students in 1959 and was the seventh public high school opened in Anne Arundel County. (It is the fourth-oldest to remain open after Arundel, Annapolis, and Glen Burnie High Schools as Brooklyn Park and Andover High Schools were replaced by North County High School in 1990 and the all-Black Wiley H. Bates High School became an integrated middle school in 1966). Its principal is Lindsay Abruzzo. A new school was built on the same grounds, and opened in January 2017.

Students

Severna Park High School has one feeder middle school: Severna Park Middle School, which has 6 feeder elementary schools: Benfield Elementary School, Folger Mckinsey Elementary School, Jones Elementary School, Oak Hill Elementary School, Severna Park Elementary School, and Shipley's Choice Elementary School. Although it is named Severna Park High School, some portions of Millersville, Arnold, and Pasadena are also zoned for Severna Park High School and its feeder schools, while the neighborhood of Riverdale in the eastern edge of Severna Park is zoned for Chesapeake High School and its feeder schools. Severna Park High School's boundaries have remained unchanged since 1995 after Anne Arundel County Public Schools conducted a county-wide school redistricting to handle overcrowding at schools across the county. The redistricting resulted in Belvedere Elementary School in Arnold being moved out of Severna Park High School's feeder system and into Broadneck High School's feeder system.
