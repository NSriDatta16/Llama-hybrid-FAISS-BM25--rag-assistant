American Story archive

All of Dotson's American stories can be viewed at www.myamericanstories.com  Over the years, he saved more than six thousand of them, whenever his bosses, looking to save space, tossed them out. He preserved not just the stories themselves, but every field cassette. For three decades, they were maintained at his own expense in air-conditioned rooms—first in his basement then, as the collection grew, in warehouses. NBC donated that archive to the University of Oklahoma and Syracuse University in New York.
