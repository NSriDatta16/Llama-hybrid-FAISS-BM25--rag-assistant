The Valley of the Shadow of Death is Chicago Celtic Punk band The Tossers' fifth studio album. It was released in 2005 on Victory Records and is their first album with the label.

The title is from the Bible, Psalm 23:4 "Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me."

The eighth track, "Drinking In the Day", begins with a reading of the poem "Clearing a Space", by the Irish poet Brendan Kennelly.
