Erickson, in his first year as coach of the Arizona State Sun Devils, led the team to 10 wins, a share of the Pac-10 title with USC, and the Holiday Bowl against the University of Texas Longhorns.

Ice hockey

ASU announced plans to transition their ACHA men's hockey program to an NCAA varsity program on November 18, 2014. The Sun Devils continued play in the ACHA in 2014–15, played a hybrid schedule in 2015–16 with a mix of NCAA and ACHA competition, and played as a Division I independent in 2016–17 with plans to join a conference in 2017–18. The National Collegiate Hockey Conference, Western Collegiate Hockey Association, and Big Ten were all seen as potential landing spots for Arizona State. However, no conference move materialized until 2023, when ASU was announced as the newest NCHC member effective with the 2024–25 season.

The ASU hockey team has a proud history of ACHA hockey. The highlight included winning the 2013–2014 ACHA National Championship, beating Robert Morris 3–1 to win its first national championship in hockey.  The team is led by Coach Greg Powers.

In 2012–2013, he led ASU to a new program best record and first ever 30 plus win season with a record of 35–8–1, its first ever Final Four Appearance, first ever National Ranking of No. 1, and a benchmark win over NCAA DI Penn State. During the 2013–2014 season, ASU Hockey won the ACHA DI National Championship, with Powers named ACHA DI National Coach of the Year. The Sun Devils were also named WCHL Conference Champions both for 2013–2014 and 2014–2015, and Powers was named WCHL Coach of the Year for 2013–2014. Powers was also named an ACHA Division I National Coach of the Year finalist in 2012–2013, and 2014–2015.

Since 2009, Coach Power's ASU hockey teams held a 37-game winning streak over the rival college hockey team located in Tucson, Arizona.

Rivalries
A strong academic and athletic rivalry exists between the University of Arizona and Arizona State University.

Arizona State University fields the more accomplished baseball team with five College World Series national championships (1965, 1967, 1969, 1977 and 1981) to the University of Arizona's four College World Series national championships (1976, 1980, 1986, and 2012). , the schools have met 432 times on the baseball diamond, dating back over 100 years to the first contest in 1907. Arizona, recognizing victories against club teams (ASU did not adopt varsity baseball until 1959) claims the all-time series 241–208–1. ASU, recognizing only varsity baseball competition (beginning in 1959), claims a 189–123 edge in the all-time series ().

The annual football rivalry game between the two schools is known as "The Duel in the Desert." It is one of the most heated rivalries in college football. The University of Arizona has the all-time series lead with a record of 49–45–1 dating back to the time when ASU was the Tempe Normal Owls and Teacher's College Bulldogs. The school adopted the moniker, the Sun Devils, on November 20, 1946. The trophy awarded after each game, the Territorial Cup, is the nation's oldest rivalry trophy. It is currently held by the University of Arizona.

In 2009, State Farm introduced the sponsored "State Farm Territorial Cup" for the two schools. Arizona won the inaugural season of the series 10.5 points to 7.5.

The ASU wrestling team has been dominant over the UA Wildcats with a record of 28–8 all time. The University of Arizona no longer has a wrestling program.
