Located on 16 acres in the Sadi Gülçelik Spor Sitesi in the center of Istanbul's business district, the campus also houses the ENKA Foundation, the ENKA Culture and Arts Foundation, and the ENKA Sport Club with its significant athletic facilities.

General information

Since its beginnings in 1996 with just over 200 students, the first ENKA School in Istanbul has moved to the main campus within the Sadi Gülçelik Sports Complex and rapidly expanded. There are currently 1250 students from Pre-School to grade 12. The school has four divisions: Pre-School (ages 3–5), Primary School (grades 1-4), Middle School (grades 5-8), and High School (grades Prep-12).

While the ENKA Foundation makes a substantial contribution to support the school, the school exists as an independent non-profit corporation directed by an unsalaried Executive Committee, which is in turn reviewed by a voluntary Board of Directors.

The academic program implements both Turkish and English as the languages of instruction. In addition, all students study a third language from grades 5-12: French, German, or Spanish. The curriculum enables graduating students to meet all the requirements for the International Baccalaureate. The ENKA Foundation provides scholarships to more than 20 students a year.

The school offers extracurricular activities such as chess, robotics, dance, performing arts, and outdoor pursuits such as orienteering and camping (part of the Duke of Edinburgh International Award).

Students of the school share the training grounds with ENKA Sports Club for use in their physical education classes. In addition, about 600 students participate in the after schools program five days a week. Exceptional students are coached to national and international competition level. Many students are members of the Turkish National Team for their sport or activity, including chess.

History

In 1994, with the support of Sinan Tara, Vice-Chairman of Enka İnşaat ve Sanayi A.Ş., encouraged by activist and businessman Ibrahim Betil, the school was founded in 1996 in the cultural capital of the country as a private nonprofit center of educational excellence to provide an inspirational model for schools both within Turkey and throughout the international educational community. The first high school graduating class was the class of 2008.

Since opening in September 1996, with just over 200 students, ENKA Schools rapidly expanded its main campus on the Sadi Gülçelik Sports Site in Istinye. There are currently 1250 students from Pre-School to grade 12.
