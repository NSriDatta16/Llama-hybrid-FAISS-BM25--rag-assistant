Lancers is a brand of medium-sweet, lightly sparkling wine produced by the JM da Fonseca winery in Portugal. The brand was created in 1944, when Vintage Wines of New York predicted that wine consumption in the United States would increase after World War II.

A sparkling Lancers, made by the continuous method, was introduced in the late 1980s. It was originally sold in distinctive squat bottles made of rust-colored, opaque crockery rather than clear glass.
