Remains of a Roman villa were discovered in 1972 on the Westminster Field recreation ground, just across the Darent from the village. The discovery was made when new main sewage drains were being dug. The extra costs of diverting these to save the villa were met by public subscription, with fund-raising help from local schoolchildren. The remains include those of a Roman granary at least 100 ft in length and 60 ft wide. The site was back-filled after preservation work was completed.
