Former Protestants or ex-Protestants are people who used to be Protestant for some time, but no longer identify as such. This is a list of people who were, but no longer are, followers of Protestant churches. It is organized by what church they left; when applicable, the religion they joined is mentioned. As implied it is limited to those who left Protestantism for a non-Protestant faith and so does not include those who switched from one Protestant denomination to another.

Calvinists
Wojciech Bobowski, born in the 1600s and raised as a Protestant Calvinist possibly in Bobowa, a city within the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (although some sources cite him as being from Lviv, itself also part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth at the time of his birth), was captured as a young adult by slavers and sold into slavery in the Ottoman Empire. While enslaved, Bobowski converted to Sunni Islam, and engaged in ecumenical activities, such as translating the complete Bible, fourteen psalms from the Genevan Psalter, the Anglican Catechism, and the works of the Protestant Reformers Hugo Grotius and John Amos Comenius into Ottoman Turkish.
Adam Neuser, a Calvinist pastor originally from Gunzenhausen in the Duchy of Bavaria, itself a part of the Holy Roman Empire. He gained notoriety as the presiding priest of the Protestant congregation of the Church of the Holy Spirit in Heidelberg, the Palatinate (also within the Holy Roman Empire). As a consequence of a time of transition within the Calvinist Church in the late 1560s, Neuser joined a faction within the Church known as the Antidisciplinists, led by the Swiss physician and theologian, Thomas Lüber (Erastus). As a part of the Antidisciplinists, Neuser began to doubt standard Calvinist theology, especially the concept of the Trinity. He became an apologetic of Antitrinitarianism, writing a series of letters criticising the doctrine of the Trinity. Neuser even went so far as to write to the Ottoman Sultan Selim II where he maintained that should the Ottomans ever push their empire as far northwest as Germany, he would find support from its inhabitants, persecuted by the hyper-Catholic Habsburgs. The Palatinate Court found him guilty of blasphemy by denying the Divinity of Christ, and he was subsequently imprisoned. However, Neuser not only managed to escape with the help of his friend and fellow theologian Simon Grynaeus, but he was also able to make his way to the Ottoman Empire. After arriving in Constantinople, Neuser recited the Shahada and thus converted to Sunni Islam. Neuser eventually became a government official of the Ottoman Empire at the behest of the Sultan.
Matthias Vehe, a contemporary of Adam Neuser and also an Antidisciplinist. He converted to a kind of Judaism called after also becoming an Antitrinitarian like Neuser.

Peter E. Gillquist, former regional director for Campus Crusade for Christ, converted to Eastern Orthodoxy. The initial impulse was his attempt to re-establish primitive Christianity, a faith formation which would go back to the very beginnings of the church.  Researching the historical foundation of the faith, Gillquist with his colleagues concluded that Eastern Orthodox Church is that very unchanged, historical Christian formation they had sought.  He organized the Evangelical Orthodox Church (EOC) in 1979, and in 1987 Gillquist led seventeen parishes with 2,000 members into Eastern Orthodoxy.
 Alfred Bloom, a professor of Religion and was raised as Evangelical Christian, was promoting Evangelical Christianity when encountered the concept of Amida Buddha and eventually converted to Buddhism. He was also a pioneer of Jōdo Shinshū studies in the English-speaking world.
