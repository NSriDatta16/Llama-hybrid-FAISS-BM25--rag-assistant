History

Rock (1995-2009) 
Originally launched in 1995 by fledgling Belz Broadcasting under the "Solid Rock 92.9 MFS!" slogan, WMFS was acquired by Infinity Broadcasting and rebranded "93X" in 2001. The station was purchased by Entercom Communications in 2006.

The first song played on WMFS when the station debuted was "Rock You Like a Hurricane" by the Scorpions.

WMFS was Memphis' home to Howard Stern prior to his departure from terrestrial radio.

WMFS was one of six radio properties in the Memphis market held by Entercom; the others were WMC-FM, WRVR-FM, WMFS, WLFP, and WMC.  Entercom purchased WMC, WMC-FM and WMFS in 2006.

The previous studio was located in the WMC-TV building on Union Avenue with Rover's Morning Glory mornings, Sydney in middays, Crate doing afternoons and Beck at night.
