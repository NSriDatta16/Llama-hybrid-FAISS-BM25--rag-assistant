Screenwriter

As well her role as Faye Quinn, she also wrote many episodes of Prisoner, the first season of which was produced by her husband Ian Bradley. Due to her marriage to Bradley, in 1979, it was her idea to open the programme with mugshots of the prisoners, instead of a typical opening title sequence. Lucas also wrote seven episodes of  Prisoner between 1979 and 1983, including episode 327, the fire of Wentworth, which was the first episode of the 1983 season. It is now widely regarded as one of the best episodes of the entire series, and was included on the DVD compilation, Best of Prisoner: Cell Block H Volume 1 (Shock DVD).

She also worked as a Writer on other TV series, including The Flying Doctors and All Saints.

Most recently in her television writing career she worked as a script editor for Channel 7's HeadLand.
