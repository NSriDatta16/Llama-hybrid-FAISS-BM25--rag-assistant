This is a list of alcoholic drinks. An alcoholic drink is a drink that contains ethanol, commonly known as alcohol. Alcoholic drinks are divided into three general classes: beers, wines, and distilled beverages. They are legally consumed in most countries, and over one hundred countries have laws regulating their production, sale, and consumption. In particular, such laws specify the minimum age at which a person may legally buy or drink them. This minimum age varies between 15 and 21 years, depending upon the country and the type of drink. Most nations set it at 18 
years of age.

Distilled beverages

Definition
A distilled beverage, spirit drink, or liquor is an alcoholic drink containing ethanol that is produced by distillation (i.e., concentrating by distillation) of ethanol produced by means of fermenting grains, fruits, botanicals, vegetables, seeds, or roots. Vodka, gin, baijiu, shōchū, soju, tequila, rum, whisky, brandy, and singani are examples of distilled drinks. Beer, wine, cider, sake, and huangjiu are examples of fermented drinks.

Hard liquor is used in North America, and India, to distinguish distilled drinks from undistilled ones, and to suggest that undistilled are implicitly weaker.
