Ferazel's Wand is a platform game by Ambrosia Software for Mac OS released in 1999.

Plot
Ferazel is a member of the Habnabit race, tunnel-dwelling creatures skilled in magic. Long have they dwelled in peace, but now they are under assault from a horde of goblins, and there are whispers of a far more foul foe leading the goblins.

The game concentrates more on thinking than fighting enemies â€” boss fights are often a matter of logically deducing a foe's weakness. Later levels emphasize trap-dodging, and all levels contain secret passages and hidden items. It's an RPG of sorts, but not in the traditional sense, in as much as the player fights arcade-style and gains power by finding magical crystals.
