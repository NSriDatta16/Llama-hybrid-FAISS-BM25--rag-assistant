The following is a list of Spanish exonyms, Spanish names for places that do not speak Spanish.

It is important to note that some Spanish exonyms are of traditional use, and are therefore preferred over newer exonyms or current or native placenames (for example Pek√≠n over Beijing). In other cases newer names and exonyms are preferred for political or social reasons, even when a place has an older Spanish exonym (for example Bangladesh over Bengala).
