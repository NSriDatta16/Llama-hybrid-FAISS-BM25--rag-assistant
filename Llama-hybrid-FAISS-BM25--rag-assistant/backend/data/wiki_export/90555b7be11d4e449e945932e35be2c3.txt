It is sited  east of the former Dundee East station, on the Dundee to Aberdeen line, between Golf Street and Arbroath.

History

The station was opened on 6 October 1838 on the 5Â ft 6in gauge (1676mm) Dundee and Arbroath Railway. The station was originally built on the west side of Station Road, to the north of the running line. The goods yard was to the north of the station and mostly accessed via a turntable. The railway changed to standard gauge in 1847.

In 1900 the station was relocated to the other side of the running line and to the other side of Station Road, the goods yard remained where it was and expanded into some of the space the station had used, by this time the access became the usual set of points. The goods yard was able to accommodate most types of goods including live stock and was equipped with a three-ton crane.

A camping coach was positioned here by the Scottish Region from 1956 to 1960, which was replaced in 1961 by a Pullman camping coach. This was joined by another Pullman in 1964 until 1967 when they were withdrawn.
