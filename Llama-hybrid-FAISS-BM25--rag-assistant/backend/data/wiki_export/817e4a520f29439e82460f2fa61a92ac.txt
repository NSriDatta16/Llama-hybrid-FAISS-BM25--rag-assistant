Fielder Allison Jones (August 13, 1871 – March 13, 1934) was an American center fielder and manager in Major League Baseball (MLB). He was best known as the player-manager of the World Series champion 1906 Chicago White Sox, a team who succeeded in spite of such poor offense that they were known as the "Hitless Wonders".

Early life
Born in Shinglehouse, Pennsylvania to a father who owned a general store, Jones learned to play baseball at his preparatory school at Alfred University. As a young man, Jones worked as a surveyor with his brother and ventured to the Pacific Northwest by 1891.

Playing career
Jones entered professional baseball playing as an outfielder and catcher for Portland in the Oregon State League in 1891 or 1893, depending on the source. He played minor league ball in Binghamton, New York, and Springfield, Massachusetts, where he was an accomplished hitter.

Jones's major league playing career began with the Brooklyn Bridegrooms in 1896. In , he joined the Chicago White Sox in the new American League. He was named player-manager in 1904 to replace Jimmy Callahan. Owner Charles Comiskey named Jones manager, desiring a strong-willed leader. The White Sox finished two games short of a pennant in 1905. Bolstered by a nineteen game winning streak, Jones managed the "Hitless Wonders" in the 1906 World Series, which was the White Sox' first World Series win. Playing in that World Series, he hit only .143 (3-for-21) but scored four runs and stole three bases. That year, the White Sox had a team batting average of only .230 while being third in runs. The aging roster sputtered late in 1907 and then lost the pennant on the final day in 1908 to the same team in the Detroit Tigers. Jones quit the team after the season, citing burnout from having to deal with Comiskey. 

He moved to Portland, Oregon, investing in timber. Jones was head coach for the Oregon State Beavers baseball team in 1910, going 13–4–1 and winning the Northwest championship. Six years after his last game with the White Sox, he joined the St. Louis Terriers of the newly formed Federal League, where he served as a player-manager before the league folded. He had one last stint as a manager with the St. Louis Browns, but his earlier success with the White Sox eluded him, as his St. Louis teams never finished above fifth place.

In 1,788 major-league games over 15 seasons, Jones posted a .285 batting average (1,920-for-6,747) with 1,180 runs, 206 doubles, 75 triples, 21 home runs, 631 runs batted in, 359 stolen bases, 817 bases on balls, .368 on-base percentage and .347 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .962 fielding percentage.

Later life
Jones died of heart disease in Portland, Oregon, at age 62.
