Here Comes the Night is the ninth studio album by singer-songwriter Barry Manilow, released in 1982 by Arista Records. The United Kingdom release went by the title I Wanna Do It With You. It received a Gold certification from the RIAA. The album was recorded at Sound City Recording Studios in Van Nuys, California.

The album has yet to be released on CD in the US, but has had 2 CD releases in Japan: one was a 1987 incarnation that included a remix of "Oh Julie" (with added background vocals and additional instrumentation), and then in 1994, a new reissue came out in Japan that contained the original mix of "Oh Julie", as released in the US in 1982 on both EP and 45.

The album contains three charting singles: "Memory" (#8 US AC, #39 US), "Some Kind of Friend" (#4 US AC, #26 US), and "Oh Julie" (#24 US AC, #38 US), which was found on the UK cassette version as a bonus track.
