"On Your Own" is a song by the English rock band the Verve from their second album, A Northern Soul (1995). It was released on 12 June 1995 as the album's second single, charting at number 28 on the UK Singles Chart.

Lyrics
The song appears to be based on the work of the Smiths, using some of their techniques, such as adding major sevenths and features a lyric close to the one in "How Soon Is Now?":

"You come in on your own / and you leave on your own"

Compared to the lyric in "On Your Own":

"and you stand on your own / and you leave on your own".

Lead singer Richard Ashcroft also recorded an acoustic version of On Your Own that contained only piano and acoustic guitar, in addition to Ashcroft's vocals. The vinyl version is green and includes the B-side "I See the Door". A small number of the green vinyl release were misprinted and featured the track "Friends" by Daryll-Ann. Nearly all misprinted copies were destroyed, making it a highly collectable single.

Reception
AllMusic writer Jason Aneky considered "On Your Own" to be a remarkable song, and a highlight on the album.

Music video
The music video was directed by Jake Scott (son of Ridley Scott) and features the band performing on a foggy street.
