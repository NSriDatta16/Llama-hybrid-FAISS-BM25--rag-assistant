Route description

NM 456 parallels the Cimarron River for its entire length. It does not leave Union County. It is a former routing of U.S. Route 64 (US 64). Seventeen consecutive miles of it are unpaved, as per signs at each end of the unpaved stretch; their main purpose is to warn of potential impassibility in inclement weather. The stretch does have two spots of pavement, nevertheless: one about  in from the west, which is only about  long, and one about  in from the west, which often confuses drivers since it is so near to the end of the advertised length (its pavement lasts about ). The drive has some nice scenic views, including one reminiscent of Colorado's Garden of the Gods; but its remoteness is not amicable to tourists having automobile breakdowns.
