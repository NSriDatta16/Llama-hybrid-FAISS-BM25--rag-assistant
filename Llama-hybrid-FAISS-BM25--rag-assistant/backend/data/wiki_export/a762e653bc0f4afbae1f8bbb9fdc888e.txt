The Honda S-MX () is a compact MPV produced by Honda, sold between 1996 and 2002.

Design 
The S-MX was based on the S-MX Concept model first exhibited at the 31st Tokyo Motor Show in 1995, and was similar in appearance to the larger Honda Stepwgn, shortened substantially in length and height. Whereas the Stepwgn had three rows of seating to accommodate eight passengers the smaller S-MX has two rows of seating for four or five passengers. In order to maximize space for passengers the S-MX uses a front bench seat and a column shifter for the four-speed automatic transmission (the only available transmission).

The S-MX was powered by a 2.0 L version of Honda's B-series engine featuring double overhead camshafts and four valves per cylinder; it did not use Honda's VTEC system. Peak power output was  at 5,500 rpm and peak torque was  at 4,200 rpm. This engine was shared with the Honda CR-V and Honda Stepwgn. Similar to the CR-V and Stepwgn, the S-MX was available with front-wheel-drive or optional four-wheel-drive. As part of a September 1999 facelift, the engine was upgraded to produce  and  at the same engine speeds.

As was customary of minivans of the time the S-MX features only one (conventional) rear door on the passenger (left) side of the vehicle. Ostensibly this feature was for the safety of passengers, to prevent them from stepping out into traffic. All chassis codes start with RH1 for the Base model and Lowdown (Lowdown is also printed on the chassis plate). All 4WD models have chassis codes starting with RH2.

Facelift 
The S-MX was slightly restyled in September 1999. Another minor change took place in December the following year.

Improvements were made to the styling with re-modeled headlights and front bumper.
