Nordic combined at the 1960 Winter Olympics consisted of one event, held from 21 February to 22 February. The ski jumping portion took place at Papoose Peak Jumps, while the cross-country portion took place at McKinney Creek Stadium (Tahoma, California).

Competition opened with the ski jumping event. Standings were determined by a point system under the parameters of combined distance points (3 jumps per competitor) and "style" points awarded for each attempt. The table below reflects the best distance out of three attempts.

The following day, the second part of the Nordic Combined mandated the 15 kilometer cross-country competition. Points were awarded by timing (set number of points by timed placing). The combined points total of both events determined the final standings.

This event marked the first time the DÃ¤scher Technique was used in the ski jumping part of the Nordic Combined competition.
