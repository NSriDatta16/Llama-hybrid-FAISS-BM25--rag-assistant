Harvey Films v. Columbia Pictures
On October 28, 1986, Harvey Films had a lawsuit with Columbia Pictures claiming that the logo for the film Ghostbusters was similar to the logo for The Ghostly Trio, specifically the ghost in the logo was similar to Fatso, and Columbia argued that Fatso was only a portion of their, at the time, renewed trademark, and there were three ghosts instead of just one. The court argued that the logos are largely dissimilar and that The Ghostly Trio had only the words of the trademark and the three ghosts while the logo for Ghostbusters has a sign for prohibition with only the torso and head of only one ghost. The expressions are different, with their ghosts having mischievous or evil facial expressions, while the other one is bewildered. The court said:

The court dismissed the case for not violating their trademark.
