De La Salle College Waterford is a secondary school in Waterford, Ireland with over 1,000 students and 90 teachers.

De La Salle Teachers Training College
The De La Salle Brothers had a presence in Waterford since the 1870s, and opened a teacher training college at Newtown, Waterford in 1894. In 1894 Mr. J.L. Ahearn was appointed professor of irish, the first such appointment in a teacher training college. Students who completed the two year course were awarded the National Teacher(NT) qualification entitling them to teach in primary (national) schools.

In May 1939, lay teacher training ceased (male teacher training centered in St. Patrick's, Drumcondra), however, the De La Salle brothers continued to be trained for another 10 years, along with Marist and Presentation Brothers, in 1972 an agreement was made where brothers were trained alongside the christian brothers in St. Mary's College, Marino.

Secondary school
A secondary school was opened on the site in the 1940s. In 1948 it officially opened as a Day and Boarding School. The boarding school closed in 1990, and from 1991 operated as a day school only. In 2008 it appointed its first lay principal, and in 2009 The Le Cheile Schools Trust became the trustee body for the
school.  School management was criticised in a 2012 Department of Education inspection report for taking on €500,000 in debts for refurbishments with little educational benefit, and for teachers teaching subjects for which they were not qualified, under the leadership of then principal Gearoid O' Brien.
