Heather-Dina Lakes Provincial Park is a provincial park in British Columbia, Canada. Located along the eastern edge of Williston Lake, Heather-Dina Lakes Park, which is named after two lakes in the park, features mature, mixed forest with many small lakes. Facilities are quite limited compared to other parks in British Columbia.  A primitive campground is located at Heather Lake and another at Dina Lake.  Camping, fishing, canoeing, and hiking are popular activities among visitors.
