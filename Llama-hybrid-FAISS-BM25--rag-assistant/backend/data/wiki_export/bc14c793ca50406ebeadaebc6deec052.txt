Holmes came off the bench in Australia's loss to England at Twickenham, where the English overpowered the Wallabies with their scrummaging. He was included in John Connolly's Wallabies side to face England at Telstra Stadium. In the return match against the English, Australia won 34 to 3. In 2006, Holmes scored a remarkable try against the Irish, running over 60 metres to touch down. He also scored in Australia's 49-0 victory over South Africa, this time scoring a try more akin to a prop by smashing through three South African would-be tacklers. In 2011, Holmes was included in Wallabies squad.

Holmes announced on 21 December 2015 that he would be calling time on his Wallabies career and joining Aviva Premiership side Exeter Chiefs for the 2016/17 season on a two-year deal.

He later signed for the Western Force ahead of the 2020 Super Rugby AU season before being recalled to the national squad for a Test against Argentina in the 2021 Rugby Championship at the age of 38, making him the oldest Wallaby to make the side since World War II.
