Some of her many albums are Ornaments—Music for Christmas, Be Thou My Vision—Favorite Hymns for Dulcimer and St. Patrick's Day in the Morning—Music of Irish Inspiration.

For ten years, Collins hosted Sounds Like Fun, a children's radio show on WXXI-FM in Rochester, New York. Collins is president of Sampler Records Ltd. in Rochester, New York. She is also on the faculty of the Eastman School of Music, and she teaches several classes, including hammered dulcimer classes, at the Eastman Community Music School.
