The Munster Senior League was a Rugby union competition for senior clubs in Munster.

History 

It was first competed for in 1902â€“03.

Format 

Unlike the Munster Senior Cup which is knock-out, the league format means that teams play a number of different games, with the most successful qualifying for the play-offs.

Decline 

With the establishment of the All-Ireland League in 1991 the competition declined rapidly, and no longer was contested with the same intensity as previously existed.
