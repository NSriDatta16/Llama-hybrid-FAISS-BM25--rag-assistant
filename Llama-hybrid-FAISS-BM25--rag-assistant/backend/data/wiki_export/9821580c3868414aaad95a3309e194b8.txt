History
The Harn Museum of Art is named in honor of Samuel Peebles Harn (1893–1957), whose widow, three daughters, sons-in-law, and grandchildren made the founding gift to UF for the museum’s construction. The family pledged more than $3 million for the construction of an arts museum in 1983. The Harn Museum of Art opened September 20, 1990.

In 2000, the family of David A. Cofrin made a gift to fund an 18,000-square-foot addition. The addition, named the Mary Ann Harn Cofrin Pavilion, opened in October 2005. The Cofrin Pavilion features 6,500 feet of exhibition space for international contemporary art, the Camellia Court Café, an outdoor plaza and the Goforth Learning Center, which is used for meetings, programs and educational activities. thumb| Outdoor garden alongside the Asian art wing|alt= On February 6, 2008, Dr. and Mrs. David A. Cofrin made a commitment of $10 million to the University of Florida to fund the addition of a new wing dedicated to Asian art. Opened in 2012 on the northwest side of the museum, the 26,000-square-foot addition features an Asian art gallery, curatorial offices, and art storage and conservation space for the Asian collections. The expansion included an outdoor Asian garden to complement the new wing.

Management 
The founding director of the Harn Museum of Art was Budd Harris Bishop, who was previously at the Columbus Museum of Art.  He joined in 1987 and selected the architect, hired staff and significantly built up the collection during his tenure.  Bishop served as director through 1998.

Rebecca Nagy served as museum director for 16 years until her retirement in 2018.

In July 2018, Lee Anne Chesterfield (from the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts) began serving as the Harn Museum's director.

Architecture 

The original architecture for the Harn Museum was designed by Kha Le-Huu, a native of South Vietnam and a 1982 architecture alumni of the University of Florida.  Le-Huu reportedly designed the building to include buddhist sensibilities in the entrance garden along with featuring his contemporary aesthetic for geometric elements including use of the tetrahedron.  Kha Le-Huu & Partners of Orlando, Florida also designed the additional wing for Asian art, completed in 2011.

The Harn Museum features several outdoor gardens including an Asian Water Garden and an Asian Rock Garden designed by Hoichi Kurisu of Kurisu International.  The Arts in Medicine (AIM) program at the University of Florida works together with patients to generate new patterns for the zen rock garden as a form of therapy at the Harn Museum.  Two additional gardens, by landscape designer Aaron Lee Wiener, are viewable from the galleries.
