History 
The area of Mahina was first settled by early Polynesians. Large, double-hulled canoes made out of tree trunks were used to sail across the Pacific, some vessels making it to Tahiti.
In 1768, Captain James Cook was sent to Tahiti to observe the Transit of Venus. He set up his observatory in Mahina, on the black sand beach at the end of Matavai Bay, now called Pointe Vénus.
He later sailed off to nearby Mo'orea and a few years later, he sailed to New Zealand and Australia. Charles Darwin had later come to Tahiti on his expedition. Don the Beachcomber had lived in Tahiti until his house was destroyed by a cyclone. 
The Faaa International Airport in Faaa was built in 1962, 16 km away from Mahina. 
In 2007, Air Moorea flight 1121 crashed right after take of from Faaa Airport on its way to Mo'orea, killing all 20 people on board.

Transportation 

Tahiti's 5 km west coast freeway called RDO (Route de Dégagement Ouest) ends in nearby Papeʻete and smaller 2-lane roads lead to the ending of the freeway through the city of Papeʻete. The main roads in Māhina are paved, while some roads further inside the island turn into dirt tracks and lead deep into valleys.

Geography 

Mahina is on the northern coast of Tahiti about 9 meters above mean sea level. The commune of Arue is located to the west of Mahina.

Faaa has one of the largest supermarkets in the island with clothing stores, beauty shops, a pharmacy, furniture stores, cafes and Tahitian restaurants. Mahina has a few industrial valleys that are home to factories. Some hardware stores such as Polybuild, Polymat, and Polywood are found in these valleys.

Safety
