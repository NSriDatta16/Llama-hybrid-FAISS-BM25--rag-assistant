Dimitrios (Mimis) Theiopoulos () (12 April 1927 - 8 April 2010) was a veteran Greek actor, lyricist and screenwriter. Traditionally a character actor, he is mostly known from his work in Greek straight to video cinema; however, he has numerous appearances both in Greek television and stage and he has contributed to scripts of various comedies. A lesser known fact about him is his status as a lyricist of many immensely popular "laika" Greek songs, including collaborations with Tolis Voskopoulos, Christos Nikolopoulos, Yiorgos Chatzinasios and others. While retired, he recently appeared in the international film production of A Touch of Spice (Politiki Kouzina).
