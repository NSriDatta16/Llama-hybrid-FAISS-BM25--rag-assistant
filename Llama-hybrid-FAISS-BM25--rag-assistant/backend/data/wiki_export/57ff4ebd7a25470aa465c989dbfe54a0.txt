History
The municipality of Bodø landdistrikt was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). It included the rural areas surrounding the town of Bodø. In 1896, the name of the municipality was changed to Bodin. On 1 July 1938, an area of Bodin (population: 559) was transferred to the town of Bodø. On 1 January 1959, another area of Bodin (population: 1,303) was transferred to the town of Bodø. On 1 January 1963, an area of Skjerstad (population: 224) was transferred to Bodin Municipality.

During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the majority of the municipality of Kjerringøy (population: 524) and the Øyjord area of Sørfold Municipality (population: 81) were merged into Bodin. Then on 1 January 1968, the municipality of Bodin (population: 13,323) was merged with the town of Bodø (population: 14,252) to create a new, much larger, Bodø Municipality.  Upon merging, Bodin had a population of 13,323 and Bodø had a population of 14,252.

Name
Until 1896, the name of the municipality was Bodø landdistrikt, meaning "the rural district of Bodø". The town of Bodø is named after the old Bodøgård farm meaning "the farm (gård) of Bodø".  The Old Norse form of the farm's name was  or , and the municipality (originally the parish) was named after it because the first church (Bodin Church) was built on its ground. The meaning of the first element is, maybe,  which means "skerry". The last element is  which means "meadow" or "pasture". In 1896, the municipality was renamed Bodin which is a more modern version of the older Old Norse form .
