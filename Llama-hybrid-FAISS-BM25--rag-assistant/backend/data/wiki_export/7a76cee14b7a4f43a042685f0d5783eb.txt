Jinx is a comic book series published first by Caliber Comics and then Image Comics, written and drawn by Brian Michael Bendis.

Synopsis
Jinx is a prequel to the same author's A.K.A. Goldfish, telling the story of Jinx, a female bounty hunter and her relationship with David Goldfish, con-artist and wanted felon. Jinx has also crossed over with the detective series Sam and Twitch. There she helps them track down a bounty hunter that has become mentally deranged.

The story is a loose adaptation of Sergio Leone's  The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, but resets it in the modern crime noir genre.
