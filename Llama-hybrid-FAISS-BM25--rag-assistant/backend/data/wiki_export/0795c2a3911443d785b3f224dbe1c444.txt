History

The settlement is recorded as village and with two names first as "Kiliseli" and as "Çerniçani" in the Ottoman Tahrir Defter number 101 dating to 1521. The village participated in the Greek War of Independence and offered fighters to the Sacred Band.

The first guerilla groups of the Greek People's Liberation Army in the area were created from residents of Tsaritsani. The village is the ancestral home of popular wartime singer Sofia Vembo. The village witnessed mass execution of its people twice, on 12 March 1943 and on 20 August 1944 by the Italian and German occupation forces respectively.
