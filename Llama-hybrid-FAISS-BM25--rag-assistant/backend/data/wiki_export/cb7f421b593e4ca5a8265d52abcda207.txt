Aetion  (Ancient Greek: ) was an ancient Greek sculptor of Amphipolis, mentioned by Callimachus and Theocritus, from whom we learn that at the request of Nicias, a famous physician of Miletus, he executed a statue of Asclepius in cedar wood. He flourished about the middle of the 3rd century BC.  There was an engraver of the same name; but when he lived is not known.
