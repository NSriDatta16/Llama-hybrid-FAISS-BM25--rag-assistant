He taught at Yeshiva University and Indiana University, then moved to Michigan in 1985. While at the University of Michigan, Endelman served as director of the Jean & Samuel Frankel Center for Judaic Studies intermittently for 11 years. During his tenure as director, there was a significant growth for the program, including the creation of a Masters program and the establishment of the Frankel Institute for Advanced Judaic Studies with a $20 million endowment.
