In the summer of 2008, due in part to the successes of the Valdosta High School athletic programs, Valdosta was featured on ESPN as a candidate for TitleTown USA.  This was a month-long segment on ESPN that started in the spring of 2008 and continued through July.  Fans nominated towns and cities across the country based on their championship pedigree. A panel reviewed the nominees and fan voting in May determined the 20th finalist. SportsCenter visited each city in July, and fan voting July 23–27 determined the winner. On July 28, 2008, ESPN named Valdosta as Titletown, United States.

During the 2020 season, the head coach was Rush Propst, formerly at Colquitt County High School in Moultrie, Georgia and Hoover High School in Hoover, Alabama. Propst was put on probation in early 2021 for controversy about paying players for their housing costs. After determining five players were ineligible, the Georgia High School Association fined the Wildcats $7500 and banned the team from playing in the 2021 postseason. The Netflix reality television series Titletown High highlights the team's 2020 season.

The current head coach, Shelton Felton is in his second season at Valdosta. Felton went 8-2 in the regular season and 2-2 in region 1-7A with a defeat over their rivals The Lowndes High Vikings 13-6.
