Route description 

NY 305 begins at the Pennsylvania state line as a continuation of PA 446 in the town of Portville. The designation proceeds northward as Portville-Eldred Road, paralleling the Allegheny River and ponds as a two-lane rural highway. After an intersection with Barbertown Road, NY 305 enters the hamlet of Carroll and passes several residences northward. The route crosses Oswayo Creek, intersecting with NY 417 (Portville-Ceres Road). NY 305 and NY 417 form a concurrency, crossing north through the hamlet of Toll Gate Corner as a two-lane residential street, entering the village of Portville. In Portville village, NY 305 turns to the northeast away from NY 417 at an intersection with Brooklyn Street. Turning north on Brooklyn, paralleling a long stretch of residences and crossing the former Bradford Division. Passing east of Chestnut Hill Cemetery, NY 305 leaves the village.

In the town of Portville, NY 305 changes monikers to Portville-Obi Road, crossing into a two-lane rural highway. Paralleling Dodge Creek to the northeast, NY 305 crosses the county line from the town of Portville into the Allegany County town of Genesee, changing names to Obi Road. Continuing along Dodge Creek, NY 305 parallels several residences before bending northward into the hamlet of Obi in the town of Clarksville. In Obi, NY 305 intersects with County Route 5 (CR 5; Daggett Hollow Road) in the residential hamlet. Continuing northward, NY 305 enters the hamlet of West Clarksville, where the route becomes a two-lane residential street and an intersection with CR 40 (Jordan Hill Road).

In South Cuba, the route intersects with CR 6 before entering the village of Cuba. In Cuba, NY 305 becomes known as South Street, crossing the former Erie Railroad main line into the village. Continuing northward, NY 305 becomes a two-lane residential street. At the intersection with CR 20 (East Main Street), NY 305 changes names to Genesee Street, intersecting with the eastern terminus of NY 446 (Water Street).

History
The segment of modern NY 305 north of Cuba was originally the southernmost portion of Route 16, an unsigned legislative route assigned by the New York State Legislature in 1908. At Belfast, Route 16 continued north on what is now NY 19. The Cuba–Belfast section of legislative Route 16 was assigned a posted route designation as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York when it was designated as the northern half of NY 94, which continued south through Cuba to NY 17 (now NY 417) in Portville. At the same time, what is now NY 45 in Rockland County was designated as NY 305. The NY 94 and NY 305 designations were swapped in the early 1940s, placing NY 305 on its current alignment from Portville to Belfast. South of Portville, what is now NY 305 was originally designated as part of NY 16 . It was added to NY 305 in August 1962 when NY 16 was rerouted south of Olean to follow what had been NY 16A.
