Composition
Musically, "Somnambulist (Simply Being Loved)" is a techno-pop song. It includes BT's signature stutter edits with the audio manually altered by being "split, cut, joined, and [...] mangled", which was created using BT's setup titled Laptop Symphony. The stutter edits contributed to the song's inclusion on the Guinness Book of World Records in 2003 for the largest number of vocal edits in a song, with 6,178 edits. A "frequency-specific swing" is incorporated in "Somnambulist (Simply Being Loved)", which BT described on the January 2004 issue of Keyboard as "higher frequencies [...] swinging harder, and lower frequencies [...] swinging less". The beats on the song's kick and snare contain 1,025 samples, while the percussion on the Roland JP-8000's acid line contain 202 samples. The lyrics are inspired by American writer Henry Miller, and include the mantra: "Simply being love, love, loved is more than enough."

Critical reception
Writing for The Washington Post, Richard Harrington described "Somnambulist (Simply Being Loved)" as "lightly propulsive". Billboard writer Keith Caulfield wrote that it is "hypnotic" and singled out the song as a highlight from Emotional Technology. Michael Hamersly of Miami Herald compared the "quirky" sound in "Somnambulist (Simply Being Loved)" to Star Wars character R2-D2 and commented that the chorus is "spiritual". However, Los Angeles Times writer Tommy Nguyen opined that it is "hopelessly moderate" in BT's attempts for a "[vague] crossover sound".

Matt Frilingos of The Daily Telegraph stated that "Somnambulist (Simply Being Loved)" "[hit] the mark" and acknowledged that BT could identify "emotive vocals", while Calgary Herald writer Nick Lewis praised Chasez's vocals on the "catchy" song. Writing for PopMatters, Andy Hermann criticized the repetitive lyrics and described BT's foray into the pop genre as "drivel".
