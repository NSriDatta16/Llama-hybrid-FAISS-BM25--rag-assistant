There is a cathedral in Kuwait City dedicated to the Holy Family. However, this church is now a co-cathedral with the Cathedral of Our Lady of Arabia in Bahrain.

The other parishes are St. Thérèse Parish, Salmiya, Our Lady of Arabia Parish, Ahmadi and St. Daniel Comboni Parish, Jleeb Al-Shuyoukh. In 2002, the Salesian religious order started an English language school in the country.
