Oshkosh North High School is a public secondary/high school located in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. Part of the Oshkosh Area School District, the school serves students in grades 9 through 12.

The facility holds an in-house TV studio, swimming pool, field house with Weight Room, and an auditorium.

The school was built in 1972 as a second high school for the city, when the Oshkosh West High School, formerly known as Oshkosh High School, facilities became too small to support the growing number for students. The school first opened as an open-concept school, with modular walls between classrooms, and multiple classes taking place in one room at the same time. After the 70s, the school began to shift toward a traditional layout, adding in permanent walls and separating many of the large classrooms.
