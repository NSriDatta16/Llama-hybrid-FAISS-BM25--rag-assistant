Early life and education
Endrizzi was born in Italy to Henrique Endrizzi, an Italian-Brazilian agronomist specialized in enology and Adelina Anna Maria (Gelinda) Roat, an Austrian from 
Ischia di Pergine, near Trento (now Italy). The family moved in 1921 to Brazil, where his uncle, Américo Virgílio Endrizzi, was living as a Catholic priest who helped build the Santa Casa Stella Maris in the city of Caraguatatuba, undoing all its family heritage and donating a plot of land for its construction. Following the practice of his father, who worked as a travelling rural adviser for the Instituto Agronômico de Campinas, Endrizzi lived and studied each year in a different city: Piracicaba in 1928, Botucatu in 1929, Bauru in 1930, Sorocaba in 1931, Campinas in 1932–1933, São Carlos in 1934–1935, Campinas again in 1937, and São Paulo in 1938-1939 (where he started in the pre-medical school).

In 1940 he began studying Medicine at the University of São Paulo. While a student there, he worked as internist under Alípio Correa Neto and Mário Gatti.

Career
After graduation, in 1945, Dr. Endrizzi became an assistant anesthesiologist, the head of the blood bank at a hospital in São Paulo, an obstetrician in its maternity ward, and a gynecological surgeon. From 1957 to 1963 he was clinical director at the SESC Maternity of São Paulo,

In 1972 he earned a doctorate from the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of São Paulo. His thesis was entitled "Contribuição para o Tratamento da Insuficiência Cervical Uterina pela Circlagem" (A Contribution for the Treatment of Uterine Cervical Insufficiency by Cerclage).
