History
The region around Serranópolis has been home to humans for millennia. The remains of an adult man and child were found locally by Altair Sales Barbosa of the Catholic University of Goias and are tentatively dated to 11,000 years ago. They were accompanied by necklaces of human teeth and mother of pearl, some of the oldest known jewelry in the Americas.
 
The history of European occupation is relatively recent.  The first settlers arrived in the decade of the 1880s and grew rice, tobacco, coffee, corn, and beans.  In 1953 the settlement called Serra do Cafezal had its name changed to Nuputira, which later was changed to Serranópolis, becoming independent from Jataí in 1959.
