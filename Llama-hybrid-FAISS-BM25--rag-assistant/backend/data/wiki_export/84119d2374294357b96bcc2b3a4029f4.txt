The Romanian Footballer of the Year (), also known as the Nicolae Dobrin Trophy (), is an annual association football award given by the Gazeta Sporturilor newspaper to the Romanian player adjudged to have been the best during a calendar year. The current holder is Nicolae Stanciu, who won the award for his performances in 2022 representing Wuhan Three Towns.

It has been presented since 1966 and is currently named after Nicolae Dobrin, the first recipient of the award and one of Romania's most notable footballers. Gheorghe Hagi, the joint leading goalscorer of the national team alongside Adrian Mutu, has received the trophy a record of seven times.

Other annual honours handed out by Gazeta Sporturilor include the Foreign Player of the Year in Romania and the Romania Coach of the Year awards.
