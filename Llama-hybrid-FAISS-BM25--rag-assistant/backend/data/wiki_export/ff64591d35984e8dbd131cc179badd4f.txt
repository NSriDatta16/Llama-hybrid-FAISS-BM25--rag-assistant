History

Establishment and merging into Guangxi University 
Guangxi Normal University was established in 1932 as Guangxi Provincial Teacher's College, the first normal school in the Guangxi region and one of the first teacher training institutions in the country. Its first president was notable educator Yang Dongyu (). The original campus was located in the Yanshan District of Guilin, where the modern university now maintains a branch campus.

Almost immediately from its establishment, the fledgling institution became the center of a power struggle between the provincial Guangxi government and the Nationalist Ministry of Education, resulting in a long period of evolution, absorption into other institutions, renaming, and re-establishment. In 1936, the provincial government ordered the school to merge into National Guangxi University (now known as Guangxi University, the flagship public university of Guanxi province). The school became the National Guangxi University College of Liberal Arts, which focused on the humanities and no longer functioned solely as a normal school.

Relocation and evolution into an independent institution 
In 1941, a greater demand for schoolteachers in Guangxi caused the college to be separated from Guangxi University and reconstituted as the independent Guangxi Teacher's College. The school was renamed the Guangxi Guilin Teacher's College in 1942, and then National Guilin Teacher's College in 1943. In February 1946, the school moved to the city of Nanning and became the National Nanning Teacher's College.

In February 1950, the school moved back to Guilin and merged with National Guangxi University for the second time. This time, the school became the National Guangxi University Teacher's College, also known as the College of Culture and Education, retaining its function as a normal school.

In 1953, the People's Republic of China began a nationwide reorganization of higher education institutions. In July 1953, the Ministry of Education ordered the re-establishment of the normal school as an independent institution to be known as Guangxi Teacher's College. To support the creation of the new school, Guangxi University transferred 53 professors in its departments of Chinese, foreign languages, history, mathematics, physics, and chemistry, as well as 256 faculty members of the College of Culture and Education (many of them faculty of the original Guangxi Provincial Teacher's College), to the Guangxi Teacher's College.

Once again independent, the school was granted the historic Jingjiang Princes' Palace in Guilin, Guangxi as its new Wangcheng Campus.

Until 1978, it was the only institution of higher education in Guangxi authorized to grant a Bachelor's degree in teacher education. In 1981, the Guangxi Teacher's College received authorization to grant master's degrees.

On May 29, 1983, the institution incorporated as the Guangxi Normal University. It granted its first doctoral degrees in 2006.

As of 2018, the university had 26,831 undergraduate students, 6,386 graduate students, and 171 PhD candidates, including over 1,600 international students across all degree programs. Additionally, 16,000 correspondence, online, and visiting students are enrolled in GXNU programs.
