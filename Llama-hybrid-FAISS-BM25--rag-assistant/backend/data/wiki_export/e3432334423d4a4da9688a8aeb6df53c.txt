Gymnasticos Syllogos Thessalonikis "Iraklis" (, ), commonly referred to as Iraklis Thessaloniki, is a Greek multi-sports club based in Thessaloniki. The club was founded in 1908 as "Macedonikos Gymnasticos Syllogos" (Macedonian Gymnastics Club) and is one of the oldest and most historic sports-clubs in Greece. It is named after Heracles, the mythical Greek demigod. Their colours are blue or cyan and white, inspired by the Greek flag.

G.S. Iraklis Thessaloniki traces its roots back in 1899 when Omilos Filomouson (meaning Friends of Music Club) was established. The club was established as a cultural union of the Greeks of Thessaloniki (then under Ottoman sovereignty), and in 1902 was founded also a sports department. After a merger with a local team, the club was re-founded on 29 November 1908, called Macedonikos Gymnasticos Syllogos (meaning Macedonian Gymnastics Club). A year later, "Iraklis" (Heracles) was added to the club's name as an honour to the ancient Greek hero.
