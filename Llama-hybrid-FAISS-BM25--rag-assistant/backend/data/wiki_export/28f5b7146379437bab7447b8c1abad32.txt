Olympiacos
His transfer to Greek league champions Olympiacos made him the first Ecuadorian player to play for a Greek team. Borja was declared Copa Libertadores de América's joint top goalscorer two months after his transfer to Olympiacos.

Mainz 05
Due to his sub-standard performances for Olympiacos in his first season, as well as the fact that he occupies a non-EU player spot at his current team's roster, Olympiacos had the desire at the end of the 2006–07 season to sell him or loan him for the upcoming season. Due to that decision by the club, Borja was loaned out to German club Mainz 05 for the 2007–08 season. At the end of the season, Mainz signed him permanently. During the winter transfer window of the 2010-11 season, Borja was allowed to leave on a free transfer ahead of an expected move to Mexican club Puebla F.C.
