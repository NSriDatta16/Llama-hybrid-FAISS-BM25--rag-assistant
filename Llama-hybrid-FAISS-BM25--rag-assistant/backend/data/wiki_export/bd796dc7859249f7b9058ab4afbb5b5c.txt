The University of Toronto Mississauga (UTM), also known as U of T Mississauga, is one of the three campuses that make up the tri-campus system of the University of Toronto. Located in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, the campus opened in 1967 as Erindale College, set upon the valley of the Credit River, approximately 33 km west of Downtown Toronto. It is the second-largest of the three University of Toronto campuses, the other two of which are the St. George campus in Downtown Toronto and the U of T Scarborough campus in Scarborough, Ontario.

History
The site of the Mississauga campus is the former estate of Reginald Watkins, which was acquired by the University of Toronto in 1963. Founded as Erindale College in 1965, construction of the University's main building began in 1966. Although this building was originally meant to be temporary, the building remained until 2016 as part of the North Building. In 1998, Erindale College was rebranded as University of Toronto Mississauga.

In 2007, UTM celebrated its 40th anniversary, a milestone which was capped off with the grand opening of the Hazel McCallion Academic Learning Centre on June 2, 2007.

In 2017, UTM celebrated its 50th anniversary, a milestone that coincided with Canada's sesquicentennial.  The campus is used as the location of Godolkin University in the Amazon Series Gen V.

Campus

The campus consists of a number of buildings arranged across a large, treed lot. The surrounding suburban neighbourhood (the Mississauga Road area and the Credit Woodlands) is a fairly affluent section of the city of Mississauga. The largest building was built as a megalithic structure, predominantly out of concrete, as was typical of the brutalist architecture style of the late 1960s. It was one of architect Raymond Moriyama's first major commissions. Other buildings were added over the decades, and with the enlarged enrollment at the beginning of the new millennium, the pace of construction increased.

In September 2014, UTM opened Deerfield Hall, the first phase of the two-phase reconstruction of the North Building. It features four storeys with theatre rehearsal space, computer labs, classrooms, offices, formal and informal study space and an expanded food services area. The North Building Phase B, later named Maanjiwe nendamowinan—a 220,595-square-foot, six-storey structure—opened in September 2018. The LEED-certified project cost approximately $89 million. 
The Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation (MCFN) on whose traditional territory the campus now stands, recommended Maanjiwe nendamowinan (pronounced Mahn-ji-way nen-da-mow-in-ahn), a formally endorsed Anishinaabemowin name meaning “gathering of minds.”

A new CCT (formerly CCIT) building, designed by Saucier + Perrot, was opened in September 2004. It is characterized by a black and glass exterior. The interior is finished in concrete and gray paint, with black plastic melamine on many surfaces. The new library and academic learning centre, designed by Shore Tilbe Irwin + Partners and named after Mississauga's mayor, Hazel McCallion, opened October 8, 2006, and the new Recreation, Athletics and Wellness Centre, also by Shore Tilbe, opened less than a month previous to that. The new library consists of four floors with a mixture of group study tables and individual silent study space.

The Mississauga Academy of Medicine, which opened in August 2011 with 54 first-year students, is a partnership between UTM, the University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine, and the three hospitals of the Trillium Health Partners system. The new facility is located across two floors inside the new Terrence Donnelly Health Sciences Complex and provides brand new classrooms, seminar rooms, computer facilities, learning spaces and laboratories. Students are provided with fully equipped student lounge and outdoor terrace to relax and socialize. Students are able to share lectures and learning experiences both inside and outside the classroom through advanced technologies.

In 2013, $1 million dollars was spent on constructing a large stone monument at the entrance way to the campus, along with general repairs to nearby sidewalks, pedestrian crossings, lighting, and electrical equipment. The stone monument became the centre of a controversy, with an almost universally negative reaction from students due to what was seen as excessive expenditure and lack of student involvement in the approval process, though the university said that a student was on the committee that approved the project.

Its most popular programs include Anthropology, Biology, Chemistry, Commerce, CCIT (Communications, Culture Information and Technology), Computer Science, Criminology & Socio-Legal Studies, Earth Science, English, Environmental Studies, History, Management, Philosophy, Psychology, and Sociology.

U of T Mississauga's best-known president was Dr. J. Tuzo Wilson, a geologist and pioneer in plate tectonics. A research wing in the William G. Davis building of U of T Mississauga is named after him.
