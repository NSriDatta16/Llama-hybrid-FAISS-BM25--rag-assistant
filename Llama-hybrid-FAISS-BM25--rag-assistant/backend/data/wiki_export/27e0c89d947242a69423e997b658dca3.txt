Plot
The poverty-stricken Squire Amos Haggard, who is a former friend of the Prince of Wales, is desperate for money and is always plotting for ways in which he can recoup the family fortune.

The Squire's son, Roderick, is idealistic and falls in love very easily.  Roderick is more interested in beautiful young ladies than he is in money, and his foolishness often brings his father's schemes undone.

Nathanial Grunge, their servant, is richer than his two masters, and would like to be free of them to pursue his own dreams (something he finds impossible to do because the Squire often uses Grunge's money in his get-rich-quick schemes).
