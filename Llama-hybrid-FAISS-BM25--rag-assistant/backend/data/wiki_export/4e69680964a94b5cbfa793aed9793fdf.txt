Dirty Fingers is the third solo studio album by Northern Irish guitarist Gary Moore. It was originally recorded in 1980, but was ultimately shelved in favour of the more "radio-oriented" G-Force album. Three of the tracks ("Nuclear Attack", "Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood" and "Run to Your Mama") were later released as an EP in 1981. The album was eventually released in Japan in 1983 by Jet Records, before an international release the following year. It was also released in the UK in June 1984.
