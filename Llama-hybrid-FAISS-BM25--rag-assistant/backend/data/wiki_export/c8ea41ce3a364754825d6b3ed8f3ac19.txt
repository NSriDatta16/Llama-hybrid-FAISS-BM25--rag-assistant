Business model 

A key mission of the Crutchfield business early on, was providing customers with information about the audio gear and installation. 

As Crutchfield grew, it developed formal departments dedicated to Vehicle Research and Product Research. The company claims to have assembled the largest database of vehicle fit information. 

As of November 2017, they had vehicle fit information on over 25,000 vehicles. This information drives internal resources to support sales and tech support, and is also the basis of the database powering the online Outfit My Car tool. 

The Vehicle Research department also provides the information needed for Crutchfield to produce MasterSheets, which are instruction sheets for installing car stereo products in specific vehicles.

The Product Research arm of Crutchfield verifies the data provided by manufacturers on each consumer electronics product, for car and for home or portable use, in addition to performing additional tests, and measurements itself.

Awards and recognition
In 2007, Bill Crutchfield was inducted into the Consumer Electronics Association Hall of Fame alongside Paul Allen and Amar Bose. The company's website, Crutchfield.com, was the first vendor-authorized audio/video retailer on the Internet.
