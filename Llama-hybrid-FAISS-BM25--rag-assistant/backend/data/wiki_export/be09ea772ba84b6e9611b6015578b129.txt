The magazine stated that unlike other multimedia titles it "is interactive enough to play like a game, yet still retains a cinematic feel", with good acting, a "solid story line", and hints for those unfamiliar with Greek myth. Despite lacking fast travel, the magazine concluded that "Wrath of the Gods is a fun and educational adventure for both the seasoned and novice player. Luminaria has blended a fine mix of hip history, challenging game play, and quality presentation".
