Klis (, , ) is a Croatian municipality located around a mountain fortress bearing the same name. It is a suburb of Split located in the region of Dalmatia, located just northeast of Solin and Split proper near the eponymous mountain pass. It has a population of 3,001, totalling 4,801 together with the eight other villages in its municipality (2011 census).

The Klis mountain pass separates the mountains Mosor and Kozjak at an altitude of 360m. It has had a major strategic value throughout history because any inland force passing through Klis would have been able to easily reach the entire region of Split and Kaštela. During the Ottoman wars in Europe an already existing Roman fortress on a nearby hill was expanded into Klis Fortress. It was the centre of a sanjak within the Province of Bosnia during Ottoman rule. Klis was also ruled by the Kingdom of Bosnia, the Venetian Republic, and Austria-Hungary.
Due to its geographical position Klis is also susceptible to a rather strong bura wind.
