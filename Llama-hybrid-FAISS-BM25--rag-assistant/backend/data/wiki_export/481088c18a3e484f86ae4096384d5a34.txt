The Saga Continues... is the third studio album released by American hip hop artist P. Diddy & The Bad Boy Family on July 10, 2001, in North America. It was the first studio album released by Combs under the P. Diddy name, and last studio album under Bad Boy Entertainment's joint venture with Arista Records (his We Invented the Remix album was the last overall album with Arista).

The album garnered mixed reviews from critics. The Saga Continues... debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 and topped the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, spawning three singles: "Let's Get It", "Bad Boy for Life" and "Diddy".

Critical reception

Soren Baker of the Los Angeles Times called the album "a quality hip-hop collection with plenty of swagger, grit, sure-shot singles and a decidedly upbeat outlook." A staff writer for HipHopDX praised the record for having a diverse roster of new artists and label alumni on "solid cuts" ("Can't Believe", "Let's Get It", "Bad Boy For Life") and "hidden gems" ("So Complete", "Blast Off"), but criticized P. Diddy's "lyrical flow and tempo" for being poorly showcased ("Lonely", "If You Want This Money") and highlighted G. Dep's "Child of the Ghetto" and 8Ball & MJG's "Roll with Me" as "regrettable displays" concluding that, "With the platform of platinum and pop success, The Saga Continues will be a surefire collection that has the following of P.Diddy's string of commercial hits. Forecasting his true signature talent, by seizing his roster
with diverse talent that accompanies his background arrangements."

Steve 'Flash' Juon of RapReviews gave praise to "Bad Boy For Life" and "Where's Sean?" for being "surprisingly dope cuts", P. Diddy's contributions on "Roll with Me" and "I Need a Girl", and G. Dep's "Child of the Ghetto". He criticized "Diddy" for having "one of the weakest ever Neptunes beats", the overabundance of interludes throughout the album and questioned the sampling choices on "Can't Believe" and the title track. AllMusic's Jason Birchmeier praised the record for giving Black Rob and G. Dep the spotlight to "showcase their talent commendably" along with the other roster members and the in-house approach to the production for giving a "cohesive feel", but criticized P. Diddy's "rhetorical swagger" throughout the track listing for "teetering on the fine line between self-assurance and unintentional farce."

Robert Christgau cited "That's Crazy" as a "choice cut", indicating a good song on "an album that isn't worth your time or money." The Guardians Alexis Petridis criticized P. Diddy for still being "a terrible rapper, cursed with a stilted and flat delivery" that's overshadowed by his obscure label members' "shouty contributions" and for lacking the "self-pitying repugnance" from Forever, concluding that: "Puzzling over the album's confused morality and logic is more rewarding than actually listening to its familiar litany of misogyny and violence. It's all been done before and by more talented rappers than Combs and pals."
