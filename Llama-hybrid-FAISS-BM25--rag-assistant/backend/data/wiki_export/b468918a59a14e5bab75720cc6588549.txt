The music of Australia and most particularly the rock, pop, Hip hop and indie rock music of Australia has had a long fascination with the local environment be it urban or rural. This is a list of songs which mention or are about Melbourne the capital city of Victoria, Australia, the suburbs of Melbourne and nearby locations. In 2004, an article by Michael Dwyer published in The Age discussed songs written about Melbourne. A list of twenty-five songs about Melbourne were also published.

The Sydney Morning Herald ran a concurrent article discussing songs written about Sydney at the time. Paul Kelly had four songs in each list, one of which ("From St Kilda to Kings Cross") featured in both lists.

Songs erroneously thought to be about Melbourne
 "Morningtown Ride" by The Seekers. The song was originally a lullaby written by Californian folk singer Malvina Reynolds in 1957. It is often attributed to Melbourne for depicting an old-fashioned train trip to the similarly named beach-side town of Mornington (as The Seekers largely hailed from Melbourne).
 "Town With No Cheer" by Tom Waits - although often believed to be about Melbourne, the titular town is actually Serviceton.

 "I've Been Everywhere" – a popular novelty song which mentions, inter alia, several Melbourne suburbs albeit not Melbourne itself.
