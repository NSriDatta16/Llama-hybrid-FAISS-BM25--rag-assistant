History

The Statutes of Nieszawa, enacted in this town at 1454, have a significance in Polish legal and social history.

Nieszawa was granted town rights in 1460, and in the following centuries it was a royal town of the Polish Crown, administratively located in the Brześć Kujawski Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province.

Following the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939, the town was invaded and then occupied by Germany. The Germans immediately carried mass arrests of Poles as part of the Intelligenzaktion. Nieszawa was one of the sites of executions of Poles carried out by Germany in 1939 as part of the Intelligenzaktion. In December 1939, the Germans also expelled around 1,000 Poles from the town. Further expulsions of Poles were carried out in 1940. Houses, offices, shops and workshops of expelled Poles were handed over to Germans as part of the Lebensraum policy. In 1945 the German occupation ended and the town was restored to Poland, although with a Soviet-installed communist regime, which remained in power until the Fall of Communism in the 1980s.
