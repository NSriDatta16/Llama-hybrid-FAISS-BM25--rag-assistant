History
The district dates back to 1875, when the Town of Sigel first organized a school district, though a one-room school has been built in 1868. Ground was broken on Cadott High School in 1882; its doors opened on January 16, 1884 and its first class graduated in 1887. New high school buildings were built in 1916 and 1960. Though elementary classes had  been taught at the high school since 1886, Cadott Elementary School was first built in 1954 and was replaced by a new building in 1978.

In 1974, a  school forest was donated in the Town of Anson. Donations to the district have allowed it to construct a building, develop trails and build an access through the property.
