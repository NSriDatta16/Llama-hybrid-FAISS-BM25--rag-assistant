Accidents and incidents
 On 18 December 2013, an Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 767 (ET-AQW) flight from Addis Ababa to Kilimanjaro International Airport made an unscheduled landing at the airport after it failed to land at its destination. The runway is shorter than the 767 is normally able to operate from. Consequently, it overran the end of the runway which resulted in the airport being closed for a short time. A few days later it was flown  empty to Kilimanjaro International Airport.
