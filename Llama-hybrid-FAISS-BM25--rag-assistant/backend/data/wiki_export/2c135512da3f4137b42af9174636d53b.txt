The Brussels Stock Exchange (, ), abbreviated to BSE, was founded in Brussels, Belgium, by decree of Napoleon in 1801. In 2002, the BSE merged with the Amsterdam, Lisbon and Paris stock exchanges into Euronext, renaming the BSE Euronext Brussels. The most well known stock market index on the BSE is the BEL20.

The former Brussels Stock Exchange building (, ), usually shortened to  or , is located on the Place de la Bourse/Beursplein along the Boulevard Anspach/Anspachlaan. This area is served by the premetro (underground tram) station Bourse/Beurse on lines 3 and 4.

History

Inception and construction
Created in 1801 by decree of Napoleon, the Stock Exchange () established in Brussels successively occupied different premises. From 1858, a time when it experienced considerable development following the country's economic and industrial growth, the cramped and unsanitary conditions of the various premises led the business community to demand, from the municipal authorities, the erection of a new stock exchange.

Following the covering of the river Senne for health and aesthetic reasons between 1867 and 1871, a massive programme of beautification of Brussels' city centre was undertaken. Having become a priority in the list of works of public utility, this undertaking gave rise, at the time, to numerous proposals including that of the architect Léon-Pierre Suys which, as part of his proposal to construct a series of grand boulevards in the river's place, designed a stock exchange building to become the centre of the rapidly expanding business sector. Supported by several petitions, Suys' proposal won the support of the municipal council.

The Brussels Stock Exchange (BSE) building was erected from 1868 to 1873, halfway down the newly created Boulevard Anspach/Anspachlaan (then called the /), on the site of the former Butter Market (, ), itself built over the remains of the 13th-century Recollets Franciscan convent. The building was inaugurated with a large ball in the presence of King Leopold II, his wife Queen Marie Henriette, and his brother Prince Philippe, Count of Flanders. In parallel to these works, a large square, called the Place de la Bourse/Beursplein, was created in front of the building.

Renovations and fire
Over the years, the Stock Exchange building underwent many renovations. Between 1930 and 1950, it was decided to increase the usable area and the incidence of light. On that occasion, a third floor was added and the central side walls on the / and the / were opened up. The load-bearing parts of the building were also reinforced with reinforced concrete to support these renovations.

During the night from Thursday 29 to Friday 30 November 1990, a fire broke out in one of the stockbrokers' cabins on the ground floor of the building, causing a lot of damage. As a result, the BSE risked losing its financial activities and its reason for existence. Though the building was neatly restored, automation and acquisitions were already bringing an end to old market practices. In July 1996, all market floor activities disappeared. That year, the cash market was fully digitalised and the daily meeting of stockbrokers and traders therefore became redundant.

Mergers, relocation and current usage

In 1999, a first merger took place with CIK and BELFOX (BELgian Futures and Options Exchange). On 22 September 2000, the BSE merged again with Paris Bourse, Lisbon Stock Exchange and the stock exchanges of Amsterdam, to form Euronext, the first pan-European exchange for equities and derivatives, with common trading and clearing of all products, and was renamed Euronext Brussels. In 2015, this company moved away from the Stock Exchange building, which had become too large, after the lease was broken by the City of Brussels in 2012.

The vacated space was then occasionally opened to house temporary exhibitions of the City of Brussels. In the meantime, a competition was held about repurposing the Stock Exchange building. Renovations started in 2020 and plans were made to reopen the building as a museum of Belgian beer. The winning design by Robbrecht & Daem, Baneton-Garrino and Popoff provided new space in the top two floors for the museum. The roof was converted into a panoramic bar with terrace, covered by a brass awning. After three years of renovations, the Belgian Beer World museum was opened in September 2023.

Building
The former Brussels Stock Exchange building does not have a distinct name, though it is usually called the  in French or the  in Dutch (or simply /, respectively), meaning "Stock Exchange Palace". It is located on the Boulevard Anspach/Anspachlaan, and is the namesake of the Place de la Bourse/Beursplein, which is, after the Grand-Place/Grote Markt, the second most important square in Brussels.

Exterior
The eclectic building, inspired by Palladian architecture, mixes borrowings from the neo-Renaissance and Second Empire styles. It has an abundance of ornaments and sculptures, created by famous artists, including the brothers Jacques and Jean-Joseph Jacquet, the French sculptor Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse and his then-assistant Auguste Rodin. Some of the best examples are the group of four allegorical figures on the façade by Guillaume de Groot, symbolising Art, Agriculture, Industry and Science, as well as the friezes by Carrier-Belleuse, in which Rodin may have contributed.

Towards the boulevard, the two allegorical lion sculptures by Jacquet on each side of the main entrance's monumental staircase (one with its head facing up, the other curved back) represent the two symbolic stock market trends (akin to the famous "bull and bear" metaphor), as well as the Belgian Nation. They are accompanied by a genius with a torch by the same sculptor.

Interior

The interior, inspired by Palladian plans, is a cruciform vessel supported by four monumental piers against which are attached Corinthian columns. The inside pediment includes four caryatids by Antoine Joseph Van Rasbourgh, symbolising Protection, Trade, Art and Victory. The original light fixture supports were supplied at the time by the Compagnie des Bronzes de Bruxelles.
