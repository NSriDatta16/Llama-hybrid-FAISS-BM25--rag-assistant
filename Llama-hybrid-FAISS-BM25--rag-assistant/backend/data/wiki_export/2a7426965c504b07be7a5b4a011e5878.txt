An akshauhini ( akṣauhiṇī) is described in the Mahabharata (Adi Parva 2.15-23) as a battle formation consisting of 21,870 chariots (Sanskrit ratha); 21,870 elephants (Sanskrit gaja); 65,610 horses (Sanskrit turaga) and 109,350 infantry (Sanskrit pada sainyam). Thus one akshauhini consisted of 218,700 warriors (not including the charioteers, who didn't fight). The ratio is 1 chariot : 1 elephant : 3 cavalry : 5 infantry soldiers. In each of these large number groups (65,610, etc.), the digits add up to 18.

It is mentioned in the Mahabharata that in the Kurukshetra War the Pandava army consisted of seven akshauhinis (1,530,900 warriors), and the Kaurava army had eleven akshauhinis (2,405,700 warriors).

Composition

Patti (company)            :                  1 Elephant (Gaja) + 1 Chariot (Ratha) + 3 Horse (Ashwa) + 5 Foot Soldiers (Padati)=10 Warriors
Senamukha = (3 x Patti)    :                  3 Elephant +     3 Chariot +     9 Horse +     15 Foot Soldiers = 30 Warriors
Gulma = (3 x Senamukha)    :                  9 Elephant +     9 Chariot +    27 Horse +     45 Foot Soldiers = 90 Warriors
Gana = (3 x Gulma)         :                 27 Elephant +    27 Chariot +    81 Horse +    135 Foot Soldiers = 270 Warriors
Wahini = (3 x Gana)        :                 81 Elephant +    81 Chariot +   243 Horse +    405 Foot Soldiers = 810 Warriors
Pritana/Prutana = (3 x Wahini) :            243 Elephant +   243 Chariot +   729 Horse +   1215 Foot Soldiers = 2,430 Warriors
Chamu = (3 x Pritana/Prutana)  :            729 Elephant +   729 Chariot +  2187 Horse +   3645 Foot Soldiers = 7,290 Warriors
Anikini = (3 x Chamu)          :           2187 Elephant +  2187 Chariot +  6561 Horse +  10935 Foot Soldiers = 21,870 Warriors
Akshauhini = (10 x Anikini)    :        21870 Elephant + 21870 Chariot + 65610 Horse + 109350 Foot Soldiers = 218,700 Warriors
