Sports Writing

After 23 years with The Journal, with most of that tenure covering the Red Sox beat, he left to take a similar position with The Herald in October 2008.

Since 2004, Sean has also been a guest analyst during Red Sox pregame and discussion shows on NESN, the team's satellite channel. On April 10, 2009, he filled for the ill Jerry Remy as a color commentator, working in the NESN booth alongside Don Orsillo for the first two innings of Boston's 6–3 loss to the Los Angeles Angels in Anaheim, California.
