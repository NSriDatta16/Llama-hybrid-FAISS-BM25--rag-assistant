John Jones Milligan (December 10, 1795 â€“ April 20, 1875) was an American lawyer and politician from Wilmington, in New Castle County, Delaware. He was a member of the Whig Party, who served as United States Representative from Delaware.

Political career
Milligan served eight years representing Delaware in the U.S. House of Representatives. Elected as an Anti-Jacksonian in 1830, he became a member of the Whig Party when it was organized and served from March 4, 1831 until March 3, 1839. Having been defeated for reelection to a fifth term, he was appointed Associate Judge of the Delaware Superior Court on September 19, 1839 and served until September 16, 1864, when he retired.

Death and legacy
Milligan died at his retirement home in Philadelphia and is buried in the Wilmington and Brandywine Cemetery at Wilmington.

Milligan is described in the Diaries of Edmund Canby as follows: "...(he)...is a beautiful speaker, his manner is fine, gestures good, matter well arranged, distinct and clear- certainly one of the most delightful speakers I have ever heard...Milligan would be a splendid speaker with practice...he has many happy hits and some beautiful classical illusions...He is, I am told, a fine classical scholar."
