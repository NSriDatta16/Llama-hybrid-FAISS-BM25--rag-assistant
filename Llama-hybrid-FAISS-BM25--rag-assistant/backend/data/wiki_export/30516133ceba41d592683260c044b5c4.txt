Nepenthes lavicola (; from Latin: lavicola growing upon lava) is a tropical pitcher plant species endemic to the Geureudong Massif of Aceh, northern Sumatra, where it grows at 2000–2600 m above sea level. It is thought to be most closely related to N. singalana and N. spectabilis.

Nepenthes lavicola is notable for its very prominent bracts, which often overarch the flowers and may be up to 7 cm long at the base of female inflorescences. This species is also unusual in that it bears up to two bracts per pedicel or partial peduncle.

Swiss botanist Albert Friedrich Frey-Wyssling mentioned N. lavicola in a 1931 article as an unidentified Nepenthes species.

Nepenthes lavicola has no known natural hybrids. No forms or varieties have been described.
