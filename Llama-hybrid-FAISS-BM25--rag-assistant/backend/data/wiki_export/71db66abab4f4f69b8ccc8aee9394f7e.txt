History
In Greek and Roman times there was a town here named Midelle. Throughout history, the town was controlled by several kingdoms, such as the Seljuk Turks and Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia. Following the arrival of the Turks in the area the name was changed to Çeceli and inhabited by the Yüreğir and Menemencioğulları and  Ramazanoğulları tribes.

Between 1481 and 1496 the town was controlled by the Mamluk Sultanate and once it was defeated by the Ottoman sultan Selim I, he left the control of the town to the Ramazanoğulları dynasty as a vassal state. The current name Karaisalı was later given in memory of a Ramazanoğulları lord. Right before his death in 1520 however, Selim I decided to formally annex the town and the surrounding region into the Ottoman Empire.

The town was not occupied by the Allies during the Turkish War of Independence in the early 1920s and became a centre of Turkish resistance against the Allies for the Çukurova area.
