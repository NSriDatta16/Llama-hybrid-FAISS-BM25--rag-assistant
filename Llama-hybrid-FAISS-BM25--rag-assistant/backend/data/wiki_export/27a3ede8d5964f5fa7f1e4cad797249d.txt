The highway's southern terminus is with State Route 12 and State Route 29 outside the southeast corner of the city, and its northern terminus is at State Route 121 inside the city. SR 221 forms part of the Napa-Vallejo Highway with SR 29.

Route description
Route 221 is the northernmost part of the Napa-Vallejo Highway. It is a divided four-lane expressway that serves as an alternate to the nearby Route 29 freeway into Napa from the south. Unlike Route 29, however, 221 provides direct access to Napa Valley College and Napa State Hospital. The southern terminus is with Route 29 (which also carries Route 12), where it continues as the Napa-Vallejo Highway. The northern terminus is an intersection with Route 121, where 121 continues north as Soscol Avenue.

SR 221 is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration.
