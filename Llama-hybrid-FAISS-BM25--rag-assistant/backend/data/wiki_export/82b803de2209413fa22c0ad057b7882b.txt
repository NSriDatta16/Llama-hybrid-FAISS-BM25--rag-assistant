"Hot Stuff" is a song by American singer Donna Summer from her seventh studio album  Bad Girls (1979), produced by English producer Pete Bellotte and Italian producer Giorgio Moroder and released as the lead single from Bad Girls in 1979 through Casablanca Records. Up to that point, Summer had mainly been associated with disco songs but this song also showed a significant rock direction, including a guitar solo by ex-Doobie Brother and Steely Dan guitarist Jeff "Skunk" Baxter. It is the second of four songs by Summer to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100.

In 2018, a remix by Ralphi Rosario and Erick Ibiza entitled "Hot Stuff 2018" went to number one on the US Dance Club Songs chart.

Reception
Billboard claimed that "Hot Stuff" has a "strong R&B, soulish feel" along with a "fiery" vocal performance from Summer.  Cash Box said that the song "has an exciting newness to its rock/disco sound" with "power guitar chording, interesting synthesizer lines and unusual Summer vocal." Record World called it a "splendid rock disco tune."

Awards and legacy
"Hot Stuff" won Summer the Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance in the inaugural year the award was given out. 

In 2010, the song was ranked No. 104 on Rolling Stones list of "The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time".

Chart performance
"Hot Stuff" was certified Platinum by the RIAA and remained at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for three non-consecutive weeks, and spent the longest time in the top ten in 1979: fourteen weeks. The song also topped the US Dance Club Songs chart, with Summer's follow-up "Bad Girls" as a double A-side. "Hot Stuff" was the seventh biggest song of 1979 in the US.
