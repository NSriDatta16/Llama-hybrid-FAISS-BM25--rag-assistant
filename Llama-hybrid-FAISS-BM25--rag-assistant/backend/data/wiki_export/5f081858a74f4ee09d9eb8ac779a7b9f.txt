New York State Route 322 (NY 322) is a state highway in the Southern Tier of New York in the United States. The western terminus of the route is at an intersection with NY 83 in Balcom Corners, a hamlet within the Chautauqua County town of Villenova. Its eastern terminus is at a junction with U.S. Route 62 (US 62) in the Cattaraugus County town of Dayton. In between, the route passes through the village of South Dayton.

NY 322 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to its current alignment. Originally, maintenance of the Cattaraugus County portion of the route was split between the village of South Dayton and the county, the latter of which co-designated the highway as County Route 3 (CR 3). The state of New York assumed ownership and maintenance of the Cattaraugus County segment in 1980 as part of a highway maintenance swap between the state, the county, and South Dayton.

History

NY 322 was assigned to its modern alignment as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. Initially, NY 322 was maintained by Cattaraugus County between the eastern village limits of South Dayton and its junction with NY 241 (now US 62) in Dayton and by the village of South Dayton within the village limits. The Cattaraugus County-maintained portion of the route was co-designated as CR 3. On April 1, 1980, ownership and maintenance of NY 322 in Cattaraugus County was transferred from the village of South Dayton and the county to the state of New York as part of a highway maintenance swap between the three levels of government. The entirety of the route is now state-maintained.
