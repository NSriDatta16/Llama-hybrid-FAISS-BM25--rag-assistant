The Renault Fluence is a compact sedan produced by the French automaker Renault. The car was produced until 2016 at the Oyak-Renault plant in Bursa, Turkey. It was produced until the end of 2018 in Santa Isabel, Argentina, for the Latin American market. Its electric version is still produced in Busan, South Korea, for the market of the Asia-Pacific.

On 12 July 2016, Renault unveiled the successor to the Fluence, initially for the market of Europe, the Mégane Sedan IV.

Design 

Revealed in August 2009, the Fluence is based on the Renault/Nissan C platform, but it is sized between the compact family saloon C segment, and the upper medium segment.

The Mégane range featured a "three box" notchback sedan variant until the end of 2008, but this was never a big seller and when, at the end of that year, the Mégane III was introduced, there was no notchback version available.

The gap in the range left by the removal of the saloon model from the FrancoSpanish assembled Mégane range was filled by the Fluence in markets such as France, Italy, Belgium, Ireland and - from August 2010, Germany.

The Renault Fluence is also badged as Renault Samsung SM3. The Renault Samsung car was first presented at the Seoul Motor Show in April 2009, and the rebadged Renault Fluence went on sale in November 2009. The model has first been offered with two petrol engines: a 1.6 litre  and a two-litre  that can get an optional CVT.

The diesel variant is equipped with a 1.5 litre dCi engine, offered in , ,  and  versions, fitted with Diesel particulate filter, and the  version can be fitted with Renault's new dual clutch transmission, called EDC (Efficient Dual Clutch).

Fluence GT 

In November 2012, Renault presented a new version of the Fluence in partnership with engineers from Renault Sport from France, as well as engineers from Brazil and Argentina.

The project focus was to offer the first Renault Sport product developed out of France to enthusiasts and customers who were looking for something more than the available mid-range sedans until that date for Brazil and Argentina markets, notably customers who were willing to have more performance without compromising final price budget.

Based on the Privilège version, with all equipment and options, the GT version received special attention to suspension (springs and dampers) and the same engine and gearbox offered in the Megane GT for Europe. The engine is commercially designated TCe180 (Turbo Control Efficiency), which refers to the 2.0F4Rt engine family tuned with  at 5500 rpm and  of torque at 2250 rpm.

The engine has a displacement of 1998 cc, with a bore of 82.7 mm and stroke of 93 mm. Compression ratio is 9,5:1. It features sequential multipoint fuel injection. The engine weighs approx.  and has pistons, linking rods and crankshaft reinforced, nitrile-cooled exhaust valves. The turbo is a Mitsubishi TD04-10T, wastegate twin-scroll unit to reduce lag.

The gearbox is a Pk4 17, six speed manual, three shaft synchronized, hydraulic actuated unit that weighs . The interior received a digital speedometer, leather sport seats and aluminium pedals.

It was produced from November 2012 until July 2014 in the project of Phase 1. Later, there was a project Phase 2 designated Fluence GT2, but it was only offered in Argentina. There are three external colours available: "Branco Glacier" (solid), "Vermelho Fogo" and "Preto Nacré" (both metallic). It can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph), in eight seconds and top speed is limited to .

Concept 

In 2004, Renault presented a 2+2 concept coupé, named Fluence and designed by then Renault chief designer Patrick le Quément, with a length similar to that of the Renault Laguna. It was shown on June 4, 2004, at the Louis Vuitton Car Elegance Classic in England, and at the Mondial de l'Automobile 2004.

The Fluence uses Valeo LED headlights that are angled according to the steering wheel position. An ingenious aspect of the Fluence's exterior design is its V shaped rear that gives access to the trunk in an unconventional way; an articulated piston mounted in the centre of the trunk lid slides the back up into the roof. The inside of the trunk is upholstered with "Margaux Red" cloth and has a volume of 396 dm³.

In the interior, every seat is fixed to a single rail; the arm rests on the doors are also fixed to a rail, and are enclosed to the adjustment of the seats. The dashboard is similar to the one of the Renault Talisman. It has a joystick so the driver can access different functions of the vehicle and view them on a retractable LCD screen.

Several brands, including Michelin and Recaro, were involved with the development of the Fluence. Michelin contributed tires with PAX technology (similar to Runflat), BS tooling manufactured the 22 inch aerodynamic alloy wheels, and Recaro developed the seats.
