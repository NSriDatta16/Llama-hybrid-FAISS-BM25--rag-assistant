State legislature
She was appointed to the legislature on November 26, 1997 to replace Ron Withem, who had resigned. She was elected in 1998 to represent the 14th Nebraska legislative district and reelected in 2002.  She sat on the Appropriations, Executive Board, and Reference committees as well as being the vice chairperson of the Rules and the chairperson of the Building Maintenance committees.  Since Nebraska voters passed Initiative Measure 415 in 2001 limiting state senators to two terms after 2001, she was unable to run for reelection barring a court challenge of the measure.
