"Everybody in the Place" is the second official single released by the British electronic dance band the Prodigy from their debut album, Experience (1992). It was released on 23 December 1991 through XL Recordings in the UK.

The single features the "Fairground Remix" version of the song. The version on the album is the "155 & Rising Version", which is significantly longer and faster in beats per minute than the original mix featured on the What Evil Lurks EP.

The single peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart, beaten to number one by the re-release of Queen's "Bohemian Rhapsody" following the death of Freddie Mercury.

The original CD single was released with five tracks, which went against British chart regulations. The track "Rip Up the Sound System" was removed on the re-issue to comply with the chart regulations, but is still available on the 12" vinyl. The cover features a photograph of the now dismantled Corkscrew roller coaster at Alton Towers.

The song was released six months later on 18 June 1992 as a double A-side with first single "Charly" through Elektra Records in the United States. The single is featured on the band's greatest hits compilation Their Law: The Singles 1990â€“2005.

Music video
The accompanying music video was shot in September 1991 during a trip to New York, during which they also played at the Limelight Club. It features the band dancing in a fast-paced succession of short shots. The video ends with the band appearing to be pursued by the police but escaping.
