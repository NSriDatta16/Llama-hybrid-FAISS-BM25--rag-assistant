Allegations of plagiarism 
Pritam has been alleged to have plagiarized numerous songs from the beginning of his film music career. Hits such as "Pehli Nazar Mein" was plagiarized from the Korean song "Sarang Hae Yo" by Kim Hyung Su (2005). His critically acclaimed soundtrack Ae Dil Hai Mushkil also faced allegations of plagiarism as the guitar riff of the song "Bulleya" was lifted from the Papa Roach song "Last Resort".

Rolling Stone India says, Indian music plagiarism tracking site www.itwofs.com alleges 52 instances between 2004 and 2010 where Pritam's songs are said to be "lifted", "copied", "plagiarized", or "similar" to those of tunes by other composers, who range from Arab and East Asian artists (such as Ihab Tawfik, Yuri Mrakadi and Kim Hyung-sub) to Western musicians like Boney M. and Damien Rice. Especially famous songs of Pritam, like "Tikhi Tikhi", "Allah Duhai Hain" and some others were found to be copied or plagiarised from Turkish famous singer Tarkan.

In an interview with Hindustan Times, Pritam commented on the allegations of plagiarism in his music, "Yes, I did make mistakes initially. But once I realised it, I have been particular about my music. However, people keep making false allegations, because it's easy to do that. Since the last three years, I have stopped taking false allegations seriously. For example, the Iranian band that said I had plagiarised 'Pungi' (Agent Vinod; 2012) had to give an apology in court for using my name falsely.".
