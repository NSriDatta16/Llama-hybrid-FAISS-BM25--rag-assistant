History
Before its creation, the territory where Beauceville currently sit was known as Saint-François-de-la-Beauce. The actual city of Beauceville was formed in 1904 by splitting from the municipality of Saint-François. It will lose some of its territory in 1930 for the creation of the city of Beauceville-Est but this city will merge back with Beauceville in 1973. It will finally gain significant territories in 1998 by annexing the neighbouring municipalities of Saint-François-de-Beauce (the same municipality from which Beauceville originally splitted from) and Saint-François-Ouest. Throughout its history, Beauceville has suffered from the many spring overflows of the Chaudière River, causing great damage. In the spring, the water rose several times until it covered the streets of the municipality.

In recent years, Beauceville has been marked by economic prosperity: The municipality has more than 25 manufacturing companies. The industrial park is in full expansion and welcomes many new companies.
