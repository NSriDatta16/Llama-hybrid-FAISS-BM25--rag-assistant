Plot Summary
In the second novel of Princess Diaries, Mia must learn to deal with the public and reporters, beginning with a primetime interview Mia is instructed to attend by her Grand-mère, despite Mia's protests. When Mia gets sick, she thinks that the interview will be cancelled, but she is enticed out of her sickbed by the notion of a "secret admirer," and cannot avoid the interview.

During the interview itself, says a number of embarrassing things, including that her mother is pregnant with the baby of her boyfriend, Mr. Gianini (who is also Mia's algebra teacher). The pregnancy revealed, Mia's mother asks Mr. Gianni to marry her. Grandmère organizes for the Royal Genovian Event Planner to be flown to New York from Genovia to plan an elaborate, elitist wedding. Mia has to deal with the unwanted attention brought on by the interview, along with the knowledge that a secret admirer has been sending her emails under the name of JoCrox.

On the day of the wedding, Mia discovers that her mom and Mr. Gianini have eloped in Mexico with the help of her father. Mia herself manages to escape the wedding extravaganza in her bridesmaid gown to attend the Halloween screening of The Rocky Horror Picture Show with her friends, where she discovers that her secret admirer is her biology partner Kenny Showalter. Mia is disappointed, as she has been hoping that it would be Michael, her own crush, and Lilly's (her best friend's) older brother.

The book ends with Mia philosophically reflecting that what doesn't kill us makes us stronger, and that she cannot hurt
Kenny's feelings and accepts a date with him.
