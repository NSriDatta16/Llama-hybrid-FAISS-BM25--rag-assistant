History
On August 6, 2004, HTB Canada Inc. was granted approval from the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to launch a television channel called HTB Canada, described as "a national, ethnic Category 2 Russian-language specialty television service. The applicant proposed to offer a programming service targeting the Russian-speaking community, although 10% of all programming would be in the English language".

The channel launched in January 2006 as NTV Canada on Rogers Cable.

On August 30, 2013, the CRTC approved HTB Canada Inc.'s request to convert NTV Canada from a licensed Category B specialty service to an exempted Cat. B third language service.

In November 2015, the channel ceased operations, and no announcement was made about the pending shut down. As such the official day it ceased operations is currently unknown.
