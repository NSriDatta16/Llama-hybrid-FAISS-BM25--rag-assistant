Plot
An American Freemason who has been listening to a racist and bigoted rabble-rouser, who is preaching hate speech against ethnic and religious minorities and immigrants, is warned off by a naturalized Hungarian immigrant, possibly a Holocaust survivor or escapee, who explains to him how such rhetoric and demagoguery allowed the Nazis to rise to power in Weimar Germany, and warns Americans not to fall for similar demagoguery propagated by American racists and bigots.

In popular culture
In August 2017, the short film went viral on the internet in the aftermath of the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and various copies have been uploaded to video-sharing sites since then.
