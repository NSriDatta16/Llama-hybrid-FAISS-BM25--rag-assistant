Galaxy novels, sometimes titled Galaxy Science Fiction Novels, were a series of mostly reprint American science fiction novels published between 1950 and 1961.

The series was started by H.L. Gold, the editor of Galaxy Science Fiction, in 1950 as a companion to the main Galaxy magazine. There was one (often abridged) novel per issue, which appeared in digest size format, which made the books in the series look like digest magazines.

In 1959, after 35 issues, the series was sold to Beacon Books, which changed the format to mass-market (small size) paperback and introduced its own numbering scheme, continuing the series for another 11 issues. They also had the contents of some books revised to add mild sexual content and changed their titles accordingly.

Publication details
The official publisher of Galaxy novels was World Editions, Inc. for issues 1 through 7 and Galaxy Publishing Corp. for issues 8 through 46. Both were based in New York City. Issues 1 through 23, 32, 33, and then 35 through 46 were published as Galaxy Science Fiction Novel while issues 24 through 31 and 34 were published as Galaxy Novel. Fred Pohl, who was editor of Galaxy Publishing Co. from 1960-1969, stated in 1967 that the book series showed a loss of $30,000 () between 1950 and 1958.
