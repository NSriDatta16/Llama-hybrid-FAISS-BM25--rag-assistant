Theodore Jasper (13 July 1814, in Prussia – 6 June 1897, in Columbus, Ohio) was a portrait painter and photographic colorist active in Columbus, Ohio from circa 1866 to 1883. From the 1840s to the 1860s he worked in New York and Connecticut (Haverstock, 2000). His paintings formed the basis for Studer's Popular Ornithology, a late 19th-century work that had several editions with chromolithographic copies of Jasper's art.
