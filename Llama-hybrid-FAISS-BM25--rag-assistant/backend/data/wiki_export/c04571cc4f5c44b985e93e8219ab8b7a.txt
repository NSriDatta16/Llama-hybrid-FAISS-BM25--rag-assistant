Giuseppe Sommaruga (1867–1917) was an Italian architect of the Liberty style or Art nouveau movement. He was the pupil of Camillo Boito and Luca Beltrami to the Brera Academy in Milan. His monumental architecture exerted some influence on the futurist architect Antonio Sant'Elia.

Some of his works:        
 Grand Hotel Campo dei Fiori in Campo dei Fiori, close to Varese (1909–1912)
 Mausoleo Faccanoni in Sarnico (1907)
 Villa Faccanoni in Sarnico
 Palazzina Salmoiraghi, Milan (destroyed)
 Palazzo Castiglioni (1901–1904) in Milan
 Villa Romeo Faccanoni (1912-1914), now part of Clinica Columbus, in Milan
