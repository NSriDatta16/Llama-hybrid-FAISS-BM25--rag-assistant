The Nightmare Room is an American children's anthology horror series that aired on Kids' WB. The series was based on the short-lived children's book series that went by the same title created by Goosebumps author, R. L. Stine. The Nightmare Room originally aired from August 31, 2001, to March 16, 2002, in the United States.

Premise
The Nightmare Room is based on fears that children have, such as ghosts and monsters, which normally ended with comments by the narrator whose final words always ended with the words "the nightmare room", then a door with The Nightmare Room logo appeared, closing. In many instances, the series resembled the television series The Twilight Zone with teens taking the role as the main characters, many of whom portrayed the characters were popular child actors at the time, including Amanda Bynes, Frankie Muniz, Justin Berfield, Drake Bell, Brenda Song, Lindsey Felton, Shia LaBeouf, Kaley Cuoco,  Dylan and Cole Sprouse. In addition, David Naughton, Robert Englund (famously known as Freddy Krueger from the Nightmare on Elm Street films), Betsy Randle, Tippi Hedren, David Carradine, and Angus Scrimm also worked on some episodes.

The Nightmare Room is one of the only two live-action shows (the other being Brats of the Lost Nebula) that ever aired on Kids' WB. The show was produced by Parachute Entertainment, Tollin/Robbins Productions, and Warner Bros. Television.

Opening narration
At the beginning of each episode, R. L. Stine gives an opening monologue of sorts — in a manner very similar to Rod Serling's iconic opening narration for The Twilight Zone — that acts somewhat like a theme song for the series.

Despite the claim of being R. L. Stine, the narration was provided by James Avery of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air fame. Avery also did the closing narration for each episode.
