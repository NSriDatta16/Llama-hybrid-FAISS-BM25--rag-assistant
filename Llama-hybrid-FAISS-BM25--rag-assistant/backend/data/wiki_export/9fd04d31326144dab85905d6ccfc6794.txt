In mathematics, the Genocchi numbers Gn, named after Angelo Genocchi, are a sequence of integers  that satisfy the relation

The first few Genocchi numbers are 0, −1, −1, 0, 1, 0, −3, 0, 17 , see .

Properties 

 The generating function definition of the Genocchi numbers implies that they are rational numbers. In fact, G2n+1 = 0 for n ≥ 1 and (−1)nG2n is an odd positive integer.
 Genocchi numbers Gn are related to Bernoulli numbers Bn by the formula

Combinatorial interpretations 

The exponential generating function for the signed even Genocchi numbers (−1)nG2n is 

They enumerate the following objects:

 Permutations in S2n−1 with descents after the even numbers and ascents after the odd numbers.
 Permutations π in S2n−2 with 1 ≤ π(2i−1) ≤ 2n−2i and 2n−2i ≤ π(2i) ≤ 2n−2.
 Pairs (a1,…,an−1) and (b1,…,bn−1) such that ai and bi are between 1 and i and every k between 1 and n−1 occurs at least once among the ai's and bi's.
 Reverse alternating permutations a1 < a2 > a3 < a4 >…>a2n−1 of [2n−1] whose inversion table has only even entries.
