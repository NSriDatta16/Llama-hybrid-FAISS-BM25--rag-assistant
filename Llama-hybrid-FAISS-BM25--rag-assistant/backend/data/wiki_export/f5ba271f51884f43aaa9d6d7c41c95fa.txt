G.S. Sharat Chandra (1935–2000) was an author of both poetry and fiction. Much of his work touches on the deep emotions of the Indian/American immigrant.

For most of his career, Chandra taught at the University of Missouri-Kansas City as a professor of Creative Writing and English (1983–2000). His most famous  work, Family of Mirrors, was a 1993 Pulitzer Prize nominee for poetry. Author of ten books, including translations from Sanskrit and English  into the Indian language Kannada , a former Fulbright Fellow and recipient of an NEA Fellowship in Creative Writing, Chandra has given readings at the Library of Congress, Oxford, and McDaid's Pub in Dublin.

Chandra traveled the world extensively throughout his life and received international recognition for both his poetry and fiction. His works have appeared in many journals including American Poetry Review, London Magazine, The Nation, and Partisan Review.

Chandra was married to his wife, Jane for 38 years until he died of a brain aneurysm in 2000. He left three children.

Sharat was a gifted teacher of creative writing.  He encouraged persistence, craft, and imagination.  He did so with humor and compassion.  As a teacher at the Mark Twain Writer's Workshop, he once read from a stack of rejection letters, which he claimed papered the walls of his writing study.  With regard to the writerly imagination, and the importance of craft, he once said:  "You can tell me anything, anything at all.  Just make me believe!"
