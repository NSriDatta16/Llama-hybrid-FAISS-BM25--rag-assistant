The Traffic Operational Command Unit (OCU), formally known as CO15, was the Road Policing Unit for the Metropolitan Police Service in Greater London, England.

On 1 December 2014, Traffic OCU was merged with the Safer Transport Command (STC), to create the new Roads and Transport Policing Command (RTPC) under the heading of MO8 (Met Operations: Section 8).

Role, responsibilities and aims

Traffic OCU's patrol officers are highly trained advanced (pursuit) drivers, motorcyclists and vehicle examiners.  All receive additional training in accident investigation with many being trained to advanced levels in forensic collision reconstruction, vehicle examination, tachograph analysis and hazardous materials enforcement. They have responsibility for the enforcement of road safety legislation, response to major incidents and incidents on motorways and the strategic road network, the complete investigation of fatal collisions, and the initial investigation of life changing Road Traffic Collisions within the MPD.

Traffic OCU Sergeants (known colloquially as "Garage Sergeants") are also responsible for the investigation of all collisions involving police vehicles.

Traffic OCU's stated aims are to:
 Deny criminals use of the roads by enforcing the law
 Reduce road casualties
 Tackle the threat of terrorism
 Reduce anti-social use of the roads
 Enhance public confidence and reassurance by patrolling the roads
 Attend and investigate all fatal collisions

In addition to general police duties and patrol, Traffic OCU officers focus particularly on offences related to antisocial and criminal use of vehicles, driving under the influence of drink or drugs, excessive speed, dangerous and careless driving, defective vehicles, commercial vehicles and the transportation of hazardous materials, and disqualified, unlicensed or uninsured drivers.

Within Traffic OCU, the Serious Collision Investigation Unit (SCIU), staffed by detectives and expert collision investigators, is responsible for the investigation of all fatal collisions within the Metropolitan Police District.  Whilst work continues to reduce the death toll, there are still in the region of 130 road traffic collision fatalities on London's roads each year - more than the number of murders.

Equipment and vehicles
Traffic OCU officers patrol both in cars and on motorcycles.

Cars used are the BMW 5 Series 530d X-Drive tourer, Volvo V90, BMW X3 4x4 and Skoda Superb estates. The command has previously used BMW X5 4x4, Mitsubishi Shogun 4x4 and Ford Mondeo Estate. Each vehicle is fitted with a mobile data terminal with access to the Police National Computer,  Automatic Number Plate Recognition and video systems.

The current solo motorcycle used is the BMW 1200RT-P although some older 1150cc and 650cc models remain. The command also utilises some BMW 750GS. Although motorcycles carry less equipment than cars, they are far more agile through traffic congestion and are essential for escorting convoys, processions and demonstrations.
