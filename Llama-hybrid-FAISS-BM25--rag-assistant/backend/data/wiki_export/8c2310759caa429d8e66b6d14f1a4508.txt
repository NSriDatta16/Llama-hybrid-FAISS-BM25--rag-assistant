Career

Ordained and Academic Ministry

Churches in Detroit and the Court Street Methodist Church in Flint.  At these downtown Detroit churches he first developed what he called a Personal Trouble Clinic.  This clinic was developed and operated in collaboration with a psychiatrist and a family visitor, and in co-operation with the Public Health Department, the Police Department, a Medical Center, and other public agencies.  Much of his subsequent writing was drawn from his experiences in that work.  Rev. Werner was lastly appointed pastor of the Grace Methodist Church located at 1029 Harvard Blvd., Dayton, Ohio.

In 1945 Werner became the Professor of Practical Theology at Drew Theological Seminary, Madison, New Jersey.  There he taught seminary students the principles of counseling and the basic truths of the emotional life. He also contributed articles on counseling and personal problems to leading religious magazines of his day.

He also was the Chairman of the General Commission on World Peace and a New world order, and was a member of the General Commission of Evangelism and the State of the Church, both of the Methodist Church.

Warner was married to the former Helen Elsea and had a son, Stewart.
