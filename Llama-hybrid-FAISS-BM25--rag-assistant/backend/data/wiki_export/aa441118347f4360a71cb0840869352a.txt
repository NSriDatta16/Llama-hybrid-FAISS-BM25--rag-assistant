José Luis Núñez Clemente (7 September 1931 – 3 December 2018), often known by the Catalanized form of his name used by the Catalan press, Josep Lluís Núñez i Clemente, was president of FC Barcelona between 1978 and 2000. He was elected club president, despite having no previous connection with the club. His main objectives were to establish Barça as a world class sports club and to give the club financial stability.

Núñez and his wife, Maria Lluïsa Navarro, once owned the Núñez i Navarro construction company and the Núñez i Navarro Hotel chain.

Presidency
Núñez oversaw one of the club's most successful eras and has been Barça's most successful president in terms of winning trophies. During his presidency, the club's four professional teams amassed 176 trophies – 30 in football, 36 in basketball, 65 in handball and 45 in roller hockey.  This included a remarkable quartet in 1999, the club's centenary year, when the four teams were all crowned champions of Spain. FC Barcelona were also European football champions in 1992.

During his presidency, FC Barcelona membership increased from 77,905 to 106,000, leading to the increase in the capacity of the Camp Nou stadium. The number of penyes (fan clubs) also increased from 96 based in Spain to over 1,300 based throughout the world. Núñez gave the club a solid economical base and increased the club's wealth. The club built the Mini Estadi in 1982, opened the FC Barcelona Museum in 1984, expanded the Palau Blaugrana to a capacity of 8,500, bought the land where Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper would be established, and opened the La Masia, a residence for young players.

Hesperia Mutiny
Núñez was re-elected twice without opposition, but in 1988 he had to face the players rebellion known as the Hesperia Mutiny (named after the hotel where the players reunited), which ended with the dismissal of almost all the team (14 out of the 26 players and the coach). Afterward, he hired Johan Cruyff as coach, and the club saw the golden era of the Dream Team, which won the club's first European Cup in 1992. In 1989, he won the re-election against rival Sixte Cambra, and was again re-elected without opposition in 1993. The next year, he started the F.C. Barcelona Foundation, to prevent the conversion of the club to a private-owned sporting society, per the new Spanish law.

Disagreements with Cruyff forced the coach's dismissal, and since then Núñez had to face the open opposition led by the former coach. In 1997, he was reelected for the last time, winning against rival Ángel Fernández. Months later, he survived a vote of no-confidence instigated by opponent platform "L'Elefant Blau", one of whose leaders, Joan Laporta, would become the club's president several years later.

He hired first Bobby Robson and then Louis van Gaal as coaches. But the lack of titles in van Gaal's third year and his lack of understanding with the fans forced his dismissal, and that of Núñez himself, tired of being pressured. In 2000, he resigned after 22 years as club president.

Criticism
Despite his achievements, Núñez was not always popular. His refusal to pay high wages gained him many critics and saw the departure of players like Diego Maradona, Ronaldo, Bernd Schuster, Hristo Stoichkov and Luís Figo.
