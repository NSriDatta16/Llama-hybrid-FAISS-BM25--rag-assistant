Helen Lynch (April 6, 1900 â€“ March 2, 1965) was an American silent film actress, mainly known for her roles playing gun molls and other morally dubious characters.

Biography
Lynch was born in 1900 in Billings, Montana, where she was also raised. When she was one year old, her father died, and Lynch was raised along with her sister, Agnes, by their mother, Christian Fraser. When she was 9 years old, the family relocated to Hollywood, California, which at the time was a small suburb of Los Angeles situated amongst orchards. 

After working as a film extra, Lynch was chosen as one of thirteen WAMPAS Baby Stars in 1923. During her career, she was mostly cast in comedies, and often portrayed gun molls and other controversial female characters.

She acted in a number of films throughout the 1920s and four small roles in the 1930s. It appears she returned one last time to the screen in the 1940 film Women Without Names.

She was married to actor Carroll Nye.

Lynch died in 1965 in Miami Beach, Florida.
