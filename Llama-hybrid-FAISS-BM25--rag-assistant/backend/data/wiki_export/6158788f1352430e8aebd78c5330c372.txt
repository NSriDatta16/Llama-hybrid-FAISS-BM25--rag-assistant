Orelia () or its variants Orelious, Ornellas, Orellana, Orellia, Ortelius or Orelias is a feminine name primarily found in Europe, Mediterranean countries and South America. Deriving from the Latin Aurelius family meaning "golden". Although not exceedingly common in America, the name Orelia has been present since the 1800s. The last name "Orelias" and its various spellings, however, are not common and have decreased or virtually gone non-extant or extinct since the mid-1800s due to marriage. The name has been documented in Spain, Haiti, Brazil, America, and South Africa.  

The name Orellana is a habitational name from either of two places in Badajoz province, probably so called from Latin villa Aureliana meaning 'estate of Aurelius'.
