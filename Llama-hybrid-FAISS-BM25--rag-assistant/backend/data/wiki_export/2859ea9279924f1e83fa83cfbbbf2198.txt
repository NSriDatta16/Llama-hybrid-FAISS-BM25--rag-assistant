The European Chamber Music Academy (ECMA) was founded in 2004 on the initiative of Hatto Beyerle. Four conservatories and two music festivals, led by the Hochschule fur Musik und Theater Hannover, came together as founding members:
 the Fondazione Scuola di Musica di Fiesole (Italy),
 the Hochschule f체r Musik und Theater Hannover (Germany),
 the Universit채t f체r Musik und darstellende Kunst Vienna (Austria),
 the Hochschule f체r Musik und Theater Zurich (Switzerland),
 the Pablo Casals Festival in Prades (France)
 the Kuhmo Chamber Music Festival (Finland).

The ECMA students are young, professionally oriented string quartets and
piano trios aiming to embark on a career as chamber musicians. The ECMA
exists specifically to promote these careers through theoretical and
practical tuition, as well as through concrete job preparation (marketing,
coaching etc.).
