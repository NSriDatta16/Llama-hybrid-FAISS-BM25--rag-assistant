Flash (1969) is an album by Moving Sidewalks, Billy Gibbons' band prior to forming ZZ Top a year after its release. The Sidewalks' music was more in line with the psychedelic rock movement rather than the blues rock sound ZZ Top would be famous for. It was re-released in 2000 with bonus tracks and again in 2022 on both vinyl and CD. It was recorded in the band's hometown of Houston at Gold Star Recording Studio, later renamed Sugar Hill Recording Studios.
