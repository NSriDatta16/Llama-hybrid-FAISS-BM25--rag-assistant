Plot

Three unmarried sisters live in a remote village in Himachal Pradesh
with their old mother, Jugni (Waheeda Rehman), a former nautanki (folk theatre) dancer, who sells spices and takes in boarders to make a living. The three daughters are named like flavors in food. The 'salty' eldest daughter Nimki (Sharmila Tagore), quietly but firmly holds the household together. The 'sweet' middle sister is Mitthu (Shabana Azmi), an intelligent and romantic girl, unable to speak. The 'tangy' youngest one is Chinki (Kiran Vairale), a bold and vibrant teenager, who turns out to be very perceptive. Their quiet little haven is occasionally threatened by the alcoholic father Kishanlal (Ram Mohan), a sarangi player from the travelling troupe, who keeps trying to reclaim his daughters. Jugni would have left him years ago to protect her daughters from the life of a nautanki dancer which she had always struggled to escape.

The four women live in a very old house outside the village. Gerulal (Sanjeev Kumar) is a truck driver who joins this peculiar household for a brief time as a tenant. Initially stunned by their non-social ways, watching the grit with which they struggle through their difficulties, he is filled with respect for them. Despite the crisis they face in terms of money and facilities, all three sisters maintaining their moral values and dignified behavior. He begins to like Nimki. Mitthu, whom he sympathizes with, develops feelings for Gerulal. When Gerulal needs to move on from that region because of work, he proposes to Nimki. She turns down his proposal citing the responsibility of her sisters and her mother, and suggests he marry Mithu instead. Gerulal is unable to comply with her request.
