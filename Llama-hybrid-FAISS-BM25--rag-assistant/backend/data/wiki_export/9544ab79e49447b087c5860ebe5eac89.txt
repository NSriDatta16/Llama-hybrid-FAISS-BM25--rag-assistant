In mathematics, Darboux's theorem is a theorem in real analysis, named after Jean Gaston Darboux. It states that every function that results from the differentiation of another function has the intermediate value property: the image of an interval is also an interval.

When ƒ is continuously differentiable (ƒ in C1([a,b])), this is a consequence of the intermediate value theorem. But even when ƒ′ is not continuous, Darboux's theorem places a severe restriction on what it can be.

Darboux's theorem
Let  be a closed interval,  be a real-valued differentiable function. Then  has the intermediate value property: If  and  are points in  with , then for every  between  and , there exists an  in  such that .

Proofs
Proof 1. The first proof is based on the extreme value theorem.

If  equals  or , then setting  equal to  or , respectively, gives the desired result. Now assume that  is strictly between  and , and in particular that . Let   such that . If it is the case that  we adjust our below proof, instead asserting that  has its minimum on .

Since  is continuous on the closed interval , the maximum value of  on  is attained at some point in , according to the extreme value theorem.

Because , we know  cannot attain its maximum value at . (If it did, then  for all , which implies .)

Likewise, because , we know  cannot attain its maximum value at .

Therefore,  must attain its maximum value at some point . Hence, by Fermat's theorem, , i.e. .

Proof 2. The second proof is based on combining the mean value theorem and the intermediate value theorem.

Define .
For  define  and .
And for  define  and .

Thus, for  we have .
Now, define   with .
 is continuous in .

Furthermore,  when  and  when ; therefore, from the Intermediate Value Theorem, if  then, there exists  such that .
Let's fix .

From the Mean Value Theorem, there exists a point  such that .
Hence, .

Darboux function
A Darboux function is a real-valued function ƒ which has the "intermediate value property": for any two values a and b in the domain of ƒ, and any y between ƒ(a) and ƒ(b), there is some c between a and b with ƒ(c) = y.  By the intermediate value theorem, every continuous function on a real interval is a Darboux function. Darboux's contribution was to show that there are discontinuous Darboux functions.

Every discontinuity of a Darboux function is essential, that is, at any point of discontinuity, at least one of the left hand and right hand limits does not exist.

An example of a Darboux function that is discontinuous at one point is the topologist's sine curve function:

By Darboux's theorem, the derivative of any differentiable function is a Darboux function. In particular, the derivative of the function  is a Darboux function even though it is not continuous at one point.

An example of a Darboux function that is nowhere continuous is the Conway base 13 function.

Darboux functions are a quite general class of functions. It turns out that any real-valued function ƒ on the real line can be written as the sum of two Darboux functions. This implies in particular that the class of Darboux functions is not closed under addition.

A strongly Darboux function is one for which the image of every (non-empty) open interval is the whole real line.  The Conway base 13 function is again an example.
