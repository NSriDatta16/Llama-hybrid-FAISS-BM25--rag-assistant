Career

1984–1992

Taylor began singing at the age of 5 and performing professionally when she started her career on the television program Perth's Young Entertainers at the age of 13 in 1984. At the age of 15 she released a music video Running For Our Lives and in 1988 joined a band named Street Cafe and played regularly around Perth. Taylor moved to Melbourne in 1989 and recorded a demo tape, which found its way into the hands of Molly Meldrum, who signed her to Melodian Records. When Taylor signed her record contract Meldrum suggested she change her name to Jo Beth as Joanne "wasn't good".

In 1990, Taylor toured with Indecent Obsession as the support act for Debbie Gibson. After becoming friends, Gibson invited Taylor to go to New York City, where she then lived for a year. During this time Gibson wrote and produced five tracks on Taylor's debut album 99 Reasons. While in New York Taylor also worked with Jelly Benetez who produced five tracks on her album.

Taylor moved back to Australia and released her first single "99 Reasons" in 1991.  The song hit the Australian Top 40, peaking at No. 31 and spending 9 weeks in the Top 50. Taylor's debut album was also titled 99 Reasons, however it failed to reach the top 100. "You Don't Own Me" was released as the second and final single from the album and was not a commercial success, charting at No. 137 on the ARIA Chart. Taylor was nominated for Best New Talent at the ARIA Awards in 1992.

1993–1997

In February 1993, Taylor took over the hosting role of the top-rating Nine Network program Australia's Funniest Home Video Show.

1996 saw Taylor make a brief return to music with the release of "I Love My Dog", a single for the 101 Dalmatians Movie soundtrack; reaching No. 95 on the ARIA chart. During this time, Taylor hosted a number of specials for the Nine Network, including the Vision for a Better World Telethon and the 40 Years of Television special which was filmed on the set of Taylor's sometime day job, What's Up Doc?.

In mid-1997 Taylor's time as host on Funniest Home Videos and co-host on Hey Hey came to an abrupt end when she failed to show for work, later explaining she suffered a nervous breakdown. As she finished both programs without warning, emergency replacements were called in, with Getaway presenter Catriona Rowntree temporarily replacing her on Funniest Home Videos, before Kim Kilby was brought in as a permanent host, whilst Livinia Nixon replaced her as co-host of Hey Hey It's Saturday.

After more than two years off-screen, Taylor made her return television appearance on In Melbourne Tonight in August 1999, singing "I Want You Back". Taylor joined the cast of the Australian stage production, Happy Days: The Arena Mega Musical in October 1999.

Taylor returned to Australia's Funniest Home Video Show as a guest in late 1999 for the shows 10th Anniversary special.

In 2000, Taylor hosted Starstruck, a Saturday night talent quest show, in what was her final regular television role for more than seven years. Taylor appeared as a guest on Greeks on the Roof in 2003 and on Australia Unites: Reach Out to Asia in 2005, a joint venture by the Seven, Nine, and Ten networks to raise money for the Boxing Day Tsunami.

Personal life

After disappearing from television in mid-1997, Taylor moved to San Diego, California, and remained out of the public eye for more than two years. She returned to Australia in August 1999 and revealed in an interview with Ray Martin that her disappearance was due to a nervous breakdown. In 2016, during an episode of I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!, Taylor confirmed her abrupt disappearance in 1997 was due to being exhausted and stressed due to work pressures, along with the negative effect a falsely rumoured sex tape was having on herself and her family. Taylor described that time of her life as extremely difficult and explained that her mental instability and weaknesses were not talked about back then, but that she is not ashamed.

Taylor travelled to Ethiopia and Uganda in 1996 as an ambassador for World Vision Australia to meet her sponsor child and film a documentary.

Their wedding photos and story appeared in Woman's Day magazine. Taylor and Muster separated in 2002 and divorced in 2005.

In 2019, Taylor moved back to Perth after living in Melbourne and Noosa with her son since 2005. She has been practicing Iyengar Yoga since 2010 and is studying as a yoga teacher trainee.
