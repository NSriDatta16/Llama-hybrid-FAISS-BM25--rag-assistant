History 

Rushford Lake was formed by a dam on Caneadea Creek in 1927, resulting in the loss of the communities of East Rushford and Kellogville by flooding. The dam and resulting lake were originally owned and governed by Rochester Gas and Electric (RG&E) for the purpose to control the water level in the Genesee River.  In 1981 the dam and Rushford Lake was transferred to the Rushford Lake Recreation District which manages the dam, as well as lake and shoreline use.

Rushford Lake was the setting of the 2004 movie Ghost Lake.  In the film, the souls of village residents who drowned after the dam's construction return one hundred years later to avenge their death. Actual shooting took place on the lake.

Recreation
The lake is largely a recreational lake during the summer months. It is also stocked annually with brown and rainbow trout in the spring by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. Bass, crappie, carp, perch, suckers, bullhead and sunfish are also part of this fishery.

The angling public has access to the lake at two points. On the north side of the lake, the Balcom Beach area provides shore fishing access and a trailered boat launch. Launching for boats engaged in fishing only is free, seven days a week. Near the dam, an area off Dam Road provides shore fishing access. Ice fishing is permitted.
