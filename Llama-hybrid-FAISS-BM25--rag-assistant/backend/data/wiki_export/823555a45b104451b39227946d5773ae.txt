Ras Al Khor Wildlife Sanctuary () is a wetland reserve in Dubai, renowned for attracting large numbers of migratory birds. It is also home to a large population of crustaceans, small mammals, and fish.

Overview
Ras Al Khor Wildlife Sanctuary represents an enclave of relative wilderness amidst traffic and sprawling urban infrastructure. Located just as the name in Arabic suggests, at the Cape of the Creek, it is among the few urban protected areas of the world.

The Dubai Municipality has taken great efforts to protect and preserve the biodiversity of this delicate ecosystem. The wetland has been fenced off from the public and three birding hides have been built. The bird hides are a first step towards the development of more elaborate visitor education facilities in the protected area. The WWF UAE Project Office collaborated with Dubai Municipality's Environment Department, in setting up the facilities that were sponsored by the National Bank of Dubai.

Opportunities for experiencing a natural environment in this rapidly expanding emirate are so limited that the opening of Ras Al Khor to visitors is a boon to present and potential nature lovers.

There are three birding hides located on the perimeter of the sanctuary open to the public. Entrance is free and the sanctuary operates from 7:30am-5:30pm in the Winter and 6:00 am to 6:00 pm in the Summer.

Ras Al Khor is also home to about 470 species of fauna and 47 kinds of flora. Greater flamingoes (Phoenicopterus roseus), are one of the main attractions in the preserve.
