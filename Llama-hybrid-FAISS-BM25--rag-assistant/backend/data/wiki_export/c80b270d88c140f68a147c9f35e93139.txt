Huttwil is a municipality in the Oberaargau administrative district in the Swiss canton of Bern.

History

Early history
Huttwil is first mentioned in the 9th Century as Huttiwilare.

The Huttwil area was probably first settled in the 7th or 8th century, though it first appears in historic records in the 9th century.  Initially it was part of the Upper Aargau lands of the Adalgoze family, though by the 11th and 12th centuries the Counts of Rheinfelden and Fenis-Neuchâtel owned land and rights in Huttwil.  In the 12th century Fenis-Neuchâtel donated their Huttwil lands to Erlach Abbey.  The village church is first mentioned in 1093 or 1108 when Agnes von Rheinfelden and her husband Berchtold II von Zähringen donated the patronage rights to the Abbey of Saint Peter in the Black Forest.  The remainder of the Rheinfelden rights passed to the Zähringens through Agnes' marriage.  When the Zähringen family died out in 1218 the Counts of Kyburg acquired the growing town and surrounding lands.  In 1313 the Counts of Neu-Kyburg gave Huttwil to their overlord, the Austrian Habsburgs.  Following the surprising Swiss Confederation and Bernese victory at the Battle of Laupen in 1339, Bernese troops destroyed the Habsburg town of Huttwil in 1340.  Though the town was rebuilt and the Kyburgs remained in power Huttwil came increasingly under the Bernese sphere of influence.  Over the following centuries it was owned by a Bernese noble family before being completely absorbed into the Bernese bailiwick of Trachselwald in 1516.

In 1528 Bern adopted the new faith of the Protestant Reformation and Huttwil converted along with the rest of the Bernese lands.  When they suppressed Erlach Abbey in the same year, the Abbey's rights and lands from the Counts of Fenis-Neuchâtel were acquired by Bern.

Swiss peasant war of 1653

During the Swiss peasant war of 1653, Huttwil was a center of the rebellion.  On 23 April 1653, representatives of the people of the countryside of Lucerne, Bern, Basel, and Solothurn met at Sumiswald and concluded an alliance to help each other to achieve their goals.  A week later, they met again at Huttwil, where they renewed that alliance and elected Niklaus Leuenberger from Rüderswil in the Emmental as their leader.

On 14 May 1653, the peasants met again at a Landsgemeinde at Huttwil and formalized their alliance as the "League of Huttwil" by signing a written contract in the style of the old Bundesbriefe of the Old Swiss Confederacy. The treaty clearly established the league as a separate political entity that considered itself equal to and independent from the cities. The tax revolt had become an independence movement, based ideologically on the traditional Swiss founding legends, especially on the legend of William Tell. Legally, the peasants justified their assemblies and their union by the rights of old and in particular the Stanser Verkommnis of 1481, one of the important coalition treaties of the Old Swiss Confederacy.

Though the Huttwil League was initially successful and forced Bern and Lucerne to sign peace treaties and grant concessions, on 3 June 1653 they were decisively defeated in the Battle of Wohlenschwil.  Bernese troops then burned villages and crushed further resistance over the following month.  Niklaus Leuenberger was beheaded and quartered at Bern on September 6, 1653; his head was nailed at the gallows together with one of the four copies of the Bundesbrief of the Huttwil League.

After the war to modern times

While the Swiss peasant war was unsuccessful, it forced Bernese authorities to reform the tax structure and respect the rights of the peasants.  While Huttwil was the center of the revolt, it was not punished further by the authorities.  Huttwil's location on the Bern-Lucerne road allowed it to continue to grow.  While agriculture remained important, it became a regional market town and other industries began to develop.  During the ancien regime period tensions rose between the well-off town citizens who owned much of the farming land and the poor sharecropper Tauner who worked the land and had few rights.  Even the reforms of the 1798 French invasion and the Helvetic Republic failed to address the old power structure in the town.  Finally in 1828, the citizens lost their special rights and the commons were divided between the former Tauner.

Throughout the 19th century a number of factories and small shops opened in the town, including canvas weaving, spinning wool, horsehair spinning, knitting mills, tanneries, sawmills and furniture manufacturing.  Today the manufacturing sector in Huttwil provides about one-third of all jobs in the municipality.

On the night of 8/9 June 1834 much of the town was destroyed in a fire.  The entire town was rebuilt according to plans from Bern's city architect, Johann Daniel Osterrieth.  He planned a town center with three main roads around a central plaza with fountains.  The streets were lined with half-timbered Country-Biedermeier houses which reflected the growing prosperity of the town.  The village church was rebuilt on the old foundations, but with a higher tower and a new onion dome.

An attempt to build a railway from Bern through Huttwil and the lower Emmental to Lucerne in 1871 failed.  It took almost two decades before Huttwil was eventually connected to a railway.  The Langenthal–Huttwil railway opened in 1889, followed by the Huttwil–Wolhusen railway in 1895, the Ramsei-Sumiswald line in 1908 and the Eriswil line in 1915.  The railway connected Huttwil to the rest of the country and allowed industry to grow in the town.  The first three railways eventually merged into the United Huttwil Railway (Vereinigten Huttwil-Bahnen) which in 1997 became the Regionalverkehr Mittelland AG.

Due to Huttwil being a regional center a secondary school opened in the town in 1873.  A district hospital opened a few years later, in 1903.  The original hospital was replaced with a new building in 1929 and the old hospital became a retirement home.  In 1939 a Roman Catholic church was built in Huttwil for the Catholic residents of the village.  The Brother Klaus Church was rebuilt to its current appearance in 1983.
