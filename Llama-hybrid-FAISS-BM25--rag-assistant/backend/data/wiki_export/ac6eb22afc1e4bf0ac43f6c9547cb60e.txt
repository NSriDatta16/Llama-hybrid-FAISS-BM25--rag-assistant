Walter Butler (1703–1783), also known as Walter Butler of Kilcash, and Walter Butler of Garryricken, was the de jure 16th Earl of Ormond and 9th Earl of Ossory. He did not assume these titles, as he thought them forfeit as a result of the attainder of the 2nd Duke of Ormonde. In the peerage of Ireland, the titles were successfully claimed in 1791 by his son John, the 17th Earl.

Birth and origins 
Walter was born on 10 June 1703, probably at Garryricken House, the only son of John Butler and his wife Frances Butler. His father was the younger brother of Thomas Butler of Garryricken and part of a cadet branch of the Butler dynasty that started with Richard Butler of Kilcash (died 1701), a younger brother of the 1st Duke of Ormond. Walter's mother was a daughter of George Butler of Ballyragget, who belonged to another branch of the same wide-branched family. The Butler Dynasty is Old English and descends from Theobald Walter, who had been appointed Chief Butler of Ireland by King Henry II in 1177.

Marriage and children 
On 19 December 1732 he married Ellen (Eleanor) Morres, the eldest daughter of Nicholas Morres of the Court, County Dublin, granddaughter of Sir John Morres, 7th Baronet Morres of Knockagh.

By his wife he had a son and three daughters:
Frances, married Morgan Kavanagh, of Ballyhale, County Kilkenny
Susanna (born 1733) married Thomas Kavanagh, The MacMorrough in 1755;
Eleanor Charlotte (1739–1829) was the elder of the two Ladies of Llangollen
John (1740–1795) became the 17th Earl of Ormonde

Inheritances and succession 
He inherited his father's estate at an unknown time near the middle of the century and was then known as Walter Butler of Garryricken, a member of the landed gentry.

In 1766, his cousin John Butler of Kilcash, the de jure 15th Earl of Ormonde, died without an heir. As a result, Walter Butler inherited the Ormond estate that his cousin had in turn inherited from Charles Butler, 1st Earl of Arran along with the lands that his cousin had inherited from Thomas Butler of Garryricken, his father. In consequence, the two halves of the lands of the Garryricken Manor were reunited in Walter's hand. It had been divided between his father and his uncle Thomas at the death of Richard Butler of Kilcash in 1701.

Unknowingly, Walter Butler also inherited his cousin's title and became de jure the 16th Earl of Ormond.

Kilkenny Castle 
Having inherited the estates, Walter decided to move into Kilkenny Castle, which was in a dilapidated state. In 1769, his son John married the heiress Anne Wandesford of Castlecomer. Walter and John spent much of her dowry on improving the castle. They re-routed the old approach road away from the castle, built a new road, and then landscaped and planted the Castle Park and the road much as it is today. They built the beautiful stables and courtyards across this road and finally, Walter moved to his newly built dower house, Butler House beyond those stables.

Death and succession 
Walter Butler died in Kilkenny Castle in 1783. After his father's death, his son reclaimed the title of "Earl of Ormonde". This was confirmed in 1791. The Butlers rapidly re-established their position and prestige. They always owned large areas of land in counties Kilkenny and Tipperary, and now became the largest landowners in the southeast of Ireland.
