Washington Redskins
On July 27, 2011, Cofield agreed to a six-year deal with the Washington Redskins that will pay him $12.5 million in guaranteed money.
Cofield, originally being a defensive tackle in the Giants' 4-3 defense, was converted to a nose tackle in Redskins' 3-4 defense. He received praise for how well his transition to his new position went due to the short amount time he had to learn how to play the position caused by the 2011 NFL lockout.
Cofield would end up starting in all 16 games of the 2011 season and recorded 25 combined tackles, three sacks, and a new career high of eight pass deflections.

On November 14, 2012, during the Redskins' bye week in the 2012 season, Cofield was made a co-defensive captain after a team vote.

Cofield was placed on injured reserve designated for return on September 9, 2014 after suffering a high ankle sprain. The Redskins placed him back on the active roster on November 11, 2014. He was released on February 27, 2015.
