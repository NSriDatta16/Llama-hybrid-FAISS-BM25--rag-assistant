Teams from 150 high schools competed as varsity ice hockey teams in Western and Eastern Pennsylvania. Unlike many other high school sport in Pennsylvania, hockey is not run under Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association umbrella. However, Pennsylvania's high school ice hockey is sanctioned by USA Hockey and varsity-level programs are marginally overseen by the NHL Pittsburgh Penguins and Philadelphia Flyers organizations through the Penguins Cup and the Flyers Cup. However although it is considered a club it is still a part of the High School and is affiliated with the school.

Format 
Varsity teams are divided into four divisions, AAA, AA, A, and B (Open). Western divisional champions earn a bid to the Penguins Cup playoff tournament. Eastern divisional teams earn a bid by invitation to the Flyers Cup playoff tournament. All teams are eligible except non-pure and second varsity teams.

State Championship 
The Pennsylvania State High School Ice Hockey Championship is awarded through a state tournament.  The tournament pits the champions from the Penguins Cup and Flyers Cup with the winners receiving the AAA, AA, or A Pennsylvania Cup. The location changes every year rotating between Western and Eastern cities. Attempts to mirror the PIAA state championships by hosting the games in Hershey, Pennsylvania, lasted a single season, with only the 2005 series being held at the historic Hersheypark Arena. Starting in 2014 the state championship is now being playing at Pegula Ice Arena The first Pennsylvania Cup was held at the University of Pennsylvania's Class of 1923 Ice Rink under the auspices of The Philadelphia Flyers "Hockey Central" organization. USA Hockey's Mid America Director Frank Black and The Flyers' Andy Abramson organized the championship, after Flyers President Robert "Bob" J. Butera and Penguins EVP Paul Martha agreed to sponsor the event annually.

Divisions 
While the western part of the state has been divided into fairly equal levels at the AAA, AA, and A levels, the eastern part has mostly been run by the independent leagues that compete for Flyers Cup. A change was made recently in an effort to provide more uniformity throughout the eastern portion of the state. Whereas the levels were previously determined by where a team finished in its respective leagues, the Flyers Cup recently restructured the system were AAA is all open enrollment schools, AA is the larger public schools, and A is the smaller public schools. The open enrollment schools are not forced to play AAA, but if they do not they cannot qualify for the Flyers Cup. Changes are still being proposed for the 2008–2009 season that could create a second varsity level for open enrollment schools that do not wish to play at the AAA level.
