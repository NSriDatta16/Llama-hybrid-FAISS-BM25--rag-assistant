Golf
PGA Tour: Chris Couch nabs his first-ever PGA Tour win at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans despite bogeying the 17th hole, and experiencing a weird 18th. On the last hole, Couch hit his drive into a cut of rough, then flew his second shot over the green into the back of the sand bunker behind it. With a funny stance, his third shot only left the bunker onto the rough in front of it. Couch then proceeded to hole his fourth shot to make par and win with an overall score of 19-under, defeating co-runners-up Charles Howell III and Fred Funk by one shot. It was a great ending to an odd week for Couch in the Big Easy. A week earlier, Couch had gotten lost in a bad part of New Orleans, then hitched a ride with strangers who took him into an even worse part of town, where he had to go to a tattoo parlor just to call police so they could help him find his car.
