Minsk-Pasažyrski (, ) is the main passenger railway station in Minsk, Belarus. It is located in the centre of Minsk. It is sometimes called Minsk Ploshchad Lenina due to the metro station serving the terminal, or simply Minsk.

History
The station was built in 1873 as Vilenski vakzal, Vilnius station ( ). The initial wooden building was demolished in 1890 and rebuilt in stone. During World War II, Minsk railway station was completely destroyed. It was rebuilt in 1945–1946 and served until 1991. The new building of Minsk-Passazhyrski railway station was built in 1991–2002. Its construction was delayed for financial difficulties. However, now Minsk has one of the most modern and up-to-date railway stations in the CIS. There are plans to move all suburban rail traffic from Minsk-Passazhyrski to smaller stations Minsk-Uskhodni (East), Minsk-Paudnyovy (South) and Minsk-Paunochny (North) by 2020.
