In the 1877 Birthday Honours, Lord Abinger was appointed to the Order of the Bath as a Companion (CB).

Family
In 1863, he married Helen Magruder, daughter of Commodore George Allan Magruder, of the United States Navy, and niece of John B. Magruder. They had one son, James and two daughters, Ella, who studied medicine at London School of Medicine for Women and the Royal Free Hospital and became the first female doctor in the state of Bloemfontein, South Africa, and Evelina, an activist for women's suffrage and an aid worker during World War I, who married Major Henry Haverfield. 

One of the two main family estates at this time (the other being the house that is today Inverlochy Castle Hotel) was Abinger Hall, at the foot of the North Downs in Abinger, Surrey. The third baron sold it in 1867 to a Mr Gwynne, who soon thereafter sold it to become the family seat of the statistician recently created first Lord Farrer, who rebuilt the house on that land.

Scarlett's first cousin once removed (downward), James Williams Scarlett, son of Sir William Anglin Scarlett, purchased the isle of Gigha, off the coast of Argyll, for £49,000 in 1865. His son, Lieutenant-Colonel William James Scarlett, then built the mansion house of Achamore there. Gigha remained in the family's hands until 1919.
