Doors Open Toronto is an annual event where approximately 150 buildings of architectural, historic, cultural, and social significance to the city of Toronto open their doors to the public for this free citywide event. Toronto was the first city in North America to launch a Doors Open Day program. Staff at many participating buildings organize guided tours, exhibits, displays, and activities to enrich the visitor experience.

History
Doors Open Toronto was developed as a millennium project in 2000, by the City of Toronto (developed from a European model) and has since attracted over 1.7 million residents and tourists. Doors Open Toronto gives people of all ages and backgrounds the opportunity to learn about Toronto's history, get involved and celebrate Toronto's built heritage.

The municipal event won several awards in the late 2000s, including the City Soul Award from the Canadian Urban Institute at the Urban Leadership Awards in 2009, as well as the City Manager's Award for Toronto Public Service Excellence and the Canadian Museums Association Awards of Outstanding Achievement in 2010.
 
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Toronto, the 2020 and 2021 editions of the event were cancelled.

Participants 
Most buildings are open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on both Saturday and Sunday; however some only open for limited hours. The public is advised to check the "buildings to visit" section of the official website. The list of buildings is made public on May 1 of the calendar year. Some Doors Open Toronto highlighted buildings include: R.C. Harris Water Treatment Plant, Mackenzie House, and TTC carhouses.

Sponsors 
Doors Open Toronto relies heavily on the support of sponsors. The Toronto Star releases the official Doors Open Toronto program guide in May of each year and has been a vital supporter of the program.  In 2012, City TV and Omni Television also came on board as Doors Open Toronto media sponsors.

Volunteers 
Doors Open Toronto is managed by the Cultural Services and Special Events Departments at the City of Toronto. Doors Open Toronto relies on the support, as well as enthusiasm of hundreds of volunteers.

Applications are available each fall and can be found on the Doors Open Toronto website.
