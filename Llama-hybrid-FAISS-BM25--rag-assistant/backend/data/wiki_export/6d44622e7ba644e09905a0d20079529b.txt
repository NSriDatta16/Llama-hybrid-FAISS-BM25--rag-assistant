Early life

John Walter Fitsell was born on July 25, 1923, in Barrie, Ontario, and moved with his family to Lindsay in 1927. He had three siblings, his father John Charles Fitsell was a baker, and his mother Beatrice Exell was a homemaker. The family home where he grew up included a large lot upon which an ice hockey rink was constructed each winter, where he and his friends played as youths.

Fitsell was a lifelong fan of the Toronto Maple Leafs and stated his favourite player was Charlie Conacher, since they both played as a right winger. The Maple Leafs played an exhibition game in Lindsay in 1935, and Fitsell introduced himself and his friends to the players as they exited the team's bus before the game. In the 1930s, Fitsell began a lifelong hobby of a scrapbook containing newspaper articles, photographs and other memorabilia related to the Maple Leafs. He attended his first National Hockey League game on January 18, 1936, watching the Maple Leafs play the Boston Bruins at Maple Leaf Gardens.

Fitsell attended high school at Lindsay Collegiate and Vocational Institute. At age 17, he joined the Navy Cadets and departed for Victoria, British Columbia. He later joined the Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve in 1942. He played hockey while stationed in Halifax with the navy during World War II. He initially served aboard HMCS St. Francis, then was transferred to HMCS Outremont. He was a ship's writer and assisted the captains with correspondence and paying the crews. During the Normandy landings in 1944, Outremont protected the western end of the English Channel from enemy submarines. He courted Barbara Robson on Cape Breton Island after the war, and they married in 1945. He was discharged from naval service in 1946 and they settled in Lindsay.
