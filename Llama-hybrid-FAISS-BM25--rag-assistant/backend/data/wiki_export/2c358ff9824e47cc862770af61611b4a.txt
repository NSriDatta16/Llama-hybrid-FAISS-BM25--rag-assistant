The Corridor People is a British television series that was produced by Granada Television for the ITV network in 1966, devised and written by Edward Boyd.

A surreal black-and-white detective series, The Corridor People pitched security agent Kronk (John Sharp) against exotic villainess Syrie Van Epp (Elizabeth Shepherd) over the course of four episodes.

The series has been released on DVD in the form of electronic conversions from 405 to 625-line video.

Episode list

Reception 
The series has been described as "(c)onfusing, erudite, self-consciously absurd and packed with eccentric dialogue"; "a surreal spy/detective/fantasy series"; "very much a product of its televisual times, following in the footsteps of such contemporaries as 'The Avengers' and 'Adam Adamant Lives!' However, unlike these more popular series this stylized swinging sixties Mystery/Detective/Thriller/Spy drama has failed to develop any long-term fan base or appreciation. Perhaps this was due to its limited run which prevented the building of a viewing base or perhaps it was just too off the wall and leftfield even for the psychedelic decade. The otherwise excellent book the Guinness Book of Classic Television describes the programme rather unfairly as "...the Twin Peaks of its day."
