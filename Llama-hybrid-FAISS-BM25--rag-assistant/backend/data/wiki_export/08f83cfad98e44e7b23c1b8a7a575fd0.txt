Story
Kotencotenco is a gag strip anime for especially younger children. Featuring the flourishes of the Prince of Heaven Kingdom, Kotenco. It's up to him and his friends, Pick-chan and Nappa to stop The Baron, Urusainu, and Nekoumori from stealing the heavenly stars for their boss, The Great Demon King Agu, who wants to take over Heaven Kingdom. Kotenco is normally very kind, but will transform into Matenco, his trouble-making counterpart when in bad spirit. Matenco is transformed back into Kotenco when Pick-chan calls upon The Queen to replace Matenco's halo.
