Landmark Cinema of Canada Inc. is a Canadian cinema chain. Based in Calgary, Alberta, Landmark operates 39 theatres with 317 screens, primarily in Ontario and western Canada. Its holdings include much of the former Empire Theatres chain which it acquired in late 2013, and some Famous Players locations divested as part of that chain's purchase by Cineplex Entertainment. Landmark is the second-largest cinema chain in Canada after Cineplex. It was acquired by Belgium company Kinepolis in 2017 for $123 million.

History
Landmark Cinemas is the umbrella name originally covering the holdings of Towne Cinemas, Rokemay Cinemas, and occasionally May Theatres.  It was adopted in 1974 after the purchase of Rothstein Theatres, which was the first big expansion for the company, adding about 15 locations (some closed immediately or sold and were never operated by Landmark).

Another expansion took place in 1984, when it purchased most of the Alberta and British Columbia assets of Canadian Odeon Theatres as  part of that chain's merger into Cineplex Odeon Corporation, now Cineplex Entertainment.

In late 2013, Landmark Cinemas announced the purchase of 23 theatres in Ontario and Western Canada from Empire Theatres. It later added the Kanata and Whitby locations that were to be sold to Cineplex Entertainment, plus Ottawa's World Exchange Plaza. This transaction made Landmark the second-largest cinema chain in Canada with 54 locations and 359 screens. The sale also included five IMAX screens, one in Calgary, Alberta, and four in Ontario. Empire promotional offers such as Reel Deal Tuesdays and University/College Student Combo were carried over by Landmark, but only some locations offer these discounts.

Empire Theatres in Ontario and Western Canada closed on October 31, 2013, after the evening shows which also closed Empire Theatres permanently. The sale closed on October 31, 2013, and on November 1, 2013, the theatres reopened as Landmark Cinemas. Branding name changes occurred in late 2013 at the former Empire Theatres locations. Landmark Cinemas operated the World Exchange Plaza theatre on a management contract from November 1 to December 31, 2013, after which its lease expired.

In September 2017, Landmark announced its sale to the Belgian exhibitor Kinepolis for $123 million, pending regulatory approval. On December 8, 2017, Landmark announced the completion of the sale to Kinepolis Group.

Operations

Premium seating
Reserve Recline Relax is a premium theatre offering available at no additional charge at 21 Landmark Cinemas locations. Seats are reserved in advance and consist of larger, sofa-like chairs comparable to Cineplex VIP Cinemas, though without the legal drinking age requirement or alcohol service. To make room for these seats, theatres now have 60% fewer seats.

Premiere Seats are available at 17 locations, and auditoriums with this option include one row of these seats. This option includes privacy screens, coat hooks, side tables, adjustable heated seats and adjustable headrests. Premiere Seats require an additional fee compared to regular seats.

Premium screens

Landmark Cinemas features several premium large format screens. These require an additional cost compared to a regular admission and offer reserved seating.
IMAX digital screens with xenon projection are available at four locations. One is in Calgary, Alberta (Country Hills) and three are in Ontario at the Kingston, Kitchener, Kanata. Whitby location is using IMAX Laser projector. All of these were previously owned by Empire Theatres and, with the exception of Kingston, were in turn previously owned by AMC Theatres (Kanata and Whitby) or Famous Players (SilverCity in Calgary and Kitchener). IMAX 70 mm film screenings are unavailable at Landmark Cinemas.
Extra Experience is an in-house large screen theatre, and is currently available at two locations. Extra theatres use a Barco 2K projector, a custom-designed 7.1 surround sound system and faux leather seats. It premiered as Empire Extra at the Waterloo location on November 19, 2010, and at the Calgary (Shawnessy) and Ottawa (Orleans) locations following an announcement on May 16, 2011. Landmark opened an Extra auditorium in Winnipeg in May 2015, with Pitch Perfect 2 premiering in that format. Landmark has replaced two former Extra auditoriums with Laser Ultra, including Shawnessy in 2021 and Waterloo in 2023.
Xtreme is available exclusively at the West Kelowna, BC location. It is a Landmark Cinemas brand similar to the Extra Experience, but in lieu of Extra's 7.1 surround sound, Xtreme uses Dolby Atmos (formerly Barco Auro 11.1) surround sound, and recliner seating.
Laser Ultra is an in-house large screen theatre available at 13 locations. These premium screens feature 4K laser projectors, Dolby Atmos surround sound, and recliner seating.
