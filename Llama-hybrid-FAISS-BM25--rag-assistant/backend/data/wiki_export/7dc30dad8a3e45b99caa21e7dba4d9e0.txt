Cultural intelligence or cultural quotient (CQ) is a term introduced by London Business School professor P. Christopher Earley and Nanyang Business School professor Soon Ang in their textbook Cultural Intelligence: Individual Interactions Across Cultures, which describes "a person's capability to adapt as she interacts with others from different cultural regions," and has behavioral, motivational, and metacognitive aspects. 

Cultural intelligence shares common ground with emotional intelligence (EQ) but extends beyond it. While individuals with a high EQ can grasp "what makes us human and at the same time what makes each of us different from one another," individuals with a high CQ can discern universal, individual, and non-idiosyncratic features within the behavior of a person or group.

Four CQ capabilities 
The authors describe four CQ capabilities: motivation (CQ Drive), cognition (CQ Knowledge), meta-cognition (CQ Strategy), and behavior (CQ Action).  CQ Assessments report scores on all four capabilities as well as several sub-dimensions for each capability. The four capabilities stem from the intelligence-based approach to intercultural adjustment and performance.
