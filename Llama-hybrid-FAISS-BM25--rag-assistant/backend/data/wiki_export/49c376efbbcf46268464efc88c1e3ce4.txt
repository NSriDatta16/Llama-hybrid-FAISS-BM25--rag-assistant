After capturing the Silver Medal in the 1994 Calgary International Organ Festival & Competition his concert career was solidified with major engagements and eventual artist management with Karen McFarlane Artists, Inc. He has since played in most major venues throughout the United States, Canada, Europe, Russia and South America.

He has adjudicated numerous competitions including the 50th St. Albans Competition (UK), serving as the only American judge and recitalist.
