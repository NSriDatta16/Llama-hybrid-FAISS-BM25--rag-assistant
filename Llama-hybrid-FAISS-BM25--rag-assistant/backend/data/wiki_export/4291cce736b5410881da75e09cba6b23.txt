Eighth Avenue Place is a  twin-tower building complex located in downtown Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The complex includes a 49-storey  East tower, 40-storey  West office tower, and a three-storey indoor urban park.

The complex is housed on the site of the former Penny Lane Mall, originally intending to keep the historic name as "Penny Lane Towers", the project has since been renamed.

Construction
Demolition of the old mall was completed in September 2007. Excavation of the parkade below the building commenced in December 2007 and construction of the 49-storey east tower, and the parkade begun in Summer 2008. Eighth Avenue Place East was completed in 2011 and is currently the fifth-tallest building in Calgary. Eighth Avenue Place West was completed later in 2014.

Design
The structures, designed by Gibbs Gage Architects to have a Rocky Mountain theme, with a western facing pale-green glass wall mimicking mountain waters and glaciers. The remainder of the building adopts a dark gray-layered appearance representing the shifting tectonic plates that built the mountains. The complex connects to the Plus 15 skywalk system, and contains a six-level underground parkade with 1,141 parking stalls. The buildings also feature landscaped terraces and plazas, a  green roof, and an atrium winter garden.
