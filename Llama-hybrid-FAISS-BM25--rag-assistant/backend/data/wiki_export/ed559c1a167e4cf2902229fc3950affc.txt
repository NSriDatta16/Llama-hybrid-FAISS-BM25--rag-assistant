The Concours musical international de Montréal (CMIM) is an elite-level competition for classical musicians who are interested in pursuing an international career as a professional concert artist. Established in 2001 by the late André Bourbeau and by the late French-Canadian bass Joseph Rouleau, the CMIM features three disciplines - voice, violin and piano - on a rotating basis over a three-year cycle.

The CMIM is composed of four rounds: the preliminary round (based on video recordings), the first round, the semi-finals and the finals. Award winners receive prizes and grants valued at over $150,000. The 2023 edition, which will take place from April 22 to May 4, 2023, will be dedicated to the Violin, followed by the Piano edition in 2024 and the Voice edition in 2025.

André Bourbeau was the president of the Competition since its first edition in 2002 and was succeeded by François R. Roy in 2018.

Since May 2004, the CMIM has been a member of the World Federation of International Music Competitions.
