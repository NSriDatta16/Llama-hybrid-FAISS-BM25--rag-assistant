Ramsay family
The Ramsays were seven brothers who had achieved cult status for producing low-budget horror films through the 1970s and 1980s, going into the early 1990s. They were the sons of Fatehchand Uttamchand (FU) Ramsay, who had shifted to Mumbai (then Bombay) from Karachi after Partition with his wife and children. In Karachi, the Ramsays (originally Ramsinghani) ran a radio store, and set  in Mumbai before shifting to movies. FU Ramsay tried his hand first, but was a failure. But the brothers hit upon the idea of making horror films, starting with Do Gaz Zameen Ke Neeche in 1972. They chose low-cost options, with family members handling most of the key bits of the film-making process. They chose actors who didn't cost too much and shot at actual locations instead of spending on sets. Some of their best known films are Darwaza, Dahshat, Purana Mandir and Veerana. Though they stopped making films together afterwards, most of them continued to be a part of the movies, especially Keshu Ramsay, who produced a number of successful films with Akshay Kumar and made the brilliant Khakee in 2004. The brothers – apart from Keshu – did, however, come together to produce the extremely successful Zee Horror Show, which later became Anhonee, for television.
