Live at the El Mocambo is a 1993 live album by Elvis Costello and the Attractions. Recorded on March 6, 1978, from a live radio broadcast by CHUM-FM in Toronto. A tape of the broadcast was obtained by the Canadian division of CBS records and released as an exclusive Canadian promotional album in the same year. As the show's fame began to grow, it became heavily bootlegged.

It was first legally made available with the release (as Live at El Mocambo) either as disc 4 of the 2½ Years 4CD box set or to US purchasers of the first three CDs, in exchange for tokens included in the CD packaging, directly from Rykodisc. The concert was reissued, as a mainstream release, on 29 September 2009 by Hip-O Records, with the same content of the 1978 promotional album.
