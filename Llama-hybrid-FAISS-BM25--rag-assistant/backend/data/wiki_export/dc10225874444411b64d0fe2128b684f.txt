History
The earliest historical references to Yeongdeungpo were in the 1870s when it was considered to be the main port used in the defence of the city of Seoul.

The opening of the Gyeongin Line in 1899 and the Gyeongbu Line 1905, the County Office of Siheung-gun was relocated to Yeongdeungpo and area became a major hub for transportation and commerce.

Except for Yeouido and Yanghwa-dong, Yeongdeungpo belonged to old Siheung County. In 1936, Yeongdeungpo (except for today's Daerim-dong) was annexed to Gyeongseong (today's Seoul). In 1949, some parts of Siheung County were ceded to Yeongdeungpo District of Seoul. These sections are today's Guro-dong, Sindorim-dong, Daerim-dong and Sindaebang-dong.
It is one of the sub-centers of Seoul, and the Seoul Metropolitan Subway Line 1 passes. Among the areas south of the Han River in present-day Seoul, it was the first (1936) to be incorporated into Seoul.

January 1, 1963, Some areas of Bucheon County were combined to Yeongdeungpo District as below.

Also, many parts of Siheung County were merged into this district at the same time.

During the post-Korean War industrialization period the district's economy and population grew dramatically and as a result sections of the district were broken up to form new districts – Gwanak-gu being established in 1973, Gangseo-gu in 1977, and Guro-gu in 1980.

For several decades, Yeouido in Yeongdeungpo district has been considered the financial center of Seoul. This reputation was stimulated by the relocation of the Korean main bourse, the Korea Exchange (KRX), from Myeongdong to Yeouido in 1979. Among the 291 head offices of financial institutions located in Seoul, 93 are based in Yeouido, Yeongdeungpo. Notably, 42 out of 68 asset management companies and 8 out of 11 futures companies have their head offices in Yeouido. These include Mirae Asset Group, Korea Life Insurance, KDB, Korea Investment Holdings and many more. Korea Exchange was originally located in Yeouido, but it moved to Busan in 2009. Korea Financial Investment Association is still based in Yeouido. The Korea Financial Services Commission (FSC) and the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) are also based in Yeouido.
Despite its popularity with Korean financial institutions, Yeouido has proved less popular with foreign entities who tend to prefer the Jongno district.

Other notable companies based in Yeongdeungpo include Lotte Confectionery, Hanjin Shipping, LG Corp., and Keoyang Shipping are headquartered in Yeouido-dong in Yeongdeungpo District.

Historically, Yeongdeungpo district has been dominated by the manufacturing industry and remnants of this are clearly visible around the district with small workshops and larger factories located next to modern developments, especially in Mullae-dong.

Mullae Art Village 
Mullae-dong was previously a successful industrial area developed in the 1960s as industry left the Cheonggyecheon in Jongno-gu and relocated to Mullae-dong. However, the growth of industry in the area declined in the 1990s as the Asian Financial Crisis had a considerable effect on the South Korean economy. In the 2000s, the availability of empty commercial buildings attracted artists to the area and in 2013 the Korean government officially supported to the concept. Mullae Art Village has become a popular leisure destination and is home to a large number of eateries, bars and other related venues, as well as a considerable number of workshops which are still in operation.
