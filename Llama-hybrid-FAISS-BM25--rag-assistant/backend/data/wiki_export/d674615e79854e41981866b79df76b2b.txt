In 1995 the club changed its name once more to the London O's before becoming the Olympians again in 2009. 

The Olympians are the most successful British American Football team and are Twelve-time BritBowl champions, winning all twelve over a dominant 14 year period from 1992 until 2006.

In 2016, The Olympians were relegated from the Premier Division but bounced back the following year by winning the SFC 1 South and earning promotion despite losing the Division 1 Bowl to the Manchester Titans.

History
The Olympians' first home was on Streatham Common and was founded by Peter Erotokritos, his business partner John Carney who owned the nearby Olympians Gym. 

Between 1995 and 2005 the Olympians were known as the London O's and regularly won the BritBowl Championship.  The name change was a result of the previous owner retaining the rights to the Olympian name when he decided to withdraw from American football.

In 2009 the team returned to the BAFA league after a year in hiatus, playing in Division 2 East. They were promoted from Division 2 at the end of the 2010 season, defeating the Manchester Titans in the Division 2 Bowl game 35–13.

In 2015, they played home games on Peckham Rye before moving north of the Thames for the first time in 2016, playing at East London Rugby Club in West Ham.
