Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Dorothy Germain began playing golf at 11. She graduated from Beaver College (now Arcadia University), where she played field hockey. In the early 1940s, Porter won a number of Philadelphia junior and amateur golf championships, and in 1946 she captured the first of her three Pennsylvania Women's Amateurs. She won the Women's Western Amateur in 1943, 1944, and 1967.

In 1949 she won the U.S. Women's Amateur. Porter was a member of the U.S. team that won the 1950 Curtis Cup and captained the 1966 team to victory. In 1977, she became the first Women's Amateur Champion to win the U.S. Senior Women's Amateur. She went on to win the Seniors' title again in 1980, 1981, and 1983.  In 1984, she captained the winning U.S. Espirito Santo Trophy team.
