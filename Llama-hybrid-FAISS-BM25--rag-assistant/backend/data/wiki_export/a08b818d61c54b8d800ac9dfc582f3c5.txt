Premiers Symptômes () is the debut EP by French electronic music duo Air. It consists of singles issued between 1995 and 1997.

History
"Les professionnels" was later used as the basis of Air's 1998 single "All I Need".

Of 'Le soleil est près de moi', Nicolas Godin said: "It's the best song we ever did. It proves the best that you do isn't always the most successful. It came very naturally. The hard thing was finding a sentence to express the feeling we had. It was winter, so we wanted to have the sun near us. We did it in my living room before we were official artists, and we had so many problems with neighbours complaining about the noise of the Fender Rhodes. It was horrible."
