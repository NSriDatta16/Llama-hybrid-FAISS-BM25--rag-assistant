Park history

Origins of Tweetsie Railroad 

Coal-fired steam locomotive  locomotive No. 12 is the only surviving narrow-gauge engine of the East Tennessee and Western North Carolina Railroad (ET&WNC). Built in 1917 by the Baldwin Locomotive Works, No. 12 is a  narrow gauge  coal-fired locomotive that ran from 1918 to 1940 carrying passengers and freight over the ET&WNC's  line through the Appalachian Mountains from Johnson City, Tennessee to Boone, North Carolina. 

The name "Tweetsie" was given to the original ET&WNC by area residents as a verbal acronym of its initials, but also referred to the "tweet" of the locomotive whistles that echoed through the mountains.  The nickname stuck with the railroad and its trains and became more identifiable than the railroad's official ET&WNC name.  

Two years after the  narrow-gauge portion of the ET&WNC ceased operations in 1950, the locomotive was purchased by a group of railroad enthusiasts and taken to Penn Laird, Virginia to operate as the Shenandoah Central Railroad, which opened in May 1953. Rains from Hurricane Hazel washed out the Shenandoah Central in October, 1954, and Locomotive No. 12 was once again put up for sale. Cowboy actor and singer Gene Autry optioned the locomotive with the intent to move it to California for use in motion pictures. However, Autry determined that the transportation and restoration costs made his plan impractical and intended to let his purchase option lapse.

Tourist attraction
Grover Robbins, an entrepreneur from Blowing Rock, North Carolina, purchased Autry's option and bought the locomotive in August, 1955.  Robbins' plan was to bring the locomotive and rolling stock back to its original home in the Blue Ridge Mountains, initially as an excursion railroad. After restoration at the Southern Railway shops in Hickory, NC, the No. 12 locomotive would soon become the centerpiece of the new "Tweetsie Railroad" tourist attraction. One mile of track was constructed near Blowing Rock, North Carolina and on July 4, 1957, the locomotive made its first public trip over the line. In 1958, the track was extended to a 3-mile loop around the mountain, and the trains at Tweetsie Railroad have traveled that circuit ever since. Grover Robbins' brothers, Harry and Spencer, were also involved with the operation of Tweetsie Railroad, and the park is still controlled and operated by the Robbins family.

In 1960, Tweetsie acquired another coal-fired steam locomotive, USATC S118 Class  No. 190, the "Yukon Queen" from Alaska's White Pass and Yukon Route. Also built by Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1943 for the US Army, the engine was part of an 11-locomotive fleet of "MacArthur" 2-8-2s originally purchased for use overseas.  During World War II, the locomotives were sent to Alaska for use on the White Pass and Yukon. Tweetsie Railroad became a popular tourist attraction, and quickly evolved into the first theme park in North Carolina â€” and one of the first in the nation. A western town and saloon were built around the original depot area.  A train robbery and cowboy-and-Indian show were added to the train ride, playing off the Wild West theme that was very popular at the time on television and in movies. The theme was enhanced by regular visits from singing cowboy Fred Kirby, who hosted a popular children's television show on Charlotte NC's WBTV.  In 1961, a chairlift and amusement ride area was constructed on the central mountain inside the rail loop, and over the decades the park has been expanded with additional rides, attractions, shops, zoo and restaurants.

Steam Locomotive Shop 
Tweetsie Railroad also has its own locomotive workshop to maintain its two locomotives as well as providing repair, parts and overhaul services for other narrow-gauge steam locomotives from several different theme parks such as Walt Disney World, Busch Gardens, Six Flags and Dollywood.

Dollywood Connection
In 1961, Grover and Harry Robbins built another theme park called "Rebel Railroad" in the Smoky Mountains near Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. Originally featuring a Civil War theme, the park was re-themed in 1966 as the Wild West "Goldrush Junction", very similar to Tweetsie Railroad. The Robbins brothers sold Goldrush Junction in the late 1960s, and it subsequently went through various owners. In 1976, Jack and Pete Herschend of Branson, Missouri bought the park and redeveloped it as "Silver Dollar City". In 1986, country music star Dolly Parton became a part-owner with the Herschends and the theme park became today's Dollywood. The railroad continues to run as the Dollywood Express.
