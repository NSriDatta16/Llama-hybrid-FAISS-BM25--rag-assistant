Jilji of Geumgwan Gaya (died 492) (r. 451–492) was the eighth ruler of Geumgwan Gaya, a Gaya state of ancient Korea.  He was the son of King Chwihui and Queen Indeok.

A passage in the Samguk Yusa indicates that he built a Buddhist temple for the ancestral queen Heo Hwang-ok on the spot where she and King Suro were married.  He called the temple Wanghusa ("the Queen's temple", 王后寺) and provided it with ten gyeol of stipend land.  The temple reportedly endured for five hundred years. A gyeol or kyŏl (결 or 結), varied in size from 2.2 acres to 9 acres (8,903–36,422 m2) depending upon the fertility of the land.
