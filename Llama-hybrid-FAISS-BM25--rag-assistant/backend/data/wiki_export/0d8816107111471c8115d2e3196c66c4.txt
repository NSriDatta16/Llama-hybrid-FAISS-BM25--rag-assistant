Plot Summary and Cast

DJ (Dong-Jin) and Master Zhang
This series is about an American-born Chinese "brat" from Beverly Hills, California named Zhang Dong-Jin, also known as Dong-Jin or DJ (Eugene Lee), who is a rich, spoilt and almost-worthless Americanized Chinese that was sent or banished to Singapore by his father, Master Zhang, to live with a conservative Chinese family, the Gohs, so that DJ will learn about Chinese culture.

DJ was tricked by his father into going to Singapore. He thought he was in Singapore on a vacation when he received a phone call from his father, explaining to DJ that he had come to Singapore not for a vacation but to live with the Goh family to learn the traditional Chinese culture from them. However, DJ did not adapt well to the Chinese traditions, such as filial piety.  During the stay with the Goh family, DJ was often being threatened or bullied by Goh, and his family. DJ was often regarded as a Chinese ang moh, a Singlish term for a Chinese person who lives in the West.

The Goh family and others

Goh Boon Keng (Richard Low), who is a sinseh (a traditional Chinese medicine) pupil to Master Zhang and a greatest threat to DJ, lives together with his wife, Hwee (Lim Kwee Hiok), his two children, Fann (Ezann Lee), a bookworm and Jeng Lo (Deng Mao Hui), who is regarded as a sissy and his old, illiterate and dimwitted father, Ah Kong (Marcus Chin). Goh Boon Keng works in a "sinseh" (traditional Chinese medicine) shop. Together, the Goh family lived in a Toa Payoh HDB flat. Ah Kong has an old Indian friend called Gana (Subin Subaiah), a former butcher in a nearby foodstall, who is also as equally illiterate as him. Occasionally, they together get into fights and arguments unexpectedly. Deepak (Vignesh V) is Fann's closest school friend. To DJ, Fann and Deepak are considered as "nerds", an English slang for a stereotypical person who is boring and is not attractive in terms of their appearance and outlook.
