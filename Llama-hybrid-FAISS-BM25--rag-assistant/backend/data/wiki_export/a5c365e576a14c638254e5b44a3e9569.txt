Secondary Highway 519, commonly referred to as Highway 519, is a provincially maintained highway in the Canadian province of Ontario. The highway is  in length, connecting Highway 17 near Obatanga Provincial Park with Dubreuilville station. A private logging road continues east from that point.

Highway 519 was assumed in 1985, and has remained unchanged since then. The route is paved throughout its length and encounters no communities of any size along its length, aside from Dubreuilville. A previous iteration of Highway 519 existed in Haliburton County between 1956 and 1984, travelling from north of Kinmount to north of Haliburton Village.
