Notes from the Underbelly is an American sitcom that was aired on ABC from 2007 to 2008, originally debuting as a mid-season replacement. The series is based on the 2005 novel of the same name by Risa Green, and was produced by Eric and Kim Tannenbaum (previously producing Two and a Half Men) for Warner Bros. Television.  The title is a parody of Dostoevsky's novel Notes from Underground.

Originally, it was supposed to debut on October 5, 2006, along with Big Day, but ABC made a last-minute change in its schedule by moving Ugly Betty to Thursday, thus replacing both sitcoms. After numerous scheduling changes prior to the shows premiere, the show premiered Thursday, April 12, 2007, at 10:00PM Eastern/9:00PM Central, and moved to its regular Wednesday timeslot at 8:30PM Eastern/7:30PM Central on April 18.

Notes from the Underbelly began its second season on November 26, 2007, in the new timeslot of 9:30PM Eastern/8:30PM Central on Mondays, leading out of fall's second highest rated freshman sitcom, Samantha Who?.

On May 13, 2008, ABC canceled the series after two seasons.

In Russia, all 23 episodes of the series were shown on NTV.
