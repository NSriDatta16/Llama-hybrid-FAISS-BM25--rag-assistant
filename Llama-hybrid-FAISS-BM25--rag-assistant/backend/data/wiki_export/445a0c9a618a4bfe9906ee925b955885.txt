The list of ships of Russia by project number includes all Soviet and Russian ships by known assigned project numbers. Ship descriptions are Russian assigned classifications when known. The Russian term проект (tr. proyekt) can be translated either as the cognate "project" or as "design". Warsaw Pact states and Post-Soviet states also used an equivalent term to classify their ships, such as the Polish Project 664 torpedo boat or the Ukrainian Project 58155 Hyurza-M armoured gunboat.
