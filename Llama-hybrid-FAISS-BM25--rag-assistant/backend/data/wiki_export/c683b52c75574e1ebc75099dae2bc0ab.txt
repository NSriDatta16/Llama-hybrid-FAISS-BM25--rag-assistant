North Hills has an intense rivalry with North Allegheny. Their annual football game is scheduled last for each team, and despite season records, it the biggest game of each team's seasons. In 2009, North Hills lost in the regular season matchup, but NH traveled to NA to win in the WPIAL play-offs. In 2016, the WPIAL's new 6 classification system placed North Hills in Class 5A and North Allegheny in Class 6A, meaning that the teams will no longer meet in regular season play, the first time that has happened in over half a century. However, the two schools will continue their rivalries in all other sports, including basketball, softball, and baseball.
