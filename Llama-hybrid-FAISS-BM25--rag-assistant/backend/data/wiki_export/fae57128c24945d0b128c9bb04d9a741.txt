The Pork Dukes are an English punk rock band, formed 1976 during the first wave of British punk in London.

History
The band was originally composed of twin brothers and former Gnidrolog members Colin Goldring (vocals / guitar) and Stewart Goldring (guitar / vocals) using the pseudonyms Vilos and Horrendus Styles, respectively – alongside Scabs (aka Rick Kemp of Steeleye Span) (bass guitar), Germun LePig (aka Nigel Pegrum, also of Steeleye Span and previously in Gnidrolog) (drums) (later replaced by Bonk aka. Rocky Rhythm) and Mack E. Valley (keyboards). He was later replaced by Guardian Angel partway through the recording sessions for the second album.

Combining a Buzzcocks-style pop punk sound with bawdy subject matter, gross-out toilet humour and profanity in their songs, the band released their debut single "Bend and Flush" b/w "Throbbing Gristle" in 1977 on Wood Records, a subsidiary of Caroline Records UK created specifically for the band.

Due to the lyrical content of their recordings, the band struggled for airplay, though BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel was a fan.

The true identities of the Pork Dukes were originally a closely guarded secret, the band playing in pig masks during live performances. Various rumours circulated amongst fans and in the music press that the band was actually Led Zeppelin, Steeleye Span, The Rezillos, Fairport Convention or Tenpole Tudor in disguise. It was also suggested that either Keith Moon or Dudley Moore may have been lead singer.

The controversy surrounding the band and backlash from feminist groups led to them being unable to find a management company to represent them or perform at large venues (gigs were frequently played unannounced at small community centres to avoid protesters). Towards the end the band were playing gigs at mental institutions (Vilos Styles was training to become a psychiatric nurse at this point) to entertain the patients.

Following the release of the studio album Pink Pork and three singles on Wood Records, the band broke up in 1979, with the album Pig Out of Hell being released posthumously by Wood somewhere between 1979 and 1981. Bonk (aka. Rocky Rhythm) later played for The Revillos, Tenpole Tudor and The Damned frontman Dave Vanian's Phantom Chords.

In April 2001, the Pork Dukes reformed with Max Styles on drums and Andy Pandy on bass to record "Save the Pigs", following the foot and mouth outbreak in the UK.  Bonk (aka. Rocky Rhythm) rejoined in 2002 and the band recorded the live album Squeal Meat Again at the Cartoon Club in Croydon, South London. In November 2002, the Styles/Styles/Styles/Pandy line-up embarked on the band's first US tour taking in eight dates in Pennsylvania and New York supported by The Clap. New member Vince Santini (ex-The Revillos) joined on bass guitar / vocals in 2003 after Pandy left the UK. They continue to record and tour.

On 30 August 2008, the band played a one-off gig at London's 12 Bar Club.

Pink Pork/Pork Dukes
"Pork Dukes" is the first studio album by the Pork Dukes. This album is commonly known as "Pink Pork". Although this album was believed by many sites as released in 1979, these sites were going by the release year of the second pressing. The first pressing of the album, known as just "Pork Dukes", was pressed in November 1978, while the second pressing, known as "Pink Pork", was pressed in December 1979. This album was very obscure in the punk industry, but it is noted by most fans of the Pork Dukes for its profane toilet humor.
