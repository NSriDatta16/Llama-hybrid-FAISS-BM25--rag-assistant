Higgins also played guitar and did some vocals in the bands Gentleman Jack, All the Madmen (Working Class Zeroes) and Good Kitty.

As of 2005, he was no longer with The Offspring on the tour but he did backup vocals on Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace. It is said that he needs more time with his church and family.

Later career

Wank 
In 2017 Higgins joined the recently reformed band Wank, a 90s Orange County ska-punk band whose best known song was "Forgiven". In 1998 Wank was signed to Maverick Records, re-releasing their debut album Get a Grip on Yourself. Higgins appears on Wank's 2018 release "White Knuckle Ride" and the 2022 single "The States". Wank briefly worked with Die Laughing Records in 2019 and played various shows from 2015 through 2020, pausing due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Sleeping Dogs 
As of 2021 Wank created a spin-off project called Sleeping Dogs that includes the members of Wank with the addition of Keyboardist George Hughes -  with both groups led by bassist and vocalist Bobby Amodeo. Sleeping Dogs' sound isn't significantly different from Wank, which makes sense considering the two bands share four members. Their debut song and video "No Mercy" was released in November 2021.
