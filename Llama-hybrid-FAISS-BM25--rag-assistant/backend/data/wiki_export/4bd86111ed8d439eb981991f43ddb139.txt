Näsbypark is a district in Täby Municipality, north of Stockholm, Sweden.

Geography 
Näsbypark is located in the extreme southeastern part of the municipality next to Stora Värtan, an inlet of the Baltic Sea. It is bordered to the north by the neighbourhood of Viggbyholm and to the west by the neighbourhoods of Roslags Näsby and Näsbydal, which are separated from Näsbypark by the E18 motorway. To the south, Näsbypark is bordered by the neighbourhood of Lahäll, with the Sågtorpsvägen road generally defined as the border between the two.

History 
The name Näsbypark derives from the former park at Näsby Manor, which was designed by Nicodemus Tessin the Elder. The manor was totally demolished by a fire in 1897 and was rebuilt in 1902 by Carl Robert Lamm. Today, Näsby manor is a conference center.

The neighbourhood is characterized by detached houses mainly built between 1940-1970.
