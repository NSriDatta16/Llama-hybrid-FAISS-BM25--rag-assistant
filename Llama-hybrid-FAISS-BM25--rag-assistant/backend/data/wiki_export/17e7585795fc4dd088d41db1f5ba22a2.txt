Live Phish Vol. 4 was recorded live at the Drum Logos club in Fukuoka, Japan on June 14, 2000.

At the time, Phish was one of the biggest live bands in America, consistently selling out amphitheaters and arenas. However, in Japan, the shows were smaller and much more intimate than the usual Phish concert. The overall mood of the music at the Fukuoka show was quiet and mellow. Most of the second set was tied together with extended excursions into quiet, ambient improvisation, especially on the half-hour version of "Twist." The audience remains dead silent through most of the band's performances but erupts at the end of each song.

Users of Phish.net, the largest and quasi-official Phish fan website, rank the June 14, 2000 concert as the sixteenth highest rated concert in the band's history. The concert is usually the highest rated Phish show on the website that was performed outside of the United States.

The release reached a peak position of #127 on the Billboard 200 chart.
