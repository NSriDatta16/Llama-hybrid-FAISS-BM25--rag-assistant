Commentaries on Living: From the notebooks of J. Krishnamurti is a series of books by Jiddu Krishnamurti (1895–1986). It consists of 3 volumes, originally published in 1956, 1958 and 1960.

About the series
During the 1930s and 1940s Krishnamurti was intermittently keeping notes of his philosophical observations, his inner states, his musings about nature, and his discussions with individuals and groups. Aldous Huxley, a longtime friend of his (they first met in 1938), encouraged him to continue writing, and to eventually publish the notes. The resulting series of books, subtitled "From the notebooks of J. Krishnamurti", was edited by Krishnamurti associate Rajagopal Desikacharya (commonly D. Rajagopal).
