The Iron Range Yellow Jackets were a Junior "B" ice hockey team from Coleraine, Minnesota, United States. This defunct hockey team was a part of the Minnesota Junior Hockey League and an interleague member of the Junior "A" Superior International Junior Hockey League.

History
The Yellow Jackets played in the MNJHL from 1999 until 2002. Iron Range won the regular season title and playoff championship all three seasons. During their first two seasons the Yellow Jackets played home games at Hodgins-Berardo Arena in Coleraine.

Iron Range played in two USA Hockey Junior B National Tournament championship games, coming up just short both times. The Jackets attempted to win the title in their first season, but lost in overtime to the Ventura Mariners 5-4. In 2000-01 the Yellow Jackets traveled to the east coast and again were a goal short, losing to 5-4 to the Connecticut Clippers.

During that final 2001-02 season they called the IRA Civic Center in Grand Rapids home and doubled their schedule by competing in the SIJHL in the Thunder Bay, region of Ontario, Canada.

In July 2002 the Yellow Jackets suspended operations in hopes of returning in 2003-04. Head Coach Eric Ballard was named coach of the Northwest Wisconsin Knights for the 2002-03 season.
