The Liga Premier is the third tier of football in Mexico within the Mexican football league system that governs Serie A and Serie B leagues/group competitions. They compete from the fall to spring each season, promotion and relegation between each group, and promotion to Liga de Expansión MX and relegation to Liga TDP within the league system.

History 
The 1993–94 season Segunda  División champion was the last to be promoted to the Primera División. In 1994–95 season, the Mexican Football Federation created the "Primera División A" (renamed Ascenso MX in 2012) with 15 teams from the Segunda División, and all other teams remained in the league that continued to be called 'Segunda División' (Second Division) but at the new third tier of the Mexican football league system.

Each season has Segunda División teams divided into geographic zones with matches predominantly among the teams of that group. Each season had one tournament.

In 2008, the Mexican Football Federation, with the approval of the chairmen of the clubs in the Second and Third tiers, change the format of the league dividing the number of teams into two divisions, the Liga Premier de Ascenso (Promotional Premier League) and the Liga de Nuevos Talentos (League of New Talents). Each of the new leagues was divided into geographic groups. The winning club could earn promotion to Primera División A, renamed Liga de Ascenso in 2009, provided their stadium and financial stability met the licensing requirements of Liga de Ascenso. From 2011 and 2016, no teams were relegated to Liga Premier, although Pumas Morelos was to be relegated in 2013 but they dissolved before they could play in the lower league. Promotion still occurred during these years provided the club was licensed to participate. In June 2016, Ascenso MX announced they would resume relegating teams. Since that year only Loros UdeC (2017) and Murciélagos F.C. (2018) were relegated from the upper level.

In 2020 Ascenso MX became a U-23 league with some players over 23 as reinforcements, the new league was called Liga de Expansión MX, two Liga Premier teams were invited to the new category: Tepatitlán F.C. and Tlaxcala F.C., teams who had won their promotion in 2016 and 2018 but were rejected in the second level for not meeting the requirements to participate. Since that year, the requirements to be admitted to the second level have been tightened, so only one team, Alacranes de Durango, could be promoted in 2022, although it only remained in the Liga de Expansión for one year.

Rebranding 

In June 2017, Segunda División announced a rebranding of the league. Instead of being referred to as the Second Division they would be called Liga Premier (Premier League). The league would continue to have two divisions, however these new divisions would be called Serie A de México and Serie B de México. Serie A which would have independent teams as well as the affiliate teams of the higher level leagues in Mexico, Liga MX and Liga de Expansión MX, while Serie B would only have independent teams.

Promotion and relegation would be formalized between the leagues. Serie A would promote one club to Liga de Expansión MX. Additionally, one Serie B club could promote to Serie A and one club would be relegated from Serie A each year. Finally, and four clubs would be promoted from Liga TDP provided they meet the Serie requirements of Article 57.

Current structure
