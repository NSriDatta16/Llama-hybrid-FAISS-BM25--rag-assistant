Eurovision Song Contest

Performance
On the night of the final the Ingmanns performed 8th in the running order, following  and preceding . It was sung by Grethe Ingmann and accompanied by Jørgen Ingmann on guitar.

John Kennedy O'Connor writes "the hypnotic tune was helped by the visual effects in the studio as a spinning vortex of whirling shapes spun around the screen, adding to the dream-like effect of the music.  It was the only song that relied entirely on visual rather than physical props and this helped it stand out".

Controversy
The pre-contest betting had suggested a two-horse race between Denmark and Switzerland, and the two songs quickly separated themselves from the pack in the early rounds of voting, which was done by each national jury awarding 5-4-3-2-1 to their top 5 songs.  Host Katie Boyle then contacted Norway, the fifth jury due to vote, and the Norwegian spokesman clearly and confidently announced their votes as 5 to the , 4 to , 3 to Switzerland, 2 to Denmark and 1 to .  However, as the spokesman had not given the results in the required format (by firstly giving the performance number of the song), Boyle asked him to repeat the votes.  This appeared to confuse him, and Boyle agreed that to avoid any delay, they would come back to the Norwegian jury after all the other countries had voted.

After the last scheduled jury in  had given their votes, Switzerland was ahead of Denmark by 39 points to 38.  Had the votes originally announced by Norway been allowed to stand, Switzerland would have won by 42 points to 40.  Boyle then went back to the spokesman in Oslo who now announced 5 to the United Kingdom, 4 to Denmark, 3 to Italy, 2 to Germany and 1 to Switzerland, giving the victory to Denmark by 2 points.  In response to the controversy which followed the show, the European Broadcasting Union investigated the role of the Norwegian jury and concluded that there was no evidence of wrongdoing, with the confusion arising from misunderstandings.  Notwithstanding, an element of suspicion has hung over the 1963 result ever since and it remains, along with 1968, the most contentious contest outcome in Eurovision history.

"Dansevise" has a very high reputation in Eurovision circles.  The song often features prominently in polls to determine the best Eurovision winners, and is cited as one of the best examples of a Eurovision winner which does not date and still holds wide appeal.
