The London Community Gospel Choir is Britain's first renowned contemporary "performance touring, inspirational gospel choir band", fusing gospel with multi-genres of music, including pop, soul, jazz, R&B, and classical. It was founded in 1982 and has performed with people including Justin Timberlake, Madonna, Gorillaz, and Kylie Minogue.

History
The London Community Gospel Choir was founded in 1982 by the Reverend Bazil Meade, with Lawrence Johnson, Delroy Powell, and John Francis. Francis would later go onto form The Inspirational Choir of the Pentecostal First Born Church of the Living God.

Initially, the idea was for a single concert, and this was staged by a 120-strong choir before an audience of more than a thousand people. The one-off event gave rise to a permanent choir, performing internationally for over 25 years.

The success of the first event led to enquiries for the choir to appear on television and radio and at various corporate functions across the United Kingdom and Europe. The choir debuted on television with a performance on Channel Four's Black on Black. In December 2003, The Guardian described the choir as "controversial, professional, energetic, inspiring and spirit-filled!"

The choir is known for its funk-flavoured gospel, swing-beat, rhythm and blues, traditional, and soulful arrangements, with lively choreography and vocal gymnastics.

Recordings
The choir recorded a version of the OutKast song "Hey Ya!" with Razorlight (the B-side to their single "Vice"), featured on Will Young's debut album From Now On, and sang on Blur's hit, "Tender". They also provided backing vocals on Erasure's 1995 self-titled album, and throughout the Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds double album Abattoir Blues/The Lyre of Orpheus (2005). They also performed on the songs "Don't Get Lost in Heaven" and "Demon Days" on Gorillaz' Demon Days album. The choir has also recorded with Paul McCartney, Elton John, Westlife, Elkie Brooks, Tori Amos, Drumsound and Bassline Smith, Madonna, Paper Route, Dermot Kennedy, Gregory Porter, The 1975, and Brockhampton.

The choir recorded the backing track for "Circle of Life", as part of the original motion picture soundtrack to The Lion King, which went on to be nominated for the Best Original Song at the 1995 Academy Awards. They also made a guest vocal appearance on Billie Piper's hit song "Honey to the Bee".

The Edge of LCGC, a branch of the choir, released a limited-edition album, Keep Moving, as part of their yearly five-night residency at London's Jazz Caf√©. The full version was released in Spring 2008.

In 2009, the choir recorded a charity single named "I Got Soul" for War Child. In October 2009, this single reached #10 in the UK Singles Chart, giving the London Community Gospel Choir its first top ten hit.

The choir featured on the Artists for Grenfell charity single "Bridge Over Troubled Water" in 2017.

They have also collaborated with the pop group The 1975 on the track, Nothing Revealed / Everything Denied in 2020, on their 4th studio album. 

They collaborated with Beverley Knight on several tracks on her ninth studio album The Fifth Chapter in 2023.
