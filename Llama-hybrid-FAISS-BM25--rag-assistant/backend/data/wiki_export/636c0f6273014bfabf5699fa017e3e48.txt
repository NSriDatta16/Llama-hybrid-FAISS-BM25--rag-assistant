Toad River Hot Springs Provincial Park is a provincial park in the north of British Columbia, Canada.  The hot springs are located on the lefthand bank of the Toad River, outside of the Racing River outflow. The area is rugged and remote, accessible only via hiking, riverboat, horseback, or helicopter. There is no actual bathing pool; visitors are advised to not attempt bathing, as heavy mud is a strong presence in the area. Entrance to this area is very difficult, with the crossing of private property being a likely factor, unless accessed by boat or air. Land access is most easily accomplished by horse or by hiking from the Stone Mountain Safaris parking lot. It is recommended that the lodge owners are contacted and made aware of any human presence in the area beforehand. They are very friendly and will always give advice as to how to traverse the areaâ€™s wilderness.

The park is part of the larger Muskwa-Kechika Management Area.
