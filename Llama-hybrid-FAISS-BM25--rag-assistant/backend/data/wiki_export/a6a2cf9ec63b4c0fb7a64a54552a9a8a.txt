History
The Department of Management Studies is a result of the revolutionary process of growth of an idea floated in 1963. What was then a seed, gradually came to life and in 1974 IIT Delhi set up an internal committee to scrutinize the functioning of the management area in the institute. In 1975, an expert committee was set up to formally examine the possibility of launching this area in a more sustained fashion. The result was an M.Tech programme in "Management Systems" in the School for System Studies (subsequently renamed School for Systems and Management Studies). The year 1978 saw the setting up of the Management Core Group and the core inputs to a full-time Management Education at IIT(D) were reconfirmed by an Advisory Committee constituted by the representatives of the Academia and the industry. Dr Vinayshil Gautam served as the first head of the department. The School for Systems and Management Studies became the Centre for Systems and Management Studies. This was subsequently renamed as the Centre for Management Studies.

In 1993 the Department was brought into existence by amendment to IIT(D) statutes. Clearly, the Department responds to a felt need of the Indian Industry and derives satisfaction from its heavy field orientation in all its curriculum activity.
