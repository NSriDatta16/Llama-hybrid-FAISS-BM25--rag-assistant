Didling is a small village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Elsted and Treyford, in the Chichester district of West Sussex, England. It lies on the Treyford to Bepton road 3.5 miles (5.7 km) south-west of Midhurst. In 1931 the parish had a population of 99. On 1 April 1933 the parish was abolished and merged with Treyford.

Church
The c.13th century church of St Andrew, known as "The Shepherds' Church", sits a little to the south of the village on the northern slope of Didling Hill. The nave and chancel are of plastered rubble with ashlar dressings. The wooden porch is modern. The church has a single bell dated 1587. The church is known for its simplicity and the fact that it has survived the intervening centuries with very little restoration, with that which has taken place having been sympathetic. Without an electricity supply the church is lit by candles.
