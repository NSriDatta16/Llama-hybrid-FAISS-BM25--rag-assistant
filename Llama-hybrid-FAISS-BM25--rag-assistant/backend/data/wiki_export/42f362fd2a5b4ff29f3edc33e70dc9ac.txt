The highest level of provincial rugby union in Australia is Super Rugby. There are five Australian teams in this competition, which also features teams from New Zealand and Fiji.

Australia currently has no national club competition. The first attempt at such a competition, the Australian Rugby Championship, was launched in 2007 with eight teams, but lasted only one season before the nation's governing body, the Australian Rugby Union (now Rugby Australia), decided to discontinue the competition due to financial losses. The second and most recent attempt at forming a national domestic league, the National Rugby Championship, was launched in 2014 with nine teams and lasted six years until it was disbanded in 2020. The current top level competitions in Australia are the Shute Shield in Sydney and the Queensland Premier League in Brisbane. Numerous club and representative competitions serve the rugby playing community below these two competitions.

City-United Historical note:  During the 1994 pre-season, it became clear that neither United nor Armidale City would have enough players to field four grades or be competitive. Given that quite a few of City's squad were former United players, NERU Secretary and former United President Dick Croft encouraged the two clubs to join forces, and City United was born. The new club competed strongly for the next eight years before merging with Armidale Old Boys for the 2002 season. This resulted in the new Armidale Blues Rugby Club, which combines the history and tradition of City, the professionalism and competitiveness of Old Boys, and the spirit and student depth of United.
