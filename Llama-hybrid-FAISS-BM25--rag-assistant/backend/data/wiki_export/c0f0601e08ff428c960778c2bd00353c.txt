"Nobody's Supposed to Be Here" is a song by Canadian recording artist Deborah Cox, released as the lead single from her second studio album, One Wish (1998). Written by Montell Jordan and its producer, Anthony "Shep" Crawford, the song was released on the same day as the album, on September 15, 1998, by Arista Records. It is Cox's most successful song, peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 for eight weeks and spending a then-record 14 weeks at number one on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. In 2017, Billboard ranked the song at number five on its "Greatest of All Time Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs" chart.

Critical reception
Larry Flick of Billboard wrote, "Cox previews her second album with a stirring old-school soul ballad that's perhaps the best vocal showcase she's ever had. The groove cruises at a languid, finger-poppin' jeep pace, giving her plenty of room to get down and dirty, vamping as if she's lived every syllable of the song's tale of a love fraught with drama. Justice prevailing, pop and R&B radio programmers will find this a refreshing change of pace from the saccharine ballads currently glutting the airwaves. And if they don't, they'll have Hex Hector's wholly accessible uptempo dance reconstruction to embrace. It's easily among the best efforts of the young remixer's career. In all, this is a fine single hinting that Cox is about to pay off on all of the promise and hype generated by her first album two years ago."

Commercial performance
The song reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100 in the week of December 5, 1998, and remained there for eight consecutive weeks. It was held from the top spot by R. Kelly and Celine Dion's  'I'm Your Angel' (for six weeks) and Brandy's 'Have You Ever?' (for two weeks), making it one of the longest stays at number two in Billboard history. The song ranked at number nine on the Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1999.

The song reached number one on Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs in the week of November 7, 1998, and remained there for a then-record-breaking 14 weeks. This record was tied by Mariah Carey in 2005 with her song "We Belong Together", and then broken by Mary J. Blige in 2006 with "Be Without You", which spent 15 weeks at number one. During this period, "Nobody's Supposed to Be Here" held four Hot 100 number-one singles out of the top position: "Doo Wop (That Thing)" by Lauryn Hill (three weeks), "Lately" by Divine (two weeks), the aforementioned "Have You Ever?" (four weeks), and "Angel of Mine" by Monica (one week), as well as the number seven-peaking "Love Like This" by Faith Evans (three weeks). The song ranked at number two on the Billboard Year-End R&B/Hip-Hop Songs of 1999 and at number five on the Greatest of All Time Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.

The song was remixed by dance music producer Hex Hector, and peaked at number one on the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart in the week of October 24, 1998. As of 1999, the song has sold 1,900,000 copies in the United States and has been certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).
