The Bera District is a district in southwestern Pahang, Malaysia, bordering Negeri Sembilan and Johor.

Background
Bera district was founded on January 1, 1992, detaching it from Temerloh District. Once considered as problematic area (illegal land exploration), Bera emerged as an important district especially in the agriculture sector.

Etymology
The district got its name from Malaysia's largest freshwater lake, Tasik Bera. According to the Orang Asli of the Semelai tribe, Bera derived its name from a type of seaweed known as Reba.

When the northern part of the district was ruled by one of the nine founding chiefdoms of Negeri Sembilan, it was known as "Ulu Pahang" (the back part of Pahang).

Geography
Located in the south-western corner of Pahang, the district borders Temerloh District and Maran District on the north, Rompin District on the east, Bentong District on the west, Jempol District of Negeri Sembilan on the south-west and Segamat District of Johor on the south-east. 

Bera district is known for Bera Lake, a freshwater lake and its surrounding wetlands, that has been protected under the Ramsar Convention since November 1994.

The major towns in Bera are Bandar Bera and Teriang. Other towns include Mengkuang, Kemayan, Kerayong and Mengkarak.

From the south, KTM tracks enter Pahang state via this constituency, stopping at Kemayan, Triang and Mengkarak stations.
