The Chick Evans Field House is a 6,000-seat multi-purpose arena in DeKalb, Illinois, USA. The arena opened in 1956 and was home to the Northern Illinois University Huskies basketball team prior to the 2002 opening of the Convocation Center. It was named in honor of longtime NIU athletic director George “Chick” Evans. The building is now used for recreation, housing basketball, indoor soccer, and floor hockey. It is also the base of operations for the university's ROTC program. In addition some smaller-scale events, such as organizational expos by the Student Association, are still held here.
