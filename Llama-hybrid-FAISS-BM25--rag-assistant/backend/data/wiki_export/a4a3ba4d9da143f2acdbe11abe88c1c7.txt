Alex Sánchez Cruz (born July 20, 1930) is a former Costa Rican football player.

Biography 
He was born in Naranjo in Costa Rica's, Alajuela province. Sánchez started his soccer career at the early age of 10 playing in the Minor League for the Deportivo Saprissa. He started by training twice a day with the club and soon advanced to playing full-time. In 1945 he started in the first ever National Youth Championship, where he won a national title for the first time in his career.

By 1946 Saprissa had ascended to the Juvenile Division and Alex had become the starting goalkeeper. Saprissa won the Championship in the new division by beating the Liga Deportiva Alajuelense in a best-of-three series. The Championship allowed the Deportivo Saprissa, the Minor League branch of a Major League team named Orion F.C., to ascend to the Major Division. The team was renamed Orion F.C. and Sánchez was moved into the position of left wingback. He remained in this position until his retirement.

In 1947 Sánchez played in the Third Division for the newly renamed Orion F.C. and again was part of the team that won the Championship. This continued success prompted Ricardo Saprissa, the team's co-founder and namesake, to register the team in the Third Division of the Major League. That same year the Orion F.C. won the Championship, thus advancing to the Second Division, where the team was renamed back to the Deportivo Saprissa. The next season, the Deportivo Saprissa advanced one last time to the Primera Division, Costa Rica's top soccer league. Sánchez was part of the team that won the first three National Championship sin Costa Rica's top league in 1952, 1953 and 1957.
