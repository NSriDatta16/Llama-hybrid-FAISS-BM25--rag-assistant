Banks Course 
The Banks Course was created by Charles “Steamshovel” Banks in 1931. The historic Banks Course was designed by Charles H. Banks, one of America's celebrated "Golden Age" architects. Regarded as an architectural gem, the "traditional" design of the Banks Course features many holes inspired by some of the legendary Scottish courses, as well as Banks' signature steep and dramatic greenside bunkers. The course is consistently ranked as a MET Top 50 Golf course [2] and "Best in State" by Golf Digest.

Banks Course Featured Hole 12 
This Horseshoe completely surrounded by bunkers, this par three is a copy of many elevated short holes in Scotland. "Buried elephants" is one way to describe the horseshoe-shaped undulation.

Palmer Course 
The scenic Palmer Course, which includes holes designed by Arnold Palmer, features water hazards on 10 of its holes and is enjoyable for golfers of all skill levels. Originally created by Hal Purdy in 1961, but redesigned in 1995 by the Arnold Palmer Group and again in 2007 by Steven Kay.
