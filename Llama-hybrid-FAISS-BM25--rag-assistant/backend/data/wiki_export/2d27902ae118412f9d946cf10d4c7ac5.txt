Tyrus Wayne Thomas (born August 17, 1986) is an American former professional basketball player. He played college basketball for Louisiana State University (LSU) before being drafted fourth overall by the Portland Trail Blazers in the 2006 NBA draft. He was then traded to the Chicago Bulls where he went on to play three and a half seasons when in February 2010, he was traded to the Charlotte Bobcats.

High school career
As a 5'10" freshman, Thomas tried out for his varsity basketball team but was cut. He only played organized basketball in his last two years at McKinley High School in Baton Rouge, but never really built up enough recruiting hype to be considered a top 100 prospect. As a junior, he was a mere  and , and when he officially committed to LSU, the school did not initially have a scholarship for him. One later opened up when a JUCO recruit was kicked off LSU's team and saw his scholarship offer rescinded. By senior year, Thomas had grown to , . As a senior, Tyrus averaged 16 points, 12 rebounds and six blocks per game, earning him all-second team honors in Louisiana.

College career
As a redshirted freshman at LSU in 2005–06, Thomas was the team's starting power forward, and because of his leaping ability, he developed a reputation as an outstanding shot blocker, rebounder and dunker. He was named the SEC Freshman of the Year after averaging 12.3 points, 9.2 rebounds and 3.1 blocks in 32 games (22 starts) while shooting over 60% from the field. Thomas was also recognized as the NCAA Atlanta Region MVP in the NCAA Tournament after combining for 30 points against the likes of Duke and Texas.

2006 NCAA Tournament
Thomas entered the 2006 NCAA Tournament still recovering from a sprained ankle suffered in the February 26 game against Kentucky that caused him to miss the last two regular season games and the SEC Tournament. However, the injury did not hamper him as he continued the pattern of the regular season, his performances in the 2006 NCAA Tournament improved with every passing game as #4 seed LSU advanced to their first Final Four since 1986. His minutes were somewhat limited by the injury in the first-round game against No. 13 seed Iona and the second-round game against No. 12 seed Texas A&M but he was back to form by LSU's Atlanta Regional semi-final (Sweet 16) matchup against perennial power and overall top seed Duke. In the Duke game, Thomas recorded 9 points, 13 rebounds and 5 blocks despite being limited to 25 minutes due to early foul trouble as LSU held Duke to a 27.7 percent field goal percentage and only 54 points, the school's lowest output since 1996. Thomas was even more dominant in the Regional Final (Elite Eight) win against No. 2 seed Texas, recording 21 points, 13 rebounds and 3 blocks. These performances earned Thomas the Atlanta Regional's Most Valuable Player award.
