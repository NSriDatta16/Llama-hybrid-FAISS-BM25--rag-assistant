The temple is built in such a way that the sun rays fall on the feet of the God, twice in a year in the months of February and June in the early hours of the day. All Sundays during the five months starting with 'Magha Nakshatra' are considered sacred.

Idols of Aditya, Ambica, Vishnu, Ganesha and Maheswara representing different faiths have been installed in one place.

The Sun God is depicted riding over a chariot drawn by seven horses driven by Anurudu, the Ratha Sarathi. It has been exquisitely carved out of a single black granite stone.
