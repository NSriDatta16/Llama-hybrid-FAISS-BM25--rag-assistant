Lambhouse: The Collection 1991–1998 is Unsane's second compilation album, released in 2003 through Relapse Records. It is a CD/DVD greatest hits compilation and collection of live and promotional videos by the band.

Reception

Eduardo Rivadavia from Allmusic said about the album: "Over the course of 24 devastating tracks drawn from each of the band's landmark albums, one is sucked right into Unsane's despairing world of pain [...] The DVD portion of this set is perhaps even more impressive, as it offers another 23 clips culled from Unsane's decade-plus run."
