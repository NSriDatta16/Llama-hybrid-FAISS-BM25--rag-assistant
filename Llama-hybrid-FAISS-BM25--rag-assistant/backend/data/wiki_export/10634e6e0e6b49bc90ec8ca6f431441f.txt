Allison Curbishley (born 3 June 1976) is a former British athlete from Stockton-on-Tees but who represented Scotland. She specialised in the 400m. A play scheme in the summer holiday when she was ten years old got Curbishley interested in sport and although athletics was the sport she eventually chose she also reached county standard in netball and field hockey.

She graduated from the University of Birmingham with a degree in Sport and Exercise Sciences. During her career her knee was operated on six times, and the injury finally led to her retirement in 2003. She is now working in broadcasting for the BBC and her partner is fellow BBC commentator Steve Cram with whom she lives in Northumberland.
