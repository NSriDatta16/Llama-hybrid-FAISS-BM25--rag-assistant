Dan Lewis (born December 19, 1949) is a former long-time co-anchor and reporter for KOMO-TV in Seattle, Washington.

He came to KOMO-TV in 1987 after working at WJLA-TV in Washington, D.C. Before that, he had worked at WISN-TV, WITI-TV, WLKY-TV, KTBS-TV and KWKH. His career began at WBIG (AM) after graduating from Southern Illinois University Carbondale. 

Alongside his co-anchor and reporter Kathi Goertzen, weather forecaster Steve Pool and sports reporter Eric Johnson, they were the third longest-running tenure out of any anchor team in the United States west of the Mississippi River. Until his retirement in 2014, Lewis served as co-anchor for the weekday editions of KOMO 4 News at 6:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. with Mary Nam. After multiple surgeries for aggressive recurring meningiomas, Goertzen died on August 13, 2012.

In 2002, Lewis and several other KOMO-TV staff members made cameo appearances in the movie Life or Something Like It, which starred Angelina Jolie and Edward Burns. He also briefly appeared in the remake of the 1984 film Red Dawn starring Chris Hemsworth, Josh Peck, Josh Hutcherson, Adrianne Palicki, Isabel Lucas, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan.
