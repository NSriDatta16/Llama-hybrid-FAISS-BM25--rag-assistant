The Green Room Awards are peer awards which recognise excellence in Cabaret, Dance, Theatre Companies, Independent Theatre, Musical Theatre, Contemporary and Experimental Performance and Opera in Melbourne.

The awards were started in 1982 when Blair Edgar and Steven Tandy formed the Green Room Awards Association. The inaugural awards ceremony was held in 1984 at the Melbourne Concert Hall. The association today is composed of members of Melbourne's performing arts community, including journalists, performers, writers, directors, choreographers, academics, theatre technicians and administrators.

The current patron of the association is Dr Liz Jones AO. Former patrons include Uncle Jack Charles, Rachel Griffiths and David Atkins. Previous winners include Dale Ferguson, David Hersey, Stephen Baynes, Greg Horsman, Eddie Perfect, Laurie Cadevida, Stephen Daldry, Genevieve Lemon, Michael Dameski, Julian Gavin, and Steve Mouzakis.

As at April 2023, the President of the Association is Anton Berezin, Vice President Dean Drieberg, Secretary Weng Yi Wong and Treasurer Emily Harvey.

The 2023 Ceremony, the Association's 40th, took place at Melbourne's Capitol Theatre to a sell-out audience on May 29, 2023.
