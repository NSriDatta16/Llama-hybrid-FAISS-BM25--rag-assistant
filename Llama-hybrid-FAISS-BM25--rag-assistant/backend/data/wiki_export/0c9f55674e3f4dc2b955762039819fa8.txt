The Acolin () is a  long river in France. It is a left tributary of the Loire, which it meets near Decize. It flows through the departments of Allier and Nièvre.

Course
The Acolin has its source south of the town of Mercy (Allier) in a wooded area covered with many ponds. The source is some  south-east of Moulins. Its basin drains the area between the lower reaches of the Allier in the west and the Besbre to the east. Like its neighbors, it maintains a northerly direction, for more than  and eventually empties into the Loire near the town of Avril-sur-Loire, just downstream from Decize.
