Heat Wave, also known as Heatwave, is a professional wrestling event currently produced by WWE for its developmental brand, NXT. It was originally a pay-per-view event produced by Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) that took place annually from 1994 to 2000. ECW folded in 2001 and WWE acquired its assets in 2003. In 2022, WWE revived the Heat Wave name for NXT, but stylized as Heatwave, and it has since been held as an annual television special of NXT. The event's name is a reference to it being held in the summer as all events have been held in either July or August.
