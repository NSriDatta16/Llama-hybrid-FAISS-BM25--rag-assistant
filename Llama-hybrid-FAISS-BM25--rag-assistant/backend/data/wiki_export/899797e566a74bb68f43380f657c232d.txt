The Goulburn Valley Football Netball League is an Australian rules football and netball competition based in the Goulburn Valley region of Victoria, Australia. It is a member of the Victorian Country Football League and has won the Victorian Country Football Championships in 2003 and 2005.

History
The league was initially called the Goulburn Valley District Football Association (GVDFA) and dates back to May, 1893. Clubs from the townships of Kyabram, Mooroopna, Nagambie, Nathalia, Numurkah, Shepparton, Shepparton Ramblers, Tatura, Undera and Wunghnu were present at the inaugural meeting. The five original clubs that made up the 1893 GVDFA draw were – Kyabram, Mooroopna, Shepparton, Shepparton Ramblers and Tatura with Mooroopna playing the Shepparton Ramblers in the 1893 GVDFA grand final.

Later clubs from Rushworth, Murchison, Tongala and Echuca would spend time in this league.

At the 1914 – GVDFA – Annual General Meeting, the club delegate's voted to change the name of the competition to the Goulburn Valley Football League to save a lot of confusion with another local football competition, the Goulburn Valley Football Association, which was based out of Numurkah, which was made up from club's in the northern Goulburn Valley region.

Between 1926 and 1936, there was a Goulburn Valley Second Eighteens Football Association competition that was based in and around Shepparton, that was superseded by the Goulburn Valley Football Association in 1937.

Prior to World War II this league used to play on Wednesday afternoon, but in 1939 the league decided to change to Saturday afternoon, Shepparton and Mooroopna objected and refused to play on Saturdays so both clubs went into recess.

In 1995 the league absorbed the clubs from the Tungamah Football League and had a second division for three seasons (1996–1998). These second division clubs left and formed the Central Goulburn Football League in 1999. This league ceased in 2005.
