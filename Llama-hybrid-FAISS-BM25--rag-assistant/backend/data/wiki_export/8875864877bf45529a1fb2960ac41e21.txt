The Rafflesia Forest Reserve is a Virgin Jungle Reserve (VJR) that covers an area of 356 ha of Tambunan District, Sabah, Malaysia. The forest was first established in 1967 as part of the Crocker Range Forest Reserve. In 1984, it was re-established by the Sabah Forestry Department to protect the Rafflesia flowers abundant in the area.

The Rafflesia Information Centre is located directly along the road from Kota Kinabalu to Tambunan, and is a popular location for tourists. Several sites with wild specimen of Rafflesia pricei are reachable via hiking trails from the centre.
