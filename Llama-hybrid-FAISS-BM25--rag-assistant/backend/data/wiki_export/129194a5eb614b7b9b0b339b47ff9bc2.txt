History
This walled town has existed since Roman times when it was known as Sidolocus (or Sedelocus), as seen on the tombs and engravings that can be found in the hills overlooking the modern town. Every Saturday morning a unique market is held in the square selling goods of many kinds.

Church
The Basilica of Saint Andoche, noted for its west portal and carved capitals depicting biblical stories and religious teachings, was founded as an abbey church in the 6th century. Rebuilt as a collegiate church in the 12th century, it became a Minor Basilica in 1919.

There are over 60 carved capitals in the basilica, several of which have narrative figures. Some of the capitals are the Flight into Egypt (Matthew 2:13-15), Balaam (Numbers 23-24), The Risen Christ (John 20:11-18; Matthew 28:1-10), Temptation of Christ (Mt 4:1-11; Mk 1:12-13; Lk 4:1-13) and the capital of the "Cockfight in the south arcade, fourth pier (facing the aisle)".
