Oneida Baptist Institute (OBI) is a coeducational Southern Baptist boarding school in Oneida, Kentucky, affiliated with the Kentucky Baptist Convention.

History
Oneida Baptist Institute was founded by James Anderson Burns with the intent of bringing an end to the culture of feuds and violence in Clay County, Kentucky.  Burns aimed "to teach the children of the hostile clans to love each other and not fight," believing that a combination of education and Christian love would cause their feuds to "stop automatically." With the help of H. L. McMurray, a Baptist preacher originally from Kansas, Burns selected a site for the school and recruited members of the warring clans to work together to build it. The founder was correct and the collaborative efforts of many in starting the school put an end to the feuding in the area.

The first building was completed in 1899 and classes began on January 1, 1900, with four teachers and 125 students.

The current president is Larry Allen Gritton Jr., who has been president since mid-2013.

Incidents

In February 2020, the parents of a Kentucky teenager filed a lawsuit against Oneida Baptist Institute. The lawsuit alleges their 13-year-old son was sexually assaulted by a 17-year-old student. The 17-year-old offender was expelled from the school for this violation of the younger student. The court case is still pending a ruling as of October 6, 2023.
