Production
There had long been interest in making a film out of the novel. In the 1960s it was announced that Joshua Logan would direct a movie version starring Elizabeth Taylor but this did not come to pass. Film rights to the novel were bought by Jill Robb who hired Mike Jenkins to adapt the screenplay and Carl Schultz to direct. Funding was obtained from the New South Wales Film Corporation among others.

After an extensive search, Nicholas Gledhill, son of actor Arthur Dignam was cast as PS.

The film was shot in and around Sydney, mostly in Neutral Bay and Darling Point. The Hordern Family garden and mansion, Babworth House, in Darling Point was used in filming.

Box office
Careful, He Might Hear You grossed $2,431,126 at the box office in Australia. The movie also enjoyed a successful release in North America.

Home media
A Collector's Edition of Careful, He Might Hear You was released on DVD with a new print by Umbrella Entertainment in June 2008.
