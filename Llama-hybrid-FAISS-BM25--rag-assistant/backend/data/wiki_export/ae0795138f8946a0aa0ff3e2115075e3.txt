History
KMYZ-FM signed on the air in 1969 as KKMA, a country music station located in downtown Pryor, Oklahoma. In the late '70s, the country format was dropped for album rock. KMYZ's studios moved to Tulsa in the early '80s and its format evolved to classic rock by 1985. It later changed to CHR/Adult Top-40 as "Z-104.5". The station started leaning towards a rock direction in its CHR format beating then crosstown CHR rival KAYI (Now KHTT). Airchecks of this timeframe can be found at http://www.edgetulsa.com. KMYZ-FM later evolved into a straight ahead Rock presentation to compete against crosstown Rocker KMOD-FM. On February 27, 1995, the station changed to a Modern rock/Alternative format as "Z-104.5 The Edge" which still airs to this day.
