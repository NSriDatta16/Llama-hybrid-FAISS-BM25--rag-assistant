The South East Australian Basketball League (SEABL) was a semi-professional basketball league in Australia comprising both a men's and women's competition. The SEABL began in 1981 and operated for 38 seasons until it was disbanded in 2018. The league was closely linked with the Australian Basketball Association (ABA) and over the years, the SEABL boasted teams from Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, Tasmania, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory.

History
The SEABL was established in 1981 as a men's league. Separate South and East conferences were introduced in 1986. In 1990, a women's competition was introduced. The league was closely linked with the Australian Basketball Association (ABA) during the 1980s and 1990s. In 2012, the women's competition was divided into two conferences for the first time.

In December 2014, Basketball Australia took over the operations of the SEABL. Less than four years later, in August 2018, Basketball Australia disbanded the SEABL after they withdrew its support of the league and denied the proposal of a club-managed league.

In October 2018, Basketball Victoria created a new senior elite league and later in partnership with the National Basketball League (NBL) produced the NBL1 which debuted in 2019.
