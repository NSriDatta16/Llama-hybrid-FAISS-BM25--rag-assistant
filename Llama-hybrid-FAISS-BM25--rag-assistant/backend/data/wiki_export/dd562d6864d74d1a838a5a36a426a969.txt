The Salvation Army Toronto Grace Health Centre is a 150-bed hospital located at 650 Church Street in Toronto, Ontario. Owned and operated by the Salvation Army, it specializes in palliative care, post-acute care rehabilitation, and complex continuing care.

Overview
Located on the corner of Church and Bloor Street in downtown Toronto, the six-storey facility was known as a maternity hospital up to the 1970s when the hospital closed its pregnancy ward. It was one of the first hospitals in Canada to introduce palliative care. It is now a rehabilitation and palliative care facility.

In 2002, the hospital underwent several renovations, meant to curb energy consumption, in associated with the Energy Innovators Initiative

The Salvation Army was prepared to close the hospital starting in February 2010 due to high upkeep costs, but a deal was struck between the Province and the Salvation Army to keep the hospital open.
