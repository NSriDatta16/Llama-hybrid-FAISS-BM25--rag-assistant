On September 26, 2017, Entercom (forerunner of Audacy) announced a divestment of three stations (KSOQ-FM, WGGI, and KSWD) to the Educational Media Foundation (EMF) as part of its merger with CBS Radio to comply with FCC ownership rules in the Wilkes Barre market; the FCC approved the sale of all three stations on November 2. The announcement stated that upon the closing of the acquisition, EMF would flip WGGI to its K-Love network which airs contemporary Christian music; parent station WGGY would remain unchanged. EMF changed WGGI's call sign to WKBP on November 16.
