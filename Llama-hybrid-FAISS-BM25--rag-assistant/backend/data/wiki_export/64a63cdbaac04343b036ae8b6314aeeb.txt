Background
This book for American boys in the late 19th century is filled with black & white illustrations and schematics. It gives instruction and advice on subjects ranging from kites, fishing, knots, telescopes, tents, soap bubbles, snowball warfare, puppets, kaleidoscopes, whirligigs, costumes, decoys and fireworks. There are many topics related to animals and wildlife—even including taxidermy and trapping. The projects range in complexity. From the very simple (like paper crafts), to the quite involved—such as boat construction.
