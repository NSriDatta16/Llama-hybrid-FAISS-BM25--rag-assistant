Philippians 2 is the second chapter of the Epistle to the Philippians in the New Testament of the Christian Bible. It is authored by Paul the Apostle about mid-50s to early 60s AD and addressed to the Christians in Philippi. Jesuit theologian Robert Murray notes that a narrative in verses 5-11 about Christ, "who humbled himself, by becoming obedient to death" is central to this chapter. German protestant theologian Ernst Lohmeyer argued in 1928 that  were an existing hymn about Christ which Paul quotes in his letter, a theory which "has come to dominate both exegesis of Philippians and study of early Christology and credal formulas".

Text
The original text was written in Koine Greek. Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are:
Codex Vaticanus (AD 325-350)
Codex Sinaiticus (330-360)
Codex Alexandrinus (400-440)
Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (~450; complete)
Codex Freerianus (~450; extant verses 1-3, 12-14, 25-27)
Codex Claromontanus (~550).

This chapter is divided into 30 verses.

Unity of minds and hearts (2:1–4)
This section centers on Paul's appeal for unity of minds and hearts among the people, which can be expressed by four phrases: two using the keyword phronein ("of the same mind" or "of one mind"), then agape ("love") and sumpsuchoi ("united in soul" or "being in full accord"). Maintaining his reference to the joy which Paul already feels in respect to the Philippians ( and ), he speaks of this joy being "made full, like a measure".

Verse 1
If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,
Meyer notes Paul's use of "four stimulative elements", which are assumed to apply and are not conditional. H. C. G. Moule notes that the word "bowels", as in the King James Version, was not used in any English version before 1582, and offers "tender mercies and compassions", as in the Revised Version (1881), as better wording: likewise the New International Version (1973 onwards) refers to "tenderness and compassion.

Christ as the focus and model for discipleship (2:5–11)
Following the exhortation in the earlier section, Christ is pointed as the model for discipleship, with a poetic narrative "beyond Paul's usual vocabulary", but not necessarily beyond his capacity.

Verse 5
Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus,
This verse uses the same word phronein ("mind") which Paul used at the start of this chapter.

Verse 6
 who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped

Verse 7
 but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. 
This verse was interpreted in the following way by the 18th-century Baptist theologian John Gill:
"Made Himself of no reputation" (KJV): or "nevertheless emptied himself"; he lost nothing of what he had, but the glory of his divine nature was covered and hid from the people so they reputed him as a mere man.
 "And took upon him the form of a servant" (KJV): voluntarily, was not obliged, or forced to be in the form of a servant, as was often prophesied in Isaiah 42:1; , Zechariah 3:8, also called in the Targum, "my servant the Messiah".
 "Likeness": from  homoiōma; "in the likeness of men", not the likeness of the first Adam, but of "sinful flesh", and was treated as a "sinner", although he was "equal to God".

Verse 8
 And being found in human form he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even death on a cross.

The Desired Response (2:12–18)
Based on Christ's example, Paul exhorts the people to "work out your own salvation... for it is God who is at work".

Timothy and Epaphroditus, Paul's Go-Betweens (2:19–30)
Two of Paul's helpers, Timothy and Epaphroditus, are introduced and the reasons for their journey are explained in this part, mainly to show Paul's affection to the people of Philippi.
