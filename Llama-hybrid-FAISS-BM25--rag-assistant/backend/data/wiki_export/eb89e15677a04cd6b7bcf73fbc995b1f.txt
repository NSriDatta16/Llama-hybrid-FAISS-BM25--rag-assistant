History

In 2001, a few months after the opening of the system, the Portal de Usme was opened as the second terminal station in the system.

After a lawsuit from a passenger complaining of lack of handicapped access on the feeder routes at the station, the fleet of feeder buses was renovated to accommodate this service in 2005.

On February 2, 2002, police thwarted an attempt to use dynamite against the station by disarming six sticks of the explosive.
