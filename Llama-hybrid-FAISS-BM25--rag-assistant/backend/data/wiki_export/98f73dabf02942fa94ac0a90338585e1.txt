|"South Sydney beat Eastern Suburbs On The Post"
"Quite 4000 people were present at the Agricultural Ground to witness this match which was a fine exposition of Northern Union rules. With only a few minutes to go South turned what seemed to be almost certain defeat into a highly meritorius victory. Their wonderful staying powers allowed them to secure the verdict by 14 points to 10."
     
At 3.25 Messenger led his side into the field. South followed a minute later. Messenger kicked off from the Randwick end. East secured a "free" almost immediately, but Messenger's effort, although a good one, did not secure the two points. South rallied, Davis putting in some effective work, but wild passing lost South a chance. The ever present Messenger then marked right in front of South's goal, this time making no mistake. East, 2 South nil. Play was even for a while, until Anderson secured, and made a dash for the line, but he was tackled by Messenger, and laid out for some minutes. A "knock-on" close to the line gave South a timely relief, but little ground was gained. Messenger was again in the limelight with a dodgy run, but he was tackled at the 25. Hot work in South's territory occurred until Conlin relieved. East were now playing like a book, and taking advantage of every opportunity. They obtained 6 points in as many minutes - the first two for a "free", the second two from a mark, and another "free", for offside making the six. Messenger's kicking was a revelation, the crowd cheering enthusiastically. The next item of interest, was some good work by the South's forwards, which brought the ball close to East's goal line, and from a scrum the ball came out to Rosewell, who raced over. Conlin failed to convert, the kick being a poor one. The interval arrived with the scores unaltered. Eastern Suburbs 8, South Sydney 3. On resuming East at once forced the pace, Messenger, and subsequently Frawley, making the efforts. The later was almost through when he was forced out at the corner. South then took a hand, a good passing bout (in which H Butler was the last to receive) resulting in South's total being increased to 6 points. Hallett failed to add the extras. Easts then became dangerous, Messenger being here, there and everywhere, rendering his side great assistance, as he seemed to be perfectly at home on both wings. On one occasion he "marked" in a good position whilst lying prostrate, but Frawley was not successful in his kick, the ball going a little wide. Play was uninteresting for a few minutes, the tackling of South still keeping at a high standard. Anderson tried to get through, but was not fast enough. Scrums became frequent, South being the first to initiate a passing movement in which all their threequarters participated, Anderson was grassed at halfway with only the fullback to beat. Off-side against the red and green gave Messenger another opportunity in the goal-potting line. It was his eighth kick at goal and his fifth success in the match, the ball sailing over beautifully. South then started to press, the passing showing great improvement. A brilliant run by Anderson, who skirted the line half the length of the field, ended in his securing a try. It was unconverted. The excitement was intense, and South were playing with wonderful heart. Time and again they swept down, and eventually Anderson again electrified the crowd by gathering in and rushing over. It was a grand try. Hallett converted. The whistle then blew, South winning a memorable contest by 14 points to 10.
