Geography
At the end of the ice age a deposit of stones is thought to have been left that runs through Atticall. This is known locally as the Stoney Rigg. The remains of this can be seen on Slieve Muck, and it is said to flow down to Green Castle.

The great spotted woodpecker, Ireland's newest breeding bird species, has been seen in Cnocnafeola Wood.
