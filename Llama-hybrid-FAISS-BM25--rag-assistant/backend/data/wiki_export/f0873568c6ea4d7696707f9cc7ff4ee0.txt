"Cave" is a song by English rock band Muse, released as the second single from their 1999 debut album Showbiz.

Content

Bellamy has given two statements about what "Cave" is about. Once he said it was about "an old friend of mine" in a strangely warbled voice before a live performance of the song and on a different occasion he stated "The idea for Cave came from that rubbish American book, Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus. There's this bit about how men go into a cave when they get stressed and I think that's probably true, although, personally, I tend to let it out. I did have a bit of a tantrum in my hotel bathroom last night – but I managed to repair the toilet, so that's OK."

Release 
"Cave" was released on 6 September 1999 on 7" vinyl—backed with an instrumental remix of the song—and double CD—backed with a remix of the song alongside "Twin", "Host" and "Coma";—on 6 September 1999.

Performances
