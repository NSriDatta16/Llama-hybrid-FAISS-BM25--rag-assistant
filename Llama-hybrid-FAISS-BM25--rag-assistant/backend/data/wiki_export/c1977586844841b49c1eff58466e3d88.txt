Silver azide is the chemical compound with the formula . It is a silver(I) salt of hydrazoic acid. It forms a colorless crystals. Like most azides, it is a primary explosive.

Structure and chemistry
Silver azide can be prepared by treating an aqueous solution of silver nitrate with sodium azide. The silver azide precipitates as a white solid, leaving sodium nitrate in solution.

X-ray crystallography shows that  is a coordination polymer with square planar  coordinated by four azide ligands. Correspondingly, each end of each azide ligand is connected to a pair of  centers. The structure consists of two-dimensional  layers stacked one on top of the other, with weaker Ag–N bonds between layers. The coordination of  can alternatively be described as highly distorted 4 + 2 octahedral, the two more distant nitrogen atoms being part of the layers above and below.

In its most characteristic reaction, the solid decomposes explosively, releasing nitrogen gas:

The first step in this decomposition is the production of free electrons and azide radicals; thus the reaction rate is increased by the addition of semiconducting oxides. Pure silver azide explodes at 340 °C, but the presence of impurities lowers this down to 270 °C. This reaction has a lower activation energy and initial delay than the corresponding decomposition of lead azide.

Safety

, like most heavy metal azides, is a dangerous primary explosive. Decomposition can be triggered by exposure to ultraviolet light or by impact. Ceric ammonium nitrate  is used as an oxidising agent to destroy  in spills.
