The University of Oriente (UDO), founded in 1958, is one of the most important national (Federal) universities in Venezuela and the main autonomous university institution dedicated to teaching, research and development in Eastern Venezuela, which has an approximate area of 365,878 km², 40% of the entire surface of Venezuela. With the commitment to train university professionals for the industries where the world's largest accumulation of heavy and extra-heavy oil, gas, coltan, uranium, coal, gold, diamonds, bauxite and underlying rare earths are found in the Guiana Shield or, the oldest geological formation on earth. With one of the largest hydroelectric generation systems in the world. To the north with the Caribbean Sea, to the south with the Amazon Rainforest (greatest biodiversity in the world) and the Guiana Shield (also among the regions with the greatest biodiversity in the world).

Sustainable tourism, studies of tropical diseases. Energy, minerals, all these diversities of resources and their industries in Eastern Venezuela constitute the lines of academic research, development and innovation promoted by the University of Oriente through its Research and Development Centers (R&D) in its 5 campuses or cores. of each State or federal entity in Eastern Venezuela and, who also interact with academic researchers on the 5 continents. Lysmata udoi was discovered in joint work between researchers from the Carcinology Research Group, School of Applied Marine Sciences, Núcleo Nueva Esparta, Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (Panama), Smithsonian Marine Station at Fort Pierce (USA), Department of Biology Marina, Faculty of Marine Sciences, Universidad Católica del Norte (Chile).

The main headquarters of the UDO and the office of the Rector (Director) is located in the city of Cumaná and was created as a national (federal), public and autonomous study house, from which thousands of professionals in various careers have graduated. many of them occupying positions of national and international relevance, it is also the university that is among the first university positions in the entire country.

History 
The Universidad de Oriente was founded on 21 November 1958 by Decree Law No. 459 published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Venezuela No. 25,831 by the Governing Board chaired by Dr. Edgar Sanabria, as Minister of Education on Dr. Rafael Pizani, under the leadership of its founder Rector Dr. Luis Manuel Peñalver. It became operational on 12 February 1959, which marked the birth of the University of the East and a year later, 113 students and a dozen teachers, in an old mansion of Cumana Caiguire sector, leading the way of fruitful academic activity in this house college.

On 29 March 1960, the republic's president, Rómulo Betancourt, officially opening the Universidad de Oriente, an act on the former site of the School "Pedro Arnal" in the capital sucrense. In his notes: "This university will allow the training of professionals in the various branches of human knowledge, to study here and here to stay ... those students at the University of East must come from all social classes, because in this country must make certain that the formula in the only democracy that exists is the aristocracy of persistent efforts, hard working and creative "

Following the lack of infrastructure and lack of trained personnel in the region to impart knowledge is entered into an agreement with the University of Kansas City and some other universities in South America and Japan to educate the teachers. The need for construction of the campus led to the state of Sucre State Council to offer a plot of 300 hectares in Cerro Colorado to the development of the Rectory and School of Basic Courses. In October 1961, Nucleus is installed in Monagas with the School of Agricultural Engineering and Petroleum, at the Center for Bolivar began in January 1962 with the School of Medicine and School of Geology and Mines, in the Nucleus of Anzoátegui (initially Instituto Tecnologico named Barcelona) began on 9 January 1963 with the School of Chemical Engineering at the Core of Nueva Esparta basic courses were initiated on January 21, 1969, all these lands were donated large transnational companies and rulers states.

The Oceanographic Institute of Venezuela was created as a branch of the University of East by means of the Executive Order 459 of President Edgar Sanabria signed on November 21, 1958. The institute began its work in 1959 at the Marine Biology Laboratory of the Ministry of Agriculture in Caigüire, Sucre, and moved to its definitive headquarters at the University main campus in the city of Cumaná, in 1963. The oceanographic vessel Guaiquerí II was the IOV research platform. Equipped with all the necessary adaptations of a maritime laboratory, it was the means of transportation for the researchers and technical personnel to take samples of the marine flora and fauna on the Venezuelan coasts

It is one of the oldest and most important centers for oceanographic and marine science research and teaching in the Caribbean and Latin America regions.

In planning the University of East is defined as a higher education system serving the region with common goals to other universities in Venezuela and the world. However, it is unique, experimental and independent, innovative in creating professional unit of Basic Courses, departmentalization, the semi-annual periods, the system of credit units, intensive courses, etc.., To develop scientific research, teaching and extension in all aspects of knowledge, which provides educational programs for undergraduate and graduate. It is almost an antithesis of the traditional university campus which is located in the nuclei university located in Anzoátegui, Bolívar, Monagas, Nueva Esparta and Sucre, thus assuming responsibility for education from their home university and a key driver for overall development throughout the island region east and south, depending on conditions and possible development trends in each of the Eastern States where they operate.

In its conception, the Universidad de Oriente is defined as a higher education system at the service of the region with objectives common to other Venezuelan and world universities. However, it is unique in its kind, experimental and autonomous, innovative in the creation of the professional unit of Basic Courses, the departmentalization, the semester periods, the system of credit units, the intensive courses; developing scientific research, teaching and extension in all aspects of knowledge, which are included in its undergraduate and graduate educational programs. It is almost an antithesis of the traditional university whose campus is based in the campuses or university centers located in the states of Anzoátegui, Bolívar, Monagas, Nueva Esparta and Sucre; thus assuming responsibility for university education and from its beginning a fundamental driver of comprehensive development in the entire island, northeastern and southern region of the country, depending on the conditions, possibilities and development trends of each of the eastern states where it operates.

The Oceanographic Institute of Venezuela (IOV), founded in 1963, has received international recognition that guarantees its level, for being a world reference in the study of marine sciences. The oceanographic vessel Guaiquerí II was the IOV research platform. Equipped with all the necessary adaptations of a maritime laboratory, it was the means of transportation for the researchers and technical personnel to take samples of the marine flora and fauna on the Venezuelan coasts.

At the Universidad de Oriente you can take courses or carry out academic research and development in the areas of: Aquaculture, Administration, Agronomy, Architecture, Bioanalysis, Biology, Marine Biology, Fisheries Biology, Spanish and Literature, Civil Engineering, Computing, Accounting, Education, Electricity, Nursing, Statistics, Physics, Management, Geology, Hospitality, IT, English, Mathematics, Maintenance, Mechanics, Medicine, Mines, Animal Production, Petroleum, Chemistry, Human Resources, Computer Systems, Industrial Systems, Sociology, STEM, Food Technology, Electronic Technology, Mechanical Manufacturing Technology, Social Work, Tourism.

Some UDO facilities have been hit hard by the government's policy against Venezuelan universities for more than 10 years. The main strength of the Universidad de Oriente is its global network of professors, researchers and graduates working in strategic positions in various sectors.

Crisis at the Universidad de Oriente 
Universidad de Oriente (UDO), an educational institution in Venezuela, has experienced challenges over the past decade, akin to other public institutions in the country. These challenges have raised questions about the institution's autonomy and sustainability. In the recent decade, UDO's autonomy has faced pressures, and its operational capacity has been restricted. Notably, there have been budgetary limitations, with the received funding often not meeting the university's operational requirements. As a result, there have been issues with staff remuneration, facility maintenance, and overall institutional health. Some sections of its infrastructure have also reported damage.

During this period, UDO recorded a decline in faculty and student numbers. In 2022, a portion of faculty members transitioned out of the institution, a trend observed across many institutions in Venezuela. Concurrently, there was a decrease in student enrollment, suggesting concerns about the institution's prospective trajectory. This reduction has also been reflected in the university's research contributions, which had previously held significance in the eastern region of Venezuela.

In response to these challenges, the UDO community has proposed various strategies, including exploring alternative funding mechanisms, expanding academic programs on an international scale, and fostering collaborations with other national and international institutions. It is noted that preserving UDO's university autonomy is a critical factor for the success of these strategies.
