Roger Staub (1 July 1936 – 30 June 1974) was a Swiss alpine ski racer and Olympic gold medalist.

Born in Arosa, Graubünden, Staub won the giant slalom at the 1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley and also won multiple medals at the 1958 World Championships. He finished fourth in the Olympic downhill in 1956 at age 19. He also won a number of Swiss national titles.

After a brief career as a professional racer in the early 1960s, Staub became ski school director at the fledgling Vail resort in Colorado. He also had a ski school in Arosa and sporting goods interests in Switzerland.

During a summer visit to Switzerland in 1974 with his wife and young child, Staub was killed in a ski gliding accident near Verbier on the eve of his 38th birthday.
