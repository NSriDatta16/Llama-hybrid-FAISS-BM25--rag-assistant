History
In the Middle Ages the Shelon River played an important role as part of the trade route connecting Novgorod and Pskov and further with the Narva River. At the end of the 15th century, the area was transferred, together with Novgorod, to the Grand Duchy of Moscow, where it belonged to the Shelon pyatina of Novgorod. 

Shimsk was founded in 1878 as a station of the railway connecting Novgorod and Staraya Russa (the railway was destroyed during World War II). In the beginning of the 20th century, Shimsk, then a selo and known as Shimsky Perevoz, was the center of Shimskaya Volost of Novgorodsky Uyezd of Novgorod Governorate.

On February 15, 1935 Shimsky District, with the center in Shimsk, was established. Between 1941 and 1944 Shimsk was occupied by German troops. On July 5, 1944, Shimsky District was transferred to newly established Novgorod Oblast. On February 1, 1963 Shimsky District was abolished, and on February 1, 1973 it was re-established. On February 5, 1981 Shimsk was granted a status of urban-type settlement.
