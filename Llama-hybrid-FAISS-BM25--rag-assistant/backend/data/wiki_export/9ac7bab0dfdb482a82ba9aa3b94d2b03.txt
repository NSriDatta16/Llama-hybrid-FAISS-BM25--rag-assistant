History
Holy Trinity Catholic Secondary School is a Catholic high school located in North Oakville in the River Oaks area within Oakville, Ontario. The school’s construction was completed in the summer of 2002 and the school opened to new students and staff in September 2002. The school initially had only Grade 9, Grade 10 and Grade 11 students. This was Holy Trinity's first year open and the size was approximately 800 students, while the 2018-2019 student and staff member count has more than doubled in size. The 2019-2020 school year has around 1330 students enrolled in the school. Holy Trinity fosters a respectful and supportive Catholic environment that inspires all students to reach their full potential. Holy Trinity offers students a comprehensive academic curriculum, an outstanding co-curricular program, and an important Catholic learning experience that will prepare them for their post-secondary goals. HT’s legendary and daily saying is “treat everyone with equity, dignity, and respect”.
Holy Trinity offers many specialty programs such as the most recent Advanced Placement (AP) program for grade 9 students (September 2017), Specialist High Skills Major (SHSM) Program, Dual Credit Course with Sheridan College and other various technology courses.
Interestingly, the school is a twin build of Christ the King Catholic Secondary School in Georgetown, Ontario. The blueprints of this school are a mirror image of Holy Trinity's and both schools were opened in September 2002.

Portable or relocatable classrooms
There are currently an additional four (4) portable classrooms situated on site for the 2021-2022 school year. In fall 2007, two separate fires ran through several portables, causing many to be replaced. Portable One was removed following the first fire and 6 years later has yet to be replaced, leaving no portable that is numbered with the number "1." These individual classrooms are placed outside of the original school building to accommodate the excess student enrolment over the building capacity of 1200 students as set by the Ontario Ministry of Education. Student enrolment in the 2007-2008 school year was a 36% enrolment increase above the permanent build facility level approved by the Ministry when the school was completed in 2002. History in Ontario has shown that many of these relocatable/portable classrooms will in fact be on site at the school for 15 to 20 or more years. As of 2017 the school has not used portable classrooms for at least 2 school years.

No provision is made by the Ministry for important and needed specialty classrooms for these additional students enrolled beyond the official building capacity. Academic areas needing additional academic specialized facilities for the additional four hundred students in excess of the official 1200 capacity, are in the areas of science labs, computer labs and technical education classrooms.
