As Cruel as School Children is the third studio album by American rap rock band Gym Class Heroes, released by Fueled by Ramen/Atlantic Records on July 25, 2006. It was produced by Fall Out Boy's Patrick Stump. 

A second version of the album, released on November 4, 2006 additionally contains the single "Cupid's Chokehold" (a different recording of the song was featured on their previous album The Papercut Chronicles). Both versions of these albums have the Parental Advisory sticker on them.  As Cruel as School Children shows a significant departure from the style of their previous work such as the use of a drum machine, acoustic guitar, synthesizers and the band dabbling in many genres such as electronica, funk and soul. 

The album received generally favorable reviews, and it has since been certified gold by the RIAA. The title of the album is a lyric from "Scandalous Scholastics", one of the album's tracks. The band later re-released this album, with the inclusion of a new remix of "Cupid's Chokehold".

Appearances and influences
A number of notable musicians appear on this album. "Clothes Off!" features Fall Out Boy vocalist Patrick Stump, who was also the album's producer. The hook for the song is from Jermaine Stewart's 1986 song "We Don't Have to Take Our Clothes Off". "Biters Block" features Speech of Arrested Development. The chorus for "Cupid's Chokehold" comes from the single "Breakfast in America" by Supertramp and is sung by Patrick Stump from Fall Out Boy.

A number of tracks have been used in other media. Track 3, "New Friend Request" and track 8, "It's OK, but Just this Once!"  were used in the film Snakes On A Plane. Travis McCoy also guest stars on the films theme tune, "Bring It (Snakes on a Plane)", whilst the song "It's OK, But Just This Once" was briefly featured on HBO's hit series Entourage in episode 319 - "The Prince's Bride". The chorus of "Shoot Down The Stars" is briefly heard in Never Back Down.

Release and reception

As Cruel as School Children debuted at number 35 on the US Billboard 200 chart, becoming the group's first album to reach the chart. On August 9, 2007, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales of over 500,000 copies in the United States.

Since its release, As Cruel as School Children has received generally positive reviews. Alternative Press called the album "nothing short of a classic", also heavily praising the use of live instrumentation. In a less enthusiastic review, Victoria Durham of Drowned in Sound stated that the band needed to "get rid of the filler" in order to be more successful. Though, she also noted the group's potential, referring to their creative rhyming as what could set them up to be "the OutKast of the rock world".
