Brethren Christian was a private Christian middle school and high school located in Huntington Beach, California. It was situated on a  site leased from the Huntington Beach City School District, formerly the site of Gisler Middle School. The school was independently operated and controlled by a board of directors. Due to financial troubles, the school eventually dropped its middle school and relocated to the campus of Grace Lutheran Church. The school permanently closed in 2020 following a large deficit and a 64% drop in enrollment.

Academics 
Brethren Christian stated that approximately 95% of their students matriculated directly to college or university immediately following graduation. Students generally scored several years above grade level on standardized testing and nearly 200 points above state and national averages on the College Board SAT Reasoning Test. The school offered a wide variety of academic courses, ranging from the Options Program for students needing academic assistance to Advanced Placement courses. College preparation began in the junior high program with the introduction of the MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers format, study skills training, and the option for advanced students to take high school level courses. The high school program provided coursework that met the University of California A-G requirements for university admissions, utilized test preparation for standardized aptitude tests from The Princeton Review, and offered opportunities for individualized planning with the academic dean and staff members. Each student taking an Advanced Placement course was required to take the Advanced Placement Examination. The percentage of students passing with a score greater than 3 was significantly higher than the state and national averages for AP courses offered at Brethren Christian.  The pass rate for the 2013 testing period was 88% and was among the highest pass rates in Orange County. Approximately 32% of eligible students took at least one AP class during the school year.

Accreditation 
BCHS was accredited through both the Western Association of Schools and Colleges and the Association of Christian Schools International.

The band was named Best Student Jazz Band at the 41st Annual MACY Awards.
