"You Win My Love" is a song recorded by Canadian country music singer Shania Twain. It was released on January 27, 1996, as the fifth single from her second studio album The Woman in Me. The song was written solely by then husband and producer Robert John "Mutt" Lange, making it one of Twain's only songs she didn't write. Lyrically, the song uses car metaphors to describe a fruitful relationship.

"You Win My Love" marked Twain's third and fifth number ones on the US Hot Country Songs and Canadian RPM Country Tracks chart, spending two and three weeks at number one respectively; notably, the song completely fell out the top ten after its two weeks at number one in the US. Like prior single "(If You're Not in It for Love) I'm Outta Here!", the song was remixed by Mutt Lange for international audiences; it was later released in Australia in 1997. Twain performed the song on both the Come On Over Tour and Rock This Country Tour and both of her Vegas residencies.

Music video
The music video for "You Win My Love" was shot in Orlando, Florida and directed by Steven Goldmann. It was filmed on January 14 and 15, 1996 and debuted on CMT on January 27 of that same year. The video is set at a race track where Twain drives around in a race car in a skin-tight leather outfit, and is based on the lyrics to the song which are vehicle-related.

The 'Mutt Lange Mix' version is available on Twain's DVD The Platinum Collection, while the 'Album Version' is available on YouTube.
