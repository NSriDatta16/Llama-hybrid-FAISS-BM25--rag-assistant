This is a list of the tallest buildings in Edmonton, the capital city of the province of Alberta in Canada.

Edmonton has twenty-four buildings taller than . The tallest is the Stantec Tower, the tallest Canadian building outside Toronto, which surpassed the previous record holder, JW Marriott Edmonton Ice District & Residences, on 23 May 2018. Until late 2013, the presence of aircraft taking off and landing at the Edmonton City Centre Airport restricted any building from reaching an elevation higher than  above mean sea level, about  above downtown.

Edmonton's first true skyscraper, and the tallest building in Western Canada for five years, was the CN Tower, built in 1966. A building boom did not really begin until the oil shocks of 1973 and 1979, which prompted construction of many of the city's current tall buildings (17 of the top 20, as of 2019). Highrise construction was virtually non-existent between the mid-1980s and the early 2000s due to low oil prices, upon which Edmonton's economy depends.

The rapid oil price increases of 2003-2008 had created a new boom in Alberta and prompted new construction again. Due to the time lag between the beginning of the boom and when buildings are completed, the next wave of new highrise buildings really began construction in 2006 or 2007 and many were not completed until after the 2008 financial crisis had caused a drop in oil prices. By 2008, the city was experiencing something of a building boom, with  of office space under construction and vacancy rates still falling.

As of November 2021 many construction projects are delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Currently, Edmonton has 280 completed high-rise buildings, with 13 more under construction and another 41 approved for construction or proposed.

Table entries with dashes (—) indicate that information regarding building height (other than statements of "will be over 100 m" or "will be over 25 floors") or date of completion has not yet been released.
