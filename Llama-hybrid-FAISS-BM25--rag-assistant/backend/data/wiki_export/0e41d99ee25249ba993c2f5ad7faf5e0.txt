"Brand New Lover" is a song recorded by English pop band Dead or Alive. It was the lead single released from the band's third studio album, Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know on Epic Records. It achieved international success when released as a single in 1986, but while it was a major hit in a number of territories, including the United States and Japan, in the UK the single significantly underperformed, failing to crack the top 20.

Background
Following a fraught six-month recording session with producers Stock Aitken Waterman, which was marked by fights and disagreements between the band, record company and producers over the sound of their new material, singer Pete Burns claimed he struggled to get Epic to commit to a release schedule for the single. He said this changed when Bananarama had major success with their Dead or Alive-inspired cover of "Venus", which Burns claimed encouraged the label to schedule "Brand New Lover" for release. Later, Burns blamed the song's disappointing chart run in his home country on his then-ongoing war with his UK label, alleging that the company had failed to press and distribute enough copies of the single to make it a hit, and claiming the band had lost out on 67,000 UK sales as a result.

The song features western motifs, with lyrics that describe the singer's desire to leave his current partner for one who is more exciting. His motivation is that he admittedly does not desire a stable relationship with one partner, but rather is "a pleasure seeker."

Critical reception
Jerry Smith of the Music Week magazine described "Brand New Lover" a "high energy dance track" with a "typically effervescent style", and praised "Burns' "instantly memorable vocal" and SAW's "polished production". Retrospectively, in 2021, British magazine Classic Pop ranked "Brand New Lover" number 31 in their list of "Top 40 Stock/Aitken/Waterman songs", adding that it "shared rhythmic similarities to their No.1 smash "You Spin Me Round" but leaned heavily on the synth bass, with Pete Burns' goth-pop tones vocalising his need to flee his lover".

Chart performance
"Brand New Lover" proved to be more successful in the U.S. and in Japan than in the band's native UK, where it reached number 31. In the US, "Brand New Lover" peaked at number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (the band's second and last single to reach the top 20), and spent two weeks at number one on the American dance chart in December 1986.
