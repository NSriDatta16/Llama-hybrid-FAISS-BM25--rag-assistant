A victory parade is a parade held to celebrate a victory. Numerous military and sport victory parades have been held.

Military victory parades 

Among the most famous parades are the victory parades celebrating the end of the First World War and the Second World War. However, victory parades date back to ancient Rome, where Roman triumphs celebrated a leader who was militarily victorious. In the modern age, victory parades typically take the form of celebrating a national victory, rather than a personal one. In the 21st century, politicians in nations such as Ukraine and Azerbaijan have stated their intentions to hold victory parades after the resolving of regional conflicts, in this case the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and the War in Donbass respectively.
