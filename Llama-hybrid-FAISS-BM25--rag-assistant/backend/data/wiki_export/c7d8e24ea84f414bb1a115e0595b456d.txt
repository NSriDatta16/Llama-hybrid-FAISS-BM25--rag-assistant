History
The Wycombe Railway opened the line from Princes Risborough to Aylesbury on 1 October 1863. The Great Western Railway took over the Wycombe Railway in 1867 and opened Little Kimble station in 1872. The station building once had ornate stone chimneys, and was identical to the "up" platform building at .

The station was transferred from the Western Region of British Rail to the London Midland Region on 24 March 1974.

In 1998 Little Kimble received the British Royal Train. The G8 Summit was held in Birmingham that year and the wives of the G8 countries' leaders, including Cherie Blair and Hillary Clinton, were taken to Chequers via the Royal Train and Little Kimble, which is the nearest station to Chequers. The train reversed at Princes Risborough and the wives alighted at Little Kimble, whence they were transferred to Chequers via limousine.

Little Kimble is in an area of the country where edible dormice (Glis glis) are common and, in 2010, they made their home in the ticket machine meaning that travellers could not buy their tickets.
