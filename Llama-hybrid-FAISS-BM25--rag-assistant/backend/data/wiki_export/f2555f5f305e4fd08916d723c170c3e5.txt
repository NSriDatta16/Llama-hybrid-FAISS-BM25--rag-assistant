Forces Sweetheart (or Forces' Sweetheart) is an accolade given to entertainers, actors and singers originally the term was used in the United Kingdom,  to note popular showbiz personalities that became a favourite of soldiers in the British Armed Forces, though the term is also used in other countries.

The role of being a favourite among armed forces personnel started during World War I. During this time, novelist Lady Angela Forbes was considered a "Forces Sweetheart" as a catering organiser for the British army from November 1914. The British Soldiers' Buffets, nicknamed "Angelinas", met every train of wounded as it arrived and were often open 24 hours a day, and food never ran out. 

Following Forbes, in the United States actress and singer Elsie Janis was called The Sweetheart of the American Expeditionary Forces.
