An elevator mechanic is someone who constructs, modernizes, repairs or services conveyances. Typically, elevator mechanics work on elevators, escalators, dumbwaiters, wheelchair lifts, moving walkways and other equipment providing vertical transportation. In many places, particularly in North America, elevator mechanics belong to a company called Elevator Constructors. Labor unions have a large impact on the industry, depending on the country. Mechanics make an average annual wage of US$70,910 (as of May 2010). Elevator mechanic jobs are expected to grow of 13% from 2014 to 2024.

Work environment
Elevator installers are usually required to lift and carry heavy parts and equipment. They are also often required to work overtime due to demand for quick repairs and emergencies.Elevators can stop working at any time, therefore many workers are on call 24 hours a day.<

Elevator installers go through formal apprenticeships to learn the trade. Most US states require a license.
