History
Strathpine is situated in the Yugarabul traditional Indigenous Australian country.

The area now known as Strathpine was originally developed in the 1860s as an addition to the North Pine settlement (now known as Petrie) during the Gympie gold rush. In the late 19th century, the area was known for sugar and rum production, with several sugar mills and distilleries in the area. The area was first named Strathpine by the Queensland Government Railways in the 1880s where Strathpine is a Scottish place name, where strath means valley and pine refers to the Pine River.

From 1889 to 2008, Strathpine was the administrative centre of the Pine Rivers Shire Council (formerly known as the Pine Division and the Shire of Pine). Although Pine Rivers Shire was amalgamated in 2008 into the Moreton Bay Region (known since 2023 as the City of Moreton Bay), council offices are still located in the suburb.

Shortcut Provisional School opened circa 1894 and closed circa 1915.

Strathpine State School opened on 16 January 1911. 

The population of the area boomed in the 1940s after the opening of 'Camp Strathpine', a large army camp and airfield which helped both Australian and American forces during World War II.  Modern-day Spitfire Avenue occupies the area where one of three airfields constructed in the region during World War II had resided. 

Development slowly increased until the 1960s when Brisbaneâ€™s rapidly growing population expanded into the area. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the property developer, property marketer and business owner William (Bill) Bowden marketed and developed numerous estates in the Strathpine area. Bill Bowden's marketing slogan was "Little Aspley - that's Strathpine", a reference to the nearby Brisbane suburb of Aspley. Most of the farms were sold off and the area quickly grew into a residential and commercial hub.

Strathpine State High School opened on 28 January 1964, but on 5 March 1964 was renamed Pine Rivers District State High School, which was later simplified to Pine Rivers State High School. 

Strathpine State Infants School was separated from Strathpine State School on 23 January on 1978. It closed on 9 December 1988, reamalgamating with Strathpine State School.

Strathpine West State School opened on 27 January 1981.

Growth continued into the 1980s and Strathpine Centre opened on 22 August 1983, known as Westfield Strathpine until 2015. The Strathpine Library opened in 1990.
