History
The village originates from the late 19th century, when the local land owner Odescalchi employed people from Bački Petrovac and Gložan, Slovak villages across the Danube, in order to satisfy growing timber export. At first, they resided seasonally and returned to their villages. In order to ensure more permanent work force, they offered them cleared forest land as loan, at the location of the later village. In 1910, the village had 371 residents, and in the mid-century around 500.

Economy
The residents are mostly engaged in agriculture, with a part working in nearby Beočin.
