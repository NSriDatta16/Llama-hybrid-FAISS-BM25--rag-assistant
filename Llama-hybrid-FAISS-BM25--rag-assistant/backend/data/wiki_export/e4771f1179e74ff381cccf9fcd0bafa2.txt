Hijab Incident
In 2019 a student at a nearby Islamic school who played as part of Northview High School was disqualified from cross country regionals, after her coach failed to submit a waiver for her hijab, which was considered a uniform violation by district officials and defended by the Ohio High School Athletic Association. The incident attracted international attention, including a comment in support of the student from Elizabeth Warren. The OHSAA later went on to change their uniform rules due to the backlash from this incident.
