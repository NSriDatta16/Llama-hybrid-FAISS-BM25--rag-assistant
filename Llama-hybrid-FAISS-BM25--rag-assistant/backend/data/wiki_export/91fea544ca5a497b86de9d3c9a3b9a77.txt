Bermuda appointment 

Governor of Bermuda George Fergusson announced on February 27, 2015, that he has appointed Ms Gitanjali Gutierrez to be Bermuda's Information Commissioner, designated under section 50 of the Public Access to Information Act 2010 [PATI].  "Ms Gutierrez will take up her duties with effect from March 2, 2015, ahead of the Act coming into force on April 1, 2015," a spokesperson said.

Mr Fergusson said: "Ms Gita Gutierrez has a distinguished record as a lawyer dealing with issues of public access to information in the US and, to some extent, the UK.  "She has impressive experience of leading a team in complex areas of legal interpretation and public scrutiny. I am very pleased that she will be taking on this important and difficult role."

Ms Gutiérrez, who is married to a Bermudian and has lived on the Island since 2011, is a graduate of Bucknell University and Cornell Law School, where she has also served as an adjunct professor of law. Her legal career has focused particularly on civil rights issues.

The PATI legislation allows the public to request information from publicly funded bodies. The information commissioner, who will initially be appointed for five years, is to start by assessing Bermuda's readiness for PATI. She will also deal with appeals over requests that are turned down.
