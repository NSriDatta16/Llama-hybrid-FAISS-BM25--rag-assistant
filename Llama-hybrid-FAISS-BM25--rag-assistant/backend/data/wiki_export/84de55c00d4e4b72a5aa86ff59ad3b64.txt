History
The Los Angeles Dodgers previously fielded a Rookie-level team in the Gulf Coast League (GCL) from 1983 to 1992 and then from 2001 to 2008, known as the Gulf Coast League Dodgers. The team played its home games in Vero Beach, Florida, on Field One of Historic Dodgertown. Dodgertown includes Holman Stadium, which was the spring training home to the major-league Dodgers. The GCL Dodgers originally played from 1983 to 1992, and then became absent from the GCL until they reappeared in 2001.

In 2009, the Dodgers announced that the team would relocate to Arizona and compete in the Arizona League (AZL). The team plays its home games at Camelback Ranch, the spring training facility of the major-league Dodgers. In 2019, the Dodgers fielded two squads in the Arizona League, differentiated with suffixes "Lasorda" and "Mota". Prior to the 2021 season, the Arizona League was renamed as the Arizona Complex League (ACL).
