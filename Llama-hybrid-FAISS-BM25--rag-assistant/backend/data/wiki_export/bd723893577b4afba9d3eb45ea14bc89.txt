Delio César Toledo Rodas (born 2 October 1976) is a Paraguayan retired footballer who played as a left back.

During his professional career, he represented clubs in five countries, competing mainly in La Liga. Toledo appeared with the Paraguay national team at the 1999 Copa América and the 2006 World Cup.

Club career
Born in Doctor Cecilio Báez, Caaguazú Department, Toledo started his career in Club Atlético Colegiales from where, after a good season, he was transferred to Cerro Porteño. He then moved to Europe where he played briefly for Udinese Calcio (January–December 1999) and RCD Espanyol (January 2000 – June 2001); with the latter club he was involved in a forged passport scandal which led to a ban, in his first full season.

After a brief spell back in South America with Colón de Santa Fe, Toledo returned to Spain, now with Real Zaragoza in the second division. He scored once in 31 games en route to promotion, being used regularly in the subsequent three seasons.

Toledo signed with Kayserispor of Turkey in July 2006, winning the domestic cup in his second year. He decided to retire from football due to injury in early 2010, but returned to football – and Kayserispor – on 29 March, in a match against Trabzonspor.

International career
Internationally, Toledo represented Paraguay on 35 occasions, playing 82 minutes against England in a group stage 0–1 loss at the 2006 FIFA World Cup. He was also selected for the squad at the 1999 Copa América played on home soil, as the national team reached the quarterfinals.

Toledo earned his first cap on 7 March 1999 in the Copa de la Paz, netting the second goal in a 3–0 win over Bolivia.
