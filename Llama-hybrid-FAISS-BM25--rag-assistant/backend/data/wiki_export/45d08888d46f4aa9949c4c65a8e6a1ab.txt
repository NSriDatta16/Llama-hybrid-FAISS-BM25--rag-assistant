History
Founded in 1904, the municipality of Honfleur is similar to Honfleur, city in Calvados, Normandie, where many sailors came from during the 16th and 17th century to North America. The name comes from the archbishop of Quebec, cardinal Louis-Nazaire Bégin, (1840-1925) whose ancestor came from Saint-Léonard-de-Honfleur, archdiocese of Lisieux, also situated in Calvados. During this period, the civil parish was erected. The territory was part of the seigneurie Taschereau, once named seigneurie Joliette, where municipalities such as Saint-Anselme, Saint-Gervais, Saint-Lazare and Sainte-Claire were located.
