Since the conception of Christian Television networks Dottie was a fixture on the new platform. Rambo appeared on Pat Robertson's CBN and 700 Club, Paul and Jan Crouch's TBN, Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker's PTL. Her closest association was with TBN where she had a TV series that ran as their #2 rated show for 6 years, “The Dottie Rambo Magazine”. Her series featured music, cooking segments, and celebrity guests; Minnie Pearl, Barbara Mandrell, Dottie West, Connie Smith, Lisa Whelchel and many others.

In 1991 Dottie was inducted into the Gospel Music Hall Of Fame, 1997 The Southern Gospel Music Hall Of Fame. The Christian Country Music Association's “Songwriter of The Century”. In 2006 she was inducted into the Kentucky Music Hall of Fame with Lily Tomlin presenting her the honor.

In 2008 she was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame.

In 2000, Rambo was awarded the ASCAP Lifetime Achievement Award. Her music is known for its poetic lyrics and cross genre reaching melodies often dealing with themes such as heaven, Christian sacrifice, hurts, and the born-again Christian experience.

On May 11, 2008, while on her tour bus heading to Texas for a Mother's Day concert, Rambo's tour bus crashed, killing her instantly. The crash took place in Mt. Vernon, Missouri. The other 6 passengers survived with injuries, including her manager Larry Ferguson and his family.

A tribute album in honor of Dottie's songwriting will be released in 2021. The album will feature artists of various genres singing their favorite Rambo composition. Rambo's longtime manager Larry Ferguson is co-producer of the project.

Early life
She was born Joyce Reba Luttrell in Madisonville, Kentucky in 1934 to Jerald Vernon "Chick" and Elizabeth Luttrell. According to personal accounts, she grew up in poverty and developed an early affinity for country music. She learned to play guitar while listening at night to the Grand Ole Opry on WSM radio in Nashville. At age eight, she started writing songs while sitting on a creek bank near her Morganfield, Kentucky home. She had the support of her mother and father, and by age ten she was singing and playing country music cover tunes on a local radio program.

At twelve years old, she became a born-again Christian and made a commitment to write and sing Christian music. The decision turned out to be pivotal in more than one way; it did not sit well with her father who gave her an ultimatum – give up Christian music or leave. She left home and went on the road, with her first engagement being at a church in Indianapolis, Indiana. She formed a trio called the Gospel Echoes and traveled throughout the midwestern and southern United States. The Gospel Echoes would consist of different members over the years, including Pat Green and Little Joe Hatfield.

In 1950, at age sixteen, she met Buck Rambo at a revival meeting she was holding with evangelist Jimmie Russell. They married shortly thereafter and began traveling and singing together after years of her traveling alone and living with pastors' families.

The Singing Rambos became the group's name with the addition of their daughter Reba in the mid-1960s. Through an introduction by another gospel group, the Happy Goodman Family, Rambo sang for the then-governor of Louisiana, Jimmie Davis, who was also a popular country and gospel music recording artist. Davis signed her to a writing contract with his publishing company, Jimmie Davis Music (BMI).

She received a signing bonus of around $3,000, the most she had ever earned up to that time. Though Jimmie Davis appears as a co-writer on Rambo's compositions during this time, she publicly stated he did not write any music or lyrics to her compositions but required a writer's share upon the publishing agreement. Jimmie Davis Music is now owned by Peer Music.

Throughout the 1960s her star began to rise, mostly as a songwriter, but also as a soloist. As the leader of The Singing Rambos she traveled internationally, including a 1967 trip to Vietnam to perform for American troops. While there, Rambo ministered in field hospitals, the USS Kitty Hawk, and the USS Ticonderoga. In Vietnam the group was billed as the "Swinging Rambos", as the government feared that a Christian singing group's safety could be at risk. US soldiers presented Rambo with a Viet Cong flag and other personal mementos from the war. She also performed in other parts of the world for the USO including Thule, Greenland. Outside of the USO tours she also traveled behind the Iron Curtain, throughout Europe, West Indies, Bahamas, The Holy Land (Israel), and Canada.

Her songwriting break and Davis' company's promotion of Rambo's songs resulted in a Warner Bros. Records recording contract for her and the Gospel Echoes. After earning as little as $50 a week for years, and often working day jobs to make ends meet, Rambo's fortunes began to improve. Their records were selling and her songs were being noticed within the industry, with other gospel groups beginning to record them. In 1968 she won a Grammy Award for Best Soul Gospel Performance for her album It's The Soul Of Me. Poor record sales for the Gospel Echoes caused the Warner Bros. label to release the group. Warner Bros. saw something special in Dottie as a solo artist and asked her to sign on with a recording contract for R&B music, she signed instead with the Benson Records as a solo artist and as part of The Singing Rambos.

Rambo worked with Billy Graham, Jimmy Swaggart, Oral Roberts, Benny Hinn, Kathryn Kuhlman, John Hagee, Jim Bakker, Tammy Faye Bakker-Messner, Paul and Jan Crouch, Paula White, Reinhard Bonnke, Pat Robertson, T. D. Jakes and others.

Her Down by the Creekbank is one of the most successful Christian children's records in history, earning platinum record status. In addition to her solo and trio recordings, Rambo appeared on other artists' recordings including Jimmie Davis, Barbara Mandrell, Dickey Betts of the Allman Brothers, The Dunaways, David Robertson, Amy Lambert, Kristian Booth, and Walt Mills.
