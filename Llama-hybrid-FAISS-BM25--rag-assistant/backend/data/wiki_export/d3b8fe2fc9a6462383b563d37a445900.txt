Transportation

Roads
For motorists, the Trans-Canada Highway provides freeway access to Burnaby, Vancouver, Surrey, and other municipalities in the Lower Mainland. Lougheed Highway is an alternative route to the Trans-Canada, entering Coquitlam through Maillardville, past the Riverview Hospital area, up to Coquitlam Centre where it turns sharply east to Port Coquitlam and then into Pitt Meadows via the Pitt River Bridge. Barnet Highway begins at the Coquitlam Centre area and heads directly west through Port Moody and on to Burnaby and downtown Vancouver.

Public transit
Bus service in the Tri-Cities is provided by TransLink. The West Coast Express, which runs from Downtown Vancouver to Mission, stops at Port Coquitlam station, Coquitlam Central station and Moody Centre station.

SkyTrain currently serves the area, since the completion of the Evergreen Extension on December 2, 2016. The line serves Lougheed Town Centre in Burnaby, and passes through the southwestern part of Coquitlam into Port Moody and central Coquitlam, where it terminates at Lafarge Lakeâ€“Douglas station.

Business
Businesses in the Tri-City area are represented by the Tri-Cities Chamber of Commerce.
