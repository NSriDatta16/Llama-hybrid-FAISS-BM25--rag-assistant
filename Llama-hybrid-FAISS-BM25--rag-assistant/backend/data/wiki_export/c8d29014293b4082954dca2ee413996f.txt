She was a registered general nurse and midwife (Canterbury District Hospital), with post-graduate qualifications in Mothercraft (St Anthony's, Ashfield) and psychiatry (Gladesville Hospital). She also held qualifications in Tropical medicine, Under 5s' Health and Planned Parenthood.

Robin Dunster was a graduate of the Salvation Army's International Training College (Victorious Session)  in London, England.
