Hamurana Springs

The Hamurana Springs are a collection of springs on the site, officially named Hamurana Springs Recreation Reserve since 1971.

Hangarua Spring

The main spring is 920 feet (280 m) above sea level and is approximately 15 metres (50 ft) deep. It produces an estimated 4 million litres of crystal clear water per hour at a fairly constant temperature of 10 degrees Celsius. The rock surrounding this spring is volcanic (rhyolitic). The spring water travels down from the Mamaku Plateau through underground aquifers, taking 70 years to get here.

Dancing Sands Spring
Another identified spring in the reserve is the Dancing Sands spring, named because of the effect of the emerging water on the sand on the bottom of the spring.

Hamurana Stream
The spring flows as a stream for approximately one kilometre in the Hamurana Springs Recreation Reserve through a patch of redwoods forest before joining Lake Rotorua. In summer the stream is home to rainbow trout who prefer the cooler temperature of the spring water.

Ownership
Ownership of the springs and other nearby sites of cultural significance was returned to the Ngati Rangiwewehi iwi under the  Ngati Rangiwewehi Claims Settlement Bill 2014. The Act also declares the Hamurana Springs A and Hamurana Springs B as reserves subject to sections 17 and 18 respectively of the Reserves Act 1977.

Access for the public to the springs and reserve maintained by the Department of Conservation was historically free, however, access is now fully enclosed and only paid access is available .
