History
The history of Jandaia is related to the cult of Our Lady of Abadia and Santa Luzia. In 1927 a rancher, Bernardino Vivaldo dos Santos, who had bought lands in the region, donated land for the building of a chapel. More land was bought and houses appeared around the chapel. The settlement was called Água Limpa and it became a district in 1935. With the construction of the new highway, Goiânia to Rio Verde, the region began to develop. The name was changed to Jandaia, a type of parrot found in the region, and in 1953 it became a municipality, separating from Palmeiras de Goiás.
