No Compromise is the second album release by contemporary Christian music artist Keith Green, released in 1978.

The album's title derives from the song "Make My Life a Prayer to You" written by Keith's wife Melody, which begins: "Make my life a prayer to You / I wanna do what You want me to / No empty words and no white lies / no token prayers, no compromise." (The title was used for the official Keith Green biography written by his wife Melody Green, which was included in Rich Text Format (RTF) and Portable Document Format (PDF) formats on The Ministry Years, Volume Two (1980-1982) (CD release), which has the Enhanced CD label, and was also used for the Various Artists compilation No Compromise: Remembering The Music Of Keith Green featuring covers of classic Keith Green songs)

No Compromise features cover art that refers to the Book of Esther in the Bible, specifically the part where Mordecai refused to bow to Haman.

Making of the album

Much like Green's first work, this album was produced by Bill Maxwell, who also contributed some of the instrumental playing on the album along with Keith Green himself.
