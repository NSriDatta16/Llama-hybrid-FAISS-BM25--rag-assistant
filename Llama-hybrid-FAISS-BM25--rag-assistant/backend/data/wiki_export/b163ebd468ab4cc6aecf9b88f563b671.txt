McCann is an Irish surname. It is derived from the Gaelic Mac Cana meaning "son of Cana". The Irish given name Cana literally means "cub", specifically alluding to a "wolf cub" (i.e. a young warrior). The Mac Cana were a Gaelic Irish clan who held the lands of Clancann and Clanbrassil, together known as Oneilland, in what is now northern County Armagh. The surname is strongly associated with that part of Ulster.

According to Irish tradition they are a Milesian people descended from Colla-da-Chrioch, the first king of Airgialla. The family of the name Mac Cana, were known as lords of Clanbrassil. They were a branch of the Cenel nEoghain, the large group of Northern Uí Néill septs claiming descent from King Eógan mac Néill, the son of the High King Niall of the Nine Hostages. Amhlaoibh Mac Cana is mentioned in the Annals of the Four Masters. He was praised for his chivalry, his vigour, and his strong drink he made from apples in his orchard. The McCanns are also stated as having had a castle at Portadown in County Armagh. The last recorded Chief of the name, Donall MaCanna, was still known as lord of Clanbrassil as late as 1598. The title of lord of Clanbrassil is still held by the family of McCann in the area of County Louth.

The McCann line features in John O' Hart's 19th century historical book, Irish pedigrees. In this book, the McCann line along with other surname lines are taken right back to Adam and Eve.

Due to anglicization the original form Mac Cana has had many different variations, such as McGann, MacCann, MacCan, Maccan (this part of the Maccans had connections with many European noble families, such as the Maccan of Trento, Villanova or Maccan de Gueldre), MacCana, and became Canny and Canney upon Ulster migration to the south (Leinster and Munster).
