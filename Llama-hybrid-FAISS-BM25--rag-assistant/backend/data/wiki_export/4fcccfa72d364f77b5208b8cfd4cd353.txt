The Chapayev class (Project 68 Чапаев) were a group of cruisers built for the Soviet Navy during and after World War II. Seventeen ships were planned in total, but only seven were actually started before the German invasion. Two incomplete ships were destroyed when their building yard in Nikolaev was captured by Nazi Germany and the remaining five cruisers were completed only in 1950, with the last ship serving until 1981.

Design

As part of Stalin's 1936 "Big Fleet Programme", many light cruisers were to be built over the next ten years. Project 26 Kirov-class cruisers were planned to be constructed, but their armour and AA were considered inadequate. In August 1936, a new cruiser design similar to Kirov-class cruisers named Project 28 resolved these issues. They were to form the backbone of light forces flotillas with additional tasks including offensive minelaying, commerce raiding, and battleship screening against enemy light forces. The 3 triple  gun turrets on the Kirovs were changed to 4 triple  gun turrets, offering a higher rate of fire. On 29 October 1937, the navy changed its requirements to 3 triple  guns and redesignated it as Project 68 before being reverted in March 1938.

The final design was approved in July 1939 and five ships were ordered. Seven ships were under construction by June 1941. Weapons and systems development lagged behind its construction, leading to a planned redesign of the first two ships with German weaponry in September 1940 designated Project 68I. The plan was cancelled since German guns were in development too, but German secondary guns were added to Chkalov, the second ship designated Project 68S.

The 152 mm B-38 guns could fire six to seven  shells  in a minute. The guns were mounted in individual cradles with separate elevation.

The original secondary armament consisted of 4 twin  B-54 guns in enclosed turrets. The anti-aircraft guns consisted of 6 twin  Model 1939 guns and 4 twin  DShK machine guns.

The design featured a larger hull and improved protection compared to the Kirov class. The machinery was based on a unit system with alternating boiler rooms and engine rooms.

The five surviving ships were completed after the war with the modified Project 68K design. The K in Project 68K stands for Korrektirovanniy (Russian: Корректированный, corrected). The modified design removed the aircraft facilities and torpedo tubes. It improved anti-aircraft artillery with twin  SM-5 guns in powered turrets with a high fire rate and twin  Model 1939 in a new powered and water cooled mounting.

Ships

Seventeen ships were authorised in 1939 and eleven were ordered. Six ships were for the Baltic Fleet, four for the Black Sea Fleet and one for the Pacific Fleet. Seven ships were laid down before the German invasion in 1941.
