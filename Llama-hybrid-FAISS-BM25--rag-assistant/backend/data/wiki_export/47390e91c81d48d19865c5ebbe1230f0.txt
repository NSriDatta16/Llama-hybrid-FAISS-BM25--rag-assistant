Asperger's Society of Ontario is a small, volunteer driven charity and almost every person in the organization - from the Board of Directors members to staff and volunteers - is directly connected to Asperger syndrome, either themselves being a person with Asperger syndrome, or having a family member affected.

In 2018 the society considered changing its name after revelations of Hans Asperger's links to the Nazi euthanasia program.  They polled their members and found 86 preferred to say they had Asperger's Syndrome, while 19 preferred the term "autistic". In November 2020, the organization was rebranded from Asperger's Society of Ontario to Asperger's Society of Ontario.
