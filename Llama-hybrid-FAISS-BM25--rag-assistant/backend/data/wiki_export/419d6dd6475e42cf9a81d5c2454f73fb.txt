Portarlington station is a railway station on the Dublin-Cork Main Line.

It is the branching-off/exchange point for services to Galway, Ballina, and Westport.

The station formerly had a third track between the platforms "the centre or middle road" which was removed in 2005 when the platforms were lengthened and widened in preparation for the introduction of Mk 4 Inter City trains.
