Wishbone Ash is the first studio album by Wishbone Ash. It peaked at number 29 in the UK Albums Chart in January 1971.

Background
The band opened for Deep Purple in early 1970. Deep Purple guitarist Ritchie Blackmore was jamming during the band's soundcheck, when Wishbone guitarist Andy Powell joined in and began jamming with Blackmore. After the show, Blackmore recommended that MCA Records sign the band. Deep Purple producer Derek Lawrence produced this album, which features elements of blues, jazz, progressive rock, and psychedelic improvisation.. The first side contains three uptempo tracks along with the ballad "Errors Of My Way" which, unusually for a rock song, was written in 12/8 time. Side two contains two lengthy tracks featuring long instrumental passages, the second of which, Phoenix, was to become a live favourite often stretching in excess of 17 minutes.
