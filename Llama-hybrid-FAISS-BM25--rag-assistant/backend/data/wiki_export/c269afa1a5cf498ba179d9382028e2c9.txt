Background and production
Sursok left Home and Away in 2004, so she could pursue a music career and acting opportunities in the United States. The actress explained "I'm 21 and it's time to be more creative. It is scary, but I had to leave before I became stale." In 2004, Sursok confirmed she was signed a recording contract with Sony BMG Music Entertainment as well as confirming reports that recording had begun for her debut studio album with songwriters Savan Kotecha, David Kreuger, Marion Raven, Steve Booker and producers John Shanks, Per Mangusson and David Kreuger.

In an interview, Tammin said; "My music has two sides to the album, one has a pop/rock edge, and the other has more live instrumentation with a bit of an organic piano-based feel as well. So it's a bit of both! A lot of people ask what my music is like, but I never went into the recording studio saying 'I want to make an album like this person' ... so everyone who's heard the songs ... I think my stuff is unique to me, I know what music I do love to listen to, but for me I don't think it sounds like anything else."
