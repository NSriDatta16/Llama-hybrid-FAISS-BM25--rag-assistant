The 54th British Academy Film Awards, given by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, took place on 25 February 2001 and honoured the best films of 2000. The nominees were announced on 31 January 2001.

Epic historical drama Gladiator led the winners with four awards, including Best Film; Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon also tied with four wins, including Best Director (Ang Lee) and Best Film Not in the English Language. Billy Elliot was voted Outstanding British Film of 2000, with lead actor Jamie Bell winning Best Actor in a Leading Role, becoming the youngest ever Best Actor recipient at just 14-years-old. Additionally, Julia Roberts won Best Actress in a Leading Role for her portrayal of Erin Brockovich in Erin Brockovich, Benicio del Toro won Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his role in Traffic, and Julie Walters won Best Actress in a Supporting Role for her role in Billy Elliot.

This is also the first ceremony that was hosted by comedian Stephen Fry, a position he would carry out for twelve years (from 2001 to 2006 and 2012 to 2017) until he stepped down in 2018.
