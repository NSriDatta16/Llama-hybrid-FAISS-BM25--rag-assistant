Cha Cha Cha is the third album by English rock band EMF, released in 1995 under the EMI label.

Critical reception
Trouser Press wrote that "flashes of EMF’s early techno-pop sound surface in 'Bleeding You Dry,' by far the most listenable track on 1995’s Cha Cha Cha. Almost every other cut on this would-be comeback, however, finds the band groping-unsuccessfully — for some new musical direction."
