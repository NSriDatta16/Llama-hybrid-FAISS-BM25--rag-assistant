House of prayer
In 1986 a charitable trust was established to run the property as a 'house of prayer'. In the words of the registered objects of the charity, Abbotswick was dedicated to "encouraging and enabling individuals and the community at large to promote and persist in the practice of prayer".

In 2003 the property was transferred to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brentwood (Brentwood Diocesan Trust). Since the beginning of September 2004 the house has been run by the Community of Our Lady of Walsingham.

The House of Prayer is open to all who are seeking spiritual renewal, guidance and healing, whether as individuals or a group. Abbotswick continues to provide a quiet place to which they can go to meet God in prayer and be inspired to holy living.
