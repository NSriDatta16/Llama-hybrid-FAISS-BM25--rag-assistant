Early life
John Burdett Wittenoom was born in England at Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire. He was educated at Winchester College and matriculated to Brasenose College, Oxford in 1807, graduating B.A. in 1810, M.A. in 1813. He was ordained deacon in the Church of England in 1811, priest in 1812.

He singlehandedly conducted services alternately every Sunday at Perth, Guildford and Fremantle until 1836.

In later years, he ran a grammar school and pursued his interest in education. In 1847, he was appointed to the colony's first education committee and was the inaugural chairman for eight years after it became the Board of Education. After his death in 1855, his second wife and daughter took charge of the government girls' school.

His daughter Mary was the mother of Edith Cowan, while another daughter, Augusta, married Thomas Burges (a member of parliament). The progeny of Wittenoom's fifth son, Charles Wittenoom, became notable individuals in the history of Western Australia.
