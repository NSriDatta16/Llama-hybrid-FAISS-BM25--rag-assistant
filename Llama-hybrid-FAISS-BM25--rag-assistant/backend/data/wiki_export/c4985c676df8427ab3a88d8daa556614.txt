The last Inter-Cities Fairs Cup edition was contested in the 1970–71 season before it was abolished and replaced by the UEFA Cup, a new seasonal confederation competition. The Fairs Cup trophy had not been won by any club permanently, so it was arranged a one match play-off game between the first and last competition winners: Barcelona and Leeds United, respectively. The game took place on 22 September 1971 at the Camp Nou.
