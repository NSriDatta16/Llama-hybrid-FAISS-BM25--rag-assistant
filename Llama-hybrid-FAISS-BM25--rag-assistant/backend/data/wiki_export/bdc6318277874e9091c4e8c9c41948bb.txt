Notable incidents
Tianya Club has been involved in Chinese news stories such as a revival of the 1995 Tsinghua University poisoning story about Zhu Ling.

 Tianya Club was the progenitor  of the Hanxin hoax and was involved in the exposure of the 2007 Chinese slave scandal. Tianya Club is also famous for its social search, nicknamed the "human flesh search engine" (Renrou Sousuo, meaning "human flesh search" literally, extended to "by hand" or "not computer aided"). For example, during January 2008 of Edison Chen photo scandal, the Tianya Club users searched out and identified the woman involved, based on a silhouette in a newspaper.
