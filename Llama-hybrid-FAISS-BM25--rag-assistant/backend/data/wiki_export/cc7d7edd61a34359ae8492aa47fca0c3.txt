Free-for-All is the second studio album by American rock musician Ted Nugent. It was released in September 1976 by Epic Records, and was his first album to go platinum.

Background
As the recording of Free-for-All commenced, rhythm guitarist and lead vocalist Derek St. Holmes left the band, citing growing personal and creative conflicts with Nugent. Two solid years of living together on the road had taken its toll on the relationship. Additionally, St. Holmes was unhappy with Tom Werman's production, saying that the producer was watering down the band's sound.

A full year before Bat Out of Hell brought him international success, vocalist Meat Loaf was brought in by producer Werman to sing on the album. Meat Loaf was paid the sum of $1,000 for his contributions to the album, which included crafting his vocal arrangements and two days of recording sessions. He says that after he agreed to do the album he was sent a lyric sheet containing just the words with no arrangements. Having no idea what the songs were going to sound like, he then created the vocal arrangements for the songs during the two days of recording.

St. Holmes also sang lead vocal on several of the album's songs, including the single "Dog Eat Dog". He officially returned to the group after Free-for-Alls release, and performed on the subsequent tour. Band management asked him to return at the request of Epic Records.
