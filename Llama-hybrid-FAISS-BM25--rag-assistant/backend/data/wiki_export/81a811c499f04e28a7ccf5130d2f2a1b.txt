Postcards is an Australian holiday and travel television series on the Nine Network.

History 
There were originally three different versions of Postcards, each produced and broadcast within its specific city or market. In 1995, Adelaide's Nine Network produced their first series. It promoted holiday spots within South Australia, encouraging viewers to travel within their state. Soon after, the Nine Network  in Melbourne launched their own state-based version and Nine Network in Perth followed in 1999 with Postcards WA.

In 2007, WIN Television purchased Nine Network in Adelaide and Perth. The Perth-based Postcards WA was then renamed Postcards Australia and expanded to cover more parts of the country, using reporters positioned across the WIN network, and in 2011 they axed the original Adelaide-based Postcards SA.

In March 2016, Postcards moved to a new Friday night timeslot and one hour format for Perth, Adelaide, Melbourne markets. Rebecca Judd hosted the show alongside presenters Livinia Nixon, Lauren Phillips, Brodie Harper, Shane Crawford, Glen Moriarty, Scherri-Lee Biggs, Warren Tredrea and celebrity chef Shane Delia.
