School history
Preston High School came into being with the consolidation of Bruceton High, Central Preston High, East Preston High and  West Preston High. The school was built in Kingwood on the same campus as the existing vocational and academic center. This consolidation and the building of the new campus opened in 1992. Originally, Preston High only enrolled students from grades 10–12, but in the fall of 1998, the middle school concept was established in Preston County, and ninth graders joined the student body.  The school enrollment has been approximately 1,400 since then.
The high school was also the home of Central Preston Middle School from 2005 to 2015, due to building issues in the old middle school facility.
