In September 2013, Madrona opened its Primary Annex (Kindergarten to Grade 3) at 2678 West Broadway, a location shared with Pear Tree Education. Madrona left 2678 West Broadway in June 2016. It divided its students between two campuses, Madrona West, located at 2040/2050 West 10th (Kindergarten to Grade 5), and Madrona Downtown, located at 530 Hornby Street (Grades 6 to 10).
