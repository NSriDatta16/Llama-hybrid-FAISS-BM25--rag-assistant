Gallamine triethiodide (Flaxedil) is a non-depolarising muscle relaxant. It acts by combining with the cholinergic receptor sites in muscle and competitively blocking the transmitter action of acetylcholine. Gallamine is a non-depolarising type of blocker as it binds to the acetylcholine receptor but does not have the biological activity of acetyl choline. Gallamine triethiodide has a parasympatholytic effect on the cardiac vagus nerve, which causes tachycardia and occasionally hypertension. Very high doses cause histamine release.
Presence of iodine makes it radio opaque, and its ampule in a bag at airport's x-ray scanner raise the false suspicion of a bullet in the bag.
 
Gallamine triethiodide was commonly used to prevent muscle contractions during surgical procedures, but now superseded by new neuromuscular blocking drugs with less side effects.

It was developed by Daniel Bovet in 1947.

The drug is no longer marketed in the United States, according to the FDA Orange Book.
