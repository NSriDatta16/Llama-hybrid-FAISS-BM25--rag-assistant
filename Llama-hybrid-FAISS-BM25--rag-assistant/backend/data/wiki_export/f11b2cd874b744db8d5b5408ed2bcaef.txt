Houston Methodist Hospital is the flagship quaternary care hospital of Houston Methodist academic medical center. Located in the Texas Medical Center in Houston, Texas, Houston Methodist Hospital was established in 1919 during the height of the Spanish influenza epidemic as an outreach ministry of Methodist Episcopal Church. Houston Methodist comprises eight hospitals, an academic institute, a primary care group, and more than 300 locations throughout greater Houston.

The hospital has consistently ranked as "One of America's Best Hospitals" according to U.S. News & World Report. The hospital has earned worldwide recognition in multiple specialties including cardiovascular surgery, cancer, epilepsy treatment and organ transplantation.

Houston Methodist System changed its official name to Houston Methodist in 2013.

History

Originally located near downtown Houston, after a $1 million donation from Lillie and Hugh Roy Cullen, the hospital relocated to the Texas Medical Center and opened a 300-bed facility in 1951.

Michael DeBakey 
Heart surgeon Michael E. DeBakey (1908–2008), a faculty member and later Chancellor Emeritus of Baylor College of Medicine, performed the first removal of a carotid artery blockage (1950); the first aorto-coronary bypass surgery (1964); the first use of a ventricular assist device to pump blood and support a diseased heart (1966); and some of the first U.S. heart transplants (1968 and 1969) at the hospital. DeBakey also created the first Dacron graft (1953).

Flooding and storms

1976 flood 
In 1976, unusually heavy rains caused more than $20 million in flood-related damage in the Texas Medical Center, knocking out power at three hospitals. Six feet of water filled Methodist's basement.

Tropical Storm Allison 
On June 8, 2001, Tropical Storm Allison dropped up to 37 inches of rain on parts of Houston, causing the worst flooding in the city's history up until that time, with serious damage to the Texas Medical Center. About 40 feet of water filled Methodist Hospital's basement and entered the neurosensory building. The hospital discharged 400 patients and did not fully reopen until five weeks after the storm. The flooding caused an estimated $360 million in damage.

Expansion 
Consisting of the existing Texas Medical Center facility and several newly constructed regional hospitals, Houston Methodist was established in 1996 to extend health services beyond the Texas Medical Center and into communities throughout Houston.

Research
Houston Methodist, the University of Houston, and Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University jointly founded the Institute for Biomedical Imaging Science. The institute will create interdisciplinary programs in biomedical imaging and will develop joint training programs to produce basic and applied scientists.

Also, beginning in 2019 Texas A&M Health Science Center College of Medicine in partnership with Houston Methodist Hospital will launch the EnMed program which is an innovative Engineering Medicine program designed to educate a new kind of physician who will create transformational technology for health care.

COVID-19 vaccine requirement 
Houston Methodist hospital has required its employees to get the COVID-19 vaccine by June 7, 2021. It was the nation's first hospital system to require its employees to get vaccinated against COVID-19, a disease that, as of June 2021, had caused more than 3.7 million deaths worldwide.

As part of the mandate, the hospital system's 26,000 employees were required to get their first COVID-19 shot by June 7, 2021. This wasn't the first vaccine the hospital had mandated. The flu vaccine has been mandated for all Houston Methodist employees since 2009.

Ultimately, 99% of employees complied with the hospital's COVID-19 mandate. Less than 0.6% of employees quit or were fired because they refused to get vaccinated, and a small number of employees were exempt or allowed to defer for medical reasons.

Prior to taking action on the June 7 vaccination deadline, the hospital first suspended the 178 employees who were not yet vaccinated. During this two-week suspension, 25 more employees got vaccinated.

Dr. Marc Boom, CEO of Houston Methodist, said as healthcare workers, we have "a sacred obligation to care for patients" and that mandating the vaccine was consistent with "our responsibility to keep patients safe". More recently, Dr. Boom has also said he has no regrets about his decision, adding that the mandate was "the best decision we ever made." The hospital's CEO credits it to keeping 300 employees from getting sick during the Delta surge over the 2021 summer, according to a hospital analysis. Of those who did get sick during the surge, Dr. Boom said that these employees reported less severe symptoms and, importantly, no employees died.

There was pushback against the mandate, but it was small and short-lived. 117 employees challenged the vaccine requirement by suing the hospital, claiming the vaccine was “experimental”. Many such lawsuits were backed by prominent anti-vaxxers like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The group of medical workers staged a walk out on June 7. U.S. District Judge Lynn Hughes dismissed the lawsuit on June 12, 2021, calling the plaintiff's allegations that the vaccine was experimental "false" and adding that the hospital's policy doesn't violate state or federal law and isn’t considered “coercion”. On June 22, 2021, 153 Houston Methodist employees either resigned or were terminated for refusing to be vaccinated for COVID-19.

Hospitals across the nation have since followed Houston Methodist in requiring COVID-19 vaccination for employees, with about 41% of hospitals nationwide having some sort of mandate in place as of October 2021.
