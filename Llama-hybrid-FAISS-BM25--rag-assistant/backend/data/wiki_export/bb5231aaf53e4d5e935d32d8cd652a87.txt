The Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck Cartoon Collections was a series of Disney videos compiling cartoon shorts produced between 1936 and 1954. It was a Disney attempt at releasing its stable of cartoon shorts to video under their own label, after their DiscoVision experiment. The discs were released in 1981 and 1982, two years before Disney unveiled The Disney Channel and two years also before they released Walt Disney Cartoon Classics.

There were three videos released in all, each with six shorts. Each of the six shorts presented included two cartoons each starring Mickey Mouse, two each starring Pluto and two each starring Donald Duck. There were no cartoons that starred Goofy (the only time Goofy appeared in a cartoon was if he costarred alongside Mickey and/or Donald). Other patterns seemed to include at least one 1930s Mickey short each and one short each placing Donald opposite Chip 'n' Dale. Many of the presented shorts were reissued on later Disney releases on video and DVD.
