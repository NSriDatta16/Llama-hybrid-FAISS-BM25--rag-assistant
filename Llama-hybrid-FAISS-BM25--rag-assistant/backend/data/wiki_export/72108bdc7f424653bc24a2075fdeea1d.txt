The iconic characters in Dungeons & Dragons are a series of characters developed for the 3rd edition of the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game used as recurring characters in illustrations and text explanations to illustrate archetypal D&D race and class combinations. In the case of a few classes, there is more than one iconic character, allowing for more varied iconic parties. They were created by and served as player characters for the developers during the creation and testing of the Third Edition rules.

Iconic characters are primarily of the 11 core classes; while iconic characters exist for other standard classes, they are not as well known. The iconic characters appear in a variety of Dungeons & Dragons books, including the Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, and Enemies and Allies.

The iconic characters for the core classes are also the focus of a series of Dungeon & Dragons tie-in novels by T. H. Lain, a collective pseudonym adopted by a number of Wizards of the Coast staff. Three of the characters, Lidda, Krusk, and Jozan, were used as an audio commentary on the DVD release of Dungeons & Dragons: Wrath of the Dragon God.
