Career

McCarty also appeared in a number of softcore adult films during her career. In 2008, she approached adult entertainment company Vivid Entertainment about the idea of appearing in one of their productions. McCarty stipulated in her contract with Vivid that she would have involvement with casting the film as well as writing, editing, and have final approval over everything.
