The Warwick Agreement is the name of a document agreed in July 2004 to the 2005 General Election between many of Britain's main trade unions and the Labour Party, which helped form Labour's 2005 election manifesto.

The affiliated trade unions are organised into a group called TULO (Trade Union & Labour Party Liaison Organisation).

The document is named after The University of Warwick, where the agreement was made.

Five main points

There are five main points covered by the Warwick Agreement:

Fairness at work
Pensions
Public services
Manufacturing
Other commitments

There are many principles covered by each heading (see separate sheets), including statutory pay and paid holidays, protection for pensions, sanitation improvements in the NHS, healthy eating in schools, expansion of skills programmes in the UK and more stringent limitations on interest rates and fees.

Future developments

There is a small sector that believes a new, more relevant version of the Warwick Agreement is required to clamp down on some aspects of public services.  John McDonnell MP is one of this group, quoted as saying:
“Central to this Warwick Mark II programme should be the end of privatisation, the promotion of public ownership and public services, and the implementation of the Trade Union Freedom Bill.”
Another prominent character in this is Jon Cruddas MP, who puts a lot of emphasis on policy change and improving Trade Union rights.
