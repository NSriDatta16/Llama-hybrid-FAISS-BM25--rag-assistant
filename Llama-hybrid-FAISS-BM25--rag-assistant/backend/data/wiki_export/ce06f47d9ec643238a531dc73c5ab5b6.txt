He was a member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh from 1943, and was even jailed after the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi.

Known as the Bhishma Pitamaha of the Bharatiya Janata Party in Bihar, Mishra was away from direct political activities for the last two years of his life due to old age, but remained a source of inspiration for the party.
