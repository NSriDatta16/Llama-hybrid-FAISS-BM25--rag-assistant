Konolfingen is a municipality in the Bern-Mittelland administrative district in the canton of Bern in Switzerland.

History 

Konolfingen village is first mentioned in 1148 as Chonolfingen. It is a relatively new municipality, having been formed from the union of Gysenstein and Stalden in 1933.

While the current municipality is relatively new, Konolfingen village was an important local administrative center. Under the Counts of Kyburg and later the city of Bern, Konolfingen was the center of a district, the home of the high court and the execution grounds. Originally the town was owned by the Lords of Krauchtal, but in either 1397 or 1424, they donated Konolfingen to Thorberg Abbey. In 1528, Bern adopted the Protestant Reformation and secularized all the Abbey's lands. It became part of the bailiwick of Thorberg and was combined with Walkringen to form a single court. However, the village remained an administrative center until the creation of the Helvetic Republic in 1798. In 1814, due to the lack of suitable buildings in Konolfingen, Schlosswil became the administrative center and court for the district of Konolfingen.

Throughout most of its history it was part of the parish of Münsingen. A filial church was built in Konolfingen in 1898 and in 1911, the villages broke away to form the parish of Stalden. The Stalden name only remained for a year, in 1912 it was renamed Konolfingen parish. A Catholic church was built in the municipality in 1967.

Much of the land around the village was too swampy to farm until a drainage project in 1845–55 and the Kiesen river correction project of 1911–15 opened up the land. Following the first drainage project, traffic began to move through the area near Konolfingen. Between 1851 and 1856 the village of Stalden grew in an important stopping place on the Aare valley-Emmental and Burgdorf-Thun roads. In 1864, the Bern-Langnau railroad built a station in the land between Konolfingen and Stalden. This was followed in 1899 by a connection to the Burgdorf-Thun railroad. The convenient transportation links encouraged the Berneralpen dairy to build a factory between the two villages. The first factory brought several other businesses to the villages and led to growth. In 1933 the communities of Gysenstein (which included Konolfingen village) and Stalden merged to form the municipality of Konolfingen. The new municipality continued to grow and in 1949, a secondary school opened.
