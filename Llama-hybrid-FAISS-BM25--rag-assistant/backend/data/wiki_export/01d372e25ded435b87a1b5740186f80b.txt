Central Español Fútbol Club, usually known simply as Central Español is a Uruguayan football club based in Montevideo.

History

The F.U.F era
Together with Peñarol, Central founded FUF (Uruguayan football federation) in 1923 after being expelled from AUF. The FUF even made a parallel Uruguay national team (dissident to AUF) that played several international games based on Peñarol and Central squads. After 3 years of existence the new federation was dissolved and both teams returned to AUF.

Merging
Central append "Español" to its name after an agreement signed with a Spanish group in 1971. Central itself was born from a merge between "Solís Bochas" and "Soriano Polideportivo".
