National League final standings

Events
January 19 - Boston Beaneaters catcher Marty Bergen, reportedly depressed by his son's death in 1898, allegedly kills his family with an ax and then commits suicide in Brookfield, Massachusetts.
February 17 - Due to unpaid alimony, Mary H. Vanderbeck takes possession of the American League franchise in Detroit. Her ex-husband, George Vanderbeck, will later regain control of the team.
March 8 - The National League decides to downsize to eight teams for the upcoming season by eliminating the circuit's franchises in Baltimore, Cleveland, Louisville, and Washington.
March 9 - Infielders John O'Brien, Art Madison, George Fox, and pitcher Jack Chesbro are transferred from the defunct Louisville Colonels franchise to the Pittsburgh Pirates. 
April 19 – In Boston, the Phillies win 19–17 in the NL's highest scoring opening day game. Boston tied the game with 9 runs in the ninth. Philadelphia, once up 16–4, scores 2 in the 10th for the win.
May 5 – The Orphans' Jimmy Ryan hits his 20th career leadoff homer against the visiting Cincinnati Reds and Noodles Hahn. Chicago wins 4–3.
June 5 - Pirates' first baseman Duff Cooley has only two putouts in a 6-5 loss to the Phillies 
June 19 - Clark Griffith and Rube Waddell have a duel for the ages. Each throw 13 shut out innings before Griffith hits a walk off double in the 14th.
June 21 - Citing the Superbas' poor attendance at Brooklyn's Washington Park, National League president Ned Young discusses the possibility of moving the franchise to Washington, D.C. The reigning NL champions, en route to their second consecutive title, are averaging only a thousand fans on non-holiday dates.
June 22 - Umpire Hank O'Day forfeits the game to the Brooklyn Superbas when the Philadelphia Phillies stall in the bottom of the 11th inning, hoping the delay postpones the game due to darkness. Brooklyn had scored seven runs in the top of the frame to pull ahead 20-13.
July 4 – At the West Side Grounds, about 1,000 of the 10,000 fans at the game fire pistols to celebrate July 4. No injuries were reported.  Meanwhile, Chicago beats Philadelphia, 5–4, in 12 innings.
July 7 – Kid Nichols of the Boston Beaneaters records his 300th career win.
July 12 – Noodles Hahn pitches a no-hitter for the Cincinnati Reds against the Philadelphia Phillies.  The Reds win, 4–0.
July 13 – The Phillies' third baseman, Harry Wolverton, has 3 triples among his 5 hits in a 23–8 win over the Pirates.
July 17 – The Giants' Christy Mathewson, acquired from Norfolk of the North Carolina League, makes his major league debut, relieving in the 5th inning against Brooklyn at Washington Park with the score tied, 5–5. The results are less than glowing: 2 walks, 3 hit batters, 5 runs. Ed Doheny relieves Mathewson after 4; the Superbas win the game, 13–7.
July 26 - In Brooklyn, a sheriff seizes the St. Louis Cardinals share of the gate receipts in order to pay former Cardinals pitcher Gus Weyhing, who'd claimed the Cardinals had not paid him for his services before releasing him. Weyhing would later sign with Brooklyn as a free agent. 
August 17 - Reds pitcher Bill Phillips punches Phillies hitter Roy Thomas after Thomas fouled off 12 straight pitches. Phillips is ejected, but the Reds win in extra innings.
August 19 - After being promised by manager Connie Mack that he could take the next few days off, Rube Waddell pitches both games in a double header for Milwaukee of the Western League. In game one, Waddell threw for 17 innings, and followed that up by taking a one hitter into the fifth inning of the second game, in total, Waddell pitched 22 innings worth of baseball in one day. 
August 22 - The Chicago Orphans acquire catcher Roger Bresnahan, only to release him after he appeared in two games. Bresnahan would go on to have a hall of fame career catching for the New York Giants.
September 11 Catcher Johnny Kling makes his MLB debut for the Chicago Orphans. Kling doesn't get a hit in his debut, but he'd go on to be the Orphans (later re-named the Cubs) starting catcher for the next several seasons.
September 17 - Tommy Corcoran leaves his shortstop position and begins digging around the third base coaching box with his spikes. The Reds' captain uncovers a metal box with an electrical device inside with attached wires which is most likely being used by the Phillies in a sophisticated scheme to steal signs. 
December 15 - The Cincinnati Reds trade pitcher Christy Mathewson to the New York Giants for pitcher Amos Rusie, who hadn't pitched in a game since 1898. This trade becomes one of the first ever "flops": Mathewson goes on to a Hall of Fame career with the Giants, while Rusie doesn't even last a full season in Cincinnati.
