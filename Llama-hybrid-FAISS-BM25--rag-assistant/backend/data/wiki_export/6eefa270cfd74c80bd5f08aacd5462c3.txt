Darby was named in honor of Ensign Marshall E. Darby (1918–1941), who fell overboard, while serving aboard the battleship , during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. The ship was launched 29 May 1943 by Philadelphia Navy Yard, sponsored by Mrs. M. E. Darby, and commissioned 15 November 1943.

1944–1947
Clearing Philadelphia on 19 January 1944, Darby sailed on escort duty to Bora Bora, Society Islands, and Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides, and arrived at Guadalcanal on 20 March. She operated with Task Force 31 in the Solomons until 23 July, among other duties screening the landings on Emirau Island on 10 April. From 23 July, she escorted convoys among the islands of Guadalcanal, Eniwetok, New Hebrides, Manus, and Majuro. After a brief overhaul at Pearl Harbor from 8 to 24 October, she served on convoy duty between Guam and Eniwetok until mid-November. On 15 November, she conducted a hunter-killer patrol off Ponape, then fired a shore bombardment on Tanga Islands before returning to Eniwetok. Three days later, she sailed by way of Kwajalein, Guadalcanal, and Manus for exercises in Milne Bay, New Guinea from 7 to 26 December in preparation for the Lingayen assault.

Darby sortied from Manus on 2 January 1945 screening transports to Lingayen Gulf, Luzon, to reinforce the troops there. Arriving 11 January, she remained in the Philippines on escort and patrol duties until 28 February when she cleared for Ulithi to join a convoy carrying garrison troops for Iwo Jima. She arrived off the island 18 March, remaining there on patrol until 27 March when she sailed to escort transports to Eniwetok. She continued on to Pearl Harbor, arriving 12 April for repairs.

Darby was training in the Hawaiian area when the war ended and on 29 August 1945 got underway for San Francisco, carrying servicemen eligible for discharge. After an overhaul she sailed for the east coast, arriving at New York on 15 December and at New London, Connecticut on 8 January 1946. She sailed out of New London for training and exercises until 16 January 1947 when she cleared for Charleston, South Carolina. Darby was placed out of commission in reserve there on 28 April 1947.
