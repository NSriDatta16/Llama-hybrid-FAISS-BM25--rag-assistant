Ballinamuck () is a village in north County Longford, Ireland. It is around 15 km north of Longford town.

It was the scene of the Battle of Ballinamuck, where a French army aiding the United Irishmen rebellion of 1798 was defeated. The French soldiers were eventually repatriated. The Irish prisoners were taken to St Johnstown - today's Ballinalee - where they were executed in what is known locally as Bullys Acre and buried there. Ballinamuck is twinned with the French town of Essert.
