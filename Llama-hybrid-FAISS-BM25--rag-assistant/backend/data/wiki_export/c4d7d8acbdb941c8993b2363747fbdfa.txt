After winning the International St. Gervais in late August 1979, the pair went on to take gold at the Nebelhorn Trophy and silver at the 1979 Norton Skate (the inaugural Skate America). They placed second at the 1980 U.S. Championships and were assigned to their first Winter Olympics, where they finished fifth.

The pair won their first U.S. national title in 1981 and stepped onto the World podium at the 1982 World Championships. In 1984, after winning their fourth national title, they were sent to their second Winter Olympics and won the silver medal.

Following the 1984 Winter Olympics, the Carruthers siblings starred with "Ice Capades" and "Stars on Ice" for twelve years. They appeared throughout the world in many productions and made for television specials during their twelve-year career as professionals. They were inducted into the Adoption Hall of Fame in 1996 and into the United States Figure Skating Hall of Fame in 1999.
