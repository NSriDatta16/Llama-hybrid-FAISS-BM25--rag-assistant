The NCAA Division III Men's Golf Championships is the annual golf tournament, typically played in mid-May, to determine the team and individual national champions of men's collegiate golf in the United States. It has been played annually since 1975, when it split-away from the NCAA College Division Men's Golf Championships when the NCAA split into its current three-division structure.

It is a stroke play team competition, but there is also an award for the lowest scoring individual competitor.

Methodist is the most successful program, with 13 national titles.

Carnegie Mellon is the reigning national champions.
