Plot
Nathan 'Nat' Field is a young boy from Greenville, North Carolina. He was recruited by Arby, a diligent play producer (who can come off rude), to join the Company of boys. They intend  on reenacting A Midsummer's Night's Dream and Julius Caesar in London, at the re-built Globe theatre, just as they had done in Shakespeare's time. He is chosen to be Puck in a Midsummer Night's Dream and Pindarus in Julius Caesar. As he was going to their first rehearsal he feels odd and can smell some foul stench. He returns to the house in which he was staying with a family and he feels ill and goes to bed early. He wakes up in a different room with a boy he doesn't recognise talking to him in a heavy Elizabethan accent. He says he thought he had the plague and is relieved to see him better. He realises he travelled back 400 years in time, to the year 1599, when the Globe Theatre was first built. He meets William Shakespeare and acts with him in the play he had rehearsed for in his own time, and experiences theater as it was originally intended. Before he knows it, he is back in the hospital bed, awake and unsure whether what he experienced was real. Later, Rachel Levin and Gil Warmun, his co-actors from the present time, try to find out who he was 400 years ago.

Synopsis

Nathan Field, a talented young actor, arrives at the newly rebuilt Globe theatre in London to play Puck in A 'Midsummer's Night's dream. As rehearsals begin, eerie echoes of the past begin to haunt Nat and he falls ill with a mysterious sickness. 
When he wakes, Nat finds himself in 1599, an actor at the original Globe - and his co-star is none other than the King of Shadows himself: William Shakespeare.
Nat's new life is full of excitement, danger, and the passionate friendship that he has longed for since the tragic death of his parents. But why has he been sent to the past - and is he trapped there forever?
