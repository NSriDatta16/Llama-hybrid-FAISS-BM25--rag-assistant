Deborah ( Deborah) appears in the Hebrew Bible as the nurse of Rebecca (Genesis 35:8). She is first mentioned by name in the Torah when she dies in a place called Alon Bachot (אלון בכות), "Tree of Weepings" (Genesis 35:8), and is buried by Jacob, who is returning with his large family to Canaan.

According to Rashi, Deborah was sent by Laban to care for his sister Rebecca when the latter went to marry Isaac (Genesis 24:59). After Rebecca's son Jacob had been away from home for 22 years, Rebecca dispatched her loyal nurse to tell Jacob that it was safe for him to return home. The elderly nurse delivered her message and died on the return journey.

In the Book of Jasher 
According to the Book of Jasher, Deborah was the daughter of Uz, who was the first son of Milcah and Nahor. Deborah joined Rebecca, her cousin, on her journey to marry Isaac. Rebecca later sent Deborah with two of Isaac's servants to Haran to find Jacob and ask him to return to his father's house in the land of Canaan. She remained in Haran with Jacob and stayed to tend to his wives and children, while the other servants returned. Later, God told Jacob to move to Bethel and make an altar, and Deborah died there and was buried under an oak.
