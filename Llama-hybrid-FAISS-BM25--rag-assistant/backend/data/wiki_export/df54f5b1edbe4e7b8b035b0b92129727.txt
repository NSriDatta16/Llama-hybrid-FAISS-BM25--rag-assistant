The SummerStage is an outdoor stage in a natural amphitheater that hosts shows including plays, musicals, and dance as well as summer theater camps.

Hausmann Nature Center 
In 1984, Bernice and Dr. Paul Haussmann donated their 8700-square-foot home to the state of Wisconsin to be converted into a nature center that would promote environmental education. The three-story 1960s building features a "rustic contemporary design" with elements of fieldstone, glass, and wood. Madison-area architect Mark Alan Kraft created the final blueprint for the  rehabilitation from private residence into nature center. The center opened in June 2012.

The nature center is open two weekends a month to showcase displays and host programming; the center is staffed by volunteers. It is also available to rent for private events.

Lapham Peak

The park takes its name from a hill found within its borders. Lapham Peak has an elevation of  above sea level, and is the highest point in Waukesha County. At the top of Lapham Peak is a wooden observation tower that is  high and offers a dynamic view of southeastern Wisconsin and the northern edge of Illinois. The Waukesha County Historical Society named the peak in memory of Increase A. Lapham to honor his efforts in scientific study and his founding of the United States Weather Bureau.

History
The Lapham Peak area was formed 10,000 years ago by a glacier that covered much of Wisconsin (see Wisconsin glaciation). Examples of moraines, eskers and kettles can be found in the park. The peak itself is a moulin kame.

The land was developed in 1851 by Charles Hanson as a tourist attraction. He built a  tower on top of the hill and charged visitors to picnic and climb the tower. Originally known as Stoney Hill, the hill was later named Government Hill, after the government teams that used it for surveying.

In 1870, the Army Signal Corps built a signal station to relay data about approaching storms from Pikes Peak, Colorado, to Great Lakes ports. Pioneering meteorologist Increase A. Lapham, who proposed the creation of a National Weather Service, made weather observations here and issued the first published national weather forecast.

The state of Wisconsin purchased the land in 1907 for a tuberculosis sanitarium, which later became the Ethan Allen School for Boys. In 1939,  of the land was turned over to the Conservation Department for use as a park. The peak's  tower was erected a year later by a crew from the WPA (Works Project Administration) who also constructed trails, picnic grounds and benches.
