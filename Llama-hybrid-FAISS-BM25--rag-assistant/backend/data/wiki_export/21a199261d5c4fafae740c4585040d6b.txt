The Umbria Jazz Festival, directed by Carlo Pagnetta, is one of the most important jazz festivals in the world and has been held annually since 1973.  Today, the summer festival runs for 10 days in Perugia, capital of Umbria. The original plan was to hold events throughout the region of Umbria and indeed the Umbria Jazz Winter Festival takes place annually in December/January in Orvieto.
