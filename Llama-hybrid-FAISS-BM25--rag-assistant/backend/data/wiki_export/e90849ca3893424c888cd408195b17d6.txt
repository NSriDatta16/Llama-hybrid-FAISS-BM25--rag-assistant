Nâdiya is the third studio album from Algerian-French R&B singer Nâdiya. The album was released on June 5, 2006 in France. Also, a DVD with a runtime of 26 minutes was released with it containing interviews and a "The Making of The Album" documentary.

Album information
The lead single from the album, "Tous ces mots" ("All These Words"), peaked at number 2 in the French singles chart. The song was released in February 2006 and features Smartzee, who is also featured in her 2004 single "Et c'est parti..." ("Here We Go"). The second single, "Roc" ("Rock"), was released on June 19 in France, also entering and peaking the French Singles Top 100 at number 2 and stayed there for four consecutive weeks. It became her longest running single in the top ten, being 11 weeks in the top 10 (as well as in the top 5). "Amies-ennemies" was chosen to be the third single from the album and debuted at number four in France. The singles were less successful in Switzerland, where they all were released too. They all managed to peak within the top 40, but none of them charted in the top 20.

The album entered the French Album Top 200 at number one in the same week it was released. It then slowly descended in positions, dropping to number 2, then 3, 4 and 5. It spent a total of nine weeks in the top 10 and (as of February 10) 35 weeks in the top 100. It has been certified platinum for sales over 300,000 in France by SNEP.

In the country's album year-end chart, Nâdiya peaked at number 34. As of June 22, the album is the 272nd best-performing album in the chart history of France, with the preceding album 16/9 peaking at number 96.

Two weeks prior to its release, "Roc" had peaked at #2 (with Shakira's Hips Don't Lie being #1) in Virgin Mega.fr's Top 100 singles.

The album is the first Nâdiya album to debut at the top position in France. It is also her first album to reach the number one position in France.

SNEP revealed the best-selling singles during the first quarter of 2006 (from January 1 - March 31, 2006). Despite being released four weeks before the first quarter of 2006 ended, the "Tous ces mots" single managed the song to peak at number thirteen.
