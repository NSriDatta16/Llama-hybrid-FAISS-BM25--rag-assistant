Casting
In August 2005, it was announced that a new family would be introduced to the show. The three-strong family consisted of widower Alex Kinski (Andrew Clarke) and his two teenage children; Rachel (Caitlin Stasey) and Zeke. Actor Matthew Werkmeister was cast as Zeke. The actor was on holiday when he was invited to attend the audition. However, he almost missed out on the role when his father took the call about the audition and refused to drive the five hours it took to get there. Werkmeister said that he was "horrified" when he found out and called his agent back to find out if he could still attend the audition, which he was. Werkmeister received a call back and he performed a scene with Stasey. Four days later, he was told he had won the part and he commented that he was "absolutely ecstatic".

Development

Characterisation
In his fictional backstory, Zeke is the intelligent son of Francesca and Alex and the younger brother of Katya (Dichen Lachman) and Rachel. Rachel and Zeke were home-schooled by their parents and they led sheltered lives until they enrolled at Erinsborough High. Katya was thrown out of the home following Francesca's death and Zeke had no contact with her. The official Neighbours website credits Zeke with the nickname "Zeke the freak" and describe him as originally being a "kooky outcast" and "supremely bright but socially inept". They also describe him as always seeing life as black and white, usually finding it hard to adjust to new situations. One of Zeke's earliest storylines was dealing with the death of his father, in the aftermath Zeke was seen refusing to talk, using it as a coping mechanism. Of the plot Werkmeister stated: "I'm glad that story is over, it was annoying trying to find those damn cards with words! Although it was nice doing something different for a while."

Zeke was initially portrayed as being anti-social and clever, leading fans to believe he could have the characteristics of Asperger's Syndrome, of this Werkmeister explained: "It wasn't really written at first, so me and the writers made up his quirks." As his character progressed the writing changed as Zeke grew older, of this Werkmeister stated: "I think Zeke is now starting to grow out of it as he meets new people and picks up how to be more social, but he will always be very knowledgeable." Zeke's storylines began to take a more adult theme at the end of 2007, writers introduced a series of changes to his character, of this Werkmeister commented: “Zeke is about to make the transition from little boy to grown-up teenager, which will be good for me because I can broaden his character traits, he becomes more socially aware and gets a new girlfriend.” Werkmeister has spoken of his love of watching Zeke grow up over the years on-screen.

Departure
In 2009, media reports circulated that Werkmeister was planning on quitting the program. However, it was confirmed shortly after that he was committed to the role, as a spokesperson for Neighbours commented, "Matt Werkmeister is on a contract with Neighbours which will take him well into next year."

In October 2010, it was announced that Werkmeister had quit Neighbours along with two other members of the cast. Werkmeister said "When I started on Neighbours I was only thirteen, I didn't shave or drive a car so I really have grown up on the show. I've learnt so much, worked with some great people who are now some of my closest friends."

Return
On 10 February 2014, it was announced that Werkmeister would be returning to Neighbours for a brief guest stint. The actor has already filmed his scenes for "a special celebration episode". Werkmeister's on-screen step mother and father, Jackie Woodburne and Alan Fletcher said it was good to have him back for their 20th year with Neighbours and Woodburne commented, "It seems like yesterday that Matt walked on set as a young boy still at primary school, and suddenly now he's a grown man! We have shared a lot of fun storylines as well as a few tragic ones, the full gamut." Werkmeister later said that Zeke would return with a secret, which will surprise everyone. He also explained that during his time away, Zeke has travelled the world and has been studying. Werkmeister added that Zeke still wears vests and flamboyant shirts. Werkmeister's return scenes as Zeke aired from 7 April 2014.

In other media
In 2009, Neighbours became the first Australian series to establish Twitter accounts for its characters. Zeke was one of four characters to have an account set up, with the others being Declan, Donna and Ringo. They began sending daily updates to their fans, which are "complementary to the show's on-air storylines". FremantleMedia Enterprises vice-president of licensing Ben Liebmann said, "We thought it was a really great way to continue or allow the audience to engage with the Neighbours world off-screen". The messages are overseen by the Fremantle digital team, which is integrated with the story department of the Neighbours production team.

Reception
For his portrayal of Zeke, Werkmeister was nominated for Best Young Actor at the 2008 Inside Soap Awards. Conrad Walters from The Sydney Morning Herald branded the character "Zeke the Freak". Ruth Deller from entertainment website Lowculture profiled Zeke in one of her monthly columns featuring popular and unpopular soap opera characters. She called him irritating stating, "I have often stuck up for Zeke in the past whilst others have derided him. After all, losing both parents at a young age and having Katya, Rachel and Libby for sisters seem fairly good reasons for him acting like an arse. I don’t even mind the OCD storyline, though I suspect I'm in a minority there. However, even I have to concede that he's been acting like a twat lately, and mooning over Sunny, of all people, is not going to win me back around."
