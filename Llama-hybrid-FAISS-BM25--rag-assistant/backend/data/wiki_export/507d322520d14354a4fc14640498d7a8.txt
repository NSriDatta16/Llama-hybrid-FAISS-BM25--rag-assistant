DeKalb Avenue is a thoroughfare in the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, with the majority of its length in Brooklyn. 

It runs from Woodward Avenue (Linden Hill Cemetery) in Ridgewood, Queens to Downtown Brooklyn, terminating at the Fulton Mall where the Brooklyn Tower and City Point cross. 

DeKalb Avenue is named after Baron Johann de Kalb, who served in the American Revolutionary War.

Notable buildings
Landmarks along the avenue include the Pratt Institute, Fort Greene Park, the Brooklyn Hospital Center, the DeKalb and Marcy branches of the Brooklyn Public Library, Long Island University's Brooklyn Campus, Brooklyn Technical High School, and Junior's.
