History
The town began in 1940 when three landowners give land to install a town which would be called Planura Verde (Green Plain).  The settlement began to grow around a football field where locals came on Sunday to watch the games and pray at the foot of a cross.  Soon the first houses were built.  In 1943 the Arraial (village) was elevated to the category of district of Piracanjuba.  It received the name "Cromínia" due to the great quantity of chrome in the region.  In 1954 the district became a municipality.
