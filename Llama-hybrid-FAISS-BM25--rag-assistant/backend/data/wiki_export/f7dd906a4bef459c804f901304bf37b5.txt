History
The first school classes were held in Hurricane in 1906 in the living room of Ira E. Bradshaw's home, consisting of grades one through eight. Hurricane's first high school class graduated in the 1927– school year.

A two-story red brick high school building was built during the Great Depression with help from the federal government's Works Progress Administration. The building was completed and the school opened just after Thanksgiving in 1936.

The school chose the colors red and black because those are the colors on a hurricane warning flag. The school originally chose the Red Devil as its mascot in the mid-1920s, but  many of the students' parents complained due to the big LDS church influence in the town.Shortly after the complaints from parents, the school then had a student vote between the Blue Jays, Black Pirates and Tigers. The students voted for the tiger as their new mascot, and it was an animal that could be rendered easily in black and red.

In 1974, a new gymnasium and three classrooms were completed at the school site. Students walked between the old high school building and the new building for classes. In 1978, classrooms and a cafeteria were added, and grades 9–12 moved to the new building. The old building remained in use for other grades until it was demolished in the spring of 2004. An auditorium, auxiliary gym, and administrative office areas were added in 1996. In 2001, a science hall was added and named for the outgoing principal, Robert Goulding.

The school's enrollment growth forced an expansion of the existing building. The expansion opened in 2012.

Daniel McKeehan is the principal at Hurricane High School, replacing former principal Darin Thomas in 2023.
