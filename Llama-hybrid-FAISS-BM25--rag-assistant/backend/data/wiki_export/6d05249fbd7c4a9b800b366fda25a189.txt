CHESS Magazine (), also called CHESS and previously called CHESS Monthly, is a chess magazine published monthly in the United Kingdom by Chess and Bridge Limited. CHESS was founded by Baruch Harold Wood in 1935 in Sutton Coldfield. Wood edited it until 1988, when it was taken over by Pergamon Press and changed its name to Pergamon Chess. It became Macmillan Chess in 1989 and Maxwell Macmillan Chess Monthly in 1991. Current executive editor Malcolm Pein purchased Chess and Bridge from the Robert Maxwell estate.
