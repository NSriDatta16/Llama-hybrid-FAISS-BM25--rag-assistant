The American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) was founded in 1931. The society is composed of surgeons certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery or by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada who perform Plastic and Reconstructive surgery. ASPS comprises 92% of all board-certified plastic surgeons in the United States and has more than 11,000 plastic surgeons worldwide. ASPS publishes the plastic surgery journal, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery.

ASPS runs The Plastic Surgery Foundation (The PSF), which supports research by ASPS members through grants, awards and scholarships. The foundation also funds educational research programs.
