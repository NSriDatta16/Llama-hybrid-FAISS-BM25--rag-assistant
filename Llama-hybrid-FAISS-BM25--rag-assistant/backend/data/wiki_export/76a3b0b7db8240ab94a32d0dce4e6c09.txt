"The One on the Right Is on the Left" is a country song written by Jack Clement. It was recorded by Johnny Cash on November 29, 1965, and included on his novelty album Everybody Loves a Nut (1966). It was the album's third and most successful single (see 1966 in music), reaching #2 on the U.S. Billboard Country Singles chart and #46 on Billboards Pop Singles chart.

Content
The song is a humorous criticism of musicians that put their political views into their music. It tells the story of a  folk song group that is "long on musical ability", but ultimately breaks up due to political differences.
At the end of the song, a warning is given not to mix politics with one's music.

The punch line to the joke is that "the guy in the rear", is less easily labeled: he is a Methodist and he burned his driver's license (rather than his draft card), etc. Indeed, the song closes by stating that he got drafted.
