December 22 – Verdict of the Trial of the 114 in Catanzaro. Anti-Mafia judge Cesare Terranova had signed the order to send the men to trial in 1965. The defendants were accused of crimes relating to the First Mafia War. Amongst those on trial were the heads of the opposing factions in the Mafia War, Salvatore Greco and Angelo La Barbera, as well as the man who had actually triggered the war by framing La Barbera, Michele Cavataio. Also there were Giuseppe Calo and Luciano Leggio. The trial opened in December 1967. It resulted in few convictions, with several of those being just for "organized delinquency". This only carried a sentence of a few years, and most of those convicted of it were released instantly thanks to time already served. The longest sentence was handed to Angelo La Barbera, who was given twenty-two-years for ordering the kidnap and murder of two rival mobsters who had vanished in 1963 after they were seen being bundled off the streets; someone who witnessed the kidnapping testified for the prosecution despite death threats, one of the few witnesses to do so. Tommaso Buscetta was given a thirteen-year sentence for kidnapping the men but his conviction was in absentia because he was not present at the trial. He had fled Sicily after the Ciaculli Massacre to avoid the inevitable crackdown. Buscetta was captured in Brazil in 1973 and sent back to Sicily to serve his sentence. Salvatore Greco was sentenced to four years in absentia. No one was found guilty of the Ciaculli massacre.
