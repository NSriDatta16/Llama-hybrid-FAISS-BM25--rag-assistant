"Moaner" is a song by Underworld, first appearing in 1997 on the Batman & Robin soundtrack. It was also commercially released as a single in Germany and Japan, with promo-only releases being made available in the UK and US. Sales of the imported German release were sufficient for a UK Singles Chart entry, peaking at #89. The 7:37 "long version" (which is actually shorter than the album version) was later added as the last track on the group's 1999 album Beaucoup Fish, and omits the extended beatless ambient techno outro of the album version.

The song's bassline was ranked by Stylus Magazine at number 27 in their list of the "Top 50 Basslines of All Time". However, the same article mentions lyrics which are in fact the lyrics to the track "Push Upstairs". It might be this track that they are actually referring to.
