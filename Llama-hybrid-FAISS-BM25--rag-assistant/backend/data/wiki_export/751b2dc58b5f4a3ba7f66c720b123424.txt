James attended Holland Park School and Ealing, Hammersmith and West London College, and got involved with MUDs early, playing Essex MUD at the age of 12, in 1982.  While still at university, he worked as a god on Avalon: The Legend Lives and co-founded the Avalon dial-up service in 1990, moving services to the internet in 1994, the same year that he graduated from the University of Leeds, with a degree in Computer Science and Philosophy.  In 1995, he founded another company, Sense Internet.  In 1998, he moved to the United States to work for Sierra Online, as a designer on Middle-earth Online.

While in the United States, he met Michael Bayne and they founded Three Rings Design to create Puzzle Pirates. It was launched in 2003.

In March 2011 Three Rings announced a partnership with the BBC to create an online game based on Doctor Who.
