Bilge Umar (1936 – 8 July 2023) was a Turkish writer, researcher and jurist.

Biography
Bilge Umar was born in Karşıyaka, İzmir, Turkey in 1936. He completed his studies at the Istanbul University Law School, where he also worked, after graduation in 1958, as an assistant. Umar received his doctorate degree in 1962, with a thesis entitled Annulment Suit under Turkish Enforcement-Bankruptcy Law, before becoming an associate professor in 1967. Then he moved back to İzmir and held various managerial posts in İzmir's Ege University, aside from his career as an academician. He became one of the founders of the university's Law School, where he became the deputy to the dean, and a full professor in 1970. Prof. Dr. Bilge Umar was the Head of the Department of Public Law of Yeditepe University (Istanbul) Faculty of Law and was teaching "Civil Procedure Law" and "Appeal Procedure and Arbitration".

As much as his studies in various legal matters, he came to be known in Turkey for his popular books on ancient history (particularly on ancient cities in Anatolia).

Bilge Umar died on 8 July 2023, at the age of 87.
