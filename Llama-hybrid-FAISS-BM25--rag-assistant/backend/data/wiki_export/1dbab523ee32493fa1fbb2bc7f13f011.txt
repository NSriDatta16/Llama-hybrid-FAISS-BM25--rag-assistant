The Schützenpanzer SPz 11-2 Kurz Armoured Infantry Fighting and reconnaissance vehicle was developed for the West German army and was a minor modification of a French-designed vehicle (Hotchkiss SP1A). During the period between 1959 and 1967, the West German army received some 2,374 of these light armoured vehicles with the SPz 11-2 Kurz being developed as the reconnaissance version.  The SPz 11-2 served in cannon platoons of armored infantry battalions until 1974 and remained in service as a reconnaissance vehicle until 1982. The SPz 11-2 was replaced in the IFV role by the Marder and in the reconnaissance role by the Spähpanzer Luchs.  The SPz 11-2 saw service with the West German army only.

Its designator "Schützenpanzer Halbgruppe" already hinted on its combat role as the Infantry Fighting Vehicle ("Schützenpanzer") of a Squad ("Halbgruppe", literally "half a section", or Trupp). It was introduced besides the Schützenpanzer lang HS-30.

Armament
The only armament for the SPz 11-2 was the 20 mm Hispano-Suiza 820 L/85 cannon. The cannon has a 15x15 periscopic sight. 500 rounds of 20 mm ammunition were carried. Three smoke grenade launchers are provided for tactical and emergency concealment.
