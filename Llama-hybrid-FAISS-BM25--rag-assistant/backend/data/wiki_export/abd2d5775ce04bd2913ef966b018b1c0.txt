VTune Profiler (formerly VTune Amplifier) is a performance analysis tool for x86 based machines running Linux or Microsoft Windows operating systems. Many features work on both Intel and AMD hardware, but advanced hardware-based sampling requires an Intel-manufactured CPU.

VTune is available for free as a stand-alone tool or as part of the Intel oneAPI Base Toolkit.

Features

 Languages C, C++, Data Parallel C++ (DPC++), C#, Fortran, Java, Python, Go, OpenCL, assembly and any mix. Other native languages that follow standards can also be profiled.
 ProfilesProfiles include algorithm, microarchitecture, parallelism, I/O, system, thermal throttling and accelerators (GPU and FPGA).
 Local, Remote, Server  VTune supports local and remote performance profiling.Â  It can be run as an application with a graphical interface, as a command line or as a server accessible by multiple users via a web browser.
