was born in Hino, Tokyo. He was the captain of the sixth unit of the Shinsengumi which were a special police force for the Tokugawa regime. Inoue was the oldest unit captain of the Shinsengumi.

Like his older brother, Inoue Matsugoro, Inoue Genzaburō was also a practitioner of the Tennen Rishin-ryū and mastered all the techniques of the school in 1860.  However, it is a misconception that he lived at the Shieikan. In 1863, he joined the Rōshigumi together with Kondō Isami and other members of the Shieikan.

Inoue Genzaburō was related to Okita Rintarō (Okita Sōji's brother-in-law). 

He arrested eight members of the Ishin Shishi during the Ikedaya Affair in 1864. 

Inoue died during the Battle of Toba–Fushimi (the first battle of the Boshin War) in January 1868.
