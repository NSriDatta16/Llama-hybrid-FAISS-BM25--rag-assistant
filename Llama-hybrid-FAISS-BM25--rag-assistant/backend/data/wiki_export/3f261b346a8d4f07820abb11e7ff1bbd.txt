Daniel Hand High School is a four-year comprehensive public high school in Madison, Connecticut, United States. It serves grades 9 through 12 and is the only high school in Madison Public Schools.

History
Businessman Daniel Hand, a native of Madison, funded construction of a high school for the city in 1884 at the price of $15,000 and relinquished property ownership to the local government. Under the name of Hand Academy, it served the city until 1921, when the building was torn down and a schoolhouse for all grades was built. That school lasted forty years until Madison Public Schools constructed a purpose-built high school in 1961 and named it Daniel Hand High School.

Daniel Hand athletic teams are nicknamed the Tigers and compete in the Southern Connecticut Conference.
