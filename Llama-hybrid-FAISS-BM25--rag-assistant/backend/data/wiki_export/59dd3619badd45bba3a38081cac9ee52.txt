Hannah Ild ( Pruuli; born 12 May 1981), known professionally as  Hannah, is an Estonian songwriter, singer, and pianist of ballads and classic pop.

Early life and education
Ild's interest in music began at an early age. She began singing even before she could speak. When she was three years old, she joined the Children Music Studio. From there she went on to join the Estonian Radio Singing Studio. When she was seven, Hannah Ild joined the elite Estonian Television Music Choir. At the same time she also began to attend the Tallinn Music School. Here she realized her talent for playing piano. 
By the time she was thirteen, she had produced her first song called "Childhood Land", composing lyrics and music together, which won first place in the Estonian Children's Song Competition in 1995. She went on to produce more songs entirely of her own creation.

Hannah studied media and advertising at Tallinn University (Media and Advertising) and organizes events.

Music career
In 1997, Hannah Ild left the TV choir and began her solo career. She came in second place in the Estonian selection for the Eurovision Song Contest, performing her own song "Lonely Soul". The jury of the Estonian Association of the Phonogram Producers awarded Hannah's song "Salaja" with the Dance Hit of the Year 2001. 
The jury nominated her twice for an Estonian Music Award in the category "Female Artist of the Year" in 2003 and 2004, but she did not win. The Estonian Music and Phonogram Producers Union awarded Hannah with the Golden Record prize of the biggest selling Estonian "Female Performer of the Year 2003".

For her next album Ballaadid 2, Hannah's record label, owned by her husband, launched a $200,000–$250,000 promotion campaign. The Estonian music managers called this a "crazy experiment" considering 1.4 million people as the size of the targeted market. This accounted as the biggest budget for advertising an Estonian album in history. The buyers of the albums participated in a drawing lot of a Mercedes-Benz A-Class as the main prize. After the car was handed out to the winner, the sales numbers for the album dropped. The campaign earned Hannah Ild two Golden Record awards in Estonia: the biggest selling "Album of the Year 2005" and the biggest selling "Female Performer of the Year 2005".

Performance at England vs. Estonia football match 
Hannah Ild performed in Euro 2008 qualification match between England and Estonia in Wembley Stadium on 13 October 2007. She sang the national anthems of both countries before the match. England won the game 3:0, with goals by Wright-Phillips, Rooney and Rähn (own goal).
