Life and career

After getting discovered by song-writing duo Marina Tucaković and Aleksandar Radulović, she released her debut album, Loša sreća (Bad Luck, 1992), under Diskos. However, it was only the following year that Viki saw significant commercial success with her second release and breakout hit "Nikom nije lepše nego nama" (No One Has It Better Than Us). Her music career peaked in the early 2000s with albums Mariš li (Do You Care, 2003) and Mahi, mahi (2005), released through Grand Production. In 2006, Viki held her first solo concert in Belgrade's Sava Centar.

Since 2015, she has appeared on the televised singing competition Zvezde Granda (Grand Stars) as a judge and mentor. In 2022, she had a winning contestant as a mentor with Nermin Handžić in season fifteen.

Miljković has been married to accordion player Dragan Tašković "Taške" since 2007, with whom she has a son, Andrej, born in October the same year. It has been noted that Miljković has close friendships with singers Ceca Ražnatović and Sanja Đorđević, who served as bridesmaids at her wedding.
