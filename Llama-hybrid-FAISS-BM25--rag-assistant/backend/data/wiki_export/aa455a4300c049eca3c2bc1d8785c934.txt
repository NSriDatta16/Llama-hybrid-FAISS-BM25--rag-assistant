Model Behavior is a 2000 television film that aired on ABC's The Wonderful World of Disney anthology series. The film starred Maggie Lawson, Justin Timberlake in his film debut, and Kathie Lee Gifford, and was directed by Mark Rosman. It is based on the book Janine and Alex, Alex and Janine by Michael Graubart Levin.  It is also a modern-day gender-bending take on the story The Prince & The Pauper by Mark Twain.

Summary
Alex Burroughs is a shy, insecure teenage girl who dreams of becoming a fashion designer. While helping her father with his catering business at a party, she meets beautiful Janine Adams, a famous teen model.

Meanwhile, Janine is fed up with her manager mother making her life nothing but work. Especially after not being home when she has her first book signing, because her younger brother Max is going on a publicity tour. Through a strange coincidence, the girls meet and realize that they look identical to each other (the only real difference being that Alex has to wear glasses). Through this realization, Alex and Janine decide to swap places for a while. Alex gets to date Jason Sharp (Justin Timberlake), a young, gorgeous, but sweet, male model, while Janine gets a date with Eric Singer, the most popular guy in Alexâ€™s school. However, she has to deal with Janine's domineering mother, Deirdre (Kathie Lee Gifford).

When they start their new life, they both end up with dates for Saturday. Even though they were supposed to change back Friday, they call each other up and extend the date. Janine warns Alex to stay away from Jason because she believes that he is using her for the attention. Meanwhile, Alex warns Janine to stay away from Eric Singer. Alex's younger brother Josh tries to reveal her "Janine" secret. Towards the end when Alex wants to tell Jason that she is not Janine, but she is seen by Eric and he thinks she's cheating on him. Jason walks off on her as well. So Janine and Alex swap back the next morning. Alex is grounded but she goes to the ball and so does Janine, disguising herself as Alex. After both families show up, everyone finds out their secret. The two are able to convince their families to not be so hard on them and Eric leaves the most popular girl in school, Mindy, to be with Janine. Jason shows up having seen Josh's tape which Alex sent to him to show him the truth and dances with her.
