Night of the Living Bread is a 1990 American independent short film comedic parody of Night of the Living Dead, directed by Kevin S. O'Brien. Bread comes to life, spreads its condition throughout the United States, and preys on the living in this eight-minute film.

Plot
Two people are attacked in a cemetery by slices of bread, which is hurled at them. One of them is killed,, the other escapes in their car as more bread hurls itself at the car from offscreen. 

She makes it to a farmhouse where she and others are besieged by rampant slices of killer bread.  One person is smothered to death, leaving behind a corpse strewn with white bread. News reports speculate that an explosion at a bakery is animating all manner of bread. During Catholic Mass in an emergency shelter, the worshippers are attacked by Communion wafers.

The group in the farmhouse fortify their defences, using toasters (instead of torches) to frighten off the bread, and barricading the doors and windows with sandwich bags (instead of wooden planks). Two women seek refuge in the basement, unaware that there is a lunch bag next to them. The bread inside kills them and one of the men, leaving only one person alive. Meanwhile, the two hamburger buns float away from the women they kill. At the end of the film, the sole survivor is smothered by the bread.
