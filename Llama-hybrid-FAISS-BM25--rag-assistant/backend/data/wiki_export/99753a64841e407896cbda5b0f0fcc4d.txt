The station was established by the Pennsylvania Railroad. In 1855, when the rail line was extended to Media through Wallingford, passing and freight sidings were built at the location. The present station was built in 1890 (although some sources claim it was built in 1880). While the identity of the station's architect has not been proven, some secondary sources claim it was designed by architect Frank Furness. For a time, this station also served as Wallingford's post office.
