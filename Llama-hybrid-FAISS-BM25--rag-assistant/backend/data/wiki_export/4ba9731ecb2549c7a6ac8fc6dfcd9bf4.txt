Wolfgang Ambros (born 19 March 1952 in Vienna, Austria)  is an Austrian singer-songwriter. He is one of the most important contemporary Austrian musicians and is considered to be one of the founders of Austropop.

Life

1952–1970 
Wolfgang Ambros was born in the Semmelweis Women's Clinic in Vienna and spent his early years in Wolfsgraben, Lower Austria. His father was head of the primary school there, his mother worked as a teacher. Later the family moved to Preßbaum. Ambros attended the Bundeskonvikt in Vienna's 2nd district and the Astgasse Grammar School in Vienna's 14th district. He later trained as a screen printer at the Graphische Lehr- und Versuchsanstalt (training discontinued). He first worked as a typewriter mechanic, display arranger and as a records salesman in Vienna and for a year in London.

Music
His most famous songs are "Schifoan", "Es lebe der Zentralfriedhof" and "Zwickt's mi". "Schifoan" is effectively an anthem for the Austrian ski tourism and industry. Many Austrian skiers—but also many others—know the lyrics of this song.

Ambros also released 3 cover albums (including songs by Bob Dylan, Tom Waits and Hans Moser. His latest album Steh grod (2006) is very successful.

Cooperations
Since 1978 Ambros has cooperated with the duo Tauchen/Prokopetz, who were very successful with DÖF in the 1980s. Also since 1978 Ambros has sung at live concerts with his band No. 1 vom Wienerwald.

In the 1980s Ambros sang together with André Heller. One of his biggest concerts took place at the Wiener Weststadion. Another one on the Kitzsteinhorn was the highest place a rock concert ever took place.

There were also cooperative efforts with the Viennese blues-musicians Harry Stampfer, Hans Thessink, Günter Dzikowski and DJ Kidpariz.

In 1997 he founded with Rainhard Fendrich and Georg Danzer the public charity "Initiative für Obdachlose" and the project Austria 3. On 10 December 1997 they were playing a unique concert, singing as group their own (solo) songs. The concert was done to collect money for homeless people and their public charity. Because of the success of this concert they continued this project and made many concerts in Austria and Germany and released three live-CDs from 1998 to 2000 (and some greatest hits-CDs).

In 2005 he released the Album Der alte Sünder – Ambros singt Moser, which was a cover album recorded with Christian Kolonovits.

In 2002 he won the AMADEUS Austrian Music Award.
