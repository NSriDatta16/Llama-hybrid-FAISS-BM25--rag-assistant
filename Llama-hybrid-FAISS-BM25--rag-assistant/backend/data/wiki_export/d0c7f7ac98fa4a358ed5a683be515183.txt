History
Altay was founded in 1914 in İzmir as İstiklal. The initial aim of the club was to unite Turkish youth under sporting activities and to encourage them, because in the 1910s minorities dominated sporting activities in İzmir. Under Ottoman rule, Turkish footballers were unable to compete. Altay was supported by many prominent Turkish politicians of the era. Former Turkish President Celal Bayar worked very hard in founding the club and gave his full support.

Altay has an important place in Turkey's football history. The club had a key role in uniting the Turkish community during the Turkish War of Independence. Many players and supporters of Altay SK lost their lives in the Turkish War. After the Surname Law was adopted, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk gave General Fahreddin Pasha the surname of "Altay". Altay play in İzmir Alsancak Stadium first built in 1929 and recently renovated in 2021.
