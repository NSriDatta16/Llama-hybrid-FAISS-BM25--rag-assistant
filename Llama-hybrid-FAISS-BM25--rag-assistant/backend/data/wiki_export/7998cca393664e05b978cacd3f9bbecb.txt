The 30th Infantry Brigade was an infantry brigade of the British Army in the First and Second World Wars.

History

First World War
The Brigade was originally raised as part of the 10th (Irish) Division and served with that formation throughout the First World War.

Second World War
The brigade was reformed on 24 April 1940 in the United Kingdom, as the 30th Infantry Brigade, commanded by Brigadier Claude Nicholson. It contained two regular army motor infantry battalions and a Territorial motorcycle reconnaissance battalion. It was intended to be part of the 1st Armoured Division, then forming in Normandy, but on 22 May it was hastily sent to Calais in France to defend the port against a German panzer division. After a siege there, lasting three days, the brigade was overrun late on 26 May.

The brigade was reformed again on 17 October 1940 as the 30th Independent Brigade Group (Guards), and later converted to the 6th Guards Tank Brigade.
