Government 
Breadalbane was incorporated as a municipality in 1991. Its name comes from an area in Scotland of the same name. The name "Breadalbane" means "The Upland of Alban". The Gaelic "Braghaid", meaning upper part, is found in Scottish place-names in the form of braid. "Alban" is the Gaelic name applied to the Northern Land. The Scots from Ireland, who brought Christianity to the West of Scotland in the early centuries, called the mountain range which separated them from Pictiand, "Druim-alban", or the backbone of Alban, and the region beyond it "Braighaid Alban".

The town was important as a local centre in the late 19th century. Several mills operated there, with the dam dismantled early in the 21st century.

Breadalbane has a community centre and a library and was the first station east of Emerald Junction on the Prince Edward Island Railway before the railroad was dismantled.
