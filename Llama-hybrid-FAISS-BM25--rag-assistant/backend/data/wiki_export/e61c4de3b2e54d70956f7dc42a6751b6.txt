History

The area was formerly populated by rural estates, one of which was named Auchenflower by Thomas McIlwraith circa 1880. The name Auchenflower is a Gaelic word meaning field of flowers.

Between 1900 and 1962 Auchenflower was served by trams running along Milton Road from Toowong.  The services were withdrawn after the disastrous Paddington tram depot fire.

In June 1887, the Torwood Estate was available for sale on the ground by R. J. Cottell, Auctioneer. The location was advertised as "Torwood adjoins Baroona, is close to Rosalie, to Bayswater, to Milton to Castlemaine Brewery, and is within 10 minutes drive of the city on a tip-top road."

In May 1920, "Drysllwyn Estate" made up of 37 allotments was advertised to be auctioned by Cameron Bros, auctioneers. A map advertising the auction states that the Estate is opposite the residence "Drysllwyn" and near Auchenflower Railway Station.

In September 1921, "Chermside Park, second section" made up of 50 allotments was advertised to be auctioned by Cameron Bros, auctioneers. A map advertising the auction states that the estate is convenient to the Toowong tram line.

Auchenflower Infants' Provisional School opened on 30 January 1922. It closed in 1960.

St Alban the Martyr Anglican Church was dedicated by Archbishop Gerald Sharp on 18 November 1923. In 1954 the foundation stone for a new church building was laid by Archbishop Philip Strong. The church's deconsecration and closure in 2015 was approved by Local Bishop Godfrey Fryar. The site is being redeveloped for residential apartments.

In 1975, the first NightOwl convenience store was opened at 392 Milton Road ().

From 1975 to 1986, Auchenflower was officially a neighbourhood with the suburb of Toowong, but obtained independent suburb status on 16 November 1986.

In January 2011, Auchenflower experienced flooding as part of the 2010â€“11 Queensland floods.
