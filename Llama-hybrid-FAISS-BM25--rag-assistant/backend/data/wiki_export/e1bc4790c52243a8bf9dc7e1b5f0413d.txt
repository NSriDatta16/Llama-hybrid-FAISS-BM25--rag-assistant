Sassen–Bünsow Land National Park () lies on Spitsbergen island in the Svalbard archipelago, Norway. The park was opened in 2003 and includes both glaciers and several glacially carved valleys.  The sealer/whaler Hilmar Nøis built the hunting station Fredheim on the north side of the Sassen river outlet in this area.  One of Spitsbergen's highest waterfalls lies in Eskerdalen (Esker Valley) inside the park.
