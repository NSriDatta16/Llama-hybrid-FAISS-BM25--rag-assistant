It was released by Malicious Records on 3 June 1996 on vinyl (limited to 500 copies) and CD. It was re-released several times: by Century Black in 1999, as a remastered version by Season of Mist in 2005, on vinyl in 2005 on Agonia Records (limited to 1000 copies), and on vinyl in 2006 on Back on Black Records.
