Synopsis 
Salakhain is an Urdu feature film set in the backdrop of Gawalmandi, Lahore. It is the story of a young man who is passionate about life and dreams of a bright and prosperous future. Little does he know what life has in store for him? He is destined for a future engulfed with hatred, anger and revenge.

Introducing Ahmed Butt, Pakistan's most-sought-after male model and winner of LUX Style Awards for 2003 for Best Model, in the lead role, Salakhain is devoid of compassion and sympathy, but full of action.

Film's Plot

Salakhain tells the story of an innocent, hardworking student called Faizan (Ahmed Butt) who comes from a lower-middle-class family and who is in love with an equally innocent and earnest looking young girl. Faizan is 'the good son' and wants to live up to his father's dream which is to run a business and improve the lifestyle of their family. Unfortunately the dreams are shattered while he was taking his exams as he is implicated  in a crime- a dispute with the 'booti mafia' (people facilitating cheating during exams), this results in his father's death and mother's mental health suffers due to shock of the tragic events, one following the other in quick succession.

In jail, he meets a man called Zaigham (Saud) and becomes friends with him who knows his enemies well and has his own issues to settle with them. Zaigham gets Faizan out of jail. Faizan now wants revenge for his parents. The rest is as predictable as any action movie made anywhere in the world - a journey towards retribution, passing through the maze called politics and crime.

Zara Sheikh, the girl Faizan loves, marries (Sami Khan) a police officer who is looking for Faizan since he is a criminal and Zara hides his picture when she sees it in Sami's wanted list so he won't know what he looks like. Meera and Faizan team up to kill Sajid Hassan who is the gang leader. Meera wants to kill him because he killed her sister by throwing acid on her face. Faizan finds his mother and, at the end, in a shootout Faizan finds out that Zara is married and Meera and Faizan are killed in a shootout.
