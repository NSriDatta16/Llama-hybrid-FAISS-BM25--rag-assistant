The following is a list of script editors on the long-running British science fiction television programme Doctor Who.   This list makes no distinction between the titles "story editor" and "script editor", as both titles were used for the same position while the production was based in London.

During the original series, the script editor worked in conjunction with the series producer in developing the creative direction of the series and they held the power to commission scripts, effectively becoming second in command to the producer. However, once Doctor Who moved to BBC Wales, the title came to describe a significantly different position.  Beginning with the 2005 series, the role of the Doctor Who script editor diminished significantly, in deference to the rise of the new position of  "Head Writer".  In many respects, Russell T Davies and his successor Steven Moffat have proven the closest analogue to the old position, but as they are also executive producers, they have had a much greater range of responsibilities than script editors of the original series. Script editors of the new series do not have the power to commission scripts.  Instead, they act as liaisons between the production staff and the screenwriter, before passing their joint work to the Head Writer for a "final polish".   Moreover, script editors in the BBC Wales version are assigned not to whole seasons, but to individual episodes — or at most "blocks" of 2-4 episodes produced concurrently.   Acknowledging that the Head Writer is much closer to being the script editor of the past, Helen Raynor has said that the modern Doctor Who script editor's job isn't a creative one, but "in the next seat to creativity ... a nuts and bolts job [in which] you do participate, you are a part of it, but you aren't driving it."
