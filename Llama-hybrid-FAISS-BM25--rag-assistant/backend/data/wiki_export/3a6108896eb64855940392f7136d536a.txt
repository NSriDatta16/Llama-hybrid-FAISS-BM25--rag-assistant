Kosovars are the citizens of Kosovo. Kosovars are predominantly Muslims and Albanians.

Kosovar citizenship is acquired by birth, adoption, naturalisation, international treaties or through some other specific forms.

History
Although Kosovo is young and declared its independence only in 2008, the ancestors of today's Kosovans have been living in Kosovoâ€™s region for millennia. One of the first people to live in Kosovo were Illyrians. Albanian Kosovans claim to be the direct descendants of the Illyrians, but Kosovan Serbs dispute this claim. The Illyrians were conquered by the Romans in the 2nd century BCE. Kosovo was under the control of the Bulgarian Empire and had become Slavicized and Christianized. Serbians, Bulgarians, and Byzantines fought over the region for several centuries, but the Serbians emerged victorious.

Ethnic groups

Kosovo has a population of around two million. Ethnic Albanians form the majority in Kosovo with 92.9%. Most Kosovar Albanians are Muslims and speak Albanian.
