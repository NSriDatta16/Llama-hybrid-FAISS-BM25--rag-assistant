Þórarinn loftunga was an Icelandic skald active during the first half of the 11th century.

He composed Tögdrápa, a poem in praise of King Canute. Like Sigvatr Þórðarson's poem in praise of the same king, Knútsdrápa, the Tøgdrápa is composed in the metrical form töglag, a variant of dróttkvætt which may have been invented at King Canute's court. According to Skáldatal, Þórarinn was also a court poet to Sveinn Knútsson, son of Knút, and his mother Ælfgifu of Northampton. In Sveinn's honour, he wrote Glælognskviða, which is also the oldest extant testimony to the sainthood of King Olaf II of Norway.
