The selector technique is a method to amplify and multiplex genomic DNA.

Process 
Genomic DNA is digested with restriction enzymes, circularized by hybridisation to selectors and subsequently attached to a vector sequence by ligation. The procedure results in circular DNA molecules with an included general primer pair motif that can be used for amplification by PCR or RCA.

Selector construct

A selector consists of two oligonucleotides, one Vector oligonucleotide and one Selector probe. Together they form one Selector with target specific ends on each side of a general primer motif.

Selection mechanisms

 A selector probe hybridizes with both ends of the selected target.
 A selector probe hybridizes with one end to the 3â€™ end of the target and the other end to an internal sequence of the target. The protruding 5' end is cleaved off using Taq polymerase.
