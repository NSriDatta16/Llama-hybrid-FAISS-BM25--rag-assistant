The restaurant in Oranjestad, Aruba became a location of interest in the investigation of the disappearance of Natalee Holloway in 2005. Holloway was last seen leaving the establishment by her friends. Three years after Holloway's disappearance, the restaurant was closed and a nearby location in Palm Beach was opened under the sister brand of Señor Frog's.
