Export
In the early 2000s, the Reliant motor company of the United Kingdom began to concentrate on importing "speciality" vehicles rather than its traditional business designing and manufacturing a range of small (often four-wheeler) cars. As well as a number of "light vehicles" made by Piaggio and Ligier, the firm had plans to import the Storm and its cabriolet sister car. However, even though the company had start dates for the importation of these cars, the plan never came to fruition.

The convertible version of the Storm has been imported into the UK and sold by Dream Machines, a company based in Heathfield, East Sussex.

This subcompact car was available with different comfort and safety features like power window, power steering, child safety locks, front fog lights, rear defogger, leather seats, etc. This car comes with the luxury of air-conditioner.
