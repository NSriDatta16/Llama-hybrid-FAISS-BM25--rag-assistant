History
It was founded as the Alberta Vocational Centre in 1965. Since 1972, it has been located on 3rd Street and 6th Avenue Southeast in Calgary and continues to expand its footprint between downtown Calgary and the city's East Village.

In 1998, the college transitioned from a government-administered model to an autonomous, board-governed public college and adopted the name Bow Valley College to reflect the region (the Bow Valley) which the college serves.

In May 2013, the college unveiled its new South Campus building on 6th Avenue Southeast. The South Campus building hosts the Calgary operations of Athabasca University, Olds College Fashion Institute, and the University of Lethbridge.

Beyond downtown Calgary, the college operates smaller campuses in the communities of Airdrie, Banff, Cochrane, Okotoks, and Strathmore, and offers academic and career education on a number of the region's Indigenous nations.
