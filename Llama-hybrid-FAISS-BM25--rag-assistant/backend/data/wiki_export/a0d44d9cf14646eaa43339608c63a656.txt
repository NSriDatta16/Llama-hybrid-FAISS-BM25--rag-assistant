Jones disagrees with child-care experts like Dr. Spock, who advocate for letting a baby cry so they learn not to, saying "Letting him scream is not humane, and it hurts his spirit." Linda Ziedrich, a book editor for Jones says:

Reviewer, Michelle Ondeck, RN, IBCLC, LCC, FACCE, recommended Jones' Great Expectations series, saying it was well researched; noting that Sandy and her daughter, Marcie, "compiled an extensive resource of over 1,000 topics for pregnancy and childbirth. Her assessment was included in The Journal of Perinatal Education, "Helpful Resources for Childbirth Educators and Parents."
