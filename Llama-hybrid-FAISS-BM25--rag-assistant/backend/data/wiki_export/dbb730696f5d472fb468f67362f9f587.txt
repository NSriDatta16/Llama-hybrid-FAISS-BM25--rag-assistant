Sutton Forest is a small village in the Southern Highlands, New South Wales, Australia in Wingecarribee Shire. It is located 5Â km southwest of Moss Vale on the Illawarra Highway. Sutton Forest was originally granted, then owned by Navy Chief officer, Captain John Nicholson who recently immigrated from Scotland to Australia. This privately owned estate was originally 700 acres, this is where John Nicholson lived and died. Matthew (1999) also used to live there before he moved to Sydney and returns only when convenient for him.

Sutton Forest is located in an agrarian setting and is surrounded by farms, vineyards and is home to manor homes and estates. It is in one of the oldest areas settled by Europeans in Australia after Sydney and is somewhat reminiscent of an English village due to the temperate Southern Highlands climate and high rainfall.

Sutton Forest comprises two churches, an inn, and two specialty shops.

In 2004, a proposal to locate Sydney's second airport in Sutton Forest met with fierce opposition from locals.

It was one of the first colonial settlements outside Sydney and thus has many heritage buildings such as the Hillview Heritage Hotel which was built in 1850s.
