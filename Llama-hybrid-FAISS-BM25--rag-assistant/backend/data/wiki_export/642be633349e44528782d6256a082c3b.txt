Purpose 
To Provide Technical Training and Operational Flight Trainers in support of Air Combat Group Operations.

History 
On 1 July 2003 278 Squadron was born from a pressing need to standardise and achieve efficiencies in the training of Air Combat Group RAAF (ACG) personnel. ACG's mission – to deliver Australia's capability to Control the Air and to Conduct Precision Strike – is unachievable without highly trained aircrew and maintenance teams. With permanent staff members supporting ACG training around Australia in RAAF Base Williamtown and RAAF Base Amberley. 278SQN trained ACG maintainers.

Establishing highly trained personnel takes years of dedicated training commitment. 278SQN delivered this training through Technical Training Flights for maintainers. Technical Training Flights provided training support through numerous methods.

The squadron was disbanded on 17 December 2020, with its functions being assumed by the No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit Integrated Training Centre and 82WG Technical Training Flight.
