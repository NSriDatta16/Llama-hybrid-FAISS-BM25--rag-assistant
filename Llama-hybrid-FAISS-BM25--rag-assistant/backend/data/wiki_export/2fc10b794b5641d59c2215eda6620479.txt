Sight & Sound Theatres is an entertainment company that produces Bible stories live on stage. Based in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, Sight & Sound operates two theaters: one in Ronks, Pennsylvania (formerly known as the Millennium Theatre) and the second in Branson, Missouri.

History 
Glenn and Shirley Eshelman started Sight & Sound in the summer of 1976, with a 10-week multimedia show The Wonder of It All in an auditorium rented from Lancaster Bible College. Based on that success, they built the original Sight & Sound Auditorium (renamed to Living Waters Theatre) on Pennsylvania Route 896 in Ronks, Pennsylvania. In July 1976, the Sight & Sound Auditorium opened for the performance of A Land of Our Own. Live actors and actresses were eventually added to the productions, and Behold the Lamb debuted as the first full-length live stage production at the original Sight & Sound Auditorium in 1987. A larger facility, the Sight & Sound Entertainment Centre opened in March 1991.

However, after the success of their productions Noah and the premiere run of The Miracle of Christmas, the Entertainment Centre caught fire in January 1997, destroying the facility and most of the costumes and sets that were stored in the shops. The Living Waters Theatre was renovated to accommodate live stage productions until another large theater, originally called The Millennium Theater, was opened on September 1, 1998. The new theatre featured more than 2,000 seats, a  wraparound stage that can hold sets up to 40 feet high, and improved audio and visual effects.

Sight & Sound opened a second theater in Branson, Missouri, in 2008, a near identical twin facility to the newest facility in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.

On July 17, 2022, Sight & Sound announced that they will be expanding to filmmaking through a production company named Sight & Sound Films. Their first film, I Heard the Bells, released in theaters in December 2022. Sight & Sound TV, an associated streaming service was launched in 2020 and offers filmed versions of past productions for online viewing.
