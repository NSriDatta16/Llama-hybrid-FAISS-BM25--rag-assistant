WNCY-FM (100.3 FM, "Y100") is an American commercial country music formatted radio station licensed to Neenah-Menasha, Wisconsin, that serves the Green Bay and Appleton-Oshkosh areas. WNCY is owned and operated by Midwest Communications, which owns six other radio stations in Northeast Wisconsin. WNCY's studios are located at 1420 Bellevue Street in Bellevue, while its transmitter is located in a rural area east of the city of Kaukauna.

On July 18, 2006, Midwest Communications broke ground on their new, $4.725 million facility in Bellevue, and WNCY moved into the new broadcast center in January 2008. The facility is located on the WNFL tower site on Bellevue Street. WNCY and the six other Midwest Communications stations in Northeast Wisconsin are now located in the new facility.

WNCY, along with the other Midwest stations in Green Bay, simulcasts WIXX if a tornado warning is in effect within Northeast Wisconsin.
