Ipswich Girls' Grammar School (IGGS) is an independent, non-denominational, day and boarding school for girls, in Ipswich, Queensland, Australia.

The school is one of the eight original 'Queensland Grammar Schools'. These schools are independent, non-denominational, not-for-profit statutory bodies of the Queensland Government. They are not linked to, administered, or governed by any religious organisation or specific style of education.

Both boys and girls are taught until year 6 at Ipswich Junior Grammar School situated on the Girls' School campus. Years 7 and above are girls only. The boarding school starts at year 5.

The school is a member of the Queensland Girls' Secondary Schools Sports Association (QGSSSA).

Some of the Ipswich Girls' Grammar School Buildings are listed on the Queensland Heritage Register.

Campus 
The School's campus is located in central Ipswich, and features a mixture of historic buildings dating to its inception in 1892 and more modern facilities which have been added over the years. The buildings are spread around the campus, interspersed with many green areas and gardens. Facilities include the performing arts block, state-of-the-art graphics and art studios, gym, swimming pool and specialised language classrooms.

New buildings

Following a devastating fire that destroyed the science block in the Senior School on 27 August 2005, IGGS has embarked on a major building program. Two new buildings have been constructed, after several years of negotiations undertaken by the School’s Board of Trustees and Executive; these buildings cost over $20 million and were completed by the beginning of the 2009 school year.
