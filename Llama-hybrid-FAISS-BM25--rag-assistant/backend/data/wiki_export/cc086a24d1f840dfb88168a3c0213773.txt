A roundhead was a type of mace used during the English Civil War. It is described as having a head about , a staff  long inserted into the head, twelve iron spikes round about, with another spike in the end. In 1643 an article in Mercurius Civicus claimed the weapon was called a roundhead by the Cavaliers because they were to be used to beat the Roundheads into subjection.
