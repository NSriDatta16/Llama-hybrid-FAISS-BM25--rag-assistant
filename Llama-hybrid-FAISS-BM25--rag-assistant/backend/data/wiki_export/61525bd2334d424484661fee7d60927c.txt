Down Incognito was the second solo album by American rock artist Kip Winger. It was released by Domo Records in 1999.

The album was released under different names. Down Incognito is the American title, while it was called Made by Hand in Europe, and Another Way in Japan.

The album mostly consists of acoustic studio versions of songs from the three Winger albums and Kip Winger's first solo album. The exceptions are album opener "Another Way", which is a new song for this recording, and the two last songs, "Rainbow in the Rose" and "Blind Revolution Mad", which are acoustic live versions from a show in Paris. According to Kip, he came up with the acoustic arrangements for these songs during his tour of Borders bookstores, when he needed to learn to play the many Winger hits on an acoustic 12-string guitar.
