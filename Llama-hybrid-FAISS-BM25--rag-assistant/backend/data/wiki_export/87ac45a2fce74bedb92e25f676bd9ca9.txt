Garia  (Bengali:গড়িয়া) is a neighborhood in south Kolkata, West Bengal, India. It is bordered by the neighborhoods of Jadavpur in the north, Bansdroni/Tollygunge in the north-west, Santoshpur/Mukundapur in the north-east and Narendrapur/Rajpur Sonarpur in the south. It is on the banks of Adi Ganga.

The southern part of the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass runs through the heart of the neighborhood. The area contains a prominent traffic junction from which a variety of public transport is available, making it a prime travel connection spot in South Kolkata.

Etymology
Garia may have received its name from kandelia candel, a native mangrove tree species, which was called Guriya (Bengali: গুড়িয়া) in the Sundarbani dialect of Bengali. It is said that in ancient times the Sundarbans forest covered the area of present-day Garia and extended north all the way to Sealdah and that locals subsequently gave this area the name of Garia. However, Garia may have also gotten its name from the Muslim community originally from Gauda, Gauriyā, who lived nearby. It is said that this group is currently living in the northern part of Patuli; however, many scholars do not accept this theory.

Alternatively, the name Garia may have come from the large Gaudiya Vaishnava community living in the neighborhood. In the 15th century, the famous social reformer of Bengal, Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, traveled through Adi Ganga on his Nilachala Yatra and stopped near present-day Garia; Vaishnavas (Baishnabs) have lived in the area since, and perhaps took inspiration for the name from that of the saint. Baishnabghata and Kamdahari, nearby townships, are hypothesized to have the same source of etymological history.

History
Garia is one of the oldest settlements in the region. Adi Ganga (also known as Tolly's Nala), which connects Kolkata to the Bidyadhari River to the east, runs through the middle of the neighborhood. It was a generally peaceful residential neighborhood before the partition of India, which changed the social composition of the area.

Through the course of the partition process, refugees came and settled in the farmlands and country houses of the rich landowners of Kolkata in Garia, increasing the population of the area by several thousands.

Garia became a refugee settlement, along with Jadavpur and Tollygunge, in the southern fringes of the city. Slowly after the initial upheaval, development of the area resumed and it gradually became peaceful once again.

With the expansion of Kolkata to the east and the south during the 1990s, the area witnessed further change. Garia was the southern end of the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass. This road connected Garia to the north of the city and newly developing areas like Salt Lake and New Town, and also to the Dum Dum Airport and spurred the rapid commercialization of the area. Already home to two major bus terminals, Garia became the transport and commercial hub of the region.

Present day
Kanungo Park, established by Sri Manindra Lal Das (of The Directorate of Settlement Department of West Bengal), was the first planned settlement in Garia and was inspired by Milian Park in Washington D.C. It, along with most other new planned settlements, was located to the north of the junction of N.S.C. Bose Road and Raja Subodh Chandra Mullick Road (known today as Garia More Road).

The locality is now home to some of the most upmarket apartment complexes in the city and caters to people looking to get away from the congestion of Kolkata. Notable complexes include Hiland Park, Avani's Victoria Greens, Westwind, Orbit City, Sunny Seasons, Victoria Greens, Sugam Park, Sherwood Estate, and Bengal Ambuja's Upohar.

More apartment complexes, such as Sugam Sudhir, PS Srijan Ozone, and Modello Highs are also nearing completion. Garia's population also continues to increase. Additionally, more residential flats are being built, leading roads to be increasingly congested and bringing Garia in line with most other places in Kolkata.

One of Kolkata's red-light districts is situated in Garia.
