History

Meiji period
The modern office of the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal was formed in 1885 after the Meiji government established the Japanese cabinet; however, the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal was separate from the cabinet and acted as a direct, personal advisor to the Emperor.  He was also responsible for the administration of imperial documents such as rescripts and edicts. Petitions to the emperor and the court were also handled by the Lord Keeper's office, as well as the responses.

In 1907, the post was expanded to become the  with a chief secretary, three secretaries, and six assistants to handle the increased workload with the passing of the genrō.

Shōwa period
After the start of Emperor Hirohito's reign in 1925, the office and position of the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal became increasingly important, at the expense of the office of the Prime Minister. Political infighting within the Diet of Japan further boosted the power of the Lord Keeper. The holder of this position could strictly control who was allowed to have an audience with the emperor and the flow of information.

The position and the office of the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal were officially abolished on 24 November 1945.

Today, the seals are kept in the care of the Chamberlain of Japan.
