Doane University is a private university in Crete, Nebraska.  It has additional campuses in Lincoln and Omaha, as well as online programs.

History
Doane College was founded on July 11, 1872, by Thomas Doane, chief civil engineer for the Burlington and Missouri River Railroad. David Brainerd Perry was the first college president. He served until his death in 1912.

Doane College was renamed Doane University in May 2016.

In 2020 the director of the Perkins library came under fire for a "Parties of the Past" exhibit of historical photographs which included two photos of students wearing blackface in 1926. The photos and then the entire exhibit was taken down by administrators who placed the library director on leave to the objection of the faculty. Doane was then named one of the "Worst Colleges for Free Speech" by the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education. The university later reinstated the library director.

The university has had over 70 Fulbright Scholars since the program began in 1946.
