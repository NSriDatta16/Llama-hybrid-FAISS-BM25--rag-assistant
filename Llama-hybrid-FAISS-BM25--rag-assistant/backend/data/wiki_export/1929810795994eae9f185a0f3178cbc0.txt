Coruscant Nights is a trilogy of novels by Michael Reaves. The series is set in the Star Wars universe a year after Star Wars: Episode III â€“ Revenge of the Sith. Rather than follow closely after each these, the books follow the same group of characters. Characters from the Medstar Duology reappear here.

A stand-alone follow-up novel to the trilogy, The Last Jedi, was released in 2013, which was also written by Reaves, along with Maya Kaathryn Bohnhoff.
