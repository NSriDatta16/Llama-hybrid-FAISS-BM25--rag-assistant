The 24th World Cup season began in August 1989 in Australia (for men) and Argentina (for women), resumed in November 1989 in the United States and concluded in March 1990 in Sweden.  During this season, the Soviet Union's empire collapsed, leading to the reunification of East and West Germany, the dissolution of Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia, and many other changes in Eastern Europe, which would have a significant effect on future World Cup seasons.

The overall champions were Pirmin Zurbriggen of Switzerland (his fourth, tying the men's record held by Gustav Thöni) and Petra Kronberger of Austria (her first).  At the end of the season, Zurbriggen retired, as did former women's World Cup overall champions Tamara McKinney of the United States and Maria Walliser and Michela Figini of Switzerland.
