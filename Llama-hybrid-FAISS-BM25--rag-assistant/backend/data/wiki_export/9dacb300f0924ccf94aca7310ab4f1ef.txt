Bardwell Road is a residential road in Oxford, England. It is located in North Oxford off the Banbury Road, within the area of Oxford once owned by St John's College, Oxford. The road is known for its schools, especially the Dragon School.

History
The road is named after Bardwell in Suffolk, a "living" of St John's College from 1635. It was originally approximately on the line of Greenditch. the former name of St Margaret's Road, where historically those who had committed capital crimes were executed.

Houses on Bardwell Road were largely built during the 1890s. Architects included Harry Wilkinson Moore, Herbert Quinton, and Messrs Radclyffe & Watson. The road lies on Oxford Clay at a depth of three feet, as discussed in Oxoniensia.

Schools

Bardwell Road is the location of the Dragon School, a well-known preparatory school. The second headmaster, Charles Cotterill Lynam (known as the "Skipper"), took a building lease on land to the southeast of Bardwell Road in 1893. In 1894, Lynam's Oxford Preparatory School was established on this site. £4,000 was quickly raised through subscriptions from local parents for the erection of new school buildings. The school moved from its previous location at 17 Crick Road within a year. The choice of its new location proved to be a wise one and the school has prospered as the Dragon School on this site to the present day.

The Bardwell Road Centre, one of the two locations of St Clare's College, is to be found here as well.

Wychwood School for girls is located on the southern corner of Bardwell Road and Banbury Road, at the western end. On the north side of the road is the Preparatory School for Oxford High School, formerly the site of Greycotes School. Peter Snow notes the cars delivering and collecting school children in Bardwell Road, part of what he terms "Dragonland".
