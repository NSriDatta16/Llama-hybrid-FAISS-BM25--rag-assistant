Castrum Vallis was the name of an ancient settlement that existed on the site of today's Bale. The settlement was founded by Caius Palcrus, and the role of the settlement was primarily defensive. Thus, Bale defended the road that led to Pula, but also the salt pans that existed at the time. Vallum means moat, so it is assumed that the ancient Bales were protected by a moat.

Coins found from this period testify to the ancient Bales today, even the remains of Roman buildings that are discovered almost as in Pula - as soon as you start digging you will come across something.
