Thoralby is a village and civil parish in the Richmondshire district of North Yorkshire, England. It lies south of Aysgarth, is within a mile of both Newbiggin and West Burton and is in the Yorkshire Dales National Park. It is  south-west of the county town of Northallerton.

History

The village is mentioned in Domesday Book as Turoldesbi. After the Norman invasion the lands were awarded to Count Alan of Brittany, who granted the local manor to Bernwulf, who had held the manor before that. The manor was eventually acquired by the lords of Middleham, whose descent it then followed until the Middleham manor holdings were sold piecemeal by commissioners of the Crown in the mid-17th century. The manor of Thoralby was purchased by the Norton family. By the middle of the 18th century it had passed to the Purchas family.

On Thoralby Common the remains of lead mines and quarries are still visible, indicating the industrial past of the area. There has also been a mill here since at least 1298. There used to be both Wesleyan and Primitive Methodist chapels in the village. The Wesleyan Chapel was built in 1823 and rebuilt in 1890. The Primitive Methodist Chapel was erected in 1849. Both are now private properties.

Thoralby was described in the Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales in 1870–72 as:

 " A township in Aysgarth parish, N. R. Yorkshire; 4½ miles SE of Askrigg. It has a post-office under Bedale. Acres, 2,840. Real property, £2,542. Pop., 271. Houses, 63."

The toponymy of the village name is derived from combining the Old Norse words of Thoraldr, a person's name, and bi, farm, to give the meaning Thoraldr's farm.
