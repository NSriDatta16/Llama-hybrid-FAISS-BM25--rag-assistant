The Art Academy of Cincinnati is a private college of art and design in Cincinnati, Ohio. It was founded as the McMicken School of Design in 1869, and was a department of the University of Cincinnati, and later in 1887, became the Art Academy of Cincinnati, the museum school of the Cincinnati Art Museum. The college is accredited by the National Association of Schools of Art and Design. 

In 1998, the Art Academy of Cincinnati legally separated from the museum and became an independent college of art and design. Degrees granted are the Associate of Science in Graphic Design; the Bachelor of Fine Arts in Creative Writing, Design, Illustration, Painting and Drawing, Photography, Print Media, and Sculpture; and the Master of Arts in Art Education, which is taught during summer semesters.

The Art Academy moved into its current facility at 1212 Jackson St. in the Over-the-Rhine neighborhood in the fall of 2005. This move has been pivotal in the Over-the-Rhine revitalization and renovation as an arts district. The new facility provides 24-hour access for students with around the clock security. Students are guaranteed studio spaces in Junior and Senior years. The 12th and Jackson St. building also has an open air atrium, connecting two formerly separate buildings, enlarged classroom spaces, computer labs, a student commons area, lecture hall, and Learning Services Center. In 2008, the Art Academy facility received Leadership in Energy and Environment Design (LEED) Green Building certification by the United States Green Building Council (USGBC).

AAC housing is encouraged for out-of-town Art Academy freshmen at the Academy Housing Facility at the nearby corner of 13th and Jackson streets. 33 loft style apartments renovated in collaboration with Urban Sites came online in 2020. The suites for 110 students are available each with fully equipped kitchens and with communal laundry facilities. Resident Advisors are also available and live on the premises.
