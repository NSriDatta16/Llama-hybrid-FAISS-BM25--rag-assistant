Career

Early years
Doane was trained by Steve Oubre at the Coastal Wrestling Academy in Orange, Texas, Rudy Boy Gonzalez and Shawn Michaels at the Texas Wrestling Academy. He then began his professional career by debuting in the Coastal States Wrestling Alliance (CSWA) before moving to Ring of Honor as a member of The Carnage Crew with HC Loc, DeVito, and later Justin Credible. Together, they would wrestle a number of tag matches. He also wrestled in six-man mayhem matches and proved that despite his size, he could still move quickly and keep up with the smaller competitors. At At Our Best, Masada and the rest of The Carnage Crew (accompanied by Dusty Rhodes) won the second ever Scramble Cage in the main event against Special K, who The Carnage Crew had been feuding with. However, The Carnage Crew's celebration with Rhodes was cut short in the locker room as it was discovered that somebody had defecated in the bags of Loc and DeVito.

Two months later, at Generation Next, it was revealed that Masada and his new partner Danny Daniels were responsible for the transgressions. That night, he and Daniels formed a team called The New and Improved Carnage Crew and defeated the original Carnage Crew. This new team left Loc and DeVito wondering why Masada turned on them, and also wondering what Daniels has against them. The Carnage Crew wanted revenge, but DeVito was injured and told Loc to wait for him to return until taking out his anger. During this time, Masada and Daniels looked impressive as a team, however, when DeVito returned the two teams would meet. At Reborn: Completion, The Carnage Crew defeated The New and Improved Carnage Crew for the rights to use the Carnage Crew name in what turned out to be Masada's last match in ROH.

Along with ROH, Masada wrestled for many other companies. He wrestled alongside Jared Steele and Delirious against 3 Live Kru in a dark match for TNA as well against Maven on WWE Heat. Masada also wrestled for IWA Mid-South, Full Impact Pro, and NWA Wildside, where he won the Tag Team championship with Todd Sexton. Masada wrestled in BJW also, feuding with Ryuji Ito.

On December 25, 2008, Masada had an extremely bloody deathmatch involving razor blades against Jun Kasai in Apache Pro-Wrestling.

He wrestled in the CZW Tournament of Death: Rewind losing to Thumbtack Jack in the finals.
