Landscape

To the west, north and east of the village of Visbek, lies the long, narrow strip of the nature reserve of Streams of the Endel and Holzhausen Heath, with the geest brooks and wet lowlands of the Aue, Twillbäke and Visbeker Bruchbach streams with their associated watermills.

Middle Ages 

Historical tradition dates back as far as to the late 8th century, when upon order of the Frankish king Charlemagne (later Emperor Charles the Great), the abbey of Visbek - then called "cellula fiscbechi", under Abbot Gerbert Castus - played a major role in the Christianization of the newly conquered surrounding Saxon territories of Lerigau, Hasegau and Venkigau.

In 855 AD, King Louis the German allocated the Benedictine Abbey of Visbek in the shire of Lerigau, with its territories and possessions, to the Imperial Abbey of Corvey.

Megalithic tombs 

The Visbek region, however, had been populated even before the Middle Ages, in fact as far back as the Neolithic Period, as evinced by numerous megalithic tombs of the Funnelbeaker culture (3,500 - 2,800 BC) that may still be seen today. Examples - aside from the Heidenopfertisch illustrated below - include the large stone graves of Mühlensteine, Schmeersteine, Visbeker Braut and Visbeker Bräutigam.
