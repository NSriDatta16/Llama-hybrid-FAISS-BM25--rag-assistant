A huckabuck, also known as a “cool cup” (referring to the paper or plastic cup commonly used to make it) is a homemade frozen dessert enjoyed by people in southern states particularly in Louisiana and in Georgia. It consists of a paper cup that is filled with some sort of sweet liquid like Kool-Aid, and frozen. Children buy them on their way home from school from the candy lady for a dime, or sometimes a quarter; other things are generally sold with them: chips and candy. The trick to eating it is to flip the huckabuck over so the soft sugary part is at the top. Then grab a spoon and dig in. They are still served to this day at the New Orleans Jazz Festival, in many neighborhoods around central and southern Louisiana.
