Carl Wilson is the debut solo album of The Beach Boys' band member, Carl Wilson. The youngest of the three Wilson brothers in the band, Carl Wilson was reportedly at this time unhappy with the progress being made by The Beach Boys creatively. So Carl, just as his brother Dennis had a few years earlier, signed a solo contract with James William Guercio's CBS-distributed Caribou Records, which four years prior put out brother Dennis's album Pacific Ocean Blue, and was also the current label of The Beach Boys. The album was released on March 27, 1981 and peaked at number 185 on the Billboard 200. Of the eight tracks on the album, seven of them are written by Carl Wilson and Myrna Smith, who was the wife of Carl's then manager Jerry Schilling, with the remaining track being co-written by Carl, Myrna and Michael Sun.
