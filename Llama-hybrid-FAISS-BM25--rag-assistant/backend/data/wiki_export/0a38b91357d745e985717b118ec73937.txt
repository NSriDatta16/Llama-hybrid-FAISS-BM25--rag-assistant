Joan Rice (3 February 1930 – 1 January 1997) was an English film actress.

Rice is best known for her role as Dalabo in the film His Majesty O'Keefe (1954) which co-starred Burt Lancaster. Apart from that she played Maid Marian in The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men (1952), played the graverobber's wife in The Horror of Frankenstein and appeared in Operation Bullshine. For several years in the early and mid-1950s, Rice was considered one of 'Rank's top stars'. She was loaned to Adelphi Films to make The Crowded Day.

She was reputedly discovered working as a waitress in a Lyons Corner House in London, where she was crowned "Miss Lyons, 1949"; and thereafter trained at the Rank Organisation's "charm school".

Her interment was at Braywick Cemetery in Maidenhead.
