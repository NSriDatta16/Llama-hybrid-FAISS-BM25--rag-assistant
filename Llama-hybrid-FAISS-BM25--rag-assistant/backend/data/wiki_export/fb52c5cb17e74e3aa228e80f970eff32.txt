Croydon station is a SEPTA Regional Rail station in Croydon, Pennsylvania. Located at Bristol Pike and Cedar Avenue, it serves the Trenton Line.

The station is located along the Northeast Corridor, owned by Amtrak. It is  from 30th Street Station. Amtrak does not stop at this station.

In 2004, it saw 293 boardings on an average weekday. It was scheduled for renovation in Spring 2009, including an expanded parking lot, covered windscreen shelters, new lighting and raised platforms. Talks of a "super station" were active in 2007–2008 but have not been revisited. Despite the failed proposal to convert Croydon into a super station, Croydon recently underwent a complete upgrade due to infrastructure funding under the recovery act. The two green shelters have been torn down, new raised accessible platforms have been added, new parking lots have been paved, new lighting has been erected, and a new underpass walkway has been added. The station was completed in the fall of 2011, and the ribbon-cutting ceremony was held on October 28, 2011.
