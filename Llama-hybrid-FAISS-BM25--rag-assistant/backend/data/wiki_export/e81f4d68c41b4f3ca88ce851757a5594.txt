Most of the Norwegian counties and municipalities have their own flag. They are based on the respective coat of arms of the subdivision. However they are seldom used. Most public buildings and private homes use the National flag. Note: As of 2020, many municipalities and counties have been merged. Because of this many of the new regions do not have a current flag and instead the coat of arms will be used for the new regions until a flag is made.

Although Finnmark and Troms are officially merged, they still use their old county flags as the merging is disputed by locals and officials in Finnmark. The region of Trøndelag uses the old flag of Nord-Trøndelag as it has historical value and connection to king Olav II of Norway.
