Education

Kilfinnane facilitates both Primary and Secondary Education.

Kilfinnane Primary School Scoil Fhíonáin is located very close to the Secondary School and has a new building opened in September 2012. Prior to this, the Primary School was located in an old former Catholic residence, which was notorious due to reports of infestation, cold conditions and outdoor toilets. In November 2012, disputes amongst building subcontractors and the main building contractor of the new School resulted in builders cutting the power and water, and removing the fittings of the newly opened school building. Parents created a blockade to prevent the builders from leaving the school grounds. The standoff became a national news story. An RTÉ Radio 1 radio documentary "Take No More" by Grey Heron Media on the standoff won Gold at the 2013 PPI Radio Awards, the 2013 Association for International Broadcasting, and the 2013 New York Radio Festival.

Scoil Pól Kilfinnane was founded in 1915 and made its current home in 1987. The school, a Catholic school, offers a range of educational and extra-curricular activities. Some of its activities include sports, cairdeas, transition year activities, green flag and chess.
