Thomas Olive was a deputy-governor of West Jersey from 1684â€“1685.

The original name of Wellingborough for present-day Willingboro Township, New Jersey was after the community in England which was the home of Olive. Olive was the one who led the original settlers into that township.

In 1676, along with the other proprietors of West Jersey, Olive signed the Concession and Agreement. Olive owned one share of West Jersey land as a proprietor.
