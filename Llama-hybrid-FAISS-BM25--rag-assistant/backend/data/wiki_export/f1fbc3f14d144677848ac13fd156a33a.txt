Horon () is a group of traditional folk dances from the Pontus or Eastern Black Sea Region in Turkey.

Name

Etymology
The term horon derives from Greek choros (), which means "dance." The earliest instance of its usage in a Turkic language is in Codex Cumanicus from 1303.

Variants
In Ordu and Giresun, the term horan is used instead of horon.

Origin 
Horon dances originated from the ancient koron-horon, a form of pagan worship. Over 50 variations of horon have been identified in a single region.

Dance 
The horon is typically performed by a group of men or women in a line or semicircle. This dance form involves fast shoulder shimmy (tremoulo), trembling of the entire body, and sudden squats. Horon dances require speed and agility in a dancer.
