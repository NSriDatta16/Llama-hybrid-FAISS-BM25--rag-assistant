Bolgatanga Municipal District is one of the fifteen districts in Upper East Region, Ghana. Originally created as an ordinary district assembly in 1988 when it was known as Bolgatanga District; which was established by Legislative Instrument (L.I.) 1438, until the southeast part of the district was split off by a decree of president John Agyekum Kufuor in August 2004 to create Talensi-Nabdam District; thus the remaining part was elevated to municipal district assembly status on the same year to become Bolgatanga Municipal District, which was established by Legislative Instrument (L.I.) 1797. However, on 15 March 2018, the eastern part of the district was later split off to create Bolgatanga East District, which was established by Legislative Instrument (L.I.) 2321; thus the remaining part has been retained as Bolgatanga Municipal District. The municipality is located in the central part of Upper East Region and has Bolgatanga as its capital town, which also serves as the capital of the Upper East Region.
