Hartlepool Borough Council elections usually take place for a third of the council, three years out of every four. Hartlepool Borough Council is the local authority for the unitary authority of Hartlepool in County Durham, England. Until 1 April 1996 it was a non-metropolitan district in Cleveland. Between 2002 and 2013 the council was led by a directly elected mayor.

Political control
An earlier municipal borough of Hartlepool existed from 1850 until 1967 covering the old town, whilst neighbouring West Hartlepool was a county borough (making it independent from Durham County Council) from 1902 to 1967. West Hartlepool and Hartlepool merged into a single county borough called Hartlepool in 1967. Under the Local Government Act 1972 a non-metropolitan district called Hartlepool was established, covering a larger area than the previous borough, and Hartlepool was transferred to the new county of Cleveland. The first election to the reconstituted Hartlepool Borough Council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority before coming into its powers on 1 April 1974. County-level services were provided by Cleveland County Council until its abolition in 1996, when Hartlepool became a unitary authority. Political control of the council since 1973 has been held by the following parties:
