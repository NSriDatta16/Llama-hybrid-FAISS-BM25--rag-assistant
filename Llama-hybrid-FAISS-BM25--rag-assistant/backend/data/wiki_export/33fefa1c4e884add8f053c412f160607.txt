Charts

Live performance
The song is frequently played live, most recently as a combination with Queen's "We Will Rock You" during the first chorus. It is the only song from See You on the Other Side that has remained a staple of their live set. It has also been performed several times on television, including Jimmy Kimmel Live! and Spike TV's Scream Awards.

Music video
The video was directed by Little X, his second time behind the lens for a rock band. The video begins with Korn performing in a desert in broad daylight. The sky begins to shatter like glass during the chorus to reveal a night sky. Later, the whole background shatters, leaving a plain white background. Lastly, they literally become undone while continuing to perform, and as they do, they resemble slinkies. The band is completely unraveled and gone by the ending of the video.

Appearances in media
Former Detroit Tigers third baseman Brandon Inge used the song as his walkup song when batting. It was also used as the walkup song for Hunter Pence when he played for the Philadelphia Phillies. It was also featured in a commercial for the CBS crime drama series Criminal Minds and in the video games Blitz: The League and The Bigs 2. An instrumental version is used for the TNA wrestler Frankie Kazarian, also known as Kaz. It also appeared in VH1's "100 Most Shocking Music Moments" in the discussion of the Woodstock 1999; both "Did My Time" and "Coming Undone" are heard in the background.
