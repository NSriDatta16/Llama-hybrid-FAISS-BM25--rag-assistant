Simon Michael Brainin (July 15, 1854 – March 31, 1911) was a Latvian-American physician.

Brainin graduated from the gymnasium in his native Riga; studied medicine at the universities of Dorpat and Berlin; held the position of physician of the Jewish community of Riga; and was one of the directors of the community, the last independent Jewish kahal in Russia, until this institution was abolished by the government. He was a member of the committee of the government to investigate the rights of the Jews of the city of Riga, 1885; delegate from the government of Poltava to the rabbinical conference at St. Petersburg, 1892; and a member of the Society for the Promotion of Culture Among the Jews of Russia. In 1895, he immigrated to New York City, where he became (1902) a practicing physician, and member of the county medical and German medical societies, of the Harlem Medical Association, and of the New York Historical Society. He died in New York City.
