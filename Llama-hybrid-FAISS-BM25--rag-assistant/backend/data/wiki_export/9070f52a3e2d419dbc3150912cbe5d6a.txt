Penn State Beaver is a commonwealth campus of Pennsylvania State University located in Center Township in Beaver County, Pennsylvania.

Campus history
The land where the campus now exists was once a farm owned by the Hartenbach family. The barn once stood on the present site of the Brodhead Cultural Center's amphitheater.  The main part of the campus’s grounds has served multiple purposes throughout the years. One of its main functions was as the Beaver County Tuberculosis Sanatorium, which opened on February 14, 1923.  The building, which later served as the Penn State Beaver administration building from 1965 until 2004 when the Ross Administration Building was opened, held 20 beds and its primary physicians were Drs Fred and Ruth Wilson.

As tuberculosis cases began to decline in the Beaver County area the sanatorium was closed in the early 1950s.   For a short time after this, the building was used as an annex for the Beaver County Geriatric Hospital before it was moved to its new location on Dutch Ridge Road in 1963.  It was also around this time that Hartenbach farm was sold to Pennsylvania State University with a contingent that Ralph Hartenbach and his wife could live in their house until their deaths.

The Beaver County Commissioners donated the old sanatorium and the land around it to Penn State.  In the fall of 1965, Penn State Beaver admitted 97 students for its first semester. Each student paid $525 for two semesters.

Academics
Penn State Beaver offers the first two years of almost all of Penn State's more than 160 baccalaureate majors. Students can also complete many bachelor's degrees at Beaver campus.
