Tanya is the Slavic  hypocoristic of Tatiana. It is commonly used as an independent given name in the English-speaking world. The name's popularity among English-speakers (and other non-Slavs) was originally due to the popularity of Alexander Pushkin's verse novel Eugene Onegin, whose heroine is named Tatiana "Tanya" Larina.

Variants include Tania (Ukrainian, Romanian); Tanja (Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian, Norwegian, German, Danish, Estonian, Finnish, Dutch, Slovene and Macedonian); Táňa (Czech); Tânia; (Portuguese); and Taanya (Levant and Indian subcontinent).

As of 2010 it was the 237th most common name in the United States, according to namestatistics.com, which uses US Census data.
