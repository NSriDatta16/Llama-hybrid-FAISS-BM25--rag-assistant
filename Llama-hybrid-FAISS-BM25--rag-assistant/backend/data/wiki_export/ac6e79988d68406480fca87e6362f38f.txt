In an interview with ECM, Sebastian described the album as "“short diary (of loss)” and “a sonic memory, created with love, out of need for comfort.”

In 2006, Rochford collaborated with Gwyneth Herbert in a production role for her album Between Me and the Wardrobe. He played drums on Adele's Mercury-nominated album 19. He has drummed for Pete Doherty's band Babyshambles, performing on their eponymous debut single, and has continued to make guest appearances with them.
