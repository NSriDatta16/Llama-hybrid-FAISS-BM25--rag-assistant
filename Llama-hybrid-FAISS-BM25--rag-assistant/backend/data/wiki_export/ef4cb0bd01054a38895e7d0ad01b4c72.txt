Jason "Ratboy" Collins (born July 4, 1974, in Santa Cruz, CA) is an aerial surfer who graduated from Santa Cruz High School.  Following the lead of surfers such as Christian Fletcher, Collins dominated aerial surfing in the mid-nineties. Collins is also an accomplished longboarder and is well known for his overall riding style.

He landed a backside 360 air during the Expression Session at the O'Neill Cold Water Classic in 1994 when other competitors were doing top turns and roundhouse cutbacks. By landing that air, Collins defined his persona in the surfing world.  He is a staple at surf competition air shows, has been published on multiple magazine covers and has a line of signature surfboards with the Stretch label.
