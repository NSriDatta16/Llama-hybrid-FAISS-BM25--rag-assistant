Stationmasters
In 1868, Thomas Grundy, station master, was brought before Mr Justice Hannen at Lincolnshire Assizes, charged with manslaughter of John Alsobrook and Thomas Moore at Swinderby on 11 November 1867. It was alleged that the station master had not taken proper precautions with the signalling and fog warning lights on a foggy evening and this neglect of his proper duty resulted in a collision between a fish train and a government train. The driver and fireman of the fish train were killed. The prosecution were unable to prove their case and Thomas Grundy was acquitted.
