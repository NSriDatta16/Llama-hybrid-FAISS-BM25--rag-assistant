Gadget's Go Coaster (known as Chip 'n' Dale's GADGETcoaster in Disneyland) is a junior roller coaster at the Disneyland theme park in Anaheim, California, and Tokyo Disneyland theme park, located in Urayasu, Chiba, Japan, near Tokyo. It is based on the work of the character Gadget Hackwrench from the Disney animated series Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers (1989–1990). Gadget is depicted on top of a small weather-vane on the roof of the loading station, as well as on a postage stamp in the attraction's loading area. The Disneyland version also includes a static figure of Gadget before the coaster's lift hill.

Both versions of the attraction are located in Mickey's Toontown, and the Disneyland version opened January 24, 1993, along with the rest of Mickey's Toontown. The Tokyo Disneyland version opened on April 15, 1996. At 0:44 seconds, it is the shortest attraction in Disneyland. The Disneyland version closed in March 2022 for a refurbishment and reopened in March 2023 with its current name as well as some new features.

Ride

Disneyland Version
The ride is primarily for children and therefore has small cars. While two children can fit into a single car, most adults would have to travel alone (or with a small child).

Before traveling up a lift hill, riders pass by a figure of Gadget (voiced by Tress MacNeille) as she says various comments. After the lift hill, riders then travel down and around Toon Lake. Near the end of the ride (the fastest turn), riders pass in-between a figure of Chip blowing through a straw with Zipper, and a figure of Dale holding a cup as Chip attempts to shoot water above riders' heads into the cup. The coaster comes to a stop and pulls into the station.

The attraction was closed for a refurbishment in March 2022 and reopened in March 2023 with its current name and also received new character figures Chip, Dale, Gadget and Zipper from the television series.

Tokyo Disneyland Version
The Go Coaster is primarily for children and therefore has small cars. While two children can fit into a single car, most adults would have to travel alone (or with a small child). Guests board a train fashioned from acorns and scavenged parts.
