Name
According to Paul Whalley, the name Jājmaū may be related to Sanskrit yajña, meaning "sacrifice", which became Old Hindi jaj. It could have gotten this name because the site was originally given to a priest who performed a sacrifice. The ending -maū could come from Sanskrit maryādā, meaning "shore" or "bank", or it could be a contraction of the name of the mahuā tree.

History
It is home to most of the biggest leather industries in India generating 15000cr of revenues every year and accounting for 30% of Indian Export. While coming from Lucknow from the new the Ganges bridge you can see the old "Jinnaton ki Masjid" on top of the hill. It resembles the Taj Mahal due to its architecture and white colour. Going down the side of the hill opposite to the river is a settlement for nearly half a million people mostly involved in leather industry.

Going farther down from the uphill there is the famous shrine of Makhdoom Shah Ala based on which the areas is named as Makhdoom Nagar. Feroze Shah Tughlaq built the tomb of this famous Sufi saint in 1358. A mosque built by Kulich Khan in 1679 also stands here.

Also in the shrine there are two ancient carved inscribed stone tablets grafted in wall which are in Arabic and inform that Sultan Feroze Shah Tughlaq had visited the mausoleum and had the shrine built i.e. Mazar of Qazi Alaulhaq Waddeen Yusuf in the year 761 Hijri, and Masjid (mosque) inside the Dargah campus in 762 Hijri. Every Thursday many people of various religions assemble in the Dargah Sharif to seek blessings to succeed. Issueless and those having no male issue receive the most benefit. The ASI (Archaeological Survey of India) had photographed/copied the stone inscriptions of Dargah Makhdoom Shah Ala of years 761 and 762 Hijri and also from Dargah Dadamiyan (Qazi Sirajul Haq Waddeen the father of Makhdoom Aala) a contemporary of Sultan Qutbuddeen Aibak (1192 AD to 1210 AD) of year 696 Hijri in the campus Eidgaah and published the same with their findings in their book Epigraphia Indica—Arabic & Persian Supplement 1964 with special reference to the Farman of Firoz Tuglaq with the Saint's direct descendants Qazi Haseen Ahmed Farooqi. Their descriptions are also found in many older books of History including Tareekhe Zila Kanpur (1876 AD), Kanpur Gazetteer 1909 and Kanpur ka Itihas Page 306 to 310. Mr. Qazi Haseen Ahmed is succeeded by his two sons Mr. Qazi Sabeeh Ahmed & Mr. Wajih Ahmed.

The archaeological site of Jajmau is a huge mound situated on the banks of Ganges river, known as the Jajmau ka tila. Copper hoard artefacts and Painted Grey Ware (PGW) sherds were found from the surface deposits of this mound. In 1956, at the time of the construction of the national highway and Jajamu bridge, remains of an ancient settlement were discovered here. Excavations were carried out by the Archaeological Survey of India and the Uttar Pradesh State Archaeology Department in 1956-58 and 1973-78. During the excavations carried out in 1977-78, an ivory seal with Vasalas inscribed in Brahmi was found. A historian, Girish Chandra Singh, claimed that Vasalas is an epithet of Chandragupta Maurya.

In 2006, during widening of the national highway, a salvage operation was started to document and study the archaeological remains embedded within a portion of the mound by a team of archaeologists led by Ram Vinay under the direction of Uttar Pradesh State Archaeological Directorate. During the excavation, the Black and Red Wares were discovered here below the PGW layer. Significant archaeological findings from this site during this excavation include a hoard of silver punch-marked coins in a NBPW vase with a lustrous polish, a baked terracotta dabber bearing Brahmi inscription of c. 3rd–2nd century BCE and structures made of mud and baked bricks of Mauryan and pre-Mauryan period. The symbols of sun, crescent, tree within a vedika and hill are found in these coins. The inscription on the terracotta dabber in Brahmi is in two lines. The first line has been deciphered as bha di ke (Bhadrike) and a single letter, ma in dots is inscribed below it. Radiocarbon dates found by the Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeobotany for the charcoal samples collected from this deposit during this excavation, cultural material and stratigraphy suggest that this part of the mound was settled from c. 1300 – 1200 BCE.
