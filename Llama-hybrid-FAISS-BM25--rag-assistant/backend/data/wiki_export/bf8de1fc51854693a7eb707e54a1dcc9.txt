Facilities

Tancheon Stadium 
Tancheon Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium built in 2002 and currently used mostly for football matches and has been the home stadium of Seongnam FC since 2005, replacing the club's previous home, the Seongnam Sports Complex.

The first professional football match ever held was a friendly game between Seongnam Ilhwa Chunma and Poland national football team on 26 May 2002.

In 2009, Seongnam FC moved their home matches to Seongnam Sports Complex as the canopy installation works commenced. The installation was completed in 2010. The first match held since the installation was Seongnam FC's 2010 AFC Champions League game against Kawasaki Frontale on 23 February 2010.

On 12 March 2016, the stadium recorded its first ever K League sold-out match in Seongnam FC's 2016 K League Classic first-round game against Suwon Samsung Bluewings.

In the first half of 2019, Seongnam installed the nation's best large electronic display panel at Tancheon Stadium. Fan would be able to enjoy more vivid game scenes and halftime events at the stadium. In order to improve players' performance, the grass was completely replaced, and track and field tracks was also replaced with blue ones. The team's color was applied to the stadium with street lamp banners and branding using Tongcheon.

The stadium is nicknamed the Tancheon Fortress (Hangul: 탄천요새) reflecting Seongnam FC's strong home record in AFC Champions League.
