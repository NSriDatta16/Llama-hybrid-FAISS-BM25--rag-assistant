Marc Phillip Thomas (1949–2017) was a professor of computer science and mathematics, retired chair and a system administrator of Computer Science department at CSU Bakersfield.

His successful research projects include the resolution of the commutative Singer–Wermer conjecture and construction of a non-standard closed ideal in a certain radical Banach algebra of power series and their quotients.
