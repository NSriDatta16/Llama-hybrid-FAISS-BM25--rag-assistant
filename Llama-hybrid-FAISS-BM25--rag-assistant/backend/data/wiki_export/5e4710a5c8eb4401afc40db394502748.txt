High school
Rudd attended and played high school basketball at Eastman High School, in Hollister, North Carolina.

College career

After high school, Rudd attended and played college basketball Wake Forest University, with the Wake Forest Demon Deacons, from 1981 to 1985.

Professional career
In his pro career, Rudd played in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA), and in the NBA with the Utah Jazz and the Portland Trail Blazers. He also played overseas, in Greece with PAOK, from 1986â€“1988, and in France, with ASVEL Lyon-Villeurbanne, from 1993 to 1999.

While playing for the Jazz, Rudd mostly served as a backup to future Hall of Famer John Stockton.  However, Rudd had a chance to shine in the 1992 Western Conference Finals against the Blazers.  In Game 5 of that series, which was tied at 2 games apiece, Stockton suffered an eye injury and thus was unable to continue playing.  Rudd stepped in as point guard for the Jazz, and with his team trailing 107-104 late in the fourth quarter, swished a 23-foot 3-pointer to silence the Portland crowd and send the game into overtime.
