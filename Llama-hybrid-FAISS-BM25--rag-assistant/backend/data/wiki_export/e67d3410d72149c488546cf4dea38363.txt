Stiletto is the fourth solo studio album by the American musician Lita Ford. It includes the singles "Hungry" and "Lisa". The album peaked at No. 52 on the Billboard 200. Ford supported the album by touring with Mötley Crüe.

Production
The album was produced by Mike Chapman. "Lisa" is about Ford's mother. "Only Women Bleed" is a cover of the Alice Cooper song. Ford employed synthesized strings and horns on the album.

Critical reception

The Los Angeles Times wrote that "Ford rides her sex-bomb goddess image, serviceable vocals and one o' the lads guitarwork hard 'n' heavy for almost one full side of this LP." The Calgary Herald determined that "Stiletto abandons wallowing in past sub-par metal yearnings and instead tries a more mainstream approach."

The Vancouver Sun opined that Ford "just doesn't have the heavy metal vocal screech or the powerthud music to make her songs more than mildly amusing." The Orlando Sentinel panned the "stupid lyrics and ... bombastic guitar solos."
