Rani Jhansi Marine National Park is located in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal. It was founded in 1996, and covers 256 km2. It commemorates Lakshmibai, the Rani of Jhansi (1828-58). It is located in the Ritchie's Archipelago and is about 30 km from Port Blair. It contains coral reefs and mangrove forests. The biggest attraction in the park is a fruit-eating bat. It plays a major role in the ecosystem, because it pollinates plants and scatters seeds.
