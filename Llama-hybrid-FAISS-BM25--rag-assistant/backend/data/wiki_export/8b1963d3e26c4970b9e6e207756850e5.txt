The Trinity Universe (also called the Æon Continuum or the Æonverse) is the shared science fiction setting created by White Wolf Publishing. Its component game lines include:

 Adventure!, a pulp-action game set in 1924.
 Aberrant, a superpowers game set in the near-future (from 2008 to 2015).
 Trinity, a science fiction game where players take on the role of psions in the far future (from 2120 to 2122).

History
ÆON, later known as Trinity was a science-fiction game that was intended to be the first in a trilogy of games. Aberrant (1999) by Rob Hatch was a near-future superhero role-playing game already in development, which was changed to become part of the "Trinity Universe" setting. The Trinity line suffered from low sales so the third game, the pulp adventure role-playing game Adventure! (2001), was published as a standalone book. White Wolf's ArtHaus imprint was eventually placed in charge of the "Trinity" line, and they published Aberrant d20 (2004), Adventure d20 (2004) and Trinity d20 (2004) using the D20 System but they were produced in a weak market for d20 so no further Trinity books were published.
