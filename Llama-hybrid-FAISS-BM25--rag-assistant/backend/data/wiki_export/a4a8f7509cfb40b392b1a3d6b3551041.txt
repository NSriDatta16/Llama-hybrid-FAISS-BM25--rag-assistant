Career

Club

Bassedas is a product of Vélez Sársfield youth divisions, club where he debuted professionally on 3 March 1991. He played as a sweeper (libero), and was an important part of Vélez most successful years during the 1990s. He won four national championships with the club, and five international (including the 1994 Intercontinental Cup, where he was a starter in the 2–0 victory over A.C. Milan).

In 2000, he joined English FA Premier League club Newcastle United for £3,500,000. He played for them in the period 2000–2003, though on loan to Tenerife briefly during the 2001–02 season. He scored once in the league for Newcastle in a 3–1 defeat at Chelsea in January 2001.

In 2003, he joined Argentine Newell's Old Boys, but after two months of pre-season training he decided to retire from football at the age of 30.

He later worked for Fox Sports en Latinoamérica as a commentator on FA Premier League matches.

At the end of 2008, Bassedas was appointed as sports consultant of Vélez Sársfield of the Argentine Primera División. His first order of business was to recommend Ricardo Gareca to fill the coaching spot. He was also essential in the negotiations to bring Maximiliano Moralez, Sebastián Domínguez and Joaquín Larrivey to the club. In his first season with the club, Vélez won the Clausura 09.

In November 2015, he was appointed as manager of Vélez Sársfield. He resigned in September 2016, after a 0–3 loss against Racing Club, citing the violent reaction Vélez supporters as his reason for leaving.
