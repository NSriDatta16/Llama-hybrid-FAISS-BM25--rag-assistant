Hašek was born in Městec Králové. During his 21-year career, he represented AC Sparta Prague (two spells), RC Strasbourg, Sanfrecce Hiroshima and JEF United Ichihara. With the French club, he played two seasons apiece in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 and, in his last days as a player, spent at main side Sparta, teamed up with cousin Martin.

Hašek played for Czechoslovakia, gaining 55 caps and scored five goals. He was a participant in the 1990 FIFA World Cup, where the national side reached the quarterfinals, with him as team captain; in the group stage 5–1 routing of the United States, he scored the third. After the match, Hašek said:  "We are sorry for the score".
