Brohm completed 66 of 98 passes for 819 yards and six touchdowns. After entering the game for at least one series per game as a true freshman, Brohm followed in the footsteps of father, Oscar, and brother, Jeff, by becoming a starting quarterback at the University of Louisville in 2005. His brother, Greg, also played at Louisville as a receiver.

Brohm completed 24 of 34 passes for 311 yards, the third highest total in Orange Bowl history. He also ended the year as the 2nd Team All Big East Quarterback behind Pat White. The Sporting News projected Brohm as high as the top pick in the 2007 NFL draft, and many other experts had projected him as going no later than the first round, Brohm announced on January 15, 2007, after a long period of speculation, that he would return to the University of Louisville for his senior year.

College statistics

Professional career
The fact that the 2008 draft was infused with top-prospect quarterbacks whose playing styles are very similar to Brohm's was also a key argument for Brohm's possible entry in the 2007 draft, where the other first round-bound quarterbacks include the more diverse characters of Brady Quinn and JaMarcus Russell. However, Brohm eventually decided to return for his senior season for another shot at helping the Louisville Cardinals to a BCS National Championship. Instead, the team went 6–6.

Green Bay Packers
Brohm was drafted by the Green Bay Packers in the second round (56th overall) of the 2008 NFL Draft. On July 27, 2008, he signed a contract with the Packers.

He was waived on September 5, 2009. Just days later, Brohm was signed to the practice squad.

Buffalo Bills
Brohm was signed off the Packers practice squad by the Buffalo Bills on November 19, 2009, after the Bills waived Gibran Hamdan. He made his first NFL start on December 27, 2009, against the Atlanta Falcons. Buffalo lost the game 31–3. In the 2nd quarter of the same game, Brohm threw an 8-yard pass to wide receiver Terrell Owens, giving the wideout his 1,000th career reception.

Brohm competed with Ryan Fitzpatrick and Trent Edwards for the starting quarterback position prior to the 2010 season. Edwards, however, was named starter prior to the first preseason game, with Fitzpatrick and Brohm alternating as second-string through the preseason. By the start of the regular season, Brohm had been demoted back to third string; when Edwards was released, he was moved back up to second string when Fitzpatrick became the starter. Brohm was given the start in the final game of the season, a 38–7 loss to the New York Jets. Brohm, a restricted free agent, was not re-signed by the Bills in the 2011 offseason, with the Bills having signed Brad Smith and Tyler Thigpen as backups to Fitzpatrick.

Las Vegas Locomotives
Brohm signed with the Las Vegas Locomotives of the United Football League on August 29, 2011. Brohm, entering the game in relief of starter Chase Clement, saw his first action in a game against the Virginia Destroyers on September 24, 2011, completing 10-19 passes for 111 yds and 2 touchdowns in a 34–17 loss.

Following the 2011 season, Brohm had a workout for the Detroit Lions in November. In March 2012, he threw to Randy Moss in a highly publicized workout for the New Orleans Saints. Thereafter, he was part of a massive tryout held by the San Francisco 49ers toward the end of March. Continuing with a busy 2012 off-season, Brohm was invited to attend the New Orleans Saints rookie mini-camp on a tryout basis.

Brohm returned to the Locomotives for the 2012 season, serving again as Clement's backup. He saw action beginning in the Week 3 game against the Sacramento Mountain Lions after an injury to Clement; his first play was an 80-yard touchdown pass. Brohm was among the 78 players from both the Locomotives and Omaha Nighthawks who filed a class-action lawsuit against UFL majority owner Bill Hambrecht for unpaid salary after the 2012 season was cut short.

Hamilton Tiger-Cats
On April 16, 2013, Brohm agreed to terms with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League. Brohm spent the 2013 CFL season on the injured list; seeing no playing time during the regular season or playoffs.

On March 3, 2014, Brohm was traded to the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the CFL in exchange for a conditional draft pick in the 2015 CFL Draft. Brohm played in 4 games during the 2014 season, starting in 1 game and receiving significant playing in the other 2 games. He completed 39 of 70 passes (55.7%) for 454 yards with 0 touchdowns and 1 interception (passer rating of 69.6). Following the 2014 CFL season Brohm and the Bombers initially did not come to terms on a new contract; resulting in Brohm becoming a free-agent on February 10, 2015.
