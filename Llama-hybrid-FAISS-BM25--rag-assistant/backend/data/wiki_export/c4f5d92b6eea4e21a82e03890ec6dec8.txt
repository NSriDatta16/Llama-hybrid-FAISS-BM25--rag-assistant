Split Rock Creek State Park is a state park of Minnesota, USA, located in Ihlen, or just south of Pipestone.

The Works Progress Administration built a dam in 1938 to create a lake, which provided an opportunity for water recreation in an area of the state with few natural lakes.  The dam was constructed of Sioux Quartzite, a hard red rock widely found in the area.  A nearby bridge, Split Rock Creek Bridge, was also built by the WPA of Sioux quartzite in 1938.  The bridge carries County Road 54 over the creek.  It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Minnesota Masonry-Arch Highway Bridges MPS.
