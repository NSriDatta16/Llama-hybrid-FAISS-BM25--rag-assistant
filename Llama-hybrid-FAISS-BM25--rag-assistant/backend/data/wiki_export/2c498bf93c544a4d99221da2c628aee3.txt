History
This station received its original construction permit from the Federal Communications Commission on February 25, 2000. The new station was assigned the call letters WJWD by the FCC on August 1, 2001. WJWD received its license to cover from the FCC on March 19, 2003.

WJWD first signed on in January 2003. In February 2007, the station applied to the FCC for a "main studio waiver" that would allow the station to be operated remotely from outside the broadcast area of the station itself.

Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa sold the station in 2010 to the Calvary Radio Network.
