Ralph Penza (November 22, 1932 â€“ February 16, 2007) was an American senior correspondent and substitute anchor for WNBC in New York City.

He was credited by peers within the journalism community with introducing the 'walking head shot,' whereby the reporter literally walked the audience through the scene of the crime, event, etc. The technique has been widely emulated and is currently taught at Columbia University and NYU.

Biography
While in high school, Penza served as a copy boy for Walter Winchell. Penza graduated from New York University, where he was a member of Alpha Phi Delta, with a bachelor's degree in radio and television.

In February 1998, while covering Pope John Paul II's trip to Cuba, Penza located Joanne Chesimard, who was convicted of killing New Jersey state trooper Werner Foerster twenty-four years earlier. She was sentenced to life in prison but escaped in 1979 and fled to Cuba for political asylum. She spoke to Penza in an interview, during which she maintained her innocence and recounted the night of the shooting.

Penza's coverage of the Pope's visit to the Holy Land earned him an Emmy Award in 2000.
