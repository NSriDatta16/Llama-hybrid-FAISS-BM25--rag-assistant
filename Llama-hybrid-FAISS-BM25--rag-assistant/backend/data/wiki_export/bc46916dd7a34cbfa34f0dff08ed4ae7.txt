Career
Atias was first elected to the Knesset on Shas' list in the 2006 elections. In May 2006, he was promoted to the position of Minister of Communications in the last government.

He retained his seat in the 2009 elections, having been placed second on the Shas list, and was appointed Minister of Housing and Construction in the Netanyahu government. In June 2009, Atias called for the segregation of Israel's Arab population from Jewish Israelis, saying that achieving it was "a national duty ... populations that should not mix are spreading ... I don't think that it is appropriate [for them] to live together".

Atias retained his seat again in the 2013 Knesset elections, but Shas was not included in the coalition, resulting in Atias losing his ministerial post. He resigned from the Knesset in June 2014 in order to take a break from politics, and was replaced by Yoav Ben-Tzur.

He also created the number portability reform in which a user is given the rights to his cellular number, thus allowing users more freedom to move from one company to another, encouraging competition between cellular companies Another one of his initiatives as Minister of Communications was opening the market for Mobile virtual network operators.

In 2007, he tried to get a law passed that would censor violence, sex, and gambling on the internet.
