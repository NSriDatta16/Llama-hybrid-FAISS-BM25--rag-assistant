Music video
The music video for "Silver and Cold" was directed by John Hillcoat and shot in Prague, Czech Republic. The band came up with the concept for the video and director Hillcoat developed it. It shows band members Jade Puget, Adam Carson, and Hunter Burgan rushing to stop the vocalist Davey Havok from committing suicide by jumping off of the Manes Bridge, but as they reach him, they die in a horrific car crash. Havok appears to walk away unharmed but you can see his arm pass through a bystander as if he is a ghost.
