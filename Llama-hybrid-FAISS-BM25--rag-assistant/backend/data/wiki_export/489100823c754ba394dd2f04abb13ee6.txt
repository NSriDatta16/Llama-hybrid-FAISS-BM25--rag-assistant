Critical reception
The Riverfront Times called the album a "fantastic moodpiece" and a "bargain bin treasure." Trouser Press wrote that Richard Butler's "nicotine-coated growl has, over the years, mellowed into a powerful scratchy croon that shimmers on his most accessible record since the Furs’ glory days."
