Details
The Burnaby Express won the tournament on May 14 against the Yorkton Terriers, 8-2, in the Royal Bank Cup final.  Burnaby almost did not make it to the final as they were down 2-0 to the Fort William North Stars in the first of two tournament semi-finals.  With just 1:53 to go in the game, Mark Santorelli of the Express broke the shutout bid by the North Stars' goalie Carter Hutton.  The Express put on extreme pressure in the 3rd period, and with a their final chance, with 11 seconds to go, Express 16-year-old stand-out Kyle Turris scored to tie the game.  Turris' goal was on the team's 24th shot of the third period.  The comeback rally was too much for the North Stars as the Express' Mark Soares scored the game clincher 6:19 into Overtime.  By far the best player of the game was Fort William's goaltender Carter Hutton who held the eventual champions scoreless for over 58 minutes and stopped 44 of 47 shots.

In the Championship game, the Express came out with 3 quick goals in the first period and at one point were up 6-0 over Yorkton in the middle of the second period.  Kyle Turris stole the show for Burnaby with a hat-trick and often skated circles around Yorkton's defense.  The Express were clearly dominant throughout the Final, but the Terriers did make it interesting when they scored 2 quick goals near the end of the second period.  The Express iced it halfway through the third with another 2 quick goals, and held the Terriers down until time expired.

Turris was the tournament's leading scorer (combined totals) with 7 goals and 6 assists in 6 games and scored the tourney's only hat-trick.  Dennis Morrison of Fort William was the round robin scoring leader with 3 goals, 5 assists in 4 games.  Burnaby held Morrison to a single assist in the semi-final game, possibly the reason for the demise of an impressive Fort William squad.
