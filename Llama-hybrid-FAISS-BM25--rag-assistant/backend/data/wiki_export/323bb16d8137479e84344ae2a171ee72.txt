The National Assembly of Republika Srpska (, abbr. НСРС/NSRS) is the legislative body of Republika Srpska, one of two entities of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The current assembly is the ninth since the founding of the entity.

History
The National Assembly of Republika Srpska was founded on 24 October 1991 as the Assembly of the Serb People of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with its administrative seat in Sarajevo. Due to the Bosnian War, the seat was moved to Pale, where it remained until 1998, when it was moved to Banja Luka, its current location. From 1991 to 1996, the Assembly was composed of Serb representatives elected in 1990 for the Assembly of the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, most of them members of the Serb Democratic Party (SDS). By the time when the Constitution of Republika Srpska was promulged in February 1992, the Assembly was made of 72 seats for the SDS, 4 for the Union of Reform Forces of Yugoslavia (SRSJ) and one for the Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO). The first parliamentary bloc oppossed to nationalist forces came into scene in 1994 with the Independent Members of Parliament Caucus (IMPC), a splinter of the SRSJ led by Milorad Dodik.
