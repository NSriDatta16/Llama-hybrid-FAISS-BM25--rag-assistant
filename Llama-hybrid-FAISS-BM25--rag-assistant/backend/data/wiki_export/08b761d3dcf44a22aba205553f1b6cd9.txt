Early life

Livingston was born  in Callendar, Stirling, Scotland. He was the eldest surviving son of Agnes (née Hepburn) Livingston and William Livingston, 4th Lord Livingston of Callendar, and succeeded his father to the title of Lord Livingston in about 1518.  Among his siblings was younger brother William Livingston, Captain of the Royal Castle of Kirkwall, and younger sister, Margaret Livingston, who married John Hay, 4th Lord Hay of Yester.

His paternal grandparents were James Livingston, 3rd Lord Livingston, and Agnes (née Houston) Livingston. His maternal grandparents were Alexander Hepburn of Whitsome (third son of Patrick Hepburn, 1st Lord Hailes) and Janet (née Napier) Hepburn, daughter of Sir Alexander Napier of Merchiston. His maternal uncle was James Hepburn, the Bishop of Moray.

Career
In 1522, Livingston was a commander of the Scottish forces against England. He served as an Extraordinary Lord of Session in 1542, and as one of the eight Lord Keepers of Mary, Queen of Scots in her infancy.

He was paid £813 for keeping the infant queen in Linlithgow Palace before she moved to Stirling Castle in July 1543, where he was also her keeper. He served as Privy Councillor in 1545.

When Queen Mary went to France in 1548, following her betrothal to the Dauphin, Francis II, Livingston accompanied her, and remained there until he died.

Jeanne de Piédefer, Lady Livingston
After Lord Livingston's death, a French captain called de Faucher wrote to his widow, Jeanne, "Madame de Levyston", as his "valentine" from Dumbarton Castle mentioning the arrival of a ship with fine cinnamon. He said he had found a supplier of water-cress and parsley for salads.

Jeanne married Pierre de Joisel, Seigneur de Saint Rémy-en-Bouzemont et de Betoncourt, squire of the equerry to Mary of Guise and (in 1560) one of five masters of the household to Mary, Queen of Scots. They returned to France in 1559 but returned to Scotland and England to serve Mary, Queen of Scots.

They bought the manor of Saint Rémy-en-Bouzemont in July 1559. Their children, Claude (b. 1560), Jacqueline, Jacques (b. 1562), Pierre and Jeanne de Joisel were born and brought up in France. She came to Mary at Bolton Castle on 8 August 1568 with two women servants and eight male servants.
