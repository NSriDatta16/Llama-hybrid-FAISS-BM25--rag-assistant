History
The parish of Holme was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, most of Holum (population: 1,127) was merged with the town of Mandal and the municipality of Halse og Harkmark to form a new, larger Mandal municipality. The remainder of Holum (the Stubstad and Svalemyren areas, with a population of 9) was merged into the neighboring municipality of SÃ¸gne.

Name
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old Holme farm () since the first Holum Church was built there. The first element is  which means "hole" or "hollow". The last element comes from the word  which means "home" or "abode". The spelling of the name was changed from Holme to Holum in 1911.

Government
While it existed, this municipality was responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment, social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads.
