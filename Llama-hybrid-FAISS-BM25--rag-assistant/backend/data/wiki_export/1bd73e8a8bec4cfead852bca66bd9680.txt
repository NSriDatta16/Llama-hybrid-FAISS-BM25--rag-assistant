Controversies
The role and extent of non-party organisations in social media advertising during the UK general election of 2019 was examined by BBC journalist Rory Cellan-Jones. Tracey was identified as the sponsor of a Facebook advert, which opposed the Labour Party's 2019 pledge to remove charitable status and tax exemptions from private schools in the United Kingdom.

His wife Katharine Tracey, formerly Katharine Gardner, became a senior councillor on Wandsworth London Borough Council for 29 years, and received the OBE for services to education. They had four children and eight grandchildren.
