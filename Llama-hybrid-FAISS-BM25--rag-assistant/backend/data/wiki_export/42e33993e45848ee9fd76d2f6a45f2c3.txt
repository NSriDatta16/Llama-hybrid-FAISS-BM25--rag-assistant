William Anthony Bartee ( ; born June 25, 1977) is a former American football cornerback in the National Football League (NFL). He played his entire career for the Kansas City Chiefs.  He spent two years at the University of Oklahoma after beginning his college career at Butler County Community College in El Dorado, Kansas.  He totaled 60 tackles, two interceptions, two fumble recoveries, 2 forced fumbles, 7 tackles for loss, 12 passes defensed and 1 sack.  He was selected by Kansas City in the 2000 NFL Draft. Before the 2006 season, the Chiefs signed Ty Law, so William Bartee agreed to change his number from 24 to 21.

Bartee missed the entire 2006 season due to injury and was placed on the PUP list in November. He was released by the Chiefs after the season.
