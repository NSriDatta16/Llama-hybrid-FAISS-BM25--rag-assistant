The Paraguayan Basketball Federation (in Spanish: Confederaci칩n Paraguaya de B치squetbol) is the governing body of basketball in Paraguay. The PBF organizes male and female competitions for both the National League (for teams outside of Asunci칩n) and the Metropolitan League (only for teams from Asunci칩n), and runs the Paraguay national basketball team.

History
In 1936, no governing body of basketball existed in Paraguay, so basketball was part of the Paraguayan Sports Association until 1947, the year in which the Paraguayan Basketball Federation was founded. That same year, it joined the International Basketball Federation (FIBA).
