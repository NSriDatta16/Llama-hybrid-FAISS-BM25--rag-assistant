Buzz Factory is the fourth studio album by Seattle-based band Screaming Trees, released in the spring of 1989. It was their final record for SST Records before they moved on to their major label debut. The LP was available on translucent purple vinyl. While touring to support the album, SST had informed that band multiple times that their album would shortly be released. However, this failed to materialize until the last day of the tour, after which they elected to leave SST. Their next recording, the Change Has Come EP, was released in December 1989 on Sub Pop.

Critical reception

The Chicago Tribune wrote that the band "takes psychedelic garage-rock into the '90s, cranking up the wah-wah peddle to stun volume and riding a torrent of percussion."
