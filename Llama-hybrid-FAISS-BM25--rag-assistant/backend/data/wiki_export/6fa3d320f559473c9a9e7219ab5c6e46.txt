Slavko Dokmanović (Serbian Cyrillic: Славко Докмановић; 14 December 1949 – 29 June 1998) was a Croatian Serb who was charged with grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, violation of the customs of war and crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) for his actions in the Vukovar massacre while he served as the city's mayor.

Dokmanović faced two charges of each count. He was arrested in 1997 by the Polish special forces GROM and pleaded not guilty to all charges. However, he died on 29 June 1998, having hanged himself in his cell, and his trial's proceedings soon stopped without a verdict. He was indicted along with Mile Mrkšić, Veselin Šljivančanin and Miroslav Radić, who were all on trial for their alleged role in the massacre.
