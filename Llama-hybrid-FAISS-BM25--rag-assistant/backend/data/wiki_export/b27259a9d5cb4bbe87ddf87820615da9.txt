Sydney, the largest city in Australia, is home to 1,168 completed high-rise buildings, more than any other city in Australia. Of those completed or topped out, the entire city (including metropolitan suburbs) has 49 buildings that reach a height of at least , of which 17 reach a height of at least  – the second–highest number of skyscrapers in Australia, as well as a further 16 buildings rising to at least  in height currently under construction.

Although the tallest buildings in the city have historically been concentrated in the central business district and immediate surrounding areas such as Barangaroo and Ultimo, suburbs within the Sydney metropolitan area have all seen a substantial surge in the development of high rises and skyscrapers in recent years, with major satellite centres such as Chatswood, Parramatta, North Sydney, St Leonards and Macquarie Park all witnessing or playing host to the construction of skyscrapers rising above 150 metres. As a result, Sydney has the tallest building and most skyscrapers (reaching at least 150 metres or above) outside an inner city area or core in Australia.

Sydney was one of the first cities in Australia and internationally to welcome the introduction of skyscrapers and high-rise office blocks in the mid 20th century, alongside cities in the U.S., including New York City and Chicago. Witnessing a boom in the 20th century, Sydney has played host to various buildings which have held the title of the tallest building in Australia including St James' Church, the Sydney Town Hall, the Garden Palace, the General Post Office, AWA Tower, AMP Building, 25 Martin Place, and the Australia Square tower in 1967 at  tall, which was Australia's first true skyscraper as defined as rising above or at least 150 metres high. Since 2020, Crown Sydney has been Sydney's tallest building and the 4th tallest building in Australia, rising to a height of .

History

19th century 
Sydney played host to Australia's first tallest building in 1824 with the construction of St James' Church. Standing at a height of , it was commissioned by Governor Lachlan Macquarie in 1819, designed by Francis Greenway and constructed between 1820 and 1824 using convict labour. The partially complete Sydney Town Hall, built in Victorian Second Empire style, surpassed this height in 1878 with the completion of its clock tower that stood at a height of . This title was briefly held until the completion of the Garden Palace in 1879, standing at a height of . The Garden Palace likewise only held this title as tallest briefly, after its demise from a fire in 1882. Hence, the Sydney Town Hall once again became Sydney's tallest until 1891 with the completion of the General Post Office. Standing at a height of , the GPO was at the time described upon opening by the Postmaster General as a building that "will not be surpassed by any other similar structure in the southern hemisphere".

20th century 

Towards the end of the 19th century and throughout the beginning of the 20th century, advances in building technology and design coupled with rising urban land values meant that high rise buildings became an attractive proposition in Sydney. Considered to be Sydney's first high-rise office building, Culwulla Chambers, was completed in 1912 and stood at a height of . Designed by Spain, Cosh and Minnett, the building consisted of 14 floors and cost £100,000 to build, equivalent of approximately $1 million in today's money. This new wave of construction of taller buildings consequently raised concerns over fire risks, namely the inadequate firefighting resources of the period that failed to reach such heights. The fire in the 8 storey Anthony Hordern & Sons building in 1901, which resulted in the death of 5 people, was notably one of the first cases to raise such concerns. In 1907, Alfred Webb; the then Superintendent of the Sydney Metropolitan Fire Brigade, described how it was "a suicidal policy to allow buildings of 100 feet to go up. Our extension ladders rise to a height of 80 feet, and it might be possible to add another 10 feet to them; but the effectiveness of their working is materially decreased as the height is added to." Additionally, public backlash against increased heights also became apparent during this period, primarily stemming from sentiments that taller buildings did not match the aesthetic of Sydney's streetscape and that they would become a source of increased overcrowding and congestion. As a result, the Height of Buildings Act was passed in 1912, which limited all new buildings to a height of . This restriction would go on to stunt the height of Sydney's buildings, lasting until 1957.

Despite these height restrictions, 1939 saw the completion of the AWA Tower, which finally surpassed the General Post Office's title as Sydney's tallest after 48 years. At a height of , the AWA tower also became the city's first building to surpass a height of , and would go on to stay as the tallest until 1962.

1960s and 1970s 
With growing demand for office space, the abolition of the  height limit in 1957 saw a subsequent construction boom for taller buildings beginning in the late 50s through to the early 1960s. During this period, Sydney played host to the construction of various new towers that would subsequently stand as the tallest in the nation. In 1962, the modernist AMP Building was completed, becoming the tallest building in Australia at a height of . Shortly after, Australia Square was completed in 1967, also taking the title tallest in Australia at . At the time, Australia Square was the world's tallest light weight concrete building and was also the first true skyscraper in Australia at over  as defiined by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat.

Following this, the 1970s saw Sydney continue its construction boom and status as the city with the nation's tallest buildings. In 1976, the AMP Centre (now the Quay Quarter Tower) was completed, standing at a record height of . This title was short-lived, with the completion of the Harry Seidler designed MLC Centre in 1977, which stood at a height of 228 metres, the first building in Australia to surpass .

1980s and 1990s 
Since 1981, the Sydney Tower has stood as the tallest structure in Sydney at , though as an observation tower, it fails to be classified as a building as defined by architectural standards set by the CTBUH. In 1992, the Chifley Tower became the tallest building in Sydney at a height of . The 1990s was also a period which saw the construction of numerous residential skyscrapers, starting with The Peak in 1996 at a height of , followed by the Century Tower in 1997 at a height of .

21st century 
A  height restriction implementation persisted in Sydney's building regulations well into the early 2010s. However, this height restriction was lifted in 2016, allowing buildings to be built as high as  on condition that public spaces were not overshadowed. This was further raised to  at the end of 2019.

Sydney's most recent residential tower, 505 George Street, will rise 270 metres, comprising 80 stories much of it serviced apartments. As the tower penetrates Sydney Airport's Obstacle Limitation Surfaces (OLS) it will require an Aeronautical Impact assessment approval.

The current tallest building in Sydney, and the fourth tallest in Australia is Crown Sydney. Completed in 2020 it stands at a height of , overtaking the Chifley Tower's previous title as tallest in Sydney, standing at a height of .
