Located at 200 South First Street in Eldridge (approximately one mile west of U.S. Highway 61), North Scott High School draws students from several communities in northern Scott County, Iowa, including Eldridge, Dixon, Donahue, Long Grove, Maysville, McCausland, Park View, Princeton and surrounding rural areas.

History

North Scott High School was completed in 1958 at a cost of $1.2 million, and originally conceived as a junior-senior high facility. Prior to the school's opening, students living in what is now the North Scott School District completed their high school education at one of a number of area high schools – which included Clinton, Davenport (now Davenport Central), LeClaire (now part of the Pleasant Valley Community School District), Wheatland (now Calamus-Wheatland), or DeWitt.

Junior high students continued to attend the high school until 1975, when they were moved into the newly built North Scott Junior High School. The junior high building is located approximately one-quarter mile southwest of the high school campus.

The high school has undergone many renovations and additions during its 60-year history. A fine arts auditorium, a 900-seat venue opened in 1982; the auditorium was extensively remodeled in 2017 and 2018. The athletic lobby, cafeteria, and administrative offices were also extensively remodeled twice, in 1983 and in 2015.

Other additions have included an auxiliary gymnasium, a special education wing, modern media center with computer labs (updated in the 2010s) and a science and music wing on the school's west end.

In August 2005, North Scott High School received an $800,000 Smaller Learning Communities Grant aimed at assisting students during their high school years.

The Pit
The school's main gymnasium is referred to as "The Pit," in part due to its horseshoe arena-type shape.
