It is the only school in the Fredericton area (between middle and high schools) which was built without one.

The school's motto is the Latin phrase Somnia sunt circuli veritatis which means "Dreams are the seedlings to reality." This motto was chosen by the students voting for the best fitting motto the first year the school was opened.

First Nations imagery, as represented by a stylistic dream catcher, is found in the large window, which is over the main entrance of the school and in the school lobby. This linkage reflects the connections to the First Nation Community of St. Mary's, which is located adjoining the school grounds.
