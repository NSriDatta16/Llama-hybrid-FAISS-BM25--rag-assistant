No. 530 Squadron RAF was one of the ten Turbinlite nightfighter squadrons of the Royal Air Force during the Second World War.

History
No. 530 Squadron was formed at RAF Hunsdon, Hertfordshire on 8 September 1942, from No. 1451 (Turbinlite) Flight, as part of No. 11 Group RAF in Fighter Command. Instead of operating only Turbinlite and -rudimentary- Airborne Intercept (AI) radar equipped aircraft (Havocs and Bostons) and working together with a normal nightfighter unit, such as with 3 Squadron in the Flight, the unit now also flew with their own Hawker Hurricanes. It was disbanded at Hunsdon on 25 January 1943, when Turbinlite squadrons were, due to lack of success on their part and the rapid development of AI radar, thought to be superfluous.
