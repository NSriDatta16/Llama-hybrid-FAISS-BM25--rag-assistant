History
Linn-Mar High School opened in the fall of 1959. It was built at a cost of $243,325 and housed 177 students when it opened. The school board had a naming contest for the school; a then-eighth grade student won $25 for submitting Linn-Mar, judged the best of 75 entries.

In 2016, Newsweek named Linn-Mar to its list of best high schools for low-income students.

LMHS athletic teams are nicknamed the Lions and compete in the Mississippi Valley Conference. A new 6,000-seat athletics stadium opened in 2011, and a new aquatic facility opened in 2013.

Performing arts
Linn-Mar has three competitive show choirs, the mixed-gender "10th Street Edition" and "In Step" as well as the all-female "Hi-Style". 10th Street was undefeated in its 2018, 2022, and 2023 competition seasons. The program hosts an annual competition entitled "Supernova". LMHS also has a competitive marching band and hosts an annual competition for that discipline.
