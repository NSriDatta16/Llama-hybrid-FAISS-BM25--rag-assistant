History

The original SH 93 was designated on January 21, 1924, as the route from Gatesville to the "state reformatory school", which was the state juvenile training and rehabilitation school for boys, a few miles north. On July 25, 1933, this route became a portion of SH 36, but this did not take effect until SH 36 was under construction in the area. On December 22, 1937, the section of SH 97 from Jourdanton to Fowlerton was renumbered to a new SH 93 on December 22, 1937, but this was reverted by April 1, 1938 so this SH 93 was transferred back to SH 97 (signage did not change until June or later).
