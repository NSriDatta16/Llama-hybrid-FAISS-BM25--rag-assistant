Live in Brooklyn is the name of a concert DVD and CD released on July 11, 2006, by the rock band Phish.  Performed on June 17, 2004, at the minor league baseball field KeySpan Park in Brooklyn, New York, it was the opening night of what was then intended as the band's final tour.  The concert was originally recorded for a simulcast in movie theatres. The concert features the debuts of "A Song I Heard the Ocean Sing" and "Nothing", both of which recorded on their most recent album, "Undermind". Also, "Dinner and a Movie" and "The Curtain With" had not been played since their Las Vegas 2000 run shortly before their hiatus.

The following night, at the same venue, the band performed again, with a surprise appearance from rapper Jay-Z. The recording includes some songs from this concert, but not those featuring Jay-Z.

This was the second release from Phish's record label, JEMP Records.
