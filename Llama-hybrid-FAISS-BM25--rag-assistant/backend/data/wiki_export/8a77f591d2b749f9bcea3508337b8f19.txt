History

Original station 
The Inverness and Ross-shire Railway, which was to be a line between  and , was authorised in 1860, and opened in stages. The first section, between Inverness and , opened on 11 June 1862, and Beauly was one of the stations built for the original line. It had two platforms, a passing loop and a goods shed with sidings that was equipped with a 1½-ton crane. The station was host to a LMS caravan from 1936 to 1939.

The station closed a nearly a century later, on 13 June 1960, along with all other stations between Inverness and . This was due to increasing competition from motorbuses, particularly those of Highland Omnibuses Ltd.

2002 reopening 

Following a local campaign, the station was reopened on 15 April 2002. A new single platform, shelter and car park were built in a £250,000 project. The platform is the shortest in Great Britain: at the length of , it is shorter than a single carriage of a  train that is usually used on this line.

Facilities 
There is a small car park at the station, in which there are cycle racks and lockers. On the platform, there is a modern waiting shelter, in which there is a payphone. As there are no facilities to purchase tickets, passengers must buy one in advance, or from the guard on the train.
