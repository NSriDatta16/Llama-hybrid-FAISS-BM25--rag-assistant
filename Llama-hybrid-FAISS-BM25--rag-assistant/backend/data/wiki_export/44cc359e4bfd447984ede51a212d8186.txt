Bunbury is an electoral district of the Legislative Assembly in the Australian state of Western Australia.

The district, taking in the city of Bunbury, has existed continuously since 1890, being one of the original 30 seats contested at the 1890 general election. Except for 2005-2008 the seat has always been held by the party of government, making it an effective bellwether. Two early Premiers of Western Australia, Sir John Forrest and Sir Newton Moore, held Bunbury during their time in office. However, after Moore's retirement in 1911, another member for Bunbury was not appointed to a cabinet post until 2008, when John Castrilli became Minister for Local Government under Colin Barnett.
