Club career

Nicolae Lupescu was born on 17 December 1940 in Bucharest, Romania. He started to play football at junior level in 1954 at ICAR București, afterwards playing for Flacăra Roșie București, starting his senior career by playing two seasons in Divizia B, the first one at Academia Militară București and the second at Olimpia București. He was eventually brought to Rapid București by coach Nicolae Roșculeț where he debuted in Divizia A on 16 September 1962 in a 4–2 victory against Farul Constanța. He remained with Rapid for ten seasons, winning the title in the 1966–67 season, being used by coach Valentin Stănescu in 26 matches in which he scored one goal.

During Romania's communist era, transfers of Romanian footballers outside the country were rarely allowed, but Lupescu convinced Ștefan Andrei who was the Secretary for Foreign Relations of the Central Committee to help him gain the regime's approval of his transfer at Admira Wacker in 1972 for which Rapid received 40.000$. He made his Austrian Bundesliga debut on 15 September 1972 under coach Ernst Ocwirk in a 0–0 against Austria Klagenfurt, the team finishing the season on the 4th place, which would be the best performance of the team in the championship during his 5 seasons spent there, also helping Admira eliminate Inter Milan in the 1973–74 UEFA Cup. Nicolae Lupescu has a total of 244 matches and 8 goals scored in Divizia A, 134 games and 9 goals scored in the Austrian Bundesliga and 16 appearances without scoring in European competitions.

He played 8 matches and scored two goals at the 1972 Euro qualifiers, managing to reach the quarter-finals where Romania was defeated by Hungary, who advanced to the final tournament.
