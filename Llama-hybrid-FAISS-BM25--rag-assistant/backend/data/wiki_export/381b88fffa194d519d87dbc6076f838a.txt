The Texas Tornado were a Junior A hockey team located in Frisco, Texas, USA. The team joined the North American Hockey League's Central division in 1999 (and moved into the newly formed southern division three years later) while located in North Richland Hills, Texas, and enjoyed unprecedented success since their expansion year.

The Tornado played their home games at the 6,000-seat Dr Pepper Arena in Frisco.

On May 13, 2006, the Tornado won their third straight Robertson Cup by defeating the Bozeman Icedogs. This accomplishment would be the first time in over 15 years that a team won three consecutive Robertson Cups. On May 8, 2012, the Tornado won their 5th Robertson Cup in team history by defeating the St. Louis Bandits 4-3 in overtime. The Tornado were owned and operated by the Consolidated Sports Holdings USA, Inc. In the 2013 offseason, the Tornado were sold to Texas Hockey Partners (THP) and relocated back to North Richland Hills becoming the Lone Star Brahmas.
