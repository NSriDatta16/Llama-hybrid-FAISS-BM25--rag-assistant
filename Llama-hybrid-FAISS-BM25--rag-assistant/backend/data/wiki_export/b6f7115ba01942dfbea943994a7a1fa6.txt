Frederick Corder (26 January 1852 – 21 August 1932) was an English composer and music teacher.

Life

Corder was born in Hackney, the son of Micah Corder and his wife Charlotte Hill. He was educated at Blackheath Proprietary School  and started music lessons, particularly piano, early. Later he studied with Henry Gadsby. After that he studied harmony with Claude Couldery.

Frederick Corder continued his studies at the Royal Academy of Music, where he studied with George Alexander Macfarren (harmony and composition), William Cusins (piano) and William Watson (violin). In 1875, he earned a Mendelssohn Scholarship, which  enabled him to study for four years abroad. He spent the first three in the Cologne Conservatory in Cologne, where he studied composition with Ferdinand Hiller and piano with Isidor Seiss. He spent his last year in Milan, without formal instruction. He did however meet Arrigo Boito and Giuseppe Verdi. Upon his return to England, in 1879, he became conductor at the Brighton Aquarium. In August 1884, for a single month, he filled in for William Robinson as a musical director for the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, touring Patience and Iolanthe. Several of his operatic works were performed by the touring company of Alice Barth in the early 1880s.

Corder became professor of composition at the Royal Academy of Music in London, becoming the Academy's curator in 1889. His students included notable British composers such as Granville Bantock, Arnold Bax, York Bowen, Alan Bush, Eric Coates, Benjamin Dale, Harry Farjeon, Joseph Holbrooke and Montague Phillips, as well as his own son, Paul Corder. With others, Frederick Corder co-founded the Society of British Composers in 1905 and served as its first chairman. While at the Academy, Corder was living at 13, Albion Road (now Harben Road) in Hampstead, where he often held gatherings of fellow musicians and students, including Bax.

He developed an early fascination with Richard Wagner and produced with his wife the first accepted English translations of The Ring and other works by Wagner. Liszt was also an important influence, and Corder produced one of the first English language studies of Liszt. His own compositions included songs, operas and cantatas. Corder's Prospero overture is available in full score and can be heard on CD. Corder married Henrietta Walford, the daughter of Henry Walford on 25 September 1876. They had a daughter, Dorothea Charlotte (known as Dolly), born on 30 June 1878 (died in her nineties), and a son, Paul Walford Corder, born on 14 December 1879 (died on 7 August 1942). Corder's sister, Rosa Corder, was a friend of Dante Gabriel Rossetti and painted his portrait. He married his second wife, the pianist and composer Eleanor Rudall in 1927.

Legacy
Corder's opposite number at the Royal College of Music was Charles Villiers Stanford. He represented the conservative Brahms faction of English academia, whereas Corder followed the more progressive influence of Liszt and Wagner. In particular, many of Corder's pupils showed the influence of the "clever primitivism and latent giganticism" of The Ring, but little of the eroticism of Tristan. History favours the legacy of Stanford, whose pupils included Vaughan Williams, John Ireland, Gustav Holst and Frank Bridge, while (arguably) Corder's one major talent was Bax. The critic Peter J Pirie put in this way:
