Lego Harry Potter (stylized as LEGO Harry Potter) is a Lego theme based on the film series of the same name and the eponymous novels by British author J. K. Rowling. It is licensed from Warner Bros. Lego models of important scenes, vehicles and characters were made for the first six films and all of the published books. The first sets appeared in 2001, to coincide with the release of the first film, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. Subsequent sets were released alongside the new films, until Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. The line then went dormant for three years, with sets being released in 2010 and 2011. In 2018, it was announced that more sets based on the Harry Potter franchise would be released, including new sets based on Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and its sequel, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.

Overview
The main focus of the line is Harry Potter's first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as he discovers that he is a famous wizard and begins his education. Later on, sets based on other installments and spin-offs would be produced too.

In October 2021, Matthew Lewis, who portrayed Neville Longbottom in the Harry Potter films, recreated his favorite scenes to celebrate 20 Years of Movie Magic with Lego Harry Potter.

In July 2022, Lego Con hosts Joel McHale and Vick Hope build their own Lego Hogwarts version using building tips from Lego Harry Potter designer, Marcos Bessa. Evanna Lynch, who portrayed Luna Lovegood in the Harry Potter films, she explores on a magical adventure through Warner Bros. Studio Tour London – The Making of Harry Potter and how they inspired the current Lego Harry Potter sets.

Development
Lego Harry Potter was inspired by the films of the Harry Potter series. The construction toy range was based on the films and developed in collaboration with Warner Bros. Consumer Products. The construction sets were designed to recreate the story and characters of the films in Lego form.

Launch
The first Lego Harry Potter sets were launched in September 2001. In January 2004, Lego owner and CEO Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen announced a change in direction for the company, which at the time was facing a DKK 1.4 billion loss, and that the company would focus on core products and not "big, movie-related IPs such as Harry Potter". A week later, the company clarified that this did not mean any immediate "radical changes", and that the Harry Potter theme would continue. However, the theme was discontinued after 2007 for a time. The original Lego Harry Potter minifigure skin tone was yellow until April 2004 when they switched to more realistic natural skin tones.

In June 2009, it was officially announced by Lego that a video game, Lego Harry Potter: Years 1–4, was in production and released in June 2010. Lego Harry Potter: Years 5–7 was released in November 2011.

These sets have newly decorated mini-figures and animals including Luna Lovegood, Bellatrix Lestrange, new owls and new pigs.  Also announced was a Lego Harry Potter board game that was made available in August. In 2013, The Lego Group discontinued Lego Harry Potter sets. However, a Lego Dimensions add-on pack featuring Harry Potter and Voldemort was scheduled to be released on 27 September 2016.
