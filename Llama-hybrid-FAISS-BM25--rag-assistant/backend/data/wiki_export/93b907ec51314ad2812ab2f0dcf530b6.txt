Reception 
S Venkat Narayan of India Today wrote "Andhaa Kaanoon (Blind Law) is what they call a masala film. It has violence, injustice, sex, revenge, thrills, good photography, slick direction. The potion is, like the witches' brew, deadly. The story is too complicated to bother about. Suffice it to say that it's all about the law being an ass."
