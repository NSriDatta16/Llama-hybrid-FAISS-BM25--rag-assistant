History
Named in honor of Mary Butler Markley, a distinguished faculty widow who had been active in alumnae affairs, Mary Markley Hall was completed in 1959 at a cost of $6.1 million. Originally designed to provide housing and dining for approximately 1000 women, Markley Hall's overall layout embodies simplistic and routine arrangements; most resident rooms are doubles. In 1963, Markley Hall became co-educational.

Famous past residents include comedians Randy and Jason Sklar professionally known as the Sklar Brothers, and Tommy Dye.

Location
Mary Markley Hall is located at 1503 Washington Heights: ZIP code 48109. The hall is a part of the "Hill Neighborhood," which is an area on the northeast corner of UM's central campus. The hall is separated from the other area residence halls by the School of Public Health. However, the other residence halls on "The Hill" are located along Palmer Field.  The area beneath the skyway that connects the School of Public Health's two buildings is prone to trapping strong gusts of air, thus leading Markley residents who must regularly pass through to dub it "the Wind Tunnel."

Markley Hall is in between the University Hospital campus to the north (across East Medical Center Drive), Forest Hill Cemetery to the south (across Washington Heights), the Arbor Heights Center and the Nichols Arboretum (to the east), and the University of Michigan School of Public Health (to the west).

Facilities
Markley offers the only dining hall in the Hill Neighborhood other than the Hill Dining Center at Mosher-Jordan Hall. Also it has a Residential Computing Site, four laundry facilities, a Community Learning Center, one lounge serving the entire hall, numerous floor lounges, and one multi-cultural lounge. Markley features five elevators: two normal elevators, two (somewhat hidden) freight-style elevators which serve the four wings of the building, plus one staff-only elevator that serves on the loading dock kitchen and front desk, although it is not unusual for at least one elevator to be broken at any given time. During the 2006–07 school year, the Markley Hall Council made significant enhancements to the floor lounges by purchasing numerous ping pong tables, televisions, and foosball tables for student use.
