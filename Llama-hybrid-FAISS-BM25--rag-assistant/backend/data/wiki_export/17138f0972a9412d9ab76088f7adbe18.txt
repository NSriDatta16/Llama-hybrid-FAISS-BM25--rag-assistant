Henderson is a surname of Scottish origin. The name is derived from patronymic form of the name Hendry, which is a Scottish form of Henry. In Scottish Gaelic it is rendered MacEanraig (masculine), and NicEanraig (feminine).

The surname Henderson is borne by numerous unrelated families in Scotland. For example, the Hendersons of Fordell, in Fife, were the chief Lowland family of the name, Clan Henderson. The Hendersons of Glencoe, a sept of Clan Donald, derive their surname from the Gaelic MacEanruig.

The surname was unknown in England prior to the 17th century and is first mentioned in a marriage document between one of the Borders Hendersons and the daughter of a Carlisle merchant at Hexham.
