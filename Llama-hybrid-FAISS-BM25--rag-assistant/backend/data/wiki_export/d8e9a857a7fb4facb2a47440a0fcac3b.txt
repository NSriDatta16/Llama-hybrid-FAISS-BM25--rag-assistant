Pritchardia viscosa, the stickybud pritchardia  or loulu, is an extremely rare endangered species of Pritchardia palm that is endemic to the Hawaiian island of Kauai.

It inhabits open wet forests in the Kalihiwai Valley, where it grows at altitudes of . Associated plants include aiea (Ilex anomala), ahakea (Bobea spp.), hame, (Antidesma spp.), hāpuu pulu (Cibotium glacum), and kōpiko (Psychotria hexandra).

It is a medium-sized palm from  tall, with palmate (fan-shaped) leaves about   long. The fruit is produced in dense clusters, each fruit green, pear-shaped,  long and  in diameter.

Like the related Nihoa Fan Palm (P. remota), it is susceptible to extinction by a single catastrophic event because of its wild population of four individuals. It is threatened by introduced rats, which eat the seeds. It has been cultivated to a moderate extent, but is exceptionally limited in its habitat.
