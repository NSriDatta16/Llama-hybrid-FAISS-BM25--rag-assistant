Jerome Kendrick Pate (born September 16, 1953) is an American professional golfer on the PGA Tour Champions, formerly on the PGA Tour. As a 22-year-old rookie, he won the U.S. Open in 1976.

Early life
Born in Macon, Georgia, Pate grew up in the panhandle of Florida at Pensacola.

Amateur career 
He attended the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa and played on its Crimson Tide golf team. He had a distinguished amateur career with a win at the U.S. Amateur in  and was a member of victorious U.S. teams at the Eisenhower Trophy competition later that year and for the Walker Cup in May 1975 at St Andrews in Scotland. A few weeks later, he tied Walker Cup teammate Jay Haas of Wake Forest for low amateur at the U.S. Open, finishing in a six-way tie for eighteenth place at Medinah, outside Chicago.

Professional career
Pate turned professional in 1975. Late in the year was the medalist at Fall 1975 PGA Tour Qualifying School. During his rookie season he won the 1976 U.S. Open. He also won the Canadian Open that year. Pate closed with a 63 (-7) to defeat runner-up Jack Nicklaus by four strokes. Pate was selected as the Rookie of the Year and Co-Player of the Year.

Six more tour victories followed in ensuing years as well as several other titles around the world. He was a member of the victorious Ryder Cup team in 1981 but shoulder injuries curtailed his career. His final win on the PGA Tour came at age 28. That final victory was at the 1982 Tournament Players Championship, the first held at TPC at Sawgrass. Pate celebrated by throwing course designer Pete Dye and PGA Tour commissioner Deane Beman into the lake adjacent to the 18th green, then jumped in himself. He had also jumped in the water after a victory the previous June, after going nearly three years without a win.

Later career 
Pate later served as a golf broadcaster for ABC, CBS, and BBC. He also set up a golf course design practice and a turf and irrigation company. He designed the Kiva Dunes in 1995 and the Ol' Colony Golf Complex in 2000, which is the home course for the Alabama Crimson Tide golf team. In 2006, he earned his first Champions Tour win at the Outback Steakhouse Pro-Am. Pate has been forced by health problems, including arthroscopic left-knee surgery in 2010, to begin limiting his Champions Tour appearances.

Personal life 
In the late 1990s, Pate returned to the University of Alabama to complete his bachelor's degree in administrative science. His daughter, Jenni, received her degree at the same graduation ceremony in 2001.
