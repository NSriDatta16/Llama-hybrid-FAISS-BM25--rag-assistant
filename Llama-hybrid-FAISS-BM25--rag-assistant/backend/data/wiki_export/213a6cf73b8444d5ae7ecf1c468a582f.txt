Kittybrewster is an area within Aberdeen, Scotland, north of the city centre and roughly southwest of Old Aberdeen.

Transport

Within the area the A9012 road joins the A978 road; there are also several railway tracks, one of which follows the route of the Aberdeenshire Canal. The name Kittybrewster has been given to three railway stations over the years, including Aberdeen's original main railway station for routes to the north (on the Great North of Scotland Railway). All three stations are now gone, although the route north continues.

Facilities
The area now contains a small number of bars, the Kittybrewster and Woodside Bowling Club, Kittybrewster Primary School, two retail parks (on the sites of former railway yards), a council depot (on the site of one of the old and closed railway stations) and the moderne-styled Northern Hotel.
