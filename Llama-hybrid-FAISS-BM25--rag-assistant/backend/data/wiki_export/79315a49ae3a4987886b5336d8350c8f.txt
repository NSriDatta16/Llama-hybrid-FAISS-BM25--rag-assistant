Content
In the title  song, Parton looks back on her impoverished upbringing, concluding that while she values the lessons it taught her, she would not want to go back. The humorous "He's a Go Getter" plays on an unexpected pun, "When his wife gets off from work, he'll go get 'er." Parton also covers the Jeannie C. Riley hit "Harper Valley PTA", Tammy Wynette's "D-I-V-O-R-C-E",  and Porter Wagoner's hit, "The Carroll County Accident".

Parton re-recorded the title song for her 1973 album My Tennessee Mountain Home.

Parton re-recorded "The Carroll County Accident" with Buck Trent for his 2018 album Spartanburg Blues.

Critical reception

The review published in the February 15, 1969 issue of Billboard said, "Without doubt this will be a big hit LP for Dolly Parton... just as it will be considered a great package of entertainment by her friends. The key to the LP is her empathy on "In the Good Old Day (When Times Were Bad)", but also she tugs the heartstrings on "D-I-V-O-R-C-E" and gets through to the emotion on "The Carrol County Accident"."

Cashbox published a review of the album, saying that, "Gaining in strength as one of the more popular country female artists, Dolly Parton follows up her chart single of "In the Good Old Days (When Times Were Bad)" with a strong LP that should solidify her position with the disk buyers. In addition to her own hit single, the LP features such monster titles as "D-I-V-O-R-C-E" and "Harper Valley PTA", among others."

AllMusic rated the album 3.5 out of 5 stars.

On a list of the top 50 Dolly Parton songs, Rolling Stone magazine listed the title track at number 28, citing that "this marked the first time on record that the songwriter addressed her hardscrabble Smoky Mountain childhood head-on."
