Gary Mallaber (born October 11, 1946, in Buffalo) is a Los Angeles session drummer, percussionist and singer.  He attended Lafayette High School, where he and Bobby Militello, along with other musicians, were mentored by saxophonist Sam Scamacca.  Mallaber got his start playing drums in a Buffalo band known as Raven.

Mallaber was the drummer-percussionist and backing singer for the 1980s band Kid Lightning, who released an album with Gerard McMahon in 1981 entitled Blue Rue.

Mallaber plays keyboards and sings on many albums by well-known rock artists.  He is probably best known for his work as drummer-percussionist, backup singer, and co-composer for The Steve Miller Band. He has also played with the Greg Kihn Band.
