History
Brookline High School was founded in the Spring of 1843. Instruction began on August 17, 1843, on the lower floor of the Town Hall on Walnut Street described by a former student as a "dismal, damp and dark room...not unlike a tomb". Benjamin H. Rhodes, a Brown University graduate, was the founding Headmaster, serving until 1847. Rhodes was succeed as Headmaster by Hezekia Shailer who served until 1854. John Emory Horr, a Harvard College graduate, then served as Headmaster for 33 years until 1888. The second Brookline High School location was a newly constructed two-story building on School Street designed by architect Joseph L. Richard that opened on November 3, 1856. The third and present location of Brookline High School was Shailer Hall a new three and a half story brick structure with a pitched roof designed by architects Andrews, Jaques and Rantoul which opened in Fall, 1895. The Manual Arts building was built at a cost of $100,000 on Tappan Street, and opened in September, 1903. The ninth grade moved from the School of Practical Arts in the elementary schools to the high school in September 1921. An addition to the main building was finished at that time to increase the capacity to 1500 students. The main building was expanded and remodeled in 1965 with a budget of $1.5 million.

They were met by dozens of supporters and counter-protesters. Members from the Westboro Baptist Church protested again in 2009. They were met with about 2,000 counter-protesters, including students and members of Brookline High School's staff and PTO, and various other groups from surrounding areas. Surrounded and barricaded by police and deans of Brookline High School, the 'silent, not violent' counter-protest (organized by the school's GSA) took place with no altercations between the two groups.
