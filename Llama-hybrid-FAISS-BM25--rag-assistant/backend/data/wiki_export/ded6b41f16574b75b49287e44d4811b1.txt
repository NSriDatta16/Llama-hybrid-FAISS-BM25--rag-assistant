(Helen) Diane Glancy (March 18, 1941) is an American poet, author, and playwright.

Life and career
Glancy was born in Kansas City, Missouri, to a father who she identified as being of Cherokee descent but who was not enrolled, Lewis H. Hall, and an English-German-American mother. At a young age, she had a hard time with determining her identity because of how her lifestyle did not relate to what she was learning in school. Glancy decided to embrace a Cherokee identity and found it easy to express in her poetry. She received her Bachelor of Arts (English literature) from the University of Missouri in 1964, then later continued her education at the University of Central Oklahoma, earning a Master's degree in English in 1983. In 1988, she received her Master of Fine Arts from the University of Iowa.

Glancy is an English professor and began teaching in 1989 at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota, teaching Native American literature and creative writing courses. Glancy's literary works have been recognized and highlighted at Michigan State University in their Michigan Writers Series.
