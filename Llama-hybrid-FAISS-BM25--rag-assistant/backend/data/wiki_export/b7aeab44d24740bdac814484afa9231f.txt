Granite Park Chalet is located in the heart of Glacier National Park in the U.S. state of Montana at an elevation of 6,693 feet above sea level. The chalet was built in 1914 by the Great Northern Railway and is a National Historic Landmark contributing property, being one of five structures in the 
Great Northern Railway Buildings district. From Logan Pass along the Going-to-the-Sun Road, the chalet is a moderate  hike along the famed Crown of the Continent Highline Trail, usually referred to simply as the Highline Trail. Much of the trail passes through the scenic Garden Wall section of the park, immediately west and parallel to the Continental Divide.  The chalet is also accessible via the Loop Trail (,  elevation gain) and the Swiftcurrent Trail (,  elevation gain).  The trails are for hikers and horseback riders only; no vehicle access is provided.  Granite Park Chalet is a limited services facility and those that spend the night make use of the full service kitchen to cook their own meals.
