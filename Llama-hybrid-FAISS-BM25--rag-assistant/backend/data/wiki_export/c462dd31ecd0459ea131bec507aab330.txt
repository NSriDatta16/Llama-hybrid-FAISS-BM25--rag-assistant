Set on a sandy bay, the resort is relaxed and informal. There are three beaches within easy reach, and all have been awarded the Blue Flag Award.

The Main beach in front of the resort is a long wide stretch of sand with sunbathing and water sports. Sun beds and umbrellas are available for rent. Boat trips that tour the nearby coastline depart from the main harbour, serving lunch and afternoon tea on board. Along the length of the beach are cafes, bars and restaurants.

The Second beach area is just to the east of Main beach and Third Beach is to the west. Just beyond Third beach is Didim marina, currently one of the largest in Turkey which opened in September 2009 and has space for 1200 boats. There are café bars and restaurants within the marina.

The main temple was built in the 8th century B.C., was surrounded by columns at the beginning of the 6th century B.C. and completed around 550 B.C.

Miletos and Ephesus is a short drive away, and also Meryemana - said to be the Virgin Mary's last home. Many pilgrims visit this place every year.

On the grounds of the Apollo Temple is a stone head of the gargoyle Medusa.

A road leading to a small harbour was lined with ancient statues, but they were taken to the British Museum in 1858.
