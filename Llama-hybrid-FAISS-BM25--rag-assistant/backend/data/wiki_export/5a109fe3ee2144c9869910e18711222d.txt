Anadolu Isuzu (officially Anadolu Isuzu Automotive Industry & Trading A.Ş.) is a joint venture company based in Istanbul, Turkey. It is the collaboration between Anadolu Group, Isuzu Motors Co., Ltd., Itochu Co. and HICOM. Its main fields of operation are the production and marketing of light duty trucks and midibuses. Since the establishment of the company in 1984, more than 80,000 commercial vehicles have been produced in accordance with the Isuzu Motors license agreement. Anadolu Isuzu is the first Turco-Japanese joint venture in the automotive sector.

The experience and know-how of Anadolu Isuzu dates back to the Çelik Montaj, which was established in 1965 to build pick-ups and motorcycles. The company continued to produce Škoda pickups until the end of 1986. In 1984, the company started to produce Isuzu vehicles in Istanbul Kartal Plants.

In 1999 Anadolu Isuzu has moved to the new Gebze Şekerpınar facilities, in the Çayırova district of Kocaeli Province. The new facilities were established over a land of 230,000 m2 where the company employs nearly 750 people. The facilities include two separate plants for truck and bus manufacturing. The midibus manufacturing plant alone covers an area of 21,750 m2 and has a production capacity of 4,000 midibuses per year.

Since 1984 more than 80,000 Isuzu vehicles have been produced in Kartal and Sekerpinar facilities. Nearly 100,000 Isuzu vehicles have been sold in the local market. In the last decade, nearly 7,000 vehicles produced in Anadolu Isuzu facilities have been exported.
