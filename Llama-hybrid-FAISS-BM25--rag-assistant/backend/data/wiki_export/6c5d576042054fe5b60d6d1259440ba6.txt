The tympanic canaliculus (also tympanic canal, inferior tympanic canaliculus, temporal canaliculus, or Jacobson canal) is a minute canal in the bony wedge/ridge that separates the carotid canal and jugular foramen/jugular fossa. The proximal opening of the canal is situated upon the inferior surface of the petrous part of the temporal bone; its distal opening is situated upon the floor of the tympanic cavity. The canal gives passage to the tympanic nerve i.e. tympanic branch of glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX)), and inferior tympanic artery.
