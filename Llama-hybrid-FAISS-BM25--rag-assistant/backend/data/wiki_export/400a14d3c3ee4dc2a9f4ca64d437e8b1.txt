Situation

Shahreza is located 508 km south to Tehran and about 80 km south west to Isfahan and Zard Kooh mountain chain runs from north-west to south-east of the city, enjoying a cold climate.  It is an old city which was first named Qomsheh, but later on its name was changed to Shahreza due to the existence there of the shrine of Shahreza.  The most important tourist attractions are:  Mahyar caravanserai, Shah Reza caravanserai, the Shah Ghandab caves, located south-east of Shahreza, the Poodeh mosque, and Shahreza Imamzadeh. Other tourist attractions include the Amin Abad caravanserai, a Safavid Empire structure in Amin Abad, a village 42 km south of Shahreza.

Shahreza is a strategic city due to having large military bases, rail transportation system, very fertile soil, having the second largest industrial town in Iran (Razi town) and connecting the north to south.

It is interesting that a part of the old Silk Road passed through the Choghad Shahreza area.
