Disturbing tha Peace is the second compilation album released by record label Disturbing tha Peace. Artists who appear on the album include Ludacris, Bobby V, I-20 and Shawnna. This album has been certified Gold by the RIAA.

The first single from the album was "Georgia" by Ludacris and Field Mob featuring Jamie Foxx.
