"Eye of the Beholder" is a song by the American heavy metal band Metallica. It was released in October 1988, as the second single from their fourth studio album, ...And Justice for All, where it also features as track 3. The song has not been performed live in its entirety since 1989, and drummer Lars Ulrich has stated that it is his least favourite Metallica song, in part due to the alternating time signatures. "It sounds like you put a square peg in a round hole".

Background 

"Eye of the Beholder" is one of the most political Metallica songs to date. The lyrics cover political correctness and limitations on freedom of speech/freedom of expression. The chorus is in 12/8 time while the rest of the track stays in basic 4/4.

The song has not been performed live in its entirety since 1989, however it did feature as part of a medley of songs from …And Justice for All often played by the band in concert during the 1990s. One of these medley's was featured on the band's 1993 live album Live Shit: Binge & Purge. Due to Ulrich's distain for the song, it is unlikely to be played in full again.
