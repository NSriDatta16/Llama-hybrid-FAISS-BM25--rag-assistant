History
The West London Wildcats were formed in 1990 as a foundation club of the British Australian Rules Football League, now known as the AFL London division of AFL Britain.  They have played in a number of BARFL grand finals, finally winning their first premiership in 2000 against arch-rivals, the Wandsworth Demons, the team captained at the time by club stalwart, Chris Schleter.  They have since followed this up with premierships in 2004, 2005 and 2006 all against BARFL heavy-weights the Wimbledon Hawks. 2004 saw fullback Rowan Bilkey captain the club. Chris Schleter again captained the premiers in 2005 while in 2006 Ruckman and Barclay Dixon lead his team to the BARFL premiership. The Wildcats stand as the only team to win the BARFL Premiership on three consecutive occasions. In 2004 the team achieved another first in BARFL history by claiming the BARFL 'Grand Slam', winning the Anzac Cup preseason tournament, the Brit Cup and both the Conference and Premier Division Premierships, a feat they repeated in season 2006.

The Wildcats also field a second team, the Shepherds Bush Raiders, in the AFL London Conference competition,  and a third side, the Ealing Emus in the AFL London Social division. The Shepherds Bush Raiders have won all but 4 of the 22 Conference premierships since the competition's inception in 2001.

The West London Wildcats celebrated 25 years of existence in 2014. Capping off a fine year by winning the premiership in all 3 grades and securing a berth in the inaugural Champions League tournament held In Amsterdam. They went on to win this title in 2015 and have followed up with victories in 2016, 2017 & 2018. The Wildcats also competed in the Champions League in 2019, and were due to compete in the COVID cancelled 2020 edition. For the first time in Wildcats history, both Men's and Women's teams will compete in the 2023 tournament as champions of London.

In season 2017, the Wildcats had their inaugural women's AFL team playing in the AFL London Conference Women's division, winning the premiership against the Wandsworth Demons. Due to an influx of interest from women wanting to play the great game, in 2018, the club expanded its women's team to two teams and now competes in the Premier and Conference division. In 2022, the Wildcats Women won the club's first premiership division premiership, bouncing back from defeat in the 2021 Grand Final.

In addition to Australian Rules Football, the Wildkittens netball sides play in a number of competitions across London.

Former Brisbane Bears player Rudi Frigo, recruited to the club by Justin "Dogga" Shannon, is probably the Wildcats best known player.
