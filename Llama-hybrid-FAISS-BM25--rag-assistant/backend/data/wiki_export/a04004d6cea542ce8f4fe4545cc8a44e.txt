Queen Kong is a 1976 British-German adventure comedy film parodying King Kong. The film was never released theatrically in the United Kingdom, due to legal action by Dino De Laurentiis, producer of the 1976 King Kong remake and RKO, the copyright holder of King Kong at the time.  It got a limited release in Italy and Germany. The film has since resurfaced on DVD.

The film has a cult following in Japan. In 1998, a troupe of Japanese comedians produced their own Japanese dialogue for the film, in a similar spirit to Woody Allen's What's Up, Tiger Lily?; this version with the new Japanese dialogue was released on DVD in 2001. The film was novelized by James Moffat and published by Everest Books in 1977.

It was shot at Shepperton Studios and on location around London and Newhaven. In addition, miniature sets were created. They utilised the scale model of London at the now long-defunct Bournemouth theme park Tucktonia.

Plot
This film switches the traditional roles of females and males and reverses the sexes of the original cast of King Kong. The main character Ray Fay plays the damsel in distress, which tends to usually be played by women. He is kidnapped by film director Luce Habit to star in her new African jungle movie. He then finds himself the attraction of an amorous giant female gorilla that pursues him across London.
