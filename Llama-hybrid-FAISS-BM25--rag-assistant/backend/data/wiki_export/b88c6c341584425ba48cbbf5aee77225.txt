He is the cousin of screenwriter Tom Mankiewicz and filmmaker/television producer Nick Davis, the grandson of screenwriter Herman J.

He attended Georgetown Day School for his primary and secondary education and received his undergraduate degree from Tufts University. In 1992, he received a Master of Science degree from Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism with an emphasis in broadcast journalism.

Mankiewicz began his career as a reporter and an anchor for WCSC-TV (a CBS affiliate) in Charleston, South Carolina. He joined WAMI in Miami, Florida, in 1998, where he served as anchor of The Times, a daily news magazine show and the station's highlight program.

Since 2003, Mankiewicz has been a host of Turner Classic Movies. When he made his debut on TCM, he became the second host hired in the network's history (Robert Osborne being the first).
