Liverpool stores

History
Liverpool, first called The Cloth Case, was founded in 1847 by Jean Baptiste Ebrard, a Frenchman who first started selling clothes in cases in Downtown Mexico City. In 1872, he started importing merchandise from Europe .  Much of the merchandise was shipped via Liverpool, England, prompting Ebrard to adopt the name Liverpool for his store, in 1862 he opened its second store and since then it has continued growing .

Liverpool Interlomas Store

In 2011, Liverpool opened a high-profile store at Paseo Interlomas, in the Interlomas, a major upscale suburban residential and business center in Greater Mexico City. The structure was designed by Rojkind Arquitectos. This three-story structure, dubbed the OVNI (UFO) for its distinctive metallic oval look, is clad in a double-layered stainless steel surface fabricated by Zahner. The 30,000m2 department store includes a rooftop recreational park.  Several design firms were involved in various aspects of the project. The interiors were done by American architecture and design firm FRCH Design Worldwide, the rooftop garden by Thomas Balsley and the gourmet space by JHP Design.
