Foresterhill is an area of Aberdeen, Scotland. It is the site of the city's main hospitals (Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, the Royal Aberdeen Children's Hospital and the Aberdeen Maternity Hospital), as well as the medical school and medical science departments of the University of Aberdeen. It is the largest hospital complex in Europe.

Foresterhill is situated at the highest point in the city, a site identified by Professor Matthew Hay in 1900. He had the vision of an integrated medical campus, with a combined hospital and medical school for the City of Aberdeen.

The site has its own helicopter landing site due to the hospitals' roles as tertiary hospitals for the North of Scotland and the rurality of Grampian as a catchment area, plus this is the primary emergency hospital for the offshore industries.
