Tire Science and Technology is a quarterly peer-reviewed scientific journal that publishes original research and reviews on experimental, analytical, and computational aspects of tires. Since 1978, the Tire Society has published the journal. The current editor-in-chief is Michael Kaliske (Dresden University of Technology).

History

The journal was founded in 1973 and was originally published by a committee of the American Society for Testing and Materials until 1977, when the Tire Society was incorporated for the purpose of continuing the journal.
