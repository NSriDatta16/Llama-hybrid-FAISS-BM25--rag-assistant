History

Gogama is an Ojibway word meaning "jumping fish", likely in reference to the many fish that abound the waters of Lake Miniskawa. A native trading post was established in the area in the early 18th century.   From 1911 to 1914, the Canadian Northern Railway, was under construction through this area, now the CNR. Gogama was first settled in 1917 by Arthur L'Abbé.  The post office was opened shortly after in 1919 and since, Gogama has relied heavily on the forestry industry although tourism is starting to benefit the hamlet as well.

During the era of railway construction, Gogama was likely a place of importance for the manufacture of Axe ties. However, following that period, maintaining and upgrading the railway required a constant supply of ties. The handmade axe ties were phased out and replaced with creosote treated ties. For the most part, this development followed World War I throughout Northern Ontario. At that same time, returning soldiers came to this area looking for work.

The first mill at Gogama was established in 1919, when W.H. Poupore contracted with the Harris Tie and Timber to supply the CNR with sawn ties. The mill produced all types of merchantable timber, but specialized in tie blocks. This mill was later taken over by Poupore's brother M.J.(Joe) Poupore. As orders for ties declined contracts were secured to supply mining timber for Falconbridge. Although the original mill burned in 1936, a new mill was erected at the mouth of the Nabakwasi River, in Togo Township, north of Gogama.

Another mill at Gogama was owned by Cochrane and Laforest and operated 1919 to 1932. It was sold to Acme Timber in 1932, but not reopened. See Pineland Timber, Foleyet.

In winter 2015, the town saw two nearby train derailments within less than one month. On February 14, seven rail cars carrying crude oil derailed approximately 30 kilometres from the town, and on March 8, 35 Canadian National Railway cars derailed at a site just four kilometres from the town, spilling crude into the Makami River and igniting an oil fire that took several days to extinguish. The two incidents sparked renewed debate on the effectiveness of Canada's rail safety regulations in the wake of the Lac-Mégantic rail disaster of 2013.

Iamgold is currently in the process of obtaining permits to open the open pit Cote Gold Project.  Construction is scheduled to commence in 2019 with production starting in 2021.  Around 1,000 workers will be required during the construction phase.  Once the mine starts producing, 400-500 people will be employed. The company anticipates a 17-year lifespan for the mine with approximately 60,000 tonnes of ore production per day. The mine site will be located about 25 km southwest of Gogama and consist of an open-pit mine, tailings storage, a mill site and camp facilities.
