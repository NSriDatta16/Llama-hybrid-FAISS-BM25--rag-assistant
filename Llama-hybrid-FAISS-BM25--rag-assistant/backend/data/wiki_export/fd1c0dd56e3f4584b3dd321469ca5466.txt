History
The district's high school, originally named Arthur L. Johnson Regional High School, was constructed at a cost of $2 million by the Union County Regional High School District and included  of space for classes and other facilities, The school, which was named for a longtime county superintendent who was a leading advocate for regionalization, opened in December 1956.

Amid conflict between the constituent municipalities about financing a district described as "the highest-spending regional high school in the state" and anger from residents impacted by the closure of David Brearley High School, a referendum was held in May 1996 in which voters approved a proposal to breakup the regional district. With the district's dissolution at the end of the 1996-97 school year Arthur L. Johnson High School was turned over to the Clark Public School District, which became a K-12 district. Garwood, one of the two municipalities without a high school, established a sending/receiving relationship to send its high school students to Arthur L. Johnson.
