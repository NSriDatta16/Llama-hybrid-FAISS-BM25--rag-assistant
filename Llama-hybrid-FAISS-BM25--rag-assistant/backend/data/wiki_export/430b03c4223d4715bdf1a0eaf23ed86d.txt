Virtual reality and immersive technology
In 2015, Malicki-Sanchez founded VRTO – a Toronto-based virtual and augmented reality meetup whose inaugural event was held at Ryerson University's Student Learning Center, and Transportive Technology – a virtual-reality content production company which saw Malicki-Sanchez teaming up with Lee Towndrow to create one of the world's first 360 ASMR Immersive videos. This led to the creation of FIVARS, the "Festival of International Virtual and Augmented Reality Stories" which he co-organized with technical director Joseph Ellsworth.

FIVARS debuted at Toronto's Camp Wavelength music festival, and showed the first full viewing of MansLaughter by Cinemersia, which claims to be the world's first virtual reality feature film. FIVARS had its inaugural show in Toronto on 19 and 20 September 2015. The second FIVARS, which was September 16–18, 2016, was at MSMU Studios – a 5,000 square-foot Toronto warehouse redesigned for the festival.
