Union of Cinema Production Workers () was an autonomous (non-"charro"-led) Mexican trade union.  It was formed in 1944 after splitting off from the CTM-affiliated Union of Cinema Industry Workers (Sindicato de Trabajadores de la Industria Cinematogr√°fica, (STIC)).  Mario Moreno "Cantinflas" served as its first secretary general.
