Wakefield Trinity Wildcats
McNamara was released from the Bradford Bulls in 2000 and joined Wakefield Trinity Wildcats (captain). In 2000, at the height of a financial crisis at Wakefield Trinity Wildcats, the contracts of all players aged over 24 were terminated during September 2000. The players affected were; Andy Fisher, Bobbie Goulding, Warren Jowitt, Tony Kemp (player-coach), Steve McNamara, Francis Maloney, Martin Masella, Steve Prescott, Bright Sodje, Francis Stephenson and Glen Tomlinson.

McNamara joined the Huddersfield Giants before joining the coaching staff at Bradford Bulls at the end of the 2003's Super League VIII.

Coaching career
He coached the Bradford Bulls' Senior Academy to Grand Final success in his first year as a coach at the club.

On 20 April 2006 Steve was promoted to head coach of Bradford Bulls following Brian Noble's departure to Wigan Warriors. At the time he was the youngest coach in Britain.

In his first season in charge, he guided the Bradford Bulls to the Super League playoffs before the club were knocked out of the grand final eliminator by Hull FC.

McNamara was appointed Great Britain assistant coach on 30 April 2007.

His coaching career while at the Bradford Bulls contains several unwanted records, such as being the first Bradford Bulls coach in Super League to fail to guide his team to the end of season play-offs and being in charge for the worst losing streak the club has seen in 20 years.

Bradford Bulls fans became increasingly frustrated with his team's lacklustre performances since taking over the reins in 2006 and following defeat by Harlequins RL (the 8th defeat in a row, the Bradford Bulls worst run in Super League history). His time as Bradford Bulls head coach came to an end on 13 July 2010 as the Bradford Bulls board ended his contract by mutual consent and allowed him to become full-time England coach.

As of April 2010 he was part-time England coach until the end of the 2010 Super League season. He became full-time England coach afterwards. He won his first game as England coach against France 60â€“6. This game was played at the Leigh Sporting Village on Saturday 12 June 2010.

He coached England to the 2013 Rugby League World Cup semi-final.

On 12 December 2013, McNamara was appointed the assistant coach of the 2013 National Rugby League (NRL) premiers the Sydney Roosters. The Sydney Roosters head coach Trent Robinson was looking for a new assistant coach because his previous assistant Paul Green took up the head coaching position of the North Queensland Cowboys.

He joined the New Zealand Warriors for the 2017 season.

He coached Catalans to the 2018 Challenge Cup Final victory over the Warrington Wolves at Wembley Stadium.

In the 2021 Super League season, McNamara guided Catalans to their first ever League Leaders Shield and first ever Grand Final.  McNamara was also named Super League's coach of the year.  On 9 October 2021, McNamara coached Catalans in their 2021 Super League Grand Final defeat against St. Helens.
On 14 October 2023, McNamara coached Catalans in their 2023 Super League Grand Final loss against Wigan. Catalans became the first team since the Super League era began in 1996 to not score a try in the final.
