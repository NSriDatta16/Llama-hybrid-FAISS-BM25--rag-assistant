Its name is taken in conjunction with its shape like a coconut shell. The length of this cave reaches 1.9 km and is believed to have existed since 8000 BC.

The Tempurung Cave consists of five large domes whose ceilings resemble coconut shells, with each dome having a different stalagmite and stalactite shape. Additionally, each dome is different in terms of temperature, water level, and limestone and marble content.
