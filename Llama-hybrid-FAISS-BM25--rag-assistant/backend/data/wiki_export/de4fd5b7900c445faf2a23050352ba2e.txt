Stories

Serial
The first of the major CSI: Crime Scene Investigation stories, Serial deals with Gil Grissom and his team tracking a violent serial killer. The killer is copy-catting history's most infamous murderer – Jack the Ripper, killing Las Vegas prostitutes. To complicate matters for the team, the murderer is striking during the Ripper Mania Festival in Las Vegas, a convention for Jack the Ripper case enthusiasts. The producers of the festival attempt to work with the police.

Dying in the Gutters
The story revolves around the (fictional) murder of Rich Johnston who writes a gossip column for Comic Book Resources called "Lying in the Gutters". Due to his notoriety and the fact that this takes place at a comics convention there is a long list of comic book luminaries among the suspects.

Intern At Your Own Risk
15-year-old Kiyomi Hudson is one of five teens—and the lone girl—chosen for internship in Las Vegas' CSI Division under the tutelage of Gil Grissom and Catherine Willows. Little does she know that her first "case" concerns another brutally murdered teenage girl, and that one of her fellow interns may know more than he's letting on.
