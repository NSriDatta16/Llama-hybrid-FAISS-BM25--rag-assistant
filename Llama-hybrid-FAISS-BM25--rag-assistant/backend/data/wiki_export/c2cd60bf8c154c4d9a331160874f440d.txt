"Remember the Name" is a song by Fort Minor, the hip hop side project of rock band Linkin Park's co-lead vocalist Mike Shinoda. It is the second single from his 2005 album The Rising Tied and features underground hip hop band Styles of Beyond. It was released alongside the album's first single, "Petrified". A music video for the song was directed by Kimo Proudfoot.

The single initially failed to chart in 2005. However, in 2006, the single received moderate success due to its use in the media and possibly the success of "Where'd You Go", another Fort Minor single. Despite numerous low peaks in different charts, the song was used extensively in the media, particularly at sports events, and eventually received a Platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America in 2009 and a Gold certification by the British Phonographic Industry in 2021. In 2018 the RIAA certified the song 4Ã— Platinum.

Background
David Campbell conducted the strings for the song. Since Shinoda performed the main loop on the keyboards, the cellists had a difficult time performing the loop. Eventually, they resorted to breaking up the phrase, such that each cellist plays one or two notes.

Music video
The music video, directed by Kimo Proudfoot, shows the song's three vocalists, Mike Shinoda and hip-hop group Styles of Beyond  members Takbir Bashir and Ryan Maginn, walking around a bar. The video has cameo appearances from Chester Bennington, Brad Delson, and Rob Bourdon of Linkin Park, singer Holly Brook, Rob Dyrdek and Christopher "Big Black" Boykin of MTV's Rob & Big, DJ Cheapshot and Vin Skully of Styles of Beyond, and rapper Sixx John.
