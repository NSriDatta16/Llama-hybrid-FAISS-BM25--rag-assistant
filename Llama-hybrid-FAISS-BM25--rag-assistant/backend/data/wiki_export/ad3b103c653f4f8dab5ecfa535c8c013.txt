History

The Humble Beginning (1941-1953) 
Before the establishment of Al-Ettifaq as a professional sports clubs that also managing football, there were three clubs in the city Dammam that were founded in 1941. Al-Taawoun (different from Al-Taawoun from Buraydah city), Al-Sha'ab and Al-Shabab. These clubs began practising their own sporting activities and gathering the people across the region, however these clubs are hardly gaining any revenue for the sport activity to continue. 

4 years later in 1945, the presidents of the club and its staff met in Faris Al-Hamid's house, the ministry of sport at the time. They discuss the solution for their problem, the result of this meeting are to merge all three clubs in Dammam into one single unified club. The ministry will fund the newly merged club and get its share of ownership. Al-Hamid also suggested at the time to name the new club as "Al-Ettifaq" (الاتفاق al-ittifāq), which meant "the agreement" in Arabic. 

The club original color will also changed, the new colors would be green and white, which eventually changed into green and red afterwards. Sometimes later Mohammed Hassan Khairi from Sudan become the new club manager. In the early years of the Club, the energetic and ambitious coach from Africa start to reform the sport club from Dammam

First King Cup and Crown Prince Cup (1954-1971) 
Al-Ettifaq saw some success in the domestic championship of 1960's. One of his most decisive decision are to signed the most profilic Ettifaqi player Khalil Al-Zayani. In 1962, the senior team new player wingback/centerback (defence) are just 15 years old boy barely graduating from youth team Academy. The young Zayani have to adjust between his education and professional football career. At the time nationwide football league are not yet implemented and regional league and tournament occasionally held. Nevertheless the manager intuition to entrust club defense role to the young boy prove correct, when the club for the first time managed to overcome their adversities and reach the final in 1963 Crown Prince Cup. 

Al-Ettifaq face their final opponent in the national tournament, Al-Ittihad in their homeground (Jeddah). Loud cheers echoes from the opposing supporters after Al-Ettifaq defeated 6-2. The club run for 1963 King Cup is less succesful from their Crown Prince Run. 1963-1964 Saudi Season end with Al-Ittihad securing their double title again after defeating their rival Al-Hilal.

The young boy talent are tested once again in 1964-1965 Saudi footbal season, when barely 16 years old defender are selected by Khairi as the captain squad. The manager recognize his vision prowess in the field and charisma. Khairi encourage the squad to aim high for the new record, he wanted for his coached player to raise occasional Regional League cup, King Cup and Crown Prince Cup at the same time or as we know as "treble". 

The now fully matured 17 years old Defender captain walk his first step to become nation football champion, when he secured his club back at the final match Crown Prince Cup against Al-Ittihad at the same pitch. The deafening voice of Ittihad supporter become silence as his club taking revenge for the crushing defeat almost 3 years earlier. The sport club from Dammam lift their first ever trophy with triumph. However Ettifaq failed to win the King Cup on that season in which Al-Ahli from the same city as Al-Ittihad went victorious.  

In 1964-1965 Saudi Season even though Ettifaq won a national trophy, they fall short to achieve their treble goal. Meanwhile for the young Zayani, around this time he is scouted to be part of Saudi National Team. Some of Ettifaq player also constitute part of the Eastern Team who compete under Crown Prince Cup new regulation and they managed to reach final in 1966-1967 Saudi Season.  

On 1966 King Cup, in the final Al Ettifaq defeated by Al-Wehda and in 1967 King Cup, tasted defeat again by Al-Ittihad. For the third times in a row reaching final, Al-Ettifaq finally raise their first ever King Cup after defeating the defending champion in previous tournament. On the next seasons however, Al-Ettifaq defeated by new challanger and Al-Ahli become the winner of King Cup in that season. Hassan Khairi retired from the club activity after coaching Ettifaqi player for over 1 decade.   

Al-Zayani keep playing as the club player until 1971 and retired from Saudi National Team in 1973, completely retiring from football the age of just 26 years old. In his career he managed to reach 5 finals in different competition and win 2 trophies for his club. Khalil Al-Zayani played his entire club career for Al-Ettifaq.

Champion from Dammam (1972-1989)

Sharp Decline in 1970s 
After Khairi and Zayani departure, Al-Ettifaq never the reach the final of national tournament. Slowly the condition inside the club become worrisome, Saudi Ministry of Sport then offer the 29 years old retired ex-player, to coach the club and also prepare the club for implementation of planned national league. Al-Ettifaq would be main representation from the city of Dammam. 

Zayani agree to step up and took managerial role. At this time nationwide league are newly established with 8 clubs registered. Al-Ettifaq only elligible to play in second-tier of the Saudi League, First Division League and only able to make into 2nd place just behind Al-Nahda. The winner and runner-up at that time are promoted into Saudi Premier League. 

Al-Ettifaq are promoted in the second edition of the league in 1977-1978 Saudi Premier League. In their first run in highest tier of league national, Al-Ettifaq finish 3rd place behind Al-Nassr in 2nd place and Al-Hilal as league champion. In the 1978-1979, Al Ettifaq finish in 6th position, 1979-1980 they finish again the same position and in 1981-1982 Ettifaqi finish in 5th position. In this period the club never won any singgle competition for over a decade except for getting promotion into Saudi Premier League. 

Regardless of the setbacks, Zayani still confident to continue his predecessor ambition to secure the treble for club. The former defender began to implemented new tactics and shaping new core player, once the majority squad from 1970s started to retiring. His new winning strategy are applied by promising academy players promoted from the youth teams.
