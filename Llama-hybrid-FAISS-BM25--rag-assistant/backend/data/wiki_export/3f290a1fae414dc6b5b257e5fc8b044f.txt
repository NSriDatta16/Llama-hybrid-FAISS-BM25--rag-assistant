Caudebec-lès-Elbeuf (, literally Caudebec near Elbeuf) is a commune in the Seine-Maritime department in the Normandy region in northern France.

Geography
A residential and light industrial town situated by the banks of the river Seine, some  south of Rouen, at the junction of the D919 and the D921 roads.

It used to be the site of the Caudebec bore, or tidal wave, which several times a year rushed up the river from the sea. However the tidal estuary was changed to improve shipping access and the bore ceased to function.
