Quickborn () is a rich and affluent town in the district of Pinneberg, in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. It belongs to Metropolregion Hamburg  and is located on the north part of Hamburg on Autobahn A7. It is a 700 year old town which also belonged to Denmark in the past.

Connectivity
Quickborn is located about 18 km north from the centre of Hamburg, on the eastern edge of Kreis Pinneberg. It lies on the A7 between Hamburg and Neumünster. It is situated just 6 km from the Hamburg Airport. Quickborn is also located along the Hamburg-Altona–Neumünster railway, which connects it to the AKN railway and buses of the Hamburger Verkehrsverbund.  The S bahn train is coming in 2025 to Quickborn which will connect it directly to the main train station at Hamburg Hauptbahnhof without any change of trains. This is going to be a big boost in Quickborn‘s connectivity as well as ambitious plan for saving Co2.

Geography
Northwest of Quickborn is the Himmelmoor, the largest raised bog in Schleswig-Holstein, which is about 605 hectares large. It has long been used for  peat mining. For this purpose, a narrow-gauge railway was built through the bog. South of the city is the Holmmoor, a nature preserve that is about 110 ha. large.
