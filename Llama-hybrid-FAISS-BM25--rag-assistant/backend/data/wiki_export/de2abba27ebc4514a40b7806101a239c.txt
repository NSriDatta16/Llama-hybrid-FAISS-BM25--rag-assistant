In 1978 he was traded to the A's along with Elias Sosa and Mike Edwards for Manny Sanguillen.  He stole 56 bases during his 2 years in Oakland.  After splitting his 1979 season between the Oakland Athletics and Chicago Cubs, Miguel landed in with the Cleveland Indians in 1980 where he had the best years of his career.  1980 was his career season. Batting .341, he had 180 hits, 30 doubles, 9 triples and 61 stolen bases. During his 4 years with the Indians, he stole 128 bases, hitting .289.  Toward the end of the 1983 season, the Indians traded him to the Chicago White Sox for Rich Barnes, who 7 days later traded him back to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Randy Niemann. After finishing the 1983 season with the Pirates, Miguel signed with the Montreal Expos as a free agent.  Miguel played the 1984 season and part of 1985 with the Expos before being released and signing with the San Diego Padres to finish up the 1985 season and his major league career.
