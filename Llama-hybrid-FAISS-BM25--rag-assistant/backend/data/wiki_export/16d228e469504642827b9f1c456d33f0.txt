Les Cousins Branchaud are a traditional folk group from Sainte-Ursule, Quebec. The group is known for their energy on stage as they put their own spin on old classiques and original traditional-style songs.

History 
The group was formed in the early 90s by Claude Branchaud (Mandolin, Vocals), Guy Branchaud (Guitar, Vocals) and Luc Croisetière (Percussion, Vocals) to raise money for the Make a Wish Foundation. 
In the fall of 1994 Paul-André Nadeau (Violinist, Guitarist, Vocals) joined the group.  After playing at many volunteer and folk shows they gradually established their name in the region. 
In 1997 Patrick Desmarais joined the group and brought along his instrumental skill with the accordion, harmonica, rebec and vocals.

In 2000, Les Cousins Branchaud produced their first album, Swing la don' dans ton salon, which includes songs that are traditional within the families of each member.

In 2001 David Tavares (Bass, Guitar, Vocals) joined the group leaving it at its current six members.

In 2002, by public demand, they produced a second album, Lorsque le verre est plein, which includes, once again, traditional family folk songs.

In 2003, Les Cousins Branchaud were part of a compilation album which also included other traditional québécois folk groups such as La Bottine Souriante, La Volée d’Castors, Baqqhus, Les Charbonniers de l’enfer and several others.

In 2004, again due to public demand, they put out their third album, Equipé pour veiller tard.

2007 was a big year for Les Cousins Branchaud, as they produced their fourth album, Passer du bon temps, and were invited for the first time to play at the World Folk Festival in Drummondville.
