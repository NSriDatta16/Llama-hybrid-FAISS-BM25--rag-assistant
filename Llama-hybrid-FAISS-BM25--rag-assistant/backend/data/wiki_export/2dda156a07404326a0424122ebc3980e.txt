Miran Pavlin (born 8 October 1971) is a Slovenian former professional footballer who played as midfielder. He featured for clubs such as Olimpija, SC Freiburg, Olympiakos Nicosia, APOEL, FC Porto and Olimpija Ljubljana.

Club career
In 2009, Pavlin joined FC Koper on a combined player-director of football contract. In his first season with Koper, he won the Slovenian PrvaLiga. His second season there started poorly – after a resounding 5–1 defeat away to Dinamo Zagreb in UEFA Champions League qualifiers, he announced his immediate retirement, only to return to the Koper team a week later for a single league match against Rudar Velenje. Soon, after another dispute with club leadership regarding player signings and departures, he left the club altogether.

International career
Pavlin made 63 appearances for the senior Slovenia national team between 1994 and 2004. He was a participant at the 2002 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2000. During the second leg of Slovenia's Euro 2000 play-off against Ukraine, it was Pavlin's goal which secured a 1–1 draw and an aggregate victory to send Slovenia to their first major tournament.

Personal life
Luka Pavlin, who is also a footballer, is his nephew.
