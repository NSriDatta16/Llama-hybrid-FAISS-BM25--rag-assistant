London Buses route 36 is a Transport for London contracted bus route in London, England. Running between New Cross bus garage and Queen's Park station, it is operated by London Central.

History

Route 36 dates back to 1911 when London General Omnibus Company commenced operating between Queens Park and Victoria. By 1934 it had been extended to Hither Green.

On 24 August 1961, a gun and five boxes of ammunition were found under the rear seat of a 36A bus in Peckham garage. The gun was identified as that used to kill Michael Gregsten and wound Valerie Storie in the 'A6 murder case', for which James Hanratty was hanged.

The 36B was cut back to Peckham and renumbered route 136 in March 1994.

On 29 January 2005, route 36 was converted to one man operation with the AEC Routemasters replaced by Plaxton President bodied Volvo B7TLs.

Present day
It is one of very few routes still to cross central London, carrying people in to the centre from both ends of the route.

On 9 February 2013, London Central retained the contract for route 36 with new and existing Alexander Dennis Enviro400s. It is operated out of New Cross garage.
