Carlos Païta (10 March 1932 – 19 December 2015) was an Argentine conductor. He was born in Buenos Aires.

His father was originally from Hungary, his mother was a singer from Italy. At a young age, Païta attended rehearsals by Wilhelm Furtwängler at the Teatro Colón.  Later he studied conducting with Artur Rodziński.  He started his professional career at the Colón Theater in Buenos Aires.  He first conducted the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra in 1966 and moved permanently to Europe in 1968. He made his US debut with the Houston Symphony Orchestra in 1979.  As of 2003, he was resident in Geneva.
 
Paita was awarded the Grand Prix du Disque for his 1968 recording on the London Records - Phase 4 Stereo Concert Series album A Wagner Festival.  This LP featured selections from Tristan und Isolde, The Flying Dutchman and Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg.

He was also awarded the Grand Prix du Disque for his 1978 LP recording of Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique with the London Symphony Orchestra.

He is largely noted for a series of recordings issued on his own Lodia Records label. As of 2006, this label went out of business; these records are highly sought-after collectors’ items. 

He died in Geneva, Switzerland on 19 December 2015 at the age of 83.
