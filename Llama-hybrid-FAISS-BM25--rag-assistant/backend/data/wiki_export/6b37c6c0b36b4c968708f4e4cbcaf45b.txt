History
Central Park was developed by the Silver Companies.  (Carl D. Silver Parkway, the primary road through Central Park, is named after the founder and owner of the Silver Companies.)  Before the complex was developed, the site was occupied by a Sheraton Hotel and a golf course.  The complex was begun in 1995, and is still expanding and growing.  Central Park is now a  power center. It serves as the retail shopping and primary dining component of the  mega-development Celebrate Virginia, which uses the slogan "North America's Largest Retail Resort" and spans Stafford County, the Rappahannock River, and the City of Fredericksburg. Across Route 3 from Central Park is the older Spotsylvania Mall, which has undergone extensive renovation to become the Spotsylvania Towne Centre.

In June 2020, Chuck E. Cheese announced that this location will be permanently closed as a part of a plan to close 34 locations nationwide due to bankruptcy. However in July 2021, it reopened.

On January 10, 2023, it was announced that buybuyBABY would be closing as part of a plan to close 62 stores nationwide from its parent company, Bed Bath & Beyond.

Criticism
Many area residents complain that the developers did not make adequate allowances for the increase in traffic caused by the complex. Residents and travelers in the area are often frustrated by the congestion along the Route 3 corridor near the Interstate 95 interchange.
