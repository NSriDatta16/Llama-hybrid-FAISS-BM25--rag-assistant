Fear of Flying is the second studio album by American singer-songwriter Mya, released on April 25, 2000, by University Music Entertainment and Interscope Records. Following the success of her debut album Mya (1998), Interscope promptly allocated the singer studio time and assembled recording sessions beginning as early as September 1999 which concluded in March 2000. For this record, Mya made the conscious decision to become involved more creatively, opting to pen her own lyrics after securing a publishing deal to launch her own publishing company as well as collaborate with a wider range of established producers and songwriters on the album. Looking to embrace a more mature sound, Harrison consulted and collaborated with a bevy of producers which included Rodney Jerkins, Swizz Beatz, Wyclef Jean, Knobody, Robin Thicke, Tricky Stewart, and Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis.

A hip hop soul album, Mya described Fear of Flying as a metaphor for the ups and downs of life, a theme present throughout the album which includes handling things like an adult and knowing you must have faith to make anything happen. Lyrically, the album's material addressed the singer's romantic relationships which symbolized her relationship with family, friends and acquaintances. Noting that Fear of Flying is "a reflection of being in love for the very first time, experiencing success and the fears of fame."

Upon its release, the album received mixed reviews from music critics citing some of the album's "tepid material." Commercially well received, Fear of Flying debuted with a Top 20 placement at number 15 on the Billboard 200. Initially though, the album stalled on the charts until the release of the album's second single and in turn solidified Fear of Flying a hit garnering multiplatinum success. To keep the album's momentum, nearly seven months after its original release, Fear of Flying was re–released with two new additional songs on November 7, 2000.

In support of the album, three singles were released – "The Best of Me", "Case of the Ex", and "Free", which attained international chart success. Due to the album's success, Fear of Flying earned Soul Train Awards and MOBO nominations.

Considered her most expressive effort to date, Fear of Flying helped established Mya as a household name in mainstream media and redefine a golden age for R&B. In April 2020, to commemorate the album's twentieth anniversary, Universal Music Group released an expanded edition featuring over 10 rare remixes and bonus tracks.

Background

Following the commercial success of her debut Mya (1998), Mya quickly re-entered the recording studio to begin work on her second album. During her two years away, she toured with several artists, and made her film debut in the thriller In Too Deep (1999). Additionally, she was selected by Bongo jeans as their spokesperson and had a Tommy Hilfiger lipstick shade named after her. During the development stages of the album, Mya consulted several different producers for her follow-up album, including She'kspere, Knobody, Tricky Stewart, and Robin Thicke as well as Wyclef and Swizz Beatz of Ruff Ryders. A number of guest vocalists whom contributed to the project, included TLC's Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes, Jordan Knight, and Beenie Man. In addition, Harrison launched her own publishing company, Art of War.

Mya, who did some writing on her debut album, was heavily involved in the production of Fear of Flying, commenting: "I wanted to get that hands-on experience. I was involved in every single process, from writing and recording to producing, mixing, and mastering." In response to the album's material, the singer commented that many of the album's songs are about female empowerment. "I'm learning that the decisions being made ultimately affect me, so I make most of them with the insight and help of other people", she explained. "I still have to focus on what feels good to me and what's going to work in the long run, instead of selling 20 million records or being controversial." The album's title, came from a song Mya recorded by the same name—not from Erica Jong's 1973 novel of the same name. During an interview with Billboard, which discussed the title, Mya noted that while she had not been aware of the book, she later "started reading it and noticed a lot of similarities: "Fear of Flying is a metaphor for the ups and downs of life. It's about handling things like an adult, knowing you must have faith to make anything happen." Interscope hired photographer and director David LaChapelle to shoot the images for the album's packaging. While she admired the work of Dave La Chapelle, Mya revealed she cropped the original album's cover because it focused on her body, commenting, "I didn't like it. It wasn't capturing."

Development
Mya considers her first album an experiment and a learning ground. Prior to entering a recording studio, she had no vocal training and was doing improv-breathing the whole time on every song. With Fear of Flying, she acknowledged she learned things such as how she likes to work and what works right for her in the studio. On Fear of Flying, she received vocal training and noted her vocals got along better with live performances. Speaking with Time, Mya revealed with Fear of Flying she took more control over her sound and image. She commented that Fear of Flying was "an opportunity and a test."
For her second studio album, Mya wrote a lot, openly admitting, "Writing helps me sort through feelings that I'm trying to figure out." She noted her journal is filled with curse words and exclamation points, explaining, "It's either extreme highs or extreme lows." In an interview with the New York Daily News, Mya explained that the album was "about independence." She acknowledged with Fear of Flying she became "more confident", while commenting, "I'm a lot more straightforward. Things I didn't know how to say or when to say, I'm saying now." 
During the recording process, Mya explained she clicked more with producers that like to start from scratch, commenting, "It allowed me to be involved in the process. They were interested in what I had to say which made me feel good about myself." One producer Mya gelled with was Wyclef Jean. Speaking on working with him, she commented, "He was interested in what I had to say. My ideas—what I had to bring to the table. He wasn't afraid to go back into the studio and change things." Robin Thicke, a then-up-and-coming producer, was another Mya meshed well with. Of his contribution to Fear of Flying Mya commented, "he is a true talent and I enjoyed working with him." While reviewing Fear of Flying, in an article, Time noted on her debut effort, Mya was a "lovestruck teen" while on Fear of Flying, "she's a woman coming face to face with romantic entanglements." With 18 tracks featured on the album, Time applauded the album to manage that rare thing: to combine captivating beats with hummable melodies. Commenting on the finished product, Time wrote, "This is hip-hop soul with plenty of pop appeal."

Music and composition
Musically, Fear of Flying has been described as a "smooth, catchy, personalized mixture of street-spice soul." According to multiple critics, the album is more focused on themes than coherency of musical style. Sonically, the album's sound veers from quiet storm tracks to hard-edged Timbaland homages to cheerleader romps. The album's focal theme is "proper behavior on the dangerous grounds of courtship" and ranges from uptempo tracks to inspirational ballads. Several of the album's 18 tracks were co-written by Mya, with Vibe magazine noting in an article that "Mýa tackles difficult melodic and rhythmic twists without ditching a nice conversational tone." Fear of Flying opens with an intro courtesy of Swizz Beatz. Titled, "Turn It Up" it features a stop-start beat and samples of a cooing baby. Next up, "Case of the Ex," a song structured around producer Tricky Stewart's "driving, Beethoven-meets-Timbaland" chord changes, where Mýa expresses distrust in her lover. It is built around a catchy yet fairly complicated chorus and clever lyrics. It is followed by the "dramatic" "Ride & Shake", which was compared to the work of Whitney Houston. The mildy racy Rodney Jerkins-produced "That's Why I Wanna Fight" is a sensuous midtempo and served as the album's fourth track. Structured, similarly to Marvin Gaye's 70s material, Harrison adopts Gaye's double singing technique. Track five, the dance-oriented imaginative "Pussycats" is a nursery rhyme-influenced song produced by Wyclef Jean and Jerry Duplessis. A frisky jam, it samples the sound of mewing cats.

The album's "combative" sixth track, "The Best of Me", was produced by Swizz Beatz, and features Jadakiss. Described as "edgy" and "street savvy," Mya commented on the message behind the song, suggesting, "It's about setting standards for yourself, about following them through and not allowing the temptations of a heat of the moment situation to lure you into something that you may regret later in life." Described as "mildy structure," the album's seventh track "Lie Detector," is another midtempo which finds Mya refusing advances. The TLC-sounding "How You Gonna Tell Me" courtesy of She'kspere and Kandi has Mya telling her girlfriend to spare her bad advice. Lyrically and conceptually, Mya opted to add her thoughts to the song, explaining, "I wanted the song to be about people preaching to me what they don't practice. About how these specific people speak to me on the way I should live and my reaction to them and their twisted lives."  While the "dance-floor-ready" "Takin' Me Over," produced by Robin Thicke featuring Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes, begins with Mya acting like the women she has expressed dislike for, while holed up in her bathroom with hair products. A catchy slice of retro soul, "Takin' Me Over" is '60s Motown meets early '00s and shows Mya in a playful coy mood. Mya dubs it her "don't give a damn song."

The lush title track, "Fear of Flying" is a folk-ish quasi ballad produced by Knobody and uses the idea of being afraid to fly as a metaphor for other issues. The Soulshock and Karlin production, "Can't Believe", and remake of Michael Jackson's "The Lady In My Life", titled "Man In My Life", are standard fare A/C broken-hearted emotional ballads, while on a romantic note, the ballad "No Tears On My Pillow" written by Mya and the song's producer Robin Thicke served as the album's fifteenth track. Followed by "For the First Time" a sexual surrender cut produced by Swing Mob member Daryl Pearson. The album's closing track, an outro, "Get Over" is a spoken word "thank you" midtempo with calypso tinge.

Release and promotion

Initially set for a late 1999 release, Fear of Flying was later scheduled for a February 2000 release, before Interscope settled on an April 25, 2000, release date. In Germany, it was released June 19, 2000, while in the United Kingdom, the album was released on July 24, 2000. Interscope hoped that the album would attract both pop and R&B/hip-hop audiences, with Steve Stoute, president of black music and executive VP for Interscope-Geffen-A&M, commenting that all marketing surrounding the album's release would "be paying attention to the street audiences with this album." He added, "We're also looking to build upon her previous success. She gained a large pop audience through 'Ghetto Supastar' and 'Take Me There.' She's also grown as an artist and her music reflects that." Promotion for Fear of Flying began in January 2000 when Mya was featured in the February issue of Vibe.

Singles
In support of the album, Interscope Records released three singles from Fear of Flying. Initially, before "The Best of Me" was chosen as the album's lead single, the song "Lie Detector" was a potential contender. The instrumental for "The Best of Me" was originally expected to be used and recorded by rapper DMX in a Miami recording session with Swizz. However, the instrumental of the song was left unused until the producer returned to New York City to start work on Mya's album at The Hit Factory. Upon accidentally pushing a button in the studio, Mya's management reportedly "jumped up and said 'That's it, that's it when they heard the song's instrumental. The record was among the last tracks recorded for the album. Jadakiss, then a member of the Ruff Ryders Entertainment's group The LOX, was chosen as the featured artist on the song as a result of label connections with Interscope Records. Released on March 6, 2000, "The Best of Me" peaked at number 50 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 14 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Internationally, the single found modest chart success, peaking at number 26 in Germany, while charting moderately in the Netherlands and Switzerland.

The second single, "Case of the Ex", was released commercially on August 28, 2000. Originally a rap song, producer Tricky Stewart heavily rearranged the track to make it fit Mya's persona. The song peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 10 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Globally, "Case of the Ex" experienced similar success, peaking at number one in Australia for two weeks and earned a platinum certification from the Australian Recording Industry Association. In the United Kingdom the song charted within the top 10 and earned a silver certification from the British Phonographic Industry. Elsewhere in Europe the song peaked within the Top 40 in The Netherlands, Belgium, Ireland, Scotland, France and Germany.

The third and final single released from the album, "Free", originally appeared on the original soundtrack to the crime comedy film Bait (2000) starring Jamie Foxx. The track was written and produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. "Free" reached number 42 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 52 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Internationally, "Free" performed even better, peaking within the top 10 in Australia. The song received a platinum certification from the Australian Recording Industry Association. Elsewhere, the song charted within the top 20 in the United Kingdom and Poland, and within the top 40 in Ireland and Scotland.

Critical reception

People named Fear of Flying their Album of the Week and called it an "unexpected treat", though commenting that "Mya offers no bold new sonic innovations. She does breathe life and sass into a genre too long held hostage by formula." In his review for AllMusic, Jon Azpiri wrote that "Mya's sophomore effort proves that she is a promising young talent, but still has yet to develop the chops necessary to rank among the best of R&B divas." He felt that "without the energy of collaborators in the mix, many of her solo tracks wander into predictability. The album relies too heavily on tepid ballads such as the title track and 'Man of My Life'. Yet songs like 'Can't Believe', "For the First Time', and 'Lie Detector' show an emotional depth that lacked in her debut." Josh Tyrangiel of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a C rating. He found that "Mýa can sing well enough; now she needs to find something to sing about." Rolling Stone magazine writer Ernest Hardy gave the album 2 stars out of 5 and wrote: "The signature quiver in Mya's voice does give her some sonic identity, but otherwise this could be the music of Destiny's Child, Aaliyah or any of the countless interchangeable hip-hop/R&B divas."

The Source magazine gave the album a positive review, writing, "reaching out to hip-hop heads [...] Mya proves she can hold her own in this competitive game of young female musicians. She's well on her way [to] the class of elite divas". Uncut called the album a "crafted, coffee-rich affair blending soul and swing [...] it's a grower which oozes class." While Q magazine rated the album 3 stars out of 5 and wrote: "Mya demonstrates enough sass to suggest a sunny future." Vibe stated that "the starlet has decided to show off her range [...] as if she and her top-notch producers attempted to wipe out the competition by transforming Mya into each of her rivals in turn [...] a grand tour through the ever-changing moods of female adolescence".

Impact and legacy
Mya have been credited with popularizing Y2K R&B. Erika Brooks Adickman of Idolator commented her music "epitomized everything that was great about turn-of-the millennium R&B." Described as sultry and futuristic, Alex Frank of Vogue applauded Harrison capabilities to "elbowed out the crunchy catchiness of Britney Spears and aggression of Kid Rock" with interesting, seductive music. With the dominant sounds of R&B production at the time, he also commended the singer for "creating something preppy and poppy and radio-friendly that kept pace with the Britneys and the N'Syncs without sacrificing experimentation." While, all in all, he characterized Mya's brand of R&B as "neo-R&B—an innovative take on a beloved genre that promised a way forward." He finished with Mya is "proof of a kind of inevitability of influence, with her sound now palpable in the music of a whole new generation of musicians who grew up on her hits."

Following its release, Fear of Flying cemented Mya place at the forefront of the genre's stars. American author Stacy-Deanne noted Fear of Flying took Mya to "new heights" and established her as a household name in mainstream media. Deanne recognized with Fear of Flying it exemplified why fans truly appreciated her music and saluted the sophomore effort as "poetic," "sexy," "passionate," and "honest sensitivity." Consequently, she expressed, Fear of Flying had succeeded in a way that the first album had not...it had "crossover appeal." In the midst of her success, Deanne opined Harrison proved herself a well rounded-performer with flexible abilities who was consistently a "source of attraction" on television and on tour. Essentially, Deanne dubbed Fear of Flying as Harrison's most expressive effort. Similarly, The Guardian lauded Fear of Flying as "a new golden age for R&B," while emphasizing Mya's "lightly melismatic vocals suited these rhythmically tricksy tales, capturing perfectly the highly charged sadness of a dead affair." In honor of their "2000 week," Billboard highlighted and included "How You Gonna Tell Me" on their 40 Best Deep Cuts of 2000 list, suggesting,"Tell Me" would've made a much likelier hit than the tepid "Best of Me."

Several recording artists have covered, sampled, or inspired by the singles from Fear of Flying such as Father, Tory Lanez, Jack Back, Giant Claw, Harloe, Sir Babygirl, and Normani.
