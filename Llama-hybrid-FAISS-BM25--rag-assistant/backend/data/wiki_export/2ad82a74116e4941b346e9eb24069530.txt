Dallas is a city in  Texas, United States.

Dallas Public Library

The city of Dallas is served by the Dallas Public Library system.  The system was originally created by the Dallas Federation of Women's Clubs with efforts spearheaded by then-president Mrs. Henry (May Dickson) Exall. Her work in raising money led to a grant from philanthropist and steel baron Andrew Carnegie, which enabled the construction of the first branch in 1901. Today the library operates 25 branch locations throughout the city  including the J. Erik Jonsson Central Library, the eight-story main branch in the Government District of downtown.
