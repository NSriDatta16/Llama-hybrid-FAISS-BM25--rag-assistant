The New Zealand Council of Trade Unions (NZCTU or CTU; ) is a national trade union centre in New Zealand. The NZCTU represents 360,000 workers, and is the largest democratic organisation in New Zealand.

History 
It was formed in 1987 by the merger of the New Zealand Federation of Labour (NZFL or FOL) and the Combined State Unions (CSU).

The NZCTU is closely associated with the Labour Party.  While there is no formal link between the two, some unions are formally affiliated to the Labour Party, and the President of the NZCTU speaks at the party's annual conference.

The NZCTU is affiliated with the International Trade Union Confederation.
