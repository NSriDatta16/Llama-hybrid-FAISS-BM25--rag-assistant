In mathematics, specifically in category theory, a functor 

 

is essentially surjective (or dense) if each object  of  is isomorphic to an object of the form  for some object  of .

Any functor that is part of an equivalence of categories is essentially surjective. As a partial converse, any full and faithful functor that is essentially surjective is part of an equivalence of categories.
