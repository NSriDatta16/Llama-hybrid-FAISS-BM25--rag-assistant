Headquarters
Thus, with an investment of 22 million dollars and the strong will of its shareholders, its human resources, customers and advertisers, Televen achieved its objectives.

In 1999, Televen showed a growth of 100%. With the latest technology, its signal covers the entire country. In 2000, significant investments were made which drove the growth of the channel, both domestically and internationally.

With technological innovations, framed at the beginning of a new century, Televen met one of the most important goals in its history. The new headquarters, planned building entirely with digital technology, becoming the country's most modern building in terms of TV systems are concerned.

Criticism
Televen was neutral in their political views until the arrival of Hugo Chávez, when it became a critic of the government.  After the 2004 recall referendum, Televen has attempted to return to its neutral status by cancelling the political opinion program hosted by journalist Marta Colomina, who is a fierce critic of the government.  Due to the decline of advertisement prices in television because of the two-month-long general strike, it has forced the network (along with some of its national and regional competitors) to lose some of their independence by accepting advertising from the Brazilian sect Universal Church of the Kingdom of God.

In 2005, Televen presented evidence to the Venezuelan courts of an alleged deal involving advertising costs between its principal competitors, RCTV and Venevisión.

Because Televen decided to become neutral, many in the Venezuelan Opposition and Anti-Chávez groups criticized Televen of submitting to Chávez. Opposition criticism increased against Televen during the closure of RCTV.  Many in the opposition criticized Televen of not supporting freedom of speech because Televen, and its rival Venevisión did not speak out against the closure of RCTV. Many view Televen secretly supported the closure since it would make it the second most watched television network , originally it was third after Venevisión (second most watched) and RCTV (the most watched channel). By 2010, Televen became the most watched TV network in Venezuela, beating Venevision and the state TV channels (VTV, TVes and ViVe). Telemundo's soap opera Más Sabe el Diablo is the most watched serial in the country.
