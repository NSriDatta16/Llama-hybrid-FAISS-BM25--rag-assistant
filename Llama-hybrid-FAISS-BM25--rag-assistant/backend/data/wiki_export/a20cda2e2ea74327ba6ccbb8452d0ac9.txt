Sundsvall–Timrå Airport  is about 21 km north of Sundsvall, 8 km east of Timrå and 32 km south of Härnösand, Sweden. The airport is also known as Midlanda, referring to its geographically central location in Sweden. The airport was known under the name Sundsvall–Härnösand Airport until the municipalities of Sundsvall and Timrå (but not Härnösand) obtained the ownership of the airport from Swedavia on June 17, 2013. Sundsvall–Timrå Airport is Norrland's sixth-busiest airport and Sweden's fifteenth busiest. The airport counted 282,047 passengers in 2011 and 273,527 in 2018.

It was built on delta land formed by much sediment and flood debris that washed down the Indalsälven river to the sea when the lake Ragundasjön drained suddenly and catastrophically in June 1796. The airport was inaugurated on 11 September 1944.

Sundsvall airport has Sweden's first centre for remote control towers. Four airports have their ground movements controlled from an office building with camera view only. These four airports are Örnsköldsvik, Linköping, Sälen and Sundsvall itself.
