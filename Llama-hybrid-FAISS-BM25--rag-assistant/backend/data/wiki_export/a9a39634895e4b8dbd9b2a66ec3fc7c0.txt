The Fokker S-11 Instructor is a single-engine two-seater propeller aircraft designed and manufactured by the Dutch aircraft manufacturer Fokker. It first flew in December 1947 and went on production, serving in several Air Forces in the late 20th century, including with Dutch, Italian, Israeli, Paraguay, Bolivian and Brazilian armed forces. The S-12 was a tricycle landing version of this aircraft.

History
One of the first activities undertaken by Fokker after World War II was the design of a new military aircraft for elementary flying training, the S-11 Instructor. An aircraft trader already placed orders for 100 of these aircraft in 1946, before construction had even begun. The first prototype flew at Schiphol on 18 December 1947. During testing in early 1948 it was found that some aerodynamic changes had to be made to improve the handling of the aircraft. Later that year demonstration flights for several air forces followed and eventually many S-11s were sold to the Royal Netherlands Air Force, Israeli Air Force, Italian Air Force, Brazilian Air Force, Paraguayan Air Force and Bolivian Air Force. Some 170 aircraft were license built in Italy as the Macchi M.416. A limited number of S-11 Instructors are still flying today. The Dutch Fokker Four foundation, dedicated to the preservation of the aircraft, operates four S-11s and amongst other activities still performs with them on airshows.

A version of the S-11 fitted with tricycle landing gear, the S-12, was built by Fokker Industria Aeronautica in Brazil, and was used by the Brazilian Air Force as the T-22 Instructor.

In Italy, 178 were produced under license by Macchi, and they were called M.416.

The aircraft is a two seat piston-powered monoplane with maximum take of weight of 1100 kg (2425 lb) and a top speed of 209 km/h (130 mph, 113 kts).

In the 1950s and 1960s it became a test aircraft with Delft University, who -through the "Nederlands Instituut voor Vliegtuigontwikkeling" and its aviation development department- used it for boundary layer suction research. In the mid-1970s it was withdrawn from use and donated to the Aviodome museum at Schiphol Airport.
