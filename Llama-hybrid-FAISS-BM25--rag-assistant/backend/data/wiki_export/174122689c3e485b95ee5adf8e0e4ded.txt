Anomalurus is the largest genus in the rodent family Anomaluridae, with four species.  It is the only genus in the subfamily Anomalurinae.

Species 
A. beecrofti - Beecroft's scaly-tailed squirrel
A. derbianus - Lord Derby's scaly-tailed squirrel
A. pelii - Pel's scaly-tailed squirrel
A. pusillus - dwarf scaly-tailed squirrel

Beecroft's scaly-tailed squirrel, Anomalurus beecrofti, is sometimes moved to its own genus, Anomalurops, but Dieterlen (2005) and other authorities consider it to be part of Anomalurus.
