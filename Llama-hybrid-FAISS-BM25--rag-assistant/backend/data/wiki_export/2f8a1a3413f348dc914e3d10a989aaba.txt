Araneta Center–Cubao station (also called as Araneta–Cubao station or simply Cubao station) is an elevated Manila Light Rail Transit (LRT) station situated on Line 2. The station is located in Cubao in Quezon City and is named after the old name of Araneta City, a mixed-use development.

It first commenced operations on April 5, 2003.
