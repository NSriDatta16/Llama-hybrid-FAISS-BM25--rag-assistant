William Christie Gosse  (11 December 1842–12 August 1881) was an Australian explorer.

Biography
Gosse was born on 11 December 1842 in Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, England and immigrated to Australia with his father William Gosse, a medical doctor, in 1850. He was educated at J. L. Young's Adelaide Educational Institution and in 1859 he entered the Government service of the colony of South Australia. He held various positions in the survey department, including Deputy Surveyor-General.

Death and legacy
Gosse died of a heart attack on 12 August 1881, aged 38, after a long illness.

Although Gosse's exploration was not groundbreaking, he filled in many details in the central Australia map.
He named the Musgrave Ranges and was able correctly to lay down the position of some of the discoveries of Ernest Giles.

On 19 July 1873 he reached an inselberg and gave it the name Ayers Rock. He was the first European man to climb the rock, along with an Afghan member of his party, Kamran.

Mount Conner in the Northern Territory was named after Mountifort Conner by Gosse in 1873.

Recognition
In 1931, the Hundred of Gosse, a cadastral division located on Kangaroo Island in South Australia was named in Gosse's memory. 

In 1976 he was honoured on a postage stamp bearing his portrait issued by Australia Post.
