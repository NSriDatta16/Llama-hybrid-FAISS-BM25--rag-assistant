Chungmok of Goryeo (15 May 1337 – 25 December 1348, r. 1344–1348), born Wang Heun (), was the 29th king of the Goryeo dynasty of Korea.

Biography

He was the eldest son of King Chunghye, and his mother was Princess Deoknyeong. Chungmok is known in some records by his Mongolian name, Batma Dorji, which is rendered in hanja as Palsamataaji ().

After King Chunghye was deposed in 1343, King Chungmok had an audience with the Yuan Emperor Togon-temür. He was asked whether he would prefer to follow the ways of his mother or his father; when King Chungmok answered that he would prefer to follow his mother, the Emperor said that this was a child who knew the difference between right and wrong, and made him king.
