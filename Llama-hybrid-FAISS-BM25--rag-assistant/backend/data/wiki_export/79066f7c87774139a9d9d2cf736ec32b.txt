The Road–Railway Bridge () or Boško Perošević Bridge () was a bridge on the Danube river in Novi Sad, Serbia.

History
On 29 May 2000, one year after the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia and demolition of all three large bridges over Danube in Novi Sad, the Road–Railway Bridge was opened upstream from the Žeželj Bridge. On the proposal of Slobodan Milošević, at the time President of Yugoslavia, the bridge was named after assassinated Serbian politician and the Chairman of the Executive Council of Vojvodina Boško Perošević.

The bridge was designed to be a temporary one-lane railway and road bridge, after the demolition of nearby Žeželj Bridge during the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.

In October 2018, following the completion of new Žeželj Bridge, dismantling of Boško Perošević Bridge began. As of March 2019, the first phase of bridge dismantling was finished.
