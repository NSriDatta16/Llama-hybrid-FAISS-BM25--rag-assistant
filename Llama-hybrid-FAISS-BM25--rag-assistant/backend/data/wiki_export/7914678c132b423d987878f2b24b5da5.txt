U.S. Route 30 (US 30) is a U.S. Highway that runs east–west across the southern part of Pennsylvania, passing through Pittsburgh and Philadelphia on its way from the West Virginia state line east to the Benjamin Franklin Bridge over the Delaware River into New Jersey.

In Pennsylvania, US 30 runs along or near the transcontinental Lincoln Highway, an auto trail which ran from San Francisco, California, to New York City before the U.S. Routes were designated. The Lincoln Highway turned northeast at Philadelphia, however, using present US 1 and its former alignments to cross the Delaware River into Trenton, New Jersey.

Points of interest along US 30 include the Gettysburg Battlefield, Dutch Wonderland, the Flight 93 National Memorial, Fort Ligonier, Westmoreland Mall, Jennerstown Speedway, Idlewild and Soak Zone, and Independence Mall at the Independence National Historical Park.

Past this interchange, the freeway leaves the city limits of Coatesville and passes under PA 340 before reaching an interchange with Reeceville Road. The route curves east-southeast and crosses under PA 340 again before running east and coming to a diamond interchange with PA 340 north of the community of Thorndale. US 30 heads east-northeast and reaches a partial cloverleaf interchange with US 322 that serves the borough of Downingtown. Farther east, the freeway passes over PA 282 and the East Branch Brandywine Creek before it comes to a bridge over the Struble Trail and enters a section of Downingtown, reaching a westbound exit and eastbound entrance with Norwood Road that provides access to PA 282. The route widens to six lanes and heads near suburban development before it comes to an eastbound exit and westbound entrance with PA 113, at which point it leaves the borough limits of Downingtown and narrows back to four lanes. US 30 curves southeast and reaches an interchange with US 30 Bus. Past this interchange, the name of the freeway changes to Exton Bypass. The route turns northeast and runs parallel to Amtrak's Keystone Corridor railroad line to the south of the road. US 30 comes to a partial cloverleaf interchange with PA 100 that serves the community of Exton to the north. Following this, the freeway continues east-northeast parallel to the Amtrak line. US 30 comes to an interchange with the US 202 freeway and the eastern terminus of US 30 Bus., at which point the freeway section ends. The Exton Bypass portion of US 30 is designated the Exton Bypass Scenic Byway, a Pennsylvania Scenic Byway.

Past the interchange with US 202 and US 30 Bus., US 30 heads east-northeast along four-lane divided Lincoln Highway and passes south of a park and ride lot, running through the community of Glenloch. The route soon becomes Lancaster Avenue, a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane. In the community of Frazer, the road comes to an intersection with the northern terminus of PA 352. Farther east, US 30 widens to five lanes with a center turn lane before it reaches a junction with the eastern terminus of PA 401. The route turns into a four-lane divided highway prior to intersecting the southern terminus of PA 29. Past this intersection, the road crosses under Norfolk Southern's Dale Secondary railroad line and continues east as it runs north of the borough of Malvern, becoming undivided. US 30 briefly gains a center left-turn lane before it becomes a divided highway again as it passes south of Paoli Hospital prior to crossing under Amtrak's Keystone Corridor railroad line to the north of the community of Green Tree. At this point, the route enters an area of suburbs called the Philadelphia Main Line as it heads into the community of Paoli, becoming a four-lane undivided road. In the center of Paoli, the road has a junction with Paoli Pike before it passes south of the Paoli station serving Amtrak's Keystone Corridor and SEPTA's Paoli/Thorndale Line. US 30 gains a center left-turn lane and reaches an intersection with PA 252. Following this intersection, the route runs south of the parallel Amtrak line, passing south of the Daylesford SEPTA station in the community of Daylesford. The road loses the center turn lane and runs further south but still parallel to the railroad tracks, turning northeast. US 30 reaches the community of Berwyn, where it passes south of the Berwyn SEPTA station and curves east and then southeast, gaining a center left-turn lane. The route turns to the northeast and reaches the community of Devon, where it drops the center turn lane and runs south of the Devon SEPTA station before passing to the north of the Devon Horse Show grounds. Past Devon, the road bends to the east-southeast.

Upon intersecting Old Eagle School Road/Sugartown Road, US 30 enters Delaware County and continues east-southeast along four-lane undivided Lancaster Avenue, curving east and running through the downtown area of the community of Wayne. The route passes through the community of St. Davids and turns southeast. East of here, the road becomes a divided highway before turning undivided again. US 30 briefly becomes a divided highway again as it curves east and reaches an interchange with I-476. Past this interchange, the route turns back into an undivided road and crosses under SEPTA's Norristown High Speed Line before coming to an intersection with PA 320 in the community of Villanova. Following this intersection, the road runs through the Villanova University campus, passing south of St. Thomas of Villanova Church, and curves southeast prior to the Ithan Avenue intersection, where it heads to the south of Villanova Stadium and the Finneran Pavilion arena. After passing through the university campus, US 30 runs through the community of Rosemont. Upon intersecting County Line Road, the route enters Montgomery County and heads into the community of Bryn Mawr, passing through the downtown area. The road continues southeast and briefly re-enters Delaware County before heading back into Montgomery County. US 30 passes through the community of Haverford, where it heads north of the Haverford School. The route continues into the community of Ardmore and runs through the community's downtown area, passing south of the Ardmore station serving Amtrak's Keystone Corridor and SEPTA's Paoli/Thorndale Line. Past Ardmore, the road heads through the community of Wynnewood. The route runs southeast before it crosses the East Branch Indian Creek and passes between the St. Charles Borromeo Seminary to the northeast and Lankenau Medical Center to the southwest as a five-lane road with a center left-turn lane prior to reaching an intersection with US 1 (City Avenue).

Upon crossing US 1, US 30 enters the city of Philadelphia in Philadelphia County and continues southeast along two-lane undivided Lancaster Avenue through the Overbrook neighborhood. At the intersection with 62nd Street/Malvern Avenue, the route passes north of the 63rd and Malvern Loop that serves as the terminus of SEPTA's Route 10 trolley line and heads into urban areas of West Philadelphia a short distance to the south of Amtrak's Keystone Corridor railroad line, running north of Overbrook High School after the 59th Street intersection. Farther southeast, a SEPTA trolley track follows the westbound lanes past the 54th Street junction. At the intersection with 52nd Street/Lansdowne Avenue, US 30 heads further south from the Amtrak tracks and SEPTA's Route 10 trolley line begins following the road. The route splits from Lancaster Avenue by turning east onto Girard Avenue, which carries two lanes of traffic and SEPTA's Route 15 trolley line. The road runs east and crosses over Amtrak's Keystone Corridor railroad line at the Belmont Avenue intersection before widening to four lanes. Farther east, US 30 passes over CSX's Harrisburg Subdivision railroad line before it comes to an interchange with I-76 (Schuylkill Expressway) and US 13 to the north of the Philadelphia Zoo, crossing under the Pennsylvania Railroad, Connecting Railway Bridge carrying Amtrak's Northeast Corridor railroad line at this interchange. At this interchange, US 13 heads south along 34th Street and continues east (north) along the Girard Avenue Bridge over the Schuylkill River while US 30 becomes concurrent with I-76 on the six-lane Schuylkill Expressway at this point and the road heads south, with the Philadelphia Zoo to the west and Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, the Schuylkill River Trail, and the Schuylkill River parallel to the east. The freeway turns southeast and runs between Amtrak's Northeast Corridor to the southwest and the river drive, trail, and river to the northeast, with Boathouse Row on the opposite bank of the river. The Schuylkill Expressway comes to an eastbound exit and westbound entrance with Spring Garden Street, which heads east across the Schuylkill River toward the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The freeway continues south, heading east of Amtrak's Penn Coach Yard, and comes to an interchange with the western terminus of I-676.

At this point, US 30 heads east concurrent with I-676 on the six-lane Vine Street Expressway. It immediately crosses the Schuylkill River and then the Schuylkill River Trail and CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision railroad line on the river's east bank on the Vine Street Expressway Bridge before coming to an interchange with 23rd Street and 22nd Street and the Benjamin Franklin Parkway that has access to the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Franklin Institute science museum. From this point, the Vine Street Expressway enters a depressed road cut and passes under several streets and two freeway lids, running along the northern edge of Center City Philadelphia.  Vine Street serves as a street-level frontage road to the freeway. Within this alignment, there is an exit for PA 611 (Broad Street). After passing under 10th Street in Chinatown, the last street the depressed alignment passes under, the highway rises up and reaches a split between the Vine Street Expressway, which continues to I-95, and I-676/US 30. At this split, there is also an eastbound exit and westbound entrance for 8th Street. After exiting the Vine Street Expressway, eastbound I-676/US 30 has a brief at-grade portion along southbound 6th Street east of Franklin Square to the Benjamin Franklin Bridge approach, an example of a non–limited access section of Interstate Highway. Westbound I-676/US 30 has a ramp from the bridge to the Vine Street Expressway that intersects 7th Street and 8th Street at-grade. From this point, I-676/US 30 crosses over I-95, Christopher Columbus Boulevard, and then the Delaware River into New Jersey on the seven-lane Benjamin Franklin Bridge, which also carries pedestrians and the PATCO Speedline. This bridge and its approaches are maintained by the Delaware River Port Authority.

History

The path of the Lincoln Highway was first laid out in September 1913; it was defined to run through Canton, Ohio; Beaver; Pittsburgh; Greensburg; Ligonier; Bedford; Chambersburg; Gettysburg; York; Lancaster; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Camden, New Jersey. This bypassed Harrisburg to the south, and thus did not use the older main route across the state between Chambersburg and Lancaster. From Pittsburgh to Philadelphia, this incorporated a number of old turnpikes, some of which still collected tolls:
Part of the Harrisburg and Pittsburgh Turnpike, chartered in 1806, broken up in 1814 into separate turnpike companies, of which the following were included:
Greensburg and Pittsburgh Turnpike, Pittsburgh to Greensburg
Somerset and Greensburg Turnpike (renamed the Stoystown and Greensburg Turnpike 1815), Greensburg to Stoystown
Bedford and Somerset Turnpike (renamed the Bedford and Stoystown Turnpike 1815), Stoystown to Bedford
Chambersburg and Bedford Turnpike, Bedford to Chambersburg
Chambersburg Turnpike, Chambersburg to Cashtown
Part of the Gettysburg and Petersburg Turnpike, from Cashtown to Gettysburg
York and Gettysburg Turnpike, Gettysburg to York
Wrightsville Turnpike, York to Wrightsville
 Columbia-Wrightsville Bridge, Wrightsville to Columbia
Lancaster and Susquehanna Turnpike, Columbia to Lancaster
 Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike, Lancaster to Philadelphia

This original 1913 path of the Lincoln Highway continued east from Philadelphia, crossing the Delaware River to Camden, New Jersey, on the Market Street Ferry. The city of Philadelphia marked the route from the ferry landing west on Market Street through downtown and onto Lancaster Avenue to the Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike in early 1914. By 1915 Camden was dropped from the route, allowing the highway to cross the Delaware River on a bridge at Trenton, New Jersey (initially the Calhoun Street Bridge, later the Bridge Street Bridge).

In 1924, the entire Lincoln Highway in Pennsylvania was designated Pennsylvania Route 1 (PA 1). In late 1926 the route from West Virginia to Philadelphia (using the new route west of Pittsburgh) was assigned US 30, while the rest of the Lincoln Highway and PA 1 became part of US 1. The PA 1 designation was gone by 1929, but several branches from east to west – PA 101, PA 201, PA 301, PA 401, PA 501 and PA 601 – had been assigned by then. (PA 701 was assigned later as a branch of PA 101.)

Ohio to Downtown Pittsburgh

As defined in 1913, the Lincoln Highway ran east-northeast from Canton, Ohio, to Alliance and east via Salem, crossing into Pennsylvania just east of East Palestine. From there it continued southeasterly to Beaver, crossing the Beaver River there and heading south along its left bank to Rochester and the Ohio River's right bank to Pittsburgh.

By 1915, the highway had been realigned to the route it would follow until the end of 1927. It ran east from Canton, Ohio to Lisbon and then southeast to East Liverpool on the Ohio River. After crossing into Pennsylvania, it turned north away from the river at Smiths Ferry, taking an inland route to Beaver, where it rejoined the Ohio River. It crossed the Beaver River into Rochester, joining the 1913 alignment, and turned south with the Ohio to Pittsburgh.

1915 route
This route entered Pennsylvania along PA Route 68. After crossing Little Beaver Creek, it turned south on Main Street, passing under the Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad (PRR) into Glasgow. After passing through that community on Liberty Street, the highway turned north and passed under the railroad again at Smiths Ferry, merging with Smiths Ferry Road. This alignment through Glasgow carried the Lincoln Highway until ca. 1926, when the present PA 68 was built on the north side of the railroad.

The Lincoln Highway left the banks of the Ohio River on Smiths Ferry Road, which includes an old stone bridge over Upper Dry Run. It turned east on Tuscarawas Road through Ohioville, entering Beaver on Fourth Street and turning south on Buffalo Street to reach Third Street (PA Route 68). By 1929 this inland Glasgow-Beaver route was numbered PA Route 168, while the route along the river, never followed by the Lincoln Highway, was PA 68.

Where PA 68 crosses the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad from Beaver into Bridgewater along Third Street and then the Beaver River on the ca. 1963 Rochester-Bridgewater Bridge, the Lincoln Highway instead ran along Bridge Street, just to the north, and crossed the Old Rochester-Bridgewater Bridge into Rochester.

Continuing through Rochester to Pittsburgh, the Lincoln Highway left the Old Rochester-Bridgewater Bridge on Madison Street, turning onto Brighton Avenue, and then crossing the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway (PRR) on New York Avenue. After running alongside the Ohio River on Railroad Avenue, the highway crossed the railroad again in Freedom (about a block north of Third Street), running through Freedom on Third Avenue.

South of downtown Freedom, Third Avenue merges into the Ohio River Boulevard, also known as PA Route 65, which runs along the old Lincoln Highway into Conway. There the old highway went onto First Avenue and State Street, rejoining PA 65 in Baden. Further into Baden, the old highway left PA 65 again, onto State Street, becoming Duss Avenue in Harmony Township. At the Ambridge limits, this becomes PA Route 989, but the old highway turned west at 14th Street and then south on Merchant Street.

Crossing Big Sewickley Creek from Ambridge, Beaver County into Leetsdale, Allegheny County, Merchant Street becomes Beaver Street, a brick road. Beaver Road and Beaver Street continues through Edgeworth, Sewickley, and Osborne, merging back into PA 65 at the border with Haysville. Sewickley officially changed the name of its piece to Lincoln Highway by an ordinance in January 1916, and Osborne, Edgeworth and Leetsdale soon followed suit, but that name is no longer used.

In Glenfield, the highway crossed the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway twice, once near the present overpass and again west of Toms Run Road. The old road next to the Ohio River, Beaver Street, is still a yellow brick road but now used only by local traffic.

The old road left PA 65 again in Emsworth as Beaver Road, becoming Brighton Road in Ben Avon before re-merging with PA 65. It splits yet again, also in Ben Avon, onto Brighton Road, another yellow brick road. In Avalon it is California Avenue, and in Bellevue it is Lincoln Avenue, coincidentally named after Lincoln soon after the U.S. Civil War.

The highway crosses into Pittsburgh on a high concrete arch bridge over Jack's Run, built in 1924 to replace an earlier bridge built for a streetcar line, and returns to the California Avenue name. It crosses Woods Run on a similar 1928 bridge next to a newer bridge built for the Ohio River Boulevard (PA Route 65). Where California Avenue curves away from PA 65, the Lincoln Highway continued next to it on Chateau Street, turning east on Western Avenue and then south on Galveston Avenue onto the 1915 Manchester Bridge to the Point.

During the time that the Lincoln Highway ran through Rochester, the Rochester-Pittsburgh segment was locally maintained. It was often foggy, and a July 1926 Lincoln Highway Association road report states that it was "paved city streets, mostly poor", in stark contrast to the good paving east of Pittsburgh. By 1924, reports recommended following an alternate on the other side of the river between Rochester and Pittsburgh. The route west of Rochester had similar problems; it was a dirt road, despite being a state highway. By 1922 an official detour was recommended via East Palestine, Ohio and Beaver, largely identical to the initial 1913 plan.

1927 route
Work began in the mid-1920s on a new route to the south of the existing route, passing through West Virginia and bypassing the problematic sections on both sides of Rochester; the Lincoln Highway was moved to it December 2, 1927. This new route had already been numbered U.S. 30 in late 1926.

The new Lincoln Highway bypassed the community of Imperial on a bypass built for it. Just southeast of Imperial, the highway turned east on Steubenville Pike, joining what was U.S. Route 22 before the present U.S. 22/U.S. 30 freeway was built ca. 1964. Steubenville Pike runs along the north side of the freeway, crossing to the south side and then merging with it just west of the I-376 interchange. From the late 1940s to 1982, the appropriately-named Penn-Lincoln Drive-In Theater operated on a stretch of the original Lincoln Highway in North Fayette, just east of Imperial. It reopened for one season in 1985 as the Super 30 West Drive-In. The site is now occupied by Penn-Lincoln Shopping Center.

US 22 and US 30 now join I-376 and turn southeast, but the Lincoln Highway (and US 22/30 before the nearby part of what is now I-376 opened in 1953) continued east with PA 60 through Robinson Township. In 1950, the Twin Hi-Way Drive-In Theater opened along the Robinson Township stretch, its name derived from the road's former designation of dual U.S. Route 22/30. Through Crafton, the highway used Steuben Street, Noble Avenue, Dinsmore Avenue, and Crafton Boulevard, now northbound PA 60. In Pittsburgh, the highway ran along Crafton Boulevard, Noblestown Road, and South Main Street, as PA 60 still does. It turned onto Carson Street (now PA Route 837) at the West End Circle, crossing the 1927 Point Bridge into the Point.

Downtown Pittsburgh to North Huntingdon

From 1915 to late 1927, the Lincoln Highway crossed the Allegheny River on the Manchester Bridge to the Point, touching down at the foot of Penn Avenue after meeting the Point Bridge. It made its way through downtown to Bigelow Boulevard (now PA Route 380), using Water Street, Liberty Avenue and Oliver Avenue. It continued to follow present PA 380 onto Craig Street and Baum Boulevard to East Liberty. The highway left East Liberty and Pittsburgh on Penn Avenue, the old Pittsburgh and Greensburg Turnpike, also now part of PA 380, and further east part of PA Route 8. (PA 380 however bypasses the center of East Liberty.)

The Boulevard of the Allies opened east from downtown Pittsburgh in 1923, and in 1924 it was designated as an alternate route. By 1930, this bypass ran along the Boulevard of the Allies, Forbes Avenue, Beeler Street, Wilkins Avenue and Dallas Avenue, rejoining the Lincoln Highway at Penn Avenue, west of Wilkinsburg.

Leaving the Pittsburgh area, the Lincoln Highway turned onto Ardmore Boulevard (now signed as PA 8 north of I-376, and U.S. 30 south of I-376). It then branched away from Ardmore Boulevard along Electric Avenue, turned northeast on Braddock Avenue, then east on Penn Avenue. The Lincoln Highway originally continued onto Airbrake Avenue and then turned south at 11th Street to cross Turtle Creek and the Pennsylvania Railroad main line over a bridge; a 1925 replacement bridge starts at the intersection of Airbrake Avenue, Penn Avenue, Monroeville Avenue, and Greensburg Pike. The Lincoln Highway then followed Greensburg Pike up to current U.S. 30.

In 1932, a bypass of the grades into and out of Turtle Creek, including the George Westinghouse Bridge, was opened. It runs along current U.S. 30 from the interchange with Electric Avenue in Chalfant to the intersection with Greensburg Pike in North Versailles.

The borough of White Oak had named their main street Lincoln Way in an attempt to convince the Lincoln Highway Association to use it, but instead the highway continued along Greensburg Pike through North Versailles.

Later history

The Penn-Lincoln Parkway was built from 1953 to 1962 as a freeway bypass across the Pittsburgh area for both the Lincoln Highway (US 30) and the William Penn Highway (US 22).

In 1953, the portion of present-day US 30 between PA 283 in Lancaster and PA 462 east of Lancaster was built as a freeway alignment of US 230. In 1967, US 30 was shifted to a freeway bypass between Prospect Road east of Columbia and east of Lancaster; the route replaced the US 230 designation between the present-day PA 283 and PA 462 interchanges. PA 462 was designated onto the former alignment of US 30 between those two points. In 1972, US 30 was shifted to a bypass between west of York and Columbia, with PA 462 extended west along the former alignment of US 30.

In 1963, the freeway bypass of US 30 between east of PA 10 and east of Downingtown was completed, with US 30 Bus. designated onto the former alignment of US 30. In December 1995, the US 30 freeway was extended east to bypass Exton, ending at an interchange with the US 202 freeway. As a result, US 30 Bus. was extended east through Exton along the former alignment of US 30 to its current eastern terminus.

From 1997 to 2004, significant construction was completed to the US 30 bypass around Lancaster.

A bypass of the section of US 30 in Gap, in Lancaster County, was first proposed in February 2012. In 2015, a PennDOT project began to build a bypass to the north of Gap for westbound US 30 between the PA 772 and PA 41 intersections to improve traffic flow and safety at the congested intersection of US 30 and PA 41. The bypass, which cost $10 million, was opened on August 4, 2016.

On April 7, 2018, a section of US 30 in East Pittsburgh sank  down a hill after a landslide. One apartment building was destroyed, another threatened and ultimately demolished. The damaged road section reopened in late June 2018.

There are plans for improvements to be made to the US 30 freeway bypassing Coatesville and Downingtown in Chester County. The project is split into a western section between PA 10 near Parkesburg and PA 82 in Coatesville and an eastern section between Reeceville Road near Coatesville and US 30 Bus. east of Downingtown. The western section will remain four lanes wide, with construction planned to begin in 2026. The eastern section is planned to be widened to six lanes, with construction beginning as early as 2028. In addition to improvements made to the freeway, interchanges will also be improved. Construction of the western section is projected to cost $355 million while the eastern section is projected to cost $460 million.
