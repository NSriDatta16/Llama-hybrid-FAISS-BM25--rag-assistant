Alexey Nikolayevich Shpeyer (; 1854–1916) was a diplomat from the Russian Empire. The Russian government had intended to send him to Korea in 1895 to replace Karl Ivanovich Weber as Russian consul general in Korea, but at the request of King Gojong of Korea's Joseon Dynasty, Weber remained in place, and Shpeyer was sent to Tokyo instead. Shpeyer finally replaced Weber in September 1897. He later served as the chargé d'affaires of the Russian Embassy in Tehran, Persia, and was eventually promoted to the position of Russian Ambassador to Persia.
