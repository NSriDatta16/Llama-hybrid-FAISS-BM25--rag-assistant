Move to Europe

He started 18 games and played as a substitute for another 18 matches during his debut season at Highbury. Vivas scored his first and only goal for the Gunners against Derby County in the League Cup. He had a setback when he missed a penalty in a shootout as Arsenal crashed out of the 1999/2000 League Cup to Middlesbrough.

Vivas was loaned out to the La Liga outfit Celta Vigo halfway through the 1999–00 season. As Arsenal had signed Oleh Luzhnyi and Sylvinho in the summer of 1999, he went on to mainly appear as a substitute at the club.
