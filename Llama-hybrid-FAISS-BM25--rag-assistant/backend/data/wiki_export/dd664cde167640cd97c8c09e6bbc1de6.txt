X Caeli, or Gamma2 Caeli, is a binary star system in the southern constellation of Caelum. It is barely visible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude of 6.32. based upon an annual parallax shift of , it is located 341 light-years from Earth. The system is moving further away with a heliocentric radial velocity of +6 km/s.

The yellow-white-hued primary, component A, has an apparent magnitude of +6.32 and stellar classification of F2 IV/V, showing mixed traits of an F-type main-sequence star and a subgiant. It is classified as a Delta Scuti-type variable star and its brightness varies from magnitude +6.28 to +6.39 with a period of 3.25 hours. A 2000 observing campaign identified at least six independent pulsation modes for this variation. The companion star, component B, has an apparent magnitude of +9.65 and, as of 2000, is at an angular separation of  along a position angle of 183°.
