18D/Perrine–Mrkos is a periodic comet in the Solar System, originally discovered by the American-Argentine astronomer Charles Dillon Perrine (Lick Observatory, California, United States) on December 9, 1896.  For some time it was thought to be a fragment of Biela's Comet.

It was considered lost after the 1909 appearance, but was rediscovered by the Czech astronomer Antonín Mrkos (Skalnate Pleso Observatory, Slovakia) on October 19, 1955, using ordinary binoculars, it was later confirmed as 18D by Leland E. Cunningham (Leuschner Observatory, University of California, Berkeley).

The comet was last observed during the 1968 perihelion passage when it passed  from the Earth. The comet has not been observed during the following perihelion passages:
1975 Aug. 2
1982 May 16
1989 Feb. 28
1995 Dec. 6 (apmag 19?)
2002 Sept.10 (apmag 20?)
2009 Apr. 17 (apmag 24?)
2017 Feb. 26 (apmag 24?)

The next predicted perihelion passage would be on 2025-Jan-01 but the comet is currently considered lost as it has not been seen since Jan 1969.
