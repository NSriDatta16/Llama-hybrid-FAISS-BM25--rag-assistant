History

Japanese tourism and Hawaiian AC
The station signed on the air on .  The original call sign was KORL.  It had a Japanese tourist information format.   In 1999, the station switched to Hawaiian Adult Contemporary music.  In 2002, it added the moniker "The Breeze" and changed call letters to KHUI.

In 2003, KHUI became the first station in the United States to play a Variety Hits format when it brought Bob FM to the Honolulu radio market.  But the format didn't score well in the Arbitron ratings and only lasted a year.

Salem ownership
In 2004, the Salem Media Group bought the station and reinstated "The Breeze" Hawaiian AC format that same year. In November 2006, KHUI switched formats to soft oldies and adult standards, branded as "The Jewel."  It used the satellite-fed service "America's Best Music" from Dial Global (now Westwood One).  America's Best Music was previously heard in the market from 1995 to 2001 on KUMU 1500 AM.

On December 26, 2010, KHUI flipped from Adult Standards to a simulcast of Salem's Christian Talk sister station KGU 760 AM.  The call letters switched to KGU-FM to match the call sign on 760 AM. 

The simulcast ended on February 1, 2011, when the AM station flipped to Business Talk.  That left KGU-FM with the Christian talk and teaching format.  (KGU 760 is now a sports radio station.)
