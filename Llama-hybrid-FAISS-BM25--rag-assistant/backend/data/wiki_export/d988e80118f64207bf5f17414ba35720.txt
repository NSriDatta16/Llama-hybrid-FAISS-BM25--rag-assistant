Celestial Pictures is a diversified entertainment company focusing on Asian-language film and television content including production, aggregation, distribution, and the operation of TV channels.

Headquartered in Hong Kong, the company owns the world's largest Chinese film collection including the Shaw Brothers film library. Celestial Pictures is restoring the Shaw Brothers' movies and distributing them to cinemas and the worldwide television and home video markets.

History
It purchased the Shaw Brothers film library in 2000 when it was then called "East Asia Filmed Entertainment Ltd" and owned by the Malaysian media group Astro Holdings Sdn Bhd, which in turn controlled by Usaha Tegas Sdn Bhd (a Malaysian investment holding company). In 2001, under the Chinese name 星藝映畫, it produced two films, namely Comic King (漫畫風雲) and Stowaway (驚天大逃亡). It took up the current Chinese name 天映娛樂 in 2002.

Television channels
Celestial’s television channel operations include Celestial Movies; Celestial Movies Asia, which screens Japanese and Korean blockbusters; Celestial Classic Movies, which features Chinese classic films including the Shaw Brothers film collection; and WaTV, a Chinese infotainment channel dedicated to a new reflection of modern China. Also Shaw Bros. movies distributed by Celestial are shown in America on El Rey Network as part of its "Flying Five Finger One Armed Eight Pole Shaolin Exploding Death Touch Tuesdays" block.

Film and television content acquisition
Besides the library and TV networks, Celestial Pictures produces and acquires feature films and hundreds of hours of television programs each year, including television dramas, children's programs, animation, and documentaries for their channels and worldwide distribution.

Celestial Pictures is a wholly owned subsidiary of Astro Overseas Ltd, owned by Astro Holdings Sdn Bhd.
