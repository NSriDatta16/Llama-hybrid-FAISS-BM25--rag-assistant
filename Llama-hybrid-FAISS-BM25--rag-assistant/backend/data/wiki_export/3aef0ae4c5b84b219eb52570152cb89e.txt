The Putrajaya Lake () is a lake located at the centre of Putrajaya, Malaysia, roughly 33 kilometres south of Kuala Lumpur. This 650-hectare man-made lake is designed to act as a natural cooling system for the city and also for recreation, fishing, water sports and water transport.  The lake and its surrounding areas form Putrajayaâ€™s most popular resource for informal recreation as a waterfront city.

The lake has an average depth of 6.60 metres and a catchment area of 50.9 square kilometres.

The well-known Putra Mosque (Pink Mosque), Tuanku Mizan Zainal Abidin Mosque (Iron Mosque), and Millennium Monument (Malaysia) are located on its shores.
