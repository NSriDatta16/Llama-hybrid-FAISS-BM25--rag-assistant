East Riverfront is a St. Louis MetroLink station. The station is located near the Casino Queen and Malcolm W. Martin Memorial Park in East St. Louis, Illinois. 

East Riverfront was built on a reconstructed viaduct just east of the historic Eads Bridge and is the westernmost station in Illinois before crossing the Mississippi River into Missouri. The station is popular with Illinois commuters and has a park and ride lot with 295 spaces. 

On January 24, 2023, Metro announced that East Riverfront would temporarily close on January 30 to accommodate platform rehabilitation and staircase replacement. These improvments were completed and the station reopened on May 29th, 2023.

Station layout 
The platforms are accessed from Front Street via a set of stairs and an elevator on either side of the Eads Bridge. The eastbound platform can also be accessed via a ramp from the upper-level pedestrian walkway on the south edge of the bridge.
