In ancient time, Kasur was known for its education and fish. The history of Kasur is more than 1,000 years. Kasur region was agricultural region with forests during the Indus Valley civilization. The Vedic period is characterized by Indo-Aryan culture that migrated from Central Asia and settled in Punjab region.

After overrunning the Achaemenid Empire in 331 BCE, Alexander marched into present-day Punjab region with an army of 50,000. The Kasur region was ruled by Maurya Empire, Indo-Greek kingdom, Kushan Empire, Gupta Empire, White Huns, Kushano-Hephthalites and the Turk and Hindu Shahi kingdoms.

In 997 CE, Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi, took over the Ghaznavid dynasty empire established by his father, Sultan Sebuktegin, In 1005 he conquered the Shahis in Kabul in 1005, and followed it by the conquests of Punjab region. The Delhi Sultanate and later Mughal Empire ruled the region. The Punjab region became predominantly Muslim due to missionary Sufi saints whose dargahs dot the landscape of the Punjab region.

The Mughal Empire ruled Kasur for 200 years. After and during the decline of the Mughal Empire, the Sikhs took over the Kasur District. The agriculture lands were given to leaders and supporters of the Sikh army. Most of the Punjab region was annexed by the East India Company in 1849, and was one of the last areas of the South Asia to fall under British colonial rule.
