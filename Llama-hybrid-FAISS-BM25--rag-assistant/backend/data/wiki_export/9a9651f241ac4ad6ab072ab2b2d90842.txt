Medieval Amalfi was ruled, in the tenth and eleventh centuries, by a series of dukes (), sometimes called dogi (singular: doge), corresponding with the republic of Venice, a maritime rival throughout the Middle Ages. Before the title of Duke of Amalfi was formally established in 957, various patricians governed the territory. Amalfi established itself as one of the earliest maritime trading powers renowned throughout the Mediterranean, considered for two centuries, one of the most powerful of the maritime republics.

The title of Duke of Amalfi was reestablished as a Spanish dukedom in 1642 by King Philip IV of Spain for Ottavio Piccolomini, an Imperial field marshal. Of noble Tuscan descent, two popes were scions of the Piccolomini family, and the first duke's younger brother, Ascanio II Piccolomini, served as archbishop of Siena from 1628 until 1671.

King Alfonso XIII of Spain revived the dukedom in 1902, and the title is extant.

920–931 Leo
939–947 John (I)

Dukes
Mastalus was elected duke on his coming of age, but died the next year. A new dynasty was then inaugurated. It reigned uninterrupted for the next 115 years, except during the period 1039–1052, when the duke of Salerno conquered the duchy.

957–958 Mastalus II

House of Musco Comite

Norman period
Amalfi was conquered by Robert Guiscard, duke of Apulia. Nevertheless, Amalfi rebelled twice, once electing the former prince of Salerno, Gisulf, and once electing a Neapolitan of that ducal family.

1088–1089 Gisulf, also Prince of Salerno (1052–1078)
1096–1100 Marinus Sebastus

A certain Manso ruled Amalfi—minting his own currency—under the title of vicedux (Vice-duke) sometime between 1077 and 1096, most probably during the reign of Robert's son Roger Borsa. Manso recognised Norman overlordship and was most probably a Norman appointee.

Neapolitan dukedom (1388–1673)
The title of Duke of Amalfi (Duca di Amalfi in Italian) was revived under the Kingdom of Naples in the late 14th century, passing to the Piccolomini family in 1461.
1398–1405 Venceslao Sanseverino, also Count of Tricario and Chiaromonte, and Duke of Venosa
1405–1438 Giordano Colonna
1438–1459 Raimondo II del Balzo Orsini, also Prince of Salerno (died 1459)
1461–1493 Antonio Todeschini Piccolomini
1493–1498 Alfonso I Piccolomini, whose wife Giovanna is the title character in The Duchess of Malfi
1499–1559 Alfonso II Piccolomini
1559–1575 Cesare I Gonzaga
1584–1630 Ferrante II Gonzaga
1642–1656 Ottavio Piccolomini, created by Philip IV
1656–1673 Enea Silvio Piccolomini

Spanish dukedom (1902–present)

The title was revived as Duque de Amalfi by Alfonso XIII of Spain in 1902.
 1902–1912 Fulgencio Fuster y Fontes
 1912–1945 Antonio de Zayas y Beaumont 
 1945–1959 Luis Moreno y Zayas
 1959–1996 María del Carmen Cotoner y Cotoner
 1996–2004 Íñigo Seoane y Cotoner
 2004–present Íñigo Seoane García

As with other Spanish noble titles, the dukedom of Amalfi initially descended according to cognatic primogeniture, meaning that females could inherit the title if they had no brothers (or if their brothers had no issue). That changed in 2006, since when the eldest child (regardless of gender) can automatically succeed to noble family titles.
