History 
Howard was the first public school in the Chattanooga area. The name is drawn from Civil War General Oliver O. Howard, as is Howard University. The school was founded under the leadership of Reverend E. O. Tade. Reverend Tade worked extensively in establishing a ministry in the Chattanooga region, being employed by the American Missionary Association and the Freedman's Aid Commission. His work began as an outreach to local ministries and broadened to beginning Howard School in 1865.

Academics 
Howard school is split up into four academies. First, there is the 9th Grade Academy, in which all freshmen are automatically placed. At the end of a student's freshman year, they are required to pick an academy. They may choose between an Engineering/Vocational-focused academy, an IT-focused academy, or a Health/Human Services academy.
Howard was the home of Johnny Taylor, Terdell Sands and Reggie White.

Documentary Film: "Build Me a World" 
On August 16, 2012 the Tivoli Theater in Chattanooga was packed for the premiere of a documentary on the Howard School entitled, "Build Me a World."  The film was created by Fancy Rhino with granting from a MakeWork grant and private gifts through the Ceros Fund.  The experiences of three seniors through their final year at Howard comprise the storyline.  "Build Me a World" was produced in order to call attention to the school's historical significance as one of the oldest public schools for African-Americans in the US (1865), to the turnaround in the graduation rate from 20% to 88% over the last six years, and to the particular needs of the school for help as it seeks to prepare students from difficult circumstances for better academic and professional opportunities in the future.  Over 90% of the student body lives in poverty, and incoming freshmen typically enter with a third-grade reading level.  Students were not only subjects in the project but also participated in the filming process.
