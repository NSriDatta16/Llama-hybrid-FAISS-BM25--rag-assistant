Group E of the 2006 FIFA World Cup began on 12 June and completed on 22 June 2006. Eventual champions Italy won the group and advanced to the round of 16 along with second-placed Ghana. The Czech Republic and the United States failed to advance. Due to the calibre of the teams involved, this was one of two groups at the 2006 World Cup considered to be a group of death (along with Group C).

Standings

Italy vs United States
Italy midfielder Daniele De Rossi was sent off in the 28th minute after elbowing U.S. striker Brian McBride in a rash challenge that left the American with blood all over his face and requiring three stitches under his left eye.
