History
It was officially opened in 1987 as Hyperdome Shopping Centre and has had incremental expansions over time. It underwent subsequent development and expansion between 1997 and 1999. In 2006 when Centro became managers as well as part owners of the shopping centre, a minor redevelopment of the shopping centre was completed. The development included refurbishment of the inner and outer facades, additional retail stores, new Centro Signature sections and construction also began on a new dining and entertainment precinct along Anketell Street. This outdoor precinct was later named SouthLife on Anketell. From 1 December 2016 Leda Holdings regained full ownership and management of the centre. It was renamed South.Point on 10 May 2018. (although many locals who lived in the area before May 2018 still call it the Hyperdome).
