Lycia Naff (born August 29, 1962) is an American dancer, actress, and journalist. She is best known as an actress for a two-episode role as Ensign Sonya Gomez on Star Trek: The Next Generation and for an appearance as a three-breasted prostitute in Total Recall. Her journalism career includes early work on the Bill Cosby sexual assault cases story in 2014 with her interview of actress and rape survivor Barbara Bowman.

Biography

Acting
Her acting career began as a dancer in the 1982 television series Fame. She appeared as Dixie, a prostitute in the 1987 film Lethal Weapon and as TC in Troma's 1989 Chopper Chicks in Zombietown. In 1989 she appeared as Ensign Sonya Gomez on two episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation in 1989, a role she would return to in 2021 to voice Captain Sonya Gomez on the animated series Star Trek: Lower Decks.

Her small role as Mary, a triple-breasted mutant prostitute in Paul Verhoeven's 1990 motion picture Total Recall gained her immediate fame and interview requests from even Johnny Carson to appear on his show, all of which she turned down, only to later regret having done so. After Total Recall she earned a Daytime Emmy nomination for her part in the 1990 ABC Afterschool Special The Perfect Date.

In 2007 she guest starred in Without A Trace. She also appeared in recurring episodes of St. Elsewhere, Hunter, General Hospital and The Young and the Restless.

Journalism
As her acting career took a downturn in the mid 1990s, she went to study journalism at Florida Atlantic University, graduating from then Palm Beach Atlantic College. She has since worked as a reporter for publications like The Palm Beach Post, Sun Sentinel, The Miami Herald and People.

Naff interviewed the first of Bill Cosby's rape victims and survivors, actress Barbara Bowman in 2014.
