His next post was as Chief Executive of the Industrial Society (now renamed The Work Foundation) between 1986 and 1991, after which he became Chief Executive of Calderdale and Kirklees Training and Enterprise Council (1991–1996), then of the Leeds Training and Enterprise Council (1996–2000).

Graham criticised Rishi Sunak appointing Suella Braverman as Home Secretary in 2022, Graham said “Normally the prime minister would have consulted a ministerial adviser for advice. A breach of the ministerial code is seen as a serious matter and would make any minister an inappropriate appointment to one of the four most senior positions in government.”
