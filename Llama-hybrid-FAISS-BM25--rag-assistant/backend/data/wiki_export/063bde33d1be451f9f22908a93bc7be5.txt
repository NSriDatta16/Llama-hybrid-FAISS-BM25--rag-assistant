History 
The club was immediately admitted to the AFFA Supreme League after its formation. They finished 8th in 2004/05 and 9th in 2005/06. In 2006 the club also played in the UEFA Intertoto Cup due to the rejection of several Azerbaijan clubs in this competition. Although it was successful in winning the home game against Moldovan Tiraspol in the first stage (1:0), the club lost in Moldova (1:2) and thus, was out of the tournament.

The 2006/07 became the most successful season in club history. The team took 5th place and reached the Azerbaijan Cup final, losing 1:0 to FK Khazar Lankaran. Despite the loss, they secured a place in the 2007–08 UEFA Cup season thanks to the fact that FK Khazar Lankaran also won the championship. In the UEFA cup they lost 1:0 on aggregate to Groclin Grodzisk.

On 13 August 2007 UEFA declared the club defunct. However, after AFFA's help, they will participate in the Azerbaijan First Division 2009-10.
