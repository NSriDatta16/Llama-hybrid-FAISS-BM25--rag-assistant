The Institut fran√ßais d'opinion publique (IFOP; ) is an international polling and market research firm, whose motto is "Connection creates value".

It was founded on 1 December 1938 by Jean Stoetzel, former Sorbonne professor, after he met George Gallup in the United States. Its CEO was Laurence Parisot from 1990 until 2016, who was nicknamed "boss of the bosses", when she was the leader of the Mouvement des Entreprises de France, the French employers' trade union.
