For the People is the debut album by American hip hop supergroup Boot Camp Clik. It was released on May 20, 1997, via Priority Records and re-released as Still For the People on April 24, 2007, via Duck Down Music. Recording sessions took place from September 1996 to March 1997 at D&D Studios and at Chung King Studios in New York. Production was handled by Mark "Boogie" Brown, Buckshot, Shawn J Period, Tony Touch, BJ Swan, Shaleek, EZ Elpee, Squia and Louieville Sluggah. The album peaked at number 15 on the Billboard 200 and number 4 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.

Consisting of Buckshot, Cocoa Brovaz, Originoo Gunn Clappaz and Heltah Skeltah, the crew officially organized in 1994, with all eight members appearing on the song "Cession At Da Doghillee" from Smif-N-Wessun's Dah Shinin'. The album features a different sound than that heard on previous Camp-related releases, with the group abandoning their past production crew Da Beatminerz, instead recording with live instrumentation. The sound put off many fans, and the album received mediocre reviews and went on to sell just over 350,000 copies in the United States. The interludes on the album feature snippets from real phone calls received on their official phone line.
