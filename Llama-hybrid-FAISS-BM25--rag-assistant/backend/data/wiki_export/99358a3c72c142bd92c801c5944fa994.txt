Stamping controversy 

Cafeteria staff had been in the practice of stamping the hands of students to indicate their lunch accounts were low or empty. The school stated that a change in payment program software did not allow cafeteria staff members to identify students who qualified for the free and reduced lunch program, he wrote, and some of those students mistakenly had their hands stamped. Upon discovery of the practice, Principal Noelle Roni ordered the cafeteria staff to discontinue stamping students' hands.  The school board dismissed Roni in January 2014. Roni has said that she believes she was fired because of her opposition to the policy, which she has described as disrespectful towards students. In response, the school stated that â€œThis was a grievous mistake, and when it came to light, the food services staff and the software company worked quickly to resolve the issue, The school immediately stopped the past practice of hand stamping, and the software issue was fixed.
