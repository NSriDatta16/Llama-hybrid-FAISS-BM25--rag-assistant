"Poison" is a pop song by Australian female group Bardot and was the first single released from their self-titled debut album (2000). It was written by Darryl Sims and Michael Szumowski, who also produced the track. The single attracted much attention due to its inclusion on the high-rating Popstars program.

"Poison" debuted at number one on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart, where it stayed for two consecutive weeks, and was certified double platinum. It became the sixth highest-selling single of Australia in 2000 and was nominated for "Highest Selling Single" at the 2000 ARIA Music Awards, losing to Madison Avenue's "Don't Call Me Baby". "Poison" was also a success in New Zealand, where it spent three consecutive weeks at number one and was certified platinum. It was released in the United Kingdom on 2 April 2001, debuting and peaking at number 45 the same month.

Music video
The "Poison" music video was created during the filming of Popstars and therefore, the making of the video featured on the program. The video features the five members, each in their own distinct individual sets for the majority of the song – Tiffani is set in a hotel room, Sophie is set in a fairy garden, Sally is set in an authentic room made of bamboo, Katie is set in a futuristic, bright red room and Belinda is set in a disco room, surrounded by shining disco balls. Seconds before the final chorus, Tiffani, Sophie, Katie and Belinda slide down poles into Sally's set and spend the final chorus singing together. Director Mark Hartley received three nominations for Best Video at the ARIA Music Awards of 2000, including one for "Poison".
