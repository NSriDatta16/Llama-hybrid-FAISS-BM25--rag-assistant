In geometry, the tridyakis icosahedron is the dual polyhedron of the nonconvex uniform polyhedron, icositruncated dodecadodecahedron. It has 44 vertices, 180 edges, and 120 scalene triangular faces.

Proportions 
The triangles have one angle of , one of  and one of . The dihedral angle equals . Part of each triangle lies within the solid, hence is invisible in solid models.
