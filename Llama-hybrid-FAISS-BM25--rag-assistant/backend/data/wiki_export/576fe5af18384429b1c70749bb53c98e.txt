Westlake Academy (WA) is an open-enrollment charter school in the United States state of Texas, operating under the International Baccalaureate (IB) curriculum.

Overview
Westlake has three main academic programs: The IB Primary Years Programme (PYP) program lasts from kindergarten to fifth grade, while the IB Middle Years Programme (MYP) program runs from sixth grade to tenth grade. The school has also been certified for the IB Diploma Programme (DP), which began at the start of the 2008-2009 school year with the addition of an eleventh grade and now a twelfth grade. The school's first graduating class was in the 2009-2010 school year.

History and academics
Westlake Academy opened its doors in September 2003 when the Town of Westlake officials took advantage of the state of Texas' acceptance of charter schools and thus became the first and only municipality in the state to receive a charter designation. In 2008 the Texas Education Agency (TEA) renewed the charter until 2016. Westlake Academy became an International Baccalaureate World School in 2006, after it was authorized for the Primary Years Program (PYP). Further accreditation followed in 2007 with the Middle Years Program (MYP) and 2008 for the Diploma Program (DP), making it one of only five schools in the United States to offer all three programs, and the only one in Texas. For 2008, the Academy received an ‘Exemplary' rating from TEA for the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS) tests, the second time it has achieved this. 

On May 23, 2010, Westlake Academy's first senior class of 24 students graduated.

The Academy receives operating funds from the state. The Academy relies heavily on the support of parents and other members of the community. In June 2008 the architectural footprint expanded with the groundbreaking for a new Arts and Science Building, which was operational for the start of the 2009-10 school year. Two new buildings were created and started for the 2014-2015 year.
