Adam () is a town in the region Ad Dakhiliyah, in northeastern Oman.

Adam is a wilayah (province) in the Interior Governorate of Oman. Many prominent Omani figures, including Imam Ahmed bin Said, the founder of the Al Busaidi dynasty, originated from this wilayah. Adam serves as a gateway to Dhofar Governorate and is surrounded by orchards irrigated by aflaj (traditional irrigation system).

The wilayah is named after "Adim al-Ard" which refers to the surface shape of the land. There is another meaning to its name, which is the fertile land located in the middle of the desert. People commonly refer to it as "Al Sakbiyah" due to its fertility throughout the year on one hand, and the influx of guests on the other hand.

The population of Adam is estimated to be around 20,000 people.

Location 
The total area of the state is estimated to be about 15,000 square kilometers, with a large portion of it being occupied by desert. The state of Adam is located in the southernmost part of the Interior Governorate and is considered its main gateway from the south. Due to its strategic location, the (Nizwa - Salalah) road is a vital artery that passes through its center. It is approximately 225 kilometers away from Muscat Governorate, 860 kilometers away from Dhofar Governorate, and about 76 kilometers away from Nizwa State. It is bordered by the states of Nizwa and Manah to the north, Haima and Mahout to the south, Al Mudaybi to the east, and Bahla and Ibri to the west.

History

The history of the Wilayat of Adam dates back to pre-Islamic times. Adam has several meanings in Arabic but most likely means the fertile land. The most notable places are Harrat Al Ain, Harrat al Bousaid, Harrat Al Hawashim, and Harrat Bani Shiban, where several archeological sites have been found, and Harr Al Jamii, which is more recent. The town is  from Muscat on the Salalah road, at the southernmost end of Dakhiliya's border with Sharqiya region. It is the last green oasis before the desert. Here you can see ancient forts, citadels and towers, mosques and deserted traditional souqs. Adam is adjacent to Manah and Bahla to the north, Mahout and Haima in the Al Wusta region to the south, Wilayat Ibri of the Dhahirah region to the southwest and Wilayat at Mudhaibi of the Sharqiya region to the east. Its population numbers 13,000 in 60 villages.

Yaqut al-Hamawi, in his book "Mu'jam al-Buldan" (Dictionary of Countries), described it as "Adam, with the opening of its first and second letters, from the northern regions of Amman." Adam was a center for the convergence of trade caravans coming from the Levant and vice versa during the pre-Islamic era. Sources mention that the Bani Shayban neighborhood was a center for these traders, and this is supported by the discovery of artifacts during the restoration of a mosque near the area, such as swords, horse bridles, and roosters. Its history dates back to the time of the Yarubids.

Historical monuments 
The Al-Jami Mosque, which was built during the Azd period in 717 AH, located in the Al-Busaidi Mosque area, is an architectural masterpiece and a landmark for artistic advancement in the field of architectural engineering. It is also evidence of the Omani people's interest in mosques throughout Al-Ghubra. Other notable mosques in the area include the Al-Mahlabiya bint Abi Safra Mosque, Al-Rahba Mosque, Al-Ghariqa Mosque, Al-Hawashim Mosque, Al-Shabana Mosque, and Al-Rawgha Mosque. Additionally, the region is characterized by the presence of several ancient mud-brick alleys with exquisite architectural designs that have made them withstand natural forces. Among the most important of these alleys are Bani Shiban Alley, Al-Jami Alley, Al-Hawashim Alley, Mabirz Alley, and Al-Majabira Alley.

Forts and Castles 
Adam Fortress, which was built during the reign of the Yaruba dynasty and is located in the heart of the province, is considered a complete heritage landmark. It was established to serve as the seat of government, the residence of the governor, and a place for teaching Sharia law. Due to the strategic location of the province, it was occasionally subjected to tribal harassment, as the tribes coveted its resources. This led the locals to establish fortresses, namely, the Fort of Falaj Al Ain, located on the outskirts of the province from the north, and the Fort of Falaj Al Malih, located on the outskirts of the province from the west. All of these fortresses are situated on the heads of the springs to prevent attackers from gaining control over the water sources of the province.

The ancient defensive fortifications in the state of Adam in the Interior Governorate vary between watchtowers, dawawis, and gates at the entrances of alleys, in addition to the towers and walls surrounding the alleys of the state.

The towers built with mud or Omani stone or both together are a testament to the architectural heritage of the state, where approximately 34 towers have been recorded in different areas of the state, and some of them are still standing to this day. Some of the towers include:

- Rahba Tower

- Majabira Tower
