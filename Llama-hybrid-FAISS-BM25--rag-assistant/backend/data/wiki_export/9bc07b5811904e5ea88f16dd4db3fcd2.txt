City Gallery is an exhibition centre about the planning and development of urban areas in Hong Kong. It is located at Edinburgh Place in Central, Victoria City. It is a public relations effort of the Planning Department of the Hong Kong government.

History
It was previously known as the Hong Kong Planning and Infrastructure Exhibition Gallery () and was set up in 2002 on the ground floor of the City Hall annex building as a temporary exhibition gallery, pending the establishment of a full-fledged permanent exhibition gallery which will occupy the entire City Hall Annex Building. 

To make way for the refurbishment and expansion works at the City Hall Annex, the temporary gallery was relocated to the ground floor of the Murray Road Multi-storey Car Park in mid-2009 to maintain continuous services to the public. 

The permanent gallery reopened in the City Hall annex building on 20th August 2012.

In 2019, the revamp work has been taken in place on the G/F, the 3rd Floor and the 4th Floor and was completed in May 2021.

It's a building consists of fourth floors with various themes, showing numerous exhibits including Planning Eye, Hong Kong Next Century, Sustainable Hong Kong, Coastlines & Skylines and Hong Kong Now and Then etc. Interactive features and devices give visitors the latest information on planning and infrastructure developments in Hong Kong.
