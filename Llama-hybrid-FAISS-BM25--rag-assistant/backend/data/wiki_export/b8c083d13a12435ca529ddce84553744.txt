The Scout section of Scouts Canada is for boys and girls ages 11 to 14 (optional to 16). The program offers two main types of badges, Challenge Badges and Activity badges. The Challenge badges are round whereas the Activity badges are square or diamond-shaped. The Activity badges have two levels indicated by the border colour and shape: red and square-shaped for Voyageur and green and diamond-shaped for Pathfinder. Activity badges are required to achieve 3 out of the 4 awards, the Voyageur Scout Award, the Pathfinder Scout Award and the Chief Scout's Award, the fourth being the World Scout Environment Award.

In order to earn it, the Scout must complete the Climate Change and Emergency Preparedness Challenge badges, do at least 2 of the following badges (Fish and Wildlife, Soil and Water Management, Forestry), make a presentation about how their community is addressing climate change, research a local environment issue and do an 8-hour environmental project with their troop.
