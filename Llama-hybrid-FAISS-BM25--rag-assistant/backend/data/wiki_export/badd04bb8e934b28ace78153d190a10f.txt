The Washington Theological Consortium is an ecumenical organization of Christian theological schools and interfaith partners located in Washington, DC, Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. Members cooperate to deepen ecumenical unity in theological education and to broaden interfaith dialogue and understanding and to prepare both clergy and laity with skills they need to minister in a diverse church and society.  The Consortium is one of the most diverse of its kind in the nation, as it includes Roman and Byzantine Catholic traditions, mainline Protestants, Evangelicals, and Historic Black Divinity schools; with partners in spiritual formation, Jewish, and Islamic education.

A student enrolled at the master's level or above at a member institution may cross-register into courses offered by other member schools.  In addition, a student or faculty member of one member institution may use and borrow from other institutions' libraries. Students (and members of the public) may also enroll in one of four Certificates of Study through the Consortium: Ecumenism, Muslim-Christian Studies, Ecology and Theology, and Criminal Justice and Reconciliation. Events for faculty development, student dialogue, and public education are held throughout the year.

In 2004, the Consortium became the first group of its kind in the United States to include an Islamic graduate school, the Graduate School of Islamic and Social Sciences (GSISS), as an affiliate. The Consortium does shared programming with GSISS--now an institute, and with the Institute for Islamic, Christian, and Jewish Studies in Baltimore, the Paulist Father's House of Mission and Studies, and the Shalem Institute for Spiritual Formation. In 2020, it welcomed the Washington, D.C.-based Museum of the Bible as its first member under the category of "public educational institution."

History
The Washington Theological Consortium was conceived in 1969 in the wake of ecumenical accomplishments by the World Council of Churches, the Faith and Order Commission, the National Council of Churches, and the Second Vatican Council. The founding schools included the Catholic University School of Theology, the Dominican House of Studies, St. Paul's College, Wesley Theological Seminary, Virginia Theological Seminary, the Howard University School of Divinity, and the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Gettysburg. They joined forces to begin cross registration, library sharing, team taught Consortium courses, administrative consultations, and faculty development. In the early 21st century, schools have joined from Baptist, African-American, Reformed, and Byzantine Catholic traditions, and associates and affiliates have joined from institutes of Spirituality and Interfaith work, including the Shalem Institute, GSISS, and the Institute for Islamic Christian and Jewish Studies. In 2020,the Museum of the Bible joined as a "public educational institution."

The Board of Trustees of the Consortium has always included public trustees in order to ensure that its mission remains focused on the needs of both laity and clergy and to avoid competition between the member schools and institutions. These trustees serve to remind all members of the wider, public vision of theological education. Dedicated members of the Board have funded three annual public events: the Tachmindji Event for Interfaith Dialogue, the Figel Lecture in Ecumenism, and the Taha Al-Alwani Lectures in Muslim-Christian Dialogue.

Programs and Services
The Consortium offers services of cross-registration of courses and combined library use among students and faculty of its member schools and institutions. It offers regular consultations between presidents of its schools, academic deans, librarians, and other administrative or affinity groups.  It offers over 250 courses per semester for cross-registration, a dozen theological libraries with 2.2 million books and journals for research, and regular gatherings of school leaders to enhance their collaboration. In addition to member libraries, students and faculty of the Consortium can also draw from other local academic libraries, including Woodstock Theological Library at Georgetown University, the Taha Al-Alwani Library (formerly of GSISS),  and an association with the Library of Congress that allows members to become research partners there.

Theological faculties of member schools are served by the annual Faculties' Convocation, which addresses timely issues of theological education, and by interest area gatherings in Bible, Theology, History, Practical Theology, Worship / Homiletics, Arts and Religion, Science and Religion and more. Faculty area groups in Ecology and in Criminal Justice also oversee the certificates of study in those areas, and the opportunities for team teaching or professor exchanges are coordinated with the academic deans. Joint grant writing and publishing between faculty members are also encouraged through WTC networks.

Students are served through a Student Board, which has representatives from each of the theological schools. The Student Board develops and leads three student events a year: including an Opening Prayer Service and Dinner Conversation, a Sermon Slam, with stellar preachers from each of the schools, and other social or academic events. They also plan and lead the annual Prayer Service for Christian Unity, which precedes the Figel Event on Ecumenism.
