The final

A dramatic final was played between Pakistan and India in Colombo. After Pakistan set a very low target of 110 runs to win for India, a stunning Pakistani bowling performance devastated India's top-order batsmen, taking the first six wickets for nine runs. India was eventually dismissed for 71, enabling Pakistan to become the first country ever to defend the title successfully and become back-to-back champions of the tournament.
