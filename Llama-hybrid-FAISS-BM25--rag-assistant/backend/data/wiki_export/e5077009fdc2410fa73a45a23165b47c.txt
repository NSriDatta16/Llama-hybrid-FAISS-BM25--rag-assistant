AMD Live! is the name of AMD's initiative in 2005 aimed at gathering the support of professional musicians and other media producers behind its hardware products. The primary focus of this initiative was the Opteron server- and workstation-class central processing units (CPUs).

AMD subsequently extended AMD LIVE! into a platform marketing initiative focusing the consumer electronics segment in 2006 and focused on performance segment desktop-class processors. AMD Live! for consumer electronics segment was announced on January 4, 2006 officially through press release.

The AMD Live! is an initiative, which can be divided into two parts, one in terms of software and the other, computer hardware. The software portion focuses on users' internet and multimedia experiences, while the hardware sector focuses on the ability of a system to handle multimedia files and the convergence of consumer electronics (CE) and personal computing (PC) into one computer chassis.

Features
AMD Live! features away mode (as supported by motherboards), the system hibernates when user is not using, and powers up quickly when needed. The AMD Live! also includes a selection of software aimed to enhance the digital entertainment experience named as AMD LIVE! Entertainment Suite, see software section for details.

 Other system components follow the guidelines of subsequent AMD mobile platforms starting from codenamed Kite platform, systems with the platform will be qualified for a better by design sticker as the shown on the right.

AMD LIVE! Home Cinema System
Originally launched at CES in 2007, AMD LIVE! Home Cinema was a platform that combines the functionality of a PC with that of a Home Theater system that integrates a high performance amplifier (up to 5.1 channels) allowing owners to access and store high definition content such as movies and broadcasts, along with DVR/PVR functionality, photos and slide slows, music and internet content out of a single device.

AMD has also pushed an MCE system design named "AMD Home Cinema B media center", which is a collaborative project with MCE system builders, including AMD hardware (AMD processors, ATI Radeon graphics with hardware High-definition video decoding) and pre-installed with Windows Vista Home Premium, and AMD branded chassis (manufactured by ACE computers), to be released in 2007.

The AMD LIVE! Home Cinema system has the following specifications:
 AMD Athlon 64 X2 CPU

Related initiatives

AMD LIVE! Ready
Prior to the beginning of CeBIT 2007 in Hanover, Germany on March 15, 2007, AMD has announced the "AMD LIVE! ready" program, for other peripherals or system components, items which are certified for AMD Live! systems can include the AMD LIVE! Ready program logo (shown on the right) on the package to allow customers to identify the products recommended for AMD LIVE! systems.

Some of the supporting companies including Gigabyte Technology, Buffalo Technology, Corel Corporation, Creative Technology, D-Link Systems, Nero AG, Netgear, NVIDIA, Orb Networks, Seagate, TerraTec, and ZyXEL.

Product categories in the AMD LIVE! Ready program include:
Set-top boxes
Portable media players
Music Devices, such as MP3 players
Network Devices
TV tuners
Storage Devices, such as harddisks and optical disc drives
Webcams or web cameras
Software applications for Windows Vista

Active TV initiative
The announcement of Active TV initiative has also taken place prior to CeBIT 2007, the initiative allows online video watching such as YouTube, ROO, Veoh and VMIX, allowing users to create customized "TV-web channels", and provide to hardware developers a "value-added" solution as software that is embedded on networked entertainment devices, such as HDTVs, set-top-boxes, and game consoles. Active TV software can for example be loaded on a game CD for a game console, such as the home network connected PS2 (provided by BroadQ). The console then pulls video, music, and image content from the Internet, via a networked PC running Active TV software. The support of such functions for Xbox 360 and Wii platforms is projected at a later time.

AMD has started a webpage about the initiative and provided a simulator for Windows XP and Vista download. (Active-TV page)
