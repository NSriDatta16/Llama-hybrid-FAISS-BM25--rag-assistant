Sugar Daddy is a candy bar on a stick manufactured by Tootsie Roll Industries that is essentially a moderately hard brick of caramel similar to a Slo Poke, the "All Day Sucker". 

A bite-sized caramel-flavored jelly bean candy based on the Sugar Daddy is marketed under the name Sugar Babies.

History 
The Sugar Daddy was created in 1925 by The James O. Welch Company and was originally called a "papa sucker." In 1932, the company changed the candy's name to Sugar Daddy. According to Tootsie Roll Inc, the name change suggested "a wealth of sweetness." The James O. Welch Company was purchased by Nabisco (now MondelÄ“z International) in 1963. The Welch brands were sold to Warner-Lambert in 1988; Tootsie Roll Industries acquired them in 1993.
