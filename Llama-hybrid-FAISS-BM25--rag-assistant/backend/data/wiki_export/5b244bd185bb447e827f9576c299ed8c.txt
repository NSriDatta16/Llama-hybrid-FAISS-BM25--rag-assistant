"Victim of Love" is a song by English synth-pop duo Erasure, released on 18 May 1987 as their sixth single overall. It was the third single to be lifted from the duo's second studio album, The Circus (1987), released six weeks earlier, and was remixed for single release. Written by band members Vince Clarke and Andy Bell, it incorporates the signature Erasure sound of uptempo rhythm, analogue synthesizer and a prominent acoustic guitar. Bell's lyrics pertain to one's apprehension when entering into a new love relationship. The song's protagonist doesn't "want to look like some kind of fool" or become a "victim of love". Upon its release, it became the second UK Top 10 single for Erasure, peaking at number seven. It also hit number one on the US Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart (Clarke and Bell would have to wait eighteen years before their second US Dance chart-topper). The song remains one of Erasure's signature songs and is a concert favourite.

Critical reception
Chris Gerard from Metro Weekly wrote, ""Victim of Love" is a perfect pop single; Bell's soulful vocals shine, the melody is catchy and memorable, and the track has an insistent rhythm buoyed (like their breakthrough single, "Sometimes") by a strong acoustic guitar part."
