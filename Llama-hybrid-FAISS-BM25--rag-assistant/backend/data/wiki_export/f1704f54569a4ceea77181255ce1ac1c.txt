Jiangsu Lemote Tech Co., Ltd or Lemote () is a computer company established as a joint venture between the Jiangsu Menglan Group and the Chinese Institute of Computing Technology, involved in computer hardware and software products, services, and projects.

History

In June 2006, shortly after Institute of Computing Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences developed Loongson 2E they need a company to build end product, so the Jiangsu Menglan Group began a joint venture with the Institute of Computing Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The venture was named Jiangsu Lemote Tech Co., Ltd.

A computer was announced by Fuxin Zhang, an ICT researcher also a Lemote staff, who said the purpose of this project was to "provide everyone with a personal computer".  The device is intended for low income groups and rural area students.

Hardware
Lemote builds small form factor computers including network computers and netbooks with Loongson Processors.

Netbook computers

The Yeeloong netbook computer is intended to be built on free software from the BIOS upwards, and for this reason is used and recommended by the founder of Free Software Foundation, Richard Stallman as of September 2008 and 23 January 2010.

The specifications are:

Loongson 3A laptop

Loongson insiders revealed a new model based on the Loongson 3A quad-core laptop has been developed and was expected to launch in August 2011. With a similar design to the MacBook Pro from Apple Inc., it will carry a Linux operating system by default.

In September 2011, Lemote announced the Yeeloong-8133 13.3" laptop featuring 900 MHz, quad-core Loongson-3A/2GQ CPU.

Desktop computers
Lynloong, all-in-one desktop computer, combined computer and monitor, without keyboard.
Myloong, desktop diskless network computer (NC), without monitor or keyboard.
Fuloong, see below.

Products in development
Hiloong, SOHO and family storage center.

The specifications are:

Software
Lemote has participated in development and MIPS-porting of Debian GNU/Linux, eCos, MicroC/OS-II, VxWorks, Microsoft Windows CE, Java, OpenOffice.org and Yongzhong Office by Wuxi Yongzhong Tech Co. It also develops a Loongson processor simulator based on GXemul. In part to its ability to run only libre software, without proprietary binary blobs, Richard Stallman famously used the Lemote Yeeloong.
