New York's 18th congressional district is a congressional district for the United States House of Representatives that contains the northern suburbs and exurbs of New York City. It is currently represented by Democrat Pat Ryan.

The 18th district includes all of Orange County, and most of Dutchess and Ulster Counties. The district includes the cities of Newburgh, Beacon, Kingston, and Poughkeepsie.

In the August 23, 2022 Democratic Party primary Ulster County executive Pat Ryan defeated Aisha Mills and Moses Mugulusi. On the same date Ryan also defeated Dutchess County executive Marc Molinaro (Republican) in a special election to fill a vacant seat in the district. The latter contest was seen as a victory in a bellwether district. In the November 8, 2022 general election Ryan defeated New York State Assembly member Republican Colin Schmitt.

Republican Molinaro ran in the New York's 19th congressional district in the November general election and defeated Democrat Josh Riley. Incumbent Sean Patrick Maloney changed his election district to the New York's 17th congressional district, after redistricting maps were announced.

The 18th District was created in 1813.  For many years it was the upper Manhattan district. It was the east side Manhattan seat in the 1970s and then a Bronx district in the 1980s, Following the 1992 remap it became a Westchester-based district with narrow corridor through the Bronx and a large portion of central Queens. The 2002 remap gave those Queens areas to the 5th District and the 18th absorbed some Rockland areas due to the deconstruction of the old Orange-Rockland 20th District. In 2012, population lost in New York pushed the district further north, into the mid-Hudson Valley suburbs. From 2002 to 2013, the 18th district included most of Westchester County and part of Rockland County. It included Larchmont, Mamaroneck, New Rochelle, Ossining, the Town of Pelham, Scarsdale, Tarrytown, White Plains as well as most of New City and Yonkers.

The redrawn district is composed of the following percentages of voters of the 2003-2013 congressional districts: 1 percent from the 18th congressional district; 76 percent from the 19th congressional district; 2 percent from the 20th congressional district; and 21 percent from the 22nd congressional district.
