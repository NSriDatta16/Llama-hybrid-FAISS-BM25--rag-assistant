Live & Rare is a compilation album by American nu metal band Korn, released on May 9, 2006. It features 13 tracks: all seven from the DVD featuring 2003's CBGB show in New York, which are found on special editions of Greatest Hits Vol. 1, two from Woodstock 1999, three cover songs (one a hidden track from Follow the Leader and another a hidden track from Take a Look in the Mirror), and "Proud", taken from the I Know What You Did Last Summer soundtrack.

The compilation was released after Korn left Epic Records, so it is likely the band had no contributions to the track listing. Also, there is no new material on this album, and most of the tracks are available on other releases, thus sales of the compilation were disappointing.

As of May 31, 2006, it has sold nearly 52,000 total copies in the United States.
