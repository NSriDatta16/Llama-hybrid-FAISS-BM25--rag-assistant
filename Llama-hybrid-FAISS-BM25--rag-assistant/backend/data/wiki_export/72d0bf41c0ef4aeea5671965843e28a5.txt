Suzanne Bennett (1893–1974) (also known as Lady Hubert Wilkins) was an Australian-born actress who achieved success on Broadway in the United States in the 1920s. She was born Susannah Catherine Evans in the goldfields town of Walhalla, Victoria to John Evans (a miner) and Alice Louisa Whitlow. She had four siblings (sisters Mabel and Edith; and brothers John and Arthur).

She took the name Bennett from her 1915 marriage to 20-year-old soldier, Private Oscar Bennett (AIF service number 381). At the time of their marriage she was living in St. Kilda, Victoria. Oscar Bennett survived the war, returning to Australia in 1919. At this time, Suzanne Bennett had worked on stage in Australia, first in the chorus of the Rigo Grand Opera Company, and later with Hugh D. McIntosh's productions.
However, her marriage to Oscar was an unhappy one and a divorce was finally granted in early 1922. By 1923, Suzanne was in New York looking for work. Within a year, she was performing in Broadway productions.

Bennett met the celebrated explorer Sir George Hubert Wilkins on 20 June 1928, in New York City during a reception honoring Wilkins after his famed flight over the Arctic Sea. The couple were sufficiently famous to warrant a marriage announcement in the 9 September 1929 issue of Time magazine. There it was reported that the famous Australian couple had wed in Cleveland, Ohio. That notice also credits Ms. Bennett with having appeared on stage in Vanities and The Cyclone Lover.

After her 30 August 1929 marriage she was known as Lady Hubert Wilkins, living with Sir Hubert in New York City. In her later years, she and Sir Hubert spent their summers living on a  rural converted farm in the Endless Mountains area of Rush Township, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, a property she and Sir Hubert purchased in the 1950s. Lady Suzanne Wilkins was a gifted portrait artist, and did many paintings during her lifetime. She suffered a stroke in 1972, which left her blind. She was cared for by Winston Ross – Sir Hubert's former personal secretary – and his wife Marley Ross, relocating to Southern California. She died in Orange County, California in December 1974, and her ashes were scattered at the North Pole from the US Navy submarine  on 4 May 1975, as were her husband's from  in 1959.

The couple had no children during their twenty-nine years of marriage.
