 The Livonia Observer, Livonia, Michigan, ceased printing in December 2022, but an online edition persists.  That paper had an circulation of over 14,000.  It was part of a larger slaughter of local newspapers.  Gannett shut six newspapers down in a stroke.  "The publisher said publications will continue online and there were no new layoffs associated with the print finale. Currently are only five reporters to cover the communities that number about one million people. Gannett said  they will maintain print editions in Northville, Novi, Milford and South Lyon."
