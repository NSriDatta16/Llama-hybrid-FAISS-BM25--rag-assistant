Greatest Misses is a compilation album of songs by American new wave band Devo, released in 1990 by Warner Bros. Records. Greatest Misses contains lesser-known tracks and alternate versions of tracks from other albums. It has a Parental Advisory label because of the song "Penetration in the Centrefold".

The album booklet includes several photos from previous albums, and the second half of an article on the band by Howie Klein for BAM magazine. The first half of this article appears in the booklet for Devo's Greatest Hits.
