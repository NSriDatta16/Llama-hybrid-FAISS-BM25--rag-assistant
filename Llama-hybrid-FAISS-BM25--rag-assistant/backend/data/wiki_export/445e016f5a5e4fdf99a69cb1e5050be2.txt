Controversy

Alcohol and drugs 
In October 1995, two 12-year-old boys were suspended for dealing with drugs. It followed a string of other drug-related incidents. In 1994, a 16-year-old was expelled for drug dealing, then re-admitted. Also that year, four pupils were suspended over claims of drug taking, and a 15-year-old boy was arrested outside school and charged with possessing cannabis." Eight pupils who smoked cannabis on a school trip to Alton Towers were suspended for a fortnight following a disciplinary hearing at the school in June 1998.

Black Lives Matter 
An investigation by East Dunbartonshire Council started on 4 June 2020 after Lenzie Academy's physics department account published a tweet which reportedly mocked the Take the Knee campaign. The campaign had taken off after the murder of George Floyd a week previously in the USA. The tweet, which has since been deleted along with the account itself, stated: "#TaketheKnee? Aye you can f*** right off". The council confirmed that they had reported the incident to the police. The local MP, Amy Callaghan, said that she had contacted the council and the school headmaster about the tweet, and that she had also heard from students of the school about their experience of racism.

Bullying and gang issues 
The school has also received continuing attention for problems with gangs/bullying as well as knife crime.

In 2016, a boy aged 14 years old was reported to the police after a knife incident at the school.

The suicide of Nicola Ann Raphael, a pupil at Lenzie Academy, in 2001 was heavily covered in local and national press and came after Raphael had suffered years of bullying.

School buildings
The current red brick Academy building was built in 1960 and extensions have been added to it over the years.
 The original school building dating from when the Academy was founded in 1886 has since served as Lenzie Primary school.
More than 110 years after opening the school admitted its first physically disabled student in 1996 which meant the school had to install a lift and ramps to make the whole building accessible.

Head teachers
There have been ten head teachers of Lenzie Academy. For 125 years until 2011, the head teacher was referred to as Rector.
