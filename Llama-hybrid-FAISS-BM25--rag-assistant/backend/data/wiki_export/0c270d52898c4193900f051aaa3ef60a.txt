Tribes
Amarlu has been one of the dominant Kurmanj tribes in Gilan Province. According to Rabino, the Rashvands formed another inhabitant of the region too.
Rišvand formed part of the Bâbân tribe of Solaymâniya and were moved to Gilân by Shah 'Abbâs I. Later, they were chased out of most of their choice pasturelands by the 'Amârlu, who were moved to Gilân from northwestern Persia by Nâder Shah (Rabino, 1916–17, pp. 260–61; tr., pp. 304–6). The Rišvand now live mostly in Qazvin province. The 'Amârlu occupy some fifty villages between Menjil and Pirâkuh in southeastern Gilân. (See Fortescue, pp. 319–20; Mardukh Kordestâni, I, pp. 100–1; Afšâr Sistâni, pp. 132–34.)
