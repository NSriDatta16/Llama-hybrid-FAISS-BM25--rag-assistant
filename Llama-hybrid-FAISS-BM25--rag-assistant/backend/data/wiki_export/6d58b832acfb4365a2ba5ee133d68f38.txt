Professional career

Texas Rangers

In 2000, he attended the Hiroshima Toyo Carp's academy in the Dominican Republic, and he appeared in two games for the Carp in 2002.

New York Yankees
Ramírez began his minor league career in 2003 with the Tampa Yankees of the single-A advanced Florida State League. After he had a 2–8 record, a 5.21 earned run average (ERA), 21 strikeouts, and  innings pitched in 14 starts, he was promoted to the Trenton Thunder of the Double-A Eastern League. With the Thunder, he had a 1–1 record, a 1.69 ERA, 21 strikeouts, and  innings pitched in four games (three starts), and this earned him a promotion to the Columbus Clippers of the triple-A International League. In two games (one start) with Columbus, he had an 0–1 record, a 4.50 ERA, five strikeouts, and six innings pitched. He finished his first minor league season with a 3–10 record, a 4.43 ERA, 96 strikeouts, and  innings pitched in 20 games (18 starts).
