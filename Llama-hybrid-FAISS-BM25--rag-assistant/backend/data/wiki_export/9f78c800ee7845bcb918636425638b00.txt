He began the following season with the Royals before being traded to the San Diego Padres for Brian Meadows. Overall between the two teams, Witasick was 6–10 with a 5.82 ERA in 150 innings. In 2001, he was converted into a reliever full time, and was traded midseason by the Padres to the New York Yankees for D'Angelo Jiménez. In a career high 63 appearances between both teams, he was 8–2 with 106 strikeouts in 79 innings.
