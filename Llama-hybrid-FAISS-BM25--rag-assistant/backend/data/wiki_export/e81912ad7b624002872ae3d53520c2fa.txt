"Here I Go Again" is a song by British rock band Whitesnake. Originally released on their 1982 album, Saints & Sinners, the power ballad was re-recorded for their 1987 self-titled album. It was re-recorded again the same year in a new "radio-mix" version, which was released as a single and hit No.1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart on 10 October 1987 (the band's only No.1 on that chart), and also No.9 on the UK Singles Chart on 28 November 1987. The 1987 version also hit No.1 on the Canadian Singles Chart on 24 October 1987.

In 2003, Q magazine ranked it 962nd on their list of 1001 "Best Songs Ever". In 2006, the 1987 version was ranked No.17 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of the '80s. In the 2012 Reader's Poll of Rolling Stone it ranked as 9th among the Top 10 "The Best Hair Metal Songs of All Time". In 2017, The Daily Telegraph included it among Top 21 best power ballads.

Background and writing
The song was written by the lead singer, David Coverdale, and former Whitesnake guitarist, Bernie Marsden. The most notable difference between the original and re-recorded versions are a slight change in the bluesy lyrics and pace. The re-recording of the song in 1987 was advised by record labels bosses Al Coury and David Geffen as a negotiation deal with Coverdale to re-record "Crying in the Rain" for the band's self-titled album Whitesnake released in 1987.

The chorus of the original version features the lines:

And here I go again on my own
Goin' down the only road I've ever known
Like a hobo I was born to walk alone

In an interview, Coverdale explained that initially the lyrics had "drifter" but as that was already used in different songs he decided to use "hobo" instead. However, the lyric was changed back to "drifter" in the re-recorded '87 version, reportedly to ensure that it would not be misheard as "homo".

The song was used in the climax of romantic comedy film Man Up (2015).

Composition 
The song is composed in the key of G major and a tempo of 91 BPM.

Music video
The '82 music video features the band performing the song onstage. The music video for the '87 re-recorded version was directed by Marty Callner. The video includes, besides the band's stage performance, appearances by model Julie E. "Tawny" Kitaen, who was married to Whitesnake's David Coverdale from 1989 to 1991. Her notable sex-appeal was immediately recognized, having memorable unchoreographed scenes dressed "in a white negligee, writhing and cartwheeling across the hoods of two Jaguars XJ" which belonged to Coverdale (white) and Callner (black). Coverdale recalls that he even brought choreographer Paula Abdul to the set to show some moves to Coverdale's girlfriend Tawny, but only to positively exclaim that she couldn't "show her anything". Coverdale's iconic white Jaguar once again appeared in the music video for single "Shut Up & Kiss Me" from their 2019 studio album Flesh & Blood.

The song's 1987 music video was listed as one of the 15 Essential Hair-Metal Videos by the New York Times.

 A 1987 "radio-mix" version, asked for by Geffen, which was released as a United States single with Denny Carmassi on drums and Dann Huff on guitar, who also provided the new arrangement, which included an intro without keyboards and no Coverdale vocal intro verse. This version topped the charts, and appeared on the Greatest Hits album in 1994 (3:54).

In 1987, EMI released a limited Collectors Poster Edition 'USA Single Remix' 7" vinyl [EMP 35], the B-side of which consists of an engraved signature version, and the sleeve of which unfolds into a poster of the band.
