Vince's Bridge was a wooden bridge constructed by Allen Vince over Vince Bayou near Harrisburg, Texas. Its destruction by Texian Army Rangers played a critical role during the April 1836 Battle of San Jacinto in the decisive defeat of the Mexican army, which effectively ended the Texas Revolution. Located on the most likely possible route of escape for Antonio LÃ³pez de Santa Anna and his column of the Mexican army, the burning of Vince's Bridge helped prevent his soldiers from reaching the safety of nearby reinforcements.  The bridge appears on the reverse of the state Seal of Texas.
