Saint Peter-Marian Central Catholic Junior-Senior High School, was a private, coeducational Catholic junior high and senior high school in Worcester, Massachusetts, United States. The school was more commonly referred to as St. Peter-Marian, or informally as SPM or St. Peter's.  It was one of four high schools operated by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Worcester and was accredited by The New England Association of Schools & Colleges in 1969. After the 2019-2020 school year, SPM closed and merged with Holy Name. The school that they created is called Saint Paul’s, it is on the Holy Name campus.

Campus and location
The campus formerly occupied by Saint Peter-Marian's is situated upon a hill in a residential neighborhood on Grove St in Worcester, less than one mile from the border with the town of Holden, Massachusetts. There is one main building with an annex that housed both the senior and junior high school. The campus also contained a football field, a baseball field, a softball field and a large parking lot.

History
The name Saint Peter-Marian comes from the two schools that formed it: Saint Peter's High School and Marian High School. There are four dates on the SPM seal. The year 1921 refers to the year in which Saint Peter's High School was established, on Main Street. St Peter's was a coeducational parish school operated by the Sisters of St. Joseph. The building is now occupied by St. Peter Central Catholic Elementary School. The year 1963 refers to the year in which Marian High School was built, an all-female school which was located on the Grove Street site of Saint Peter-Marian. Marian High School had a freshman class of 97 young women; the school was operated by the Sisters of Mercy. The year 1976 refers to the merging of St. Peter's High School and Marian High School to form Saint Peter-Marian High School. The year 1989 refers to the time at which the junior high school was implemented.

In 2003 the campus was expanded through the purchase of a nearby nursing home, which was extensively renovated and served as the building for the junior high school. The Junior High later moved back into the senior high school building. The school leased the old nursing home to Little Ones Child Care, a childcare agency.

In December 2019 the Archdiocese of Worcester announced that the school would close at the end academic year and merge with Holy Name, creating a new school to be named St Paul Diocesan Junior/Senior High School. The new school is located at the campus of Holy Name in Worcester.
