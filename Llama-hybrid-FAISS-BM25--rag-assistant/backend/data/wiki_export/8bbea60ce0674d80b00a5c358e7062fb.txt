Mandurah railway station is the terminus of the Mandurah railway line and a bus station on the Transperth network, serving the satellite city of Mandurah, Western Australia.

History

The bus station opened prior to the railway station, on 17 September 2003, replacing a temporary bus terminus located nearby in the carpark of Rushton Park.

The railway station later opened on the same site as the bus station, on 23 December 2007 by Premier Alan Carpenter alongside the rest of the Mandurah railway line. The car park was also significantly expanded for the opening of the railway station.

In 2020, construction started on a $32 million multi-storey car park for Mandurah station as part of Metronet. When complete, the car park will add approximately 700 bays, and have three levels. During construction, a temporary car park was built west of Galgoyl Road to replace some of the car bays removed during construction. The car park opened in November 2021.
