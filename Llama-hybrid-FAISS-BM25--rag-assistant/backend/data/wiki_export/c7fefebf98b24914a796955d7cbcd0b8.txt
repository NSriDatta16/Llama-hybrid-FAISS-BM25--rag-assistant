Live Phish Vol. 13 was an album recorded live at the Glens Falls Civic Center in Glens Falls, New York on Halloween night, 1994. It was released on October 29, 2002, along with Volume 14, Volume 15, and Volume 16.

It marks the first of six Halloween shows in which Phish dressed up in a "musical costume" by performing an album from another artist in its entirety. The band took votes from fans via snail mail (50 votes), leading to a complete performance of the 30-song, self-titled Beatles double album, also known as the White Album, sandwiched in between two sets of Phish's own music. The album's final number, "Good Night", is not included on this release, as it was not actually played by Phish, but rather the studio recording was played over the PA at the conclusion of the set.

Phish took few liberties in covering the album with the exception of "Don't Pass Me By" and "Birthday". "Don't Pass Me By" was played in double-time while "Birthday" was slowed down and played in a minor key without lyrics as the band presented a birthday cake on stage to Phish road manager Brad Sands. "Helter Skelter" concludes with the line "I've got blisters on my fingers" sung in barbershop harmony.

The concert had a stated start time of 9:30 p.m. and ended at 3:20 a.m.â€”the longest Phish concert up to that point.  This is also the longest volume in the Live Phish Series consisting of material from one night (Volume 16 is the longest including filler) clocking in at just over four hours.

This album is one of 10 "live jam releases of this century" according to the August 2006 issue of Guitar One magazine.
