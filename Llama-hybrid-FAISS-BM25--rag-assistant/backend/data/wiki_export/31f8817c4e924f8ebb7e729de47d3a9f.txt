The Big Bull was a large (14 metres Ã— 21 metres) Holstein bull fibreglass model located near Wauchope, New South Wales, Australia. When open, it contained a gift shop on the ground floor and a beef display.

It was located just off the Oxley Highway between Wauchope and the Pacific Highway. The structure was torn down in October 2007.

The Big Bull notably had a swinging set of testicles.
