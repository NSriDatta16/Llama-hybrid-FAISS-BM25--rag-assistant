This company generates electric power from water (hydro-electric power) and distributes it to approximately thirty-four million people of the area. MEPCO is a licensee who has been granted a license by the NEPRA for the distribution of electricity exclusively to service territory spread over thirteen administrative districts of Southern Punjab.

History 
Multan Electric Power Company was founded as Multan Power Supply Company during British India-era. In 1972, the company was nationalized. Subsequently, it was taken over by the Government of Pakistan. It was publicly listed on Karachi Stock Exchange until 1985 when it was de-listed from the exchange.
 
On 14 May 1998, Government of Pakistan decided to go with the corporatization of the energy sector in Pakistan. MEPCO was established to acquire all properties, rights, assets, obligations, and liabilities of the defunct Multan Area Electricity Board, grid stations, and transmission lines of the supply system. After 24 years of service in 2022, MEPCO has been directly and exclusively supplying electricity to 34 million people in 13 districts of South Punjab.
