Noah version

In 2012, Peterpan changed their name to Noah. Due to several reasons, such as wanting their old song to be released under Noah name, a desire to improve the recordings since some songs were not recorded the way they wished, and in order to properly adapt their old songs to digital format, Noah re-recorded their songs from Peterpan era. Noah's version of Bintang di Surga was released on 12 January 2022.

In the new Noah version of the album, there are two songs not included in the track listing, which are ‘Aku’ and ‘Masa Lalu Tertinggal’. There was no explanation at the moment, depicting on why these two tracks were not included in the new album.

Track listing
All tracks are written by Ariel, except for "Aku" which is written by Ariel and Andika and "Masa Lalu Tertinggal" which is written by Ariel and Indra.
