There have been 115 hurricanes or tropical storms that affected the U.S. state of New Jersey. Due to its location, few hurricanes have hit the state directly, though numerous hurricanes have passed near or through New Jersey in its history. About every 10 years, hurricanes approach the coastline close enough to send waves over barrier islands' dunes and into back bays. According to an estimate by meteorologist George Prouflis, the chances for a direct hit by a hurricane on the Jersey Shore each year is 1 in 200.

New Jersey has seen the remnants of several once-powerful hurricanes, some resulting in heavy damage. Nine storms dropped over  of rainfall in the state, including a hurricane in 1940 that interacted with a cold front and dropped  of rainfall in Ewan. Numerous hurricanes that remained offshore have each drowned small numbers of swimmers.
