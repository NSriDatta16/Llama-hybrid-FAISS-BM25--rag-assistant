History

Like nearby Chiasso, Vacallo was formerly a suburb of Como, until, along with the rest of Ticino it was then annexed from Italian cities in the 15th century by various Swiss forces in the last transalpine campaigns of the Old Swiss Confederacy. More precisely it was 1416 when it was incorporated in the Pieve of Balerna and given to the Rusca family to manage.  In the Helvetic Republic, established 1798, it formed part of the canton of Lugano. The creation of the Swiss Confederation in 1803 saw a merger with neighbouring canton of Bellinzona to form the modern canton of Ticino.

Due to its proximity with the Italian border, Vacallo was a tense place to be during World War II but since then has turned into a sleepy suburb of Chiasso.

In 2007, the three mayors of Chiasso, Vacallo and Morbio Inferiore decided to unite into one commune.

The new united commune which would have had a population of approximately 15,300 people over a territory of , was voted against by the population in November 2007.
