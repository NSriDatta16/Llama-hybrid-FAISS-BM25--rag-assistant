Critical reception
LA Weekly wrote: "The Fireball Ministry sound is dry, heavy and stripped-down, brutal enough to match modern metal mutants like Queens of the Stone Age and Machine Head, but sufficiently song oriented to click with anyone enamored of Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden or any other classic hard-rock band you’d care to name."
