"It Feels So Good" is a song by British singer Sonique. It was originally released on 9 November 1998 and peaked at number 24 on the UK Singles Chart. In May 2000, in the wake of the song's success in the United States, the single was re-released and spent three weeks at number one on the same chart. The song remained in the top 40 for 14 weeks and became the third-biggest-selling single of 2000 in Britain. It has sold over 800,000 copies in the UK as of May 2020.

The song also proved successful in many other countries, including the United States, where repeated radio airplay in Florida helped it reach number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 and led Sonique to sign with Republic Records. In 2017, BuzzFeed listed the song at number 33 in their list of "The 101 Greatest Dance Songs of the '90s".

Background and content
Sonique said of the song, "It's about this guy whom I really liked years ago, but who didn't return my feelings. For he was very successful and I wasn't — at that time. And he thought that I was in love with his success. This song is just a way of declaring that it was him I liked." The song received widespread acclaim after it was played by a Tampa, Florida deejay in February 2000. Because of the song's popularity, Sonique was approached by Universal Music executives Doug Morris and Jimmy Iovine. She was eventually signed to Universal, and her album Hear My Cry was the first to be released on Universal's new internet-based record label, Republic Records.

Music video
One of two music videos for the song was directed by Tim Story and premiered in February 2000.
