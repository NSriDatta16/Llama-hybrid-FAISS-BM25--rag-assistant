Per Ivar Moe (born 11 November 1944, in Ålesund) is a former speed skater from Norway.

Biography
In 1963, 18-year-old Per Ivar Moe won bronze at the European Allround Championships, an achievement he would repeat the following year (1964). In addition, in 1964, he became the first in 8 years to beat Knut Johannesen at the Norwegian Championships. That year, he also participated in the 1964 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck and won a silver medal on the 5,000 m in a time of 7:38.6, a mere 0.2 seconds behind Johannesen. At first, it seemed that Moe had won gold when 7:38.7 was displayed as Johannesen's time, but this was quickly corrected to 7:38.4.

In 1965, Moe won silver at the European Championships and two weeks later he became World Allround Champion. For his achievements, he received the 1965 Oscar Mathisen Award and was elected Norwegian Sportsperson of the Year that same year. Moe retired in 1966 to complete his university degree. Per Ivar Moe was in banking business in his professional life. He was Vice President in Nordea, one of the biggest banks in Norway.
