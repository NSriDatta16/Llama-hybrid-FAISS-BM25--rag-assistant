Viddalsdammen (Norwegian for "The Viddal Dam") is a lake and a reservoir in Aurland Municipality in Vestland county, Norway.  The reservoir has an area of  and the elevation varies between  and  above sea level. Viddalsdammen is located at the end of the Låvisdalen valley, about  southeast of the village of Aurlandsvangen, about  southeast of the village of Flåm, and about  northeast of Myrdal Station.

The reservoir was formed as part of the building of the Aurland Hydroelectric Power Station in the 1960s and 1970s when a rock-fill dam was built at the end of the lake Viddalsvatnet. After damming the level of Viddalsvatnet was raised to include the two upstream lakes Liverdalsvatnet and Fretheimsdalsvatnet, and they now form one  long contiguous lake. Viddalsdammen receives water through an extensive system of water tunnels that extends around the entire Aurland valley.
