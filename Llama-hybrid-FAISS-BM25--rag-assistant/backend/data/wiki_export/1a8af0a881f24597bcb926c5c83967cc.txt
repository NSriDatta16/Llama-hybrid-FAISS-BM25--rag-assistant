The Niagara Falls Canucks are a junior ice hockey team based in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada.  They play in the Ontario Junior Hockey League which they joined in 2023. For most of the teams history they had played in the Golden Horseshoe division of the Greater Ontario Junior Hockey League until leaving for the OJHL.

History
The Canucks moved up from Intercounty Junior C in 1971 to the Niagara District Junior B Hockey League.  They stayed with the league until 1979 when the league folded.

The Canucks have been a charter member of the Golden Horseshoe "B" since 1979.  For a short time in the 1990s, the teams was known as the Devils.

During the 2006 Playoffs, the Canucks won the GHJHL Championship, but ended up falling to the Midwestern Junior B Hockey League's Cambridge Winterhawks 4-games-to-1 in the Sutherland Cup final. The current captain of the Canucks is Ben Evans.

Current

The Niagara Falls Canucks relocated from Niagara Falls Memorial Arena to the Gale Centre prior to the 2011 season.  Niagara Falls native Cam McLean was named captain during the grand opening of the new facility.

Move to the OJHL

On June 26, 2023, it was announced that the Canucks franchise had been approved to join the Junior "A" level Ontario Junior Hockey League as an expansion franchise. As a result the Canucks will leave the GOJHL after over 50 years at the Junior "B" level. The Canucks were the second former GOJHL franchise to join OJHL in 2023 after the Leamington Flyers announced their move to the Junior "A" ranks in May of that year.
