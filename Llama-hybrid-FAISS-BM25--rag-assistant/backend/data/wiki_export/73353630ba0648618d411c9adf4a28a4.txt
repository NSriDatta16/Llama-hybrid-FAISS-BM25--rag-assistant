Touched by Jesus is the third studio album by All About Eve. It was the first album to feature Church guitarist Marty Willson-Piper on guitars. Despite this, the album fell short of the commercial achievements of both the first album and Scarlet and Other Stories, reaching No. 17 in the UK charts. Of the three singles released only "Farewell Mr Sorrow" charted, reaching No. 36.

Notes

Marty Willson-Piper remained a full-time member of The Church during both his periods with All About Eve, in spite of the fact that the former is based in Australia and the latter in the UK.

"Are You Lonely" and "Wishing the Hours Away" both featured guest-guitarist David Gilmour from Pink Floyd.

"Farewell Mr Sorrow" and "Strange Way" were both aimed at former guitarist Tim Bricheno, who left the band in 1990 following a break-up of his relationship with singer Julianne Regan.

Some versions of the single release of "Farewell Mr Sorrow" included a cover "Silver Song", originally by Mellow Candle, as a B-side.

The perceived failure of this album would lead to an acrimonious break-up between the band and their record company, causing them to sign to MCA for their next album, Ultraviolet.
