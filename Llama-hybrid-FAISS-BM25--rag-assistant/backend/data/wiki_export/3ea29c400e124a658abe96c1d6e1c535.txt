Dark Recollections is the only studio album and release by Swedish death metal band Carnage, released in 1990 by Earache Records.  It was originally released as a split CD with Cadaver's debut album Hallucinating Anxiety by Earache Records sublabel Necrosis. Some of the songs were later re-recorded by Dismember. Dark Recollections is the only album released by Carnage; the band had broken up by the time the album hit the streets. It was later reissued by Earache Records with eight additional tracks, taken from the demos for The Day Man Lost  and  Infestation of Evil.

"Deranged From Blood", "Death Evocation", "Blasphemies Of The Flesh" and "Self Dissection" previously appeared on Dismember demos circa 1988–1989, before Fred Estby and David Blomqvist joined Carnage.  Dismember also officially recorded "Death Evocation" (a bonus track on reissues of Like an Ever Flowing Stream) and "Torn Apart" (on the Pieces EP).
