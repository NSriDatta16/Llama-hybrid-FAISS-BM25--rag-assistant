Free Country is an American sitcom that aired on ABC in the summer of 1978. The show starred Rob Reiner as Joseph Bresner, the head of a Lithuanian family that emigrated to New York City in the early-1900s. Each episode featured the 89-year-old Bresner in present-day (i.e. in the 1970s) reminiscing about events in the early-1900s. The bulk of the show would then consist of actually showing those events. The series lasted five episodes.
