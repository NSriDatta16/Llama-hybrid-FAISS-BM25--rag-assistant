Mika John Vukona (born 13 May 1982) is a Fijian-born New Zealand former professional basketball player. Between 2003 and 2018, he spent 13 seasons with the New Zealand Breakers in the Australian NBL and helped them win four championships. He was also a regular with the Nelson Giants in the New Zealand NBL and was a long-time New Zealand Tall Black.

Early life
Vukona was born in Suva, Fiji. He was adopted by his birth mother's brother, a Fijian named Clem. Clem and his wife, a New Zealander named Marion, moved their family to New Zealand in 1987 following the Fiji coup. They settled down in the coastal city of Tauranga, Marion's hometown.

Vukona attended Bethlehem College in Tauranga for both primary and secondary school. He played rugby until third form at Bethlehem College, when his anti-rugby mother forced him to stop. He subsequently followed his brother's footsteps and took up basketball. He went on to become a member of the national under 16, 18 and 20 sides. Basketball took him to Nelson in his final school year after earning a scholarship to go to Nelson College.

Playing career

Australian NBL
Vukona made his debut in the Australian NBL as a development player during the New Zealand Breakers' inaugural season in 2003–04. He was elevated from a development player to a full-time contracted player for the 2005–06 season. He played five seasons for the Breakers before joining the South Dragons in 2008. He won a championship with the Dragons in 2008–09. After the Dragons collapsed, Vukona joined the Gold Coast Blaze for the 2009–10 season.

In 2010, Vukona made a return to the Breakers, and over the next five seasons, he helped the team win four championships, including three straight between 2010–11 and 2012–13.

After eight seasons with the Breakers, Vukona joined the Brisbane Bullets in 2018. Vukona ended the 2018–19 season on 449 games after tearing his Achilles in game one of the Bullets' semi-final series against the Wildcats and thus missing game two. His contract with the Bullets ended at the end of the 2019–20 season.
