Sophie Moleta is an Australian singer, songwriter, composer and teacher with an intimate singing style. She is best known for her piano backed vocals in what can be described as 'folk pop', but has a wide range of recorded music with dance and house music, electronic ambient, laid back jazz and other styles.

Moleta was born in New Zealand, but later moved to Perth, Western Australia. Her non-classical music career started with a local Perth punk band (The Brautigans) where she was backup vocalist and drummer. She has since had an extensive musical career in France, the UK, and has in recent years lived in New Zealand and latterly Australia.
