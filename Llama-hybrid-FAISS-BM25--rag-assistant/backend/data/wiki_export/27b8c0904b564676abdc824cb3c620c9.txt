Theatre
Rubenstein's career in the theatre includes work with several major Australian companies, including the Nimrod Theatre Company and Melbourne Theatre Company.

In 1993 she had a solo show called What's a Girl to Do?, where she performed poems written by contemporary Australian women poets.  It was later performed by Rubenstein at The Stables Theatre in Sydney (1994) and at the 1995 Edinburgh Festival.

This show inspired her to do another solo show using work commissioned for her, work that was written to be performed live.  She was awarded a Victorian Government Women Artist's Grant and commission contemporary writers to produce the performance pieces that were later and produced in a book called Confidentially yours. The first performance was in the Playbox Theatre Centre, C.U.B Malthouse, Melbourne on 11 February 1998. The writers commissioned to produce the work that became Confidentially Yours were, Janis Balodis, Andrew Bovell, Nick Enright, Michael Gurr, Daniel Keene, Joanna Murray-Smith and Debra Oswald.  Andrew Bovell wrote a pair of stories for the show that he later used in the script for the film Lantana.

In 2005 Rubenstein performed in Menopause the Musical, a comedy breaking down the taboos about menopause. With Caroline Gillmer, Susan-Ann Walker and Jane Clifton, Rubenstein, as "The Dubbo Housewife", explored the stereotypes and madness of that time in a woman's life.

In 2015 she played Gertrude Stein in the musical Loving Repeating - a Musical of Gertrude Stein in Melbourne.
