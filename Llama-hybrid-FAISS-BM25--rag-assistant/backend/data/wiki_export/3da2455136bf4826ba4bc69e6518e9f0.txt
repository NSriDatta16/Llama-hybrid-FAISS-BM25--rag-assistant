The Nilgiri clouded yellow, Colias nilagiriensis, sometimes considered a subspecies of Colias erate, is a small butterfly native to Shola forests of the Western Ghats. It belongs to the family Pieridae.

Some authors treat this as a subspecies of the eastern pale clouded yellow (C. erate) while others consider it on the basis of its geographic isolatation as a phylogenetically distinct species Colias nilagiriensis.
