The Beylik of Dulkadir () was one of the Anatolian beyliks established by the Turkoman clans Bayat, Afshar, and Begdili after the decline of Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm.

Etymology
The meaning of Dulkadir is unclear. It was later Arabized or reinterpreted according to folk tradition as Dhu'l-Qadr, which means 'powerful' or 'mighty'. According to the 16th-century German historian Johannes Leunclavius, Dulkadir was a corruption of the Turkic name Ṭorg̲h̲ud. Franz Babinger considered it as very probable, as the name was likely derived from some Turkish name, further suggesting that this would also mean the dynasty of Dulkadir is related to the Turkoman tribe of Ṭorg̲h̲ud. On the other hand, Annemarie von Gabain proposed tulga-dar () as the original Turkic word it sprang from.

History
The principality was founded by Zayn al-Din Qaraja, a Turkoman chieftain, likely from the Bayat tribe, who established himself in the region of Elbistan in 1335, taking the town in 1337 and obtaining the title of na'ib from the Mamluk Sultan Al-Nasir Muhammad. In 1515, after the Battle of Turnadağ, the principality was conquered by the Ottoman Sultan Selim I's vizier Hadım Sinan Pasha and converted into a sanjak.
