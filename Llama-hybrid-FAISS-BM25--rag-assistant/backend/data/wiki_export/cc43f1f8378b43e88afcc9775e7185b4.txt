History
Cork County Council was established on 1 April 1899 under the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 for the administrative county of County Cork. Originally meetings of Cork County Council were held in the back portion of the top floor of Cork Courthouse. By the 1950s these premises were becoming inadequate and County Hall opened in April 1968.

Boundary change
The area of Cork County Council was reduced on 31 May 2019, ceding territory to Cork City Council. This implemented changes under the Local Government Act 2019.

The 2015 Cork Local Government Review recommended merging Cork City Council and Cork County Council into a single "super council"; however, a minority report opposed the merger, with a subsequent report published by an expert advisory group in 2017 recommending a city boundary extension.

Regional Assembly
Cork County Council has five representatives on the Southern Regional Assembly who are part of the South-West Strategic Planning Area Committee.
