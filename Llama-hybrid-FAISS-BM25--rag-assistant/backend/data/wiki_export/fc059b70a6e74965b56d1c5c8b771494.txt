The company was renamed Pall Corp in 1957. In 1958 Pall began to develop filters for use in aircraft hydraulics, applied to the landing gears of American Airlines Boeing 707s. Then, Pall developed filters to purify jet fuel.

The company continued to grow in the 80's and 90's, adding applications and products. In the mid-80's, Pall contributed to the construction of the Eurotunnel under the English Channel, providing solutions to hydraulic operations needed to bore through the channel bedrock. In 1988, they began selling a filter for blood transfusions that reduced leukocyte levels below all other existing filters.

In 1997 the company acquired Gelman sciences, and in 1998, Pall acquired German company Rochem.

In response to an article in Forbes magazine about dioxane in Michigan, Farsad Fotouhi, VP of Life Sciences division, responded "Pall is in full compliance with the Consent Judgment it entered with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ), which serves as the legal framework for the cleanup." Later in 2013, Scio Township Supervisor Clark said he's heard from Fotouhi that there will be a staff of about 20 people that will remain on the site.
