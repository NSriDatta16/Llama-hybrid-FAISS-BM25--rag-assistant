Wisconsin Lutheran College (WLC) is a private liberal arts college affiliated with the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod and located on the border of Milwaukee and Wauwatosa, Wisconsin. It has an enrollment of about 1,200 students and is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission.

History
Wisconsin Lutheran College opened in the fall of 1973 with a part-time faculty and two dozen students. The school had its first full-time president two years later. In 1977 the school purchased five buildings on an  campus, and had a set of plans that allowed for growth and development. In 1982, the college purchased the academic library from Milton College. Volunteers moved and installed this 60,000 volume library. In 1983, the college purchased and installed the science laboratory furnishings of the University of Wisconsin Center at Medford. These major additions helped the college pursue its dream of becoming a four-year college.

In 1984, the Board of Regents approved the four-year program to start in the fall of 1985. The evaluation team from North Central Association of Colleges and Schools agreed that the necessary planning and resources existed to enable Wisconsin Lutheran College to move toward accreditation as a baccalaureate degree-granting institution. In May 1987 the first 12 students graduated with baccalaureate degrees. In June 1987 the Executive Commissioners of the North Central Association granted Wisconsin Lutheran College initial accreditation as a baccalaureate degree-granting institution.

Gary Greenfield, who served as the college's first full-time president for 28 years, retired in June 2003. Timothy Kriewall was inaugurated as the second president on Sept. 7, 2003, and retired in June 2008. Daniel Johnson accepted the call to be the third full-time president of Wisconsin Lutheran College in July 2008 and was inaugurated on April 24, 2009.
