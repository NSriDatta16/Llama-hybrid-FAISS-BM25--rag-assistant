This is a list of notable events in country music that took place in 1948.

Events
 April 3 — Radio station KWKH of Shreveport, Louisiana airs the Louisiana Hayride for the first time.
 May 15 — Billboard begins a sales-based Best Selling Folk Retail Records chart, the magazine's second chart to track the popularity of country songs. The new chart complements the existing Most Played Juke Box Folk Records chart, and begins a practice of multiple charts (and possible simultaneous No. 1 songs) that will continue for the next 10 years.
 July 24 — Roy Acuff announces his intention to run for governor of Tennessee. Running as the Republican candidate, he will lose to Democratic candidate Gordon Browning in the November election.

No dates
 Eddy Arnold dominates the Billboard charts, scoring five No. 1 songs (six, if one counts Arnold's "I'll Hold You in My Heart (Till I Can Hold You in My Arms)", which had been No. 1 since November 1947). Only Jimmy Wakely's "One Has My Name (The Other Has My Heart)" breaks Arnold's streak. Four other songs by Arnold also make the country charts.

Top Hillbilly (Country) Recordings 1948

1948 was the year Eddy Arnold and Country music crossed over to the Billboard magazine mainstream popular charts. Nine of the top ten Country records entered the popular charts, with "Bouquet of Roses" spending 28 weeks, in addition to a record 54 weeks on the Country charts.

The 1948 year-end Country rankings include 'Most-Played Juke Box Folk Records' and 'Best Selling Retail Folk Records' (starting May 15, 1948). With few exceptions, records included entered the charts between November 1947 and December 1948, and received points for their full chart runs. Each week, a score of 15 points is assigned for the no. 1 record, 9 points for no. 2, 8 points for no. 3, and so on, and the total of all weeks from both charts determined the final rank. Number of weeks at number one or total weeks on the chart do not include duplicates; if a record was #1 on both charts on July 15, that counts as one week, not two. Additional information from other sources is reported, but not used for ranking. This includes dates from the "Discography of American Historical Recordings" website, cross-over information from R&B and Pop charts, 'Cashbox', and other sources as noted.
