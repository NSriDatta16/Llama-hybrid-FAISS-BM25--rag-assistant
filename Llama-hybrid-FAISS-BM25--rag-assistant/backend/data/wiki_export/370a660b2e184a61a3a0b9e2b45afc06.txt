Mirror, Mirror II is a co-production between Australia and New Zealand that was released in 1997. Unlike the first series, Mirror, Mirror, which was one story played out over a number of episodes, this series has individual adventures in each new episode, but there is a story linking them all.

Plot

In this series, the mirror from the original Mirror, Mirror series has come into the hands of two other New Zealand families: the de Lutrelles and the McFarlanes. They both live in the same house, but are separated from each other by 130 years.

de Lutrelle family
Gervaise, Violette and their daughter Constance, live in the house in 1867, in that time the house is surrounded by goldfields. The family had emigrated from their home in France with vestiges of their wealth. They hope to find gold in the surrounding hills so they can restore their family's high status.

McFarlane family
Doug, Jenny and his two new stepchildren, live in the house in 1997. The troublesome Aunt Lily also lives with them. Doug, who left Daniel and his mother when he was a baby, agrees to have him come to visit from Sydney, Australia to connect and rekindle their relationship over the holidays, despite Doug's hesitation and Daniel's reticence at first.
