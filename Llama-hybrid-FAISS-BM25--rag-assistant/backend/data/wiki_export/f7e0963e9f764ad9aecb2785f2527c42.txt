Hector Bianciotti (; 18 March 1930 – 12 June 2012) was an Argentine-born French author and member of the Académie française.

Biography
Born Héctor Bianciotti (, ) in Calchín Oeste in Córdoba Province, Argentina, Bianciotti's parents were immigrants from Piedmont, who communicated among themselves in the language of that region but who forbade its use with their son. Instead, they spoke Spanish to him. Bianciotti began his study of French in 1945. He arrived in France in 1961 and completed his French naturalization in 1981. In 1982, he stopped writing in any language but French, his favorite.

Bianciotti was elected to the Académie française on 18 January 1996 to Seat 2, succeeding André Frossard.

He died on 12 June 2012.
