The Arsenal would have a very successful first season, going undefeated in the regular season with a record of 8 wins, 0 losses and 2 draws, with a league-leading 42 goals for and only 5 against. The club would advance to the play-off finals, defeating the Sonoma County Sol to win the NPSL Championship 1-0.

In their second season in 2006, the Arsenal finished in 2nd in the Midwest Conference with a record of 7-2-1. The club folded in the off season.
