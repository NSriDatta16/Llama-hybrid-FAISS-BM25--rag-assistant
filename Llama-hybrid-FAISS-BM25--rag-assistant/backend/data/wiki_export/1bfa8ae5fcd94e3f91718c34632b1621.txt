The  is a standardized test of English administered by the United Nations Association of Japan, a public interest incorporated foundation. It is supported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan.

Overview 
The United Nations designates as its official languages English, French, Chinese, Russian, Spanish, and Arabic; the United Nations Associations Test of English is to evaluate the examinees’ proficiency in English. Although the title of the test includes the words “United Nations,” the sponsor is not the United Nations, but, rather, it is a test conducted only in Japan, administrated by the United Nations Association of Japan, a member of the World Federation of United Nations Associations, which is a class-A advisory NGO for the United Nations, receiving the United Nations flag from its Headquarters.

This exam is held twice a year. There are six levels: , A, B, C, D, and E. It is possible to take two exams for adjacent levels simultaneously. The levels C and E exams consist of one examination of a multiple-choice test. B level exams consist of both multiple choice and English composition and only require one exam to pass. For Superior A and A levels, examinees must pass the first exam that consists of a multiple-choice section and an English composition section and then the secondary exam involving an interview with a native speaker of English (B level also required interviews until 2005). This interview requires appropriate responses to a wide range of topics including politeness, social awareness, interest in global events, and aspirations for the use of the examinees’ English skills in their future careers. Another major feature is the inclusion of current events in the exam questions. Unlike other exams, general knowledge is also included in this exam. 

There are other standardized tests of English proficiency such as the Practical English Proficiency Test, but the United Nations Associations Test of English specifically requires knowledge of the UN and international politics. Examinees who take Level B or above must read New Today's Guide to the United Nations by the United Nations Association of Japan.

The test adopts the method of listening to English and then choosing the correct answer from the illustrations on the answer sheet (for pre-A and above levels, selections are made on English words instead of images, and Level A has additional reading comprehension questions. Level E has 25 questions (30 minute), while Level A 80 questions (50 minutes).
