Riverhead is a northern village part of the urban area of Sevenoaks in the district of the same name in Kent, England and is also a civil parish.  The parish had a population in 2001 of 1821, increasing to 2,634 at the 2011 Census.

The parish stretches from Chipstead Lake and the River Darent in the north through the hamlet of Dibden and A21 to Mill Bank Wood in the south.

History
The origin of the name of the village may lie in the Saxon word 'rither' meaning hill or
deriving from the word meaning 'cattle landing place'.
Riverhead was an early settlement, part of the Codsheath Hundred.
The settlement grew in size during Saxon times as traffic on the pilgrim routes between
Canterbury and Winchester increased.  
The prosperity of the village during Georgian times is indicated by the high proportion
of households that had to pay Hearth Tax on their properties, and although the village
was of modest size, it was surrounded by several major country estates such as
Chipstead Place, Bradbourne and Montreal.

Riverhead had a variety of country industries typical of the area, including a tannery, a
timber yard, smithies and the posting house. The economy was based mainly on
agriculture, along with some gravel and sand quarrying to the north east of the village
that created the lakes around Bradbourne which are now a wildfowl reserve.

The village has a central conservation area that covers some  and contains about 30 listed
buildings.  The listed properties in the Conservation Area date from the 17th-18th centuries
and the older unlisted properties date mainly from the 19th Century.

The 1831-built C of E church is dedicated to St Mary the Virgin; its architect was Decimus Burton.  It is in the late Georgian lancet style, executed in characteristic local materials. The 1882 extension by Arthur William Blomfield shows how Victorian church design developed.  The east window was installed in 1905 by Charles Eamer Kempe.
