Concord High School (CHS) is a public secondary school located in unincorporated New Castle County, Delaware, United States, with a Wilmington postal address. It is one of three high schools in the Brandywine School District. There were 1,084 students enrolled in the fall for the 2019â€“2020 school year. Mark Mayer is the current principal of Concord High School.

History
CHS opened in 1967 in response to a rapidly rising population that produced too many students for Brandywine High School, then in the Alfred I. duPont District, to handle on its own. Upon opening, it was located on the same campus as Hanby Junior High and taught only ninth and tenth grades. Construction on CHS' own building was delayed due to a worker strike and did not open until January 1970, an entire semester after the planned date and still without its gym, auditorium, and swimming pool completed. During the delay, CHS was forced to leave Hanby and move temporarily into Brandywine High School's building; the two schools taught on a rotating basis: BHS students attended in the morning and CHS students attended in the afternoon.
