Managerial career
Schopp began his coaching career in the youth system of Red Bull Salzburg following his retirement.

In April 2013, he was named the interim head coach at his former club Sturm Graz until the end of the season, following the sacking of Peter Hyballa.

In 2018, Schopp became the manager of TSV Hartberg in the Austrian Bundesliga. In the 2019–20 season, Schopp led the club to their highest ever finish in the Austrian Bundesliga and secured a place in the UEFA Europa League for the first time in club history. During the 2020–21 season, he steered the club to a seventh-placed finish. During his time as a manager at Sturm Graz and Hartberg, Schopp built a reputation as a developer of young, emerging talent.

On 29 June 2021, Schopp was appointed head coach of Championship club Barnsley. He signed a three-year deal and replaced Valérien Ismaël, who had left the club a week prior to become the new manager at West Bromwich Albion. On 1 November 2021, Barnsley confirmed the sacking of Schopp after a poor run of form, a run of 13 games without a win and seven straight league defeats.

Personal life
Schopp is the father of the footballer Christoph Urdl, who played under him at Hartberg.
