History 

In 1967, Carl Hoffman bought a peach tree orchard on the current location of Alexander Memorial  Airport, with the intent of building an airfield from which he could easily reach Atlanta. By mid-1968, the field had been finished, and Antique Acres (original name of airfield) could soon support light aircraft with a 3,350 foot long grass runway.

In 1969, the runway was modified to accommodate gliders as well. Hoffman sold the airport operations in 1973, and, after the buyer ran into financial difficulties, re-acquired the airfield. Hoffman finally sold Antique Acres a short time afterwards.

Pike County tax records show that Bobby Tisdale bought the airport March 14, 1979, and later sold it to Lynford and Brenda Sullivan on August 3, 1990. The Sullivans sold Peach State to David Harwell on March 31, 1994, and he held it until the April 7, 2005 sale to Ronald Alexander (Peach State Airport, LLC.).

Peach State Airport was the original home for the Atlanta Soaring Club, founded October 4, 1986. In May 1988, the ASC moved to Etowah Bend Airport due to "increasing uncertainty of additional (and unworkable) air space restrictions around Atlanta's Hartsfield Airport, the proposed Mode C requirements, the shift of the demographics of potential club members more further north and the impending sale of Peach State by Bob Tisdale...."

Following the death of airport owner Ron Alexander, Peach State Airport was re-named Alexander Memorial Airport. The change was announced during a March 2017 ceremony held in his honor.

In 2020, under the ownership of Keven and Linda Sasser, the airport name was changed back to Peach State Aerodrome. The Sassers, along with other airport community members, knew Ron Alexander would have never entertained the thought of changing the airport name due to his passing.

Candler Field Museum 
Founded in March, 2005, the non-profit Candler Field Museum is a dedicated recreation of the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, as it appeared in the late 1920s and early 1930s, then known as Candler Field. It is currently composed of the American Airways hangar, representing the original Candler Field terminal, and the adjacent Doug Davis hangar, housing the Candler Field Museum Youth Aviation Program.

The Museum sponsors several events throughout the year, including the Vintage Day Fly-In, held each June. Most events emphasize aircraft and culture of the 1920s, and Vintage Day attracts a wide variety of old and unusual aircraft.
