At  in length, and  wide, it is the fifth longest fjord in the archipelago, and the longest on the island. The fjord separates Gustav V Land in the north from Gustav Adolf Land in the south, at geographical co-ordinates . Its mouth faces Spitsbergen across Hinlopen Strait, the strait separating the two islands.

The fjord is named for the Swedish naturalist GÃ¶ran Wahlenberg (1780-1851) and has been known by this name since at least the early 1930s. The glacier of Wahlenbergbreen in Oscar II Land, Spitsbergen, is also named for him.
