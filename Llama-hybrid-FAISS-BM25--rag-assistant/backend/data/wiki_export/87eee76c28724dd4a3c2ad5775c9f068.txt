History of the town 

In 1748 Muhammad Shah was succeeded by his son Ahmad Shah, who shortly afterwards was appointed Safdar Jang.  The Durrani invasions of Nadir Shah in 1739 and Ahmad Shah Durrani in 1748 had severely shaken the stability of the central government, and given to the provincial governors a dangerous degree of power. One of the most influential of these was Ali Muhammad in Rohilkhand, and the new wajir, who had already quarrelled with him, looked with apprehension on his growing prestige. With Qaim Khan, the son of Muhammad Khan, he had also a hereditary feud, and he determined to set his two enemies at one another's throats, being certain to be himself the gainer whatever the event.  Accordingly, on the death od Ali Muhammad in 1749, after an abortive attempt to overthrow his successor by other means, an imperial farman was issued to Qaim Khan conferring on him the mahals of Bareilly and Moradabad wrongfully usurped by Sadullah Khan, the son of Ali Muhammad.

Qaim Khan fell into the trap laid for him and set out to the conquest of his new territories with a large force.  At Qadirganj on the Ganges in the Kasganj district, he was defeated by the Rohillas under Hafiz Rahmat Khan and killed. Safdar Jang at ones attempted to seize Farrukhabad and the other Bangash parganas, but Ahmad Khan, the son of Qaim Khan, collected his adherents and in 1750 defeated the Wajir General Nawab Rae at Khuaganj, and the Wajit soon afterwards near Patiali. Had the ambition and enterprise of Ahmad Khan been equal to his personal courage there is little doubt that he might now have pushed on to Delhi and made himself master of the Emperors person and virtual sovereign. He was, however, far too easy-going in disposition to embark on such a scheme and contented himself with the recovery of his family, former territories and the recognition of his title to them from the Emperor. The administration of the various parganas was given to his brothers and relations, Shikohabad, which included Sakit, Kuraoli and Alikhera, going to Azim Khan, and Bhongaon and Bewar to the Majhle Nawab, Shadi Khan was sent to occupy Kora, but was opposed and defeated by Ali Quli Khan, the deputy in the Allahabad Subah. Ahmad Khans reluctance to move was overcome by the insistence of his counselors and he was persuaded to advance on Allahabad in person. While he was besieging that town the wajir had had time to recover from his defeat and had called in the Marathas to his assistance.

The approach of the united armies towards Farrukhabad obliged Ahmad Khan to raise the siege of Allahabad, and after some discussion he decided to return to protect his own home. But the discouragement produced by this retreat proved too much for his mercenaries and they melted away until when he reached Fatehgarh he had too small a force to attempt to do more than hold the fort. After a month's siege a Rohilla army under Sadullah Khan and Bahadur Khan came down to his assistance, but was defeated by the Marathas, and Ahmad Khan then fled through Rohilkhand to Kumaon, where he remained till 1752, when a fresh invasion of India by Ahmad Shah Durrani made Safdar Jang and the Marathas anxious for pease. It was agreed that Rohilkhand and Farrukhabad should be evacuated on condition that Ahmad Khan took over the debt of thirty lakhs of rupees due from Safdar Jang to the Marathas as pay for their services, ceding as security for the debt sixteen and a half of the thirty three mahals comprised in his territories. The management of the whole remained in the hands of Ahmad Khan, who paid the surplus revenue, after deducting the cost of management and the pay of the troops, to two Marathas agents stationed at Kanauj and Aliganj. Payments continued to be made till the battle of Panipat in 1761, when the Marathas left Doab.

1751–1761
It was the most important period in the history when Maratha forces advance in the North and expanded the Empire to the Natural Dimensions of the country.  Malharrao Holkar, Jayappa Scindia, Gangadhar Tatya, Tukojirao Holkar, Khanderao Holkar went to help Safdarjung against Shadulla Khan, Ahmed Khan Bangash, Mohamud Khan, Bahadur Khan Rohilla as per the directions of Peshwa Balaji Bajirao. In the Battle of Fategarh and Farrukhabad, they defeated the Rohillas and Bangash (March 1751 – April 1752).

As result of this Battle Rohillas were compelled to pay a compensation amount of 3 million Rupees along with an annual tribute. The amount of tribute was half of the total collections from 33 Mahals of Rohilkhand and Farrukhabad. Rohillas were also forced to pay the total expenses for the management of the troops for Gangwar and Katiyar Maratha sardars stationed at Aliganj and Kannauj respectively. Ahmad Khan continued to pay the amount till the third battle of Panipat in 1761, when the Marathas left Doab.[2]

Contemporary History, Developments and Concerns
Kaimganj possesses the honour of being ancestral town of Late Dr. Zakir Hussain, Former President of Republic of India. Syed Abdul Salam Shah, a freedom fighter who actively participated in Non-cooperation Movement (Asahiyog Andolan) led by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi in 1921-1922 and Quit India Movement in 1942. He was also a prominent political figure belonging to Indian National Congress. The very famous poet and progressive writer of his time Late Ghulam Rabbani Taban, and eminent linguist and the 5th Vice Chancellor of Jamia Millia Islamia, Professor Emeritus Masud Husain Khan were from this place. Dr Shah Alam Khan, Professor of Orthopaedics at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi hails from Kaimganj. His references in Orthopaedic literature are well quoted. Dr. Abdul Salam Khan (elder son of famous Hakeem Abdul Hai Khan) settled in Germany as Scientist and also serving as Managing Director Indo-German Liaison Office (IGLO) and younger son Dr. Abdul Kalam Khan settled in Lucknow retired from Department of Medical Health and Education Uttar Pradesh Government as Deputy Director. Kaimganj has emerged as a major developed town in the region on infrastructural, economical, educational parts. Mr Salman Khursheed, Union State Minister for Company Affairs also hails from Kaimganj.

The major concern in the town today is the ambivalent tobacco industry. No Doubt tobacco industry has contributed a lot in the development of the town – by generating numerous employment opportunities for the poor and rich equally, and thus adding to the prosperity of the town. However, a large increase in the tobacco cultivation and processing in the various godowns located in city's residential premises is adding to the health hazards of the residents. The symptoms of asthma, tuberculosis and other respiratory malfunctions are evident in the people who work in tobacco processing industry and also among the common citizens.
Now the godowns are moved away from the city to make life better for common people
