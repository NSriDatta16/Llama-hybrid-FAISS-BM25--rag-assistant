Persian mysticism, or the Persian love tradition, is a traditional interpretation of existence, life and love, reliant upon revelatory and heart-felt principles in reasoning. Though partially sourced from the mystical Zoroastrian traditions of the Persian Empire, in its contemporary practical aspects it is now synonymous with Sufism in contemporary Iran.

Thought
Persian mystical thought has been analysed critically by Abdolhossein Zarrinkoub, Abdolkarim Soroush, and Dariush Shayegan. In Rumi, one can find love-based mysticism; in Hafiz the pleasure-based mysticism. Under Rumi's influences, Abdolkarim Soroush is currently working on power-based or epic mysticism.
