Leo Catholic High School is a private all-male, Catholic high school in the Auburn-Gresham neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois, United States. It is located in the Archdiocese of Chicago and home to a predominantly African–American student body. The school is named in honor of Pope Leo XIII.

History
Established in 1926 by the Congregation of Christian Brothers, their first school in Chicago, Leo Catholic High School has educated thousands of boys from Chicago's South Side and suburbs.

Athletics
Since its founding in 1926, Leo has competed in the Chicago Catholic League.  The school also competes in state championship tournaments sponsored by the Illinois High School Association (IHSA).

These teams have finished in the top four of their respective IHSA state tournament:
basketball:  4th place (1997–98); State Champions (2003–04); 2nd place (2015–16)
track & field:  3rd place (1982–83, 2000–01, 2004–05); 2nd place (1999–2000, 2003–04); State Champions (1980–81, 1994–95, 1997–98, 2001–02, 2002–03, 2010–11, 2011–12)

The school was initially known for its football team, which made 8 appearances in Chicago's Prep Bowl, which pitted the champion of the Catholic League against the winner from the Chicago Public League from 1934 to 1956. The 1941, 42 and 56 teams won Prep Bowl city championships at Soldier Field. Leo High School is also recognized as the 1941 high school football national champion.

In particular, the 1937 and 1941 Prep Bowls are recognized as holding the state of Illinois' all-time records for attendance at a football game.  The 1937 attendance was estimated at 110,000 spectators, which saw Leo lose to Austin High School, 26–0.  The 1941 game saw 95,000 spectators watch Leo defeat Tilden High School, 46–13.  The 1940 and 42 games each had 75,000 fans, meaning Leo has played in front of four of the 11 largest crowds in Illinois high school history.
