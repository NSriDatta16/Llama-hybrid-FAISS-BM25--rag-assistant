James David Van Cleve is an American fiddle player, songwriter, session musician, and producer.  He is a founding member of the popular band Mountain Heart, and a Grammy winning session musician and Grammy nominated solo artist.

Early life 
Jim Van Cleve was born October 12, 1978, in Sarasota, Florida. He won many fiddle contests as a youth.  While still in high school, Van Cleve became a member of Ric-o-chet and Lou Reid and Carolina, prominent bands in the national bluegrass scene at the time.

In 1997, bluegrass and gospel legend Doyle Lawson invited Van Cleve to join his group, Quicksilver.  Van Cleve left college (UNC-Greensboro) to become the band's new fiddle player.

Mountain Heart 
In 1998, banjo player Barry Abernathy, singer/guitarist Steve Gulley, and Grammy-winning mandolinist (formerly of Alison Krauss and Union Station) Adam Steffey began plans to form a band.  Van Cleve came on board and the band Mountain Heart was formed.  Van Cleve has played a major role in the success and popularity of the band, as well as a driving force in creating more complex musical arrangements. He left the band in April 2014.
