John 16 is the sixteenth chapter of the Gospel of John in the New Testament of the Christian Bible. It records Jesus' continued farewell discourse to his disciples, set on the last night before his crucifixion. Three key words in this chapter, ἁμαρτία, δικαιοσύνη, κρίσις (sin, righteousness and judgment, ) "comprehend the three great steps of advance in spiritual truth among men". Jesus speaks about the work of the Holy Spirit, the joy of the believers and his victory over the world. The book containing this chapter is anonymous, but early Christian tradition uniformly affirmed that John composed this Gospel.
