Alice Beatrice Calhoun (November 21, 1900 â€“ June 3, 1966) was an American silent film actress.

Film star
Born in Cleveland, Ohio, she made her film debut in an uncredited role in 1918 and went on to appear in another forty-seven films between then and 1929. As a star with Vitagraph in New York City, she moved with the company when it relocated to Hollywood. In  the comedy, The Man Next Door (1923), Calhoun plays Bonnie Bell. A critic complimented her on being pretty and playing her role successfully. The Man From Brodney's (1923) is a movie which displays the fencing talent of actor J. Warren Kerrigan. Directed by David Smith for Vitagraph, the film is based on a novel by George Barr McCutcheon. Calhoun plays Princess Genevra. Between Friends (1924) is a motion picture adapted from a story by Robert W. Chambers. Anna Q. Nilsson and Norman Kerry are part of a cast in which Calhoun plays an artist's model. Among her other movies titles are Pampered Youth (1925), The Power of the Weak (1926), Savage Passions (1927), and Bride of the Desert (1929).

Like a number of other stars at the time, her voice did not lend itself to sound and her one performance in a talkie came in an uncredited role in 1934.

Marriages
Her first husband was Mendel Silberberg, a Los Angeles, California attorney. They were married in May 1926 and he filed a divorce petition in July. Silberberg charged that Calhoun was engaged to another man at the time of their wedding. Their marriage was annulled.

In 1925 Calhoun had invested in a movie theater. With her second husband Max Chotiner, whom she married secretly in Ventura, California on December 28, 1926, she became owner of a chain of theatres in the Los Angeles area. Highly successful, Calhoun and her husband were benefactors of a number of local charities. Chotiner later became an investment broker. They divorced in 1938.

Death
Calhoun died in Los Angeles in 1966 of cancer, aged 65. She is interred with her husband in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

For her contributions to the film industry, Calhoun was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame with a motion pictures star located at 6815 Hollywood Boulevard.
