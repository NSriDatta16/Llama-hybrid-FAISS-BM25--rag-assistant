The Mariscal Luzuriaga Province (Spanish mariscal marshal)  is one of 20 provinces of the Ancash Region in Peru. It was created by law 12541 on January 12, 1956 and named after the Peruvian marshal and Argentine general Toribio de Luzuriaga.

Since the Inca roads crossed its territory up to the Ecuador, where its capital Piscobamba is located now, there was a strategic tambo during the Inca's time. Pisqu Pampa  means "bird plain" in Quechua. This place has a special attraction due to four mythical hills: Kampanayuq, Aswaq, Amañico and Wankash. Bloody battles were performed here by the armies of the Inca Tupac Yupanqui and the conchucos, piscopampas and huaras. See Garcilaso: "Comentarios reales" .
