Some of his family members sold crack cocaine, and his father left his family at age 10. He attended public school in his youth but attended Episcopal Academy for high school. He became one of the top high school basketball players in the country at Episcopal, receiving scholarship offers at 16 schools. He chose to attend Penn to study accounting at the Wharton School; he had planned on being an accountant in his youth.

In 2009, he became an assistant coach for the University of Pennsylvania's men's basketball team.  On December 14, 2009, Allen was named interim head coach of the Penn men's basketball team after the firing of Glen Miller.  On March 31, 2010, he was announced as the new permanent head coach of the Penn Men's Basketball team. He resigned his position as head coach effective on March 10, 2015.

Bribery case and related NCAA sanctions
In October 2018, Allen pleaded guilty to accepting an $18,000 bribe in 2014 while the head coach at Penn to help a student get on the recruiting list in order to get accepted to the university. He was ordered to pay back $18,000 in addition to a $200,000 fine. He would testify on behalf of the federal government against the man he said had bribed him – Phillip Esformes. During Esformes's trial, Allen testified that he had received about $300,000 in bribes from Esformes, and that the student in question was Esformes's son.

On February 26, 2020, the NCAA announced penalties against Allen and the Penn men's basketball program stemming from the bribes. The program was placed on two years' probation but did not receive a postseason ban. Allen received a 15-year show-cause penalty from the NCAA, effective until February 20, 2035. It is the longest ever handed down to a (former) head coach. During this period, any school that hires Allen must "show cause" for why it should not be sanctioned for doing so. In an unusual move, if Allen gets a head coaching job after the show-cause expires, he must sit out the first half of the first season of his return. It is very difficult for a head coach to return to the collegiate ranks even after a show-cause expires, since many presidents and athletic directors are extremely reluctant to hire someone with a show-cause on his record. Only four coaches have ever worked in college basketball again after receiving a show-cause.
