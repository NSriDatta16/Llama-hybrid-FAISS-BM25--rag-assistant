Ashford is an inner southwestern suburb of Adelaide, in the City of West Torrens.  It is triangular in shape and bordered by South Road (west), Anzac Highway (southeast) and Everard Avenue (north). Two of the main features of the suburb are Ashford Hospital and Ashford Special School.

Brownhill Creek flows through Ashford in a cement channel behind the school.

The name commemorates the property and residence (now part of Ashford Special School) of Dr. Charles George Everard, who settled in the area in 1838, and named it for Ashford, Kent.
