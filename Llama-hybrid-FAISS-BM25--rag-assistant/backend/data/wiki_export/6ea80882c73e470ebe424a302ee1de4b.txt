After a civil war broke out in his native country, his family settled in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he attended Girard College, a college-prep boarding school for single-parent kids and low-income families. Girard did not have a football team due to lack of insurance, so Youboty eventually joined the Wynnefield Hawks Football Club under the guidance of coach Wayne King.

Youboty and his family eventually relocated to Houston, Texas. He attended Klein High School, where he returned to graduate with the class of 2003 after participating as an early winter enrollee at the Ohio State University.

As a three-year starter, he competed against many of Houston's most talented football players including Woodlands High School's Danny Amendola.
