Season 1

The first season of the show first aired on DStv Channel 37 from 5 March to 4 June 2006. In a twist to the game, two new contestants were introduced on Day 23, much to the excitement of the remaining housemates.

Ebuka, the most popular housemate for several weeks into the show and widely believed to emerge the winner was the seventh housemate to be evicted; many viewers blame the Joe's Fan Club (JFC) for his eviction. Joe himself was soon evicted from the show.

Big Brother added another twist to the game on Day 79 by cancelling the day's scheduled nominations and making the housemates believe they will instead be evicted based on their performances on assigned tasks, while in reality, no more evictions were held and viewers began voting for the winner who turned out to be 26-year-old Katung Aduwak.
