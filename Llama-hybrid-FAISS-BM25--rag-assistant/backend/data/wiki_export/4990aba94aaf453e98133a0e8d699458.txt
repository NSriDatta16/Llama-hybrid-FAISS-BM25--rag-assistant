Dhapa is a locality on the fringes of East Kolkata, India. The area consists of landfill sites where the solid wastes of the city of Kolkata are dumped. "Garbage farming" is encouraged in the landfill sites. More than 40 per cent of the green vegetables in the Kolkata markets come from these lands. There are four sectors in Dhapa for dumping garbage that are filled with 2,500 tonnes of waste per day.

History
In the eastern fringes of Kolkata, the neighbourhoods such as Tangra, Tiljala, Topsia and Dhapa, were populated largely with people who migrated from poverty-ridden and caste-ridden villages from Purulia, Medinipur and also from Orissa, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. They came with dreams of a better life but landed in the slums with open drains, pigsties, factory chimneys and pungent chemicals. They found work in the tanneries and factories, and also engaged in menial work. A big proportion of them were Chamars, but there also were Doms, Dosads, Mehtars and Kahars. They were all Harijans and they formed a majority. Most of these poor people escaped from the petty persecution they faced in their villages but were far removed from the mainstream of urban life and culture.  They have been here, living in depressing conditions, for more than a century.

Pollution in Dhapa
Dhapa has been a major victim of Air and sound pollution. In 1986 the pond next to the Dhapa Post Office was filled by the city garbage. As a result, at least 65% of the population above the age of 35 are infected by the exposure to tuberculosis.

Demography
Majority of the people living in the place are either migrant casual laborers who work in tanneries of China Town or are employed in small factories nearby. Some of the inhabitants are peasants and farmers who work in the fields that line the EM Bypass. These farmers came from Medinipur, Durgapur,  Bihar and Orissa. The majority of the population is poor and some live below the poverty line. Recently new population has migrated in the Hatgachia area. Also the family of Patwas have moved here from Bihar who have minted the money in jewellery business.

Schools
The area has several schools like the Harvard House High School (ICSE), St. Thomas School (ICSE), St. Patrick Day School (Primary), Janakalyan School (West Bengal Secondary Board) and a number of small primary and secondary schools affiliated to the local state board (West Bengal). There are several private tutors too.

Crime and criminal activities
The place was once notorious for criminal and anti-social activities as illegal drugs, liquor and other contraband objects were sold openly. There were various mafia groups who fought among themselves while trying to control the illegal liquor trade (hooch, desi). During the decades of 80's and 90's this area was once ruled by notorious criminals like Shiv Narayan, Ganesh, Jhantu and Tarak. However, with the arrival of new Officer in Charge things were under control by the year 2000. In 2013 this area suffered a major blow when the councilor Mr. Sambhunath Kow was charged with non intentional murder of a local mafia named Adhir Maiti.
