Argoncilhe () is a Portuguese civil parish in the municipality (concelho) of Santa Maria da Feira. The population in 2011 was 8,420, in an area of 8.21 km2. It is located near the city of Porto.

History
The origins of Argoncilhe date back to the pre-Roman period, owing to the toponymy and archaeological findings, particularly in area of Aldriz (location of a Castro and several Romanesque villas).

The origin of the community's name is uncertain: two versions with distinct etymologies exist. According to the first, Argoncilhe arises from areucillus, a diminutive of "areub" (arch), that evolved to arcucillus and arcucillis in Latin, and ultimately Argoncilhe (small arch). The second interpretation, points to the name of Argoncilhe developing from Dragoncellus, evolving into Dragunceli (1086), Draguncelli (1091), Dragoncelli (1100 and 1102), Dragonzell (1114), Ecllesian Sancti Martini of Argoncilhi (1320), St. Martin of Dragoncilhi (1337).

The oldest written document referencing Argoncilhe appeared in 1086, proving the donation to Sancha Bermudez, of several buildings of the villa of Eldriz (Aldriz) to the Church of São Martinho. A few years later, in 1091, Ragui Ramirez and Ruderico Gunsalvez referred to the parish, in a letter of shares to D. Soeiro Formarigues, for property near the Outeiro of Pena, in the villa of Dragoncelli. There are references after 1100, with D. Soeiro Formarigues attempting to acquire the assets of the villa Dragoncelli that belonged to Elvira Gouviaz.

Argoncilhe's medieval history is intrinsically linked to the early history of Grijó. In 1093, it was one of seven ecclesiastical parishes donated to the monastery of Grijó, along with Perosinho, Serzedo, Grijó, Travanca de Bemposta, São Miguel de Travaçô and Teirol. Similarly, it was donated by D. Bernardo, Bishop of Coimbra, and then in 1137, by Bishop João, to be included with the churches in the area of Porto transferred to the lands of Feira, or specifically, Argoncilhe, Perosinho, Serzedo and Grijó. This situation continued until 1686, when the Argoncilhe became ecclesiastically independent of the Convent of Grijó, in 1834.

Throughout its history Argoncilhe has been associated with agriculture, although by the mid-20th century industry finally obtained a foothold, resulting in the expansion of mineral-based activities and development of a commercial activities. This was possible through the electrification of the territory, which did not take place until 1951. It allowed further expansion of agriculture and industrial modernization.

On 14 April 1985, Argoncilhe gained the status of vila (or town) owing to the advancements in the latter part of the 20th century.
