Love is Colder Than Death, commonly abbreviated LiCTD or LICTD, is an early German neoclassical dark wave band that was one of the cornerstones to Hyperium Records' Heavenly Voices compilation series of the early 1990s. It is named after the 1969 Fassbinder film . The band's music is characterized by its extensive use of both romantic and classical styled male and female vocals. Founded by Ralf Donis, Maik Hartung, Sven Mertens, and Susann Heinrich in 1990, the band members and music have changed slightly since then. The first few LICTD albums were released on the Hyperium record label in Europe and on the new Metropolis Records label in the United States.

The band's album Teignmouth was the first Metropolis Records release, and remains one of LICTD's more popular albums.  Following the departure of Donis, the more experimental songs that characterized some of the early LICTD work gave way to a much more classical sound.  Eclipse, the latest LICTD album with new content, reached number one on Mexican New Age Sales Charts.

At present, the band is based in Leipzig, Germany.  The band performed at major international festivals including, Wave-Gotik-Treffen in 2003 and 2005 and the annual Bach Festival Leipzig in 2003.
