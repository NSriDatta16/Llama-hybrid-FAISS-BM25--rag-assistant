Pemberton Township School District is a comprehensive community public school district headquartered in Pemberton Township, New Jersey, United States, serving students in pre-kindergarten through twelfth grade. The district is one of 31 former Abbott districts statewide that were established pursuant to the decision by the New Jersey Supreme Court in Abbott v. Burke which are now referred to as "SDA Districts" based on the requirement for the state to cover all costs for school building and renovation projects in these districts under the supervision of the New Jersey Schools Development Authority. The school district serves Pemberton Township (including the communities of Browns Mills, Country Lake Estates, Pemberton Heights and Presidential Lakes Estates and the Pemberton Township portion of Fort Dix) along with Pemberton Borough.

As of the 2021–22 school year, the district, comprised of nine schools, had an enrollment of 4,443 students.

The district is classified by the New Jersey Department of Education as being in District Factor Group "B", the second lowest of eight groupings. District Factor Groups organize districts statewide to allow comparison by common socioeconomic characteristics of the local districts. From lowest socioeconomic status to highest, the categories are A, B, CD, DE, FG, GH, I and J.

History
Previously the district had two high schools, and in 1989 had plans to expand space at High School No. 2.

In 1991 the district began reducing access to interviewing students who were living on-post at Fort Dix and students of other Fort Dix families, stating that military parents wanted such access reduced.

In 1996, legislation signed into law would allow the Woodland Township School District to sever its sending/receiving relationship with the Pemberton Township School District and join the Lenape Regional High School District. Woodland Township had been sending about 30 students a year -- and nearly $300,000 in tuition payments -- to join the 1,350 students at Pemberton Township High School as part of a relationship that dated back to the 1920s. For years, the Pemberton district had refused Woodland Township's repeated requests to terminate the relationship. In May 1997, the Lenape district agreed to start accepting students from Woodland Township at Lenape High School starting with the 1997-98 school year and to add Woodland Township as the regional district's eight constituent municipality.

In 1997 the district had almost 7,000 students, with about 700 living on Fort Dix. That year there were plans to shift the Fort Dix students to North Hanover schools. Pemberton school officials were against that move.

Operations
 the U.S. military directly pays the school district for education of students, since the district cannot collect property-based school taxes from families on military bases.

Attendance area
It is the singular school district for most of the township, except portions on Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, which is listed by the United States Census Bureau as having its own school district. Students on portions of the joint base attend area school district public schools, as the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) does not operate any schools on that base. Students on-post in the McGuire and Dix areas (McGuire Air Force Base and Fort Dix) may attend one of the following in their grade levels, with all siblings in a family taking the same choice: Pemberton Township District, North Hanover Township School District, and Northern Burlington County Regional School District.

Awards and recognition
Pemberton High School was awarded AP District Honor Roll for simultaneously achieving increases in access to Advanced Placement courses for a broader number of students and also maintaining or improved rate at which the school's AP students earned scores of 3 or higher on an AP Exam.

In the 2016–2017 school year, Helen Fort Newcomb Middle School, Howard Emmons School and Alexander Denbo School were recognized as State Schools of Character by the New Jersey Alliance for Social, Emotional, and Character Development.

In the 2017–2018 school year, Samuel Busansky, Fort Dix, Harker-Wylie and Joseph Stackhouse elementary schools, along with Pemberton Early Childhood Education Center were recognized as State Schools of Character by the NEW Jersey Alliance for Social, Emotional, and Character Development.

Student body
In 1988 23% of the students in the Pemberton district were from military families.
