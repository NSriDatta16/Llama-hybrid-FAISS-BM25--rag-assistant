The Chicago Force was a women's American football team. Founded in 2003 by Lisa Cole, the team played at De La Salle HS & St. Rita HS – both on Chicago's South side; Lane Stadium at Lane Technical College Prep High School, Holmgren Athletic Complex at North Park University on Chicago's North Side, and at Jorndt Field, commonly known as Winnemac Stadium. The team played the 2012–2014 seasons at Lazier Field on the campus of Evanston Township High School, and for the 2015 season onward, back at Lane Tech.

From their inaugural season until 2010, the Chicago Force was part of the Independent Women's Football League.  Following that, the team moved to the Women's Football Alliance.  The Chicago Force ceased operations after the 2017 season.
