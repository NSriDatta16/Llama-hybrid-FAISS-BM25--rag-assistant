A very important person (VIP or V.I.P.) or personage is a person who is accorded special privileges due to their high social status, influence, or importance. The term was not common until sometime after World War II by RAF pilots.

Examples include celebrities, heads of state or government, other politicians, major employers, high rollers, high-level corporate officers, bankers, economists, physicians, clergy, military personnel, nobles, wealthy individuals, or any other socially notable person who receives special treatment for any reason. The special treatment usually involves separation from common people, and a higher level of comfort or service.

In some cases, such as with tickets, VIP may be used as a title in a similar way to premium or exclusive. Usually, VIP tickets can be purchased by anyone, but still meaning separation from other customers, own security checks etc.

Sometimes, the term very very important person (VVIP or V.V.I.P.) is also used, especially with reference to VIPs with very high rank or spending power. It is used especially when anyone can buy VIP treatment, to distinguish people with especially high requirements. And V.V.V.I.P. can denote even another level of exclusivity.
