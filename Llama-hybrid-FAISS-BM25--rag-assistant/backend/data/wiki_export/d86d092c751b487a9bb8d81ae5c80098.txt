History

The town takes its name from the pastoral run name in the 1840s. It is believed to be a corruption of the Kabi word (Dauwabra dialect) meaning dead trees.

Tiaro Provisional School opened on 4 October 1870. On 21 January 1878, it became Tiaro State School.

Tiaro had one of the first butter factories in Queensland. Baron Jones built the factory near the railway station in the early 1880s and used horses to churn butter. Cheese factories were built at Tiaro in 1890 and 1894. The Tiaro Butter Factory was closed temporarily on 1 July 1897 due to a short supply of milk. The Maryborough Chronicle reported “On the whole the season has been fairly good, but the supply very short for a district like Tiaro. This, however, was principally owing to the winter last year being so severe, also the year before, when great numbers of milking cows died, and last spring being so dry”. Although the factory opened again, it struggled to make a profit. The factory was later relocated to Murgon in 1913 as most of the cream suppliers came from that district.

Brown Ridge Provisional School opened on 1908. On 1 January 1909, it became Brown Ridge State School. It closed in 1922, but reopened in 1924. It closed permanently in 1925. It was on the western side of Nugent Road ().
The Tiaro War Memorial commemorates those who served in World War I. It was unveiled on 25 April 1921 (ANZAC Day) by Sir Thomas William Glasgow.

The Tiaro library opened in 2006.
