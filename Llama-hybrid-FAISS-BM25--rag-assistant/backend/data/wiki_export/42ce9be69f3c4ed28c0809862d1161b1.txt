Reyna Grande (born 7 September 1975, Iguala, Guerrero, Mexico) is a Mexican-American author.

Biography 
Grande grew up in poverty with her two siblings in Iguala, Guerrero. When she was two years old, her father moved to the U.S. to earn money to build a house in Iguala but wasn't successful.  He called for Grande's mother, who left Grande and her siblings with their paternal grandmother. Her father later returned to take her eldest sibling to the United States, but Grande and her other siblings wanted to go as well. Thus, Grande traveled to the U.S. as an undocumented child immigrant via an illegal border crossing at the age of about 9. She went on to become the first in her family to obtain a college degree.

Grande attended Pasadena City College and later transferred to University of California, Santa Cruz, where she obtained a B.A. degree in literature/creative writing. She later received her M.F.A. in creative writing from Antioch University. She has been honored with an American Book Award, the El Premio Aztlan Literary Award, the Luis Leal Award for Distinction in Chicano/Latino Literature, the California Latino Spirit Award, and most recently, the Barnes and Noble Writers for Writers Award from Poets & Writers.

Grande is a member of the prestigious Macondo Writers Workshop, the workshop founded by Sandra Cisneros. She has taught creative writing at UCLA Extension's Writer's Program, at VONA (Voices of Our Nation's Arts), the Latino Writer's Conference, Under the Volcano, and more.

Work 
Grande's first novel, Across a Hundred Mountains. draws heavily on her own experiences growing up in Mexico and as an undocumented immigrant in the U.S. The book was selected by a number of common read programs.

Grande's second novel, Dancing with Butterflies (Washington Square Press, 2009), was published to critical acclaim. An excerpt of Dancing with Butterflies was published in 2008 as a short story, titled "Adriana," in Latinos in Lotusland: An Anthology of Contemporary Southern California Literature (Bilingual Press), edited by Daniel Olivas.

In 2012, Atria Books published Grande's memoir, The Distance Between Us, a novel about the true and raw difficulties that migrants face when going to a new country without being able to understand the language. It is described as, a coming-of-age story about her life before and after coming to the U.S. as an undocumented child immigrant. In an interview published by the Los Angeles Review of Books on 6 December 2012, Grande explained why she decided to part from fiction to tell her story:

The Distance Between Us was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award (autobiography category). In 2016, Aladdin, a division of Simon and Schuster, republished the memoir as a young readers adaptation for ages 10–14.
