Sentul is a suburb located within the northern part of the city centre in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in the constituency of Batu. The vicinity of Sentul is sandwiched between Bukit Tunku and Titiwangsa.

History
Sentul is a former railway hub famous for its old-world charm, historical temples and prewar shops. During World War II, Sentul was one of the last towns in Kuala Lumpur that was heavily bombed by the British B-29 planes without any warning on 19 February 1945. The bomb targets were two rail complexes managed by Marai Tetsudo, the Japanese name for the former Federated Malay States Railway (FMSR). The destruction of the central workshop signified the end of the Japanese Occupation in Malaya.

Most of the early residents in Sentul were Indians working in the train depot and central workshop built by the British, dating back to 1896.
