Reception 
Vasanthi Hariprakash of The New Indian Express opined that "The director deals with no issue in full, whether it is the trauma of an AIDS-afflicted person or the hopes of a wannabe, leaving the audience absolutely unmoved. The songs, especially the chart-buster Musu Musu, are highly hummable, but they don’t really gel with the movie". Sharmila Taliculam of Rediff.com wrote ″Pyar Mein Kabhi Kabhi may have had something to it if it had a story, a strong script, and not just dabbled in sentimental tripe. But it still has tried to maintain a youthful feel throughout. But while the cast is on a feel good trip, the audience slowly stops smiling and look forward to the arrival of some maturity.″
