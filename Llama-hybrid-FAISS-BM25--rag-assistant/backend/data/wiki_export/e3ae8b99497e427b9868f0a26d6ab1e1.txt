"Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes)" is the debut single by Edison Lighthouse. The song reached the number one spot on the UK Singles Chart on the week ending 31 January 1970, where it remained for a total of five weeks.
It also became the first number one single of the 1970s (not counting Rolf Harris's "Two Little Boys" which was a holdover from 1969).

Background
"Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes)" was written by Tony Macaulay and Barry Mason and was first recorded by Geoff Turton as "Jefferson" but not released until years later. Tony Burrows with session musicians recorded it next. "Love Grows" entered the UK top 40 at No. 12 on 24 January 1970 – an unusually high new entry for a debut act. A week later, the track climbed eleven places to No. 1, becoming the first new UK chart-topper of the 1970s. After a five-week stay at the top, "Love Grows" dropped to No. 4, replaced by "Wand'rin' Star" by Lee Marvin. Whilst at No. 1, Edison Lighthouse held off strong competition from Peter, Paul and Mary ("Leaving on a Jet Plane") and Canned Heat ("Let's Work Together"). Eventually, after a 12-week run, "Love Grows" left the UK top 40 on 18 April 1970.
 
When "Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes)" became a hit, a group needed to be assembled rapidly to perform the song on Top of the Pops. The pair found a group called Greenfield Hammer, who a week later appeared on Top of the Pops as 'Edison Lighthouse' to mime to the fastest-climbing number-one hit record in history. Burrows sang the song on the programme on four separate weeks in January and February 1970 and on each show he also appeared singing lead for either Brotherhood of Man ("United We Stand") or White Plains ("My Baby Loves Lovin'"), who also had hits during that same month-long stretch.

In the U.S., the Edison Lighthouse version of "Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes)" came close to facing competition from a cover version that ABC-Dunhill Records wished to cut with well-established top 40 hitmakers The Grass Roots; however, the latter group passed on the song, reportedly because Grass Roots frontman Rob Grill balked at singing a love song that might be presumed to reference co-member Warren Entner's wife Rosemarie Frankland. Issued in the U.S. in February 1970, "Love Grows" by Edison Lighthouse entered the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100 dated 28 February 1970 at No. 68, to reach a peak position of No. 5 on 28 March, remaining there for two weeks. After a 12-week run, "Love Grows" exited the US top 40 on 23 May.

"Love Grows" reached number 3 on the Canadian RPM Top Singles chart and number 3 in South Africa in February 1970.

Toward the end of 2021, the song saw a massive resurgence due to it becoming popular on TikTok. Between December 25, 2021 and January 3, 2022, the song saw a growth of 1,490% in its on-demand audio streams, and moved onto Spotify's U.S. Top 200 Chart.
