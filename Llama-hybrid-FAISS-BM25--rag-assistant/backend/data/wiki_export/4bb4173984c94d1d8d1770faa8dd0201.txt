General elections were held in Uruguay on 31 October, alongside a constitutional referendum. The result was a victory for the Broad Front, marking the first time a party other than the Colorado Party or National Party had held power since the two parties were formed in the 1830s.

Broad Front leader Tabaré Vázquez was elected president on his third attempt after his party won just over 50% of the vote, enough for him to win the presidency in a single round. To date, this is the only time that a presidential election has been decided without a runoff since the two-round system was introduced in 1999. The Broad Front also won majorities in the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate.

Primaries
The Uruguayan presidential primaries were held on 27 June 2004. Most parties  had only one candidate running unopposed, including Tabaré Vázquez of Broad Front–Progressive Encounter–New Majority; Pablo Mieres of the Independent Party; Victor Lissindi of the Intrasigent Party; Aldo Lamorte of the Civic Union; and Rafael Fernández of the Workers' Party. Jorge Larrañaga, Luis Alberto Lacalle, and Cristina Maeso competed to represent the National Party, with Larrañaga claiming the role. Guillermo Stirling defeated Alberto Iglesias, Ricardo Lombardo, Manuel Flores Silva, Eisenhower Cardoso, Jorge Ruiz, and Gustavo Boquete to represent the Colorado Party. Julio Vera was chosen to represent the Liberal Party over Ramón Díaz and José Curotto.
