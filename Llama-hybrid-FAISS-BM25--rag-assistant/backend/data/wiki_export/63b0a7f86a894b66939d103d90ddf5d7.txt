Their first World Championships was in 1999 when they finished in fifth. 2000 was no better, when they finished in 7th place. Finally in 2001 Norway got a break, picking up the bronze medal. They would then go on to win the gold medal at the 2002 Winter Olympics followed by a silver at the World Championships that year. Since then, the team has had some success. They have finished no worse than fourth place at the Worlds or the European Championships. They picked up a bronze at the Worlds in 2003, a bronze at the European Championships in 2004 and a gold at the European Championships in 2005.
