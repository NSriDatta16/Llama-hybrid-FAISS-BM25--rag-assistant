Biography
Pavel Schönfeld was born in Prague on 27 October 1917. He left Czechoslovakia as a young man to evade the Nazis. In Great Britain, he adopted the pseudonym Tigrid (after river Tigris) when he worked as a broadcaster of anti-fascist propaganda in BBC, and kept it for the rest of his life. Returning after the end of World War II, he continued his publishing career, soon clashing with the ascendant communist ideology. Fleeing arrest, he emigrated to West Germany, later moved to United States and finally settled in France. During the Cold War, Tigrid was a prominent representative of Czech anti-communist exile, authored several books and published numerous publications, for example the magazine Svědectví ("Testimony"), read both in exile circles and by dissidents in Czechoslovakia from 1956 to 1992. He returned to Prague for the second time after the Velvet Revolution, was active in public life and served as the minister of culture (1994–96), but after an unsuccessful campaign for election to the Czech Senate, he retired to France where he died in 2003.
