ろ, in hiragana, or ロ in katakana, (romanised as ro) is one of the Japanese kana, each of which represents one mora. The hiragana is written in one stroke, katakana in three. Both represent  and both originate from the Chinese character 呂. The Ainu language uses a small ㇿ to represent a final r sound after an o sound (オㇿ or). The combination of an R-column kana letter with handakuten ゜ – ろ゚ in hiragana and ロ゚ in katakana – was introduced to represent [lo] in the early 20th century.
