Gyeongae of Silla (died 927) (r. 924–927) was the 55th ruler of the Korean kingdom of Silla.

Biography

He was the son of King Sindeok by Queen Uiseong, and was the younger brother of King Gyeongmyeong, who preceded him to the throne.

Gyeongae ascended the Silla throne in the midst of the Later Three Kingdoms period, and thus ruled over only a small portion of what had once been Unified Silla.  In the end, even that last small portion was overwhelmed by Hubaekje forces under Gyeon Hwon.

When Gyeon Hwon's army sacked Gyeongju in 927, they found Gyeongae partying at the Poseokjeong pavilion.  The king killed himself rather than surrender.  Gyeon Hwon set Gyeongsun on the throne in his stead, and returned to the west.

King Gyeongae was buried on Namsan.  His tomb is called "Haemongnyeong."
