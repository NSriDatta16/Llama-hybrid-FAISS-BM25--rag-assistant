Trasmediterránea operates passengers and cargo ferries between mainland Spain and the Canary Islands, the Balearic Islands, and northern Africa's Spanish territories.

Since 2017 the majority of the company belongs to Naviera Armas.

History
The Trasmediterránea ("cross-mediterranean") company was constituted on November 26, 1916, with the fusion of the companies of shipowners José Juan Dómine, Vicente Ferrer, Joaquín Tintoré and Enrique García, though it didn't start operating until January 1 of following year. It was headquartered in Barcelona and had a fleet of 45 ships.

During the Spanish Civil War, its ships were used as auxiliary navy ships by both sides of the conflict, the Spanish Republican Navy and the Nationalist faction.

In 1978, it became a state-owned company, until it was privatized by the PP government in 2002. The SEPI sold the company to a consortium that consisted of Acciona Logística (60%), Caja de Ahorros del Mediterráneo, Compañía de Remolcadores Ibaizábal, Agrupación Hotelera Dóliga, Suministros Ibiza and Naviera Armas. Later, the company changed its name to Acciona-Trasmediterranea. Currently it operates a fleet of 25 ships and is headquartered in Madrid.

From 1921 to 1998, when the sector was liberalized, it had the monopoly on the lines that linked the mainland Spain with the islands and northern Africa. Today, even as it has lost its monopoly and has competition, Trasmediterránea is still leader in its sector.

At the end of October 2017, Acciona group agreed to sell its 92.7% stake in Trasmediterránea to Naviera Armas, another Spanish shipping company operating ferries mainly in the Canary Islands. The deal, pending approval by Spanish authorities, was expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2018.
