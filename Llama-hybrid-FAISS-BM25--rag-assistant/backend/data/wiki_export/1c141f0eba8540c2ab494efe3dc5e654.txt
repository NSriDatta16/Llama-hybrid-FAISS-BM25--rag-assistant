The school serves the following communities: Crystal River, Homosassa, and sections of Black Diamond, Citrus Springs, Homosassa Springs, Pine Ridge, and Sugarmill Woods.

Reconstruction

In 2010, the school began a major renovation of its facilities. The first phase included a new baseball field, a new administration building with classrooms, as well as a second classroom building, both of which were constructed on the school's original baseball field. This phase of construction also included the demolition of the school's original classroom building from 1969.  Phase 1 of construction was completed in August 2011.

The second phase of construction, which began shortly after the first completed, included a new Media Center, a third classroom building housing a Freshman Academy, renovations to the old Administration building to house the school's Health Academy, demolition of half of the school's other classroom building, and expansion of the school's cafeteria. As of 2022, construction has been finished for an unknown amount of time.

2000-2001: The "Victory Bell" (once located in the high school courtyard and used to celebrate athletic victories) goes missing before the beginning of school in August. Although Citrus High School students had relocated the bell many times in the past as a prank, the bell had always been discovered; the bell was found this time at the Citrus football field. "C.H.S. Rules" was written in the sand next to where the bell had once lived.

2003-2004: Citrus High School students climbed the fence of Crystal River High School the night before homecoming. They were dressed in camouflage, and they were armed with paintball guns. Their goal was to paintball the school floats that would be used for the homecoming parade. MTV later became aware of the prank, and the Citrus High School students (along with the participation of some Crystal River High School students) reenacted the nights events. It was aired on MTV's High School Stories.
