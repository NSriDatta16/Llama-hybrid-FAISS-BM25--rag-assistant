Introduced by Kodak in the 1956, C-22 is an obsolete process for developing color film, superseded by the C-41 process in 1972 for the launch of 110 film and in 1974 for all other formats.

The development of the film material is carried out at temperatures of around 75째F (24째C), making the process incompatible with the more modern C-41 process, which uses a temperature of 100째F (38째C).  C-22 uses Color Developing Agent 3, unlike C-41, which uses Color Developing Agent 4.

The most common film requiring this process is Kodacolor-X.

C-22 film can still (as of 2020) be developed in black and white.
