William Maxwell Reed (January 12, 1871 in Bath, Maine â€“ September 1962) was a pioneering U.S. author of illustrated science books for children.

After schooling at Harvard, he taught astronomy at Harvard and Princeton University.

Reed later went into the steel industry.

Beginning as a series of letters to his nephew, his first book, The Earth for Sam, was published in 1929. The book remains popular and was republished in 2005.

Earth was followed by a series of popular children's information books, many published by Harcourt, Brace.
