The South Australian Derby is a South Australian Jockey Club Group 1 Thoroughbred horse race for three-year-olds, at set weights, run over a distance of 2,500 metres at Morphettville Racecourse in Adelaide, Australia during the SAJC Autumn Carnival.

History
The inaugural running of the race was on 5 January 1860 at Thebarton Racecourse which is located today in Mile End. The race was called The Thebarton Derby and had stakes of 100 sovereigns with an additional sweep of 10 sovereigns with a forfeit of 2 sovereigns. The race was won by the famous colonial pastoralist C.B. Fisher's, four-year-old mare Midnight who carried 8 stone 10 pounds and ridden by jockey Simpson in a time of 2:54.

By 1862 the race was simply known as The Derby and in 1866 the Summer meet was held before Christmas Day. For a period of seven years between 1869 and 1875 the race was not held. When the race was resumed in 1876 it was held at Morphettville Racecourse and it was held in September during the SAJC Spring meeting.

The early winner Tim Whiffler is not to be confused with the 1867 Melbourne Cup winner of the same name.

The race attracted many fine horses who would later excel in other prestigious races around the country. 1880 saw The Assyrian, a son of Countryman (GB) win the race and two years later win the Melbourne Cup.

1903 saw the simply named F.J.A. prevail and the son of Wallace would also win a VRC Derby, Toorak Handicap and The All Aged Stakes.

1961 winner Gatum Gatum also went on to win the Melbourne Cup in 1963 while the 1972 winner Dayana was a Perth Cup winner in 1973.

Subzero won the race in 1992 and he would win the Melbourne Cup on a wet track the next season, and also the G1 Adelaide Cup.

The 2009 winner Rebel Raider succeeded after earlier he won the VRC Derby.

Fillies have also had some success in the race. Most recently Delicacy completed the Australasian Oaks–SA Derby double in 2015.
