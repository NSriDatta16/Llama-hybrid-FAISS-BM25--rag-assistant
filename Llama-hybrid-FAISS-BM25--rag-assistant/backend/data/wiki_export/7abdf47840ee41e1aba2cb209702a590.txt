The San Roque González de Santa Cruz Bridge is a  long cable-stayed bridge that crosses the Paraná River between the cities of Posadas, capital of Misiones Province, Argentina and Encarnación, capital of Itapúa, Paraguay. The main bridge is  long and the approaching viaduct is  long.  

The bridge, named for the founder of the missions which evolved into both cities, was first projected in 1977 through an agreement between the governments of Argentina and Paraguay, as a compensation to Paraguay for the flooding of part of its territory by the Yacyretá Dam. Its construction began in 1981 and was planned to last three years, but was finished only in 1990. It was construct by a consortium leading by the Italian company Impregilo.

The road-rail bridge also carries the Posadas-Encarnacion International Train.
