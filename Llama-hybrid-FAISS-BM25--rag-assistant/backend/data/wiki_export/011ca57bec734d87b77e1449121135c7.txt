Unorthodox is the second full-length studio album by the Swedish death metal band Edge of Sanity.  It was recorded between December 1991 and January 1992 with Tomas Skogsberg and released by Black Mark on July 8, 1992.

Dan Swanö has claimed that this is his favorite Edge of Sanity album, and even went as far as to call it "perfect". Though primarily death metal, some tracks on this album foreshadow the shift to more melodic sounds which would take shape on 1993's "The Spectral Sorrows". This is also the first Edge of Sanity album (one of the first death metal albums) to feature clean vocals, which appear briefly in the track "Enigma".
