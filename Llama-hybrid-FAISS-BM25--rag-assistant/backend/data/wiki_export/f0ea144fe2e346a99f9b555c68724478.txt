The Air Member for Personnel (AMP) is the senior Royal Air Force officer who is responsible for personnel matters and is a member of the Air Force Board. The AMP is in charge of all aspects of recruiting, non-operational flying and ground training, career management, welfare, terms, and conditions of service, and resettlement for RAF regular, reserve, and civilian staffs worldwide.

In 1918 on the establishment of the post it was titled the Master-General of Personnel, while from 1919 to 1923 the post was designated as the Director of Personnel. Thereafter it has been known by its current title, the Air Member for Personnel. In 1994 with the establishment of Personnel and Training Command (PTC), the post of Commander-in-Chief PTC and the Air Member for Personnel were held concurrently by a single officer at any one time. In 2007 PTC was disbanded and from then onward, the Air Member for Personnel has been double-hatted as Deputy Commander-in-Chief Air Command with responsibility for No. 22 Group RAF and RAF personnel management functions.

History
The post of Master-General of Personnel was established on 3 January 1918 and the occupant sat on the Air Council. The first incumbent was Major-General Godfrey Paine. Some time in April or June 1919, the post was downgraded to Director of Personnel within the Department of the Chief of the Air Staff and the incumbent ceased to sit on the Air Council. However, in 1923 the appointment of Director of Personnel was upgraded to that of Air Member for Personnel and re-appointed to the Air Council.

On 1 April 1994, at the establishments of Personnel and Training Command, the new Air Officer Commanding in Chief was also appointed as Air Member for Personnel. Upon the merger of Personnel and Training Command with Strike Command to form RAF Air Command on 1 April 2007, the post of AOC Personnel and Training was re-designated as Deputy Commander-in-Chief Personnel (DCinC Pers), retaining the responsibility to Chief of the Air Staff as Air Member for Personnel.
