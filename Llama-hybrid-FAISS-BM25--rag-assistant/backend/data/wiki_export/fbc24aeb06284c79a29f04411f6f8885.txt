Tórsvøllur is a football stadium on the sport site of Gundadalur in Tórshavn, the capital of the Faroe Islands. The stadium holds 6,500 people, and was built in 1999 to become the country's national stadium to provide an artificial grass surface on which international football matches could be played. Previously, the Faroe Islands national team played its home matches in the town of Toftir at Svangaskarð stadium.

In August 2011, floodlights were introduced; these were first officially used for the football match between Faroe Islands and Italy on 2 September 2011.
