The second ship of the class, , sailed on its maiden voyage on 19 May 2007. The third ship of the class, , was delivered and started work out of Southampton in April 2008.

Design 

The Freedom-class ships are similar in design and layout to the earlier second-generation , including an ice skating rink and a  central atrium named the Royal Promenade, featuring a pub, shops, arcades, bars, and a 24-hour Cafe Promenade. New features added to the Freedom class include the FlowRider surf park, cantilevered whirlpools, a full-size boxing ring, and the H2O Zone waterpark.

The first ship, Freedom of the Seas, is estimated to have cost US$800 million.

Future 
In March 2008, Aker Yards and Royal Caribbean announced a memorandum of agreement for a fourth ship in the class, subject to board approval and finalization of terms and conditions, but no actual order for the ship was ever announced. In 2011, Royal Caribbean announced that it had ordered two ships from the similarly sized , making an order for a fourth Freedom-class ship unlikely.
