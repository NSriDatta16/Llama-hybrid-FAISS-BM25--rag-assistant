History of Henan Cuisine 

The History of Henan Cuisine dates back to the late Xia Dynasty in the 21st to the 17th century BC. Within this period, the entirety of Henan Cuisine underwent rapid and robust changes to accommodate the different emerging culinary cultures from the surrounding regions. By the end of the Xia dynasty, there was an entire banquet system based on Henan dishes. By the time the Shang Dynasty began in the 17th century BC, Henan Cuisine was redesigned with the new seasoning including all different flavours to bring a more harmonious element to it. This formed the base for most of the later Chinese cuisines.

Afterward in the period of the Northern Song Dynasty (around 960 – 1127 AD), Henan Cuisine reached its zenith. With the establishment of the capital city in Kaifeng, Henan, there was an uprise in the invention of a variety of new snacks. With rapid growth and development in the frying skills of the people, there was a peaking of a rise in fried food as well. Around this time, Henan Cuisine was also beginning to be divided into five kinds of dishes based on social status and religious backgrounds. The dishes for the imperial courthouses were different from the ones found in high-class localities, markets, in the temples and those found in common folk households.

With the fall of the Southern Song Dynasty around 1170 – 1180 AD, there was a decline in the quality and nature of the Henan cuisine. It was evident that the imperial stronghold was significant for the Henan Cuisine to survive and without the strength of the dynasty, the hierarchical structure for Henan cuisine started to break down. Later, basing on the original Henan Culinary style followed in the imperial courts, high class families, markets, temples and households, a mixed blend of contemporary Henan Cuisine was developed. Much like the nature of its flavours – harmony in terms of social status was also shown to be a diversifying feature of the Henan Cuisine. The mixed blend of Henan Cuisine as developed, gradually evolved into what it is like today. Over time, the contact with the nearby regions on all sides, especially with Beijing on the North and the influence from the Jiangsu Culinary styles poured over to the Henan Cuisine styles and helped it evolve into what it is like today.

Cultural Relevance of Henan Cuisine 
Chinese Cuisine is normally quite intricately linked with the culture of the place it is from. Henan Cuisine too is not so different, as it embraces the notion of mean and harmony in most of its cuisines. Given that Henan is an entirely landlocked province, the influence from the neighbouring regions are quite evident in the culture of the province, as much as it is evident in the culinary styles and dishes. One feature that is evident in the constantly evolving Henan Cuisines is the use of animal fat. Previously, animal fat was frequently used in Henan cuisine to fry foods, but given partly the influence of neighbouring regions and partly the influence of the growing health concerns, it is slowly seeing a decline.
