Characters

Main characters
Zenki

Zenki is among Enno Ozunu's most powerful warriors: the Demon God of Crimson Thunder Light in the Dark whose power is mainly sources from Thunder and Fire. In the early episodes, Chiaki needed to use the bracelet to transform Zenki into his true form - a giant defiant Demon Lord and a force to be reckoned with in battles. Zenki is undoubtedly powerful, yet rebellious. He can be quite reckless and naive, takes no one's order, and often prefers brawn over brains. In some cases, however, Zenki's anger allows him to transform into his true self. With the help of the bracelet and , Zenki's most faithful comrade, Chiaki is able to transform him into the Ultimate Demon Warrior. The bracelet is no longer necessary when Chiaki attains higher power in the final episode of the anime, after the bracelet is severely damaged, though this does not happen in the manga. Zenki loves eating the Karuma Seeds and switches to bananas when there's no seed.
Chiaki Enno

Chiaki Enno is a normal highschool girl, living in a shrine with her grandmother Saki (or lives alone as in the manga). Chiaki takes care of the shrine, and often wears a priestess outfit. She is the direct descendant of Ozunu Enno, the great Bodhisattva who had the power to harness the Demon Gods and fought against evil. Chiaki is also able to turn Zenki into his true Demon God form, casting powerful spells and increase the strength of Zenki. She also managed to summon a small fluffy lovely Guardian Spirit, Lulupapa, who is the mascot of the team.
Her parents are working abroad and hence do not appear in the anime. Chiaki is kind, honest and has a good heart. She believes in people and wants to protect them. Chiaki has three dear friends at school (Sayaka, Ako, and Ayame). She gets along very well with Akira/Goki (from season 2 onwards) but often quarrels with Zenki as though he were her little brother, mostly because he is disobedient and shows no respect to other people. The bond between the trio becomes powerful and indestructible in later chapters when they face the evil together.
Goki/Akira Gotou

Goki is among Enno Ozunu's most powerful warriors: the Demon God of Azure Light, of Protection and Revival. He was Zenki's most faithful comrade in the past, and has now reincarnated in the form of a human boy named Akira Gotou (or Gokimaru as in the manga), though without most of his elemental powers [Aether-Earth-Water-Fire-Wind]. Goki's deep love for humanity has resulted in his union with a mortal and got several half-demon kids together with her, which marked the beginning of his bloodline on Earth more than a thousand years ago. Goki is wise, kind, well-mannered and fiercely loyal to the Enno lineage. Despite his limited power in present days, he acts as Chiaki's mentor/best friend and is greatly supportive of his new master, always there to protect her, Zenki and their friends at the expense of his life. He is a martial artist, loves making sculptures and drawing, and is known as the Peace-loving Demon Guardian Warrior God.
