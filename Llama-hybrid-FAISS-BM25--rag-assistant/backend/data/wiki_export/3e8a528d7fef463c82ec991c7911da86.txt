The former municipality encompassed the eastern part of the island of Sørøya, the northern part of the island of Seiland, and the northern part of Kvaløya (with the exception of the town of Hammerfest).

History

The municipality of Hammerfest landdistrikt ("the rural district of Hammerfest") was established on 1 January 1852 when it was separated from the town of Hammerfest.  The initial population of Sørøysund was 1,256.  On 1 July 1869, the southern district of Kvalsund (population: 514) was separated from Hammerfest landdistrikt to form a municipality of its own, leaving Hammerfest landdistrikt with 932 inhabitants.  On 1 January 1875, a small part of Hammerfest landdistrikt (population: 20) was transferred to the neighboring town-municipality of Hammerfest. On 1 January 1919, the name of the municipality was changed from Hammerfest landdistrikt to Sørøysund.  On 1 January 1963, another small area of Sørøysund (population: 33) was transferred to the town of Hammerfest.  On 1 January 1992, Sørøysund was merged into the neighbouring town-municipality of Hammerfest.  Prior to the merger, Sørøysund had 2,341 inhabitants.

Name
The municipality was originally named Hammerfest landdistrikt since it was the rural district surrounding the town of Hammerfest (the town was established in 1789). The town was named after an old anchorage for boats. The first element comes from the Old Norse word  which means "stone" or "steep cliff", referring to a number of large rocks, good for mooring boats. (These rocky areas were covered up in land reclaiming during the early post-war years.) The last element comes from the Old Norse word  which means "rope" or "fastening" (for boats). The second word in the name is  which simply means "rural district".

On 1 January 1919, the name of the municipality was changed from Hammerfest landdistrikt to Sørøysund. The new name comes from the Sørøysundet strait which flows through the municipality. The first part of Sørøysund comes from the name of the local island Sørøya (). The first element of the island's name comes from the Old Norse word  which means "south". The last element of the island's name is  which means "island". The second part of Sørøysund is  which means "strait" or "sound". The Sørøysundet passes between the islands of Sørøya, Seiland, Stjernøya, and Kvaløya.

Coat of arms
The coat of arms was granted on 8 June 1979. The official blazon is "Azure, three boats argent two and one" (). This means the arms have a blue field (background) and the charge is three boats; two smaller ones over one larger one. The boats have a tincture of argent which means they are commonly colored white, but if it is made out of metal, then silver is used. The boats were chosen to show the importance of fishing in Sørøysund. The number three also refers to the three islands in the municipality: Sørøya, Kvaløya, and Seiland. The arms were designed by Arvid Sveen.

During its existence, this municipality was governed by a municipal council of directly elected representatives. The mayor was indirectly elected by a vote of the municipal council.
