Barak (; died 1429) was Khan of the Golden Horde from 1423 to 1429. His father was Quyurchuq, the son of Urus Khan, who was a descendant of Tuqa-Timur, the son of Jochi, the eldest son of Genghis Khan. 

Barak took support from Ulugh Beg, the Timurid khan, and in 1422 he dethroned Kepek, Ulugh Muhammad as well as Dawlat Berdi, khans of the Golden Horde. And Barak Khan reoccupied Sighnak from the Timurids. However, he was defeated in 1427 by Ulugh Muhammad and was promptly assassinated by Jochi's descendant, Mohammed, who claimed the steppe between the Ural and Syr Darya rivers for his dynasty.

In the 1460s, Barak’s sons, Kirai and Janibek rebelled against Abu'l-Khayr Khan and they immigrated to the environs of Jeti Su (Seven Rivers) and  established the Kazakh Khanate.
