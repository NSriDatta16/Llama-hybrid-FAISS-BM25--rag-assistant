The Highway Hockey League is a men's senior ice hockey league sanctioned by Hockey Saskatchewan and Hockey Canada.

History
The league was formed in 1965 with five teams in Bulyea, Drake, Govan, Lumsden, and Strasbourg. Many teams have come and gone throughout the history of the league. Twenty-three towns have had teams in the league at one point. Teams compete for the HHL Robert Schultz Trophy and SHA Provincial championships.

The Raymore Rockets won the Robert Schultz Trophpy ten times, which is the most of any team.

For the 2022-23 season, the league merged with the Qu'Appelle Valley Hockey League and played the season under the QVHL banner.
