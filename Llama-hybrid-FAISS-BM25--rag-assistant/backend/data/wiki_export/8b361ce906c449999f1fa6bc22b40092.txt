Regional traditions

Indian thukpa
In India, the dish is consumed by people of Nepalese and Tibetan origin in the state of Sikkim, the district of Darjeeling and in the union territory of Ladakh.

Nepalese thukpa
The Nepalese version of Thukpa in general has a predominant vegetarian feature and a bit of spicier flavor. The protein ingredients of the dish are given vegetarian alternative according to availability, including beans, chickpeas, gram, kidney beans, etc. However, non-vegetarian thukpa are also enjoyed by non-vegs. Egg thukpa is probably the second most popular variety after vegetarian thukpa among Nepalese. Coriander leaves, spring onion, or garlic leaves are the popular Nepalese choices of garnish.

Bhutanese thukpa
The Bhutanese version of Thukpa tends to be sweeter than the Nepalese version.
