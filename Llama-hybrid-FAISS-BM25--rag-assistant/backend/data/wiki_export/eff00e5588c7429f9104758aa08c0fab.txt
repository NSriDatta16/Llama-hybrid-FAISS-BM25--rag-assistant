Totally Scott-Lee is a reality TV show from MTV (UK and Ireland) in 2005 featuring Lisa Scott-Lee of the group Steps, Andy Scott-Lee from Pop Idol and the group 3SL, Michelle Heaton of Liberty X, Nathan Moore (formerly of Brother Beyond and Worlds Apart), and publicist Sean Borg.

The show 
Totally Scott-Lee follows Lisa on her last-ditch effort at a solo career.

In the summer of 2005, it was revealed that a camera crew from MTV had been following Scott-Lee for nearly a year, tracking her life and those of her husband (Johnny Shentall of Hear'Say), her brother (Andy Scott-Lee), former publicist Sean Borg, '80s pop singer turned music manager Nathan Moore, and her brother's girlfriend Michelle Heaton (of Liberty X). The show was to be the UK version of MTV's US hit Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica.

The show, titled Totally Scott-Lee (originally Scott-Lee Unlimited) follows a year in Scott-Lee's life and her efforts to put her solo career back on track. In the show, Scott-Lee stated that she wanted to score a top ten hit with her next single or she would quit the music industry.

Lisa and the other cast members had no creative control of the series and Lisa Scott-Lee was unhappy with some of the promotional material, notably the subtitle "desperately seeking fame".

Lisa was signed to a small record label, Concept Records, and began recording songs for her next single. Concept chose "Electric", written by Guy Chambers, and started making plans for its release. The single had to be released on Monday 10 October 2005 in order to meet with deadlines for the show, with the chart position to be revealed live to Lisa on MTV the following Sunday.

The-then female head of Concept Records, Roseann McBride, has since gone on record (on the show and in private) several times saying that she was against the record being released on this date. One of the main reasons for this was that it would have very little promotion time (5 weeks as opposed to the usual 8â€“10 weeks).

"Electric" was released on 10 October 2005 and entered the UK top 40 on 16 October 2005 at number 13.
