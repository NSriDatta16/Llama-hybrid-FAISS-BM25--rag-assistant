Jordan da Costa, (November 24, 1932 – February 17, 2012), best known as simply Jordan, was a Brazilian football player.

Considered by Garrincha as his best defender he ever played against, Jordan was never sent off during his almost 14-year career. A skillful fullback, he was discovered by São Cristóvão in 1949 and three years later signed with Flamengo where he became an idol, winning the Rio State Championship three times in a row (1953-54-55), as well as the 1961 Rio-São Paulo Tournament.

With 609 matches for Flamengo, Jordan has the fourth-highest number of appearances for the club.

Jordan died on February 17, 2012, in Rio de Janeiro of complications from diabetes. He was 79 years old.
