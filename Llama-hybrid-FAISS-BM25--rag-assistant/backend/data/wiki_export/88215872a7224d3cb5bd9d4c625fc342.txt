Fort Worth Independent School District is a school district based in Fort Worth, Texas, United States. Based on a 2017-18 enrollment of 86,234 students, it is the fifth largest school district in Texas.

Fort Worth ISD serves most of the city of Fort Worth, and the cities of Benbrook, Westover Hills, and Westworth Village. The district also covers portions of Arlington, Edgecliff Village, Forest Hill, Haltom City, Kennedale, Sansom Park, White Settlement, and unincorporated portions of Tarrant County.

In 2010, the district unveiled one of the largest, most comprehensive redesigns of secondary education in the nation with its Gold Seal Programs of Choice and Gold Seal Schools of Choice. Each of its 13 high schools introduced curricula focused on college and career pathways. As part of the Gold Seal plan, the district has also opened a single-gender school for girls, the Young Women's Leadership Academy; a single-gender school for boys, the Young Men's Leadership Academy Paul Laurence Dunbar Young Men's Leadership Academy; an early college high school, Marine Creek Collegiate High School; and an early college medical high school, the Texas Academy of Biomedical Sciences.

In 2018, the school district was given an overall grade of "C" by the Texas Education Agency

History

Superintendent Walter Dansby, who started his FWISD career circa 1974, began his term in 2012. His base salary was $338,817.60. He resigned on Monday June 2, 2014,; the following day the district announced his severance pay, to be doled out over a seven month period, would be over $900,000. His final day of work was January 31, 2015.

In 2019 the district planned a major redraw of attendance boundaries, the first since circa 1999. In 2020 the FWISD board of education accepted proposed changes. Parents upset with some of the changes considered filing lawsuits to stop the changes.

Salary
Teacher salaries in the FWISD are above the state average and significantly higher than the minimum teacher salary schedule in Texas. For the 2018-19 school year, the salary for new teachers with a Bachelor's degree in FWISD averaged $53,000 with no experience. The 2018-19 average salary for teachers with 30 years experience is $70,000. Teachers with a Master's degree or higher and the same years of experience averaged $1,000-$1,500 more per year.
