A Kilner jar is a rubber-sealed, glass jar used for preserving (bottling) food. It was first produced in 1900 by John Kilner & Co., Yorkshire, England.

History 

The Kilner Jar was originally invented by John Kilner (1792–1857) and associates, and made by a firm of glass bottlemakers from Yorkshire called Kilner which he set up. The original Kilner bottlemakers operated from 1842, when the company was first founded, until 1937, when the company went into liquidation. 

In 2003, The Rayware Group purchased the Ravenhead name, including the design, patent and trademark of the original Kilner jar and continues to produce them today in China.
