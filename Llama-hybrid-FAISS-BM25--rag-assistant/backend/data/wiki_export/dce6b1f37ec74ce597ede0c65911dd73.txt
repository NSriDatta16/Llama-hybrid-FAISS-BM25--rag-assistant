Gameplay
Capcom vs. SNK uses a "ratio" system, where the "ratio" is a rating of a character's overall strength, ranging from 1 to 4. Teams of up to four can be assembled, but their combined ratios must equal and go no higher than 4. The gameplay uses the SNK-style four-button format. The player can also choose their "groove", or attack meter. The SNK Groove is based on the Extra mode that was used from The King of Fighters '94 to The King of Fighters '98, while the Capcom Groove is based on the gameplay system from the Street Fighter Alpha series.
