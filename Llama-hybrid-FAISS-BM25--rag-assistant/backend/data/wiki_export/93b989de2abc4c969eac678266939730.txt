Combretum quadrangulare, or commonly known as sakae naa, is a small tree of the family Combretaceae, up to 10 m high. The tree grows wildly or is planted in Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Thailand.

The tree is planted along the banks of rivers or arroyos for firing. It is found throughout Thailand especially in open, wet places. Therapeutic uses of this plant in the country are for anthelmintics (the parts used were seeds, roots and leaves) and curing venereal disease (the parts used are roots and wood). Studies of the chemical constituents of this plant have revealed that alcoholic and other extracts from the roots and seeds could kill earthworms. Extracts from seeds display antibacterial properties.
