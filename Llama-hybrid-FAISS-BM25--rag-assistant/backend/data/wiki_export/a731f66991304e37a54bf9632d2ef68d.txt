Transport

Road 
Federal Highway (Bundesstraße) B 107 between Coswig and Bad Düben runs right through the community. The district road K2038 leads to Möhlau. The Dessau-Ost interchange with Autobahn A9 (Munich - Berlin) is about 11 km away.

Railway 
The nearest  railway station is about 4 km away in Gräfenhainichen lying on the Deutsche Bahn line between Wittenberg and Bitterfeld. Oranienbaum railway station on the Dessau-Wörlitzer Eisenbahn line is served only in the summer.

Brown coal haulage from the Golpa-Nord strip mine to Vockerode on the stretch of the mining railway running past the community ceased after the power station was shut down. It is still used for special trips to Ferropolis (an industrial museum), so the old signal box has been converted into a halt.
