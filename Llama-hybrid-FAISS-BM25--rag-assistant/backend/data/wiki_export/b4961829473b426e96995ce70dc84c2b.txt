The Thai Institute of Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry (TIChE) () is a professional organization for chemical engineers. TIChE was established in 1996 to distinguish chemical engineers as a profession independent of chemists and mechanical engineers.

History

TIChE was established to force the chemical engineering professional certificate isolated from the industrial engineering. The conference in 1990 was the first effort to establish the organization by the cooperation of Department of Chemical Engineering and Department of Chemical Technology, Chulalongkorn University, and Department of Chemical Engineering, King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi. In the 4th conference at Khon Kaen University, 1994, TIChE was formally established and permitted by law on November 15, 1996. Now, TIChE composes 18 university members.

The Objectives of TIChE

 To promote and support the chemical engineering and chemical technology profession.
 To promote and support the educational standard of chemical engineering and chemical technology.
 To encourage cooperation and industrial development including research and knowledge.
 To disseminate knowledge and consulting in chemical engineering and chemical technology.
 To be an agent of chemical engineering and chemical technology profession to cooperate with other organizations.
