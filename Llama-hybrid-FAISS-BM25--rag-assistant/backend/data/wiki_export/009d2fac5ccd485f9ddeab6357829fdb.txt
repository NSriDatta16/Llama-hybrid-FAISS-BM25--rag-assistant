Herman (fl. c. 1050) was the son of Rainulf Trincanocte, count of Aversa (1045–1048), whom he succeeded. He was only an infant then and he was put under the regency of his father's cousin Richard. Within two years, he had disappeared from the scene and Richard was count. His fate is a mystery, though it is not hard to imagine that, as an obstacle to power, he was disposed of in the most efficient manner.
