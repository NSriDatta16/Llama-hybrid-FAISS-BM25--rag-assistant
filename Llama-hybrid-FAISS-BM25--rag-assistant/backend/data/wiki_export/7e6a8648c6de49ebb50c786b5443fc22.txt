Deokjong of Goryeo (9 June 1016 – 31 October 1034) (r. 1031–1034) was the 9th ruler of the Goryeo dynasty of Korea.  The son of Hyeonjong, he was confirmed as Crown Prince in 1022.  During his reign, the national histories begun under his father were completed, and the construction of the long Cheolli Jangseong wall began.

After ascending the throne in 1031, Deokjong requested that the Khitan return their Goryeo prisoners and pull back from the Yalu River. After this request was refused, he turned to fortifying the northern frontier.
