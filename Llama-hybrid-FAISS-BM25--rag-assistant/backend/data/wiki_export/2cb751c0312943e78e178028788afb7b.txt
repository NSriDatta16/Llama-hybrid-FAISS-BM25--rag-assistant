In 2009 he was one of a number of players who decided to leave Bangladeshi domestic cricket in order to participate in the unsanctioned Indian Cricket League as part of the squad for the new Dhaka Warriors side,
for which he was banned from playing in official cricket matches in Bangladesh for 10 years by the Bangladesh Cricket Board.

In October 2020, he was appointed as the chief selector of the Bangladesh women's cricket team.
