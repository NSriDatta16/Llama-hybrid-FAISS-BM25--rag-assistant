Mastic–Shirley is a station on the Long Island Rail Road's Montauk Branch in Shirley, New York. This station is reached via William Floyd Parkway. The station has two ticket machines.

History

Mastic–Shirley station was built as a replacement for the former Mastic station (originally Forge station) built in 1882 and located  east on Mastic Road. Service for the Mastic–Shirley train station began July 7, 1960. The now-unused station house at the original station was torn down a month later. When Center Moriches station was eliminated by the LIRR on March 16, 1998, Mastic–Shirley station was one of two stations recommended for use as a substitute by the patrons of the now-closed station. The other was Speonk station.

Station layout
The station has one four-car-long high-level platform on the south side of the single track. JJD interlocking (formerly MS), a remote-controlled siding where trains can pass each other, is located east of the station.
