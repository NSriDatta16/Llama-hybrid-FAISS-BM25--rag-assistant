History of Augusta Independent Schools
The first school located in Augusta Kentucky was a private school built in 1795 built by Robert Schoolfield. It was a log cabin located at 211 Riverside Drive. Later on, leaders in the community established The Bracken Academy in 1798. To grow the school, they were awarded a charter and a grant of land from the state in 1799. To accommodate the growing need for education, they constructed several classroom buildings, including one classroom on the southeast corner of Elizabeth and Third Streets. In 1822 Bracken Academy combined with Augusta College. In 1825 it was fully operational and became the first established Methodist college in Kentucky (and the third in the nation at that time). 
Augusta Independent School was founded in 1887. The current principle is Robin Kelsch and the current superintendent is Lisa McCane.
