Description

Overview
The five-story commemorative monument and an adjoining one-story building with the chapel was designed by local architect, Charles E. Thomas, who was hired by Julie and Spencer Penrose, the philanthropist and developer who built The Broadmoor resort and Cheyenne Mountain Zoo. The monument is made of Romanesque Revival architecture with buttresses, an ornately decorated iron and brass door, and narrow leaded windows. It is  tall. The shrine is partly named for the views of the rising and setting sun. Will Rogers, who died in 1935 in an airplane crash, is memorialized in images of his life displayed throughout the interior of the monument and in the name of the shrine. The shrine is also a memorial to the lives of Julie and Spencer Penrose, whose tombs are in the monuments lower level. The Pikes Peak Region's history is depicted in a  mural by Randall Davey, an artist from Santa Fe, New Mexico.

The Will Rogers Shrine of the Sun site is entered through a stone gateway. The grounds are encircled by a stone wall made from the same single block of pink granite quarried from Cheyenne Mountain used to make the tower. Within the stone walls, there are Jo Davidson's statue of Will Rogers, Chinese sculptures, and landscaping with plants native to the region. Avard Fairbanks made a bronze bust of Spencer Penrose.

The building is constructed of granite, steel, cement, iron and brass. Its roof was built of ceramic tile. There were no wood or nails in its construction. The interior has terrazzo floors, marble, and ironwork. Stairs lead to the upper floors.

It was completed in 1937 and dedicated on September 6, 1937. The total construction cost was about $250,000 ().

Monument
The sections of the monument are a one-story building with the chapel, the five-story tower, and a staircase connecting the two. Randall Davey painted murals on the first floor of the monument and the first two levels of the stairway depicting the area's historical people and events. The murals, restored in 1994 by Eric Bransby, illustrate scenes of Native Americans; Zebulon Pike's travels; Cripple Creek Mining; William Jackson Palmer, founder of Colorado Springs; and Spencer Penrose. The next three floors contain a photographic history of Will Rogers from his early childhood days in Oklahoma through his time on stage, screen and radio. The last mural is of Will and Wiley Post taken just prior to the fatal crash.

A set of Westminster chimes are played on a vibraharp every quarter-hour or every hour. The sounds of the chimes can be heard  away, due to what was a state-of-the-art amplification system when it was built.  Songs like Home on the Range and classical music has been broadcast from the tower over the years. At night, the shrine is illuminated by floodlights and the walkway is lighted. Visible below, Cheyenne Lake at The Broadmoor reflects the nearby lights.

Chapel
The chapel is below the first level. It contains European works of art from the 15th and 16th centuries, including a 16th-century Baroque painting of the Madonna. Furniture from the 16th century includes choir stalls, a Classical Baroque altar, and carved Monk benches. The chapel's crucifix is a German woodcarving. The remains of Spencer and Julie Penrose are interred in the chapel along with two friends, Spencer's social secretary, Horace Devereaux, and Harry Leonard. Eastern works of art include a standing bronze statue of Bodhisattva Guanyin wearing rosary beads and three Buddha statues.
