Additionally, the attached Chaifetz Pavilion includes a two-court basketball and volleyball practice facility that also serves as an 800-seat venue that is the home for the university's volleyball teams. The arena, known as "the Jewel of Midtown," includes a three-story athletic office.  Chaifetz Arena has been called by former VCU coach Shaka Smart as the toughest venue to play in the Atlantic 10 Conference.
