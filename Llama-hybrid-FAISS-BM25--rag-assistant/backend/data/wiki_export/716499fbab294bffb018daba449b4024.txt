Octavia was born to Ancharia and Octavius likely some time before 69 BC.

Marriage and issue 

Octavia the Elder was married to Sextus Appuleius (I). They had a son, who was also named Sextus Appuleius, he served as ordinary consul in 29 BC with his half-uncle, Augustus. It is postulated that they had a second son, Marcus Appuleius, the consul of 20 BC. Through Sextus Appuleius, the consul, she had a grandson named Sextus Appuleius, consul in AD 14, and a granddaughter Appuleia Varilla. Octavia the Elder's last known descendants were her great-grandson, also named Sextus Appuleius, through her grandson and Fabia Numantina.

Research 
Plutarch was only aware of one daughter of Gaius Octavius and confused Octavia the Elder with Octavia the Younger.

Octavia's existence as wife of Appuleius was first discovered due to a dedication from when her husband was proconsul of Asia.

Cultural depictions 
Octavia and her husband, as well as their two sons, may be depicted on the Ara Pacis.
