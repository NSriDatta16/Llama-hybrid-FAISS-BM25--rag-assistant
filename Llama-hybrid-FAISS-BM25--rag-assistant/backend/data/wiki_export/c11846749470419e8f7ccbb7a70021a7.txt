Arena Civica (), officially Arena Gianni Brera, is a multi-purpose stadium in Milan, Italy, which was opened on 18 August 1807. One of the city's main examples of neoclassical architecture, today it mainly hosts football and rugby union games, concerts and cultural events. The stadium can hold 18,000–30,000 spectators.

The Arena is the home pitch for Milan's third football team, Brera Calcio, as well as being the host venue for an annual athletics meeting – the Notturna di Milano. Until 2011 the Arena was the home ground of Amatori Rugby Milano, a rugby union club founded in 1927 that won 18 Italian Championships.

History 
The Arena Civica opened on 18 August 1807, and later it was used for football activities, mainly by Inter: initially only for the biggest matches and afterwards on a stable basis, from 1930 until 10 December 1958, when the Nerazzurri faced Lyon for the Fairs Cup. It was used on 15 May 1910 in the Italy national football team's first official match, a 6–2 victory over France.

During its history it has been used for many kinds of events, including the reconstruction of naval battles; William Frederick Cody ("Buffalo Bill") twice brought his "Wild West Show" here. Other artists who performed at the Arena include Chicago, Joe Cocker, Stewart Copeland, The Cure, Little Feat, Ben Harper, Lenny Kravitz, Lou Reed, The Manhattan Transfer, Robert Plant, Public Image Limited, Radiohead, Patti Smith, Ringo Starr, Rod Stewart, Sting and Andy Summers. The Arena is also the site of the Milan Jazzin' Festival.
In 2003, it was renamed "Arena Gianni Brera" in honor of the sportswriter and journalist Gianni Brera.
