Economy
The main economic activities are cattle raising for meat and farming, especially soybeans and corn.  Most of the inhabitants either have no work or are employed in subsistence farming.  In 2007 there were 15 commercial units and no banks.  The absence of investments in the town leaves the inhabitants without the chance of a job and many, mainly the young, leave the town to try to find a job that would allow them to survive.   There were no hospitals in 2007.  There were 100 automobiles in 2007, which was one automobile for every 34 inhabitants.

In Buritinópolis, there is no bank branch, no restaurant, and no hotel.  The two supermarkets are comparable to the little grocery stores in the slums of the large urban centers and the bars can only provide income for their owners.  The agricultural activities provide few jobs since the small rural landowners practice subsistence farming and the large landowners opt for extensive cattle raising, which requires few workers.

Urban erosion is a worry for all.  It has already destroyed a large part of the main avenue that runs parallel to BR-020, the highway that cuts the city in two.  With no money to build drains and pave the streets on both side of the highway, the city government is waiting for  help from the state government.
