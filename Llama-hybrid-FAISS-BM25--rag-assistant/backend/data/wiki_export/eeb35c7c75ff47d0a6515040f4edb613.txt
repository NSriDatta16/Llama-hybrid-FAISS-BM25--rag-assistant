Early life

In 1993, Burda collaborated with Helmut Markwort to develop the news magazine Focus, a rival to Der Spiegel.

In 1999, Burda renamed the holding company to Hubert Burda Media. Under his father the firm's revenues were split broadly equally between printing and publishing, but under Hubert the firm significantly expanded its digital and international operations, including joint ventures with Hachette, Microsoft and Rizzoli and international expansion into countries such as Singapore, Thailand, India, Russia.

Current operations
In 2018, Hubert Burda Media employed 12,369 staff and achieved revenues of €2.66 billion in its four divisions (Digital Brands National, Media Brands National, Media Brands International and Print).

Burda's German publishing arm generated over €650million, reaching approximately three-quarters the German population. The firm's international division recorded turnover of €413 million.

Career and memberships
As of April 2019, Forbes estimated Burda's net worth at US$4 billion. He is the third richest publisher in Germany, after Friede Springer and Elisabeth Mohn.
