This is a list of cities and towns in Europe that have (or once had) town tramway (e.g. urban tramway) systems as part of their public transport system. Cities with currently operating systems, and those systems themselves, are indicated in bold and blue background colored rows. The use of the diamond (â™¦) symbol indicates where there were (or are) two or more independent tram systems operating concurrently within a single metropolitan area.  Those tram systems that operated on other than standard gauge track (where known) are indicated in the 'Notes' column.
