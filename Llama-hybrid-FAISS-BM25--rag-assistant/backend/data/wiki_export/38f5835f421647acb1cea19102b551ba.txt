DIC Movie Toons (originally known as the Nickelodeon Sunday Movie Toons in the United States) were a series of animated made-for-TV movies produced by DIC Entertainment, which lasted for just one season (2002) on Nickelodeon in the United States. It started in 2002, beginning on October 6 and ending on December 29.

All films are nowadays a property of WildBrain, which holds the rights to most of DIC's library.

List of movies
Initially, 39 films were ordered from Nickelodeon to air, with later productions including adaptations of concepts such as Black Beauty and The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, but only 13 of them did so. With the exception of Groove Squad, which was a completely original story (it was about a group of crime-fighting cheerleaders), all of the made-for-TV films were either based on various DIC productions such as Inspector Gadget, Sabrina: The Animated Series, and Dennis the Menace, or adapted from stories from classic literature such as Treasure Island and 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. In order, the movies featured were:

 Inspector Gadget's Last Case (based on both the original 1983 Inspector Gadget series and Disney's 1999 live-action movie, but with character designs from Gadget & the Gadgetinis) (10/6/02)
