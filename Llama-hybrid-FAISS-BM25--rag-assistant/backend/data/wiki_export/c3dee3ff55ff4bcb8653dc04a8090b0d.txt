Vojnik (; ) is the largest settlement and the centre of the Municipality of Vojnik in eastern Slovenia. It lies on the Hudinja River, north of Celje. The area is part of the traditional region of Lower Styria. The municipality is now included in the Savinja Statistical Region.

Locals make their living from farming, but there are also many small businesses. Vojnik was first mentioned as a borough in 1306. There were many fires in the town, and the town even burned to the ground in 1839.

Name
Vojnik was first attested in written sources in 1165 as de Hoheneke (and as Hohnec in 1173, Hohenekke circa 1175, and Hohenek in 1199).  The medieval German forms of the name (literally, 'high hill') are the result of folk etymology. The name is derived from *Xvojьnikъ, from Slavic *xvoja 'fir, spruce'. Accentual evidence makes the name's derivation from *vojьnikъ 'soldier' unlikely. In the past, the standard German name of the town was Hochenegg.

Churches
The parish church in the settlement is dedicated to Saint Bartholomew () and belongs to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Celje. It is a Neo-Romanesque building dating to 1899. A second church in the settlement is dedicated to Saint Florian. It dates to the mid-15th century and has a Gothic sanctuary with a 17th-century nave.

The Višnja Vas 2 Mass Grave () is located north of the settlement, on the right side of the road from Celje to Slovenske Konjice,  south of the building at Vojnik no. 2 and  north of the house at Vojnik no. 5.
