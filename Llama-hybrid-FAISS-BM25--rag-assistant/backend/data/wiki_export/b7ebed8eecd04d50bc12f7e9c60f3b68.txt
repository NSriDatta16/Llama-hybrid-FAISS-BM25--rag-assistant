Canteen is an Australian national support organisation for young people (aged 12â€“25) living with cancer; including cancer patients, their brothers and sisters, and young people with parents or primary carers with cancer.

Canteen was created by young cancer patients in 1985 and its policies are guided by young people living with cancer. The organisation is also present in New Zealand.

On the last Friday of October, Canteen holds National Bandanna Day. Bandannas are sold to fundraise.
