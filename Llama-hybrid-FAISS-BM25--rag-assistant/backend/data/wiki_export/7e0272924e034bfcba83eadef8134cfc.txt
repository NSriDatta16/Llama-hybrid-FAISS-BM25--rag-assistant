Cooper Union controversy and investigation by New York state Attorney General
Bharucha was appointed as the twelfth president of The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art effective July 1, 2011. His tenure at Cooper Union was marked by a financial crisis and tuition protests. An investigation by the New York State attorney general's office ensued into the institution's decision to charge tuition for the first time in its history and other financial decisions made by the trustees.  This eventually led to the attorney general's office brokering a settlement of a lawsuit filed by a group of students, alumni and faculty.

The following day, Bharucha announced that he would be resigning to become a visiting scholar at Harvard University.
