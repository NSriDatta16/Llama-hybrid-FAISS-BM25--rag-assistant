Aghadrumsee () is a small village in south-eastern County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland.

Historically the town of Clones (now across the border in County Monaghan in the Republic of Ireland) has had a significant influence on this rural community due mainly to the railway which once ran through it. It is situated within Fermanagh and Omagh district.

Etymology
The earliest recorded spelling of Aghadrumsee from 1609 is Aghadromsillagh. Its modern Irish translation (Achadh Dhruim Saileach) is based on this earlier name.  This is derived from the Gaelic words:  meaning field;  meaning ridge, and  meaning sallow. This now gives it the meaning of field of the ridge of sallows. The see syllable in the current spelling of Aghadrumsee is a homophone of sidhe. This gives Aghadrumsee its folklore meaning of field of the fairy hillock.

Religion

Aghadrumsee comes under the Church of Ireland and Roman Catholic dioceses of Clogher. The Parish of Aghadrumsee straddles the border town of Clones (now along the border in County Monaghan in the Republic of Ireland). The community is served by a number of churches including St Mark's Church of Ireland and St Macartan's Roman Catholic church. There are also several evangelical gospel halls in the area.

The old school in Aghadrumsee has been converted to a two-storey building attached to the Orange Hall.  According to the 1826 Survey of Education, it cost £120 and was funded by the Kildare Place Society.  No figures for enrolment were given as it was not yet open.  The new school was built as a replacement in 1937.  It was then enlarged and renovated in 1973–74 to cater to children from Magheraveely and Roslea.  The school now caters for children from a wide rural area.  Other schools in the local area, which are now closed, included  Cornagague, Corranny, Rateen National School.Cornagague and Corranny schools closed upon their amalgamation into the newly built St Macartens school.
