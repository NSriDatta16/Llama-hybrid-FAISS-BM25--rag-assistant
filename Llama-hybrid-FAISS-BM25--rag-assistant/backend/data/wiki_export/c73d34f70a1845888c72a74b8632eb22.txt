In mathematics, the Macdonald identities are some infinite product identities associated to affine root systems, introduced by . They include as special cases the Jacobi triple product identity,  Watson's quintuple product identity, several identities found by , and a 10-fold product identity found by .

 and  pointed out that the Macdonald identities are the analogs of the Weyl denominator formula for affine Kacâ€“Moody algebras and superalgebras.
