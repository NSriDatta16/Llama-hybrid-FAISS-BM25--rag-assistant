Jwaji of Geumgwan Gaya (died 421) (r. 407–421) was the sixth ruler of Geumgwan Gaya, a Gaya state of ancient Korea.  He was the son of King Ipum and Queen Jeongsin.

The Samguk yusa reports that he appointed the relatives of a favoured concubine (yong nyeo, 傭女) to high office, and that this led to political trouble.  Furthermore, Silla took advantage of the kingdom's vulnerability and invaded.  After the courtier Pak Won-do (朴元道) remonstrated with him, the king went to a fortuneteller, who read him an I Ching passage which indicated that he should destroy the heart of the problem.  At that, he sent the concubine into exile and returned proper order to the court.
