Junction station usually refers to a railway station situated either on (in German this is called a Keilbahnhof) or close to a junction where lines to several destinations diverge. The usual minimum is three incoming lines. At a station with platforms running from left to right, the minimum to qualify as a junction station would usually be one line on the left and two on the right (or vice versa).

This is not to be confused with a station where there is one through line, but single track on one side while double track on the other. In this case, all trains passing through the station can reach only one destination as their next station.

Commonly, junction stations have multiple platform faces to enable trains for multiple destinations to stand at the station at the same time, but this is not necessary.
