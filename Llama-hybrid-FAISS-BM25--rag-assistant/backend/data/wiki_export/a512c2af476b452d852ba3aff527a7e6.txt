History

Foundation and vision 
The first President of India, Dr Rajendra Prasad laid the foundation stone of the college building on 14 September 1956. Construction was completed in 1962 and the college was inaugurated on 14 March 1963 by the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru.

Until 1956, there were only three technical institutes in India for mining and metallurgical engineering. To fill the void and aim to harness the ample mineral resources in the region, the institute was set up on 1 May 1956 as "Government College of Mining and Metallurgy". The first session of the college commenced on 1 July 1956, with 15 students each in mining and metallurgical engineering courses.

Early developments 
In 1958–59, with the commencement of additional courses in Civil, Mechanical, and Electrical engineering, the college came to be known as "Government College of Engineering and Technology". Later graduate courses in chemical engineering (1965), Architecture (1984), Electronics (1985), Information Technology and Computer Science & Technology (2000), and Biotechnology and Biomedical Engineering (2003) were started.

Recent history 
Following the long-standing demand for more Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) the then Minister of Human Resource Development, Murali Manoher Joshi decided to upgrade the  Regional Engineering Colleges (RECs) to NITs. In 2003 all RECs were upgraded to NITs and the central government took control of these Institutes. Ministry of Human Resource Development issued NIT status to three more colleges besides the RECs. This was done to provide one NIT in every new state carved out of its parent state whose NIT was lost due to the bifurcation. As a result, this institute (the then GCET) was declared a National Institute of Technology (NIT) by the Government of India on 1 December 2005. It was confirmed the status of Institute of National Importance with the passing of the National Institutes of Technology Act, 2007, in May 2007.
