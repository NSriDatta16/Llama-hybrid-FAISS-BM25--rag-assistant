Daechi-dong is an affluent neighborhood in Gangnam-gu, Seoul, South Korea. Daechi-dong is divided into three different “dongs” which are Daechi 1-dong, 2-dong, and 4-dong. Daechi-dong is predominantly considered the residential area of Gangnam. As a result, real estate in the area is highly competitive and expensive compared to other parts of Gangnam. The Yangjaecheon is a stream that runs through the heart of Daechi-dong.

Name and History 

The name Daechi-dong came from the Chinese form of Hanti Town which meant a town below a big hill. Daechi-dong had a lot of names. Just after the Joseon Dynasty, it was referred to as Unju-myeon, and was administered as a part of Gwangju-gun, Gyeonggi-do. Then on April 1, 1914, the name was changed to Daechi-li, and it was redistricted into Unju-myeon, Kwangju-gun. It finally changed into Daechi-dong and became a part of the city of Seoul when the city's administrative district was expanded on January 1, 1963, with law number 1172 after independence from the Japanese occupation. As of October 1, 1975, it was brought under the administration of Gangnam-gu which is where it remains today.

Education 

In Korea, Daechi-dong is seen as the Mecca of private education  due in part to the high concentrations of hagwons (private institute, for English and other subjects) in the area. The real estate prices in Daechi-dong are very high compared to that of other upscale neighborhoods in Gangnam.  It is also the place which sends the most students by percentage to Korea's so-called “SKY” universities: Seoul National University, Korea University, and Yonsei University. This began in the 1960s when hagwons began to open near the high-schools with the best academic reputations. Currently, there are over 950 of these hagwons in Daechi-dong.This educational infrastructure attracts many families to the area, and is one of the largest reasons for Daechi-dong's high real estate prices.
