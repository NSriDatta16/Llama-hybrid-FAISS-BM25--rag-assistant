South Africa has a number of  Traditional Regiments. These are mostly South African Army Reserve Force (formerly Citizen Force) regiments that were established either under previous colonial governments or by the Apartheid regime and which have continued to exist by accepting the authority of the government-of-the-day - be it colonial, union (i.e. pre-Apartheid), Apartheid, or fully democratic (i.e. post-Apartheid). 

Generally, the traditional regiments are those who were formed before the establishment of South Africa as a unified country, although there are a few which are much more recent. The traditional regiments have a number of elements which are different from the other units, such as certain peculiarities of dress. The most noticeable of these is the wearing of the Sam Browne belt and Sword by officers.
