History
Marianna High School was built in 1926.

In 1939, about 500 students walked out of their classes in protest after the school board failed to reappoint their principal, E.T. Denmark.  The students marched along city streets carrying placards and refused to return to class until their principal was reappointed.

Fire destroyed the school's industrial arts building in 1970.  No one was injured, and faulty wiring was blamed.

The school gained media attention in 1972 after 5 black students were expelled following a fight.  This led to a protest march on the state capital, and brought focus to racial tensions at the school.

In 1987, a student was stabbed to death during a fight with a classmate, and the following year a student was found in possession of a handgun and crack cocaine.  As a result, principals in all Jackson County high schools were provided with metal detectors.

Construction of a new Marianna High School began in 2001, and was completed in June 2005.  The following month, prior to opening to students, the new school—equipped with standby generators and designed to withstand a category 5 hurricane—sheltered evacuees fleeing Hurricane Dennis.  The new school building was , occupied , and cost $21 million.

In 2019 Marianna High School received a prank call from an unknown person claiming to be a student’s aunt and told the administration that the student had a “bong” in his backpack. Unable to understand the caller completely the administration thought the caller said “bomb” and had the whole school evacuated to the practice football field and took the student into custody and searched in the principals office only to find nothing in his backpack. They soon realized that it was a prank call and they let the student go and the incident was resolved. But even after the incident many students and teachers still refer this as the “Bong Threat” of Marianna High School.
