Harveys Creek (also known as Harvey Creek or Harvey's Creek) is a tributary of the Susquehanna River in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, in the United States. It is approximately  long and flows through Harveys Lake, Lake Township, Lehman Township, Jackson Township, and Plymouth Township. The creek's watershed has an area of . The creek has four named tributaries, which are known as Bear Hollow Creek, Paint Spring Run, Pikes Creek, and East Fork Harveys Creek. The watershed is designated as a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery above Pikes Creek and as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery below it. The creek's source is Harveys Lake, the largest natural lake in Pennsylvania.

Harveys Creek was used as a water supply as early as the beginning of the 1900s. A number of bridges have been constructed over the creek since the 1920s, and it has been dammed by the Bryant Pond Dam. It is possible to canoe on part of the creek. Rock formations consisting of sandstone and shale occur in the watershed.

Course

Harveys Creek begins in Harveys Lake in the community of Harveys Lake. The creek flows southwest and soon enters Lake Township. A short distance downstream, it picks up the tributary Bear Hollow Creek and turns south for several miles. The creek receives the tributary Paint Spring Run during this stretch. It eventually enters Lehman Township and turns southeast, crossing Pennsylvania Route 118. Slightly more than a mile (two kilometers) downstream, the creek turns south again. It eventually enters Jackson Township, where it crosses Pennsylvania Route 29 and picks up the tributary Pikes Creek. It then turns southeast and enters a valley, where it flows roughly parallel to Pennsylvania Route 29 for a number of miles. The creek enters Plymouth Township and soon afterwards turns abruptly southwest. Several miles downstream it enters the community of West Nanticoke. Here, it crosses U.S. Route 11 and reaches its confluence with the Susquehanna River.

Harveys Creek joins the Susquehanna River  upstream of its mouth.

Upstream of this point, the creek's elevation decreases at a rate of  per mile. Downstream of that point, its elevation decreases at a rate of  per mile. Harveys Creek is in the Wyoming Valley.

Much of Harveys Creek, in its lower reaches, is in a forested gorge.  The upper reaches of its watershed contain swamps and glacial lakes.  The cliffs of Tilbury Knob are also situated near the mouth of the creek. The creek's source is in Harveys Lake, which is the largest natural lake in Pennsylvania. It flows in a generally southward direction.

The topography of the watershed of Harveys Creek is described as "rough and hilly" in a 1921 book. The creek's channel is sinuous and flows through rock formations consisting of sandstone and shale. The creek was described as having "rushing waters" in a 2001 article in the Times Leader.

Watershed

The watershed of Harveys Creek has an area of . The creek is in the Lower North Branch Susquehanna drainage basin. Its watershed is in the northwestern part of Luzerne County. Upstream of the boundary between Lake Township and Lehman Township, the watershed has an area of . Upstream of the tributary Paint Spring Run, its watershed has an area of only . The creek's mouth is in the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Nanticoke. However, its source is in the quadrangle of Harveys Lake. Additionally, it flows through the quadrangles of Wilkes-Barre West and Kingston.

Harveys Creek is one of four major sources of flooding in Lake Township. The other three are Pikes Creek, Fades Creek, and Beaver Run. However, the floods of these creeks have not caused much damage since Lake Township is relatively undeveloped.

Historically, the Great Warrior Path of the Native Americans crossed Harveys Creek near its mouth. The path ran from Sunbury to Athens. In December 1775, a battle known as Plunkett's Battle was fought along the Susquehanna River very close to the creek. This battle was one of the major battles in the Yankee-Pennamite Wars.

The first schoolhouse in the lower part of Plymouth Township was built by Jameson Harvey near the mouth of Harveys Creek in 1834. The first mill in Lehman Township was built on the creek in 1837. In 1849, Johnathan Williams constructed a small mill on the creek. In 1869, a mining disaster occurred at the Avondale Mine just east of Harveys Creek. This event killed 108 people.

In the early 1900s, communities in the watershed of Harveys Creek included Alderson, West Nanticoke, Shawanese, Pikes Creek, Laketon, and Ceases Mills. Their populations in 1921 were 386, 300, 150, 76, 73, and 55, respectively. The main industries in the watershed at that time were agriculture and summer resorts. As early as the 1890s, the Nanticoke Water Company (which was formed in 1885) pumped water from the creek via gravity lines. In the early 1900s, Harveys Creek and its tributary Pikes Creek were used as a water supply by the Spring Brook Water Supply Company. The creeks supplied Nanticoke, West Nanticoke, Plymouth, and Glen Lyon.

In 2001, the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission banned alcoholic beverages within  of an 8.5-mile-stretch of Harveys Creek.

It is  long and carries State Route 1059/Fedor Road.

A bridge carrying Pennsylvania Route 29 over Harveys Creek in Plymouth Township was built in 2005. It is a two-span prestressed box beam bridge with a length of .

Biology
Upstream of the tributary Pikes Creek, Harveys Creek and its drainage basin are designated as a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Downstream of Pikes Creek, Harveys Creek and its drainage basin are designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Wild trout naturally reproduce in a stretch of the creek from Meeker Outlet Road/T810, downstream to its mouth. This stretch is  long.

Harveys Creek is inhabited by brown trout and native brook trout. It is stocked with fish.

Recreation
It is possible to canoe on  of Harveys Creek during a fast snowmelt or within two days of heavy rain. Its difficulty rating ranges between 2 and 4 and Edward Gertler describes the scenery along the creek as "good to very good" in his book Keystone Canoeing. Gertler also describes it as an "obscure torrent". The creek is considered to be suitable for advanced paddlers.

In the late 1980s, Harveys Creek was the most popular trout stream in Luzerne County. A 1991 book stated that the creek was the most extensively stocked and fished stream in the county.
