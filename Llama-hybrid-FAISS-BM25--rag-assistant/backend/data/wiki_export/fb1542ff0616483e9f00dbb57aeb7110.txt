The Environmental Design Research Association (EDRA) is an international, interdisciplinary organization founded in 1968 by design professionals, social scientists, students, educators, and facility managers. The purpose of EDRA is the advancement and dissemination of environmental design research, thereby improving understanding of the interrelationships between people, their built and natural surroundings, and helping to create environments responsive to human needs. Along with IAPS, MERA, PaPER, and EBRA, EDRA is one of the major international associations that focuses on the field of Environmental Design Research.

EDRA Conferences
EDRA holds an annual conference in different locations around the United States and around the world.  The first annual conference was held at Chapel Hill, North Carolina on June 8–10, 1969. Most conferences are held in the United States where the EDRA membership is concentrated, but over the last 40 years, four have been held in Canada (EDRA18/1976 in Vancouver, EDRA 18/1987 in Ottawa, EDRA 28/1993 in Montreal,  and EDRA 36/2005 in Vancouver), two have been held in Mexico (EDRA 22/1991 in Oaxtapec and EDRA 39/2008 in Veracruz), and one was held in Scotland (EDRA 32/2001 in Edinburgh).  EDRA celebrated its 40th anniversary in Kansas City, Missouri May 27–31, 2009.

Proceedings are published as part of each conference. These include full-length refereed and invited papers, symposia, workshops, and posters.
