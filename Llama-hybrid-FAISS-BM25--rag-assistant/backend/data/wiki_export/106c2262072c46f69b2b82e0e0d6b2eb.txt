The Politics of Guangdong follows a dual party-government system like the rest of China's provinces.  Guangdong is known for a surge of legislative activism in recent years, often called the Guangdong Phenomenon (Guangdong Xianxiang). The Guangdong Provincial People's Congress has enacted measures to increase democracy and transparency, and exert more control over the financial sector. In a well-publicized case in 2000, the Guangdong PPC also harshly criticized the Environmental Protection Bureau for allowing the construction of an electroplating park without a proper environmental impact investigation.
