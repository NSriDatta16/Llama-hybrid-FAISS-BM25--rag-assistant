History
The newspaper was founded in 1892 by Civil War veteran Sgt. John H. Murphy, Sr. Murphy merged his church publication, The Sunday School Helper, with two other church publications, The Ledger and The Afro-American, and the publication rose to prominence under the control of his tenth-born child, Carl J.
