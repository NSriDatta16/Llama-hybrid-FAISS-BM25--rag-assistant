Burnett was the Pirates Minor League Pitcher of the Year in 2001 and 2002, and 2002 Carolina League Pitcher of the Year. Baseball America named him the Carolina League's #1 prospect, and the Pirates #2 prospect. Baseball America after 2002: “Burnett was anointed as the Hillcats' ace--and he rarely disappointed. A left-hander with a 91 mph fastball and the league's best changeup, he did his part to help create a winning attitude on the field. Batters found it difficult to drive the ball in the air against him because he pitches down in the strike zone.”  His velocity improved in 2002, hitting .  His changeup is his best pitch, he also has a good slider. Knowles: “He needs to improve his breaking ball, he makes a lot of mistakes with it, but he throws enough strikes with his other pitches that he gets by with it.”

After sporting a 14–6 record with the Double-A Altoona Curve in 2003, Burnett advanced to the Triple-A Nashville Sounds for 2004.  He was recalled by the Pirates, and made his major league debut on May 30, 2004, against the Chicago Cubs.  Burnett pitched five solid innings, allowing only one run, but did not get a decision in the game. He finished the 2004 season with a 5–5 record and a 5.02 ERA.

Burnett missed the entire 2005 campaign with shoulder and elbow problems which eventually culminated in surgery. He spent the 2006 and 2007 seasons with the Triple-A Indianapolis Indians.

Burnett made his first major league appearance since August 21, 2004 on May 6, 2008, against the San Francisco Giants.  He allowed 2 runs in  of an inning.  Said Burnett of his return: "Honestly, it might have been more nerve-racking than my debut because my debut came so easy.  It was such an easy road coming up through the Minor Leagues. This one was so much more hard work, and harder to get here, and a lot more time."

Burnett had a 4.54 earned run average (ERA) in  innings pitched for the Pirates from 2004 to 2009.
