Jumeirah Hotels and Resorts is an Emirati state-owned luxury hotel chain. The Jumeirah Group was created in 1997 and became part of the Dubai Holding in 2004, which is Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum's personal corporate portfolio. Professional golfer Rory McIlroy was the company's global ambassador from 2007 to 2012. 

While the hotel chain operated facilities exclusively in Dubai in the early years, it has also been striving abroad for several years. In Europe, Jumeirah operated only two hotels in London, the Jumeirah Lowndes Hotel and the Jumeirah Carlton Tower. In February 2011, the third project opened in London on Park Lane, the Grosvenor House Suites by Jumeirah Living. The Group's first hotel in Germany opened in August 2011 in Frankfurt am Main as part of the major Palaisquartier development project.
