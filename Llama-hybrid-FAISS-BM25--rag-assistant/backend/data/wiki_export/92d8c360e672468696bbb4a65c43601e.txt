College career
When Baskett attended the University of New Mexico, he was its football team's leading receiver in 2004 and 2005, earning him the Reese Leroy Hill Memorial Award as the team's Offensive Player of the Year during those years. Additionally, he earned All-Mountain West Conference (MWC) honors as a senior, posting 67 receptions for 1,071 yards and nine touchdowns. A four-time all-academic MWC honoree, he graduated with a degree in General Management.

Professional career

Minnesota Vikings
Baskett originally signed with the Minnesota Vikings as a rookie undrafted free agent in 2006 and was traded to the Philadelphia Eagles in exchange for wide receiver Billy McMullen.

Philadelphia Eagles
Baskett had 112 receiving yards and one touchdown against the Dallas Cowboys and 177 receiving yards and one touchdown against the Atlanta Falcons. For his performance in these games, Baskett was awarded rookie of the week honors. He completed his rookie season with 22 receptions for 464 yards (21.1 yards per catch) and two touchdowns. He was named the 2007 special teams Most Valuable Player (MVP).
In 2008, he started another six games, playing in 16 to record 33 receptions, 440 yards, and three touchdowns for a 13.3-yard average.

He headed into the 2009 offseason as a restricted free agent. He was tendered a one-year contract on February 23. Because the Eagles had been carrying seven wide receivers, he was made expendable and released on September 15, 2009, to make room for Michael Vick on the 53-man roster.

Indianapolis Colts
On September 17, 2009, Baskett signed a one-year contract with the Indianapolis Colts after Anthony Gonzalez suffered a knee injury.  On February 7, 2010, during Super Bowl XLIV versus the New Orleans Saints, Baskett failed to recover an onside kick (that hit him in the hands) at the start of the second half, which led to a Saints touchdown. New Orleans won the game, 31–17. The next day, February 8, 2010, Baskett was released by the Colts.

Philadelphia Eagles (second stint)
On March 12, 2010, Baskett signed a one-year contract with the Philadelphia Eagles for $800,000. He was released on September 21, 2010.

Minnesota Vikings (second stint)
On September 22, 2010, Baskett re-signed with the Minnesota Vikings. He played in eight games in 2010, mostly on special teams, with one reception. On March 3, 2011, he was not extended a tender by the Vikings, making him an unrestricted free agent, but effectively ending his NFL career.
