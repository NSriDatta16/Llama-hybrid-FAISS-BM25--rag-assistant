Rahman K. Johnson (born May 26, 1976, in Orange Park, Florida) is a local television & radio personality and politician; he was elected to the Jacksonville city council in May 2023.

Politics
With his election to the Duval County Soil and Water Conservation District in 1999, Johnson became the youngest elected official in Florida at the time. There was some controversy surrounding an unapproved cellular phone, which was billed through the city. After much debate, it was eventually settled with Johnson agreeing to pay the $800 bill. In August 2000 Johnson was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention.  In January 2001 Ebony magazine named Johnson one of "30 Young [Black] Leaders under 30" nationally.  In 2002 Johnson campaigned first for the Jacksonville City Council, then for state representative, but was defeated in the September 2002 Democratic primary.

In 2018 Johnson was serving on a Jacksonville task force on the city's civil rights history.

Johnson won election to the Jacksonville City Council in District 14 in May of 2023.
