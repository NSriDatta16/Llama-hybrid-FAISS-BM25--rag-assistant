Top Dance/Electronic Albums, Dance/Electronic Albums (formerly Top Electronic Albums) is a music chart published weekly by Billboard magazine which ranks the top-selling electronic music albums in the United States based on sales compiled by Nielsen SoundScan. The chart debuted on the issue dated June 30, 2001 under the title Top Electronic Albums, with the first number-one title being the original soundtrack to the film Lara Croft: Tomb Raider. It originally began as a fifteen-position chart and has since expanded to twenty-five positions.

Top Electronic Albums features full-length albums by artists who are associated with electronic music genres (house, techno, IDM, trance, etc.) as well as pop-oriented dance music and electronic-leaning hip hop. Also eligible for this chart are remix albums by otherwise non-electronic-based artists and DJ-mixed compilation albums and film soundtracks which feature a majority of electronic or dance music.

In 2019, Billboard added a companion chart, Dance/Electronic Album Sales, which tracks the top 15 albums based solely on physical sales, but with an emphasis on core dance/electronic artists.

The Fame by Lady Gaga holds the record for the most weeks at number one (175 weeks) as well as the most weeks on the chart (502 weeks). The current number-one album on the chart is Something to Give Each Other by Troye Sivan.
