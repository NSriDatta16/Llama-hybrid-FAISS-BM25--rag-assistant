 Newspapers no longer in print 

The earliest newspaper in Oregon was the Oregon Spectator, published in Oregon City from 1846, by a press association headed by George Abernethy. This was joined in November 1850 by the Milwaukie Western Star and two partisan papers – the Whig Oregonian, published in Portland beginning on December 4, 1850, and the Democratic Statesman, launched in Oregon City in March 1851. The latter paper would subsequently move to Salem, and it continues today as the Statesman-Journal''.
