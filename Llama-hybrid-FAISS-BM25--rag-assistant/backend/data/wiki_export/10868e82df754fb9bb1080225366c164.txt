More Places Forever is the third studio album by experimental singer-songwriter David Thomas, released in May 1985 by Rough Trade Records. In 1997, the album was remastered by Paul Hamann and David Thomas for its inclusion in the Monster anthology box set.

Reception
Spin said, "Thomas bends his fluid, offkilter voice into an instrument, singing duets with oboe, bassoon, and tuba and spacing off into light-hearted little monologues about love and the weather and whether one can bail out the ocean with a bucket and a notion. Though it's easy to dismiss as nursery blatherings, there are actually many subtle, witty references to discover and laugh at."
