Anahat (Unhurt) is a 2003 Marathi film directed by Amol Palekar and starring Anant Nag, Sonali Bendre and Deepti Naval. Anahat won the Best Artistic Direction award at the World Film Festival of Bangkok, 2003.

Plot
Anahat is set in the 10th century AD in Shravasti, the capital of the Kingdom of Malla. It revolves around two individuals â€” the king of Malla (Anant Nag), who is unable to father an heir, and the Queen, Sheelavati (Sonali Bendre), who is forced to choose a potent mate for one night. But, while the queen is ordered to merely produce an heir through the prevalent custom of Niyoga, she enjoys the sexual act without hurting her husband and comes to realise what her life was missing (in terms of sexual fulfillment).

Reception 
Pankaj Upadhyaya of Rediff wrote that "In the final reckoning, it's a simple story simply told. The camera works efficiently. The actors, for the most part, have just been allowed to be themselves"
