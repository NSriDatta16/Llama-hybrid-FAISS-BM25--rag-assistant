History

Foundation 
In January 2000, some teams of CIMEBA (Circuito Mexicano de Básquetbol), the national basketball league in Mexico at the time, exited the league, citing CIMEBA's financial difficulties, and decided to form a new league. On March 11, 2000 the league was founded in the city of Durango with 11 teams participating. These were the founding teams, with the respective city and state:

Algodoneros de la Comarca (Torreón, Coahuila)
Correcaminos Matamoros de la UAT (Matamoros, Tamaulipas)
Correcaminos Reynosa de la UAT (Reynosa, Tamaulipas)
Correcaminos Tampico de la UAT (Tampico, Tamaulipas)
Correcaminos Victoria de la UAT (Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas)
Dorados de Chiuhuahua	(Chihuahua, Chihuahua)
Garzas de Plata de la UAEH (Pachuca, Hidalgo)
Indios de la UACJ (Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua)
La Ola Roja del Distrito Federal (Mexico City, Distrito Federal)
Osos de Saltillo (Saltillo, Coahuila)
Vaqueros de Agua Prieta (Agua Prieta, Sonora)

The first president was Modesto Robledo. The LNBP set out to support and develop professional basketball in Mexico. The first edition of the league started on August 7, 2000 and finished in December, with the regular season finishing on November 11 and the playoffs starting on November 14. The first game was played in Torreón between Algodoneros de Torreón and Dorados de Chihuahua at the Auditorio Municipal: Dorados won, 80–78. The league coexisted in its first seasons with CIMEBA.

Format

Regular season 
The regular season is played in round-robin format in which the 8 best-placed teams qualify to the postseason. For every game won 2 points are added and for every game lost one point is added. For example: If team one played 10 games and won 7, losing the remaining 3, it would have 17 points; 14 points for the 7 games won and 3 points for the games lost.

Playoffs 
The eight top-seeded teams play each other. The 1st-placed team plays the 8th-place team while the 2nd plays the 7th and the 3rd plays the 6th and so on. The semi-finals are played like the quarterfinals while the Serie Final is played by the two teams remaining with the best-placed team having home field advantage.
