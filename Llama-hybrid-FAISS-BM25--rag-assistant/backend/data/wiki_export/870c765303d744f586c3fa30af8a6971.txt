Jalamanta is Brant Bjork's debut solo album after leaving Kyuss and joining Fu Manchu. Originally released in 1999 on the defunct Man's Ruin Records label, Jalamanta was re-released on Bjork's own label, Duna Records, in 2003, 2006 and 2009. In 2019, Bjork's current label Heavy Psych Sounds 'remixed and remastered' the album with new artwork.

Notes
 The original Man's Ruin album lists track #5 as "Oasis Layback", but was changed on the Duna release to "Sun Brother".
 The 2019 reissue of Jalamanta features a track listing including "Take Me Away" and "Bones Lazy", the latter being the instrumental intro of "Low Desert Punk" from the original release.
