Campus
Fairvale was for its unusual Binishell, but it was demolished in 2021 due to the high upkeep needed. The first attempt at building the Binishell in 1974 resulted in disaster when the foundations failed the Binishell and it collapsed in the centre. There were no injuries.

The Canley Vale Tutorial Centre, which serves students who have had difficulty completing their education in a mainstream school, is an annex to the school; however, it is not on the same site, but is near the close by Canley Vale Public School.

Extracurricular activities
Student activities and groups include The Duke of Edinburgh's Award, LEOs Club, Personal Development/Health/Physical Education, Rotary, String Ensemble, Vocal group, Junior and Senior Dance ensembles, Various Rock Bands and Student Representative Council.
