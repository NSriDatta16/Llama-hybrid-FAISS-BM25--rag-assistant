The Via Traiana was an ancient Roman road. It was built by the emperor Trajan as an extension of the Via Appia from Beneventum, reaching Brundisium (Brindisi) by a shorter route (i.e. via Canusium, Butuntum and Barium rather than via Tarentum). This was commemorated by an arch at Beneventum.

Background
Via Traiana was constructed in 109 AD by Emperor Trajan at his own expense. It was built during a period of relative freedom from military campaigns. Thus the Via Appia, from which Via Traiana was constructed as an extension, lost its original importance as a military highroad that connected Venosa (Venusia) and Taranto (Tarentum). Furthermore, the maintenance of direct military communications between Venusia, the military colony of 291 BC, and Rome, was no longer needed except in times of civil war, and the Via Appia simply became a means of reaching Brindisi.

Route
Strabo indicates correctly that traveling to Beneventum from Brundisium via the route of the later Via Traiana was a good day shorter than the old Republican road, Via Appia. Although the actual measurement shows Via Appia to be  and Via Traiana  from Brundisium to Beneventum, the difference lies in their topography. There are a number of severe hills and difficult terrain along Via Appia until it reaches Venusia which is about  away from Beneventum. In contrast, although Via Traiana does encounter equally demanding passages as well in the first  from Beneventum, there is not another serious hill all the way to Brundisium.

Roman bridges 

There are the remains of several Roman bridges along the road, including the Ponte dei Ladroni, Ponte delle Chianche, Ponte Pietra, Ponte Rotto (across Carapelle river), Ponte Rotto (across Cervaro river), Ponte sul Ofanto and Ponte Valentino.
