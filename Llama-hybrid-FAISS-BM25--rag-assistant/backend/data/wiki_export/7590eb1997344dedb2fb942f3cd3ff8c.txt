Expansion/Realignment

Detroit Compuware Ambassadors

On December 11, 1989, the Detroit Compuware Ambassadors were approved to join the league for the 1990–91 season as an expansion team. The club was owned by former Windsor Compuware Spitfires owner Peter Karmanos. The club was the first American based team in the OHL, and would play in the city of Detroit. The Compuware Ambassadors home was Cobo Arena, which was previously the home of the Detroit Pistons of the NBA from 1960 to 1978, and the Michigan Stags, who played in the World Hockey Association during the 1974-75 season.

The new club would join the Emms Division.

Realignment
As the expansion Detroit Compuware Ambassadors joined the Emms Division, the league also moved the Hamilton Dukes to the Emms Division. The Sudbury Wolves and North Bay Centennials would realign to the Leyden Division, as each division would have eight teams.
