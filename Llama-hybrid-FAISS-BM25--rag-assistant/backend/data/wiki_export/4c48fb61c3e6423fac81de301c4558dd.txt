It is well-known for the valuable manuscripts in its library.

Foundation and development
The seminary was founded on 19 May 1919 by Maharaja Mohammad Ali Mohammad Khan of Mahmudabad in memory of his younger brother Sahibzada Mohammad Ali Ahmad Khan Sahib. The Waqf-e-Madrasa-e-Ahmadiya of Mahmudabad was created by the Maharaja of Mahmudabad in 1919 by way of a registered Waqfnama. The Madrastul Waizeen was founded by the aforementioned Waqf in 1919.

Shams-ul-Ulema Ayatullah Syed Najmul Hasan was involved in madrasa since the days of its founding.

First Board of Trustees
The first Board of Trustees of the Waqf and therefore the Madrasa was as follows:
 Chairman: Maharaja Sir Mohammad Ali Mohammad Khan, K.C.S.I., K.C.I.E., of Mahmudabad

The late Hujjatul Islam Maulana Mazahir Hussain a renowned 'Alim and scholar was a trustee of the Madrasa as the Imam-e-Jum'a of Mahmudabad, Sitapur District, India.

Educational Program
Madrasatul Waizeen is considered a higher Shia religious education, where the students learn high levels of Shia studies, specially fiqh and usul al-fiqh, but also take some courses in preaching. The student of this seminary should pass a 3-year program of studying after which they should go for a journey of preaching for people in India or another country for two years, after which they would get the title of "wa'iz" (preacher).

Learning foreign languages such as Arabic, English, Persian, etc., are obligatory for the students of Madrasatul Waizeen. The students also take some courses about other religions and denominations so they would become able to engage in interfaith dialogue and preaching for people of other faiths.

The Madrasa has an annual event on the last week of every December, when everyone who is in any way related to this seminary participates in a 3-day conference and reports about what they do around the world, and they are also informed about the activities of the seminary during the last year. The place of the conference is different time to time.

The collections of the library of Madrasatul Waizeen include more than 20,000 books in print, and at least 1500 manuscripts. DR. Mohd. Taqi Ali Abidi, Asstt. Professor, Oriental Studies in Arabic & Persian, University of Lucknow compiled a Catalogue of Persian, Urdu & Arabic Manuscripts in Library of Madrasatul Waizeen in 1989-1990.
