Horst Stöcker (born 1952 in Frankfurt, West Germany) is a German theoretical physicist and Judah M. Eisenberg Professor Laureatus at the Goethe University Frankfurt.

Biography
After Abitur 1971, Stöcker studied physics, chemistry, mathematics and philosophy at the Goethe University Frankfurt, where he got his Dr. phil.nat. in 1979 under Walter Greiner. Title of the dissertation was Shock waves in nuclear matter – proof by circumstantial evidence.

He went on to GSI and – as a DAAD – postdoctoral fellow – to LBL, UC Berkeley.

Stöcker joined the faculty of physics and astronomy at Michigan State University and the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory, NSCL, in 1982.

1985 Stöcker moved on to a professorship for Theoretical Physics and Astrophysics at Goethe University Frankfurt, where Stöcker holds the Judah M. Eisenberg endowed chair since 2004.

From 2000 to 2003, Stöcker was twice elected vice president at Goethe University, for science, mathematics, computer science, IT and high performance computing, HPC, for the medical school and for the , the hospital of the Goethe University. He was re-elected ViP for a third time 2006–2007.

Stöcker is senior fellow, and, with Walter Greiner and Wolf Singer, founding director and chair of the executive board at the international interdisciplinary Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies (FIAS) – a public-private scientific foundation for theoretical research in fundamental science, natural science and computational life science, of Goethe University.

Horst Stöcker was the scientific chairman and CEO (director general) at the Darmstadt GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research, 2007–2015.

2008 Stöcker was elected vice-president of  for the Research Area "Struktur der Materie", 2008, and was reelected 2010–2012.
