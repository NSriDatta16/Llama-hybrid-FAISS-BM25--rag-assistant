This is an incomplete list of ghost towns in Pennsylvania.

Many of the ghost towns in Pennsylvania are located in Western Pennsylvania, particularly in the Appalachian and Allegheny regions of the Rust Belt. During the late 19th century and early 20th century, the mountainous parts of Pennsylvania were home to a booming coal industry. Many of these towns also housed coking facilities for the coal mined nearby, many of which still have the remains of the abandoned coke ovens.
