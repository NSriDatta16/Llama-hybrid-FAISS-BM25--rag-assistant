Leira is a small village in the municipality of Volda, in Møre og Romsdal county, Norway. It lies between the villages of Bjørke and Viddal, at the end of Hjørundfjorden. The village is located in the Sunnmørsalpene mountains, about  from the mountains Skårasalen (to the northwest), Jakta (to the northeast), Kvitegga (to the southeast), and Hornindalsrokken (to the south).

There are about 15–20 residents in Leira, with most residents farming their land. Leira is fairly isolated, with only one road leading to it. The road goes from Bjørke, through a  long tunnel through the mountain, Kamben, before reaching Leira. The road continues along the fjord to Viddal where the road ends. The closest urban area is the village of Volda, about  to the northwest of Leira.

Prior to 2020, the village and surrounding area was part of the neighbouring municipality of Ørsta.
