František Komňacký (born 15 November 1951) is a Czech football manager and former player.

Career
As a player, Komňacký played for regional clubs from South Moravia, his native region. In 1970, he went to Russia to study pedagogy and played four years until his graduation for Neftyanik Volgograd. After his return he played again for regional teams but in 1978 also began his managerial career, he then led the youth team of Jiskra Kyjov.

His first work as a head manager was at FK Drnovice in 1986–1988, he then coached Hanácká Slavia Kroměříž and Tatran Poštorná.

In 1997, he began work at 1. FC Synot and advanced with the team to the Gambrinus liga in 2000. He then led FK Zlín and MŠK Žilina. In the 2002–03 season Komňacký led Matador Púchov and won the Slovak Cup with them. For the next season he returned to the Czech Republic to work at Silesian club Baník Ostrava.

Baník led the league almost the whole 2003–04 season and won the Gambrinus liga for the first time in the history of the independent Czech Republic. Six years later Komňacký remembered that season: "I spent there a wonderful season, which I will not forget. I have that club and region in my heart."

Afterwards Komňacký went back to Slovakia and won both the Slovak Cup and the Corgoň Liga with MFK Ružomberok in the 2005–06 season. In October 2007 he started coaching FK Jablonec. In the 2009–10 season, Jablonec finished second in the Gambrinus liga for the first time in its history.
