In Microsoft operating systems, when using basic disk partitioned with GUID Partition Table (GPT) layout, a basic data partition (BDP) is any partition identified with Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) of .

According to Microsoft, the basic data partition is the equivalent to master boot record (MBR) partition types  (FAT16B),  (NTFS or exFAT), and  (FAT32). In practice, it is equivalent to  (FAT12),  (FAT16),  (FAT32 with logical block addressing), and  (FAT16 with logical block addressing) types as well.

A basic data partition can be formatted with any file system, although most commonly BDPs are formatted with the NTFS, exFAT, or FAT32 file systems.  To programmatically determine which file system a BDP contains, Microsoft specifies that one should inspect the BIOS Parameter Block that is contained in the BDP's Volume Boot Record.

When a Microsoft operating system converts a GPT-partitioned basic disk to a dynamic disk, all BDPs are combined and converted to a single Logical Disk Manager data partition identified with GUID . This is analogous to the conversion from partition types , , , , , , and  to partition type  on MBR partitioned disks.

Linux used the same partition type GUID for basic data partition as Windows prior to introduction of a Linux specific Data Partition GUID .
