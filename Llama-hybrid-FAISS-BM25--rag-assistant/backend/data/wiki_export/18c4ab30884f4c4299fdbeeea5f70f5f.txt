A station at Stepps (originally known as Stepps Road) was opened on this line sometime around 1831/2 (when the line was extended to Coatbridge), which was then closed by the British Railways on 5 November 1962.

Electrification was established in 2014 with services from Springburn being extended to Cumbernauld.
