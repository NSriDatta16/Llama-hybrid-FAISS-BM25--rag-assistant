The Université d'Évry Val-d'Essonne (Université d'Évry Val-d'Essonne or UEVE) is a French public university located in Évry-Courcouronnes, Île-de-France, and is one of the founding members of Paris-Saclay University.

The UEVE is expected to merge with the Paris-Saclay University in 2025.

This university founded in 1991 (by Decree), is located in a “ville nouvelle” which is dynamic and constantly evolving. The city of Évry-Courcouronnes is home to many firms (Accor, Carrefour etc.), the largest mall in Île-de-France and a national theatre.

Just 45 minutes away from Paris by RER, Évry is near the countryside. The Forest of Fontainebleau is only 21 miles (35 kilometres) away.

There are more than 160 curricula from two-year undergraduate degrees to the doctoral level, over half of which are professionally oriented. The university offers courses in Science, Technology, Law, Economics, Management and Social Sciences.

Today, the university counts more than 10,000 students (data july 2023) in both initial and ongoing training and the university has built a reputation as a center of excellence.

Thanks to 19 laboratories and 9 doctoral schools, the university is also a significant research centre developing major projects, in particular, those concerning Biology in conjunction with the French National Sequencing Center (Genoscope).

The university is a member of UniverSud Paris, Cap Digital, Systematic Paris-Region, ASTech, Medicen, and Finance Innovation and an associate member of the University of Paris-Saclay.

Academics

Unité de Formation et de Recherche (UFR) 
The Savary Law of 1984 restructured academic departments in French universities. Each department was made into a UFR, "Unité de formation et de recherche" or Research and Formation Unit that offers both undergraduate and graduate programs. Each UFR of the university is governed by a director elected from the department and heads over a council of elected professors who control its curriculum.
