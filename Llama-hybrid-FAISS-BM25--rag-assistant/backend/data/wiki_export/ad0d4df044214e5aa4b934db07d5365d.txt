History 
Nieuwerkerk was created in the 12th century. It was a split-off from Ouwerkerk. The fifteenth-century Protestant church, originally dedicated to John (evangelist), has an 6 sided tower. It was rebuilt in 1975 on the foundations of the original tower, which was blown up in 1945 by the Germans.

During the North Sea flood of 1953, approximately 265 of the 1,800 residents drowned or went missing.
