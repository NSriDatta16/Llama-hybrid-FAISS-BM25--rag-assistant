The 'Original' Bad Co. Anthology (also The 'Original' Bad Company Anthology) is a compilation album released by Bad Company in 1999 on Elektra Records. In addition to the band's classic hits, it also features four new songs ― the first since 1982 to feature original lead singer Paul Rodgers ― three B-sides and three previously unreleased outtakes. Technical information was retrieved from the 1999 Edition released by Elektra Records. Most of the songs on the album were previously released on Swan Song Records. The tracks "Tracking Down a Runaway", "Ain't It Good", "Hammer of Love" and "Hey, Hey" were new songs recorded especially for this release. The compilation notably omits the tracks "Young Blood", "Gone, Gone, Gone" and "Electricland", all of which were fairly big hits with Rodgers.
