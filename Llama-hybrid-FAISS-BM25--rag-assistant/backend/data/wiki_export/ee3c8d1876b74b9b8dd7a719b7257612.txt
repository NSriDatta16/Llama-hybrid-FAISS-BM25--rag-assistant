Kimpurusha Kingdom refers to the territory of a tribe called Kimpurushas who were one among the exotic tribes of ancient India. These exotic tribes lived in inaccessible regions like the Himalaya mountains.

Kimpurushas were described to be lion-headed beings. Splitting the word to Kimpurusha = Kim (Is it ? ) + Purusha (Man) (literally translated "Is it human ?"), analogous to the word Kin + Nara (Man), shows that Kinnaras and Kimpurushas were related or probably the same tribe. The lion head may be an exaggeration of their heavily bearded head. In some Puranas they were mentioned as horse-headed. They could be a tribe of horse-warriors like the Kambojas. But their lion-headed reference in the sources and them staying in the mountains suggest that they could be Kirata. Kirat-or Kirati- means people with lion nature. It is derived from two words Kira-Lion and Ti- people and it also means people from the mountain.

Another tribe viz the Valikhilyas (who follow the motion of the sun) were linked with the sage Kratu.
