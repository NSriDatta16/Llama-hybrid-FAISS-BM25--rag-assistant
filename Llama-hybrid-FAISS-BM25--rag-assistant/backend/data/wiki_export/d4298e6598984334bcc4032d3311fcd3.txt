The Sail @ Marina Bay is a waterfront lifestyle condominium located in the Marina Bay area in Singapore. It was completed in 2008. The first tenants have moved into Central Park Tower in July 2008. Residents moved into Marina Bay Tower a few weeks later. The structure of The Sail is  with 70 storeys and is one of Singapore's tallest condominia/apartment buildings. This development offers panoramic city view of Marina Bay and the sea. It is close to some of Singapore's famous landmarks such as Suntec City, Marina Bay Sands, Esplanade, Telok Ayer Market and the Singapore River. The Downtown MRT station is built a few meters to the West of the building. The building was erected on reclaimed land, and the Central Linear Park is built on the South Side next to the building.

History 
Before the site was sold to developers, City Developments Limited and AIG Global Real Estate, the  land parcel was sold as a "white site", which means the developer is free to use the site for commercial and/or residential use, by the URA. After the sale, the developer indicated their intention to use it predominantly for residential use with the first level or two for shop units. Their plan was approved by the government. Once completed, it included the first residential development in the New Downtown and is also the tallest predominantly residential development in the city.

The 99-year leasehold site was launched for public tender on 14 March 2002.

The original design for the building was 69 storeys for Marina Bay Tower, and 58 storeys for Central Park Tower. After the design was finalised by the NBBJ, the number of storeys was revised upwards to 70 storeys for Marina Bay Tower, and 63 storeys for Central Park Tower.

Design 
The condominium was designed by Peter Pran and Timothy Johnson with leading design firm NBBJ.
