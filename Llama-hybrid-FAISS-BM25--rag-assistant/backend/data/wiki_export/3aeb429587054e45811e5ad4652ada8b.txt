The Scottish National League Division One (known as Tennent's National League Division 1 for sponsorship reasons) is the second tier of the Scottish League Championship for amateur rugby union clubs in Scotland.

The division was established in its current format in 2014, with the creation of three national leagues below the Premiership.

For the 2023–24 season, the division was reduced from 12 to 10 teams.

Promotion and Relegation
The winners are promoted to the Scottish Premiership, with the runners-up entering a play-off at a neutral venue against the 9th-placed team in the Premiership. The bottom two teams are relegated to Scottish National League Division Two.
