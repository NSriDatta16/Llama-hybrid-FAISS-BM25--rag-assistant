History
The origins of Campinorte go back to 1918.  It was called Campinas.  In 1935 the first school was built in the region.  Next a settler donated land to build the first chapel to pay homage to Saint Sebastian, patron saint of the town.  When the government began to build the new highway nearby, in 1948, the settlers moved their primitive houses to the edge of the route.  Campinas died and a new town, Campinorte, came to life.  At first it was a district of Uruaçu, but in 1953 it became a separate municipality.
