G. Scott MacLeod (born February 11, 1965) is a Canadian multimedia artist, musician and film director living in Montreal, Quebec.

Biography
G. Scott MacLeod was born in Red Deer, Alberta, Canada, in 1965. His family moved from Cape Breton N.S. to Montreal in 1969, where he was educated in both French and English. MacLeod received his Diploma of Collegial Studies in Fine Arts at John Abbott College in 1984, a BFA with a specialization in printmaking at Concordia University in 2003 and his Masters in Art Education at Concordia University in 2013. He is a fellow at The Helene Wurlitzer Foundation of New Mexico and a co-founder of the NDG Arts Week.

A critically acclaimed painter and photographer, MacLeod's work has reflected social, political and historical themes with an aim to promote education and accessibility to art and culture. His paintings and photographs are in many museums, as well as corporate and private collections. His drawings of prominent buildings in Montreal's Griffintown district were exhibited at the Centre d'Histoire de Montreal between September 2015 to August 2016. MacLeod made his first film, After the War with Hannelore - A Berliner War Child’s Testimony from 1945 to 1989, in 2009. The 22-minute documentary had several high-profile screenings, including at Les rendez-vous du cinéma québécois and Berlin’s Arnsenal 2 Institut für Film und Videokunst. He has since completed three films of The Water of Life animated film series, a four-part collaboration on Canadian history with Irish storyteller Mike Burns. MacLeod is also a singer-songwriter and recording artist. Since 1990, he has released three full-length LPs, three EPs and several singles. He also composed and performed the nine-song soundtrack for his first film.
