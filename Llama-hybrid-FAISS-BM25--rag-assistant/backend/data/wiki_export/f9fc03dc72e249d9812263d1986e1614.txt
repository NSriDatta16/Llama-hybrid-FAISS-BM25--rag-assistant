Bilbobus is the name for metropolitan bus services in Bilbao.

The service is owned by the city council of Bilbao. The buses can be distinguished by their red colour and large white lettering, and there are 28 major lines serving the city, with eight smaller lines connecting the town centre with neighborhoods with narrow streets where normal buses can't drive. Plus eight night lines, called Gautxori.

Bilbobus has recently won a European Union prize for service excellence. It is part of a wider transport network operated by the Basque government, recent additions to which include the Metro Bilbao underground and the tram line. They link the Renfe, Euskotren Trena and FEVE train services and are heavily integrated by means of the Barik card to provide ease of movement in the city.

The company's branding takes the Basque language name for the city, Bilbo.

Ridership 

After the inauguration of Metro Bilbao in 1995, the number of passengers transported by Bilbobus fell from 32 million to around 29 million. The underground's extension to the neighborhood of Santutxu in 1997, accelerated the decline in ridership, and it fell below 23 million in 1999. Some lines were suppressed, and the number of bus units used was lowered.

A reorganization of lines, and an improvement of the service have led to an increase of the ridership. The number of passengers has risen around 3 to 4 per cent yearly, and is expected to reach more than 28 million in 2008, its highest level in ten years.

Busiest lines in 2007 
 Peñascal - Mina Del Morro: 2,008,969 passengers
 La Peña - Jesusen Bihotza: 1,959,000 passengers
 Otxarkoaga - Plaza Biribila: 1,789,088 passengers
 Txurdinaga - Miribilla: 1,681,512 passengers
 San Ignazio - Txurdinaga: 1,673,612 passengers

Tickets

Passengers are typically recommended to use a Creditrans ticket of the Barik card. The card is validated each time you board the bus. The Barik card is also valid on trains, Metro Bilbao and BizkaiBus bus services, which extend wider out of the city centre into all of Biscay.

Tickets are also available on board at a flat rate of 1.15 euro.
