Gabriel Francisco Schürrer Peralta (born 16 August 1971) is an Argentine professional football manager and former player.

He spent the better part of his career in Spain, appearing for five different clubs in nearly one full decade (1996 to 2004, 2006–07) and amassing La Liga totals of 235 games and 13 goals.

Playing career

Club
Born in Rafaela, Santa Fe Province, Schürrer was best known for his eight-year stint in four La Liga clubs (two seasons apiece), most notably with Deportivo de La Coruña where he helped with 19 league games in the team's 1999–2000 league conquest. In 2004, he moved to Greece with Olympiacos FC, where he also remained two seasons.

After retiring at the end of the 2006–07 campaign at the age of almost 36, with Málaga CF, having played only ten competitive matches with the Andalusians in the second division, Schürrer returned to Argentina, serving as a youth coach at Club Atlético Lanús which he also represented as a player in the early 90s.

International
Schürrer gained four caps for Argentina, his debut coming in 1995. He was picked for the squad at that year's Copa América, as the national team exited in the quarterfinals against Brazil.

Managerial career
In November 2010, Schürrer was appointed head coach of Lanús' first team after the departure of Luis Zubeldía. He left in July 2012.
