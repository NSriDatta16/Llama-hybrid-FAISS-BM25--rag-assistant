These creatures' powers are related to the phase of the moon, strongest when the moon is full and weakest when it is new.

Mahiru learns that she is the "Descendant of the Princess" and that the members of the Lunar Race she has encountered, known as the Moonlight Bandits, need her help to recover the "Teardrops of the Moon," the source of their power.
