History
The concept for the park started in 1987 as a minimum-gauge railway that owner Lee Merrick constructed as a hobby. Guests often visited to ride it to his christmas tree farm. It proved popular enough for him to purchase the land the park currently stands on and build a concession stand. He was already beginning to collect and refurbish vintage children's rides, and was beginning to plan expanding to a park around 1989 when he met his business partner Darrell Klompmaker. They opened in 1991 with mini golf, the railway, bumper cars, a ferris wheel, a Tilt-a-Whirl, and a fire truck ride. In 1993, they added the Little Dipper, Mad Mouse, and Tobboggan, and became the only park in Wisconsin to have a permanent roller coaster at the time. In 2003, they purchased a wooden roller coaster, The Meteor. They had to replace about 75% of the wood, but it became the first wooden coaster that was moved to a new park more than one time.  Lee Merrick passed in 2011.
