Deadfall is an original novel by Gary Russell  featuring the fictional archaeologist Bernice Summerfield. The New Adventures were a spin-off from the long-running British science fiction television series Doctor Who.

Deadfall was the first of the post-Doctor Who New Adventures not to be centred on Bernice Summerfield. Instead, the main characters are Jason Kane (Benny's ex-husband) and Chris Cwej, both previously introduced in the Doctor Who New Adventures, and Emile Mars-Smith, previously introduced in an earlier post-Doctor Who New Adventure, Beyond the Sun. The Knights of Jeneve, an organisation introduced in the post-Doctor Who New Adventure Dragons' Wrath but related to the Doctor Who organisation UNIT, also feature.

Elements of the plot were re-used from Russell's play of the same name in the fan fiction Audio Visuals series (written under the pseudonym Warren Martyn).
