History
Purple City, also known as PCP or Purple City Productions, is closely affiliated with other Harlem-based artists such as The Diplomats. Purple City began in 2001 when Shiest Bub met Cam'Ron of The Diplomats at a shoe store. After exchanging numbers and weed, a connection was made. Shiest had the Purple, and soon enough Shiest was running around with Dip Set and Purple City was born. Cam'Ron served as mentors to Shiest, leading him to create Purple City and began to put out mixtapes. To date, Purple City has released eight mixtapes, selling an estimated 11,234 copies, and launching the career of E-Norm. Purple City has also commercially released three albums, Paris to Purple City, The Purple Album, and Road to the Riches: The Best of the Purple City Mixtapes
