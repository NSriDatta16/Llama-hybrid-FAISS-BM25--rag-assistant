History
When constructed in 1986, it was the first service area directly accessible from the M25.

The building was destroyed in August 1998 following a fire started in a deep fryer with no fire suppression system; an incident which has been subsequently studied.

An unusual heist of 2,900 dresses all of the same design occurred in the lorry park at the service area on the morning of 13 August 2013. The loot was valued at Â£17,000.

The 2019 Motorway Services User Survey found that South Mimms was in the top five motorway services in the UK for customer satisfaction.
