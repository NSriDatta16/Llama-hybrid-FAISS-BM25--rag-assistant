Paul Simon in Concert: Live Rhymin' is a live album by Paul Simon, released in March 1974 by Columbia Records. It was recorded in the wake of the release of There Goes Rhymin' Simon, which produced a number of hit singles ("Kodachrome" and "Loves Me Like a Rock") and radio staples ("Something So Right" and "Take Me to the Mardi Gras"), at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana and Carnegie Hall in New York during Simon's 1973–74 tour. The album featured both Latin and gospel influences, both in the arrangements and the performance style of the guests

Simon was joined by Urubamba for "El Cóndor Pasa (If I Could)", "Duncan", and "The Boxer", then brought out the Jessy Dixon Singers for the rest of the concert, before concluding with "America" on his own.

The album was Simon's first live release and showed him performing Simon & Garfunkel songs solo in concert for the first time, alternating with his solo songs.

Near the end of the album, an audience member calls out for Simon to "say a few words." He replies: "Say a few words? Well, let's hope that we continue to live."

The album was a moderate success. It reached No. 33 in the U.S. and was eventually certified gold by the RIAA. However, it failed to chart at all in the UK. Further, two of the live performances were released as a single as part of the promotion for the album: the breakthrough Simon & Garfunkel "The Sound of Silence" as the A-side, along with Simon's debut single "Mother and Child Reunion" on the B-side.
