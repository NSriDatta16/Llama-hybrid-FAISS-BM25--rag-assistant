He was president of the Astrological Lodge of London from 1985 to 1987 and of the Astrological Association of Great Britain from 1994 to 1999.

History of astrology and cultural astronomy 
Concurrently with his activities as an astrologer Campion researched and published on the history of astrology and cultural astronomy. His book on millenarianism, The Great Year (1994), was described by Daily Telegraph journalist Damian Thompson as "a monumental study of historical schemes".
In 1997 he founded the peer-reviewed journal Culture and Cosmos.
