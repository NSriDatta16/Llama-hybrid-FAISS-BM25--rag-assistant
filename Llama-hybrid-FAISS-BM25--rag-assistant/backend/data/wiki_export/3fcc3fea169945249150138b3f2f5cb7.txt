In 1815, he was appointed to the Legislative Council of Upper Canada but he never attended. He helped found the Highland Society of Canada in 1818. He died in St. Andrews in 1832.

He married Isabella, daughter of John MacDonell of Leek, cadets of the Clan MacDonell of Glengarry, being a descendant of the 7th Chief of Glengarry who died in 1645. MacDonell, who was wounded at the Battle of Culloden (1746), was one of the three brothers who helped form the Glengarry Fencibles under their Chief, Colonel Alexander Ranaldson MacDonell of Glengarry. Neil and Isabella's sons Archibald and Alexander were both members of the Legislative Assembly for the province and Archibald later became its chief justice.
