Harold's Chicken Shack (also referred to as The Fried Chicken King, Harold's Chicken, or simply Harold's) is a popular fried chicken restaurant based in Chicago, Illinois. The chain operates primarily in Chicago's predominantly black communities but has additional locations in Carbondale, Illinois; Springfield, Illinois; Northwest Indiana; Indianapolis, Indiana; Phoenix, Arizona; Atlanta, Georgia; Las Vegas, Nevada; St. Louis, Missouri; Houston, Texas; and Los Angeles, California.

History
Harold Pierce, an African-American entrepreneur who moved to Chicago in 1943, founded the restaurant on June 22, 1950, at the corner of 47th Street and Kenwood, near the estate where he worked as a chauffeur. Harold and his wife also operated a soul food restaurant on 39th street called the H&H (Harold&Hilda); their specialties were dumplings and chicken feet. Pierce differed from other fast-food innovators in his development of Harold's brand. He wanted each franchisor to develop its personality rather than forcing each to fit the same mold. Some Harold's restaurants are very informal, with takeaway chicken served by employees standing behind a window of bulletproof glass (originally introduced as a necessity rather than an aesthetic concern). Others offer the option to dine in. Harold's Chicken Shacks may or may not offer fountain drinks, additional menu items, catering services, or delivery. The only constants are the basic chicken dinners and the emblem of a cook chasing a chicken with a cleaver. Even this varies greatly, sometimes rendered in lights and sometimes hand-painted. Often, the cook is dressed like a King. Harold's restaurants are also referred to as "Harold's: The Fried Chicken King", which can be seen on many older South Side signs.

Harold's Chicken Shack is located primarily in Chicago, Illinois, with 40 locations across the city, particularly on its South Side. Many South Side locations resulted from systemic racism, which limited Pierce's expansion opportunities to black neighborhoods.  There are dozens of "shacks" on Chicago's South Side and the neighboring southern suburbs, several on the West Side and a few on the North Side.

Connection to culture
Harold's Chicken Shack is part of Chicago's South Side culture. The restaurant is often referenced by Chicago's hip-hop community, including Kanye West, Common, Rhymefest, Juice, G Herbo, Chance the Rapper, Freddie Gibbs, Lupe Fiasco and Dreezy. Rapper Wale stated in the song That Way, that Harold's Chicken was overrated. Top Dawg Entertainment rapper Kendrick Lamar mentioned Harold's Chicken in Fredo Santana's song, "Jealous", in which Lamar is featured, where he claimed he loved it so much he flew a private jet there straight from Rome.

Harold's has been shown in a scene on the television show South Side, as well as part of the music video for BJ The Chicago Kid's "It's True". Harold's is also shown next to the bar visited early in the movie Weird Science.
