State Route 14 (SR 14) is a major east-to-west state highway in the U.S. state of Alabama. Spanning , the highway begins at the Mississippi state line at the terminus of Mississippi Highway 69 (MS 69) and connects the cities of Selma and Prattville before ending at SR 147 on the western side of Auburn.

History

SR 14 was one of the original routes in the Alabama's first statewide highway system in the 1920s. The original routing followed much of the same path as today, but was significantly shorter. The highway as built then started in Selma and traveled east along its current route to Auburn. As was standard for highways of the era, SR 14 was unpaved for its full length. The first paved section was constructed in 1932 between Elmore and Wetumpka. Paving continued sporadically for the next 15 years, with the last gravel section on the route being paved in 1947.

In 1956–57, the state renumbered many highways, and as a result other state highways to the northwest of Selma were renumbered as SR 14, extending the highway to the Mississippi state line along its modern course. In the 1960s, when the first segment of Interstate 85 (I-85) was constructed, bypassing Auburn and Opelika, SR 14 was extended from its eastern end at US 29 in Auburn along US 29 through Opelika to the northern end of that first Interstate Highway segment, at the current exit 64.  When US 280 was re-routed to meet I-85 between Auburn and Opelika in 1998, SR-14 was truncated to a new eastern endpoint at US 280 in Opelika. In 2009, it was further truncated to its present terminus at the junction with SR 147.
