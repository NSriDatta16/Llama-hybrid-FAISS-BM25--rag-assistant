The numerals and derived numbers of the Proto-Indo-European language (PIE) have been reconstructed by modern linguists based on similarities found across all Indo-European languages. The following article lists and discusses their hypothesized forms.

Cardinal numbers
The cardinal numbers are reconstructed as follows:

Other reconstructions typically differ only slightly from Beekes and Sihler. A nineteenth-century reconstruction (by Brugmann) for thousand is . See also Fortson 2004.

The elements  (in the numerals "twenty" to "ninety") and  (in "hundred") are reconstructed on the assumption that these numerals are derivatives of *deḱm̥(t) "ten".

Lehmann believes that the numbers greater than ten were constructed separately in the dialect groups and that  originally meant "a large number" rather than specifically "one hundred."

Gender of numerals
The numbers three and four had feminine forms with the suffix , reconstructed as  and , respectively.

Numerals as prefixes
Special forms of the numerals were used as prefixes, usually to form bahuvrihis (like five-fingered in English):

Ordinal numbers
The ordinal numbers are difficult to reconstruct due to their significant variation in the daughter languages. The following reconstructions are tentative:

"first" is formed with  (related to some adverbs meaning "forth, forward, front" and to the particle  "forth", thus originally meaning "foremost" or similar) plus various suffixes like  (cf. Latin primus, Russian perv-).
"second": The daughter languages use a wide range of expressions, often unrelated to the word for "two" (including Latin and English), so that no PIE form can be reconstructed. A number of languages use the form derived from *h₂enteros meaning "the other [of two]" (cf. OCS vĭtorŭ, Lithuanian añtras, Old Icelandic annarr)
"third" to "sixth" were formed from the cardinals plus the suffix :  "third" etc.
"seventh" to "tenth" were formed by adding the thematic vowel  to the cardinal:  "eighth" etc.

The cardinals ending in a syllabic nasal (seven, nine, ten) inserted a second nasal before the thematic vowel, resulting in the suffixes  and . These and the suffix  spread to neighbouring ordinals, seen for example in Vedic  "eighth" and Lithuanian  "ninth".
