Saul Rappaport is a professor emeritus of physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Rappaport became  assistant professor in the MIT Department of Physics in 1969 and became a full professor in 1981. From 1993 to 1995, he was head of the Astrophysics Division.

He received his A.B. from Temple University in 1963 and his Ph.D. from MIT in 1968.

His main research interest is in binary systems containing collapsed starsâ€”white dwarfs, neutron stars (including pulsars), and black holes. He has authored numerous papers regarding the discovery of astronomical phenomena, such as the discovery of transiting exocomets and the discovery of a quadruple star system containing two strongly interacting eclipsing binaries.

He was elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society in 1989 "for major contributions to our understanding of the evolution of binary stellar systems containing a compact member and for the determination of the masses of neutron stars"
