Harke & Burr are two fictional comic book characters who appeared in their own stories for thirteen episodes in issues of British comic Judge Dredd Megazine. The majority of the Harke & Burr stories were written by Si Spencer and drawn by Dean Ormston. Gordon Rennie co-wrote one story and Paul Peart provided the artwork for another. The name is a Spoonerism based on infamous body-snatchers Burke and Hare who committed the West Port murders.
