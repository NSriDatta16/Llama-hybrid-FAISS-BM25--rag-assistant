Paul Brodie,  (April 10, 1934 – November 19, 2007) was a Canadian saxophonist, pupil of Marcel Mule. In 1994, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada, Canada's highest civilian honour, for having "shown true mastery of his art through his ability to reach all ages with his music".

Since 1960, he performed over 3000 concerts in Canada, United States, Mexico, France, England, India, Singapore, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Israel, Australia, China, Italy, Scotland, Russia and Argentina (1998). He is a very heavily recorded concert saxophonist - with 50 albums recorded for Golden Crest Records, CBC International Service, CBC  Enterprise, Truly Fine Records, Classic Edition, Music Minus One, China Records, Dinant Records, and ROI Records (Hong Kong).

Warren Beatty featured his saxophone playing on the soundtrack of his Academy Award-winning film Heaven Can Wait. He was also included on Clyde Gilmour's Favourites, an album celebrating Clyde Gilmour's 25 years on one of the most famous programs ever heard on CBC Radio. Brodie has appeared as a soloist with most of the leading orchestras in Canada and has often been featured on CBC Radio, CBC Stereo, CBC Television, CTV and Global. In 1980, he commissioned Ben Steinberg to write Suite Sephardi for him.

He is the author of A Student's Guide to the Saxophone, as well as three books of  saxophone solos published by Frederick Harris Music. In 1969, Brodie co-founded with Eugene Rousseau, another pupil of Marcel Mule, the World Saxophone Congress and he has been an artist/clinician for The Selmer Company of the US for over 30 years.
