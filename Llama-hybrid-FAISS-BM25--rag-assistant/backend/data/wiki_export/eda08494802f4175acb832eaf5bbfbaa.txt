History
UCSY's origins trace back to the founding of the Universities' Computer Center (UCC) in 1971 at the Hlaing Campus of Yangon University. Equipped with ICL ICL 1902S and with the help of distinguished visiting professors from US, UK and Europe,  UCC provided computer education and training to university and government employees. In 1973, it began offering a master's degree program (MSc in Computer Science), and a graduate diploma program (Diploma in Automated Computing) in cooperation with the Mathematics Department of Yangon University. The center added DEC PDP-11/70 mini-computers in 1983, and personal computers in 1990. In 1986, the center added B.C.Sc. (Bachelor of Computer Science) and B.C.Tech. (Bachelor of Computer Technology) degree programs.

In March 1988, the Institute of Computer Science and Technology (ICST) was established, and began offering bachelor's degree programs in Computer Science. In 1993, it started an internationally accepted International Diploma in Computer Studies (IDCS) program with the help of UK's the National Computing Centre (NCC). On 1 January 1997, the university's control was transferred from the Ministry of Education to the Ministry Science and Technology. On 1 July 1998, it was renamed the University of Computer Studies, Yangon. A graduate school with master's and PhD degree programs was established in May 2001.
