İdmanocağı or İdman Ocağı is a Turkish sports club based in Trabzon, Turkey. The club had a strong rivalry with another club, İdmangücü, which matched the Istanbul derby between Fenerbahçe and Galatasaray. İdmanocağı were compared to Galatasaray in that period, partly because of this rivalry and partly because of their red and yellow colours. The football department discontinued in 1967 when they were forced by the Turkish Football Federation to merge with İdmangücü and two other local clubs, Karadenizgücü and Martıspor to form Trabzonspor.

They were founded as the first club in the city of Trabzon. Being old and deeply rooted in the city, they played a huge role in the development of various sports in the city. The club also have a women's volleyball department.

All districts of the city supported the efforts of these young people. The initiative came to a happy ending on 20 January 1921, when the first sports club was eventually established in Trabzon.
