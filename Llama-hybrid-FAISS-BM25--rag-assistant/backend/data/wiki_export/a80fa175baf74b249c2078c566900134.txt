Viewpoint School is an independent school located in Calabasas, California. The school is coeducational, with students enrolled from Transitional Kindergarten through the twelfth grade. Enrollment in the 2014–15 school year was 1,200, making it the fourth largest institution in the California Association of Independent Schools (CAIS).

History
In Viewpoint School's first year, 1961, it occupied leased facilities in Encino, California and enrolled 24 students. Mrs. Thelma Sitton was the school's first principal. The school's enrollment and recognition grew. Portions of the campus moved west and for several years shared space with a church on Platt Avenue in Woodland Hills. For the 1965–66 school year, Viewpoint moved grades 6, 7, and 8 to its current location in Calabasas, constructing its first building (3 trailers) there. A permanent lower school building followed on shortly thereafter.

As enrollment increased in the 1960s and 1970s, Viewpoint included additional grades to meet demand and Viewpoint graduated its first senior class in 1982. This year, construction was also begun on Viewpoint's second academic building. Art O'Leary served as headmaster of Viewpoint from 1980 to 1986. Dr. Robert J. Dworkoski began his term on O'Leary's retirement in 1986. In June 2014, after 28 years as Headmaster, Dr. Dworkoski moved into the role of President of the Viewpoint Educational Foundation. During the 2014–15 school year, Paul Rosenbaum served as Interim Head of School. As of June 2015,  Mark McKee is Head of School.

In 2005, Viewpoint opened a third building in the first phase of the School's Master Plan. A new athletic field was completed in 2007, a library in 2009, and a new  arts and athletics facility was completed fall 2011. It includes classrooms, science labs, and art studios. The Paul Family Athletic Center features a 900-seat gymnasium for volleyball and basketball, as well as additional space for a fitness center, locker rooms, and coaches' offices. In February 2015, the School opened the 4,100 square-foot Balaban-Webster Team Center.

Curriculum
As of 1988 the school offered French instruction from Pre-Kindergarten through grade 12, and Viewpoint required secondary students in grades 7–12 to have at least three years of foreign language instruction in French, Spanish, Latin or Mandarin. Foreign language instruction was four days per week for grades 9-12 and five days per week for grades 7 and 8.

Controversy
Viewpoint was accused of shielding a teacher who had been convicted of sexually abusing a student while working at a prior school. Viewpoint has received media attention about its vape control policies.

Viewpoint School fields 22 varsity athletic teams in the California Interscholastic Federation Southern Section. Teams also compete at the junior varsity and middle school levels. The Patriots have won 18 CIF Southern Section Championships in the past eight years. Since 2008, Viewpoint's Upper School Athletic teams have won 57 team and individual league titles, and nine CIF Southern Section Titles. Viewpoint was awarded the Commissioner's Cup, which recognizes “comprehensive excellence in interscholastic competition” for its boys athletic program in 2006–07.
