History

In 1997, after the track opened, Las Vegas Motor Speedway received a second-tier series date as a support to the Cup Series event. The race has usually been held as one of the first five races of the season.

On March 8, 2017, it was announced that Las Vegas Motor Speedway, would get a second Cup date, a second Xfinity date, and a second Truck date starting in 2018. The fall Cup and Truck Series races at New Hampshire Motor Speedway were moved to Las Vegas and Kentucky Speedway's fall Xfinity Series date (which had been a standalone race for the series) was moved to Las Vegas. The new date that Las Vegas acquired from Kentucky became the final race of the regular season to replace the Overton's 300 at Chicagoland Speedway which moved to June. Due to anti-Buschwhacking rules, only Xfinity Series regulars competing for the championship points were permitted to race in the fall race.

In 2019, with the announcement of the track's September weekend going prime-time, the race became a Saturday night event. For 2022, the fall race received an extra lap in the process to make the race close to 302 miles with the event being 301.5 miles/201 laps in length. (This is similar to the Cup Series race at New Hampshire Motor Speedway (another SMI track), which is 301 miles in length.)

In 2021, Alsco became the title sponsor of the spring Xfinity Series race at Las Vegas, replacing Boyd Gaming, which had been the title sponsor from 2014 to 2020.

In 2024, the Laborers' International Union of North America Local 872 (the branch of the union based in Las Vegas) became the title sponsor of the track's spring Xfinity Series race, replacing Alsco.
