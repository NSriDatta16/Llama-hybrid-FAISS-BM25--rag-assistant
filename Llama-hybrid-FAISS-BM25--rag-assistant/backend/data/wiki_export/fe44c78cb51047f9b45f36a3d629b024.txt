Robin Hood and the Tinker is Child Ballad 127.

Synopsis

Robin Hood meets with a tinker and tells him that two tinkers were put in the stocks for drinking ale and beer.  The tinker tells him that he has a warrant for Robin Hood in his pouch.  Robin tells him to come with him to Nottingham.  They stop at an inn to drink.  When the tinker is drunk, Robin takes the warrant and his money and leaves the tinker with the bill.  The host tells him that the man he drank with was Robin Hood.  The tinker starts tracking him down and fights with him, but when he is winning, he lets Robin blow on his horn.
