Høgni Lisberg (born 7 June 1982) is a Faroese musician.

Band and personal history
Høgni was born in 1982 and is son of Sørin Lisberg and Hallbjørg Eliassen. His father is son of Knút Lisberg, who is cousin to Jens Olivur Lisberg (1896–1920) where his great-grandfather, and thus Jens Olivurs uncle, lived Johan í Smiðjuni. Høgni lived together with his two younger sisters in Leirvík, where he grew up. He moved to Copenhagen in 2004.

Høgni Lisberg, also known from ethno-rock band Clickhaze fame, released his first solo album, Most Beautiful Things in 2003. The album reached number 2 on Tutl Records’ sales charts on the Faroe Islands. This led Høgni to huge success in both his home country and in Switzerland, where the press gave him a lot of publicity during his Switzerland tour in 2004. In 2005 Høgni played at the Danish Nibe Festival, the exclusive Faroese bi-yearly showcase Atlantic Music Event, and the largest music festival on the Faroe Islands, the G! Festival. Between 2006-2011 Høgni toured and played at SXSW, Midem, Roskilde Festival, Iceland Airwaves, Italia Wave Love Festival, as well as warming up for Badly Drawn Boy and Paolo Nutini.

Høgni's first solo album Most Beautiful Things was released in 2003, only a year after his previous unit Clickhaze was dissolved.
