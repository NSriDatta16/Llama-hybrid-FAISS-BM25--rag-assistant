Peter Woods is an American comic book artist, known for his work on titles such as Backlash, Deadpool, Robin, Catwoman, Amazons Attack, and Action Comics.

Career
Woods worked as an intern for Wildstorm comics in April 1996 working under artist Jim Lee. Here he got his first major comics work filling in on Stormwatch and Wetworks in 1996, before getting a short run on Backlash in 1997. He moved over to Marvel Comics to draw a few issues of Excalibur before starting a critically acclaimed run on Deadpool with Joe Kelly. He was then picked up by DC Comics for a four-year stint on Robin, from 2000 to 2004, followed by an exclusive contract in 2001 and further work in DC titles.

He later partnered with other Portland, Oregon area artists and formed Mercury Studio in 2002. Mercury Studio increased in membership and changed its name to "Periscope Studios" in June 2007, but remains a collective of cartoonists, illustrators, writers, concept designers, graphic novelists and storyboard artists based in Portland, Oregon. His wife, Rebecca, whom he met at Wildstorm, is also a part of the Portland studio.

Woods would then become one of the artists in the Superman family of titles, working on the "New Krypton" arc in Action Comics and the Last Stand of New Krypton mini-series. He returned Action Comics in 2010, alongside writer Paul Cornell.

Awards
 1998: Deadpool #11 was nominated for the "Best Single Issue or Story" Harvey Award
