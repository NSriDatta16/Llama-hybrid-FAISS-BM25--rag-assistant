Rev. Frederick Lewis Weis, Th.D. (August 22, 1895 â€“ April 11, 1966) was an American historian and the writer of a number of well-known genealogical books.

Born in Cranston, Rhode Island to John Peter Carl Weis and his wife Georgina Lewis, both natives of Massachusetts, Frederick was the second child of four children.

In April 1913, he entered the United States Naval Academy, graduating in March 1917. He served on the Wisconsin and North Dakota and retired prematurely due to illness. He was active in various genealogical organizations and wrote numerous books and articles. He is today still remembered as a foundational writer in many areas of genealogical research.

He was elected a Fellow of the American Society of Genealogists in 1951.

He died at Brattleboro, Vermont.
