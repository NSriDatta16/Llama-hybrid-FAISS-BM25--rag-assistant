The Silver Moccasin Trail is a  trail located in the San Gabriel Mountains, northeast of Los Angeles. It begins at Chantry Flat Recreation Area above the city of Arcadia, California, traversing upward and down through several canyons and along the high ridges of the Angeles National Forest. This trail connects Mt. Baden-Powell, Mount Burnham, Throop Peak and Mount Hawkins.  It comes to its highest point of  at Mount Baden-Powell after which point it descends to its terminus at Vincent Gap on the Angeles Crest Highway near Wrightwood.

Background
The landscape of the Silver Moccasin Trail varies from lowland chaparral slopes, to oak-lined canyons, to the fir and pine forests of Mt. Baden-Powell, where several Southern California councils of the Boy Scouts of America have placed a monument to their founder, Lord Robert Baden-Powell.

The Silver Moccasin Trail started as a series of Indian trails originally created by the local Native Americans (probably Tongva), but its use was continued by Anglo settlers who either hunted or hiked along its route. In 1942, the Los Angeles Area Council of Boy Scouts established a designated route as the Silver Moccasin Trail, and any Scouts who complete the hike, usually involving several days travel, are qualified to receive the Silver Moccasins Award. Boy Scouts, especially those who are enrolled in "hiking troops," walk this trail usually as part of a five-day backpack trip.

The LA Area Council, BSA map that was printed before 1953 (has the name "Flores" in the corner) showed a 60 mile route.  It started at the end of the Pacific Electric rail line At Grand View Avenue (6 miles from Chantry Flat).  The trail ended at Camp Pepperdine (elevation 6150Â ft elevation) near Jackson Lake. The map identifies the six USGS topographic maps for the trail (Sierra Madre, Mt. Wilson, Alder Creek, Waterman Mtn, Crystal Lake, and Mt Baden Powell Quadrangles). The map showed the Mt Baden Powell summit as a short side trip off the main trail.

Alternate starting points, or trailheads, have been established for the SMT more than likely due to overuse or overcrowding at Chantry Flat, which has somewhat reduced the adventuresome attractiveness of the younger, less-traveled version.  However, sections of the trail which are only  to  in length while reaching the Baden-Powell summit qualify it as a  (flatland) hike due to gains in elevation which are about . The Baden-Powell portions of the hike are also beneficial for acclimation to altitudes for beginning hikers who may experience mild altitude sickness between  and .
