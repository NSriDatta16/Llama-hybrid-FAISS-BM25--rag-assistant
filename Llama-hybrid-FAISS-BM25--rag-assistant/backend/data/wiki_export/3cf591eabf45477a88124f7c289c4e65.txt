The large-billed leaf warbler (Phylloscopus magnirostris) is a species of migratory leaf warbler (family Phylloscopidae) found in Asia. 

This is a somewhat large leaf warbler with a single wing bar and a prominent supercilium. A contrasting broad and dark eye stripe extending behind the eye, a large darkish upper mandible and a distinctive call set it apart from most other leaf warblers in its range. It can be confused with an Arctic warbler.

Breeding in central China and the Himalayas, it winters in Sri Lanka, the Western Ghats and associated hill ranges. It is found in dense vegetation and is more often heard than seen. The two note dir-tee call with the second note much higher is distinctive. Another call is a single faint note followed by a series of paired-notes descending evenly. They call often and at regular intervals.
