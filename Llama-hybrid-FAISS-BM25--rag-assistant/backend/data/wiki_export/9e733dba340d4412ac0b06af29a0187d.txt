Alberta Provincial Highway No. 26, commonly referred to as Highway 26, is an east–west highway in central Alberta, Canada that connects Highway 13 in Camrose  to Highway 14 near Kinsella.  The route follows 12th Correction Line for its entire length, and does not pass through any communities east of Camrose.

The Highway 26 designation first belonged to a stretch of road near Drumheller.  The present-day alignment near Camrose was not commissioned until the 1970s, and in 2009 was extended from Highway 36 to reach the current eastern terminus at Highway 14.
