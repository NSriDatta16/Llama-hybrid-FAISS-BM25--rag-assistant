Henrik Hellstenius (born 28 April 1963) is a Norwegian composer and musicologist.

Born in Bærum, Norway, Hellstenius studied musicology at the University of Oslo and composition with Lasse Thoresen, Olav Anton Thommessen and Bjørn Kruse  at the Norwegian Academy of Music in Oslo. He studied in 1992–1993 with Gérard Grisey at the Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique et de Danse de Paris  in Paris, and he also studied computer-supported composition at IRCAM.

Hellstenius is currently professor in composition and music theory at the Norwegian Academy of Music.

Hellstenius’ compositional output spans a wide stylistic field, including opera, chamber music, orchestral works, electro-acoustic music and scores for theatre, film and ballet. His works have seen performances throughout the Nordics, Russia, Australia, the U.S., Canada, England, Scotland, Greece, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, Germany, France, Holland and Japan. His works have been featured at festivals such as the Bourges Festival for electro-acoustic music in France, the International Rostrum for Composers in Paris, the DUT-festival in Copenhagen, Nordic Music Days and the ULTIMA Oslo Contemporary Music Festival, performed by ensembles Cikada, Oslo Sinfonietta, BIT20 Ensemble and Ensemble Court Circuit.

Hellstenius has also penned scores for a number of stage productions. In addition to his two operas, Sera and Ophelias: Death by Water Singing – both premiered at the ULTIMA Oslo Contemporary Music Festival and later performed in Poland and Germany – Hellstenius has also worked closely with playwrights Jon Fosse, Cecilie Løveid, Liv Heløe as well as choreographer Ingun Bjørnsgaard.

Hellstenius is also focusing on other forms of stage productions including instrumental theatre or staged concerts.  An example of this compositional practice is the project Ørets Teater I.IV, premiered at the 2011 Bergen International Festival, for which Hellstenius was composer in residence. Following its premiere, the work was adapted and rewritten for a 2015 ULTIMA Oslo Contemporary Music Festival performance. For the 2014/2015 concert season, Hellstenius was the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra’s profile composer.

Hellstenius’ works are published by Edition Wilhelm Hansen/The Music Sales Group.
