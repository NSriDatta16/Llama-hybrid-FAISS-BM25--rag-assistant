Leila Forouhar (, Leil√¢ Foruhar; born 23 February 1959) is an Iranian pop and classical singer. She was a child star, acting from the age of 3. She relocated to next door Turkey in 1986, then to Paris, before emigrating to Los Angeles in 1988.

Career
Leila is the daughter of the late Iranian actor Jahangir Forouhar. As a child she acted in movies in minor roles, receiving recognition for her part in Soltane Ghalbha (King of Hearts). As a teenager she began modeling for fashion magazines. She continued to act in movies and has featured in over 47 films, including Ezteraab, Four Sisters and The Thirsty Ones.

Move to France
War with neighboring Iraq had a negative impact on the Iranian movie and music industry. The Forouhar family stayed in Tehran until deciding to emigrate from the country.

Move to the United States
In 1988 Forouhar and her family moved to the United States.

Leila's songs are popular in countries including Iran, Iraq, Armenia and  the United States. She has released more than 20 albums. Her album "Planet of Harmony" included songs in English, Italian, Greek, Arabic, Hebrew, Armenian, Turkish and Kurdish.

In August 2004 Leila married Los Angeles-based businessman Esmaeil Nabi. Forouhar's nephew is American Muslim reformer Reza Aslan.

In March 2010 she sang at an international celebration of the festival of Nowruz at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C.

Leila covered Dolly Parton's Jolene on her 1976 album Do Parande (, English: Two Birds).
