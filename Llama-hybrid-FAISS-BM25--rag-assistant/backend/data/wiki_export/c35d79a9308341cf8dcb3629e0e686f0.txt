The Curse of the Pharaohs is a historical mystery novel by Elizabeth Peters, first published in 1981 and the second in the Amelia Peabody series of novels; it takes place in the excavation season of 1892–93.

Plot summary

The Emersons are at home in Kent, England; Emerson is a professor, teaching and writing a book, and they are raising their young son Ramses. Ramses is a precocious 4-year-old who can identify a bone as the femur of an animal. Lady Baskerville arrives in Kent and asks them to finish the excavation started by her husband Lord Henry Baskerville, who died mysteriously just before opening a tomb in Luxor.

They spend Christmas with Walter and Evelyn and their children at Chalfont House; Emerson and Amelia travel the next day, leaving Ramses with his cousins. They arrive in Cairo, hearing the talk of the curse of the pharaohs. Reporter Kevin O’Connell of the Daily Yell, inventor of the curse, introduces himself. Emerson is quite voluble against reporters.

The Emersons arrive at the Baskerville compound near the Valley of the Kings. Cyrus Vandergelt, a wealthy American who is an amateur Egyptologist, feels a duty to the Baskervilles and much curiosity about the dig. He joins the crew and develops a respectful relationship with the Emersons. German Karl von Bork, trained in reading hieroglyphs, is already part of the crew. They settle into the house, where Lady Baskerville joins them. Alan Armadale was the lead archaeologist, but he is missing. The photographer is Charles Milverton. Old and obnoxious Mrs Berengaria and her daughter Mary, artist for the dig, also live in the house. Mary has friends and suitors; her mother pretends to follow the ancient Egyptian religion as a princess, gets very drunk, and makes only enemies.

It is clear that overnight guards are needed at the dig. Hassan takes the duty, sees Armadale at Lady Baskerville’s window. and both are murdered. Emerson locates Ali, who leads Amelia, Abdullah and O’Connell to the body of Armadale, where his cat Bastet was waiting. Ali leads them in circles until Amelia takes charge; he was going slowly so his comrades from Gurneh could attack the dig. Abdullah returns to the house with the body of Armadale, while Amelia and O’Connor arrive in time to interrupt that attack.

Armadale’s body is marked with a serpent symbol, as was that of Lord Baskerville. It appears that both were murdered, but examination of their bodies gives no clue as to how.

Milverton tells Amelia that he is under an assumed name; he is Arthur, the nephew of Lord Baskerville, heir to his title. The next day, they find Arthur near death, hit on the head and shoved under his bed. A doctor and a nurse (a French Catholic nun) are called to aid his recovery. Arthur had not introduced himself as his nephew before his uncle died.

Amelia negotiates a deal with O’Connell; he gets exclusives from the Emersons but Emerson will read his copy before it is sent for publication.

The servants in the house and the workers at the dig all go on strike after Armadale’s body is seen in the house. Amelia and Emerson get them working again. Amelia gets Daoud, nephew to Abdullah, to guard Arthur’s sick room. Amelia devotes much thought to who is murdering and why. Lady Baskerville falls apart under the tensions; Cyrus steps up to propose marriage to the new widow. Madame Berengaria appears, drunk and demanding breakfast.

Emerson stages a show outdoors, a fantasia, for all. It restores confidence. Amelia and Emerson compete to name the murderer, putting their choice in sealed envelopes.

Emerson announces he will guard the dig overnight. Amelia heads out there, expecting the murderer to attempt killing Emerson, which she does. Lady Baskerville is caught in the act by Amelia, before succeeding. 

Lady Baskerville has motive. She had affairs with other men; her husband threatened divorce, the end of her comfortable life. Lady Baskerville seduced Armadale, which ruined him; he loved her. She argued with her husband and Armadale punched him. She murdered her unconscious husband with a hat pin. She killed Armadale and Hassan next. She attacked Arthur in his sleep, as she knew his true identity and encouraged his secrecy. She was interrupted before she could finish. Thus the need for unbiased guards while he recuperates.

Vandergelt relates how she still expects him to marry her. He declines.

Madame Berengaria died from drink, laced with opium by Lady Baskerville. She had related the story of two brothers, a fairy tale from ancient Egypt, featuring an unfaithful wife.

Mary accepts Karl’s proposal of marriage, marrying soon after in Luxor. Arthur is the next Lord Baskerville. Two months later, the Emersons head home, with Bastet the cat and their share of the tomb goods, the many non-kingly mummies they uncovered. They plan to work next season, with their son.
