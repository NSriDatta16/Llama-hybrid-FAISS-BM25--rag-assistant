The Jewish Community High School of the Bay (commonly known as JCHS) is a coeducational, college preparatory high school located in the Western Addition Neighborhood of San Francisco, California. Founded in 2001, JCHS is a pluralistic Jewish high school.

History

Founding 

The idea for a pluralistic Jewish high school serving the Bay Area was initially conceptualized by Nancy Zimmerman Pechner, a local artist, in 1997. Zimmerman partnered with Noah's Bagels-founder Noah Alper, who would become JCHS's first board president, to open the school in the fall of 2001.

Tom Lorch was the original head of school, before turning the reins over to Larry Fischer. Fischer, who served as principal of a Connecticut high school of 19 years, resigned after the end of the school's first year. Rabbi Edward Harwitz, the school's principal, was promoted to fill Fischer's position. Rabbi Harwitz, then 37, had been the director of student affairs for Milken Community High School in Los Angeles, California. Harwitz also served as the Head of the Judaic Studies Department and was the School's first rabbi. Harwitz abruptly resigned in February 2005, citing personal reasons. Harwitz was replaced by Rabbi Sheldon Dorph, who served in an interim capacity until Rabbi Howard Ruben was hired in 2007.

Ruben came to JCHS from Anshe Chesed Fairmount Temple in Cleveland, Ohio. The Reform rabbi served in Cleveland for nine years but was originally from the Bay Area. In the past Ruben, who was originally an attorney before being ordained, had worked as the director of the Cincinnati Bureau of Jewish Education and served on the board of various Jewish organizations in San Francisco.

JCHS opened for its inaugural school year in September 2001 in an old pre-school on the campus of Congregation Kol Shofar in Tiburon, California. The school had a three-year lease on the property, and the temporary campus could accommodate 100 students.

Campus 

In the summer of 2001, the New York-based Keren Keshet Foundation spent $20 million to purchase the campus of the California College of Podiatric Medicine, located in the Western Addition Neighborhood of San Francisco. The campus included a multi-wing hospital, a classroom building and a parking garage, all built between the 1920s and 1970s.

Under an agreement with Keren Keshet, the foundation agreed to turn the deed for the property over to the high school if they were able to raise $20 million of their own, or raise enrollment to 400 students.

In the fall of 2002, JCHS moved into the college's 62,000-square-foot, two-story classroom building which was built in 1974. The Jewish Community Library opened its new location on the new JCHS campus in 2003 and JCHS' award-winning lunch program opened in 2004. The first senior class graduated in the spring of 2005.

Student support

Technology
PC desktop workstations are available in the library for student research. A laptop computer program was launched in August 2010, mandating that all students bring a laptop from home or use one the school provides. The laptop program was launched at the same time the school began implementation of Moodle, online course management software.

The technology program was initially plagued by student complaints, including issues with internet speed and an incident in which the Moodle program crashed. In Spring 2012, the school announced they would begin blocking Facebook on the school internet network to halt classroom distractions and increase internet speeds.

Lunch
JCHS' lunch program opened in 2004. The program began under the auspice of food services director Jesse Buckner-Alper, son of Noah Alper the founder of Noah's Bagels. Stu Jacobs took over the program in 2007, and the program won multiple awards during his tenure. In 2009 the JCHS lunch program was awarded the Golden Carrot award, given by Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine. The award was established in 2004 to recognize food service professionals working to promote healthier school lunches. In 2010 the program earned the school a place among the top five "Veg-Friendly Cafeterias" in the country, according to PETA2, the youth-outreach arm of the animal rights PETA organization.
