Robert Dean Boyd (December 3, 1937 â€“ August 28, 2017) was a National Football League (NFL) cornerback who played for the Baltimore Colts in a nine-year career from 1960 to 1968.

When Boyd retired, he was one of eight players with fifty interceptions in NFL history; he was third all-time upon retirement, and only ten players have passed him in the half-century since 1968. He is one of four players with fifty interceptions who played less than ten years. One of three cornerbacks selected for the NFL 1960s All-Decade Team, Boyd is the only one not in the Pro Football Hall of Fame despite having more interceptions than each player.
