Benjimen Daniel Schwimmer (born January 18, 1984) is an American professional dancer, choreographer, actor and director. He was the winner of the second season of So You Think You Can Dance (2006) and has choreographed for both the U.S. and the international versions of the show. He is the only dancer in the world to hold World titles in solo, partner and group divisions at the same time. Schwimmer works on TV, film and stage both in front and behind camera.  He was the specialties choreographer for Quentin Tarantino's "Once Upon a Time In Hollywood".

Early life
Schwimmer was born on January 18, 1984, in Newport Beach, California, and grew up in a Latter-day Saint (Mormon) household in Moreno Valley, California. He is the son of choreographer and West Coast Swing dancer Buddy Schwimmer. His mother, Laurie Schwimmer, and sister, Lacey Schwimmer, are also renowned partner and solo dancers.

He began acting at two, landing nationwide commercials for McDonalds, Pizza Hut, Power Wheels and guest stint on Full House.

He started competing at five years old. He finished his studies early, and then taught dance at 17 years for one semester at Crafton Hills College in Yucaipa.

Schwimmer and his cousin, Heidi Groskreutz (Top 4 finalist on the same season of So You Think You Can Dance), are also U.S. Open and World Showcase Swing champions. Schwimmer put dancing on hold to serve a two-year mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in the Mexican state of Oaxaca. He returned afterwards to the dance circuit.  He founded D.E.M.A.N.D., a non-profit organization that helps the less fortunate and provides health care for dancers with HIV/AIDS and other illnesses, and was a co-owner of 5678 Dance Studio in Redlands since 2011.

Career

After his two year mission and stint on So You Think You Can Dance tours, Schwimmer reclaimed his titles as both US and World Swing Champion with a new partner, Kellese Key in 2008. He has never lost a routine competition.

Schwimmer also appeared in the independent film, Love N' Dancing, starring Amy Smart. He was the cover story in a 10-page spread in "Dancer Magazine", January 9 issue, which featured his own photography. Schwimmer also costarred in the comedy "Leading Ladies".

Paula Abdul hired Schwimmer as her creative director and choreographer for her final performance on American Idol and for her opening show for VH1's Divas:Live '09. He also danced alongside her in both performances.

Working with his father, he choreographed the short program of American figure skater Jeremy Abbott, which was first performed at the 2011 Cup of China. Benji has since choreographed for two different Winter Olympics, including Adam Rippon's "O" .

In 2018, Schwimmer announced his retirement from competing at The Open Swing Dance Champions, being the only dancer to win 14 World Titles with four different partners, never taking a loss.

Schwimmer is currently developing TV and film projects for 2022.

Personal life

Schwimmer is gay. He came out publicly in 2012, after completing his choice of reparative therapy, struggling with his sexuality for a number of years. The catalyst for his decision was the death by suicide of two gay friends. He has since left the LDS Church and publicly criticized their policies against members of the LGBT community.
