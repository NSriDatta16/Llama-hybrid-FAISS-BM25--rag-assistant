She began teaching in Bryn Mawr College's Department of Classical and Near Eastern Archaeology in 1949 and retired in 1988; in 1972 she was appointed to the Leslie Clark Chair in the Humanities. The same year she was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. From 1950 until 1965 she was involved in the excavations at Gordium, Turkey, together with Rodney Young of the University of Pennsylvania. Mellink's most well-known work focused on the site of Karatas-Semayük in the Elmali plain in Lycia where she explored Early Bronze Age remains and tombs.
