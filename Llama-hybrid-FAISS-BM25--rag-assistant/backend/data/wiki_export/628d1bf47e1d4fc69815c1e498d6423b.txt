Vietnam War; Medal of Honor action 

On the evening of June 13, 1966, Howard and his platoon of 15 Marines along with two Navy corpsmen were dropped behind enemy lines atop Hill 488. The mission of this reconnaissance unit was to observe enemy troop movements in the valley and call in air and artillery strikes. Within days, the enemy descended on them in force; on the night of June 15, 1966, a full battalion of Viet Cong (over 300 men) engaged the squad of 18. After receiving severe wounds from an enemy grenade, Howard distributed ammunition to his men and directed air strikes on the enemy. By dawn, his beleaguered platoon still held their position. During the 12 hours of combat, 200 enemy troops were killed as against the loss of six American lives.

In addition to receiving the Medal of Honor for his actions on Hill 488, Howard received a gold star in lieu of a third Purple Heart for wounds received on June 16, 1966. Members of Howard's platoon were decorated for their actions in this fight with four Navy Crosses and thirteen Silver Stars.

Medal of Honor citation 
The President of the United States in the name of The Congress takes pleasure in presenting the MEDAL OF HONOR to

for service as set forth in the following CITATION:

For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty as a Platoon Leader, Company "C", First Reconnaissance Battalion, First Marine Division (Reinforced), Fleet Marine Force, Pacific, in action against communist insurgent forces in Quang Tin Province, Republic of Vietnam, on 16 June 1966. During the night Gunnery Sergeant (then Staff Sergeant) Howard's platoon of eighteen men was assaulted by a numerically superior force consisting of a well-trained North Vietnamese Battalion employing heavy small arms fire, automatic weapons and accurate weapon fire. Without hesitation he immediately organized his platoon to personally supervise the precarious defense of Hill 488. Utterly oblivious to the unrelenting fury of hostile enemy weapons fire and hand grenades he repeatedly exposed himself to enemy fire while directing the operation of his small force. As the enemy attack progressed and the enemy fire increased in volume and accuracy and despite his mounting casualties, Gunnery Sergeant Howard continued to set an example of calmness and courage. Moving from position to position, he inspired his men with dynamic leadership and courageous fighting spirit until he was struck and painfully wounded by fragments from an enemy hand grenade. Unable to move his legs and realizing that the position was becoming untenable, he distributed his ammunition to the remaining members of his platoon and skillfully directed friendly aircraft and artillery strikes with uncanny accuracy upon the enemy. Dawn found the beleaguered force diminished by five killed and all but one wounded. When rescue helicopters proceeded to Gunnery Sergeant Howard's position, he directed them away from his badly mauled force and called additional air strikes and directed devastating small arms fire on the enemy thus making the landing zone secure as possible. His valiant leadership and courageous fighting spirit served to inspire the men of his platoon to heroic endeavor in the face of overwhelming odds, and reflected the highest credit upon Gunnery Sergeant Howard, the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service.

Silver Star citation
Citation:

The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Corporal Jimmie Earl Howard (MCSN: 1130610), United States Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity while attached to the 4.2" Mortar Company, First Marines, FIRST Marine Division (Reinforced), and serving as a Forward Observer of a rifle company in action against enemy aggressor forces in Korea from 12 to 15 August 1952. During the defense of an important hill position, Corporal Howard called in and directed effective fire for friendly mortar and artillery positions, materially strengthening the defense of the position. Although occupied with the duties of forward observer, he participated in deadly hand to hand combat with the enemy to maintain his forward observation post and, although subsequently relieved for rest, sided in evacuating the wounded and in carrying vitally needed supplies to his comrades. Later, although knocked unconscious by the concussion from an enemy mortar shell, he recovered sufficiently to continue to perform his duties and, after being felled again by another mortar shell was evacuated on account of the severity of his condition. By his outstanding courage, initiative and unyielding devotion to duty, Corporal Howard served to inspire all who observed him and upheld the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.
