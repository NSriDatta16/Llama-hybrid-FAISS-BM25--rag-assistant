Luis Alejandro Giampietri Rojas (31 December 1940 – 4 October 2023) was a Peruvian politician belonging to the Peruvian Aprista Party and an admiral of the Peruvian Navy. Giampietri ran successfully as Alan García's first running mate in the 2006 general election, and was sworn in on 28 July 2006 and served until 28 July 2011. He was also elected as Congressman representing the Constitutional Province of Callao for the 2006–2011 term. He lost his seat in the 2011 elections when he ran for re-election under the Radical Change party, but he received a minority of votes and the Radical Change failed to pass the electoral threshold and subsequently lost its registration the following year. Before he served as Vice President and Congressman, Giampietri was a Lima City Councilman from 1999 to 2002, elected under the Fujimorist Vamos Vecino, close to-then President Alberto Fujimori.

Giampietri was one of the naval officers implicated in the massacre on El Frontón, a prison island off the coast of Callao.  The massacre took place during Alan García's administration, on 18 June 1986, after Shining Path prisoners staged an uprising at El Frontón and two other prisons.  All the prisoners involved in the rebellion were killed, and Human Rights Watch claimed that evidence suggested that "no fewer than ninety" of the prisoners killed were victims of extrajudicial executions.
