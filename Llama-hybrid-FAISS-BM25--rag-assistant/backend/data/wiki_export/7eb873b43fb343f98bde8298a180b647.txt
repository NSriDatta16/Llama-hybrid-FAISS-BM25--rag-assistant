History

Pompano Beach Airport was constructed during World War II as an Naval outlying landing field (NOLF) for Naval Air Station Fort Lauderdale, what is now the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. On August 29, 1947, the City of Pompano Beach obtained the Airport under the Surplus Property Act of 1944 and renamed it Pompano Beach Air Park, due to its intent to limit the airport's usage to general aviation. For the same reason, the City shortened Runway 15–33 from its original length of  to its current length of  in 1971.

Additional lands surrounding the air park, including land along Copans Road and the Florida East Coast Railway tracks to the west of the air park, were transferred to the City on June 24, 1948, bringing the total acreage at the air park to . On August 5, 1958,  of air park property were released to the Broward County School Board for the construction of Pompano Beach Elementary School. The County received 9 more acres on September 18, 1967. On March 8, 1958, the City sold , located in the northeast corner of the air park property, for development of the Pompano Square Mall. The final transfer of air park property occurred in 1981 when  in the southwestern section of the air park property were purchased by the Pompano Elks Club. These transfers account for the current total  of the air park.

The Surplus Property Act of 1944 states that any lands conveyed under the act must be used for aviation purposes or ownership reverts to the FAA. The FAA can, however, release excess portions of the property for non-aviation purposes, and any proceeds from the sale of excess property must be used to support airport growth and development under the stipulations of the Surplus Property Act.
