Seaquam Secondary  is a public high school serving the affluent Sunshine Hills and Sunshine Woods neighbourhoods in Delta, British Columbia. Seaquam has remained a top rated high school in British Columbia since its opening in 1977, many years ranking in the top 10 and top 20. The Fraser Institute listed Seaquam Secondary as the highest ranked public school in British Columbia in 2018, coming in 20th overall with independent schools taking the first 19 spots.

The school name was decided by a contest in which students and members of the community participated. The Board of School Trustees chose "Seaquam" in the end, which means or 'sunshine' in the Musqueam language.

The school opened on September 6, 1977, with 37 staff members and 633 students in grades 7 to 11. The number of staff was increased to 41 when one hundred more students enrolled than expected. Since then, grade 12 was added and grade 7 was dropped to meet the present 8-12 standard for high schools. A few of the original teaching staff still remain teaching in Seaquam.
