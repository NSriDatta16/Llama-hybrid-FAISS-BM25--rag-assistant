Airport station was a TransLink public transit exchange on Sea Island, Richmond, in Metro Vancouver. Most bus operations using the location ceased September 7, 2009, two and a half weeks after the opening of the Canada Line, when the exchange downgraded to a regular bus stop.

Overview

On September 4, 2000, the 98 B-Line commenced an introductory service phase that connected Downtown Vancouver with a temporary terminus on Aylmer Road, opposite the Park & Fly lot for Vancouver International Airport (YVR). On December 18, 2000, the permanent terminus opened at the foot of the Moray Bridge near the intersection of Russ Baker Way and Miller Road. A bus-only on-ramp to the bridge served this location.

In August 2001, the 98 B-Line service extended to central Richmond. From October 2001, the exchange was the transfer point for the 424 Airport / Airport station connection, which became the only daytime and evening route to the Vancouver International Airport's main terminal. The N10 route covered this destination outside of those hours.

Airport station also served community shuttles for Sea Island North, nearby Burkeville, and the south terminal of the Vancouver International Airport, which handles local and smaller airlines.

After the opening of the SkyTrain's Canada Line on September 7, 2009, most bus routes serving the exchange were discontinued or terminated at Richmond–Brighouse station, Bridgeport station or Marpole Loop.
