António Manuel Mateus Antunes (born 30 December, 1963), known professionally as Tony Carreira, is a Portuguese singer and musician. Born in the small rural locality of Armadouro, Pampilhosa da Serra, he moved to Paris at age 10 with his emigrant parents. He lived there for 20 years. Carreira has had several hits since 1991, becoming during the 2000s one of the most renowned and best-selling popular singers in his home country. Tony Carreira has performed sold out concerts in one of the largest venues in Portugal, the Pavilhão Atlântico in Lisbon, and also at the Olympia in Paris. His successful career largely overshadowed and was not affected at all by the fact that in the late 2010s he was involved in the most controversial plagiarism case in the Portuguese music scene ever.

O Homem Que Sou has been certified seven times platinum in Portugal. Up to 2009, he sold over 700,000 records in Portugal.

Nos fiançailles France/Portugal, released in February 2014, includes duets with several French artists such as Natasha St-Pier, Vincent Niclo, Gérard Lenorman, Michel Sardou, Dany Brillant, Serge Lama, Anggun, Didier Barbelivien, Lisa Angell and Hélène Ségara.

The album Sempre  was released in 2014.

His most recent album, Mon Fado, was released in 2016.

Tony Carreira is the father of three children: Sara Carreira, a TV personality and singer, killed in a car crash on December 5, 2020, and the pop singers David Carreira and Mickael Carreira.

Plagiarism controversy
In August 2008, the Portuguese Society of Authors (SPA) announced that it had received several complaints about possible plagiarism by Tony Carreira. The complaints related to three songs: "Depois de Ti (Mais Nada)", "Ai Destino, Ai Destino" and "Leva-me ao Céu". SPA concluded that the song "Depois de Ti (Mais Nada)", is an apparent unauthorized copy of the song "Después de Ti...¿Qué?", composed by Rudy Pérez and first performed by José Feliciano. No action was taken however because SPA had not received an official complaint from the rights owners, who were represented by Universal Music Publishing. According to Universal Music the matter was "under investigation". In 2017, Tony Carreira was formally accused of plagiarism by the Portuguese Public Prosecution Service.
