Engineering College Magazines Associated (ECMA) is a professional association of student engineering publications at colleges and universities in the United States.

History
ECMA was founded in 1920 by W.B. Littell, who worked for the New York City advertising firm Littell-Murray-Barnhill.

According to the American Society for Engineering Education's Prism Magazine, "ECMA was created in the 1920s to be a single interface for companies wanting to recruit engineering graduates through ads in the magazines published by engineering colleges." There are records of ECMA member publications meeting for conferences as early as 1923.

ECMA today 
Over the years, ECMA has evolved into more of a professional society, recognizing student engineering publications and allowing students’ access to many top workers in the publication industry, as well as the knowledge they possess. Every year, one school hosts the ECMA conference.
