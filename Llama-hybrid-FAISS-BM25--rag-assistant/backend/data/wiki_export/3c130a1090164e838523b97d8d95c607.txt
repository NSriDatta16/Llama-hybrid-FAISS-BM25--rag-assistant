Tío Pepe (in Spanish, "Uncle Pepe", named after one of the founders' uncles) is a brand of Sherry.  It is best known for its fino style of dry sherry made from the palomino grape. The Tío Pepe brand is owned by the González Byass Sherry house.

Tío Pepe 
Tío Pepe has based its success on promoting itself as a very dry white wine to be served with food, in doing so aiming to differentiate itself from poor quality sherries and their downmarket reputation. The Tío Pepe soleras were established in 1844 and have run uninterrupted since that time.
