Don Bosco High School is a Roman Catholic all-male school in Matunga, Mumbai, India. It has a subsidiary which was built in 1970 in Borivali.

History 
In 1937, the general council of Salesians of Don Bosco approved a plan to buy 60,000 square yards (50,000 m2) land in Matunga from the Bombay Municipal Corporation. The Corporation approved the sale on 16 July 1937. The Don Bosco High School (formerly known as The Catholic Educational Institute) run by them was moved from the rented premises at Tardeo to the new Don Bosco campus at Matunga.

Fr. Aurelius Maschio was the main pillar behind the creation of the school. The land brought from the Bombay Municipal Corporation was marshland which was filled with debris to be able to build the school which started off at a partially completed building on 31 October 1941 and later officially inaugurated on the 31 January 1942. This building still serves as the Main/Secondary section of the school.

The foundation stone of the primary section building was blessed and laid on the feast of Don Bosco 31 January 1950. The building was completed in time for the new school year of June 1951. The architect were the famous and well renowned Patki and Dadarkar. All stained glass were imported from Italy. The then Pope, Pius XII had come for the opening.

The Shrine of Don Bosco's Madonna, which is located in the school campus at Matunga, was opened on 5 August 1957. The church is credited as being one of the architectural high points of the suburb.

The syllabus is in accordance with the Maharashtra Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education. The school offers kindergarten (junior and senior) to Standard 10.

Annual events 
The school organizes a Sports Fest where students participate in games and athletic events. It is a two-day-long festival. 

The annual Care n Share' Christmas Panorama is organized with a theme. Themes like Gujarat Earth Quake were taken up and the school contributed to these causes. The Panorama is organized along with a funfair where games are organized by the students. Tokens for these games come at a meagre cost and the amount collected is added to the bounty of the cause along with the sponsorships generated by the students.

The Annual Thanksgiving Day is another opportunity for the students to show-case their talents. The school organizes a show every year, most often a Westend-Broadway musical. The shows are staged over two or three days with the final day being the official Annual Day where deserving students and members of the staff are felicitated.

Emblem 

The school has the motto  - which is in the Latin language. Virtute is a noun associated with meanings like - virtue, strength, bravery, manliness, character, excellence. Robur is a Latin word  meaning oak, figuratively perhaps indicating strength. The motto can be probably roughly translated as "In virtue lies strength." This meaning can be also inferred by comparing a similar motto from the New Zealand defence force. The school colours are blue and white.
