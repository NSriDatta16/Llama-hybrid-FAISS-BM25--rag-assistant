Shelton Jones (born April 4, 1966) is an American former professional basketball player who played collegiately at St. John's University. He was selected by the San Antonio Spurs in the second round (27th pick overall) of the 1988 NBA draft. Shelton played only one year in the NBA, during the 1988â€“89 season. He split the year between the Spurs, the Golden State Warriors, and the Philadelphia 76ers, for whom he also appeared in the NBA Slam Dunk Contest, finishing in 4th place after advancing to the semi-finals. After the season, he was selected by the Minnesota Timberwolves as the 16th pick in the 1989 NBA expansion draft. After his selection, he said: "I'm a little stunned right now. I thought I'd be taken by Orlando because I'd heard some things. Things like this happen. That's the kind of year I had. I'll make the best of the situation. I look forward to getting out there and meeting with the coach. I don't even know who it is.". As it turned out, the Timberwolves waived him before the season began, and he never played in the NBA again, although he did have a long career playing in various other leagues.

After his playing career, Jones founded the Shelton Jones Foundation, which "trains and mentors student-athletes to become successful in life through sports, community outreach and personal development".
