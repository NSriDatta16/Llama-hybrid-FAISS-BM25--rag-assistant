Carl Dennis Campbell Sr. (July 28, 1935 – November 12, 1997) was an American professional wrestler better known by his ring name Luke "Big Boy" Brown. He is most noted for being one-half of a tag team in the 1950s and 1960s known as the Kentuckians, along with Grizzly Smith.

Professional wrestling career
Brown began his professional wrestling career in 1958, traveling with carnivals. Wrestler Frankie Townsend gave him the name "Man Mountain Campbell", which Brown used up until 1961. For a short period during this time he tagged with Stan Stasiak, and they were the first tag team to ever hold the NWA International Tag Team Championship (Toronto version). They defeated Ivan and Karol Kalmikoff on June 8, 1961 in a tournament to win this title.

In 1961, Brown also began teaming with Grizzly Smith. The duo became known as The Kentuckians, and they were known for their long beards, dungarees, and cow horn.

Brown, as Man Mountain Campbell, had his first main event match on April 12, 1960 against Hans Schmidt in Minneapolis, Minnesota. His first match in Madison Square Gardens took place November 13, 1960 in a tag team match with Haystacks Calhoun against The Kangaroos.

He retired from professional wrestling in 1977 after a shoulder injury.

Personal life
Brown was married three times.

He was in poor health during his last years of life, including kidney failure that required him to undergo dialysis. He died of a stroke in a Washington, D.C. hospital in 1997. He was buried in Elkton, Maryland.
