The gym was 16ft high, and had 2,800 sq ft, with mahogany herringbone sprung flooring.The assembly hall and dining room were combined, with the kitchens at the back of the hall; it was served around 200 meals a day. The practical handicraft room was joined to the main building with a concrete archway - it taught wood and forge work, metal turning and lathe operating.

History

Secondary modern school
Deepings County Secondary Modern opened on Tuesday 9 September 1958 with 247 pupils. It was opened by Kesteven Education Authority, based in Sleaford. It cost Â£100,000, and it was hoped to have around 300 boys and girls. The headmaster was Mr E Lamb. It was co-educational, which was Kesteven's policy. It took in those from Market Deeping, West Deeping, Deeping St James, Langtoft, Baston and Greatford.

Comprehensive
It became a comprehensive school from September 1972 with around 450 pupils. The Design Centre started construction in July 1973, to be completed by March 1974 and open by September 1974; it was a two-storey building, with two science laboratories and a staffroom, in preparation for a comprehensive intake.

The headteacher from Easter 1972, 44-year-old John Sweet, lived in Uffington; he had taken over from Jack Lamb, and had been the deputy headteacher since 1964; John Sweet was previously head of English at a school in Devon, and was from South Wales. John Sweet died on 2 October 1974 in a car accident.

Academy
The school converted to academy status on 1 February 2012.

Buildings
Admissions rose to 360, with the addition of a rural science block, built away from the main building, to teach soil study and vegetable growing, and greenhouse cultivation.

In 1990 a new library and sixth form centre was built, opened in 1991.  A language and mathematics block was built in 1997, and a drama studio in 1998.

In 2005 a Business and Enterprise block was built. A new staff room was built, and in 2011 a new school reception, sixth-form facilities, and conference centre were completed. A new sixth form block was completed in 2013.

In 2015 a new science centre was built after the original science classrooms were knocked down.
In 2020, a new block, designed to be a replacement Art and Design department after the previous Business and Enterprise block was knocked down, was constructed. When students returned to school following the first national lockdown, final-year secondary students were allocated this block to have all of their lessons in. In 2022, this was later changed to function as its intended purpose.
In 2022, a new sports hall was erected after the Deepings Leisure Centre closed down.
