"Hjálpum þeim" (Icelandic for Let’s Help Them) is a song recorded in 1985 by several of the most popular musicians of Iceland to gather funds in order to combat poverty in Africa.
"Hjálpum þeim" contained only the title song and it was rerecorded again in 2005 under the name of "Hjálpum þeim 2005", and then again in English in 2011 under the name "Help Them 2011" because of the crisis in Eastern Africa.
