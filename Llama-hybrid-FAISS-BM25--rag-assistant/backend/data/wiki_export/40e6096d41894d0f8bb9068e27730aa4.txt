New Faces was an Australian talent show that preceded the British show of the same name, produced at GTV-9 Melbourne. The program began in 1963 under the name Kevin Dennis Auditions, sponsored by a new car dealership, Kevin Dennis Motors, which was run by Kevin Dennis (Dennis Gowing), who was also a well-known face on Australian TV from his catchy 'Update' TV Commercials in the 1960sâ€“70s, which were featured during the breaks of the popular show. The program ran on Saturday mornings. The program name soon changed to Kevin Dennis New Faces, and later simply New Faces, becoming a Sunday night primetime show.

The program began as a vehicle for rags-to-riches Melbourne businessman Kevin Dennis to promote his business. Australian journalist Derryn Hinch, in remembering Kevin Dennis, said:
