Back to the Blues is the thirteenth solo studio album by Northern Irish guitarist Gary Moore, released in 2001. As implied by its title, it saw Moore return to the electric blues music with which he had found fame since 1990, after two more experimental albums. It was also Moore's first album to feature Darrin Mooney on drums; Mooney would go on to fill the drumming spot on Moore's next two studio albums, as well as his short-lived Scars project and several live albums.

All tracks from this album were re-released on the multi-disc compilation, "Blues and Beyond" in 2017.
