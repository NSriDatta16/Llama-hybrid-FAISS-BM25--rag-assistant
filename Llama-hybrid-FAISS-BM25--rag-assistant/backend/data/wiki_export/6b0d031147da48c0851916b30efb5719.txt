Mosfilmovskaya Street (, romanised: Mosfílmovskaya úlitsa), formerly also Potylikha Street (), is a street in Ramenki District, West Administrative District, Moscow, where the Mosfilm Studios and many foreign embassies are located.

The name Mosfilmovskaya was officially adopted in 1939. Being outside the Garden Ring (Садовое Кольцо), which encircles central Moscow, the street runs south-west across a residential area between the Moskva River and its tributary Setun River (Сетунь). Moscow's Sparrow Hills (known as Lenin Hills during the Soviet era) are quite close here.

Around the 17th century the area was known as the estate of Troitskoye-Golenishchevo (another name being Golenishchevo-Kutuzovo), a country seat of the Kutuzov family, whose prominent descendant, Russian field marshal Mikhail Illarionovich Kutuzov (1745-1813) fought Napoleon I of France during Patriotic War of 1812. A major landmark surviving from that time is the Trinity Church (1644–45).
