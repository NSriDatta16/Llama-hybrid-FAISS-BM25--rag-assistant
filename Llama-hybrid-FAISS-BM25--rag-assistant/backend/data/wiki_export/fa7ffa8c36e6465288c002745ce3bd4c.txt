The Frankford Slasher is the name given by the media to a possible serial killer who operated in and around the neighborhood of Frankford in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania from 1985 to 1990. Leonard Christopher was convicted in the murder of one of the nine supposedly linked victims, but the others remain unsolved. All of the victims were sexually assaulted and stabbed to death. Several of the victims were seen with a middle-aged white man shortly before their murders.

Leonard Christopher
During the investigation into the death of Carol Dowd, Leonard Christopher, an employee at a nearby fish market, became a suspect. Despite the fact that he did not match the witness's description of Dowd being seen with a middle-aged white man before her death, and that there was no evidence to link him to any of the other eight murders, and only circumstantial evidence linking him to Dowd's murder, he was tried and convicted of one count of first degree murder on December 12, 1990, and sentenced to life in prison. He has since died of cancer, maintaining his innocence since the beginning. 

Also noteworthy is the fact that a ninth victim, Michelle Dehner, was stabbed to death in the same fashion as the other women while Christopher was being held without bail on his murder charge. However, Dehner's murder was ruled a "copycat killing" by detectives.
