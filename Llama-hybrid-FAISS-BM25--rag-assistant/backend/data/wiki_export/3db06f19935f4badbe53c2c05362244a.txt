Speechless is a 1994 American romantic comedy film directed by Ron Underwood. It stars Michael Keaton, Geena Davis (who also co-produced with her then-husband, director Renny Harlin), Bonnie Bedelia, Ernie Hudson, and Christopher Reeve.

Plot
After meeting each other for the first time in the gift shop of the Las Cruces, New Mexico hotel where they are both staying, insomniac writers Julia Mann and Kevin Vallick fight over the last box of sleep medicine.

Initially, they do not realise both are speechwriters for rival candidates in a New Mexico Senate election, so they both fall in love. Julia works for Democratic candidate Lloyd Wannamaker and Kevin for Republican candidate Ray Garvin. Inadvertently influencing each other's work, they discover each other's jobs when they are both invited to speak in a school. Both shocked, end up attacking one another verbally on stage. Later, in their campaign speeches they continue to argue, unbeknownst to everyone else. Their romance causes great confusion, as they have to decide if love and politics can mix.

Also complicating matters are, amongst other things, Kevin's cutthroat ex-wife Annette, who got Kevin the job on the Republican's campaign trail. Also Julia's estranged fiancé, "Mr. Flak Jacket," television war correspondent Robert "Baghdad Bob" Freed turns up and wants her back. She had broken off the engagement, as she believed he wanted a cheering section more than he wanted a wife.

Julia's organizer accidentally falls into Kevin's hands, and he hacks into her candidate's speech, making Wannamaker sound foolish. Then, Julia's team meets with his in his offices. He doesn't attend, but meets with her that night, where she tells him she's engaged again and he warns her she's getting fired. She takes advice from him to make her candidate more loved by the people by having him help rescue the missing bear cub, who's been dominating the news. This gives her a promotion to press secretary.

At the televised debates, Julia breaks off the engagement, and immediately after Kevin tells her he's crazy for her. They sneak off, spending the night together. The next morning at dawn, Annette shows up, tasking him to write a campaign ad. Not able to wake him, Julia writes a sitcom-style ad.

The next morning, Kevin chews Julia out because he thinks she leaked financial info to the press, not thanking her for the successful ad. Later on, one of her staff tells Kevin that both of their candidates took bribes, Proctor is responsible for both bribes, but has chosen Wannamaker. She is told by a workmate, as they approach the stage in victory.

Kevin arrives, interrupting Wannamaker's victory speech, to declare his love, swooping down into her arms. The film closes with a news report given by Bob of Julia's late entry into a senatorial race, with Kevin as campaign manager.

Context
The film was widely interpreted as an imitation of the contemporaneous, real-life romance of rival political consultants James Carville (key advisor to the first presidential campaign of Bill Clinton), and Mary Matalin (speechwriter for President George H. W. Bush).

However, co-lead actor Michael Keaton reported that the script had been developed before Carville and Matalin had ever met—though Keaton did admit to viewing The War Room, a documentary about Carville's work, to prepare himself for the film. Keaton came on board after dropping out of Batman Forever.

Gene Siskel, gave the film 1 out 4 and was critical of the lack of chemistry between the leads and the script, writing: "This script needed to be completely overhauled before filming began."

Brian Lowry of Variety wrote: "Never achieves the madcap hilarity of the '40s romantic comedies it seeks to emulate, and some of the dramatic moments feel a bit forced."
