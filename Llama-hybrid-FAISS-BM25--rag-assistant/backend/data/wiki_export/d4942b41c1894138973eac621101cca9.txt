Clinton John Whitelaw (born 24 December 1970) is a South African professional golfer.

Early life 
Whitelaw was born in Johannesburg.

Professional career 
In 1990, he turned professional. Whitelaw has competed predominantly on the Southern Africa-based Sunshine Tour since then, where he has won three tournaments, including the 1993 Philips South African Open. He also played on the Canadian Tour during his early career.

Whitelaw played on the European Tour the late 1990s, having won his card at the qualifying school at the end of 1996. He won the 1997 Moroccan Open, and went on to finish 54th on the Order of Merit that season. However he was unable to repeat that performance in the following seasons due to a recurring lumbar spine injury.

In 2000, Whitelaw effectively retired from tournament golf, playing only a few events on the Sunshine Tour each year through 2011. He is now an instructor and works as a head teaching professional in Sarasota, Florida.
