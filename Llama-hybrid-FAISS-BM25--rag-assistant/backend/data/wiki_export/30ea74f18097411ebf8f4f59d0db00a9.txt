1 Corinthians 13 is the thirteenth chapter of the First Epistle to the Corinthians in the New Testament of the Christian Bible. It is authored by Paul the Apostle and Sosthenes in Ephesus. This chapter covers the subject of love. In the original Greek, the word  is used throughout the chapter. This is translated into English as "charity" in the King James version; but the word "love" is preferred by most other translations, both earlier and more recent.

Text
The original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 13 verses.

Agape 

Chapter 13 of 1 Corinthians is one of many definitional sources for the word  when used to refer to divine love. Introducing his homage to love in 1 Corinthians 12:31, Paul describes  as "a more excellent way".

"Through a glass, darkly"
1 Corinthians 13:12 contains the phrase , which was translated in the 1560 Geneva Bible as "For now we see through a glass darkly" (without a comma). This wording was used in the 1611 KJV, which added a comma before "darkly". This passage has inspired the titles of many works, with and without the comma.

The Greek word  (genitive; nominative: ), here translated "glass", is ambiguous, possibly referring to a mirror or a lens. Influenced by Strong's Concordance, many modern translations conclude that this word refers specifically to a mirror. Example English language translations include:

 "Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror" (New International Version)
 "What we see now is like a dim image in a mirror" (Good News Bible)

Paul's usage is in keeping with rabbinic use of the term , a borrowing from the Latin . This has the same ambiguous meaning, although Adam Clarke concluded that it was a reference to , clear polished stones used as lenses or windows. One way to preserve this ambiguity is to use the English cognate, speculum. Rabbi Judah ben Ilai (2nd century) was quoted as saying "All the prophets had a vision of God as He appeared through nine specula" while "Moses saw God through one speculum." The Babylonian Talmud states similarly "All the prophets gazed through a speculum that does not shine, while Moses our teacher gazed through a speculum that shines."
