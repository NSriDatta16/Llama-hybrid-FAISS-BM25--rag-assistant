The Municipality of Loški Potok (; ) is a municipality in southern Slovenia. It is part of the traditional region of Lower Carniola and is now included in the Southeast Slovenia Statistical Region. The municipal administration is based in the settlement of Hrib–Loški Potok. Traditionally forestry provided the main income for local inhabitants and it still plays an important role.

Name
The name Loški Potok was originally a hydronym, derived from the adjective form of log '(swampy) meadow' + potok 'stream', thus literally meaning 'stream in a (swampy) meadow'. This probably refers to the level area south of Travnik, where there is a creek with the same name. The name was attested in written sources as Laserbach, Loserbach, and Lasserbach in 1763–1787. In the past, the German equivalent of the name was Laserbach. The surrounding Potok Plateau () is also named after Loški potok.
