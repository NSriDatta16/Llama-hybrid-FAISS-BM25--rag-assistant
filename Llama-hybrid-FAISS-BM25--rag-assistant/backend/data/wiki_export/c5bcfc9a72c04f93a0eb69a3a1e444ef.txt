"Un Poco de Tu Amor" is a song by Mexican pop group RBD, released as the fourth single from their debut album Rebelde (2004), only in Mexico. The song became the group's fourth hit in the country.

Background and release 
"Un Poco de Tu Amor" was meant to be the album's second single, but was replaced by "Solo Quédate En Silencio" due to its radio airplay and marketing. Due to this, "Un Poco de Tu Amor" became their first to be a radio-only single.

The song has a version in Portuguese called "Um Pouco Desse Amor" (Spa. "Un Poco de Este Amor", Eng: "A Little Bit of This Love"), released in the Portuguese edition of their debut album. The song was also performed three times throughtout the telenovela Rebelde, where the group are the six young lead actors.

The track notably features the vocals of singer Lynda Thomas during its chorus. Thomas would be a key voice in the group's career, recording choruses and backing vocals for their Spanish and English albums.

Composition and lyrics 
The song was written by DJ Kafka and Max di Carlo, and produced by the latter alongside Armando Ávila, Carlos Lara, and the show's executive producer Pedro Damián. It belongs to the pop rock and Latin pop genres, and has a duration of three minutes and 24 seconds. It contains the verse-refrain-pre-chorus-chorus structure and lyrically finds the group asking a person to notice them and their love for that person.

Christian takes both verses; in the first he acknowledges that he's "one more friend among the bunch" ("Un amigo más, entre el montón"), and that he's "a fan at heart, that doesn't stop dreaming about" the other person ("...un fan de corazón, que no te para de soñar"). In the second verse, he asks his crush to "give [him] a sign, one minute to talk" ("dame una señal, un minuto para conversar").

During the refrain, Anahí is more hopeful, singing: "Pero sé también, que entre la multitud alguna vez, pudieras ver la luz sobre mi piel" ("But I also know, that among the crowd sometime, you would see the light on my skin").

On the pre-chorus, Alfonso claims: "Yo necesito de ti como el aire, nadie te puede querer tanto así" ("I need you like the air, no one can love you like this").

During the chorus, Christian and Lynda Thomas ask for "Un poco de tu amor para poder vivir, un poco de tu amor me puede hacer feliz, solo un poco de tu amor es lo que pido" ("A little bit of your love to be able to live, a little bit of your love can make me happy, just a little bit of your love is what I ask for").
