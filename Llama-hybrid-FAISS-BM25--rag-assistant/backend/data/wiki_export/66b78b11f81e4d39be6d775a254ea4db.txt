Under the Couch (UTC) is a currently displaced live music venue, recording studio, and lounge formerly located in the Student Center at the Georgia Institute of Technology, in Atlanta, Georgia.  Under the Couch is run by the Musician's Network (MN), a Tier II Georgia Tech student organization. Musician's Network meetings are held at 7pm every Monday night during regular school semesters in Under the Couch and are open to all Georgia Tech students and alumni.

History
Under the Couch, originally established by the Georgia Tech Musician's Network in 1995, was previously located underneath the Couch Band Building on West Campus. In the fall of 2010, UTC moved to a new location on the second floor of the student center, replacing the Music Listening Room and continuing the daytime use of the room for similar activities. However, with the demolition of the original Wenn Student Center in the fall of 2020, Under the Couch is currently displaced, and current plans for the student center renovation do not allocate any space for the venue.  GT student Charlie McCann came up with the name Under the Couch while brainstorming a long list of possible names for the venue.  Charlie was the roommate and bandmate of UTC founder Randy McDow.
