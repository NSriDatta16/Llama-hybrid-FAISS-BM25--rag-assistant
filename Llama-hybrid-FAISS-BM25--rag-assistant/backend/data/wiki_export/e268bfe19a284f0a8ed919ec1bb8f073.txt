Habitat
Jirds inhabit desert and barren areas preferring firm soil. They are not to be found in pure sand dunes or rocky outcrops.

Difference between 'jirds' and 'gerbils'
Jirds are closely related to gerbils but can be distinguished by the lack of long hind feet and the characteristic erect posture of a gerbil. The tail of a jird is generally shorter than the head and body. It also has much shorter ears. In addition, the Indian desert jird is diurnal, in comparison to the three common gerbil species found in India which are nocturnal.
