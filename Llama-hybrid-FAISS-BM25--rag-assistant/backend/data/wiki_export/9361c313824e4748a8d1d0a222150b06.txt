Club career

Sheffield United
Quinn started his career at Sheffield United, breaking into their first team in 1997.

Newcastle United
In 2001 Quinn was loaned to Newcastle United, who later purchased him for £800,000. After a difficult time at the club, scoring once against Lokeren in the Intertoto Cup, he was loaned back out to Sheffield United, and then West Ham United before being released on a free transfer in 2004.

Non-league
After Quinn left West Ham United at the age of 28, he did not signed for another professional club. It was reported in the Plymouth Evening Herald that Quinn was offered a trial by English Championship club Plymouth Argyle but declined the opportunity, preferring to play amateur football in Cornwall because of a bad injury which led to surgery.

Quinn played for and managed Penzance along with Gary Marks, and in April 2012 he transferred to Falmouth Town, making his first appearance at centre back in a 1–1 draw at home to Elburton Villa.

He was appointed player-manager of South Western Premier League Division One West club Mousehole in 2013. 

Quinn left Mousehole in 2016 after stepping down from his first team coach role.

International career
Quinn played for England's Under 21 team. He also played for England B in 1998, a result which was a 4–1 England win.
