The nearest cities and towns adjoining Old Oyo National Park include Saki, Iseyin, Igboho, Sepeteri, Tede, Kishi, and Igbeti, which have their own commercial and cultural attractions for tourism.

History
The park takes its name from Oyo-lle (Old Oyo), the ancient political capital of Oyo Empire of the Yoruba people, and contains the ruins of this city. The national park originated in two earlier native administrative forest reserves, Upper Ogun established in 1936 and Oyo-lle established in 1941. These were converted to game reserves in 1952, then combined and upgraded to the present status of a national park.

By 2022, reporting noted that despite regular tourism tours and protective laws, the park was under threat due to poaching and logging in addition to herder encroachment. Although poaching had decreased from the early 2000s, herding remained a problem with Miyetti Allah organizations agreeing that illegal herding was an important issue facing the park, but claiming many local herders did not know the exact location of the park nor its ecological significance. Additionally, environmentalist Eme Okang explained that climate change also pushed herders south and into the park. The next year, mass arrests of illegal miners and herders in addition to poachers occurred during security drives.
