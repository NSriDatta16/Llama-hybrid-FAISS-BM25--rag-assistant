His son, Ramesh, on the other hand, is in love with a well-educated girl, Dr. Ramola Sharma. Torn between Father and his Love, Ramesh goes to Lalaji, his father's friend for help. Lalaji suggests to  trick Kailash Pati, by portraying Ramola as a daughter of village pundit.

The trio succeed in tricking Kailashpati to believe that Ramola is indeed an innocent girl who does not know English. They are married and then starts a storm of events to live the lie.

Ramola is the dutiful wife and daughter in law much to Kailash Pati's joy who believes that it is all because of her upbringing in a village atmosphere. Ramola is constantly on her nerves and feels guilty of her masquerade.
