History

The settlement of Meziříčí was founded during the colonization of the Oslava valley in the 12th century. The first written credible mention of Meziříčí is from 1281. A counterfeit documented existence of Meziříčí in 1236, however, the estimated foundation of the castle above Meziříčí is actually around 1236 and is on the oldest aristocratic castles in Moravia. The palisade and then the stone walls were built in the 14th century. The Church of Saint Nicholas is first mentioned in 1317. The village was located on crossroards of two trade routes and developed into a town.

The settlement obtained full town privileges in 1408. During the Hussite Wars, Meziříčí was a military base of the Hussites. Around 1434, the castle was fortified. In 1464, the castle was conquered by King George of Poděbrady, and in 1468, the town was ransacked by the army of Matthias Corvinus.

Meziříčí experienced the greatest boom during the Renaissance period. The first Jews came into the town in the late 15th century and the Jewish community was established in the 17th century. The prosperity of the town was interrupted by the Thirty Years' War, during which the town was burned down several times. In the 18th century, the town prospered again.

In the 19th century, first factories were built, and the development of the town's industry was also helped by the construction of the railway.

The Velké Meziříčí Castle is the landmark of the town. The original Romanesque-Gothic castle was rebuilt in the Renaissance style in the 16th century and after a fire in 1723, Baroque reconstruction was made. Today it houses the Velké Meziříčí Museum.
