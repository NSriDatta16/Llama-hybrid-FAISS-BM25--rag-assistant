The Miss Utah USA competition is the pageant who selects the representative for the state of Utah in the Miss USA pageant. From 2001 to 2007, the pageant was produced by Red Curtain Productions. Casting Crowns Productions directed the pageant from 2007 to 2018 under the directorship of former Miss Missouri USA Britt Boyse. Smoak Productions became the new director for Miss and Teen pageants in 2019 under executive director and Miss USA 1995 Shanna Moakler.

Utah has been quite successful at Miss USA, with 20 placements as of 2009.  Their most consistent period was in the 1950s and 1960s.  Utah has produced two Miss USA winners, in 1960 (Linda Bement, who went on to win the Miss Universe 1960 title) and in 2023. Miss Utah USA 1957, Charlotte Sheffield, also won the Miss USA 1957 crown after the original titleholder (Leona Gage of Maryland) was dethroned. Utah has a strong recent record, having placed in four out of five pageants between 2005 and 2009. The most recent placement and win was Venezuelan-American Noelia Voigt in 2023.

Three Miss Utah USAs are former Miss Utah Teen USAs who competed at Miss Teen USA.  All three placed at Miss USA, which eclipsed their Teen performances. They are also very similar to the Miss North Carolina USA titleholders who also placed at Miss USA rather than Miss Teen USA. Two also competed in Miss Utah.

The current titleholder is Noelia Voigt of Park City, who later won the Miss USA 2023 pageant.
