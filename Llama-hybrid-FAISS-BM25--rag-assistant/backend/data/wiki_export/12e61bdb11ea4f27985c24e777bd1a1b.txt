The Abruzzi Glacier () is situated to the north of the Baltoro Kangri peak in Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan. This glacier merges with the Baltoro Glacier, which is one of the largest glaciers outside of the polar regions. Initially, the glacier flows in a northwest direction before veering westward. The Abruzzi Glacier offers magnificent vistas of K2, the highest peak in Pakistan.

The Abruzzi Glacier was named in tribute to Prince Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi, an Italian mountaineer and Arctic explorer. He led an expedition to the Karakoram mountain range in 1909, which included several partial ascents of K2.
