History 

York High School opened in 1954 as the public school for grades 6 through 12 for the white children of York County under the separate but equal system, while the York County Training School in the Grafton area of York County would be used by black students. Before York High School opened, students attended other neighboring high schools: Poquoson, Magruder in Williamsburg, and Morrison in Newport News, later to be known as Warwick High School. Black students in Grades 1 - 12 attended the newly constructed James Weldon Johnson School.  York High School issued its first student yearbook, then titled "The York Bugle," in 1955.

From 1955 to 1970, an avalanche of over 5,000 pupils descended upon the York County school system. This influx was largely due to white flight as families moved from the neighboring cities of Hampton and Newport News to the county following the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision by the US Supreme Court that ordered racial integration of public schools.  Cold War era expansions at military installations and defense industries in the area also brought some families in from out of state. Many changes to the schools came during that period as well. The year 1964 was the last year the school received funds from the district school levy.  As of 1964, racial integration of YCSD schools began and the fall of 1967 marked the end of segregation. The James Weldon Johnson School, built on the same floor plan as YHS under the "separate but equal" emphasis during Segregation, became Yorktown Intermediate School.

Several additions were added to York High School within its first few years as the building would need to provide space for more than a thousand students in grades 6 through 12. As new schools opened, the school's population was reduced to consist of students of grades 9 through 12. The school served the entire county until Tabb High School opened in 1972 and Bruton High School opened in 1976.

Campus

Bailey Field
The athletic field was named in honor of B. Herman Bailey, a locally prominent family physician, who was widely considered to be a hero within the county.  A successful doctor, Dr. Bailey was also an ardent supporter of YHS athletics for many years, providing sports physicals twice a year and was a faithful attendee of YHS football games.  The field is now used by 3 out of the 4 high schools in the county with Tabb High School and Grafton High School also playing their home football games there.

John P. Wornom Auditorium
The Auditorium is named for John P. Wornom, a York County native born in 1909 who owned a successful hardware store and was a long-time member of the York County School Board.  An ardent supporter of childcare and education, Wornom worked to improve teacher pay and benefits, school facilities, and other measures to enhance the academic programs in the school division. He died from Lou Gehrig's disease on September 4, 1978.
