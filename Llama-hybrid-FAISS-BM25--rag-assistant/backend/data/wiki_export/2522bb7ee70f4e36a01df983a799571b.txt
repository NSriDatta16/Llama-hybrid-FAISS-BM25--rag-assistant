The Hudson Hornet is a full-size car manufactured by Hudson Motor Car Company of Detroit, Michigan from 1951 until 1954, when Nash-Kelvinator and Hudson merged to form American Motors Corporation (AMC). Hudson automobiles continued to be marketed under the Hudson brand name through the 1957 model year.

The first-generation Hudson Hornets featured a functional "step-down" design with dropped floor pan and a chassis with a lower center of gravity than contemporary vehicles that helped the car handle well — an advantage for racing. The Hornet's lower and sleeker look was accentuated by streamlined styling, sometimes called "ponton" styling.

Following the merger forming AMC in 1954, Hudson cars were built on the newer factory assembly line for Nash Statesman/Ambassador unibody chassis; therefore, all second-generation Hudson Hornets were restyled Nash automobiles that were badge engineered as a Hudson.

First generation

The Hornet, introduced for the 1951 model year, was based on Hudson's "step-down" design that was first seen in the 1948 model year on the Commodore. Unlike a unibody, the design did not fully merge the body and chassis frame into a single structure, but the floor pan footwells recessed down, in between the car's chassis rails, which were, in turn, routed around them – instead of a conventional floor, sitting on top of straight ladder frame rails – a body on frame design that later became more widely adopted, and known as a perimeter frame. Thus one "stepped down" into a Hudson. The step-down chassis and body meant the car's "lower center of gravity...was both functional and stylish. The car not only handled well, but treated its six passengers to a sumptuous ride. The low-slung look also had a sleekness about it that was accentuated by the nearly enclosed rear wheels."

1951 

Hudson Hornets were available as a two-door coupe, four-door sedan, a convertible, and a pillarless hardtop coupe. The models were priced the same as Commodore Eight, which was priced from US$2,543 to $3,099.

All Hornets from 1951 through 1953 were powered by Hudson's high-compression straight-six "H-145" engine. It was based on Hudson's previous  "Super Six" that was not only bored and stroked to increase displacement, but "thoroughly over-engineered in the Hudson tradition. a high-chromium-alloy block and other premium features." An electric clock was standard.

Starting for the 1952 model year, a factory-optional "Twin H-Power" featured twin one-barrel Carter carburetors with greater throat area and improved fuel distribution. This upgrade was first available in mid-1951 as a dealer-installed option at the cost of $85.60 (~$ in ). At , the L-head (flathead or side-valve) design was the largest displacement six-cylinder engine used in mass-production cars at the time. The two-barrel carburetor version produced  at 3800 rpm and  of torque. 

In 1954, power output was increased from . The engine was also capable of far more power in the hands of precision tuners, including Marshall Teague, who claimed he could get  from an AAA- or NASCAR-certified stock Hornet, as well as Hudson engineers who developed "severe usage" options (thinly disguised racing parts). The combination of the Hudson engine with overall road-ability of the Hornets, plus the fact the cars were over-designed and over-built, made them unbeatable in competition on the dirt and the very few paved tracks of the 1950s.

Hudson Hornet 1951 model year production totaled 43,666 units.

1952 

In 1952 the "Twin H-Power" version became standard equipment with dual single-barrel carburetors atop a dual-intake manifold, and power rose to . The hood featured a functional scoop that ducts cold air to the carburetors and was considered "ventilation" in 1954, rather than ram air. The engine could be tuned to produce  when equipped with the "7-X" modifications that Hudson introduced later. During 1952 and 1953 the Hornet received minor cosmetic enhancements, and still closely resembled the Commodore of 1948.

The Hornet proved to be nearly invincible in stock-car racing. Despite its racing successes, sales began to languish. Hudson's competitors, using separate body-on-frame designs, could change the look of their models on a yearly basis without expensive chassis alterations, whereas the Hornet's modern, sophisticated unibody design was expensive to update, so it was essentially locked in and suffered against the planned obsolescence of the Big Three (Ford, GM and Chrysler) automakers.

A total of 35,921 Hornets were produced for 1952, with approximately 2,160 hardtops and 360 convertibles.

1953 

The 1953 model year brought minor changes to the Hudson Hornet. The front end was modified with a new grille and a non-functional air scoop hood ornament. four different body designs: two-door club coupe, Hollywood hardtop, Convertible Brougham, and a four-door sedan.

Hudson Hornet 1953 model year production totaled 27,208 units of which around 910 were the Hollywood hardtops. An 8-tube radio was a $100 option.

1954 

For the 1954 model year, the Hornet underwent a major square-lined redesign and to match the look of the compact Hudson Jet that was introduced in 1953. This entailed extensive retooling because of the way the step-down frame wrapped around the passenger compartment. The front had a simpler grille that complemented the now-functional hood scoop and a new one-piece curved windshield, while the sides gained period-typical fender chrome accents, and the formerly sloped rear end was squared off. The front to rear fender line was styled to make the car look longer and taillamps were also redesigned. The interior was also updated with a new dash and instrument cluster that were surprisingly modern. An example is a Hornet owner writing for Popular Mechanics in 1999, noting that "the car's unique, low slung appearance and silky handling earned Hudson an image that — for many buyers — eclipsed luxury marques like Cadillac."

Like all previous model years, no V8 engine was available (similar to Chevrolet models from 1918-1954), but the  six-cylinder was standard in Hornets and produced , the racing-inspired  "Twin-H-Power" (dual carburetor) option was popular, and a 7-X version of the engine was offered as a factory option, producing over  using a high compression head, special camshaft, and other "severe usage" parts designed for racing. The  engine produced high torque at low RPMs and had a fairly flat torque curve, which helped the Hornet beat V8s from other makes whose power advantage came only at much higher rpm. The engine was more powerful compared to the contemporary low-priced competition (the Chevrolet I6 and Ford V8) and was close to the V8 engines offered by the medium-priced competition (Oldsmobile and Buick). The Hornet's performance delivered up to  and "quasi-thrifty"  fuel economy.

Although the Hornet's redesign positioned it equally with its contemporaries in terms of looks and style, the redesign came too late to boost sales. The news that Hudson was in financial difficulties and had been essentially taken over by Nash-Kelvinator to form American Motors Corporation during the 1954 model year was known by the car-buying public.

The updated Hornet Brougham convertible, the only open-top body design available from Hudson was attractive, but was considered overpriced at $3,288 (~$ in ) for a six-cylinder car in 1954. This top-line model included hydraulic window lifts and leather upholstery in either blue, maroon, or green and the fabric tops available in either maroon, black, or tan. A total of 540 convertibles were built.

Hudson's board of directors approved a merger with Nash-Kelvinator on 14 January 1954. This was ratified by shareholders on 24 March 1954, thus forming the new American Motors Corporation on 1 May 1954. Further production of Hudson cars was to be in Nash's Kenosha, Wisconsin, with the last Detroit-built Hudson was built on 30 October 1954. 

Hudson Hornet 1954 model year production of all body styles totaled 24,833.

A 1954 Hornet two-door hardtop was customized by Harold Du Charme of Grosse Pointe, Michigan, who was a large stockholder in the automaker. He did not like the redesign of the car and proposed changes to improve Hudson's flagging sales. Changes included a  top chopping and channeling the midsection  as well as repositioned headlamps in an egg-crate grille, twin hood scoops, extended rear fenders with Lincoln taillights, and a continental kit.

NASCAR fame 

Hudson was the first automobile manufacturer to get involved in stock car racing. The Hornet "dominated stock car racing in the early-1950s, when stock car racers actually raced stock cars."

During 1952, Marshall Teague finished the 1952 AAA season with a 1000-point lead over his closest rival, winning 12 of the 13 scheduled events. Hornets driven by NASCAR aces Herb Thomas, Dick Rathmann, Al Keller, Frank Mundy, and Tim Flock won 27 NASCAR races driving for the Hudson team.

In the AAA racing circuit, Teague drove a stock Hornet that he called the Fabulous Hudson Hornet to 14 wins during the season. This brought the Hornet's season record to 40 wins in 48 events, a winning percentage of 83%.

Overall, Hudson won 27 of the 34 NASCAR Grand National races in 1952, followed by 22 wins of 37 in 1953, and captured 17 of the 37 races in 1954 — "an incredible accomplishment, especially from a car that had some legitimate luxury credentials."

The original Fabulous Hudson Hornet can be found today fully restored in Ypsilanti, Michigan at the Ypsilanti Automotive Heritage Museum, a facility that was formerly home to Miller Motors, the last Hudson dealership in the world.

Second generation 

In its final three model years, the Hornet became a product of the newly-formed American Motors Corporation (AMC). Following the 1954 merger of the Hudson Motor Car Company and Nash-Kelvinator, Hudson's Detroit manufacturing facility was closed and the production of Hudson models was shifted to Nash's Wisconsin factory. No longer built on the "Step-down" platform, all Hornets were now based on the senior Nash models, but featuring distinctive Hudson styling themes.

1955 

The 1955 Hudson senior models were built on the Nash platform with styling themes by Pinin Farina, Edmund Anderson, and Frank Spring. The cars featured a front end that was originally designed by Spring and the Hudson stylists for an updated 1955 version of the 1954 Hudson "Step-Down" platform.

The new models were delayed to a January 1955 introduction, "as American Motors engineers work out the problem of making two completely different looking automobiles with identical body shells."

As the first entirely new car from American Motors, the 1955 Hudson emerged conservatively styled compared to the competition. The 1955 Hornet was the cleanest model with a broad egg-crate grille and distinctive two-toning. Sedan and hardtop body styles were offered, but the coupe and convertible were no longer available. The 1955 Hornets shared the styling with the new Wasps, but featured a longer  wheelbase.

The  straight-six engine continued in  or  versions. For the first time, the Hornet could be ordered with a Packard-built  V8 engine producing  and Packard's Ultramatic automatic transmission. The rear suspension now incorporated a torque tube system for the driveshaft and coil spring rear suspension along with front springs that are twice as long as most other cars.

Along with Nash, the new Hudsons had the widest front seats in the industry. Two trim levels were available, Super and Custom, with the Custom series including a continental tire carrier, a  "table-like" center armrest for the rear seat, a padded dashboard, transparent sun visors, and an over the windshield interior package net.

The Weather Eye heating and ventilation with an optional air conditioning system were highly rated in terms of efficiency. The integrated placement of major air conditioning systems under the hood and the price of only $395 (about half the cost as on other cars) also won praise. Automotive journalist Floyd Clymer rated the Hudson Hornet as the safest car built in the United States because of (1) the single unit welded body, (2) high-quality braking system with an added mechanical backup system, (3) roadability, general handling, and maneuverability; as well as (4) excellent acceleration and power for emergency situations.

Marketing efforts included incentives such as the "Dealer Volume Investment Fund" and "Sun Valley Sweepstakes" targeting salespeople as well as a contest for the general public with the possibility of new cars and trips to Disneyland as top prizes. Production for the 1955 model year totaled 10,010 four-door sedans and 3,324 Hollywood two-door hardtops.

1956 

For the 1956 model year, AMC executives decided to give the Hornet more character and the design for the vehicles was given over to designer Richard Arbib, who provided the Hornet and Wasp with one of the more distinctive looks in the 1950s which he called "V-Line Styling". Taking the traditional Hudson tri-angle, Arbib applied its "V" form in every conceivable manner across the interior and exterior of the car. Combined with tri-tone paint combinations, Hudson's look was unique and immediately noticeable.

The legendary  straight-six engine, with and without Twin-H Power, was offered and gained  for 1956. However, Packard's V8 engine was available only during the first half of 1956. In the mid-model year, the Hornet Special was introduced featuring a lower price and AMC's new   V8 engine. The Hornet Special models were built on a  shorter and slightly lighter Statesman/Wasp four-door sedan and two-door hardtop platform with Hornet trim.

The 1956 design failed to excite buyers and Hudson Hornet sales decreased to 8,152 units, of which 6,512 were four-door sedans and 1,640 Hollywood two-door hardtops.

1957 

In 1957, the historic Hudson name came only in a Hornet model in either "Super" and "Custom" trims available in a four-door sedan or a two-door "Hollywood" hardtop body styles. For the second year, the V-Line styling featured an enormous egg-crate grille, creases and chrome strips on the body sides, and was available in one of five tri-tone schemes for the Custom models. There was more ornamentation to the cars, including fender "finettes" atop the rounded rear quarter panels for 1957, along with unusual "twin-fin" trim on top of both front fenders.

The price was reduced and the power was increased by way of AMC's new  V8 that was rated at  with a four-barrel carburetor and dual exhausts.

Prompted by Automobile Manufacturer Association ban on factory-supported racing beginning in 1957, production of Hudson Hornet ended on 25 June 1957, at which time the Hudson brand name with its racing heritage was discontinued and all American Motors Corporation automobiles were then marketed as being made by "Rambler" Division. Total production of 1957 Hornets was 4,108, split between 3,359 sedans and 749 Hollywood Hardtops.

Foreign markets 
The Hudson Hornet was sold in foreign markets, either exported as complete cars or locally built from knock-down kits.

Australia

The Hornet was introduced to the Australian market in 1955.

Canada
Canadian assembly of Hudson vehicles commenced in 1932 by Hudson Motors of Canada in Tilbury, Ontario. World War II interrupted operations and production ceased in 1941. Post-war operations resumed in 1950, with Hudsons being assembled by CHATCO Steel Products in Tilbury, Ontario. Operations in Tilbury ceased permanently in 1954 following the formation of American Motors Corporation. As a result of the merger, Toronto-based Nash Motors of Canada Ltd. became American Motors (Canada) Ltd. and all subsequent Hudson, Nash, and Rambler assembly operations continued in Toronto.

New Zealand

Hudson vehicles were imported into New Zealand from 1912 and eventually locally assembled from knock-down kits from 1919. 

From 1935, Hudson and other marques were assembled by Christchurch company Motor Assemblies Limited. Production ended when Standard-Triumph International acquired the company in 1954. From 1954 the Hudson Hornet was built in New Zealand by Auckland company VW Motors as a secondary line to the Volkswagens they assembled. AMC's subsequent Rambler models were assembled thereafter at VW Motors' new plant in Otahuhu, Auckland from 1958 until 1962. AMC formed an agreement in 1963 with Campbell Motor Industries (CMI) of Thames to assemble Ramblers, production of which ran from 1964 until 1971.

South Africa

Hudson vehicles were assembled in South Africa beginning in the 1920s by Stanley Motors at their plant, National Motor Assemblers (NMA), in Natalspruit (Gauteng). The Hudson Hornet was assembled in right-hand-drive from knock-down kits sourced from Canada. After the Hudson and Nash merger, NMA continued to assemble AMC's new Ramblers until 1967, although the 1957 Rambler was instead marketed in South Africa as the "Hudson 108."

United Kingdom
Hudsons were introduced to the United Kingdom in 1911 and eventually, a factory was built where Hudson (and Essex) vehicles were locally assembled from 1927. The British company was renamed Hudson Motors Ltd. in 1932.

The Hudson Hornet was assembled in right-hand-drive for the U.K. market and other European countries. Following the demise of the Hudson marque, the British company was renamed Rambler Motors (A.M.C.) Limited in 1966 and continued to import AMC vehicles through the 1970s.

Legacy 

The 1951 Hudson Hornet was selected as the "Car of the Year" in a book profiling seventy-five years of noteworthy automobiles by automotive journalist Henry Bolles Lent.

The Disney/Pixar film Cars and several spin-off video games featured a Fabulous Hudson Hornet named Doc Hudson, a retired Piston Cup champion voiced by Paul Newman, who was an avid auto-racing enthusiast. The Piston Cup is the film franchise's version of the Winston Cup Series, which changed names several times since its inception.

The Hudson Hornet was well-known for being seen in games such as Driver: San Francisco, Forza Horizon 4, and Forza Motorsport 4 as a part of the July Car Pack.

Revivals of Hornet model name
For the 1970 model year, American Motors resurrected the Hornet name for their new compact car that replaced the Rambler American (see AMC Hornet).

In 2006, a small, front-wheel-drive concept car called Hornet was designed and developed by Dodge.

For the 2023 model year, Stellantis resurrected the Hornet name for their new SUV, a version of the Alfa Romeo Tonale marketed in the U.S. under the Dodge brand.

Collectability 
First-generation Hudson Hornets are legendary for their NASCAR racing history and Jay Leno lists the 1951-1954 models as one of the "top ten of America's most collectible cars". "One of the great postwar landmarks - a true champion" gives it a big edge in collector appeal. Richard M. Langworth describes the first-generation Hornets in his book Complete Book of Collectible Cars: 70 Years of Blue Chip Auto Investments as "the most remembered Hudson of the postwar years, one of the industry's all-time greats." For example, prices on the Club Coupes, the body style used by the winning NASCAR drivers, have greatly appreciated in the last several years where several nicely restored examples have broken the $75K barrier in several cases. The convertible versions have also increased in value with a restored 1953 bringing $150,000 in 2013.
