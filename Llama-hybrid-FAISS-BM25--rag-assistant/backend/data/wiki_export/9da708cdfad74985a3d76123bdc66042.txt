Axis Mutatis is an album by the electronic dance music group The Shamen which was released in 1995. The album did not receive as much positive feedback as their previous album, Boss Drum, nor was it as popular, but Axis Mutatis still remained a fairly successful release, with the band eventually releasing four music videos for it. A Deep Dish remix of "Transamazonia" appeared on the WipEout soundtrack.

The initial release of Axis Mutatis contained an additional instrumental album, Arbor Bona Arbor Mala.

Critical reception
British magazine Music Week wrote, "The singalong techno pop is in full effect once more. This one needs a few listens before the hooks sink in, but the blend of ambience, beats and melodies finally wins over."
