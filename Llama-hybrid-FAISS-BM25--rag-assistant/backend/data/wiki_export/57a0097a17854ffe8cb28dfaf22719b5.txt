Wassa East District is one of the fourteen districts in Western Region, Ghana. Originally it was formerly part of the then-larger Mpohor/Wassa East District in 1988, which was created from the former Wassa-Fiase-Mpohor District Council, until the southwest part of the district was split off to create Mpohor District on 28 June 2012; thus the remaining part has been renamed as Wassa East District. The district assembly is located in the eastern part of Western Region and has Daboase as its capital town.
