History
In May 1954, with enrollment exceeding the school's target of 1,000, the Haddonfield Public Schools notified the Delaware Township School District (since renamed as the Cherry Hill Public Schools) that its students would no longer be accepted at Haddonfield Memorial High School after June 1956. While there were 420 Haddonfield students at the high school, there were a total of 760 students as part of sending/receiving relationships, including about 200 from Delaware Township (now Cherry Hill).

Constructed on a  plot of land, Delaware Township High School opened in September 1956 for students in grades 7–9. Completed at a cost of $1.6 million (equivalent to $ million in ), dedication ceremonies were conducted in November 1957 for the complex, which was built in four separate sections.

The school was renamed as Cherry Hill High School and adopted its current name for the 1966–67 with the opening of Cherry Hill High School East.

With delays in construction of its new building, Cherry Hill East began the 1966–67 school year with 450 students in ninth grade attending split sessions at the original Cherry Hill High School. The new Cherry Hill East building opened in January 1967.

Cherry Hill High School West was an IB World School from September 2000 to June 2008, offering students the IB Diploma Programme.
