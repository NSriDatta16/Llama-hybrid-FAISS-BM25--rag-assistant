On 9 July 2015, the stadium was unveiled as the Cheaper Insurance Direct Stadium, after fan Alex Couper and his company took over the sponsorship. At the end of the 2016–17 season the name reverted to Dumbarton Football Stadium. In July 2017 the club agreed a deal with local radio station Your Radio, which would see the stadium known as 'The YOUR Radio 103FM Stadium' for at least the next two years. That deal was cancelled in May 2018 with Your Radio facing an uncertain future, with C&G Systems agreeing a three-year deal a week later. In September 2021 the housing specialists moreroom agreed a deal with the club to be the sponsors for this season and change the name of the stadium to the moreroom.com stadium. Following the dissolution of the Manchester-based housing specialists in 2023, the stadium name reverted to the “Dumbarton FC Stadium”.
