Francisco is an 'L' station on the CTA's Brown Line. It is an at-grade station with a single island platform, located in Chicago's Ravenswood Manor neighborhood at 4649 North Francisco Avenue. The adjacent stations are Kedzie, which is about  to the west, and Rockwell, located across the Chicago River about  to the east.

History
Francisco Station opened on December 14, 1907, as part of Northwestern Elevated Railroad's Ravenswood line. It had survived relatively intact until September 2006, when the station closed for renovation.

Brown Line Capacity Expansion Project
The Brown Line Capacity Expansion Project aims to allow eight car trains on the Brown Line by the extension of the platforms at all stations. At the same time all Brown Line stations are being upgraded to be accessible to passengers with disabilities. Because of the historic nature of the station structures, Francisco Station was not completely rebuilt, as with the neighboring Kedzie and Rockwell stations. However, the platforms were rebuilt, an auxiliary entrance added on Sacramento Avenue, and the station house and canopy were renovated and upgraded. The station closed from September 15, 2006, to March 9, 2007, to allow this work to be completed.
