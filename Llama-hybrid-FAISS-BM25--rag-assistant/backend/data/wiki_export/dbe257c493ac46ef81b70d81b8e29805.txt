is a single-episode Japanese original video animation which was created to celebrate the fifth anniversary of NetRunner magazine. NetRunner is a controversial publication since some articles promote hacking. Characters that are used to promote the magazine and are sold as merchandise have been taken directly from Hiroyuki's 2channel community. Hiroyuki himself is a character of Netrun-mon, one of the many references to Internet fandom in Japan that the anime is based upon.

Characters
The heroes of the story are two ducks, BB Runner (voiced by Kappei Yamaguchi) and his younger sister Ranna (voiced by Atsuko Enomoto). They are original characters created by NetRunner. They appear on the night before a deadline in the offices of NetRunner magazine, while the employees sleep, to complete their work for them.
