The Hain Celestial Group, Inc. is an American food company whose main focus is natural foods and botanically-based personal care products. Its products range from herbal teas, sold by its Celestial Seasonings brand to snacks offered through its Terra brand as well as soaps, lotions, hair care, and body wash offered through their Jason, Alba, Live Clean, and Avalon Organic Brands. In May 2000, Hain Food Group merged with Celestial Seasonings, Inc. creating the current company.

Hain Daniels is its subsidiary in the United Kingdom.

History
The H. J. Heinz Company acquired 19.5% of the company in September 1999, but subsequently divested itself of all holdings in December 2005. On May 7, 2002, the company prior year periods had been restated by reclassifying promotional allowances and other sales incentives of $16.8 million in the third quarter of 2001. On January 13, 2014, the company acquired the rice company Tilda for $357 million. In 2015 the company acquired the non-dairy company Mona Naturprodukte Gmbh with its brand Joya.

In June 2018, Hain Celestial announced that CEO Irwin Simon would step down, becoming non executive chairman after a replacement is found.

Lawsuit
In November 2013, Hain Celestial became one of 25 companies targeted in an ongoing class action lawsuit regarding allegations of falsely labeling their personal care products (including Celestial Seasonings) as 'organic' under California law (California Products Act of 2003) to mislead consumers into purchasing them.

According to Glaucas Research Group and Eurofins, many of these products, including beverages, contain high levels of pesticide, far above federal limits of the United States. In September 2015, Hain Celestial Group reached a settlement and agreed to pay consumers a $7.5 million compensation for mislabeling their products with an additional $2.4 million worth of coupons.
