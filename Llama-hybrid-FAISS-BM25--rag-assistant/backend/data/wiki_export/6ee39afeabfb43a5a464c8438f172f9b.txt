Alberto Migré, pseudonym of "Felipe Alberto Milletari Miagro" (12 September 1931, Buenos Aires – 10 March 2006) was an Argentine TV screenwriter and producer, specialized on telenovelas.

Family background
Alberto was born in the barrio of Almagro, Buenos Aires, under the name of Felipe Alberto Milletari Miagro; the son of Piedmontese immigrants, his father Don Milletari was arriving from Italy when he met the daughter of another piemontes family the Miagro, whom were living in the Córdoba Province of Argentina after arriving from Italy via Brazil.

His upbringing was enriched by the entrepreneurial spirit of his father and the intellectual influence of her mother a dedicated reader of history and philosophy. By the time he entered the professional world of writers and TV production industry, Alberto was advised by his colleagues and mentors to change his name, a common dynamic in the industry, as such after consulting and researching names he decided to create a combination name based on his second name Albereto and a variation of his mother's surname Miagro in  Judæo-Piedmontese language, and his pseudonym "Alberto Migré" was born; giving him the seal to a successful career.

TV career
Migré started off working in radio stations, with the idea of eventually becoming an actor, although he himself acknowledged that his voice was not good for the microphone. He wrote some scripts for a children's programme and ended up in charge of sound in a radionovela starring Chela Ruiz and Horacio Delfino. He was commended by Ruiz and put in charge of writing some major programmes, such as Revista juvenil argentina (1948). Then he moved on to television.

Starting in 1972, Migré created major hits, such as Rolando Rivas, taxista, Piel Naranja and Pobre diabla. He also contributed with some Brazilian series. In 1974 he wrote the script for the cinema version of Rolando Rivas, taxista.

During the 1990s Migré was practically forgotten by the TV industry. Migré often criticized the new ways of writing TV fiction, especially the over-long series of episodes driven by good ratings and other economical factors alone: "In the 60s, telenovelas lasted 22 half-hour episodes; it was a delight, you had a plan, developed the story with a rhythm and precise guidelines and then you went on to think of another story." He was also a vindicator of the role of the creative screenwriter: "Current TV is not for me, since it is not what I was taught: I learned that the author was the foundation upon which the whole project was built. Now the author has lost importance and has been replaced by a team of writers in charge of a coordinator."

Migré never married, and lived with his parents until their death. He died while sleeping, victim of a heart attack, at the age of 75. He was the incumbent president of Argentores, the Argentine scriptwriter's guild. By an explicit request made in advance, he did not have a funeral service.
