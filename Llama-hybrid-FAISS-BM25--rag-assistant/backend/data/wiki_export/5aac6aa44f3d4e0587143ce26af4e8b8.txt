Location
The Huffman community is centered on Farm to Market Roads 2100 and 1960,   northeast of Downtown Houston in the piney woods of southeastern Texas. David Huffman, a native of Louisiana, came to Texas to fight against Mexico during the Texas Revolution.

In the early years, the economy was driven by farming with primary crops being cotton, rice, and corn as well as ranching and logging. A post office was established in the community in 1888, and two blacksmith shops were operating by 1892. The Beaumont, Sour Lake and Western Railway came through the community in the early 1900s. By 1914, the town reported two general stores and a population of 250. The construction and operation of the Sinclair Oil pump station in 1921 added to the economy. The 1936, the county highway map showed a church and cemetery at the townsite. In 1953, Lake Houston was opened as a water reservoir serving The City of Houston and serves as a recreational lake in the area today with boating, water skiing, jetting, fishing, and sailing.
