Julianadorp, is a town in North Holland, Netherlands. It is part of the municipality of Den Helder. It lies about 6 kilometres (3.7 miles) south of the town of Den Helder, north of the municipality of Schagen and west of Hollands Kroon.

History
It was formed in 1909, and named after Princess Juliana who was born that same year. Entrepreneur Pieter Loopuyt asked Queen Wilhelmina in October 1909 for permission to name the village after the newborn princess. Permission was granted. During World War II, Julianadorp changed its name to Loopuytdorp, because the Germans were not pleased with the link to the Dutch Royal family. After the war, the village got its original name back.

Economics and recreation 
Because of its vicinity to the beach and its many hours of sunshine (on average 1650-1700 per year), Julianadorp is a popular tourist destination. The western part of Julianadorp, located at the seaside, is called Julianadorp aan Zee (English: Julianadorp at Sea). There are eight holiday parks and several smaller farm campsites, minicampings and bed and breakfasts.
