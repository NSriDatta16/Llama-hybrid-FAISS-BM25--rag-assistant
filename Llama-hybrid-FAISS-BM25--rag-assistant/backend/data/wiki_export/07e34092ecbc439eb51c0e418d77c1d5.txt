Deadstring Brothers were an American rock band from Detroit, Michigan fronted by guitarist/vocalist Kurt Marschke.

The Chicago Reader said that "The Deadstring Brothers do the early-70s Rolling Stones sound as well as anyone, including what's left of the Glimmer Twins themselves. But they build an identity of their own with their stolen blueprints, turning in flinty, soulful performances that bring infectious vitality to bluesy rockers and boozy honky-tonk." In 2018, Bloodshot Records released a digital-only compilation titled Best of... Deadstring Brothers.  

After relocating to the Pacific Northwest in July 2013, guitarist/vocalist Kurtis Brothers met guitarists/vocalists Kris Stuart and Matt Cadenelli at the Wildwood MusicFest & Campout. This led to the formation of a new all-star group called The Deadstring Family Band. The Deadstring Family Band consists of members of The Deadstring Brothers, Rootjack, Fernando, The Don of Division Street, and Portland Country Underground.
