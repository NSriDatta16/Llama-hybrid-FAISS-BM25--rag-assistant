After the finish of his second provinciality, he was appointed as papal legate in Piedmont by John XXII, reducing the princes and marquess from that region to the unit and the peace, therefore before they were separated of the Church and in war among itself. In 1324 he was elected Master general of the Dominican Order, serving until his death in Paris in 1332.
