Geography
Established on the Parisian plateau, the town of Vélizy-Villacoublay borders Meudon in the north-east, Clamart in the east, Bièvres in the south-east, Viroflay in the north-west, and Chaville in the north.

History
The word "Vélizy" comes from the Latin word villa.  "Villacoublay" is formed from the same word, combined with the Gallo-Roman patronym "Escoblenus". Originally called simply Vélizy, the name of the commune became officially Vélizy-Villacoublay in 1938.

The territory was formed  from three distinct manors: Vélizy, Villacoublay, and Ursine, established in the 11th century. The domains were progressively annexed into the royal estate beginning in the 12th century (Vélizy was annexed at the end of the 13th century).

The airbase in Villacoublay, Vélizy – Villacoublay Air Base, was built in 1911.  In 1974 the Vélizy 2 shopping mall was opened.

The body of Diana, Princess of Wales was flown to RAF Northolt, west London, from here after her death in Paris on August 31, 1997.
