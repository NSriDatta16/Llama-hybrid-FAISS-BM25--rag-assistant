The Olympus 35 SP is a 35 mm rangefinder camera made by Olympus in Japan. It is the only 35 mm rangefinder with a dual center-weighted average metering and spot metering system. Metering is also available in manual mode, which is quite unusual amongst Japanese rangefinder cameras of this era. The uncoupled meter gives light readings in exposure values within the viewfinder which is then translated to exposure settings around the lens of the camera. It was succeeded by smaller cameras such as the 35RC and 35RD before Olympus pivoted to SLR cameras for the prosumer/professional market.
