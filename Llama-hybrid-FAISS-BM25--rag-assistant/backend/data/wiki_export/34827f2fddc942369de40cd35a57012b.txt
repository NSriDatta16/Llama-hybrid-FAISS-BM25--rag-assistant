The district is currently represented by Republican Doug Lamborn. With a Cook Partisan Voting Index rating of R+9, it is one of the most Republican districts in Colorado.

Characteristics

Politics
The Republican Party has held control of the seat since the district's creation. Colorado Springs, the main population center within the district, is home to many conservative Christian organizations. Among these groups are Focus on the Family, its founder Dr. James Dobson (who is considered by some to be the most influential evangelical leader in the country), New Life Church, Compassion International, HCJB, and many others. There is some Democratic strength in this district in urban Colorado Springs and some of its suburbs near Pikes Peak, but it is no match for the overwhelming Republican tilt of the district; however, unlike the nearby 4th that is trending more Republican by the year, the 5th is becoming slightly less Republican due to demographic changes, but not enough for the area to be competitive for the near future.

Colorado Springs also boasts a large population of both active-duty and retired military personnel and is home to many companies in the defense industry, all of which are demographics that tend to vote for Republicans. Throughout the district's history, Republicans have won by comfortable margins. From 1996 through 2004, Republican Joel Hefley usually won reelections with about 70% of the vote. George W. Bush received 66% of the vote in this district in 2004.

Economy
Because of the strong military presence, Colorado Springs's economy is usually very stable and frequently sees growth. The western portions of the district are mostly small mountain towns whose economy depends on ranching, farming, mining, and tourism.

Tourism
Millions of tourists visit the Colorado Springs region every year, primarily to visit Garden of the Gods, United States Olympic Training Center, U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Museum, Pikes Peak, and the United States Air Force Academy.

Military
Colorado Springs, located within the district, is home to multiple military installations. Fort Carson, the United States Air Force Academy, Peterson Space Force Base, Schriever Space Force Base, and NORAD are also all located within the district. There are more veterans living in the Colorado Fifth than any other district in America.
