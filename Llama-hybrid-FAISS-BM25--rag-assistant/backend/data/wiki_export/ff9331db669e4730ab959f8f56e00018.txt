Champion station is an at-grade light rail station on the Green Line and the Orange Line of the VTA light rail system. The station is located in the center median of Tasman Drive just east of its intersection with Champion Court, after which the station is named. This station is the furthest east on the section of track shared by the Green and Orange lines.

Champion was built as part of the Tasman West extension project as an infill station on the original Guadeloupe Corridor. The station opened on March 24, 1997, a couple of years before the rest of the Tasman West stations.
