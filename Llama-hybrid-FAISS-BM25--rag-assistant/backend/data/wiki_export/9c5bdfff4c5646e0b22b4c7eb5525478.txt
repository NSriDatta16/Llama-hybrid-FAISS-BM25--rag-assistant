Svartelva () is a river in Innlandet county, Norway. The  long river flows from the lake Gjetholsmjøen on the border of Løten and Stange at Byenga and it heads westward into Romedal. The river passes very close to the lake Rokosjøen in  Løten before heading wester to Ådalsbruk. At the village of Ilseng, it is joined by a tributary, the river Lageråa. From the point where the Lageråa joins, the river forms the border between Stange and Hamar municipalities, continuing until the outlet at Åkersvika into the large lake Mjøsa. The river is about  wide, but it is fairly shallow.
