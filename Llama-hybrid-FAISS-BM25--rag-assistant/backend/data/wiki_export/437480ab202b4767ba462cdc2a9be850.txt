History
The settlement of Khvoynaya was founded in 1927 to serve the station on the railroad connecting Sonkovo and Mga. The name in Russian means "in the needle-trees" and was given because the station was located in the pine forest. After August 1, 1927 it was part of Minetsky District of Borovichi Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. On July 23, 1930 the okrugs were abolished, and the districts became directly subordinate to the oblast. On June 8, 1931 the district center was transferred to Khvoynaya, and the district was renamed into Khvoyninsky District. On August 20, 1935 Khvoynaya was granted the status of an urban-type settlement. On July 5, 1944, Khvoyninsky District was transferred to newly established Novgorod Oblast and remained there ever since, with a brief interruption between 1963 and 1965, when the district was abolished as a part of aborted Khrushchyov administrative reform.
