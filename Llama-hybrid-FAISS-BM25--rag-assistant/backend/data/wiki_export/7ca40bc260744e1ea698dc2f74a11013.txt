Metal Slug 1st Mission is a run and gun video game developed by Ukiyotei and published by SNK. It was first released in Japan in 1999 for the Neo Geo Pocket Color and in North America in 2000.

The game was later re-released as part of Neo Geo Pocket Color Selection Vol. 1 in 2021.

Gameplay
Metal Slug 1st Mission plays similarly to other Metal Slug games, but has toned down graphics for the Neo Geo Pocket Color hardware. Notably, grenades are thrown by pressing the option button to switch, then fire. This was changed in the sequel. When the game is completed once, another character becomes playable. There are five different difficulty levels: kids, easy, normal, hard, and very hard.
