Lorna is a feminine given name. The name is said to have been first coined by R. D. Blackmore for the heroine of his novel Lorna Doone, which appeared in 1869. Blackmore appears to have derived this name from the Scottish placename Lorn/Lorne. In the U.S., according to the 1990 census, the name ranks 572 of 4275, and as a surname, Lorna ranks 62296 out of 88799.
National Lorna day is held annually on 30th April. It originally started in Staffordshire but is now recognised worldwide.
