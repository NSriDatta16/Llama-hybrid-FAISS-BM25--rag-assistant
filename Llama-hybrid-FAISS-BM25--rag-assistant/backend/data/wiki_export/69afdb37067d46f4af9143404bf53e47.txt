Reception 

The game received average reviews on both platforms according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. The game was praised for its authenticity, although critics felt that the graphics and sound effects were not improved from the previous game, NASCAR '98. Also, critics stated that the player would become "tired" of the game if they were a "racing-game fan". Next Generation said of the PlayStation version, "While not a huge improvement over NASCAR 98, it is a better game, and makes it a worthy upgrade if only for the Dual Shock support." Air Hendrix of GamePro said in the October 1998 issue that the Nintendo 64 version "redlines the thrills with quality stock-car action. Rookies will delight in the wild, bumper-grinding arcade side, while pros who dig sim racing will face off against tough CPU cars that block passing lanes and take you into the wall." An issue later, Hendrix stated, "If you're choosing between the PlayStation and N64 versions, the PlayStation game easily takes the pole â€“ though not by a huge margin. All told, race fans in general and NASCAR fans in praticular won't go wrong peeling out of pit row with this title."
