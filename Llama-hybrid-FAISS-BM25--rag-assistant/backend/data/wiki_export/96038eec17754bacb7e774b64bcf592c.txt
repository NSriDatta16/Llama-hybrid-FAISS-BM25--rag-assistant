The Ottawa Hospital Research Institute (OHRI), formerly Ottawa Health Research Institute, is a non-profit academic health research institute located in the city of Ottawa. It was formed in 2001 following the merger of three Ottawa hospitals. The Ottawa Hospital Research Institute is the research arm of The Ottawa Hospital and affiliated with the University of Ottawa.

As of 2022, the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute houses approximately 2,200 scientists, clinician investigators, students, research fellows, and support staff. It has five research programs: Cancer Therapeutics; Chronic Disease; Clinical Epidemiology; Regenerative Medicine; and Neurosciences. Its researchers are studying more than a hundred different diseases, conditions and specialties with an overall focus on translating discoveries and knowledge into better health.

Ronald G. Worton was the research institute's founding CEO and Scientific Director in 2001. In 2007, Duncan Stewart, formerly Chief Cardiologist of St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto and Director of Cardiology of University of Toronto, took over as CEO and Scientific Director.

History

COVID-19 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, scientists at the OHRI developed an early-stage COVID-19 vaccine candidate called TOH-Vac1. The candidate is a live replicating virus vaccine using a vaccinia virus vector. Results from pre-clinical studies were published in Molecular Therapy in October 2021. The research team was led by Dr. John Bell and was funded by the Thistledown Foundation, Ottawa Hospital Foundation and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
