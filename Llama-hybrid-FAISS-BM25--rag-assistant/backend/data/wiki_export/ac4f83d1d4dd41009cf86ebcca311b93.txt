It is located in the Buckhead neighborhood in the median of State Route 400, a limited access highway, at Peachtree Road/State Route 141. The station is in easy walking distance of many offices, hotels and shopping centers, including Lenox Square, although the Lenox MARTA station provides easier access to the mall.

Station layout

History
Buckhead was opened on June 8, 1996, the same day as Medical Center and Dunwoody. When State Route 400 was being constructed south of the perimeter in 1993, space was left that allowed track to be laid in the median from Buckhead all the way to Medical Center.  In 2014, new pedestrian bridges were built across both sides of State Route 400, allowing better access to the Stratford on the east and Tower Place on the west. 

In 2023, from February 17th to the 22nd, Buckhead Station was disconnected from the system due to track replacement at the track switch just north of the station. The station was serviced by a local shuttle that maintained the connection between Lenox (Gold Line) and Medical Center (Red Line) stations. The station faregates were left open, but no trains were in service.
