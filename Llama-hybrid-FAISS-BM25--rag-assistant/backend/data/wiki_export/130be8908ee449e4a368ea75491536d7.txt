Chuginadak Island (; ) is the largest island in the Islands of Four Mountains subgroup of the Aleutian archipelago. Chuginadak is an Aleutian name published by Captain Tebenkov in an 1852 map. According to Knut Bergsland's Aleut Dictionary, the Aleutian word "chugida-lix" means "to fry, to make sizzle." The Western half of the island is called Chuginadax in Aleut, meaning 'simmering'.

The island is approximately  long and the currently active Mount Cleveland stratovolcano forms the entire western half of the land mass and the eastern half of the island is the heavily eroded and less famous stratovolcano Tana. These halves of landmasses are connected with a small strip of land. 

The only major geographical place is Applegate Cove (2.5 miles across) (Chuguuĝix̂) on the Northern coast. The cove was named for Samuel Applegate, USC&GS, who commanded the schooner Nellie Juan during a survey of this area in the 1880s.
