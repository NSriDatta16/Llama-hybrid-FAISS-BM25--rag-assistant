Sportin' Life is the thirteenth studio album by American jazz fusion band Weather Report which was released in March 1985 through Columbia Records. Although featuring many more vocal performances than any of their previous studio albums, words are rare and most vocals are chants from guest musicians such as Bobby McFerrin or Carl Anderson. The album is named after a character from Porgy and Bess. In addition, Sportin' Life was to be the last Weather Report studio album but, given contractual obligations with Columbia, the band had to release a follow-up in 1986 which was titled This Is This!.
