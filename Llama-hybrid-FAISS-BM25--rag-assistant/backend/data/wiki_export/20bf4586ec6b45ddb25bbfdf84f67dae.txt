The Victoria's Voice Foundation 200 was a 134-lap, 200-mile long NASCAR Camping World Truck Series race that took place at Las Vegas Motor Speedway.

History

The race was first held on November 3, 1996 as the Carquest 420K. The race continued annually until 2000, when the race was removed from the schedule. However, the race returned as the Orleans 350 in 2001.

In 2011, the race was moved to October as part of the IndyCar weekend and became an afternoon race.

In 2012, the race was originally set for October 13 at 12 noon PDT as part of the IndyCar weekend, but Indy Racing League LLC faced issues from the 2011 IZOD IndyCar World Championship, with Truck race being that race's Saturday event, but the IndyCar race was removed as a result of legal issues following the death of Dan Wheldon on Lap 11 of the IndyCar race. As a result, it moved back to late September as a stand-alone race and returned to night time.

For the 2018 race, known as the World of Westgate 200, the event was shortened to 201 miles and 134 laps due to LVMS earned a 2nd race, now each of them had 201 miles and 134 laps.

When the 2022 schedule was released, it was announced that the race would not return, and Las Vegas would be only host one truck race in the spring.
