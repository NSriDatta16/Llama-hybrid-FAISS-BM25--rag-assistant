Bruno Tonioli (; born 25 November 1955) is a British-Italian television personality, choreographer and dancer. He has judged on the British television talent shows Strictly Come Dancing (2004–2019), DanceX (2007) and Britain's Got Talent (2023–present), and the American television talent shows Dancing with the Stars (2005–present) and Dance War: Bruno vs. Carrie Ann (2008).

Career
In 1980, as part of the group Duke and the Aces, Tonioli performed in but did not win the United Kingdom's competition to select an entry for the Eurovision Song Contest.

Tonioli has worked in the music business as a choreographer for music videos, stage shows, and tours for artists such as Tina Turner, Sting, Elton John, the Rolling Stones, Freddie Mercury, Sinitta, Boy George, Dead or Alive, Bananarama, and Duran Duran.  He danced in the Elton John video for "I'm Still Standing" (1983).

Tonioli choreographed the band Arcadia's music video for their song "Election Day" as documented in a 1980s documentary entitled The Making of Election Day. He was the choreographer for Ella Enchanted Minnie Driver.

In November 2016, Tonioli lent his name to an album released by Decca entitled An Italian Romance – a compilation of Italian songs by various artists selected by Tonioli. The cover of the album was shot by John Mac.

In November 2018, Tonioli presented the BBC Radio 2 series Bruno Tonioli at the Opera.

In October 2022, Tonioli competed in the second series of The Masked Dancer as Pearly King. He was in third place.

In January 2023, it was announced that Tonioli would be joining the judging panel for Series 16 of the British talent show Britain's Got Talent, replacing David Walliams. Tonioli was the first to use the Golden Buzzer, doing so for Ugandan dance group Ghetto Kids. However, not knowing the rules of the show, he mistakenly pressed it during the performance instead of waiting till the end, as had been the case since the Golden Buzzer was introduced in 2014. Tonioli then went on to press it again in the sixth episode, this time for singer Gamal John. This had never been done in the show's history, as usually a Judge only gets one use of the Golden Buzzer. Nevertheless it still counted.

Strictly Come Dancing & Dancing with the Stars 

 In 2004, Tonioli was elected to be a Judge on the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing, along with Craig Revel Horwood, Arlene Phillips & Len Goodman. In 2005, he was then chosen to be a judge on Dancing with the Stars, where he has remained until present. As he was a judge on both Strictly Come Dancing and its American counterpart, Dancing with the Stars, for one week each during Series 16 and 17, he was replaced by guest judge Alfonso Ribeiro, due to a broadcasting conflict between the two shows. 

Tonioli quickly became known for his commentary style, often getting out of his chair and physically describing a performance, whilst at the same time including colourful descriptives. As examples, during his time with the U.S. Dancing With the Stars, Tonioli called Cheetah Girl Sabrina Bryan "a little lynx on the prowl" and labelled singer and actor Billy Ray Cyrus "a crazy bear lost in a swamp".

The lowest score Tonioli has ever given a contestant was a '2' awarded only once on Dancing With the Stars, to Master P and his partner Ashly DelGrosso for their Paso Doble. This was due to Master P's lack of showmanship, and unwillingness to train and participate in the show. On Strictly Come Dancing, Tonioli has never awarded a '9' when every other Judge has awarded a '10', however on Dancing With the Stars this has happened on multiple occasions.

In 2020, due to COVID restrictions, Tonioli was stuck in the US and therefore did not appear on the judging panel at all during the series, but instead featured each week during the Judges' chat with Claudia via video call during the results show.

On 24 June 2021, it was announced that Anton Du Beke, the longest-running Strictly professional, would replace Tonioli as a permanent judge on Strictly Come Dancing for series 19. It was then announced on 19 May 2022 that Tonioli would not be returning to Strictly, and that Du Beke would take over permanently. Tonioli remarked on the matter:

In 2016, a surprise challenge saw Tonioli work with Jodie Sweetin and season 22 (U.S.) eventual-winner Nyle DiMarco and their professional partners.  During the sequence, the two celebrities swapped partners, seeing DiMarco and Keo Motsepe dance the tango in ballroom hold, with both men shirtless, and Mostsepe lift and twirl DiMarco.  This was the first time a same-sex pairing danced in any franchise of the show.

On Christmas Day 2022, in the Strictly Come Dancing Christmas Special, Tonioli surprised viewers by making a guest appearance, and singing "Don't Leave Me This Way" by The Communards. Reactions to the performance were mixed.

Controversies

Michael Bolton
A minor controversy arose following Tonioli's remarks to U.S. Dancing With the Stars contestant Michael Bolton and dance partner Chelsie Hightower on the 27 September 2010 after show, when the judge called Bolton's jive dance the worst he had seen in all 11 seasons, later awarding him a score of '3'. Bolton expressed his dissatisfaction prominently in the media afterward, stating:

This prompted ABC to release a statement firmly defending Tonioli:

Public image
In 2009, Rolling Stone magazine said that Tonioli had "won America's heart with his gay-Italian-maniac steez."

Personal life
Tonioli is fluent in five languages: Italian, English, Portuguese, Spanish, and French. He has lived in London since 1975.

Tonioli is gay and has spoken of the homophobic bullying he suffered in his youth.

Since 2010, Tonioli has been in a relationship with model Jason Schanne. In 2012, two years after the pair met, the couple had a commitment ceremony.
