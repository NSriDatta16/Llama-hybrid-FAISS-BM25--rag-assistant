World War II

Activated on 20 July 1942 at New River, North Carolina, 23rd Marines was assigned to the 4th Marine Division in February 1943 and relocated during July 1943 to Camp Pendleton, California. 23rd Marines participated in the following campaigns during World War II: Kwajalein, Saipan, Tinian, and Iwo Jima.

For Saipan the 23rd landed on beaches blue 1 & 2.  Shore party for 2/23 was the third battalion 20th Marines which was the 121st Seabees.

For Iwo Jima 2/23 was the right Assault Battalion on yellow beach.  They landed from APA 207 the USS Mifflin on yellow beach 2.  The 23rd did not have a Pioneer Battalion so the 133rd Seabees were attached to the Regiment in that assignment.  B Co. 133 NCB was Shore Party for 2/23 until relieved on D-plus 18.

During the fierce fighting which occurred in the Pacific Theater, four Marines of the 23rd Marine Regiment were awarded the Medal of Honor. In October 1945, the Regiment was again relocated to Camp Pendleton and was subsequently deactivated on 15 November 1945.
