Diarra is a French translation of the clan name Jara used in West Africa, as a hangover from the French colonial empire in that region. It originates from the Bambara language word jara, meaning lion, synonymous with waraba. The Kingdom of Diarra existed from the 7th Century until the 19th Century. The name is also frequently used with reference to the 18th to early 19th-century Bambara Empire in Ségou, Mali, which was ruled successively by Ngolo Diarra, his son Mansong (or Monzon) Diarra, and then his son Da Diarra.

The clan name (or patronym) Jara/Diarra is related to another clan name, Koné, and is heard in many of the chronicles that have been handed down orally.  Both are frequently praised together in song, signifying bravery and fearlessness.

The name Diarra, now a surname, is traditionally found mostly in Mali, but  also Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea and Senegal. Today, it has also spread around the world, notably in France and Spain. Today, it is also used as a given name.
