The Bombardier Challenger 800 is the largest super-midsize business jet that was built by Bombardier Aerospace. It is based on Bombardier's 50-seat Bombardier CRJ200 LR. The Challenger 850 is the updated version, produced from 2006 to 2012.

Design and development

The Challenger 850 is derived from the Bombardier CRJ200 airliner. It is capable of accommodating 12â€“16 passengers. The Challenger 850 jet has a transcontinental range and a high-speed cruise of Mach 0.80.

The Challenger 850 was first manufactured in 1996 as the Challenger SE (Special Edition) and rebranded in 2006 as the Challenger 850. Production ended in 2012 following completion of 71 deliveries.

"Challenger 850" or "CRJ Special Edition (SE)" are marketing designations for any CL-600-2B19 aircraft that was configured "green" at manufacture and subsequently completed with an interior approved by supplemental type certificate (STC).
