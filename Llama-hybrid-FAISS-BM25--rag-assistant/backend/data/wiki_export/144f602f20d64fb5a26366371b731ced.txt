The Federal Bar Council is a not-for-profit specialty bar association whose membership consists of lawyers and judges who practice primarily in federal courts within the Second Circuit. The Second Circuit covers the following districts:
District of Connecticut, Eastern District of New York, Northern District of New York, Southern District of New York, Western District of New York, and District of Vermont. The Federal Bar Council's offices are in White Plains, New York.

The organization was created by an act of the New York State Legislature, effective April 1932, under the name "the Federal Bar Association of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut."  It adopted its current, shorter name in 1968. Joan Wexler, former dean and president of Brooklyn Law School, is a former president of the council.
