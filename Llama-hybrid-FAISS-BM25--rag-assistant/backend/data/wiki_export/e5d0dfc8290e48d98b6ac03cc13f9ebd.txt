The Citadel Theatre is the major venue for theatre arts in the city of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, located in the city's downtown core on Churchill Square. It is the third largest regional theatre in Canada.

History
It began in a former Salvation Army Citadel bought by Joseph H. Shoctor, James L. Martin, Ralph B. MacMillan, and Sandy Mactaggart. The theatre's first production to be performed was Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?. The theatre was founded on October 12, 1965 with its first opening night on November 10, 1965. In its current location, The Citadel has the distinction of being the only venue where the Jule Styne musical Pieces of Eight has been produced.

The organization moved to its current building just off Churchill Square in 1976. Architect Barton Myers designed the structure. The building houses the Maclab, Shoctor, and Rice Theatres, Zeidler Hall, the Tucker Amphitheatre, and the Foote Theatre School.

The Maclab and Tucker are part of the Lee Pavilion, in the middle of Edmonton.

Queer History 
The Citadel Theatre has been a supportive ally to Edmonton's 2SLGBTQ+ community. The theatre has been the workplace of three gay Artistic Directors, and has staged many productions written by queer playwrights. 

Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? written by the gay playwright Edward Albee was the first production put on by The Citadel Theatre in 1965, three years after the play's Broadway debut in 1962. 

The Citadel Theatre has produced many plays with queer themes such as The Glass Menagerie, Hosanna, Kiss of the Spider Woman, and The Gay Heritage Project. 

In 2006, The Citadel Theatre hosted their first Queer Prom event. In 2009, the annual event drew more than 100 youth to the theatre to celebrate the end of their school year.
