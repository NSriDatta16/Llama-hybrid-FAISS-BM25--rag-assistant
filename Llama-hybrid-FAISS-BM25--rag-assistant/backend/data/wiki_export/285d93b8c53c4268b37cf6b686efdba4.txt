This species is only known from its type locality in the Mamiwa-Kisara Forest Reserve in the Ukaguru Mountains. Only four specimens are known. The scientific name is derived from the Swahili words  meaning toad or frog,  meaning tree, and  meaning beautiful, for the descriptive "beautiful tree-toad".
