History
Donegal County Council, which had previously held its meetings in Lifford Courthouse, acquired County House in Lifford for use as its meeting place and administrative headquarters in 1930.

The d'Hondt method has been deployed by Donegal County Council since 2009 and has worked on all but Budget Day, leading Martin Harley (running mate of Joe McHugh at the 2020 general election) to suggest it be used to help form a government.

Following the 2015 RTÃ‰ programme Standards in Public Office, in March 2019, John O'Donnell was found by the Standards in Public Office Commission to have contravened the Local Government Act in three different instances, including failure to maintain proper standards of integrity, conduct and concern for the public interest.

Donegal County Council has three representatives on the Northern and Western Regional Assembly where they are part of the Border Strategic Planning Area Committee.
