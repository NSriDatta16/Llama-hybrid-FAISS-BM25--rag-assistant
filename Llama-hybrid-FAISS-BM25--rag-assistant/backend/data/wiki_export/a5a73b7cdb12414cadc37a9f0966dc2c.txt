Name
The Old Norse form of the name was probably just Eini. This name is derived from einir which means "juniper" (referring to the vegetation around the lake). The last element of the name is -vatnet which is the finite form of vatn which means "water" or "lake". Historically, the lake name only included the first element of the current name, and later the -vatnet suffix was added.
