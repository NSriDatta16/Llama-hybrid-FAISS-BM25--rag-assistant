The Big V is a semi-professional basketball league in Victoria, Australia, comprising both a men's and women's competition.

History
The Big V's history began in 1987 with the introduction of the Country Victorian Invitation Basketball League (CVIBL). The league had multiple divisions and was re-named the Victorian Basketball League (VBL) in the mid 1990s.

In 2000, the Big V Conference joined the Australian Basketball Association (ABA). The ABA ceased operations following the 2008 season, resulting in the Big V becoming independent.

In addition to the league's Championship Men and Championship Women divisions, the Big V has Division One and Division Two as well as a number of youth divisions.
