Hope This Finds You Well is a compilation album by the Pompano Beach, Florida rock band Further Seems Forever, released in 2006 by Tooth & Nail Records. It was released to coincide with the band's final tour, as they had announced that they would break up following tours of the United States and Canada that Spring. The album includes tracks from all three of the band's full-length studio albums: The Moon is Down (2001), How to Start a Fire (2003), and Hide Nothing (2004). As such it includes all three of the band's lead vocalists: Chris Carrabba, Jason Gleason, and Jon Bunch. Its title is taken from a lyric in the song "Pictures of Shorelines."

The album also includes several bonus tracks. "Vengeance Factor" was the first song the band ever released, having originally appeared on the Deep Elm Records compilation An Ocean of Doubt, and was recorded with original singer Carrabba. "There, Now I've Said It" is a previously unreleased outtake from How to Start a Fire, recorded with Gleason. This version of "Say It Ain't So" was recorded with Carrabba for the compilation Rock Music: A Tribute to Weezer and was previously included as a bonus track on the vinyl LP version of The Moon is Down. Carrabba's version did not appear on the final tribute compilation, as by that time the band had re-recorded the song with Gleason. The acoustic rendition of "Light Up Ahead" was originally included as a bonus track on Best Buy versions of Hide Nothing and was recorded with Bunch. The cover of *NSYNC's "Bye Bye Bye" was recorded with Gleason and originally appeared on the compilation Punk Goes Pop. "Justice Prevails" is taken from the band's debut EP From the 27th State and was recorded with Carrabba.
