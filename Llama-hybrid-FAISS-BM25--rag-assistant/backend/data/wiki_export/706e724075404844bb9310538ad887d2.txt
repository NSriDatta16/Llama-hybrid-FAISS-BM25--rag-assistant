The station is managed by Chiltern Railways, who provide most of the services,  including from London Paddington and Marylebone to Oxford and Banbury.

History
The Great Western Railway built the  â€”  section of the Oxford and Rugby Railway between 1845 and 1850. However, the GWR did not open a station at King's Sutton until 1872. By 1881 the arrival of the Banbury and Cheltenham Direct Railway via  had made King's Sutton a junction. British Railways withdrew passenger services between King's Sutton and Chipping Norton in 1951 and closed the B&CDR line to freight traffic in 1964. The station was reduced to an unstaffed halt from 2 November 1964.
BR removed King's Sutton station footbridge in the 1960s and replaced it with a signal-controlled barrow crossing at the North end of the platform. An incident in early 2005 where a passenger was nearly hit by an express train saw the Northbound platform closed for a short period whilst security guards were brought in to man the crossing. This led to work starting on a new bridge in late 2005 and completion in May 2006. The old passenger shelter on the up platform was replaced by a new plastic and metal 'bus-shelter' style one.

A late night robbery in 2001 led Chiltern Railways to raise security concerns. As a result, CCTV cameras were installed in 2002.

King's Sutton is the least used station in the county of Northamptonshire.
