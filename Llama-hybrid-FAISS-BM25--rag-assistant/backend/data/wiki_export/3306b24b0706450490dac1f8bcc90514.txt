The event was the 1975 edition of the World Snooker Championship, first held in 1927. The tournament featured 27 participants, eight of whom were seeded and received byes to the second round. The event featured a prize fund of A$30,000 with the winner receiving A$7,500. This was the second World Snooker Championship to be held outside of the United Kingdom after 1969, when the World Championship reverted to a knockout format. The tournament was promoted by Eddie Charlton Promotions on behalf of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association.

The final was held at the Nunawading Basketball Centre on Burwood Highway, in Burwood East, Victoria. Defending champion Ray Reardon played Eddie Charlton in a best of 61  match. Reardon won 10 of the 12 frames on the second day to lead 16–8 but Charlton took the first nine frames on day three and moved into the lead. Reardon then led 23–21 before Charlton won eight frames in a row to lead 29–23, requiring just two of the last nine frames to win. However Reardon then took seven frames in a row and, although Charlton levelled the match at 30–30, Reardon won the deciding frame to secure a 31–30 victory. It was the third consecutive year that Reardon won the title, and his fourth overall. Dennis Taylor made the highest  of the tournament, 128, in his quarter-final match against Gary Owen.

Overview and format

The World Snooker Championship is the preeminent tournament in professional snooker. Joe Davis won the first edition, in 1927 at Camkin's Hall in Birmingham, England. Ray Reardon was the defending champion in 1975, having defeated Graham Miles 22–12 in the 1974 final.

The championship was held from 9 April to 1 May 1975 at multiple locations across Australia. This was the second time since 1969 that the championship was held outside the United Kingdom, after 1971. Tobacco brand Park Drive did not continue their sponsorship from 1974. The World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association appointed Eddie Charlton Promotions as the promoter. Charlton was a leading player, and the losing finalist in the 1973 World Snooker Championship. Snooker historian Clive Everton later wrote that "Some sports might have found it odd that a world championship should be promoted by one of its leading contenders but professional snooker, ever since the days of Joe Davis, was used to the idea of a player or clique of players having control of either promotion or administration, or both."

The event featured 27 participants, with a preliminary round, and eight seeded players who were awarded byes to the second round. The number of frames increased during the tournament, with the opening rounds being the best of 29, the quarter-finals and semi-finals best of 37 and the final a best of 61 frames match.

There was controversy about the seedings. John Spencer was seeded 8 which meant that he met top seed Reardon in the quarter-finals; the pair were regarded as the two leading players. 1972 champion Alex Higgins was also in the top half of the draw, while promoter Eddie Charlton was in the bottom half. Several years later, in his autobiography, Reardon called the seedings for the tournament "a farce". Journalist and author John Dee referred to "shady goings on perhaps by the draw committee who seemed to be doing their utmost to bring the title to Australia."

Davis then took the first four frames of the final session to lead 13–12; two frames later he led 14–13, but Taylor won the next two frames to secure a 15–14 victory.

Reardon won the match 19–18. Reardon commented after the match, "I think this was probably the greatest match ever played... I've never potted better or defended better, and I don't think John has." The match between Higgins and Williams was delayed for 50 minutes during the second session after an overhead light fell onto the snooker table. Higgins later led 13–5.

Thorburn later recalled that, shortly after the commencement of the fifth session, Charlton started to play more quickly: "He went for everything. He hardly missed a thing. He was running around the table, running around it!" Thorburn, writing in 1987, remarked that he had never faced anyone who played as well as Charlton had during that session. The final score was 23–14 to Charlton, with a conclusive score reached at 19-12.

Semi-finals

Taylor flew in a light aircraft from Sydney on the morning of his match with Charlton; the aircraft encountered turbulence, and, according to Everton, Taylor "never recovered from a poor start". Charlton took 10 of the first 12 frames, and was 16–8 ahead after four sessions, going on to win 19–12. In his autobiography, Taylor recalled that "Charlton was playing well, with his famous gun-barrel cueing action", but also mentioned that he had been at a disadvantage playing on a table that Charlton was used to from his earlier matches in the tournament.

Final
The final was held at the Nunawading Basketball Centre on Burwood Highway, in Burwood East, Victoria, as the best of 61 frames. Reardon led 16-8, but Charlton then won the next nine frames to take the lead. Reardon was ahead 22-20, but Charlton won eight of the following frames lead 28-23. Reardon produced a seven-frame winning streak to leave himself needing one further frame at 30–29. Charlton won the 60th frame. In the deciding frame, Reardon made a 62 break, to claim victory at 31–30. It was Reardon's third consecutive championship win, and his fourth overall. In all, he won six world titles. Charlton never reached the final again, but he was runner-up at the World Billiards Championship in 1984 and 1988.

The 1975 tournament received significantly less UK press coverage than the three preceding world championships had done; the level of coverage in the Australian press was described as "very poor" by Snooker Scene. Everton considered that for Charlton, losing the final was "a psychological set back from which [he] never recovered".
