Krabathor, also spelled Krabator on their early demos, is a Czech death metal band from Uherské Hradiště, founded by vocalist and guitarist Petr "Christopher" Kryštof in 1984. The band also includes bassist/vocalist Bronislav "Bruno" Kovařík and drummer Peter "Pegas" Hlaváč.

History
Krabathor, whose name is inspired by Krabat, the main character in the Sorbian fairy tale The Satanic Mill, was formed in 1984. In 1988, they released their first rehearsal demo, Breath of Death, which was soon followed by two more, Total Destruction and Brutal Death, all under the name Krabator. In 1991, the studio demo Pocity detronizace was recorded, resulting in a deal for two albums with Monitor Records. The band's first studio album was released in 1992, under the title Only Our Death Is Welcome..., and was followed by Cool Mortification a year later. A record deal followed with Morbid Records, and the album Lies came out in 1995, supported by the band's first European tour, with Impaled Nazarene. In 1996, they played at the No Mercy Festival.

In March 1998, Krabathor issued the album Orthodox, and they toured extensively through Europe with Cannibal Corpse. A year later, they toured with Malevolent Creation and Master. At that point, Bruno left the band to form Hypnos and was replaced by Paul Speckmann, of Master. They issued two albums in this lineup: Unfortunately Dead (2000)
and Dissuade Truth (2003). , these are Krabathor's last original releases.

In 2003, the band, after playing their last concert at the inaugural Basinfirefest in Spálené Poříčí, went on an indefinite hiatus. Kryštof moved to the United States, Speckmann returned to Master, and then-drummer Libor Lebánek formed the band Bad Face with his brother.

In 2014, Krabathor reunited for an exclusive show at the Brutal Assault festival in Jaroměř, in their classic lineup of Kryštof, Kovařík, and Hlaváč. In 2015, they launched the Krabatour, performing several concerts across Czechia and Slovakia.

In 2021, the band released Demonizer / Mortal Memories II, a compilation of their 1988 demos Breath of Death, Total Destruction, and Brutal Death.
