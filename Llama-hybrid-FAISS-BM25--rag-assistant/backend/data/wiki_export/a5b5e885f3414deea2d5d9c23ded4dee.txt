45 Minutes From Hollywood (1926) is an American two-reel silent film released by Pathé Exchange. The runtime is 15 minutes.

At the time, it was known as a Glenn Tryon vehicle, but today it is best remembered as the second instance of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy appearing in the same film together — although they do not share any scenes — at least half a decade after their first chance billing in The Lucky Dog (1921).

Since the film uses footage from the Theda Bara star vehicle Madame Mystery (released April 1926, featuring Hardy in the supporting cast, and co-written and co-directed by Laurel), it is also the last screen appearance of silent film vamp Bara.

Plot 
A California family is sent a letter informing them that if they do not quickly travel to Hollywood to pay a fee they owe, they will be evicted from their home. The family decides to send Grandpa, but the son so badly wants to see Hollywood that he convinces his mother to let him go, too.

Description 
Stan appears in bed in his only scene. He wears a nightcap, nightgown, and a large comedy mustache. Jimmy Finlayson appears looking like this in several later Laurel and Hardy films. Oliver also features a similar mustache. Laurel's name does not appear in the credits for this film, but Hardy's name does.
