In Greek mythology, Agapenor (, gen. Ἀγαπήνορος means 'much distress') was a leader of the Arcadians in the Trojan war.

Family 
Agapenor was a son of Ancaeus, and grandson of Lycurgus.

Mythology 
As king of the Arcadians, Agapenor received sixty ships from Agamemnon, in which he led his Arcadians to Troy.  He also occurs among the suitors of Helen and one of the men to be in the Trojan Horse.

On Agapenor's return from Troy he was cast by a storm on the coast of Cyprus, where he founded the town of Paphos and in it the famous temple of Aphrodite.  He also occurs in the story of Alcmaeon: it was to him that Arsinoe (Alphesiboea), Alcmaeon's wife was sold away by her own brothers.

Agapenor had a descendant Laodice, who was known for having sent to Tegea a robe (peplos) as a gift to Athena Alea, and to have built a temple of Aphrodite Paphia in Tegea.
