Background and composition 

Lasting 3 minutes, "Zjarr e ftohtë" has its lyrics written by Florian Kondi. Composed by Klodian Qafoku, it is a pop song which its instrumentation features a southern Albanian folk music-esque melody. The lyrics are sung from the perspective of a man who cannot forget his former lover. He likens his predicament to feeling "fire and cold" (or "fire but still cold"), while begging her to "open [her] heart". Despite the strength of the lyrics, the song was performed in a subdued fashion. Ejlli and three backing singers barely moved from their positions, while two Albanian folk musicians provided accompaniment. Many commentators had difficulty pronouncing the song title or the performer's name. The BBC commentator, Paddy O'Connell, for example, rendered the song as "Zlar E Flot".
