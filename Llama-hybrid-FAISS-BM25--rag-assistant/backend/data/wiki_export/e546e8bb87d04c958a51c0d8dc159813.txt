Origin & history 
In 1967, Jim Muellner was commissioned to design and build one of the first self-serve luggage cart vending machines. In 1970, Salt Lake City, Minneapolis, and Los Angeles saw the launch of Smarte Carte Inc.'s initial activities. They moved into foreign markets in the 1980s and have maintained market leadership in other vending equipment and airport baggage carts through long-term customer contracts. In 1992, the company recognized the increasing concern with security at airports and formed Smarte Carte Inc. to develop and grow the locker business. The company extend operations into shopping malls across the country. In 2008, with the purchase of First Class Seats and Sit Back & Relax, they entered the massage chair business, making them the largest provider of vending massage chair services in the United States. They expanded their business further in 2018 by purchasing Aviation Mobility and entering the wheelchair market.
