The Guinean forest-savanna mosaic, also known as the Guinean forest-savanna transition, is a distinctive ecological region located in West Africa. It stretches across several countries including Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Nigeria, and Cameroon. This region is characterized by a unique blend of forested areas and savannas, creating a diverse and dynamic landscape.

It is an ecoregion of West Africa, a band of interlaced forest, savanna, and grassland running east to west and dividing the tropical moist forests near the coast from the West Sudanian savanna of the interior.

Setting
The Guinean forest–savanna mosaic covers an area of , extending from western Senegal to eastern Nigeria, and including portions of Gambia, Guinea Bissau, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin and Cameroon. The Cameroon Highlands of eastern Nigeria and Cameroon separate the Guinean forest–savanna mosaic from the Northern Congolian forest–savanna mosaic, which lies to the east. The Dahomey Gap is a region of Togo and Benin where the forest-savanna mosaic extends to the coast, and separates the Upper Guinean forests of Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Côte d'Ivoire, and Ghana from the Lower Guinean forests of Nigeria and Cameroon.

Climate 
The climate in this region varies depending on the specific location, but it generally experiences a tropical climate with distinct wet and dry seasons. The wet season brings heavy rainfall, while the dry season is characterized by lower precipitation and drier conditions. This ecoregion is situated in the humid tropical savanna zone, where the average yearly high temperatures range from 30 to 33°C and the lows range from 14 to 21°C. The annual rainfall typically falls between 1,600 and 2,000 mm, although there are areas in the Dahomey Gap that receive 1,000 mm or less annually.

The Guinean forest-savanna mosaic represents a critical ecological transition zone between the dense, evergreen rainforests to the south and the more open, tree-dotted savannas to the north. This transition creates a unique mix of plant and animal species adapted to varying ecological conditions. Like many ecosystems worldwide, the Guinean forest-savanna mosaic is susceptible to the impacts of climate change. Altered rainfall patterns, increased temperatures, and more frequent extreme weather events have affected the health and composition of this biome.

Biodiversity 
The Guinean forest–savanna mosaic is known for its high biological diversity. It is home to a wide range of plant and animal species, including many endemic species that are found nowhere else in the world. Some iconic species found here include chimpanzees, pygmy hippos, forest elephants, and various species of primates and birds. They also include several species of primates, reptiles, amphibians, and plants that have evolved in isolation within this region.

Vegetation 

 Forest: The forested areas in this mosaic are primarily composed of tropical rainforests, characterized by high rainfall, high humidity, and diverse flora and fauna. These forests are home to a wide variety of plant species, including towering hardwood trees, lianas, epiphytes, and a rich understory of shrubs and herbs.
 Savanna: The savanna component consists of grasslands interspersed with scattered trees, which are adapted to periodic fires. The savanna ecosystem supports a different set of plant species, including various grasses, shrubs, and acacia trees.

Flora

This biome is characterized by a mix of forested areas and open savannas. It is often referred to as a mosaic because it consists of a patchwork of different vegetation types. In the forested areas, you can find a mix of evergreen and deciduous trees, while the savanna regions feature grasslands and scattered trees.
In terms of plant life, it contains a mix of tree species such as mahogany, iroko, and various species of acacia, alongside grasses and shrubs common to savannas. The region is mainly grassland crossed with trees growing alongside streams and on hillsides, with the constantly occurring fires keeping back the growth of trees in open country. Lophira lanceolata is one of the tree species found that is more resistant to fire than many others.

Fauna

The mixture of forest and grassland provide habitat for a range of species from large mammals such as African leopard, forest elephants, hippopotamus and antelopes such as the red-flanked duiker to the common tortoise as well as more localised species including patas monkeys and Ghana worm lizards (Amphisbaenia). The wetlands in the region are rich in birdlife, including iris glossy starling and black crowned crane.

 Mammals: The Guinean forest-savanna mosaic is home to a wide variety of mammalian species. This includes iconic species such as African elephants, western chimpanzees, and western lowland gorillas. Other notable mammals include leopards, various species of antelope (such as duikers and bushbucks), and a diverse range of primates (like guenons, colobus monkeys, and baboons).
 Birds: The avifauna of this region is highly diverse, with hundreds of species recorded. This includes a mix of forest-dwelling birds like turacos, hornbills, and various species of parrots, as well as savanna-adapted species like raptors, bustards, and various types of weavers.
 Reptiles and Amphibians: The mosaic is also home to a variety of reptiles and amphibians, including numerous snake species, chameleons, crocodiles, and an array of frogs and toads.
 Invertebrates: The biodiversity of invertebrates, including insects and arachnids, is extremely high, with countless species contributing to the overall ecological balance.
