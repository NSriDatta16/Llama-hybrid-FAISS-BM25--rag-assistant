Critical reception

John Abbey of Blues & Soul described Spirit as "a mighty, mighty album" which shows "the power of the nine-piece Earth Wind & Fire conglomeration." Billboard found that the album's "arrangements, songs, sweet floating vocal harmonies and punching instrumental phrases are all best described as impeccable". Joe McEwen of Rolling Stone exclaimed "Though most of Spirit maintains a high level of artistic competence, I find the new album to be like a bean-sprout salad — undeniably nutritious, but hardly filling."
Craig Werner of Vibe in a 4.5 out of 5 review, called Spirit "one of the group's defining moments" and "gospel soul for the ages". With a 4.5 out of 5 stars review Alex Henderson of Allmusic called the album "outstanding". Henderson continued saying "Maurice White's message and vision (an interesting blend of Afro-American Christianity and Eastern philosophy) was as positive and uplifting as ever, and as always, EWF expressed this positivity without being Pollyanna-ish or corny. And even if one didn't take EWF's calls for unity, hard work, self-respect, and faith in God to heart, they had no problem with their solid grooves." Joel Vance of Stereo Review dismissed the album opining "Maybe the members of the band are sincere in their beliefs, but they come across here as a sappy group with hackneyed arrangements, fey vocals, and songs loaded with the usual hey -baby -let's -get -it -on -in -the -cosmos twaddle." Robert Christgau of the Village Voice gave a B grade saying "Most of these songs are fun to listen to."

Music Week proclaimed "With a more spiritual, ethereal feel than the six albums they had already cut to that point, it really marks a turning point in their career and is crammed with excellent tunes." Simon Warner of PopMatters hailed the album's "ear-catching repertoire" and noted Spirit "would confirm E,W&F as a world talent, yet its shiny production and its impeccable vocal layering lacks the surprises that Open Our Eyes'' provides." Rick Atkinson of The Record wrote "Any album that can hit the album charts, the single charts, and discos all at once is a guaranteed success. John Rockwell of The New York Times declared that "What is most interesting about Maurice White and his musicians..is their refusal to be locked into any stylistic format Mr. White's record will be labeled 'disco' in some quarters, and indeed parts of if, would not sound out of place in a disco. But, generally, Earth, Wind and Fire is closer to jazz, or to jazz‐rock, than to the thumping formulas of disco. And yet the group isn't afraid to slip in a ballad, either." Variety also described the album as "Another solid rhythm and blues session with one of the slickest acts of the genre, Earth, Wind & Fire, which always keeps it together. "A couple of instrumentals break up a lot of smooth, polished vocal instrumental trips."

Isaac Hayes called Spirit one of Earth, Wind & Fire's five essential recordings.
Rick Atkinson of The Record placed Spirit at number 5 on his list of the top 15 albums of 1976. Spirit was also nominated for an American Music Award for Favorite Soul/R&B Album. A song from the album called Earth, Wind and Fire was also Grammy nominated in the category of Best Instrumental Composition.
