The Lewis Range is a mountain range located in the Rocky Mountains of northern Montana, United States and extreme southern Alberta, Canada. It was formed as a result of the Lewis Overthrust, a geologic thrust fault resulted in the overlying of younger Cretaceous rocks by older Proterozoic rocks. The range is located within Waterton Lakes National Park in Alberta, Canada and Glacier National Park and the Bob Marshall Wilderness Complex in Montana, United States. The highest peak is Mount Cleveland at .

Geography
The Lewis Range is within Waterton Lakes National Park in Canada, and in Glacier National Park and the Bob Marshall Wilderness Complex located in Flathead and Lewis and Clark National Forests in Montana. The Continental Divide spans much of the uppermost sections of the range. Major peaks in the range include Mount Cleveland (), which is the highest peak in the range and in Glacier National Park. Other prominent peaks include Mount Stimson (), Mount Jackson (), Mount Siyeh (), Going to the Sun Mountain, () and the isolated Chief Mountain (). The Chinese Wall in the Bob Marshall Wilderness is a  high feature that runs for . Major passes include Marias Pass and Logan Pass which bisects Glacier National Park east to west.

Geology
Formed by the Lewis Overthrust beginning 170 million years ago, an enormous slab of Precambrian rocks  thick,  wide and  long faulted and slid over newer rocks of the Cretaceous period. In this relatively rare occurrence, older rocks are now positioned above newer ones.
