The rufous-naped tit (Periparus rufonuchalis), also known as the black-breasted tit or dark-grey tit, is an Asian songbird species in the tit and chickadee family (Paridae). It was sometimes considered conspecific with the rufous-vented tit (P. rubidiventris), and was formerly placed in the genus Parus.

This tit is a native of the western Himalayas, but has a very large range, occurring in parts of India, China, Pakistan, Turkestan, Kyrgyzstan, and Afghanistan. Widespread and common, it is not considered a threatened species by the IUCN.
