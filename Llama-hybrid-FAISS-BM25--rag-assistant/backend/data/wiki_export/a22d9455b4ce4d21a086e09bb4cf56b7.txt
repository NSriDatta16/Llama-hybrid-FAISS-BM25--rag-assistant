Helen Liang Memorial Secondary School (Shatin) (HLMSS, ) is a secondary school in Sha Tin, Hong Kong. The primary school division was founded in 1961, while the secondary school division was founded in 1977 and relocated to the current site of Sha Tin in 1988.

History

YC Liang CBE (梁昌) was a businessman in British Hong Kong and Portuguese Macau. During World War II, he was an anti-Japanese intelligence agent in the British Army Aid Group (BAAG). After the war, he founded Yin Cheong Co., Ltd. with his wife, Helen Liang (whose Chinese name contains the word Yin), and they had 5 sons and 2 daughters. Helen Liang died in 1960. Thus in 1961, YC Liang donated money to the Hong Kong Government to found Helen Liang Memorial Primary School to commemorate his deceased wife. The campus location was at Po Hing Fong, Sheung Wan (nearby the Blake Garden), and the school was opened by the then Financial Secretary Arthur Grenfell Clarke, who was the Godfather of Helen Liang. 

Before the merger of the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 1963, the United College temporarily borrowed half of the Po Hing Fong building of Helen Liang Memorial Primary School as their campus from 1961 to 1962 (the then president was Dr. Ling Daoyang).

Helen Liang Memorial Secondary School was founded in 1977. The funding was donated by YC Liang again. It was also located in Po Hing Fong and named after Ms. Helen Liang, the deceased wife.

In 1988, the Hong Kong Government had granted land of 11,000 square meters in Tai Wai for Helen Liang Memorial Secondary School to build her new campus, and the school thus relocated from Sheung Wan to Sha Tin. The school has also been expanding over the years and has added a lot of facilities. The former site of 40 Po Hing Fong is now the King's College Old Boys' Association Primary School No. 2. It is also the exact location of the Po Hing Fong landslide in 1925.
