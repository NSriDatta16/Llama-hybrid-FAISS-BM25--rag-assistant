As a result of the Massachusetts general election, 2006, the Democrats picked up one open seat in the Massachusetts State Senate, the only change from the previous session. The current session began in January, 2007, and consists of 35 Democrats and 5 Republicans.

The 2006 Massachusetts House election was held on the same date as the Senate election, as well as Federal and Gubernatorial elections (see Massachusetts general election, 2006).

Twenty-seven of the forty seats were left uncontested by one of the major parties in the 2006 election.
