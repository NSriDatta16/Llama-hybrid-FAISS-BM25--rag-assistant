The Concert for Kampuchea (subtitled "Rock for Kampuchea") is a musical film from the best of the Concerts for the People of Kampuchea. The film was directed by Keith McMillan and was 4 nights of concerts in Hammersmith Odeon to raise money for Cambodia. The event was organized by Paul McCartney and Kurt Waldheim (who was then Secretary-General of the U.N.), and it involved well-established artists such as McCartney, The Who and Queen as well as younger punk and new wave acts like The Clash and The Pretenders. The film finishes with the presentation of Wings' Rockestra (more of 25 musicians playing together). Filmed in 1979, Concert for Kampuchea did not receive American theatrical distribution until it was picked up by Miramax in 1988.

The concert was also recorded and released as a double LP, 8-track cartridge tape and cassette tape in 1979. It has yet to be released in digital format (CD).
