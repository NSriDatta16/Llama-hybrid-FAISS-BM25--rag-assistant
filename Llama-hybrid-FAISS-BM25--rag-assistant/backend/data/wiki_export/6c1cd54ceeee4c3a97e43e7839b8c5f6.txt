Gil Philip Castillo (born October 21, 1965) is an American professional mixed martial artist. A professional from 1998 until 2006, he fought in the UFC, WEC and King of the Cage. Castillo is the former King of the Cage Middleweight Superfight Champion.

Background
Castillo excelled in wrestling at Antioch High School and after competing for California State University at Long Beach, he entered the trials for the Olympic team. He went 2–2, and needed to win his fourth match to get on the squad that trains for the alternate team, but lost on points. After becoming a licensed stockbroker, Castillo found Brazilian jiu-jitsu in 1995, and was trained by Cesar Gracie and Ralph Gracie before they introduced him to mixed martial arts.

Mixed martial arts career

Early career
Castillo made his professional debut in early 1997 in a tournament. He won his debut via rear-naked choke submission only 40 seconds into the first round. He won his next fight after his opponent broke his wrist during the fight, and in the tournament final, Castillo faced veteran Vernon White and won via armbar submission in just three minutes. Castillo fought for the King of the Cage Middleweight Superfight Championship on April 29, 2001, against then-champion Joe Hurley. In a back-and-forth fight, Castillo scored seven takedowns on the Lion's Den fighter, and won via unanimous decision. Castillo then fought future Strikeforce Welterweight Champion Nate Marquardt for the IFC Welterweight Championship and won via unanimous decision before being invited to compete in the UFC.
