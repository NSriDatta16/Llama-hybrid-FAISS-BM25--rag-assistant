Robinsons Brewery is a family-run, regional brewery, founded in 1849 at the Unicorn Inn, Stockport, Cheshire, England.

The company owns around 250 pubs, mostly in North West England.

History 
William Robinson purchased the Unicorn Inn from Samuel Hole on 29 September 1838. His eldest son George brewed the first Robinsons Ale there in 1849.

In 1859, Frederic Robinson took over from George and bought a warehouse to the rear of the inn to expand brewing capacity. As a result, Robinsons ale became available at pubs around the Stockport area. To control the quality of ale sold, Frederic began to purchase public houses. From 1878 until his death in 1890, Frederic established twelve pubs which exclusively served his ale. This was the beginning of what was to become an estate of over 300 pubs across the North West of England and North Wales.

The Unicorn Brewery still rests on the foundations of the public house on Lower Hillgate in Stockport.

The brewery continues to be run by the fifth and sixth generations of the Robinson family. The company took over Hartley's Brewery in Ulverston in 1982, closing it and transferring the brewing of Hartley's beers to Stockport in 1991. Robinsons have acquired a number of other breweries over the years, including John Heginbotham, Stalybridge (1915); T. Schofield & Son, Ashton under Lyne (1926); Kays Atlas Brewery, Ardwick (1929) and Bell & Co, Stockport (1949).

The brewery owns many historic pubs, including the New Hall Inn in Bowness on Windermere.

Distribution 
The brewery supplies its own estate of just over 300 public houses, mostly in North West England, but including more than 30 in North Wales. It also sells to the free trade. In addition, the company provides casking, kegging and bottling services to other brewers from their site at Bredbury, a short distance from the main Unicorn Brewery.

The Unicorn Brewery is a traditional tower type and is one of the few such buildings still being used in its original capacity.
