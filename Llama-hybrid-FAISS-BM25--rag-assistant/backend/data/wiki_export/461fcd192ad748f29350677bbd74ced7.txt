Newbury Park High School, opened in 1967, is a co-educational public high school located in Newbury Park, California.

Academics

The school is one of two International Baccalaureate schools in Ventura County, the other being Rio Mesa High School.

In 2006, NPHS underwent a technological overhaul including the addition of new computers and the introduction of Zangle. Implemented at the beginning of the 2006-2007 academic year, Zangle is an online system by Aequitas Solutions for teachers to input and submit grading online, as well as allowing parents to access their child's attendance and grade information. In 2013, Zangle changed its name to "Q", but still performed the same tasks as before.

A second technological overhaul began in the 2015-2016 school year. This included boosted funding for the Panther TV student broadcast program, new Lenovo desktop computers with faster Intel cores and smaller frames, and purchase of charging station carts with Chromebooks or traditional laptops for every department. The school internet system was also revised to be faster, more bring-your-own-device friendly (in terms of ease of Wi-Fi connection), and better security blocks.

NPHS has a technology academy on campus known as the Digital Arts and Technology Academy, or "DATA." This program is for sophomores, juniors and seniors who are selected by faculty to join. The students are enrolled in English, Social Science, Science, and a Technology class together.
