NHL Live is a television show on NBC Sports Network. The program airs after every National Hockey League game the network televises as part of NHL on NBC. The postgame show was initially known as Hockey Central, airing from their Stamford, Connecticut studios. With the new contract with NBC beginning in the , the new pregame show is called NHL Live and the new postgame show is called NHL Overtime, which show the NHL on NBC studio host and analysts, from the NBC and Comcast (original owner of Versus) merger.

History
Hockey Central first aired on October 5, 2005.  Given the limited time to prepare the studio after OLN won the broadcasting rights of the NHL in the summer of 2005, the first set was extremely spartan. This served as the temporary home to Hockey Central until a permanent set could be built midway through the first season. The show is hosted by Bill Patrick and a rotating panel of analysts as they break down highlights of other games, show special features on NHL players, and debate key issues in the NHL. The format is similar to TNT's Inside the NBA. Sometimes, VERSUS airs a pre-game edition of the show, usually prior to a double-header. The show originally did not air after double-headers, instead it usually took place between games, but starting with the 2007–08 season, aired both in between and after doubleheaders, unless the early game goes to overtime. It is also known as the "Hockey Central Post Game Report" or just "Hockey Central".

The show was sponsored by eSurance during the 2006–07 season, and is now sponsored by Bud Light.

Hockey Central was first broadcast in HD on October 3, 2007.
