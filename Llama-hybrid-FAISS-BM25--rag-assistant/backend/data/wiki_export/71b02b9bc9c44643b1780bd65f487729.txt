Misc
As the village is lying next to the River Glomma, who is actually the longest river in Norway, it played some kind of a role during the World War II. By the riverside, there still is two or three bunkers left, which is fully accessible for casual tourists. To enter this bunkers, you have to head for the H. O. Torgersensvei, then Fortveien and just look for the coast. Eventually you can ask some friendly locals.

On the outskirts of the village, you can also find the headquarters of Kråkerøy MC-klubb.

Down by the riverside, there also is a highly recommended(?) beach called the Lieutenant Bay.
