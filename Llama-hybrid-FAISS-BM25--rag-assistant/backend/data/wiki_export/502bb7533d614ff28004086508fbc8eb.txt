Philip Phillips (11 August 1900 – 11 December 1994) was an influential archaeologist in the United States during the 20th century.   Although his first graduate work was in architecture, he later received a doctorate from Harvard University under advisor Alfred Marston Tozzer.  His first archaeological experiences were on Iroquois sites, but he specialized in the Mississippian culture, especially its Lower Mississippi Valley incarnation.

Career
In 1937, he was appointed assistant curator of Southeastern Archaeology at the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard.  In 1949, he became its curator; and remained an honorary curator from his 1967 retirement until his death.

His professional collaborations with James A. Ford, James Bennett Griffin, and Gordon Willey have become some of the standard works of American archaeology.

His professional obituary, including a summary of his life's accomplishments, was written by his lifelong colleague and collaborator Gordon R. Willey.  It was published in 1996 by the Society for American Archaeology. "

Phillips married Ruth Wilma Schoellkopf (daughter of business magnate Jacob F. Schoellkopf Jr.) in 1922 in Buffalo, New York. In 1942, the Phillips resided in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 1955 their son Bradley Sawyer Phillips (1929–1991) married the poet V. R. Lang (1924–1956).
