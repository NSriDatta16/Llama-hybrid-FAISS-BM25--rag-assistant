Military pay or military compensation is the pay system by which members of the military are compensated for their participation in the military.

As parts of government pay systems, military pay typically does not compete with private military compensation.

Because military service requires fit soldiers and commitments that might reach well beyond civilian employment, governments typically provided additional health care, military housing and retirement or veteran's benefits.
