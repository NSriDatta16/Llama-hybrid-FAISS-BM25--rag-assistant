History
Before 1984, SR 150 was a two-lane highway from the Bessemer city limits to Hoover. However, residential, commercial, and institutional growth has led to the city of Hoover widening the highway from US 31 to I-459. Work began in May 2006 to widen SR 150 to five lanes from I-459 to Ross Bridge Parkway, a distance of approximately .

Future
Future plans call for widening the entire highway, from Bessemer to Hoover, to five lanes.
