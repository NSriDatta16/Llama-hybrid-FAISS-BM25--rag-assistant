History

The village of Maklakov Lug (), later known as Maklakovo () existed on the territory of modern Lesosibirsk since 1640. In the early 20th century, Norwegian industrialist Jonas Lied established a wood processing plant here. The plant was nationalized after the revolution. After World War II, large wood-processing plants were built here. The Achinsk–Maklakovo railway connected the area with the Siberian Railway. Two new settlements, Novomaklakovo and Novoyeniseysk were built in the area. On February 21, 1975, the settlements of Maklakovo and Novomaklakovo were merged into the new town of Lesosibirsk. The settlement of Novoyeniseysk was merged into Lesosibirsk in 1989.
