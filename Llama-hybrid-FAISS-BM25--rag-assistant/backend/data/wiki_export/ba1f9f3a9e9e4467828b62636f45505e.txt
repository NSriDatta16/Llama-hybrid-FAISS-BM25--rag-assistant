Below are the squads for the 1950 FIFA World Cup final tournament in Brazil. This was the first World Cup where the players' jerseys featured back numbers (allowed in football since 1944), though no teams had fixed numbers for each player. (That would only be compulsory from the next World Cup, in 1954.) Thus, the players are ordered by name.

The only national team player who played his regular league football with a foreign club was George Robledo of Chile, who played in England's Football League First Division.
