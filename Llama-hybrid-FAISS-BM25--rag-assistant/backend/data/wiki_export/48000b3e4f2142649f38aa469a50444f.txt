Plot
Martin, who had previously tried to kill himself following the so-called "Eggroll Incident", has been released from the mental hospital. He goes back to work, where he designs corporate mascot costumes. He's not completely recovered yet, though, and is recommended to Dr. Orloff, who is possibly the worst doctor in the world. Martin's first appointment consists of a single question. They skip out on the rest of the appointment to go to a softball game, which Orloff drags Martin to. Screwball adventures ensue.
