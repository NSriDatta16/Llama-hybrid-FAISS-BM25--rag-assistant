Computerra () was a Russian computer weekly publication. The first edition was released on December 21, 1992 and was published by C&C Computer Publishing Limited (Computerra Publishing House). Later, it received the online counterpart at [www.computerra.ru], which supplements the contents of the publication; due to the financial problems and lack of advertisement material, the issue 811–812 on December 15, 2009 was announced as the last issue to be published offline, with only the online version remaining active. The last issue cover lacks a usual cover image, with only the black rectangle instead and the words roughly translatable as "now you can shut down your computerra", as a pun on the shutdown image of Windows 95.

The founder was Dmitriy Mendrelyuk. The magazine was headquartered in Moscow. There are some other magazines founded by him like Business-Journal ().

The typical audience of Computerra magazine includes the working men 25–34 years old, who have high social status, high or medium income level, and use computers.

The difference of Computerra from the most of other computer magazines is that this magazine not only writes about computer hardware and software, but writes philosophical thoughts about life, "computer people" life above all.
