Boulder is a suburb of Kalgoorlie in the Western Australian Goldfields,  east of Perth.

The Boulder (horse) Races were a significant event in early twentieth century goldfields region history.

The town maintained its separation from Kalgoorlie until the 1980s, however even prior to that era, many surveys and studies of the towns and their areas tended to join the names.

Prior to 1989, Boulder was a town, but it was merged with Kalgoorlie to form the City of Kalgoorlie–Boulder.

The population of Boulder in 1901 was 2,936 (1850 males and 1086 females), which increased to 5,658 (3090 males and 2568 females) in 1903.

At the 2006 census, Boulder had a population of 5,178. This had decreased to 4,825 by the 2016 census.

On 20 April 2010 Kalgoorlie-Boulder suffered a magnitude 5.0 earthquake which damaged several of the historic buildings in Boulder.
