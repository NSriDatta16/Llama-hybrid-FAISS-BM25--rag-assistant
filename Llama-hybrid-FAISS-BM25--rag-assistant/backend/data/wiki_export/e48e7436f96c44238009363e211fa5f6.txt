The Lutheran Women's Missionary League (LWML) is the official women's auxiliary of The Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod.

The national organization publishes the Lutheran Woman's Quarterly four times a year, and districts usually have their own newsletters.

Since 1998, the LWML has also been known as Lutheran Women in Mission.
