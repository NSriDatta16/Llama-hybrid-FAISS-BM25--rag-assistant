History
Since its establishment, the Accra Metropolitan District has gone through numerous changes with respect to jurisdictional boundaries and number of sub-metropolitan district councils.

Under the local government arrangements when the Accra city council was created in 1953, six area councils were established namely Ablekuma, Ashiedu Keteke, Ayawaso, Okaikoi, Osu Klotey and Kpeshie (which comprised Teshie, Nungua and La). This system operated until 18 March 1989 when Accra was elevated to metropolitan district status and the area councils became sub-metropolitan district councils under Legislative Instrument 1500 of the new Local Government System (PNDCL 207) Act 462.

In 2003, part of the first schedule of the Accra Metropolitan Legislative Instrument of 1995 (LI 161) was amended and replaced with Legislative Instrument 1722 of 2003 which led to the creation of 7 more sub-metropolitan districts out of the existing six. The Kpeshie sub-metropolitan district was split into the Nungua, Teshie and La sub-metropolitan districts; the Ablekuma sub-metropolitan district was split into the Ablekuma North, Ablekuma Central, and Ablekuma South sub-metropolitan districts; the Ayawaso sub-metropolitan district was split into the Ayawaso Central, Ayawaso East, and Ayawaso West sub-metropolitan districts; and the Okaikoi sub-metropolitan district was split into the Okaikoi North and Okaikoi South sub-metropolitan districts. This intervention was informed by the need to break up the metropolitan district into smaller sectors to facilitate good governance.

In 2007, to promote efficiency in the administrative machinery and also meet the ever pressing demands for amenities and essential services, the Teshie and Nungua sub-metropolitan districts were merged and upgraded to municipal Status in 2007 as the Ledzokuku-Krowor Municipal District under Legislative Instrument 1865. Later, in 2012, the La sub-metropolitan district was carved out of the Accra Metropolitan District to form the La Dade-Kotopon Municipal District under Legislative Instrument 2038,

In November 2017, the government laid before Parliament Legislative Instruments (LI) which elevated the Ablekuma North sub-metropolitan district to municipal status as the Ablekuma North Municipal Assembly, and carved out the western part of the Ablekuma South sub-metropolitan district to form the Ablekuma West Municipal Assembly. Additionally, the Ayawaso West, Ayawaso East, and part of the Ayawaso Central sub-metropolitan districts were carved out of the Accra Metropolitan Assembly to form the Ayawaso North, Ayawaso East and Ayawaso West Municipal Assemblies. The Okaikoi North sub-metropolitan district was also elevated to municipal status as the Okaikoi North Municipal Assembly.

Climate

The Accra Metropolitan district features a tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification Aw) that borders on a hot semi-arid climate (BSh). The average annual rainfall is about 730 mm, which falls primarily during Ghana's two rainy seasons. The chief rainy season begins in April and ends in mid-July, whilst a weaker second rainy season occurs in October. Rain usually falls in short intensive storms and causes local flooding in which drainage channels are obstructed.

Very little variation in temperature occurs throughout the year. The mean monthly temperature ranges from  in August (the coolest) to  in March (the hottest), with an annual average of . The "cooler" months tend to be more humid than the warmer months. As a result, during the warmer months and particularly during the windy harmattan season, the city experiences a breezy "dry heat" that feels less warm than the "cooler" but more humid rainy season.

As a coastal city, Accra is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and sea level rise, with population growth putting increasing pressure on the coastal areas. Drainage infrastructure is particularly at risk, which has profound implications for people's livelihoods, especially in informal settlements. Inadequate planning regulation and law enforcement, as well as perceived corruption in government processes, lack of communication across government departments and lack of concern or government co-ordination with respect to building codes are major impediments to progressing the development of Accra's drainage infrastructure, according to the Climate & Development Knowledge Network.

As Accra is close to the equator, the daylight hours are practically uniform during the year. Relative humidity is generally high, varying from 65% in the midafternoon to 95% at night. The predominant wind direction in Accra is from the WSW to NNE sectors. Wind speeds normally range between 8 and 16 km/h. High wind gusts occur with thunderstorms, which generally pass in squalls along the coast.

The maximum wind speed record in Accra is 107.4 km/h (58 knots). Strong winds associated with thunderstorm activity often cause damage to property by removing roofing material. Several areas of Accra experience microclimatic effects. Low-profile drainage basins with a north-south orientation are not as well ventilated as those oriented east-west.

Air is often trapped in pockets over the city, and an insulation effect can give rise to a local increase in air temperature of several degrees. This occurs most notably in the Accra Newtown sports complex areas.
