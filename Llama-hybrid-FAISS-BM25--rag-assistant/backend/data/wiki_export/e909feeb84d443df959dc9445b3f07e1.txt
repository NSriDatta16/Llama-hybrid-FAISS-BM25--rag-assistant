Nogob (), formerly known as Fik, is a zone in Somali Region of Ethiopia. Nogob Zone is bordered on the south by Gode, on the southwest by Afder Zone, on the west and northwest by the Oromia Region, on the north by Fafan, on the east by Jarar, and on the southeast by Korahe Zone. Erer River flows through this zone. Nogob has 9 woredas: Fik, Segeg, Garbo, Lagahida, Salehad, Hamero, duhun, Meyumuluku, Qubi and Goljano.

The Swiss section of Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) opened a clinic in the Zone, in December 2007, to provide medical services to local civilians affected by the local conflict between local insurgents and the Ethiopian government. However, constant administrative hurdles and intimidation towards MSF staff prevented the organization from providing an effective level of medical care, which ultimately caused MSF to withdraw from the Zone in July of the next year. "Over the six months of our intervention, our medical teams could only work for ten weeks in Fiiq town and five in the periphery of the town where the most important needs are," said Hugues Robert, head of the MSF Ethiopia program.
