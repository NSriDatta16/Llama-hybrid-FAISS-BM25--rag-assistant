History

Early history 
The first traces of settlement date back to the Celts period, evidenced by a series of burial mounds and a square enclosure.

A Roman military camps Fort Sulz was built around the year 74 AD on a hill south of the present-day town centre. Today, the Sulz-Kastell district with an industrial area is located there.

The first documented mention dates back to the year 790 as "villa publica Sulza". The town owes its name to its salt springs, which have shaped the town's history for centuries. The first owners of the saltworks were the Counts of Sulz in the 11th century. Probably from 1250 onwards, the Lords of Geroldseck ruled over the town and the salt works, while the Counts of Sulz were pushed back to marginal possessions; the process has not yet been fully explained. The domain of the counts of Sulz also included Loßburg and the valleys behind Schenkenzell.

The Lords of Geroldseck were also the builders of the Burg Albeck southwest of the city. In 1284 King Rudolf of Habsburg gave Sulz town privileges. Between 1301 and 1473 the town was the seat of the line of the Geroldseckers, who resided here, but despite some inheritances they experienced a steady economic decline in the 15th century and finally had to sell it to Württemberg under massive pressure in 1473.

The Lordship of the Geroldseckers after the expulsion of Duke Ulrich of Württemberg by the Swabian League in 1519 was only an interlude which ended in 1534 with the return of the duke. All that remained for the Geroldseckers was the title "von Geroldseck und Sulz". The city burned down almost completely within the city walls twice (1581 and 1794). It took two years to rebuild it; in the meantime it was plundered again and again by French soldiers.

The district Mühlheim was already mentioned in 772 as Muliheim in the Lorsch Codex.

19th and 20th century 
For a long time, Sulz in Württemberg was the only salt works in the state. When in 1803 the much more productive salt works on the Kocher became Württemberg, the town lost its economic status as a salt town, but remained the seat of the Oberamts Sulz, which in the early years of the Kingdom of Württemberg gained considerably in size in the course of the new administrative division of Württemberg. In 1867, the expansion of the Stuttgart–Horb railway line on the Horb to Talhausen section connected it to the network of the Royal Württemberg State Railways.

In 1938, during the administrative reform during the NS in Württemberg, the district of Sulz, which had emerged from the upper office of Sulz in 1934, was dissolved and became part of the district of Horb.

Towards the end of the Second World War, a subcamp of the Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp was established in Sulz am Neckar. In 1944, Gestapo men interrogated and tortured Polish forced labourers suspected of being associated with a resistance organisation in the former district court prison. At least seven of the detainees died in the process.

After the Second World War the city fell into the French occupation zone and thus in 1947 came to the newly founded state Württemberg-Hohenzollern, which was absorbed into the state of Baden-Württemberg in 1952.

During the district reform Sulz became part of the district of Rottweil. With the dissolution of the  district Südwürttemberg-Hohenzollern, which took place at the same time, Sulz became part of the  region of Freiburg.

From 1963 to 1993 there was a Bundeswehr depot in Sulz.

In remembrance of the former importance of salt extraction from brine, the swimming pool has been filled with brine since the construction of the new open-air pool and is thus the only brine open-air pool in the area.

Religions 
Since the Reformation Sulz has been protestant. The Lutheran parish of Sulz has seven parishes, and the districts of Fischingen and Glatt also have their own Lutheran parish. All together belong to the evangelic deanery of Sulz. The town is also the seat of the Sulz church district of the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Württemberg. The office of the school dean responsible for the Protestant church district Sulz a. N. is located in Freudenstadt. The Berneuchen Movement within the Protestant Church has its centre in the former Kirchberg convent.

The Roman Catholic Church first disappeared from Sulz during the Reformation upheavals of the 16th century. With the renewed influx of Catholics after the Second World War, however, a Catholic city parish was founded. The church St. Johannes Evangelist was built in 1950 according to the plans of the architect Hans Lütkemeier. The Catholic parish belongs to the deanery Rottweil.

In addition, the Volksmission entschiedener Christen, the Freie Baptisten Gemeinde Sulz, a New Apostolic Church, a congregation representing Jehovah's Witnesses and an Islam congregation exist.
