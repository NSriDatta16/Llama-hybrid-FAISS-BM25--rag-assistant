The International Relations Institute of Cameroon (French: Institut des Relations Internationales du Cameroun, IRIC) is one of the five Institutions of the University of Yaoundé II; it was created by decree of President Ahmadou Ahidjo on 24 April 1971. The organization of studies at the IRIC was renovated in 1993. Up until then, the Institute essentially focused on training diplomats. The new curriculum gives access to other international careers.

The IRIC serves African and world diplomacy and advocates excellence, a philosophy otherwise underpinning its own overall performances. The IRIC takes pride on its status as the oldest school of diplomacy south of Sahara, and brings the perceptions and the experiences of countries of the southern hemisphere to the world community.

The IRIC has Observer Status at all assemblies and summits of the African Union. Observer Status means that the IRIC has full diplomatic and delegate rights accorded to a member state of the African Union, with the exception that it may not cast votes
