History
In 1983, the Federal Communications Commission granted an application to Hualapai Broadcasters to build a new radio station on 105.9 MHz in Kingman, Arizona. The station went on air November 1, 1990, as KRCY with an oldies format.

In 2001, Spectrum Scan LLC purchased KRCY from Hualapai for $4 million. A translator was added in Las Vegas before Entravision acquired KRCY the next year for moving in to Las Vegas. It then changed the station's call sign to KQRT before announcing that it would move KRRN and its Spanish-language contemporary hit radio format from 105.1 MHz to 92.7 MHz.

The Fuego brand was rolled out to Las Vegas on March 29, 2021, replacing adult contemporary . Previous formats include adult hits as , Regional Mexican  ("The Cat"), and Spanish contemporary hit radio as .
