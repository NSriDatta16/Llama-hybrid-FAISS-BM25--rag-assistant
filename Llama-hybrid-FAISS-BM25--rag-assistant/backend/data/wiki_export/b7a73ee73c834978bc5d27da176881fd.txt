The Mall Fund owns and operates shopping centres in England using the trading name "The Mall Company". The shopping centres are usually branded and marketed as "the mall".

The Mall Fund owned up to 10% of the covered retail space in the United Kingdom, making it the largest portfolio of branded shopping centres in the United Kingdom, before some of its sites were sold off. The Fund is managed by a team of 62 from Capital & Regional's Mall Corporation.

The Fund was formed in March 2002, by Capital & Regional and Aviva Investors. New investors have come in as the portfolio has expanded, and a secondary market for the units has developed. The fund now has 45 investors, including three overseas institutions.

The Mall Fund has disposed of some of its centres, usually by selling the premises on to another operator or holding company.

The Mall Fund's most recent disposal was its shopping centre in Camberley, which was sold in 2016 and was renamed The Square in September 2017.
