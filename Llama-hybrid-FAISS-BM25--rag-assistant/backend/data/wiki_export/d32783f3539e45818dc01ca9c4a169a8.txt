Plot 

The story is about two twin brothers, Azriel and Gavriel (both played by Yehuda Barkan). Azriel is a shy and religious Jew who works in a fruit shop in Jaffa. Gavriel is a hoodlum and hustler who runs a snooker bar. Gavriel and his friend Hanuka make easy money by swindling innocent people into gambling on snooker games. One day Gavriel is forced to renew contact with his brother, because he is in trouble with a gangster who won the bet on a snooker game, and the only way to pay is by selling the family estate which is co-owned by the two brothers.
