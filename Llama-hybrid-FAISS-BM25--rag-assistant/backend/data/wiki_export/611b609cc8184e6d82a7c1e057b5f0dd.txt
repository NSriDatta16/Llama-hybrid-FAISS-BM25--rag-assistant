The indie rock band Umbrellas was formed in 2005 by former The Lyndsay Diaries frontman, Scott Windsor. After they fulfilled their contract with The Militia Group, freeing them up to record and release their Beach Front Property EP in June 2007. Their sound is, at times, very mellow and atmospheric, yet can also lean toward a more modern/electro-pop sound.  With their debut album recorded in a pseudo-haunted house, and their second album recorded in an abandoned comedy club, there are auras of emptiness and darkness swirling throughout the music. Their song "The City Lights" was featured during the climax of the Grey's Anatomy episode "Into You Like A Train," and "Ships" was featured during the Grey's Anatomy episode "Great Expectations, as well as the 7th episode of the 1st season of the tv series "Jericho"."
