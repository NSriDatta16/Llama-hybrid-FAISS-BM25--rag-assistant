Notes 
Two 7-Metre yachts were registered for the regattas of the 1908 Olympics. However, only one, Heroine, was present at the starting line. So she had each race a 'sail over'. Each match was therefore shortened to one round (). After 2 matches Heroine was certain of the victory and no third match was sailed.
