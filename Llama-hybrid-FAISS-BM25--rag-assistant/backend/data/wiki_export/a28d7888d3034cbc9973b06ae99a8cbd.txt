Career
In 2002–03, while Seegmiller completed her Master's Degree, she appeared on Broadway in Baz Luhrmann's production of La bohème in the leading role of Mimi, sharing in a special ensemble Tony Award. Ben Brantley of The New York Times noted, "The principals are, to a person, sexy, vital, utterly committed to the moment.... [At] the end of Act III... Jesús Garcia and Lisa Hopkins are affectingly somber... with resigned postures that suggest a haunted awareness of doom.... They brought tears to my eyes." Seegmiller also appears on the production's cast album, singing the final act, and she sang excerpts from the role at the televised performance during the 2003 Tony Awards ceremony at Radio City Music Hall.

Seegmiller was the soprano soloist in the Mozart Requiem and Mozart's Exsultate, jubilate with the Utah Symphony and Opera at the 2004 Deer Valley Music Festival.

Newsday wrote, "The only member of the cast to escape the director's unmusical ministrations was Lisa Hopkins, who, as Donna Anna, managed to ignore the squeezebox screeches coming from the pit and speakers and deliver a sensitive lament."<ref>Davidson, Justin.

In 2007, Opera News called Seegmiller "the kind of camera-ready young singer today's marketing directors dream of. ... Fortunately, unlike all too many so-termed 'total package' artists these days [she] can also sing." She sang the role of Sofia in Rossini's one-act opera Il Signor Bruschino with Gotham Chamber Opera in January 2007. Backstage commented on the performance, "soprano Lisa Hopkins as Sofia proves a deft comedian while singing with impressive flair." Seegmiller was also selected as a Wolf Trap Opera Company Filene Young Artist, singing the role of Corvina in John Musto's adaptation of Volpone (June, 2007) and the First Lady in Die Zauberflöte (August, 2007). The Washington Post wrote, "Lisa Hopkins Seegmiller, so expressive with her big Bette Davis eyes and fluttery voice, was deliciously funny as Corvina" (in Volpone) The recording of Volpone (and Seegmiller as a principal soloist) was nominated for the 2010 Grammy Award for Best Opera Recording. In December 2007, she was the soprano soloist in the Messiah in Greenwich, Connecticut.

The review in The Salt Lake Tribune commented that in the show's signature song, "Memory", she "creates a moment that's beautifully painful ... and melancholy with a glimmer of hope. Her voice seems to penetrate each word of the familiar lyrics, extracting the core meaning". In October 2011, Seegmiller performed at the Mentors International 2011 Gala.

In 2013, she revisited the role of Mimi in Utah Lyric Opera's production of La bohème and, immediately afterwards, in Sun Valley Opera's production in Idaho.
