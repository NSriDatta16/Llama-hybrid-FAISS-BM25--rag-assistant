La Nouvelle Revue Française (; "The New French Review") is a literary magazine based in France. In France, it is often referred to as the NRF.

History and profile
The magazine was founded in 1909 by a group of intellectuals including André Gide, Jacques Copeau, and Jean Schlumberger. It was established 'in opposition to other, more established, cultural institutions, most notably the Académie Française and its associated networks'.:4

In 1911, Gaston Gallimard became editor of the Revue, which led to the founding of the publishing house, Éditions Gallimard. During World War I its publication stopped. The magazine was relaunched in 1919.

Established writers such as Paul Bourget and Anatole France contributed to the magazine from its early days. The magazine's influence grew until, during the interwar period, it became the leading literary journal, occupying a unique role in French culture. The first published works by André Malraux and Jean-Paul Sartre were in the pages of the Revue.

During the occupation in the second world war Gide and Général de Gaulle gave explicit blessing to L'Arche (:fr:L'Arche (revue littéraire)), a literary review created by Jean Amrouche and edited by Edmond Charlot.<ref>JAFFEUX, V. 2016.L'Arche au milieu de la tempête.

L'Arche commenced in 1944 (issues 1–6) and finished in 1947 (issues 23–27). Montreal, Tangiers and Algiers in this period became literary francophone centres replacing Paris. After liberation of the whole of France, NRF was banned for collaborationism, but reopened in 1953 (initially with a "new" title: La Nouvelle Nouvelle Revue Française).

The Revue was a monthly for many years, but became a quarterly.
