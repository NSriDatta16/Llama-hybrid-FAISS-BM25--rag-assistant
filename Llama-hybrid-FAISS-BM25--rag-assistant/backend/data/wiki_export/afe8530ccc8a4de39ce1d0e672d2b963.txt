He coached the Sacramento Kings for two different stretches; once in 1987 and from 1988 through 1989.  He also served as the team's general manager. Jerry Reynolds served as general manager of the Sacramento Monarchs WNBA team, a post from which he retired in 2003.

Reynolds is from French Lick, Indiana, the same town as NBA legend Larry Bird.

In 2005, Jerry Reynolds wrote a book about his 20 years of experiences with the Kings called Reynolds Remembers Tales from the Sacramento Kings.

As of the 2016–17 NBA season, Reynolds is a broadcaster for the Kings, alongside Grant Napear, and its director of player personnel.

Prior to his NBA tenure, Reynolds enjoyed a successful coaching career in the college ranks; he was part of the staff at Vincennes University when the Trailblazers won the 1970 NJCAA National title.  Later, he was on Roger Kaiser's staff at West Georgia College when the Braves won the 1974 NAIA Division I men's basketball tournament.

He began his coaching career as the Freshmen Head Coach during the 1965–66 season, while completing his undergraduate degree. He then returned to Vincennes as an assistant, before joining Roger Kaiser's staff at West Georgia.  In 1975, he was named the head coach of the Rockhurst University Hawks; he joined the Kansas City Kings franchise in 1984.

Reynolds is a graduate of Vincennes University and Oakland City University; he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate in 1990 from Vincennes. He lives in Roseville, California with his wife Dodie; they married in 1968.
