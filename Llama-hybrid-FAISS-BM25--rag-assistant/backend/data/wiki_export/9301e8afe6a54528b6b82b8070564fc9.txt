History
Biwater was established in 1968 as Biwater Treatment Company in Beckenham, Kent, UK, by Adrian White with an authorised share capital of £100. The name 'Biwater' was derived from the idea of working with 'two waters', the treatment of wastewater and the provision of clean drinking water.

In 1971, Biwater set up its global headquarters in Dorking, Surrey.

In the early 1970s, Biwater identified the need to develop scalable water and wastewater treatment plants.

After a number of acquisitions in 1986, Biwater developed a collective brand identity and launched the Biwater fish logo.
