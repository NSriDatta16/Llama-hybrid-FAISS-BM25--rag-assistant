The Mỹ Thuận Bridge () is a cable-stayed bridge over the Mekong river, connecting Cái Bè District of Tiền Giang Province with Vĩnh Long City of Vĩnh Long Province in Vietnam. It was developed in a joint venture between the governments of Australia and Vietnam. The bridge was the largest overseas assistance project undertaken by the Australian government costing A$91 million.

It was built by Baulderstone and completed in 2000.

Political issues behind the bridge project are recounted by Sue Boyd, Australian ambassador to Vietnam at the time, in her autobiography.
