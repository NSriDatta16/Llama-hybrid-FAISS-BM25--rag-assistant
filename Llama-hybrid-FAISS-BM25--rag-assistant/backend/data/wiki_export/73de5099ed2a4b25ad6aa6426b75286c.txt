Pukyong National University (PKNU) is a national university in Busan, South Korea, formed in 1996. The university has two campuses, Daeyeon-dong and Yongdang-dong, situated near the coastal district of Nam-gu. PKNU has a traditional focus on fisheries sciences and other maritime fields, and has extensive facilities for Marine and Technology studies. 

The school's symbol mascot is anthropomorphic Moby Dick, "Baek Kyung-i". The school name was changed through a vote in August 2021.

History
PKNU was formed in 1996 from the merger of two national universities with long histories, the National Fisheries University of Busan, established in 1941, and the Busan National University of Technology, which was established in 1924. 

Historically, Daeyeon-dong was a small fishing village populated by anchovy fishermen. In the early years of the 20th century these fishermen found their products in high demand and they became quite wealthy. They used the money to purchase what is now the Daeyeon-dong campus site and donated it to the government, under the condition that it be used to establish a training centre for their industry. During the Korean War, the Daeyeon campus was used as an airfield by the U.S. Air Force. Local residents constructed a large Dol-Jip "stone house" for the commanding officers and pilots. Today this building is used as a student cafeteria.

Before Integration (~1996)

National Fisheries University of Busan 
The National Fisheries University of Busan was the only higher education institution located in South Gyeongsang Province in Korea under Japanese rule and 5 years after liberation. The other higher education institutes were located in Keijō(4 academies), North Korea region, and South regions including Keijō Imperial University. In 1944, it was renamed Pusan Fisheries University and established Fisheries college in Shimonoseki, Yamaguchi (city). 

On 15 May 1946, when Pusan National University was established, it was integrated into the Department of Fisheries. When it came to July 1947, it became an independent university and was promoted to National Fisheries University of Pusan. Immediately after 16 May 1961, it was forcibly integrated into PNU due to external pressure from the government but separated again from PNU in 1964.

On 6 November 1986, the Department of Fisheries and Oceanography, Science and Engineering, and Social Science were established, and on 1 March 1990, it was promoted to a comprehensive university and reorganized into nine departments (University of Fisheries and Maritime Affairs, College of Natural Sciences, College of Engineering, and College of Humanities and Social Sciences and more). On 1 March 1996, 6 universities and 39 departments were established, 29 master's courses were established in graduate schools, 23 doctoral courses, 4 majors in graduate schools of education, and 16 master's courses in graduate schools of industry.

Busan National University of Technology 
The university was established in Bosu-dong, Jung-gu on 5 May 1924, in the name of Pusan Public Industrial Continuation School (two-year system). The Temporary Special Act on Education and Education was abolished in 1963, which increased the need for higher education. On 29 September 1973, the school was approved for establishment as the National Pusan Technical School (5-year system). 

7 December 1983, eight departments were established, approved for promotion and reorganization as Pusan Open University (4-year system). On 4 May 1988, the school name was changed to Pusan National University of Technology. 

On 6 March 1990, the Graduate School of Industrial Technology was newly established and five departments were opened. On 24 February 1993, the school name was changed to Pusan National University of Technology, after being promoted to a general university. On 1 March 1996, Pusan National University of Technology was integrated into PKNU.

After Integration 
On 6 July 1996, Pusan National University of Fisheries and Pusan National University of Technology were integrated and established with approval for the establishment of Pukyong National University (58 departments under 6 universities), with 31 master's courses, four master's courses in education, and 31 master's courses in the industry. The school name change was discussed from the days of Pusan National University of Fisheries, which was promoted to a general university before the integration, but the school name Pusan National University of Fisheries was used until it was integrated without approval from the Ministry of Education at the time.

In 1996, the International Exchange Center and the European Information Center were established, and in 1997, the University Fisheries Science Research Institute Vancouver was established, and in 1998, a joint laboratory in Daeyeon Campus was established. In 1999, the BK21 Regional Leading Machinery Industry Human Resources Development Project Group was established, and the Pukyong National University Lifelong Education Center was established.

At present, there are around 26,000 students and 544 professors across the two campuses, which together cover 673,899 m2. There are three large libraries, two in Daeyeon Dong and one in Yongdang Dong. The campuses are about 4 km apart. A free shuttle bus connects them in about 10–15 minutes.

Although primarily a fisheries university, PKNU has six colleges including a large humanities and social sciences department, four graduate programs with masters courses in 60 departments in 15 interdisciplinary programs, and doctoral courses in 56 departments and 12 interdisciplinary programs. In addition, there are eight research institutes.
