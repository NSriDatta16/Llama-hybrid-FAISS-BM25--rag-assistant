Den blomstertid nu kommer (, and in Finnish Suvivirsi, , or Jo joutui armas aika, ) is a Swedish summertime hymn, traditionally credited to Israel Kolmodin after walking at Hångers källa outside Visby. It was first published in the 1695 Swedish Hymnal, and the Finnish translation was made for the 1701 Finnish Hymnal by Erik Cajanus.

In Sweden and Finland the hymn is traditionally sung at the end of the school year, before the summer holidays, and as such it has reached widespread recognition in both Finnish and Swedish culture. It is strongly associated with summer, as well as primary and secondary education.

The number of verses sung in schools varies, but tends not to include all six. In Sweden, only the first verse is sometimes used, in which the hymn's Christian origins are not apparent. In Finnish-speaking Finland, the hymn is usually sung in three verses in schools.

Zenos E. Hawkinson has written lyrics in English, as "Now Comes the Time for Flowers", from 1978.
