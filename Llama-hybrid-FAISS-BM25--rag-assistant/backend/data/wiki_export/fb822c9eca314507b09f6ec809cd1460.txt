Killman Zoo is a privately owned zoo approximately  north of Caledonia in Haldimand County, Ontario, Canada.

History 
Killman Zoo was founded by the wildlife artist Murray Killman. Murray obtained his first big cat, a cougar named Maggie, in 1979, who became the subject of many paintings. Throughout the 1980s, Murray acquired more big cats, and numerous enclosures were built to house them. Murray's property soon became known as Killman's Wildlife Sanctuary. In 1982, Murray's son, Mark, began giving tours of the property by appointment. By 1987, the idea came about to convert Killman's Wildlife Sanctuary into a zoo open to the public. Killman Zoo officially opened on April 1, 1988. Since 1988, the zoo has continued to expand. As of 2020, the zoo spanned 33 acres and housed animals of 45 different species.

In 2022, the Killman Zoo, along with ten other Ontario zoos, was named in report by the Canadian branch of the non-profit group World Animal Protection. The report, submitted to the Provincial Animal Welfare Services (a government body tasked with overseeing animal welfare laws in Ontario), mainly raised concern about enclosure size, and lack of space for big cats to remove themselves from public view. Owners Joanne and Mark Killman, in an interview with the Hamilton Spectator, affirmed that the welfare of their animals is a top priority, and explained that while the zoo is continually working to improve enclosures, the budget must prioritize the animals' medical costs. The two also stated that the zoo is regularly licensed and inspected by the Provincial Animal Welfare Services.
