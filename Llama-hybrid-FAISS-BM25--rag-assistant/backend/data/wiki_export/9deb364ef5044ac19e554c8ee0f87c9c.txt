Copper Mountain (a Club Med Experience) (also known as just Copper Mountain) is a 1983 Canadian comedy film written and directed by Damian Lee and David Mitchell. Starring Jim Carrey and Alan Thicke, it is a quasi-commercial for the now-defunct Club Med ski resort in Copper Mountain, Colorado. The majority of the runtime consists of interspersed performances by prominent country and rhythm and blues musicians, such as Ronnie Hawkins, Rita Coolidge and Chicago frontman Bill Champlin, with whom accomplished song writer Thicke co-wrote the popular song "Sara".

Plot
Two friends, Bobby Todd (Carrey) and Jackson Reach (Thicke), travel from their hometown of Grimsby to the Club Med village in Copper Mountain. Jackson intends to hit the slopes and ski, while Bobby attempts to seduce women with impressions and routines. Eventually, Jackson wins a challenge race, and Bobby finds companionship by being himself.
