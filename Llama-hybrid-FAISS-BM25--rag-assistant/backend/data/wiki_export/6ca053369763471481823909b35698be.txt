Krachi West District is one of the eight districts in Oti Region, Ghana. Originally it was formerly part of the then-larger Krachi District on 10 March 1989, which was established by Legislative Instrument (L.I.) 1501, until the eastern part of the district was split off to create Krachi East District on 4 August 2004 (which was later elevated to municipal district assembly status to become Krachi East Municipal District on 14 November 2017 (effectively 15 March 2018); which was established by Legislative Instrument (L.I.) 2281), which was established by Legislative Instrument (L.I.) 1747; thus the remaining part has been renamed to become Krachi West District. However, on 28 June 2012, the northern part of the district was split off to create Krachi Nchumuru District, which was established by Legislative Instrument (L.I.) 2078; thus the remaining part has been retained as Krachi West District. The district assembly is located in the northern part of Oti Region and has Kete Krachi as its capital town.
