"Shoo-Be-Doo-Be-Doo-Da-Day" is a 1968 single released by American and Motown recording artist Stevie Wonder. The song, co-written by Wonder and produced by Henry Cosby and Sylvia Moy, was the first to showcase Wonder's talents at the clavinet and was one of his first successful co-written tracks during his 1960s Motown period. The song reached number nine on the Billboard Hot 100 pop singles chart in 1968, and went to number one on the R&B chart.

Billboard described the single as "a groovy rock number loaded with teen sales appeal."  Cash Box said it was a "delighting combination of Detroit and Gospel strains" with a "generally relaxed rock mood with snatches of fire from the ork build and outstanding vocal."

"Shoo-Be-Doo-Be-Doo-Da-Day" was one of the first songs to use a clavinet in a popular music recording.
