The Consultative Assembly (; transcription: Majlis al-Shura) is the lower house of the Council of Oman. It is the only legislative body in Oman of which all members are democratically elected. The other chamber of the parliament is the Council of State (Majlis al-Dawla).

The assembly consists of 86 elected members. Each wilayah (province) in Oman is entitled to at least one representative in the assembly. Provinces with a population of 30,000 or above are represented by two members, while provinces with fewer than 30,000 inhabitants are represented by only one member. The winning candidates are the ones who obtain the higher number of votes according to the official election results. Oman does not allow political parties. Thus, only non-partisans have been elected.

History
Before 1981, the Majlis al-Shura (Consultative Council) was a unicameral legislature of the Imamate of Oman until its dissolution in 1959.

Legislative process
As mentioned in the Basic Law of the State (de facto constitution), the Council of Oman has some legislative and oversight powers. The Council of Ministers (the main executive branch) must have to refer draft laws to the Assembly, which has to approve or amend it within a maximum of three months from the date of referring. Then it is referred to the State Council which has to approve or amend it. If the two chambers disagree, they take vote to resolve the difference. However, if any bill passes both chambers, it must be approved and signed by the Sultan to become a law. The assembly has the exclusive power of interpellation to any of the services ministers.

Requirements
