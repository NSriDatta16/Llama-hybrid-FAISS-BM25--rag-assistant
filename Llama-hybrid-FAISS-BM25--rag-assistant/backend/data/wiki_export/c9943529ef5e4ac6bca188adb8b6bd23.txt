Lameco Eskrima is the system of Filipino martial arts founded by Edgar Sulite based on his training and experience with various Philippine Martial Arts masters, with heavy influence from Jose Caballero and Antonio Ilustrisimo.

The word Lameco is actually a combination of words which are the three basic ranges of combat involved in the study and practice of Lameco Eskrima - Largo, Medio and Corto (Long, Middle, and Close).

The LAMECO logo represents the following items.

Lameco Eskrima Training
One of the characteristics of Filipino martial arts is the use of weapons from the very beginning of training. The primary weapon is a rattan stick, also called a cane or baston. These sticks vary in length from about 26 inches to as much as 38 inches in length or more. The weapons can vary in weight and thickness depending on the preference of the practitioner.

Lameco uses Double and single Stick, Double and single Dagger, Stick and Dagger, Sword, Staff,
Handkerchief, and Empty Hands.

Lameco Eskrima is a synthesis of five major systems of Eskrima:

 De Campo Uno-Dos-Tres Orihinal (GM Jose Caballero)
 Kali Illustrisimo (GM Antonio Ilustrisimo)
 Kali Pekiti-Tirsia (Tuhon Leo Tortal Gaje Jr.)
 Modernos Largos (GM Jesus Abella & GM Pablicito “Pabling” Cabahug)
 Sulite Rapelon (GM Helacrio Sulite Sr.)

Six minor systems of Eskrima:

 Doce Pares (GM Diony Canete)
 Balintawak (GM Johnny Chiuten)
 Lapunti Arnis De Abanico (GM Felimon E. Caburnay)
 Siete Teros Serado - Serado no Puede Entra (GM Marcilino Ancheta)
 Abanico De Sungkiti (GM Billy Baaclo)
 Tres Personas Eskrima De Combate (GM Maj. Timoteo E. Maranga)

Uncredited Influences on the Lameco Eskrima System:

 Moro-Moro System (Master Andrew Abrian)
 Simaron Style (GM Abdul Hai Qahar Madueño)

Lameco employs training drills called Laban Laro (Play Fighting). Laban Laro allows the eskrimador to come as close to real combat as possible without injury. It is also designed to get an uncountable number of repetitions in a short period of time.

Through his constant efforts for developing new training innovations, Edgar devised unique armor for the hands and forearms that allowed practitioners to safely train more realistically.

Lameco striking system is largely based on striking employed in Caballero system with a few modifications. Striking system consists of twelve strikes in a pattern that facilitates the flow between strikes

History
At a young age Edgar Sulite's father exposed him to the Filipino Martial Arts, himself being a boxer and Arnisador. Growing up in the Barrios of the Philippines, Edgar witnessed many skirmishes settled blade against blade.

Edgar trained with martial arts masters who included Leo Gaje of Pekiti-Tirsia, Jose Caballero of De Campo Uno-Dos-Tres Orehenal, Jesus Abella of Modern Largos, Antonio Ilustrisimo of Kali Illustrisimo and many others.

In 1981, he moved to Manila to train under Grandmaster Antonio Ilustrisimo. After relocating to the United States on June 30, 1989, he became instructor to Dan Inosanto and Larry Hartsell.

Recognizing the talent and knowledge that Edgar possessed, Dan Inosanto would become a lifetime student and an advocate of the Lameco system.

Punong Guro Edgar Sulites wife Felisia Sulite appointed Leonard Trigg as president and Dan Inosanto as Vice President of Lameco Eskrima International quite a few years after Punong Guros death.
