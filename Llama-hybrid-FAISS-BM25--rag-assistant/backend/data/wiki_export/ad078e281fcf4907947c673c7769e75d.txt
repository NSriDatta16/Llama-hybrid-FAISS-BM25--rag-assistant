Nicholas Flanagan (born 13 June 1984) is an Australian professional golfer.

Flanagan was born in Belmont, New South Wales. He won the 2003 U.S. Amateur, the first non-American winner since 1971. He was awarded the 2003 Australian Young Male Athlete of the Year. He turned professional in 2004.

Flanagan currently plays on the Nationwide Tour. He achieved his first professional win at the 2005 Queensland Masters, which is part of the PGA Tour of Australasia's developmental series known as the Von Nida Tour.

In 2007, Flanagan won back-to-back starts on the Nationwide Tour, the Henrico County Open and the BMW Charity Pro-Am at The Cliffs. A third win later that year at the Xerox Classic, gave Flanagan an automatic "battlefield promotion" to the PGA Tour. Flanagan recorded two top 20 finishes in his first two starts on the PGA Tour as an official member. He finished tied for 18th and tied for 17th in two Fall Series events. He was voted the 2007 Nationwide Tour Player of the Year. Flanagan's first full year on the PGA Tour was in 2008, where he finished 169th. His finish was not good enough to retain his tour card and he returned to the Nationwide Tour for 2009.
