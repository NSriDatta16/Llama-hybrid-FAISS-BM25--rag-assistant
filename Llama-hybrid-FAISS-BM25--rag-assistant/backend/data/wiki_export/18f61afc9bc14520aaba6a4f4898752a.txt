Controversy 
BAPco has suffered criticism for bias in its benchmarking products. It was found in 2002 that Intel was the sole contributor to a series of CPU tests, tests which heavily favoured their own CPU's vs competitors, where the tests of the year before performed significantly better on non-Intel parts. Intel was investigated by the FTC, and eventually fined for this action, among other anti-competitive measures.
