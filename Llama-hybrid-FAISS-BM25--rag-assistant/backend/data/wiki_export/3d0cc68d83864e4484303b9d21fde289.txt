Banyo is a northern suburb in the City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. In the , Banyo had a population of 5,868 people.

It is a community split between residential and industrial land usage, the latter being attracted by the accessibility of local transport, including the Gateway Motorway.

Geography
Banyo and the neighbouring suburb Nudgee, with which it is intertwined in many respects, are both rich in local history. This history includes the recent preservation of an Aboriginal Bora Ring. The areas of Nudgee and Nudgee Beach border on the Boondall Wetlands, which is protected by the Brisbane City Council.

Banyo has vastly increased the number of its business and industrial parks in recent years due to its close proximity to Brisbane Airport and the nearby Port of Brisbane. Nudgee Road is progressively becoming a commercial hub due to its connection to the Gateway Motorway, with a large service centre and petrol station and with new industrial grounds under construction overlooking the motorway itself.

The Australian Catholic University chose to establish its Brisbane campus on the site of the former Pius XII Seminary. The opening of a Woolworths Supermarket also boosted the Banyo housing market.

A residential estate, 'Couture', has been developed on the site of an old Army depot lying adjacent to the Golden Circle cannery based in next-door Northgate. Another new residential estate, 'Summerlin' has also recently been constructed on a former Hills Hoist manufacturing plant.

The Shorncliffe railway line enters the suburb from the west (Virginia) and exits to the north (Boondall). The suburb is served by Banyo railway station at the intersection of Royal Parade and St Vincents Road ().

Banyo's commercial centre (the area surrounding Banyo railway station) has recently been enhanced following a Brisbane City Council Suburban Community Improvement Project (SCIP).

History 
Originally inhabited by the native Turrbal tribe, the area became known as Clapham Junction once the suburb was settled by Europeans in 1849. It was not until 1897 when it officially adopted the name Banyo, an Aboriginal word which means a hill or ridge. The name was chosen by the Secretary for Railways James Dickson, and was also given to the Banyo railway station. The hill that it was named after no longer exists, having been quarried for the construction of Eagle Farm Airport during World War II.
