Álvaro or Álvar (, , ) is a Spanish, Galician and Portuguese male given name and surname (see Spanish naming customs) of Visigothic origin. Some claim it may be related to the Old Norse name Alfarr, formed of the elements alf "elf" and arr "warrior", but the absence of Visigothic names containing the particle "alf" or "elf" evident in Kremer's Onomastik suggests that it may come from other forms, like "all" and maybe "ward".
