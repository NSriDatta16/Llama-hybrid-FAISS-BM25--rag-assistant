The House of Hrvatinić was a Bosnian medieval noble family that emerged in Donji Kraji county, located in today's territory of western Bosnia and Herzegovina. Principally they were vassals to Kotromanić dynasty of the Banate of Bosnia and Kingdom of Bosnia, occasionally also to the Kingdom of Hungary, changing loyalties between Hungarian kings Ladislaus of Naples and Sigismund of Luxembourg, and finally the Ottoman Empire (1472–1476). They rose to prominence in the second half of the 14th century, and attained its peak under magnate Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić (1350–1416), who also held large swaths of Dalmatia and obtained title of Grand Duke of Bosnia in 1380. 

Its eponymous founder was Hrvatin Stjepanić ( 1299–1304), a count and holder of possession in parts of "Donji Kraji" () and "Zapadne Strane" (), and a vassal of Croatian magnate Paul I Šubić of Bribir. Hrvatin's sons was part of a coalition of Bosnian and Slavonian nobility that revolted against Mladen II Šubić of Bribir between 1316 and 1317. From around 1322 the family submitted to the Kotromanić dynasty of the Banate of Bosnia. In 1363, the Hrvatinić supported Tvrtko I of Bosnia against Hungary, after which they came up through the ranks in Bosnia, while their most prominent member, Hrvoje Vukčić, along with major new possessions in Donji Kraji and Zapadne Strane was awarded with the title Grand Duke of Bosnia. In c. 1387, while loyal to Tvrtko I, they supported rebellion in Dalmatia against Sigismund. The last member of the family was Matija Vojsalić who was last mentioned in the archives of Republic of Ragusa in 1476. He was installed as a puppet king of Bosnia by the Ottoman sultan as an answer to Nicholas of Ilok, named king of Bosnia by Matthias Corvinus. Matija Vojsalić was removed after conspiring with Matthias Corvinus against the Ottomans and was not mentioned after that.
