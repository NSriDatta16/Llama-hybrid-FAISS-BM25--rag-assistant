"Dangerous" is a song by American rapper Busta Rhymes. It was released as the second single from his second studio album When Disaster Strikes... on November 18, 1997, by Flipmode Entertainment and Elektra Records. The song was written by Rhymes and its producer Rashad Smith. Since the song contains a sample of the Extra T's 1982 song "E.T. Boogie", two of the song's writers, Henry Stone and Freddy Stonewall, are also credited as songwriters on "Dangerous".

Peaking at #9 on the Billboard Hot 100, it was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 41st Grammy Awards in 1999, but lost to "Gettin' Jiggy wit It" by Will Smith. The video was directed by Hype Williams.

Composition and lyrics
"Dangerous" was composed in  time and the key of B-minor, with a tempo of 103 beats per minute. It has a duration time of three minutes and twenty seconds. The chorus of the song (This is serious/We could make you delirious/You should have a healthy fear of us/'Cause too much of us is dangerous) was taken from a 1980s PSA produced by Kids Corner Ltd of Colorado Springs, Colorado that warned children about the danger of loose prescription medications.
The rhythm track was sampled from the 1982 song "E.T. Boogie" by the Extra T's.

Music video
The video takes several cues from Lethal Weapon with Busta made to look like Mel Gibson (Riggs) and Spliff Star to look like Gary Busey (Mr. Joshua). The second verse also references the scene where Riggs is electrocuted, and ends with a confrontation between Busta and himself, this time dressed as Sho'nuff from The Last Dragon.
