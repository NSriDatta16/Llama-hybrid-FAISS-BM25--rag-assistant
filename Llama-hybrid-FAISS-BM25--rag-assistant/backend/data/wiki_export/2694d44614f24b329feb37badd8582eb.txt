Mavin Foundation is a community organization which seeks to build "healthy communities that celebrate and empower mixed heritage people and families." Located in Seattle, WA, Mavin has been recognized nationally for its work toward a society inclusive of those in the mixed heritage community. Mavinâ€™s current projects include Mavin Magazine, The Generation MIX National Awareness Tour, and The MatchMaker Bone Marrow Donor Project.

In 2004, The Association of MultiEthnic Americans and Mavin partnered to launch The Mixed Heritage Center, a national clearing house of information related to mixed race and transracial adoption issues.

History
MAVIN initially began in 1998 as a "national magazine dedicated to the mixed race experience." The magazine was named MAVIN (Yiddish for one who understands) by then Wesleyan University freshman Matt Kelley. In 2000, the magazine became a 501(c)3 nonprofit, intent on expanding their programming to further impact the social and political state of the mixed heritage community.
