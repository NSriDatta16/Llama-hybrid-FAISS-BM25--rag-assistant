Statistics

Accidents and incidents
 UTA Flight 141: On 25 December 2003, the airplane crashed in the Bight of Benin, killing 151 of the 163 occupants, most of them Lebanese.

Replacement
In 1974, it was decided to move the operations of the Cotonou international airport to a new facility in Glo-Djigbé. Lack of funding quickly stopped the project.

Plans were revived in 2011, and President Yayi Boni presided at a ceremonial start to the construction of the new airport, using South African funding. Construction on the new facility appears to have stalled again.

Meanwhile, improvements to the Cotonou airport were initiated.
