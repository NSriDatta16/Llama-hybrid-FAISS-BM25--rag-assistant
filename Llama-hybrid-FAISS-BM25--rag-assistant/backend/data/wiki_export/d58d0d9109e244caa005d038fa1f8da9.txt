Reception 

Compute! complimented Life & Deaths graphics and sound, stating that the game effectively used CGA's four colors and the PC speaker, and stated that the game's warning to those queasy of blood was accurate. An author on Gamasutra praised the game for its attention to detail and the way it offers significant depth and challenge despite only the mouse.

Macworld reviewed the Macintosh version of Life & Death, noting its gore and level of difficulty, stating that "If the embossed photo of a bloody brain on the box doesn't get to you, the challenge and frustration of playing the game just might." Macworld praises Life & Death's difficulty and educational value, but criticized the "annoying" copy protection, monochrome graphics, and lack of a save function. The reviewer for Macworld is stated to be a doctor of medicine.

Life & Death was nominated for Software Publishers Association (SPA) awards for Best Game, Best Simulation and Best Use of Technology.
