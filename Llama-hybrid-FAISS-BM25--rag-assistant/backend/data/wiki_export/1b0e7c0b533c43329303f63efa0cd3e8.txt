Parish Church of St Hermes
St Hermes' Church, St Erme was rebuilt in 1819-20 by John Foulston (apart from the tower which is medieval). The font is Norman and there is a brass of 1596 to R. Trencreek and family. According to Charles Henderson "The long incumbencies of two wealthy and scholarly rectors in the 18th century reduced the fabric of the church to such a ruinous condition that it had to be rebuilt in 1820, when a new plan was unhappily chosen. Efforts were made to reconcile this with older work in 1908."

Cornelius Cardew (d. 1831) served as curate and as rector of the parish altogether for 60 years and his portrait is in the church.
