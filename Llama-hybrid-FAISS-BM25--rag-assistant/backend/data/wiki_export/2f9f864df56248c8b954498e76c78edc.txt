Actual Sounds + Voices is the sixth studio album by electronic music group Meat Beat Manifesto, released in 1998.

Like its predecessor, Subliminal Sandwich, the album deeply intertwines multiple forms of electronic music with live instruments such as the bass clarinet, saxophone, drums and Fender Rhodes. However, Actual Sounds + Voices is more influenced by jazz, coupled with a darker tone and characterized by persistent erratic breakbeats.

The single "Prime Audio Soup" is featured in a scene of the 1999 film The Matrix and appears on the film's soundtrack.
