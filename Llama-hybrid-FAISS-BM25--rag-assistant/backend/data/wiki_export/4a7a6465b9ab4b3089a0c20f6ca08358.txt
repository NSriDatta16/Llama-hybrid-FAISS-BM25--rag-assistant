"Aún Hay Algo" is a song recorded by Mexican pop group RBD, released as the second single from the band's second studio album Nuestro Amor , on 18 November 2005. The song went number 1 in Mexico in December. It served as the second intro to the Mexican telenovela Rebelde in its second season.

Background and release 
"Aún Hay Algo" was released alongside its parent album Nuestro Amor, in September 2005, and later as the record's second single in 18 November. It was used as the second theme song for the telenovela Rebelde, where the group originated from. The band recorded a Portuguese version of the song, titled "Venha de Novo O Amor" (Spa. "Vendrá de Nuevo El Amor"; Eng. "Love Will Return"), which was released as a single in Brazil. It was part of Nosso Amor Rebelde, the Portuguese version of the album. Later, Brazil would have the acoustic version of "Aún Hay Algo", taken from the band's second live album, Live in Hollywood, released as a single to promote the project in the country; the official single from Live in Hollywood everywhere else was "No Pares".

Composition and lyrics 
"Aún Hay Algo" is a latin pop and teen pop that runs for three minutes and 34 seconds. It was written by Carlos Lara and Karen Sokoloff, with production from Pedro Damián. The song is structured in verse-pre-chorus-chorus form, with a bridge between the last two choruses. The voice of Mexican singer-songwriter Lynda Thomas is heard during the pre-chorus and chorus, and also doing harmonies for Christopher during his solo and for Dulce during the bridge.

The first verse is sung by Dulce María and Alfonso; the former feels that "there's something growing" between her and her lover, while the latter says that they "have a past, that maybe won't happen to us again". On the pre-chorus, Anahí and Christian state that even though "there is a goodbye difficult to forget" there's "also a love that can do miracles". During the chorus, Anahí, Dulce, and Christian are hopeful that their respective ex-partners "think of [them]" and "maybe between the two, there's still some love". In the second verse, Maite believes that "there's old feelings" between her and her ex-lover, while Christopher acknowledges that they "have a story, that left us in the middle of loneliness". During the bridge, Dulce begs her ex-partner to "look at [her] well", as she's "dying, to find [him] within [her]", and asks him to listen to her, before claiming "I don't how how to live without you".

Chart performance
The song debuted at number 36 on Billboard's Hot Latin Songs chart, as a 'Hot Shot Debut' in early March 2006. The song later peaked at number 24 in April 2006.

Music video
The music video for "Aún Hay Algo" was directed by Pedro Damián, being his fourth time directing an RBD video. Even though it premiered in November 2005, it still enjoyed a remarkable success during the first 3 months of 2006.
 
The video is mainly about what every member of RBD does before performing in one of their concerts. It features the band experiencing surreal journeys through different parts of a theater. Lastly, the video shows footage of what an actual RBD concert looks like.
