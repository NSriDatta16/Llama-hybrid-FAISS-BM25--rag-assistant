The Accent Radio Network was a Rhode Island-based radio network from 2000â€“2016.

History 
Accent Radio Network was founded  in the summer of 2000 by James and Patricia Feijo and went on air December 4, 2000. The Accent Radio Network aired programming original to the network as well as syndicated programs including; The Laura Ingraham Show and Monica Crowley.

Programming from Accent Radio Network, which included some talk radio format programs, was carried by 18 affiliates located across the United States, mostly very small stations located in small markets. These affiliates were especially concentrated in Missouri (three affiliates), Utah (two affiliates), and the Southeastern United States (nine affiliates). ARN programming was available at no charge to affiliates. ARN also provided listeners in extended areas with audio streaming via the World Wide Web, consumer Digital Video Broadcasting satellite, and a Roku channel.

James and Patricia Feijo were hosts of a program on the network called HealthWatch which promotes a "God-centered view of health and healing." In May 2012, a U.S. District Court judge found that the Feijos had violated an injunction against making claims on their radio show and websites for the cancer-curing effects of natural products sold through their business, Daniel Chapter One.  Jerry Hughes, the network's most prominent non-brokered host, died three weeks later on June 1.
