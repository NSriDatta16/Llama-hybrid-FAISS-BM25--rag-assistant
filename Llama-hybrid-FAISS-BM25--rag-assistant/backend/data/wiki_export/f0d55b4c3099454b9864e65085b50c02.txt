Sing Again with The Chipmunks is Alvin and the Chipmunks' second album, released by Liberty Records in January 1960. The album follows the same format as their first album, and contains the group's fifth and sixth singles—"Alvin's Orchestra" and "Comin' 'Round the Mountain". Since its initial release, Sing Again with The Chipmunks has appeared twice on CD; both releases utilized the revised 1961 cover artwork, minus the song lyrics printed on the original back cover.

Commercial performance
Sing Again with The Chipmunks peaked at  on the Billboard pop albums chart.

Artwork
As with the debut album, the original issue depicted three realistic looking chipmunks on the cover sharing space with a photo of Ross Bagdasarian. When the album was reissued one year later, a new cover was substituted, that of an Alvin Show animation cel setup reenacting the poses the original chipmunks and Seville made.

Notes
This album has Alvin's first songwriting credit.
