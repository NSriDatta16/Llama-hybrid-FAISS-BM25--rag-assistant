is a railway station in the Yotsuya district of Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan, operated jointly by East Japan Railway Company (JR East) and Tokyo Metro. Several parts of the station are also located in the Rokubancho and Kojimachi neighborhoods of Chiyoda ward.

Lines
Yotsuya Station is served by the JR East Chūō Main Line with both Chūō Line (Rapid) and Chūō-Sōbu Line local services stopping here.

It is also served by the Tokyo Metro Marunouchi Line (station number M-12) and Tokyo Metro Namboku Line (station number N-08) subway lines. The station is  from the Marunouchi Line terminus at Ikebukuro, and  from the Namboku Line terminus at Meguro.

All four lines at Yotsuya run north to south; however, the Chūō/Chūō-Sōbu Line and Marunouchi Line are mainly east–west lines, and somewhat counter-intuitively, while northbound Chūō Line trains are bound for Tokyo and southbound trains are bound for Shinjuku, northbound Marunouchi Line trains are bound for Shinjuku and southbound trains are bound for Tokyo.

History
Yotsuya Station opened on 9 September 1894 as a station on the Kobu Railway, the forerunner of the Chūō Line which was nationalized in 1906. Although the line was originally single-track, the section passing through Yotsuya was double-tracked in 1895 and quadruple-tracked in 1929.

The Marunouchi Line station opened on 15 March 1959, and the Namboku Line station opened on 26 March 1996. Yotsuya was the southern terminus of the Namboku Line until the opening of Tameike-Sannō Station in 1997.

The station facilities of the Marunouchi and Namboku Lines were inherited by Tokyo Metro after the privatization of the Teito Rapid Transit Authority (TRTA) in 2004.
