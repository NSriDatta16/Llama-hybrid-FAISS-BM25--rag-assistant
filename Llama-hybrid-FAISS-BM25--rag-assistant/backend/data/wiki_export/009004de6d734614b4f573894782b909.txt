History
Ryde was created originally in 1894 with the abolition of multi-member districts, from part of Central Cumberland and named after and including Ryde. It was abolished in 1904 with the downsizing of the Legislative Assembly after Federation, but recreated in 1913. In 1920, the electoral districts of Ryde, Burwood, Drummoyne, Gordon and Willoughby were combined to create a new incarnation of Ryde, which elected five members by proportional representation. This was replaced by single member electorates, including Ryde, Burwood, Drummoyne, Eastwood, Gordon and Willoughby for the 1927 election. Ryde was abolished in 1968, being partly replaced by Yaralla and Fuller. In 1981 Ryde was recreated from the part of the abolished district of Yaralla north of the Parramatta River and part of the abolished district of Fuller. In 1991, Ryde was abolished again, but in 1999, Gladesville and Eastwood were abolished and largely replaced by a fourth incarnation of Ryde and Epping.

In its previous incarnations, Ryde was a marginal seat that frequently traded hands between  and the conservative parties. In its current incarnation, Ryde was originally a safe Labor seat before a massive swing to the Liberals at a 2008 by-election made it a safe Liberal seat. Dominello currently holds it with a majority of 11.5 percent. On 17 August 2022, Dominello announced his plan to retire at the upcoming state election. At the election in March, the Liberal candidate, Jordan Lane, won by a two-party preferred margin of 50 votes. The result was so close, a recount was held on 15 April which increased Lane's margin to 54 votes.
