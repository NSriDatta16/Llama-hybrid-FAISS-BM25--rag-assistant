History 

Cedar High School was founded in September 1940. The school building was located on Center Street and 300 West.  It was designed to house 350 students and became overcrowded as the student body grew to 500. It was torn down in 2000 to make room for a parking lot. (Cedar High School was never part of Branch Agricultural College, which was across the street from the original High School location.) 

The school was founded in 1941 and incorporated high school students from Cedar City and the surrounding area. In 1942 CHS got its mascot under President Jay Thorley. Cedar High School belongs to the Iron County School District.  The current building was completed for the 1963-1964 academic year. The building has had expansions over the years.

Mascot controversy
In early 2019, the Iron County School Board was asked to reconsider the school's mascot "The Redmen." The board formed an advisory committee to investigate the change. After the committee voted 17-2 to change the mascot, the school board voted 3–2 in favor of retiring the mascot. Cedar High School students later selected "Reds" as a replacement.
