Note: This listing only denotes the racer's primary sponsors. At any given time a racer could have numerous ever changing co-sponsors. Primary sponsorships can be verified by BMX press coverage and sponsor's advertisements at the time in question.

Amateur/Junior Men
U.S. Boss Racing Products: January 1985 – March 31, 1985
Free Agent: March 31, 1985 – December 27, 1985

Cyclecraft: January 1, 1987 – March 21, 1987.
CW (Custom Works) Racing: March 21, 1987 – November 27, 1987. "CW" never stood for "Coast Wheels" as it is widely thought. Coast Wheels was a bike shop that Roger Worsham owned. Custom Works was a completely different and independent company. This is in contrast with JMC (Jim Melton Cyclery) which did start out as a bicycle shop and then began manufacturing its own BMX components including entire bicycles.
Revcore: November 28, 1987 – November 26, 1988. Revcore was owned and operated by Roger Worsham who also owned CW Racing, It was a separate product line much like Shadow Racing was in 1983. Townsend's last race for them was the Friday night November 27 Honda Super Cup, one day prior to the start of the 1987 ABA Grand National, where Townsend switch over to Revcore and captured ABA No.1 pro for that year. By 1989 Roger Worsham would divest himself of both Custom Works and Revcore.
Diamond Back (Centurion): November 27, 1988 – December 31, 1989. At the end of the 1989 season Diamond Back decided to let the entire team go except for Matt Hadan, a pro. Harry Leary decided to retire. Charles Townsend was sponsorless for three months until April 1990.
Powerlite Industries*: Mid April 1990 – November 1991.
Robinson Racing Products: November 1991 – December 1998. After seven years Robinson dropped Townsend after the 1998 racing season.
Troy Lee Designs/Jones Soda: April 1999 – March 2000. Charles didn't have a primary sponsor for approximately 15 months between Robinson Racing and Airborne Direct. Troy Lee Designs and Jones Soda were many co-sponsors that helped support him on the national race circuit while he searched for a main, primary sponsor.
Airborne Direct: March 28, 2000 – December 2000
Kona/Rocket Cash.Com: December 20, 2000–
Phantom Bikes: January 2003 – December 2003

Significant injuries
Cracked Tibia and dislocated knee at ABA Lone Star National in Fort Worth, Texas on July 2, 1988 on the back straightaway in the third and last pro main. Laid up for about five weeks until the International Bicycle Motocross Federation (IBMXF) World Championships in Santiago, Chile on August 14. This was his very first BMX related injury. What precipitated the accident was his front wheel coming off in mid race at a jump. He did along with Pete Loncarevich who was nursing broken ribs, roll off the gate at the NBL Waterford Oaks, Michigan race in a pro forma act to achieve the prerequisite number of NBL races participated in a season to be eligible to race in the NBL Grand Nationals and become national number one pro pending the results of the Grand Nationals.
Broke ankle at NBL Grand National in September 1988.
Separated shoulder at the 1992 ABA National in Topeka, Kansas on May 10. The rumored prognosis was an eight- to ten-week lay off but he was racing two weeks later at the ABA Summer Nationals in Sunol, California on May 23. Racing in pain, he did not make the mains on Saturday but did get a third on Sunday in "AA" pro.
Broke thumb in early 1996.
Broke hand in mid January 2004 during practice.
