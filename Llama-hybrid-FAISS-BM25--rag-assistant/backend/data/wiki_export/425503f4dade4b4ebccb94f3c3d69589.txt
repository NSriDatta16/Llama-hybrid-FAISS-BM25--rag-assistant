The National Air and Space Museum Trophy was established in 1985. The trophy presented to the winners is a miniature version of "The Web of Space," a sculpture by artist John Safer.

The National Air and Space Museum presents this trophy annually to recognize both past and present achievements involving the management or execution of a scientific or technological project, a distinguished career of service in air and space technology, or a significant contribution in chronicling the history of air and space technology.

The trophy was created for the National Air and Space Museum by John Safer of Washington, D.C., a well-known sculptor and banker.  John Safer retired as chief executive officer of D.C. National Bank. The trophy became known as the Michael Collins Trophy in 2020.
