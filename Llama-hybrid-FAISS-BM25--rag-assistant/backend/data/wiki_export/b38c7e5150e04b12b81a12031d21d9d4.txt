Hikayat Raja-raja Pasai (حكاية راج-راج ڤاسا translated as “Chronicle of the Kings of Pasai”) is perhaps the earliest work in Malay on the first Malay-Muslim kingdom of Samudera-Pasai. In the story, Merah Silu met Muhammad in his dream and accepted conversion to Islam. The book is believed to have been composed around the late 14th or more likely early fifteenth century. The text of this work has a lot of parallels with the Sejarah Melayu, the history of Melaka.
