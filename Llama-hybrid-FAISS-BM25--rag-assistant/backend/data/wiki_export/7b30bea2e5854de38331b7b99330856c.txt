The Paris Sisters were a 1960s American girl group from San Francisco, best known for their work with record producer Phil Spector.

Career
The group consisted of lead singer Priscilla Paris (January 4, 1945 – March 5, 2004), her older sister Albeth Carole Paris, and their middle sister Sherrell Paris. They reached the peak of their success in October 1961 with the hit single "I Love How You Love Me", which peaked at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart, and sold over one million copies. Some of the group's other hit songs include the US Top 40 single "He Knows I Love Him Too Much" (March 1962, No. 34), "All Through The Night" (1961), "Be My Boy" (No. 56), "Let Me Be The One" (No. 87), and "Dream Lover" (No. 91).

The Paris Sisters appeared in the 1962 British rock film It's Trad, Dad! (released in the U.S. as Ring-a-Ding Rhythm) directed by Richard Lester. In the film, they performed the Spector-produced song "What Am I to Do?" Also early in the 1960s, the Paris Sisters sang the jingle for Diet Rite soda.

Sherrell Paris later served as a production assistant on The Price Is Right and as host Bob Barker's personal assistant until she was released in 2000.
 
Priscilla Paris died on March 5, 2004, from injuries suffered in a fall at her home in Pays de la Loire, France. She was 59.

Albeth Paris died in Palm Springs, California, on December 5, 2014. She was 79.
