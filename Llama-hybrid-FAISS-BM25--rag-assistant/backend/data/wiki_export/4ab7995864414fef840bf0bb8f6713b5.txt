Shoot for the Moon is the third album by country music artist Linda Davis, It was her first to achieve placement on the Billboard Music Charts. It was the first album released following a win at the 1993 Grammy Awards for Best Country Vocal Collaboration (with country superstar Reba McEntire) for their hit "Does He Love You." The album rose to the number 28 position on the Country Albums chart, and two of its tracks were relatively minor hits on the singles charts: "Company Time" at number 43, and "Love Didn't Do It" at number 58. The former was previously recorded by Mac McAnally on his 1990 album Simple Life.

"In Pictures" was later recorded by Alabama on their 1995 album of the same name.

Reception
Tim DuBois, president of Arista's Nashville division, said that "we rushed it" after Davis won a Grammy Award for her duet with Reba McEntire on "Does He Love You". Billboard reviewed the album favorably, praising John Guess's "punchy but rootsy" production and Davis's singing voice, while considering "Company Time", "A Family Tie", and the title track as the strongest cuts.
