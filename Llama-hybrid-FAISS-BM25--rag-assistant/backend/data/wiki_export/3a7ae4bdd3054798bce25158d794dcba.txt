The Moamoria rebellion (1769–1805) was an 18th-century uprising in Ahom kingdom of present-day Assam that began as power struggle between the Moamorias (Mataks), the adherents of the Mayamara Sattra, and the Ahom kings.  This uprising spread widely to other sections of Ahom kingdom including disgruntled elements of the Ahom aristocracy leading to two periods in which the Ahom king lost control of the capital. Retaking the capital was accompanied by a massacre of subjects, leading to a steep depopulation of large tracts.  The Ahom king failed to retake the entire kingdom; a portion in the north-east, Bengmara (modern-day Tinsukia district), became known as Matak Rajya ruled by a newly created office called Borsenapati, became a tribute-paying but virtually independent territory.

The Ahom kingdom emerged from the rebellion much weakened.  About one half of the population of the kingdom perished and the economy was totally destroyed.  The weakened Ahom kingdom fell to a Burmese invasion which ultimately led to colonization by the British.

Background

Mayamara Satra 
The Mayamara Satra was founded by Aniruddhadev, in the early 17th century. The Satra belonged to Kala–Samathi sect of Ekasarana Dharma.  This Kala–Samathi sect was founded by a disciple of Sankardeva, Gopaldeva. He prominently propagated the teachings of Neo–Vaisnavism among the tribals of Upper Assam. It particularly could gain popularity among the tribals for its egalitarian and humanitarian outlook. The sect had twelve Satras, six presided by Brahmana abbots and six presided by Shudra abbots. Out of these twelve Satras, the Mayamara and Dihing were the most influential. The humanitarian outlook was best observed in the former, both the former Satras freely admitted converts from backward classes of society and placed them on equal footing even with the high Hindu caste.

The disciples of the Mayamara Satra were called Moamorias/Matak, but they belonged to various castes and tribes such as; Moran, Ahoms, Chutias, Kacharis, Bihias, Kaibarta and Brittials as well as caste–Hindus like the Brahmanas, Kayastha and Kalitas. The disciples of the Mayamara Satras were scattered all over the whole country. The Moran tribe were the most prominent disciples, along with the Chutia and Kachari who also formed the pillars of Ahom military. These former tribes were also employed in various royal departments and establishments.

Ahom–Mayamara Satra Conflict 
As the Mayamara Satra rose to prominence, it was subjected to humilities and persecution on timely baisis. Ahom king Pratap Singha executed one disciple of the Satra for his remark about the King's court. Later when he learnt that Mataks won't bow down in front of anyone expect their Guru, he tested  their adherence by making four of his nobles, who were also disciple of Satra, gallop their horses against swords placed horizontally to their neck, two of them lost their lives while undergoing this test.  A successor King Surampha caused the death of the Mayamara abbot Nityanandadeva in 1650, when he was informed that he was boosting his power and prosperity. His disciples widely regarded him as a martyr; they took a vow to avenge his death even at the cost of their lives. In the reign of Jayadhwaj Singha, the Mayamara abbot Jayramdeva had to remain in colcealment due to fear of punishment but was brought back at the instance of Auniati abbot. In 1673, Udayaditya Singha confined the four Kala-Samathi abbots including the Mayamara one. But a palace coup engineered by the influential disciples of these Satra let them go unhurt. Gadadhar Singha who was resolved to destroy the power and influence of Vaisnava Satras and reduce influence of Vaisnavism, for he found Vaisnavism as a menace not only to the state but also an obstacle to military and internal development. He had especial personal animosity against the pontiff of Dakhinpat Satra. The Satras of Kala-Samathi were the first to come under the persecution, the Mayamara abbot Vaikunthadeva was executed in 1691.  

Successor King, Rudra Singha immediately reinstated all the Vaisnava Satras and showered favor to it. He devised mechanism of divide and rule, in a religious conference held in 1702, he promulgated a synod by discarding Shudra abbots from initiating Brahmanas; thus engineered a clash between Brahman and Shudra abbots. In the reign of Siva Singha, humilities were heaped upon the Mayamara abbot to the blame of Bar-Raja Phuleshwari causing a rebellion to break out half a century later.  

However, the only evidence in support of the above contention is recorded in Kashinath Phukan's Assam Buranji. Dutiram Hazarika, contemporary to Kashinath, and a stauch Vaisnava himself doesn't record any mentions of persecution by the queen in his metrical chronicle. Although, refers to some wrongs done to the Mahantas. In Captain Welsh's record, made no mention of the religious factor or of the guilt of queen Phuleshwari leading to prevailing discontent through the information collected from Premier Purnananda Burhagohain in 1794.

Paik and Khel system

Dissatisfaction towards the system
The Paiks were divided into two classes.

 Kanri or Karni (lowest grade), the general population.
 Chamua and Visayas or officers (higher grade), the privileged population.

It was mandatory for every Paik to render service to the state, and were given a plot of land (two puras=2.66 acres) in exchange for their service. Originally Paiks were grouped into a squad of four men (got) and each one had to render their service to the state for four months, but during the reign of Rajeswar Singha, due to excessive loss of manpower in the Naga wars, the strength of a got had to be reduced to three; thus increasing the pressure upon the Paiks. Each Paik was subjected to a guild (Khel) assigned under an officer. However, a sum of three rupees could be paid by the Paik in exchange for exempting the system.  Some Karnis were promoted to the classes of Chamuas and even Apikan Chamuas, thus enjoying higher status and didn't have to go to war. The Paiks to escape the compulsory manual service, enlisted themselves in Satras as bhakats (residential monks), who as per the law, were permitted exemption from such compulsion.  Otherwise, exemption in the form of slave to the protection of some families.  

1/4 to 1/3 of the population had to render their service in the form of labour to the ruling class and bureaucrats without any wages anytime. The system gradually transformed into a kind of feudal system. Once it became feudal, Paiks were oppressed both emotionally and physically so they gradually got resolved to either escape from the system or protest against it.

First phase

Rebellion (1769–1770) 
Kirti Chandra Borbarua, a prominent noble, heaped insults and indignities upon the Mayamra abbot Astabhuj and particularly his son Gagini Deka, goaded the Moamorias to wreak terrible vengeance on to the Borbarua. 

On September 15, 1769, Ragh Neog, a leading disciple of the Satra, was flogged by Ahom officials for not supplying the required number of elephants. This acted as the transgressing point and blessed by their spiritual head, the Morans raised the standard of revolt after collecting an army of about seven thousand. By November, the Mataks led by Ragh Neog, Naharkhora Saikia and his two wives Radha and Rukmini, promised the throne to three exiled Ahom princes (Mohanmala Gohain, and two sons of Rajeswar Singha) and with their help liberated the territory north of the Burhidihing river.  On November 21, 1769 the rebels occupied the Ahom capital and placed Ramakanta, son of Naharkhora, on the throne. All high  offices were thrown open to the Morans and Mohanmala Gohain was executed for his alleged conspiracy with the royalist.  The Ahom king, Lakshmi Singha, was captured and kept a prisoner.  All high officers were executed and three common Mataks became the three great Gohains.  Ragh Neog became the Borbarua, a kanri paik became the Borphukan and two common Ahoms became the Gohains at Sadiya and Marangi.

The rebel leaders went to pay homage to the abbot of Mayamara Satra, which was the source of unity among the rebels. Heavy penalty was imposed on the royalist satras, also they were forced to pay homage to the Mayamara abbot.

The rebels, inexperienced in statecraft, failed to usher in a new order.  Instead, they began imitating the unpopular practices of their erstwhile leaders.  Ragh Neog seized the wives and daughters of many nobles and kept them in his harem.  As some of the rebel officers took on the airs of the old nobility, many rebels were dissatisfied and, led by Govinda Gaoburha, left the capital and reached Sagunmuri.

Counter-attack & Suppression 
After four months of rebel regime, there came the spring festival (bohag bihu). The peasant soldiers who were voluntarily guarding the capital left their posts to visit their villages, so the defense of the capital got weakened and thus vulnerable.  Taking advantage of this, some of the old nobility in disguise killed Ragha on April 14, 1770 with the help of Kuranganayani, an Ahom queen from Manipur, and retook the capital.  In the purge that followed, Ramakanta the rebel king, Naharkhora, Radha, Rukmini, Astabhujdev, the Moamara sattradhikar and his son Saptabhuj were all executed.

After the capital was recaptured the remaining rebel forces in Sagunmuri under Govinda Gaoburha attempted to overthrow the king again.  This movement too had the signs of a popular uprising.  The main weapons used by the rebels were bamboo staves and clubs, and their slogan was praja-oi joroiroa, chekani-oi sopai dhora ("Ye oppressed subjects, hold your stave close"), and this uprising was called chekani kubua ron ("The war of the staves").  In one of the engagements, the Borpatrogohain and the Dhekial Phukan were killed, and the Borgohain made a hair breath escape.  The rebels advanced toward Rangpur and they were met at Thowra by the forces of the Burhagohain, the new Borpatrogohain, the Borgohain and a detachment cavalry from the Manipur king.  In this battle the rebels were defeated; Govinda Gaoburha was captured and executed.

Under the pressure of Premier Ghanashyam Burhagohain, king Lakshmi Singha initiated a process of ruthless persecution of the Moamorias. Some rebels then retreated deep into jungles and continued guerilla warfare under leaders like Lephera, Parmananda and others.  An initial royalist force under the Na-Phukan and the Deka-Phukan was defeated, but a later force under the Borpatrogohain was able to eliminate Lephera and Parmananda.  Subsequently, the Burhagohain began systematically destroying the villages and killing the remaining leaders; in a siege many rebels and their families died of starvation.  The remaining people were then separated and settled at different places.  One of the last holdouts, Nomal, was finally captured and executed. The whole process of suppression almost took one year.

Second phase 
The purge of Moamorias that followed after the reinstatement of royalist couldn't put up flames of revenge among the people. The peasants of Rangpur and Garhgaon secretly began organizing themselves. They planned to launch a surprise attack owing to their less strength. 

In one night of April 1782, in the festive atmosphere of bohag bihu, when the new King Gaurinath Singha had also completed his coronation celebrations. The rebels mixed with the royal attendants and torch bearers and under the veil of darkness launched their quest for killing the King. But somehow the King managed to escape and took shelter in the underground chambers of Kareng Ghar. The rebels then advanced towards Rangpur, overcame the resistance offered by the city-guards and occupied it. In the meantime, a strong body of royalist under the head of Ghanashyam Burhagohain wrested the rebels out of Rangpur. This was followed by an indiscriminate massacre of the Moamorias, rejecting any kind of conciliatory policy.  Several thousands of people along with innocents were killed and many escaped and sought refuge in the hills and neighbouring Kingdoms, this had an adverse effect on the production system and the economy was on the verge of collapse . The massacres were finally suspended at the request of the courtiers

Third phase

Conflicts (1786–1789) 
The scattered rebels and Dafla-Bahatias organised themselves and placed them under the leadership of one Harihar Tanti and rose to revolt at Japaribhita. The rebels were joined by several hill tribes. They broke out in rebellion in 1786, from the foot of Daphla Hills. The rebels defeated the royalist force at Garaimari bil and other places. 

The rebels then freed Pitambar, a relation to the previous Mayamara abbot. He was persuaded to join them, who did it after allegedly performing a  Brahmayagna (brahman–slaying sacrifice). The rebels then burnt the Satras of Garmur, Auniati and Dakhinpat (all royalist Satras in Majuli), headed by Brahmanas. Then they executed the abbots of Bareghar and Budhbari Satras, which belonged to Kala-Samathi for collaborating with the royalist. At Pahumara they routed the troops sent by the vassal states of Rani, Luki, Beltola and Topakuchi. The rebels gradually advanced and defeated the Burhagohain at Sagunmuri, making him eventually retreat to Rangpur. The rebels got momentum to pillage villages in the vicinity of Rangpur. Attempt was made by the abbot of Dihing Satra with his disciples to repulse them but went to vain. The Ahom priests too collected bands of soldiers and fought with the rebels. 

The rebels after many prolonged battles, marching along the Jhanji River appeared at the capital gates and surrounded Rangpur in January 1788. At this sight King Gaurinath Singha accompanied by most of his officers left for Guwahati, leaving Purnananda Burhagohain in charge. The Burhagohain too deserted Rangpur after resisting the rebels for a few days. Failed attempts were made to capture Rangpur. From Guwahati, Gaurinath Singha sent a large contingent of troops under the Pani Phukan to the assistance of Burhagohain. Receiving reinforcement, the royalist assumed offensive but still couldn't manage to reoccupy the Ahom metropolis. In August 1788, Patkonwar (a son of Rajeswar Singha) raised a huge army with the assistance of Nara Raja and recovered Rangpur from the Moamorias, but his victory was short lived and he was eventually killed following an internal dissension in his camp. 

The Burhagohain erected a line of ramparts from Bar Ali to Kharikatiya Ali along the Namdang river, from where he resisted  further rebel incursion. The royalist finally unable to stand the rebels fell back to Gaurisagar. The rebels then laid siege to the Gaurisagar Fort, and a large number of people along with many high officials fell fighting. The Burhagohain had to ultimately retreat to Taratali thence Dichoi. From Dichoi further incursion of rebels were resisted. The rebels frequently harassed the people, living under the tract controlled by Burhagohain. The Upper Assam razed by continuous battles and disorder, cultivation suffered, there occurred a very terrible famine–the severest in Assam's history.

Conflicts (1789–1794) 
The rebels gradually extended their control up to Dergaon, they couldn't capture the strongholds of royalist at Dichoi fort. The rebels extended their control over large tracts of areas, but no attempt was made to establish a centralised administration by the rebel leaders. The captured region was locally administered with Harihar Tanti in the north bank of the Brahmaputra, Howha ruling Majuli, Sarbananada Singha ruling the Moran tracts from Bengmara (present-day Tinsukia). Bharat was made the king. Coins were struck regularly in Bharat's and Sarbananda's names. Territory up to Ladoigarh was kept immune from the rebels. Purnananda Burhagohain erected a series of earthen rampart known to the rebels as Bibudhi garh, from here the royalist conducted the war-operations. The continuous set-back left the royalist camp demoralised 

The rebellion of Moamorias inspired people from different parts of the country to rise up against Ahom government as result of it brought breakdown of khel-system and it became effectively hard to recruit soldiers. 

The discontentment among the inhabitants of Darrang as a result of entry of refugees from Eastern Assam and their plundering activities caused them to protest. This was supported by the inhabitants of Kamrup who had been subjected to humiliation.

Dissension to Captain Welsh's expedition 
 
Gaurinath Singha from Guwahati sailed down to Nagaon due to the underlying rebellious activities of Darrangi prince Krishnananrayan. Here the exploitation of the local inhabitants by the royal officers caused dissension among the Nagayans and they surrounded King's camp. They demanded the dismissal of those officers whom they held for their oppression. Soon after, one Bairagi besieged on King's camp, forcing Gaurinath to flee.

Gaurinath Singha appealed for foreign help, envoys were sent to neighboring countries seeking military help. Expect the king of Manipur, all pleaded on their inability to send troops. Similarly, British help could be acquired and a contingent of British troops under the leadership of Captain Welsh was despatched to Assam. After the expulsion of Barkandazes from Guwahati, they directed their operation towards the Moamoria rebels. Captain Welsh captured Rangpur in March 1794. After this, further operation against the rebels was pleaded but was discarded by the Governor General and the contingent of British troops was recalled. Gaurinath Singha couldn't hold on Rangpur and soon was recaptured by the rebels. The affairs in Guwahati too degraded, and the Barkandazes renewed their depredations. Gaurinath retreated to Dichoi, to the strongholds of Purnananda Burhagohain, where he died soon. Following the death of Gaurinath, the Burhagohain became the de facto ruler of the Ahom state. He placed his own nominee to the Ahom throne, Kinaram.

Final Phase

Conflicts (1794–1805) 
This experience and the military display by Thomas Welsh and his troops encouraged the Ahoms to create a standing army of mostly paid Hindustani sepoys to replace the paik based militia. One chief rebel leader, Phopai was killed in 1796 and the rebel king of Rangpur, Bhrarath in 1799. Sadiya fell to the royalists in 1800 from the grip of Khamtis. The Moamoria fugitives living as refuge in the neighbouring Dimasa and Jaintia Kingdoms, regrouped themselves and began harassing the royalist villagers of Nagaon. Five companies of royalist sepoys were dispatched, but they were somehow lured to the jungles and slaughtered. Following this year, the Ahom force defeated the combined force of Moamoria rebels and Dimasa King Krishnachandra.  In 1803, a plot of revolt by the people belonging to a secret sect of the night–worshippers (Ratikhowa) was detected and the leading conspirators were put to death in time.Purnanada Burhagohain dispatched five companies under the Deka Phukan in 1805 to retake the Bengmara region, then under the control of Sarbananda.  The first skirmish took place at on the banks of the Dibru river at Bhutiating.  The royalist forces were able to defeat Sarbananda's forces which then took shelter at Holongaguri, and a section of the forces submitted eventually to the Ahom king who were settled at Ghilamara.  Nevertheless, both Purnananda and Sarbananda understood that this was a stalemate—and Sarbananda agreed to a peace proposal.  Sarbananda was given the title of Barsenapati and given autonomous command of the Bengmara region which came to be called the Matak rajya; and both Sarbananda and his son Matibar who followed him as Barsenapati continued to pay annual tributes to the Ahom kigndom. 

The Moamaria rebellion thus ended with the creation of a near-independent Matak tract ruled by a Barsenapati and the near-end of the Paik system.

Conclusion 
The rebellion couldn't own its origin due to a impolitic deeds of some Kings and Queen. It was the consequence, the symptom of ultimate disease, that the Ahom monarchy was on decline. The massive agitation of rebels shook the foundations of Ahom state. Though the Moamaria rebellion ended in failure, it brought the breakdown of exploitive paik and Khel systems, on which the economic state of Ahoms was based. This compelled the state to move on money-economy. The rebellion ended indecisively with both the sides completely ruined, the country was fanatically depopulated. The population came down to one-half of what it was before and economic life was totally disrupted. Swarnalata Baruah (1985) states: The Moamariya rebellion was a rebellion of the people against the existing government and those who disfavoured a change in it joined with the hands with the royalist."

The discontented elements remained silent for very long, for they considered the Ahom monarchy to be unchallengeable. But this was all shattered throwing the divine origin of kingship and by putting a line of common men on the throne. "No alternative to the feudal system emerged, since no new ruling class could germinate from the peasantry which was relatively undifferentiated, or from its undeveloped stratum of traders and artisans. The issues became blurred since the rebels comprised diverse and nebulous class elements with varying degrees of dislike for the regime. Nevertheless, the ruling class could no more rule in the old manner."
