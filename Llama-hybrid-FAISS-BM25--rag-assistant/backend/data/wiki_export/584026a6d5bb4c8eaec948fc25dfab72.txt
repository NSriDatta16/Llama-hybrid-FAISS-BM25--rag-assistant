History
In the fall of 2010 students moved into a new high school-middle school facility on the southeast side of Cowley. The school features state-of-the-art technology, a large commons area and two gymnasiums.

The school building that used to house RMHS was completed in 1956 to house the Byron High School. At that time only students from Byron attended the school. A typical graduating class from BHS had about 20 to 25 students. In 1983 it was decided to consolidate the three high schools in the north end of Big Horn County into one school. These were Byron High School, Cowley High School, and Deaver-Frannie High School.
