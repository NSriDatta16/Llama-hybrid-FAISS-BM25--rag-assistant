Deconsecration, also referred to as decommissioning or secularization (a term also used for confiscation of church property), is the removal of a religious blessing from something that had been previously consecrated for religious use. In particular, church and synagogue buildings no longer required for religious use are deconsecrated for secular use, or for demolition.
