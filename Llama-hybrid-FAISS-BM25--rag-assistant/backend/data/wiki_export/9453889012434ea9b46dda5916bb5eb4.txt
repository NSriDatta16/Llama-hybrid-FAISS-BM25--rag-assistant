History
Under the name Malakhovskoye (), Malakhovka was first mentioned in 1328 in Ivan Kalita's will as a place left to Ivan's older son Semyon.

With the completion of a railway station in 1884 Malakhovka was recognized as a dacha settlement. By the end of 19th century, the settlement was inhabited by such renowned representatives of Russian arts and literature as Anton Chekhov, Maxim Gorky, Ivan Bunin, and Feodor Chaliapin. Chaliapin performed in the Malakhovka's Summer Theater before 1914. The actress Faina Ranevskaya performed there from the following year, and also had a dacha there. At the time of the Revolution Malakhovka was a described as a "hamlet" of about three hundred dachas.

Urban-type settlement status was granted to Malakhovka in 1961.
