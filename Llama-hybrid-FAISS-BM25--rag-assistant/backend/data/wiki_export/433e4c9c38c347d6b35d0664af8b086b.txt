Release
Despite normal Samurai Shodown releases and distribution outside Japan, the game has been released outside the country on the Atomiswave system, published in the United States by Sega. The game was released for the PlayStation 2 in Japan on January 25, 2006. The American and European home versions were released respectively on March 24 and March 29, 2009, on the PS2, PSP and Wii as part of the compilation Samurai Shodown Anthology. The PS2 release added even more playable characters, and three more spirit select systems to go along with them.  With the PS2 release, virtually every character to have ever appeared in the Neo Geo games including the referee, Kuroko, and the animal characters, are all playable. The Samurai Shodown Anthology version is similar to the PS2 version except that everything is unlocked at the start. In 2020, a homebrew conversion was released for the Dreamcast.
