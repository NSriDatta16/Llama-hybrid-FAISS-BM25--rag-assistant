Kinder Happy Hippo is a biscuit/candy made by the Italian chocolate and confectionery company Kinder owned by Ferrero.

Composition
The candy consists of a wafer biscuit shaped like a hippopotamus. Inside the crisp hollow biscuit are two flavours of icing: milk-flavored and hazelnut cream in the original flavour, milk cream and chocolate cream in the cocoa flavour - similar to a Kinder Bueno. Available in milk, dark, and white chocolate variants.

Marketing 
"Happy Hippo" were made famous by a series of popular animated commercials featuring a dog and a hippo getting into various situations that generally end in the two sharing a Happy Hippo biscuit. The original light blue Happy Hippo character was created by the French designer Andr√© Roche for Ferrero chocolates in 1987 and became famous worldwide due to its repeated appearances as a toy in easter eggs. The Happy Hippo toys came in various costumes and character designs, including an authorized parody character (named "Hipperium") from the George Lucas Star Wars trilogy.
