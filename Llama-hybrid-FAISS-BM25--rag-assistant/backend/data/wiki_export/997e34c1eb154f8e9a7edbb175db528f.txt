"Say What You Want" is a song by Scottish rock band Texas, written by band members Johnny McElhone and Sharleen Spiteri. It was the first single to be released from the group's fourth studio album, White on Blonde (1997). Released in January 1997 by Mercury, it is the band's biggest hit commercially, peaking at number three on the UK Singles Chart. As of March 2023, the single is certified platinum in the United Kingdom for sales and streams exceeding 600,000 units. The accompanying music video released to promote the single shows lead singer Sharleen Spiteri in a futuristic room.

In 1998, Texas collaborated with Wu-Tang Clan members Method Man and RZA to remix the song as "Say What You Want (All Day, Every Day)". This version features Method Man and RZA on vocals and was released as a single in March 1998, peaking at number four on the UK Singles Chart and reaching the top 10 in Iceland, the Netherlands, and New Zealand. Both version of the song are included on Texas's 2000 compilation album The Greatest Hits.

Critical reception
Quentin Harrison from Albumism wrote in his retrospective review of the album, that "the bulk of White on Blonde examines the high and lows of modern love as best heard on its lead single 'Say What You Want'." Andy Gill from The Independent opined that it crosses a lyric line from "Sexual Healing" with a guitar line from "Tired of Being Alone" "without quite emulating either." Kevin Courtney from Irish Times felt it "has a bit of Marvin Gaye going on." Catherine Eade from Music Week noted the "easy-on-the-ear nature" of the song, "with its Marvin Gaye-influenced chorus". David Sinclair from The Times complimented it as "charming".

"Say What You Want (All Day, Every Day)"

The song was remixed as "Say What You Want (All Day, Every Day)", featuring Method Man and RZA from the Wu-Tang Clan, and re-released as a double A-side with "Insane" on 9 March 1998. This version was also a success, peaking at number four on the UK Singles Chart and reaching number three in New Zealand, becoming the band's highest-charting hit in the latter country. A second music video was created, showing Spiteri in a park.

Regarding this version, Spiteri said in Q magazine, "They're the biggest guys I've ever seen in my life. They're like basketball players. I'd just recorded a vocal, and Chef Raekwon's like, 'Yo! Who's that singing?' And RZA goes, 'It's Girlie' – 'cos they called me Girlie. And Raekwon goes, 'Man, you black!' And I laughed so loud. Method Man's a pussycat."
