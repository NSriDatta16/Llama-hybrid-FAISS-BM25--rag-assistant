Cartoons, also known as Cartoons DK, are a Eurodance band from Denmark, best known for their song "DooDah!" and their cover of the 1958 novelty song "Witch Doctor", both hits released in 1998. The band wears outlandish plastic costumes and wigs in live performances as caricatures of 1950s American rock and roll stars. 

Cartoons were originally called the Scooters in the late 1980s, and played rockabilly music from the 1950s and 1960s. In 1994, the Scooters released the album Live at Woodstock, and in 1997, the group changed its name to Cartoons.

History
They were first signed to FLEX Records, moving later to EMI Denmark. 

Their most notable single to date is "Witch Doctor", which reached number two in the UK Singles Chart; with its combination of the original's "oo-ee-oo-aah-aah" chorus (although lacking that record's double-speed playback of the chorus), driving dance beat and occasional guitar breaks.

They had further success in the UK with the Top 10 hit, "DooDah!" (a version of the American folk song "Camptown Races"), the Top 20 hit "Aisy Waisy", which was performed on Jim Davidson's Generation Game and a Top 20 debut album, Toonage (later released with additional songs under the title More Toonage). 

Their second album Toontastic! did not match the success of its predecessor but several notable hits were released from it including "Diddley-Dee", "Little Red Riding Hood", "Chirpy Chirpy Cheep Cheep", "Big Coconuts" and a reworked cover of Les Humphries Singers' "Mama Loo".

In July 2016, Karina Jensen died from cancer, after having a double mastectomy in 2012. She was survived by her husband and two children. In April 2019, Erling Jensen died of lymphoma. He was 50 years old.
