Background and career
Marjie Lundstrom was born in 1956. Her parents, Dr. and Mrs. Max Lundstrom, are from Wayne, Nebraska.

She graduated from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, college of Journalism in 1978. When she enrolled, she didn't have a clear career goal, saying she "stumbled into journalism." Lundstrom went on to become the fourth graduate to win the Pulitzer Prize for journalism at UNL. In 1977 she wrote her autobiography, while a junior at the school.

Early in her career, Lundstrom served as a staff member with The Fort Collins Coloradoan, the Denver Monthly, and The Denver Post. She was a reporter and senior writer for The Sacramento Bee, for 29 years, taking a temporary break in 1990 to work for Gannett news service, where she and a fellow journalist wrote a Pulitzer Prize winning story on child abuse.

In 2019 Lundstrom began working with FairWarning, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization, based in southern California. Their investigative stories cover consumer protection, labor, public health, and transportation safety. In 2020 she joined the team at CalMatters, another nonpartisan, nonprofit organization, which focuses on issues important to the lives of California residents and government accountability. She is currently the deputy editor of both publications.
