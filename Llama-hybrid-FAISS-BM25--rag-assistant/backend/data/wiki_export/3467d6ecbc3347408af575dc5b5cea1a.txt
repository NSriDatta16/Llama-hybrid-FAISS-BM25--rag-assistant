Joseph J. D'Auria is an American actor, writer, and voiceover artist best known for his role as Bozo the Clown in The Bozo Show, succeeding original actor Bob Bell. He is also known as J.W. Terry, Joseph J. Terry, and Joseph W. Terry.

Career
D'Auria is best known for his role in WGN-TV Chicago's The Bozo Show from 1984 to 2001. D'Auria was hired after a long search for the next Bozo in part because his improvisational skills were very good. D'Auria also blended well with Roy Brown, who said he knew right away that D'Auria would be a hit after telling him he had broken his arm in three places and getting a response of, "Then don't go in those three places!" D'Auria played Bozo until the show's cancellation in 2001.
