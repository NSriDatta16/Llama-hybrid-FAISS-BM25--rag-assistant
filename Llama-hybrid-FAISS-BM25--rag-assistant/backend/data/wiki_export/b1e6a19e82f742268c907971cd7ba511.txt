Tõnis Kasemets (born March 17, 1974)  is an Estonian racing driver and a former competitor in the CART Champ Car World Series. He won the 2022 IMSA Prototype Challenge championship.

Career
Kasemets started racing karts in 1982, winning the Baltic championships in 1992 and 1993. In 1995, Kasemets moved to the United States to race in the American series. He advanced through the open wheel ranks and by 2004 was in the Toyota Atlantic series. In 2005 he placed second in the series championship to Charles Zwolsman Jr.. He participated in a partial 2006 schedule in the Champ Car World Series for Paul Gentilozzi's Rocketsports Racing.

To participate in Champ Car in 2006 he had to gather funds for a quarter of the participation costs. Kasemets wanted to do a full season of Champ Car in 2007 and in the future he wants to own a successful team à la Newman-Haas and Forsythe. However, he has not appeared in a Champ Car or IndyCar Series race since 2006. He continued racing in the Atlantic Championship until its closure after the 2009 season and made his Firestone Indy Lights debut on the Streets of Long Beach in April 2010.

Kasemets has competed in some Grand Am Road Racing events, including the 2013 Rolex 24 Hours of Daytona.

Personal life

He currently lives in Mundelein, Illinois with his son and daughter.
