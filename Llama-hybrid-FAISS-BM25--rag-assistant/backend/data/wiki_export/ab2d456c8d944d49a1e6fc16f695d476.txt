David Frankham (born 16 February 1926) is a retired British actor. Frankham served in the British Army during World War II. He was deployed to pre-independence India, where anti-British sentiment was very high. He also served in Malaya. After his discharge from the army, Frankham worked first as a news reader, and then a writer, interviewer and producer for the BBC from 1948 to 1955.

In 1955, Frankham moved to Hollywood to pursue a career as an actor. He soon found work, appearing on five episodes of the live television programme Matinee Theatre. He worked steadily in television, as well as appearing in films such as Return of the Fly (1959), Ten Who Dared (1960), Master of the World (1961), Tales of Terror (1962), The Spiral Road (1962), King Rat (1965), and The Great Santini (1979). Frankham provided the voice of Sergeant Tibbs the cat in Walt Disney's One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961).

He appeared in guest roles on American television from the late 1950s to the 1980s. His career peaked in the 1960s with frequent roles on such shows as Thriller, GE True, Twelve O'Clock High, The F.B.I., Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C., The Beverly Hillbillies, The Outer Limits, Star Trek (episode "Is There in Truth No Beauty?"), then in Cannon, The Waltons, and McCloud during the 1970s.

In November 2012, Frankham's autobiography Which One Was David? was published by BearManor Media.
