Hugo Miguel Martins Carreira (born 10 March 1979) is a Portuguese former professional footballer who played as a central defender.

Club career
Born in Lisbon, Carreira started his professional career at local F.C. Barreirense. After two seasons he was acquired by La Liga club Deportivo de La Coruña, but would never play in any first-team games during three seasons.

For the 2001–02 campaign, Carreira joined C.F. Estrela da Amadora in the second division. After a brief spell with C.D. Nacional in Madeira, with which he made his Primeira Liga debut, he returned to the Lisbon-based side, being relatively used in his six-year spell.

In March 2009, Carreira left Estrela which was facing a severe economic crisis, and moved to China's Qingdao Jonoon FC. In the following year he moved teams – and countries – again, signing for AEP Paphos FC of Cyprus.
