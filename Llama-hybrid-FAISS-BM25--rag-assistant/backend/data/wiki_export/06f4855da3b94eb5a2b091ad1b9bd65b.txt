is an original Japanese romantic comedy anime television series directed by Tomoki Kobayashi at Studio Gokumi and AXsiZ. It aired on TBS between January 5 and March 23, 2017.

The series is structured like an anthology series, with every four episodes taking place in an individualized continuity in which protagonist Shōichi Kamita ends up with a different girl, yet featuring all of the same characters.

Seiren is a sequel to the similarly-structured Amagami adaptation, set in the same high school, albeit 9 years later.
