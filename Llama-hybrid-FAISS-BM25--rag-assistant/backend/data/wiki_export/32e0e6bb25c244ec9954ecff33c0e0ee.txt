Making God Smile: An Artists' Tribute to the Songs of Beach Boy Brian Wilson is a tribute album featuring cover versions of songs by Brian Wilson and The Beach Boys performed by Contemporary Christian musicians. Originally released as a single CD, a double album version was released for sale only on the Internet through pastestore.com, the retail website of Paste Music.  According to Silent Planet Records' website, this double album quickly sold out.  As a result, Silent Planet Records sells individual CD-R copies of the second disc on its website for people who missed their chance to buy the double album.

The cover picture was made by Kurt Lightner. Lightner wrote in the CD's liner notes that the cover is his interpretation of Frank Holmes' original design for the Beach Boys' Smile album.  Lightner also wrote that Jimmy A was responsible for directing Silent Planet Records to Lightner to do the cover work for the album.  Jimmy A appears on the album in a duet with dc Talk member Kevin Max performing Help Me Rhonda.  How Jimmy A and Lightner became acquaintances is unknown but Lightner is known to have other ties to musicians on the album as well; he and Jason Harrod, who plays on the album (see below), both attended Wheaton College (Illinois) at the same time in the early 1990s.
