History
The land that would become Valemount is in the traditional territory of the Kootenai, Shuswap and Rocky Mountain Cree.  Other first peoples with ties to the area included the Lheidli T’enneh and the Mountain Metis.

In 1950, the Canoe River train crash occurred south of Valemount Station.

Valemount was incorporated as a village under the Municipal Act (now Community Charter), on December 13, 1962.
Until the construction of the Yellowhead Highway 5 in the 1960s, Valemount's population was small and mostly itinerant. Road conditions were poor in the wintertime and electric power unreliable.

Expansion and growth in the 1970s

Valemount's population increased  from 600 people to 693, and from 693 people to 1,160 in the 1970s.
The sewer system was completed in 1975, a water tower of 300,000 gallons started to service the town in 1977, a clinic opened in 1978, and a new Community Hall was inaugurated in February 1979. A shopping mall (1978) and several hotels on Highway 5 were completed in the late 1970s.

Valemount in the 1980s
In the 1980s population growth slowed. In 1980, work began at the Starratt Wildlife Sanctuary with a clean-up operation at an old dumpsite. 
The Canoe Robson Education Development Association (CREDA) was founded in 1984 to assist local residents with continued education and training.
Canyon Creek Forestry Products was replaced by Clearwater Timber Industries which employed 400 people between Clearwater and Valemount. After two mill crises in 1984 and 1986, Clearwater Timber Industries went bankrupt and was purchased by Slocan Forest Products in May 1987.

Peak of lumber production in the 1990s
The mill was closed for part of 1991–1992 but reached a period of peak production between 1993 and 1996 when three shifts were employed full-time (160 employees). The population increased in these five years by 17 percent. In 1998, Slocan reduced its work force by two thirds and by 2001 the local population had dropped by 7.7 percent.   The sawmill, which had shut down by Slocan and then acquired by Carrier Lumber, never met its former production or employment levels, and closed permanently in 2006.

  
There are approximately 20 restaurants in Valemount.

Improvement and expansion of village infrastructure
All streets in the village were paved between 1993 and 2000. Major projects, such as the Curling Rink and the Arena, were completed or renovated, and the airport terminal was completed in 1996. In 1995, Valemount was invited to join the Columbia Basin Trust, created by the Columbia Basin Trust Act to benefit the region most adversely affected by the Columbia River Treaty.  The Mica Dam had been completed by 1974 and the whole Canoe River Basin flooded.
In 1997, the one-person office of CREDA grew into a busy Valemount Learning Centre; since then, the Valemount Learning Centre has been employing three full-time and three part-time staff, who provide various training and employment services to Valemount's residents.
