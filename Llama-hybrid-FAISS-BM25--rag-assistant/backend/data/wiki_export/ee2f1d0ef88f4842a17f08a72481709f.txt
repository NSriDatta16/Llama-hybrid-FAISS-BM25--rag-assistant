In Roman mythology, Voluptas or Volupta is the daughter born from the union of Cupid and Psyche, according to Apuleius. The Latin word voluptas means 'pleasure' or 'delight'; Voluptas is known as the goddess of "sensual pleasures". She is often found in the company of the Gratiae, or Three Graces. 

Some Roman authors mention a goddess named Volupia, a name which appears to signify "willingness".. She had a temple, the Sacellum Volupiae, on the Via Nova, by the Porta Romana. Sacrifices were offered to the Diva Angerona there. 

The corresponding goddess in Greek mythology is Hedone.
