The Action Is Go is the fourth studio album by American stoner rock band Fu Manchu. It features new drummer Brant Bjork (Kyuss) and new lead guitarist Bob Balch, replacing Eddie Glass and Ruben Romano, who left to form the band Nebula. The album was produced by Jay Noel Yuenger of White Zombie, who contributed some additional instrumentation.

According to AllMusic, the new lineup provided Fu Manchu with "the impetus and inspiration to really start moving forward," and the resulting album demonstrates the band's "punk energy, classic rock drive, psychedelic crunch, and heavy-ass grind all at once."
