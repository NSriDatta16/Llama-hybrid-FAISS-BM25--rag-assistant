History
The village origin dates back to the 6th century A.D. That was period of rise of Turkic Khaganate (552 - 745), when settlements and fortified castles began to appear in the foothills and hilly area of Chirchik River. In the Middle Ages mountain routes leading from Semerechie and Ferghana to Chach (Tashkent) converged on the populated area inclusive Bog-i Ston.

Bog-i Ston has had two notable residents. The most known Sheikh Hovendi at-Tahur (Sheihantaur) was born here at the end of the 13th century. He was a Sayyid, meaning that he claimed descent from the Quraish, the tribe of the prophet Muhammad. His father, Sheikh Umar, was believed to be a direct descendant in the seventeenth generation of the second godly Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab, therefore male members of this family also bore the famous title of Khoja & Arif (Khwaja). Sheikh Khoja Umar was a devoted Sufi and one of the followers of Dervish Hasan Bulgari. He arrived in Tashkent with a mission to disseminate Islam. Then he went to Bog-i Ston, where at the end of his life Sheikh Khodja Umar has been buried ashore Pscem River. Young Sheihantaur was initiated into the Yasaviyya order of Dervishes in the town of Yasi (now Turkestan in modern-day Kazakhstan) where already at that time the Sufi Sheikh Khoja Ahmad Yasavi, the founder of the order, was revered. After long wanderings around Ma wara'u'n-nahr, Sheihantaur came to Tashkent where he remained in the memory of the people as the wisest of the wise. He was brought to the earth according to his value between 1355 and 1360 in Tashkent.
