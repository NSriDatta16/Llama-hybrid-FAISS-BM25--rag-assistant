Death

Rey-Bellet was shot and killed in her parents' home in the Swiss village of Les Crosets, Canton of Valais on Sunday, 30 April 2006 by her husband Gerold Stadler. She was three months pregnant. Her brother Alain, who was to have been married the following Friday, was also killed, and her mother Verena was severely injured. Corinne and Stadler's two-year-old son, home at the time of the attack, was left unharmed. 

A warrant was issued for the arrest of her husband. The couple had separated approximately 10 days before the murders took place. His body was recovered in a forest on 3 May 2006, Stadler having killed himself roughly 36 hours before. Stadler – a 34-year-old private banker with Credit Suisse and a captain in the Swiss Armed Forces – used his service pistol, which all Swiss men under the age of 42 are issued, in the shooting. Rey-Bellet's parents expressed their forgiveness of Stadler in his obituary.
