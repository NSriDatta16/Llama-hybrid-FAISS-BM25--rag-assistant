Ha Tsuen (), or Ha Tsuen Heung () is an area at the west of Yuen Long Town in Hong Kong. Administratively, it belongs to Yuen Long District.

History
During the Hungwu reign (1368-1398) of the Ming Dynasty, two members of Tang clans in Kam Tin left for Ha Tsuen as they saw the potentials of this place as markets and places of producing fish and salt.
These two members of Tang clans, Tang Hung-wai and Tang Hung-chi, built two villages there. The two villages are Tseung Kong Wai (, formerly Sai Tau Lei) and Tung Tau Tsuen (, formerly Tung Tau Lei).

As the Tang clan grew, additional villages were established. These included Tung Tau Tsuen, Hong Mei Tsuen, Lo Uk Tsuen, Tseung Kong Wai, San Wai, Sik Kong Tsuen and Sik Kong Wai.

The Tang Ancestral Hall (), also known as Yau Kung Tong (), was constructed by the Tang Clan of Ha Tsuen to commemorate their two founding ancestors, Tang Hung-chi and Tang Hung-wai, for establishing the village settlements in Ha Tsuen. Construction of the Ancestral Hall began in 1749 and was completed in 1750. It is a declared monument.

Ha Tsuen was once an important port and market because of the water transport system. There are rivers flowing to Deep Bay; in the past, boats from Canton and other places could reach Ha Tsuen.
