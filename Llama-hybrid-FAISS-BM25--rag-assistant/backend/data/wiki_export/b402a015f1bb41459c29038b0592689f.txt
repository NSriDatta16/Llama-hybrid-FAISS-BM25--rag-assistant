Career

Amateur
Vide attended high school while playing for TSV Munich 1860's youth team in Munich, Germany. He played four years at the University of Virginia as a defensive midfielder and became a regular for the Cavaliers by his senior year.  In 2004, he spent the collegiate off season with the Richmond Kickers Future in the USL Premier Development League.

Professional
Vide was selected fifth overall in the 2006 MLS Supplemental Draft by MetroStars. He made his MLS debut July 4, 2006 as a substitute against Los Angeles Galaxy. He would go on to appear in 7 matches for the re-branded New York Red Bulls during the season, including two starts.

After not featuring in the clubs plans during the early part of the 2007 campaign, Vide began to receive significant playing time earning 16 appearances and 13 starts due to injuries to first team midfielders Claudio Reyna and Dema Kovalenko. He also made his playoff debut against New England Revolution on November 3, playing 77 minutes. His tenacious play and ability on the ball in the center of the field was a revelation and quickly established Vide as a fan favorite.
