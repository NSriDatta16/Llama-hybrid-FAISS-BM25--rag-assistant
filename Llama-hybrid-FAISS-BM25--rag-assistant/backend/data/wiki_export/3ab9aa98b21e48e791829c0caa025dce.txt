All the Way was an Australian television series made by Crawford Productions for the Nine Network in 1988.

The series was set in the 1960s. The first episode took place on the date of the John F. Kennedy assassination. The series examined the life of an Australian family during the decade of Lyndon B. Johnson, the Vietnam War, civil rights activism and The Beatles, linked by three sisters (played by Diana Davidson, Maggie Millar and Rowena Wallace).

A young Dannii Minogue was in the cast. All the Way started as a six-part TV mini-series during April 1988.

A follow-on series screened out of ratings period starting in November 1988. It failed to catch on with audiences and was cancelled after 32 episodes.
