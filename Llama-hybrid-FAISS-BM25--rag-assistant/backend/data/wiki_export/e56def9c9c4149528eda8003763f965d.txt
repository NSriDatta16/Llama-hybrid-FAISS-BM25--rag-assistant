Professional career

Chicago Bears

The Chicago Bears selected Dvoracek in the third round of the 2006 NFL Draft. He missed most of his rookie season after sustaining a foot injury in the preseason.

Dvoracek started his first professional game against the San Diego Chargers on September 9, 2007, but left the game with a season ending torn ACL injury.

Dvoracek recovered during the 2008 offseason, injured his calf before the Bears training camp. He was placed on season-ending injured reserve with elbow bursitis on December 9. He finished the 2008 season with 29 tackles and two passes defensed on 12 games (all starts).

Dvoracek suffered a sprained MCL during the Bears second preseason game on August 22, 2009. He underwent arthroscopic knee surgery to assess the severity of the injury. The examination concluded that Dvoracek had also injured his ACL, and would miss the 2009 season. He was waived/injured on August 31 and subsequently reverted to injured reserve, his fourth consecutive year ending on the IR list.

Omaha Nighthawks
Dvoracek was signed by the Omaha Nighthawks in 2010. He was re-signed by the team on July 15, 2011. He was let go after the 2011 season.
