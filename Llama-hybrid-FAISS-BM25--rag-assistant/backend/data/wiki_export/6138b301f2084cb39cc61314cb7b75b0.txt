Early career

Academic career
Before immigrating to Israel in 1976, Eidelberg wrote a trilogy on America’s founding fathers: The Philosophy of the American Constitution (), On the Silence of the Declaration of Independence (), and a Discourse on Statesmanship ().

In 1976 he joined the faculty of Bar-Ilan University, and holds adjunct positions at Otago University in New Zealand and The University of Georgia.

He has written several books on the Arab-Israel conflict and on Judaism. Demophrenia () analyses the mentality of Israel’s ruling elites.  Jewish Statesmanship: Lest Israel Fall (), which has been translated into Hebrew and Russian, discusses what he sees as the flaws inherent in Israel’s system of governance and how they may be remedied.  His work, A Jewish Philosophy of History (), investigates the world-historical events leading to the rebirth of Israel in 1948.

Policy and politics
Eidelberg is on the Advisory Council of the , which has published many of his policy papers. In addition to writing more than 1,000 articles for newspapers and scholarly journals in the U.S. and Israel, he is a weekly guest on The Tamar Yonah Show on Arutz Sheva radio.

In 2003, Eidelberg's Yamin Yisrael ran with Herut – The National Movement for the Knesset elections of that year. The joint list fell 8,000 votes short of the electoral threshold. After the elections Herut and Yamin Yisrael parted ways.

In 2005, Yamin Yisrael merged with the Jewish National Front. Eidelberg stood number seven on the JNF's list for the Israeli Knesset for the 2006 election. The party did not pass Israel's electoral threshold. Yamin Yisrael and the JNF have since parted ways due to political and ideological differences.
