Karongasaurus (meaning Karonga lizard) is a genus of titanosaur sauropod dinosaur from the Early Cretaceous. The type species, K. gittelmani, was described by Elizabeth Gomani in 2005.

Discovery and naming
The holotype (specimen Mal-175), consisting solely of part of a lower mandible and twenty isolated teeth, were found in the Dinosaur Beds of Malawi between 1987 and 1992. Karongasaurus was the first dinosaur named in a publication that was published solely online; Karongasaurus gittelmani was named and described by Gomani (2005).

Description
The mandible of Karongasaurus is U-shaped in dorsal view and the teeth are described as slender and conical in shape, being more cylindrical than those of Malawisaurus.

Classification
Gomani (2005) placed Karongasaurus within Titanosauria.
