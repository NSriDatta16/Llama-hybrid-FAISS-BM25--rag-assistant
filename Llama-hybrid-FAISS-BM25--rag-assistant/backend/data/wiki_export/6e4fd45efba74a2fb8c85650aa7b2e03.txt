History
The district was the subject of the C. H. v. Oliva, a religious freedom case in which mother Carol Hood sued Grace Oliva, her son Zachary's first grade teacher, and related administrators in the Medford Township Public Schools for a 1996 incident in which her son was not allowed to read a section of the Bible in his kindergarten class. After courts rejected the family's claim, calling the students a "captive audience", the Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear the case in 2001.
