History
When William Smith was appointed postmaster for a new post office to be located about five miles west of Livonia in 1900, the residents of this rural area had to come up with a name. After some thought, and no consensus was able to be reached, it was suggested that a drawing be held.  Lottie Raby's name was drawn and this southern Pointe Coupee post office has been named for her for over a century.
