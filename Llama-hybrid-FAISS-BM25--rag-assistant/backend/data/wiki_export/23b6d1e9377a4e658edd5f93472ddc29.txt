The accessory cephalic vein is a variable vein that passes along the radial border of the forearm to join the cephalic vein distal/inferior to the elbow. It may arise from a dorsal forearm venous plexus, or from the ulnar/medial side of the dorsal venous network of hand. In some cases the accessory cephalic springs from the cephalic above the wrist and joins it again higher up. A large oblique branch frequently connects the basilic and cephalic veins on the back of the forearm.
