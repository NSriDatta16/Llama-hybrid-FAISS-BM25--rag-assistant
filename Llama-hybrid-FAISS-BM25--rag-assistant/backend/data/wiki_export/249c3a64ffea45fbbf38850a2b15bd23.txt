It is mostly used for general aviation, but is also served by one commercial airline, an affiliate of Delta Connection, with freight services provided by an affiliate of FedEx Feeder

It is included in the FAA National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017–2021, in which it is categorized as a non-hub primary commercial service facility.

The airport regularly hosts airshows and aircraft displays of antique aircraft. Aircraft like the B-29 Superfortress and the B-24 Liberator have made stops at the airport for access by the public.

History
Alpena County Regional Airport was founded after World War 1. It was formally dedicated in 1931, and the US Army Air Corps used the airport for training purposes until 1947, at which time it was handed over to Alpena County. The airport has been assigned to the Air National Guard since 1952 and is used for training.

The airport started updates to its passenger terminal in the 1990s. Great Lakes Airlines provided service to Chicago until 1997, when Northwest Airlines began flights to Detroit with regional partner Mesaba Airlines. In 1999, the  airport became eligible for Federal Airport Improvement Funds, which currently serve as the primary funding source for airport development. SkyWest Airlines began servicing the airport in 2012 on behalf of Delta Connection.

In 2020, the airport received $17 million as part of the federal CARES act to upgrade facilities and maintain operational levels during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The airport has had increasing passenger numbers throughout its history. In 2021, the airport received a $1 million subsidy from the FAA after passing a 10,000 enplanement threshold that year.

In 2015, the airport was the site of drone test flights in order for the FAA to develop standards for integrating drones into national airspace.

In early 2022, Alpena County and the airport were sued by Huron Aviation, the fuel provider at the airport, over concerns that the airport was trying to break up Huron's business relationship with SkyWest and seize control of the airport's fuel farm, which Huron Aviation claims to have invested in to build. Huron Aviation said Alpena sought quotes from competitors AvFuel and Alpena Ground Services in hopes they would offer lower quotes that the county could offer SkyWest. If SkyWest took a competing offer, Huron says it would have breached its contract with the county, giving the county the right to seize the fuel farm and give it to another provider. The county denies the allegations.

In 2022, SkyWest provided controversy when they cut direct flights at Alpena, instead operating tag flights between Delta hubs via, at different times, Sault Ste. Marie and Pellston. The company had wanted to add flights to Minneapolis as well as Detroit in the summer of 2022, but it failed to sustain the FAA approval to do so.

Alpena County Regional Airport covers an area of  at an elevation of  above mean sea level. It has two runways with concrete surfaces: 1/19 is 9,001 by 150 feet (2,744 × 46 m) and 7/25 is 5,028 by 100 feet (1,533 × 30 m).

For the 12-month period ending August 31, 2021, the airport had 5,252 aircraft operations (down from 9,790 in 2010), or roughly 14 per day: 44% military, 40% general aviation, and 20% air taxi.

In Media
Several scenes of the film Die Hard 2 were shot there. The location was chosen in part because there was a need for snow, and the producers expected Alpena to produce. However, due to a lack of snowfall, artificial snow had to be used. Consequently, other filming was done at Kincheloe Air Force Base in Michigan's Upper Peninsula.

Accidents & Incidents
On August 12, 1984, a Piper PA-12 was involved in an accident at the airport.
On March 13, 1986, an Embraer EMB-110P1 Bandeirante operated by Simmons Airlines crashed while attempting an ILS approach in bad weather. The aircraft was attempting a second approach after going around  the first time. The probable cause was found to be the flight crew's continued descent below the glideslope and through the published decision height without obtaining visual references of the runway. Contributing to the accident was an insufficient weather dissemination system. Three of the nine occupants were killed.
On March 13, 2006, a Saab 340B operated by Mesaba Airlines was substantially damaged on the ground before departing from the airport. After the engines were started for a flight to Detroit, it was found a stroller from an inbound passenger had not been offloaded. The pilots shut down the left engine to ease access. The agent retrieving the stroller lost their balance while exiting the aircraft; they dropped the stroller, which was subsequently blown under the fuselage by wind and into the aircraft's right main landing gear before impacting the right engine's propellers, which were spinning. Fragments from the stroller struck the fuselage after passing through the propeller, puncturing three holes and causing dents. The probable cause was found to be the station agent's inability to maintain control of the stroller when he lost his balance while exiting the cargo compartment. A contributing factor was high, gusting winds.
