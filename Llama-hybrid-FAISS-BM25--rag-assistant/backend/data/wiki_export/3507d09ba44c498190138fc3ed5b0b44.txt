The 2007 IIHF Women's World Championships were held from April 3 to 10, 2007 in Winnipeg and Selkirk, Manitoba, Canada.  There were no championships in 2006 due to the Torino Olympic tournament.  Games were played at the MTS Centre and Selkirk Recreation Complex.

It was the tenth event, and it was run by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF).  Canada, led by tournament MVP Hayley Wickenheiser, won its ninth world championship by defeating the USA 5–1 in the gold medal game.  Following Sweden's historic Silver in the Olympics they captured their second world championship Bronze, blanking rival Finland 1–0.  This championship stands as the only women's to have over one hundred thousand attendees.

In June 2006, the IIHF expanded Pool A from 8 to 9 teams, restoring Russia, which had been demoted to Division I after the 2005 event.  The decision was made due to the success of the 9-team pool in the 2004 Championships. Because of this change, all teams demoted after the 2005 event were restored to their 2005 divisions for 2007.  Three new countries entered the tournament for the first time in 2007.
