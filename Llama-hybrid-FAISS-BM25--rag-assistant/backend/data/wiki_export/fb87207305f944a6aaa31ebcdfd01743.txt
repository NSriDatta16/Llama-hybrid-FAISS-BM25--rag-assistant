Music video
Directed by Marcos Siega, the music video for "Boom" was shot in London in 2002. It was later included on her first DVD, The Video Collection. In the beginning of the video, a car is driving along and the radio plays "One Day in Your Life" in the background. Suddenly the car stops and a light flash is seen in the sky. Then the song starts and Anastacia is performing it on a small stage in front of a crowd. During the video, several people get beamed up to this party, some of them being soccer players.
