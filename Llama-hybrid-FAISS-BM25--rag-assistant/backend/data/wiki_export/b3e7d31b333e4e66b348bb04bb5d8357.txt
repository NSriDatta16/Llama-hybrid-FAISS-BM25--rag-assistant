Harlem School of the Arts (HSA) is an art school in Harlem, Manhattan, New York City, United States.

Harlem School of the Arts was founded in 1964, by soprano Dorothy Maynor. Maynor was succeeded by mezzo-soprano Betty Allen as President in 1979, when a new 37,000 square foot facility designed by Ulrich Franzen was completed. Other presidents included Allicia Adams, Camille Akjeu, and Daryl Durham. Eric G. Pryor was president and CEO between  August 2015 and December 2019. Currently, Lisa Davis and Kenneth W. Taber act as Interim Co-Chairs.

In 2005, the school was among 406 New York City arts and social service institutions to receive part of a $20 million grant from the Carnegie Corporation, which was made possible through a donation by then New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Despite the Great Recession of 2010, the Harlem School of the Arts stabilized its fiscal position following a $6 million gift.

Courses 
The school offers courses in four disciplines: music, theatre, visual arts, and dance. Courses in music include classical, jazz, gospel, R & B, electronic, and world music. Dance courses include ballet, modern, ethnic, jazz, and tap dance. In addition to theater classes, the visual art department offers courses that include sculpture and photography (digital and film). The school's students are of diverse cultural backgrounds with more than 85% of the students being African American or Latino. HSA provides financial aid on a first-come, first-served basis through the generous donations of the Herb Alpert Foundation and other generous benefactors. The school also offers private lessons in various disciplines, including multiple instruments along with dance, digital art, animation, cinematography, and acting.

Early history

In 1964, concert soprano Dorothy Maynor opened the Harlem School of the Arts in the basement of the St. James Presbyterian Church in Harlem at a time when the community suffered severe physical blight, high levels of poverty, and few cultural resources for its young people. The school was featured in the May 1966 issue of Ebony Magazine.

In May 1979, under the leadership of Maynor's handpicked successor, opera singer Betty Allen, HSA opened its 37,000 square-foot, facility at the base of Hamilton Heights.
