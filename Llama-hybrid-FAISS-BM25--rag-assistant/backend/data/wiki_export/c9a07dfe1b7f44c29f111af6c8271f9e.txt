Marcus Bullen (born 12 July 1982) is a former Australian rules footballer in the Australian Football League for the Essendon Football Club.

However 2005 was a brown patch for him in his short career and he only managed 7 games for the season.

After his delisting from Essendon, Bullen moved to Adelaide in 2006 and signed on for the Port Adelaide Magpies in the SANFL where his appearances were restricted due to injury. 

In 2007, he switched to the Silvan Football Club in the Yarra Valley Mountain District Football League.
