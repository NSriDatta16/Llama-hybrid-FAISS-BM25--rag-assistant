He made his Championship debut against Leicester City six days later.  Manager Darren Ferguson was later quoted saying "Bobby's a really good goalkeeper. The save he made in the first-half was outstanding, but he also gives us something we haven't had from our goalkeepers in recent seasons and that's excellent communication skills".

Olejnik was one of Posh's most prominent players during the 2012–13 campaign, making 275 saves, the most by any goalkeeper in the Championship.
