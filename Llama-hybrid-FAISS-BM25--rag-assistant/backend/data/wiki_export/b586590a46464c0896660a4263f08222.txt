Citizens Panel on a Clean Elections Option
Lawton was a commissioner on the 1997 "Citizens Panel on a Clean Elections Option" that was formed due to the "growing perception of corruption" within the political system.  The panel outlined a public policy plan for full-public financing of political campaigns that would "pass constitutional muster."  The panel was also known as the "Heffernan Commission" referring to the retired Wisconsin Supreme Court Chief Justice, Nathan Heffernan, who chaired the panel.
