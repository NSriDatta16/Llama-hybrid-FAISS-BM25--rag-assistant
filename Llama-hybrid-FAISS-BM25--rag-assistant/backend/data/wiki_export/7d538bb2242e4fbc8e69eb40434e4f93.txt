History
The Muskegon Mohawks franchise were purchased by Larry Gordon following the 1983–84 season for $1 and renamed the Lumberjacks following a name-the-team contest.  The Lumberjacks name came from the high level of importance that the lumber industry had in Muskegon's history. The team moved to Cleveland, Ohio, in 1992 and was renamed the Cleveland Lumberjacks.
