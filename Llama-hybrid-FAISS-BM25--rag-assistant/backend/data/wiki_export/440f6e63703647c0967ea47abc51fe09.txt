Melbourne Sports Centres - MSAC is an international sporting venue located in Albert Park, Victoria, Australia. The centre was opened on 24 July 1997 at a construction cost of A$65 million. The cost was funded by the State Government of Victoria and the City of Port Phillip. The centre has hosted international events including the 2006 Commonwealth Games and the 2007 World Aquatics Championships.

The centre has several swimming pools and international standard diving facilities. There is a large multi-purpose sports hall used for sports such as badminton, basketball, table tennis and volleyball, and also squash courts and a gym.

It is one of four sporting facilities in Melbourne - the others being the State Netball and Hockey Centre (SNHC), the MSAC Institute of Training (MIT) and Lakeside Stadium - to be named under the banner of Melbourne Sports Centres, and is operated by the State Sports Centres Trust.

The centre is accessible by tram routes 12 and 96 which both pass near Southern Cross railway station and the Melbourne City Centre.

Construction

Stage 1
The first part of MSAC's construction was completed in 1997. This included the majority of the facilities currently at MSAC including the indoor pools and the sports hall.

Stage 2
In 2002, it was announced that MSAC would be expanded in time for the 2006 Commonwealth Games. A new hydrotherapy pool, a new 50 metre outdoor pool and improved transport links were some of the facilities added in the $51 million expansion. Work began on the Stage 2 project in September 2003. The expansion opened in early 2006. Since then, a movable floor was installed in the 50m outdoor pool which allows the water depth to be varied.
