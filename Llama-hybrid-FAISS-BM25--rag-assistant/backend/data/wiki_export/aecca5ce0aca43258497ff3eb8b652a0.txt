Freestyle skiing has been contested at the Winter Olympic Games since the 1992 Winter Games in Albertville, France.

Summary

History

Freestyle skiing was a demonstration sport at the 1988 Winter Olympics, with moguls, aerials, and ballet events. Moguls became an official medal sport at the 1992 games, while aerials and ballet were still demonstration events. At the 1994 games, aerials also became an official medal event and the ski ballet competition was dropped. For the 2010 Winter Olympics, ski cross was added to the program while for the 2014 Winter Olympics half-pipe and slopestyle were added.

Alexandre Bilodeau became the first freestyle skiing gold medalist to defend his Olympic title, and first repeat gold medalist, winning the men's moguls at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, having previously won the same event at the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics.
