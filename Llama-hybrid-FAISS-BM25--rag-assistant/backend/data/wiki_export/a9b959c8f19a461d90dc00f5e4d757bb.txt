History
European settlement began in 1800 when Tomás Garcia, from Minas Gerais, took possession of a vast area of land called Campo Limpo.  He sold half of the land to Jerônimo de Teixeira.  At the beginning of the twentieth century the railroad arrived and a town grew around the station.  Campo Limpo became a district of Catalão in 1913, later separating to become a municipality in 1931 and changing the name to Goiandira, after the name of the railroad station.
