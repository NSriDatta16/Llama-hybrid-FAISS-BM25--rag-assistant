History
The club was established in 1911. After the Second World War, the club played in the Exeter and Devon League, which in 1972 was renamed the Devon and Exeter league. They joined the South Western Football League in 1974, after winning the Devon and Exeter League the season before. After only two seasons, Ottery moved on to the Western League's newly created Division One. The club's fifth season in Division One marked their debut in the FA Cup, when they lost to Newquay 8–0 in the preliminary qualifying round. The 1989–90 season saw the club earn a further upward move – finishing in top position in the First Division and earning a place in the Premier Division. Two seasons of struggle in the Premier Division ensued, and after relegation another two seasons of struggle in Division One.

At the end of the 1993–94 season the club finished bottom of Division One and joined the Devon County League. The club remained in the Devon County League, with a best placing achieved in the 2005–06 season of 4th, until 2007 when it joined the newly formed South West Peninsula League Division One East. During 2011–12 the club resigned from the South West Peninsula League and left the league at the end of the season finishing bottom of the league with just 5 points. The club joined the Devon and Exeter League in Division Three, under new manager Graham Varley.
