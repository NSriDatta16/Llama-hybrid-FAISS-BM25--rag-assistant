History 
In 2020, WBJEE exam was conducted on 2 February 2020 for admissions to various undergraduate engineering courses in West Bengal. 
From 2012, the old pattern was Phased out and the WBJEE would consist of only MCQ questions which differs from the previous years by the fact that 2 Marks Short answers type questions are replaced by MCQ with the same weightage of marks. In 2016 there will be a different type of pattern in Biology question paper.  Category-I consists of (Q.1 to Q.90) carrying one mark each, for which only one option is correct. Category-II consists of (Q.91 to Q.105) carrying two marks each, for which only one option is correct. Category-III consists of (Q.106 to Q.120) carrying two marks each, for which one or more than one option may be correct.  Starting from 2012, all papers consist of 80 MCQ type question divided in two section. Section one consists of 60 MCQs of 1 marks each and Section two consists of the remaining 20 MCQs of 2 marks each.
Negative marking is applicable. 30% of the total marks of a question will be deducted for every incorrect answer. 
In 2006, the WBJEE contained only objective-type MCQ (Multiple Choice Question) type questions. This announcement attracted mixed reactions with some applauding it as a step towards the future while others have said that opting for MCQ when other tests were slowly phasing out MCQ because of studies showing MCQ failed to properly judge aptitude is a folly.

The WBJEE 2008 was Postponed Due To Paper Leak, after the Physics, Chemistry and Biology papers were leaked. Two persons, Arun Chowdhury and Mihir Dandapatt, were arrested on Saturday in West Midnapore's Ghatal, where the three papers were being sold for Rs 2.5 lacs.

WBJEE 2011 exam was postponed from 17 April 2011 to 22 May due to election date issues in West Bengal.
