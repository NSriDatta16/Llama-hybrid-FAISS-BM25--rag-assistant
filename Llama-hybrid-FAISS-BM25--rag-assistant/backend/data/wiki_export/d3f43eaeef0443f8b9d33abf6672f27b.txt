History 
Opened by the North British Railway in 1890 (as part of the approach routes linking the Edinburgh and Northern Railway to the new Forth Rail Bridge), it became part of the London and North Eastern Railway during the Grouping of 1923. The line then passed on to the Scottish Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. When Sectorisation was introduced by British Rail, the station was served by the ScotRail sector until the Privatisation of British Railways. The station has won numerous awards for its gardens.
