Channel S is a UK-based, free-to-air television channel targeting the British Bangladeshi community. The channel was established on 16 December 2004 by Mahee Ferdous Jalil, a Bangladeshi businessman in London. On Sky it at first had a timesharing deal with ATN Global, and then in 2005 began to broadcast for 24 hours, 7 days a week; it is currently available on Sky channel 777.

The television station is based at Prestige House in Walthamstow, north-east London. It broadcasts programmes in Standard Bengali, Sylheti and a few in British English. It is the first Bangladeshi channel to broadcast a significant content in Sylheti which has built up a loyal following among Bangladeshis in the United Kingdom, of whom the majority come from Sylhet.

A survey in the UK found Channel S was the most viewed Bengali TV channel in the UK.

Controversy

In June 2007, First Solution Money Transfer, a financial services company run by at least one the managing directors of Channel S went into liquidation owing the public hundreds of thousands of pounds. Mahee Ferdous Jalil, the chairman of Channel S, filed for an injunction against Bangla TV to prevent allegations of impropriety by Channel S or its chairman from being broadcast as well as defamations cases against a number of prominent businessmen who had made the allegations.

As of April 2008, Channel S (including other Bengali channels) was under investigation by Ofcom for a breach of the Communications Act 2003, after airing election adverts for the Liberal Democrats during the 2008 London mayoral election. The channel accepted adverts from the local Liberal Democrats candidate, Jalal Rajonuddin. Ofcom found Channel S guilty of breaching the TV Advertising Code.

On 4 August 2008, according to the City of London police, Mahee Ferdous Jalil (Mohammed Ferdhaus) founder of the channel (along with many others) was found guilty, at Croydon Crown Court, of car insurance fraud and sentenced to an 18 months prison term. The group were involved in a plot to make false car insurance claims and were ordered to pay compensation costs to the AXA insurance company. Since the arrest of Jalil, a media war broke out with Channel S and Bangla TV. It was noted that Bangla TV broadcast negative news coverage against Jalil and Channel S, leading to propaganda and different speculations of the event. It raised much concern among the community and politicians, which many thought was an attack against Channel S by Bangla TV. He was released after serving 7 months of his term, as he appeared at the Channel S Community Awards on 30 March 2009. It is now confirmed that Jalil has pleaded guilty for insurance scam and is awaiting sentence. This will be the 2nd time Jalil will be in His Majesty's pleasure. He has already served 7 months of his 15 months sentence for insurance fraud.
