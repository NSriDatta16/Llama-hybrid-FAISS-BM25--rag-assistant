Shaw-Han Liem, better known by the alias I Am Robot and Proud, is a Canadian indie electronic musician and video game designer from Toronto, Ontario. He has released albums under the labels Catmobile, Darla and & Records. He co-created the PlayStation 3 and PS Vita game Sound Shapes.

History
Liem was born and raised in Toronto, Ontario. Classically trained as a pianist, Liem taught himself how to play guitar and began creating electronic music under the name I Am Robot and Proud in 2000 while completing a degree in computer science. He has also been a member of Sea Snakes and Tusks, and has worked with Jim Guthrie and Nathan Lawr.

While Liem generally writes and records on his own, 2015's Lights and Waves is the first album conceived and recorded with Liem's live band. The recording was prompted by the composing of band-focused arrangements of his previous work. The I am Robot and Proud live band consists of Toronto musicians Robin Buckley, Mike Smith and Jordan Howard.  Previous members have included Jim Guthrie, Samir Khan, Gus Weinkauf, Simon Osbourne and Jeremy Strachan.

In 2007, he participated in the global launch events for Tenori-On, an instrument designed by Toshio Iwai. In 2009, Liem collaborated on a performance with media artist Daito Manabe, combining Manabe's physical music visualizations with improvised composition. In 2010 he also performed a live collaboration set with Boredoms drummer Senju Muneomi and Tokyo computer-composer Yuri Miyauchi.

Liem collaborated with game designer Jonathan Mak on PlayStation 3 and PS Vita game Sound Shapes, serving as a co-designer and composer. He participated in a roundtable discussion on the topic of independent videogame music at the 2009 Game Developers Conference together with the composers of independent game titles PixelJunk Eden, Flower and Night Game. Sound Shapes won the 2012 Game Critics Awards for best mobile/handheld game, and was declared E3 Game of Show by 1UP.com. It also won Best Song and Best Mobile game at the Spike Video Game Awards.
