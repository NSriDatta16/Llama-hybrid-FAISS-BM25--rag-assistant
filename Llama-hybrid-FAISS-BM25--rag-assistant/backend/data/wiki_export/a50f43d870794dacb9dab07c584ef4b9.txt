Carilion Clinic is a Roanoke, Virginia-based non-profit integrated health care organization. Carilion owns and operates seven hospitals in the western part of Virginia, such as Radford University Carilion, and a joint venture medical school and research institute with Virginia Tech. The system consists of hospitals, primary and specialty physician practices, pharmacies, health clubs and other complementary services. Carilion has more than 13,200 employees with 737 physicians covering more than 70 specialties at 225 practice sites, making it the largest employer in the Roanoke Valley.

History

Carilion originated with Roanoke Memorial Hospital, founded in 1899 and located at the base of Mill Mountain in southwest Roanoke. The hospital expanded into related health care services and the acquisition of other hospitals beginning in the mid 1900s. Most prominent was the acquisition of the competing Community Hospital of Roanoke Valley in downtown Roanoke. The deal took several years to complete because of anti-trust concerns by the United States Department of Justice that two of the three major hospitals in the Roanoke Valley would now be under the same ownership.  In the early 1990s, Roanoke Memorial adopted the name Carilion for its consolidated health care business. In 2019, Carilion announced plans to spend $300 million expanding services at Roanoke Memorial Hospital.

Carilion Clinic reorganization 

In 2006, Carilion's management warned that trends in the health care sector threatened to undermine the organization's financial position. In response, Carilion announced plans for a significant business restructuring in which it would shift its focus from operating hospitals to hiring more physicians in more medical specialties, with the main objective of improving patient care coordination and placing a focus on medical education and research.

The plan was developed after visits to the Mayo Clinic and other similar organizations. As part of the reorganization plan, Carilion renamed itself Carilion Clinic. The vision for moving Carilion toward the "clinic" model was spearheaded by CEO Ed Murphy, who left Carilion in 2011 to work with a New York and London based firm in order to help develop ways to better manage and coordinate physicians and services provided by hospitals.

Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine and Research Institute

Carilion and Virginia Tech partnered to form the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine and Research Institute, which was established on January 1, 2007, and accepted its first class in 2010.  The medical school is a fully accredited 4-year medical school by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education. In December 2018, the Virginia Tech Carilion Research Institute was renamed the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at VTC in recognition of a $50 million gift from the Horace G. Fralin Charitable Trust, and Heywood and Cynthia Fralin.

Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine is adjacent to the Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital and features the Hokie Stone used to build most buildings on Virginia Tech's campus.

The school also offers residency and fellowship programs.

The 13 accredited residency programs include dermatology, emergency medicine, family medicine, general hospital dentistry, internal medicine, neurology, neurosurgery, Obstetrics/Gynecology, pediatrics, plastic surgery, podiatry, psychiatry and surgery.

The 11 accredited fellowship programs are adult joint reconstruction, cardiovascular disease, child and adolescent psychiatry, emergency medical services, gastroenterology, Geriatric medicine, Geriatric psychiatry, hospice and palliative care, infectious disease, interventional cardiology, and pulmonary critical care.

Many physicians and executives at Carilion teach courses at VTCSOM.

Radford University Carilion

In early 2018, Carilion Clinic, Jefferson College of Health Sciences and Radford University joined together to announce the intent to merge Jefferson College into the Radford University family of colleges and departments. The merger was effective July 2019, and the college became Radford University Carilion.

Jefferson College of Health Sciences was the oldest hospital-based college in Virginia offering undergraduate and graduate programs of study. It was founded by Dr. Hugh Trout Sr. as the Jefferson Hospital School of Nursing.

Carilion Clinic partners with the college to provide residencies and fellowships for students. It is housed in Carilion Roanoke Community Hospital, and features skill laboratories and science laboratories for chemistry, microbiology, physics and anatomy and physiology.
