The Australian Defence College (ADC) comprises three joint education and training organisations operated by the Australian Defence Force in Canberra, Australian Capital Territory:
 the War College, 
 the Australian Defence Force Training Centre (ADFTC), and 
 the Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA).

The ADC is commanded by a two-star officer, currently Major General Mick Ryan since January 2018. Each of the educational organisations is commanded by a one-star officer or Colonel (equivalent), titled Commandant of their organisation.

In 2019, the Australian Defence College implemented its biggest organisational reform in almost two decades. The changes included the amalgamation of the Centre for Defence and Strategic Studies and the Australian Command and Staff College to form the Australian War College, to focus on Joint Professional Military Education. Individual training delivered by the Australian Defence Force Warfare Training Centre, Peace Operations Training Centre, Defence Force Chaplains College, Defence International Training Centre, and Defence Force School of Languages was centralised in the Australian Defence Force Training Centre.

The first two organisations are sited at a campus at Weston, ACT.

History of Australian Defence College
The current Australian Defence College has its origins in the report of the Defence Efficiency Review from May 1997. The report recommended sweeping changes to officer education in the Australian Defence Force.

The Australian Defence College (ADC) was officially opened on 18 January 1999 by the Hon Bruce Scott MP, Minister Assisting the Minister of Defence. The founding Commander of the ADC was Rear Admiral Raydon Gates CSM, RAN.

The first two courses that were run at the new ADC in 1999 were the Defence Staff Course (DSC) and the Defence and Strategic Studies Course (DSSC). In 2000 these two courses were merged to form one course, the Defence and Strategic Studies Course.

On 14 March 2001 the then Governor–General, Sir William Deane, officially opened the Australian Command and Staff College (ACSC). Prior to this date, middle management officer Command and Staff training was conducted at separate single Service staff colleges:
 the RAN Staff Course at HMAS Penguin in Sydney, New South Wales;
 the Army Command and Staff Course was conducted at Fort Queenscliff in Victoria; and
 the RAAF Staff Course at RAAF Fairbairn in the Australian Capital Territory.

On 1 October 2007 the Australian Defence Force Warfare Centre (ADFWC) came under command of the Commander ADC, as part of the Vice Chief of the Defence Force Group.

In July 2017, the Australian Defence College transferred to the new Joint Capabilities Group.
