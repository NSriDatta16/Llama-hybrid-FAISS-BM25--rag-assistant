The National Solo class is a racing dinghy designed by Jack Holt in 1956. The Solo is sailed in the United Kingdom, Holland, Portugal and Australia.

Originally designed in wood, competitive boats are now widely available in Fibre Reinforced Plastic (FRP) or composite construction (FRP hull and wood deck) as well as wood.

2016 was the 60th anniversary of the design and the Class Association organised a series of events to celebrate. A draw of all National Solo Class Association members was made in which the prize was Solo 6000.

2017 Class Measurement rule changes allowed corrector weights to be moved from aft end of centreboard cast to below the thwart.
