Little Qualicum Falls Provincial Park is a provincial park in British Columbia, Canada, on central Vancouver Island, that encompasses the entire southern shore of Cameron Lake. The Island Rail Corridor line to Port Alberni passes through the park.

History
Little Qualicum Falls Provincial Park was originally established as a park in 1940 to protect the old growth Douglas Fir forest.

Activities
Swimming, fishing, campgrounds and day-use areas are available within the park, as well as sail boarding due to a wind funnel created by the surrounding mountains, Mount Wesley to the north and Mount Arrowsmith to the south. The park maintains 6Â km of walking trails within its perimeter.
