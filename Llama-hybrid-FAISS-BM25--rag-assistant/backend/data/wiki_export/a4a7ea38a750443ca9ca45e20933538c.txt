Plot

In 1998, Ron Clark leaves his teaching at an elementary school in his North Carolina hometown, where he is known for his innovative teaching methods which results in raising test scores. He decides to look for a teaching job in a tough New York inner city school where he feels he could be more useful. He finds a job at Inner Harlem Elementary School, where the students are sorted according to their potential.

The principal of the school believes Clark may be too "nice-looking," to take on the rough, disruptive students in a sixth-grade class that has just been abandoned by their teacher. He offers Clark a third-grade class, but Clark insists on taking the older kids that nobody else wants. He quickly learns that it will be a battle of wills between himself and his students to see who can outlast the other. He struggles to understand them, both individually and collectively, before he can teach them the standardized materials.
