It is open 24 hours everyday to vehicles approved by the Transport Department; including residents' coaches, goods vehicles for goods delivery and servicing functions, and Hong Kong Government vehicles are allowed to use the tunnel. The toll charge ranges between HK$ 50.00 to 250.00 depending on the type of vehicle.
