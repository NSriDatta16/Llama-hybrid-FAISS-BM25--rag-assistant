Professional wrestling career
Sawafuji debuted in 2000 in Toryumon, where he later adopted the persona and ring name of Milano Collection A. T., an Italian fashion aficionado/supermodel, wearing lavish coats and trunks and walking to the ring with an invisible dog named Mikeru to much more success, and upon his arrival in Japan, he was the ace of Toryumon's T2P class. In 2002, he won the T2P Strongest Merit Assessment League defeating Masato Yoshino and received the NWA International Light Heavyweight Championship for the win. He then went on to form the Italian Connection with YOSSINO and YASSINI. The unit eventually added members Pescatore Yagi, Condotti Shuji and mascot Venezia. With the closure of T2P in July 2003, he joined the Toryumon main roster. In mid-2006, he began training at the Texas Wrestling Academy in San Antonio, Texas at the urging of WWE's Shoichi Funaki, and trained under Rudy Boy Gonzalez. During his tenure in the TWA, he held the Television Championship for 8 months. He also wrestled for many other American wrestling federations, including East Coast Wrestling Association, Ring of Honor (ROH), NWA Anarchy, Chikara and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, where he took part in the 2008 World X Cup as part of Team Japan, winning his first and only singles match for TNA against Curry Man, gaining 2 points for his team. He then competed at Victory Road in the third round, which was a four team triple elimination match, dominating early in the match before getting eliminated.

After returning to Japan full time in 2007, he began working for New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), as a part of the R.I.S.E. faction. He received his first title opportunity in New Japan on November 6, 2006, unsuccessfully challenging Tiger Mask IV for the NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship. He achieved his greatest success in both New Japan and as a professional wrestler in 2007 when he won New Japan Pro-Wrestling's Best of the Super Juniors tournament, defeating Wataru Inoue in the final. In August, he took part in the G1 Climax, finishing with 2 wins and 4 points. In November, he teamed with Hirooki Goto as R.I.S.E in the G1 Tag League, making it to the semi-finals where they were eliminated by Hiroshi Tanahashi and Koji Kanemoto.

On January 18, 2010, Sawafuji announced his retirement from professional wrestling because of inferior oblique muscle palsy, brought on by an excessively strong thrust kick to the eye by Gedo. A retirement ceremony was held on February 14.

Sawafuji remains with New Japan as a member of the IWGP Championship Committee and a color commentator.
