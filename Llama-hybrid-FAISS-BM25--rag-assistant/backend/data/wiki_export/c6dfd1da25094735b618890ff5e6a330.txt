Political and social commentary
Green writes political and social commentary for the US edition of The Spectator, the New York Post, the Jewish Chronicle, the Daily Telegraph, and The Wall Street Journal. Green's opinion pieces include frequent criticism of President Joe Biden as "senile" or mentally impaired and having "low energy", praise for President Donald Trump's policies and victory "on points" in the 2020 United States presidential debates, Greene criticised the FBI's criminal investigation of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, and Prince Andrew for failing to act quickly enough.

Jewish identity
Green has provoked controversy with articles on Jewish identity, criticising Joe Biden's agenda as "bad for the Jews" In response to Green's analysis, David Aaronovitch said that Green's politics are "Lindberghian" and warned that Green's characterisation of Jews is inaccurate and itself fosters antisemitism. Aaronovitch took special issue with Green criticising Biden for formally recognising the Armenian genocide, since it damaged relations with Turkey, arguing that all Jews should support recognising genocides against people, regardless of impact.
