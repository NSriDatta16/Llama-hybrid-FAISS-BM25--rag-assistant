John Birmingham's Axis of Time trilogy features several major characters and many minor characters.

Admiral Phillip Kolhammer USN
Born in 1969, Admiral Kolhammer served in the First Gulf War and is the Commander of UNPROFLEET. He is an American of German extraction and Jewish ethnicity. By the Transition Act of 1942, Admiral Kolhammer is the commandant of the "Special Administrative Zone".

Brigadier Michael Barnes
Head of the Australian Contingent and Commanding Officer of the Second Cavalry, and the highest-ranked Army officer mentioned so far, Brigadier Barnes' billet was possibly the overall command of UNPROFLEET's Land Forces.

Brigadier Barnes was named after a long-time friend of Birmingham

Captain Karen Halabi RN
Karen Halabi is the CO of HMS Trident, Deputy Commander of UNPROFLEET and Head of the British Contingent. She is the daughter of a Pakistani father and a British mother. She joined the navy to escape from her abusive father. She is a strong-minded and skilled commander. During the events of the books, her mixed heritage and female gender cause problems with several people in the British high command who see her as unfit to command; however she gains the support of Winston Churchill and the British Royal Family.

General J. "Lonesome" Jones, USMC
CO of the 82nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade, Jones is a recipient of the Medal of Honor for rescuing the crew of an incapacitated M1A2 Abrams tank. He was married to a Frenchwoman who worked for Médecins Sans Frontières named Monique Danton. Her brother was a seaman assigned to the Robert Dessaix, and after it joined the German side, there was a backlash against Jones.

Captain Mike Judge USN
Executive Officer and later Captain of the USS Hillary Clinton, the Texan's next assignment is to take over production of fighter planes in The Zone.
After the Clinton's refit, Captain Judge was once again her Captain as she sailed into harm's way. During the interval between Designated Targets and Final Impact, Judge married the British Captain Karen Halabi.

Captain Jane Willet RAN
Captain Willet is the commander of HMAS Havoc, the only submarine to come through with the fleet. She is known to have had a younger sister who was executed by Islamic Extremists in Indonesia whilst doing relief work.

Prince Henry
Colonel Prince Henry Charles Albert David "Harry" Windsor is an officer of the British 22nd SAS Regiment and also is third in line to the throne, behind his older brother, King William V and William's two unnamed children (presumably Prince George and Princess Charlotte). After returning to the regiment "at the reduced rank of Captain", Prince Harry is billeted to HMAS Havoc, where he is captured by the Transition. He has the least bumpy switch of the Multinational Taskforce, due to being a royal. Additionally, he was placed on the Civil List as soon as his identity comes to light. He used that money to fund a tab at the local pub near his Regimental HQ for his officers and men who could run there and back under a certain time.
