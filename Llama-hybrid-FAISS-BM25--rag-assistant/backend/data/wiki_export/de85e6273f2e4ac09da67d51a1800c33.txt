The programme began as Today South West on 4 January 1982, then in 1987 it was renamed Today and in 1989, it became TSW Today.

When Television South West lost its licence to broadcast on Channel 3 and Westcountry Television took over the South West franchise, TSW Today was replaced by Westcountry Live.
