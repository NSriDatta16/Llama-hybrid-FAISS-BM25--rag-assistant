Las Caritas ("The faces") is a collection of Indian inscriptions in a rock formation looking out over Lake Enriquillo in the Dominican Republic. The place is also called the Trono de Enriquillo ("Enriquillo's throne") because it is said the Ta√≠no leader Enriquillo used to camp here during his rebellion.
