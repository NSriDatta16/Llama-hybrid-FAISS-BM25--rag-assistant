The Keystone Junior Hockey League (KJHL) is a Junior 'B' ice hockey league in the province of Manitoba, Canada. The league, sanctioned by Hockey Manitoba, was formerly known as the Manitoba Junior 'B' Hockey League.

History 
The KJHL champion used to play the champion of the Northwest Junior Hockey League (NJHL) for the Baldy Northcott Trophy. Since the demise of the NJHL in 2004, the KJHL has been the only Junior 'B' league in the province; thus its champion has been awarded the provincial title. The provincial champion moves on to compete for the Western Canadian Junior 'B' championship, the Keystone Cup.

In 2018, five southern teams of the KJHL announced they were leaving and forming their own league, the Capital Region Junior Hockey League (CRJHL). The five departing clubs Arborg Ice Dawgs, Lundar Falcons, North Winnipeg Satelites, Selkirk Fishermen and St. Malo Warriors cited travel costs as well as parents expressing concerns for bus travel in light of the 2018 Humboldt Broncos bus tragedy. The Fisher River Hawks also announced they would be taking a one-year leave of absence from the league.

The league added another team after their 2019 AGM with the NCN Flames joining for the 2019–20 season. NCN Flames last competed in the Northwest Junior Hockey League in 2004 winning two league championships and one Baldy Northcott Trophy (2002).

The league added a sixth franchise in the PBCN Selects (Peter Ballantyne Cree Nation) at their 2022 AGM. Selects play out of the historic Whitney Forum out of Flin Flon, Manitoba.

The following AGM the league announced the addition of a seventh franchise for the 2023–24 season.  The Waywayseecappo Wild will be the new franchise.
