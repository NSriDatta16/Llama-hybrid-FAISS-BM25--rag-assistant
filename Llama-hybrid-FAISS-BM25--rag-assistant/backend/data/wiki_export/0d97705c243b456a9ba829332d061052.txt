Penrith Rugby Club, known as the Emus, is an Australian rugby union club based in Penrith, a western suburb of Sydney, New South Wales. The club was formed in 1965 as Nepean and renamed Penrith in 1981 and began playing in the Shute Shield in 1995 until their removal midway through the 2018 competition. Sydney Rugby Union chairman David Begg said the Emus had failed to 'meet the standards set for all clubs to compete at the premiership level'. The club was readmitted to the competition for the 2020 season before being dropped again ahead of the 2022 season.
