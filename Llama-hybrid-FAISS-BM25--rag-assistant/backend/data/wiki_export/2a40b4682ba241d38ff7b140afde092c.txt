Critical reception
AllMusic editor Jim Smith described the song as "soulful dance", noting that Londonbeat's "pleasant harmonies and pumping flow are undeniably catchy." Another editor, Stephen Thomas Erlewine, called it "dazzling". David Taylor-Wilson from Bay Area Reporter declared it as "infectious", remarking that the band "blends Motownlike harmonies with dance grooves that incorporate ’70s funk rhythms". A reviewer from Billboard complimented its "tasty blend" an "an unshakable pop hook." Steve Morse from Boston Globe declared it as "a catchy soul-funk ditty" and "a deserved hit". Marisa Fox from Entertainment Weekly noted its "hypnotically catchy chorus, sweet harmonies, and slow, rollicking beat." Dave Sholin from the Gavin Report commented, "It's always a treat when a song comes along that I can't wait to review. Impossible not to detect a Fine Young Cannibals influence on this production that's been the biggest buzz record for the past couple of weeks." He added, "An international smash that's gone to #1 in no less than eleven countries, it's destined to win over audiences in the U.S.A., too. Top 40 radio is in dire need of more music like this!" 

Pan-European magazine Music & Media wrote, "C&W-tinged pop number underpins the band's characteristic massed gospel vocal style complete with jangling, melodic guitars and the sort of chorus which they patently lacked on their debut LP Speak. The first release from the forthcoming second LP In the Blood shows a definite maturity." David Giles from Music Week found that the band have "taken note of dancefloor developments and ditched the go go based rhythms of old for a deep-rooted funkiness and R&B influenced vocal." Holden, Stephen from New York Times wrote, "Londonbeat is a textbook example of a group that recombines familiar pop-soul sounds in a personal and engaging way. Its single [...] blends the light, machine-driven rhythms of Soul II Soul with the post-Motown vocal style of Fine Young Cannibals." Parry Gettelman from Orlando Sentinel noted that "its dance groove is blended with lush, postmodern R&B played on both synthesized and gen-u-ine instruments." Ian Cranna from Smash Hits said the rhythm is "straight out of the Stock, Aitken & Watermans book of bounciness." Bob Mack from Spin felt it "is too damn catchy."

Impact and legacy
"I've Been Thinking About You" was awarded one of BMI's Pop Awards in the category for Million Performance Songs in 1993, honoring the songwriters, composers and music publishers of the song.

Australian music channel Max included the song in their list of "1000 Greatest Songs of All Time" in 2013.

American magazine Billboard placed "I've Been Thinking About You" at number 158 in their ranking of "Billboards Top Songs of the '90s" in 2019.
