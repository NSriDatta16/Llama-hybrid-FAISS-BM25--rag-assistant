History

In the fall of 1949, East Texas State president James Gee first announced the construction of the Field House and Memorial Stadium. At a cost of $325,000, the crews of George L. Dahl were able to complete the project in just over a year. Since the original structure was built, there was a renovation in 1969 that included a two-story addition for classrooms and offices, a dressing room and a storage area. A third renovation came in 1991 to include the installation of new bleachers, scoreboards, heating and ventilation and a refurbishment of the one-acre maple hardwood floor. In 2009, the Field House received its most modern renovations with a brand new playing floor, digital scoreboards, new ventilation and heating, more efficient lighting, renovations to offices and classrooms, new basketball goals with digital shot-clocks.
