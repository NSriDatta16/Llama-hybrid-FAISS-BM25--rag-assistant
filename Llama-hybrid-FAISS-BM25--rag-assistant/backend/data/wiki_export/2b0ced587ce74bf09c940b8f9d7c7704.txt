Raritan Landing is a historical unincorporated community located within Piscataway Township in Middlesex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, which was once an inland port, the farthest upstream point ocean-going ships could reach along the Raritan River, across from New Brunswick. Begun in the early 18th century it remained vital until the mid 19th century, when most of the port was abandoned.

The remains of the community now reside buried beneath Johnson Park on the south side of River Road, Remnants of the era, mostly the bluff overlooking the Raritan, include the Cornelius Low House,  Metlar-Bodine House, and the Road Up Raritan Historic District and an archeological site. The nearby East Jersey Olde Towne Village is home to a permanent exhibition about the Raritan Landing.

History
Raritan Landing emerged as a vital port community during the 1720s.  It was situated at the farthest inland point on the Raritan River that could be navigated by merchant ships of the day.  In its heyday, the Landing was the center for local trade and, along with New Brunswick, served as a hub for imports and exports to and from the Raritan Valley.  Agricultural goods and lumber brought to Raritan Landing from throughout central New Jersey were stored in warehouses here, awaiting shipment to either New York or sometimes the Caribbean.  Imported goods were off-loaded and taken by traders to stores and merchants throughout the area.  The majority of the community existed between present-day River Road and the Raritan River, near the intersection of Landing Lane and River Road.  By the 1740s, there were approximately 70 structures and more than 100 inhabitants.

By the early days of the American Revolution the community was occupied by British troops.  The bluffs provided safe haven for the troops, and an unobstructed lookout toward New Brunswick, enabling clear views of approaching Patriot forces.
