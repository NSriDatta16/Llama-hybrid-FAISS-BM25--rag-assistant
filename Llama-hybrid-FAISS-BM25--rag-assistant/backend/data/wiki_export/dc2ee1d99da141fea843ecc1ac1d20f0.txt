The band formed in 2004 by brothers Solomon "Soul Glow Activatur" Olds, Joshua "Fatty" Olds, and Jacob "Crouton" Olds along with their two friends, Nathan "Nadaddy" Currin and Brad "20 Cent" Allen, who was later replaced by Derek "Chapstique" Mount. The group has released five studio albums, nine EPs, and two remix albums. They are often noted for their raucous, party-centric personae and eclectic mix of genres, ranging from rap metal to dance-pop.

In 2018, the remaining two members, Jacob and Joshua Olds, re-branded the group as FF5 and released the EP El Compadre on March 2 of that year. The band played their most recent show on March 17 of that year.

History

Formation (1993–2003) 

Family Force 5 was formed in Atlanta, Georgia, under their original name, The Brothers. Three of the five original members, Solomon ("Soul Glow Activatur") and twins Joshua ("Fatty") and Jacob ("Crouton"), are sons of Jerome Olds, a Christian artist popular in the late 1980s. The Brothers released Fact and Reality in 1994 and RPM in 1995. Both albums were released on Star Song Records and produced by their father.

The group changed their name to "Ground Noise", which they classified as "a really bad version of Third Day". Shortly after, the three brothers added Derek Mount ("Chap Stique") and Nathan "Nate" Currin ("Nadaddy"). They then renamed their group The Phamily.

A decade later, the band signed with Maverick Records, for distribution to the mainstream market before signing to Gotee Records for the Christian market. Under the name "The Phamily", the band sought a dual recording deal to better distribute their music to both the mainstream and Christian markets. According to Solomon Olds, "To me, and pretty much anybody that's under my age, most Christian music is a turnoff. I don't want to be affiliated with that. I want to be affiliated with something that is great music. I feel that Maverick and Gotee together can pull that off." The group was then forced to change their name again, due to copyright issues with Prince's band, The Family.

Family Force 5 and mainstream success (2004–2007) 
On March 21, 2006, the band released their first full-length album Business Up Front/Party in the Back under their new name "Family Force 5", which was an instant hit in both the Christian and mainstream markets spawning several hit singles such as "Love Addict" and "Earthquake". Both of these songs, like many others on the album, are heavily focused around the guitar. Their debut album has been both disparaged and praised by Christian and non-Christian critics respectively for not containing overtly Christian content in any of its tracks. In March 2007, their debut album was re-released as Business Up Front/Party in the Back: Diamond Edition, which contains three previously unreleased songs.
During this time, Family Force 5 contributed the song "Mind's Eye" for the compilation album Freaked! A Gotee Tribute to DC Talk's Jesus Freak. For Christmas, Family Force 5 released a few Christmas-themed audio blogs. They also recorded "Grandma", a cover of "Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer". Also a new unreleased song, "Whatcha Gonna Do with It", was added to the Hip Hope Hits: 2008 album. Another previously unreleased song, "Master of Disguise", was posted on YouTube. However, due to mixed fan reaction to the song it was not slated for release at the time.

Dance or Die (2008) 

In June 2008, Family Force 5 released an EP entitled Dance or Die EP to debut three songs from their upcoming album Dance or Die. On August 19, 2008, the full-length album was released taking on a more club oriented, electronic dance sound than Business Up Front/Party in the Back with less guitar. The full-length album, Dance or Die, received a favorable review in World Magazine.

Blake Soloman of AbsolutePunk.net had the following to say about the album; "Even though Family Force 5 may be the musical equivalent of mixing Mentos and Coke—lots of build up for something that only ever happens one way—I find myself oddly pleased with Dance or Die."

Dance or Die sold 17,000 copies in its first week and debuted at 30 on the Billboard 200. By the end of January, the album had sold over 50,000 units and during early 2009 the band embarked on the AP tour from March to May promoting the album and headlining concerts throughout the U.S. In December 2008, the band won the Best Christian Rock Artist, Best Crunk Rock/Rap Artist and Best Rock Album for Dance or Die at the Rock on Request Awards.

Remix album and Christmas Pageant (2009)

It featured remixes by The Secret Handshake, 3OH!3, Danger Radio, Jasen Rauch of Red, Matt Thiessen of Relient K, David Crowder of David Crowder Band, Alex Suarez of Cobra Starship, and more. The album debuted at No. 180 on the Billboard 200, No. 15 on the Christian Albums chart and No. 6 on the Dance/Electronic Albums chart.

Around this time, Solomon Olds created a remix of the song "Best Night of Our Lives" by Everyday Sunday.

On September 5, the band unveiled a new song called "Keep the Party Alive" which was featured on an EP, titled Keep the Party Alive EP.

In mid-November 2009, the band hit the road on the Christmas Pageant Tour. On this tour was House of Heroes, Remedy Drive, and All Left Out. On the tour they performed their versions of Christmas classics as well as their very own originals. On November 30 it was announced by lead singer Soul Glow Activatur's Twitter that Joshua (Fatty) had been admitted to the ICU of a local hospital and that a kidney specialist had been called in after his condition deteriorated. Later it was confirmed that he was suffering from kidney failure and that he was undergoing dialysis treatment. The band at first vowed to continue the current tour they were on, The Christmas Pageant Tour, so as not to disappoint fans.
