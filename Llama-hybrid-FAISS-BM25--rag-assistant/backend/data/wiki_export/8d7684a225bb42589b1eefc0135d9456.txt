Production

The film features an all-star cast: in addition to the famous Livanov-Solomin duo as Holmes and Watson, the film stars the internationally acclaimed actor/director Nikita Mikhalkov as Sir Henry Baskerville and the Russian movie legend Oleg Yankovsky as Jack Stapleton. The hound uses the simple but effective device of painting a skull on the dog's face.
