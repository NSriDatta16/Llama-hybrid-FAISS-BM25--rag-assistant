History

Indigenous
The Baranggum people lived in the region for thousands of years before British colonisation. They spoke the now extinct Barunggam language.
They appear to have had kinship ties with the neighbouring Mandandanji, Bigambul and Yiman people.

The name Chinchilla is a corruption of the Aboriginal word "tintinchilla" or "jinchilla" indicating cypress pine, possibly recorded by explorer and naturalist Ludwig Leichhardt.

British colonisation

British exploration through the region began in the 1840s, most notably with the 1844 expedition of Ludwig Leichhardt. Leichhardt named Charleys Creek (upon which the modern town of Chinchilla is located) after Charley Fisher, a Wiradjuri man who accompanied Leichhardt's group.

In 1847, British pastoralist squatter, Matthew Buscall Goggs, claimed around 37,000 acres of land along the Condamine River and Charleys Creek, calling his property Chinchilla. He fought a long war with the resident Baranggum people to take ownership. In 1849, with the help of military actions of Native Police units under Frederick Walker, Goggs was able to defeat and disperse most of the Baranggum resistance. In 1857, Goggs the sold Chinchilla property for £25,000 to the influential pastoralist and politician Gideon Lang.

The town of Chinchilla was established in 1877. As the Western railway line was extended west across the Darling Downs from Toowoomba and Dalby, a temporary construction camp was established on the banks of Charley's Creek which developed into a town.
