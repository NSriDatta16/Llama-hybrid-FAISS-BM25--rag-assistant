A sled dog race was included as a demonstration event at the 1932 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid. Five contestants from Canada and seven contestants from the United States competed.  The event, run under the rules of the New England Sled Dog Club, ran twice over a 25.1 mile (40.5 km) long course. With six dogs per sled, each sled took off at three-minute intervals, and intermediate times were given to the mushers at 4 miles (6.44 km), 10.6 miles (17.06 km), and 22.46 miles (36.14 km).

Qualification
Norman D. Vaughan qualified for the event through a race held by the New England Sled Dog Club in Wonalancet, New Hampshire in the winter of 1932.

Twenty-six teams were entered in the two-day event, which was held two weeks before the Olympics.

It was thought that Emile St. Godard would be unable to compete in the event because of the lack of financial support.

Results

Participating nations
