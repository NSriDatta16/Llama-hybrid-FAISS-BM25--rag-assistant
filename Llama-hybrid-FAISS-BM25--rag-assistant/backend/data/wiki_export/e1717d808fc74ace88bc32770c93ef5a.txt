"Rain" is a song by English synth-pop duo Erasure. It is the third single from Erasure's eighth studio album, Cowboy (1997). Mute Records distributed the single on CD and vinyl in the UK and Europe. Some releases, titled Rain Plus, had so many remixes and live recordings, that the number of the tracks and their combined running-time made Rain Plus ineligible for ranking on the UK Singles Chart.
