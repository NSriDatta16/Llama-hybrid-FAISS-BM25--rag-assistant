NFL career statistics

Coaching career
Wilson was the Dallas Cowboys quarterback coach from 2000 to 2002. He became the Chicago Bears quarterbacks coach from 2004 until 2006, while reaching Super Bowl XLI and contributing to Rex Grossman having his best professional season.

On February 22, 2007, he was re-hired by the Cowboys, where he coached Tony Romo and Dak Prescott among other quarterbacks. He was one of the advocates who convinced the team to draft Prescott.

On September 1, 2007, Wilson was suspended five games and fined $100,000 for purchasing and using performance-enhancing drugs.  In his own defense, Wilson said that the drug HGH was used to help his problem with diabetes.  However, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell seemed to sidestep this defense, saying, "First of all, I'm not going to get into the personal situations of why Wade was taking it, but that's not an accurate point." In 2016, he had the second toe on his right foot amputated because of an infection caused by complications from his diabetes condition.

The Cowboys decided to part ways with Wilson following the 2017 season.

Personal life
Wilson died due to complications from Type 1 Diabetes, a disease he had for almost 30 years, at his home in Coppell, Texas on his 60th birthday.
