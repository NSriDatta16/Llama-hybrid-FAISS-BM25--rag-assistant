Stinson Theatres was a movie theatre chain in Central Ontario and the Georgian Triangle in Canada.

History
Founded in 1971 by Robert Stinson, Stinson Theatres grew from its original two-screen drive-in theatre in Barrie, Ontario, to 30 screens in six indoor locations and five screens at two drive-in locations. In 1996, Robert Stinson hired investment banker, Stan Medley, to take Stinson Theatres public. A new holding corporation was formed, Long Road Entertainment, Inc., and was listed on the US Pink Sheets in 2002, but Stinson Theaters was never put in the new holding company. Subsequently, plans to expand the company as a public company were abandoned and the public vehicle was sold to others and renamed in 2007.  Stinson Theaters was based in Barrie and slowly wound down following founder Robert Stinson's death in 2008 by his sons Henry and Timothy Stinson.
