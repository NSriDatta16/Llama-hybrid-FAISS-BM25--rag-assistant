Ece Ayhan Çağlar (September 10, 1931 in Muğla – July 13, 2002 in İzmir) was a contemporary Turkish poet. He used the name Ece Ayhan in his poems. He is one of the prominent figures of the II. New Movement, yet he preferred to refer to this movement as Civilian Poetry. His book Blind Cat Black and Orthodoxies features examples of homoerotic poetry in Modern Turkish literature.
