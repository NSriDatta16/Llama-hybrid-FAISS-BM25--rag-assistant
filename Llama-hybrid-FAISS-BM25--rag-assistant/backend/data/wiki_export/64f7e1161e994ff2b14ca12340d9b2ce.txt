Life and work
 
Joe Henderson was born in Illinois and raised in Iowa.  He became an avid runner at age 14, and was an Iowa state high school track and cross country champion.  He ran for Drake University, then started his writing career at the Des Moines Register in 1966.  He wrote for Track and Field News from 1967 to 1969.

In 1970, Henderson joined Bob Anderson as chief editor for Runner's World magazine.  He brought aboard Dr. George Sheehan as the magazine's medical editor, after being introduced to him by Hal Higdon during the 1968 Summer Olympics (Higdon was writing features for Runner's World at the time).  Henderson wrote articles for Runner's World for 33 years.  He was Bob Anderson's first full-time employee.

In 2001, Henderson co-authored The Running Encyclopedia with Richard Benyo.  He appears as a keynote speaker at running expos and events, and is recognized as one of the world's foremost authorities on running.

He currently teaches running classes at the University of Oregon and coaches marathon training teams in Eugene, Oregon.
