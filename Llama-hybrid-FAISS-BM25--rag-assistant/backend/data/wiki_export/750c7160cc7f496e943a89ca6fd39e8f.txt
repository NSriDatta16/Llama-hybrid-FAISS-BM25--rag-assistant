2006 congressional campaign

Craig Foltin ran for the  against trial lawyer Betty Sutton. Although the 13th was one of the most Democratic districts in Ohio, the Republicans had high hopes for Foltin since he was the Republican mayor of a heavily Democratic city. However, Foltin could not overcome the strong anti-Republican mood in the district or the presence of the district's incumbent congressman, Sherrod Brown, atop the ballot as the Democratic candidate for Senate. He was defeated, gaining only 39 percent of the vote. In May 2007, Foltin announced his resignation as mayor of Lorain effective August 1, 2007 to take the Executive Vice-President of Finance position at Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland, Ohio.
