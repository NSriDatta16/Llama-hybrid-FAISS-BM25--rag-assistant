History
Hue University, formerly known as The University of Huế, was initially established in March 1957. After the reunification of the country in 1975, independent universities were established in Hue on the basis of the existing faculties of The University of Hue. According to the Government Decree No. 30/ND-CP dated 4 April 1994, Hue University has been re-established by reorganizing all Hue-based universities. Hue University is responsible for training students at undergraduate and postgraduate levels, conducting research and applying science and technology in a multitude of disciplines to serve the construction and development of the country in general and Central Vietnam and Western Highlands in particular.
