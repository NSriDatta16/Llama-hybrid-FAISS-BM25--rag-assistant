2007–08
In 2007–08, the Wolverines may have had the best regular season in TBJBHL history, outside of the 2003–04 Thunder Bay Northern Hawks undefeated season.  After going 24–1–5, the Wolverines found themselves, again, in the finals against the Northern Hawks.  The Hawks won Game 1 5–1, but the Wolverines countered with 5–0 and 6–3 victories in the next two games.

The next game, the Wolverines fell to the Norway House North Stars 5–1.  In the third game of the tournament, the Wolverines lost 6–1 to the Sherwood Park Knights and later that night they lost 8–1 to the Grandview Steelers.  They finished off their third Keystone Cup tournament with a 5–1 loss to the Selkirk Fishermen.

In 2008 it was announced that the Wolverines would be the hosts of the 2009 Keystone Cup tournament.  They finished the Thunder Bay Jr. B season in first place with a 25–5–0 record.  In the league final, the Wolverines defeated the Thunder Bay Northern Hawks 4-games-straight to win the league.

The Wolverines finished the tournament round robin with a perfect 5–0 record by defeating the Prairie Junior Hockey League's Saskatoon Royals 3–0.  The final round robin game was marred by a brawl late in the third period, instigated by the Royals.  In the final, the Wolverines faced the Sockeyes again.  The Wolverines led multiple times in the game, but the Sockeyes tied the game midway through the third period to force overtime.  It took a second overtime frame, but the Wolverines eventually lost to the Sockeyes by a score of 6–5.  The Silver Medal performance at the 2009 Keystone Cup marked the best performance by a Thunder Bay Junior B team since the 1999 Fort William Hurricanes won the Keystone Cup championship.

On June 14, 2009, the Thunder Bay Wolverines were promoted to Junior A as members of the Superior International Junior Hockey League.

2009–10

Mid-season, the Wolverines moved to Schreiber, Ontario.  The entire league schedule was altered to reflect this and the league was informed of the move.  After only a couple of games, the team was moved back to Thunder Bay and their website claimed that the move to Schreiber was never meant to be permanent.

The Wolverines finished fourth in the league, but lost the league quarter-final to an underdog Fort Frances Lakers.

On June 7, 2010, the Wolverines unceremoniously and without stated reason left the SIJHL.  For owner Bill MacLaurin, this was the third time he had dropped ownership of a team in the SIJHL (first was the Featherman Hawks and second was the Schreiber Diesels).  This was after a second season was announced by the club, that the team would be moving to the Fort William First Nation Arena, and tryout dates were given.
