Anchor is the first album by Trespassers William, released in 1999 on Sonikwire Records. The album is long out of print, but has found new life on iTunes, due to their exposure on The O.C. and One Tree Hill. While no songs from Anchor are on either show, fans of their sound have sought out previous releases.

While there is growing interest for the album to be re-printed, the band has yet to do so. The band's guitarist, Matt Brown, said on KEXP that "...we've been hesitant to re-press it because we made it about ten years ago..."

Compared to the band's later albums, Different Stars and Having, it can be seen as being more pop than the sound they later had. Tracks such as "Cabinet" have funk-style bass-lines.
