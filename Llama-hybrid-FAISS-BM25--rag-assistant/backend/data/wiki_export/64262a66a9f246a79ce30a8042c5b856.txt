Music for Two is an album of duets by Edgar Meyer and Béla Fleck created and recorded while touring to support Perpetual Motion and released by Sony Classical in 2004.  Most of the pieces are original compositions by Meyer and Fleck, working alone and together.  They also perform four of their arrangements of music by J. S. Bach, an arrangement of a sonata by Henry Eccles, and piece by Miles Davis.

The album includes a bonus DVD with a video documentary of the making of Music For Two from footage taken by Fleck's brother Sascha Paladino and concert footage.
