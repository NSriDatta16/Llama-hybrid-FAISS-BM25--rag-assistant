In 1956, Hinton attended a baseball tryout camp, where he signed a contract with the Baltimore Orioles. He won two minor-league batting championships in the Orioles system, playing with the Aberdeen Pheasants of Class C Northern League in 1959 and the Stockton Ports of the Class C California League in 1960. The Orioles promoted Hinton to the Vancouver Mounties of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League during the 1960 season. Afraid they might lose Hinton in the 1960 Major League Baseball (MLB) expansion draft, the Orioles had Hinton fake a shoulder injury during winter league baseball. Despite this, the Washington Senators selected Hinton in the expansion draft.

The Senators optioned Hinton to the Indianapolis Indians of the Class AAA American Association before the regular season began.

In 1962, he had a .310 batting average, good for fourth in the American League, and finished second in stolen bases to Luis Aparicio.  Hit in the head with a pitch on September 5, 1963, Hinton was unconscious when he was carried off the field. He returned to the lineup eight days later, but felt limited by symptoms of the concussion. Hinton was named to represent the American League in the 1964 MLB All-Star Game.

After the 1964 season, the Senators traded Hinton to the Cleveland Indians for Bob Chance and Woodie Held. He was dealt to the California Angels for José Cardenal on November 29, 1967. Hinton batted .195 in the 1968 season with the Angels. Just before the 1969 season, the Angels traded Hinton back to the Indians for Lou Johnson. The Indians released Hinton after the 1971 season. In all, Hinton played six years with the Indians.

From 1972 to 2000, Hinton was head coach for the Howard University baseball team. Hinton led the Bison to their first Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference championship.

In 1982, he founded the Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association (MLBPAA), a non-profit organization which promotes the game of baseball, raises money for charities, inspires and educates youth through positive sport images and protects the dignity of the game through former players.
