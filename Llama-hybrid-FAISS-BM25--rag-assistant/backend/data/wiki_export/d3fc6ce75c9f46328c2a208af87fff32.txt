Judge founded the congregation of sisters whose "motherhouse" is located next to the high school; these sisters then donated a portion of the land to the archdiocese on which the school was built.

Curriculum 
The school offers ten Advanced Placement classes for sophomore, junior, and senior students: U.S. Government & Politics, English Language and Composition, Literature, Calculus, European History, U.S. History, Psychology, Physics, Environmental Science, and Biology.
