The French Tennis Federation stated that they would not select Cornet for the upcoming Fed Cup team tie against Belgium in February 2018, to allow her time to "prepare her defence" in front of an independent tribunal set up by WADA.

On 15 May, the ITF announced that the independent tribunal set up by WADA had cleared Cornet of the charge of missing the three out-of-competition drugs tests that were to be conducted between November 2016 and October 2017 because the Doping Control Officer (DCO) did not satisfy all of the requirements of article I.4.3 of the International Standard for Testing and Investigations in relation to the third missed drugs test. Specifically, the DCO did not do "what was reasonable in the circumstances (i.e. given the nature of the specified location) to try to locate Cornet, short of giving her any advance notice of the test". For that reason, the third missed drugs test declared against Cornet no longer stood.

On 22 July, she won her sixth WTA Tour singles title at the Swiss Open, held in Gstaad.

At the US Open, Cornet was given a code violation under Grand Slam rules for changing her shirt while on the court.

The next day, tournament officials clarified the policy by saying that players of any gender would be allowed to change their shirt while sitting in their chair, and female players could also change their shirts in a private location off the court, for which they would not be assessed a bathroom break.
