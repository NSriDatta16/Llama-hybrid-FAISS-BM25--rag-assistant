Green Hope School origins
The school is named for the historic Green Hope School, built in 1927. This rural school included grades 1 through 12. In 1952, it was renamed Green Hope Elementary School when the higher grades were reallocated to nearby Cary or Apex High Schools.

Green Hope High School today

Today's Green Hope High School opened in 1999. The present campus is about a mile away, across the road from the old building site.  It retained the name of the former school after lobbying by alumni.

It first opened for freshmen and sophomore students from neighboring overcrowded schools. It added a grade level for the two subsequent years and graduated its first senior class in 2002.

The school consists of a main three-story building, with additional modular classrooms adjacent. The Cary Tennis Park, operated by the town of Cary, which functions as the school's tennis practice facility, is located directly behind the school. Green Hope Elementary School and Park are located directly across the street from the Tennis Park.  Both schools are operated by Wake County Public School System.
