Perth Festival, named Perth International Arts Festival (PIAF) between 2000 and 2017, and sometimes referred to as the Festival of Perth, is Australia's longest-running cultural festival, held annually in Western Australia. The program features contemporary and classical music, dance, theatre, performance, literature and ideas, visual arts, large-scale public works. The main events of the festival take place every year, from February to March and the film program now known as Lotterywest Films runs from November to April, as part of the Perth Festival.

Perth Festival takes place and various indoor and outdoor venues across Perth. The festival is run by UWA in partnership with the state government and the Perth City Council. From 2004, the Festival carried Lotterywest branding, and Lotterywest was acknowledged as the Festival's "principal partner".
 
The artistic director for 2020 to 2023 is Iain Grandage.

History

The festival was created in 1953 by the University of Western Australia, making it the oldest international arts festival in Australia, and the oldest annual international multi-arts festival in the southern hemisphere.

The founder of the festival was a then UWA professor, Fred Alexander, Director of Adult Education, who was inspired by attending the Edinburgh Festival in 1951. Alexander's aim was "to offer the best cultural events that are available from British, European, American, Asian and Australian sources". The first festival, held in 1953, showcased theatre, ballet and film, drawing an audience of 42,000 people despite little publicity. It was held over the summer school holidays in January, for Summer School students, arranged by John Birman as a more formal extension of his previous summer school programmes.

In 1964, the Shakespeare's 400th anniversary, the New Fortune Theatre opened in the Arts Building, then the only replica of the 1599 London Fortune Playhouse. Another notable anniversary for the festival were its 21st anniversary coinciding with the opening of the Perth Concert Hall, and in 1979 festival it celebrated the 150th anniversary of the founding of the colony in 1829. In 1987 the festival opened at the same time as the final races of the America's Cup yacht race.

The festival expanded off-campus citywide in the 1960s, and by 1980 had hugely increased its audience, with an increase of 300 percent in paid attendances between 1976 and 1980. Some sources refer to it as the Festival of Perth in the 1980s. The festival broadened its appeal, in 1999 the newly-appointed artistic director, Séan Doran, announced a change of name to the Perth International Arts Festival, leading up to its 50th anniversary in 2003.

In 2004, the festival started carrying the Lotterywest branding, and Lotterywest was referred to as its "principal partner" in all communications. With new artistic director Lindy Hume and a new four-year strategic plan, there was a significant shift in direction for the festival: towards increased community involvement, and  developing stronger partnerships with local arts organisations and regional centres.

The branding was changed to simply "Perth Festival" by then director Wendy Martin and the board in 2018, although the registered company name was  still Perth International Arts Festival, as "the organiser of Perth Festival".

Description
Activities across the state include theatre, dance, music, film, visual arts and literature. Artists from around the world have participated in the festival.

Writers Festival 
Earlier Perth Festivals had poetry and literature as a component of the larger festival. By the 1990s the Perth Writers Festival was titled and marketed separately, for some time known as the Alcoa Perth Writers Festival (named after its sponsor, Alcoa).

By the 2000s the Writers Festival was well recognised by publishers from interstate and overseas. Keynote speakers and featured authors since then have included notable writers from Australia and overseas, such as Germaine Greer, Hilary Mantel, Ahdaf Soueif (2013 opener), Ben Okri, Esi Edugyan and Chloe Hooper.

It retained the branding as Perth Writers Festival, taking place for three days over a weekend, until it was extended to a run for a full week in 2018, when it changed to Perth Writers Week. It took place not only at the University Club of Western Australia, but also in public libraries, in bars and on the streets of the city. This continued in 2019.

In 2020 the programme was pared back to a weekend, and marketed as the Perth Festival's Literature & Ideas Weekend. The Literature & Ideas curator was author Sisonke Msimang.

Film programs

1953–1985
Films formed part of the Perth Festival's offerings since its inception in January 1953, being shown at the Somerville Auditorium at UWA. The first artistic director, John Birman, introduced many foreign films, and there was resistance at first. In 1957 a French film festival was held, and in 1959 the festival became for Birman "the establishment of an international film festival within the festival".

David Blenkinsop, taking over the reins of the Perth Festival in 1977, had a bigger budget to work with, and along with Sherry Hopkins, brought in a system whereby a committee would preview all films before deciding whether to include them in the film festival. Audiences rose from 21,000 in 1977 to 65,000 in 1985, but the festival was no longer bringing new films into the country, leaving that to Sydney and Melbourne. It did, however, make the Festival of Perth unique, being the only arts festival that had a successful film component attached to it.

1986 to present
With the Lotterywest rebranding and its acknowledgement as "principal partner" of PIAF in 2004, it was in this year that the film component took on the title of Lotterywest Films, and variants.

In 2010, Madeleine Bates, was appointed to the role of Program Manager: Film, after being head of film screenings at the Edinburgh International Film Festival.

 and for some years previously, the film festival part of the Perth Festival is known as Lotterywest Films. The film manager is Tom Vincent.

Funding
The festival was founded by and has operated from the University of Western Australia Nedlands campus since 1953. The University of Western Australia further supports the festival through the provision of services and resources. Lotterywest has supported the festival financially since 1992.

The festival also relies on corporate sponsors and partnerships for funding, with new organisations becoming involved each year.
