Early life and education

He was born Charles Avery Bradford in Chicago, Illinois. 

His sister Charlotte was also an actress, as was his mother Marie Stanley.  His father was a playwright.

Career

Avery appeared in a touring production of The Clansman as Governor Shrimp, before entering films with the Biograph Company in 1908.

From 1908 to 1909, Avery featured in 33 short films under the direction of D. W. Griffith, usually only in supporting roles and often alongside Mack Sennett.

In 1913, he tried his hand at directing, starting with Across the Alley at Keystone Studios.  Avery went on to direct Syd Chaplin in the Gussle series and Charles Murray in the Hogan series.  He also continued to act, notably in the first three Keystone Kops films.

Leaving directorial duties in the 1920s, Avery later played supporting roles in low-budget Westerns such as The Rambling Ranger and Western Rover.

On July 23, 1926, Avery was found dead in his Los Angeles home. His cause of death was acute dilation of the heart caused by chronic myocarditis.
