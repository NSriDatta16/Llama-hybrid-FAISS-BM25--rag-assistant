The Main Automotive-Armoured Directorate of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation (, abbr. GABTU; another translation: Main Directorate of Armoured Forces) is a department of the Russian Ministry of Defence which is subordinated to the Chief of Armaments and Munitions of the Armed Forces, vice-minister of defense ().

In January 1943, the Main Automobile Directorate (GAU) of the Red Army was formed.

In January 1946, the Main Automobile Directorate of the Red Army was transformed into the Automobile Directorate of the Armed Forces of the USSR.

In 1949, on the basis of the Automotive Directorate of the Armed Forces and the Tractor Directorate of the GAU of the Armed Forces, the Main Automotive and Tractor Directorate (GAVTU) was formed.

In 1953, the Main Automotive Directorate was transformed into the Autotractor Directorate (AVTU) of the Ministry of Defence.

In 1961, the Autotractor Directorate was transformed into the Central Autotractor Directorate (TSAVTU) of the Ministry of Defence.

In December 1982, the Central Automobile and Tractor Directorate of the Ministry of Defence was renamed the Main Automobile Directorate (GLAVTU) of the Ministry of Defence.

Main Armored Directorate 
In December 1994, the GBTU of the Russian Ministry of Defense and the GLAVTU of the Russian Ministry of Defense were reorganized into the Main Armored Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation (GABTU of the Russian Ministry of Defense). Today it is the main developer of military-technical policy in the field of military vehicles and armored weapons and equipment. It is also the main customer and supplier of armored and automotive equipment to the troops.

The T-80 performed so poorly that after the First Chechen War that General-Lieutenant A. Galkin, the head of the Main Armour Directorate, convinced the Minister of Defence to never again procure tanks with gas-turbine engines.

On November 22, 2019, the Main Armored Directorate was awarded the Diploma of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.
