He was born in Chicago, Illinois, son of William Wade and Anna Williams Hinshaw. He attended the public schools and Valparaiso University. He graduated from Princeton University in 1916 and pursued a postgraduate course in business administration at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor.

He served overseas as a First Lieutenant in the Sixteenth Railroad Engineers from May 1917 to September 1919 during and immediately after World War I. He was then discharged as a captain in the Corps of Engineers. He served as laborer, salesman, and manager in automotive manufacturing in Chicago from 1920 to 1926. He also engaged in investment banking in 1927 and 1928.

Hinshaw moved to Pasadena, California in 1929 and engaged in the real estate and insurance business. He was an unsuccessful candidate for election in 1936 to the Seventy-fifth Congress.
