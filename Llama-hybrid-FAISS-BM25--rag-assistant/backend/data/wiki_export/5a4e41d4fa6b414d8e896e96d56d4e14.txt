The Wolf () is a 2004 Spanish drama biographical film directed by Miguel Courtois. It stars Eduardo Noriega as the title character and José Coronado alongside Mélanie Doutey, Silvia Abascal, Santiago Ramos, and Jorge Sanz.

Plot
The film is based on the life of Mikel Lejarza (alias 'El Lobo'), an agent of the Spanish intelligence service in the early 1970s. During the last rales of the Francoist dictatorship, Lejarza infiltrated ETA, a paramilitary group seeking independence for the Basque Country.

He obstructed plans for a major prison breakout and a campaign of attacks. The secret services tried to demobilise him when he became less useful. However, he pursued his mission nevertheless, which became the most successful government initiative against ETA. Information he provided was responsible for the capture or killing of a quarter of its members, including some of its Special Forces members and leaders. He destabilized the organization when it was a potential justification for conservatives to seize power and stop the democratisation process.

ETA sentenced him to death and posted his pictures throughout the Basque country, in the hope of someone reporting his whereabouts. Mikel changed his name and face and has lived under an assumed identity ever since.
