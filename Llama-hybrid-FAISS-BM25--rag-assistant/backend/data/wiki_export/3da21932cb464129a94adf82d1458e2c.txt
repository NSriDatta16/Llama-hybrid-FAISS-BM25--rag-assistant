Yogurting was an online RPG of modern school life. It took place in "Estiva Academy" and "So-weol Academy" and solves the mystery of Endless Vacation Phenomenon.  This is an event that spanned the whole game, causing all teachers and schools to disappear, hence the name "endless vacation".

Scott Sharkey from 1UP.com awarded Yogurting for #2 in "Worst Games, Best Names" category.
