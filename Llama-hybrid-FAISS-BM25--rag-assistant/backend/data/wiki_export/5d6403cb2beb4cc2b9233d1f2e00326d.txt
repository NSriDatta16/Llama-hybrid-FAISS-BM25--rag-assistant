Books
Mainframe operating systems have an acquired dinosaur trope that even their manufacturers recognize.
Peter B. Galvin, co-author, notes that the series of books became informally known as the dinosaur book due to the illustrations on the front cover depicting the various operating systems as actual dinosaurs.
