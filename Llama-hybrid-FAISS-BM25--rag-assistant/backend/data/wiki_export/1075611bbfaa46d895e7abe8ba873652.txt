Rodolfo A. Falcón Cabrera (born October 25, 1972, in Havana, Cuba) is a 3-time Olympic swimmer from Cuba, and has been called the country's best swimmer ever. Since 2006, he has been the country's National Commissioner for swimming.

He swam for Cuba at the 1992, 1996, and 2000 Olympics. At the 1996 Games, he won the silver medal in the 100 back ahead of countryman Neisser Bent—these represent the one swimming Olympic medals won by a Cuban. Falcón retired from the sport in 2002.

At the 1998 Central American and Caribbean Games, he set the Championship Record in 100 backstroke at 56.00, which still stands as the record as of 2009.
