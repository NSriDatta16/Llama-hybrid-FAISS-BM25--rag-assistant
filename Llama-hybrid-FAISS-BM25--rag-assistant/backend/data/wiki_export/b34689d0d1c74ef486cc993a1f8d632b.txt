Biography
She comes from Bacolod and is a graduate of Saint Scholastica's College (batch 1967). A product of the 1970 Binibining Pilipinas beauty pageant, Aurora was sent to Osaka, Japan to compete, and eventually win, Miss International 1970. Her victory paved the Philippines to become the first country to win consecutively twice.
