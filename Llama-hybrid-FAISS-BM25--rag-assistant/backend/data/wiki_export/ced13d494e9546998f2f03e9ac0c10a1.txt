OUToberfest was a gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transsexual (LGBT) festival held annually during October in Jackson, Mississippi.

History 
It was established in 2005 for several reasons including:

A failure of Mississippi Pride organizers in 2004
An anti-gay constitutional amendment defining marriage in Mississippi
A need for positive and non-political LGBT awareness in Mississippi
A need for a stronger, more organized LGBT community in Mississippi

OUToberfest was initially conceptualized by Knol Aust, Duane Smith and Jenni Smith. Unity Mississippi was the official organizer of the event.

In 2012 it was announced that the festival would be renamed Mississippi Pride. However, it seems that the 2012 festival never came together.
