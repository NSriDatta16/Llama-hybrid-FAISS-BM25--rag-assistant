Maurice Bucaille (; 19 July 1920 – 17 February 1998) was a French doctor and a specialist in the field of gastroenterology who was appointed as the family physician of Faisal of Saudi Arabia in 1973. His patients included the members of the family of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.

Bucaille is primarily known for his book The Bible, The Qur'an and Science that he wrote following his study of the mummy of the Egyptian pharaoh Ramesses II. The book contained multiple references to the Quran, relating science and Quran in which Bucaille concluded that the Quran is a divine revelation and that it was not written by any man;. 
The book gave rise to a movement called Bucailleism, which tries to relate modern science with religion, especially Islam. Since the publishing of The Bible, the Quran and Science, Bucaillists have promoted the idea that the Quran is of divine origin, arguing that it contains scientifically and historically correct facts. According to The Wall Street Journal, Bucailleism is "in some ways the Muslim counterpart to Christian creationism" and although "while creationism rejects much of modern science, Bucailleism embraces it."
