SuperFerry (founded as Aboitiz Shipping Company; later Aboitiz SuperFerry) was one of the largest ferry companies in the Philippines before it was purchased by Negros Navigation, which simultaneously was purchased by the Chinese government through its private equity fund the China-Asean Investment Cooperation Fund, and became 2GO Travel, part of the 2GO Group.

The shipping company was known in the 1990s as William, Gothong & Aboitiz (WG&A). Aboitiz bought out the William Lines and Gothong Lines Group . The Gothong Group restarted its own shipping company called Carlos A. Gothong Lines (CAGLI), while the William Group opted to concentrate on its logistics, warehousing, and courier business, called Fast Logistics. SuperFerry and its sister companies SuperCat and Cebu Ferries are owned and operated by the former Negros Navigation when Negros Navigation bought all of Aboitiz Transport System, was sold to China-Asean Investment Cooperation Fund, and relaunched as 2GO Travel in 2012.

 SuperFerry 3 - Lost due to fire incident; in 2000, while the vessel was undergoing ship repairs in Keppel Cebu Shipyard, hot works on certain parts of the ship started a fire and caused evasive damages, effectively gutting the whole vessel.

 SuperFerry 7 - Former Naminoue Maru of A" Line shipping in Japan, and built in 1980, she was  sold to William Lines in 1994 and renamed the Mabuhay 2; later becoming  a part of the WG&A fleet as part of the  William, Gothong, and Aboitiz Shipping lines merger and was renamed SuperFerry 7. She was eventually lost to an extensive fire incident in 1997, wherein the whole vessel was gutted due to a presumed electrical fire while docked at Pier 4; same incident that would happen to its sister ship SuperFerry  3 later in 2000, but this time, was caused by hot works around the ship. She only spent 3 years sailing under the Philippine flag after the acquisition from Japan.

It was known to be a problematic ship, with several engine problems causing delays and stranding of passengers. In 2009, due to a presumed rough sea conditions and shifting of cargo containers below decks, it capsized off the southwest coast of Zamboanga Peninsula while en route from General Santos to Iloilo and sank almost 5 hours after the first distress call sent by the captain.

The ferry later sank half-submerged, further hampering rescue and retrieval operation of survivors and missing persons.

The disaster was  featured in various international news and media due to its magnitude and terrorism nature.
