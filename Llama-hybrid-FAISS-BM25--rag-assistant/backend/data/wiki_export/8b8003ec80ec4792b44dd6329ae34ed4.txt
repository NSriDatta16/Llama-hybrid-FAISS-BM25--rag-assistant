Greatest Hits is a greatest hits album by American hip hop group N.W.A, released on July 2, 1996, via Priority Records. Composed of nineteen tracks, the compilation contains several poplular singles and songs from the group's 1988 debut album Straight Outta Compton, 1990 extended play 100 Miles and Runnin' and their second and final studio album 1991 Niggaz4Life. It includes "Gangsta Gangsta", "Fuck tha Police", previously unavailable remix of "Straight Outta Compton", "Alwayz into Somethin'", remixed "Express Yourself", and "100 Miles and Runnin'", as well as inserts from live concerts. Production was handled by Dr. Dre and DJ Yella with Eazy-E serving as executive producer.

The album made it to number 48 on the Billboard 200 and number 20 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums in the United States. It also peaked at number 43 in New Zealand and number 56 on the UK Albums Chart. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on February 14, 2002.

In 2003, Priority Records re-released the album with two bonus tracks — "Chin Check", which was recorded for Next Friday (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) with one-time member Snoop Dogg, and "Hello", which was recorded for Ice Cube's sixth solo studio album War & Peace Vol. 2 (The Peace Disc) — performed by the reunited N.W.A.

After the success of the 2015 film Straight Outta Compton, the album came back to music charts, re-entering UK Albums Chart at number 49, and reaching number 9 in Australia.
