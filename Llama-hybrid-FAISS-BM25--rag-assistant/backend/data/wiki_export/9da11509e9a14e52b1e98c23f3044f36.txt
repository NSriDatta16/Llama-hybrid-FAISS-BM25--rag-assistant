Delta City is a brand of shopping center, with malls in Belgrade, Serbia and Podgorica, Montenegro.

Delta City Belgrade

Delta City Belgrade construction began on 22 March 2006. Designed by Israeli architects MYS, the project cost €74 million. It then opened on 1 November 2007.

Delta City Belgrade is located in New Belgrade's Blok 67. With floor area of 87,000 m2, it is the first shopping mall of its size in Serbia. Its total gross leasable area is 30,000 m2. Some of the stores in the mall are H&M, Zara, Calvin Klein Underwear, Adidas, Sport Vision, Fashion & Friends, N fashion, Bershka, Sephora, CT shop, Pull and Bear, Tom Tailor, Massimo Dutti, Stradivarius, Tezenis, Geox, Office Shoes, and others.

The mall also includes 15 restaurants as well as three restaurant chains: Kentucky Fried Chicken, McDonald's and Monument.

Austrian Cineplexx operates multiplex cinema with eight screens. There is also cafés, fast food courts, children's playgrounds, and 130 retail units. The largest tenant is Super Maxi supermarket. In total, there are over 1,200 parking places on five decks above the ground, and one underground.

The mall is located on the same block as Belville. Delta City can serve 200,000 people within a 10-minute walk, and 600,000 within a ten-minute drive.

Delta City Podgorica

Delta City Podgorica is the first and the largest shopping mall in Podgorica. It was built at a cost of €60 million, and was opened on October 1, 2008.

The mall is built in the new part of Podgorica, on the junction of roads towards Cetinje and Nikšić. It has a total floor area of 48,000 m2, with gross leasable area of 24,000 m2.

The prominent stores are similar to that of Belgrade mall: Nike, Zara, Mexx, Marks & Spencer, Tommy Hilfiger, Mango, Esprit, Oysho, Bershka, Pull and Bear, Stradivarius, Tally Weijl, Geox, Nine West, Guess, NewYorker, Office Shoes, and more.

What Podgorica mall is lacking is international food chains, so there is no Kentucky Fried Chicken or McDonald's, but there is a Costa Coffee outlet. The mall also features some local brands of fast food restaurants.

Mall also features a Cineplexx 6 screen multiplex cinema, and largest supermarket in Montenegro, Super Maxi. A large garage that spans the length of the mall at its back, and open parking in front make up for some 1,000 parking spaces.

Delta City Podgorica is the first large shopping mall in Montenegro, and it probably will not face competition from mall of similar size in Podgorica soon, with the possible exception of Mall of Montenegro.
