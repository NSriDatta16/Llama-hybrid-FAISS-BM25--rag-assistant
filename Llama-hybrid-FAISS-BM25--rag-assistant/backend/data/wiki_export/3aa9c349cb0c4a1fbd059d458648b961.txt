Ini Kopuria (died June 1945) was a police officer from Maravovo, Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands who founded the Melanesian Brotherhood in 1925. He and the Bishop of Melanesia, the Right Reverend John Manwaring Steward, realised Ini's dream by forming a band of brothers (known in the Mota language as 'Ira Reta Tasiu') to take the Gospel of Jesus to the non-Christian areas of Melanesia.

The Anglican Church of Melanesia and Church of England commemorate Kopuria on their calendars of saints.

Ini is remembered in the Church of England with a commemoration on 6 June.
