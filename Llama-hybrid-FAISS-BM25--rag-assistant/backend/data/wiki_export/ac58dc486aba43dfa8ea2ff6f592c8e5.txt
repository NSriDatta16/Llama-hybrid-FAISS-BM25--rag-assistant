DLR Band is the fifth full-length studio album by David Lee Roth, the former vocalist of Van Halen, and the first and only credited to the DLR Band. It was released in 1998 and remains the only installment on Roth's own Wawazat!! label.

Information
DLR Band was recorded and mixed in ten days, a technique Roth had not utilized since 1979's Van Halen II. John Lowery (aka John 5), Mike Hartman, and Terry Kilgore played guitar on the record. Lowery actually performed double duty for the record, performing bass guitar under the "B'ourbon Bob" pseudonym. Also on the album was a then virtually unknown drummer Ray Luzier, later a full member of Korn.

Two tracks from DLR Band, "King of the Hill" and "Indeedido", would later appear on Mike Hartman's solo release, Black Glue, as "Southern Romp" and "Stomp", respectively. Written by Hartman, both tracks would be remixed and made instrumental for Hartman's release.

The album's cover artwork features a picture of model Bettie Page taken by Bunny Yeager, who receives credit in the liner notes. This led to it being colloquially referred to as the Bettie Page album.

DLR Band debuted at #172 on the charts with 8,000 copies sold in the first week. Within a year the album had sold 65,000 copies.
