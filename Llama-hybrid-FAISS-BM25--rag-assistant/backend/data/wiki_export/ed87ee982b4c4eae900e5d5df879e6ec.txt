History
The Academy was founded in 1908 by the Sisters of Mercy of New Jersey and opened with 77 students in elementary school through college. A fire destroyed the main building in 1911, but the school reopened in the following year and has grown steadily. A college division that had been part of the school when it was established was relocated to Lakewood Township, New Jersey in 1924 and became Georgian Court University. In the 1980s and 1990s it was a boarding school that housed local, out of state and international students.

Campus
The campus is situated on a ridge of the Watchung Mountains, overlooking surrounding suburban towns and the skyline of New York City, which is  to the east.

The school, a sponsored work of the Sisters of Mercy, is a nonprofit organization governed by a board of trustees. Its alumnae association, composed of about 4,100 graduates, provides support for a number of school functions. The school's physical plant is owned by the Sisters of Mercy of New Jersey.
