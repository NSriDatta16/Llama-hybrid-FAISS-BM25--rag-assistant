History
The origins of Schramberg date back to the year 1293, when the locality was first described as "Schrammenberg" ("wounded hill" or "scarred hill”). From 1643 Schramberg was the centre of the Herrschaft Schramberg, belonging to Further Austria until 1805.  From 1805 Schramberg was part of the Kingdom of Württemberg.

Economy
As with many other black forest communities, industrialisation began in Schramberg in the 19th century. The first manufacturers produced stoneware, straw goods and enamel.

In 1861 the Junghans clock factory was founded in Schramberg. At the beginning of the 20th century Junghans became the biggest clock factory worldwide with 3000 employees. Many suppliers, such as spring producers, established their companies in the surroundings of Junghans. Although Junghans is now much smaller, it continues to produce innovative clocks and watches today.

In recent years, companies such as "Kern-Liebers", "Trumpf" and the PCB producer "Schweizer" employ many of Schramberg's inhabitants and commuters from nearby communities.

Transport
Schramberg was the terminus of the Schiltach-Schramberg railway, which was formerly an important railway line for freight traffic. The line existed in 1892–1990.

Schramberg has a Gymnasium, a Realschule, a special school, two elementary schools and three combinations of elementary school and Hauptschule.
