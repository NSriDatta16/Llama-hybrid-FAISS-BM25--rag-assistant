Marilyn Munster is a fictional character in the CBS sitcom The Munsters, originally played by Beverley Owen and later by Pat Priest. In the original series, she is the daughter of Lily Munster's sister, and is therefore the granddaughter of Grandpa Munster (Count Dracula) and the cousin of Eddie Munster. She was played by Hilary Van Dyke in the 1988 series The Munsters Today.

Description
Marilyn is Lily's niece, although her surname is Munster. She attends Westbury College in Mockingbird Heights, the city where the Munsters live.

Like the rest of her family, she believes that the Munsters' appearance and lifestyle are normal, although Marilyn is actually the only family member whose appearance does not shock or disturb people outside the family. She is considered attractive by outsiders, but by the aesthetic standards of her family she is distressingly unattractive. Marilyn laments that she keeps scaring away potential boyfriends, not realizing that the young men are frightened away by her family.
