Somabhai Gandalal Koli Patel (born 10 August 1940) is an Indian politician and a member of the 15th Lok Sabha of India. He represents the Surendranagar constituency of Gujarat and is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party. Patel was arrested during the Emergency in 1977–78.

Somabhai Patel got the MLA ticket for the first time from the Bharatiya Janata Party in 1985, at that time Patel was a big character. Patel had turned the Koli caste, which was considered the backbone of the Congress, towards the Bharatiya Janata Party, as well as other OBC castes towards the Bharatiya Janata Party, due to which the Congress's Kham theory was in vain.
