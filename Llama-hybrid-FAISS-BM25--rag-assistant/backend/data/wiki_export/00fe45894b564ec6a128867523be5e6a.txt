Godzilla's/Eatin' Dust (alternatively titled (Godzilla's) Eatin' Dust or simply Eatin' Dust) is the fifth studio album by American stoner rock band Fu Manchu, released on February 19, 1999, on the now defunct Man's Ruin label. The album combines what were originally two limited 10" releases: "Godzilla" (1997) and "Eatin' Dust" (1999).

Godzilla's/Eatin' Dust was the second album for new members Brant Bjork and Bob Balch, who replaced Ruben Romano and Eddie Glass in 1997. Josh Homme of Kyuss and Queens of the Stone Age played lead guitar under the alias of Mike Coopersmith, as Balch had yet to join the band. Homme also played percussion and produced the three-track 1996 "Godzilla" session.

Several versions of the album have been released in various formats. It was reissued on Elastic Records in 2004 with different track order and artwork. In 2010, the band's own label At The Dojo Records reissued the album again, with the same track order and slightly different artwork.

In 2019, the album was re-released with four previously unreleased tracks and was titled Godzilla's/Eatin' Dust +4. The added tracks, also from the original "Godzilla" sessions, are early versions of three songs that later appeared on 1997's The Action Is Go, and a cover of Thin Lizzy's "Jailbreak" (a different version than that released on the 1998 "Jailbreak" 7").

"Godzilla" is a Blue Öyster Cult cover.
