Naas is a Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) club in Naas, County Kildare, Ireland, winner of ten Kildare county senior football championships, ten senior hurling championships, four senior camogie championships and Kildare club of the year in 1981.

History
Naas played the Curragh on 15 February 1885 to become one of eight clubs which share the distinction of being the first to play in a Gaelic football match. The GAA  Naas Sunbursts and Naas Crom-A-Boo were listed as unaffiliated clubs in 1896 while nearby Thomastown was an affiliated club. Naas moved to Spooner's Field opposite the racecourse grandstand in 1913. Father Brennan park was opened in 1930. Naas GAA grounds are now situated on the Sallins Rd, the amenities include three new floodlight pitches, a cloths bank, one way traffic management system and a brand new clubhouse.

Hurling
Naas has won the Kildare senior hurling championship nine times. The first of these titles came in 1951 the team was captained by Big Noise Sheridan and Naas successfully defended the title the following year. The club then entered a barren spell and it was not until some 42 years later in 1994 that the  Naas men, captained by Richie Coyle, reclaimed the crown by defeating Coill Dubh. This was the beginning of a golden spell for the club, with further titles following in 1997, 2000 and 2001. The Kildare team that won the Christy Ring Cup in 2018 was captained by Naas’ Brian Byrne. After a seventeen year gap, Naas reclaimed the senior hurling championship in 2019, successfully defended their title in 2020 and completed their first three in a row in 2021.
