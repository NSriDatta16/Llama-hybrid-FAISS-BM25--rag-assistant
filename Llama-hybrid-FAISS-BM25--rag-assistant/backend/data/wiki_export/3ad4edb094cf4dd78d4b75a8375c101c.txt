The 22nd World Cup season began in November 1987 in Italy and concluded in March 1988 in Austria.  The overall champions were Pirmin Zurbriggen and Michela Figini, both of Switzerland. Zurbriggen won his third overall title; Figini her second.

Beginning this year, the limitation on the number of events that would count for overall and discipline championships, which had been present since the founding of the World Cup, was eliminated.  The intent was to eliminate ties for discipline titles, although the first tiebreaker (number of wins) was retained; additionally, this would permit skiers to accumulate more points toward the overall title from their strongest disciplines.

A break in the schedule in February was for the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.  The alpine events were held at the new Nakiska ski area.  As the Olympics was in the process of eliminating its prior ban on professionals being allowed to compete, Swedish star Ingemar Stenmark returned to the Olympics after having been banned in 1984 (although Stenmark still received his payments from sponsors at his Monaco address, not through the Swedish federation).  Accordingly, from this point forward, skiers were able to turn professional and still continue to compete in the World Cup, which caused the demise of the former professional skiing circuit within a decade.
