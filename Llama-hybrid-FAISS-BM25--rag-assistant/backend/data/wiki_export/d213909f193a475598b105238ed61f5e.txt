This list of birds of Arizona includes every wild bird species seen in Arizona, as recorded by the Arizona Bird Committee (ABC) through January 2023. An additional accidental species has been added from another source.

This list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the Check-list of North and Middle American Birds, 7th edition through the 63rd Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the Check-list, except that the common names of families are from the Clements taxonomy because the AOS list does not include them.

The following tags have been used to identify categories of occurrence:

 (n) – Nesting: Per the ABC, this denotes "[a] species that has hatched young at least once, however, this does not include hybrid offspring"
 (Int) – Introduced: Birds that have been introduced to North America by the actions of humans, either directly or indirectly
 (Ex) – Extirpated: Birds that have formerly bred in Arizona but no longer do; reintroduction attempts may have been made but the species remains unestablished
 (A) – Accidental: Birds that have been seen only a few times, or only once; the ABC requires a formal report for sightings of them to be included in the official record
 (H) – Hypothetical: Birds that have had a credible sighting reported, but have not been documented with physical evidence such as a specimen or photograph

The ABC list contains 570 species, including one "slash" entry for a record which could not be identified at the species level. Of them, 153 taxa are considered accidental, eight as introduced by humans, four as extirpated, and two as hypothetical. Nesting has been recorded for 309 taxa. The list also includes eight forms or groups of subspecies which have been recorded in the state, all requiring committee review. This list has been prepared with the Arizona Bird Committee (Jan. 2023).
