History
The station signed on the air on .  The original call sign was KVVQ.  Initially, it broadcast middle of the road music and talk programming. On February 19, 2001, then-owner Infinity Broadcasting changed the call letters to KRAK. That call sign was formerly used by a well-known 50,000 watt country music station in Sacramento, which is now KHTK 1140 AM. On July 31, 2008, CBS Radio announced plans to sell its mid-size and small market stations (including 910 KRAK) to focus more on major market clusters. However, such a sale was never consummated.

On November 15, 2011, KRAK 910 changed its format from adult standards, branded "Stardust 910", to all-sports, branded as "910 ESPN". The previous ESPN Radio Network affiliate in the region, KVFG, began stunting with Christmas music, then switched to a classic hits format.

In September 2012, KRAK began a transition to CBS Sports Radio with hourly updates. The station dropped ESPN and began 24-hour broadcasts of CBS Sports Radio on January 2, 2013.  KMPS carried Los Angeles Angels baseball games until 2019.

On February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom. The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on November 17. On December 11, 2017, the station took on the KMPS call sign.  Those call letters had been transferred from Seattle sister station KSWD. 

On May 6, 2019, Entercom sold KMPS and KVFG to El Dorado Broadcasters for $1 million.  The sale was completed on August 15.  Afterwards, KMPS went silent due to financial reasons.  Around August 2020, KMPS returned to the air with a simulcast of 103.1 KXVVâ€™s Regional Mexican format.
