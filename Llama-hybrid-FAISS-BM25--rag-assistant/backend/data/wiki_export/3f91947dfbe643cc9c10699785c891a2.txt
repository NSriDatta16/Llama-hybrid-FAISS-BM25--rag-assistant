Wilster () is a town in Steinburg district in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany.

History
Wilster was granted town rights under LÃ¼beck law in 1282, and thereby counts itself among Schleswig-Holstein's oldest towns. Wilster forms the centre of the Wilstermarsch, a major cattle raising area in Germany.

On 1 July 2005, the town administration and the Amt of Wilstermarsch merged into one authority.

In 2018, the transformers for the NordLink power cable were installed in Wilster.

Sightseeing
The Old Town Hall built in 1585 is among Schleswig-Holstein's finest preserved Renaissance buildings.

Moreover, the late Baroque St. Bartholomew's Church, built by Ernst Georg Sonnin between 1775 and 1781, and the New Town Hall (Doos'sche Palais) built in 1786 are also worth seeing.
