The community was named after the daughter of the first postmaster, A. D. Buzzard. Flora post office operated from 1890–1966. The Flora School, built in 1915, is on the National Register of Historic Places. Now known as the Flora School Education Center, the schoolhouse has been restored as a pioneer arts education center.
