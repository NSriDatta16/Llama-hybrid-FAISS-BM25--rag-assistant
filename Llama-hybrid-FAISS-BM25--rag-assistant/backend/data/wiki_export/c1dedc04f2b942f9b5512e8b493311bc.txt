The champion

The overall winner (1988 Champion) was Charles Tippet, driving for Saab Haymill, based in Farnham Common, UK. On his way, he scored four race wins and three lap records. His car was in red livery with yellow stripes and raced as No. 28. It is the only survivor of the participating vehicles and is preserved in Oxfordshire, England.

The racing livery included advertisements for Scania, Scantruck, Saab Haymill, Pirelli and Mobil. The driver's name and the names of the service crew were also displayed and remain on the preserved motor car. In addition, some minor bodywork damage can still be seen, acquired during racing. There was a particularly dramatic incident at Donington, on 3 July, in which No. 28 was repeatedly struck by John Llewellyn's car and was eventually forced to spin off.

The Amateur Champion in 1988 was David Field (6), driving the blue and yellow McNaughton Ross Sponsored Car. After a season long battle with Simon Butler (Kentish Saab), Field won the Championship by a single point obtained by virtue of "fastest lap" in the final race of the season, at Thruxton.

Other drivers

Following the series Lionel Abbott, along with his brother Ed, went on to establish the company Abbott Racing. The Essex-based family business specialises in modifications to, and racing preparation of, many late Saab models, in particular the turbocharged models from the 1980s onwards.
