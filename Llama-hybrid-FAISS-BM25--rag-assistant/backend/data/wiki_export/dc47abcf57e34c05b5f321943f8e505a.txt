Rhodes is a locational surname, with other spellings Rhoades, Rhoads, Roads, Roades, and Rodes, deriving from the Old English rod, meaning "a clearing in the woods", or from one of a number of locations from this word. Topographical features provided obvious and convenient means of identification in the small communities of the Middle Ages, giving rise to various surnames.
