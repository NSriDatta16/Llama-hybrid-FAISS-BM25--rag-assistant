"Our Truth" is the first single by Italian gothic metal band Lacuna Coil from the album Karmacode. The song was also featured on the soundtrack to Underworld: Evolution. It was a Top 30 Active Rock single on the Billboard Charts. The video was on "hot rotation" on MTV Italy and received significant airplay on American music channels such as MTV on T-Minus Rock and MTV2 on Headbangers Ball.

Lyrically, the song delves into denying and forgetting one's past by creating a new truth as time goes by.

The song is somewhat different in sound compared to the band's typical work as it features a more profound Asian influence. The song is based heavily on the Phrygian and Phrygian dominant modes, which are characteristic of Egyptian music and Arabic music. A shamisen, a Japanese string instrument, is featured in the opening and ending of the song and a faint sitar can be heard during the verses.

The song is featured as an on-disc track in Rock Band Unplugged, Rock Band 2, Guitar Hero World Tour and Rock Revolution. In all but the latter, it is a master recording (a cover version was provided for its inclusion in Rock Revolution).
