Known  for its "learn by doing" philosophy, the college's motto is: "Learn by Doing: Making Imagination Real". Cal Poly has one of the "most recognized engineering programs in the country" and, with nearly 6,000 students (as of 2019), it is also the largest engineering college in Southern California, the second largest college of engineering in the California State University system, and the seventeenth largest engineering college in the United States.  In the 2022 U.S. News & World Report "America's Best Colleges" edition, the College of Engineering is ranked 10th out of 210 public and private undergraduate engineering schools in the U.S. where doctorates are not offered.

The College of Engineering at Cal Poly Pomona is among the most selective engineering colleges in the nation. For fall 2018, the college admitted 45.3 percent of its total freshmen applicants who held an average unweighted GPA of 3.74 (out of 4.00) and SATs of 1249 (out of 1600).

History

Engineering classes at the Kellogg Campus in Pomona, California of the California Polytechnic began in academic year 1957-58. At the time, the Engineering Center (the current two-story portion of Building 9) had not been finalized and it took two more years, until 1959, to complete. The first class of the College of Engineering graduated in 1960 with 11 graduates in the disciplines of Aeronautical Engineering, Electronic Engineering, Industrial Engineering and Mechanical Engineering.

It is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, Inc. (formerly the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology) for its baccalaureate programs in aerospace engineering, civil engineering, chemical and materials engineering, electrical and computer engineering, industrial engineering, manufacturing engineering, and mechanical engineering. It is also accredited by the Technology Accreditation Commission of ABET for its baccalaureate programs in construction engineering technology, and electromechanical engineering technology. The baccalaureate program in agricultural engineering is also accredited by ABET, yet this program is housed by the College of Agriculture. The Department of Chemical & Materials Engineering was formed in 1972 and is accredited by the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) in addition to ABET.
