Get Rich or Die Tryin is the debut studio album by American rapper 50 Cent. It was released on February 6, 2003, by Interscope Records, Eminem's Shady Records, Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment, and 50 Cent's G-Unit Records. After signing with Eminem, 50 Cent also worked heavily with Dr. Dre acting as the album's executive producers, who worked to combine the gangsta rap and R&B combo prevalent in New York hip hop. Additional production is provided by Mike Elizondo, Sha Money XL (who also executive produced the album), Mr. Porter, Rockwilder, Dirty Swift, Megahertz, and more.

The album also contains guest appearances from Eminem, Young Buck, and Nate Dogg, as well as features from G-Unit co-members Lloyd Banks and Tony Yayo. Prior to the album, 50 Cent released several mixtapes alongside the Trackmasters on an unreleased album widely believed to be his debut in 2000. However, after suffering legal troubles and being blackballed from the music industry, 50 Cent found difficulty in securing another major-label recording contract, until he signed with Eminem's Shady Records in 2002.

Released a week in advance to combat bootlegging and Internet leakage, Get Rich or Die Tryin debuted and peaked at number one on the Billboard 200, selling over 872,000 copies in its first week of sales. The album's singles also saw worldwide success, with both "In da Club" and "21 Questions" reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100, while "P.I.M.P." became a number one hit in several countries. The album was ranked number one on the Billboard Year-End 2003 and received generally positive reviews from music critics.

Get Rich or Die Tryin was ranked by several publications as one of the best albums of the 2000s. In 2020, it was certified 9× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It was the best-selling album of 2003 in the US, and was nominated for Best Rap Album at the 46th Grammy Awards. It won Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Album at 2003 American Music Awards and Top Billboard 200 Album at the 2003 Billboard Music Awards. In 2020, Rolling Stone ranked the album number 280 on their updated 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list.

Background
Prior to the release of his first studio album, titled Power of the Dollar, 50 Cent was shot nine times in Queens, New York, on May 24, 2000. He survived but was dropped from his label, Columbia Records, who canceled the album's release. Seeking to avoid another encounter with his shooter, 50 Cent traveled out to Westbury, Long Island at the invitation of producer Sha Money XL and began recording mixtapes there. During this period, 50 Cent also recorded several songs that would ultimately appear on Get Rich or Die Tryin; he recalls that, when he completed a song that he was especially impressed by, he would decline to release the song and instead save it for his eventual studio debut.

In 2002, Eminem listened to a copy of 50 Cent's Guess Who's Back? mixtape album through Jackson's attorney, who was working with Eminem's manager Paul Rosenberg. After being impressed with the mixtape, Eminem invited 50 Cent to Los Angeles where he was introduced to producer Dr. Dre. 50 Cent signed a one-million-dollar record deal with Eminem and Dr. Dre; 50 Cent then released his next mixtape, No Mercy, No Fear. It featured his own 8 Mile single, "Wanksta" (in addition to appearances on three other tracks from the album), which was later put on Get Rich or Die Tryin. "Wanksta" began to attract attention from radio DJs throughout the United States, building hype for 50 Cent's forthcoming album.

Both Eminem and Dr. Dre had started producing tracks on his debut album with additional help from producers Mike Elizondo, Sha Money XL, and others. 50 Cent's second single, "In da Club", was the first of seven tracks he recorded in five days with Dr. Dre. Eminem was featured on two songs, "Patiently Waiting" and "Don't Push Me". His songs also featured rappers within G-Unit such as Lloyd Banks ("Don't Push Me"), Tony Yayo ("Like My Style"), or Young Buck ("Blood Hound"). "Back Down" was an instrumental originally composed by Dr. Dre. It was originally intended to be used on Rakim's debut Aftermath album, Oh My God, but due to creative differences was not released. Early pressings of Get Rich or Die Tryin included a limited edition bonus DVD.

The album title originates as a tattoo on Sha Money XL's arm. The album artwork of Get Rich or Die Tryin was designed by Julian Alexander and Sacha Waldman. Featuring a shirtless 50 Cent standing behind a broken glass pane, it has been described as "among the most recognizable [album covers] in rap history".

Music and lyrics
Get Rich or Die Tryin is a gangsta rap album. 50 Cent has stated that his goal was to write lyrics that were evocative enough to capture listeners' imaginations, while also being "vague enough not to daunt them". Despite this, he does venture into more explicit detail on some tracks, like "Many Men" and the Ja Rule diss "Back Down". On the whole, the writing on the album has been described as "smooth[ing] out" the feel of his mixtapes into a more generally accessible format; tracks such as "In da Club" show 50 Cent particularly aiming to depict widely relatable experiences. 50 Cent has stated that he limited the amount of vulnerability he would display on the album; on tracks like "Many Men", he aimed to balance the vulnerability of the lyrical content with aggressive deliveries and production.

The single "21 Questions" was initially added to the album's tracklist against Dr. Dre's wishes. According to 50 Cent, "Dre was, like, 'How you goin' to be gangsta this and that and then put this sappy love song on?'" 50 Cent responded saying, "I'm two people. I've always had to be two people since I was a kid, to get by. To me that's not diversity, it's necessity." "21 Questions" has also been noted as, along with "Many Men", one of the few slow-tempo tracks on the album.

Singles and promotion
The album's lead single, "In da Club", was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), becoming 50 Cent's first song to top the Billboard Hot 100 for nine weeks and remained on the charts for twenty-two weeks."50 Cent – In da Club – Music Charts". aCharts.us.

Critical reception

Get Rich or Die Tryin received favorable reviews from contemporary music critics. At Metacritic, it holds an aggregate score of 73 out of 100, based on 19 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews".

In his review for USA Today, Steve Jones believed that the album is worthy of the hype 50 Cent had attracted because of how he "delivers, in vivid detail, stories of the violent life he led as a crack dealer and speaks with the swagger of one who has been shot nine times and lived to tell about it." AllMusic's Jason Birchmeier described it as "impressive" and "incredibly calculated", and identified it as "ushering in 50 as one of the truly eminent rappers of his era". Rolling Stone magazine's Christian Hoard praised the album's production and 50 Cent's "thug persona" and rapping ability. Brett Berliner of Stylus Magazine felt that he is versatile as a rapper and wrote that, "while not even close to perfection, [the album] is one of the freshest to come out in years." It is one of only 19 rap albums to receive a perfect rating from XXL magazine. Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times wrote that 50 Cent is "an appealing, mischievous character" whose talent for threatening raps aimed toward rivals is also limiting thematically.

Robert Christgau was less enthusiastic in his consumer guide for The Village Voice and gave it a two-star honorable mention, indicating a "likable effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well enjoy." He cited "What Up Gangsta" and "Patiently Waiting" as highlights and said that 50 Cent "gets no cuter as his character unfolds" on the album.

Legacy
Get Rich or Die Tryin is credited with restoring gangsta rap to prominence in an era when prevailing trends favored "slick, flashy ladies-man rappers" and radio-friendly R&B collaborations. Denaun Porter states that the album "shifted everybody's view of music" and led to a wave of stylistic imitators. 50 Cent's swaggering, unrepentant persona on Get Rich Or Die Tryin has led him to be described as "rap's most charming antihero since Tupac".

In a 2013 retrospective, Billboard states that the album "rewrote the hip-hop rulebook". Neil Kulkarni of Crack states that Get Rich or Die Tryin combined "Southern-style textures with gritty East Coast lyrical content" in a way that many succeeding artists would strive to replicate, and argues that the album's success paved the way for future gangsta rap artists including Jeezy, Rick Ross, and the Game. 50 Cent has also been credited with inspiring later rappers to write more overtly about their "personal turmoil".

Sha Money XL credits the album's success to the memorability of 50 Cent's background:
