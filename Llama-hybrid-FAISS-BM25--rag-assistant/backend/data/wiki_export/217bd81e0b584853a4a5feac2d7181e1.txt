Move to France

During the 2011 Super Rugby season, Giteau signed with the French club Toulon, a move that would take effect after the 2011 Rugby World Cup. Despite not being selected for the Australian World Cup squad, he could not join Toulon until mid-November, as he was still under contract with the Australian Rugby Union through the World Cup.

Giteau played against the Springboks winning 24–20 at Suncorp Stadium, and against the All Blacks 27–19 at ANZ Stadium. Giteau was selected in the Wallabies 31-man squad for the 2015 Rugby World Cup.
