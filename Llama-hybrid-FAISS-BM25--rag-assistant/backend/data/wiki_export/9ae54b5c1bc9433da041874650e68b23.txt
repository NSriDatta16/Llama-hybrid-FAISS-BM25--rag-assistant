Wildlife

By the 21st century, number of migratory European rollers in Serbia was reduced to some 20 nesting couples, where only few were recorded in Central Serbia and none in the central Šumadija region. The species was widespread by the mid-20th century, but was protected by the state in 1993. In order to try to repopulate the species, ornithologists placed bird houses on top of the trees in Beljina in 2015, but the attempt was unsuccessful. In 2017 the bird houses was moved to the village's utility poles, and rollers began nesting again, starting in 2018, in slowly growing numbers each year.
