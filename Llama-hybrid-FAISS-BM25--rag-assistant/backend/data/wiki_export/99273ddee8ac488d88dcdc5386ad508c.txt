The song chronicles the adventure of the narrator in the fictional location of Rhine County, Georgia where a  watermelon festival is taking place. The featured item at this festival is red wine made from the watermelons grown in the area. The mayor urges people to abide by the law and asks them not to drive if they have been drinking; instead, they should do a dance called "The Watermelon Crawl."
