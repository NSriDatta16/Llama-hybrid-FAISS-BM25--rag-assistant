History 

LS Cable & System was founded as Korea Cable Industry in May 1962 and became Goldstar Cable in 1969.

It was then known as LG (Lucky Goldstar) Cable until it separated from the LG Group in November 2003 to lead an independent brand power. It was established as its own cable company, LS Cable, in March 2005 as a part of the newly formed LS Group.

On June 11, 2008, LS Cable announced the purchase of Atlanta-based magnet wire and communication cable maker Superior Essex.  The transaction, valued at roughly $900 million, extends LS Cable's reach into North American and European markets.

In March 2011 LS Cable was renamed and thus became LS Cable & System.
