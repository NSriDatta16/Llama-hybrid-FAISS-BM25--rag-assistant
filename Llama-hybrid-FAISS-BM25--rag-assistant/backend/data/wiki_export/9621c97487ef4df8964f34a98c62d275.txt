New And Improved is a compilation album by Mice that was released on All About Eve's label JamTart in 2001. It contains all of Mice's one and only album ... Because I Can, as well as three of the B-sides (including "Martian Man", a cover of the Lynsey de Paul song) and five Mice and/or Julianne Regan demos from the same period (1995-1997). It was released by Julianne Regan post the All About Eve 1999 reformation, due to the renewed interest in Mice that this had caused.
