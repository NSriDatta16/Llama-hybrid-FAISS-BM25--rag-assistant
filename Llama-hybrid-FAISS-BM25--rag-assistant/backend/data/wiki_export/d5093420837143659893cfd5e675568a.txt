Biography
Benjamin Golder was born in Alliance, New Jersey (near Vineland, New Jersey). He moved with his parents to Philadelphia in 1893. He graduated from the law department of the University of Pennsylvania at Philadelphia in 1913.

He enlisted in the Naval Aviation Service during World War I and was honorably discharged as ensign after the Armistice. He became a member of the Pennsylvania State House of Representatives, serving from 1916 to 1924.

He was elected in 1924 as a Republican to the 69th Congress, and represented Pennsylvania's Fourth District. He was an unsuccessful candidate for renomination in 1932 and for election in 1940. He resumed the practice of law in Philadelphia until the Second World War. He was commissioned a captain in the United States Army on February 5, 1943, and served until discharged as a lieutenant colonel on July 1, 1945.

In 1930, he married Peggy Mastbaum, daughter of Etta Wedell Mastbaum and Jules E. Mastbaum. Golder was the younger brother of historian Frank A. Golder (1877–1929), an academic expert on the history of Imperial Russia.

He died at his home in Philadelphia on December 30, 1946, following a brief illness, and was buried at that city's Mount Sinai Cemetery.
