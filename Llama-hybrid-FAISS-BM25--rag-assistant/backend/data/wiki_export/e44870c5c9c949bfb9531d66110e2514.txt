Kinnerly Peak () is located in the Livingston Range, Glacier National Park in the U.S. state of Montana. It is approximately  north of Kintla Peak, the highest peak in the Livingston Range, and  south of the Canada–United States border. Both peaks are in the remote northwest corner of the park. Kinnerly Peak is the eighth tallest peak in Glacier National Park.

Kinnerly Peak is notable for its huge north face, which rises steeply from Upper Kintla Lake. From the lake to the summit is an elevation gain of  in approximately a horizontal .

The first recorded ascent of Kinnerly Peak was made by a Sierra Club party led by the noted mountaineer Norman Clyde, in 1937. The standard climbing route ascends the northwest face, starting from the south shore of Upper Kintla Lake. It involves a large amount of elevation gain, mostly by scrambling, but with some exposed and mildly technical sections (Class 4 or easy Class 5). Other routes exist on the southeast and southwest faces.

Geology

Like other mountains in Glacier National Park, Kinnerly is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was initially uplifted beginning 170 million years ago when the Lewis Overthrust fault pushed an enormous slab of precambrian rocks  thick,  wide and  long over younger rock of the cretaceous period.
