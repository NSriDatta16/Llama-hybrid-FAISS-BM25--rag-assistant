His album Multiplication Mountain was released on January 15, 2009, and in 2012 Palmer released a DVD of musical picture books. In 2013 Palmer released the album Count, Add, Subtract! Fun with Math, Music, and Movement aimed at teaching mathematical concepts to pre-schoolers, which was reviewed as a "fun way to teach early math concepts".

Smithsonian Folkways, the nonprofit record label of the Smithsonian Institution, published over 30 of Palmers' albums. His 2016 release received the Parents' Choice Gold Award, and the American Library Association denoted his recordings as "Best of the Best for Children".
