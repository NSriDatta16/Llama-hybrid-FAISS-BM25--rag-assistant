Ancil Elcock (born 17 March 1969) is a Trinidadian former professional footballer. He played for Major League Soccer team Columbus Crew between 1997 and 2001 (130 games and 7 goals), and for Tobago United. He got 69 caps for the Trinidad and Tobago national team between 1994 and 2004. Ancil Elcock became infamous for fracturing Mexican forward Cuauhtémoc Blanco in a World Cup qualification match.

Elcock is the older cousin of Stern John, whom he recruited to the Columbus Crew while tenured there.

Blanco's Injury
On 8 October 2000, Trinidad and Tobago contested a World Cup qualification match against Mexico. The match was played in Mexico City at the Estadio Azteca and the referee was Carlos Batres Gonzalez. In the 72nd minute, Elcock slide-tackled Cuauhtémoc Blanco hitting him on the knee as he received the ball in the penalty area. Referee Gonzalez determined the tackle to be of excessive force and called for a penalty and ejected Elcock by showing him a direct red card, even though Elcock had previously received a yellow in the game. The penalty was taken and scored by Víctor Ruiz resulting in the final score of the game 7–0 in favor of Mexico.
