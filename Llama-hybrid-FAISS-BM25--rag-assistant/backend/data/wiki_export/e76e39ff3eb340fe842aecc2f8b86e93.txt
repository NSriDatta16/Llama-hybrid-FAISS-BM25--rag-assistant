Tin Cans and Car Tires is an album by moe. It was released in 1998. It marked the recorded debut of drummer Vinnie Amico, who had taken over the position from Chris Mazur in 1996. Most of the material on the album had been included in the band's live sets for a number of years before being recorded for the album, including "Queen of the Rodeo", which first appeared in 1995 as part of the "rock opera" Timmy.

Critical reception
The Washington Post thought that "there are still some examples of self-indulgence—opaque lyrics, overly fussy passages, odd time signatures for no good reason—but the album is dominated by eight songs where the conversational vocals, catchy melodies and Americana roots offer an accessible entry to the band's improvisatory dexterity."
