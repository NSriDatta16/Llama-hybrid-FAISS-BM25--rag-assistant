History 
Originally purchased by the federal government to build a battery to protect the port of Philadelphia, the land became a cemetery by 1863 for Confederate prisoners of war who died while in captivity at Fort Delaware. One hundred and thirty five Union soldiers who died while serving as guards at the prison camp are also buried here. The death toll among prisoners of war and the guards was high, especially in the latter part of 1863 and throughout 1864. By July 1863, there were 12,595 prisoners on the island at nearby Fort Delaware which was only about  in size.  Disease was rampant and nearly 2,700 prisoners died from malnutrition or neglect.  Confederate prisoners interred at the cemetery totaled 2,436 and all are in a common grave as can still be seen as a huge pit in the north western corner of the site near the monument.

It was officially made a National Cemetery on October 3, 1875, by request of Virginia Governor James L. Kemper, who criticized the poor maintenance of the Confederate grave sites.

Finn's Point National Cemetery is north west of Supawna Meadows National Wildlife Refuge near Fort Mott State Park. The cemetery was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

Serial killer Andrew Cunanan committed one of his murders at the cemetery on May 9, 1997, killing cemetery caretaker William Reese and stealing his truck.
