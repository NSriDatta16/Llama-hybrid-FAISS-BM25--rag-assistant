The American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (AAPI) is a professional association for Indian American physicians.

The association is based in Chicago and was founded in 1982. As of 2019, it claims a membership of 80,000 physicians.

History

Founding 
From the 1960s to the 1970s, the United States saw a large influx of medical students and physicians from India who were looking to continue their studies, intern or practice. However, while trying to apply for residencies, promotions, medical licenses, etc., many experienced discrimination and difficulties despite being qualified for these positions. This led to the formation of regional Indian-origin physician organizations such as the Michigan Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (MAPI), which was established in 1976 to support Indian medical graduates in the area. Leaders in organizations across U.S., such as Dr. Navin Shah from Washington D.C., reached out to other organizations proposing that they all come under one national organization, and in 1982, the first national meeting was hosted by MAPI in Dearborn, Michigan. The new organization started out small, with there only being five organizations at the meeting. During the meeting, they elected people for various leadership positions and drafted a Constitution and Bylaws. AAPI's initial goals thus became to lobby Congress and confront the American Medical Association in order to receive fair treatment.

Doctors of Indian origin
As of 2019, there were about 938,980 active physicians in the US; Indian-origin physicians account for at least 8.5% of the total physician population.

It is noteworthy that India provides the largest number of International Medical Graduates to the US in absolute numbers. More generally, India has been an important source of medical doctors for foreign countries since the 1960s.

Dr. Ravi Kolli, a psychiatrist from Pittsburgh, PA is the organization's president.

Jagdish Tytler controversy
In June 2004, AAPI became involved in a controversy for its invitation to Indian Minister for NRI Affairs Jagdish Tytler to be honored at a dinner gala.

Various human rights and Sikh groups threatened to hold demonstrations at the venue and the invitation to Jagdish Tytler was withdrawn. Tytler resigned from the Indian government after being indicted by the official Nanavati Commission of inciting mobs for violence.

Events

American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin organised 15th Annual Global Health Summit as part of 5th Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav initiative at Avasa Hotel, Hyderabad, India, during January 2022.
