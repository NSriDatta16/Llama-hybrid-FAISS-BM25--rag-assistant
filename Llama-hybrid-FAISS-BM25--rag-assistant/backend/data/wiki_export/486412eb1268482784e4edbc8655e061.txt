Brief history
"Oh No, Not You Again" is one of the most well-known tracks from A Bigger Bang, the Stones' first new studio album since 1997's Bridges to Babylon. The song was used in media campaigns and tour promotions for the band. It was the first new song from A Bigger Bang played for a public audience in a surprise performance at the Juilliard School in New York City.

Throughout the 2005–2006 A Bigger Bang Tour, which has carried the Stones throughout North America and Europe, "Oh No, Not You Again" has been played continuously and received generally well by fans and critics alike, although critics have noted the similarities in structure to previous Rolling Stones efforts from the early 1970s.

The song got significant rock radio airplay in the US, reaching #34 on Billboards Mainstream Rock Tracks in December 2005.

Charlie Watts jokingly said that the song's title should also be the name of the album, referring to the band's constant return to the studio.

Next single rumors
The tune was erroneously believed to be the next single released from A Bigger Bang in Spring 2006. This rumor was proved false when in April 2006 it was announced that the European summer single would be "Biggest Mistake".
