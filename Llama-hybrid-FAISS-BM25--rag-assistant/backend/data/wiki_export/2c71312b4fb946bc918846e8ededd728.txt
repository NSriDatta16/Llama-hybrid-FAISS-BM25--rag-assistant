The 1976–77 season was the 97th season of competitive football in England. This year The Football League revamped the tie-breaking criteria for teams level on points, replacing the traditional goal average tiebreaker with one based on goal difference to try to encourage more scoring.

National teams

UEFA Competitions

League Cup

Ron Saunders took Aston Villa to their second League Cup victory in three seasons as the Midlanders continued to re-establish themselves as a top club.

Football League

First Division
Liverpool retained their league championship trophy after a season long neck and neck battle with Ipswich Town and Manchester City that came down to the final game, City edging out Ipswich for second place.

Ipswich finished third, Aston Villa finished fourth and won their second League Cup in three seasons, while Newcastle United completed the top five. Manchester United finished sixth but beat Liverpool 2–1 to win the FA Cup final and prevent their opponents from becoming the first English team to win a treble of trophies in the same season.

Queens Park Rangers dropped to 14th place a year after almost winning the title, while 1975 champions Derby County finished 15th, with manager Dave Mackay being sacked before Christmas and replaced by 26-year-old coach Colin Murphy, one of the youngest managers ever to take charge of a Football League side.

Tottenham Hotspur and Stoke City's long spells in the First Division came to an end with relegation. Stoke sacked their manager Tony Waddington. On the last day of the season, with three teams hoping to avoid the last relegation place, Coventry City and Bristol City played out a controversial 2–2 draw. The kick-off had been delayed for fifteen minutes by Coventry chairman Jimmy Hill due to "crowd congestion". With ten minutes still to play, and the sides level, play virtually stopped when it was announced over the public address system that Sunderland had lost to Everton. Both clubs survived while Sunderland was relegated.

Second Division
Wolves sealed an instant return to the First Division as champions of the Second Division. They were joined by Chelsea, back in the First Division after two seasons away, and by Brian Clough's ambitious Nottingham Forest side. Bolton Wanderers and Blackpool stayed down by a single point.

Hereford United, Plymouth Argyle and Carlisle United were relegated to the Third Division. Hereford became the first club to finish bottom of the Second Division after winning the Third Division the previous season.

Third Division
Mansfield Town won the Third Division title to seal a second promotion in three seasons. Alan Mullery guided Brighton to promotion. The last promotion place was sealed by Crystal Palace, where Terry Venables was enjoying a dream start to his managerial career. Rotherham United stayed down on goal difference, while Wrexham missed out by a single point.

Sheffield Wednesday progressed to an eighth-place finish after almost slipping into the Fourth Division a year earlier, while Lincoln City finished ninth. Manager Graham Taylor was subject of interest by a number of First and Second Division clubs, but ended up leaving Sincil Bank to drop into the Fourth Division and take over at Watford, who had just been taken over by Elton John.

York City, Northampton Town and Reading fell into the Fourth Division along with Grimsby Town who entered administration.

Fourth Division
Cambridge United won the Fourth Division title under the management of Ron Atkinson, lifting them into the Third Division. Also promoted were Exeter City, Colchester United and Bradford City. Swansea City missed out on promotion by a single point.

A terrible season for Workington resulted in them having to apply for re-election to the Football League for the fourth season in succession, and this caused their fellow clubs to finally run out of patience and vote to end their membership of the League, a humiliation which saw them slip into the Northern Premier League. In their place were Southern League champions Wimbledon, who would make amazing progress over the next decade.

The British pop star Elton John took over Fourth Division side Watford and installed Graham Taylor as manager at the end of the season. Former Arsenal manager Bertie Mee came out of retirement to work at Watford as Taylor's assistant. John immediately asserted his ambition by promising to bring First Division football to Watford.
