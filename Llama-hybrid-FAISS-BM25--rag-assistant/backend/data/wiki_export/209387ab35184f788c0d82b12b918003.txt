Aluminium iodide  is a chemical compound containing aluminium and iodine.  Invariably, the name refers to a compound of the composition , formed by the reaction of aluminium and iodine or the action of  on  metal.  The hexahydrate is obtained from a reaction between metallic aluminum or aluminum hydroxide with hydrogen iodide or hydroiodic acid.  Like the related chloride and bromide,  is a strong Lewis acid and will absorb water from the atmosphere.  It is employed as a reagent for the scission of certain kinds of C-O and N-O bonds. It cleaves aryl ethers and deoxygenates epoxides.

Structure
Solid  is dimeric, consisting of , similar to that of . The structure of monomeric and dimeric forms have been characterized in the gas phase. The monomer, , is trigonal planar with a bond length of 2.448(6) Å, and the bridged dimer, , at 430 K is a similar to  and  with  bond lengths of 2.456(6) Å (terminal) and 2.670(8) Å (bridging). The dimer is described as floppy with an equilibrium geometry of D2h.

Aluminium(I) iodide

The name "aluminium iodide" is widely assumed to describe the triiodide or its dimer. In fact, a monoiodide also enjoys a role in the Al–I system, although the compound AlI is unstable at room temperature relative to the triiodide:
3AlI -> AlI3 + 2Al
An illustrative derivative of aluminium monoiodide is the cyclic adduct formed with triethylamine, .
