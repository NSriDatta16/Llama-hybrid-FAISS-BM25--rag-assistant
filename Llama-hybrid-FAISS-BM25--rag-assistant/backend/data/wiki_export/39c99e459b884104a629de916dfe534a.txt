Love's Berries (, ) is a 1926 Soviet comedy film by Ukrainian director Oleksandr Dovzhenko. The film was Dovzhenko's debut, and the screenplay was written in three days. It deals with a dandified barber's attempts to get rid of his "love berry" â€” his illegitimate offspring.

Plot
Hairdresser Jean Colbasiuc learns from his girlfriend about an unexpected materialization of their child. Not ready to be a father, the young man tries to get rid of the baby left in his care. After a few unsuccessful attempts to place the baby onto unsuspecting citizens, by this time Colbasiuc receives a notice from the People's Court, agrees to the registration of marriage and only then learns from Lisa that the child, who served as a catalyst for the incident, was borrowed by her from her Aunt.
