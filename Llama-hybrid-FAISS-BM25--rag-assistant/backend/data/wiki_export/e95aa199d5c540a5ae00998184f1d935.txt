Stallingborough railway station serves the village of Stallingborough in North East Lincolnshire, England. It was built by the Great Grimsby and Sheffield Junction Railway in 1848.

The station, and all trains serving it, are operated by East Midlands Railway. The manually operated level crossing gates seen in the photo and the wooden Great Central Railway signal box that operated them have both since been replaced by a modern brick structure and lifting barriers respectively - the new signal box is on northside of the line, and is one of a few little boxes to be built in recent years. The station building is a private house now, but there are shelters on both platforms.
