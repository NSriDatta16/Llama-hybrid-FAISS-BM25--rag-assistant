Career

Broadway 
Highly regarded for his stage work, which includes 10 Broadway credits, Fontana has performed in a vast number of roles during his career. He has won a Tony Award, two Drama Desk Awards, an Outer Critics Circle Award, and was nominated for a Drama League Award.

Fontana made his Broadway debut in the 2007 revival of Sunday in the Park with George. Three years later, he was awarded the 2010 Drama Desk Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play for his work in Brighton Beach Memoirs. The Washington Post wrote, "Fontana is a find as Stanley, immensely likable and thoroughly convincing in the character's struggle between his selfish impulses and his fiscal obligations to the family."

In 2011, Fontana portrayed Algernon Moncrieff in the revival of The Importance of Being Earnest. Fontana received rave reviews, with Entertainment Weekly writing, "Kudos especially to the ever-versatile Fontana-best known on Broadway as the angry older brother in Billy Elliot- as the "ostentatiously eligible" Algernon, who gets the bulk of Wilde's ridiculously clever bons mots. Fontana does have a spot-on British accent and an immense likability- more important in my book."

Fontana received his first Tony nomination with his portrayal of Prince Topher in the 2013 production of Rodgers + Hammerstein's Cinderella opposite Laura Osnes. Roma Torre on NY1 praised his performance, stating, "Santino Fontana is not your typical Prince Charming, but this wonderfully versatile actor is loaded with so many unique charms, he is instantly winning." Fontana followed up this performance with the Tony-nominated Act One opposite Tony Shalhoub in 2014. Shalhoub and Fontana were dynamic in their performance together, with USA Today writing, "Fontana has brought a vigorous, probing humanity to a number of characters, and he gives Moss the right mix of earnest intelligence and restless ambition."

Fontana starred as Michael Dorsey / Dorothy Michaels in the stage musical adaptation of the film Tootsie, which premiered in Chicago at the Cadillac Palace Theatre from September 11 to October 14, 2018. The musical opened on Broadway on April 23, 2019, and closed on January 5, 2020. Direction was by Scott Ellis with music and lyrics by David Yazbek and book by Robert Horn. Fontana won the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical, Drama Desk Award and an Outer Critics Circle Award for his work. The New York Times' Jesse Green wrote that "Mr. Fontana sings beautifully, in a novel tenor-falsetto blend, and nails every joke," that "The persistence of Michael even in Dorothy drag, and later vice versa, is charmingly handled [by Mr. Fontana], helping us get past both Michael's obtuseness and Dorothy's unlikeliness," and that "[Mr. Fontana's] comic timing is impeccable."

Other notable credits include Hello Dolly! (2018 revival) opposite Bernadette Peters, A View from the Bridge (2010), and Billy Elliot the Musical (2008).

Off-Broadway/regional theatre 
In 2006, Fontana starred as Hamlet in The Guthrie Theatre's performance of the Shakespearean classic before moving to New York City to star as Matt in the Off-Broadway revival of The Fantasticks. He was one of the youngest Hamlets in American theatre history.

In 2011 he starred in Roundabout Theatre Company's Off-Broadway production of Sons of the Prophet to high acclaim. Fontana won a Lucille Lortel, Obie, and Outer Critics Circle Award and was nominated for a Drama Desk and Drama League Award. Scott Brown of Vulture commended his performance, stating, "Santino Fontana...firmly establishes himself as an indispensable stage star. The role he plays here, Joseph Douayhii- a young man dealing with an older man's pain, spiritually, physically psychologically, and perhaps psychosomatically- couldn't be more different than his buoyant, impish Algernon Moncrieff, yet both parts display Fontana's impressive gifts: his flawless timing, his jeweler's eye for the emotional cruxes of every exchange, his comfort with discomfort. He's always a step ahead of us, emotionally, as a great performer should be...Sons of the Prophet belongs to Fontana."

Fontana has performed in many productions at New York City Center's Encores! His first performance with Encores! was his portrayal of Niko in Zorba. In 2016 he starred as Eliot Rosewater in God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater. Pop Culturalist wrote of his performance, "The undeniable star of this show is Santino Fontana. Fontana is a reliably wonderful actor, but his performance as the good-hearted troubled Eliot Rosewater is masterful– quite simply, this is the best I've ever seen him." That same year he starred as John Adams in Encores! production of 1776. BroadwayWorld praised his performance, stating, "Santino Fontana's smart and empathetic performance is always winning."

Film and TV 
Fontana is known for voicing Prince Hans in Frozen in 2013. He appeared in Sisters (2015) opposite Tina Fey and Amy Poehler and starred in Lost & Found in Cleveland (2023), currently in post-production. His independent film work includes the romantic comedy Off The Menu (2018), the psychological thriller Impossible Monsters (2019), Brenda & Billy and The Pothos Plant (2023), Stalking The Boogeyman (2023), and the comedy Papercop in 2018, for which he won the Best Actor Award at the Williamsburg International Independent Film Festival.

Fontana has appeared in many television productions to high acclaim. Fontana joined the cast of The CW romantic musical comedy-drama Crazy Ex-Girlfriend in 2015. On November 11, 2016, it was announced that Fontana was leaving the TV series after his one-year contract with The CW. The New Yorker stated that "Greg, played by the Broadway star Santino Fontana, is particularly appealing," with the AV Club adding "Fontana has solid timing (and great eyebrow waggling capabilities)" and "Santino Fontana, in particular, does excellent work.”

In 2016, Fontana starred opposite Jennifer Lopez in NBC's Shades of Blue. He played David Saperstein, a detective who is part of Wozniak's (Lopez) crew. The San Francisco Chronicle wrote, “In addition to Lopez, the best performances are turned in by Santino Fontana."

Fontana has had starring roles in The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel (2022) and Mozart in the Jungle (2014-2018), where he portrayed Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. He has also appeared in Fosse/Verdon, The Good Wife, Nurse Jackie, BrainDead, and Royal Pains.

When Fontana performed with the American Songbook Series at Lincoln Center, BroadwayWorld wrote, "Fortunately, thanks to artists like Fontana, America's rich musical past can be kept alive and well in the hearts of the young and old alike, and provide a source of inspiration for future generations to enjoy.”

In 2015, Fontana became the first guest artist to perform three times in the space of one year with the Tabernacle Choir on Temple Square, where he met the cast of Sesame Street.
