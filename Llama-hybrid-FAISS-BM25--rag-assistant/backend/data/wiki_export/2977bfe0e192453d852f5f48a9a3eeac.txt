Queens Reigns Supreme: Fat Cat, 50 Cent, and the Rise of the Hip Hop Hustler
Brown's first book, published in 2005, traced the connection between infamous drug dealers Lorenzo "Fat Cat" Nichols and  Kenneth "Supreme" McGriff, and rappers Irv Gotti, Ja Rule, and 50 Cent.

Based on extensive interviews and police wiretaps, Brown's investigation uncovered the connection between "hip hop hustlers" and actual street hustling.

The dangerous connections and unflattering details exposed by Brown led journalist Chuck Klosterman to remark: "If somebody doesn't get shot because of this book, I will be fucking amazed."

Brown's second book, published in 2007, looked at the complicated and often conflicting relationship between law enforcement and paid and unpaid informants.Snitch was subsequently banned from all US federal prisons.

The book was named to The Roots list of "smartest, strongest writing about race."

Brown's third book, published in 2009, involved Brown's moving to New Orleans to investigate the story of a murder-suicide committed by Zackery Bowen, an Iraq War-veteran.

Bowen's murder of his bartender girlfriend Adriane "Addie" Hall in October 2006 post-Hurricane Katrina became a national story amidst speculation of cannibalism and Bowen's dramatic suicide off the roof of the Omni Hotel in the French Quarter.

Although the case, known as the “Jeff Davis 8”, received nationwide attention in such outlets as The New York Times and CNN, Brown formulated a new theory of the case: that it was not the work of a serial killer. He backed up this theory by citing copious evidence from homicide files, witness interviews, and autopsy reports.Murder in the Bayou'' has been highly praised by John Berendt, Harold Schechter, and Janet Reitman.
