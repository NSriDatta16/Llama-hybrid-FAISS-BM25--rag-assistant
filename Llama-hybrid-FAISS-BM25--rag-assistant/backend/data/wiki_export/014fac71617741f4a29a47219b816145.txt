Section Eight Productions, or just Section Eight, was an American film production company founded in 2000 by film director Steven Soderbergh and actor/director George Clooney.

It produced the critical hits Far from Heaven, Insomnia, Syriana, A Scanner Darkly and Michael Clayton, as well as Clooney-directed films Confessions of a Dangerous Mind and Good Night, and Good Luck. In 2005, Syriana and Good Night, and Good Luck picked up eight Oscars nominations between them.

With Soderbergh citing a desire to focus on directing, and Clooney forming production company Smokehouse Pictures with Grant Heslov, the two decided to shut down Section Eight at the end of 2006.
