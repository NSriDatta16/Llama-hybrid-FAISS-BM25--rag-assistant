"Juliette & Jonathan" is a 1996 Swedish language pop song that Lotta Engberg sang when she competed in the Swedish Melodifestivalen 1996, and finished 3rd. The song was written by Monica Forsberg and Torgny Söderberg. Even Lena Philipsson has recorded this song, and she released it on her 2006 album "Lady Star". At first, it was thought that Lena Philipsson should sing this song at Melodifestivalen 1996. "Juliette & Jonathan" is a song whose text is about love, but has an anti-racist theme. The song text is about Juliette and Jonathan, two people from different backgrounds who fall in love with each other. According to the song text, love doesn't know any borders or color of skin.

The single peaked at #51 at the Swedish singles chart.

At Svensktoppen, the song stayed for 5 weeks, 20 April-18 May 1996, with a 3rd place as best result there.
