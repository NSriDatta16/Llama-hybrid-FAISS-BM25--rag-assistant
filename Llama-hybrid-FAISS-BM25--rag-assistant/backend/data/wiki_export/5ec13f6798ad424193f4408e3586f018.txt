The New Orleans mayoral election of 1969-1970 resulted in the election of Moon Landrieu as mayor of New Orleans.  This election also saw an unexpectedly strong showing for a Republican candidate; the party had previously had negligible support in the city.

Incumbent mayor Victor H. Schiro was term-limited after winning elections in 1961 and 1965.
