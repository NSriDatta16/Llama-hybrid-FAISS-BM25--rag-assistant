Black Hole/Blank Canvas is the eleventh full-length studio album by the Norwegian band Motorpsycho. It is the first after long-time drummer Håkon Gebhardt left the band in spring 2005. The other two members, Hans Magnus Ryan and Bent Sæther decided to carry on as a duo. They recorded their new album in The Void studio in Eindhoven together with producer/engineer and long-time live sound technician Pieter Kloos and produced their third double album. It was released on March 17, 2006, (March 20 in Norway) and was followed by a European tour in spring. The band was joined by drummer Jacco van Rooij and vibraphonist Øyvind Brandtsegg, who also played on the 1994 album Timothy's Monster.

The second song from the album, "In our Tree", was premiered as a short clip on Norwegian TV station NRK during the program Lydverket, and later in full on the radio station P3.
