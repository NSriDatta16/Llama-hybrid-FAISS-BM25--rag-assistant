is a legal profession in Japan which files government licenses and permits, drafts documents, and provides legal advice around such interactions. They are also known as Immigration Lawyers, Gyosei-shoshi Lawyers or Certified Administrative Procedures Legal Specialists, although they are not allowed by the law to represent their clients in the judicial procedures in and outside of the court of law.

Occupation
Administrative Scriveners prepare legal documents such as filings with the national and local government, which do not include the court of law. Administrative Scrivener are found in a variety of roles. Many specialize in immigration matters, wills, inheritances, motor vehicle registrations, Development approvals, articles of incorporation, company minutes, etc. Under the Administrative Scrivener Law, the types of documents that such professionals are authorised to prepare extends into the thousands, involving the aforementioned as well as attachments to administrative applications and contractual documents between corporate and private persons. The exception is when certain laws expressly designate a person in another capacity to prepare a legal document.

Administrative Scriveners may also give advice on the preparation of such documents, one of the few exceptions to the attorney at law's monopoly on giving "legal advice" for compensation.

The work of an Administrative Scrivener bears certain minor overlaps with that of Attorney at Law or Scrivener in American or Common Law jurisdictions, excluding important elements such as the authority to represent their clients in the legal disputes. Beside attorneys-at-law, prosecutors, justices and judicial scriveners, they form an important part of the legal landscape in Japan.

South Korea has a similar occupation known as Haeng-jeong-sa (Hangul: 행정사, Hanja: 行政士).

Purpose
The 1997 amendment to the Administrative Scrivener Law has clarified the purpose of the qualification and monopoly.

1. This law determines the system of Administrative Scriveners. Such will allow greater precision in the work, (the scrivener) facilitates the smooth execution of administrative procedures. In all, the aim is to provide convenience to the citizenry.

Any person who has worked in an "administrative position" at a government agency for 20 years is also entitled to the qualification. Otherwise, one must take the national examinations held every year as mentioned below.
