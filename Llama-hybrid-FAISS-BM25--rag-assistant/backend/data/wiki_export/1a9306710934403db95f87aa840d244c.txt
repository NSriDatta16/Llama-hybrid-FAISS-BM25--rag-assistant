It was also the venue for the inaugural edition of the France Women's Sevens in the World Rugby Women's Sevens Series in 2016, and it hosted the 2017 Clermont-Ferrand Sevens, the third leg of the 2017 Rugby Europe Grand Prix series.

The stadium is able to hold 11,980 people and was built in 1995.

History
In the summer of 2023, the start of phase 1 of the work on the new Gabriel Montpied will start with a new configuration for the 2023–24 season without the Tribune Limagne. The stadium's capacity for the 2023–24 season is therefore approximately 10,700 seats.
