Alexander S. Wilson (December 1, 1907 – December 9, 1994) was a Canadian sprinter who competed in both the 1928 Summer Olympics and the 1932 Summer Olympics. He was born in Montreal and died in Mission, Texas, United States.

In 1928 he won a bronze medal with the Canadian team in the 4 × 400 metres relay event. In the 400 metre competition as well as in the 800 metre contest he was eliminated in the semi-finals. Four years later, he won the silver medal in the 800 metre event and the bronze medal in the 400 metre competition. With the Canadian team he won another bronze medal in the 4 × 400 metre relay contest.

At the 1930 British Empire Games (now the Commonwealth Games) he won the gold medal in the 440 yards event and the bronze medal in the 880 yards competition. With the Canadian relay team he won the silver medal in the 4 × 440 yards contest. He was a track and field athlete at the University of Notre Dame and the Alex Wilson Invitational was named for him because he went on to coach the track and field team for several decades. At Notre Dame he won the 400 meter NCAA Outdoor Championship in 1932.
