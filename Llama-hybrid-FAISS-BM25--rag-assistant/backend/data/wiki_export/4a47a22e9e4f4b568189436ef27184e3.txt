The Bakarwal (also Bakkarwal, Bakharwal, Bakrawala and Bakerwal) are a nomadic ethnic group who along with Gujjars, have been listed as Scheduled Tribes in the Indian Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh since 1991. Gujjar Bakerwal is the largest Muslim tribe in India and the third-largest ethnic community in the Indian part of Jammu and Kashmir.

As a nomadic tribe, they spread over a large area from Pir Panjal to Zanskar located in the Himalayan mountains of India to the Hindukush mountains of Afghanistan. They are goatherders and shepherds and seasonally migrate from one place to another with their herds. They are found in the Indian union territory of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh and in the Afghan province of Nuristan.

History
The Bakarwals claim the same origin as Gujjar. The Gujjars are known by many names: Ajjadh, Dohdhi Gujjars, Banhara Gujjars, and Van-Gujjars. Among Gujjars, those  who rear goats and sheep are called Bakarwals. Gujjars and Bakarwals share the same history, culture, language, sub-caste  and racial identity. They say that anthropological and genetic studies conducted on Gujjars and Bakarwals conclude that they are not separate identities in any way. In 1991 the Gujjar-Bakarwals were granted tribal status in Jammu and Kashmir by the Indian government after an exhaustive study. The study revealed that Bakarwal is another name for Gujjar and, as such, they were entered into revenue records as a separate tribal category according to the Indian constitution. Bakarwals belong to the same ethnic stock as the Gujjars, and inter-tribal marriages take place freely among them.

Etymology 

The term Bakarwal is an occupational one and is derived from the  Gojri word bakara meaning goat or sheep, and wal meaning "one who takes care of".

Society 
The Bakarwals belong to the same ethnic group as the Gujjars, and inter-tribal marriages take place among them.

Economy 
As sheep and goat rearing transhumants, the Bakarwals alternate with the seasons between high and low altitudes in the hills of the Himalayas. This is why the Bakarwals as a singular tribe are stretched from the hills of the Hindu Kush in Nuristan to the hills of the Himalayas in Uttarakhand. They are mainly found in the following areas of Nuristan Province, Kunar Province, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Azad Kashmir, Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. From here, it is clear to see that the Bakarwals mainly follow a migration route through the foothills of the Himalayas as they can be found on the Upper Himalayan Range all the way down into the Lower Himalayan Range.

Legal status 
, the Bakarwal were classified as a Scheduled Tribe under the Indian government's general reservation program of positive discrimination.
