Rita's opened its first restaurant in 1984 in Bensalem Township, Pennsylvania, a township outside of Philadelphia, and the company gradually expanded throughout the Philadelphia region before eventually opening locations beyond the Philadelphia area. The company is currently headquartered in Trevose, Pennsylvania. , the chain had 538 restaurants in 31 states, mostly located in the Mid-Atlantic.

History

Rita's was founded in May 1984 by former Philadelphia firefighter Bob Tumolo with a recipe that his mother made that he then adjusted to enhance the flavors and include real fruit. Tumolo named the restaurant after his wife, Rita Tumolo. Rita's originally advertised its product as "water ice", using the Philadelphia regional term for what is sometimes called "Italian ice" in other areas of the country. By 1987, a second store opened. In 1989, the family decided to franchise their business, and there are now over 600 locations in 30 states and Washington, D.C. that serve 45,000 people daily. 

In May 2005, the company was sold to McKnight Capital Partners, a private equity group with extensive franchise experience. McKnight Capital Partners recognized the organization's growth potential and set into place plans to expand the company.

In April 2007, Rita's moved its Bensalem Township, Pennsylvania headquarters to Trevose, Pennsylvania.

In 2011, Falconhead Capital purchased a controlling interest in the company from an investment group led by Jim Rudolph. Falconhead named their operating partner Thomas Christopoul as the new chairman and interim chief executive.

In 2013, Rita's opened its first location outside of the United States in Shenzhen, China.

Rita's has traditionally given out a free regular-sized Italian ice or water ice on the first day of Spring from 1984 to 2019, and since 2022. Rita's did not host a free water ice day on the first day of Spring in 2020â€“21, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In January 2017, Argosy Private Equity and MTN Capital acquired controlling stake in Rita's from Falconhead Capital.

Partnerships
In 2010, Rita's Italian Ice began a partnership with Just Born to offer a seasonal Peeps Brand Marshmallow Candy flavored ice. The Peeps flavor was discontinued in 2011, but was offered in some stores in spring 2017.

Rita's partnered with Cadbury in July 2009 to introduce its Swedish Fish Italian ice flavor. On June 29, 2012, Rita's partnered with Cadbury again to release its Sour Patch Kids Red water ice flavor.

Other companies involved in Rita's water ice flavors include Alex's Lemonade Stand ("Alex's Lemonade" water ice) and Nabisco ("Oreo Cookies and Cream" cream ice and "Mint Oreo" cream ice).
