Manastash Ridge is a long anticline mountain ridge located in central Washington state in the United States. Manastash Ridge runs mostly west-to-east in Kittitas and Yakima counties, for approximately 50 miles. The ridge is part of the Yakima Fold Belt of east-tending long ridges formed by the folding of Miocene Columbia River basalt flows.

The highest point in Manastash Ridge is Manastash Peak at , located  west of Ellensburg, Washington. Interstate 82 crosses through the eastern portion of the ridge; the Manastash Ridge Summit is located at milepost 7 of the interstate (south of Ellensburg) or about  north of Yakima, Washington at an elevation of .

In addition to Manastash Peak, Manastash Ridge includes the peaks of Quartz Mountain (), Mount Clifty (), and Lookout Mountain (). The astronomy department of the University of Washington maintains the Manastash Ridge Observatory, located about  west-southwest of Ellensburg.
