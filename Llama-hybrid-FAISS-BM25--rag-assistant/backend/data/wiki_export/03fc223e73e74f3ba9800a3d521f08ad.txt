Vesnianka (; also referred to as Hahilkа, Hailkа, Haivkа, Yahilkа, or Rohulkа) is a type of spring dance songs performed in the lands of present-day Ukraine which have been performed for thousands of years. While they pre-date Christianity, Christian missionaries altered many of the dances by incorporating Christian themes into the songs and poetry which accompany the dancing.
