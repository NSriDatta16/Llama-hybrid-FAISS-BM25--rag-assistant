The Puddle Lane children's books were published by Ladybird Books during the second half of the 1980s. The stories were based on a TV program of the same name. Sheila K McCullagh, who wrote the stories for the TV program, also wrote the books.

 When The Clock Struck Thirteen (31 Oct 1985): At the top of the clock tower in the Magician's House, an Iron Boy strikes the bell every hour of the day.  One night at midnight, the Iron Boy strikes the bell thirteen times, bringing him to life and requests the Magician make him a real boy, but as the Magician's magic dust only works on toy animals and not iron people, he sends the Iron Boy on the Flying Saucer to the Country of Zorn, where the Iron Boy must go to the Blue Mountains where the magic waters of the Silver River can make him a real boy.
 The Sandalwood Girl (31 Oct 1985): A Sandalwood Girl sits in the attic of the Magician's House.  On the night the Iron Boy strikes the clock bell thirteen times, the Sandalwood Girl comes to life as well and, like the Iron Boy, would also like to be real.

 The Fire in the grass (30 Jan 1986): Continuing their quest, the Iron Boy and the Sandalwood Girl come to a large grass field where red fire-breathing dragons live.  After narrowly escaping a dragon that sets fire to the grass (with the Iron Boy testing his bravery by carrying the Sandalwood Girl) and with help from a hare, they make their way to a cave where three flying Silver Ponies take them the rest of the way to the Blue Mountains.
 The Silver River (30 Jan 1986): Upon arrival in the Blue Mountains, the Silver Ponies drop off the Iron Boy and the Sandalwood Girl at a cliff that overlooks a lake that has the magic waters of the Silver River.
