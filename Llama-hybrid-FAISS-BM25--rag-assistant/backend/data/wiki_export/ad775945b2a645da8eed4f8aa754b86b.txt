Jason Jordan (born May 30, 1978) is a retired professional soccer player who formerly played for the Vancouver Whitecaps in the First Division of the United Soccer Leagues.

Career
Born in Richmond, British Columbia, Jordan began playing college soccer at Langara College in 1998 and 1999. He signed with the Vancouver 86ers in 1997.

In June 2002, he turned down a contract offer from the Colorado Rapids of Major League Soccer in favour of remaining with the Whitecaps.

In the 2005 season he enjoyed a career year with the Whitecaps being named 2005 USL First Division MVP and lead the league with 17 goals. That same year, Jordan was named Whitecaps Player of the Year, was presented with the "Domenic Mobilio Golden Boot", and shared the Supporter's MVP award with goalkeeper Mike Franks.

Unfortunately, he suffered numerous injuries in 2006 that restricted him to playing only six games in the regular season and two games in the playoffs. Despite limited action, he tallied two assists and fired six shots in his regular season appearances as the Whitecaps won the USL First Division Championship, beating the Rochester Raging Rhinos 3–0.

On December 19, 2008, Jordan was released from the Vancouver Whitecaps and retired few days later.
