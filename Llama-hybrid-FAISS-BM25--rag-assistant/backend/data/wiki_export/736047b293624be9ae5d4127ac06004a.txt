František Antonín Míča (also Micza or Mitscha; 2 September 1696 – 15 February 1744) was a Czech conductor, tenor singer and composer.

Míča was born in Náměšť nad Oslavou. He conducted many opera performances for royal families. The most paramount example of his work is probably the opera O původu Jaroměřic (About the Origins of Jaroměřice), written in both Italian and Czech, in which he also sung the role of Gualtero. He died in Jaroměřice nad Rokytnou.

A symphony now believed to be by his nephew František Adam Míča was once attributed to him.
