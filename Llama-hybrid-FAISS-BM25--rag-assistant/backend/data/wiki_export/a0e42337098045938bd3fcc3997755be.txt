Creation Is Crucifixion is a technical metalcore band from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The group originally formed under the name Chapter in 1995, but changed the name to Creation Is Crucifixion in 1997. The band was known for its complicated sound, which varied from ambient noise to more complex pieces. Their lyrical themes often dealt with technology and various functions of society, such as politics and religion.

The members of the band formed Hactivist Media in 2001 to release the recordings and experiments of the group. This signaled a step in the band's evolution as the group became increasingly political with the release of their Child as Audience CD in 2001, which featured a large booklet printed in multiple languages that theorized using technology as subversion (focusing on the reprogramming of children's video games). The band also experimented with various formats by releasing compositions on 3.5" discs through the organization.

Creation Is Crucifixion has been mostly inactive since 2002. There is a further release in the works via Robotic Empire, but the release has suffered numerous delays.

Former member, Scott Mellinger is a member of hardcore Zao. Michael Laughlin was formerly the drummer of the deathgrind band Cattle Decapitation.
