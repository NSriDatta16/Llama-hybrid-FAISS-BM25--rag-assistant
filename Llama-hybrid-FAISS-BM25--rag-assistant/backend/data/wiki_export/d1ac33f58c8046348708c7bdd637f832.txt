This is now the site of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority low-level radioactive waste repository. The site, which was opened in 1959 by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority, covers about , and holds about one million cubic metres of radioactive waste, although historic disposal records are incomplete.
