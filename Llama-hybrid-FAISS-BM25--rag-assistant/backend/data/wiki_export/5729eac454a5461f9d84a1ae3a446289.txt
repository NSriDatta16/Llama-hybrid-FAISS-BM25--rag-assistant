History 
Native Indians referred to Crystal Lake as "Suncook" in reference not only to the lake, but also to the Suncook River that originates there. Early settlers referred to Crystal Lake as Lougee's Pond, in reference to the Lougee family that resided on the western side of the lake.

Iron content in and around Crystal Lake was enough to attract interest in iron mining; references to mining date back to 1778. The settlement that grew up at the outlet of Crystal Lake is accordingly called Gilmanton Ironworks.

In the early 1900s a resort known as "The Pines" was established on the southern peninsula of Crystal Lake. The resort subsequently burned down and was abandoned.

Wildlife 
Crystal Lake is a nesting site for common loons and is a good place to see them in breeding plumage during the summer months.  Bald eagles and great blue herons are also known to visit the lake. Moose, black bear, otters, and beavers have been sighted near the shoreline.
