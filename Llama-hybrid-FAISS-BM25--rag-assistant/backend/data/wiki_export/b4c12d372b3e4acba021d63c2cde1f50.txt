The 1990–91 season of the European Cup Winners' Cup was won by Manchester United against Barcelona. The victory for United was significant as it was the season English clubs returned to European football, after completing a five-year ban as a result of the Heysel Stadium disaster.

Teams
A total of 33 teams participated in the competition. Yugoslav Cup winners Red Star Belgrade won the double, and cup runners-up Hajduk Split were disqualified, so no representative of Yugoslavia participated.
