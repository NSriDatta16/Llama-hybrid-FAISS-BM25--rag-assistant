Coaching career

Early career
Schottenheimer was an assistant coach from 1997 to 2005 with the St. Louis Rams, Kansas City Chiefs, Syracuse Orange, and USC Trojans, including as quarterback coach for the Washington Redskins and San Diego Chargers. He was an assistant under his father, Marty Schottenheimer, in three of those coaching positions: Kansas City Chiefs, Washington Redskins, and San Diego Chargers.

New York Jets
In 2006, he became offensive coordinator for the New York Jets and, in early 2007, Schottenheimer's name was floated around as being a possible replacement for the departed Nick Saban as the Miami Dolphins head coach. He later removed his name from consideration for the Dolphins head coaching position, preferring to stay with the New York Jets.

After the 2008 NFL season, when Jets coach Eric Mangini was fired, Schottenheimer was one of the first candidates interviewed for the open head coaching position. However, he eventually lost out to Baltimore Ravens defensive coordinator Rex Ryan. On January 13, 2010, Schottenheimer announced that he was staying with the Jets as offensive coordinator and would not interview for the head coaching vacancy in Buffalo.

St. Louis Rams
On January 10, 2012, Schottenheimer announced he would not return to the Jets for the 2012 season. On January 21, 2012, Schottenheimer became the offensive coordinator of the St. Louis Rams.

Georgia
On January 7, 2015, it was announced that Schottenheimer would take over as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach for the Georgia Bulldogs football team of the University of Georgia, under head coach Mark Richt.  Following Richt's firing at the end of the 2015 season, Schottenheimer announced on December 14 to his position players that he would not return as a Georgia Bulldogs assistant coach in 2016.

On January 12, 2021, Schottenheimer was fired by the Seahawks following the Seahawks' Wild Card loss to the Los Angeles Rams due to "philosophical differences". Despite a torrid start to the 2020 season which saw career highs for quarterback Russell Wilson in touchdowns and completion percentage, Seattle's offense struggled considerably during the final weeks, with Schottenheimer taking the brunt of the scrutiny due to lack of creativity in the offense and adjustments to the scheme. Regardless, the Seahawks set their franchise record for points scored in a season with 459.

Jacksonville Jaguars
On February 1, 2021, Schottenheimer was hired by the Jacksonville Jaguars as their passing game coordinator under head coach Urban Meyer.
