Year-by-year

Note: The 1976 Chicago Cats were declared by ASL commissioner Bob Cousy to have forfeited an unplayed, season-ending match against Cleveland. The forfeit leveled the two teams with 80 points. At the same time Commissioner Cousy controversially gave the final playoff spot to Cleveland, even though Chicago held the first two tiebreakers; wins and goal-differential.
