"Day & Night" is a song by English singer turned actress Billie Piper. The song was written by Piper, Eliot Kennedy, Mark Cawley, Mike Percy and Tim Lever for Piper's second album Walk of Life (2000). It was released as the album's lead single on 15 May 2000 to positive reviews from music critics. It was a commercial success, reaching number one in the United Kingdom and earning a silver certification. According to Piper's autobiography and various sources, the single sold over a quarter of a million copies in the United Kingdom alone.

Critical reception
The song received positive reviews from music critics. Yahoo! reviewer Jackie Flynn wrote that the song was a "slick piece of dominatrix dance" with "big buffed chords and spike-heel beats". Peter Robinson of NME described "Day & Night" as "exciting" and the magazine wrote that the song was "somewhat harder and American sounding" than her previous singles.
