The Miss Missouri Teen USA competition is the pageant that selects the representative for the state of Missouri in the Miss Teen USA pageant. It is directed by Vanbros and Associates, based in Lenexa, Kansas. In 1993, Missouri joined the Vanbros group of state pageants for the Miss USA and Teen USA system.

Missouri is in the top 10 most successful states at Miss Teen USA in terms of number and value of placements. Six Missouri teens have gone on to compete at Miss USA, although only four as Miss Missouri USA. The other two represented Kansas, another Vanbros state.

Two notable Miss Missouri Teen USAs (who both later won the title Miss Missouri USA) are Larissa Meek and Melana Scantlin, who appeared on the reality TV show Average Joe.

Shae Smith of Bolivar was crowned Miss Missouri Teen USA 2022 on May 1, 2022 at The Mansion Theater for the Performing Arts in Branson, Missouri. She will represent Missouri for the title of Miss Teen USA 2022 in the fall of 2022.
