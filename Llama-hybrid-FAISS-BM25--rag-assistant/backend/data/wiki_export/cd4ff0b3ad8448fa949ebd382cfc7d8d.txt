Point University is a private evangelical Christian college in West Point, Georgia. It was founded in 1937 as Atlanta Christian College in East Point. The college announced its name change to Point University in 2011 and relocated its main campus to West Point in June 2012.

History

Atlanta Christian College 
Atlanta Christian College was founded in 1937 by Thomas Olin Hathcock (1879–1966), a prominent Fulton County, Georgia judge from 1914 until 1942. He and his wife, Nora Head Hathcock, were members of the Christian churches and churches of Christ, the denomination that the institution has always been affiliated with. The property for the campus was from a 300-acre farm Nora Hathcock had inherited.

Following its 1937 founding, Atlanta Christian College devoted itself mainly to the education of ministers, missionaries, and other church-related workers. In 1965, the college became an accredited member of the American Association of Bible Colleges (AABC). In 1990, in conjunction with a broadening of its curriculum, the college was accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) to award associate and baccalaureate degrees.

Point University 
In 2011, the institution's name was changed to Point University. The following year, the college relocated its main campus to West Point, Georgia, an hour southwest of the previous main campus near Atlanta. Adult learning classes were continued to be held at the East Point location, as well as an adult learning program and dual-credit enrollment program for high school students at the off-site locations in Peachtree City, Savannah, and Birmingham, Alabama.

In addition to renovating the former West Point-Stevens headquarters for use as the primary academic building for traditional program studies in West Point, the institution also has apartment-style student housing in nearby Valley, Alabama.

In addition to moving its main campus in 2012, the institution was also accepted into the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). The institution's athletics program expanded as part of the transition from the National Christian College Athletic Association (NCCAA) to the NAIA, including the addition of intercollegiate football, softball and cross country beginning in fall 2011. The athletics nickname was also changed from the Chargers to the Skyhawks. In Spring 2014, the Point University Skyhawks were admitted to the recently started Sun conference as a charter member.
