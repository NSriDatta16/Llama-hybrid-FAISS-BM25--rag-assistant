Members
The SBC has 22 full members schools located within Erie, Huron, Ottawa, Sandusky, & Seneca counties.  The schools range in size from Division 3 to Division 7.

St. Wendelin would join them later.  This league's intent was to have 8 football-playing members and 2-3 non-football schools.  This league will ultimately give a home to the remaining MAL schools.

Invitations were accepted by Lakota, New Riegel, Old Fort, Fremont St. Joseph Central Catholic, Sandusky St. Mary Central Catholic & Fostoria St. Wendelin Catholic (all of which now play in the Sandusky River League), Tiffin Calvert, a former member of the SBC now a member of the TAAC, and Vermilion, currently a member of the West Shore Conference.
2016: On March 16, Clyde principal William J. Webb and the Northern Ohio League announced that the NOL will merge into the SBC for the 2017-18 school year. Bellevue, Norwalk, Sandusky, Shelby, Tiffin Columbian, and Willard will become the league's newest members.

2016 Expansion
The first wave of expansion will begin with the 2016-17 school year and will consist of two divisions that will divide schools by size.  The larger schools will make up the Bay Division, and the smaller schools will make up the River Division.  The divisional lineup will vary depending on the sport, with Margaretta playing in the River Division for football & wrestling, and in the Bay Division for all other sports.  New Riegel & Old Fort do not have football.  The two divisions will operate more-or-less as two separate leagues under a single parent umbrella and will crown two separate champions in each sport.  There will be no forced crossovers in football and inter-divisional games will not count toward conference records.

2017 Expansion
On March 16, 2016, both Clyde principal William J. Webb and NOL president Nate Artino (Bellevue principal) announced that six of the NOL schools were invited to join the SBC for the 2017-18 school year.  Mr. Webb declined to disclose details on divisional breakdowns until all six school boards had approved the league switch.

On March 17, 2016, Norwalk Director of Student Activities Josh Schlotterer advised the divisional breakdown would be based on enrollment and some schools would slide between divisions for football and all other sports as there are three non-football members.

2018 Expansion
On March 16, 2017, SBC Executive Secretary/Treasurer Gregg Hedden announced that Danbury Local Schools would be joining the conference, effective in 2018, adding that Danbury would be a member of the River Division.

On March 20, SBC Executive Secretary/Treasurer Gregg Hedden announced that Gibsonburg Local Schools would be joining the River Division, effective 2018. Their school board voted unanimously to join at the fall of 2018 sports season. Gibsonburg leaves the Toledo Athletic Area Conference. This adds Gibsonburg as the 9th Member of the River Division.

After a school board meeting in August 2017, Hopewell-Loudon agreed to join the River Division for the 2019-2020 school year.
