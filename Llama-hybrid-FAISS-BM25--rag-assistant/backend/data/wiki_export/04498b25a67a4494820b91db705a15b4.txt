Writing
Gubler wrote and illustrated his first book, Rumple Buttercup: A Story of Bananas, Belonging and Being Yourself, which was released on April 2, 2019. It is published as a children's book, but Gubler says it is for all ages, "for anyone who's ever felt like they didn't quite fit in, just to make them know that they're not alone... My hope in writing the book was to find a way to give the world a 136-page hug." He hand-wrote or hand-drew everything in the book â€“ "every single word, every single illustration, including the bar code and the lengthy copyright page." Within weeks of its release, the book was ranked #1 in its category on the New York Times Best Seller list.

Personal life
As of 2009, Gubler divided his time between Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and New York City.

In 2009, while filming (500) Days of Summer in Los Angeles, Gubler dislocated his knee while out dancing. The injury required three surgical procedures and the use of a cane for nearly a year, which was written into the script of Criminal Minds. 

On October 27, 2014, Gubler became a certified minister and officiated at the wedding of Steve Damstra and Gubler's Criminal Minds co-star Paget Brewster on November 29, 2014.
