The Vancouver Nats were a major junior ice hockey team based in Vancouver, British Columbia that played two seasons in the Western Canada Hockey League from 1971 to 1973. The team relocated in 1973 to Kamloops to become the Kamloops Chiefs before settling in Seattle as the Seattle Breakers (later Thunderbirds) in 1977.

On the ice, the Nats finished last overall in the league both years, winning just 27 games in their two years.  After their demise, it would be nearly thirty years before the WHL would return to the city of Vancouver, with the Vancouver Giants established as an expansion team in 2001.
