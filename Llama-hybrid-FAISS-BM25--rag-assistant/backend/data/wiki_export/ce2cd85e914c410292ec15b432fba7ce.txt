Geography

Darling Heights lies on the southern edge of the city, on the west ridge. The land falls away steeply to the west toward Drayton, the slope being occupied by detached bungalow housing with an admixture of larger homes, duplexes and small blocks of units. Most of these dwellings are less than 10 years old, the area having previously been mostly horse paddocks, of which few remain. The homes and businesses in the western part of Darling Heights are considered part of Drayton. To the east, the upper valley of West Creek forms the suburb of Kearneys Spring, the western part of which is considered part of Darling Heights by many people. The southern part of the suburb is an area of acreage blocks and small farms. To the north lies the suburb of Harristown.

In 1992, the institute it was renamed the University of Southern Queensland.

Darling Heights State School opened on 29 January 1980.
