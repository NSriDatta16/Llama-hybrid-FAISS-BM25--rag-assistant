Arnouphis or Harnouphis was an Egyptian  who, according to Dio Cassius, saved the Roman legion XII Fulminata during a campaign against the Quadi in about AD 172 by calling up a rainstorm. Dio Cassius calls Arnouphis a magos, originally a term for Zoroastrian priests. David Frankfurter says that Arnouphis was an Egyptian priest, but he was called a magos because Romans regarded priests from many Near Eastern cultures as fitting a single stereotype of exotic magicians.

In popular culture
