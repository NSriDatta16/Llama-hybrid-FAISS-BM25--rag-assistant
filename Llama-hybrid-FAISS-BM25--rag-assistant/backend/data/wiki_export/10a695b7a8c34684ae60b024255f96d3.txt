After Sex () is a 1997 film by French director Brigitte Roüan.

Roüan stars in the film as Diane Clovier, a married mother of two who has an affair with the friend of a young writer she is mentoring. Meanwhile, her husband, a lawyer, is defending a woman charged with murdering her unfaithful spouse.

The film was well received in its native France, but raised some eyebrows for its sympathetic treatment of a woman's infidelity. The film also received positive notice in the United States, where it was released in 1998. It was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival.

The original French title, literally "After Coitus, Sad Animal", alludes to post-coital tristesse.
