Chapelizod House, known as the Viceregal Lodge, was a late medieval residence in Chapelizod, at the time a village outside Dublin (but now a suburb) which in the 1680s was used as a temporary residence for the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland following a fire which had destroyed the Viceregal Apartments in Dublin Castle.

Contemporary accounts stated that the Viceroy and Vicereine abandoned the use of the house after a short time and moved to live in a property elsewhere in the city because the found that Chapelizod House was haunted.

The viceregal couple later returned to live in Dublin Castle, after the Viceregal Apartments had been rebuilt.

The precise whereabouts of Chapelizod House, which has long since been demolished, are not recorded in detail.

The importance of the building is noted by the fact that Thomas Burgh, Surveyor General of Ireland, is recorded as having carried out works on the house in 1709.

Áras an Uachtaráin 

A later building, now known as Áras an Uachtaráin, the official residence of the President of Ireland, later became more associated with the name Viceregal Lodge, a name that it used from 1781 to 1938.
