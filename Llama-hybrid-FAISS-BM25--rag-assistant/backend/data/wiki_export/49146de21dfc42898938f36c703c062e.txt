Cordelia is an unincorporated community in Solano County, California, United States. Cordelia is located at the junction of Interstate 80 and California State Route 12 and at the northern end of Interstate 680,  west of Fairfield.

History

The community of Cordelia was founded in 1853 by clipper ship captain Robert H. Waterman, and initially named "Bridgeport" after the Atlantic coastal town of Bridgeport, Connecticut. Around 1869, a post office was established, and the United States Post Office Department declared that a more unique name for the town should be chosen. Waterman, who had also chosen Fairfield for the nearest town 
to honor his former hometown of Fairfield, Connecticut, then chose "Cordelia", after his wife.

In 1880, the Wells Fargo agency was established in Cordelia.
