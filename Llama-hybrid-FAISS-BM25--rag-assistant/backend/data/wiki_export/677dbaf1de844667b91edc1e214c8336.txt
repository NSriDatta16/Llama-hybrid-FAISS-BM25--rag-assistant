The Dnipro Arena () is a football stadium in Dnipro, Ukraine.  It is mostly for football matches and hosts the homes matches of SC Dnipro-1.  The stadium has a capacity of 31,003 people. It replaced Dnipro's old Soviet Metalurh Stadium which existed since 1940.

History

The Dnipro-Arena staged the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying match between Ukraine and England as the Olimpiysky National Sports Complex in Kyiv was being rebuilt ready for UEFA Euro 2012.

The Dnipro-Arena was chosen as a possible venue for UEFA Euro 2012, but was dropped from the list in May 2009. The capacity fell short of the minimum 33,000 seats required by UEFA.

Dnipro-Arena hosted the 2009 Ukrainian Cup final, in which Vorskla Poltava beat Shakhtar Donetsk 1â€“0.

Since the beginning of the Russian invasion in 2014, Dnipro have played their European matches at the Olympiskiy NSC Stadium in Kyiv at the behest of UEFA, although there has been comparatively less conflict in Dnipro than other areas.
