Fatih Sonkaya (born 1 July 1981) is a Turkish retired footballer who played as a right back.

He also held Dutch nationality, due to the many years spent in that country.

Club career
Although born in Oltu, Eastern Anatolia Region, Sonkaya spent most of his youth in Heerlen, Netherlands where he, together with older brother Özcan, started playing soccer at RKSV Heerlen. He started his professional career at Roda JC in 1998 and, after six seasons (three as first-choice), with a loan to VVV-Venlo in between, transferred to Beşiktaş J.K. in his homeland.

For 2005–06, Sonkaya signed for Portuguese club FC Porto, and collected the Primeira Liga winner's medal, albeit playing sparingly. The following campaign he was loaned to Académica de Coimbra also in the country, appearing in just four top division games.

After another loan, now back in the Netherlands with Roda, Sonkaya was released in June 2008 and joined Bursaspor. However, midway through the season, he moved to Azerbaijan's FK Khazar Lankaran.

In February 2010, Sonkaya returned to his country, signing with Kayseri Erciyesspor in the second level.

International career
A Turkish international since 2003, Sonkaya gained six caps, and appeared twice in the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup as the national team finished third (two 2–1 wins).
