Guido Pellegrino Arrigo Pontecorvo FRS FRSE (29 November 1907 – 25 September 1999) was an Italian-born Scottish geneticist.

Life
Guido Pontecorvo was born on 29 November 1907 in Pisa into a family of wealthy Italian industrialists. He was one of eight children. He was a brother to Gillo Pontecorvo and Bruno Pontecorvo.

He was dismissed from his post in Florence in 1938, due to his Jewish heritage. He then fled to Britain in 1939 with his new wife Leonore Freyenmuth (of German descent).

Legacy
The Institute of Genetics building at the University of Glasgow was renamed as the Pontecorvo Building in 1995 in honour of Guido Pontecorvo and to celebrate 50 years of the institute in Glasgow.  The Pontecorvo Building is part of the Anderson College complex located on Dumbarton Road in the West End of Glasgow. The building has been vacant since 2011 awaiting redevelopment. Until then it housed one of the few still operational paternoster elevators in the UK.

He has also lent his name to the annual Pontecorvo Award, presented to the final year undergraduate student in the department with the highest grades.
