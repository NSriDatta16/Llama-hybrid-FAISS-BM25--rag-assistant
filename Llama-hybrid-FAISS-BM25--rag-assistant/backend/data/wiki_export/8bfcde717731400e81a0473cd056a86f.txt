KNTS-LP (channel 17) was a low-power television station in Natchitoches, Louisiana, United States.

In 1998, CP-Tel Network Services, a local Internet services provider, acquired a former Italian restaurant to convert it into studios for the station. KNTS-LP went on the air in June and was affiliated with America One and FamilyNet; the studios were completed later, at which time the station was added to local cable systems. Weekday newscasts, originally at 6 p.m. and eventually also at 10 p.m., were added beginning in March 1999; the station also produced shows covering Northwestern State University and high school sports.

KNTS-LP ceased local operations and news production on March 31, 2001. CP-Tel president Richard Gill cited insufficient advertising revenue, rising costs, and the failure to secure a network affiliation. The station was then sold to Sanphyl Broadcasting Network; it continued to air local sports and church services. It moved from channel 17 to channel 19 in 2012.

Despite its broadcast in analog, KNTS-LP had a digital translator, KNYS-LD (channel 27). Sanphyl Broadcast Network surrendered the licenses for KNTS-LP and KNYS-LD to the Federal Communications Commission on February 15, 2021; the FCC cancelled both licenses the same day.
