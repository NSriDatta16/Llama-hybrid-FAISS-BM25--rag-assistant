Carajo was an Argentinian rock band from Buenos Aires. It was formed in 2000 with Marcelo "Corvata" Corvalan on bass and vocals, Andres "Andy" Vilanova on drums and Hernan "Tery" Langer on guitar and backing vocals. The first two share the history of having been part of the band A.N.I.M.A.L. In 2020, the band's breakup was announced.

History 

Carajo was formed in 2000 with Corvata on bass and vocals, Andy on drums and Tery on guitar and backing vocals. Their first show was at "La Diabla" on 4 May with the band Ritual. They also played in neighbouring Uruguay.

Their first album, Carajo, was recorded in 2002, and officially performed on 7 May at The Roxy in Buenos Aires. In November they played at Colombia's Rock al parque festival in front of 80,000 people. The band was named "Breakthrough Band of 2002" by Argentinian press.

In 2003, they played Cosquin Rock, one of the most important summer festivals in Argentina, before 14,000 people. The EP Carajografia was released and they were nominated for an MTV Latin America video music award for "Best New Artist".

2004 saw the release of their second full-length studio album, Atrapasueños (Dreamcatcher) and its successful presentation in front of 3000 people at Buenos Aires' "Republica Cromañon" (nearly a month before the tragedy at the same venue ended the life of 194 people during a Callejeros concert). This year also marked their first visit to Paraguay.

Carajo's first visit to Bolivia and Chile occurred in 2005. Due to an accident (Andy's broken wrist), important shows were cancelled, which resulted in the band experimenting with new sounds and musical styles. Months later, the band released Electrorroto Acustizado 2.1 (Acustified Electrobroken 2.1), a one-off show were they remade their own songs and played covers (Andy actually played the show, still with a cast on his forearm/hand).

In 2006, Carajo became the first Argentinian rock band ever to play in Cuba. The band returned to Uruguay and visited Panama for the first time.

After many delays, the band's third studio album Inmundo was released in 2007. The DVD Formando Asi Cada Parte Del Todo (Thus Forming Each Part of the Everything) containing footage of their show at Arena Obras Sanitarias in November 2005, and from their trip to Cuba was postponed indefinitely after many delays in its release (apparently due to technical problems). The band's first visit to Venezuela was slated for mid-August.

Carajo's fourth studio album is titled El Mar De Las Almas (The Sea of Souls) was released on 23 September. The first single of the album is called "Acido" (Acid).

The band's first double album, Frente A Frente was released on 25 September 2013 and produced by Alejandro Vazquez.

On 12 August, the band released a documentary film/live album called Hoy Como Ayer, with new songs and a documentary that shows the 15 years of group's career.
