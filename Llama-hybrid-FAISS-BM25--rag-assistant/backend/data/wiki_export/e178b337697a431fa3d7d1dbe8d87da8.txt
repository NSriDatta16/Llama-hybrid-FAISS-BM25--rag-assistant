Nanjing Tech University (NJTech; ), colloquially known as Nan Gong (or Nangong, 南工), is a public technological university located in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China. It is located 300 km from Shanghai. NJTech was part of the first group of universities approved by the Chinese Ministry of Education for the training of “Excellent Engineers.”  The university specializes in engineering.

History 
Nanjing Tech University has a history of more than one hundred years as a cradle of education. It is a key institution of higher learning to be constructed in Jiangsu Province and one of the first group of institutions of higher learning approved by the Chinese Ministry of Education for the training of "Excellent Engineers". Nanjing University of Technology was established by merging the former Nanjing University of Chemical Technology and the former Nanjing Institute of Architecture and Civil Engineering in May 2001. The origin of Nanjing University of Chemical Technology can be traced back to Sanjiang Normal School, established in 1902, which later changed to be National Central University in 1928 and Nanjing University in 1949, whose engineering departments formed Nanjing Institute of Technology by merging related engineering departments of several other universities in 1952 and then the chemical engineering department became Nanjing College of Chemical Technology in 1958 and renamed Nanjing University of Chemical Technology in 1995, and the origin of Nanjing Institute of Architecture and Civil Engineering was formerly the Department of Mechanics of Tongji Medical and Engineering School established in 1915. Nanjing University of Technology became a comprehensive university with engineering as its focus.
At the beginning of 2014, Nanjing University of Technology was renamed Nanjing Tech University.

Programs and facts 
Today, Nanjing University of Technology consists of two campuses, one on Mofan Road and the other one in Jiangpu, covering a total area of 4000 mu (or ).
