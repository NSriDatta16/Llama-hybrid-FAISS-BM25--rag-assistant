The David Martin Mennonites, officially called Independent Old Order Mennonite Church or Independent Old Order Mennonites, are a horse and buggy group of Canadian Old Order Mennonites that is moderate concerning the use of modern technologies and that emerged in 1917. They numbered about 3,500 people in 2010 and live in Wellington County, Ontario and the Waterloo Region. In 2020 they now also live in The Municipality of Grey Highlands, Simcoe County, and Township of Southgate. They do not cooperate with other Old Order groups.

History 

In 1917 the David Martin Mennonites emerged under the leadership of Minister David B. Martin (1838-1920) from the Old Order Mennonite Conference in Ontario, mainly concerning issues of discipline. In the next decades the young church was not without troubles and struggled to maintain its members. They used the ban on several occasions and growth was slow.

In 1954, a group of about 25 people separated from the David Martin Mennonites and in 1956 Elam S. Martin, their minister, was excommunicated from the David Martin Mennonites. This Elam Martin group with others formed the Orthodox Mennonites in 1958. Since then the David Martins adopted a policy not to talk to outsiders about their faith. "We have lost too many people", bishop David W. Martin stated. The David Martins have grown rapidly through natural increase since 1958.

In 1987, the majority of the Anson Hoover group, a subgroup of Orthodox Mennonites consisting of some 70 members, went back to the David Martin Mennonites. In 1979 the David Martins, as a group, unanimously accepted the telephone.

In their homes they have electric light, freezers, refrigerators and propane stoves are accepted. David Martin Mennonites send their children to public schools which their children attend until they are 14 years old.
