Authorship
"Slip On Through" was originally credited to Dennis Wilson alone. After Brother Records archive manager Alan Boyd consulted with Wilson's publishing and estate, a credit for Gregg Jakobson was added to the song on the 2021 compilation Feel Flows.

Recording
An early version of the song was recorded at Gold Star Studios in Hollywood. The final version was recorded at the Beach Boys' studio on October 6, 1969.

Reception
Brian Wilson said, "It was a really dynamic song. Dennis, I was very proud of, because he really rocked and rolled on that one. Dennis did really interesting energetic things on that."
