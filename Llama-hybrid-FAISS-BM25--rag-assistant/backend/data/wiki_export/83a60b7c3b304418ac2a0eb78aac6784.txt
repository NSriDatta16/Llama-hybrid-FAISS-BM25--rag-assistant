The LVII Legislature of the Congress of Mexico met from 1997 to 2000.

It was the first session in 68 years where the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) did not hold an absolute majority over opposition parties in the Chamber of Deputies. The National Action Party (PAN), the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), the Labor Party (PT), the Ecologist Green Party of Mexico (PVEM), and two independents combined for 261 of the 500 seats.
