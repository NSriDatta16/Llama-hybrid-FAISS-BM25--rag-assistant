Vladimír Godár (born 16 March 1956, in Bratislava) is a Slovak classical and film score composer. He is also known for his collaboration with the Czech violinist, singer, and composer Iva Bittová. As an academic, he is a writer, editor, and translator of books on historical music research. He has been active in reviving the music and reputation of 19th-century Slovak composer Ján Levoslav Bella.

Godár studied composition under Juraj Pospíšil and piano under Mária Masariková at the Bratislava Conservatory. In 1979, he began work as editor of the music books department of the record label OPUS, and he taught at the Academy of Performing Arts in Bratislava from 1985.

His work is little known outside Slovakia, with much of his music released by Slovart. Amongst his compositions is a large-scale sonata for cello dedicated to the memory of Victor Shklovsky.

Godár won the 2001 Georges Delerue Award for the score of the film Landscape.

His 1998 collection of essays Heretical Quodlibets" is scheduled to be published in English by Dalkey in 2024, as part of its Eastern European Literature series.
