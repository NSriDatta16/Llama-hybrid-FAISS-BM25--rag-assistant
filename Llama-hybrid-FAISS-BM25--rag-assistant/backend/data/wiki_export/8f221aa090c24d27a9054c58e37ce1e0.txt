"Breathe (2 AM)" is the debut single of American singer-songwriter Anna Nalick. The song was first released in 2004 and re-released in 2005, when it charted at number 45 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number four on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart. In New Zealand, it peaked at number 37. "Breathe (2 AM)" has been certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America.

Content
The verses tell the stories of three characters: a friend of the narrator's who has fallen into an unhappy relationship, an alcoholic soldier at Fort Bliss, and the narrator's experience of writing and performing a song. Chuck Taylor describes it as "an introspective yet confessional tale about learning to handle everyday challenges — and remembering to take time to breathe".

Release
In the United States, only a promotional disc of "Breathe (2 AM)" was released. In Australia, a proper CD single was issued, backed with acoustic versions of non-album track "Home" and album track "Catalyst".
