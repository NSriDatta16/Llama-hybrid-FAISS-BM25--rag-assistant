Acting career

1982–1989
Mukesh made his acting debut in 1982 with the film Balloon. Later, that same year he landed his first leading role with the drama film Ithu Njangalude Katha, a remake of the Tamil-language film Palaivana Solai. The film was an average grosser, with the film's songs becoming chartbusters. In the mid-80's, he appeared in several comedy films directed by Priyadarshan, usually in supporting roles.  His first film as solo hero came in 1985 with Mutharamkunnu P.O. Despite being an average grosser at the box office, the film has over the years attained a cult status. His first major commercial hit came with the 1985 film Boeing Boeing, directed by Priyadarshan. He appeared in a supporting role in the film to Mohanlal. This was his first collaboration with Mohanlal. They would go on to star in several films in the late 1980's, usually starring Mohanlal in the lead role.

Then, in 1989, he starred in Ramji Rao Speaking, a blockbuster that ran for 200 days in theatres and went on to become the second highest grossing film of the year. The film gave Mukesh his major break. Ramji Rao Speaking is considered by audiences and critics to be one of the best comedy films made in Malayalam cinema. The film still has a huge cult following. The film has been subject to many memes, with Mukesh's dialogue in the film "Kambilipothappu" becoming a catchphrase. He also starred alongside Mohanlal in Vandanam (1989), which is considered a cult classic in Malayalam cinema.

1990–1999
In the beginning of the 1990, he made an extended guest role in Priyadarshan's Akkare Akkare Akkare, which was the sequel to Patanapravesham (1989). After the success of Ramji Rao Speaking, he was offered many leading roles. The film Cheriya Lokavum Valiya Manushyarum was then released, which was a commercial success. Following the success of Cheriya Lokavum Valiya Manushyarum he again collaborated with Siddique-Lal for In Harihar Nagar, which is considered to be one of the defining films of the Malayalam golden age of comedy. The film was a box office success, running for 100 days in theatres. The film established Mukesh as a bankable lead actor in the industry. The film has over the years accumulated a cult following and huge fan base, with many scenes from the film being used in memes and online trolls today. Following the success of In Harihar Nagar, a series of unrelated low budget comedy films featuring the principal cast of the film were produced. These films usually starred Mukesh, Jagadeesh or Siddique in the lead roles. In 1990 he also formed a successful onscreen pairing with another rising star, Jayaram with successful films like Thoovalsparsham, Marupuram and Malayogom. He also starred as solo hero in commercially successful films like Gajakesariyogam, Ottayal Pattalam and Champion Thomas in the same year. His role as a serial womanizer in Kouthugal Vaartakal boosted his popularity as a lead actor. He also made his Tamil debut that same year in Manaivi Oru Manickam.

He then, in 1991 starred in the classic comedy film, Godfather directed by Siddique-Lal, another blockbuster, the film ran for 417 days at Sreekumar Theatre in Trivandrum. Godfather became the longest running film in Malayalam film industry. The film established him as one of the major stars of the Malayalam film industry. He then teamed up with director P. G. Vishwambaran, who had earlier directed him in Ithu Njangalude Katha (1982), in several successful films like Innathe Programme and Irrikku M. D. Akathundu.

He also worked with Shaji Kailas in Souhrudam (1991), in which he starred alongside Urvashi, Sai Kumar and Parvathy. However, Souhrudam was a box-office bomb. The next year, he starred alongside Jayaram in Kamal's Aayushkalam (1992), a super hit at the box office. This was the first in a set of successful collabs with director Kamal.

It ran for 125 days in theatres and was one of the highest grossers of the year.

By the mid-1990's Mukesh got stuck in an image trap, usually of a young man behaving, or thought to be behaving fraudulently under pressure, such as a bribe taking policeman, a thief on the run, or someone lying to impress his parents, or to get a job. The mid-1990's also signaled the end of the golden age of comedy. In 1995, most of his films were failures at the box office, sparring a few such as Sipayi Lahala and Mannar Mathai Speaking (the sequel to Ramji Rao Speaking). The consecutive failures of his films forced him move on to supporting roles. He appeared in a supporting role to Mammootty in the 1996 comedy-drama film Hitler, directed by Siddique of the Siddique-Lal duo. Hitler became the highest-grossing Malayalam film at the time, and completed a 300-day theatrical run. It became the most viewed film in the history of Mollywood. He then starred in Sibi Malayil's 1996 film Kanakkinavu, which was screened at the Indian Panorama section of the IFFI and won the Nargis Dutt Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration. The film was also commercially successful. The next year, all of his films except for Kalyana Kacheri, bombed at the box office. The following year, he starred in Mattupetti Machan, which was one of the highest grossers of the year and ran for 100 days in theatres. It was remade in Tamil as Banda Paramasivam, in Hindi as Housefull 2. He then made a cameo appearance as himself in the highly successful Sreekrishnapurathe Nakshathrathilakkam. 1999 was a successful year for Mukesh as he starred in two super-hits namely, Friends, which was the highest grosser of the year (He starred alongside Jayaram for the first time in 7 years and Sreenivasan) and alongside Divya Unni in the Vinayan directorial Aakasha Ganga, which was the fourth highest grossing film of the year.
