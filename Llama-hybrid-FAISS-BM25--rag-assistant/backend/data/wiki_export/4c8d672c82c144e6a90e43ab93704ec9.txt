History
Originally based on the Spanish magazine Automóvil Fórmula (issued since 1978), the first issue of Automóvil Panamericano was officially released on 15 January 1995, whereas a sample #0 issue had appeared months earlier in October 1994. The layout of this first issue's cover would retain a simple style that would abide until today, presenting Automovil'''s logo on the top header, the months' featured tested car centered, further tests on the bottom and various articles elsewhere.

The first renewal of the magazine was issued in February 2002 as editorial director Ricardo Chan Robles took charge. The magazine's frame changed to black and the logo was changed, now using a bolder typography.

Sister projectsAuto Plus (initially called "Guía Util del Automóvil") was Automóvil Panamericano's sister publication, targeted at young enthusiasts and focusing on practical issues within the automotive world, short tests and a price list. It was published monthly for eight years between 2002 and 2010.Automóvil TV was the television counterpart of the magazine.

Car of the Year
Since its first issue, Automóvil Panamericano would raffle off a brand new automobile with the Juzge su coche y gane un coche contest (Judge your car and win a car). The readers would review several aspects of their current car (if they had any) and send the answer sheet via post mail to Automóvil's headquarters in Mexico City. After the deadline, a winner would be chosen and the results of the survey would be published in the following month's issue.

However, in 1999 the contest's rules underwent a major renewal, resulting in the Best Cars of the Year'' contest, in which the favourite automobile for each category would be picked by readers, no longer having to review their own car; the contestants would send their answers via post mail as before.

Since 2003, actual silver prizes would be awarded to the people-chosen winning cars; marques would send a representative to collect the small statue at a special ceremony. Additionally, a special golden award to the Best Car of the Year (overall) would be given.
