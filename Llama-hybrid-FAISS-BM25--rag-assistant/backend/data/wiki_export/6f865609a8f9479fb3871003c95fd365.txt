Notable former residents
The statesman and one of the founding fathers of the EU, Robert Schuman, was born in a property rented by his parents on rue Jules Wilhelm within the quarter. He later attended the local primary school. In 1985 the house was purchased by the state and is now home to a small research institute.  The baptismal font used for his baptism into the Catholic church may be found in the local parish church of St. Cunegonde where an image in his boyhood likeness may also be found on a large wall painting to the left of the altar depicting an event in the life of St. Cunegonde. The artist used local people as models for a crowd scene  and the young Robert Schuman was used to represent a small boy.
