Face 2 Face is the debut album by 2face Idibia.  It was released on May 15, 2004. It became a major hit (sold up to 2 million copies) initially in Idibia's home country of Nigeria, but quickly spread through western and southern Africa, and eventually making an impact in Europe as well.   Its success owed much to lead radio track "African Queen", a guitar ballad with elements of West African folk music and hip-hop.  "Nfana Ibaga" also became a local hit.
