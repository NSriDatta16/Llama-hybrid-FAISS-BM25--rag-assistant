In 2015 Petry headlined Rice University's Campbell Lecture Series. The program was entitled "The Trouble with Michael: Artist and Rice Alumni Michael Petry Discusses His 30 Years of Art Production," and involved three lectures: "Growing Up in Public" (April 7, 2015), "Reading a Life" (April 8, 2015) and "The Art of Ethics" (April 9, 2015).

Petry co-authored Installation Art (Thames & Hudson, 1994), and Installation Art in the New Millennium (Thames & Hudson, 2003), and authored Abstract Eroticism (1996) and A Thing of Beauty is... (Academy Editions, 1997). The Trouble with Michael (ArtMedia Press, 2001) is a monograph of his artistic practice.

Petry's book Hidden Histories: 20th Century Same Sex Male Lovers in the Visual Arts (2004) accompanies the exhibition Hidden Histories he curated for The New Art Gallery Walsall. He documented the exhibition in The International Journal of Art & Design Education and to expand this for publication in Gender Sexuality, and Museums: A Routledge Reader edited by Amy K. Levin.

His book Golden Rain Volumes I & II is part of his project of the same name for Ha gamle prestegard's exhibition On the Edge for Stavanger 2008, European Capital of Culture. His work is included in the Contemporary Glass book by Black Dog Publishing. Petry's book The Art of Not Making: the new artist/artisan relationship (Thames & Hudson, 2011) looks at artists who have work produced for them by artisans.

Petry's 2013 book Nature Morte: Contemporary Artists Reinvigorate the Still Life Tradition (Thames & Hudson) revealed how leading artists of the 21st century are reinvigorating the still life, a genre previously synonymous with the 16th- and 17th-century Old Masters. Nature Morte was adapted into a touring exhibition which visited several European galleries and museums.

He has also contributed chapters to various books and journals, including Pornographic Art and the Aesthetics of Pornography (Palgrave Macmillan, 2013), Sculpture and Touch (Routledge, 2014) and Global Mobilities: Refugees, Exiles and Immigrants in Museums and Archives (Routledge, 2016).

In Petry's 2018 book, ''The Word is Art'' (Thames & Hudson) he asserts the value of text in art by examining the use of text by artists from around the world, including Bruce Nauman, Julien Breton, Jeremy Deller, Takashi Murakami, Tracey Emin, Christian Boltanski, Joe Ovelman, Jenny Holzer, Ed Ruscha, Glenn Ligon and more.

Petry also writes regularly for The Huffington Post..
