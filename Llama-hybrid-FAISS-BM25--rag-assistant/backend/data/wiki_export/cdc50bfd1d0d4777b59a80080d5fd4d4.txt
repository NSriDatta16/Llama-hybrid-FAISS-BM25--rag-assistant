The Territorial Council () is the legislative branch of the government of the French territory of Saint Pierre and Miquelon. It was previously known as the General Council (), but the name was changed to Territorial Council by a new French law on 22 February 2007, a law which also increased the council's powers. The council has 19 members, elected to five year terms. The last election was on 20 March 2022.

The Territorial Council building is a two-story structure located at Church Square in Saint-Pierre.

Organisation
The Territorial Council has 19 members, elected for a six-year term in single-seat constituencies. Elections are held in two stages. The first stage is open to all candidates and the majority of seats can only be given out if a political group achieves true majority at the ballot box. If no majority is attained on this ballot, a second ballot is held the following Sunday. On the second ballot, only a relative majority is necessary to obtain 11 out of the 19 seats. The rest of the seats (4 reserved for Miquelon) are distributed through a system of proportional representation.

President
The president of the Territorial Council has held executive power since March 2, 1982. The current president is Stéphane Artano.
