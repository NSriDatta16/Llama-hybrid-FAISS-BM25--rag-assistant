Education
After completing his  Fulbright fellowship, Grose attended Harvard University, as a graduate student in the Department of History. He wrote his  doctoral thesis on the administration of the city of Rome under the Roman Republic. His advisor was Professor Mason Hammond. Grose wrote a considerable portion of his thesis while at the American Academy in Rome in Rome, Italy. Grose received his doctoral degree from Harvard in 1975.
Thereafter, he spent one year at the Museum of Art and Archeology at the University of Missouri, in Columbia, Missouri. While at Missouri, he was strongly influenced by archeologist Gladys Davidson Weinberg (1909 – 2002) to consider the study of ancient glass. Therefore, he spent another year at the Toledo Museum of Glass in Toledo, Ohio. 

Career
Subsequently, he accepted a faculty position at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. He continued to pursue his interest in Roman glass and spent many summers at the American Academy of Rome. In 1989, he published his authoritative textbook  Early Ancient Glass. This book was quickly accepted as a definitive description of glass production during ancient Rome. Largely due to this accomplishment, Grose was selected for membership in the prestigious Society of Antiquaries of London in 1991.

Later, Grose was chosen to be Chairman of the Department of Classics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. He also was a consultant to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, and the British Museum in London.
