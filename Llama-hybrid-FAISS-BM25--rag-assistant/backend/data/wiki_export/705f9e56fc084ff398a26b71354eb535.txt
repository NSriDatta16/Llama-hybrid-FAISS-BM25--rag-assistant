The University of West Los Angeles (UWLA) is a private, for-profit law school and business school in Los Angeles, California. It maintains two campuses, one in Inglewood (West Los Angeles) and one in Woodland Hills (San Fernando Valley).

History
UWLA was founded in 1966 by Henry Blunt and three other Culver City High School educators. The School of Law received approval from the Committee of Bar Examiners of The State Bar of California in 1978. The San Fernando Valley College of Law (the first law school in the San Fernando Valley), co-founded as an independent school by Leo L. Mann and Joseph P. Lamont in 1962, was acquired and merged into UWLA in 2002.

Robert W. Brown is the current President of the University while Jay Paul Frykberg was appointed Dean of the Law School in 2013.

UWLA School of Business offers a Master of Science in Leadership, Management, and Technology program, as well as a Bachelors of Science in Business Administration degree completion program.

Accreditation, admissions, and bar exam performance 
UWLA is accredited by the WASC Senior College and University Commission. The university's School of Law is approved by the State Bar of California Committee of Bar Examiners but is not accredited by the American Bar Association. As a result, graduates only qualify to take the bar exam in California. 

The school has a 100% acceptance rate, and an undergraduate degree is not necessary for admission.

For the July 2022 California Bar Examination, five of the 37 UWLA graduates (14%) taking the exam for the first time passed (as compared to 67% for the average of all first time exam takers).
