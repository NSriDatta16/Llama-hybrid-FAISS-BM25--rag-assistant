School District 8 Kootenay Lake is a school district in British Columbia. This includes the municipalities of Nelson, Creston, Kaslo and Slocan, British Columbia, as well as many rural communities in the Regional District of Central Kootenay.

History
School District No. 8 (Kootenay Lake) was created in 1996 when the Province of B.C.'s then-Ministry of Education, Skills and Training reduced the number of school districts from 75 to 57 (now 60), largely to save money by restructuring. School District No. 86 (Creston-Kaslo) and School District No. 7 (Nelson) were amalgamated to create what is now commonly referred to as SD8.

In 2016 the district board of education considered closing Creston Education Centre, Jewett Elementary School, Salmo Elementary School, Trafalgar Middle School, Winlaw Elementary School, and Yahk Elementary School. The district voted to keep Jewett and Winlaw open.
