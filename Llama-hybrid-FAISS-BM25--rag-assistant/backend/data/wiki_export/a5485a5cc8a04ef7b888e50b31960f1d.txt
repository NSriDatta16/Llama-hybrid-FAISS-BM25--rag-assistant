Captain John Moberly (25 June 1788 â€“ 15 January 1848) was born in St. Petersburg, Russia, the son of an English merchant, Edward Moberly, a freeman of the Russia Company. He entered the Navy in 1801 when he was only 12 and by 1815 had become a post Captain, serving on a number of ships.

In 1834, Moberly was appointed to be Commandant in control of all operations appertaining to the navy, at the Penetanguishene Naval Yard on Georgian Bay, Canada. Although the naval section of the post was closed in that year, in 1835 Penetanguishene had 40 naval personnel known as a batteaux establishment for the conveyance of provisions, military stores, etc. and a general sale of craft and naval and marine appliances was ordered in 1832 and continued for some time.

While stationed in Penetanguishene, Captain Moberley was a major fundraiser for the building of an Anglican church of St. James on-the-Lines in 1837. He was later buried in the graveyard of the church along with his infant daughter, Sophia.

Family life and heritage

In 1825 Captain Moberly married Miss Mary Fock (a.k.a. Marie Foch), daughter of General Fock of the Russian Imperial Service. She was born in Sebastopol, Crimea, where her father was then stationed. General Fock (a.k.a. Foch or von Fock) was a member of a Polish family of distinction. Of this union were born nine children, six sons and three daughters.

Life after the Navy
In 1837, Capt. Moberly was offered a commission as colonel in a regiment at Barrie, Ontario; but as he was a sailor and not a soldier he relegated the honour to one of his sons. Capt. Moberly was appointed Licence Inspector for Simcoe County in 1843 and on moving to Barrie in 1844 was appointed Agent for the Bank of Upper Canada, opening the first bank branch in the County of Simcoe. He died in 1848 at Barrie at the comparatively young age of 59. Mrs. Capt. Moberly died in 1879.
