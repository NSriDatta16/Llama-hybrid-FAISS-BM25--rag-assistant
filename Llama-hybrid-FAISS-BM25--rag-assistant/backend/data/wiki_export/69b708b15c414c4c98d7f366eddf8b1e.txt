The Baitul Futuh (English: House of Victories) is a mosque complex of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, situated in Morden, London. It is one of the largest mosque complexes in Europe.  Completed in 2003 at a cost of £15 million, entirely from donations of Ahmadi Muslims, the Mosque can accommodate a total of 13,000 worshippers. The main mosque has a height of 23m above ground, and to maximise capacity the building extends below ground. Baitul Futuh is located in the south-west London suburb London Borough of Merton. It is situated next to Morden South railway station, 0.4 miles from Morden Underground station (Northern line) and one mile from Morden Road tram stop.

This mosque is the central complex of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. It is notable for being a base of local community service by the Community. Baitul Futuh has featured in national newspapers for its homeless feeding and national/local community cohesion efforts, noted under 'Community Cohesion'. Similarly, the design of the main Mosque aimed to combine traditional Islamic design with modern British architecture.

Baitul Futuh has a history of notable events. It featured in the 2015 TV documentary Britain's Biggest Mosque by Channel 5. Similarly, the mosque is host to the weekly Friday Sermons delivered by the Head of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, Mirza Masroor Ahmad, which are relayed live across a global TV network with satellite network  MTA International.

History

2003 inauguration

Mirza Tahir Ahmad, who was the head of the worldwide Ahmadiyya Muslim Community at the time, launched an appeal for funds for the building on 24 February 1995, and the land, formerly occupied by an Express Dairies depot, was purchased on 29 March 1996. The designs were produced by Oxford architectural studio, Sutton Griffin. The foundation stone was placed by Mirza Tahir Ahmad on 19 October 1999 in a ceremony attended by 2,000 guests, and inaugurated by the current head of the worldwide Community, Mirza Masroor Ahmad, on 3 October 2003. The opening ceremony was attended by over 600 guests; those present included High Commissioners, Deputy High Commissioners, Members of European Parliament, Members of Parliament, Mayors of London boroughs, Councillors, university lecturers, and representatives of 17 nations.

2015 fire

On 26 September 2015, a major fire broke out at the administrative side of the mosque complex - adjacent to the main mosque. The fire brigade were called at 12:20 noon and the blaze was soon declared a 'major incident'. 10 fire engines, an aerial platform and 80 fire-fighters tackled the fire. The fire was under control at 5:32pm, more than 5 hours after the initial report, and was extinguished after 30 hours of firefighting.

By the end of the day, no suggestion of a deliberate attack was made. Two teenagers were arrested the following day on suspicion of arson. However, the elder of the two was soon released without charge.

The majority of the building damage occurred at the front of the complex, within the administrative block of the site (which consisted of office space and function halls). The men's and women's prayer area were not affected. According to news reports, 50% of the ground floor, as well as the first floor and the roof were ablaze.  The site was evacuated by site staff and one man was hospitalised after he collapsed and blacked out from smoke inhalation. London Fire Brigade later reported that the "mosque itself is thankfully unaffected". Extensive structural damage led to complex demolition work (adjacent to the functioning TV studio, major A-road and main mosque) over several months in 2017.

The blaze created a huge plume of smoke, visible for miles in South West London, and caused widespread traffic congestion, bus disruption and rail suspension. The A24 London Road, a major London A-road, was shut down for hours because of its proximity to Baitul Futuh.

Notable events 
 In 1999, the foundation stone was laid by Mirza Tahir Ahmad (the fourth head of the worldwide Ahmadiyya Community).

Community
The Morden Mosque is notable for its efforts in serving the greater community. Baitul Futuh has featured in national news for its peace work and community cohesion efforts. The design of Baitul Futuh also aims to combine modern British architecture.

Several events are held at the Baitul Futuh Mosque to serve the greater community. The complex hosts school tours, local college exams, local community events, multi-faith conferences, the annual National Peace Symposium, and visiting dignitaries. In addition to regular congregational prayers, its services include weekly homeless feeding across London, volunteering events, local community events and the 'Merton Youth Partnership Annual Conference’, and the hosting of the BBC Radio 4 Programme Any Questions?,. The Mosque receives over 10,000 visitors a year from schools, open events, faith groups, public service organisations, charities, local and central government.

The National Peace Symposium 2010 chose the location to award the first Ahmadiyya Muslim Peace Prize to Lord Eric Avebury. The award was for lifetime contribution to global Human Rights. The Peace Prize is awarded annually "in recognition of an individual’s or an organisation’s contribution for the advancement of the cause of peace". The Ahmadiyya Muslim Peace Prize has since been awarded annually at the Peace Symposium hosted at the Baitul Futuh Mosque.

The Baitul Futuh Mosque acted as the centre for the UK-wide 'Loyalty, Freedom and Peace Campaign', which sought to challenge stereotypes of the faith, remove misconceptions, start conversations and improve the integration of Muslims and non-Muslims.

Redevelopment for 2020

Plans were made to redevelop the administrative block (consisting of office space and function halls) damaged by a large fire in September 2015. Proposals for the reconstruction were designed by renowned London architecture firm John McAslan + Partners. 

Reconstruction funds were raised from fire damages repaid by the insurer, and additional donations from the British Ahmadi community.[51] The London architectural studio published its initial concepts online in July 2016.

In January 2017, several months of complicated demolition work took place close to the major A24 London Road, Morden South Railway Station bridge and the adjacent functioning main Mosque. Planning and consultation work for the rebuild also took place in 2017/2018.

The new Foundation Stone was placed by Mirza Masroor Ahmad, head of the worldwide Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, on 4 March 2018. Following this ceremony, a two-year expectation was set for the new building to open. Construction work began in October 2018 and was completed in March 2023

Grand reopening 
Britain’s biggest mosque fully reopened on Saturday 4th March 2023 after 8 years following a costly rebuild of about $24 million after the complex was partly destroyed by a huge fire in 2015. 

A £20 million renovation project has seen the facade of the building re-worked with an ornate, geometric design. The mosque has also been re-built with some special new features, including solar panels on the roof, and other energy and water-saving features, to make it more sustainable. 

Its administration building has been rebuilt as a five-storey complex with two large multipurpose halls, offices and guest rooms.

The exterior utalised light colored marble imported from Portugal, with 20 meter high columns.

Hazrat Mirza Masroor Ahmad, the worldwide head and Caliph of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, inaugurated the new complex and delivered a keynote address. More than 1500 people from 40 countries attended the 19th National UK Peace Symposium which was held on 4 March 2023 along with the Grand Reopening of the newly built complex.

MTA Television Studios
The Baitul Futuh complex includes the Mosque and an administrative block, which is the location of the UK studio of the MTA International Studios (Muslim Television Ahmadiyya). There are two studios on site that are home to several television shows and other media relayed to the MTA online channels and television channels in the UK (e.g. the Sky MTA channel) and globally. MTA has a complete post production studio on site that processes its broadcast material.

The fundamental role of MTA is to provide a platform for the head of the worldwide Ahmadiyya Community, Mirza Masroor Ahmad, to address his community members across the globe and also the wider global audience. Baitul Futuh also serves as the location of the weekly Friday Sermons delivered by Mirza Masroor Ahmad and these sermons are live broadcast globally on MTA's television channels and social media channels.

The studio also hosts the Voice of Islam radio station.

Khilafat Centenary Gallery (exhibition space)
Multi-functional halls
MTA Television Studios and the Voice of Islam (VOI) radio station

Architectural design 

The Baitul Futuh complex includes the mosque and an administrative block. A standout design feature of the mosque is the 18 metre diameter "shimmering silver dome" made of stainless steel (as reviewed by Exploring Surrey's Past). The interior of this dome is lined with hand-painted silver Arabic calligraphy from the Quran. The mosque's two upper (above ground) and lower (below ground) prayer halls span spaces of 28m x 36m.  The exterior walls of the mosque are made with polished marble tiles. Huge glass panels make the entrance to the mosque.

The mosque was designed from the ground up, the adjoining multi-functional halls were renovated from an existing derelict dairy building. The original site's chimney was converted into the 35m minaret featured right.

Oxford architectural studio Sutton Griffin designed the complex and Carter Jonas designed the mosque with the Ahmadiyya Muslim Association.  The design of Baitul Futuh aims to combine modern British architecture, and the environmentally-friendly building design won the prestigious Green Award. Renowned architects John McAslan + Partners, notable for King's Cross station and The Roundhouse in London, were chosen to design a large administration block in the location of the previous block which was damaged by a serious fire in 2015.

Baitul Futuh was voted one of the ‘Top 50 Buildings in the World’ by The Spectator magazine. The mosque was also listed in the 'Best 50 Modern Religious Buildings' published by The Independent newspaper.

The Baitul Futuh Mosque in Morden is part of the architectural event Open House London, an annual event in September which recognises building design.
