History
In 1965 in Zermatt (Switzerland) representatives of the mountain guides associations from Italy, France, Austria, and Switzerland decided to lay the foundations for an international federation of all mountain guides associations. The first statutes were in 1966.

Activities
The purposes of the federation are:
 Adjustment of the laws of the mountain guides by promoting standardized professional training as possible, in order to facilitate the practice of the mountain guide occupation abroad. Among other things by issuing a common international document of identification.
 When needed to give an arbitral tribunal, that has an advisory function and serves as mediate in case of points of issue between members and third parties.
 To study problems of general and economic nature affecting the occupation of mountain guides.
 To order to arrange closer comradeship and the exchange of ideas amongst the mountain guides of all nations.
