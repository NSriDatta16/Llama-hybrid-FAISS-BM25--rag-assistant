"Almost Persuaded" is a song written by  Glenn Sutton and Epic Records producer Billy Sherrill and first recorded by David Houston in 1966.  It is not to be confused with the Christian hymn of the same name.

Content
The song is about a married man who, while patronizing a tavern, sees a beautiful young woman and is instantly smitten. Forgetting that he is married, he nearly succumbs to temptation. However, when the two share a slow dance, he notices a reflection of his wedding ring literally in her eyes and, remembering his vows to his wife, leaves.

Legacy
"Almost Persuaded" spent nine weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart starting in August 1966 and has since gone on to become a country standard. The song was also a moderate pop hit, reaching twenty-four on the Billboard pop chart and was David Houston's only top 40 entry on the pop charts.

For 46 years and two months, no No. 1 song matched the chart-topping longevity of "Almost Persuaded," until Taylor Swift's "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together" notched its ninth week atop the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart the week of December 15, 2012.

The song won a Grammy Award for Best Country & Western Recording of 1966.

Other versions
Later in 1966, singer-comedian Sheb Wooley, performing as Ben Colder, released a parody version entitled "Almost Persuaded No. 2." Here, an already-drunk man enters a barroom, sits down at a table and attempts to make conversation with a young woman seated there. The two dance briefly until the woman's boyfriend steps in and makes the man leave.

Colder's version reached No. 6 on the Hot Country Singles chart and No. 58 on the Billboard Hot 100.
