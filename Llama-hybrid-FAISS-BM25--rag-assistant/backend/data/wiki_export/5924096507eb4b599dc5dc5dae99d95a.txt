History

Name changes 
The Dallas area has been under several different Catholic jurisdictions since 1841:

 Prefecture Apostolic of Texas (1841 to 1847)
 Vicariate Apostolic of Texas (1847 to 1874)
 Diocese of Galveston (1874 to 1890)
 Diocese of Dallas (1890 to 1953)
 Diocese of Dallas-Fort Worth (1953 to 1969)
 Diocese of Dallas (1969 to present)

1800 to 1890 
By 1868, the Dallas area had only one Catholic family, ministered to by priests from St. Paul in Collin County. Reverend Joseph Martinere made journeys of over hundreds of miles through swamp and forest to reach the area.The construction of water projects and railroads during the later part of the 19th century increased the immigration of Catholic Irish and German immigrants into North Texas. 

Sacred Heart parish was dedicated in Dallas in 1869, the first parish in that city.  The parishioners erected their church in 1872. Six Ursuline nuns in 1874 opened the Ursuline Academy of Dallas, the first Catholic school in Dallas.

In Fort Worth, the first Catholic church, St. Stanislaus Kostka, was opened in 1879.

1890 to 1894 
Pope Leo XIII erected the Diocese of Dallas on July 15, 1890, taking its territory from the Diocese of Galveston. The Diocese of Dallas at its inception included most of northern and central Texas. The pope appointed Monsignor Thomas Brennan of the Diocese of Erie as the first bishop of the new diocese. 

Wanting to retire the diocesan debt, Brennan tried to use the Ursuline Academy of Dallas as collateral property to the banks for better financing. However, the Ursuline Sisters objected, saying that the property belonged to them, not the diocese. Brennan then tried to change the Ursuline Order constitution to allow him to get the academy property, but failed.

Some priests and laity in the diocese said that Brennan was embezzling diocese funds for his personal use. The Texas Catholic was accused by Brennan's priests of being a publication "whose sole reason for existence seemed to be...to praise the bishop and his vicar general." Brennan lobbied the Vatican to raised the Diocese of Dallas to an archdiocese. In a letter pleading his cause to the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith in Rome, he argued for the elevation of Dallas versus the predominantly Hispanic Diocese of San Antonio. Brennan warned that elevating San Antonio would lead to the "foreignization of the Southwest."

By July 1892, Brennan's metropolitan superior, Archbishop Francis Janssens of the Archdiocese of New Orleans, had concluded that Brennan was "an impudent letter writer". Janssens also noted that within the Diocese of Dallas "there are signs of much dissatisfaction on account of the arbitrary and uncanonical actions of the Bishop." During an 1892 visit to the Vatican, Leo XIII forced Brennan to resign as bishop in Dallas. At the time of his resignation, the Catholic population of the diocese had grown to 15,000 served by 30 priests.

1894 to 1954 
Leo XIII named Reverend Edward Dunne from the Diocese of Chicago as the second bishop of Dallas in 1894.  Dunne completed the construction of the diocesan cathedral, which was described as "admittedly the finest in the South-Western States". Dunne also opened Holy Trinity College in Irving. He established St. Paul Sanitarium in Dallas and St. Anthony's Sanitarium in Amarillo. By 1908, the diocese had 83 priests serving an estimated Catholic population of 60,000. By the time that Dunn died in 1910, the number of churches in the diocese had increased from 28 to 90.

Monsignor Joseph Lynch of Dallas was the third bishop of the diocese, named by Pope Pius X in 1911. During the Mexican Revolution, Lynch became an advocate on behalf of Catholic Mexican refugees displaced to Dallas. In 1914, the Vatican erected the Diocese of El Paso in West Texas, taking territory from the Diocese of Dallas.  Lynch erected the first mission church in the diocese in Dallas for Mexican Americans in 1915.

In 1926, the Vatican erected the Diocese of Amarillo, taking the Texas Panhandle region from the Diocese of Dallas. Lynch built a segregated church for African American Catholics at Fort Worth in 1929. Bishop Thomas Gorman from the Diocese of Reno was named coadjutor bishop in Dallas by Pope Pius XII in 1952 to assist Lynch.  

In 1953, Pius XII renamed the Diocese of Dallas as the Diocese of Dallas–Fort Worth to reflect the population growth in Fort Worth. He also erected the Diocese of Austin in central Texas, taking some territory from Dallas-Fort Worth.

When Lynch died in 1954, after 43 years as bishop, the Diocese of Dallas-Fort Worth had over 200 religious and charitable institutions founded by him. During his episcopacy, the Catholic population in the diocese had increased from 20,000 to 125,000. Lynch ordained over 100 priests and established 150 churches with 108 parishes.

1954 to present 
After Lynch's death, Gorman automatically succeeded him as bishop of the Diocese of Dallas-Fort Worth. Gorman revived the Texas Catholic newspaper, which had been suspended since 1894. He constructed 25 parochial schools and erected 20 new parishes.  In 1969, the Vatican separated the Diocese of Dallas-Fort Worth into the Diocese of Dall and the Diocese of Fort Worth.

Bishop Thomas Tschoepe from San Angelo was appointed by Pope Paul VI in 1969 as bishop of the new Diocese of Dallas.  In 1989, the Vatican erected the Diocese of Tyler, taking eastern counties from the Diocese of Dallas. Pope John Paul II in 1989 appointed Bishop Charles Grahmann from the Diocese of Victoria to serve as a coadjutor bishop in Dallas to assist Tschoepe,  When Tschoepe retired in 1990, Grahmann automatically succeeded him as bishop. 

During his tenure in Dallas, Grahmann created new parishes for Hispanic, Vietnamese and other Catholics moving into the diocese. He also opened the John Paul II High School in Plano. By the time Grahmann retired in 2007, the Catholic population had expanded from 200,000 to nearly a million.

The next bishop of Dallas was Auxiliary Bishop Kevin Farrell from the Archdiocese of Washington, appointed by Pope Benedict XVI in 2007. In 2010, Benedict XVI named Reverend J. Douglas Deshotel and Monsignor Mark J. Seitz as auxiliary bishops of the diocese. In 2016, Bishop Farrell was named prefect of the Dicastery for the Laity, Family and Life in Rome. Pope Francis in 2016 named Bishop Edward J. Burns from the Diocese of Juneau as Farrell's replacement.

Sex abuse 
Bishop Tschoepe attended a presentation at Holy Trinity Seminary in Dallas by Reverend Paul Shanley from the Archdiocese of Boston.  During the presentation, Shanley spoke of the positive effects of sexual relations between adult males and teenagers.In February 2005, Shanley was convicted in Massachusetts of indecent assaults and statutory rape; he received a sentence of 12 to 15 years in state prison.  Shanley was laicized by the Vatican in 2004.

In 1993, the diocese  was sued by eight men and the family of a ninth man who had committed suicide.  The plaintiffs said they were abused as altar boys by Reverend Rudolph Kos, who served in several parishes. In April 1992, a therapist had told diocese officials that Kos was a "classic textbook pedophile". However, the diocese allowed Kos to remain in ministry. He abused another child 11 months later. Bishop Grahmann testified in 1997 that he had never read the therapist's report and allowed Kos to continue his ministry.  In 1997, a jury awarded $120 million to the nine plaintiffs. In 1998, Kos was convicted of three counts of aggravated sexual assault and sentenced to life in prison. The diocese appealed the civil lawsuit, but agreed to settle it in 1998, paying $23.4 million to the plaintiffs. Grahmann made this statement:"To the victims and their families, I once again want to apologize on behalf of the diocese. Based on what we know now, the decisions made concerning Rudy Kos were errors in human judgment. I regret very much what happened, and I am deeply sorry for your pain." In April 2020, the diocese announced the removal of Reverend Oscar Mora, a visiting priest from the Archdiocese of Villavicencio, from ministry in Dallas. The archdiocese had informed Dallas that Mora was facing sexual abuse allegations in Colombia.
