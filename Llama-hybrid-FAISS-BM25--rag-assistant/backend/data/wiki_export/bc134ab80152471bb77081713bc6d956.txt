The Requiem of Reconciliation was a collaborative work written to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. It sets the Catholic mass for the dead in fourteen sections, each written by a different composer from a country involved in the war. It was commissioned by the Internationale Bachakademie Stuttgart in Stuttgart, Germany, and first performed by the Gächinger Kantorei, the Kraków Chamber Choir and the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Helmuth Rilling. A two-CD set documenting this performance was released in 1995.
