Album 1700 is the seventh studio album by American folk music trio Peter, Paul and Mary, released in 1967. It produced the band's most successful and final hit, a recording of the John Denver song "Leaving on a Jet Plane". The album peaked at number 15 on Billboard magazine's Top LP chart and was nominated for a Grammy Award in the Best Folk Performance category. Album 1700 was so named because its original LP issue was Warner Bros. Records catalog number W-1700 for the mono version and WS-1700 for the stereo version. It stayed on the charts and rose again in 1969, thanks to the single release of "Leaving on a Jet Plane".

The song "I'm in Love with a Big Blue Frog" was written by Leslie Braunstein, who was the original lead singer of Soft White Underbelly, the band that became Blue Öyster Cult. The song was later adapted into a children's book and recorded by Will Ryan and Phil Baron on the Disney children's album Goin' Quackers.

Cover art 
The cover is styled after one of the promotional photographs for the movie Bonnie and Clyde that showed the gang holding machine guns. It was taken at 70 Bedford Street, Greenwich Village, New York City.
