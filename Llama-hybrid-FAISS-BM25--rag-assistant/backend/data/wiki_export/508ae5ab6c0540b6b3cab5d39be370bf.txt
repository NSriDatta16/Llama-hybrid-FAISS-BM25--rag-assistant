Renegade Press was an American comic book company, founded by Canadian Deni Loubert, that operated from 1984 to 1988. Notable titles published by Renegade included Flaming Carrot, Ms. Tree, and normalman.

History
Loubert was publisher of Aardvark-Vanaheim until she and husband Dave Sim (owner and major contributor to Aardvark-Vanaheim) divorced, at which point she started Renegade and moved to the United States. With the move, all of Aardvark-Vanaheim's titles (with the exception of Cerebus) left that publisher to continue with Renegade. These included Flaming Carrot Comics, normalman, Neil the Horse, and Ms. Tree.

Although Renegade started in high-profile fashion, its titles suffered from low print runs. In early 1988, Renegade refit its publishing strategy, but suspended all publications later that year. In July 1989 the publisher was shut down for good.
