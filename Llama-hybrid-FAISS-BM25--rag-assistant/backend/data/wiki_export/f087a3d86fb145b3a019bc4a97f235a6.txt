Ty Taylor (born January 5, 1969, in Montclair, New Jersey) is an American musician best known for being the lead singer of Los Angeles soul rock band Vintage Trouble. He is the voice of character Lester Grimes on the HBO series Vinyl created by Martin Scorsese and Mick Jagger.  Taylor has two songs, "Cha Cha Twist" and "The World Is Yours," featured on the 2016 soundtrack album Vinyl: Music from the HBO Original Series, Volume 1. He was formerly the guitarist and vocalist of R&B group Dakota Moon and was also a contestant on the reality TV show Rock Star: INXS.

Music career
Gospel music was a significant influence on Taylor, having sung in a Baptist Church choir in his youth. Other musical influences include Otis Redding, Tina Turner and The Clash.

After leaving Rockstar: INXS, he was asked by Dave Navarro to sing guest lead vocals for his band Camp Freddy. In 2008, he formed the group Ghost Hounds and recorded a debut album, two songs from which were released as downloadable content for the video game Rock Band 2.

He has toured with many artists including Tina Turner, Eric Clapton, Macy Gray, Fiona Apple, and Robert Taylor.

Taylor appeared on the cast recording of Jason Robert Brown's Songs for a New World recorded in 1996.

Taylor also appeared as a guest singer on the bonus album given away with Shout, recorded by Govt Mule, on the song "Bring on the Music." Other guests included Steve Winwood, Elvis Costello, and Dr. John.

Most recently, Taylor has been the front man for the Los Angeles soul rock band Vintage Trouble. Notable performances include a supporting performance at the final concert of the annual free Summer Concert Series at The Americana at Brand where Vintage Trouble opened for Paula Cole and Tyler Hilton, a headlining performance on the second stage of the California AIDS Walk (Taylor also performed Simon & Garfunkel's "Bridge Over Troubled Water" on the main stage at the same benefit), and their weekly Tuesday night residency at Harvelle's Blues Club in Santa Monica, California.

Vintage Trouble has supported rock acts like Lenny Kravitz, Joss Stone, Paloma Faith, the Dixie Chicks, The Who, Bon Jovi and AC/DC on the 2015 Rock or Bust World Tour.
