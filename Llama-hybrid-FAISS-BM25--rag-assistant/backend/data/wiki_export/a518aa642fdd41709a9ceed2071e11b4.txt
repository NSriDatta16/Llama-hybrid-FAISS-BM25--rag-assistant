Critical reception
Jon Young, in Trouser Press, wrote that "backed by hard, unadorned beats from ace producer Marley Marl, [Intelligent Hoodlum] leads a furious chant against racism in 'No Justice, No Peace' and bristles with righteous anger on 'Black and Proud.'" In an article titled "The 10 Best Forgotten New York Hip-Hop Records," The Village Voice wrote: "Skeletal, smart, politically literate and seemingly effortless, Intelligent Hoodlumâ€™s (a/k/a Tragedy Khadafi) debut is the stuff of conscious hip-hop dreams."
