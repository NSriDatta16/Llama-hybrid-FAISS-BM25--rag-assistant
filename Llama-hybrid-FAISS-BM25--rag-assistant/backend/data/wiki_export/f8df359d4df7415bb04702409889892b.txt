Cemetery chapel
The foundation stone for the chapel was laid by the Lord Mayor of Sheffield, Harry P. Marsh J.P., on Friday 18 September 1908 at 12.30 pm. He was then presented with a silver trowel by the architects Messrs C. and C.M. Hadfield. The building is constructed from locally quarried stone from the Rivelin Valley, while the dressings around the windows, the tracery and doorways are in Bath stone from the Monk's Park quarry in Corsham, Wiltshire. The roof is covered with heavy slates from the Buttermere Green Slate Company in Cumbria while the mortuary aisle is roofed with arched ribs and slabs from Stuart's Granolithic Stone Co. Ltd. in Edinburgh. The chapel ceiling is groin vaulted while the floor is of terrazzo and wood. Messrs Hadfield's design was carried out by the building contractors D. O'Neill and Son, with C. Heywood as clerk of works. The chapel was Grade II listed in 1995.
