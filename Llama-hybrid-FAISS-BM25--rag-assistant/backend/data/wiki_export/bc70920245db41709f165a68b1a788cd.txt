Church history

Mylor was in medieval times in the episcopal manor and peculiar deanery of Penryn and was also the mother church of Mabe. In 1277 there was a dispute between the Bishop of Exeter and the Earl of Cornwall over sand and soil which was being carried away from the glebe land of Mylor by agents of the Earl. In 1278 this was settled by the Bishop lifting the threat of excommunication he had made and redistributing the large sum of money he had collected as custom duty for the sand and soil. Bishop Peter Quinel gave the church and church land to the provostship of Glasney College in exchange for the deanery of Probus in 1288.

The feast days of St Melorus of Mylor are 3 January, 1 October and 25 October (Mylor feast used to be on 28 August but was transferred to the Sunday nearest 25 October).

Present day

Mylor Parish Church (Anglican) is in Mylor Churchtown and is dedicated to St Melorus. The present structure dates from a major reconstruction around 1870 but parts of the original church dated back to the Norman period and the church still has a Norman north door.

There were also Wesleyan Methodist and Primitive Methodist chapels in Mylor parish.

Customs
A mummers play text which had, until recently, been attributed to Mylor (much quoted in early studies of folk plays, such as The Mummers Play by R. J. E. Tiddy – published posthumously in 1923 – and The English Folk-Play (1933) by E. K. Chambers) has now been shown, by genealogical and other research, to have originated in Truro, around 1780.
