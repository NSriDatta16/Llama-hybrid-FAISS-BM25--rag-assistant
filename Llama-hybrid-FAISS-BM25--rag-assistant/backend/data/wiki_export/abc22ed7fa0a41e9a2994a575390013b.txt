Roger Williams Park is an elaborately landscaped  city park in Providence, Rhode Island and a historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  It is named after Roger Williams, the founder of the city of Providence and the primary founder of the state of Rhode Island.

History
The land for the park was a gift to the people of Providence in 1872, in accordance with the will of Betsey Williams, the last descendant of Roger Williams to inherit his land. It had been the family farm and was the last of the original land granted to Roger Williams in 1638 by Canonicus, chief of the Narragansett tribe. The family farmhouse was built in 1773 and is now known as the Betsey Williams Cottage; the cottage and the Williams family burial ground (including Betsey's grave) are still maintained within the park.

The original bequest consisted of about 100 acres. Additional land to the south was purchased in 1891 at a cost of $359,000, consisting mostly of unimproved land that was covered with woods and ponds; it brought the total area of the park to about 400 acres. The natural history museum opened in 1895.

Roger Williams Speedway

From at least 1915 to about 1949, the park contained a half-mile racetrack that ran from Elmwood Avenue to Broad Street. The track normally hosted harness races; it was a particularly popular Fourth of July attraction. In 1924 it was the site of an army hurdle race.

2016 renovations
The Rhode Island Foundation began a renovation effort in the park in 2016 as a celebration of their centennial, beginning with the park's historic bandstand in December 2016. The renovations will expand to other park buildings and entrances. In June 2017, a dedicated bike and pedestrian lane was added to Frederick Green Memorial Boulevard as part of these renovations, although this change was opposed by some Cranston residents, including Cranston mayor Allan Fung.

Gateway visitor center

In Fall 2022, a Gateway and Visitor Center for the park opened on Broad Street. Designed by INFORM studio, the center is intended to increase community access to the park. The center provides information about public events, amenities, and services in Roger Williams Park and in the surrounding neighborhood.
