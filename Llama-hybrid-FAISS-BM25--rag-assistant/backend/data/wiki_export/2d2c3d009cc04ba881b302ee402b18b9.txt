"We Are" is a song by the Swedish rock singer Ana Johnsson from her worldwide debut album, The Way I Am. The song was released as her first worldwide single and the first from the album in June 2004. It was also included on the soundtrack for Spider-Man 2. "We Are" remains Johnsson's highest-charting hit, becoming a top-10 hit in Austria, Denmark, Italy, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.

Music video
The music video was shot in Los Angeles at the Nate Starkman & Son building (Pan Pacific Warehouse), and it was directed by Antti Jokinen. The video mixes clips from Spider-Man 2 with a romantic scenario involving Ana Johnsson and a man from the apartment next door. To convey the intensity of Johnsson's performance, the producer created an effect where the loudness of the music seems to cause the furnishings of the man's apartment to slide across the floor.
