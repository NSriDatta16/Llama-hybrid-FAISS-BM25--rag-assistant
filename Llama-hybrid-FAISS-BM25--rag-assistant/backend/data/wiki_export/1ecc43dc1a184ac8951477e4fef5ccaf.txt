Yangra (Ganesh I) is the highest peak of the Ganesh Himal, 
which is a subrange of the Himalayan mountain range. Although not an 8,000 metre peak, and little visited, it enjoys great vertical relief over the nearby valleys. 


Location
Ganesh I (Yangra), and the entire Ganesh Himal, lie between the Budhi Gandaki and Trisuli Gandaki valleys, northwest of Kathmandu. Yangra lies on the border between Nepal and Tibet, and is east-southeast of Manaslu, the nearest 8,000  meter peak.

Climbing history
The Ganesh Himal was first seriously reconnoitered for climbing by H. W. Tilman and party in 1950. The first attempt on the peak was in 1953.

The first ascent, in 1955, was by a Franco-Swiss expedition led by Raymond Lambert, via the Southeast Face and Ridge. The ascent was most notable for the presence of a woman, Claude Kogan, in the summit party, which was very rare at the time. Lambert, Kogan, and Eric Gauchat achieved the summit, but Gauchat fell to his death on the descent.

The Himalayan Index lists no other ascents of Yangra, 
although a 1960 attempt reached the East Peak of the mountain.
