Kilbatti (Kilbat) Rasu, also known as Administrative Zone 2, is one of the five zones in the Afar Region of Ethiopia. This zone is bordered on the south by Awsi Rasu, on the southwest by Fantí Rasu, on the west by the Tigray Region, and on the north by Eritrea. The administrative center of Kilbet Rasu is Abala (also known in the highlands as Shiket). Also located in this zone is the former mining settlement of Dallol, which set the record for the hottest inhabited place on Earth, with an average temperature of 34 °C.

History 
Prior to the adoption of the 1995 constitution, a portion of this Zone (particularly the northern part) was part of Tigray Province. As a result, a UNDP mission visiting the Zone described it as "the most isolated zone of the Afar National Regional State", at the time showing signs of "suffered heavily from bombardment (from the Ethiopian Civil War), as well as from general neglect. Much of the remaining infrastructure dates from the Haile Selassie era." 

At the time the UNDP visited, they observed two major socio-political issues in the Zone. The first was a smoldering conflict between the Afar Revolutionary Democratic Unity Front (ARDUF) and government forces. The ARDUF conducted sporadic attacks on government military forces and officials and competed for control of the salt trade. In response, the military closed markets at Berhale, Garamoyti, Gaharta, ‘Ala, Mergis and Dande, and schools in at least three woredas. The second was the continued influx of rural Afar, primarily nomads, from Eritrea. These new arrivals claimed to be fleeing the Eritrean government's recent enforcement of its National Service programme and a parallel agenda of disarmament. Despite a lack of external assistance, these refugees were given assistance and shelter due to clan ties between them and the locals.
