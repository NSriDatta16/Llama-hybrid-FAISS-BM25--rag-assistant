The Canton City School District (CCSD) is a public school district serving students in Canton, Ohio in the United States. In the 2020–2021 academic year its student enrollment was 8,000, making it the 22nd largest school district in the state. The district operates an early childhood center, twelve elementary schools, three middle schools and two 9–12 high schools. In addition to traditional schools, CCSD also operates four alternative schools. While the district primarily serves students in Canton city limits, they also serve small sections of surrounding areas, as well as the village of Meyers Lake. Students in the northern part of the city go to the Plain Local School District instead of the Canton City district.

History

In 2023, the superintendent submitted a proposal to make it so that students who had missed classes have to fulfill extra criteria to get credit for those classes.
