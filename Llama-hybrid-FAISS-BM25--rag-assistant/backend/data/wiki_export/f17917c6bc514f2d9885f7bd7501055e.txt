Killikaike is an extinct genus of New World monkey. The genus includes one species, Killikaike blakei, that lived in Argentina during the Early Miocene.

Killikaike blakei was collected from the Santa Cruz Formation in the far south of Argentina in January, 2005 and the type specimen consists of a remarkably well preserved face.  The neurocranium is not present. The specimen was named for the locality where it was found Killik Aike Norte, on the estate of the Blake family.

Perry et al. (2014) considered K. blakei to be a junior synonym of Homunculus patagonicus, which is also known from the Santa Cruz Formation. However, Silvestro at al. (2017) considered Killikaike to be a distinct genus. Kay & Perry (2019) continued to regard the species as synonymous.
