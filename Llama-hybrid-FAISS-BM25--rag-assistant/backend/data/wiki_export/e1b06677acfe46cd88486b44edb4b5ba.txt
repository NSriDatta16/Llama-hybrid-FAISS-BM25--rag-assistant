Seven Nations is an eponymous album released by Celtic rock band Seven Nations in 2000. It shares many of the same tracks as the band's previous release, The Pictou Sessions, and can be seen as an update of that album. It also functions as a greatest hits package, as it includes many of singer Kirk McLeod's compositions from previous releases, newly arranged for the band's revised lineup. It also contains the recording of "Twelve" from The Factory by the same lineup of the band, which was as follows:

Kirk McLeod: lead vocals, twelve string acoustic guitar, electric guitars, piano
Struby: bass guitars, vocals
Ashton Geoghagan: drums, vocals
Scott Long: highland bagpipes, electronic bagpipes, vocals
Dan Stacey: fiddle, vocals

This album was the last to feature Geoghagan, who was replaced by Christian "Crisco" Miceli.
