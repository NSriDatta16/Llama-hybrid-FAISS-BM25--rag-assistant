Wood End is a former Pit village in North Warwickshire, England. It lies to the south east of Tamworth and close to the border with Staffordshire. It grew around the former Kingsbury Colliery but now it serves as a commuter village to Tamworth. It has a church, a primary school, a co-operative store, a working men's club and a village hall. The population of Wood End is 2,205, but from the 2011 Census has been included in Kingsbury.

Name
The official name of the village is Wood End, from its founding in 1890, although it is sometimes written as Woodend. The name is derived from the village's position at the end of the nearby Kingsbury Wood, a pine plantation. Parts of the village are still known as Edge Hill. To avoid confusion with other Wood Ends the name of the nearby town, Atherstone is added. The name Wood End, North Warwickshire is sometimes used, but rarely, to avoid confusion with Wood End near Fillongley.

History
The land on which the village was built consisted of fields belonging to two farms, Delves Farm and Poplars Farm, both of which exist today. There were two woods, Edge Hill Wood and Smith's Wood, but only the former survives today.  There was also a small settlement of several houses called Edge Hill, and a United Free Methodist Chapel, which closed in the late 1970s. The first houses were built in 1890 to house workers for Kingsbury Colliery, which opened in 1897. A working men's club opened in 1905, and still remains open in the original building. Wood End became a village in 1906 with the opening of the parish church, St Michael & All Angels Church.

A village hall was later built in the 1960s. Also added to the housing stock was Glenville Avenue and Delves Crescent, which were council housing. In the late 1970s Birchfield Close was constructed for private housing, and the village was expanded in 1985 when a new estate, Pinewood Avenue, was built to the west. A school, Wood End Primary School, was opened in 1911. The original school building no longer exists. In 1995 the school was expanded. On 13 August 1998 the older part of the school burnt down, but it has since been rebuilt. During the village's expansion over the years, parts of the village, such as Glenville Avenue (laid out during the 1950s), steadily ate into the surrounding woodland.

Much of the village dates from the 1980s, with the old housing being demolished and replaced. The older housing stock remains on one side of Wood Street, on the Working Mens Club side of Tamworth road (at the top of Wood Street), on Johnson Street, and on part of Smith Street. The most recent addition to the residential area is Meadow View, completed in 2005, which was built on scrub land previously occupied by prefabs. One of the oldest houses from before it became Wood End, Edge Hill House, was demolished in 2019 for new homes, stood next to where the Methodist chapel was. The site can be seen on the 1884 Ordnance Survey County Series map for Warwickshire along with just a few others.
