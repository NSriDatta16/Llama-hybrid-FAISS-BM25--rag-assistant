The Rutland-1-2 Representative District is a two-member state Representative district in the U.S. state of Vermont.  It is one of the 108 one or two member districts into which the state was divided by the redistricting and reapportionment plan developed by the Vermont General Assembly following the 2000 U.S. Census.  The plan applies to legislatures elected in 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2010.  A new plan will be developed in 2012 following the 2010 U.S. Census.

The Rutland-1-2 District includes all of the Rutland County towns of Clarendon, Proctor, and West Rutland, and the portion of the town of Ira not included in Rutland-1-1.

As of the 2000 census, the state as a whole had a population of 608,827.
