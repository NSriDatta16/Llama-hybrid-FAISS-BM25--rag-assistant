14P/Wolf is a periodic comet in the Solar System.

Max Wolf (Heidelberg, Germany) discovered the comet on September 17, 1884 () before it passed 0.8 AU from Earth.. It was later discovered by, but not credited to, Ralph Copeland (Dun Echt Observatory, Aberdeen, Scotland) on September 23.

Before approaching Jupiter in 1875, the comet had a perihelion of 2.74 AU and an orbital period of 8.84 years, and the approach dropped perihelion to 1.57 AU. An approach to Jupiter in September 1922 lifted perihelion to 2.43 AU. The current perihelion of 2.7 AU is from when the comet passed Jupiter on August 13, 2005. Another close approach to Jupiter on March 10, 2041 will return the comet to parameters similar to the period 1925–2000.

The comet nucleus is estimated to be 4.7 kilometers in diameter.
