A radio variety program titled College Humor aired on the NBC Red radio network on Tuesday nights in 1941, sponsored by the Raleigh Tobacco and Cigarettes division of the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company. It shared the same timeslot placement to the Raleigh-sponsored, Red Skelton-led Raleigh Cigarette Program, contemporary schedules show. Produced mainly by college students and young comedians, the show focused on "the traditional hi-jinks which purportedly and really transpire on a college campus," according to a review in Movie-Radio Guide. Emceed by Tom Wallace with the Bob Strong orchestra, it featured comedians including Marlin Hurt, Franklyn MacCormack, Eddie Firestone and Linn Borden, as well as singers Virginia Verrill and Mary Ann Mercer.
