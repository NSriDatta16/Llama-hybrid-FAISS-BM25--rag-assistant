Facilities
Trinity School at Greenlawn occupies part of a complex of buildings initially named Elm Court, site of the   home of Clement Studebaker, Jr., and his family. Studebaker sold the property to Vincent Bendix. Bendix never resided in the mansion, preferring to live in Chicago, but he renovated parts of the building. In the late 1940s the Sisters of St. Joseph of the Third Order of St. Francis purchased the site for use as their motherhouse. The sisters preserved the original mansion, with renovations, and added a new three-story building adjacent to the mansion with a chapel, classrooms and residence space for the order's members. When their ministries shifted geographically away from Indiana, the sisters relocated their motherhouse. The People of Praise community acquired the property in August, 1982, for dual use by Trinity School and by the community's international headquarters. At that point the school became known as Trinity School at Greenlawn, with reference to the address on Greenlawn Avenue. Though there is some overlap, People of Praise offices are situated in the original mansion, and Trinity School leases space in the parts of the building constructed by the sisters.
