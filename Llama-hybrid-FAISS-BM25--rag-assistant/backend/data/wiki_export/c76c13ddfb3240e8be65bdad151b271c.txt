The first season presented 12 distinct stories over the course of 13 episodes. One of the stories (Agua Bendita) had two parts.

The second season likewise had 12 distinct stories but had 15 episodes, because three of the stories (Inday sa Balitaw, Bampy, and Si Pardina at mga Duwende) had two parts each.

The third and fourth season of Komiks breaks from the pattern of the first two seasons, with the entire season devoted to a single series, Da Adventures of Pedro Penduko. Matt Evans of Pinoy Big Brother: Teen Edition 1 starred in the title role. A sequel Pedro Penduko at ang Mga Engkantao starred an ensemble cast.

After the much successful airing of Pedro Penduko series, Komiks resumed airing in 2008 for a sixth season with a collection of works from Mars Ravelo, with Kapitan Boom as its first offering. This was followed by Varga, Tiny Tony, Dragonna and Flash Bomba.

A horror drama series Nasaan Ka Maruja?, based on the 1950s comic by Mars Ravelo, aired in 2009.
