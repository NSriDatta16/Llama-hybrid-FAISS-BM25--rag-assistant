Rugby union: 2006 Super 14 Final
 Crusaders 19, Hurricanes 12: The Crusaders win the first Super 14 title after beating the Hurricanes in a game that was dampened by the conditions. Thick fog covered the ground close to an hour before kick off and despite talks to delay or postpone the game, the final went ahead as scheduled.

While the fog overshadowed the game itself, the Crusaders completely dominated territory and possession throughout the match. Much of the game was decided on penalties before Casey Laulala dived over late in the second half for the first try of the match and gave the Crusaders a seven point advantage and secured their sixth Super Rugby title.

West Ham take a 2-goal lead in the first half, through an own goal from Jamie Carragher and Dean Ashton before Djibril Cissé brings it back to 2–1 at half time. Steven Gerrard scores the equaliser in the 53rd minute, then defender Paul Konchesky puts West Ham back in the lead ten minutes later, with a cross-come-shot. But in the 91st minute, Gerrard scores a sensational goal, a well-hit 35-yard drive, worthy of levelling any football match. Extra time produced no goals, so it was onto penalties, and Liverpool's Pepe Reina is the hero, saving 3 of West Ham's 4 penalties from Bobby Zamora, Konchesky and Anton Ferdinand, to give Liverpool their 7th FA Cup, and their first since 2001.

Ryan McGuffie took the penalty, but was expertly saved by goalkeeper Craig Gordon, but he couldn't hold onto it, and McGuffie scored the rebound. Then in the last minute of extra time, Paul Hartley kicked out at Gretna defender Derek Townsley which earned him a 2nd yellow and he had to watch the shootout from the sidelines. Hearts scored all 4 of their penalties from Steven Pressley, Robbie Neilson, Skácel and Michal Pospíšil, while Gretna only scored 2 with 2 misses (Gavin Skelton – hit the bar & Townsley – saved by Gordon).
