S. Scott Crump (born Steven Scott Crump) is the inventor of fused deposition modeling (FDM) and co-founder of Stratasys, Ltd.  Crump invented and patented FDM technology in 1989 with his wife and Stratasys co-founder Lisa Crump.  He is currently the chairman of the board of directors of Stratasys, which produces additive manufacturing machines for direct digital manufacturing (a.k.a. rapid manufacturing); these machines are popularly called “3D printers.” He took the manufacturing company public in 1994 (Nasdaq:SSYS). He also runs Fortus, RedEye on Demand, and Dimension Printing – business units of Stratasys.

Crump managed the early work on another innovation used by FDM machines, the ABS plastic filament, which allows engineers to formulate fully functional parts that have up to 75% of the strength of an actual molded part. In addition, Crump is responsible for other innovations, including: Breakaway Support System (BASS), WaterWorks Support System, the coupling to the CAD/CAM industry for CNC tool path software, a baffled oven for high-temperature build environments and a benchtop 3D Printer (Dimension).

Philanthropy

Through Stratasys, Crump has provided financial support to the SME Bright Minds Mentor Program, affording opportunities for high school students to attend the annual Society of Manufacturing Education (SME) RAPID Conference and Exposition. Stratasys has also donated 3D printers to schools participating in the RAPID event.

Awards and accolades

Crump was ranked among the best CEOs in the United States by DeMarche Associates in 2007.
In addition, he has received the following awards and accolades:
 Winner of the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award, 2005.
 Voted one of the top five most influential individuals in rapid product development and rapid manufacturing by Time-Compression Technologies, European edition, TCT Top 25 Influential People survey, 2007.
 Finalist, Minnesota High Tech Association Tekne Awards
 Inducted into the TCT Hall of Fame in September 2017.
