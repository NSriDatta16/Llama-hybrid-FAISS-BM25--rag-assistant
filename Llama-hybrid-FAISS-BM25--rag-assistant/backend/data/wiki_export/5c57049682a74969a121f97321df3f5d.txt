Snakes and Ladders is the fifth studio album by Frank Tovey. The 1986 release was the first album credited under his own name as opposed to Fad Gadget, used for his first four albums.

The original North American vinyl release featured the track "Collapsing New People" from the 1984 Fad Gadget album Gag. This track was not included on subsequent CD releases. However, versions of the original vinyl album in some territories included an additional EP featuring four other previously released Fad Gadget tracks (one from each album, though "Collapsing New People" not among them), and these tracks were used on CD releases, along with the single B-sides "Bed of Nails" and "Clean This Act Up".
