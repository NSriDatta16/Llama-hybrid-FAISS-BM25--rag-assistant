Ronald Andrew Sedlbauer (born October 22, 1954) is a former professional ice hockey left winger who played seven seasons in the National Hockey League.

Hockey career
Sedlbauer was drafted 23rd overall by the Vancouver Canucks in the 1974 NHL amateur draft. He played 430 career NHL games, scoring 143 goals and 86 assists for 229 points. He also shares the modern-day record, along with Rick Nash, for fewest assists in a 40+ goal season. Sedlbauer scored 40 goals in the 1978–79 season, but only registered 16 assists. He held the record for 26 seasons until Nash tied it in the 2003–04 NHL season by scoring 41 goals and only 16 assists. After appearing in 32 games with ten goals and four assists to start the 1979–80 campaign, he was dealt from the Canucks to the Chicago Black Hawks for Dave Logan and Harold Phillipoff on December 21. His contract was purchased from the Black Hawks by the Toronto Maple Leafs on February 18, 1981. The transaction was the Maple Leafs' attempt to bolster its winger positions after injuries to Dan Maloney and René Robert.

Life
Ron attended Burlington Central High School from 1968 to 1972. He was a member of the Halton junior football championship team in 1971. Ron also qualified for the O.F.S.A.A. track and field championships in the shot put event. Ron was thrilled to receive an honorary athletic letter from the school the year he graduated.

Ron spent most of his youth playing hockey for the City of Burlington. He was drafted by the Hamilton Red Wings Jr. A hockey club while a member of the Burlington midget city rep team. After two and a half years with Hamilton, Ron was traded to the Kitchener Rangers, where he scored his only Jr. A hat trick; during his last game in junior; on his last ever shift.

Ron now lives in Burlington with his wife Sue, and his son, Brendon. He is currently the vice-president of Cougar Shoes Inc., and president of the Burlington Cougars Jr. A hockey club.
