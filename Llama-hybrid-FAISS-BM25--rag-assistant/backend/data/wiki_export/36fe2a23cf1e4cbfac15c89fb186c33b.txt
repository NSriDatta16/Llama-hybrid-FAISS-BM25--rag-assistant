Purple and Brown is a British stop-motion animated short series made in collaboration with Nickelodeon and Aardman Animations, the creators of Wallace and Gromit. The series was devised and directed by Rich Webber and edited by Mike Percival, who also offered the voices of the characters, and first aired in February 2006, on Nickelodeon's UK and Ireland channel, and then later became a staple on the US Nickelodeon network as part of its former Nick Extra short program.

Background
The series was devised and was directed by Webber and edited by Percival, who also offer the voices of the characters. The series was originally set to launch on 13 February 2006, on Nickelodeon's channel in the United Kingdom. Despite the series conclusion in 2007, its 7-minute special, titled Space was made back in 2009 but left unaired.

Purple and Brown is a creation of Aardman, who animated Wallace and Gromit, Creature Comforts, Angry Kid and Morph.

Storyline
The storyline is led by the characters of two clay blob friends, one is purple and the other brown, who get caught in ridiculous situations. Purple and Brown never speak, but they understand everything. Despite any given predicament, the duo can never help but giggle with a low, recognisable laugh.

Reception
In 2007, Cartoon Brew offered a mild criticism of Aardman's recent work, but wrote that Purple and Brown marked "a wonderful return to their roots", and that the concept is "beautifully animated and hilariously executed".
