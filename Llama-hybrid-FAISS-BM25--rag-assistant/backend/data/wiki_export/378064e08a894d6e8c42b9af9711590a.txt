Life 
Alejandro Lozano was born in La Toba, Guadalajara, Spain. He studied humanities at the El Pardo Seminary (Madrid, Spain) from 1951 to 1957. On 13 March 1965 he received ordination. During 1965-1969 studied at the Conservatori Municipal d’Arts Massana (Applied Arts School) of Barcelona, where he attained the Applied Arts Graduate grade, with a specialization in painting, mural and refurbishment proceedings. Being a Capuchin brother he lived at the Pompeia cloister in Barcelona.
During July and August 1966, he attended the courses ‘Corsi estivi di Pintura en la Scola di Belli Arti Prieto Vanucci’ in Perugia (Italy). This same year he entered the Fine Arts University of Barcelona (Escola Superior de Belles Arts Sant Jordi).
During 1968 he attended courses ‘Corso de alta cultura’ at the ‘Università Italiana per etranieri’ in Perugia, Italy, and had the exhibition ‘Mostra in Centro Internazionale’ (Crocevia).

Between 1970 and 1972, he finished "Good News", a mosaic mural (10x2 m) for the altarpiece of the church at Ciutat Residencial de E. i D. in Marbella (Málaga, Spain). The curved surface of the mural adapts to the wall in an embracing gesture.

From 1972 through 1974, he realizes the big format work "Calvary" (9x5 m). It is a mosaic placed at the major altar in the Cathedral of Tucupita (Delta Amacuro, Venezuela). Simultaneously he made the mosaics "Saint Francis and Brother Sun" (15 m2), for the right side nave of this cathedral, and "Divina Pastora" (15 m2), for the link side nave.

During the period 1973-1974, he finished the Drawing Teaching courses at the Fine Arts University (Escola Superior de Belles Arts) in Barcelona. He obtains the Drawing Teacher certificate, which allows him to widen his teaching activity that started already long ago.

From 1975 through 1978, he produced the murals "Annuntiation", "Catequesis", "Baptism in the mission", "Christ and the Samaritan" (3x2 m2) and "Christ’s Baptism " for Tucupita’s Cathedral façade. "Santa Cecilia", "Saint Francis trusted by an angel", "Saint Pius X" and "Saint Toribio de Mogrovejo", are round mosaic murals for the choir and central nave of the cathedral.

In May 1975, Lozano received the papal dispensation and married Francisca Tormo in Esparreguera (Catalonia, Spain).

From November to October 1978, he undertook his second travel to Venezuela and carried on the ensemble of the façade, choir and central nave murals of Tucupita’s Cathedral.

In July 1981, he graduated from the University of Barcelona with a degree in Fine Arts.

On 26 September, 1982, Tucupita's Cathedral was inaugurated, and was attended by several Bishops and the president of the Venezuelan Republic.

Later on his life, Lozano continued his artistic mural and painting works, working as a painting and drawing teacher in Barcelona. He died in Barcelona on March 30, 2003, aged 63.
