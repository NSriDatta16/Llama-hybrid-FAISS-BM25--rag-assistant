The Škoda Roomster ('Type 5J) is a small family car manufactured and marketed by Škoda Auto from 2006 to 2015 over a single generation with a single intermediate facelift. It has a five-door, five passenger, front-engine, front-wheel drive, high-roof design and has been described as a hatchback, an estate car, or a multi-purpose vehicle. Styled by Thomas Ingenlath and Peter Wouda, the Roomster premiered at the 2006 Geneva Motor Show) as the first car marketed after Volkswagen Group's takeover of Skoda, sharing the A4 (PQ34) platform and components with the second generation Škoda Fabia.

Assembled at the Škoda factory in Kvasiny, Rychnov nad Kněžnou District, sales began in June 2006.  A five-door, two-seater panel van variant launched in March 2007 as the Škoda Praktik.In October 2015, development of the second generation Roomster begun, spy shots of the new Roomster were taken that month revealing that instead of designing a completely new model, the second generation Roomster was to be a rebadged Volkswagen Caddy. In December 2015, development of the second generation Roomster was scrapped so that they could focus on the upcoming Kodiaq mid-size crossover and another reason why development was cancelled is due to cost reasons, leaked images of the second generation Roomster without any camouflage were also spotted with an estimated 100 prototypes built before cancellation.

Overview

The Roomster is based on the concept car of the same name, announced in September 2003 at the Frankfurt Auto Show. The concept was slightly shorter –  against  – than the production model with a longer wheelbase –  against , and featured a single rear sliding door on the passenger side, which was replaced by two conventionally-hinged swinging rear doors.

The Roomster's cargo arrangement is marketed as VarioFlex, with 40–20–40 split rear seats that can move longitudinally or transversely (by removing the middle seat), recline up to 7°, fold forward — or be removed to form a flat load surface.  The load surface can raised or lowered .

At launch, the Škoda Roomster used four-stroke engines from the Volkswagen Group. Petrol engines included the multi valve inline three cylinder 1.2-litre, with power initially DIN rated at , but with launch of the second generation Fabia rated at , followed by the 1.4-litre and 1.6-litre inline four-cylinder EA111 engines, with power of  and  respectively. The 1.6-litre was also available with a tiptronic six-speed automatic transmission.

Diesel engine propulsion came from the inline three-cylinder 1.4 Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI), with two power levels, base at  and "sport" at . The top option was a four-cylinder 1.9 TDI, with .

The Roomster could combine standard body colours (both solid and metallic) with a white, black, or silver roof. An offroad-styled Scout trim level was introduced late 2006. A single piece panoramic sunroof is optional.

Facelift
A facelifted Roomster premiered at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show with a revised front fascia and fog lights. Inside, the facelift featured a revised steering wheel.  Headlights elements were revised with their housing.

1.2-litre TSI turbocharged petrol engines came as a replacement of the previous 1.4- and 1.6-litre MPI engines, providing significant improvements to fuel consumption and corresponding reductions in  emissions.

The Aisin automatic transmission previously used was also replaced with the seven speed dual-clutch Direct-Shift Gearbox (DSG) (optional on  1.2 TSi models), providing a reduction of over 30% in  emissions for the  automatic derivative (compared to the previous 1.6-litre). Diesel engines were updated to the common rail system and four valve technology.

The manufacturer's combined consumption for the Roomster GreenLine with brand new 55 kW, 1.2-litre, three cylinder diesel engine is 4.2 L/100 km, which is 109 g  per km.

The design of the Roomster Scout also evolved (front bumpers, front fog lights).
