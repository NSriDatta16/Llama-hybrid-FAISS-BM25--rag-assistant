Statistics

Historical airline jet service

During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the airport had scheduled passenger jet service to Seattle (SEA).  In 1979, Wien Air Alaska was operating nonstop flights to Seattle three days a week with Boeing 737-200 jetliners.  By 1981, Wien Air Alaska was flying daily direct Boeing 737-200 service to Seattle via an intermediate stop in Anchorage (ANC).  Wien then discontinued jet service into the airport and by 1984 was only flying nonstop service to Anchorage with all flights operated with commuter turboprop aircraft.

History
The airport was initially constructed by the US Army under Air Navigation Site Withdrawal No. 156 in 1941 with a 5,000' runway completed by the Civil Air Patrol in 1942. The first terminal building was constructed in 1952, north of the highway spur next to the cemetery.

During the Korean War era the US Air Force maintained jet fighters at the airport and provided maintenance via an agreement with the FAA. The USAF agreement ended in 1962, but the Air Force still retains four airport-adjacent tracts of land.

In 1963 2,000 acres encompassing the airport and lands were transferred to the City of Kenai by the FAA. The current terminal was built in 1966, with some remodeling in the '80s.

In 1973 an FAA control tower was added for increased safety and to permit additional equipment to use the facility.

In 1984 commercial flights to Seattle ended. Currently only commuter flights to Anchorage are scheduled.

The last large commercial jetliner landed in March, 2014, when a massive snow storm completely closed Anchorage International causing United Airlines Flight 1425 (a Boeing 737) from Chicago to be diverted to Kenai, staying overnight to allow the pilots to complete mandatory rest.
