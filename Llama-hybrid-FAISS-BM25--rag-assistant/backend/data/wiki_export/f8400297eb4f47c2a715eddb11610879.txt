Release history

Ritt Momney version

A cover of "Put Your Records On" was released by American indie rock solo project Ritt Momney (real name Jack Rutter) on 24 April 2020, originally independently through DistroKid and later re-released through Disruptor Records and Columbia Records.

The song became a sleeper hit after gaining popularity on the video sharing service TikTok in September 2020. Domestically, it peaked at number 30 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song also charted in the top 40 of 15 countries, and peaked in the top 10 in Australia and New Zealand.

Background
During Rutter's childhood, his mother often played Rae's recording of "Put Your Records On" while driving. He referred to the original as "one of the greatest pop songs of all time". He recorded "Put Your Records On" in the basement of his parents' home after experiencing a bout of depression brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Rutter said, "I couldn’t handle writing a depressing song...I started playing around with the idea of manifesting happiness instead of projecting my own sadness."

The cover gained traction after being used in a makeup video on TikTok by user Skiian, starting a trend on the platform.
