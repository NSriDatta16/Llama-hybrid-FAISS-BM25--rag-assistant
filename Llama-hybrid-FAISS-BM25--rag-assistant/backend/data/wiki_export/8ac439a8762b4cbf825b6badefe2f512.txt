The West Zone cricket team is a first-class cricket team that represents western India in the Duleep Trophy and Deodhar Trophy. It is a composite team of players from five first-class Indian teams from western India competing in the Ranji Trophy: Baroda, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Mumbai and Saurashtra. West Zone has the best track record of all the zones in the Duleep Trophy, as they have won the Trophy 17 times, similar to North Zone. This included four consecutive titles from 1961-62 through to the 1964-65 season, although the third of these were shared with South Zone. Playing against South Zone at the Rajiv Gandhi Stadium in the 2009-10 Duleep Trophy final, West Zone set a new first-class record for the highest fourth innings total to win a match, scoring 541-7.
