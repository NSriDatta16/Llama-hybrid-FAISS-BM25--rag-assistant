Professional
Zayner was drafted in the second round, 13th overall, of the 2006 MLS SuperDraft by the Columbus Crew, but saw no first-team games during the 2006 season due to injury.

He remained with D.C. United through the 2011 season. At season's end, the club declined his 2012 contract option and he entered the 2011 MLS Re-Entry Draft. Zayner was not selected in the draft and became a free agent.

Zayner signed with San Jose Earthquakes on 20 June 2012. On July 29, 2012, Zayner made his first appearance for the Earthquakes in a 1–1 draw with Chicago Fire.
