Pljeskavica (, ) is a Serbian grilled dish consisting of a mixture of spiced minced pork, beef and lamb meat. It is one of the national dishes of Serbia and is very popular in the neighbouring Balkan and former Yugoslavian countries of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo and Montenegro. It is a main course served with onions, kajmak (milk cream), beans, sometimes ajvar (relish), and urnebes (spicy cheese salad), either on plate with side dishes, or with lepinja (flatbread, as a type of hamburger). Recently, pljeskavica has gained popularity elsewhere in Europe and is served in a few speciality fast food restaurants in Germany, Sweden, and Austria. Varieties include the "Leskovac pljeskavica" (Leskovačka pljeskavica), very spicy with onions; "Šar pljeskavica" (Šarska pljeskavica), stuffed with kačkavalj cheese; "Hajduk pljeskavica" (Hajdučka pljeskavica), of beef mixed with smoked pork meat; and "Vranje pljeskavica" (Vranjanska pljeskavica).

Since 2008 the name "Leskovac pljeskavica" has been a legally protected term for pljeskavica from the Jablanica District of Serbia.
