Beasdale railway station is a railway station serving Glen Beasdale in the Highland region of Scotland. This station is on the West Highland Line, sited  from the former Banavie Junction, between Lochailort and Arisaig. ScotRail manage the station and operate all services.

History 

It was originally a private station for the nearby Arisaig House, and the station was thus originally opened on 1 April 1901, but was fully open to the public from 6 September 1965.

The former station building is now a private holiday cottage.

Facilities 
The station is equipped with a bench, a shelter and a help point, with a small car park adjacent to the station.

Passenger volume 
Beasdale was one of six railway stations in Britain to see zero passengers in the 2020/21 period, due to decreased travel throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. It is therefore Britain's joint-least-used station alongside Abererch, Llanbedr, Sampford Courtenay, Stanlow and Thornton and Sugar Loaf.

It has been noted to consistently be one of the lesser-used stations across Scotland.
