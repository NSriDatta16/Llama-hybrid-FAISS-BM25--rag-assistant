Narol is a dynasty of Hasidic rebbes originally based in the village of Narol, W. Galicia (now Poland).

The Naroler dynasty was founded by Rabbi Yaakov Reinman (1778–1814) (b. 5538, d. 4 Tamuz 5574 on the Hebrew calendar), who served as rabbi of Radichow, Kozowa and Holishits before being appointed to the rabbinate of Narol.

The late Naroler Rebbe, Rabbi  was born on the 25th of Elul 5667 (1907), and at the time of his death was one of the oldest living Hasidic rebbes. He was a Belzer chasid. In 1927, at the age of 20, he was appointed as the 20th Rabbi of Narol. He married the daughter of Rabbi Meshulam Zalman Yosef Zilberfarb of Toporow (now Toporiv); they had a son Aharon and a daughter Malka who perished in World War II, and a son Dov Berish who is the present Naroler Rebbe.

He survived World War II in Siberia; then resided in Antwerp, Lower East Side, Manhattan, Crown Heights and finally, for the last 30 years of his life, in Bnei Brak, Israel. He died on 18 Tamuz 5767 (July 4, 2007) at the age of 99; having been the Naroler rebbe for 80 years.

The present Naroler Rebbe, Rabbi Berish Shapiro, is the only surviving son of Rabbi Chaim Myer Yechiel. He resided in the Gravesend section of Brooklyn, New York, but now lives in B'nei Brak, Israel. He is a prominent board member of Kolel Chibas Yerushalayim. His son, , is active in the Jewish community of Stamford Hill, London. The UK Mincha Guide is just one of his projects. Other children of the Naroler Rebbe include Rabbis Aharon Shapiro, Naroler Rav, and Zalman Shapiro, and the Koidanover Rebbetzin.
