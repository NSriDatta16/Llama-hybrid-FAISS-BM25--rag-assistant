Urunga Wetlands
In May 2017 the Urunga Wetlands were opened to the public. It features a wheelchair accessible 150-metre boardwalk and a 450-metre walking track surrounding the park. In the late 1960s and early 1970s the area was the site of a processing plant used for extracting the heavy metal antimony from its ore, stibnite. Antimony and other heavy metals leached into the surrounding melaleuca wetlands creating what was claimed to be "one of the most polluted natural environments in New South Wales." In 2015 a $10 million reclamation project began that involved treating over 36,000 tonnes of contaminated soils at the site and its storage in an onsite containment cell. Water quality of the wetlands has returned to acceptable levels and birds and other wildlife have started to return since completion of the project.
