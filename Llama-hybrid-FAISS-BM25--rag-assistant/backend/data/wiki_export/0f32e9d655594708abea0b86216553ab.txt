History

On 9 February 1934, Mahatma Gandhi visited Andipatti, arriving by train at 5:30 PM from Theni. At the Andipatti Railway Station, the villagers of Andipatti received him, along with a large crowd from the neighbouring villages like Muthukrishnapuram, S.S.Puram, Lakshmipuram, Jakkampatti. A wooden table was placed on the platform of the Andipatti Station and Gandhi used it as a dais to address the gathering; a Welcome Address in Tamil printed on khadi cloth and wooden-framed was read out by Mr. P.C. Rajan and handed over to Gandhi, who was delighted to see it printed on his favourite khadi cloth. He wished to carry it with him on his tour, but realised that he could not carry it all through his journey. Hence with the permission of the villagers, he decided to auction the memento and use the fund for welfare scheme. P.C. Rajan was the successful bidder and he collected the souvenir from the hands of Gandhi. The piece was later on donated by Mr. Rajan to the authorities of the Gandhi Museum in Madurai in the 1960s.
