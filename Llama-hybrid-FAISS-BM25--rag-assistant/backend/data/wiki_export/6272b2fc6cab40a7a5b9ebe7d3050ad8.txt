The station was renamed Repton and Willington in 1855, with a notice on the platform: "Alight here for Repton School". The station closed in 1968 as part of the Beeching Axe, before being reopened in 1994.

It was planned that both platforms will be extended by up to 16 metres by no later than 2012.
