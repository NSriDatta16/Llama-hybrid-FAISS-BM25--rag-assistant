Children of the Corn was an American hip-hop group formed in 1993, consisting of neighborhood friends and fellow Harlem rappers, and producers Big L, Cam'ron, Ma$e, Herb McGruff, Bloodshed,
Six Figga Digga, and 
DukeDaGod. The group's name is a play on words; it is short for Children of the Corner, and also references Stephen King's 1984 film of the same name.

History
Big L was the founder of the group. He pushed Mase and Cam'ron off the streets and into the studio. Bloodshed, was Cam'ron's cousin. DukeDaGod and producer Six Figga Digga were included. The last member of the group and Big L's childhood friend, Herb McGruff, joined. They released over 30 songs under the name Children of the Corn, as they tried for a record deal. They got paid any way they could, rhyming for local DJs and selling mixtapes out of their trunks.

The group disbanded after the death of Bloodshed in a car crash on March 2, 1997 at age 21.  Even before the group disbanded, each of the group members had pursued their solo careers. Big L signed with  Columbia, and would eventually start his own record label  Flamboyant Entertainment. Ma$e signed with Bad Boy. Cam'ron signed with Epic/ Untertainment. Bloodshed signed with Priority. Herb McGruff signed with Uptown. A collection of the group's songs, entitled Children of the Corn: The Collector's Edition was released in 2003.
