The Berry Vest of The Swirling Eddies is the title of compilation album featuring music by the rock band The Swirling Eddies, released in 1995 on Alarma Records.

In an unusual twist, the cassette version of this "best of" compilation included a bonus track not found on the CD entitled "Wacky Fan Letter." The track featured Camarillo Eddy reading an actual letter from a fan in which the writer harshly criticized the band's albums.
