The Broadgate Tower is a skyscraper in London's main financial district, the City of London. It was constructed between 2005 and 2008.

History
The developer for the site was British Land. In February 2005 Broadgate Plaza Ltd, a subsidiary of British Land, submitted a planning application to the City of London for the construction of two buildings of 33 stories and 13 stories. Broadgate Tower, which was designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and built by Bovis Lend Lease, was completed in 2008. It was constructed at the same time as the neighbouring building, 201 Bishopsgate, and the two are separated by a covered pedestrian area.

The building was used in the James Bond Skyfall movie to represent a Shanghai skyscraper.
