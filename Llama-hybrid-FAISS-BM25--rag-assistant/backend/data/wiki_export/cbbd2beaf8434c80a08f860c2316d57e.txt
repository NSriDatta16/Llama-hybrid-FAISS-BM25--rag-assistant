The release is largely a remixed and rearranged version of their 1999 debut Waterworld. The album was one of the most acclaimed underground hip hop releases of 2000, though it only sold around 20,000 copies.

Masters of the Universe was re-released on July 25, 2006 by Infinite Rhythm Network.

Critical reception 

In a review for AllMusic, Brad Mills wrote that the album has "everything a great hip-hop album requires, with varied beats, differing rhyme deliveries, and content you'll find yourself thinking about long after it's been said." He rated the album 4.5 out of 5 stars, and noted that "without huge marketing budget from a major label, this album will probably fail to reach the level of success it deserves." At RapReviews, Steve Juon rated the album 9 out of 10, and argued the album "represents everything that's right about underground hip-hop... Very few albums that come out are as well conceived or prepared as "Masters of the Universe" â€“ which proves exactly why the title of Binary Star's national debut is truly apt." In a 2014 "Album of the Week" for Bonus Cut, Daniel Hodgman wrote that the album was an "aggressive mix of raw underground hip-hop and self-conscious lyricism... Most of what makes Masters of the Universe pleasing is its relentless punchlines, vast lyrical depth and succinct production as an underground hit.
