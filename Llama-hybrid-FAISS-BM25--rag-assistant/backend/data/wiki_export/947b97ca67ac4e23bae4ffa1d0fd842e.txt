Boyacá Chicó Fútbol Club is a professional Colombian football team based in Tunja playing in the Categoría Primera A. The club was founded on March 26, 2002 in Bogotá as Deportivo Bogotá Chicó F.C., named after one of the city's neighborhoods. After gaining promotion from Primera B in 2003 and playing one more season in the capital, the club was relocated to its current ground and renamed Boyacá Chicó F.C. They play their home games at the Estadio de La Independencia stadium.

History
The club was founded in 2002 as Chicó Futbol Club, after the neighborhood of Chicó, in the locality of Chapinero in Bogotá, where Eduardo Pimentel, the manager of the project and former player of Millonarios, América de Cali, Independiente Medellín, Deportivo Pereira and the Colombia national football team, was born. The club played their first season in Primera B in 2002 after buying a license from Cortuluá, and won the Primera B championship in 2003, beating Pumas de Casanare in the double-legged final series and earned further promotion to Primera A.

After its move to Tunja and the arrival of manager Alberto Gamero in 2006, Boyacá Chicó started enjoying consistent results which allowed them to reach the semifinals of the domestic championship in the 2006 Finalización and both tournaments of the 2007 season, qualifying for the 2008 Copa Libertadores. In 2008, the club won its first Primera A title, defeating América de Cali in the Torneo Apertura final. In 2016, after thirteen seasons in Primera A, the team was relegated. However, the club only spent one season in the second tier, being promoted back to the Primera A after winning the Primera B championship in 2017.
