NASCAR 2001 is a racing simulator video game developed and published by EA Sports for PlayStation and PlayStation 2. NASCAR 2001 was the fourth game in the EA Sports NASCAR series, and is the first in the series to include manufacturer representation (although the Windows version of NASCAR 2000 and NASCAR Arcade, released by Sega under EA Sports' license, also featured manufacturer branding) and Daytona International Speedway.

The game features tributes to Adam Petty and Kenny Irwin Jr. (who otherwise are also playable drivers), who died during the season the game was based.

Reception

The game received "average" reviews on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. However, David Chen of NextGen said of the PlayStation 2 version, "Ultimately enjoyable as driving in circles, NASCAR 2001 is neither pretty nor fun."

Lamchop of GamePro said in its November 2000 issue, "Ultimately, NASCAR 2001 for the PlayStation is a fast-paced racing game that should keep you glued to the trackâ€”if you can overlook the sound issues. At the very least, a rental will get your adrenaline pumping for a weekend of true NASCAR competition fun." About an issue later, Air Hendrix wrote, "For its rookie season on the PS2, NASCAR 2001 handles like a winner. It's not perfect, but it's close enough to thrill stock-car fans looking for the next cool ride."
