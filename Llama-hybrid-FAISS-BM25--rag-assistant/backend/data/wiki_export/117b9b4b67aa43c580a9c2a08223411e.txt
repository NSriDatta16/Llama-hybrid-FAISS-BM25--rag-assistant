Qualification

The 47 national teams were divided into nine groups (one group of four + five groups of 5 + three groups of 6). The records of the nine group runners-up were then compared.  The top seven joined the nine winners in a play-off for the eight finals spots. One of the eight qualifiers was then chosen to host the remaining fixtures.
