Grateful Dead Download Series: Family Dog at the Great Highway is a live album by the rock band the Grateful Dead. It was released as a digital download on December 6, 2005, along with Grateful Dead Download Series Volume 8. It was recorded on February 4, 1970 at Family Dog at the Great Highway, in San Francisco, California. Three of the songs (tracks 1,4, and 5) were broadcast on an NET television special at the time.

Three bonus tracks also date from 1970 in San Francisco. "Dancing in the Streets" is from October 5, 1970; "Monkey and the Engineer" and "Good Lovin'" are from December 31, 1970 (see The Closing of Winterland for another track from the latter concert).

The album is not to be confused with the similarly titled Family Dog at the Great Highway, San Francisco, CA 4/18/70, recorded the same year at the same venue.
