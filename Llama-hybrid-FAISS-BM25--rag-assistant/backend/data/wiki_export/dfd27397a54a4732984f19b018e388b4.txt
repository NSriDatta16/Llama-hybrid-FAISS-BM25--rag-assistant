Karl Jenkins, better known as Dice Raw, is an American rapper from Philadelphia. He is associated with The Roots, and the now defunct musical group Nouveau Riche.

He hooked up with the band while still in high school after Kelo, a member of the group's production team, spotted him in a local talent show. The group quickly took the young rapper under their collective wings and decided to bring his talent along slowly. He made his debut in "The Lesson, Pt. 1." Soon after, he made a name for himself with cameos on "Episodes" and "Adrenaline", where his hard-hitting style complemented the heady rhymes of Roots leader Black Thought. Dice Raw has made several guest appearances on several mixtapes. He made an appearance in fellow band member and beatboxer Scratch's first solo album Embodiment of Instrumentation.

In 2000, Dice Raw released his solo debut album, Reclaiming the Dead on MCA Records.

Additionally Jenkins has been in the studio functioning as co writer and producer for The Roots, in addition to working on his own material. In May 2010, Dice released his first solo single in ten years entitled "100" off of his upcoming solo project The Greatest Rapper Never. The single is a digital release and was made available on iTunes.

Jenkins has turned his interest to the performing arts world and has written and produced a multitude of musicals including The Last Jimmy, the story of mass incarceration inspired by of escaped slave Henry Box Brown.
