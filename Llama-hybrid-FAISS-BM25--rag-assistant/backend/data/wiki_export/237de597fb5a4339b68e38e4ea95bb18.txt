The Lumen Technologies Operating Companies are local exchange carriers owned by Lumen Technologies, the third largest landline telephone company in the United States. 

Lumen Technologies operating companies consist of operations inherited from various predecessor companies, which is reflected in the differing names of the companies and partially overlapping service territories; all operating companies do business as Lumen Technologies. Predecessors include: 
 CenturyTel - the former corporate name of CenturyLink.
 Embarq, the former landline operations of Sprint Nextel, which were spun off in 2006; these include operations dating from Sprint's time as United Telecommunications and operations owned by Centel, which it acquired in 1993.
 Qwest Communications International - which, through its acquisition of U S WEST, inherited operations of the former Bell System in numerous western states.
