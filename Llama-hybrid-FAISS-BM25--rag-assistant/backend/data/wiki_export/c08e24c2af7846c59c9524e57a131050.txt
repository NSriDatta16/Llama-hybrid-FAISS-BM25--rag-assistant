Shirley Cheriton (born 28 June 1955) is an English actress and performer, best known for her roles as Debbie Wilkins in the BBC soap opera EastEnders and her portrayal of Miss Prescott in the Are You Being Served? follow up, Grace & Favour.

Cheriton was born in London. Her EastEnders role ran from her arrival in the Square in March 1985 until her departure with Detective Terry Rich (Gary Whelan) in May 1987. Her character was Walford's original middle-class yuppie, as well as for her stormy relationship with the Scottish nurse, Andy O'Brien (Ross Davidson).
