Early life and career

She sang with the group for 11 years, performing songs done by singers Helen Kane and Annette Henshaw; the former was an inspiration for the Betty Boop character. In 1988, she joined the Orlando Magic's inaugural dance team, and was part of the Magic Girls for three years. 

In 1991, she was cast as the official Betty Boop for Universal Studios.

In 2012, she joined a Lancome promotion in Paris as the voice of Betty Boop in their commercials.

Voice-over career 
Fox was inspired to go into voice acting after having taken a voice-over workshop in 1990 with Sue Blu, a Los Angeles-based animation director and producer. After moving to Los Angeles, she voiced supporting and background characters for The Simpsons, mostly with kids voices and loop groups, which she did for three years. She also voiced characters for Futurama and King of the Hill.

In 2003, she voiced the title characters in Omishi Magical Theater Risky Safety and Ground Defense Force! Mao-chan. In his review of Mao-chan, Ryan Mathews of Anime News Network wrote that "Bang Zoom picked the perfect actress to play the lead role. [Fox], the owner of perhaps the cutest "little girl" voice in anime dub acting, is her usual adorable self as M.A.O."

In 2007, she and Lex Lang hosted a Voice Actor Boot Camp at Bang Zoom! Entertainment to help up and coming voice actors get into the business. In 2014, when Viz Media redubbed Sailor Moon and dubbed its new Sailor Moon Crystal series, Fox was chosen to voice Chibiusa.
