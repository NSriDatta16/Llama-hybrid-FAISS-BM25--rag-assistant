In March 1973, the Provisional IRA placed a car bomb outside the post office at No. 1, Broadway. It was defused before it exploded, but two other devices, one in Whitehall and another near the Old Bailey, exploded that day, killing one person who died from a heart attack attributed to the bombing, and injuring over 200.
