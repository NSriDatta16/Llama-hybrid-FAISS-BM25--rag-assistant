Liu Liankun () (20 January 1933 – 15 August 1999), was a major general (shao jiang) in the People's Liberation Army who provided the Republic of China (ROC) in Taiwan with secret intelligence about the status of missiles from the People's Republic of China (PRC). During the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1996, the ROC Ministry of National Defense notified the public that the missiles launched by the PRC actually carried unarmed warheads. This tipped off Beijing that Taipei had a high-level mole working on the mainland. Liu, a top Chinese military logistics officer, was arrested, court-martialed and executed in 1999.

The ROC's Military Intelligence Bureau confirmed that Liu was one of its spies in 2018.
