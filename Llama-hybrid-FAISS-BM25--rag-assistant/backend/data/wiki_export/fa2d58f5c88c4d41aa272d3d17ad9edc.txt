Historicon is the largest gaming convention in North America devoted to solely historical miniature wargaming. It is sponsored by the Historical Miniatures Gaming Society, a nonprofit guiding organization. The Wall Street Journal has described Historicon as the "mother of all wargaming conventions."

Typically, Historicon is a four-day convention held in July each year since 1994. Thousands of miniature gamers and military history enthusiasts gather to play in hundreds of tabletop games, tournaments, and demonstrations. The convention is accompanied by a flea market of used gaming items and accessories, a large dealer hall offering new merchandise, a series of seminars and training sessions, painting competitions, and similar events. The majority of events are history-related, with the remainder being fantasy, science fiction, steampunk, or horror miniature games.

Each year, Historicon has a different theme and focal point (such as the American Civil War or World War II), and many games and supporting events are geared around the theme.  Awards are presented to the Best Theme Event, as well as best games in specific time slots and other honors for particularly popular or impressive games.

Historicon was  held in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, at the Lancaster Host Resort, a hotel located on U.S. Route 30 in the heart of Pennsylvania Dutch and Amish country for many years.

For many years it was held in historic Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. In 2012 it moved to Fredericksburg, Virginia at the Fredericksburg Expo Center, a convention center a mile from Interstate 95, the main highway on the East Coast of the United States. Fredericksburg is rich in history, with the battlefields of Chancellorsville, Fredericksburg, the Wilderness, and Spotsylvania Court House commemorated nearby at the Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park. The National Museum of the Marine Corps is also within easy driving distance. In 2018 Historicon moved back to Lancaster, Pennsylvania and was held at its old home the Lancaster Host Resort (now known as the Wyndham Lancaster Resort and Convention Center). In 2019 Historicon was held at its new home the Lancaster County Convention Center.

In 2020, HMGS cancelled all of its conventions, including Historicon, due to Covid-19. In 2021, HMGS was again unable to hold Historicon during the usual mid-July timeframe; however, instead of cancelling again, they held it in mid-November, replacing the Fall In! convention that usually occurs at that time. The 2022 edition of the event was held at the Lancaster County Convention Center.
