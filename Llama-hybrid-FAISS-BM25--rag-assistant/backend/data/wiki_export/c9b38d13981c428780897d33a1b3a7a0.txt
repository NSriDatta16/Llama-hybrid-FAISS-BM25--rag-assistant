The Tennessee Lottery 250 is a NASCAR Xfinity Series race at Nashville Superspeedway. Traditionally held on Holy Saturday from 2001 to 2011, the race was removed when Dover Motorsports ceased operations of this track and Gateway International Raceway. It was reinstated in 2021 when Dover Motorsports took the second date away from Dover International Speedway and realigned it to reopening the Nashville Superspeedway, with the date moved to the Cup weekend in June.
