Adam Vella retired from professional Shooting and since December 2016 he has been appointed by Shooting Australia as the National High Performance Shotgun Coach.  "Adam's appointment comes after a competitive recruitment process and at an important time for the sport of shooting, as an Olympic and Commonwealth Games Medallist and former World Number One in two of the three shotgun disciplines Adam comes with an impeccable sporting pedigree. But most importantly he comes as the right person to lead our shotgun team. We need someone who knows the sport from the grass roots to the podium, someone who also has the strength of character to ensure that the sport of shooting challenges itself and delivers on its commitment to being better than it is today. Adam Vella is the unanimous choice of our selection panel" commented Shooting Australia CEO Damien Marangon.   https://web.archive.org/web/20170104164730/http://www.shootingaustralia.org/media/media-releases/2016/adam-vella-confirmed-as-national-high-performance-shotgun-coach/
