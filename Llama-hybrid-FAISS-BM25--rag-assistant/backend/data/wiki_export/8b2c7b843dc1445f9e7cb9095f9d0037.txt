Phil Rickman (also known under the pen names of Thom Madley and Will Kingdom) is a British author of supernatural and mystery novels.

Biography
Rickman was born in Lancashire in the north of England and worked as a journalist for BBC World Service TV and BBC Radio 4. He published his first book, Candlenight, in 1991, and began his Merrily Watkins series in 1998. In 2010, he began the John Dee Papers series, which focuses on the Welsh mathematician and astrologer, John Dee. 

Rickman has also worked on several music albums based upon his books and has helped write many of the albums' songs. He has lived in Wales most of his life and now resides (as of 2020) with his wife in Hay-on-Wye.

Rickman researches the folklore, religion, and supernatural themes of his books, saying "If I can't believe it, it doesn't go in". He has also voiced his unhappiness over his earlier critics which labeled him a horror writer. He says that he felt that the books did not fit neatly within that genre.
