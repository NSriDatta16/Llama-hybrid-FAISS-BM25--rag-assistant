The festivals popularity reached its peak in 1999, as hundreds of Barbershop enthusiasts, along with their friends and families packed into the small town of Bolton Landing for the annual Labor Day Barbershop Quartet Competitions. The Festival, originally started by Bolton native Andy Pratt, ended in 2002.

The Marcella Sembrich Opera Museum at Bolton Landing on the shore of Lake George commemorates the internationally known Polish soprano Marcella Sembrich (1858â€“1935), whose favourite composers included Vincenzo Bellini and Gaetano Donizetti.  In addition to her career in Europe, Sembrich had more than 450 performances at the New York Metropolitan Opera.  Her lakeside summer mansion was opened as a museum in 1937 and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

Every year since 1989, the Bolton Recreation Commission's summer free concert series in Roger's Memorial Park has been anchored by Bolton native and summer resident Matt Finley performing with his band, Rio JAZZ.

Since 2005, Bolton Landing has been home to the Lake George Theater Lab, a theater company devoted to new American plays and adaptations.  Bolton Landing was also the home of sculptor David Smith, and is where he did a large percentage of his work. David Smith was introduced to the hamlet through Wilhelmina Weber Furlong, the early American avant-garde modernist painter who pioneered the modernist movement in Bolton Landing, New York at Golden Heart Farm.
