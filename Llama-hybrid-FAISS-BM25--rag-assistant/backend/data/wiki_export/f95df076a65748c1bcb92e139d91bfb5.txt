Area denial artillery munition (ADAM) is a family of United States land mines and 155 mm artillery projectiles.

The mines carried by these projectiles are the M67 long-duration anti-personnel mines and M72 short-duration anti-personnel landmines intended to maim or kill enemy combatants. The duration refers to the self-destruct time, which is set at the time of manufacture to 4 or 48 hours.

Once the mine lands, it launches seven tripwires before arming itself. Any disturbance of the tripwires will trigger the mine. The mine is detonated only via electric current; if its battery charge drops below a pre-set level, the mine self-destructs. Even if it fails to self-destruct, the battery will fully discharge after 14 days, rendering the mine inactive.

The mines contain a spherical warhead in a cavity, along with  of M10 liquid propellant. The cavity allows the propellant fluid to settle under gravity in the correct position beneath the warhead, making it launch upward irrespective of the mine's orientation. Upon activation the spherical warhead is launched to a height of , where it detonates, producing approximately 600 fragments travelling at .
