In applied mathematics, the transfer matrix is a formulation in terms of a block-Toeplitz matrix of the two-scale equation, which characterizes refinable functions. Refinable functions play an important role in wavelet theory and finite element theory.

For the mask , which is a vector with component indexes from  to ,
the transfer matrix of , we call it  here, is defined as

More verbosely

The effect of  can be expressed in terms of the downsampling operator "":
