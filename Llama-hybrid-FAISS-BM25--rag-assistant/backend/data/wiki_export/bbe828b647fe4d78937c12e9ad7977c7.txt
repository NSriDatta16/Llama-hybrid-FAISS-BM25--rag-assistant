Kugar is a discontinued tool for generating business quality reports for KOffice. The reports can be viewed and printed. It includes a standalone report viewer and a KParts report viewer. The latter means that any K Desktop Environment 3 application can embed the report viewing functionality and that reports can be viewed using the Konqueror browser.

Kugar works by merging application generated data with a template to produce the final report. Both the data and the template are specified using XML. This approach means that applications only need worry about generating the data itself. A template can be referenced via a URL which allows businesses to create a centrally managed template library.

History 
Kugar was developed by theKompany as derivative from Metaphrast, originally written by Keith Davis at Mutiny Bay Software, beginning in August 1999. theKompany released version 1.0 on 21 September 2000 which was based on K Desktop Environment 2 and Qt 2.2.0. On 21 February 2001 Kugar was donated to KDE for inclusion into KOffice. KOffice 1.1 – the last version based on K Desktop Environment 2 – was released as beta version on 24 April 2001 and already included Kugar as stable application. Kugar remained part of
KOffice up to version 1.6.3. Kugar was not ported to become part of KOffice 2. Kexi’s new Report Designer – introduced in KOffice 2.2 on 28 May 2010 – served as replacement for Kugar.
