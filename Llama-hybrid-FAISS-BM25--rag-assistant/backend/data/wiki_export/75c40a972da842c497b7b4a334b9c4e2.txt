Surigao Airport  is an airport serving the general area of Surigao City, located in the province of Surigao del Norte in the Philippines. The airport is classified as a Class 2 principal (minor domestic) airport by the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines, a body of the Department of Transportation that is responsible for the operations of not only this airport but also of all other airports in the Philippines except the major international airports.

History
Surigao Airport experienced significant damage caused by the 2017 Surigao earthquake, and it was closed for two weeks for repairs. Cebgo and PAL Express, the two airlines serving the airport at the time, utilized Bancasi Airport in Butuan in the meantime. The airport reopened on 23 February 2017 with limited runway capacity of 1,000 meters.

The work began on the runway's rehabilitation on August 7, 2019, with completion target of November 2019 for the repair of the first 1,400 meters with the remaining 300 meters repaired by February 2020. The runway's partial operation of 1,400 meters, up from 1,000 meters, can accommodate direct flights between Manila and Surigao.

The newly renovated and expanded Sayak Airport on Siargao Island has received the bulk of tourism flights since the 2017 earthquake, significantly reducing air traffic to and from this Mindanao mainland airport.

By the late 2020's, the airport will move to Brgy. Balibayon in the future.

Infrastructure
Surigao Airport has one runway that is designated 18/36 and measures .
