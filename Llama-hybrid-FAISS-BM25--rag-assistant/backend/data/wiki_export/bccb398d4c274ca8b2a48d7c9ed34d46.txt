is one of the earliest international auxiliary languages.

Overview 

It was created by Joseph Schipfer and first published in Wiesbaden.

This project is of historical interest for two reasons—first, it being based on French, but the inclusion of , ,  reflects the common view of the time that French is "a world language to some extent". A mere forty years later, in 1879, Volapük took English for basis. Second, Schipfer's project reflects a new conscience of greater possibilities of the international communication which appeared by the invention of the railway and steam ship. He even recommended that his project be used on these "new means of voyage".

Grammar
 is based on (or a simplification of) French (see French orthography), making heavy (even exclusive) use of respelled French vocabulary, which Schipfer considered to be nearly universal among the educated classes of the world of his time. Silent letters were removed, one sound for one letter, circumflexes and diaereses were removed, graves to distinguish homographs were removed, the letter  was added (as in English), vowels  instead of ,  instead of French ,  instead of French  and ,  instead of French ,  instead of French ,  instead of French , the inclusion of macrons for long vowels, and one sound per letter. Although the final orthography can be read and spelled easily due to this one-sound-per-letter principle, the actual conversion of French words is inconsistent, being based sometimes on pronunciation and sometimes on orthography, for example word-final silent  is deleted, as in  "stomach" from , but silent  is kept, as in  "man" from .

Some of its characteristics are:

No articles.
Invariable adjectives.
Comparatives in  and .
Adverbs formed by adding  to adjectives.
Possessive pronouns in .
Infinitives in .
Nouns were declined.
Capitalization of nouns, as in German.

The declension of nouns works as follows, using  "house" as an example:

Examples

Our Father prayer
No Pera, wia ete Cielu
ta Noma sanctiferii;
ta Royoma Ais arrivii;
ta volonta färerii
com Cielu änsi Terru.
Donne Ais noa Päno quotidien;
pardonne Ais noa offansos,
com pardonnas Aos offanding;
non permette que succombias tantationi;
mä delivre Aos malu.

A Response to a Dear Friend

: 

German: 

English: Dear friend! I am asking a thousand times for understanding that I haven't responded to your very binding letter in proper time. I could not excuse this mistake if I could not assure you that I have been ill for several months. That is the sole cause for my long silence, and I wish to assure you at the same time that I appreciate the worth of your friendship and goodness, the continuation of which I subserviently ask for, in its entirety. I wish for nothing more dearly than to have an opportunity to be able to give you active proof of this statement, in order to actively show you with what respectful friendship I am, and shall remain, devoted to you. Monday, 28 January 1839, most devoted servant and friend of my most valued friend
