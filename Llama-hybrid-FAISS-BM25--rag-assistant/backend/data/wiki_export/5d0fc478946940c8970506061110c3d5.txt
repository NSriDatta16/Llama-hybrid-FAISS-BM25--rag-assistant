Early life and education
Carpenter was born on February 24, 1960, at St. Francis Hospital in Milwaukee.  He graduated from Milwaukee's Casimir Pulaski High School and attended Marquette University in 1978, before transferring to University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, where he received his bachelor's degree in political science and history in 1982.  He continued graduate work at Milwaukee, but was interrupted when he was elected to the Legislature in 1984. He later resumed his education at the La Follette School of Public Affairs at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he earned his master's degree in 1995.

Political career
After graduating from college, Carpenter worked briefly at a number of jobs, at Rustlers Steak House and as a courier for Federal Express.  He had become involved with the Democratic Party of Wisconsin at an early age and became a member of the state party's administrative committee.

The 20th Assembly district was heavily Democratic, based in southern Milwaukee—Carpenter faced five opponents in the Democratic primary. He prevailed in the six-way race with just 27% of the vote, and faced no opponent in the 1984 general election.

Carpenter was elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly in 1984 and served nine terms representing the 9th Assembly District until 2002, holding the post of Speaker Pro Tempore in 1993. He was first elected to represent Wisconsin's 3rd Senate District in 2002. During the 2007–08 biennium, he served as President Pro Tempore of the Wisconsin State Senate.
