March railway station is on the Elyâ€“Peterborough line in the east of England and serves the market town of March, Cambridgeshire. It is  measured from London Liverpool Street via  and is situated between  and  stations.

The station, which was opened in 1847, was once a major junction with a number of lines radiating from the town.
The station has been the scene of a number of accidents including a double train crash in 1896.
 
The station has since reduced in importance, with several lines being dismantled or mothballed. The regional route between  and  still runs through the station and an increasing number of freight trains pass through.

The station originally had seven platforms. However, two of these are now filled-in bay platforms and the track has been removed from a further west-facing bay on the southern side of the station. There are now just two operational platforms, although track has been re-laid on two disused platforms on the northern side of the station and it is anticipated that these may be used should proposals to re-open the line to Wisbech come to fruition. The nearby Whitemoor marshalling yard returned to use in 2004 having been disused since the early 1990s.

In 2021, a Victorian ledger dating back to April 1885 was found after it fell from the loft of the station when contractors were removing rotten wood work. The ledger is planned to go on display at the station.

In March 2022, the station car park was resurfaced and repainted.

Spalding, St Ives and Wisbech branches 
March was once a junction for lines to  (opened in 1867 by the Great Northern Railway and subsequently vested jointly with the Great Eastern Railway in 1879), St Ives (opened in 1848) and  via Wisbech. The Spalding line was closed by British Rail in November 1982 and was completely lifted a few years later. The St Ives branch was closed completely in March 1967 as a result of the Beeching cuts, whilst the Wisbech line (known as the Bramley Line) closed to all traffic in 2000 having lost its regular passenger services (through to ) in September 1968. The trackwork however remains intact and there are proposals to reopen the line as a heritage line run and maintained by enthusiasts.
