Gudang or Djagaraga (Pantyinamu/Yatay/Gudang/Kartalaiga and other clans) is an Australian Aboriginal language. It is the traditional language of the Gudang people, and is the northernmost language of the Cape York Peninsula.  It is closely related to Urradhi (dialects Urradhi, Angkamuthi, Yadhaykenu, Wudhadhi, etc.), its neighbour to the south, and distantly related to its neighbour to the north, the Western-Central Torres Strait Language (Kala Lagaw Ya), from which it borrowed quite a few vocabulary items.

Phonology

Going by the records of the language recorded in MacGillivray and Brierly, as well as comparing these with their Urradhi and WCL counterparts, the phonology of the language appeared to have been as follows:
	
vowels : i ,  ii ;  e ,  ee ;  a ,  aa ;  u ,  uu 

The high vowels i, ii  and  u, uu  had mid variants, thus  and .  Some Western-Central Torres Strait Language (WCL; see Kalau Lagau Ya) loans probably retained the WCL vowels unchanged.   The vowels e/ ee  otherwise appear to have had a similar marginal status as in Urradhi (Crowley 1983:317).

consonants :

labial  p, b, m 

velar  k, g, ng 

labio-velar  kw, w 

lamino-dental  th, dh, l, nh 

lamino-palatal  ch, j, ny, y 

alveolar  t, d, n 

retroflex  rt, rr, r 

The non-sonorant sounds appear to have had voice contrasts, except after nasals, when both voiced and voiceless allophones occurred, with the voiced allophones seemingly more common.  While the lamino-dental and alveolar contrast was not marked by the European recorders, the Urradhi and WCL cognates strongly suggest that it existed.

Differences between Gudang and Urradhi
The main differences in phonology between Gudang and the Urradhi dialects appears to be:

(1) Voiced stops existed where Urradhi has voiced fricatives, in part because of WCL loans, thus Urradhi  ,  , and  ) correspond to Gudang b, dh and g.  Note that in ipadha 'father', Gudang p corresponds to Urradhi  (ivadha), both representing Proto-Paman *piipa, proto Gudang-Urradhi *piipata.

(2) Gudang had reflexive rt from Proto Paman *r and *rr

Proto-Paman *warapa 'water, stream', Urradhi atava, Gudang artaba

Proto-Paman *mara 'hand', Urradhi mata, Gudang arta

Proto-Paman *yurru 'elbow', Urradhi yutu (Angkamuthi yurtu), Gudang yurtu

Proto-Paman *murunya 'shin', Urradhi mutuny (Angkamuthi murtuny), Gudang urtunya

(3) A slightly higher rate of initial dropping (including initial syllables) was evident in Gudang.

(4) Gudang retained final CV syllables where Urradhi has reduced these to C.

(5) Gudang had word final -rra where Urradhi has -l, and stronger retention of rr and l in the clusters rrk and lk (e.g. see ukarra and ralkagamarra).

(6) Gudang had virtually no trace of the utterance final suppletion very evident in Urradhi (e.g. mata > matang, matak), the one exception being anhadhing.  However, initial and final vowel elision appeared to have been the norm.

(7) There was a strong tendency in Gudang for u to become i before following palatals (and perhaps elsewhere) (e.g. inyaanha, ikuurra).

The statistics of the comparisons are listed below.

These figures show that Gudang was a separate language from the Urradhi group.

Gudang and the Western-Central Language of Torres Strait (Kalau Lagau Ya)
Gudang shares about 20% of its words with Kalau Lagau Ya (termed WCL = Western-Central Language here-in) due to loaning between the languages.  It is obvious from MacGillivray, Brierly and Ray that there was extensive intermarriage and contacts between the Gudang and the Islanders, particularly but not exclusively with the people of the Muralag group (commonly called the Kowrareg people).  The data Brierly and others collected from Barbara Thompson and local people show that where marriage, clan membership and other cultural aspects were concerned, that the Gudang fitted as much into the Islanders' world as in the neighbouring Urradhi world.  Also, it appeared that the Gudang were on the whole bilingual in WCL, and this perhaps reflects the fact that so many WCL words were recorded as being Gudang by MacGillivray.  We will probably never know how many such recorded words were mistakes on his part, by him or his informants misunderstanding which language was being asked for.

Vocabulary comparison list
The following words are drawn from MacGillivray, J., 1852, "Narrative of the Voyage of HMS Rattlesnake", Vol II. London: T.W. Boone.., with some additions from MOORE, David R., 1979, "Islanders and Aborigines at Cape York : An ethnographic reconstruction based on the 1848-1850 'Rattlesnake' Journals of O.W. Brierly and information he obtained from Barbara Thompson". Canberra: Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies.  The spelling has been standardised according the phonological outline above. MacGillivray has for example (quote):

In those cases where MacGillivray's and Brierly's written forms were too uncertain, the form in their spellings is in italics.

Cognates are bold, possible cognates italic, and loans/possible loans from WCL marked by *.

A very intriguing aspect of most of the verb forms noted by MacGillivray is that they are either reduplicated forms (such as amamangi, which corresponds to Urradhi ama), or are marked by -kamarra/-gamarra, which does not appear to have an Urradhi cognate.

Loans or Possible Loans from the Western-Central Language of Torres Strait (Kala Lagaw Ya)

The following words vary from clear to possible loans from WCL into Gudang and Urradhi.  This is shown by the phonology of the words (retention of consonant initials and other phonological 'oddities' from the point of view of Gudang and Urradhi).  Most are fairly recent,  however, some, such as sara 'tern', are older in that the Urradhi dialects have undergone sound changes similar to those undergone by Paman word stock.  Possible loans are marked (?).
