See Scorecard. It was considered a strong team in the 1940s and 1950s, winning 4 times and coming runner-up twice.
Vijay Hazare , Irfan Pathan , Yusuf Pathan , Hardik Pandya are amongst the most prominent cricketers to emerge from Baroda. They have performed exceedingly well at the international level for India.
