Football West is the state governing body for soccer in Western Australia (WA). It is affiliated with Football Australia (FA), the sport's national governing body, and through FA's affiliation to FIFA. Football West's premier competition is the National Premier Leagues (NPL) WA, which is the highest league in WA and one tier below the national A-League. NPL WA is a division within the National Premier Leagues. Football West is also responsible for running Western Australia's National Training Centre in conjunction with FA and the WA Government's Department of Local Government, Sport and Cultural Industries (DLGSC). Football West also runs the Football West State Cup knock-out cup. Since 2014 the two State Cup finalists also qualify for the Australia Cup.

History
The Western Australian Soccer Association was established in July 2004 to represent the all levels of competition and the game of soccer in Perth metropolitan and regional Western Australia. The body was formed following a period of national and state review and reform, that was led by Federal and State Governments and facilitated by the Department of Sport and Recreation WA (now part of the larger DLGSC) with the objective of creating a unified State soccer body representative. The association changed its name to Football West in early 2005.

In 2014 Football West invested more than $45,000 in subsidising coaching courses to promote coach education programs in the NPL.

In May 2019, Liberal-National Coalition Prime Minister Scott Morrison pledged $16.25 million towards a State Football Centre at Maniana Reserve, Queens Park, Cannington. This figure was matched by Labor's WA Premier Mark McGowan in 2020, which meant construction of the State Football Centre could go ahead. It is due to be completed around May 2023, in time for the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup. The centre was officially opened in October 2023 and was named the Sam Kerr Football Centre. 

The number of registered participants in Western Australia in the 2016 season was over 44,000.
