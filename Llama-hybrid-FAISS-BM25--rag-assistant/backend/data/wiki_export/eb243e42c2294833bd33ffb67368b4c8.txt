Cadereyta de Montes () is a city and municipality in the Mexican state of Querétaro, Mexico. The municipality is the second most extensive in the state.

The city was founded in 1640, and received its current name in two stages: first in 1642 in honor of Viceroy Don Lope Díez de Armendáriz, marqués de Cadereyta, and then in 1904 after the lawyer Ezequiel Montes. From its conception during the Spanish rule of Mexico, the city was intended to become quite important. It received the status of Alcaldía mayor in 1689, thus becoming the dominant city in this part of the state. It was a post from which the main trade routes were defended from attacks by the indigenous people of the Sierra Gorda.

A famous greenhouse called Finca Schmoll is in the city, preserving a large collection of desert plants open to the public.

HISTORY

Approximately 7,000 years ago, the Cadereyta region was inhabited by various nomad groups who hunted and collected food to sustain themselves [1]. Some of these indigenous groups were the Chichimecas, Pame, and Jonace. These groups were some of the primary inhabitants until the arrival of the Spaniards, the indigenous groups continuously pushed back and fought against the Spanish. From this conflict arose a wave of peace campaigns, which were undertaken by religious missionaries who came from Tecozautla and Huichapan, and the military [2]. In 1639 Viceroy Lope Diez of Armendariz (Marquess of Cadereyta/ Cadreita) fully supported the peace campaigns, which were being led by Captain Alonso of Tovar Guzman. The captain later named the city of Cadereyta in memory of the Marquess of Cadereyta [2]. Around 1640 the Spaniards established the Villa de Cadereyta [1]. 

Today Cadereyta is considered one of the pueblos magicos, or magical cities, due to its colonial architecture seen in its churches, extensive culture, and various historical monuments.

The population of the municipality grew from 51,688 in 2000 to 57,204 in 2005.
