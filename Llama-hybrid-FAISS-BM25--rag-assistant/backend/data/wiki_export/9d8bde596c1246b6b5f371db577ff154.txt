It broadcasts from CNET's New York City CBS studios weekly. It used to broadcast a daily live show but that ended after a studio change. The 404 is the only remnant of the previous CNET Live format (from which all other shows were canceled) and spawned a short-lived video game discussion show preGAME, also hosted by Bakalar. Frequent guests include CBS MoneyWatch editor Jill Schlesinger and other CNET editors though the show has welcomed prolific podcasters like Marc Maron and Scott Aukerman and other celebrities in recent years as its popularity has grown. The show has amassed a large following without the use of standard advertising or promotion as it does not necessarily fall within the typical format of a CNET property. In production since November 2007, it was previously co-hosted by Randall Bennett until May 2008, Wilson Tang until February 2012, and Justin Yu until July 2014. At the start of May 2013, Bakalar and Yu began implying that a move to a bigger studio might be in the works. In December 2013, the show actually moved into a brand new studio. The crew has also been hinting that a brand new weekly show, hosted by Bakalar (with Yu and others producing) would hit in 2014 and is currently said to be in pre-production. On June 6, 2014, The 404 Show broadcast its 1,500th episode. In July, 2014, Justin Yu left the show and was replaced by Iyaz Akhtar, a long time podcaster and host from the TWiT.tv network. On December 4, 2014, the show broadcast its 1,589th episode, thus surpassing Buzz Out Loud as CNET's longest-running podcast ever. It was also announced that starting in 2015 the show would return to its roots as an audio-only podcast. Starting in 2016, the show is now hosted solely by Bakalar and Frushtick after Akhtar was asked to leave the show.
