Nes is a former municipality in the old Hedmark county, Norway. The  municipality existed from 1838 until its dissolution in 1964 when it became part of Ringsaker Municipality. The administrative centre was the village of Tingnes where Nes Church is located. The largest village in Nes was Stavsjø where the Stavsjø Church is located. The municipality included the Nes peninsula and the island of Helgøya which both are surrounded by the large lake Mjøsa, Norway's largest lake.

History
The parish of Næs was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the municipality of Nes (population: 4,184) was merged with the municipality of Furnes (population: 7,288), the municipality of Ringsaker (population: 16,490), and the Hamarsberget and Vikersødegården areas of the municipality of Vang (population: 34) to create the new, larger Ringsaker Municipality.

Name
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old Nes farm () since the first Nes Church was built there. The name is identical to the word  which means "headland".

Government
While it existed, this municipality was responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment, social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads. During its existence, this municipality was governed by a municipal council of directly elected representatives. The mayor was indirectly elected by a vote of the municipal council.

Municipal council
The municipal council  of Nes was made up of 23 representatives that were elected to four year terms. The party breakdown of the final municipal council was as follows:
