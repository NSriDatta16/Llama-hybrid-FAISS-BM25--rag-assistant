The following list includes all the works of Lydia Sigourney that were published as books under her supervision.  Contributions to periodicals, which number many thousands, are not included; similarly, single poems reprinted for distribution at funerals or for other occasions have been excluded. Where the same work reappeared under a new title, the second title is listed with a reference to the earlier one.  The dates in all cases are taken from the title pages, though many of the books were published late in the preceding years to catch the holiday trade.
