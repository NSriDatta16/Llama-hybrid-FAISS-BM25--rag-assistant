The team name was the Bears.1993-94 and 95 Men's Varsity basketball was ranked top in the city of Philadelphia.

History

Germantown High became a grade 11-12 school after Martin Luther King High School, housing grades 9-10, opened on February 8, 1972. The school district used this arrangement since it intended to keep students in Northwest Philadelphia economically integrated. Some neighborhoods in proximity to King, such as East Mount Airy and West Oak Lane, wanted King to become a 9-12 school because Germantown High was located in proximity to poorer areas. Eventually Germantown and King became separate 9-12 schools. The campuses are about  apart.

Germantown High's peak student population was over 3,000. The enrollment declined due to the availability of magnet schools and charter schools. Prior to the school's 2013 closure, an entire wing had been blocked off and there were 676 students. In 2013 the students from Germantown were transferred to King.

In April 2019, the Germantown United CDC and the Keeping Society of Philadelphia filed a nomination authored by Oscar Beisert, Architectural Historian and Historic Preservationist, to list the building in the Philadelphia Register of Historic Places. At its 691st Stated Meeting on March 13, 2020, the Philadelphia Historical Commission voted unanimously to designate the building and its grounds, a status which comes with protection from alteration and demolition, as well as regulatory authority during any future redevelopment of the property.

Demographics
In 2013 the school had 676 students, mostly low income and African-American. Students in foster care and homeless students made up at least 10% of that student body.

Academic performance
In 2013 the school's graduation rate was below 50%, 18% of students had proficiency in reading, and 15% had proficiency in mathematics.

Athletics
American football players had to ride a bus to sports practice because Germantown High did not have an on-campus athletic field. King and Germantown were previously athletic rivals, but after 2013 American football team players of Germantown High joined King's team.
