Harmon White Caldwell (January 29, 1899 â€“ April 15, 1977) was President of the University of Georgia (UGA) in Athens from 1935 until 1948 and Chancellor of the University System of Georgia from 1948 to 1964.

Caldwell was born in the Carmel Community of Meriwether County, Georgia, in 1899. He earned an A.B. from UGA in 1919 after only two years and was a member of the Chi Phi Fraternity and the Phi Kappa Literary Society. Upon graduation, he taught public school in both Sasser, Georgia and Taylorsville, Georgia. In 1921, Caldwell entered the Harvard Law School and graduated with the degree Bachelor of Law (LL.B.) in 1924. That same year he became a part-time assistant professor of law at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, in addition to practicing law at the firm of King, Caldwell and Partridge. Five years later, Caldwell assumed a professorship at the UGA School of Law. He returned to the law practice and part-time duties at Emory in 1932; however, he returned to UGA as the dean of the law school in 1933.

Caldwell's accomplishments as president include:
 Reorganization of the Graduate School in 1937
 Stewarding the purchase of the DeRenne Library of Georgianna, which formed the nucleus of the present day Department of Special Collections at University Libraries
 Creation of the University of Georgia Press
 The Navy preflight school
 A rise in attendance from 2,468 in the fall of 1945 to 6,643 in the fall of 1946

Desegregation

In 1961, during Caldwell's tenure the University of Georgia was forcibly desegregated. While Black applicants were told there was no campus accommodation available for them, an internal communication from Caldwell indicated that the university was "relying on this to bar the admission of a Negro girl from Atlanta."

Death

In 1977, Caldwell died in Atlanta, Georgia. Caldwell Hall, home to the University of Georgia's School of Environment and Design, is named in his honor, as well as the Harmon W. Caldwell Professorship in Constitutional Law in the UGA Law School.
