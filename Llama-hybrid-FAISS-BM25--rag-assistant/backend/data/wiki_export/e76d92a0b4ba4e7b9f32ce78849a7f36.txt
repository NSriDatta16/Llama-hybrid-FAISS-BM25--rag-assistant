The Innocent was the band Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails played with after leaving Option 30. He then moved on to the Exotic Birds before creating his own band, Nine Inch Nails. The other members were Alan Greenblatt (as Alan Greene), Kevin Valentine, Rodney Cajka (as Rodney Psyka) and Albritton McClain. Valentine and McClain were both members of Donnie Iris and the Cruisers, and they had just recently opted to go on their own way from the band.  The band's sole album was released on the regional Red Label Records.

After releasing their only album, Livin' in the Street, Reznor left the band. He joined Exotic Birds and contributed to the local band Slam Bamboo, before eventually forming Nine Inch Nails.
