History

2006–2007: Launch and early years

On 24 April 2006, which was coincidentally the day Nick Jr. Too was also launched, Cartoon Network Too was launched on Sky. It also became available on SCTV Digital when that service became available in 2006, along with Cartoon Network and Boomerang. Cartoon Network Too aired from 3am to 7pm, sharing a broadcast frequency with TCM 2, from TCM.

During its early months, Cartoon Network Too mainly broadcast older shows from Cartoon Network's library, such as Dexter's Laboratory, The Powerpuff Girls, Johnny Bravo, Wacky Races, and Cow and Chicken. alongside then-currently-running shows like Ed, Edd n Eddy, The Cramp Twins, and Courage the Cowardly Dog.

After this period, the channel transitioned to a "Modern-Classics" format, airing many currently-running Cartoon Network shows alongside programmes airing on Boomerang, and occasional older programming.

Introduction of Cartoonito block
Starting from September 2006, Cartoon Network Too gave up 9 of its 16 hours of programming a day for Cartoonito as a programming block from 6am until 3pm. Cartoon Network Too's airtime remained 3am to 7pm, however the actual programming from Cartoon Network Too only aired between 3 and 6am then from 3 until 7pm, as the remaining hours contained Cartoonito's programming.

2007–2012: Cartoon Network Too as a 24 hour channel
On 2 May 2007, Turner announced that Cartoon Network Too would be expanded to a full 24-hour slot beginning on 24 May and merge with Toonami, taking its slot. This would allow the channel to begin broadcasting on Virgin Media in addition to Sky, as well as to allow a standalone Cartoonito channel to launch in the channel's original slot on Sky. To prepare for the merger, viewers were given three weeks of notice.

On 23 May 2007 at 7pm, the old version of Cartoon Network Too closed for the last time. Then, on the early hours of 24 May 2007, at 3am, Toonami shut down permanently and Cartoon Network Too was moved into its slot, while the standalone Cartoonito channel launched in Cartoon Network Too's original time-shared-with-TCM2 slot.

In June 2007, Cartoon Network Too became available on Top Up TV Anytime, which is a video-on-demand service. However, in June 2009, it was removed, but Cartoon Network continues to be accessible via Top Up TV Anytime. In June 2010, Cartoon Network Too was removed from SCTV Digital as a result of that service going into administration.

2012–2014: Relaunch as an action-focused channel
In May 2012, Cartoon Network Too's logo was changed in line with the already updated main logo of Cartoon Network, and transitioned it's programming to a more male-focused audience, with a heavier focus on action-adventure programming such as Ben 10: Alien Force and Star Wars: The Clone Wars. The channel also began to be verbally referred to as CN TOO. During overnight hours, usually between midnight and 6am, it also aired some shows which are no longer being produced, and are no longer in high demand (i.e. Skatoony).

2014: Closure
On 1 April 2014, Cartoon Network Too was shut down, the final programme on Cartoon Network Too was an episode of Skatoony, followed by promos of what was airing on Cartoon Network, then a bumper following into a clip of Cartoon Network's promotional content from 2007, which was shown incomplete as Cartoon Network +1 was relaunched into Cartoon Network Too's channel space.
