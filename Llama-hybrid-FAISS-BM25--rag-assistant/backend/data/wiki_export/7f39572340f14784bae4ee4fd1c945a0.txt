Regina, Saskatchewan has a rich cultural life in music, theatre and dance, amply supported by the substantial fine arts constituency at the University of Regina, which has a large fine arts department including faculties of music and theatre. At various times this has attracted notable artistic talent: Donald M. Kendrick and Joe Fafard have been particular stars.

Live theatre

Regina Little Theatre, mounting amateur drama performances, "is the oldest continuously producing English-language theatre in western Canada,...[having been] established in the spring of 1926." Its "first public presentation was Officer 666, staged at the Grand Theatre in February 1927. Darke Hall having opened on College Avenue, the Little Theatre operated there and in high schools "until the Regina Performing Arts Centre opened at Angus Street and 4th Avenue in 1989." Productions continued in Darke Hall and local high schools until the Regina Performing Arts Centre opened at Angus Street and 4th Avenue in 1989. The Globe Theatre, was founded in 1966 as "Saskatchewan's first professional theatre since 1927." and since 1981 has operated in the Prince Edward Building (old City Hall, previously the Regina Post Office), a heritage building on 11th Avenue and Scarth Street.

Music
The Regina Symphony Orchestra (Canada's oldest continuously performing orchestra) performs in the Saskatchewan Centre of the Arts (now the Conexus Arts Centre). Concerts and recitals are performed both by local and visiting musicians in the Centre of the Arts and assorted other auditoriums including at the University of Regina and in church buildings.

Multiculturalism

The Regina Multicultural Council (RMC) was established in 1973 as a successor to the Regina Folk Arts Council and the Regina Folk Arts and Cultural Council. Operating as a non-profit organization, the RMC acts as an umbrella organization for over 60 member groups that represent approximately 45,000 people.

The aims of the council are:

To further the development and promotion of the cultures and folk arts of all ethno cultural groups;
To promote co-operation and mutual understanding among these groups;
To promote multiculturalism; and
To promote and retain heritage languages and cultural traditions as essential components of multiculturalism.

To meet these aims the RMC organizes and participates in a number of activities, of which the best known is Mosaic.
