History 

The congregation was first established in 1928 at 563 Christie Street. Its original name was the Hillcrest Congregation. The congregation moved to 840 St. Clair Avenue West in 1937, beginning, as many congregations both Jewish and Christian have done, by constructing a basement space, today the social hall, but first used as a worship space. The building was finally completed in 1947.

The congregation moved to its present building, 470 Glencairn Avenue, in 1966. Around 2005, the mechitza in the building's sanctuary was raised; the wood-and-glass mechitza now rises  above the women's section. Around 2010, part of the building was renovated. The board of directors plans to renovate the rest of the building once it raises the required funds.
