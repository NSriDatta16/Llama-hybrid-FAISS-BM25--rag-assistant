Ultra Records is an American record label owned by Sony Music Entertainment, which is a subsidiary of Sony Corporation of America. The record label has helped in bringing emerging artists and music genres into the mainstream spotlight. Established in 1995 in New York City by Patrick Moxey, a former executive of PolyGram and Virgin Records, Ultra Records has served as a creative hub for numerous highly successful electronic music artists. Among them are  names such as MK, Benny Benassi, Armin van Buuren, Steve Aoki, David Guetta, Calvin Harris, Black Coffee, deadmau5, Carnage, Deorro, Kygo, Tiësto, Kaskade, Louis the Child, Sofi Tukker, and Anabel Englund.

In 2012, Ultra entered a global partnership with Sony Music.
In December 2021, Sony Music fully acquired Ultra Records from Patrick Moxey.
In January 2022, David Waxman, previously Head of A&R and General Manager, was appointed President of Ultra Records. While the acquisition brought about changes, Ultra Records’ mission to provide electronic music to a broad audience has remained.
