The UK Code of Non-broadcast Advertising, Sales Promotion and Direct Marketing (CAP Code) is the rule book for non-broadcast advertisements, sales promotions and direct marketing communications in the United Kingdom. It is written and maintained by the Committee of Advertising Practice (CAP) and administered by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). The 12th edition of the CAP Code came into force in September 2010.

The 12th version was released because the digital remit of the ASA  was to be extended to cover online marketing communications, for example banner advertising, popup windows, pay-per-click campaigns, social media and online video. Website owners were given a 6-month period of grace to ensure that their websites and online marketing comply with the new CAP Code rules. The rules came into full force on 1 March 2011.
