Early life and education
He was born to Frank Gero (1929–2014), a former theater actor and stage manager who later became a producer, and Woji Gero who worked alongside her husband in the production business in the mid-1950s. He attended Harvard University in the early 1970s graduating with a BA in Writing & Film-making.

Television work
In 1995 Gerolmo wrote and directed the acclaimed made-for-TV movie Citizen X, about the russian serial killer Andrei Chikatilo. Gerolmo's screenplay for Citizen X — based on the book The Killer Department by Robert Cullen – earned him an Emmy nomination, a Writers Guild of America Award, and an Edgar Award.

He also co-created with Steven Bochco the FX Networks military drama series Over There. He also wrote and performed the title song.

He was a consulting producer on The Bridge, an American police drama on the FX network, based on a 2011 police drama series co-produced in Denmark and Sweden.
