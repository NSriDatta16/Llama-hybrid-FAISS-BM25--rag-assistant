Palair Macedonian Airlines () was the national flag carrier of Republic of Macedonia (now North Macedonia) operating from Skopje and Ohrid Airports.

History

During the fall of Yugoslavia, and the establishment of an Independent Macedonian republic in the early nineties, Palair Macedonian airlines was created.
Their fleet began with a Tupolev Tu-154 but was soon followed by a leased Fokker F-28 and F-100, the planes were first in white and red, and later all red with yellow text.
When the UN dropped sanctions against Yugoslavia in 1996, Yugoslav national airline JAT Yugoslav Airlines restarted operations, leading to a drastic drop in Palair's passenger numbers.  Palair Macedonian ceased operations in September 1996.
