History 

The district was historically an important trade route location due to its proximity to Iran.

From the 1810s to Sayfo in 1915, the entire population of around the Great Zab was East Syriac Assyrian whose main occupation was agriculture that consisted of wheat, barley, cotton and tea. The local Assyrian population were descendants of people who found refuge among Kurds from the Golden Horde in the early fifteenth century. 

Traveller Soane visisted the district in 1910, describing the area as 'one of the most inaccessible of the many sealed corners of this mountain country'. After the genocide, Assyrian villages were subsequently populated by Kurds.

In 1936, the name of the district was Turkified to .
