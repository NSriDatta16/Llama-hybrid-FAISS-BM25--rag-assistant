The Park Stakes is a Group 2 flat horse race in Great Britain open to horses aged three years or older. It is run at Doncaster over a distance of 7 furlongs and 6 yards (1,414 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in September.

History
The event was established in 1978 and it used to be sponsored by Kiveton Park Steel. For a period the Kiveton Park Stakes was classed at Listed level and contested over 7 furlongs. It was promoted to Group 3 status in 1986, and extended to a mile in 1993. The word "Kiveton" was removed from its title in 1996.

The race reverted to 7 furlongs in 2003, and it was upgraded to Group 2 in 2004.

The Park Stakes is held during Doncaster's four-day St. Leger Festival. It is currently run on the final day, the same day as the St Leger Stakes.
