Westlake High School is a comprehensive public high school located in unincorporated Fulton County, Georgia (with an Atlanta mailing address) and is accredited by the Georgia Department of Education and Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. The academic growth rate for Westlake students was higher than 95% of schools in the state and was above the state average in college readiness in 2019.

History
As a part of the Fulton County School System consolidation plan, Westlake was formed in 1988 by the closing of Westwood and Lakeshore High Schools. The new school used the old Westwood facility until 2008, when Westlake moved into a new state-of-the-art school next to the old campus. Feeder schools include Sandtown Middle School and Camp Creek Middle School.

In the 2012-13 school year, the school received favorable media coverage when CNN's HLN news broadcast a feature segment on then Westlake principal Dr. Grant Rivera and his efforts in engaging students, parents, and faculty in achieving academic and extra-curricular success in today's challenging social environment.

In 2016 the old campus was used for exterior and interior shots for the Lionsgate film, Middle School: The Worst Years of My Life.

In 2020  Principal Jamar Robinson and his wife both drowned while on vacation.

Magnet program
Westlake's Math/Science Magnet Program prepares students for the academic and career fields of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) through rigorous instruction, relevant experiences, and supportive relationships.

Goals
The magnet program at Westlake seeks to provide an academically rigorous foundation for math, science, engineering, and media-based careers. Students are exposed to courses that offer real-world problems and inquiry-based instruction. The program develops partnerships with universities and businesses so that students have access to relevant instructional and internship experiences in medical science, engineering, and media. Students are also encouraged to participate in academic, athletic, and artistic extracurricular activities that support their achievement.

Magnet programs of study
Westlake's magnet program is modeled after college programs in medical science, engineering, and computer science. Each course of study has associated extracurricular clubs and teams, as well as junior and senior summer research internship opportunities available at both Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University. Students attend monthly forums with guest speakers from college and industry on topics ranging from college planning to careers.

New facility
Construction for a new Westlake facility began in October 2006 and the facility officially opened in August 2008, housing over 2,500 high school students in 99 classrooms. The architectural firm of Gardner, Spencer, Smith, Tench & Jarbeau, P.C. designed the new building while H.J. Russell & Company handled the initial phase of construction. The school had previously been housed in the old Westlake High School building since its opening in 1988. Prior to 1988, the building housed Westwood High School. The MTV show Finding Carter was filmed at the older facility, adjacent to the new one.
