Barry Manilow is the debut album by Barry Manilow, released initially in 1973 by Bell Records.

The original release was unsuccessful, with only around 35,000 copies sold by 1975. After the success of Manilow's second album Barry Manilow II, the album was re-released as Barry Manilow I in 1975 by Arista that had taken over Bell Records. Four songs of the original album were reworked for this version, including "Could It Be Magic" which served as the single for the re-release. The re-released album was certified gold by the RIAA in 1976 for over half a million copies sold.

Record World called the single "Sweet Water Jones" an "Elton John-ish number...about splitting the city for country."
