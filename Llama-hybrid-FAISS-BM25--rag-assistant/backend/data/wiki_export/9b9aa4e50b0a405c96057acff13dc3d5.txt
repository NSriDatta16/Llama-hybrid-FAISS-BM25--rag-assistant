Media

In April 2013, HeroesAndHeartbreakers.com broke the news that Day's Crossfire series had been optioned for television adaptation. Lions Gate Entertainment secured the rights. Kevin Beggs, President of the Lionsgate Television Group, confirmed the acquisition on August 5, 2013 in a press release. Lionsgate TV Executive Vice President Chris Selak, who was to oversee development for the studio, said, "The Crossfire series is an incredible property and it is a thrill to bring it to Lionsgate. Sylvia has created an enduring, sexy and edgy story, and we're looking forward to working with her to create a show that both excites and connects with audiences as her books have done." However, Day declined a third renewal of the option and the rights have reverted to her.

In June 2017, startup streaming entertainment company Passionflix began production of Day's Afterburn/Aftershock film adaptation. Principal photography concluded on July 29, 2017. The film debuted in November 2017.

Beyond Words: Sylvia Day, a documentary covering the world tour supporting the release of Day’s One with You, was released on October 9, 2018.
