Situation
The gang consisted of five boys – Graham, William, Lux, Robert and Keith – and one girl, Mildred. Plots often revolved around the boys trying to exclude Mildred, who would often use her influential family to try to force herself back into the gang. Graham's leadership of the gang was constantly threatened by William, whereas Robert and Keith were always on the verge of fighting. Lux tended to be slow on the uptake, usually a couple of steps behind the rest of the gang's plans.  In the second series the gang were joined by a new character, Denise, who was Lux's girlfriend. The gang featured on an episode of Blue Peter just prior to transmission of the first series.
