Production 

During the making of Sivakasi, AVM Productions approached Perarasu to make a film with Ajith Kumar in the lead role. The director immediately accepted the offer and told the film's story to the producer during the meeting. The film was announced publicly two days later. In August 2005, it became clear that the film would begin in November and that Riyaz Khan would play the lead antagonist role in the project. Sadha was signed on to play the lead female role. The film was launched officially on 15 September 2005 with Vijay attending the opening ceremony.

For the film, Ajith lost 18kgs in 55 days by being on a liquid diet and lost the weight he had sported on screen in his previous films. The art director erected the set of a village in Prasad Studios in December 2005 including a shopping place, a big temple and an 80Â ft statue of Lord Shiva. In early 2006, Asin was approached to appear in an song, but she refused and Laila eventually took the role.
