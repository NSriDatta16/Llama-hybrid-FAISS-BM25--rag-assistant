The De La Salle Green Archers (also known simply as the Green Archers) are the men's varsity teams representing De La Salle University in the Philippines. The women's varsity teams are generally referred to as the De La Salle Lady Archers. The school's varsity teams participate in the University Athletic Association of the Philippines, among others. La Salle is represented in the high school level by De La Salle Zobel, and are known as the Zobel Junior Archers.

Athletic history

In 1924, De La Salle College (DLSC) became a pre-war founding member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Irish-American Br. Celba John Lynam, FSC organized the first De La Salle sports teams. The Irish colors of Green and White were chosen as the official La Salle colors; Green was inspired by the national color of Ireland, where the original founding fathers of the De La Salle Christian Brothers originated from, while White represents the Philippines as the Pearl of the Orient Seas. The pre-war NCAA was the first and oldest collegiate athletic association in the Philippines composed of De La Salle College, San Beda College, University of the Philippines, University of Santo Tomas, Institute of Accounts (now as Far Eastern University), National University, Ateneo de Manila and University of Manila.

The De La Salle basketball players were first referred to as the Green Archers during the basketball games of NCAA Season 16 (1939–40), where De La Salle made its way to the finals and won against eventual archrival Ateneo in an upset for its first basketball championship title in the seniors' division of the NCAA. Accordingly, the news reporters who were covering De La Salle games at that time coined the team the "Green Archers" due in part to the De La Salle players' accurate shooting skills. The De La Salle Alumni Association (DLSAA) has three official Green Archer mascots – Gordo, Flaco, and Sally. The DLSU Green Archer statue standing in the central plaza was done by Ed Castrillo in 1985. It was first exhibited during the celebration of the Diamond Jubilee in 1986. The Green Archer is the traditional university mascot and the varsity teams of De La Salle University are collectively referred to as the Green Archers, however, each team has a specific moniker depending on what sport they play.

De La Salle participated in the NCAA for 57 years until the 1980–81 NCAA Season winning five NCAA General Championships in the process (1972–73, 1974–75, 1976–77, 1977–78, and 1980–81). La Salle announced its decision to withdraw from the NCAA in September 1980. The high school (juniors' division) counterpart were the Greenies from De La Salle College High School until 1968 when the then-high school in Taft Avenue, Manila was phased out and transferred to the La Salle Green Hills (LSGH) campus in Ortigas Avenue, Mandaluyong City, Metro Manila. The Greenies had won two General Championships under DLSC. La Salle Green Hills was established in 1959 and was eventually made the high school counterpart of De La Salle College, and inherited the Greenies moniker. LSGH won eight NCAA General Championships until 1981 when La Salle withdrew from the NCAA.

From 1981 through 1985 the school participated in the Philippine Integrated Colleges and Universities Athletic Association (PICUAA), invitational meets, Interclub tournaments, and the National Open. De La Salle University (DLSU) then joined the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP) in 1986. La Salle chose the newly-established De La Salle Zobel (DLSZ) as their UAAP Juniors counterpart and adopted the Junior Archers moniker. LSGH was later asked by De La Salle–College of Saint Benilde to compete as their high school junior team in the NCAA when it applied and was accepted in 1998. Ever since joining the UAAP in 1986, DLSU has won three UAAP General Championships – Season 75 (2012–13), Season 76 (2013–14), and Season 78 (2015–16), giving the university a combined eight General Championship titles in the seniors' division in the NCAA and UAAP. Notable Lasallian athletes and alumni are inducted into the DLSAA Sports Hall of Fame.

Enrique M. Razon Sports Center
The Enrique M. Razon Sports Center is a 10-story building that is the main sports facility of De La Salle University. The Sports Center was built in 1998 to replace the old Brother Athanasius Sports Complex which was demolished in 2000 to give way for the construction of the Don Enrique T. Yuchengco Hall. The Sports Center stands on a  lot located at the corner of Fidel Reyes (formerly named Agno) and Noli Streets. It has an Olympic-sized pool and track and field oval with a balcony. It has basketball and volleyball courts, table tennis courts, a dance and martial arts studio, and weight training rooms. The sixth floor of the building is the location of the George T. Yang Performing Arts Studios. The sixth floor also houses the Gold's Gym Taft branch, which opened in late 2016.
