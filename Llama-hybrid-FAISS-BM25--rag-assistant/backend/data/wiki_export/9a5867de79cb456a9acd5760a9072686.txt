The Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004 (c. 19) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It set various rules for immigrants to the United Kingdom. In 2006, section 19 of the Act was declared to be incompatible with the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms under section 4 of the Human Rights Act 1998.

Section 19 dealt the problem of so-called "sham marriages", where immigrants marry British citizens merely to gain leave to stay. In a case heard by the High Court of Justice in 2006, Mr Justice Stephen Silber ruled that as the section made an exemption for marriages held in the Anglican church, it discriminated against non-Anglicans.

Section 48 - Commencement
Section 48(2) provides that section 32(1) has effect in relation to determinations of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission made after the end of the period of two months that began on the date on which this Act was passed. The word "months" means calendar months. The day (that is to say, 22 July 2004) on which the Act was passed (that is to say, received royal assent) is included in the period of two months. This means that section 32(1) has effect in relation to determinations of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission made after 22 September 2004.
