Featured articles
Bengtsson has produced many featured articles, but is best known for his coverage of Turkey's invasion of Cyprus and his coining of "ghost town" to describe Famagusta in 1974.

In Sweden's newspaper, iDAG, Bengtsson wrote a series of three articles in March 1990 about UN Commissioner for Namibia, Bernt Carlsson, who died when Pan Am Flight 103 was sabotaged over Lockerbie, Scotland on 21 December 1988.

The articles alleged Carlsson had been persuaded by apartheid South Africa into joining PA 103 at the last minute at Heathrow, instead of taking a flight, as intended, direct from Brussels to New York.  These articles subsequently formed the basis of one of the conspiracy theories surrounding Pan Am Flight 103.
