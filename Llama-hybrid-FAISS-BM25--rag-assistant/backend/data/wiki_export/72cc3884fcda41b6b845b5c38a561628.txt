Production logos 
Every episode of Robot Chicken from seasons 1â€“4 displays one of many still Stoopid Monkey production logos following the credits; each depicts a cartoon monkey performing an obviously foolish or life-threatening activity or the aftermath of suicide as an irritated Seth Green is heard saying, "Stupid monkey." Each Stoopid Monkey card was drawn by artist and actor Adam Talbott.  All of them except for the first part  
of "Book of Corrine" have the name with an exclamation point replacing the "I" in a jumbled white font surrounded by a thick black border, as well as a smaller white border around that, and Talbott's signature somewhere on the logo. On Titan Maximum and early episodes of Robot Chicken'''s fifth season, the logo is the monkey's shining silver head smiling with the shining Stoopid Monkey text below it. On later episodes of Robot Chicken'' from season 5 onward, the logo returned to a similar concept as the first, but the titular monkey was redesigned to be cuter, despite in season 7 a still variant showcasing only the company logo was used.
