Shark Ray breeding program 
The shark ray breeding program is one of the first of its kind, with two sharks, Sweet Pea and Scooter, having produced offspring.  However, the process is difficult due to the tendency of shark rays to engage in "rough sex", which resulted in the death of one of the new females at the time.  Currently, the aquarium has four adult shark rays on exhibit.

Outreach programs 
Mobile Shark Cart is a mobile cart that is taken offsite to bring awareness to shark protection and ocean conservation.

WAVE program is a program that promotes the importance of ocean conservation, leadership, and STEM to youth. Individuals can go behind the scenes with a staff member and see how the aquarium works and learn about the conservation programs and species at the aquarium.

Seasonal events 
Mermaid's Cove is an interactive event, in which guests see and talk to mermaids about ocean conservation in the Shark Ray Bay Theater and Coral Reef tank. This event is normally scheduled during September.

Scuba Santa appears between the end of November through January 1 each year, excluding Christmas Day. He can be seen in the shark tank with his elves.

Albino alligators 
Albino alligators, Snowflake and Snowball, returned to Newport in 2014. They are about six feet long and weigh between 65 and 85 pounds. There are fewer than 100 albino alligators known in the world today, and this is due to poor blending in with their natural environment and their sensitivity UV rays.

Mighty Mike 
Mighty Mike, the 14 foot and 800 pound American alligator, left the aquarium in September 2018. He was the biggest alligator outside of Florida. After spending five years on loan to Newport Aquarium, he was returned to Florida's Crocodilian Conservation Center. Additionally, he was kept at the aquarium's Alligator Alley.
