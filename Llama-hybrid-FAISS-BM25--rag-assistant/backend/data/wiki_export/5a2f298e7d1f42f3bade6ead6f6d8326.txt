Robinson was born in Garfield, New Jersey. She has two daughters, Kura and Amaya.

Early life and career
Robinson, raised in Garfield, New Jersey, toured as the vocalist for euro-dance group Snap! in 1990-91, replacing studio vocalist Penny Ford in the group’s live shows. Robinson gained worldwide success in the early to mid-1990s with the Italian house group Livin' Joy as the lead singer before going solo in 1999. After Robinson left, Livin' Joy scored more hits during the 1995–1996 period with singer Tameko Star. However, the biggest remains "Dreamer", an international hit reaching number 1 in the UK and the top 10 in many other European countries. It has since been certified platinum, selling over 600,000 copies in the UK alone. Robinson had previously worked with the Livin' Joy producers on two singles, "Children" and "Sweetest Day of May". On Livin' Joy's Don't Stop Movin, her vocals do not appear on any tracklisted songs, until the original "Dreamer" appears as a hidden track at the very end. Her subsequent solo debut album The Color Within Me was an earthy, more pop styled album and was released in 1999 to largely favorable reviews, scoring a minor pop hit with the single "Nothing I Would Change". In 2000, Robinson performed on the drama Charmed, in the episode "Animal Pragmatism".

In 2000, she toured America as an opening act for Tina Turner's U.S. leg of her world tour alongside Lionel Richie. Turner picked Robinson to open for her after hearing her album The Color Within Me, in which Robinson has described Turner as her “fairy godmother”.  

Robinson's biggest hit with Livin' Joy was reissued with new production, and new vocals and Robinson was credited for her work on it this time. "Dreamer '05" became a hit making the top five of the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. Her dance single, "Earthbeat" is featured on the compilation Pride 1998, mixed and produced by Julian Marsh. Robinson took a long hiatus and had two daughters and to care for her ill parents.

In 2015, Robinson released "There Must Be Love" in collaboration with David Morales; the track was well received, particularly in Italy, and reached the Billboard Dance Charts. In 2017, she released the single "Father".  

In 2018, Robinson returned to the stage on The X Factor UK as a contestant surprising the judging panel with the revelation that she was the voice and songwriter behind the international dance track "Dreamer". She successfully made it to the live shows as part of the Over 29s category mentored by Ayda Field and was the third contestant eliminated.

In 2019, Robinson spent the spring and summer touring the UK and abroad. On August 1, she released a new single titled "Freedom", teaming up with DJ David Morales once again. 

In 2021, Robinson continued working on a documentary about her life, alongside performing across the UK and abroad. 

In 2022, Robinson announced that she was continuing to work on her documentary about her life story. On 8 January, she announced on BBC Radio 2 that new music is in the works.The first single called "Essex Girls" with British rappers who used the verse of "Dreamer" was released in January on Warner Records and a brand new new version of "Dreamer" was released in February 2022 with DJ Salvatore Lodato on Spinnin Records. Robinson said she was "excited to reach a whole new generation" of fans who love her music. She also released "Love Comes Once in Your Life" with OMG Collective. In July 2023, she teamed up with OMG Collective once again with ‘Just A Little Love’. Robinson has toured alongside Ministry Of Sound Classical at sold out shows across the UK from 2019-2023, including two shows at Royal Albert Hall in London.
