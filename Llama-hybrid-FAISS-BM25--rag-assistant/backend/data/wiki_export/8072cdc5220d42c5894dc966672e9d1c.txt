Iain George William Dunn (born 1 April 1970) is an English former professional footballer who played as a winger in the Football League for York City, Chesterfield, Huddersfield Town and Scunthorpe United.

Early life
Iain George William Dunn was born on 1 April 1970 in York, where he was raised.

Career
Whilst in his second spell at Chesterfield he helped them reach the FA Cup semi-final in 1997, playing as a substitute in the quarter-final tie against Wrexham. However, he did not play in the semi-final, in which Chesterfield lost to Middlesbrough after a replay.

Dunn was the first player in British football to score a golden goal. He achieved this feat in the Football League Trophy for Huddersfield Town versus Lincoln City on 30 November 1994. Huddersfield won 3â€“2 in extra time. Dunn was later presented with a commemorative trophy.

Always a cult figure, Dunn polarised fans' opinions; despite this he was voted Huddersfield Town's all-time cult hero by the club's fans in an August 2004 poll for the BBC's Football Focus programme, and was included in the fans' all-time 100 favourite players.

Personal life
Dunn is currently a street environment officer for City of York Council.

Since 2017, Dunn has been a match summariser on BBC Radio York's York City match commentary.
