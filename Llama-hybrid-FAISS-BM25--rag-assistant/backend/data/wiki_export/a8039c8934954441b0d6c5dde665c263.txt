History
Prior to 1 January 1965, the village (and valley) were part of the municipality of Forsand.  This area was moved to Gjesdal because there was no road connection from Dirdal to the rest of Forsand, but there was a road connection to the rest of Gjesdal.

Dirdal was the scene of fierce fighting between Norwegian and German soldiers during Nazi Germany's assault on Norway (Operation Weserübung) in April 1940.
