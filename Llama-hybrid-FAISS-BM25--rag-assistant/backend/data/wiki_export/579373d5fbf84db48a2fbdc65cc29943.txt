Kyung Won "K.W." Lee (Korean: 이경원; born June 1, 1928) is a Korean-American journalist who worked for mainstream daily publications in the continental United States. Lee is also the founding president of the Korean American Journalists Association.

Early life and education
Lee was born in 1928 in Kaesong, Japanese Korea and attended Korea University in Seoul, South Korea. In 1950, he immigrated to the United States and studied journalism at West Virginia University. After receiving a master's degree from the University of Illinois in 1955, he worked for daily newspapers such as the Kingsport Times-News in Tennessee and the Charleston Gazette in West Virginia. In 1960, he married Peggy Flowers of Bluefield, Virginia. A number of years were spent at the Sacramento Union in California, where he was in charge of investigative reporting and an internship program. He has won awards from the National Headliners Club, the AP News Executive Council, and the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism.

Career
Lee covered the civil rights struggles in the South in the early 1960s, massive vote-buying practices in southern West Virginia, and the plight of Appalachian coal miners. Lee is best known for writing an investigative series on the conviction of immigrant Chol Soo Lee for a 1973 San Francisco Chinatown gangland murder which became the basis of the 1989 film True Believer, starring James Woods and Robert Downey Jr. His series of 120 articles over five years led to a new trial, eventual acquittal and release of the prisoner from San Quentin's Death Row.

In 1979, Lee founded the Koreatown Weekly, the first national English-language Korean American newspaper. In 1990, during rising tensions between African Americans and Korean Americans, he launched and edited The Korea Times English Edition from Los Angeles, with an internship program for both Asian Americans and other minorities.
