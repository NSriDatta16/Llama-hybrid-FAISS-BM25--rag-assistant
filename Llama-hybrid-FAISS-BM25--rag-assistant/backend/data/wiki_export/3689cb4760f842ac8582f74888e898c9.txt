Jhazmyne's Lullaby is the only studio album from Milwaukee metalcore band 7 Angels 7 Plagues. The cover art is a nod to Miles Davis Volume 2.

Reception
According to AllMusic, Jhazmyne's Lullabye'' is a "powerful metalcore album that finds strength in solid lyrical content." In his review of the album, writer Kevin Stewart-Panko said the band "construct songs that hardcore kids will hurt themselves to without realising how much of a jazz influence goes into 7A7P's style and graphic design. They beat down the restrictive walls of what can go onto a hardcore record with the inclusion of piano Ã©tudes and acoustic guitar solos."
