Paul Moor (born 3 September 1978), of Kingston-upon-Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire, England is one of the world's leading ten-pin bowlers. He bowls on the European Bowling Tour (EBT) and has been a member of the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA) for several years.

Early years

Moor first started bowling at the age of 10 when he joined the Saturday morning Junior League at the AMF Bowling Centre in Hull.  His parents were league bowlers at the centre which was the main influence for him taking up the sport.  He enjoyed plenty of success in his latter years as a junior, winning many national titles.  He also teamed up with fellow Hull Bowler, Robert Batty and won a multitude of Doubles Titles including victories at the BTBA Junior Nationals at both Senior and Graduate level. He represented the Junior England Team in 1997 at the "European Youth Team Cup" in Annecy, France where he won a silver medal despite the team having the highest team average in the Championship.

After finishing his time in junior bowling Moor started to bowl more regularly on the Adult circuit in England and won his first English ranking event in 1999 at the AMF World Cup Qualifier, held in Nottingham.  Moor went on to represent England, making his first appearance at the AMF World Cup in Las Vegas but his lack of international experience did not help and he failed to qualify for the top 24.

Today

Moor is one of the top English bowlers on the European bowling scene along with Stuart Williams and Dominic Barrett.

Moor is currently ranked No.6 in Europe (2014 EBT rankings), is a 3-time winner, of the European Bowling Tour. (EBT)  and is a Commonwealth Championships double gold medallist.

Moor has 28 Perfect Games, a High 3 Games series of 857 and a high 6 Game Series of 1588.

In September 2014 Moor became the all-time leader on the EBT with 14 titles when he won the Chandra Open in The Netherlands, averaging 250 over 10 games in the final.  Two weeks later he won his 15th title with victory over Tommy Jones in the Columbia 300 Vienna Open.

On 11 January 2015, Moor won his record 16th EBT title in the Brunswick Ballmaster Open in Helsinki, Finland, defeating Finnish native Joonas Jehkinen in the final match, 225â€“204. Because Moor is now a PBA member, he also earned his first PBA title in this event and qualified to bowl in the PBA Tournament of Champions in February, 2015.
