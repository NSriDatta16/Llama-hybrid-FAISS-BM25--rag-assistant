Delicate Sound of Thunder is a concert film by Pink Floyd, filmed during their A Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour from 19 August 1988 to 23 August 1988 at the Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, New York, with some additional footage from 21–22 June 1988 at the Place d'Armes of the Château de Versailles, Versailles, France. It was initially released on VHS, Video CD and Laserdisc formats. The film was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video at the 32nd Annual Grammy Awards.

The film was reissued on DVD and Blu-ray in 2019 as part of The Later Years 1987–2019 box set. This version was fully re-edited, remastered and restored from the original 35 mm film, and featured the fully remixed audio from the 2019 CD album. On 20 November 2020, a standalone version of the 2019 edit of the film was released, along with a deluxe box set containing both the DVD and Blu-Ray discs, as well as the album on CD and a 40-page booklet.

The 2019 edit of the film now includes a full performance of "Shine On You Crazy Diamond", the original VHS only had the introduction to "Part 1" which was played over a montage of footage. "The Great Gig in the Sky" was originally presented in black and white, with some colour shots taken from the filmed performance at the Palace of Versailles. The new edit has no Versailles footage and is in full colour throughout. The closing credits originally showed a time-lapse of the stage being disassembled with "Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Parts 2-5)" playing – the 2019 version, however, has removed the time-lapse video and replaced it with a black screen accompanied by "Terminal Frost" as the credits music.

Although the film now includes "Money" in all regions, it is not the full performance. "Money" has been condensed in the same manner as the album version – eliminating Guy Pratt's bass solo and the female 'a cappella' section.
