Both villages belonged to the realm of the German Kingdom and previously to the Frankish Empire. During the 30 Year's War  both villages were burnt down by Spanish and Swedish invaders.
From 1797 on, Böhl and Iggelheim belonged to the French and the Palatinate part of Bavaria after which they came under the direction of the new city of Ludwigshafen.
