Burr and Burton Academy (BBA) is a private, non-profit, co-educational, day and boarding school in Manchester, Vermont, United States. It was established in 1829 through a bequest from local businessman Joseph Burr.

In addition to serving local students and families, BBA offers a boarding program for international students.

Admissions 
Burr and Burton Academy accepts all students from designated "sending towns," which vote annually to approve the school's tuition and pay the cost through education funding. Admission is also open on an annual basis to students from other, non-sending towns, as well as through BBA's International Program. 

Tuition for the 2022-23 school year is $19,200 for sending town students; $21,200 for non-sending town students; and $59,500 for boarding international students.
