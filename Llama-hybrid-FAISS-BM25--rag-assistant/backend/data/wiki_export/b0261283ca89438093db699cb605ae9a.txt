Song details
"To Forgive" was inspired by the personal appearance of Pope John Paul II with his attempted assassin, Mehmet Ali Agca, and the Pope's message.

"This Disco (Used To Be A Cute Cathedral)" was inspired by the Limelight, which was in operation from 1983 to 2003. It was once known as the "Episcopal Church of the Holy Communion."

Track "This Disco (Used to Be a Cute Cathedral)" later appeared on the Taylor releases Limelight, The Best We Could Find (+3 That Never Escaped), and Now the Truth Can Be Told, which came out in 1986, 1988, and 1994 respectively.
