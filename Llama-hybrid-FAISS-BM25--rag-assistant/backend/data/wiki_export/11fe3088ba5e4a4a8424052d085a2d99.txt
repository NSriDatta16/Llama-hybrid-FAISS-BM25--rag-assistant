Queen of Heaven is located at Wolf and Roosevelt Roads, near the Eisenhower Expressway (Interstate 290), and is adjacent to another Catholic cemetery, Mount Carmel Cemetery.

History
Queen of Heaven was consecrated in 1947.  The cemetery maintained its own office until 1965, when operations were combined with neighboring Mount Carmel Cemetery.  Currently, the cemetery is  in size, and there are currently over 122,451 people buried there.  There are approximately 3,215 annual interments at Queen of Heaven.

In addition to regular graves, Queen of Heaven was the first area cemetery to have religious shrine sections.  One of these is the "Shrine of the Holy Innocents," where young victims of the 1958 Our Lady of the Angels School Fire are interred.  In these sections families could purchase plots for all its members all at once, and not incur future charges.

The art in the west wing of the main building was carried out mostly by DaPrato Studios of Chicago, with an international array of artists/architectural designers,(including a few from the Chicago area) artists such as: Italo Botti, Angelo Gherardi (Italy/US), Urano Bottari (Italy/US), Laurence Campbell (Ireland), Professor Emeritus Peter Bagnolo (Oak Park, Illinois), and a number of others.
