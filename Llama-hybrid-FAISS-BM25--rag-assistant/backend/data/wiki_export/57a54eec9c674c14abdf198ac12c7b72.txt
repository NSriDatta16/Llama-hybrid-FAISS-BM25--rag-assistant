Etemaaad, which often criticized Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's administration, was loosely affiliated with the reformists. It had a high circulation and was widely seen as the most influential, semi-independent news source still allowed to publish.

Etemad, which was in its eighth year with a relatively high circulation of more than 100,000, was one of the most influential publications in Iran, especially among intellectuals. Behrooz Behzadi, editor-in-chief of the paper, told The Guardian: "The Press Supervisory Board shut down our paper without giving us even a specific reason. It's an absolutely arbitrary decision."

New period
Elias Hazrati, the manager of Etemad, said on 27 October 2010, that this newspaper was allowed to publish. The new period begins after nine months. The opposition publication is linked to former Parliament speaker Mehdi Karroubi, an outspoken opposition leader who challenged the government of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
