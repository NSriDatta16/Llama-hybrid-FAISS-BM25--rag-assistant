Mosterøy is a former municipality in Rogaland county, Norway.  The administrative centre was the village of Askje where the Askje Church is located.  The   municipality existed from 1884 until 1965. The island municipality included the islands of Mosterøy, Klosterøy, Fjøløy, Sokn, Bru, and the western half of Åmøy.  Today, Mosterøy is part of the municipality of Stavanger.

The Utstein Abbey, the best-preserved medieval monastery in Norway, is located on the island of Klosterøy.  It was one of the most notable historic sites in the municipality.

History

The municipality of Mosterøy was established on 1 July 1884 when it was split off from the large island municipality of Rennesøy. Initially, the new municipality had a population of 1,309. On 1 January 1923, the westernmost group of outlying islands of Kvitsøy were separated from Mosterøy to form a separate municipality Kvitsøy. The split left Mosterøy with 745 inhabitants. On 1 January 1965, many municipal mergers took place in Norway due to the recommendations of the Schei Committee. On that date, Mosterøy was merged back into the municipality of Rennesøy. Prior to the merger, Mosterøy had a population of 817.

Name
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the island of Mosterøy ( or ) since the first Utstein Church was built there. The meaning of the first element of the name is uncertain. One possibility is that it is a shortened version of the Latin word  which means "monastery", since the Utstein Abbey is located on the northwest end of the island. Another possibility is that it comes from the word  which means "mane". A third possibility is that it comes from the word  which means "ridge", likely referring to the  tall Mastravarden, the highest point on the island. The last element of the name is  which means "island". Historically, the name was spelled with the Danish ending Mosterø.
