The Royal Scots Borderers, 1st Battalion, the Royal Regiment of Scotland (1 SCOTS) was an infantry battalion of the Royal Regiment of Scotland.  The battalion formed on 1 August 2006 when its antecedent regiments - the Royal Scots and the King's Own Scottish Borderers - amalgamated just after the formation of the Royal Regiment of Scotland in 2006.  On 1 December 2021, the battalion transferred to the new Ranger Regiment as the 1st Battalion, Ranger Regiment (1 RANGERS).

History
When the Scottish infantry regiments amalgamated to form the Royal Regiment of Scotland on 28 March 2006, the Royal Scots and the King's Own Scottish Borderers initially maintained their identities as separate battalions; the 1st Battalion, Royal Scots became the Royal Scots Battalion and the 1st Battalion, King's Own Scottish Borderers became the King's Own Scottish Borderers Battalion. This was an interim arrangement, as the overall plan had always been to amalgamate the two into a single battalion.

This was not a new idea: the origins of the combined entity, Royal Scots Borderers, dates from the 1990 Options for Change review, when it was initially announced that the Royal Scots and King's Own Scottish Borderers would amalgamate. That amalgamation was subsequently rescinded. The Royal Scots Battalion and King's Own Scottish Borderers Battalion duly amalgamated on 1 August 2006 – upon their amalgamation, the new battalion took the name The Royal Scots Borderers, 1st Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland.

Since the amalgamation, the battalion has been deployed several times both to Iraq on Operation TELIC and to Afghanistan on Operation HERRICK, most recently to Afghanistan in September 2012 on HERRICK 17 as the Brigade Advisory Group and Operations Company. In September 2014, B Company deployed to Sierra Leone on Operation GRITROCK to help fight the outbreak of Ebola and in September 2015, the 1 SCOTS Battlegroup deployed on Operation TOSCA to Cyprus as part of the ongoing UN peacekeeping operations.

A written statement in December 2016 stated that it will be a Specialised Infantry battalion, reconfigured to provide an increased contribution to countering terrorism and building stability overseas.  Following this change of role, the battalion will be assigned to the Specialised Infantry Group. In October 2017 the battalion officially joined the Specialised Infantry Group, and are due to move to Aldershot Garrison.

Under the Defence in a Competitive Age programme, the battalion will help seed part of the new Ranger Regiment.

Uniform and traditions

Uniform 
The battalion wears a flat black hackle behind the Royal Regiment of Scotland cap badge on the TOS (Tam o' Shanter) to distinguish itself as the Royal Scots Borderers.

Recruiting & Links 
It recruits its soldiers from Dumfries and Galloway, Edinburgh, the Lothians, Borders and parts of Lanarkshire, which was traditionally the recruiting ground of the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) until they were disbanded in 1968. The battalion home headquarters and museums are based at Edinburgh Castle for the Royal Scots and Berwick for the King's Own Scottish Borderers.  A Company of 52nd Lowland, 6th Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland maintains an affiliation to the 1st Battalion.

Pipes and Drums

Role 
Pipes and Drums have been a staple for Scottish and Irish regiments.  1 SCOTS pipes and drums were divided into two 'sections': Drummers, led by the Drum Major, and the Pipes led by the Pipe Major.  Pipers and Drummers were classed as soldiers first and have an operational role in each battalion order of battle.

As part of the battalion's conversion into a 'Specialised Infantry battalion', the unit's pipes and drums were reduced to nil strength.  However, after much conversation and debate with senior army officials, it was decided to reform the platoon and move them to Redford Barracks in Edinburgh.  The P&Ds will now support public duties throughout Scotland, and can be deployed if needed.  After their move to Edinburgh, the pipes and drums began recruiting again, however its establishment was effectively in a 'black economy'.  Finally on 15 February 2021 the pipes and drums were formally disbanded and its personnel distributed to other battalions of the Royal Regiment of Scotland.

Uniform 
In short terms, because of their amalgamation, the pipers maintained the overall uniform of the Royal Scots (RS), while the drummers maintained the uniform of the King's Own Scottish Borderers (KOSB).  General uniform worn throughout: Royal Regiment of Scotland Capbadge, Blackcock feather SCOTS pattern: For PM, DM, and SNCOS: archer green barathea doublet with golden braided shoulder wings and gold Russia piping.  Wide gold braiding for PM and DM doublet.  For OR pipers and drummers; white braided shoulder wings and white Russia piping.  No medal ribbons.
