Background 
Bertrand Burgalat (born July 1963) is a French musician, composer and producer.

Work 
Burgalat is known for his 1960s-style pop sound, something he has lent to his production work with Air, April March, A.S Dragon, Cinnamon, Dalcan, Jad Wio, Mick Harvey, Louis Philippe and the French writer Michel Houellebecq. His musical influences include the "yé-yé" sound of French pop made famous by France Gall, Françoise Hardy and Brigitte Fontaine, as well as the singers Jacques Dutronc and Serge Gainsbourg, as well as the 'folk-music of the Ruhr' created by Kraftwerk.  Burgalat also draws inspiration from 20th century French classical composers such as Maurice Ravel, Francis Poulenc and Olivier Messiaen, and was greatly influenced by the writings of cult French journalist-cum-pop visionary Yves Adrien.

At the age of 25, he produced the Laibach's album Let It Be, which is a cover of The Beatles' album of the same name.

In 1995, Burgalat remixed and rearranged the Renegade Soundwave song "Positive Mindscape" (as "Positive BB") for release on the "Positive Dub Mixes" CD single. In 2001,  he mixed a new version of  Depeche Mode "Easy Tiger" instrumental song from the album Exciter, the B-side of the single "Dream On".

Tricatel 
In 1995, Burgalat established his own record label, Tricatel. Tricatel has downsized its activities over the past two years, concentrating on acts such as A.S. Dragon, new signing Les Shades, and Bertrand Burgalat himself, who is currently (January 2007) working on a follow-up to 'Portrait-Robot'. Other artists in the Tricatel catalogue include Swedish avant-pop trio Eggstone, The High Llamas, Ingrid Caven, and award-winning novelist Jonathan Coe, who teamed up with Louis Philippe and jazz pianist/double-bass player Danny Manners for the occasion. Bertrand Burgalat picked the name "Tricatel" from a successful French comedy of the 1970s, L'Aile ou la Cuisse, starring Louis de Funès and Coluche.
