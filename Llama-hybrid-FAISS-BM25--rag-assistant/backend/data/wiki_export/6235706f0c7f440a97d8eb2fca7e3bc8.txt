The median antebrachial vein is a superficial vein of the (anterior) forearm. It arises from - and drains - the superficial palmar venous arch, ascending superficially along the anterior forearm before terminating by draining into either the basilic vein and/or median cubital vein; it may bifurcate distal to the elbow and proceed to drain into both aforementioned veins. A bifurcation of the median antebrachial vein produces the (medial) intermediate basilic vein and the (lateral) intermediate cephalic vein; the two veins produced by such a split may replace the median cubital vein.
