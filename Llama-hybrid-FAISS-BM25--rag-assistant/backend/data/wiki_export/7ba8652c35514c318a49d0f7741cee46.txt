History 

In the 19th century, Vedeno was the last capital of the Caucasian Imamate, an Islamic territory which existed in the territory of Dagestan and Chechnya from 1829 to 1859.

In the mid-19th century, Imam Shamil led his guerrilla army in a twenty-year war against the Imperial Russian army and fought a last stand in Vedeno. The village was captured by Russian forces on 1 April 1859. As a result, a fortress was built in the village. During the Russian Empire, the settlement was the administrative capital of the Vedensky Okrug of the Terek Oblast.

From September 1919 to March 1920, the village was the capital of the North Caucasian Emirate, an Islamic state which appeared in the territory of Chechnya and western Dagestan. Money was printed for the emirate in Vedeno. There were several different types of paper used for the money, including pages from school books.

In 1944, after the genocide and deportation of the Chechen and Ingush people and the Chechen-Ingush ASSR was abolished, Vedeno was one of the very few villages which was not renamed and had its original name preserved. However, on 7 June 1944, the Vedensky District was transferred to the Dagestan ASSR, with Vedeno as the administrative center.

In 1957, after the Vaynakh people returned from the deportation, Vedensky District returned to the restored Chechen-Ingush ASSR with Vedeno as the district center.

During the First Chechen War, Vedeno was under the control of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria until 3 June 1995, when it was taken by Russian troops, who controlled it until the end of the war.

During the Second Chechen War, on 17 November 1999, the Russian troops suffered their first losses in the mountain village. The 31st Separate Airborne Brigade lost 12 paratroopers in a battle here. Vedeno was taken again by Russian troops on 11 January 2000.

In August 2001, separatists engaged in a battle with Russian troops in the village, during which the military commandant's office was attacked.

In March 2006, more battles took place in the vicinity of Vedeno. More than 3,000 Chechen police and OMON units were sent there, and were opposed by the units of Shamil Basayev and Dokku Umarov.
