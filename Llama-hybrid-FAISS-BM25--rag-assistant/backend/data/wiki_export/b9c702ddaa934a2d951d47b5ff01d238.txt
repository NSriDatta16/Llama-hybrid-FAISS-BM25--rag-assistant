Everything's Alright Forever is the second album by English indie rock band the Boo Radleys, released in 1992.

Background
The Boo Radleys released their debut studio album Ichabod and I in 1990. After recording a session for the BBC in July 1990, Rob Cieka replaced drummer Steve Hewitt. By November 1990, they had signed to Rough Trade Records, with whom they issued the Kaleidoscope, Every Heaven and Bo Up! EP, becoming minor hits on the UK Independent Albums Chart. After Rough Trade had collapsed in 1991, the band signed to Creation Records.

Release
Soon afterward joining Creation Records, the band issued the Adrenalin EP, ahead of the release of Everything's Alright Forever. "Does This Hurt?"	was released as a single in June 1992. Through frequent live performances, including a US tour with Sugar, and attention from the press, the band's profile rose.

Critical reception

Newsday called Everything's Alright Forever a "rewarding journey through light and dark, acoustic serenity brushing against pure white noise." The Calgary Herald determined that "buried beneath several coats of mind-gliding guitar are some of the catchiest pop songs this side of Teenage Fanclub."

The Rough Guide to Rock wrote that the album was "clear evidence that the band were developing" and that it contained "excellent pop tunes behind the array of effects pedals." Author Dave Thompson, in his book Alternative Rock (2000), wrote that the band "swirl, twirl, and at times outright buzz, it's all a bit of a Blur-y Ride, but the pure pop-to-be still shines through."

Track listing

Early copies of the vinyl edition came with a free 7" single Sunfly.
