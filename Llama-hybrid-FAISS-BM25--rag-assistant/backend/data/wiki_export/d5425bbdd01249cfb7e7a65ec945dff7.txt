There are multiple theorems named after the French mathematician Camille Jordan:

The Jordan curve theorem states that every simple closed curve has a well-defined "inside" and "outside";
Jordan's lemma is a bound for the error term in applications of the residue theorem;
Jordan's theorem on group actions characterizes primitive groups containing a large -cycle; and
The Jordanâ€“Schur theorem is an effective proof (in terms of the degree) that linear torsion groups are virtually abelian.
