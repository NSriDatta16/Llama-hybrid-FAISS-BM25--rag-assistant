The Fitzgibbon Cup () is the trophy for the premier hurling championship among higher education institutions (universities, colleges and institutes of technology) in Ireland.

The Fitzgibbon Cup competition is administered by Comhairle Ard Oideachais Cumann Lúthchleas Gael (CLG), the GAA's Higher Education Council. Comhairle Ard Oideachais also oversees the Ryan Cup (tier 2 hurling championship), the Fergal Maher Cup (tier 3 hurling championship) and the Padraig MacDiarmada (tier 4 hurling championship).

The GAA Higher Education Cups are sponsored by Electric Ireland.

History 
[[File:Fitzgibbon Cup 1910's.jpg|thumb|350px|The Fitzgibbon Cup'' donated by The Rev Fr Edwin Fitzgibbon O.S.F.C. (Order of Saints Francis and Clare, a Franciscan religious order) for Inter-Collegiate Hurling competition. The silver cup was made by Messrs William Egan & Sons, silversmiths, Cork, Ireland in February 1912. It is 24 inches in height. A detachable lid was lost in 1973 and never replaced. Old Celtic tracing designs are engraved around the edges of the trophy. The handles have open-mouthed creatures, probably fish. The cup was mounted on a mahogany plinth to which plaques with the names of the winning teams were attached.]]
The cup is named after Dr. Edwin Fitzgibbon, a Capuchin friar and, from 1911 to 1936, who was Professor of Philosophy at University College Cork. In 1912 Dr. Fitzgibbon donated most of his annual salary to purchase the trophy. The cup was made at William Egan and Sons' silversmiths, Cork, and bears a large inscription on its front: The Fitzgibbon Cup, Donated by The Rev Fr Edwin O.S.F.C. Feb. 1912. It was a 24-inch-tall, large silver trophy, with a round base and a stem that narrowed and then expanded again in support of a wide spherical body, with Old Celtic tracing designs featuring around the edges. It had a circular, open head, on which was placed a detachable lid. The lid was lost on the night of the 1973 tournament final at Galway and has never been replaced.

The competition was played on a round-robin basis until 1949, when a straight knockout format was adopted. For the first 30 years, the cup was dominated by UCC and UCD, with UCG winning occasionally. Queen's University Belfast first took part in 1946, and won their only title in 1953. Each of the NUI Colleges had the cup withheld from them once: In 1933 UCC was awarded custody of the cup, but was not declared the formal winner, following a successful objection to three players on the UCD winning team; in 1940 the Cup was not awarded to any team, after UCC, which had won both its games, was deemed to have an irregular team; and in 1954 the cup was withheld from UCG and the tournament declared null and void after an investigation into the legality of the Galway team and violent scenes at the tournament.

The popularity of the championship grew, and, in the 60s and 70s three more colleges entered: Trinity College Dublin, UU Coleraine and NUI Maynooth. The eight-in-a-row sequence of victories recorded by UCC from 1981 to 1988 was the greatest in the history of the competition. In the late 1980s, all teams in Division One of the Higher Education League were admitted. In 1989 NIHE Limerick (now University of Limerick) became the first non-university Fitzgibbon Cup champions. Since 2001/02 Institutes of Technology have become top guns in the tournament. Waterford IT won the title four times and Limerick IT, the Cup twice in six years (2002/03 through 2007/08). In the remaining six years Cork IT, Limerick IT and Waterford IT have each been losing finalists twice. UCC are the leaders in the roll of honour with 38 titles, the last in 2013.

The first local derby final took place between Limerick Institute of Technology and the University of Limerick at the Gaelic Grounds, Limerick in March 2005; the same institutions met again in the final at Waterford in March 2011. The final in 2012 was a Cork local derby between Cork IT and UCC. The first Fitzgibbon final between Institutes of Technology, also a Munster derby match, took place in 2008 between Waterford IT and Limerick IT.

The Fitzgibbon Cup final was played in Limerick in 2014/15, hosted by Limerick Institute of Technology. The final, which brought together the University of Limerick and the 2014 champions Waterford Institute of Technology ended in a 3-13 to 0-21 draw at the Gaelic Grounds. In the replay at Páirc Úi Rinn in Cork, the University of Limerick emerged victorious, winning the Fitzgibbon Cup for the 5th time which UL last won in 2011.

Fitzgibbon Shield [Plate] winners
The Fitzgibbon Shield [Plate] competition was introduced in 1976/77 for the teams beaten in the quarter-finals of the Fitzgibbon Cup. As a consequence of the Sigerson Cup shenanigans in February 1990, the 1990/91 Fitzgibbon Cup format was changed to a two-day event to cool the social side of this hurling festival. Thus, the Fitzgibbon Shield matches in 1991/92 and 1992/93 were contested between the losing semi-finalists.
