Toshi Yano is an American rock musician, playing bass and keyboard. He was a founding member of the Washington, D.C., hardcore band Battery, the New York hardcore band Violent Bullshit, and of Kapow!, a Brooklyn-based band. Yano also worked as a recording and mixing engineer.

Yano was a touring member of The Fiery Furnaces from 2003 to 2005, playing bass and keyboards on world tours with the band. During that period, Yano was also a temporary bass player for Franz Ferdinand.

Kapow! was an eight-piece band, fronted by Yano, which included Tris McCall on keyboards, and  The Negatones frontmen Jay and Justin Braun. In 2005, the New York Times wrote that Kapow! was "old-fashioned, but frequently irresistible", featuring the "vocal harmonies and garage-rock riffs" characteristic of late-1960s pop music. They released a three-song demo recording which included "In Regards to the Children," "Girl," and "Make You Mine." Kapow! remained active into 2008.
