The Isis Highway is a state highway in southern Queensland, Australia. The highway is relatively short, and runs for  in a north-east / south-west direction between Bundaberg North and the Burnett Highway at Ban Ban Springs. The Isis Highway links the sugar producing Bundaberg and Fraser Coast regions with the cattle farming districts of the North Burnett.

The highway takes its name from the Isis River, which flows between Childers and Burrum Heads. The highway also passes through a significant amount of the former Isis Shire local government area, of which Childers was the administrative centre.

The Isis Highway is signed as State Route 3 between Bundaberg and Childers, and State Route 52 between Childers and Ban Ban Springs. The section between Bundaberg and Childers is a state-controlled regional road (number 19A) while that between Childers and Ban Ban Springs is a state-controlled strategic road (numbers 19B and 19C)
