Playing career
As a youth player she began a bench-clearing brawl in a game in which she was the only female playing.  Resor played her high school hockey at Noble & Greenough Prep School in Massachusetts where she was coached by her uncle, Tom Resor.

Helen Resor was selected to play for Team USA in the 2006 Olympics. Resor was the first Bulldog to achieve that status, and when she won a bronze medal she became the first Yale hockey player of either gender to earn a medal since five Bulldog men won silver with Team USA in 1932.
