People and culture

Due to its location on the shores of the East China Sea, use of plenty of fresh seafood is characteristic for Yuhuanese cuisine. A local variety of pomelo is widely grown, known as buntan in min and wendan in wu dialect.

The county has an especially divisive contrast between the local elite and migrants from other regions of China. Most physical labourers and low-wage jobs are held by migrants while most local businesses are controlled in the hands of natives of the county.

The county is very diverse linguistically. The majority speak a form of the Taizhou dialect (a form of Wu), while the villages of Chenyu and Kanmen are home to a Minnan-speaking population, whose ancestors migrated to this region from Fujian in the late 1800s. Wenzhounese is also spoken in the region. The three languages are noticeably different and are not mutually intelligible amongst each other or with Mandarin, the official language of China. It is not unusual for a local to speak more than one local dialect and passable Mandarin.
