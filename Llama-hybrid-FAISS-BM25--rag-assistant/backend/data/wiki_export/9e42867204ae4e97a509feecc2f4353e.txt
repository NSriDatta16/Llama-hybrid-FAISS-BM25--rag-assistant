Notes
1 This track was labelled as " Up Baby" on the CD cover, although both the lyrics and the French version, titled "Ouvres-toi bébé", indicate that the intended meaning was "open". It is not known if this was a spelling error on the cover art or an intentional use of artistic license, but both "" and "Open" have been cited as the song's title by different reference works. The band's own website, however, uses the "" spelling, as does the 2003 greatest hits compilation Hit & Run, lending credence to the idea that it was intentional.
