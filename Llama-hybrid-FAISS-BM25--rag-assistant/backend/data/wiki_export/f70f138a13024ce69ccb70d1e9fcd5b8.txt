Bangladesh Football Federation (, Bānglādesh fūṭbôl fēḍārēshôn) is the governing body that administers the sport of association football in Bangladesh. It is in charge of running the country's men's and women's national teams, as well as the Bangladesh Premier League and various other competitions and tournaments. The BFF was one of founding members of the South Asian Football Federation. It is based at BFF Bhaban, in the Motijheel Thana of the country's capital, Dhaka.

History
The Bangladesh Football Federation was founded on 15 July 1972 by Md. Yousuf Ali, the country's former Minister for Education, Culture and Sport; the general secretary under Ali was Abul Hashem of Wari Club.

It became affiliated with the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) in 1973, and FIFA in 1976. It is also a founding member of South Asian Football Federation. Bangladesh has been elected to be part of the AFC Executive Committee for two four-year terms: in 1982–1986 and 1998–2002. Hafizuddin Ahmed was elected vice-president of the AFC for the term from 1990 to 1994.

After Bangladesh gained independence in the early 1970s, the BFF assumed responsibility for the Dhaka League, which had begun in 1948. The league resumed for the 1973 season, but has since been superseded by the Bangladesh Premier League (founded in 2007 as the B.League) and the Bangladesh Championship League (in 2012), and now exists only as a regional league at the third tier of the nation's football league pyramid.

In 1980, the Federation started the Federation Cup, which grew to be the country's top national cup competition.

In 2009, it launched the Super Cup tournament, which ran in 2009, 2011 and 2013. In 2013, the prize money for winning the competition was Tk10 million. In the inaugural competition, Mohammedan SC beat arch-rivals Abahani Limited Dhaka.
