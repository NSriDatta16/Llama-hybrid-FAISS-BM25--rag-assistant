Anglican services were held quarterly in the St Lawrence Courthouse (now the St Lawrence Police Station) until the opening of the meatworks in 1893 attracted sufficient residents to establish a church.

The foundation block for Christ Church Anglican was laid on Saturday 21 May 1898 by Thomas Byrnes, the new Queensland Premier (and Queensland's first Roman Catholic Premier).
