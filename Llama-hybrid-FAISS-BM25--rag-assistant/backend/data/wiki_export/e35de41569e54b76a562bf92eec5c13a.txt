The letter  can be used to transcribe  of Persian Gulf: Gulf Arabic and Iraqi Arabic, where they have that sound natively. In these countries and the rest of Arabic-speaking geographic regions, the combination of  () is more likely used to transliterate the  sound which is often realized as two consonants (+) elsewhere; this letter combination is used for loanwords and foreign names, including those of Spanish origin in Moroccan Arabic.
