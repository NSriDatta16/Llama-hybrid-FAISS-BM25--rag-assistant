Football

Association

In the early 20th Century Leeds was known as a rugby town. The first football team to bear the name of the city were called Leeds City F.C. However, this team was disqualified from the league for financial breaches. In 1919  Leeds United F.C. were formed. Unlike many northern cities such as Manchester and Sheffield, Leeds has just one football league team, being the city with the largest population to have just one team in the top four divisions of English football (the Premier League and the three leagues comprising The Football League).

Leeds United played the 2007–08 season in Football League One, the third level of the English league system; this was the first time since the club's election to The Football League in 1920 that they have played outside the top two divisions. They were relegated from the second-level Football League Championship as a direct result of a 10-point deduction for going into administration. They entered the Championship in 2004, when a financial crisis and loss of key players cost them their Premiership status and almost put them out of business. They were promoted back to the Premier League in 2020 following a sixteen-year absence, after winning the Championship the previous season. Leeds United's greatest successes came under the leadership of manager Don Revie in the late 1960s, and 1970s, when they were league champions twice as well as winning the League Cup, FA Cup and European Fairs Cup. They also won the league title in 1992, when Howard Wilkinson was manager, the team's last major top flight trophy. There is also an affiliated Ladies team Leeds United L.F.C. whose closest chance at silverware was in the 2006 FA Women's Cup, losing to Arsenal L.F.C.

A year later Leeds won the Rugby League Challenge Cup, defeating London Broncos at Wembley in the last final held at Wembley stadium before its re-building. After several years without a trophy the appointment of Tony Smith of coach saw Leeds top the league at the end of the season and went on to be crowned Super League champions on 16 October 2004 after defeating arch rivals Bradford Bulls 16–8 at Old Trafford. In 2005 the Rhinos reached the final of both the Challenge Cup and the Super League but lost both games to Hull F.C. and Bradford Bulls respectively.  Leeds now hold the 2007 crown after thrashing former champions St Helens 33–6 in the Grand Final.  This was Coach Tony Smith's final game before leaving to be G.B coach and this win makes it two grand final trophies in four years. They won the next two super league grand finals, topping the regular season league table in the latter, setting a record for the most consecutive grand final wins. They also won the crown in 2011, coming from 5th place after the regular season rounds. The team reached the challenge cup final for the first time at the redeveloped Wembley Stadium in 2010, and then again in 2011, losing out 6–30 to the Warrington Wolves and then 18–28 to Wigan Warriors.
