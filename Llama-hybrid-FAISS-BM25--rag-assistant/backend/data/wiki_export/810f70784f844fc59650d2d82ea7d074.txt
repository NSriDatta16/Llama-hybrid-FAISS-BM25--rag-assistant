Guatemalan Democratic Vanguard () was a left-wing group in Guatemala. The VDG was founded on 28 September 1947 by a faction of the Revolutionary Action Party (PAR). The leader of the VDG was Jos√© Manuel Fortuny. The group had Marxist inspiration, and operated a semi-clandestine fashion. It supported urban and rural labour movements.

In 1949, the VDG broke with the PAR and constituted the Communist Party of Guatemala (PCG).
