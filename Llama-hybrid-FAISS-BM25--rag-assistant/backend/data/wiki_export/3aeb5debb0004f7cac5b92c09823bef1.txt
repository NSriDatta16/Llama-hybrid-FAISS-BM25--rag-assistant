Four on the Floor is an album by American hardcore punk band Dag Nasty, released in 1992 through Epitaph Records. Four on the Floor was a one-shot reunion record recorded while the band members were on vacation in Los Angeles in the summer of 1991. Guitar tracks are credited to "Dale Nixon," not Brian Baker; Baker could not use his real name because he was at the time under contract with the blues/metal band Junkyard.

Critical reception
The Washington Post called it a "first-rate" album, writing that the "sound is as punchy and the lyrics as smart as ever; muscular yet melodic, such songs as 'Still Waiting' and 'S.F.S.' manage to be both urgent and infectious."
