Henry Clarence Baldridge (November 24, 1868 â€“ June 8, 1947) was an American politician. A Republican, he was the 14th governor of Idaho, serving from 1927 until 1931.

Biography
Born in Carlock, Illinois, Baldridge was educated in public schools. He attended Illinois Wesleyan University and then taught school. He married Cora A. McCreighton on February 1, 1893. They had a son, M. Claire Baldridge, and a daughter, L. Gail Baldridge.

Baldridge relocated from Illinois to Southwestern Idaho in 1904 and settled in Parma, working in the mercantile trade. Later he dealt in implements and hardware and was president of the local bank.
