Simon Oates (6 January 1932 â€“ 20 May 2009) was an English actor best known for his roles on television.

Born in Canning Town, east London and moving to Finchley in his teens, Oates trained as a heating engineer for his father's firm before becoming an actor. He was in the Intelligence Corps during his Army National Service. Working in theatrical rep during the 1950s he was leading man at York Theatre Royal for some years before being cast as Dr. John Ridge in the science fiction television series Doomwatch. (Co-stars included John Paul as Dr. Spencer Quist and Robert Powell as Toby Wren). He appeared regularly as Anthony Kelly in the 1960s espionage series The Mask of Janus and its spin-off series The Spies.
