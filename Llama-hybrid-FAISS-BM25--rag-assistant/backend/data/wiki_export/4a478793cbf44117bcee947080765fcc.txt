Winchcombe railway station is a heritage railway station which serves the town of Winchcombe in Gloucestershire, England. The stations itself is actually located in the nearby village of Greet. It is located on the Honeybourne Line which linked Cheltenham and  and which was opened by the Great Western Railway in 1906. The station closed to passengers in 1960, although the line itself remained open for freight and diversionary use until 1976, when a freight train derailed near Winchcombe and damaged the track.

By the late 1970s, the line had been dismantled. The stretch between  and , including Winchcombe, has since been reconstructed and reopened by the heritage Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway. A new station has been erected in Greet, Winchcombe, on the site of the original building, the building being the former station at . Nearby is the  Greet Tunnel, the second longest on any preserved line in Britain.

History 
On 9 July 1859, the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway opened a line from  to . The OW&W became the West Midland Railway in 1860 and was acquired by Great Western Railway in 1883 with a view to combining it with the Birmingham to Stratford Line to create a high-speed route from the Midlands to the South West. The GWR obtained authorisation in 1899 for the construction of a double-track line between Honeybourne and Cheltenham and this was completed in stages by 1908.

Winchcombe was opened on 1 February 1905. It is situated close to the small village of Greet but  to the north of Winchcombe. Two  facing platforms were provided; the original station building built of red brick on a plinth of blue brick was situated on the Down platform. A verandah canopy, similar to that at , extended from the front of the building to a covered footbridge linking the two platforms. On the Up platform was a passenger waiting shelter and gentlemen's lavatory. The goods yard lay on the south-eastern side of the station and comprised cattle pens, a goods shed, weighbridge  and 6-ton crane. A brick-built 31-lever signal box controlled access to the yard, while a 50-wagon Up refuge siding led to the rear of the Up platform. As with , the station was lit by acetylene lamps with the gas hut situated behind the weighhouse.

From February 1905 to June 1906, Winchcombe was the southern terminus of the line and buses to Cheltenham were provided pending the extension south. From June 1906, eight local services each way ran between Honeybourne and . The completion of the North Warwickshire Line in July 1908 saw the first through services from  to .  By 1938, nine Down and ten Up services ran daily, with three on Sundays. Traffic receipts for 1913 showed that 21,824 passengers had been carried, representing £1,436 in fares collected (equivalent to £ in ), whilst 11,828 tons of goods traffic had been handled (mainly coal/coke and livestock), giving a total income of £5,837 (equivalent to £ in ). By 1933, both of these figures had fallen: receipts to £4,436 (equivalent to £ in ) and goods tonnage to 8,320. The Second World War however saw tonnage peak at 17,045, with the bulk of it consisting in agricultural machinery, fertilisers and foodstuffs.

Winchcombe closed to passenger traffic on 7 March 1960, the distance between the town and its station contributing to its demise. The goods yard remained open for a further four years until 2 November 1964. By March 1965, the station site had been levelled, leaving only the weighhouse, goods shed and residential accommodation. The signal box remained in operation until 24 February 1965, shortly after which it was demolished. The line remained open to goods and diversionary traffic until 25 August 1976 when the 06.35 Toton to  derailed at a point east of the bridge carrying the B4632 road linking Winchcombe and Toddington over the line. The incident prompted British Rail to announce the line's closure.
