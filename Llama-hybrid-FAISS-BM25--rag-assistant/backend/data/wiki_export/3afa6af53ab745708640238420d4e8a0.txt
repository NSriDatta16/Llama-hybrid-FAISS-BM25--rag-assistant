Barry Manilow is a studio album released by singer and songwriter Barry Manilow in 1989. It was Manilow's thirteenth studio album overall and second studio album on his second tenure with Arista Records. The album represented a hint of future album releases in that many of the songs were not written/co-written by Manilow, which until that point had been rare for him. After the release of this album, Manilow embarked on introducing contemporary audiences to pop music of the 1930s through the late 1940s.

The singles from this album were: "Keep Each Other Warm", "The One That Got Away", "Please Don't Be Scared" and "When the Good Times Come Again", which hit #12 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart in June 2020 in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. No singles from the album reached the Billboard Hot 100, but "Keep Each Other Warm" and "The One That Got Away" made the AC chart at #7 and #25 respectively in 1989.
