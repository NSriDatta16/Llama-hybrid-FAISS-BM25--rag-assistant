The Kitchener-Waterloo Siskins are a junior ice hockey team based in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.  They play in the Mid-Western division of the Greater Ontario Junior Hockey League.

History

Founded in 1934, the Siskins are one of the longest running Junior teams in hockey history. The team took a short hiatus in World War II. In the 1950s, the team was a part of what was then known as the "Big 10", and in 1956 was allocated in the Central "B". As part of the 1971 geographic realignment, the Siskins moved to the Western Junior B league. In 1973, the Siskins joined the Southwestern "B", which became the Waterloo-Wellington "B" in 1974, and the Midwestern "B" in 1977. The Siskins have always been a competitive team, and together with the Stratford Cullitons dominated the league for much of its first 20 years. The Siskins still operate in the Midwestern "B" to this day.

Since 1977, the Siskins have won 8 league championships and 6 Sutherland Cups as Ontario Hockey Association Junior "B" Champions. They have only had four losing records and have been regular season champions 4 times. Prior to 1977, the Siskins had won 6 Sutherland Cups for a total of 12, a record.

In 2019, the Siskins faced off against the London Nationals for the Sutherland Cup. The Siskins would go on to beat the London Nationals in game seven on an overtime goal scored by Alec Tiley giving the Siskins their 12th Sutherland Cup in team history. It was the first time in 25 years that the team had become Sutherland Cup Champions.

In 2020 after the Departure of the Kitchener Dutchmen from the area, the team changed its name to the KW Siskins.
