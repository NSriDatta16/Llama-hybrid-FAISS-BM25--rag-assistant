Places of interest
As a seaside village, Fountainstown's Blue Flag beach overlooks Ringabella creek to the south.

Close to the village centre is Fountainstown House, a stately home which was originally built by the Roche family - a Norman family may have acquired lands at Fountainstown in the 15th or 16th century.

Fountainstown's pitch and putt club is sometimes considered to be the home of the sport's first course, and described by the European Pitch and Putt Association as the origin point of "modern day organised competitive Pitch and Putt".

The coast road between Fountainstown and nearby Myrtleville is used as a walk or promenade.
