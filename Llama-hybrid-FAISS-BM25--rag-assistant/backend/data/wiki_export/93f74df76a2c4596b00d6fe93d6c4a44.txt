Axis of Advance was a Canadian death metal band from Edmonton, active from 1998 to 2008. Their music was described as "freaked-out, hyper and evil metal...not for the weak and not really for most rational human beings, but it will sound great to those looking for a slice of evil black metal the way it should be done."

History
The band began as Sacramentary Abolishment, which was formed in 1993 by guitarist/vocalist Wör (Jason McLeod), bassist/vocalist Vermina, aka Verminaard (Chris Ross) and drummer Paulus Kressman, who came up with the name. In 1997, Kressman left the band to start the solo project Rites of Thy Degringolade. Wör and Vermin recruited drummer James Read and re-named the band Axis of Advance.

On Halloween 1997, Sacramentary Abolishment launched their album The Distracting Stone at Area 51 in Edmonton. Vermin brought a pig’s head onto the stage, ripped into it with a battleaxe, then pitched it into the crowd.

In a 1998 interview with Russian Metal, Vermin revealed that the name Sacramentary Abolishment stood for the abolishment of all religious sacrament, and that he believed that "Black metal is strictly a white man’s realm." In 1999, the trio was banned from performing at a planned show in Edmonton for alleged Nazi leanings and symbolism. In 2002, prior to the released of the band's album The List, they issued a press release denying affiliation with the white supremacist movement.

The band toured Europe in 2004, then traveled to Malmö Sweden, where they recorded their album Obey at Berno Studio.

Axis of Advance dissolved in 2008.

Verminaard plays session guitars in Read's main band Revenge and was involved in Weapon for a short period of time.  Vermin and J. Read both play in Blood Revolt along with Primordial's A.A. Nemtheanga.
