"Shackles (Praise You)" is the debut single by American gospel singer-songwriter duo Mary Mary, released on February 29, 2000, in the United States. It is considered the group's signature song. Stan North of GospelFlava.com deemed it one of the pioneer songs of urban gospel music. The song was originally released as a promotional single for their debut album, Thankful, in 1999. They both feature the same track listing but different album covers, the second using a picture of the duo.

"Shackles" became a top-10 hit in several countries around the world, including Australia, Denmark, Iceland, New Zealand, Norway and the United Kingdom, and it charted well in other major music markets. Mary Mary later shot a music video for the song. A sample of this song was featured on Stormzy's song titled "Rainfall", which was a part of his 2019 album Heavy Is the Head.

Critical reception
Like many contemporary gospel songs, "Shackles" was not without its criticism; many cited the song as being too modern and not staying true to its gospel roots. Mary Mary responded by saying, "It's definitely contemporary. It's music that everybody in any style of music can relate to. It's universal, but the lyrics are undeniably Gospel."

Commercial performance
"Shackles (Praise You)" became a top-40 hit in the United States, peaking at number 28 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song was also a worldwide hit, reaching number five in the United Kingdom and number 17 in Ireland. Across mainland Europe, the song was a top-10 hit Belgium, the Netherlands, and Norway. It also charted strongly in France, Poland, Sweden, and Switzerland, peaking within the top 20. In Australia, the song reached number two in September 2000 and was the highest-selling song of the year that did not reach the number-one spot, coming in at number 10 on Australia's year-end chart for 2000.
