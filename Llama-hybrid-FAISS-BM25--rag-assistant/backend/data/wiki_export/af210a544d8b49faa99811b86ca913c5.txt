Bonnefontaine () is a commune in the Jura department in Bourgogne-Franche-Comté in eastern France.

Geography
Bonnefontaine is located in the core of the first plateau of the Jura on the edge of the Côte de l'Heute to 580 meters of altitude. In addition to its centre, the village includes a hamlet : Le Patouillet. The local agriculture is traditionally dairy breeding used for the manufacture of a regional cheese, the Comté.

History
Until 1897, the name of the village was "Les Faisses" (similar to fesses : buttocks, in French).  On that date, this name, considered as defamatory was replaced by Bonnefontaine, in reference to the three stone fountains of the village.
