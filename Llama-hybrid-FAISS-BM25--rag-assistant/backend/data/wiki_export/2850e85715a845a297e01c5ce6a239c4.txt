Barclay College is a private Quaker college in Haviland, Kansas. It is known for ministry degrees but offers degrees in other professional fields. Since the fall of 2007, the college has offered full-tuition scholarships to students who enroll full-time and pay to live in the residence halls.

History
In 1917, evangelist and teacher Scott T. Clark founded the Kansas Central Bible Training School on the site of Haviland Friends Academy, a Quaker high school in Haviland, Kansas. A two-year junior college course was added in 1925, and the name was changed in 1930 to Friends Bible College to more fully reflect the growing mission of the institution.

By 1968, the school's vision put an emphasis on the four-year institution, leading to closure of the high school program and an effort to secure necessary faculty and facilities. This effort received general recognition in 1975 with the granting of full accreditation by the Association for Biblical Higher Education. Barclay College adopted its current name in 1990 to honor the first Quaker theologian, Robert Barclay.
