History
Kresttsy (Krestetsky Pogost) was first mentioned in 1393. At the time, it was a part of Derevskaya Pyatina of the Novgorod Republic. In the end of the 15th century, together with Novgorod, it became a part of the Grand Duchy of Moscow. In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, the area was included into Ingermanland Governorate (known since 1710 as Saint Petersburg Governorate). In 1727, separate Novgorod Governorate was split off. In the 18th century, Kresttsy was an important trading settlement, which lied on the road connecting Moscow and Saint Petersburg. In particular, it operated a yam station which also served as a postal service station. In 1776, it was chartered and became the administrative center of Krestetsky Uyezd of Novgorod Viceroyalty. In 1796, the viceroyalty was transformed into Novgorod Governorate. Between 1796 and 1802 the uyezd was abolished, and it was re-established in 1802.

In 1851 the Saint Petersburg–Moscow railway was opened, which bypassed Kresttsy. This undermined the importance of the area, which became a backwater. In 1922, Krestetsky Uyezd was abolished, and in 1926, Kresttsy lost the town status and became a selo.

On August 1, 1927, the uyezds were abolished, and Krestetsky District was established, with the center in Kresttsy. Novgorod Governorate was abolished as well, and the district belonged to Novgorod Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. On July 23, 1930 the okrugs were abolished, and the districts became directly subordinate to the oblast. On November 9, 1938 Kresttsy was granted an urban-type settlement status. On July 5, 1944, Krestetsky District was transferred to newly established Novgorod Oblast and remained there ever since. Kresttsy was not occupied during the Second World War, though it was located close to the front line.
