Blurb is an American self-publishing platform that allows users to create, self-publish, promote, share, and sell their own print and ebooks. It also offers software for laying out books.

History
The company was founded in 2005 by Eileen Gittins and funded by Canaan Partners and Anthem Venture Partners. Blurb's headquarters are in San Francisco, California. Since its inception, Blurb has delivered more than 14 million books.

Time magazine named Blurb one of 2006's "50 Coolest Web Sites".

The company generates nearly $100 million in revenues per year.

Blurb announced a partnership with Amazon in April 2014. The deal allows Blurb-designed books to be sold and distributed on the Amazon platform. The partnership enables self publishing on the platform with a 15% cut on Blurb books. Amazon agreed to the fee to access Blurb's authors.

In May 2014 Blurb acquired MagCloud, a self-publishing platform for magazines, under a licensing agreement from HP. In the deal, Blurb has taken over the company's technology and operations. Blurb was acquired by their print fulfillment partner Reischling Press, Inc. (RPI) for an undisclosed amount in August 2020.

Blurb's book-making tools include BookWright (a downloadable tool), BookSmart), Blurb's PDF Uploader, the Blurb iOS app, and Blurb's plug-in for Adobe InDesign which allows book makers to design and upload their book's PDF files from within InDesign itself. Adobe's Lightroom Classic has a built-in Book module that Lightroom users can use to create and upload their books directly to Blurb for printing or for creation in ebook form.

Blurb authors can promote and share their books (including ebooks) using Blurb's free on-line marketing tools. They can also set their price and sell their books and ebooks in Blurb's online bookstore. The platform's print-on-demand technology enables authors to print just as many books are ordered. In addition, it offers seven book sizes, hardcover and softcover options, and a range of papers and end sheets. Blurb e-books are fixed format, enabling them to retain the same image and text placement when viewed on the Apple iPad as in the printed book version.
