Kriechenwil is a municipality in the Bern-Mittelland administrative district in the canton of Bern in Switzerland.

History
Kriechenwil is first mentioned in 1353 as Digki. Until 1959 the official name was Dicki.

Prehistoric traces of settlements in the area include a neolithic spearhead, a Hallstatt grave mound, an early medieval bridle and saddle and a cache of unknown coins. The land that is now the modern municipality was part of the medieval Herrschaft of Laupen. In 1324, the entire Herrschaft was acquired by Bern. The village may have existed before it became Bernese territory, but there are no records before 1353. A bridge was built over the Sarine river around 1400 as part of a medieval trade road to Bern.

The village was part of the parish of Neuenegg until the Protestant Reformation in 1528. After adopting the new faith, it became part of the parish of Laupen.

Today the municipality has its own primary school, while students travel to Laupen for secondary education. About two-thirds of the working population commutes to jobs in nearby towns.
