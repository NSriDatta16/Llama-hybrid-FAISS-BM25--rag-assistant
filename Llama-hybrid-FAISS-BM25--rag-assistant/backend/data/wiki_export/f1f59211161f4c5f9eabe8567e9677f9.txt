Rookie of the Year 

Mike Stefanik, driving in the series full-time in the #66 Phelon Motorsports car after having won the series championship in both the Busch North Series and the Featherlite Modified Series in the previous two seasons, managed to get nine top-tens en route to winning Rookie of the Year honors. Runner-up Scott Hansen had three top-tens in a Ken Schrader-owned truck, while David Starr drove 24 races for various owners. Marty Houston, Phil Bonifield, Ryan McGlynn, and former ARCA champion Tim Steele ran limited schedules during the season. Nipper Alsup, Ernie Cope, Mike Clark, and Randy Nelson all failed to meet the minimum requirements to contend for the top Rookie honors.
