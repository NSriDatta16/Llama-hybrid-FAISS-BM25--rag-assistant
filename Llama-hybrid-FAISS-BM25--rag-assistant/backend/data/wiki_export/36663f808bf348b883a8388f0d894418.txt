History
Author Kate Douglas Wiggin's bestselling children's novel Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm was first published in 1903. A sequel, New Chronicles of Rebecca, was published in 1907. In the summer of that year, Wiggin was approached by fellow author Charlotte Thompson about adapting the Rebecca stories for the stage. Wiggin was skeptical about the suggestion, but Thompson had previous experiencing adapting novels into plays, so Wiggin agreed to collaborate with her. The resulting adaptation used material from both novels. In the spring of 1908, they submitted the script to the production team of Marc Klaw and A. L. Erlanger, who accepted it and began work on the production that debuted in November 1909.

The first production of the play appeared at the Court Square Theatre in Springfield, Massachusetts, where it debuted on November 15, 1909. After it toured in New England during the 1909–10 season, Klaw and Erlanger took the pay to the Republic Theatre on Broadway for the 1910–11 season. It opened there on October 3, 1910, and continued for 216 performances. The production closed on April 8, 1911.
