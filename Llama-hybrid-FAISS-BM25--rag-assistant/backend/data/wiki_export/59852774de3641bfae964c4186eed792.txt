The Swedish Food Workers' Union (, Livs) is a trade union representing workers in the food and drink industries in Sweden.

The union was founded on 1 January 1922, when the Swedish Bakery and Confectionery Workers' Union merged with the Swedish Butchers' Union.  Like both its predecessors, it affiliated to the Swedish Trade Union Confederation.  On foundation, it had 9,372 members and by 1959 had grown to 38,053.  The Swedish Tobacco Industry Workers' Union joined in 1964, followed by the Swedish Brewery Industry Workers' Union in 1965, and the dairy workers' section of the Swedish Commercial Employees' Union in 1968.  Its all-time peak membership was 53,131 in 1985, but this dropped to 22,877 by 2019.

The Union launched a campaign called "Scandal" in December 2013 to highlight working conditions at Scan, Sweden's largest meat company. The campaign was successful and the Union signed an agreement with Scan.
