Name 

Prior to the Balkan Wars, the settlement was known as Globoderica ().

Following the conflict, the settlement was incorporated into Serbia and renamed Obilić as part of the Serbianisation efforts of the early twentieth century when inhabited places within Kosovo were named after heroes from Serbian epic poetry. The placename Obilić refers to the Serbian national hero Miloš Obilić who killed the Ottoman Sultan Murad I at the Battle of Kosovo (1389).

In Albanian, the town is known as Obiliq (a transliteration of the Serbian name), while an alternative name (used by Albanians ) was coined by the Albanological Institute, Kastriot, after Albanian national hero George Kastrioti Skanderbeg (1405–1468).
