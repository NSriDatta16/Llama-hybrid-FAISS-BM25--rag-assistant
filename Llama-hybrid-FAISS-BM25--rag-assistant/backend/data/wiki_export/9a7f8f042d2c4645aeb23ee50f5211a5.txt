Vive La Différence! is the third album by Swedish indie pop band Eggstone, released in Sweden and Japan in January 1997. It was the first and only full-length release by the band on their own record label Vibrafon. The album was preceded by the single "Never Been a Better Day", as well as the sheet music for the entire album, in December 1996.

Vive La Différence!, along with the two previous Eggstone albums, Eggstone in San Diego and Somersault, were re-issued on vinyl in 1997 by Vibrafon Records.
