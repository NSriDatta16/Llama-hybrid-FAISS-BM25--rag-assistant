Penny Dale (born 1954 in London) is an English illustrator and writer of children's books.

Background 
Dale studied Fine Arts and graduated from Exeter College of Art and Design. She moved to South East Wales in 1982, and currently resides in Caerleon, a village in Newport. Dale is married and has one daughter.

Career 
Her picture books as author-illustrator include Ten in the Bed, which won the Oppenheim Toy Portfolio Award in 2002, Wake Up Mr. B! which was commended for the Kate Greenaway Medal, and more recently her Dinosaur series with Nosy Crow.

She has also illustrated books by other writers, including Anne Fine and Martin Waddell. 

Dale's illustrations for Rosie's Babies, a picture book written by Waddell which aims to introduce children to the idea of a new sibling, were shortlisted for the Kate Greenaway Medal in 1990.

In 2003 Dale illustrated Anne Fine's Jamie and Angus, a book of short stories for young readers rooted in the domestic concerns of one child. The book won the Boston Globe–Horn Book Awards.

Ten in the Bed is Dale's best-known book. According to her publisher, as of 2013 the book had sold "nearly two million copies". It led to two sequels, Ten Out of Bed and Ten Play Hide and Seek.
 
In 2018 Ten in the Bed became the first CBeebies bedtime story to be signed in Makaton. It was performed by Rob Delaney and aired on the BBC channel in November.
