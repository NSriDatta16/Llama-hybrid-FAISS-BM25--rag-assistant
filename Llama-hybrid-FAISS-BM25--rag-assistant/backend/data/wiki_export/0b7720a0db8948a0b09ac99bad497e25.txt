Professional career
In his Double-A campaign in 2005, he hit 20 home runs with 35 stolen bases. He made his major league debut on September 5, 2005, with the Giants. Ortmeier started off  with the Triple-A Fresno Grizzlies. He was called up briefly to the Giants and then returned to Triple-A. He struggled with a knee and a wrist injury, he finished the year with the Double-A Connecticut Defenders.

Ortmeier had knee surgery prior to the  season, but was fully recovered by spring training. He was assigned to the Grizzlies for the start of the 2007 season, but was called up to the Giants twice. Ortmeier switched from playing outfield to first base due to the Giants' glut of outfielders. On September 7, he hit a walk-off home run to beat the Los Angeles Dodgers at AT&T Park.

Ortmeier competed for the starting first base job in  spring training, but lost the competition to Rich Aurilia. At the request of the team, Ortmeier gave up switch hitting in favor of batting exclusively from the right side. In 2007, he batted .240 at the Triple-A level as a left-handed hitter. On April 9, 2008, Ortmeier batted as a right-handed hitter against a right-handed pitcher for the first time since  and hit a game winning RBI double against Heath Bell. In August 2008, he went back to switch-hitting.

On January 14, , he signed a minor league contract with the Colorado Rockies. In November 2009, Ortmeier was granted free agency.
