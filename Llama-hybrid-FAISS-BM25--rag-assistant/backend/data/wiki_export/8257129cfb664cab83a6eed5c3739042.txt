Colin Campbell Ferrie (May 1, 1808 â€“ November 9, 1856) was a Canadian merchant, banker, and politician.

Born in Glasgow, the son of Adam Ferrie and Rachel Campbell, he came to Montreal from Scotland in 1824 to work in his father's new wholesale and forwarding company. By 1829, Colin, his brother Adam and his father had joined forces to supply and run a store in Hamilton, Upper Canada, under the name of Colin Ferrie and Company.  He married Catherine Beasley in 1836, and they had two sons.

From 1829 to 1833, additional stores were opened in places such as Brantford, Preston, Nelson, Dundas, and Waterloo. A founder of the Gore Bank, Ferrie was its second president from 1839 until his death in 1856. He was the first mayor of Hamilton and served in 1847. Ferrie also represented Hamilton in the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada from 1836 to 1841.

He died in Hamilton, Canada West in 1856 and was buried in Hamilton Cemetery.

Hamilton Spectator Article 
The following appeared in the Hamilton Spectator's 170th anniversary special edition. See more from the project .

Hamilton businessman Colin Campbell Ferrie (1808-1856) was appointed Hamilton's first mayor in 1847 and served for one year. Ferrie was also known for his sprawling estate at Queen and York that was called West Lawn. It was built in 1836 and demolished in 1957 by Tuckett Tobacco Co. Ltd. According to an article in The Spectator from Jan. 21, 1947, "The old York street trail was selected by several prominent citizens of Hamilton as the site for their fine new homes. Crowning the height, Dundurn Castle eclipsed them all, but another palatial residence to the east ran a close second. At York and Queen streets was West Lawn, the home of Colin C. Ferrie, Hamilton's first mayor."

Significance 
Ferrie was a major player in local commerce and was a founding member of the Hamilton Board of Trade that was formed in 1845. As mayor, he is remembered for focusing his attention on improving the local economy. He arranged civic financing from the Gore Bank and tried to prepare the city for an anticipated wave of poor and sick Irish immigrants fleeing the Great Famine of Ireland.
