History

Middle Ages 

In the 14th century the region was governed by the powerful Vojinović family.

In 1359, veliki čelnik Dimitrije held the region.

Ottoman period

The rebels were defeated at the field of Gacko. It ultimately failed due to lack of foreign support.

Modern history
Austro-Hungarian authorities took it over in 1878, a decision which was made at the Berlin Congress. In 1908, Austria-Hungary annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina sparking the Bosnian crisis which eventually led to World War I.

After that war, Gacko joined the State of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, going on to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes by the end of 1918. These were the first incarnations of Yugoslavia.

Croatian fascist Ustaše movement committed the Gacko massacre on 4 June 1941. In response, on 6 June 1941 the rebels from Gacko under command of Orthodox priest Radojica Perišić started the uprising against the genocidal Independent State of Croatia known as June 1941 uprising in eastern Herzegovina. The communist historiography intentionally ignored pre-22 June rebels in Eastern Herzegovina and Sanski Most because they occurred in the period of collaboration between communists and fascists, so it would contradict the communist narrative about rebels being led by communists. On the other hand, the first Partisan battalion established in Gacko at the end of 1941 was named "6th June" in honor of the first date of the uprising. In period after the Fall of the Berlin Wall Gacko municipality proclaimed 6 June as their holiday in honor of the beginning of the uprising and held public ceremonies on 6 June named as the Day of Gacko.
