Maula Jatt (), is a 1979 Pakistani Punjabi-language action, musical film directed by Yunus Malik and produced by Sarwar Bhatti. The film is an unofficial sequel to 1975's Wehshi Jatt, starring Sultan Rahi as Maula Jatt and Mustafa Qureshi as his arch-rival Noori Natt.

This film belongs to a genre which represents the rural culture of Punjab. Its success set the trend of action films being popular in Pakistan and cemented Sultan Rahi as Lollywood's main hero. The film was inspired by Ahmed Nadeem Qasmi's short story "Gandasa" which described the culture of Gujranwala's rural areas. It received positive reviews from critics. An unofficial sequel titled Maula Jatt in London, also directed by Malik, was released in 1981.

Plot
The story is set in a village near the town of Mamdal, near Kabirwala. Following the settlement of Maula Jatt's family feud, Maula has renounced violence and is in charge of administering the peace of 25 villages.

A member of the Natt clan, Maakha, chases a girl, who is given protection by Maula's Bhabi Daani. When Maakha refuses to retreat, Maula's friend Moodha beats up Maakha and leaves a scar on his nose. Maula decrees that if Maakha wants to avoid the fate of being killed by his 'Gandasa', he should marry the girl whom he has dishonoured and marry his sister off to her brother. As the girl has no family, so Maula orders Maakha to marry his sister to Moodha. When Makha returns home, his sister Daaro kills him for cowardice. Daaro then goes to kill Maula, but is arrested on the way for Maakha's murder. However she is bailed out by a man who calls her sister, who is actually Maula.

When Noori Natt gets out of jail, he tells the police that he has run out of competition and he wants a worthy opponent. The police direct him to Malik Haaku, whose clan Maula had slaughtered. Haku doesn't tell Noori the name of his old rival and warns him not to get in his way if he ever finds out about him. On returning home, Daaro tells him of Maakha's defeat and Maula's judgement that she should marry Moodha. Noori comes to Maula's village seeking revenge while Maula is away, and breaks Moodha's leg. When Maula returns, he vows to take Noori's leg in return and recovers his Gandasa.

Maula then rides to find Noori and defeats many of Natt's men. Maula and Noori finally face off but police stop them from killing each other. In the meantime, Noori's brother-in-law Akku Qatil kills many of Maula's villagers in revenge. Finally a judge decrees that both Maula and Noori should be sent back to their villages under house arrest. However, soon both Jatt and Natt are provoked and ride against each other, although by the time they reach each other for a fight both have been shot several times by the police guarding them. In the hospital, Daaro realizes Maula had called her sister.

After Maula and Noori pretend to reconcile, the police lift the blockade from both villages. Immediately, Akku goes to attack Maula's village, but is himself killed. Maula sends Akku's body and other wedding gifts to Daaro, telling them the wedding procession is coming now, and Noori swears revenge on Maula's village.

As the groom's procession sets out for Daaro's village, Noori leads many Natt clansmen to attack the procession. Maula defeats all the Natt men, and then also Noori himself. Just as he is about to deliver the final blow, Daaro, comes to the rescue and requests Maula to spare Noori and considering that Maula had called her his sister. Maula agrees but Noori amputates his own leg so Maula's revenge is completed. The film ends with Daaro agreeing to marry Moodha and their rivalry resolved forever. Maula immediately throws away his Gandasa and makes an impassioned plea to the audience to choose seeking justice over revenge.
