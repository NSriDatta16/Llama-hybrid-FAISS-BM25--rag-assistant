Sons of the P is the second album by American rap group Digital Underground, released in 1991. The album contained two hit singles, "No Nose Job" and "Kiss You Back," both of which were written by and featured the lead vocals of Greg Jacobs (a.k.a. Shock G/Humpty Hump). The latter featured multi-layered choruses and background vocals sung by Boni Boyer, who briefly worked with D.U. shortly after her stint with Prince's Sign of the Times/Love Sexy band.

It is sometimes mistakenly reported that "Kiss You Back" was co-written and co-performed by George Clinton,  but his name appropriately appears in the songwriting credits due to a sample of "(Not Just) Knee Deep," by Funkadelic. He did actively participate in the writing and recording of the title track, to which he also contributed vocals, and which marked one of the earliest studio guest appearances by Clinton on a hip hop release, preceded only by Kurtis Blow's "Magilla Gorilla," released in 1986.

Both the album and the single "Kiss You Back" were certified Gold by the RIAA.
