Waldo Porter Johnson had a dozen siblings and attended public and private schools. His father had become Bridgeport's postmaster and his older brother (this boy's uncle) Joseph Johnson, was a prominent local farmer and politician who intermittently served as the area's Congressman during this boy's youth, and became Governor of Virginia in 1851, after this Johnson moved to Missouri as described below. W.P. Johnson graduated from Baptist-affiliated Rector College (Pruntytown, Virginia) in 1839.

Career

After reading law, Johnson was admitted to the Virginia bar, and began his legal practice in Harrison County, Virginia in 1841.

A year later, in 1842, Johnson moved westward to Osceola, Missouri, and continued his legal practice in the developing (and troubled) border between Missouri and what became the State of Kansas following the Missouri Compromise of 1850.

Meanwhile, Johnson volunteered to fight for slavery in the Mexicanâ€“American War, serving as a private in the First Missouri Regiment of Mounted Volunteers. In 1847 he won election to the Missouri House of Representatives and was elected circuit attorney in 1848 and judge of the seventh judicial circuit in 1851. He resigned his government positions in 1852 and resumed his private legal practice.

During the 1850s, Johnson filed several land claims with the General Land office.

Missouri voters elected Johnson as a Democrat to the United States Senate in 1860 and he served from March 17, 1861, to January 10, 1862, when he was expelled from the Senate for disloyalty to the government. He was a member of the peace convention of 1861 held in Washington, D.C., in an effort to devise means to prevent the impending American Civil War.

Johnson volunteered to serve in the Confederate Army during the Civil War, having attained the rank of Major in the Missouri State Guard. He recruited a battalion which fought in the Battle of Pea Ridge near Bentonville, Arkansas. On April 28, 1862 his unit was re organized in Memphis Tennessee as the 4th Missouri Infantry Regiment (Confederate) with Johnson as lieutenant colonel. In 1863, Johnson was appointed a member of the Confederate States Senate to fill a vacancy.

Following the Confederate surrender, from August 1865 to April 1866, Johnson resided in Hamilton, Ontario. He returned to Osceola, received a presidential pardon and resumed his legal practice. Johnson was president of the State constitutional convention in 1875.
