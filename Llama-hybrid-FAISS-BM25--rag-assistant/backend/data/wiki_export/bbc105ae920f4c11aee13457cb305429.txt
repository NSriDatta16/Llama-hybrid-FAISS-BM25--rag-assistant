Nicknamed Vickan, she was team captain on the Swedish women's national team and Djurgårdens IF Dam, captaining the national team during the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup, and is one of the most merited Swedish footballers of all time. She was originally known as Victoria Svensson, and then Victoria Sandell Svensson after marrying Camilla Sandell in April 2008 and adding her surname to her own.
