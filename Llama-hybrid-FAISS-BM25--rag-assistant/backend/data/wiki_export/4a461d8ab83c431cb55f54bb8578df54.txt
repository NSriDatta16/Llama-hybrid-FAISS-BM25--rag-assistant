Kanopolis State Park contains a reservoir, desert plants such as yucca, a prairie dog town, and scenic sandstone canyons.  It is located in the Smoky Hills region of the U.S. state of Kansas.  The park is located southwest of the city of Salina, just south of I-70.

The park, completed in 1948, includes more than 22,000 acres (89 km²) of rolling hills, bluffs and woods and a 3000 acre (12 km²) lake, offering hunting, fishing, over 25 miles (40 km) of trails, and other recreational activities. Game includes pheasant, quail, prairie chickens, deer, beaver, wild turkey, squirrels, rabbits, coyotes and waterfowl; fishing for white bass and crappie is popular. A small, outlier population of western diamondback rattlesnake is present in the park.
