Twice A Stranger: How Mass Expulsion Forged Modern Greece and Turkey (also published as Twice A Stranger: The Mass Expulsions that Forged Modern Greece and Turkey) is a book by Bruce Clark published in 2006 concerning the population exchange between Greece and Turkey which took place in the early 1920s, following the Treaty of Lausanne. 

As well as giving a detailed account of the background to the exchange, its implementation and immediate consequences, the author examines the continuing effects which it has had on the politics, culture and national identity of both the states concerned. He focuses particularly on the ambivalent feelings of the few surviving expellees and their descendants towards their former homelands.
