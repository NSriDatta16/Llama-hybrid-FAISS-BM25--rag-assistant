WUNH is a non-commercial college radio station at the University of New Hampshire, in Durham, New Hampshire. The station broadcasts alternative music, sports, and more to the community and surrounding area on 6000 watts.

History
The first radio broadcasts from campus were agricultural programs sponsored by the cooperative extension service. These were broadcast live over telephone lines to WHEB in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. In 1930, a radio station was constructed on the third floor of Thompson Hall, the main administrative building, and students from the Speech and Drama Department formed the Mike and Dial Club (WMDR), producing live dramatic plays and a variety of other shows. In 1952, a new transmitter allowed the campus to send radio signals through electrical lines on campus, and WMDR radio was born. In 1958, the station moved into the newly constructed Memorial Union Building and in 1961 successfully applied for an FM broadcasting license for WUNH. The station signed on as a 10 watt FM educational at 90.3 in 1963.

In 1972, WUNH began FM broadcasting at 1750V/1750H watts and changed its frequency to 91.3. In 1997 the station received classification as a type A radio station, and began broadcasting at 6000V/1400H watts, allowing a coverage area that spans from southeastern to central New Hampshire and extends as far north as Cumberland County in Maine and south to Essex County in Massachusetts. In 2004, the university installed a 300-watt digital transmitter for HD radio.

Programming
Shows are run by UNH students and community members. General programming shows (mostly student shows) include a minimum of 50% new (released within the past 60 days) independently released music, with no music played from the Billboard Top 40. Specialty shows focus on a specific genre and do not need to follow the new music rule. Currently, there are shows dedicated to reggae, classical, jazz, polka, bluegrass, blues, Celtic, world, Hawaiian, folk, show tunes, electronica, and metal. WUNH also broadcasts a selection of UNH football, basketball, and hockey contests. Interviews of musicians and members amongst the UNH community are done regularly as well as frequent ticket giveaways with popular music venues. The station also hosts live bands on a consistent basis, allowing WUNH to become a part of the live music circuit in the seacoast. They also host Vinyl Week, a week each semester where nothing but Vinyl is played by all DJs.
