Operational history
In a 1994 review Richard Sherwood wrote, "the Vanguard 15 is designed for college/yacht club racing fleets. Rig is simple, and the boat is a strict one-design. The deck is rounded, for easy hiking ... With the daggerboard and light weight, the boat may be easily dry sailed â€” often helpful for fleet sailing."

A 2013 review in Sail1Design noted "the Vanguard 15 boasts one of the strongest class associations of any one-design fleet, running hundreds of events each year. With fleets located across the country, there are opportunities to get involved from the club level to championship regattas. The V15 is a popular club level fleet racer as well as team racer."

In 2014, a Vanguard 15 one-design racer, John Storck III, reported that the boat was falling out of favor with college sailors and that attendance at regattas was declining.
