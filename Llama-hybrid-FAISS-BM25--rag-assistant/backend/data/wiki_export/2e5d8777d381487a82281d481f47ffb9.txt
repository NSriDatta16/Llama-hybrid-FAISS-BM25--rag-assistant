Unfinished projects 
Masoud Jafari Jozani still has a head filled with ideas and great Iranian characters. Although his three scripts: Ya'qub ibn al-Layth, Pourya-ye Vali, and Cyrus the Great have passed the first stages of production, for various reasons, they have not been completed.

Films

Baskerville 
The script is based on the life of Howard Baskerville, who was an American teacher in the American Memorial School in Tabriz who was killed during the Persian constitutional revolution and in an attempt to break the siege Tabriz. Masoud Jafari Jozani wrote this script in 1995, and the Hozeh Honari purchased it the same year. Then, in 1998, Masoud Jafari Jozani and Shahriar Rohani were bought it from the Hozeh Honari, and Ebtekar publishing published it.

In the years afterward, Masoud Jafari Jozani has signed contracts with American and Canadian film studios to produce the Baskerville film in Iran. Still, each failed for some reason, except for the most recent agreement signed with the association searching for a common ground, which even obtained official permission from the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance to produce the film. According to the American newspaper Le Figaro, an American producer decided to use Brad Pitt as Howard Baskerville; However, for whatever reason, the film was never made. Finally, the American and Iranian Screenwriters Association in the United States and Canada registered the Baskerville scripts titled after Masoud Jafari Jozani and Mohammad Mehdi Dadgoo.

In 2005 Masoud Jafari Jozani was informed that an Iranian filmmaker based in the United States announced that he was planning to travel to Turkey to make Baskerville. Jozani reacted to the media and announced that he was filing a lawsuit for stealing works of art in Iran and the United States.

In 2010 Massoud Jafari Jozani, after obtaining a filming license in the United States, decided to make the TV series Baskerville. He tries to make this TV series with the financial assistance of the Iranian and American companies, But it did not work out.

Cyrus the Great 
Masoud Jafari Jozani wrote the screenplay of Cyrus the Great in the style of an adapted screenplay based on the life story of Cyrus the Great with the researcher Fathullah Jafari Jozani and Abdul Karim Younesi.

The character of Cyrus is highly significant in terms of historical and national standing. Still, big powers without history and culture are attempting to deny Iran's position in the world, so the construction of this project was on the agenda.

Ali Moallem, one of the producers, introduced Masoud Jafari Jozani as the director. After the death of Ali Moallem, Masoud Jafari Jozani handed over the script to the investors. Before that, he covered the project costs with his capital. The project started after concluding a contract with foreign investors but stopped for some reason.

Television series

Khawaja Nasir al-Din al-Tusi 
Masoud Jafari Jozani was going to make a TV series about Nasir al-Din al-Tusi after the TV series In the Wind's Eye for Simafilm. Still, unfortunately Khawaja Nasir al-Din al-Tusi did not get made.

Pourya-ye Vali 
Masoud Jafari Jozani wrote the script for Pourya-ye Vali for a TV series in five seasons (52 episodes of 50 min). Although the contract for this series was signed in 2013 by the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting, it was not produced due to a change in management of IRIB, and Finally, Anapana Publishing published it.

Fathollah Jafari Jozani and Doctor Abdulkarim Yunesi, the researchers of this script, used over 30 books, including Jami' al-tawarikh, Tarikh-i Jahangushay, and The Cambridge History of Iran.

The life story of Pahlavān Mahmoud, more commonly known as Pouryā-ye Vali, begins in 1219 when the Mongolians assaulted Iran. Between 1270 and 1283, Iranian manufacturers were treated as slaves by the Mongol rulers and compelled to build weapons for them. Rural subjects who couldn't pay their taxes for themselves and their families were sold. During this time, Pouria-ye Vali was able to bring together liberals and fighters by organizing and building traditional sporting halls known as Zurkhaneh.

The other historical characters of this script we may mention are Saadi Shirazi, Ubayd Zakani, Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, Rashid al-Din Hamadani, and the wrestling champion File Hamedani.

Ya'qub ibn al-Layth 
Masoud Jafari Jozani and the Farabi Cinema Foundation concluded the contract for Ya'qub ibn al-Layth. Ya'qub ibn al-Layth's screenplay about the founder of the Saffarid dynasty in Sistan and his chivalry, simple life, and his role in history in uniting the Iranian people.

Ya'qub ibn al-Layth al-Saffar was a young Ayyār who was under the influence of Rostam's stories, decided to help the poor and oppressed people with the help of the small group of young Ayyars that had gathered around him and in the opinion of the people of Sistan became a legendary champion. The script will be aired on the Home Video.

Jafari Jozani has mentioned this point in one of his interviews that:"Unfortunately, our children know more about Robin Hood than Ya'gub Al-Layth while he is one of the historical figures who has founded Ayyār-i and Futuwwa in Iran and teaches the youth how a better life is possible."

International praise and criticism

Los Angeles Times, American newspaper 

Kevin Thomas, a journalist of the Los Angeles Times newspaper, in an article entitled "Iran's 'Man, a Bear' Finds Humor, Heart" wrote about the movie A Man and a Bear directed by Masoud Jafari Jozani, published on 12 July 1996, issue of Los Angeles Times:"Once past an awkward start, Masoud Jafari Jozani's "A Man, a Bear" emerges as a courageous satirical allegory on authoritarianism and hardship in contemporary Iran."

"Yet, along with its outspokenness, "A Man, a Bear" is also a warm, endearing and often very funny film."

The Guardian, British newspaper 
Ben Walters published a report entitled "First Iranian film shot in US since 1979 gets under way" in The Guardian on 1 September 2009:Production is to begin on the first Iranian film shot in the US since the Islamic Revolution. In the Wind's Eye, directed by veteran filmmaker Masoud Jafari Jozani, is also reported to have the highest-ever budget for an Iranian film at $12m (£7.3m).

Variety, American newspaper 
Variety, the oldest and most prestigious magazine in world cinema, in a report on 8 September 2009 entitled "Open door policy: L.A. lures Iran crew" examined the production of the series In the Wind's Eye and stated at the beginning of its report:As the American public was riveted by the spectacle of riot police suppressing the massive demonstrations disputing the results of Iran's June 12 election, one crack appeared in the wall between the two countries. Surprisingly, Iranian helmer Masoud Jafari Jozani managed to secure visas for members of his cast and crew to travel to and film in the U.S. — the first Iranian production to do so since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

Indiewire 
Indiewire, a film industry and review website, wrote in a report on the production of the series In the Wind's Eye entitled "Jafari project the first Iranian production filming in the U.S. since the Islamic Revolution in 1979":
Based on a 52-hour epic television series that took four years to produce and recently began airing on Iranian television, "Dar Chashme Bad", production has begun in Los Angeles on a companion feature film, "In The Wind's Eye". Following three generations of Iranians from 1920 through 1981, with an overall budget of $12 million, the project will be the longest running and most expensive production in that country's film industry's history. It is also the first Iranian production filmed in the US since the revolution in 1979. Veteran filmmaker, Masoud Jafari Jozani, has written and directed each episode of the series, as well as the screenplay for the feature film, which will be released in theatres in Iran.

The National, UAE newspaper 
James Reinl, A reporter from the United States, wrote in a report entitled "Iranian movie cameras roll in US" about the permission to shoot In the Wind's Eye in the National newspaper on 14 September 2009:
As Washington and Tehran perform a diplomatic dance over Iran's suspected nuclear weapons programme, one group of Iranian filmmakers has benefited from the apparent thaw in relations between the long-standing enemies. Masoud Jafari Jozani, an Iranian director, secured a dozen visas to enter the United States and film a movie. "This would have been unheard of a year ago," said Jozani, who is filming In the Wind's Eye in California. He described his Iranian crew as the first such group of film-makers granted entry to the United States since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
