Pain of Mind is the debut studio album by Californian band Neurosis, originally released on Alchemy Records in 1987. It was later reissued by Alternative Tentacles in 1994 and by Neurot Recordings in 2000; the 2000 reissue contains a special bonus disc that includes live tracks, live radio tracks, and demo tracks. Pennsylvanian politician Budd Dwyer is pictured on the front cover of the 1994 vinyl release, moments before he committed suicide during a televised press conference in 1987.
