Johannes Rosinus (Johann Roszfeld) (c. 1550 â€“ 1626) was the German author of a work on Roman Antiquity called Antiquitatum romanarum corpus absolutissimum, which first appeared at Basel in 1585.

He studied at Jena, and became sub-rector of a school at Regensburg.  He also served as minister of a Lutheran church at Wickerstadt in Weimar. He later preached at the cathedral church in Naumburg, Saxony.

Rosinus' work went through a series of editions with subsequent editors including Thomas Dempster, Paolo Manuzio, Andreas Schott, and Samuel Pitiscus.

Dempster's dedication of his edition of Rosinus' Antiquitatum romanarum corpus absolutissimum to King James I won him an invitation to the English court.
