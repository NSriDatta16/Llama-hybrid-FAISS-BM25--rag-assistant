He played in the Football League for Hull City, Derby County, Queens Park Rangers, Sheffield Wednesday, Millwall, Bradford City and Burton Albion before finishing his career in Non-league football with Harrogate Town, Scarborough Athletic and North Ferriby United.

Career

Hull City
Bolder began his career in Hull City where he signed his first professional contract in August 1998. His first league game for Hull was against Hartlepool United in January 1999 and that was his only league game for the Tigers in the 1998–99 season. After playing 19 league games for Hull in the first part of the 1999–2000 season he left the club.

Derby County
Bolder signed for Derby County in March 2000. His first match for Derby was against Manchester United in May 2001 and his second league game this season came against Ipswich Town two weeks later. The following season, he made 11 league appearances for the Rams before he established himself as a first team player with 45 league games and six league goals in the 2002–03 season. His first league goal came in August 2002 against Grimsby Town. Derby won that game 2–1 and Bolder scored both goals for Derby. Bolder then played in 24 league games and scored one league goal in the 2003–04 season, 36 league games and two league goals in the 2004–05 season and 35 league games and two league goals in the 2005–06 season. After playing 13 league games in the first part of the 2006–07 season for Derby, Bolder went out of the first team in early November 2006 and his final appearance for the club from Derbyshire came in a league game against West Bromwich Albion in December 2006.

Queens Park Rangers
In January 2007 Bolder signed a two-and-a-half-year-long contract for Queens Park Rangers, where he was reunited with his former boss, John Gregory. QPR were struggling at the time, and there was a lack of grit and determination within the team. Bolder came in, and added steel to the midfield, with some good tackling performances and an excellent range of passing. Combined with the signings of Danny Cullip and Lee Camp (on loan), Bolder helped QPR to avoid relegation, quite comfortably in the end and was named as club captain. On 27 October 2007, Bolder scored his first goal for Queens Park Rangers in a 1–0 win over Charlton Athletic at The Valley which lifted QPR off the bottom of the table. On 8 February 2008, it was announced that Bolder would be joining fellow Championship side Sheffield Wednesday on a month's loan, which was later extended to the end of the 2007–08 season. On 8 April 2008 Bolder scored his first goals in an Owls shirt, netting twice in the Steel City Derby against Sheffield United in a 2–2 draw.

Millwall
He joined Millwall initially on loan on 6 November 2008, before joining them permanently on 29 January 2009, in a deal that will keep him at the club until 2011.

On 5 March 2010 Bolder joined League Two side Bradford City on a one-month loan deal. During his spell at Bradford he scored once against Morecambe.

Burton Albion
Bolder signed for Football League Two side Burton Albion on 22 July 2010.

Non-League

On 26 November 2017 Bolder signed for North Ferriby United with his brother Chris being appointed as manager 2 days later.
