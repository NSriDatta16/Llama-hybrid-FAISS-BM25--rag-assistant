Zemu Gap  Peak or  Zemu  Peak () is a peak on a high ridge running east of the south summit of Kangchenjunga in the Himalayas. It is located in Sikkim, India. It is one of the highest unclimbed named peaks of the world. There have been no known attempts to climb this peak.

Because of its extremely low topographic prominence, Zemu Gap Peak does not appear on lists of highest unclimbed mountains nor on lists of highest mountains of the world. The website Peakware.com describes the peak as "...one of the highest unclimbed peaks that is not a sub-peak of another massif".
