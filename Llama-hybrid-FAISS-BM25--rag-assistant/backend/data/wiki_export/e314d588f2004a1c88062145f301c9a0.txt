Student life
Homecoming is an honored tradition at Woodbridge and "Spirit Week" is part of the Homecoming celebration. Each of the five days has a different theme. The themes for "Spirit Week" are chosen by the Student Activities Leadership Council.  On Friday of "Spirit Week", the Pep Rally is held in the football stadium allowing all the students and faculty to watch or participate.  The Homecoming Parade is later held that afternoon, usually going down Antietam Road to the school.  The Homecoming Parade floats made by clubs/organizations from the school.  Later that Friday evening, the Homecoming Game is held at the WSHS football field and the Homecoming rock and banner winners are announced, as well as the Homecoming King and Queen. The Homecoming Dance is then held on the Saturday night of Spirit Week.
