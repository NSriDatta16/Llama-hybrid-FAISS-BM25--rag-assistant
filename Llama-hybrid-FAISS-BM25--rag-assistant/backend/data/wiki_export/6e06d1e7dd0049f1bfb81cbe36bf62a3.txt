An attorney by training, Hart practiced law in Washington, D.C., and served as law clerk to James T. Turner of the United States Court of Federal Claims. He graduated from the Catholic University of America in 1982 with a B.A. and received an Alumni Award in 1997. He received his J.D. from the Fordham University School of Law.

Clinton Administration 
In late 1992, Hart was part of a group which began planning for the Bill Clinton transition to the White House prior to the election to be held in November of that year. He had previously been the chief delegate counter.

During the Clinton Administration, Hart served for four years as Deputy Assistant to the President and Deputy Director of Intergovernmental Affairs. In that capacity, he served as President Clinton's representative to state and local elected officials on federal-state policy, and was on an informal panel that the Clintons consulted on Catholic affairs. Under Attorney General Janet Reno, Hart was appointed as Principal Deputy Director at the United States Department of Justice, Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS). At COPS, he was responsible for the management and administration of a $1.4 billion annual budget and a 250-member staff which was responsible for coordinating between federal, state, and local governments to institute community policing initiatives.
