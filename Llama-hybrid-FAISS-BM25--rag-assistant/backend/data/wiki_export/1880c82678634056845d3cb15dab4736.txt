Brett James Ogle (born 14 July 1964) is an Australian professional golfer.

Early life
Ogle was born in Paddington, New South Wales. He was adopted at six weeks of age and was brought up in the town of Goulburn. 

He took up the game in his early teens and reduced his golfing handicap from 32 to 1 in just two years. He was the Senior and Junior Club Champion at his home club in Goulburn, Tully Park. His first breakthrough win was at the Senior and Junior Club Champion of Champions event at the Federal Golf Club in 1980, a tournament that pitted all of the NSW Club Champions together. Ogle then won the New South Wales Junior in 1984 and 1985. Later in 1985, he won the New South Wales Amateur

Professional career
In 1985, he turned pro. In 1986, Ogle had his breakthrough win on the South Pacific Tour by winning the Fijian Hotel Pro-am. He also won the Pacific Budget Rent a Car Open held at Pacific Harbour Golf Course.

After a stint on the Asian Tour and Japan Golf Tour, Ogle headed to the European Qualifying tournament in Spain at the end of 1987 where he was successful in gaining a full-time playing card for that Tour. In 1988, Ogle won his first big event on the PGA Tour of Australasia winning the Tasmanian Open. Later that year he finished third behind Rodger Davis and Fred Couples at the Bicentennial Classic. In 1989, Ogle broke through on the European Tour winning the Equity & Law Challenge, an unofficial event, and then in 1990 claimed the AGF Open, an official event, in France. That year he had his best finish on the Order of Merit, 24th place. He also ended the 1989 and 1992 seasons inside the top 30.

At the end of 1992, Ogle tied for medalist honors at the PGA Tour Qualifying Tournament. He won his first PGA Tour title in just his fourth event of 1993, the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am. He won one other tournament on the tour, the Hawaiian Open in 1994. He was unable to maintain that form as he struggled with the yips, and lost his card at the end of the 1996 season.

Since retiring from Tournament golf in 2002, Ogle was lead analyst and commentator for Fox Sports until retiring from the organization in 2016. Ogle is also the brand Ambassador for Australia's biggest golf retailer Drummond Golf.
