"Gourmandises" (English: "Delicacies") is a song by Alizée, released in 2001. Like Alizée's previous singles, this too features a single version and an instrumental rendering.

Music video
The video for the single was directed by Nicolas Hidiroglou, and was premiered on 25 July 2001 in M6. The video was nominated in 2002 in the EFD awards. In the video Alizée is featured in a park with her friends, having a picnic complete with candy and fruits. Towards the last chorus of the video, all the delicacies spill, and Alizée and her friends run, play and laugh together. The entire video shows bliss.
