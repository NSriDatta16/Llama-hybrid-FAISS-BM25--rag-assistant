Ahmići () is a village in central Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is located in the municipality of Vitez in the Lašva river valley.

In April 1993 during the Lašva Valley ethnic cleansing, the Croatian Defence Council forces attacked the village and massacred around 120 civilians in the Ahmići massacre. Since then many survivors have returned and have begun to rebuild their homes.
