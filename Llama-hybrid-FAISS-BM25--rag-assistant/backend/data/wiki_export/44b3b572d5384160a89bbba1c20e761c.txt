Plot
Kathy has seemingly been happily married to Peter, but their relationship has grown routine. She cannot help but wonder what would happen if she ever got together with her high school sweetheart, Tom, whom she had never slept with. 

Being married prevents Kathy from finding out what happened to Tom, so she asks her single, promiscuous, commitment-phobic friend Emily to do it for her. She asks her to look him up when she goes to Denver, sleep with him, then tell Kathy what it was like. 

Emily does this, but when she tells Kathy that Tom is awesome and they had sex all night, their friendship suffers, as does Kathy's marriage. Kathy becomes even more distracted, and regularly tries to seduce oblivious Peter. 

At the opening of Elliot, Emily's young lover, the women again talk about Tom. Emily  storms off, leaving Kathy to comfort him, which Peter observes. 

Things become even more complicated when Emily learns she is pregnant, and says she is uncertain if Tom or her 'boyfriend' Elliot is the father. Kathy tells Elliot about the pregnancy, simultaneously a work colleague of Peter's convinces him she may be cheating. Secretly following her, it seems like she's having an affair with Elliot.

Elliot has a show in Denver, and Kathy ends up on the same flight. She tells him the baby is actually Tom's, so she's going to find out if they still have a spark. As her room in the Hyatt isn't ready yet, she leaves her bag with Elliot to look for Tom.

As Tom has just finished a fishing competition, they go to his cabin so he can shower. In the meantime, Peter shows up at the hotel, hitting Elliot before he can explain. He then heads to get his wife Kathy, Emily soon follows. Her taxi beats Peter's, so she can warn Kathy. In the end both women and all three men are at the cabin, the two couples reconciling and Tom showing he's not relationship or father material. Kathy helps Emily plan her wedding with Elliot.
