The Fauconberg Arms is a 17th-century Coaching inn in Coxwold, North Yorkshire, England. The village and estate were given to the Fauconberg family by Henry VIII. The property is still owned by the Newburgh Priory Estate and is named after the Earl of Fauconberg. It serves  beer and a selection of food and is close to Shandy Hall and the Kilburn White Horse.

The Fauconberg Arms re-opened in November 2006 after being closed for almost two years. The new proprietors - Simon and Helen Rheinberg and their daughter and her husband, Harriet and Jonathan Chadwick, have refurbished the pub's bar, cellar, dining room and kitchens. The renovated en-suite B&B bedrooms reopened in spring 2007.

The inn was highly commended in Yorkshire Pub of the Year 2013, and received a good review from The Yorkshire Post (Pub of the Week) in April 2013, but a November 2014 review thought little of the cuisine.
