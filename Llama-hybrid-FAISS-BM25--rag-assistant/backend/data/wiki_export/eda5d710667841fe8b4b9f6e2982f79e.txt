Ed Tse-chun Young (; November 28, 1931 – September 29, 2023) was a Chinese-born American illustrator and writer of children's picture books. He has received many awards and recognitions, including the Caldecott Medal and Lifetime Achievement awards for his contributions as a children's illustrator.

Biography
Ed Young was born on November 28, 1931, in Tianjin, China. When he was three years old, he and his family moved to Shanghai. From an early age, Ed loved to create stories and draw pictures.

In 1951, Young came to the U.S. to study architecture. He grew more interested in art and switched his major. Young's first job was with a New York advertising agency where he spent his lunch breaks sketching animals at the Central Park Zoo. He died at his home in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York on September 29, 2023, at the age of 91.

Work
Young's first book, The Mean Mouse and Other Mean Stories, was published by Harper & Row in 1962. He expected it to be his first and last book, but it won an American Institute of Graphic Arts award and launched his career. Most of his books use colours and images to convey hidden symbolism, and utilize pencil, pastel, cut paper, collage, ink, photographs, light and shadows, and found materials.

The subject and style of each story provide Young with the initial inspiration for his art. Young based his work on research, believing a strong foundation of credibility must be established in order to create new and exciting images.

Young won the 1990 Caldecott Medal for illustrating Lon Po Po, his version of a Red-Riding Hood story from China. The annual award from the American Library Association recognizes the previous year's "most distinguished American picture book for children". He had also been a runner-up twice (two Honor Books), for The Emperor and the Kite and Seven Blind Mice. For his lifetime contribution as a children's illustrator, he was U.S. nominee in both 1992 and 2000 for the biennial, international Hans Christian Andersen Award. In 2016, Young was honoured with Lifetime Achievement Awards from the Eric Carle Museum and the Society of Illustrators.

Exhibits
Young's original art for his books has been the subject of many exhibits such as "Journey Without End" at the National Center for Children's Illustrated Literature in Abilene, Texas (2011–2012). He has participated in many group shows such as the Michaelson Gallery's Children’s Illustration Celebration and the Eric Carle Museum.

T'ai chi

In 1964, Young met the renowned t'ai chi master, Cheng Man-ch'ing. He became one of Cheng's top disciples in America, and was one of his two principal translators. Sent by Cheng, Young began teaching t'ai chi in Hastings-on-Hudson in 1971. Young taught t'ai chi for over four decades in his hometown and other venues such as Yale University and Naropa University, and workshops around the United States.
