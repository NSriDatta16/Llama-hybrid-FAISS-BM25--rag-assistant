The 1992–93 season of the European Cup Winners' Cup was won by Parma in the final against Royal Antwerp. Both were first time finalists in the competition, and Antwerp were the last Belgian side to reach a European final up to the present day. The competition had more entrants than ever before due to the break-up of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, resulting in many new countries eligible to enter the winners of their own cups into the competition. Israel, the Faroe Islands and Liechtenstein were also represented for the first time.
