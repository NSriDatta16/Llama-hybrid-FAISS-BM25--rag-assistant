Accidents and incidents 

 On November 9, 2008, a Rotorway Executive 162F experimental helicopter was damaged during an engine runup at the Summit Airport. The helicopter's chain drive oil system had just been repaired. The probable cause of the accident was found to be the student pilot’s excessive use of cyclic during the engine run-up. Contributing to the accident were the pilot’s inexperience and gusting wind conditions.
 On December 1, 2008, a Piper PA-32 experienced a "sudden loss of airspeed and rapid increase in descent rate that was not altered by the application of power." The aircraft made it to the airport, but it landed hard and all three landing gear collapsed. The aircraft slid off the runway, and the wing spar and engine firewall were damaged. After the accident, the pilot said he had been flying from the right seat, making it difficult to read the instruments; the pilot also said he had encountered windshear on final. The probable cause of the accident was found to be the pilot's failure to maintain aircraft control while landing in gusty conditions.
 A small plane crashed near the airport in April 2010.
 On August 18, 2013, a Cessna 172S Skyhawk crashed while on a student pilot solo flight. On the last landing, the plane touched down hard and bounced. The pilot tried to release back pressure to compensate, and the aircraft bounced again. After the power was pulled to idle, the plane hit the ground a third time and came to a stop. The probable cause of the accident was found to be the student pilot’s improper recovery from a bounced landing.
