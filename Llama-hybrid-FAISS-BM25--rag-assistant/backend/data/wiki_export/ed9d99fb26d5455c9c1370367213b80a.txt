A mini survival kit contains essential outdoor survival tools and supplies. It is intended to be carried on one's person at all times, be appropriate to all environments, and be a comprehensive kit without being too large. Mini survival kits are intended to provide the basic needs of a survival situation, self-rescue, assistance or a return to normalcy in optimum situations.

Two philosophies surround the preparation of mini survival kits. Some are prepared with a few comparatively large items such as a knife, matches, a whistle, emergency food, and water bottle. Others are a collection of small, useful items such as rubber bands, paper clips, fishing equipment, lashing material, and razor blades. The technique depends on factors such as one's physical condition, survival skills, and wilderness knowledge.

Container 
Survival tools and supplies found in a mini survival kit are generally kept in a container that is small enough to fit into a pocket. Small confectionery tins are commonly used but regular tobacco boxes, specially purchased mini-survival kit tins, life capsules, 35mm film canisters, plastic bottles, tin cans, and boxes are also commonly used. The common breath mint containers such as Altoids tins measure approximately  x  x .  Some kinds of containers benefit from waterproofing, which may be done with adhesive tape or by dipping the closed container in paraffin wax.

Mini-survival-kit items can be carried on a neck chain, a satchel, a pouch or a belt kit pouch. Survival items may also be part of the belt kit itself.
