Literary works
  How to Breathe Underwater contains nine short stories, many of them about characters submerged by loss, whether of parents or lovers or a viable relationship to the world in general.  In "Pilgrims," a band of motherless children torment each other on Thanksgiving day.  In "The Isabel Fish," the sole survivor of a drowning accident takes up scuba diving.  In "When She is Old and I am Famous," a young woman confronts the inscrutable power of her cousin's beauty.  In "The Smoothest Way is Full of Stones," the failure of religious and moral codes—to protect, to comfort, to offer solace—is seen through the eyes of a group of Orthodox Jewish adolescents discovering the irresistible power of their sexuality. How to Breathe Underwater is a New York Times Notable Book, a San Francisco Chronicle Best Book of the Year, and the winner of the Northern California Book Award and Cowan Writers’ Award, Jewish Community Endowment (2006).

  Julie Orringer's first novel was the winner of the Wallant Award (University of Hartford, 2010), and named a finalist for the James Tait Black Prize (University of Edinburgh, 2011), Orange Prize (2011), Sami Rohr Prize (2011), and the First Novel Prize, Center for Fiction, New York (2010).  The Invisible Bridge is the story of a young Hungarian-Jewish student who leaves Budapest in 1937 to study architecture in Paris. There he meets and falls in love with a ballet teacher.  The student and ballet teacher are then caught up in the second world war with their families and struggle to survive. It was a New York Times Notable Book (2010) and named a Best Book of 2010 by The San Francisco Chronicle, Boston Globe, The Washington Post, and Entertainment Weekly. 
 The Flight Portfolio is a novel based on the true story of Varian Fry, an American journalist who, in 1940, went to occupied Europe to help rescue Jewish artists fleeing the Holocaust. It received the Association of Jewish Libraries Award (2020), and was named a finalist for the American Library in Paris Book Award (2019). The novel also inspired the 2023 Netflix series Transatlantic.
