Robert K. Weiss is an American film and television producer. His productions include films by director John Landis, producer Lorne Michaels and the "Z. A. Z." team of Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker. He also co-created the science-fiction TV series Sliders. He is a graduate of Southern Illinois University Carbondale. 

Weiss has been the President and Vice Chairman of the X Prize Foundation since 1996. 

In the film Blues Brothers 2000, the name of Robert K. Weiss is mentioned (to the confusion of Donald "Duck" Dunn) in a speech by Elwood Blues as the final name in a long list of legendary blues and soul artists that Elwood names to convince his band not to quit. This is presumably a reference to how Weiss convinced Dan Aykroyd (who portrayed Elwood) and director John Landis not to quit the film.
