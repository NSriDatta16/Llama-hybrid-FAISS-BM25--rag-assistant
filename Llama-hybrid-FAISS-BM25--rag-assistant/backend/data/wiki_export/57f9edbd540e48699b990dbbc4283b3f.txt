The following is a list of spreadsheets.

Free and open-source software

Cloud and on-line spreadsheets

Spreadsheets that are parts of suites 
 Apache OpenOffice Calc — for MS Windows, Linux and the Apple Macintosh. Started as StarOffice, later as OpenOffice.org. It has not received a major update since 2014 and security fixes have not been prompt.
 Collabora Online Calc — Enterprise-ready LibreOffice, included with Online, Mobile and Desktop apps
 Gnumeric — for Linux.  Started as the GNOME desktop spreadsheet.  Reasonably lightweight but has very advanced features.
 KSpread — following the fork of the Calligra Suite from KOffice in mid-2010, superseded by KCells in KOffice and Sheets in the Calligra Suite.
 LibreOffice Calc — developed for MS Windows, Linux, BSD and Apple Macintosh (Mac) operating systems by The Document Foundation.  The Document Foundation was formed in mid-2010 by several large organisations such as Google, Red Hat, Canonical (Ubuntu) and Novell along with the OpenOffice.org community (developed by Sun) and various OpenOffice.org forks, notably Go-oo. Go-oo had been the "OpenOffice" used in Ubuntu and elsewhere.  Started as StarOffice in the late 1990s, it became OpenOffice under Sun and then LibreOffice in mid-2010.  The Document Foundation works with external organisations such as NeoOffice and Apache Foundation to help drive all three products forward.
 NeoOffice Calc — for Mac.  Started as an OpenOffice.org port to Mac, but by using the Mac-specific Aqua user interface, instead of the more widely used X11 windowing server, it aimed to be far more stable than the normal ports of other suites.
 Siag — for Linux, OpenBSD and Apple Mac OS X.  A simple old spreadsheet, part of Siag Office.
 Sheets — for MS Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, Apple Mac OS X and Haiku.  Part of the extensive Calligra Suite.  Possibly still mainly for Linux, but ports have been developed for other operating systems.
