Early years
Agnew was born in New York City, the son of William Agnew and Elizabeth Thompson Agnew; his ancestors, Huguenot, Irish and Scotch, came to America from time to time during the 18th century. He entered the Columbia College in 1845 and graduated from there in 1849 with the degree of A.B. He then received the degree of M.D. from the New York College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1852. In 1856, he married Mary Nash, daughter of Lora Nash, a New York merchant.

Career
Agnew began to practice medicine in 1854 and became house surgeon, and later curator, at the New York Hospital. He went to Europe for special study in his profession, and on his return was appointed surgeon to the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary, from 1855 through 1864.

He was appointed surgeon-general of the State of New York in 1858; during the American Civil War, he was medical director of the New York Volunteer Hospital, treating wounded soldiers from the Union Army. He was prominent in the United States Sanitary Commission, which administered supplies and medical assistance to the field armies.

In 1869 he was elected to the clinical professorship of diseases of the eye and ear in the College of Physicians and Surgeons, a position which he held till his death on April 18, 1888, in New York City.

Legacy
A part of the success of the United States Sanitary Commission must be attributed to Dr. Agnew's labors. He prepared many papers relating to the eye and ear, and published in the current medical journals, also, a Series of American Clinical Lectures (1875), edited by E. C. Sequin (M.D.), besides numerous brief monographs.

Agnew's papers were donated to the National Library of Medicine in the late 1980s.
