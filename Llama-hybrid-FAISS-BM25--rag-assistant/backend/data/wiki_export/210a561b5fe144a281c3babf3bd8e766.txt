Eugene Ehrlich (21 May 1922 – 5 April 2008) was a lexicographer and author.

He was a member of the Department of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University, where he taught in the Department of General Studies.  A reading specialist, he prepared generations of adult students for the rigors of university work after years of absence from any academic setting.  His books about language are very well regarded for their clarity and humor and were introduced by such word luminaries as William F. Buckley, Richard Lederer, and Noah Adams, who also featured Mr. Ehrlich's language commentary on his public radio broadcasts.  William Safire occasionally cited Mr. Ehrlich in his writing on language.

He was quoted as saying that his higher mission was "being the antidote to the 'effects wrought by the forces of linguistic darkness.'”
