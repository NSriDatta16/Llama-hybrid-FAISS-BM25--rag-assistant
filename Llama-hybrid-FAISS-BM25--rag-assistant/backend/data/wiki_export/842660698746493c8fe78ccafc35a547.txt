Allan Dean (born April 29, 1938) is an American trumpeter who has spent much of his career working as a chamber music player in the United States.  Mr. Dean's career is particularly well established in the New York musical sceneâ€”primarily because of his long involvement with the New York Brass Quintet. While in New York City, he was a prolific commercial trumpeter, recording jingles for everything from ABC Nightly News to the Olympics. He is also a founding member of Summit Brass, and currently plays with the Saint Louis Brass Quintet. His arrangements are often featured on recordings with these ensembles.

Dean was also involved in the period instrument revival in the 1960s and '70s in the United States. He was one of the first American trumpeters to master the natural trumpet and the  cornetto. He was a charter member of Calliope (Renaissance band), the groundbreaking period instrument group, which is no longer active.

Mr. Dean has taught at the Eastman School of Music, Indiana University, and the North Carolina School of the Arts. In 2019 he retired from the Yale School of Music in New Haven, Connecticut and is on faculty at the Norfolk Chamber Music Festival in Norfolk, Connecticut.
