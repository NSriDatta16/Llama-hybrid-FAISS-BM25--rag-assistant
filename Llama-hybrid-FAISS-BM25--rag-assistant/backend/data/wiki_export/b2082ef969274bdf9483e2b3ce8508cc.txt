The Treaty of Hamburg was signed on 22 May 1762 in Hamburg between Sweden and Prussia during the Pomeranian War, a theater of the Seven Years' War.

The treaty came into being after Russia had allied to Prussia on 5 May, making it impossible for Sweden to continue the war which they had entered to regain territories in Pomerania, which they had previously lost. The treaty reaffirmed the pre-war status quo.
