Hammondbeat Records, (founded 2002) is an American record label dedicated to bands and fans of the organ sound.  Hammondbeat finds its origins in 1997 as the fan website JTQgroove for the Hammond organ led Acid Jazz band (James Taylor Quartet). Over the first five years, JTQgroove grew as a fan collective that moved well beyond the constraints of one artist, and soon attracted many next-generation organ-centric bands, leading to a recording project with The Link Quartet (Piacenza, Italy). The Link Quartet were greatly influenced by the sound established by JTQ 15 years earlier.  Beat.It was the project, and while JTQ influences can be heard, The Link Quartet found themselves leaders with 10 years or more professional experience from each founding member, and Paolo Negri on keys.

Unlike most labels, Hammondbeat doesn't involve a particular genre in the traditional sense, but rather embraces all genres of music which the organ sound has influenced. As such, Hammondbeat's range is ever-expanding. Hammondbeat considers all opportunities both artistic and overtly commercial to be fair game. Hammondbeat controls most of its catalog to be both entertainment and content for the marketing and synchronization world.

In addition to operating as record label, Hammondbeat is also an online community connecting fans to hundreds of organ bands and the indie labels that support them. It includes discographies, downloads, web radio, forum, and a mailing list.
