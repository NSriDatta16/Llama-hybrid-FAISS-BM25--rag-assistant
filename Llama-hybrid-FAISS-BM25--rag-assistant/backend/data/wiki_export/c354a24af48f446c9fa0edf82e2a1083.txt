The United States Collegiate Athletic Association (USCAA) is a national organization for the intercollegiate athletic programs of 72 mostly small colleges, including community/junior colleges, across the United States. The USCAA holds 15 national championships and 2 national invitationals annually.

History 
In , the USCAA was founded as the National Little College Athletic Association (NLCAA), primarily to sponsor a national basketball tournament for small colleges and junior colleges.

In the 1970s and through the 1980s, as the NLCAA, the USCAA began adding more sports.

In 1989, the NLCAA changed its name to the National Small College Athletic Association (NSCAA).

In 2001, the USCAA adopted its current name.
