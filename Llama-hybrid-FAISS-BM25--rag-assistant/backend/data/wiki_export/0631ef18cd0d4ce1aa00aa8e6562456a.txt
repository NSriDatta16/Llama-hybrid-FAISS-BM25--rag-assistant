The Palm Springs Air Museum (PSAM), is a aviation museum in Palm Springs, California focused on World War II aviation. Many of these aircraft have been used by motion picture companies in movies.

Located on the north-east side of the Palm Springs International Airport, the museum is made up of three main display hangars, theater, gift shop, ramp and airport access for flight demonstrations and visiting planes, research library, simulator and education center.

The museum also houses an extensive collection of aviation art by Stan Stokes.

History
The museum was founded by Bob Pond and Pete Madison. It opened to the public on 11 November 1996. Originally operating in concert with the Planes of Fame East Museum in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, following the closure of that museum the aircraft were moved to the Palm Springs Air Museum. The museum opened a new hangar, named for Major General Ken Miles, in May 2017.

The museum announced plans to renovate its entrance and add a large classroom in 2022.
