"On Your Own" is a song by English rock band Blur. It was released as a single on 16 June 1997 from the band's fifth studio album, Blur (1997). It charted at number five on the UK Singles Chart. Although it was not released under the Gorillaz name, Damon Albarn, frontman of both musical projects, has since referred the song as 'one of the first ever Gorillaz tunes'.

Music video
The music video for "On Your Own" was directed by Sophie Muller and recorded in Barcelona, in what at the time was an industrial site, by the Besos Water Tower.

B-sides
The B-sides were all recorded at John Peel's home studio: Peel Acres. They were previously broadcast on BBC Radio 1 on 8 May 1997. Stickered copies of CD1 and the white vinyl 7-inch features the text 'includes POPSCENE'. This is because "Popscene" did not appear on the UK version of Modern Life is Rubbish and was, therefore, rare and sought after by fans until its inclusion on Midlife: A Beginner's Guide to Blur. The version that appears here merges into "Song 2". All of Blur's Peel Sessions were later released on the second disc of the Japan only compilation Bustin' + Dronin', an album that features three versions of "On Your Own".
