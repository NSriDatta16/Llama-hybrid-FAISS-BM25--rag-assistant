(24 April 1940 – 7 March 2019) was a Japanese photographer who "[combined] a pure appreciation of Japanese customs with a sharp investigative eye".

Life and career
Born—as Kazumasa Suda ( Suda Kazumasa)—in Kanda, Tokyo on 24 April 1940, Suda dropped out of Toyo University in 1961 and entered Tokyo College of Photography, from which he graduated in 1962.

From 1967 to 1971, Suda worked as the cameraman of the theatrical group Tenjō Sajiki, under Shūji Terayama. He worked as a freelance photographer from 1971. His first photobook, Fūshi kaden, was named after a treatise by Zeami Motokiyo; it won a Photographic Society of Japan newcomer's award in 1976. His fourth, Ningen no kioku, won the Domon Ken Award in 2014.

Suda was a professor at Osaka University of Arts.

He died at the age of 78 on 7 March 2019.
