Patrick Daughters (born 1976 in Berkeley, California) is an American music videomaker and commercial director currently signed to Anonymous Content.

Daughters is a graduate of Walt Whitman High School in Bethesda, Maryland. While still in college, he gained attention with three award-winning short films: In Life We Soar, Any Creature about a young girl who witnesses a mysterious car accident, and Unloved. Unloved earned Daughters the $20,000 Grand Prize Award at Nintendo's Eternal Darkness film contest in 2002. He started directing music videos in 2003.

In December 2003 he directed a concert film for The Rapture titled The Rapture is Live, and Well, in New York City, filmed over a 3-day residency at New York's Bowery Ballroom, released on June 28, 2004.

His video for "1234" by Feist, consists of one single continuous tracking shot, and was nominated for a Grammy and won the award for Best International Video at the British CADs. The video was featured in "Stacks", a late 2007 commercial spot for the release of the third generation iPod nano directed by Mark Coppos and Virginia Lee.

He has also directed commercials for the ONDCP, PETA, Microsoft Zune, Ford, Clarks, Motorola ROKR E8 and Wrigley's. He frequently collaborates with cinematographer Shawn Kim and editor Anthony Cerniello.
