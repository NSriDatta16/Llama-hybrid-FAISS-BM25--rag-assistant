The Mkhitar Heratsi Yerevan State Medical University (YSMU, ), is an Armenian medical university located in Yerevan, Armenia.

History
On 31 January 1920, during the First Republic of Armenia, the People's University of Armenia opened in Alexandropol, with the presence of prime minister Alexander Khatisian and minister of culture and public education Nikol Aghbalian. In October of the same year, a decision was passed by then-minister of education Gevorg Ghazarian to establish the faculty of medicine in the university. However, due to political circumstances, the plan was never fulfilled. Armenia became a republic in December 1920.

In 1920, the medical faculty of Yerevan was founded by the government of Armenia.
