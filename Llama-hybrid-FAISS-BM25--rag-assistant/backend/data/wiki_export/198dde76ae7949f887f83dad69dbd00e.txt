The original location for the settlement known as Five Mile Creek was approximately  north of the present township. The restored Royal Mail Hotel still stands on this site although it is now a private residence.

The Post Office opened on 16 January 1858, in the Royal Mail Hotel (then the Drovers and Carriers Arms), but was named Lancefield until 19 January 1860 and Five Mile Creek until March 1860. The Post Office was moved closer to the centre of the present township in 1864.

The area was serviced by three local newspapers.

The former Romsey station was a significant stopping point on the now dismantled Clarkefield-Lancefield railway between 1881 and 1956.
