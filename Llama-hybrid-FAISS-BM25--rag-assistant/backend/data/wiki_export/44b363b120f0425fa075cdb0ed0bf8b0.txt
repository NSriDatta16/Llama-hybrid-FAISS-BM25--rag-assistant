Kerala State Water Transport Department (SWTD) is a governmental department that regulates the inland navigation systems in the Indian state of Kerala and provides inland water transport facilities. It stands for catering to the traffic needs of the inhabitants of the waterlogged areas of the Districts of Alappuzha, Kottayam, Kollam, Ernakulam, Kannur and Kasaragod. The department is headed by the State Minister in charge of transportation.

This system consists of 1895 kilometers of waterways, including navigable rivers, backwaters, and man made cross canals. Most of these are in Travancore-Cochin region. Of the 44 rivers in Kerala, 41 of the westward flowing rivers combine with back waters and man made canals to form an integral part of inland navigation system.

Even through it is a commercial department, its functioning is like a service Department, ever since ‘Transportation’ came under "Essential Service" in Kerala. The Department transports about 150 lakhs of passengers per annum using Wooden/Steel and fibreglass passenger boats.

A study conducted in 2011-2012 by CPPR on Inland Water Transport in Kochi shows that around 56 percent of the passengers expressed their dissatisfaction over the quality of ferry service.

History

The Kerala State Water Transport Department formed during 1968 with its headquarters (Directorate) in the District of Alappuzha. The objective of the department was to provide transport facilities and cargo transportation to the people residing in the waterlogged areas at cheaper rates. Construction of roads, bridges and roadways shortened the operation of the department to passenger transport only, providing backwater transport through ferries. The system is free of pollution, accidents, and is affordable. The government has now mooted setting up Kerala State Boat Jetty Corporation with a vision to convert the boat jetties in Kerala to world class standards. This corporation will enhance and develop the boat jetties into commercial assets for the state. Some jetties were identified for development like Marine drive jetty, Kaavalam jetty and Kumaran jetty. Jetty-based shopping centers and cafeterias are sources of huge returns. As per the new vision every jetty will be a centre for excellent performance. Local art forms, sports meets, family meetings, marriages, proposals will be hosted in jetties. Thus people become interlaced with boat jetty inculcating in them a sense of pride, prejudice and personality. The system provides on average 79,000 km of service to 80,000 people through its 13 stations and 81 boats daily.
