Mandarin Training Center  (MTC; ) is a Chinese as a second language institution run by National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU) in Taipei, Taiwan and located at NTNU Daan Campus.

History
MTC was founded in 1956. It was briefly known as the Center for Chinese Language and Culture Studies from 2002 to 2004. There are courses in Chinese calligraphy, Chinese martial arts, and traditional music and theater. Courses are offered in three-month quarterly terms throughout the year. This system enables international students to engage in intensive language study during their summer breaks and within single semesters. The MTC sponsors travel, hosts speech contests, and stages workshops and performances.

In September 2016, NTNU and the Ministry of Education launched the Office of Global Mandarin Education at the university.

Enrollment
Over 1000 students from over 70 countries enroll for studies each year at the Mandarin Training Center. Since 8 April 2013, people unable to attend MTC have had MTC Online as an option. The center's alumni association, the MTCAA, has been in existence since 1998.
