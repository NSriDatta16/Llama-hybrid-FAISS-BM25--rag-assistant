The Warwick New York is a luxury hotel at 65 West 54th Street, on the northeastern corner with Sixth Avenue, in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. Constructed between 1925 and 1927, it is owned by Warwick Hotels and Resorts.

Architecture

The 36-floor Renaissance Revival building was designed by Emery Roth in association with the architectural firm of George B. Post & Sons. The hotel's three-story base is covered with limestone and granite. The brown brick superstructure has two wings projecting to the street from the property line. The wings set back several times, receding into the main slabâ€”itself thinning into a top tower after further setbacks. The overall shape of the structure has a strong vertical thrust.

History
William Randolph Hearst built the Warwick New York in 1926 for $5 million. Long catering to the elite, Hearst built the 36-story residential tower to accommodate his Hollywood friends as well as his mistress, the actress Marion Davies, who had her own specially-designed floor in the building.

The hotel's restaurant, Murals on 54, features the 1937 murals of American illustrator Dean Cornwell. The famed murals were fully restored following a 2004 renovation of the restaurant. The Warwick is also home to Randolph's Bar & Lounge, whose rosebud leitmotif references Hearst's purported nickname for Marion Davies.

The owner of the Warwick New York is Warwick Hotels and Resorts, which was founded in 1980 with the purchase of this hotel by its chairman, Richard Chiu.

Prominent guests
According to the Warwick Hotel website, James Dean, Jane Russell, Elizabeth Taylor, Meyer Lansky, and Elvis Presley were frequent guests. Actor Cary Grant resided at the Warwick and lived in the hotel for 12 years. During The Beatles 1965 and 1966 Tours they stayed at the Warwick. 

In September 2011 and 2012, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and his delegation stayed at the Warwick for the UN General Assembly, which led to protests outside the hotel.
