Biography
Born in Benalla, Victoria, Champion is most recognised for his work as part of the Coodabeen Champions as a songwriter and guitarist. Greg often appears on the program writing songs about both Aussies rules football and cricket.

He is an avid Australian rules football fan, supporting the Adelaide Crows and since the 1980s has penned many tunes on the Australian game. Of these, the most famous is "That's the Thing About Football", which has gone down as a classic Australian rules song, and has been used on Seven Network's Australian Football League coverage.

Greg Champion grew up in Hectorville, a suburb of the South Australian capital, Adelaide.

Beginning in 1983, Champion has appeared on ABC Local Radio as part of the Coodabeens team, singing parodies of popular songs and relating them to Australian rules footballers.

Champion has written hundreds of songs (many serious, many humorous) and is a multi-awarded country/folk singer, who after being discovered in the Catacombs (an Adelaide folk club of the 1970s), went on to form the band Tidewater before launching a successful solo career.

Champion's highest-selling album is the 1995 released Aussie Christmas with Bucko & Champs with Australian country music star Colin Buchanan. In 1998, Aussie Christmas with Bucko & Champs 2 was released featuring 25 Christmas-themed songs.

In 2006, his song "Been There, Done That" peaked at number 4 on the Country Music Chart, having been released that year as part of The Shack Tapes.

In 2009, Greg released his album Strayana.

In 2010, Champion was awarded Victorian Male Vocalist in the Victorian Country Music Awards for his song "this was my town (Marysville)".

In 2012, just prior to heading off to his 22nd Tamworth Country Music Festival, he surprised many with his Emergence CD which had a wide range of musical styles of 11 original songs.

In 2017, Champion headlined the All Star Musical Comedy Showcase at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival.
