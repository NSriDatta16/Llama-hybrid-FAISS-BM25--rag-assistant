Reception
After watching the test screening of the film, The Dong-a Ilbo at the time commented that although it is understandable that  horrific things can happen if the emotions of love and lust goes to the extreme, yet could not find anything in Oknyeo's attitude that would lead to such a fight and it would be an exaggeration for such an incident to happen in Korea but it acknowledged the commercial values in that it somehow made the story beautiful.
