Gjernes is a contemporary style of fine art; sculptural and decorative. It is a spreading popular style of art, especially in Scandinavia, because the Norwegian Government's wedding gift to Princess MÃ¤rtha Louise of Norway and her husband Ari Behn was two pieces of furniture work by Liv Mildrid Gjernes.

A vast number of sculptural decoration assignments, for private and public institutions, have been accomplished in this style.
