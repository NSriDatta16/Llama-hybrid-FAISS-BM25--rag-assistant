Inkberrow is a village in Worcestershire, England, often thought to be the model for Ambridge, the setting of BBC Radio 4's long-running series The Archers. In particular, The Bull, the fictional Ambridge pub, is supposed to be based on The Old Bull in Inkberrow.

The village's parish church is dedicated to St. Peter and contains the Savage family chapel.

In 2006, Inkberrow was awarded the title of Worcestershire Village of the Year and  won the Building Community Life section of the competition.

Inkberrow was identified as a potential site for a new town in the 1960s, but this plan was not carried out. More houses were added to the village in 2013 because of a rising need for accommodation. Inkberrow Millennium Green is an 8-acre public open space to the east of the village, opened in 2000, which includes a medieval moat and fishpond, a variety of  wildflowers and fruit trees, and a millennium seat with extensive views.

History

The earliest recorded version of the village is Intanbeorgan, from the 8th and 9th century.

By the 15th century, the spelling may have become Ingtebarwe, since nearby villages also mentioned include Church Lench, Abbots Morton & Arrow 

By the 16th century, it was known as Inkebarrow.

The area was within Feckenham Forest, a royal forest with harsh forest law punishments.

Cookhill Priory stood three miles east, at the edge of the county.
