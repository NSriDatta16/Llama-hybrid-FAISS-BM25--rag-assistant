Early career
Shalala's first TV show was Walang Tulugan with the Master Showman in 2001 on GMA-7 with the late Master Showman and fellow comedian German "Kuya Germs" Moreno until 2010. Shalala then transferred to TV5 for his new projects and TV shows, but returned to Walang Tulugan around 2014.

Shalala went on hiatus for sometime until late of 2022 where he guested in the comedy podcast "The Koolpals" which he remained as the sixth silent member of the group.
