Suhma Kingdom was an ancient state during the Late Vedic period on the eastern part of the Indian Subcontinent, which originated in the region of Bengal. The kingdom included present day districts of Midnapore and parts of Hoogly and Howrah. This kingdom was mentioned in the epic Mahabharata along with its neighbouring kingdom Prasuhma.
