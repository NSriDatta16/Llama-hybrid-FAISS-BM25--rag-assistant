Controversies 
Gujarati Sahitya Parishad was fined by Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation in February 2022 for cutting trees illegally. Parishad did not pay attention for many months after getting notices from the corporation. Parishad also deleted this episode of illegally cutting trees from its annual report, which is again a breach by a public institution. Parishad received a lot of negative publicity in newspapers for this illegal and unethical conduct.
