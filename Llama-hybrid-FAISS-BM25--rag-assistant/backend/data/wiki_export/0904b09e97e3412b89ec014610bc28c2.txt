Regents School of Austin is a private, classical, non-denominational Christian school located in Austin, Texas.

Curriculum
The Regents curriculum is loosely based on a classical education model called the Trivium. The Trivium is composed of three stages: grammar, logic, and rhetoric. Grammar school comprises kindergarten through 6th grade, logic is grades 7 and 8 and rhetoric is grades 9 to 12.

In the grammar stage (K - 6) students are taught the building blocks for future subjects, including phonics, Latin, grammar, and math facts. In the logic stage (grades 7 â€“ 8), students learn formal logic. In the final stage, rhetoric (grades 9 - 12), students learn classical rhetoric.

The school names represent their developmental approach to education.
