Steve Ressel (born October 12, 1967) is an American comic book artist, animator, storyboard artist, producer and director. Steve directed animated series such as Invader Zim, The Wild Thornberrys, Duckman, Stressed Eric, God, the Devil and Bob, Rugrats and others. Ressel directed and produced the entire run of Invader Zim.

After Invader Zim he went on to develop his own ideas. "Trubble Bub", a CGI children's program focusing on problem solving and behavior, was animated as a pilot. It was scripted and designed for a direct-to-DVD project but never got off the ground.

Writing and comics
He resides in Clifford, North Dakota, writing screenplays, novels, non-fictions, and his comic book, "The Lost Boys".

Steve is currently writing trance, pop, rock, ballads, and country music.

Grooming allegations
In 2020 video essayist and podcaster Shannon Strucci came out on Twitter with allegations of having been groomed by Ressel when she was a teenager, sharing on a thread several screenshots of inappropriate messages and art pieces he send her during that time.
