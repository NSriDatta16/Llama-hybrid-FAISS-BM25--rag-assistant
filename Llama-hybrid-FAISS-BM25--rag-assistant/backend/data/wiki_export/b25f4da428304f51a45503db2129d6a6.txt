On 28 to 30 April 1945, Achterveld was the scene of high-ranking talks now known as 'The Achterveld Conference' between the Allied command (among others, General Foulkes of Canada, and General Bedell Smith of the United States), Sir Francis de Guingand of the United Kingdom, Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, Ivan Susloparov of the Soviet Union and the occupying German government of the Netherlands, headed by 'Reichskomissar' Arthur Seyss-Inquart, and his aides. They discussed urgent food-help for the starving cities in the west of Holland, which  Seyss-Inquart allowed, and which started the day after, 29 April, by plane from England, code-named Operation Manna.

The Allies tried to start negotiations about an unconditional German surrender. Seyss-Inquart did not want to comply there and then, although a general cease-fire was convened. The Germans ceased their resistance only on 5 May following, in Wageningen.
