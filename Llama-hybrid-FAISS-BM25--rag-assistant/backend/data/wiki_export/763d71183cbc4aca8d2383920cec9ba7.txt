History

Widnes Football Club had a number of grounds before settling at Lowerhouse Lane in 1884/85 on a site a few hundred yards north of the current location. That land was leased on behalf of the rugby organisation by Widnes Cricket Club but, to coincide with the breakaway from the Rugby Football Union in 1895, Widnes F.C. obtained a lease for land on which they laid out a new ground (the Naughton Park/Halton Stadium site). The first game on the new field was against Liversedge on 12 October 1895.

In the late 1920s it was proposed that the land would be compulsorily purchased to make way for a new council housing scheme. After much lobbying the club were finally given an option to purchase the site for the not inconsiderable sum of £3,250.

Club secretary Tom Naughton was instrumental in raising the necessary funds but before the formal completion of the purchase in 1932 he died in a car crash, leading to the ground being renamed in his honour.

During the 1978 Kangaroo tour Widnes defeated Australia at Naughton Park before a crowd of 12,202.

Naughton Park stadium was owned by Widnes F.C. (later Widnes RLFC Ltd) but when financial difficulties set in they sold the ground to Halton Borough Council in 1995.

Halton Borough Council in partnership with Widnes Vikings agreed to build a new stadium on the site of Naughton Park. This stadium would provide a multi-purpose complex including a social club, conference facilities, recreational facilities and catering/function facilities.

The stadium was officially reopened on 2 November 1997 and consisted of South Stand with 3,400 capacity two function suites, social club and 30 executive boxes overlooking the pitch and the North Stand which had capacity for 4,400 fans.

On 11 November 1997 Everton Reserves played their first match in their new home as more than 5,000 fans attended leading to the kick-off being delayed by half an hour to allow the large crowd in. Although they were not treated to the best of games Leeds eventually found the breakthrough with 10 minutes to go when Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink cut inside two defenders and curled his right foot shot past the dive of John O'Toole.

On 29 January 1999 the Widnes RLFC's remaining 40% share in the ground was sold to the council when they ran into financial difficulties.

In 1999 the Halton Stadium became The AutoQuest Stadium when the local car dealership signed sponsorship naming rights.

On 8 October 1999 the new West stand was officially opened by Tessa Sanderson CBE with the benefit of a Sport England Lottery grant the facilities included gym, crèche, café and a national table tennis Centre of excellence along with an extra 3,200 spectator seating.

In 2000, Runcorn F.C. sold their Canal Street ground and moved to the Halton Stadium. The club renamed itself Runcorn F.C. Halton to reflect its new location.

AutoQuest's sponsorship ended in 2001 and the stadium became known as the Halton Stadium.

On 27 November 2002 Runcorn hosted 3rd division Bristol Rovers in an FA Cup 1st round replay in front of 2,444 fans despite taking their league opponents to extra time they were knocked out 3–1.

The 2002/03 season was to be Everton Reserves final season at the Halton Stadium as they moved to Haig Avenue in Southport.

In 2004 the Stadium was selected to host a Challenge cup semi final as 11,175 fans watched as Wigan Warriors were victorious 30–18 against the Warrington Wolves.

In 2005 the East Stand was completed making the Halton Stadium a complete four-stand all seater stadium. Runcorn F.C.'s precarious financial state caused them to move out of the Halton Stadium and into Valerie Park.

In December 2007 a sponsorship agreement was made with Stobart Group Limited and the stadium was renamed Stobart Stadium Halton. In February 2008 the North stand seats were changed to spell out Vikings, West stand seats are sponsored by Stobart and East stand seats are sponsored by Halton Borough Council as part of the stadium sponsorship deal.

The Widnes Rugby League Museum was opened in 2007.

In 2008 the Stadium hosted Wigan Warriors home playoff fixture verses Bradford Bulls after they were refused usage of their home ground by the stadiums owner Dave Whelan 

In 2009 the Stadium hosted a rematch of the 2004 Challenge Cup Semi final and this time 12,975 fans watched as Warrington Wolves secured revenge in a 39–26 victory over Wigan Warriors.

In 2010 12,265 fans attended the Challenge Cup Semi final as Warrington Wolves cruised to victory 54-12 versus Catalans Dragons.

The stadium was a temporary home to St. Helens during the 2011 season, as Langtree Park only opened for use in time for the 2012 season.

At the end of the 2011 season the stadium became the first in England to install a fully artificial 3g pitch 

In 2013 The Stadium failed to be selected as a Rugby League World Cup venue due to the 3g pitch not being sanctioned for international competition. The USA team based themselves at the Stadium during their run to the quarter finals in the competition.

In 2013 local businessman Peter Littler signed a naming rights sponsorship deal as the Stadium became the Select Security Stadium 

Since 2013 the Stadium has been the host venue for the British Drum Corps Championships which are held each September. The Championships feature the top UK Marching Bands and is organised by Drum Corps United Kingdom - www.dcuk.org.uk

On Sunday 18 June 2017 a sellout 14,000 crowd were entertained by rock and roll superstar Elton John at the Stadium with his "Wonderful crazy night tour".

In October 2018 the 3g pitch was relaid after seven years of matches, community use and events. The new 3g pitch was installed with green rubber crumb and the perimeter touchlines permanently incorporated into the surface to improve the appearance of the pitch for spectators and the TV audience.
 
In November 2019 DCBL secured the naming rights to the DCBL Stadium Halton.

On Saturday 2 July 2022 7,000 crowd were entertained by rock and roll superstar Bryan Adams and Widnes born Spice girl Mel C at the Stadium with his "So happy it hurts" tour.
