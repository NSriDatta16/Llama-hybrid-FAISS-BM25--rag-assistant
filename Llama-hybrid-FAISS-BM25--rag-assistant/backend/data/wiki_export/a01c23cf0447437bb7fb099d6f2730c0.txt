Character analysis 
The name "Jakub Wędrowycz" is a wordplay based on a literal translation of Johnnie Walker into Polish.  He is seen in Poland as a combination of popular negative stereotypes and vices of Poles, which nonetheless evokes sympathy. He is an anti-hero.  He is also a rebel, mistrustful and often openly defying government and authority figures.

Reception and significance
Wędrowycz has been described as the most original and easily recognizable characters of Pilipiuk's speculative fiction and humorous prose, as well as one of the icons of modern Polish pop culture.  Outside Poland, books featuring Wędrowycz have also been translated into Czech, and have been described as very popular in the Czech Republic.  Some Wędrowycz books have also been translated into Russian.

Polish writer Jacek Dukaj has written that Wędrowycz is "one of the most colorful, original and memorable characters in Polish science fiction and fantasy", comparable to Andrzej Sapkowski's Geralt of Rivia, the main character of The Witcher series.

Wędrowycz has spawned a collectible card game and a fandom convention, Dni Jakuba Wędrowycza (Days of Jakub Wędrowycz).  The card game was released in 2011. The convention has been held in Wojsławice, a village featured in many stories related to Wędrowycz, since 2006.  In 2013, during the eighth annual convention, a  tall wooden monument of Jakub Wędrowycz was unveiled. In 2019, plans for raising a similar statue of another character from the series, Jakub's friend Semen Korczaszko, were announced. In 2016, a regional branch of PTTK, a Polish tourist organization, created a badge for those who visit local tourist attractions related to the Wędrowycz stories.
