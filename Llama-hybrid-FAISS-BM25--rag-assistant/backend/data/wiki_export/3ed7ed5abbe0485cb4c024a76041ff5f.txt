Son of the district court president, he grew up on an estate within a large park, the Bürgli, in Zurich. When he was sixteen years old, he apprenticed as a gardener in Zurich. From 1905 to 1911, he studied at the Magdeburg School of Arts and Crafts. After completing his apprenticeship, he began working for the company of Otto Froebel and Heirs as a landscape architect, remaining until 1933. There he coincided with the landscape architect Ernst Cramer, who years later was responsible for training a young Richard Neutra. In those years, he was also associated with the Swiss Werkbund.

In 1934 he set up his studio in Zurich. From then on, he worked with some of the most important Swiss architects of the time, such as Max Frisch, Max Ernst Haefeli and Werner Max Moser, members of the CIAM.
