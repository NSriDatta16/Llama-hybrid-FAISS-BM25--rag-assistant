Synopsis
The character of Andy LeBeau was a spin-off character from Coleman's television film The Kid with the Broken Halo (1982). In each episode, Andy was dispatched to help a child in need and resolve his problem by his supervisor and fellow angel, Angelica. The antagonist in each episode was Hornswoggle, a demon that only Andy could see, who tried to make Andy's mission more difficult, usually by getting him to make the wrong choice or by otherwise complicating the mission. It was up to Andy to correct whatever mistakes he made and foil Hornswoggle's plans.

Later years
The Gary Coleman Show went into syndication when it aired on Cartoon Network in the 1990s and briefly on Boomerang in 2000.

As of 2023, no DVD release of this show is announced by Warner Bros. Discovery.
