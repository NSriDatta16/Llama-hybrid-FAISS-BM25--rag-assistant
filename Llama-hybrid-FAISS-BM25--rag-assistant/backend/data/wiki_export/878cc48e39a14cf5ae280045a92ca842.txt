Greta is a small town in the Hunter Region of New South Wales, Australia.

History
The traditional owners and custodians of the Maitland area are the Wonnarua people. The Greta area was first colonized by Europeans around Anvil Creek in the 1830s.

When the town was surveyed in 1842 it was given the name Greta, possibly after a small river in Cumberland, England. Coal mining was established in the area in 1862 with the development of a railway station.

In 1864, kerosene shale was discovered. By the 1870s, Greta had four hotels, four churches, a school and schools of arts. Geologist Edgeworth David discovered the Greta Coal Seam in 1886. By 1907, ten collieries were in operation.

At the 2016 census, the town had a population of 2,830. Greta's population increased to 3,349 at the 2021 census.

In June 2023, a roundabout on Wine Country Drive in Greta was the site of a bus crash that killed 10 people.
