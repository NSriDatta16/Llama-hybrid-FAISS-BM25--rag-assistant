New York's 19th congressional district is located in New York's Catskills, Hudson Valley, Southern Tier, and Finger Lakes regions. It lies partially in the northernmost region of the New York metropolitan area and south of Albany. This district is currently represented by Republican Marc Molinaro. It was one of 18 districts that would have voted for Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election had they existed in their current configuration while being won or held by a Republican in 2022.

Various New York districts have been numbered "19" over the years, including areas in New York City and various parts of upstate New York. The 19th District was a Manhattan-based district until 1980. It then was the Bronx-Westchester seat now numbered the 17th District. The present 19th District was the 21st District before the 1990s, and before that was the 25th District. 

The 2020 redistricting saw the district expand to include the entirety of Broome, Tioga, Chenango, Delaware, Greene, Sullivan, and Columbia Counties, while partially including Ulster and Otsego Counties.
