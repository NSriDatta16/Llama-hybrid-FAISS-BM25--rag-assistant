The Papua New Guinean honours system is the main system of honouring citizens of Papua New Guinea for their services to the country; it consists of three Orders and several medals.  After independence, Papua New Guinea used the Imperial honours system, however, in recognition of the nation's 30th anniversary, a new awards system was adopted.  The official announcement of its creation was made by Prime Minister Sir Michael Somare on 12 November 2004 and the first investitures were performed by the Princess Royal in early October 2005.  The Imperial honours system is still in use as well, however, and the King issues a Papua New Guinean List as part of every Birthday and New Year Honours List.

Order of Valour

This Order consists of one level, the Cross of Valour (CV) awarded for only the most selfless acts of bravery in times of extreme personal danger. This bears resemblance to its counterparts in the Canadian and Australian honours systems. Prior to this award, citizens of Papua New Guinea would have received the George Cross for their actions.

Since Papua New Guinea still recognises the British honours system it is possible that citizens will still receive the GC, however this is considered unlikely as the Cross of Valour performs the same function. For acts of valour in the face of the enemy during wartime, citizens of PNG are still entitled to the Victoria Cross.

In ranking order, the Cross of Valour precedes Grand Companion of the Logohu.

Order of Logohu 

The Order of Logohu is the principal order of the Order of Papua New Guinea. Logohu is a Motuan word for the bird-of-paradise, the official national symbol of Papua New Guinea since its independence.  The Order consists of three classes and a medal.

Grand Companion of the Order of Logohu 

The highest class, Grand Companion of the Order of Logohu may be awarded to citizens of Papua New Guinea and others for service, achievement, and merit in the highest degree, sustained over a period of twenty years. The class may be awarded to no more than 50 living citizens. Recipients are titled as Chief except for the Chancellor of the Order who is titled Grand Chief. One additional living Papua New Guinean may also be titled Grand Chief.
