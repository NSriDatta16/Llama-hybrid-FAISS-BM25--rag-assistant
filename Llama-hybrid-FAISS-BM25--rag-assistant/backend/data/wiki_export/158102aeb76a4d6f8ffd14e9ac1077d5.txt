Raja Sálbán (also known as Salivahan) is a mythical monarch, believed to have founded the city and the fort of Sialkot.

According to Punjabi folklore, his wife, Queen Icchira gave birth to Puran Bhagat. Upon the suggestion of local astrologers, Puran was sent away from the King for the first 12 years of his life, as it was said that King could not see the face of his son. While Puran was away, the king married a young girl named Luna,  who came from a low caste family. After 12 years of isolation, Puran returned to the royal palace. There, Luna became romantically attracted toward Puran, who was of the same age. Being the step-son of Luna, Puran disapproved of her advances. A hurt Luna accused Puran of violating her honor. 

The infuriated monarch ordered Puran to be amputated and killed. The soldiers carried out his orders and cutoff the Puran's hands and legs and threw him in a well in the forest named the Puran's Well.  

Guru Gorakhnath, passing by with his followers and heard voice from the well. He took him out using a single thread and unbaked earthen pot. He was later adopted by Baba Gorkhnath, and himself became a yogi.

Eventually, he confronted his father, and it was due to the ascetic's blessings that the king had another son who eventually became Raja Rasalu, another folk legend that became popular along the Mirasi community.
