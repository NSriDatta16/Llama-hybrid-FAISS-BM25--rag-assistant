The men's team single-shot 100 meter running deer competition was one of 15 shooting sports events on the Shooting at the 1908 Summer Olympics programme.  Teams consisted of four shooters. A deer-shaped target made 10 runs of , with the shooter firing one shot during each run. The runs lasted about 4 seconds each and took place  distant from the shooter. There were three concentric circles on the target, with the smallest counting for 4 points, the middle for 3, and the outermost for 2. A hit outside the circles but still on the target (except on the haunch) counted for 1 point. The maximum possible score was thus 40 points per shooter, or 160 for the team.

Only 2 teams competed.
