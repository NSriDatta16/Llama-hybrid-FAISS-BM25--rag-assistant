Career
Davy remained in Manchester until 1994, playing at venues such as Band on the Wall and PJ Bells, where he was booked for residencies. He also led open jam sessions for musicians and vocalists of varying skills to participate. These sessions ran for nine years.

In 1994, after being recommended by the late Colin Goddard, former studio owner of Moonrakers Studio, Manchester, Davy relocated to London, where he took up the post of trumpet chair and actor/musician at the Donmar Warehouse on their production of the Brecht/Weil, work;The Threepenny Opera directed by Phyllida Lloyd, and under the musical direction of Gary Yershon, and Kate Edgar. Collaborations with writer SuAndi followed, leading to Davy's participation in community-driven projects and a long-standing international tour with the show Afrika Afrika (Oct 2008 – March 2009), conceived by André Heller and choreographed by Georges Mamboye. Produced by Matthias Hoffman.

Davy has continued to develop his own writing and producing, via his group the Kevin Davy Quartet (KDQ). This unison resulted in the album The Thoth Project, which has been performed at several venues in the UK, including in the Attic at the Hackney Picturehouse.
