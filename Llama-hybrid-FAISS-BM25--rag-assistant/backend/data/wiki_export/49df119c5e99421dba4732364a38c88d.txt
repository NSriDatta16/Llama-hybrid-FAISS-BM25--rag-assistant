Industry is an album by Richard Thompson and Danny Thompson released in 1997.

The two unrelated Thompsons had known each other since the late sixties, and had toured together throughout the nineties. This long-planned collaborative work was finally recorded in 1997.

The compositions on the album - both Richard Thompson's songs and Danny Thompson's instrumental pieces - portray various impressions of the impact of industry on England, ranging from the birth of the industrial revolution to the closing of the Grimethorpe Colliery and the effects of unemployment.
