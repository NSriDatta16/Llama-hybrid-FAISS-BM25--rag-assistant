Washington's 6th congressional district encompasses the Olympic Peninsula, the Kitsap Peninsula, and most of the city of Tacoma. Its counties include the entirety of Clallam, Kitsap, Mason, Jefferson, and Grays Harbor counties, and part of Pierce County. The 6th district has been represented in the U.S. House of Representatives by Derek Kilmer, a Democrat from Gig Harbor, since January 2013. He succeeded 36-year incumbent and fellow Democrat Norm Dicks, at the time the dean of the Washington delegation.

Established after the 1930 U.S. census, the 6th district is a working class district, with many of its jobs provided by tourism and a declining timber industry on the Pacific and Juan de Fuca coasts, and by the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton.

Presidentially, the 6th leans Democratic. It was one of only two districts retained by the Democrats in the Republican realignment election of 1994.

Al Gore and John Kerry carried the district in 2000 and 2004, with 52% and 53% of the vote, respectively. Barack Obama swept the district in 2008 and 2012, with 57% and 56% of the vote. Hillary Clinton won the district with 51% in 2016, with a diminished, but still large, margin. Joe Biden received 57% in the district in 2020.
