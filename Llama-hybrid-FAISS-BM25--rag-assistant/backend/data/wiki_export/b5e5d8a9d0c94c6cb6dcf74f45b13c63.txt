Johnnie Otis Jackson (born January 30, 1971, in Hammonton, New Jersey) is an American IFBB professional bodybuilder and powerlifter. Jackson has been said to have one of the best developed upper bodies in professional bodybuilding in the world. He is known for training in Arlington, Texas, with fellow American IFBB pro competitor Branch Warren. Due to his strength, he has sometimes been referred to (especially in 2009) as the world's strongest bodybuilder.

Biography
Jackson first competed in an NPC (National Physique Committee) in 2001, where he won the NPC USA. His first IFBB competition was the GNC Show of Strength (now defunct) of 2002, where he placed 10th. His first IFBB Night of Champions was in 2003, where he placed 5th. Later that same year he competed in the Ironman Pro Invitational, where he placed 9th.

In 2003, he competed in his first Mr. Olympia, where he placed 11th. His first Arnold Classic was in 2006, where he placed 13th. Jackson regularly competes in powerlifting events and often incorporates this type of training into his workouts. Jackson lives in Fort Worth, Texas, and trains at Metroflex Gym in Arlington, Texas, with training partner Branch Warren. Both have trained with Janae Kroc. Jackson is one of the few professional bodybuilders who has consistently competed in the "Mr. Olympia" competition for over 13 years, only sitting out in 2009 when he competed in the "Mr. Olympia 2009 World's Strongest Professional Bodybuilder".

Johnnie Jackson competed in the 2008 United States Powerlifting Federation (USPF) National Powerlifting Championships in Warwick, Rhode Island on June 29, 2009. He opened the bench press competition with an easy first attempt of 465 lbs (232 kg) unaided by a bench shirt. His next two lifts were disqualified although he was able to handle the heavy weight, including a close miss at 600 lb with bench press shirt. Jackson set a USPF World Record on his first attempt at deadlift with a pull of 345 kg (760 lbs) in a deadlift suit, which was followed by two close misses of 372.5 kg (821 lbs), whereby he pulled his left hamstring during the third and last attempt.

In 2009, Jackson earned the title "Mr. Olympia 2009 World's Strongest Professional Bodybuilder" by benching 523 lbs (237 kg) in an old polyester blast bench shirt and deadlifting 815 lbs (370 kg) in a champions deadlift suit for a 1,338 lb push/pull total defeating Ben White, who bench pressed 573 lbs and deadlifted 633 lbs for a 1,206 lb total in the same equipment. This record was surpassed a year later by Stan Efferding in the Mr. Olympia 2010 World's Strongest Professional Bodybuilder contest with a 1,428 lb total (628 lb + 800 lb).

Jackson competed in the Raw Unity Deadlift Competition on January 22, 2012. He deadlifted 771 lbs raw on his first attempt, missed his second at 832 lbs, but easily pulled the 832 lbs raw on the third attempt for his all-time personal best at age 40 as a master class lifter.
