Marine labour issues on COVID-19 

The strategy of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) had been coordinated to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the aim of the ILO Memorandum.

Seafarers and shipowners were supported by both the International Chamber of Shipping and the International Transport Workers' Federation.
The International Maritime Chamber has assisted in issuing a 'Coronavirus (COVID-19) Guidance for Ship Operators for the Protection of the Health of Seafarers' while the International Transport Workers' Federation has issued the 'COVID-19 advice to ships and seafarers.'

According to the 2006 MLC, derogations, exemptions or other clauses are possible. Governments are provided with a flexible interpretation of the convention. Decisions are taken in consultation with shipowners' and seafarers' organizations, taking into account all the factors proposed by the government concerned to the office.

Some external circumstances can make it difficult to implement the obligations laid down in Labour Inspection (Seafarers) Convention, 1996.
