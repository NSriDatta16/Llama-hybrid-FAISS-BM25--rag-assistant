The Love Machine is an album released by singer/comedian/actress Sandra Bernhard. The album is a live recording of her one-woman show of the same title; it combines comedic monologues and musical performances. It was primarily sold at her live shows until it was made available on her official website.

In the performance Bernhard does what she is best known for: she rips apart celebrity culture while commenting on events of the time. Among the topics she addresses: the program Queer as Folk, Rosie O'Donnell, religion and high fashion. Comedian Roseanne Barr makes a guest appearance.

The recording is notoriously unpopular with fans due to the low production quality; it is muffled and low quality.
