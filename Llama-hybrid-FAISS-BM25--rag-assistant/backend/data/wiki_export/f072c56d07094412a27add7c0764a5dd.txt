Qualifying matches took place from 28 March to 7 April 1977 at Hounslow Civic Centre and at Fisher's Snooker Centre, Acton, to produce eight qualifiers to meet the eight top seeded players from the 1976/1977 snooker world rankings in the main tournament.

There were six century breaks at the championship, the highest of which, 135, was scored by Spencer in the sixth frame of his semi-final match against John Pulman. Spencer was the first player to win the championship using a two-piece . As champion, he received £6,000 from the total prize fund of £17,000. The World Championship was the only ranking event of the 1976–77 snooker season.

Overview
Snooker, a cue sport, was founded in the late 19th century by British Army soldiers stationed in India. Joe Davis won the first World Snooker Championship, organised by the Billiards Association and Control Council, in 1927. In the "modern" era of the sport, which started in 1969 when the World Championship reverted to a knockout format, snooker has become increasingly popular worldwide, especially in East and Southeast Asian nations such as China, Hong Kong and Thailand. Since 1977, the championship has been held at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England.

The 1977 championship featured sixteen professional players competing in one-on-one snooker matches in a single-elimination format, each match played over several . Ray Reardon was the defending champion, having defeated Alex Higgins 27–16 in the final of the 1976 World Snooker Championship The top eight players in the 1976/1977 snooker world rankings were exempted to the main tournament, where they each faced a player from a qualifying competition. The championship was organised by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA), the governing body for professional snooker, and promoted by Mike Watterson, with sponsorship by cigarette company Embassy. Watterson chose the Crucible after Carol Watterson, his wife, saw a play there and recommended the venue. Watterson booked the venue, at a cost of £6,600, and made personal financial guarantees for the championship, before Embassy's sponsorship had been secured. With audience members purchasing tickets at prices ranging from 75p to £3.50, the event made a surplus of £12,000. Highlights of the semi-finals and final were broadcast on BBC2.

Tournament summary

Qualifying
The WPBSA first published official world rankings for players on the main tour for the 1976–77 season. Players' performances in the previous three World Snooker Championships (1974, 1975, and 1976) contributed to their points total. These were used for seedings for the tournament. Reardon was seeded first, as defending champion, and was also number one on the ranking list. Originally, the top 14 players were due to be seeded into the last-16 round, but the WPBSA members voted 11–10 to change this so that only the top eight players were exempted to the last-16. The draw for the tournament was conducted by journalist Janice Hale at the Albany Hotel, Birmingham. The 1977 World Championship was the only ranking event of the 1976–77 season.

Final
The final took place from 28 to 30 April as the best of 49 frames, refereed by John Smyth. Spencer won his third world title by defeating Thorburn 25–21. The first session ended with Spencer 4–2 ahead after he had won the initial three frames, and he extended his lead to 5–2, before Thorburn took four of the next five frames to leave the score at 6–6 at the day's conclusion. The third session ended with them again tied, at 9–9. Spencer made a break of 105 in the eighteenth frame.

Thorburn gained a 13–11 advantage during the fourth session, and extended this to 15–11, but Spencer won the next four frames to make it 15–15.

Thorburn won the following two frames, before Spencer took the 42nd frame with a break of 67, to lead 22–20. Thorburn narrowed his deficit to one frame at 21–22, but saw Spencer win the next three frames to claim victory.

Spencer was the first player to win the title with a two-piece cue. His previous cue was smashed in a car accident just before the 1974 Norwich Union Open, and despite repairs, Spencer was not confident about using it, and purchased the new two-piece implement whilst on tour in Canada. Having made several century breaks with the new cue following his return to England, Spencer decided to use it for the championship only two months before the tournament. A few months after his victory he replaced it with a different one that had been manufactured in Japan. Snooker historian Clive Everton wrote that Spencer "exploded two myths" by winning with a two-piece cue, a type of implement that was generally seen as suitable for pool but not snooker, and having only used it for two months, when most professional players thought it took many months to become proficient with a new cue. Thorburn also used a two-piece cue for the match, as was common in his native Canada.

An article in Snooker Scene contrasted Spencer's playing his earlier World Championship victories, which featured "aggressive" long , to the way he played in 1977, which included fewer long pots and consistent mid-distance potting, and praised his "coolness and steadiness of nerve" and his choice of which shots to play. The same magazine described Thorburn's strengths at the tournament as "concentration and consistency".
