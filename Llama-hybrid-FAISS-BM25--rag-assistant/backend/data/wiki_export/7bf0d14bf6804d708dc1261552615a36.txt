Miniestadi (, meaning in English "Mini Stadium"), officially named "Miniestadi", was a football stadium in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. The 15,276-seat stadium was situated across from Camp Nou, the home stadium of FC Barcelona. The stadium was home to FC Barcelona B, FCB's reserve team, as well as their women's team and Juvenil A. The stadium is now replaced by the newly built Estadi Johan Cruyff, which was completed on 27 August 2019.

The stadium was home to FC Barcelona B, the reserve side of the famous Catalan club, until they moved to Estadi Johan Cruyff in the Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper sports complex for the 2019-20 season.

The stadium was also home to FC Barcelona C until July 2007, when they disbanded. It was also home to the Barcelona Dragons, an NFL Europe American football team, until they were disbanded in 2003.

It occasionally hosted the national team of Andorra as well.
