Tungsten(IV) oxide is the chemical compound with the formula WO2.  The bronze-colored solid crystallizes in a monoclinic cell.  The rutile-like structure features distorted octahedral WO6 centers with alternate short W–W bonds (248 pm). Each tungsten center has the d2 configuration, which gives the material a high electrical conductivity.

WO2 is prepared by reduction of WO3 with tungsten powder over the course of 40 hours at 900 °C. An intermediate in this reaction is the partially reduced, mixed valence species W18O49.
2 WO3  +  W  →  3 WO2

The molybdenum analogue MoO2 is prepared similarly.  Single crystals are obtained by chemical transport technique using iodine. Iodine transports the WO2 in the form of the volatile species WO2I2.
