Mistrial is the fourteenth solo studio album by American rock musician Lou Reed, released in April 1986 by RCA Records two years after his previous studio album, New Sensations (1984). Fernando Saunders and Reed produced the album.

Mistrial peaked at No. 47 on the U.S. Billboard 200 and at No. 69 on the UK Albums Chart. Two singles were released from the album: "The Original Wrapper" and "No Money Down" with the latter being the only single to chart, peaking at No. 75 on the ARIA Charts. A music video directed by rock duo Godley & Creme, was created for "No Money Down" that featured an animatronic Lou Reed, and a music video was also created for "The Original Wrapper" which features time-lapse photography of New Yorkers on the street.

Panamanian singer Rubén Blades provided backing vocals on two tracks, "I Remember You" and "Tell It to Your Heart", while punk rock musician Jim Carroll sang backing vocals on one, "Video Violence".
