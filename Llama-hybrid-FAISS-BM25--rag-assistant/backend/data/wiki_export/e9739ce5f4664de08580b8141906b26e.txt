A Live One is a live album by American singer-songwriter Loudon Wainwright III. The live performances included on the album were recorded on a tour of the British Isles in 1976 and at McCabe's in Los Angeles in 1978. It was released in 1979 on Rounder Records.

His first completely live album, it was released during the longest hiatus between studio albums so far in his career (five years): his farewell to the 1970s (1978's Final Exam) and his self-reinvention on 1983's Fame and Wealth. Furthermore, since the track list relies on early LPs such as Attempted Mustache, the gap between his adjacent studio albums seems all the wider.
