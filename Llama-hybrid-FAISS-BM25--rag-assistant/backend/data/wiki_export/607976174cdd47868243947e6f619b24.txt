For the season 1975/1976 Graf was music director of the Iraqi National Symphony Orchestra in Baghdad. After winning the Karl Böhm conductor's competition in 1979, he made his debut at the Vienna State Opera in 1981 with Stravinsky's Petrouchka. He then worked at major opera houses including Munich, Paris, Florence, Venice and Rome. Since 1995, he has conducted most major American orchestras, including the Boston Symphony, Cleveland Orchestra, New York Philharmonic and Philadelphia Orchestra.

Graf was music director of the Mozarteum Orchestra of Salzburg from 1984 to 1994, where he recorded the complete symphonies and other works by Mozart.

At the conclusion of his Houston tenure in 2013, Graf took the title of Conductor Laureate. He has been an artist-in-residence at the Shepherd School of Music, Rice University.
