The Celtic Tenors is an Irish trio of tenor singers. The group initially consisted of Paul Hennessey, Niall Morris and James Nelson, and gave its first performance in October 1995 on the Theatre Nights programme on RTÉ. Hennessey was replaced by Matthew “The Gill” Gilsenan in 1998. In 2000, after a successful audition, the group signed a contract with EMI, which chose the name 'The Celtic Tenors' for it.
