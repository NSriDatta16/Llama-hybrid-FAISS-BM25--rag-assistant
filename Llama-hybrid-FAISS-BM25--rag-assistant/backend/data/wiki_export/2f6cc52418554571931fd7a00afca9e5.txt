Gabal Edmonstone is a flat-topped mesa located near the Dakhla Oasis south of Cairo, Egypt. It is a remnant of an eroding scarp that extends for over  east-southeast to west-northwest. The flat caprock of both the scarp and Mount Edmonstone is chalky limestone underlain by fossil-bearing shale and fine-grained sedimentary rocks.
