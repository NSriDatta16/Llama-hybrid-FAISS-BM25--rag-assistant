Career
Soria was performing his poetry since the mid to late 1980s. He participated in the San Diego peace movement with the help of such groups as The Committee Opposed to Militarism and the Draft (COMD), and its Youth Activism Task Force (YATF). He penned work for journals such as The Non-Violent Activist and a number of local zines. Miguel-Angel read poetry at punk shows and at peace rallies.

He was very active in the Straight-Edge punk movement and helped organize a number of Unity Benefit concerts where acts from a different musical genres would come together.

While a student at the University of San Diego, he created an alternative poetry venue in the early 1990s to highlight the work of Xicana and Xicano artist, it was called "Noche de Atole". He always echoed the Xicana and Xicano activist of the first part of the Xicana/o movement in his belief that Xicana and Xicano poetry needed to pay tribute to its lineage. Thus, the use of the name atole. He invited many local theater, danza, music and poetry groups to the event. One highlight was the debut of a young poet then known to the world only for his journalism, Adolfo Guzman-Lopez.  In addition to starting "Noche De Atole" he also proposed and founded "United Front" the University of San Diego's Multicultural student center.

He also acted as Executive Producer of Chorizo TongueFire, the TSP's first CD.  Soria was a founding member of Voz Alta, a San Diego Chicana and Chicano art space.
