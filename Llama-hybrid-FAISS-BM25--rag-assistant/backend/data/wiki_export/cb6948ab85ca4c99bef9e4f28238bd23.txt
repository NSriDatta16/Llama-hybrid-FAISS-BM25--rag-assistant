Malmö Arena is a multi-purpose indoor arena in Malmö, Sweden, and the venue for home games of SHL ice hockey club Malmö Redhawks. It is the largest arena in the SHL, and the second-largest indoor arena in Sweden. Apart from hosting Redhawks hockey matches, the arena is often the venue for team handball, floorball, concerts, and other events. It has also hosted indoor athletics. Owned and operated by Parkfast AB, the arena was designed by Mats Matson of MM Matsson Konsult AB, Hannu Helkiö of Pöyry Architects, and Gert Wingårdh of Wingårdh arkitektkontor. Naming rights for the venue are owned by Malmö Stad, in a ten-year contract, agreed in 2007. The venue hosted the 2014 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships from 26 December 2013 to 5 January 2014. It hosted the Eurovision Song Contest between 14 and 18 May 2013, and will host the same event again between 7 and 11 May 2024.

With a capacity of 12,600 for sports and 15,500 for concerts, Malmö Arena is the second-largest indoor arena in Sweden, only trailing the Ericsson Globe, located in Stockholm, and is currently the biggest venue in the Swedish Hockey League. The attendance record for concerts at Malmö Arena is 11,300, set by a Lady Gaga concert on 19 November 2010. The venue attendance record for ice hockey was set on 12 November 2008, when Malmö Redhawks hosted Leksands IF in front of 13,247 people. Ground was broken on 10 January 2007, and the arena was inaugurated on 6 November 2008. The final construction cost for the arena was 750 million SEK. The arena is located about  from Hyllie railway station, from where there are rail and bus connections to Malmö Central Station, Copenhagen Airport, and Copenhagen Central Station.

History

In spite of being the third most populous city in Sweden, Malmö often missed the possibility to host larger concert and music events because it lacked a suitable indoor arena. When the City Tunnel project was initiated by Malmö Stad in the late 1990s, the city began to plan a new district in Hyllievång. This led to the decision to build Hyllie station in 2001, as a part of the tunnel project, to boost the development of the new district. The ice hockey club Malmö Redhawks, which was the proposed main tenant of the new arena, was initially uncertain of the new project and wanted to renovate its present home, the Malmö Isstadion, instead of moving to an entirely new arena. However, the Redhawks were convinced when Percy Nilsson of Parkfast AB contributed seven million kronor to help the club's financial situation.

The decision to build an arena in the area was first presented by Nilsson in May 1997, and developed further over the following decade. The permit to start building Malmö Arena was granted in September 2006, and the first sod was turned on 10 January 2007 by Nilsson, hockey players Pekka Lindmark, Juha Riihijärvi, and Carl Söderberg, and two politicians from Malmö Stad. The main contractors for the building of the arena were Parkfast AB, with the collaboration of the structural engineer Byggteknik i Skåne. The arena was designed by Mats Matson of MM Matsson Konsult AB, Hannu Helkiö of Pöyry Architects, and Gert Wingårdh of Wingårdh arkitektkontor. The final construction cost for the arena was 750 million kronor – 100 million kronor over budget because of additions to the initial plan. The arena was entirely financed by Percy Nilsson of Parkfast AB. Malmö Arena was inaugurated on 6 November 2008 with a large concert featuring a variety of artists, among them Robyn, Helen Sjöholm, Sanne Salomonsen, and Jill Johnson.

The name of the arena was discussed during 2007, with Malmö Arena or Hyllie Arena discussed as potential options. The naming rights were eventually sold to Malmö Stad for 10 years in a deal worth 50 million kronor. Nilsson wished for the arena to have "Malmö" in its name because the city's new association football stadium, Swedbank Stadion, did not.

Sports

Malmö Arena has hosted Malmö Redhawks ice hockey home games since 2008, replacing their former home, Malmö Isstadion. The team plays in the SHL, the first tier of Swedish ice hockey. The Redhawks play 26 games per season at the arena (excluding playoffs) making them the arena's most regular tenant.  Malmö Arena was the main venue for the 2014 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships.

In addition to ice hockey, Malmö Arena hosted 22 matches of the 2011 World Men's Handball Championships, including the bronze medal match, and the final, between France and Denmark, which was won by France. Malmö Arena hosted the playoff finals of the men's and women's Swedish national team handball championship in 2010 and 2012. Malmö Arena was also scheduled to host the 2013 finals, but they were moved elsewhere when the arena was chosen as the host for the 2013 Eurovision Song Contest, which is scheduled to take place five days after the handball finals.  In floorball, the arena served as the final venue for the 2010–11 and 2011–12 Swedish Super League finals. It will be used again for the 2023 World Men's Handball Championship with Sweden co-hosting alongside Poland.

Malmö Arena was used for athletics in February 2009, when the arena hosted "Malmö Indoor Gala", a newly founded indoor athletics competition, organised by Malmö Allmänna Idrottsförening (MAI). Several international athletes were invited to compete, including pole vault Olympic champion Yelena Isinbayeva, but she turned down the invitation due to illness. Many other major athletes refused their invitations for a variety of reasons, causing the competition to attract only meagre interest from the public. No more than 7,000 spectators attended, making the competition a financial failure. The competition was therefore not held again.

Other events

Malmö Arena has hosted several concerts as well as other music events such as Christmas shows and musicals. Britney Spears performed at the arena on 11 October 2011 during her Femme Fatale Tour. Rihanna was scheduled to bring her Loud Tour to Malmö Arena on 31 October 2011, but the event was cancelled with only a few hours' notice because of health issues, although she eventually performed at the venue in August 2016. Other international artists who have performed at the arena are Bob Dylan, Cliff Richard, Tom Jones, Lady Gaga, and many others. Lady Gaga's show holds the attendance record for concerts at the arena, having drawn a crowd of 11,300; the cancelled Rihanna concert would have set a new record with 11,700 tickets sold. The heats of Melodifestivalen, Sweden's national song competition and selection for the Eurovision Song Contest, were held at the arena between 2009 and 2020, and in 2023. It also hosted Fotbollsgalan, Sweden's award ceremony for domestic football, in 2009 and 2010.

The arena was selected to host the Eurovision Song Contest 2013, with the other contenders for the event being the Friends Arena in Stockholm and Scandinavium in Gothenburg. Due to the fact that Stockholm's Globe Arena was booked for the 2013 IIHF World Championship, Sveriges Television (SVT) decided to choose Malmö Arena as host venue due to its good transport links, as well as SVT's previous experiences hosting Melodifestivalen heats at the arena. SVT also expressed the desire to host the contest at a slightly smaller venue and city than previous years. In July 2023, it was chosen to host the 2024 edition of the contest.
