SN 1986G was a supernova that was observed on May 3, 1986 by Robert Evans.  Its host galaxy, Centaurus A, is about 15 million light-years away in the constellation Centaurus. Since Centaurus A is about 15 million light-years away from us, this supernova happened 15 million years ago.

SN 1986G was a bright blue-green star in the middle of the left part of the dust belt of Centaurus A. The blue-green color occurs because David Malin could take the red plate used in this composite image only one year after the supernova occurred, and it had faded away at that time.
