Deeping Gate is a village and civil parish, lying on the River Welland in Cambridgeshire. Traditionally, the area was part of the Soke of Peterborough, geographically considered a part of Northamptonshire; it now falls within the City of Peterborough unitary authority area of Cambridgeshire. With a very small population, void of any major services, including a post office or even a chapel, the community depends on nearby Market Deeping,  north of the river in Lincolnshire, for economic and market services. The parish had a population of 258 males and 257 females according to the 2011 Census. Renaissance composer Robert Fayrfax (Fairfax) was a native of the village. Fairfax House, the most prominent and grand property in the village, was home to the Fairfax Family.

In the 1870s Wilson described Deeping Gate as:a hamlet in Maxey parish, Northampton; at the boundary with Lincoln, 1 mile SE of Market-Deeping. Real property, Â£1, 867. Pop., 224.
