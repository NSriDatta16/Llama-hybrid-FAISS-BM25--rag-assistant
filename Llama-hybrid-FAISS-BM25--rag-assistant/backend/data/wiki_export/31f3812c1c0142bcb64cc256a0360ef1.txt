State Highway 95 (SH 95) is a state highway which connects the cities of Yoakum and Temple in the U.S. state of Texas.

Route description
The southern terminus of SH 95 is in Lavaca County at US 77 Alt. along the northern edge of Yoakum. The roadway continues south from this point as FM 3475. The highway runs north to Shiner, where it intersects US 90 Alt. It runs roughly parallel to the Union Pacific rail line through Moulton and into Fayette County.
 In Flatonia, SH 95 crosses both US 90 and I-10 before briefly turning to the northwest. It resumes a more northward course before entering Bastrop County. In the northern part of Smithville, SH 95 begins a concurrency with westbound SH 71. The two routes travel together to the northwest, reaching Bastrop; here, SH 71 splits from SH 95 and continues west toward Austin, and northbound SH 21 is briefly concurrent with SH 95 through the center of the city. After SH 21 separates and continues east toward Bryan–College Station, SH 95 resumes a northerly trajectory, passing to the west of Camp Swift before meeting and sharing a brief overlap with US 290 in Elgin. After separating from US 290, SH 95 again runs north parallel to the Union Pacific rail line, briefly crossing into Travis County before entering Williamson County, reaching a junction with US 79 in Taylor. Continuing north, it first passes through Granger and then through Bartlett at the Bell County line. SH 95 then turns to the northeast and passes through Holland. The route then reaches Temple, where the SH 95 designation ends at an interchange with US 190/SH 36 (future I-14). The roadway continues north as Loop 363.

The portion of SH 95 from SH 71 to US 290 has been designated part of the 10th Mountain Division Highway.

History
The route was designated on April 21, 1924 along a route from Taylor to Elgin. On April 6, 1932, it was extended south to Hochheim, replacing SH 109, and extended north to Temple, replacing part of SH 2B. On July 15, 1935, the section from Elgin to Flatonia was cancelled, creating a gap. On February 21, 1937, the section from Elgin to Bastrop was restored, partially closing the gap. On February 9, 1939, the road had already been improved from Elgin to Sayersville and this completed the connection to Bastrop. The Works Progress Administration funded the $109,000 relief project.
On September 26, 1939, the section from Yoakum to Hochheim was transferred to SH 111, and the section from Flatonia to Yoakum was renumbered to SH 297, eliminating the gap. On November 20, 1939, before signage was changed, SH 297 was changed back to SH 95, creating a gap between Flatonia and Bastrop. On May 29, 1941, the section of SH 95 from Flatonia north to Smithville was restored as a temporary route and SH 95 was concurrent with SH 71 between Bastrop and Smithville, closing the gap. The temporary route later became the permanent route because TxDOT could not construct a more direct route for SH 95 from Bastrop to Flatonia. On November 24, 1978, the section from SH 53 to SH 36 in Temple was cancelled and transferred to Loop 363.
