History
The township was recorded as Harewode in 1212 and 1302. The manor which included Bradshaw, was part of the Manchester fee held by the Grelleys in the Middle Ages. In 1212 it was divided, the parts held by Roger de Samlesbury and Alexander de Harwood. The Samlesbury portion descended in the same way as Breightmet and the Harwood portion to the Traffords of Trafford who sold it in 1589 and afterwards much divided. The Radcliffes and Bartons of Smithills Hall held land in Harwood for many generations and Adam Mort of Astley held a messuage and a fulling mill in 1630. In 1612, Sir Nicholas Mosley and his son, Edward, conveyed the manor of Harwood to a partnership of five yeomen; Matthew Harrison, Henry Haworth, Raufe Higson, Lawrence Horrocks and Edward Greenhalgh. In the Hearth tax returns of 1666, forty-two hearths were liable to tax but only one house had three hearths. The common lands were enclosed in 1801. Christ Church was built in 1840 and Wesleyan and Primitive Methodist chapels were also built.
