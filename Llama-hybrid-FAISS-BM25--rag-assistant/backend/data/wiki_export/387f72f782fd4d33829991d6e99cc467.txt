In 2008 Galli drove for the Stobart Ford team in all rounds of the WRC, replacing Jari-Matti Latvala. His first outing with the new team, after 10 months of absence in the series was quite successful - Galli managed to score 3 points in the drivers' and manufacturers' championship by finishing sixth overall. The Italian had some problems with the power steering on day two which cost him over a minute, but he was able to keep a good position. In Sweden, after three days of consistent pace, Galli equalled his best WRC result, finishing third and scoring another 6 points, which gave him fourth position in drivers' championship after two rounds.

After Rally Finland, Galli was eighth in the drivers' championship, only three points behind teammate Henning Solberg. However, at the following event, the Rallye Deutschland, Galli crashed heavily fracturing his left femur. As the recovery was expected to take five months, Galli would miss the five last rallies of the season.
