Premise
Ed Bellamy (Jack Noseworthy) discovers on his 20th birthday that he was an unknowing subject of a childhood medical experiment. Microchips had been implanted in his brain, which make him a genius but will also kill him by his 21st birthday.

Accompanied by Maria Cavalos (Lisa Dean Ryan), Ed tries to find a way to prevent his death. The research center orders the termination of the project and the elimination of anyone involved. The center frames Ed for a murder and sends Agent Winston (Whip Hubley) to capture him.

Reception
Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly rated the series as "B+." He described the dialog as "lame" but praised Noseworthy as a "lissome hunk," adding that the subtext "plays brilliantly" to the adolescent self-absorption of the MTV audience.
