Immanuel Christian School 

The school has been criticized for their anti-LGBT policies, which ban LGBTQ students and employees. This followed the decision of Karen Pence, second lady, to return as an art teacher in early 2019. The attention the school received as a result of this caused a media debate as to whether their policies are discriminatory. A result of this controversy is the decision of The Sheridan School to refuse to play division basketball games with ICS.
