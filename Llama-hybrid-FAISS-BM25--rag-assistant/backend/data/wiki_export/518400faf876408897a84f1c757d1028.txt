Peter Anthony O'Malley (born 23 June 1965) is an Australian professional golfer.

Early life
O'Malley was born in Bathurst, New South Wales.

Amateur career
O'Malley won the Australian Junior Championship and the New Zealand Amateur in 1986.

Professional career
O'Malley turned professional in 1987. He has won several times on the PGA Tour of Australasia, but spent most of the year playing on the European Tour. He was runner-up to Mark James in his first European Tour event, the 1989 Dubai Desert Classic, and has since won three titles on the European Tour. Perhaps the most famous of these three victories was his Scottish Open win which he played the last five holes in seven under par to snatch victory. He made the top-100 on the European Tour Order of Merit every year from 1989 through to 2007, with a best ranking of tenth in 1995. His greatest strength is his accuracy, and he topped the European Tour's driving accuracy rankings in 2001 and 2002.

O'Malley is married to Jill O'Malley and has two children, Tom and Jess.
