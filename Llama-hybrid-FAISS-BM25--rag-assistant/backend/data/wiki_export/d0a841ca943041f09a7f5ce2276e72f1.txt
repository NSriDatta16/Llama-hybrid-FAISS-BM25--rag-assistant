The 321st Special Tactics Squadron (321st STS) is an active ground unit, within the 752d Special Operations Group (752 SOG), United States Air Force, United States European Command, and is based at RAF Mildenhall, in Suffolk, eastern England.

This squadron, combined with the unit's sister airborne units in the 752d Special Operations Group, allows the group to be capable of handling situations within a 4,300 km (2,700 mi) range of RAF Mildenhall, or further with fuel stops, and make up the special operations forces element of the United States Air Forces in Europe. Their specialized training and support structure make them a very versatile unit.
