Bohunt School is a coeducational secondary school and sixth form located in the rural village of Liphook, Hampshire, England. The school was opened in 1978.

History
In 2009 the BBC reported that Bohunt students had achieved higher than the national average at GCSEs in four years. and had ranked mid-table in Hampshire on the proportion of pupils achieving the Level 2 threshold .

Bohunt was designated a Language College, which means that it specialises in modern foreign languages and all pupils take at least one GCSE. Bohunt offers Spanish, German, French, Japanese and Mandarin. In 2005 Bohunt was credited with an International School Award.

Previously a foundation school administered by Hampshire County Council, in April 2011 Bohunt School converted to academy status. The school is now sponsored by the Bohunt Education Trust.

In 2014 Bohunt School was awarded TES Overall School and Secondary School of the Year at the TES Awards.

Bohunt Chinese School
Bohunt Chinese School was an experiment that took place at the school in 2015. The experiment involved fifty Year Nine students at the school being educated by Chinese teachers using traditional Chinese teaching methods for a period of four weeks. This included mostly lecture-based teaching and 12-hour shifts at school.

At the end of the experiment, the academic achievement of the 50-pupil group that received Chinese education was compared with an equivalent group of their peers through an assessment carried out by an independent board by a peer review. In the assessment, pupils in the Chinese-educated group performed 10% better than their other peers in maths, science, and Mandarin.

This experiment was broadcast by the BBC as part of a three-episode documentary.
