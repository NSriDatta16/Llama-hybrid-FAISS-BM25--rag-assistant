History 
Uetze was first mentioned in 1022 as "Utisson". The name is derived from the ruling house "von Uttensen". From 1552 to 1885, Uetze was protectorate of a Vogt in the department of Meinersen. Uetze was designated a market town in 1695. 
In the afternoon of 21 April 1863, almost all of Uetze proper was destroyed in a fire. The volunteer fire department was founded on  5 June 1880. 
In 1885, Uetze became part of the Burgdorf District, the Hanover District in 1974 and Hanover Region in 2001. 
Uetze used to be part of the Eastphalian Low German language area, but Standard German has all but replaced the language. There is still an active community of Low German speakers in Eltze. A dictionary for the village's dialect is available in Standard German.

Transport 
Highway B 188 traverses the area from east to west, connecting Uetze proper and Altmerdingsen to Burgdorf and Gifhorn. The highways B 214 and B 444 connect to Celle, Braunschweig and Peine. The villages Dollbergen and Dedenhausen both have a train station on the Berlin-Lehrte Railway which are served by regional express line RE 30 from Hanover to Wolfsburg.
