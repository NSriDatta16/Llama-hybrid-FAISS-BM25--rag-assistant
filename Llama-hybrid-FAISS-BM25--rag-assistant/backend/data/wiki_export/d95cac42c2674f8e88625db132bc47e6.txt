Background
In March 2004, a warrant was issued for T.I.'s arrest after a violation of probation that resulted from a 1997 arrest on cocaine distribution and the manufacturing and distribution of a controlled substance. He was sentenced to three years in prison. While imprisoned in Cobb County, Georgia, he filmed an unauthorized music video.

Recording
After T.I. received his sentence, he was granted a work release program that allowed him to continue making music and proceeded to record several albums' worth of material. Recording sessions took place at P.S. West Studios, Silent Sounds Studios, and Stankonia Studios, all located in T.I.'s native Atlanta, Georgia. One recording session took place at the Orange Grove Studios in Los Angeles, California.

Critical reception

Upon its release, Urban Legend received generally favorable reviews from most music critics. Allmusic writer Andy Kellman opined that, "With all that chaos surrounding T.I., it's disappointing to hear him retracing his steps, rewriting old lines, developing with little progress. Perhaps it's asking too much to expect T.I. to show as much growth here as he did on Trap Muzik, but -- as is the case with Jadakiss -- remaining patient for that classic album (and you know he has one in him) is getting tough." Chuck Mindehall of Entertainment Weekly, in his review of the album, wrote, "when [T.I.] declares "I'm the King," you just about believe him." Tom Breihan of the Baltimore City Paper stated that although "T.I.â€™s flow is more focused and confident than it was on his 2003 breakthrough, Trap Muzik [...] the new album feels like a thrown-together collection instead of a unified work." Steve 'Flash' Juon of RapReviews stated that "If [T.I.] can stay clean and out of prison [...]  there seems to be no limit to how far he can go."
