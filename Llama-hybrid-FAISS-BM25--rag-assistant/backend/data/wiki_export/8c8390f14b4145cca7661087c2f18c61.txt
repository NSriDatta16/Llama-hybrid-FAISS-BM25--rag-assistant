Reception
In his review for Allmusic Mike DaRonco commented that "Man or Astro-man? could be the house band for every Star Trek convention across the country, sharing their love for sci-fi by incorporating it with nostalgic '60s surf rock. Lots of twangy guitar riffs mixed with B-movie samples and a high energy level cranked to 11 are spaced throughout 1000x" and concluded that the track "... Man Made of CO2 is worth the price of this album alone".

In his review for The A.V. Club John Krewson considered that "... there are more vocals than usual—true singing, not just the requisite scientific soundbites. It's a little edgier than usual for this band, and perhaps a fraction meaner, although the M.O. is still fast, fun and frenetic. Like all Man...Or Astro-Man? music, 1000X is an absolute blast."
