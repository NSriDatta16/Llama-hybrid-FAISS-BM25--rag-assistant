Fanling Highway () is a part of Route 9 in Hong Kong. It connects the new town of Tai Po and San Tin Highway, passing through Sheung Shui and Fanling on its way. The three lane expressway was constructed between 1983 and 1987.

Alignment
The road succeeds the Tolo Highway at the Lam Kam Interchange where it also interchanges with Tai Wo Service Road West, Lam Kam Road and Tai Po Road. The road then runs to the west of the East Rail line and then passes through the new towns of Fanling and Sheung Shui and diverges from the MTR near Choi Yuen Estate. The road passes through the Kwu Tung area and continues as the San Tin Highway.
