Hsieh Chia-hsien (; born 8 April 1976 in Hualien City, Hualien County, Taiwan) is a Taiwanese professional baseball player. Originally drafted by the Taiwan Major League's Taichung Agan in 1998, after TML's merger into CPBL he has been playing for the Chinese Professional Baseball League's Macoto Gida and its successors Macoto Cobras and Dmedia T-REX since 2003. A left-handed outfielder and first baseman, he is well known for his offensive and powerful batting. He has been a frequent member of the Chinese Taipei national baseball team since 1999 and holds a controversial record of reaching career 100th home run fastest in the history of professional baseball in Taiwan in within only 454 games; CPBL did not recognize this record because his first 75 home runs were hit in the TML. He also hit CPBL's milestone 5000th home run on April 12, 2006.

He competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics.
