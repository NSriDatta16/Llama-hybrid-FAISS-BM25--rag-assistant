History 
Coppenbrügge was first documented around 1000 in a borderline description of the Bishopric of Hildesheim as  Cobbanbrug   mentioned. On March 9, 1062, Emperor Henry IV granted Bishop Hezilo of Hildesheim the forest ban at Coppenbrügge. Built around 1200 Count Bernhard of Poppenburg, who sat on the castle Poppenburg, the mirror castle at Lauenstein. After that he called himself Bernhard von Poppenburg and Spiegelberg. The Spiegelburg was built in the valley between Ith and Osterwald on the old army and trade route near a swamp area. The road was Hellweg, which led from Aachen to Königsberg. After that it was the Reichsstraße 1 and today the federal highway No. 1. From 1217, Count Bernhard called himself only "von Spiegelberg".

In 1226 a feud broke out between Bernhard von Spiegelberg and Bodo von Homburg. In 1238, the Homburgs conquered the castle Spiegelberg, the Counts of Spiegelberg left the country. In 1247, the Homburgs built the castle Lauenstein. In 1260 Johann von Brünnighausen handed over his property to the bishop of Minden. This property was handed over to Count von Spiegelberg in 1281, which gave rise to the Counts of Spiegelberg and the main town of Coppenbrügge. Around 1300, the Spiegelberg donated land to the Carmelites to build their monastery in Marienau, and in 1303 Coppenbrügge Castle was rebuilt.

From 1409 to 1435 the Spiegelbergs fought with the Welfish dukes for new areas on the Weser and in the valley of the Hamel (river) Hamel. The bouts ended with a complete defeat of the Spiegelbergers, but the county is preserved. In 1494, the Spiegelbergers inherited Grafschaft Pyrmont.

In 1519 the Hildesheimer Stift feud broke out, the Hildesheim came into conflict with the Guelph Principalities Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel and Calenberg. This originally purely local feud developed into an altercation of Lower Saxon territorial princes, in which also the Counts of Spiegelberg were involved. The feud had only ended in 1523.

Spiegelberg came to the Westphalia in 1810, and the Vienna Congress (1815) brought the county back to the Nassau-Oranien (Netherlands). But already in 1819 Spiegelberg was sold as "Amt Coppenbrügge" to the Kingdom of Hannover, it became Prussian in 1866.
