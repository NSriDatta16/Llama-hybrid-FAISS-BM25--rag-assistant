Background

Location and date 
Thailand publicized its bid to host the pageant on 10 July 2004, during a visit by Miss Universe 2004 Jennifer Hawkins to the country. At the time, Chile, China, and Greece were also being considered to host the event. One month later, it was announced that Bangkok had been informally selected to host the competition, at a cost of US$6.5 million. The cost was to be funded by the Thai government in an attempt to boost tourism. In October, the proposal faced difficulties when the Thai government were slow to provide the promised funds, which discouraged prospective sponsors, leading Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra to become personally involved to make sure that plans were not derailed. The organization awarded official hosting rights to the Matching Entertainment company in December 2004, after an unsuccessful attempt by a different company, Showcase Thailand 2005.

In February 2005, after the Thai government confirmed plans to back the pageant, the Deputy Prime Minister refuted claims that the event would be held in Khao Lak, a resort town devastated by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, but confirmed that Southern Thailand would host events prior to the final competition.

Selection of participants 
Contestants from eighty-one countries and territories were selected to compete in the pageant. Six delegates were appointees to their position to replace the original dethroned winner.

Jana Doleželová, Miss České Republiky 2004, was originally supposed to compete at Miss Universe but did not compete after the Miss České Republiky organization lost the Miss Universe franchise license to the newly formed Česká Miss pageant. Cheryl Ankrah was originally crowned Miss Trinidad and Tobago 2005 but was dethroned after she was accused of not fulfilling her duties and becoming overweight. Although Ankrah initially got an injunction to prevent another pageant being held, a Judge overturned that and a second Miss Trinidad and Tobago pageant was held. The winner of the second pageant, who represented Trinidad and Tobago at Miss Universe, was Magdalene Walcott. Miss Hanoi-Vietnam 2005 Phạm Thu Hằng became Vietnam's representative in this year's competition after Miss Vietnam Photogenic 2004 Bùi Thị Diễm refused to compete because of her studies.
