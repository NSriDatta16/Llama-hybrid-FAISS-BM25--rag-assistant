In July 2005, Stith defended Scientology in media sources, after the Tom Cruise incident with Matt Lauer on The Today Show where Brooke Shields' use of medication for postpartum depression was discussed.  Stith called criticism by the media "hogwash", and stated "This is a very practical religion."

In 2006, Stith's pregnancy and delivery was reported on in the Chicago Daily Herald, in a report analyzing the silent birth practices of Scientology, and how this would apply to Katie Holmes.  The birth of Stith's fifth child, a boy, was described, in which Stith refused painkillers, and there was silence in the delivery room.  All of the medical personnel were also quiet, and when the baby was born, the physician whispered to Stith "It's a boy."  When asked about L. Ron Hubbard's own use of medications, and the presence of certain medications in the coroner's toxicology report after Hubbard's death, Stith stated:  "He might have been taking some medicine for asthma, but he certainly was not under any medicine for psychiatric reasons."
