Career
Galani worked in opera and sang professionally before she became known as an actor. She worked as a singer in England for four years in the 1960s then joined the Australian Opera for five years between 1967 and 1972.

Galani played a regular role in soap opera, Number 96 as Maria Panucci, the aunt of Harry Michaels' character Giovanni from late 1976 until the end of the series in August 1977, and then took a regular role in Australian Broadcasting Corporation situation comedy series Home Sweet Home (1980). Both roles were as fiery Italians.

Between these roles she made appearances in the first season of cult TV series Prisoner as Mrs. Bentley, a woman who had buried a baby alive, a crime later blamed on Lynn Warner (Kerry Armstrong, whom was wrongly incarcerated and continued to protest her innocence.
