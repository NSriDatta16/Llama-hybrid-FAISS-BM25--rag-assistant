On 25 February 2009, a small fire erupted in one of the engines and in one of the electric generators of Costa Romantica off the coast of Uruguay, about  from the city of Punta del Este.

After the refurbishing, the ship was renamed Costa neoRomantica and started her first voyage with the new name in March 2012. In early 2017, Costa neoRomantica arrived in Hong Kong to operate cruises in the Asia market. In February 2018, Costa neoRomantica served as The J Winter Fashion Show 2018 setting in Hong Kong.
