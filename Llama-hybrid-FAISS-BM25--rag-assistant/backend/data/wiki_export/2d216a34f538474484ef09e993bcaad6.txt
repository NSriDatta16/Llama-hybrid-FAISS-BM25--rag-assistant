2002: Vandermade started for his third season on the offensive line, this time at left guard as a junior in 2002 (he also has seen action at center in his career). He tore his right biceps tendon at Stanford, which required surgery and sidelined him the rest of the 2002 season.

He started 8 games (all but Oregon, Washington, Arizona State and Notre Dame) and appeared in 11 contests (he did not play at Washington). He also saw some action at guard in 2001. He was on the "Watch List" for the 2001 Dave Rimington Trophy, given to the nation's top center.

2000: As just a redshirt freshman in 2000, Vandermade did an exceptional job while starting all season, the first 5 games at left offensive guard (for an injured Trevor Roberts) and then the final 7 contests at center (for an injured Eric Denmon). He was named to the 2000 Freshman All-American first-teams by The Sporting News and Football News.
