History
The village's name means "new farm or settlement". 'West' to distinguish from other Newtons.

West Newton is included in Snettisham's complex entry in the Domesday book where it is divided in ownership between William de Warenne and the Bishop of Bayeux. Related berewicks are West Newton and Castle Rising, moreover Weston Longville is said to be in Snettisham's valuation. However West Newton is clearly in the ownership of the Bishop of Bayeux.

On 1 April 1935 the parish was abolished and merged with Sandringham.

West Newton parish church is dedicated to Saint Peter and Saint Paul, and has a fourteenth-century church tower.
