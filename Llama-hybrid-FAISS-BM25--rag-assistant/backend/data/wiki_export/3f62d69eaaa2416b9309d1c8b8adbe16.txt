Albert E. Cowdrey (December 8, 1933 in New Orleans, Louisiana – August 21, 2022) was an American author who wrote nonfictional historical studies and fantasy and science fiction literature. He was educated in Tulane and Johns Hopkins universities and worked for twenty-five years as a military historian, mostly in and around Washington, D.C. As a Chief of the Special History Branch in the U.S. Army, he wrote a number of books about the history of the medical branches of the army. He published the science fiction novel Crux and more than fifty short stories. Much of his short fiction has appeared in Fantasy and Science Fiction and centered on his love for New Orleans, where he was born and raised. He is the only writer to receive awards from both the American Historical Association and the World Fantasy Convention.

In 2003 Cowdrey's short story "Queen for a Day" won the World Fantasy Award. His novella "The Overseer" received a nomination in the 2009 World Fantasy Awards. His novella "The Tribes of Bela" was a finalist for the 2005 Nebula Award.
