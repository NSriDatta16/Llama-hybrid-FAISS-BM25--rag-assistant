The CBS Kidshow  was an American Saturday morning children's programming block that aired on CBS from October 3, 1998, to September 9, 2000.  Canada-based Nelvana took over programming responsibilities.

History

In January 1998, CBS entered into an agreement with the Canada-based animation studio Nelvana to program the Saturday morning time slot allocated to children and replace the network-programmed block Think CBS Kids. CBS Kidshow was planned to relaunch as the  on September 19 of that year, but CBS delayed the block's relaunch to October 3.

The new block featured several first-run series co-produced by Nelvana, CBS and Scottish Television such as Anatole, Mythic Warriors, Rescue Heroes and Flying Rhino Junior High. The premiere of Mythic Warriors was further delayed due to its complicated animation techniques; reruns of Tales from the Cryptkeeper (with a revival aired in a year later) aired in Mythic Warriors''' timeslot until it premiered on November 7.

In June 2000, a few months after Viacom (which CBS founded in 1952 as television syndication distributor CBS Films, Inc., and later spun off in 1971 after the then-recently implemented Financial Interest and Syndication Rules barred networks from holding financial interest in syndicated programming content) completed its $37 billion merger with CBS Corporation (which was the original Westinghouse Electric Corporation that purchased CBS in 1995), CBS reached an agreement with new corporate cousin Nickelodeon to air programming from the cable channel's preschool-oriented block Nick Jr. beginning that September. Prior to the deal, former Nick Jr. series Rupert moved to the CBS Kidshow block in January 1999, as part of an agreement in which both it and another animated series, Franklin, swapped networks (with Franklin moving from CBS to the Nick Jr. block on Nickelodeon).

The CBS Kidshow block ended its run on September 9, 2000, and was replaced the following week on September 16 by Nick Jr. on CBS, which featured two Nelvana series - the aforementioned Franklin and Little Bear; several other Nelvana series from Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. continued to air on CBS until September 9, 2006, after which, the Nickelodeon block was replaced with KOL Secret Slumber Party as a result of Viacom and CBS demerging earlier that year.

Programming

Scheduling variances and pre-emptions
Although the block was intended to air on Saturday mornings, some CBS affiliates deferred some programs over the course of the CBS Kidshow block's run to Sunday or early Saturday morning time slots or tape delayed the entire block in order to accommodate local weekend morning newscasts. Other stations pre-empted some programs outright for these same reasons, as well as due to professional and college sports broadcasts scheduled by CBS (especially in the case of college football and basketball tournaments) or its stations (primarily through sports syndication services), although most affiliates aired the block in its entirety.
