Saints
Saints (ascetic Sthanakvasins, called maharaj saheb's) wear white clothes and cover their mouths with a square white cloth or Muhapatti/Mukhvastrika intended to minimize the risk of inhaling small insects or other airborne life forms, which Sthanakvasins see as a violation of Ahimsa "Non-violence". Saints are allowed to keep seven "Patra" (Utensils/Bowls).They eat food collected from followers' houses and do not save edibles beyond the next meal and water is not kept even for a single night. All eating and drinking has to be done between sunrise and sunset.
