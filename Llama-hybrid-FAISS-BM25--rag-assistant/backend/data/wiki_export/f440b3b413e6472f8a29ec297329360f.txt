The Wefri Warsay Yika'alo (WWY) or Warsay Yika'alo Program of Eritrea is an ambitious project of post-war recovery. It is similar to other economic recovery programs and is often compared to the Marshall Plan.1, 2, 3

The program is a series of sponsored investments managed by the Eritrean government in economic, education, health and transportation related infrastructure. These investments are typically made by a mixture of grants and loans from international organizations and from the Government of Eritrea. The transfer of skills is an important component of this program.

Detractors of the program are concerned with the work schedule and conditions of the participants.
