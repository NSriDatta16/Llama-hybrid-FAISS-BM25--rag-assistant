The Place du Louvre is a square immediately to the east of the Palais du Louvre in Paris, France. To the south is the Quai du Louvre and beyond that is the River Seine. The HÃ´tel du Louvre is also located here, between the Louvre Palace and the Palais Royal.

The clearing of cluttered buildings to create the square was accomplished by Baron Haussmann in the 1850s.
