Spazz was an American powerviolence band active between 1992 and 2000. The trio released numerous records within this time, many of which are now highly collectible due to their relative rarity. The band's releases often showcased their unusual sense of humour: absurdly long and nonsensical song titles, audio samples from B movies and kung fu films between songs and the occasional use of hip hop beats as well as saxophones, banjos and other instruments rarely associated with hardcore punk. All three of the members shared vocal duties, usually changing in sequence from line to line. The group would typically play at all ages venues. 2015 saw the release of a tribute LP to Spazz by Scottish record label Mind Ripper Collective titled "Spazzin' To The Oldies - A Tribute To Spazz". In 2016, it was announced that Tankcrimes will reissue the out-of-print Spazz albums Sweatin' To The Oldies and Sweatin' 3: Skatin', Satan & Katon.

After Spazz
Spazz vocalist and bassist Chris Dodge's record label, Slap-a-Ham Records, was a fixture during the rapid rise and decline of powerviolence in the late '80s and early '90s, releasing influential records by the likes of Man Is the Bastard, No Comment, Crossed Out, Infest and Spazz, amongst others.

The label's Fiesta Grande was an annual power violence festival held at 924 Gilman Street during its heyday, from 1992 to the band's demise in 2000. Since then, he has been involved in several musical projects, most notably East West Blast Test with highly regarded extreme metal drummer Dave Witte, formerly of Discordance Axis, Melt-Banana and many others. In recent years, he has performed with bands like Despise You, Lack Of Interest, Infest, and To The Point.

Spazz vocalist and drummer Max Ward's label, 625 Thrashcore, has started their own festival, 'Super Sabado Gigante', in a similar vein. Spazz vocalist and guitarist Dan Bolleri makes hip hop music under the alias DJ Eons One.
