Publications 
The 1985 publication of his book The Eudaemonic Pie is believed to have motivated the passage of a Nevada law banning the use of devices to gain an advantage at casino games.

In his preface to Camping with the Prince, Bass states that he accompanied seven scientific expeditions into Africa from 1985 to 1987. This book focuses on African viewpoints to the African situation. It underlines the intricacy of Africa, more complex and more resilient than generally assumed by those looking at the continent from the outside. Among the African scientists presented to readers of this book are Oyewale Tomori and Thomas Odhiambo. Bass also mentions in that preface that when he was a teenager he traveled along Africa's east coast, down the Congo and up West Africa.
