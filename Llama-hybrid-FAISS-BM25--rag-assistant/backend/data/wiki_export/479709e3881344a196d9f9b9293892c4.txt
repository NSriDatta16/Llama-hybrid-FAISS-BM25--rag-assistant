McLean Park is a sports ground in Napier, New Zealand. The two main sports played at the ground are cricket and rugby union. It is one of the largest cricket grounds in New Zealand.

McLean Park is a sports ground of international standards which includes the main outdoor stadium and the indoor Rodney Green Centennial Events Centre. The home teams for this ground are the Hawke's Bay Rugby Union and Central Districts Cricket Association. The two ends of the stadium are named the Centennial Stand End and Embankment End. Its close proximity to the International Date Line makes it the world's easternmost Test match ground.

Ground
McLean Park is on Latham Street in Napier South, about one kilometre south of the Napier CBD. It was initially named 'Sir Donald McLean Park' by an act of Parliament after Sir Douglas McLean (also spelt Maclean) donated ten acres of land as a memorial to his father in 1910. 

In cricket, the ground is primarily a one-day venue with square dimensions that allow attacking batsman to score freely especially in the opening overs. There are four covered stands and a large grass bank opposite the Centennial Stand. The wicket tends to become slower throughout the day therefore captains prefer to set targets on this pitch. It has held first-class matches since 1952 and ten Tests since 1979. New Zealand's Test record at the ground is seven draws, one win and two losses. It has held at least one one-day international every season since 1990. The ground has a capacity of 19,700.

Usage

Cricket
The ground is used for hosting all formats. The first ODI played here was between New Zealand and Sri Lanka in Rothman's Cup of 1982/83. In this match New Zealand defeated Sri Lanka by 7 wickets.

Rugby Union
McLean Park is the home stadium of the Hawkes Bay Magpies in the Mitre 10 Cup. It has also hosted several New Zealand Maori games in the past. During the 1987 Rugby World Cup the stadium played host to the Pool 2 game between Canada and Tonga on 24 May 1987. At the 2011 Rugby World Cup, McLean Park was again chosen as a venue and hosted two games in Pool A, France vs. Canada on 18 September 2011 and Canada vs. Japan on 27 September 2011.

To date the stadium has only hosted two All Blacks tests. The first was played on 7 June 1996, when the All Blacks beat Western Samoa 51-10 on the Samoans' tour of New Zealand. This test has the distinction of being the first home test in which the All Blacks played under floodlights. The second test featuring the All Blacks took place on 6 September 2014. This was a round 3 clash in the Rugby Championship between the All Blacks and Argentina. The All Blacks won 28-9.

The stadium also serves as an alternative home venue for the Hurricanes franchise in Super Rugby. A total of 11 Super Rugby matches have been played at McLean Park, the first being on 15 March 1996, when the Hurricanes beat Transvaal by 32-16. In the aftermath of the 2011 Christchurch earthquake, the Crusaders used the stadium as a home ground for two matches against the Chiefs in 2011 and 2012.

Rugby League
Melbourne Storm Rugby league played an NRL game against St. George-Illawarra Dragons at the stadium on 25 July 2015. The ground will host a New Zealand Warriors home game against the Brisbane Broncos on 27 May 2023.

Redevelopments
After redevelopment of the park the Graham Lowe Stand opened on Saturday 1 August 2009 when the Hawke's Bay Magpies opened their Air New Zealand Cup campaign with a win against Auckland. Redevelopments took just one year to complete. The stand was built with the 2011 Rugby World Cup and the 2015 Cricket World Cup in prospect; both events included games at the ground. Drainage problems led two ODIs in January 2018 against Pakistan and against England in February 2018 to be moved. McLean Park made its international return with New Zealand playing India in January 2019.
