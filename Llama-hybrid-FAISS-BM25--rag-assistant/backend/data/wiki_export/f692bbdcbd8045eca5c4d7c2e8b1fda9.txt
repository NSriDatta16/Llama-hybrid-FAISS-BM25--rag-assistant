Tim Buckley is the debut album by Los Angeles based singer-songwriter Tim Buckley, released in October 1966. Most of the songs on it were co-written by Buckley and Larry Beckett while they were in high school. It was recorded at Sunset Sound in Los Angeles, California.

The album was re-released in 2001 in a compilation with follow up album Goodbye and Hello by WEA/Elektra, then again in 2005, this time coupled with Greetings from L.A..

Rhino Handmade Records reissued the album in 2011 as part of a two-disc set. The first disc contains both the stereo and mono versions of the album. The second disc contains 22 unreleased recordings Buckley made in 1965 with The Bohemians and in 1966 with Larry Beckett.

Legacy
In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Richie Unterberger feels the album is Buckley's most straightforward and accessible, without the experimental touches that characterised his later work, though with an astounding lyrical and musical sophistication for a 19-year-old.
