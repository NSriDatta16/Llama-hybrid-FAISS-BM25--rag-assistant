The Syracuse University School of Architecture, commonly known as Syracuse Architecture, is one of the 13 schools and colleges of Syracuse University. The school offers bachelor's and master's degrees in architecture that are accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB). Founded in 1873, it is the fourth oldest architecture program in the United States.

History
The architecture school was one of the early schools on Syracuse campus, starting in 1873, just three years after Syracuse University was founded. The school was created as one of two new departments within the College of Fine Arts by George Fisk Comfort who served as the Dean of the new college. He later founded Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Prominent local architects, including Horatio Nelson White, Archimedes Russell, and Ward Wellington Ward were recruited as professors. The original College of Fine Arts was the first institution in the United States to offer both B.A. and M.A. degrees in architecture, painting, sculpture, music, and other. The college was dissolved in 1945, with many new schools forming in its place.

The first female student enrolled at Syracuse architecture in 1877, in process becoming the first female in the United States to study architecture as a profession. Frances Whipple Bigelow became the first female graduate in 1898.

Facilities

The program was first housed in the Hall of Languages, and was moved to the newly built Crouse College in 1883, then to Steele Hall in 1908. It finally found its permanent home in newly designed, skylit Slocum Hall in 1919. The school has long been housed in Slocum Hall on the university's main campus, but in January, 2006 the School of Architecture moved to a temporary home in a converted warehouse in downtown Syracuse so that Slocum Hall could undergo massive renovations. As of fall of 2008, the school has returned to its home in Slocum Hall.

Academics
The undergraduate program enrolls nearly 700 students, representing 46 countries, and leads to a Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch.) degree. The graduate program enrolled 120 students in 2021, and offers Master of Architecture (M.Arch.) and post-professional Master of Science (M.S.) in Architecture programs.
