Skapocalypse Now! is the début album by ska band Mustard Plug. It was released in October 1992 on singer Dave Kirchgessner’s own label, Dashiki Clout. After requests for the tape grew, Hopeless Records re-released Skapocalypse Now! in 1998 on CD for mail order, direct to store and concert sales. Along with the original songs, other live and studio bonus tracks were added.
