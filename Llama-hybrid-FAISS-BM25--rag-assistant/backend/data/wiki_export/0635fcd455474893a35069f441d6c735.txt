The Central Office for Combating Organized Crime, also under the Ministry of Interior, collects information about national and international crimes involving criminal organizations, mainly trafficking, financial crimes, and domestic and international terrorism. The service also is a coordinating body for other police agencies.

The National Investigative Service, which is part of the judicial system and consists or investigating justices called "sledovateli" (inspectors, investigators), is the national investigative agency for serious crimes, responsible for preparing supporting evidence in criminal cases. In 2005 a new penal code shifted some of that service's caseload to the National Police Service.

The Ministry of Interior also heads the Border Police Service and the National Gendarmerie, a specialized branch for anti-terrorist activity, crisis management and riot control. In 2005 the Border Police, which underwent large-scale reform under European Union (EU) supervision in the early 2000s, had 12,000 personnel.
