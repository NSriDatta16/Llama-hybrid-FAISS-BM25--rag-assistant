The Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China (MOH) was a cabinet-level executive department which plays the role of providing information, raising health awareness and education, ensuring the accessibility of health services, and monitoring the quality of health services provided to citizens and visitors in the mainland of the People's Republic of China. In the reforms of 2013 the ministry has been dissolved and its functions integrated into the now-dissolved agency called the National Health and Family Planning Commission.

The MOH was also involved in the control of illness and disease, coordinating the utilization of resources and expertise where necessary. It also cooperates and keeps in touch with other health ministries and departments, including those of the special administrative regions, and the World Health Organization (WHO).

As part of the National Health and Family Planning Commission it is now headed by Ms. Li Bin. Until 2013 it was headed by the Minister for Health, a position last held by Chen Zhu who was then the only minister in the State Council, and one of the two ministers who are not members of the Chinese Communist Party. He is the chairman of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, one of the eight legally permissible political parties of the PRC.
