Nicholson Road is a major north-south road in the southeastern suburbs of Perth, Western Australia, connecting Albany Highway in Cannington with the large residential areas of Thornlie and Canning Vale, before leaving the Perth urban area and terminating in Oakford.

History
Until the construction of Kwinana Freeway to Thomas Road in 1993, Nicholson Road was one of southern Perth's most important routes.

Nicholson Road formerly crossed the Kwinana freight railway at a level crossing. Construction of a six-lane road bridge over the rail line to replace the crossing began in May 2017 and was completed in March 2018.
