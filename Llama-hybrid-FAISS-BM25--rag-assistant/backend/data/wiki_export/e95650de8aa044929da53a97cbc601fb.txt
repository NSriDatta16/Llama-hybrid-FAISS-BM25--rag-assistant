Justirisers

The Justirisers
The Justirisers are three chosen humans who are given the mysterious Justipower, the "Earth's will" that was discovered by the Riserseijin Noulan who utilized it to seal away Kaiser Hades long ago. Each of those powers are based on the Four Symbols of Chinese Origin. Each one is equipped with an In-Loader. By combining Justipower and characteristic element in their body, the In-Loader makes them generate a high-powered suit of armor which transforms them into a Justiriser. The transformation call is "Souchaku!" ("Equip!"). The In-Loader also acts as a communications device between the three Justirisers.

 Shouta Date / Riser Glen  Shouta Date is a 2nd-year high-school student at Seitai High School. He is known to slack off from both schoolwork and kendo practice. He does not take most things as seriously as he should, and it does not really change throughout the series. Shouta, as is the first Justiriser to awaken on-screen upon facing the attack from the CyberKnights, and the first to summon GenSeiJuu Riseross. After becoming a Justiriser, he takes up the job of protecting humanity instantly, and begins to take his kendo practice more seriously… although not his schoolwork. He also happens to be a fan of boxing Champion Naoto Matsuzaka (Sazer Tawlon from the Gransazers) who helped him regain his own Justi Power and In Loader. Using Glen's In Loader, Shouta transforms into Riser Glen, the Justiriser that is formed by combination with 'Courage' in his body and uses the power of it. His red-colored suit's design is based on the Samurai from Japan's Warring States Period with his helmet having the Phoenix Motif. Glen's Justi Power specializes in close-range combat and harnesses Flame Energy in his attacks, including his punching move "Blazing Knuckle" and his aerial-kicking move "Cross-Fire Kick". Riser Glen's main weapon is the Katana Blade "Glen Sword", which can be unsheathed for better offensive capability and can be re-sheathed to charge up his Justi Power of Fire for his signature finisher, "Raging Flame", which releases a destructive wave of blazing slashes from his sword. He later picks up a more powerful finisher, "Flash Blazer" which is a backhand slash that releases a single wave of extremely powerful blazing slash to counter more powerful enemies. Later in the series, Shouta also becomes the vessel for the power of Shirogane with the use of Mio's Justi Spark. As Riser Shirogane, Shouta seems to be in control but does not act up like he does, even as Riser Glen. He has feelings for Yuka. He worries a lot for her safety, sacrificing his Justi Power to save Yuka's life when Zora fatally wounded her. But it took Naoto's guidance and the Justi Crystal gathering energy that resonated with Shouta's courage (the Justipower that powers Glen) to completely restore Shouta's Justiriser powers. Shouta also happens to work as a part-time Dispatch Rider like Tenma Kuudo (Sazer Tarious in Gransazers) does.
 Yuka Sanada / Riser Kageri  Yuka Sanada is also a 2nd-year Seitai High School Student like Shouta, and is the captain of the school’s Lacrosse team. Unlike Shouta, who is set in his path of protecting humanity, Yuka is much more conflicted. She would rather go back to being a regular schoolgirl, as her duties interfere more and more with her social life. But when confronted with danger, she does not hesitate to fight. Shouta was worried for her protection, which Yuka in the end shows that she can handle the dangers of being in harms way. She also has feelings for Shouta. Her awakening as a Justiriser came after a monster attack in which she tries to save a young girl from collapsing rubble in which the Justi Power of Wind created a barrier to protect both of them, and she was given her Kageri's In Loader in the process which she only used it after she saw Shouta becoming Riser Glen and decides to save him while he was attacked the second time. Using the In Loader, Yuka transforms into Riser Kageri, the Justiriser that is formed by combination with 'Virtue' in her body and uses the power of it. Her marine-colored suit's design is based on the Japanese Kuno-ichi (Female Ninja) with her helmet bearing the Tiger Motif. Kageri's Justi Power utilizes powers of Wind in her Shinobi-style moves with High-Speed attacks being her specialty, allowing her to perform moves such as "Tornado Splash" that allows her to evade enemy attacks. Riser Kageri's main weapon is the cross-bow style weapon "Kageri Striker", which can be used either as a storage for her Kageri Daggers to throw against enemies, or activate its close-combat form "Claw Attacker" for close-quarters combat. Kageri's finisher "Phantom Crush", harnesses the charging of the Justi Power of Wind into the Kageri Striker to fire off a powerful energy arrow at the enemy.
  Shinya Hiraga / Riser Gant  Shinya Hiraga is a 2nd-year College student in Kyonan University majoring in robotic engineering. Shinya is much more serious than either Shouta or Yuka, and although he uses his powers as to fight, the fighting troubles him. He does not believe in just fighting to protect humanity, and questions why they were given the power, and what for. It takes much for anyone to become friends with him, and earning his trust is hard. Sometimes his strong heroic sense of chivalry leads to protecting Mio since he has deep feelings for the guardian, lest he wants to protect her from any harm. Several females high school students called him "Shin-sama". A running gag in the series where Yuka's Lacrosse teammates; Rio Matsubara and Asami Segawa looking him. He decided running away from them, making his college friends teasing about it. His awakening traces back from the same incident as Yuka which he helped in the evacuation of those running away from the attack, but caught himself nearly crushed by the rubble caused in which the Justi Power of Thunder indwelled him and created a similar barrier that protected him. And he was given Gant's In Loader as a result. Using the In Loader, Shinya transforms into Riser Gant, the Justiriser that is formed by combination with 'Wisdom' in his body and uses the power of it. The design of his black-colored suit's is based on the Japanese Yamabushi (Hermit Monks of the Shugendo Doctrine), with the helmet design having the Tortoise Motif. Gant's Justi Power harnesses Thunder energy and specializes in ranged combat. Riser Gant's main weapon is the twin-barreled shotgun "Gant Slugger" that works effectively in medium-to-long range shooting. The weapon can also be changed into another form called the "Gant Rifle" for longer-range precision shooting. As a shooting weapon, the Gant Slugger/Rifle expedites energy for its shooting moves and requires a re-holstering of the weapon to replenish the energy within the weapon for prolonged combat. The "Gant Slugger" can be powered-up to become the "Gant Buster" which activates two additional barrels at the centre of the weapon as well as the Target Anchor that locks onto the enemy, allowing Gant to perform this form's finisher "Varsus Cannon" that shoots out powerful lightning bolts from all its barrels to pulverize his enemy, while another of Gant's finisher "Thrust Shoot" can be performed with the "Gant Rifle" mode.
 Riser Shirogane  The "Legendary Hero of the Azure Planet", Riser Shirogane is the physical manifestation of JustiPower sealed away within the Justi Crystal that Nolun gave to the Tendo Clan centuries ago. However, by combining the hearts of the three Justirisers, and the prayers of the Justi Crystal bearer, Glen becomes the vessel through which Shirogane comes into being. Becoming Shirogane grants Glen immense power that can easily defeat even the strongest enemy. It also changes Shouta's personality to a calmer and non-violent kind, contrasting the original to such an extent that he has on many occasions even spared an enemy or gave them a chance to retreat, only to be forced to kill them when they refuse. Becoming Shirogane caused shock to Shouta's body the first few times, but afterward he was able to transform without difficulty. However becoming Shirogane takes an even larger toll on Mio, and she is usually unconscious for some time after a battle in which he is summoned. Shirogane can summon forth the multi-mode weapon "Justi Arms" in combat. This powerful weapon has three modes that is reflective of the three Justirisers' Specialties: "JustiBlade" resembling Riser Glen's close-combat specialty; "JustiBlaster" resembling Riser Gant's ranged combat specialty; and "JustiLancer" resembling Riser Kageri's speed combat specialty. Its core power has the combined powers of all 3 Justirisers magnified by the JustiCrystal that Mio holds and lasts as long as she can maintain the unity within it. Its powerful finisher "JustiCrash" is also a resemblance of Riser Glen's "Raging Flame" finisher but with the combined powers of the three Justirisers' energy that is capable of taking out the most powerful of enemies. In the final battle, the fusion of Mio's Justi Crystal and Rigel's Riser Power gave birth to a new "Mirage Power" that allowed the three Justirisers as well as their GenSeiShin to fuse into one single entity in the form of a "Giant Riser Shirogane" to take on the Giant Kurogane Beast. This form and finisher is exactly the same one as the human-sized version, but scaled-up in magnitude and power as well as gaining the power to deflect attacks similar to that of Shirogane's GenSeiShin "Ryuuto".
