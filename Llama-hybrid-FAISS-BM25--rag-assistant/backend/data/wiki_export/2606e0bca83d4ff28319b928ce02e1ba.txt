John Lynch (10 April 1889 – 10 June 1957) was an Irish businessman and  Fine Gael politician who served as a Senator for the Industrial and Commercial Panel from 1954 to 1957 and a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Kerry North constituency from 1951 to 1954.

From the Stack's Mountains area near Kilflynn, County Kerry, Lynch was the owner of a bakery business in Listowel. He was elected to both Kerry County Council and Listowel Urban District Council before being chosen as a Dáil candidate.
Lynch was unexpectedly elected to Dáil Éireann on his first attempt, at the 1951 general election, as a Fine Gael candidate for the Kerry North constituency taking his seat in the 14th Dáil. He took the seat of Eamon Kissane, sitting Fianna Fáil TD for North Kerry.

At the 1954 general election, he lost his seat to the Clann na Poblachta candidate Johnny Connor, but was then elected to the 8th Seanad on the Industrial and Commercial Panel, where he served until 1957.

He stood again as a candidate for Dáil Éireann at the 1957 general election, but was unsuccessful. Clann na Poblachta had not put forward a candidate, and the seat was won by a Fianna Fáil candidate, Daniel Moloney. Lynch did not contest the subsequent election to the 9th Seanad, and died suddenly at his business premises in June 1957. 

Lynch had fought in the Irish War of Independence and as an officer in the pro-treaty National Army and was buried with full military honours.
