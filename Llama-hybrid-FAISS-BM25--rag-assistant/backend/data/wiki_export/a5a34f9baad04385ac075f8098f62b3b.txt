Biography

Early life

Haven was born in Boston, Massachusetts to Jotham Haven, Jr. and Elizabeth (Spear) Haven, having descended from early colonists from Massachusetts Bay Colony, including Edmund Rice one of the founders of Sudbury, Massachusetts. He is also a descendant of John Alden of the Mayflower.

Education and early career

He graduated from Wesleyan University in 1842.  He had charge of a private academy at Sudbury, Massachusetts, while at the same time pursuing a course of theological and general study.  He became Principal of Amenia Seminary, New York, in 1846. He entered the Methodist ministry in the New York Annual Conference in 1848.  Five years later he accepted the professorship of Latin at the University of Michigan.  The following year he became the Chair of English language, literature and history.  He resigned in 1856 and returned to Boston, where he served as the editor of Zion's Herald for seven years.  During this time he also served two terms in the Massachusetts State Senate and part of the time as an overseer of Harvard University.
