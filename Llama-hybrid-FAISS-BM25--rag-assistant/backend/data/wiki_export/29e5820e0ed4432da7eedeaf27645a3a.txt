Charlotte and Her Boyfriend () is a 13-minute 1958 film by Franco-Swiss director Jean-Luc Godard. It is shot entirely in or from a hotel room, in which Jules (Jean-Paul Belmondo) gives Charlotte (Anne Collette) a seemingly endless and self-indulgent tirade on her faults and his tribulations. Belmondo's voice is in fact dubbed by Godard.

It is a homage to Jean Cocteau's successful one-act play , where the roles are opposite.

It can be seen on the Criterion and Optimum DVDs of À Bout de Souffle.
