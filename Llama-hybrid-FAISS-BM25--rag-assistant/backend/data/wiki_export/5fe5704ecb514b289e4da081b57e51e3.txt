History

T-CAT was opened in 1972 in preparation for the opening of the New Tokyo International Airport (now known as Narita Airport) in 1978. Since Narita Airport is located  from the city, the terminal was intended to increase the convenience of the airport with offering airline check-in facilities until September 2001. T-CAT also at one point had exit immigration pre-clearance desks, so that passengers could complete exit formalities at T-CAT and then use a special lane to bypass exit immigration at Narita Airport.
