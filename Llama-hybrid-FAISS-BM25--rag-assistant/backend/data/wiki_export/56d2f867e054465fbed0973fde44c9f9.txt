The 13th congressional district of Ohio is represented by Representative Emilia Sykes. Due to reapportionment following the 2010 United States census, Ohio lost its 17th and 18th congressional districts, necessitating redrawing of district lines. Following the 2012 elections, the 13th district changed to take in much of the territory in the former 17th district, including the city of Youngstown and areas east of Akron.

It was one of several districts challenged in a 2018 lawsuit seeking to overturn Ohio's congressional map as an unconstitutional gerrymander.  According to the lawsuit, the 13th resembles a "jigsaw puzzle piece" that reaches out to grab the portion of Akron not taken in by the Cleveland-based 11th district.

From 2003 to 2013, the district ran from Lorain to include part of Akron, also taking in the suburban areas in between.

In the 2020 redistricting cycle, Ohio lost its 16th congressional district and this district was redrawn to include all of Summit County and parts of Stark and Portage County including Canton, North Canton and parts of Massillon, while Youngstown was removed from the district.
