History
Built in 1922, North Dallas High School is one of the oldest standing high school buildings in the city of Dallas; Booker T. Washington High School was established in 1902 as the Dallas Colored High School, but its current building was constructed well afterward. By 1925, the school had developed sufficient community loyalty that a district decision to rename the school Clinton P. Russell High School met with opposition from numerous locals, predominately mothers, who physically blocked the ladders of workmen attempting to make the change, leading the district to rescind its decision the following week.

In the early 1990s the school's size placed it in the 5A sports division, until late 2000, when it dropped to 4A.

 most of the students were racial and ethnic minorities (races other than non-Hispanic white) and about 10% were classified as homeless.
