Humble Independent School District is a school district located in Humble, Texas, United States. It serves the city of Humble, small portions of the city of Houston (including the community of Kingwood), and portions of unincorporated Harris County (including the communities of Atascocita and Fall Creek). A small section of the district extends into Montgomery County. For the 2018â€“2019 school year, the district enrolled 43,553 students.

Humble ISD currently has five high schools, one magnet high school, seven middle schools, and twenty-five elementary schools. The district's flagship high school, Humble High School, opened in 1918.  It later moved to a new building, Charles Bender High School in 1929, and eventually to its current location on Wilson Road, as Humble High School, in 1965.  In 1979, Humble ISD opened Kingwood High School in the northern part of the district. Quest High School, the district's magnet high school of choice, opened in 1995 in the Community Learning Center.

In recent years, Humble ISD has become one of the fastest growing school districts in Texas. Humble High School's population grew to over 3000 students, which led to the opening of Atascocita High School in 2006. AHS was designed with smaller learning communities, in which students take their core classes in one of eight houses located at the school. After the opening of AHS, Humble and Kingwood High Schools were renovated and installed with smaller learning communities. In 2007, the district opened Kingwood Park High School at the former Kingwood ninth grade campus. Continued growth in the southern part of the district led to Humble ISD building Summer Creek High School, which opened in 2009.

In 2010, the school district was rated "recognized" by the Texas Education Agency.
