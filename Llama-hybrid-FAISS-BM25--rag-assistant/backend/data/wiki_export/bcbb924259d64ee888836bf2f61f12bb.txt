St Vincent's College (colloquially known as Vinnies), is an independent Roman Catholic single-sex secondary day and boarding school for girls, located in Victoria Street, Potts Point, an inner-city suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.

The college is the oldest registered Catholic girls' school in Australia, founded by the Sisters of Charity as a co-educational primary school in 1858. St Vincent's College follows the spirituality of Ignatius of Loyola. The college has a non-selective enrolment policy and currently caters for approximately 714 girls in Years 7 to 12, including approximately 61 boarders.

St Vincent's is affiliated with the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia (AHISA), the Australian Boarding Schools' Association (ABSA), the Alliance of Girls' Schools Australasia (AGSA), and is a member of the Association of Heads of Independent Girls' Schools (AHIGS).

History
St Vincent's College was founded as the Victoria Street Roman Catholic School, by the Sisters of Charity in 1858, a year after the sisters established St Vincent's Hospital at the same site.

The school reopened as St Vincent's College, a secondary, fee-paying, private, independent school in May 1882, after the hospital's relocation to the neighbouring suburb of Darlinghurst.

In 2009, Mary Aikenhead Ministries (MAM) was established by the Holy See at the request of the Congregation of the Religious Sisters of Charity of Australia and the St Vincent's College was transferred to MAM.

In 2018, St Vincent's College celebrated its 160th anniversary and in 2019 its 135th year of boarding.
