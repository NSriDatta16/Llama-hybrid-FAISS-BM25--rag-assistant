Services
Line J utilises four-letter codes, called a mission code or the name of service. The four-letter code begins with a letter that designates the terminus of the station.

The first letter designates the train's destination.
 A: Argenteuil
 C: Conflans Sainte-Honorine
 E: Ermont-Eaubonne
 G: Gisors
 H: Houilles Carrières-sur-Seine
 J: Vernon
 K: Cormeilles-en-Parisis
 L: Les Mureaux
 M: Mantes-la-Jolie
 P: Paris Saint-Lazare
 T: Pontoise
 V: Vernon
 Y: Boissy-l'Aillerie

The second, third and fourth letters indicate the stations served by the train. Formerly, the second letter was used to designate the train type (I for express trains, A for semi-express trains, O for local trains), but this is no longer the case (but most all stops trains of Line J keep the O as the second letter). The third letter was also used to designate the route taken to the destination (for example C as a third letter indicates "via Conflans Sainte-Honorine"), but this is now abolished along with the second letter. Typically, mission codes or the name of services of line J have the following composition of , , ,  (, , , , , etc.) but only four codes follow the pattern of , , ,  (, ,  and ).
