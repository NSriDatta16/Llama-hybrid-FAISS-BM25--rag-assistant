Kilton is a village in the borough of Redcar and Cleveland and the ceremonial county of North Yorkshire, England. It is part of the civil parish of Lockwood.

History
The village is recorded in the Domesday Book as Chiltune, which is possibly derived from a combination of Old Norse and Old English of "narrow-valley farm/settlement' or a Scandinavianised form of cilda-tun, 'children's farm/settlement." The village is to the west of Kilton Beck Valley, a narrow cut that carries the Kilton Beck to the sea at Skinningrove. The remains of Kilton Castle lie to the south east and the village is  east of Guisborough and  south of Brotton.

In the 13th century, Kilton Castle was the base of the rebel Will Wither.
