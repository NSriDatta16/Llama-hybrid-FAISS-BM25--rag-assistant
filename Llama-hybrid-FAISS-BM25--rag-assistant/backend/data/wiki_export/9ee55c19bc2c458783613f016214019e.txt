"Just Once in My Life" is a song written by Gerry Goffin, Carole King and Phil Spector. The song was released by the Righteous Brothers in 1965 and reached No. 9 on the Billboard Hot 100.

The Righteous Brothers' original
After the success of the Righteous Brothers' first single with Phil Spector, "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'", the writers of the song Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil then wrote "(You're My) Soul and Inspiration" for them. The song however was not completed, and Spector instead asked Carole King to write a song for the duo, which turned out to be "Just Once in My Life".

The Righteous Brothers released their version as a single in April 1965 as the follow-up to "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'". Their second release on the Philles label, the single was another big hit, making the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100, reaching number nine.

Billboard described the song as "exciting, dramatic, emotion filled production performances by the "Lovin' Feeling" boys" which "can't miss."
