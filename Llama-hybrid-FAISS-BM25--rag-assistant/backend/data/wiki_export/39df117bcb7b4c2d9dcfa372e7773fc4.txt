A memorial was raised in 1909 to the Norwegian poet Aasmund Olavsson Vinje (1818-1870) at the western end of Bygdin at Eidsbugarden on the outskirts of Jotunheim National Park where he had a private hut. Friends and followers commemorated his contribution to appreciation of Norwegian nature and strengthening of the Norwegian national identity.
