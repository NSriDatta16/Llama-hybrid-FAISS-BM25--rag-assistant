Spreydon was constituted as a borough in 1911. It merged into the city of Christchurch in 1921.

History
Prior to European settlement, the Spreydon area was predominantly swampland connected to the nearby Ōpāwaho / Heathcote River, interspersed with fields of tussock. The area was first settled by Europeans in 1853, when 300 hectares of land bordering on Lincoln Road were purchased by Augustus Moore, who gave it the name Spreydon Farm. The origins of this name are disputed, with some claiming it refers to family land in Ireland and others that it is named after a place in Devonshire known to Moore. Moore farmed the land and ran a brewery and tavern, known as the Spreydon Arms, on his land along Lincoln Road until 1865, when he sold his property to William Sefton Moorhouse. A baptist church was soon established in the area, built out of a former sod house on land donated by a neighbouring farmer by Thomas Jefcoate. The church's congregation steadily grew as more people settled the area, and continues to operate to this day.

In 1911, the area was constituted as a borough with its own council to reflect the growing population of the area. By this point, the former property had been heavily subdivided with several large roads through the area. The borough continued for roughly a decade, before it was incorporated into the larger Christchurch City Council in 1921.
