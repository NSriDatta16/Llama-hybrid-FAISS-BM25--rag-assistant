Pooh's Heffalump Halloween Movie (also known as Pooh's Heffalump Halloween: The Movie) is a 2005 American direct-to-video animated fantasy adventure comedy film produced by Walt Disney Pictures and DisneyToon Studios, featuring the characters from Winnie the Pooh franchise and it was the sequel to Pooh's Heffalump Movie. This was the final Winnie the Pooh film to be produced by DisneyToon Studios before they moved to Tinker Bell films.

The film marked voice actor John Fiedler's final appearance as Piglet, as he died in two and a half months before the film's release. He died before completing his voice work, so Travis Oates was brought in to finish the remaining scenes (and received credit for "additional voices") and became Piglet's new official voice actor.

It was followed by a television film produced by Walt Disney Television Animation and Polygon Pictures, Pooh's Super Sleuth Christmas Movie, released on November 20, 2007, an animated feature based on the television series My Friends Tigger & Pooh.

Plot
It is Lumpy's first Halloween with Winnie the Pooh, Roo, and their friends in the Hundred Acre Wood. The group discusses their plans for Halloween and for their first night of trick-or-treating. Tigger tells his friends about the dreaded Gobloon, a monster that comes out every Halloween to search for somebody to catch and will turn them into "jaggedy lanterns" if he catches them, but if the Gobloon is captured first, it will grant its captors one wish; Rabbit does not believe such a creature exists. After Pooh accidentally eats all of the trick-or-treat candy Rabbit collected from the Hundred Acre Wood, Roo and Lumpy set out to capture the Gobloon to wish for more. According to Tigger's directions on the map, they are able to go past the Creepy Cave then down the Slimy Slide and into the Tree of Terror later on. Entering the Creepy Cave, Lumpy and his lunchbox get stuck on some rocks, which leads Lumpy to believe that they're being followed. He desperately wants to go back, but Roo insists that they should press on, and eventually they find the Slimy Slide, and then the Tree of Terror.

When Roo and Lumpy reach the supposed Gobloon's lair, Lumpy loses his courage to catch the Gobloon and wants to go home. So Roo tells him the story from Boo to You Too! Winnie the Pooh, when Piglet was afraid to go trick-or-treating, but gained his courage. Roo believes that if Piglet can conquer his fears, then so can Lumpy. An inspired Lumpy helps Roo set a trap for the Gobloon, but the two end up fleeing once they think the Gobloon is returning. After encountering and fleeing from a mysterious figure (which they think is the Gobloon), Lumpy gets separated from Roo and ends up stuck in the trap they had set for the Gobloon. Lumpy is heartbroken to be alone, as he and Roo had promised to stay together during the adventure. Roo finds a Jack-o'-lantern resembling Lumpy, which makes him think his friend has been caught by the Gobloon and turned into a jaggedy lantern.

Once back with the others, Roo recruits Pooh, Piglet, Tigger, Eeyore and Rabbit (whom were using vegetables after Pooh ate all the halloween candy) to help him capture the Gobloon (much to Rabbit's shock as he realizes that the Gobloon is real) and save Lumpy. The group arrives at the trap and believes the Gobloon is trapped, unaware that it is actually Lumpy. Roo wishes to have his friend Lumpy back, but becomes bitterly saddened when the "Gobloon" doesn't grant his wish. Hearing Roo's voice, Lumpy calls for him, but a loud thunder blocks it, prompting him to break his way out of the trap. Roo and Lumpy are happily reunited.

The group finally goes trick-or-treating and Kanga, who was the mysterious figure from earlier, throws a Halloween party for the friends and gives them candy, complete with Jack-o'-lanterns she had carved in everyone's likenesses. Lumpy's Jack-o'-lantern wasn't there, she explains she made one but must have accidentally dropped itâ€”which turns out to be the Jack-o'-lantern that Roo found. With Lumpy's first Halloween being successful, everyone from the Hundred Acre Wood enjoys the Halloween party.
