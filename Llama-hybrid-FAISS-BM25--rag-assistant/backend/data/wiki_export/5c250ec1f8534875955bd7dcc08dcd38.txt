Palo Santo is an album by Shearwater, released in 2006 on Misra Records. The album was re-released in an expanded, partly re-recorded, fully remastered and repackaged edition in 2007 on Matador Records. The album was inspired by the life and death of the singer Nico; Jonathan Meiburg mentions this on the album The Island Arc Live (Excerpts), in a recording from Shearwater's January 15, 2011, performance at Austin's Central Presbyterian Church.

Critical reception
The New York Times wrote that "this is one of the year's best indie-rock albums ... These 11 flickering — and hummable — songs tell a desperate but not quite decipherable story." NME called the album "both magnificent and bewildering," writing that "meandering piano and plucked banjo laments wind towards dramatic crescendos, songs fracture and split as if powered by dream logic."

All tracks composed by Jonathan Meiburg (except "Special Rider Blues").
