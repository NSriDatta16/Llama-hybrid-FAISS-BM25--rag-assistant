The Uncollected Wodehouse is a collection of early newspaper and magazine articles and short stories by P. G. Wodehouse. First published in the United States on October 18, 1976 by Seabury Press, New York City, it contains 14 short stories. Five of the stories had appeared in the United Kingdom in the 1914 collection The Man Upstairs, and all had previously appeared in UK periodicals between 1901 and 1915; some had also appeared in the U.S. Five short items are included from  1900–1906 UK magazines, ten from 1914–1919, and nine from the U.S. Vanity Fair magazine.

The collection was edited and introduced by David A. Jasen, with a foreword by Malcolm Muggeridge.

Contents 

 "When Papa Swore in Hindustani"
 United Kingdom: Answers, August 24, 1901
According to David A. Jasen, this was the first of multiple sentimental stories that Wodehouse wrote specifically to please magazine editors. Wodehouse did not approve of the title of the story, which was chosen by the Answers staff. The story is very short and is six pages long in the first edition of the collection. For comparison, "The Good Angel" is 15 pages long and "The Man Upstairs" is 16 pages long.
