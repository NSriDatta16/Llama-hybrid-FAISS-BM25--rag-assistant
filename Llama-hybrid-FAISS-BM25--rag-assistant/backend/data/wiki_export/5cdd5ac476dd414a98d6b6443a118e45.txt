Adult at 14 season is part of the 2003 autumn season on the UK television station Channel 4. The season looked into the lives of British teenagers and centred on issues such as sex and relationships and potential long-term consequences such as teenage pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections. It also supported the age of consent remaining at sixteen in order to protect vulnerable young people from abuse, but they campaigned for changes to the Sexual Offences Bill which, as it stands, will criminalise under 16s who engage in any form of consensual non-penetrative sexual activity.

14 Alone
