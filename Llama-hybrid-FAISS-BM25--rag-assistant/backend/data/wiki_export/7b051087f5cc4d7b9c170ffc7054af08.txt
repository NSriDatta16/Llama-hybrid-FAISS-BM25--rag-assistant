Plot
The Five Lucky Stars, one of them being replaced by a younger brother, are assigned by the police to allow an actress to live with them. The actress has information on a crime syndicate and assassins are sent after her. Ricky and Swordflower are to stay at the actressâ€™s home undercover to capture the assassins.  Throughout the course of the movie, the Stars chase the attractive woman around the house, though their efforts are largely unsuccessful. At the climax, the three assassins eventually end up at a recreation building to take down Swordflower (mistaking her to be their target), but coincidentally Kidstuff and his friends are there and they recognize one of them, with help from the actress.  Muscle and Ricky arrive in the nick of time and a showdown takes place, eventually ending with the protagonists victorious.  The police and a large ensemble of Chinese actors arrive to congratulate them.
