Michel-Ange–Molitor () is a station of the Paris Métro in the 16th arrondissement, serving as an interchange between Line 9 and Line 10 (eastbound only). It is named after the nearby rue Michel-Ange, which was in turn named after Michelangelo (the nearby Michel-Ange—Auteuil station was also named after him) as well as the nearby rue Molitor, which was named after Count Gabriel-Jean-Joseph Molitor (1770-1849), a Marshal of France.

History
The station opened on 30 September 1913 when Line 8 was extended from Charles Michels (then called Beaugrenelle) to Porte d'Auteuil. Line 9's platforms opened on 8 November 1922 with the opening of the initial section of the line from Trocadéro to Exelmans. On 27 July 1937, the section of line 8 between La Motte-Picquet–Grenelle and Porte d'Auteuil, including Michel-Ange–Molitor was transferred to line 10 during the reconfiguration of lines 8, 10, and the old line 14. However, service between Porte d'Auteuil and Jussieu was not provided until two days later, on July 29 , with service initially limited to La Motte-Picquet-Grenelle.

As part of the "Renouveau du métro" programme by the RATP, the station's corridors was renovated and modernised on 27 July 2010.
