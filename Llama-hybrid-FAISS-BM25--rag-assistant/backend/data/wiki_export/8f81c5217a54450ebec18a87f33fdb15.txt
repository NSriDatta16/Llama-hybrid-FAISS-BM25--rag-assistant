History
When Brockton High was founded, it could house only 125 students. As the population of Brockton grew, there was increasing demand for a larger building. In 1906, a new high school was constructed, consisting of an "A" building and a "B" building. By the 1960s, student numbers exceeded capacity, causing split sessions; upperclassmen and sophomores attended school at different times of the day. The sophomores attended in the afternoon while the upperclassmen took their classes in the morning. In 1965, the City Council Finance Committee approved an $8 million proposal to construct a new high school to accommodate the swelling student body. In 1965, the ground for the new building was broken and in 1970, the school was complete. The "A" building has since been torn down, and the "B" building housed a pre-K center and then charter and alternative school programs, and was torn down in fall 2023 to make way for a new public safety center. The current high school campus comprises nine buildings and is approximately the size of an aircraft carrier (1/3 mile long) and has  of floor space, about half the size of the Prudential Center in Boston. At one time, the highest number of students housed in the school was 4,250.

Nahyo M. Kim of The New York Times wrote that in a period around 10 years before 2010, Brockton High "was a case study in failure". At that time the school's unofficial motto was "students have a right to fail if they want". Around 1999 the school set up a reform plan, using the skill areas of reading, reasoning, speaking, and writing and using them in the school's curriculum. By 2001 student performance improved. Susan Szachowicz, the former principal, said that the school culture and large size was crucial to the school's turnaround. This occurred in a period when education advocates promoted small schools.

Campus
Brockton High School is set on a small urban campus comprising eight buildings including four main student academic buildings divided by colors (Green, Red, Azure, Yellow) a core connecting them all and a gym and fine arts building. The campus also features a turf football stadium, ice skating rink, 25-yard swimming pool, 1608-seat capacity auditorium, and four cafeterias in the respective buildings.

The current Brockton High School campus was advanced for its time when it first opened in 1970, for it featured a modern greenhouse, a planetarium, modern public address system, and a high-tech TV studio (redone in 2003.) There are currently plans underway for an expansion and renovation of the school, which would include a new state-of-the-art STEM building.

Academics
In 1999, 75% of its students failed Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS) mathematics examinations and 44% failed MCAS English examinations. Around that period, about 1/3 of students of each Brockton class dropped out. By 2001, student performance improved. Between 2000 and 2001, more students went from failing to passing at Brockton High than at any other school in Massachusetts.

In 2005, 98% of the senior class (850 students) graduated. In 2008 78% of the graduating senior class planned to pursue a college degree. In 2006, Brockton High School was a recipient of the National School Change Award. Brockton High School was one of 7 schools in the United States to receive this award. Out of the seven schools, there were only two high schools.

In 2008, Brockton students had a higher level of improvement on the English MCAS than 90% of the Massachusetts high schools. By 2010 it was one of the highest performing schools on the MCAS.
