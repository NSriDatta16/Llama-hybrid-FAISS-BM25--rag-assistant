The Taipei Arena () is a multi-purpose stadium in the capital Taipei, Taiwan, and it is operated by the Taipei Rapid Transit Corporation (TRTC). Built in 2005, the large multi-purpose stadium can accommodate major international sport events such as ice skating, ice hockey, gymnastics, handball, basketball, tennis, badminton, table tennis, indoor soccer, boxing, judo, karate, taekwondo and wrestling.

Building
It was designed by Archasia, an architectural firm based in Taipei, and Populous, a Kansas City, Missouri, design and architectural firm specializing in sports venues.
It is located at the site of the former Taipei Municipal Baseball Stadium (built in 1958, opened 1959, demolished 2000). The arena was opened on 1 December 2005.
The main arena has an adjustable floor space: its minimum floor space is 60m × 30m, and can be extended to 80m × 40m.

The Chinese Taipei Ice Hockey League (CTIHL) plays out of the auxiliary arena, which is a 60m × 30m ice skating rink.
The basement now houses two large gas turbine power generators to be used for the surrounding district during emergencies.

Taipei Arena Sky Screen

Taipei Arena Sky Screen was constructed in December 2006, on the outer glass wall of Taipei Arena.
It was the world's largest LED display at that time.

The screen is a long arc type outdoor dynamic display, featuring a built in light sensor that enables LED to adjust its own brightness according to ambient lighting. It was built by Optotech and currently operated by Nova Media. It is on 24 hours a day and 365 days a year, displaying mainly corporate advertisements, live coverage and visual creativity supplemented content.

The screen also engages its audience though cross-screen interactive events and applications.

Events
Since opening in 2005, the arena has held more art and cultural activities (such as live concerts) than sporting events, which it was originally designed and built for. These have included Disney on Ice, Cirque du Soleil, and Cats.
