Starchild is the sixth studio album by American R&B singer Teena Marie, released on November 11, 1984, by Epic Records. Following the relative commercial failure of her previous album, Robbery, Starchild became the highest-selling album of Marie's career.  It peaked at #9 on the US Black Albums chart and #31 on the Billboard Albums chart.  It was certified Gold by the RIAA on April 1, 1985.

The album's success was driven by lead single "Lovergirl" which become a major US hit, reaching #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and her only top 30 hit on that chart. Marie also received a nomination for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance for the single at the 27th Grammy Awards-her second nomination in that category.

The album was written and produced by Marie, with contributions from Leon Ware and Narada Michael Walden. The track "My Dear Mr. Gaye" is a tribute to Marvin Gaye, who had been fatally shot and killed by his father on April 1, 1984.

It was re-released by SoulMusic Records in 2012 as an Expanded Edition, containing 5 mixes as bonus tracks (see track listing below).
