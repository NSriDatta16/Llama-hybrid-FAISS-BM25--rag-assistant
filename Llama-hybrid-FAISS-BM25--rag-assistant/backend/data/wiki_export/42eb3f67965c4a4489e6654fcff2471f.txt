The Europäische Föderation Radiogesteuerter Automodelle (EFRA), better known in English as the European Federation of Radio Operated Model Automobiles, is the governing body of radio-controlled car racing in Europe.

History 

Setup in May 1973, EFRA's original members were France, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Switzerland and Yugoslavia. They established a set of rules which did was not approved by the British. After discussion, BRCA's Ron Moody withdrew their membership. The idea of organisation was to regulate radio-controlled car racing though Europe. Although each member country would retain their own governing body, EFRA would try to make homogenous rules which form the basis of most of the rules in each member country, and also for European championship racing.

EFRA was chosen as it could be adapted by a large number of each member counties languages. In English, for the British membership, European Federation Of Radio Operated Model Automobiles is what is used to define EFRA.
