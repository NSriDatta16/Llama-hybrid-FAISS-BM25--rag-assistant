The nagak (also called na, sora, or godong) is a wind-instrument made from a large seashell and played as a horn in Korean traditional music.  It produces only a single tone and is used primarily in the military procession music called daechwita. The mouthpiece of the nagak is made by making a hole in the pointed end of the conch, into which a mouthpiece is fitted. This instrument is first recorded as being used in Goryeo.

The shell used is that of a very large sea snail, Charonia tritonis, sometimes known as "Triton's trumpet". This shell is also used as a musical instrument in several other nations.
