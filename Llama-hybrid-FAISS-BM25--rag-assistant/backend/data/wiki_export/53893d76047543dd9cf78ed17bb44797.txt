History

The Alexander City schools were affected historically by desegregation efforts within Alabama. By the fall of 1970, the 31% minority student total of the public school system was distributed within the then-existing schools as follows: 
 Jim Pearson Elementary (Grades 1-2) total enrollment of 704 numbered 235 black and 469 other students. At the same time, the school had 9 black teachers and 21 other teachers on its 30-member faculty.
 Laurel Elementary (Grades 3-4) total enrollment of 652 numbered 213 black and 439 other students. At the same time, the school had 9 black teachers and 19 other teachers on its 28-member faculty.
 Russell Elementary (Grades 5-6) total enrollment of 662 numbered 200 black and 462 other students. At the same time, the school had 9 black teachers and 15 other teachers on its 24-member faculty.
 Alexander City Junior High (Grades 7-9) total enrollment of 1,102 numbered 369 black and 733 other students. At the same time, the school had 13 black teachers and 32 other teachers on its 45-member faculty.
 Benjamin Russell High (Grades 10-12) total enrollment of 806 numbered 204 black  and 602 other students. At the same time, the school had 9 black teachers and 35 other teachers on its 44-member faculty.

In 2005 the Alexander City Schools system was awarded district accreditation by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). All graduates of Benjamin Russell High School gain two years of tuition-free education through the Central Alabama Community College under the Gateway to Education Scholarship Program, which was awarded the National Civic Star Award by the American Association of School Administrators in 2007.

Policies

The district's dress code requires students to be neatly dressed, clean and well groomed. Boys' shirts must be tucked in, and shorts and skirts must be no shorter than 2 inches above the kneecap. Pants must cover the hips, and shoes must be worn.

Penalties for student misconduct include detention, in-school suspension, out-of-school suspension, Saturday school, alternative education program, and corporal punishment. The latter consists of a maximum of three licks administered in private to the student's buttocks with a wooden paddle. Parents who object to paddling may request an alternative punishment. No student is forced to submit to a paddling. Students may choose a spanking in lieu of suspension.
