Club career

Claudiu Niculescu was born in Slatina and started playing football at the youth club CSȘ Slatina, alongside Ionel Dănciulescu, Ionuț Luțu and Augustin Chiriță, being coached by Ion Pârvulescu. He started his senior career playing at Jiul IELIF Craiova in Divizia B, after which he played for one season at Drobeta-Turnu Severin in Divizia C, returning for the following one season and a half to play in Divizia B at Electroputere Craiova. Niculescu made his Divizia A debut on 1 March 1998, playing for Universitatea Craiova under Spanish coach José Ramón Alexanko in a 2–1 victory against Petrolul Ploiești in which he scored one goal. He spent three years and a half with The Blue Lions, scoring 41 goals in 93 Divizia A matches, appearing in two games without scoring from the 2000–01 UEFA Cup, also reaching two Cupa României finals. In 2001 he went to play for Dinamo București where in his first season he won the Divizia A title, being the second top-goalscorer of the league with 15 goals, as coaches Cornel Dinu and Marin Ion gave him 28 appearances. In 2002, shortly after scoring a spectacular goal from a free kick against goalkeeper Iker Casillas in a friendly which ended with a 5–2 loss against Real Madrid, Niculescu was transferred to Genoa in Serie B for a fee estimated by the Romanian press between €700.000 and €1 million. He spent only one year with The Griffin, being teammate with compatriots Adrian Mihalcea and Paul Codrea, making only 13 appearances in which he scored three goals as his stay there was affected by injuries, returning to Dinamo who agreed to pay the Genovese team €800.000 to get him back. In the first season, following his return to The Red Dogs, he helped them win The Double, contributing with 16 goals scored in the 28 league matches in which he was used by coach Ioan Andone, also scoring the second goal of the 2–0 victory in front of Oțelul Galați from the Cupa României final and giving his contribution to the elimination of Shakhtar Donetsk by scoring a goal in each leg of the 5–2 victory on aggregate from the UEFA Cup. In the 2004–05 season he scored 21 goals, sharing with Gheorghe Bucur the top-goalscorer of Divizia A title, forming a couple in Dinamo's offence with Ionel Dănciulescu, the Romanian press calling them the "N&D couple", a nickname inspired from the first letters of their family name and the Romanian pop band "N&D". Niculescu started the following season by scoring the final goal of the 3–2 victory against rivals Steaua București which helped the team earn for the first time in its history the Supercupa României, also Andone used him in the 2005–06 UEFA Cup campaign when the team eliminated Everton against whom he scored a goal in a historical 5–2 on aggregate, reaching the group stage where he defeated goalkeeper Fabien Barthez by scoring a goal from a 20 meters free kick in a 2–1 away loss in front of Olympique Marseille. In the 2006–07 season under the guidance of coach Mircea Rednic, Niculescu won another championship title with Dinamo and became the top-goalscorer of the league with 18 goals, four of these were scored in a 4–1 against rivals Rapid București and two in a 4–2 victory in a derby against Steaua București. With eight goals scored in the 2006–07 UEFA Cup, of which four were in the group stage against Beşiktaş, Club Brugge and a double in the 2–1 victory in front of Bayer Leverkusen for which he received a 10 in the Gazeta Sporturilor newspaper, Niculescu was the second best goal-scorer of the competition, having three less than Espanyol's Walter Pandiani, helping The Red Dogs reach the sixteenths-finals where they were eliminated by Benfica. In January 2008, Niculescu was transferred by Dinamo at MSV Duisburg for 700.000€, where he was teammate with fellow Romanians Mihai Tararache and Iulian Filipescu, playing 15 Bundesliga matches in which he scored 4 goals, but at the end of the season he was transferred in Cyprus at Omonia. In 2009 he returned for a third spell at Dinamo which lasted one year and a half, a period in which he helped the club fulfill "The wonder from Liberec" after winning with 3–0 the away game against Slovan Liberec, as the first leg was lost with the same score, qualifying after the penalty shoot-out to the group stage of the 2009–10 Europa League, afterwards going to play for two seasons at Universitatea Cluj where he ended his career. Claudiu Niculescu was a striker skilled in free kicks, being nicknamed "Lunetistul" (The Sniper) by the Romanian press and he is 11th in an all-time ranking for the goalscorers in Liga I, with 156 goals scored in 326 matches played, also with 43 games and 18 goals scored for Dinamo in European matches, he is the player with the most appearances and top scorer in European competitions for the club.
