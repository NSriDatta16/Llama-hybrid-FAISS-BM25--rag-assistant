Music video
A video for "Friday's Child" was directed by Dougal Wilson and inspired by Young's grandfather who swam in the Olympics. It depicts Young on his journey to ultimately becoming an Olympic Games swimmer. He is seen starting lessons with armbands and later with floats, then undertaking lifesaving lessons and doing time-trials with an instructor. At the second chorus he is seen taking part in a swimming race, which he wins. A representative for the Olympic Games is among the spectators and is seen holding a clipboard, which the camera zooms into paperwork on the clipboard bearing the question "Good enough for Olympics?" to which the 'yes' box is ticked. He later becomes the new Olympic champion when representing England at swimming in the Olympic Games. The last shots of the video depict him on the podium with a gold medal at the Olympics and later swimming the English Channel and being presented with a medal for his efforts.
