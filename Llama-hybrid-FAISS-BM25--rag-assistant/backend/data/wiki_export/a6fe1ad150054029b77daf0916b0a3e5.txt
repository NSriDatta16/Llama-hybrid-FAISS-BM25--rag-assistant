Hell Songs is the second studio album by American rock band Daughters, released on August 8, 2006, through Hydra Head Records. Despite keeping the band's earlier mathcore sound, there is virtually none of Marshall's screaming vocals featured on the album that were prominent on Daughters' previous two releases.
