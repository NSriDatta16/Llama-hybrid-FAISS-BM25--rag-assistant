"Made It Back" is a song by Beverley Knight, released as the first single from her second studio album, Prodigal Sista. It was also the first single Knight released on EMI controlled Parlophone Records after she signed a four album deal with the label in 1997 after disagreements with her previous label, Dome Records. The release instantly proved that Knight had made the right decision after it entered the UK Singles Chart at #21 – her highest charting single up to that point. Featuring US rap star Redman, the song was nominated for Best Single at the 1998 MOBO Awards in London, which Knight lost out on to Another Level's "Freak Me". However, Knight went on to win Best R&B Act.

Made It Back 99

"Made It Back 99" is a remixed version of the first single from the Beverley Knight's second studio album, Prodigal Sista. The song, released in April 1999, was the first to be taken from a re-packaged version of the album. Made It Back 99 contained the same lyrics and vocals of the original release, but instead featured a more funk/R&B induced production provided by TNT and Mike Spencer, who introduced a sample of Chic's "Good Times" into the song. The single became Knight's first top 20 single in the United Kingdom when it peaked at #19 upon its release. It was supported by a re-released version of Prodigal Sista, which contained the single and two other remixes. A second promotional video was also created, but like the original, did not feature Redman.
