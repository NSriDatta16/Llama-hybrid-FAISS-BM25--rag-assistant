Dulce Beat (English: Sweet Beat) is the second studio album by Mexican electropop band Belanova, released in Mexico on June 21, 2005. Recorded between 2004 and 2005 in Buenos Aires, Argentina and Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico; the album was produced by Cachorro López and was written by the band's lead singer, Denisse Guerrero.

It was promoted through radio shows and concerts in Argentina, Chile and the United States, where the band, along with Mach & Daddy, played a joint concert in Los Angeles in front of 50,000 people. Becoming Belanova's most successful album, Dulce Beat was a commercial and critical success, reaching number-one and ensuring double platinum in Mexico. In 2006, the album was reissued as Dulce Beat 2.0 in several other countries across the world, including Chile, Spain, Argentina, and the United States. 

Singles from the album became massive hits, with "Me Pregunto" and "Por Ti" becoming the band's second and third number-one singles in Mexico consecutively. Further singles, "Rosa Pastel" and "Niño" became top five hits, the latter spending almost fifty weeks inside the chart and becoming a viral hit on TikTok in 2023.

On August 12, 2006, E! Latin America, aired a TV special of Belanova, with interviews and making of the album.
