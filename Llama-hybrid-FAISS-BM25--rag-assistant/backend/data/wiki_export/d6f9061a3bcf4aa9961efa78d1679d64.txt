The Hostosian National Independence Movement (, MINH) is a political organization in Puerto Rico.  In 2015, Julio Muriente was its leader.

History
The MINH was formed on May 6, 2004, by a merger of the National Hostosian Congress (CNH) and the New Puerto Rican Independence Movement (NMIP). The two groups that formed the MINH were organizational descendants of the Puerto Rican Socialist Party (PSP). The organization's name and ideology are based on the tradition of Eugenio María de Hostos, a historical independence advocate. The official organ of the MINH is Red Betances and the newspaper "El Hostosiano".

It was an organizational observer of the Non-Aligned Movement.

Organization
As of 2017 Héctor Pesquera was one of its co-presidents.

The organization also reportedly has a "radical youth wing".

Recent Events

In 2016, MINH (via Wilma Reverón) denounced the collection of DNA samples from 3 independentist militants.
