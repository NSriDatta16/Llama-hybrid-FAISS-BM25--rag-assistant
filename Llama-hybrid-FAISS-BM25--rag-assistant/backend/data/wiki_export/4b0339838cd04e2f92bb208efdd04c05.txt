In 1999, they were signed by East West Records and, in 2000, released their debut album, Invisible Science. Invisible Science garnered four award nominations from the East Coast Music Association: Pop/Rock Recording of the Year in 2001 and, in 2002, the single "Invisible Science" brought nominations for Recording of the Year, Song of the Year and Group Recording of the Year. Asif Illyas was nominated for Songwriter of the Year.

Also in 1999, Mir launched its annual event, The MIR Supershow, a 25-band concert that celebrates and raises money for the Centre For Diverse Visible Culture.

That year, the band's song "State of Emergency" was included in the compilation album The Great Stupa, along with songs by artists such as Joni Mitchell, Sting and Leonard Cohen.

In 2004, Mir released their second album, 7 Directions. At the 2005 East Coast Music Awards, the album received nominations for Rock Recording of the Year and Video of the Year.

In 2006, Mir released The Acoustic Record, which brought them to the attention of Germany's Silversonic Records, who signed them to a deal to promote an album which combined songs from The Acoustic Record and 7 Directions. The deal also included another European tour. At the 2006 East Coast Music Awards, The Acoustic Record brought nominations for Alternative Recording of the Year and Group Recording of the Year.
