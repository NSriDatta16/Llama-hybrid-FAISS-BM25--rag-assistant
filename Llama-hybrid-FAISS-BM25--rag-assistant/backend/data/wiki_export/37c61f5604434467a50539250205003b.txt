The tunica albugine is a dense, blue-white layer of fibrous tissue surrounding the testis. It is the middle of three enveloppes forming the capsule of the testis; it is deep to the visceral layer of tunica vaginalis, and superficial to the tunica vasculosa testis (vascular layer of testis).

The connective tissue of the tunica albuginea testis extends into the substance of the testis to form fibrous partitions - the septa testis. At the posterior aspect of the testis (where the serosa of testis is deficient to allow for the attachment of the epididymis), the tunica albuginea extends into the testis to form the mediastinum testis.

Anatomy 
It is thicker than the tunica albuginea of the ovary.

Histology 
It is composed of bundles of white fibrous connective tissue (from which it derives its name albuginea) which interlace in every direction.
