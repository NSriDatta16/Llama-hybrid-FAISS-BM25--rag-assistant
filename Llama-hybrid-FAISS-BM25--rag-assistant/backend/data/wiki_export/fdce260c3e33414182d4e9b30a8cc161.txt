Professional career

New York Jets

In 1999, he started 9 games (8 at right tackle and one at left tackle) and was lost for the season after suffering a torn anterior cruciate ligament, in the ninth game against the New England Patriots. In 2000, he became the starter at left tackle and helped the offensive line tie a league low 20 sacks allowed on the season. He remained in that role and didn't miss a game for the next 4 seasons.

In 2005, he was moved to right tackle after struggling on the left side. He started 9 games before he was placed on the injured reserve list with a torn chest muscle. On February 22, he was released for salary cap reasons.

Dallas Cowboys
