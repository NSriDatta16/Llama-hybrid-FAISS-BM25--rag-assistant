Early life
John Shaffer Phipps, who was known as "Jay", was born on August 11, 1874, in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, to Henry Phipps (1839–1930) and Anne Childs Shaffer (1850–1934).

His father was the son of English born parents who emigrated to Philadelphia in the early part of the 19th century before settling in Pittsburgh in 1845.  His father became an entrepreneur known for his business relationship with Andrew Carnegie and involvement with the Carnegie Steel Company.

His siblings were Amy Phipps (1872–1959), who married Frederick Edward Guest (1875–1937), Helen Margaret Phipps (1876–1934), who married Bradley Martin, Henry Carnegie Phipps (1879–1953), who married Gladys Livingston Mills (1883–1970), and Howard Phipps (1881–1981), who married Harriet Dyer Price.

Estates
John Phipps amassed almost  of rolling Virginia farm lands in The Plains, Virginia, including Brenton, an 1889 stone manor house. He was a polo player and Thoroughbred racehorse owner, and the property assembled from 1928 onwards would be the site of his Rockburn Stud farm. Upon his death it passed to his son Hubert.

Phipps purchased an old  Quaker farm on Long Island where he built a large mansion with magnificent gardens that, following his death, became a non-profit organization that today is known as Old Westbury Gardens and is open to the public.

In the 1920s he purchased several large properties in West Palm Beach, Florida, including one that was once used as a pineapple plantation.  He subdivided the property and turned it into the three largest subdivisions containing luxury residential homes in what is now the El Cid Historic District.  John Phipps built a home for himself he called "Casa Bendita."  A large oceanfront mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, it was designed in 1921 by architect Addison Mizner. Today, the property is occupied by his granddaughter, Susan Phipps Cochran, and her husband.
