The Delhi or Dilli Gharana, is a tabla discipleship tradition known for being the oldest. This tradition was founded by Sidhar Khan Dhadi in the early-18th Century. The tradition is regarded for establishing a distinction from pakhawaj repertoire, "do ungliyon ka baaj" (two-finger style), and contributing improvisation conventions like peshkar and kayada. Heirs of this gharana went on to establish other traditions like Lucknow gharana, Ajrada gharana, and Farukhabad gharana.

History

Origins
Delhi Gharana was founded by Dadi in the early-18th Century. Sometimes referred to as the inventor of the tabla, Sidhar Khan Dhadi is the earliest available name associated with tabla in historical records. He was initially a pakhawaj player from the tradition of Lala Bhavanidas.

Aesthetics

Technique
Considered a moderately resonant style (like Ajrada), the Delhi gharana is classified with the "bandh baaj" (closed style) rather than the "khula baaj" (open style) of Punjab and Farukhabad.

Repertoire
Delhi gharana is reputed for its vast repertoire of kayadas.

Musicality
Delhi gharana values sound quality that:
 Avoids overuse of the Bayan.
 Light, precise strokes (bols).
 Soft and esoteric temperament and style of playing.
 Strokes like "dha," "tita," "tirakita," and "tinakena" are prominent.

Legacy
Sidhar Khan Dhadi and his descendants contributed greatly to the development of the tabla language, compositional structures of the peshkars and kayadas. Many compositions from this school are standard and introductory repertoire taught to students of all tabla gharanas.
