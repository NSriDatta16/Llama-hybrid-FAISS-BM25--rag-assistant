ManiaTV is a digital television network that produces, packages and distributes premium live celebrity TV shows for the 13-34 youth/young adult market. According to comScore, ManiaTV reaches over 10 million viewers each month. It was founded by Drew Massey.

History
ManiaTV Network launched in 2004 as the world's first Internet television network. In early 2008, ManiaTV moved to Los Angeles, California, from its original base of operations in Denver, Colorado. The move was to place the company closer to the talent and partnerships in the entertainment industry. The new home included a production house with sound stage, allowing many of the shows to be filmed in-house.

The company has worked with every major advertising agency delivering branded entertainment before the term branded entertainment existed. Nearly 100 different advertisers have worked with ManiaTV.

In March 2009, the company was unable to renegotiate a credit facility with Comerica.

On July 10, 2009, the New York Times announced that the founder of ManiaTV, Drew Massey, who had retired to Chairman two years earlier, had raised additional money to buy out the company and relaunch with a focus exclusively on celebrity TV shows. TV veteran Warren Littlefield joined the new company board.
