History

KMMD signed on as K03HB on January 5, 1993. The station was later granted Class A status in 2003.

On September 25, 2006, KMMD switched to the new MTV Tr3́s network (now simply known as Tr3́s since July 2010), which was created as a result of Viacom's acquisition of Mas Musica.

The station's digital signal was licensed as KMMD-LD on January 20, 2010, and received the Class A designation on September 28, 2011, with its call sign changing to KMMD-CD.

On October 3, 2011, the station surrendered its analog license to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC); the FCC cancelled the license and deleted the KMMD-CA call sign.
