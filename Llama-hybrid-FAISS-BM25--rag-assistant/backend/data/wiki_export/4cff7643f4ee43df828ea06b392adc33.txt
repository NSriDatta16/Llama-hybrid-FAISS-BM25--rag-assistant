Middle schools

Grades 5–6 

These middle schools were created with the intention of adjusting elementary students to high school.  The schools use a "team-teaching" approach wherein students will have a classroom to which they are assigned, and the entire class will move to a different room for different classes such as science, math, or social studies.  While the students stay with their same class, they experience changing teachers and changing classes for the first time.

Grades 7–8

Ryan Gloyer Middle School 

Ryan Gloyer Middle School (RGMS), previously known as Seneca Valley Middle School, serves all students within the district and is located on the main campus in Harmony. The address of the school is 122 Seneca School Road.

The middle school is set up to adjust students further into high school life. While students freely change classes as in an American high school, five of their eight daily classes are all with teachers who teach on a team. These five teachers teach the same set of students on a "team" so that students will have classes with the same group of students and not have to deal with stresses on the same day, missing many classes for field trips, and so on. These teams also act as a microcosm of the high school atmosphere, instilling their own 'team spirit' on students and hosting team parties.

The school offers a choir program, a student band, an option to learn foreign languages, classes in performing arts, and classes in various mediums of design. Eighth grade students are required to take fourteen weeks of two different home economics courses and twenty-two weeks of three different industrial shop classes.

The Seneca Valley Middle School was renamed in 2018 in honor of Sgt. 1st Class Ryan A. Gloyer, graduating class of 2000, who died courageously in battle in 2016.

High schools 
The middle school, intermediate high school, and senior high school are located together on one main, inner-city campus in Harmony.

The high schools are part of an 'open campus' system wherein students may on occasion have a class in a building they are not assigned to by grade and must walk to their class in the other building.

Mascot
