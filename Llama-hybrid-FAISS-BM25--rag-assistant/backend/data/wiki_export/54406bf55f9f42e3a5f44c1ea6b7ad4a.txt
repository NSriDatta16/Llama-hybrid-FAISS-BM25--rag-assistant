The Sindh Regiment (, ) (previously Sind Regiment) is an infantry regiment of the Pakistan Army established on 1 July 1980. The regiment takes its name from Sindh province in southern Pakistan. Prior to its formation there had been no regiment in the Pakistan Army specifically intended to recruit primarily from the Sindhi population. The regimental centre is located in Hyderabad, Sindh, Pakistan.

History 
Since independence in 1947, the Pakistan Army had been dominated by Punjabis, with as much as 77% of army personnel. A specific regiment was created to address concerns of underrepresentation of Sindhis. This was done by the transfer of eleven battalions from the Punjab Regiment and ten battalions from the Baloch Regiment. An additional seven battalions were raised in the period from 1988 to 1999 while another Baluch battalion was transferred in 1988. Further raisings between 2001 and 2019 brought total strength of the regiment to 33 battalions.

Uniform 
The regimental badge depicts crossed Sindhi axes surmounted by the star and crescent appearing above a title scroll in Urdu. All ranks wear a cherry pink beret with a red plume hackle.

Commanders 
Previous colonel-commandants of the regiment have included Lieutenant General Salim Haider, who has served as the commander of I (Strike) Corps, Mangla, and as the Master-General of Ordnance (MGO).
