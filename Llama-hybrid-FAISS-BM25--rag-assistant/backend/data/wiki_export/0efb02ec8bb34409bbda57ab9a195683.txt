History
Before the start of the 2007–08 season, the stadium was known as "het Fenixstadion". However, early 2007 Racing Genk signed an agreement with the Alken-Maes brewery to lease the name of the stadium for a 5-year period changing the name to Cristal Arena. In 2016, the name was changed to Luminus Arena, named after Belgian company Luminus, the new stadium sponsor, who signed a four-year deal for the naming rights. In 2021, the name was changed to CegekA Arena, named after the Belgian IT company, the new stadium sponsor, who signed a ten-year deal for the naming rights.

The Belgium national football team played two games at this venue in 2009, a friendly against Slovenia and a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Bosnia and Herzegovina, which they lost 2–4.

On 20 November 2018, Italy played a friendly against the United States, and won by a 94-minute goal from Matteo Politano.
