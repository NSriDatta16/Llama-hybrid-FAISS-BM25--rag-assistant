Three rivers cross the area: the Paranaíba, the Corumbá, and the Veríssimo, which have potential for the installation of hydroelectric plants. There is a waterfall—Cachoeira do Rio Veríssimo—and the waters of the enormous artificial lake of Itumbiara, formed by the Paranaíba.

History
The history of Corumbaíba has its roots in a legend. According to popular belief there lived a white wolf in the region, called Galga. It used to howl frequently. Whoever saw this wolf would have good luck. Manoel Cândido das Neves, an important rancher in the region, allegedly saw the wolf and, thanking his luck, had a chapel built in the name of Bom Jesus da Cana Verde. The settlement began around this chapel. Manoel Cândido donated a large area for the town to be built. The village was first called Arraial dos Cupins and later Arraial dos Paulistas. In 1909 it was called Vila Corumbaíba, because it was bathed by the Corumbá and the Paranaíba rivers. In 1912 it became a municipality, separating from Catalão. Source: Sepin
