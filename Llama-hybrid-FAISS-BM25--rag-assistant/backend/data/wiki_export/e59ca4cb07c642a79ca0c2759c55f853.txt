A huerta () or horta (, ), from Latin hortus, "garden", is an irrigated area, or a field within such an area, common in Spain and Portugal, where a variety of vegetables and fruit trees are cultivated for family consumption and sale. Typically, individual huertas belong to different people; they are located around rivers or other water sources because of the amount of water required, which is usually provided through small canals (acequias). They are a kind of market garden.

Alternate definitions
Elinor Ostrom has defined huertas as "well-demarked irrigation areas surrounding or near towns" (emphasis added).
