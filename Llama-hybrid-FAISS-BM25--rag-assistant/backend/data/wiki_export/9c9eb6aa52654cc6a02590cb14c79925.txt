The Borderland Thunder are a defunct Junior "A" ice hockey team from Fort Frances, Ontario, Canada.  They were a part of the Superior International Junior Hockey League.

History
Despite four successful season in the SIJHL and a league title, the Thunder have opted to sit on the sidelines of Canadian Junior hockey.  Although they still had an open door to re-enter the Thunder Bay-based league, they have applied the past three seasons for entry into the Manitoba Junior Hockey League .

A return to the SIJHL is unlikely for the Borderland Thunder, as their place in the SIJHL has since been succeeded by the Fort Frances Jr. Sabres as of the 2007â€“08 season.
