County Route 554 (CR 554) is a county highway in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The highway extends  from Barnegat Boulevard (Route 72) to Main Street (U.S. Route 9 or USÂ 9) in Barnegat Township.  The highway was designated as the easternmost segment of CR 532 in the early 1950s and was later a portion of CR 534, but as it had no connection to the western segment, it was renamed by 1984.
