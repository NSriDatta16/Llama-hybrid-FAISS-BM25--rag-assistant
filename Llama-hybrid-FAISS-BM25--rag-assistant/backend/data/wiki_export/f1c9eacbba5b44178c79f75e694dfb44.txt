Sigdal Museum
Sigdal Museum is a folkmuseum for the districts of Sigdal, Modum and Krødsherad.
The museum  comprises 13 buildings, mainly farmhouses, grouped together as examples of the rural life of the past. During summer, visitors experience activities relating to traditional crafts and shows. A building, opened in 1978, houses a fine collection of regional costumes, from the 1800s to the present day. Sigdal Museum is situated on the grounds of the former Sigdal Nickel Works, which was in operation from 1874 until 1879.

Lauvlia
Norwegian artist Theodor Kittelsen settled near Prestfoss during 1899.  Kittelsen was one of the most popular artists in Norway, mostly because of his fairy tale drawings and evocative paintings of people and trolls, animals and landscapes. Lauvlia, his former home, is located north of Prestfoss along Route Fv287.  The surrounding area, with scenic view of Lake Soneren and Andersnatten which overlooks the lake, inspired some of Kittelsen's most famous landscapes.

Today Lauvlia is a private museum featuring an exhibition of Kittelsen's original work. Lauvlia is decorated with Kittelsen's own woodcarvings and murals. A new exhibition of original Kittelsen works is opened each year with painting and drawing activities arranged for children. The paintings exhibited are rotated each year.
