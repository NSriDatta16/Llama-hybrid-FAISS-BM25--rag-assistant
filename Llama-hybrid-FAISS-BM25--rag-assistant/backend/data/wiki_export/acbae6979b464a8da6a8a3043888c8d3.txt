Seoul National University Station is a station on Seoul Subway Line 2, located in Bongcheon-dong, Gwanak-gu of southern Seoul. This station is also known as Gwanak-gu Office Station. There are eight exits, two at each corner of the crossroads – of Nambu Beltway (Nambusunhwan-ro) and Gwanak-ro – where the station lies beneath.

Seoul National University Station has one curved island platform, which is wide in the middle and narrow at both ends. The platform screen doors were installed for both tracks by 2006. Escalators are available between the platform and the waiting/ticketing area. Despite being named the Seoul National University Station, Seoul National University is actually approximately  south of the station; it typically takes more than thirty minutes to reach the university on foot from the station.

In The Amazing Race 4, teams had to find this station (which was labeled only as Station 228) to obtain the next route marker.
