Beaverton High School (often referred to as The Beaverton High School) is a public high school located in Beaverton, Oregon, United States. It is the oldest high school in Beaverton and is believed to be the oldest public high school in the state of Oregon that is in its original location and building. Beaverton High School contains grades 9â€“12.

History
In 1875, the original schoolhouse opened on land between Canyon Road and Broadway Street. It was called Beaverton Public School.

In 1902, a ninth grade class was added, followed by a 10th grade class in 1910 and an 11th grade class in 1915. 

In 1915, voters approved a $21,000 bond to construct a 21-room high school building on land south of Second Street between Stott Street and Erickson Street.

On June 19, 1916, the city of Beaverton dedicated the new Beaverton High School. Construction costs totaled $20,778, according to the Beaverton Times newspaper. 

In 1937, a new school called Beaverton Grade School was built just southeast of Beaverton High School by the Works Progress Administration. In 1948, the building would be renamed Merle Davies School to honor a longtime teacher and principal. In 1983, the Merle Davies building became a classroom annex to Beaverton High School. In 2006, it was shut down for renovation and reopened in September 2010 as additional classrooms.

In 1979, the school's auditorium burned down.

In 2020, parts of the school caught on fire. There was permanent and non-permanent damage to multiple classrooms in the main building.

In 2022, voters passed a large-scale $723 million bond measure which includes the funds to rebuild Beaverton High School. Construction is scheduled to begin in summer 2024. Because there is no viable swing school, students will attend school on site during construction. The new building will be located on the grass field along SW Famington Road. Once the new school is completed, the old one will be torn down and replaced with a parking lot. The rebuilt school is slated to open in the fall 2027 and will accommodate about 1500 students.

Academics
In 1985, Beaverton High School was honored in the Blue Ribbon Schools Program, the highest honor a school can receive in the United States.

In 2008, 75% of the school's seniors received a high school diploma. Of 521 students, 390 graduated, 99 dropped out, five received a modified diploma, and 27 were still in high school in 2009.

The school has classes in Spanish, Japanese, and French languages, and elective class pathways in marketing, engineering, digital media, and health.
