Skeezer Pleezer is the second album by the American musical group UTFO, released in 1986 on Select Records. The most notable song was "Split Personality," a paean to dissociative identity disorder. The album was produced by Full Force.

Critical reception

Robert Christgau praised the "cheerfully amoral anticrime versifying of 'Just Watch'."

The Rolling Stone Album Guide opined that "the attempts at singing ... are flat-out disasters." AllMusic noted that UTFO "were essentially already in stylistic retreat as the gimmick tag they picked up for the success of 'Roxanne, Roxanne' was proving difficult to shake."
