History 
One of the first five original channels of Star TV, Star Chinese Channel was launched on 21 October 1991 at 16:30 Hong Kong Time as STAR TV Chinese Channel, the channel originally targeted audiences in Greater China, broadcasting in both Mandarin and Cantonese. Star Chinese Channel was launched as a 24-hour Mandarin Chinese variety entertainment channel that the channel showcased full Chinese language content provided by ATV in Hong Kong broadcasting from Mainland China; also showed television series from other Greater China countries including China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and Singapore. It was also the first commercial broadcasting-owned channel to broadcast in Taiwan. It was a free-to-air channel, but at some point, Star TV encrypted the channel. The channel was previously broadcast across Greater China, but on 30 March 1996 at 19:00 Hong Kong Time, Star TV split STAR TV Chinese Channel by certain areas and reduced its broadcasting area to just Taiwan (Viewers in Greater China apart from Taiwan were offered Phoenix Chinese Channel instead).

At one point, the channel's business was moved from British Hong Kong to Taipei in 1997.

Shiau Hong-chi says that the original business for Star TV was to broadcast popular American shows to Taiwanese audience with as less effort as possible. Shiau then argues that however the plan was unsuccessful and Star TV had to invest on localized branches such as Chinese Channel and Channel V Taiwan and make local shows.
