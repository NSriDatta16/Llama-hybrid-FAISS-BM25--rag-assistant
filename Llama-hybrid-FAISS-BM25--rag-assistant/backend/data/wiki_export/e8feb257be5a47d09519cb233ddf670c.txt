New Kids on the Block is the debut studio album from American pop boy band New Kids on the Block released in 1986. The album failed to garner any attention at the time of its release.  In August 1989, during the success of their second album, Hangin' Tough, Columbia Records released the New Kids on the Block track "Didn't I (Blow Your Mind)" as a single, in an attempt to bring this album to the attention of the group's growing fan-base. As a result, album sales spiked, causing it to be released outside the United States around the same time. Subsequently, the New Kids on the Block album would eventually be certified 3× Platinum by the RIAA, peaking at number 25 on the US Billboard 200.
