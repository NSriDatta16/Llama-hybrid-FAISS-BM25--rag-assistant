The Volvo Tundra was a concept car built and designed by Bertone in 1979. Bertone's design prompt was to do "something delicious" based on the Volvo 343. The angular design was by Marcello Gandini, and continued the themes developed for the Lamborghini Silhouette and the Reliant (Anadol) FW11. It was rejected by Volvo, who considered the design too modern and deemed it difficult to market.

It is often misreported that Bertone instead sold a very similar design to Citroën, where it was produced as the Citroën BX from 1982 to 1994. However, this would have meant Citroën turned a concept into a series production model in less than 18 months. The relationship is simply that the two designs appeared from the same design house.

The Tundra's rear-side window had a pulled-down top edge, an idea that was also seen on the BX C-pillar. The effect was of a floating roof, a design idea that would become popular in the 2010s. 

The car featured a digital speedometer and was powered by a 1.4-litre, four-cylinder engine, giving .
