Borena (Oromo: Boorana) is a zone in Oromia Region of Ethiopia. Borena is named after  one of the two major subgroups of the Oromo People. Borena is bordered on the south by Kenya, on the west by the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples Region, on the north by West Guji and Guji and on the east by Dawa Zone Somali Region. The highest point in this zone is Mount Dara Tiniro. Cities and major towns in this Zone include Negele Borana, Moyale, Yabelo, Dubuluk, Mega, Millami, Surupa and Bakke.

History 
The Borena Zone was created shortly after the adoption of the 1995 Constitution of Ethiopia and the creation of the Oromia Region. In September 2003, the upland woredas were separated from Borena to create the Guji Zone. Since then many of the remaining woredas have been reorganized to create new ones.

This Zone was selected by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development in 2004 as one of several areas for voluntary resettlement for farmers from overpopulated areas; no specific woredas were identified in this program. Borena became the new home for a total of 9145 heads of households and 45,725 total family members.

Drought conditions in Borana in 2006 have increased tensions between the Borana and Guji clans from 22 May, and spiraled into violence a week later. Clan elders were able to restore peace, but only after 10 days of fighting in which between 100 and 150 people were killed and left thousands displaced.

Borena National Park covers much of Borena Zone. The park was created in 2017 from the former Borena Controlled Hunting Area.

The exclusive exploration rights would cover the next three years while the companyâ€™s estimated spending during this period will be 10 million dollars.
