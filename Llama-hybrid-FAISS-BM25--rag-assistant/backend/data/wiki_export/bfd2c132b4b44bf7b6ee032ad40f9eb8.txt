Their first Miss USA victory was in 1990, and notable because Carole Gist was the first African-American to win the title. Following in her footsteps, Kenya Moore, also African-American, won the title in 1993. In 2010, Michigan's Rima Fakih became the first Arab-American to win the title. The most recent placement was Elizabeth Johnson in 2018, placed in top 15.
