The 1993–94 UEFA Cup was won by Internazionale on aggregate over Austria Salzburg. Juventus were the defending champions, but got eliminated in the quarter-finals by Cagliari.

Eastern Europe arrangements
Political revolutions in Eastern Europe imposed some UEFA decisions. Yugoslavia was banned under United Nations embargo: its places were divided between former USSR, Romania, and former Czechoslovakia. An agreement between UEFA, Russia and Ukraine recognized Russia as heir of the three Soviet places, while Ukraine divided with Slovenia the heritage of disbanded East Germany. Albania was declared unsafe and it was substituted by a third club from Scotland. Poland was disqualified after its football scandal, and its places went to Hungary and Bulgaria.

Note: three clubs entered in the competition for former Czechoslovakia. However, their records and results were awarded to their new countries, Slovakia and the Czech Republic.
