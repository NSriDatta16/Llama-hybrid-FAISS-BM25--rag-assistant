Andrzej Stanisław Kostka Załuski (2 December 1695 – 16 December 1758) was a priest (bishop) in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

In his religious career he held the posts of abbot and later Bishop of Płock (from 1723), bishop of Łuck (1736), Bishop of Chełmno (1739) and Bishop of Cracow (1746).  He was a supporter of the Jesuits in Poland.

A member of the Polish nobility (szlachta) of the Junosza coat of arms, he also held the position of the Great Crown Chancellor from 1735 to 1746. As a politician he was engaged in the movement that wanted to reform the failing political system of the Commonwealth.

He studied in Danzig and Rome.

Załuski was a corresponding member of Societas eruditorum incognitorum in terris Austriacis, the first learned society in Habsuburg Austria.

He is perhaps most famous as co-founder (together with his brother Józef Andrzej Załuski, bishop of Kiev) of Załuski Library, one of the largest 18th-century collections of books in the world. He also sponsored the seminary in Pułtusk.
