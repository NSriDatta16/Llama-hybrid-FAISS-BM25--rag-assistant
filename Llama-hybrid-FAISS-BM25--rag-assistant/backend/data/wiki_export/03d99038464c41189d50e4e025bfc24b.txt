Hungarian Catholics, like elsewhere, are part of the worldwide Catholic Church under the spiritual leadership of the Pope in Rome.

According to a 2019 survey by Eurobarometer, 62% of Hungarians consider themselves Catholics. The Latin Church in the country is divided into 12 dioceses, including 4 archdioceses. In addition, there is a Latin territorial abbey and a separate sui juris particular Church for those who adhere to the Byzantine Rite known as the Hungarian Greek Catholic Church.
