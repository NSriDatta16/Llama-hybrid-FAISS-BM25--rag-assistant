Upkar () is a 1967 Indian Hindi film directed by Manoj Kumar. The film held the top spot at the box office in 1967 and was the highest-grossing movie of the year. It was Manoj Kumar's directorial debut film. Upkar was highly acclaimed, winning Filmfare Awards awards for best film, best director, best story, best dialog, and best lyrics.  

The film was inspired by India's prime minister, Lal Bahadur Shastri, who suggested that Kumar make a film based on his motto for India, "Jai Jawan Jai Kisan"  (English: "Hail the Soldier, Hail the Farmer"). Set in the backdrop of a Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, Upkar celebrates village life and the contributions of farmers and soldiers to India. It stars Prem Chopra, Asha Parekh, Kamini Kaushal, Pran, and Madan Puri.

Plot 
A village man, Bharat (Manoj Kumar), sacrifices everything for his brother's education. The brother, Puran, goes to study in the city and becomes attracted to the high-society lifestyle. When Puran returns to the village, he is a selfish man and wants to sell his share of the family's property. Bharat is unwilling to divide the property and transfers the disputed land to Puran's son.

When the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 begins, Bharat joins the fight. With the help of his greedy uncle Charandas and some partners, Puran tries to profit by hoarding and selling grains on the black market. Puran eventually discovers Charandas' plan to separate the two brothers. Ridden with guilt and shame, Puran surrenders to the police.

Bharat fights bravely in the war but is captured by the enemy. He escapes but is badly injured and loses both hands. When Bharat returns home as a war hero, Puran apologizes to him. Reunited in the village, the two brothers farm the family fields together.
