The Vancouver Youth Symphony Orchestra (VYSO) is youth orchestra located in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The VYSO operates out of St. James Community Square, and is a non-profit organization that performs a series of concerts within the Metro Vancouver region. It also provides musical education and development for young musicians.

History 
The Vancouver Youth Symphony Orchestra was founded in 1930 by R. Cyril Haworth as the Vancouver Little Orchestra. It was originally directed by the students themselves until the arrival of its first music director, George Coutts. In 1938, the orchestra became attached to the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra and was renamed the Vancouver Junior Symphony Orchestra. In 1945, a reorganization resulted in the orchestra's independence from the VSO and was renamed the Vancouver Youth Symphony Orchestra.

In 1990 Pam Chambers wrote a 32-page history of the orchestra, titled Sixty Years of Music Making: The Vancouver Youth Symphony Orchestra 1930-1990.
