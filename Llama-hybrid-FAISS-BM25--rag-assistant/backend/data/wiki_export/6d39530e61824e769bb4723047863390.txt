History
Kogarah was created for the 1930 election, partly replacing the abolished districts of Oatley and St George. It was a marginal seat in the 1930s and 1940s but, since 1953, it became increasingly safe for Labor.

The seat was first won by former state MP for St George and Oatley, Mark Gosling of the Labor Party. However, following factionalism, splits and sectarianism within the state and federal Labor parties, the United Australia Party, later the Liberal Party, won the seat at the 1932 election. Winning back the seat in 1941, the Labor Party have since held the seat for seventy-eight of the seats ninety-three years of its existence.
