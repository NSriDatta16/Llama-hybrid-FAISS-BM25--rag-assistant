History
The first written mention of Studénka is from 1436. The village of Butovice was first mentioned in 1324 and Nová Horka in 1374. For centuries, Studénka was an agricultural village, and its population was Czech; Butovice was focused on cattle breeding and pond farming and had a predominantly German population.

In 1467–1569, Studénka was owned by the lords of Fulštejn, then it was owned by the Pražma of Bílkov family, who joined it to the Bílovec estate. After the Bohemian Revolt, the properties of the family were confiscated, and in 1634 the village was acquired by Václav of Vrbno, who joined it to the Fulnek estate. In the 18th century, Studénka was bought by the Mönnich family, and in the 19th century it was inherited by the Wahlstatt family.

In 1881 and 1890, the railway lines Studénka–Štramberk and Studénka–Bílovec were opened, and in 1900, a factory for the production of railway cars was established. The factory became the main employer in the region and contributed to the development of the village.

In 1959, until then an independent municipality Butovice was merged with Studénka and Studénka obtained the statute of a town.
