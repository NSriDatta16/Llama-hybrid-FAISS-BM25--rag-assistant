Background
Speaking of the album's creation process, Thicke told Billboard “I had no idea what I was doing while I was doing it. I just made decisions based on what sounds good and feels good. If something started with a rock-guitar sound and it was a good riff, I would just keep going with it. If it was a hip-hop drum beat, I'd work with it."
Reflecting on the album in 2008, Thicke described it as an “expression and the limitless possibilities of music" and said, "I just tried to do anything and everything on it.”
