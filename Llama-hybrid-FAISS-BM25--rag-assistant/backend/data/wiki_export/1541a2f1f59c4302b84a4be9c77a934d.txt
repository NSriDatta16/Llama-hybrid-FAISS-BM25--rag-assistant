Lead(II) fluoride is the inorganic compound with the formula PbF2.  It is a white solid.  The compound is polymorphic, at ambient temperatures it exists in orthorhombic (PbCl2 type) form, while at high temperatures it is cubic (Fluorite type).

Uses

Lead(II) fluoride is used in low melting glasses, in glass coatings to reflect infrared rays, in phosphors for television-tube screens, and as a catalyst for the manufacture of picoline. The Muon g−2 experiment uses  scintillators in conjunction with silicon photomultipliers.

Preparation
Lead(II) fluoride can be prepared by treating lead(II) hydroxide or lead(II) carbonate with hydrofluoric acid:
 Pb(OH)2 + 2 HF → PbF2 + 2 H2O

Alternatively, it is precipitated by adding hydrofluoric acid to a lead(II) salt solution, or by adding a fluoride salt to a lead salt, such as potassium fluoride to a lead(II) nitrate solution, 
 2 KF + Pb(NO3)2 → PbF2 + 2 KNO3
or sodium fluoride to a lead(II) acetate solution.
 2 NaF + Pb(CH3COO)2 → PbF2 + 2 NaCH3COO

It appears as the very rare mineral fluorocronite.
