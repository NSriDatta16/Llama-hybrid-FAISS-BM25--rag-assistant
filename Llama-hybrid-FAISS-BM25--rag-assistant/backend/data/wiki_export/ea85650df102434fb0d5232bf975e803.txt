Sveti Nikole ( ; meaning Saint Nicholas) is a town in North Macedonia. It is the seat of Sveti Nikole Municipality and a center of a plain called Ovče Pole (Plain of sheep), famous for sheep farming, lamb meat, and dairy products of all kinds.

History 
According to legend, the town was named after the church of Saint Nicholas (Sveti Nikola), built in the beginning of the 14th century. It is said to have been the biggest of all 42 churches in this area at its time.

The former settlement of Arbanaško, itself derived from Arbanas (an old South Slavic ethonym for Albanians), is in present-day Sveti Nikole, suggesting either direct linguistic contact with Albanians or the former presence of an assimilated Albanian community.
