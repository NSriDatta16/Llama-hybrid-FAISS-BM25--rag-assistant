Hair of the Dog Brewing Company was a brewery in Portland, Oregon, United States. Several of its beers were bottle conditioned. The tasting room in southeast Portland's Buckman neighborhood closed on June 26, 2022.

Alan Sprints is the owner and brewer with a few helpers, including his sister and his three sons. He graduated from Le Cordon Bleu culinary school. He was president of the home brewers club Oregon Brew Crew, prior to founding Hair of the Dog in 1993.

The brewery's biggest claim to fame was its barley wine, Dave. Its Eve beer was frozen distilled three times. The brewery's Adam beer is a recreation of an Adambier, a historic brew that was originally made in Dortmund, Germany.
