He was the second guitarist to Yes offshoot Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe, both on their studio album and on tour. He has subsequently continued with a life of session work, often working with UK pop producers Absolute.

McDonald toured with British pop act Take That between 1992 until their split in 1996, then played for a variety of British, European and Japanese artists before rejoining Take That for their sell-out Ultimate Tour in 2006, and subsequent tours. In 2009 he appeared on Ray Davies’ album The Kinks Choral Collection and featured in the house band for Children In Need Rocks the Royal Albert Hall, playing guitar for Shirley Bassey, Dizzee Rascal, Annie Lennox, Paolo Nutini, Take That, Leona Lewis and Robbie Williams.
