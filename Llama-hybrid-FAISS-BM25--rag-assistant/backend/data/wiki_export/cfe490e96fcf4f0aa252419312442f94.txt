Route description 

NY 139 begins at an intersection with NY 100 (Croton Turnpike) in the town of Somers. It proceeds northeast as a two-lane highway named Primrose Street, winding its way northeast through a residential area of Somers. The homes soon give way to wooded areas, and NY 139 bends north-northeastward into another residential area north of Plum Brook Road. NY 139 turns northwest, passing a local cemetery and the Wright Reis House and soon the Somers Reis Park.

The route continues northwest, remaining a residential street near Sunderland Lane, entering a commercial district north of Foley Road. NY 139 winds its way north past Anglebrook Golf Club, bending west at a junction with Brick Hill Road. A short distance after the bend, NY 139 intersects US 202 (East Lovell Street). This junction serves as the northern terminus of NY 139, while the right-of-way continues west as US 202 and Lincolndale Avenue.

History
Primrose Street was first improved by the state of New York as part of a project contracted out by the state on August 31, 1915. The highway cost $30,355 to reconstruct (equivalent to $ in ), and the rebuilt road was added to the state highway system on February 15, 1917, as unsigned State Highway 1325 (SH 1325). In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, hundreds of state-maintained highways were assigned posted route numbers for the first time. SH 1325 was designated as NY 139 by the following year, and the alignment of NY 139 has not changed since that time.
