The programme follows London Underground workers: drivers, station staff and managers, showing the Underground system to the public through their eyes. First shown on ITV London, it was later also broadcast on certain Sky television channels, including Sky Real Lives and Sky3.

The programme was produced by Mosaic Films first for Carlton Television, and later for ITV London and Sky Travel.
To date, there have been three series produced, including a two-part special on the 7 July 2005 London bombings. The series is now sometimes repeated, mostly on Pick.
