Shape of Despair is funeral doom metal band Shape of Despair's self-titled album. It was released on the 10th anniversary of the band's formation (counting the years the band was known as "Raven", from 1995 to 1998), but not in honor of the occasion. The album features previously unreleased songs and demos of older songs, while some of them are under the former moniker "Raven", as well as the new song "Sleeping Murder" that had a "guess the lyrics" competition.
