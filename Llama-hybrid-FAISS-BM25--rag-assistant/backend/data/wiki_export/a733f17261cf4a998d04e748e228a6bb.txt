Aboriginal culture
The Kuku Yalanji people have a tribal belief that Thornton Beach is a place which can stimulate fertility.  It was once the practice for the young women of the tribe to spend time on Thornton Beach before they went to an offshore island (Struck Island) to receive their tribal scars and other marks of womanhood and marriageability.
