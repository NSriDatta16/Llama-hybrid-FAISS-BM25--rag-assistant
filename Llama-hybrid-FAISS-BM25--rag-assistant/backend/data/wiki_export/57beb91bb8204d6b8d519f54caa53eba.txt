Tuoba Shiyijian (; 320–376) was the last prince of the Xianbei-led Dai dynasty of China and ruled from 338 to 376 when Dai was conquered by the Former Qin dynasty. He was the son of Tuoba Yulü and the younger brother of Tuoba Yihuai, whom he succeeded in 338. In 340 he moved the capital to Shengle (盛樂) (near modern Horinger County, Inner Mongolia). His grandson Tuoba Gui later founded the Northern Wei dynasty and accorded him the posthumous name Emperor Zhaocheng (昭成皇帝) and the temple name Gaozu (高祖).
