History

The university was founded on 18 October 1920 as a 'Rashtriya Vidyapith' ('National University') by Mahatma Gandhi, who would serve throughout his life as the kulpati (chancellor) and all needs of Fund collected by sardar Vallabhbhai Patel by his personal relations and capacity.

The Gujarat Vidyapith was started in Dahyabhai Mehta's bungalow behind the Kocharab Ashram (the Kocharab Aashram was started in barrister Jivanlal Desai's bungalow).

Its purpose was to promote educational institutions run by Indians for Indians outside the financial and governing control of British authorities. The university helped nationalists establish a system of education for all Indians, thus proving the country's independence from British-run institutions and de-legitimizing the British Raj. Its foundation was one of the important event of an initiative  satyagraha launched by Gandhi as a means to peacefully terminate British rule in India.

The vidyapith's foundation was emulated by nationalists in Benares, Bombay, Calcutta, Nagpur, Madras and in many cities across India. Answering Gandhi's call to boycott British institutions, influences and goods, many thousands of students and teachers left British colleges to join the Vidyapith.

People like Jivatram Kripalani and Nanabhai Bhatt volunteered to teach.

The Gujarat Vidyapith became a 'deemed university' in 1963. It is funded and governed by the University Grants Commission, under the Union Ministry for Human Resources Development in New Delhi.
