Philip Oliver Hale (born 1963) is an American figurative painter who currently resides in London, England.

Early life and education

Early work
Prior to turning to fine arts he worked as an illustrator, doing mostly figurative work. He was apprenticed to/ partnered with American painter Rick Berry.

Current work
His current work focuses on figure as well, in depictions of slightly surreal scenes with strange characters performing various physical feats, usually in a confrontation of some sort.

A portrait of former UK Prime Minister, Tony Blair by the artist was unveiled in Westminster on April 23, 2008. Mr Blair sat for the portrait during his final months in office in 2007.

He also recently formed the movie production company "unprofessional.com" with his son Callum Hale Thomson. It specializes in bespoke analogue filmmaking.

In 2015, Hale displayed 15 oil paintings and at least 18 pencil drawings in an exhibition titled Life Wants to Live. The exhibition showed at Jonathan LeVine's Gallery in New York and was later published as a book.
