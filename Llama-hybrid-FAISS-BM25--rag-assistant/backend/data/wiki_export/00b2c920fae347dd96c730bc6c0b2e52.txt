Str8 Outta Northcote is the second full-length album from Australian grindcore band Blood Duster. The title is a parody of the N.W.A album, Straight Outta Compton. Northcote is the suburb where most of the band's members lived at that time.

According to the album's liner notes, it features 69 riffs and 758 words, listed in the style of Iron Maiden’s Live After Death . Blood Duster decided to mostly abandon their grind style for this album, delivering instead some catchy Southern rock-style riffs, reminiscent of Lynyrd Skynyrd – the band even makes use of a Hammond B3 electronic organ, played by guitarist Finn Alman's mother. 

The band’s good-humored offensive lyrics are also present, with the band attacking vegans, girls, hippies, punks, the music industry and even the label itself.

The album also features many audio samples from movies.

Blood Duster pay homage to Kyuss in two noticeable ways on this album. First, the back cover of the album is identical to the cover of the album "Welcome to Sky Valley" by Kyuss, except the sign has been Photoshopped to read 'Northcote 32, Springvale 20, Compton 6'. Secondly, one of the tracks on the album ends identically to the Kyuss song "Supa Scoopa and Mighty Scoop", from the same album.

Reception 

AllMusic's William York rated it at two-and-a-half-out-of-five stars and explained, "best described as groove-heavy Southern rock played by a death metal/grindcore band, grunting, low-in vocals and all. In between the longer songs – and that is relatively speaking, since only four of them are longer than two minutes – are a number of short, blasting grindcore tracks."
