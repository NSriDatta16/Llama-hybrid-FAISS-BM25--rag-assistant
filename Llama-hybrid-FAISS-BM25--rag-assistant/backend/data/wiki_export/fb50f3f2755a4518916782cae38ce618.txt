History
The regiment, which was initially styled the 14th/20th Hussars, was created by the amalgamation of the 14th King's Hussars and the 20th Hussars in 1922. It was re-titled the 14th/20th King's Hussars in December 1936. The regiment, which was based in India at the start of the Second World War, dispatched a cadre of personnel to form the 26th Hussars in February 1941. The remainder of the regiment was deployed to Iraq and Persia later that year to guard the oil fields. It landed in Italy in 1944 and then took part in the capture of Medicina in April 1945.

After the war the regiment remained in Germany until 1946 when it moved to Cambrai Lines at Catterick Garrison as RAC Training Regiment. It moved to Haig Lines in Church Crookham in January 1951 and then deployed to Libya in November 1952.
