History 
The village was first mentioned in 1320 as Nuwelant, and means new land (polder). Nieuwland was a stretched out cultivation concession. A church was built near the Geer Vliet. The tower of the Protestant Church dates from the 14th century. The church was extensively restored between 1955 and 1957. In 1840, Nieuwland was home to 245 people.
