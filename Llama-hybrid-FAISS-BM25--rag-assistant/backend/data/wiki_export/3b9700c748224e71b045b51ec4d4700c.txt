Lewis Victor Heilbrunn (January 24, 1892 – October 1959) was an influential American biologist.

Heilbrunn was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1927, and on his return from Europe began teaching 
at the University of Pennsylvania, a position he would hold for 30 years.  His Outline of General Physiology (first edition 1937) became a standard foundational text in the field.
