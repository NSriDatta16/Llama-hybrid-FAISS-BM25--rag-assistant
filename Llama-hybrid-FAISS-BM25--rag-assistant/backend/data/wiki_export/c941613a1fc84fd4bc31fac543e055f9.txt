Francisco José Molinero Calderón (born 26 July 1985) is a Spanish former professional footballer who played as a right-back.

Club career
Molinero was born in Ontígola, Province of Toledo, Castilla–La Mancha. After playing two La Liga seasons for Atlético Madrid (his first game being on 25 September 2004, featuring the full 90 minutes in a 1–0 home win against Villarreal CF), in whose youth system he grew, he served a Segunda División loan stint at Málaga CF.

In July 2007, free agent Molinero agreed to a two-year deal to RCD Mallorca. He appeared sparingly throughout the season, moving the following campaign to Levante UD, recently relegated to the second division.

Molinero left Spain for the first time in his career when he signed with Romania's FC Dinamo București on 21 July 2009, managing to help the club fulfill "The wonder from Liberec" after winning with 3–0 the away game against Slovan Liberec, as the first leg was lost with the same score, qualifying after the penalty shoot-out to the group stage of the 2009–10 Europa League. He spent only one year in Liga I, however, cancelling his three-year contract in the summer and returning to his country, joining division two club SD Huesca.

In the 2011 off-season, Molinero signed with Real Murcia for three years. On 26 June 2014, after never appearing in less than 37 league matches, he moved to Real Betis also in the second tier; he achieved promotion in 2015, contributing one goal to the feat.

On 25 June 2016, Molinero joined Getafe CF on a two-year contract. He returned to the second division in July 2018, with the 33-year-old agreeing to a deal at Sporting de Gijón.
