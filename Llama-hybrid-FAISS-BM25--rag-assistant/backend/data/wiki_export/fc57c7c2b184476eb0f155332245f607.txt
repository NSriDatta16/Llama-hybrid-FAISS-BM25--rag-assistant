The Western Iranian languages or Western Iranic languages are a branch of the Iranian languages, attested from the time of Old Persian (6th century BC) and Median.

Languages
The traditional Northwestern branch is a convention for non-Southwestern languages, rather than a genetic group. The languages are as follows:

Old Iranian period 
 Northwest: Median†, etc.
 Southwest: Old Persian†, etc.

Middle Iranian period 
 Northwest: Parthian†, etc.
 Southwest: Middle Persian†, etc

There is also a recently described, and as yet unclassified, Batu'i language that is presumably Western Iranian. Extinct Deilami is sometimes classified in the Caspian branch.
An Iranian Khalaj language has been claimed, but does not exist; the Khalaj speak a Turkic language.

Many of the languages and dialects spoken in Markazi and Isfahan provinces are giving way to Persian in the younger generations.

It is to note that the Caspian languages (incl. Adharic), the central dialects, and the Zaza-Gorani languages are likely descended from a later form of Median with varying amounts of Parthian substrata, whereas the Semnani languages were likely descended from Parthian.
