History
The station received its incorporation certificate on 12 October 1981 and began broadcasting in May 1983 from East Chatswood, transmitting to Sydney's North Shore - an area that covers the Willoughby, Lane Cove, North Sydney, Mosman and Ku-ring-gai Council areas. 

The station was originally broadcasting on FM91.5, playing from a jazz-oriented playlist. Following a move to the FM99.3 frequency in 2003, the station was re-branded Rhythm & Jazz, encompassing a range of genres from traditional jazz to smooth jazz, funk, soul, blues and world music.

From January 2010 the station began restructuring its programs and music content to reflect the expressed wishes of the North Shore community. This was confirmed during a 2011 survey of listeners, supporters and subscribers, who asked for more music they couldn’t hear anywhere else, music that was not played on other radio stations and more local news, views and matters of local interest.

A grant in 2014 allowed the station to add a second studio (Studio 2), enabling presenters to broadcast live to air in one studio, while people conducted interviews or recorded programs in the other.
