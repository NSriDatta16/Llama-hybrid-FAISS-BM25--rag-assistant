The Organization of Pakistani Entrepreneurs of North America (OPEN) is a not-for-profit organization, whose sole focus is the promotion of entrepreneurship and professional growth. OPEN is a secular and non-political organization.

Background
OPEN was formed on March 22, 1998, in Boston by a group of Pakistani American entrepreneurs and corporate executives. The purpose of the organization is to create a platform to help promote entrepreneurship and assist professionals in their careers and to mentor them to achieve their aspirations. Imran Qidwai and Imran Khan came up with the idea, Tahir Chaudhry coined the organization's name. Feisal A Ahmad, Iftikhar's son designed the logo. The founding team consisted of Imran H Khan as President, Tahir H Chaudhry as Secretary, Iftikhar A Ahmad as Treasurer, Board Members were Hassan Ahmed, Salman Akhtar, M. Salahuddin Khan and Imran Qidwai. OPEN was registered in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on May 5, 2000 (more on http://open-boston.org/history/). Additional cities/areas joined; New York, Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C. The founding team in consultation with its legal counsel came up with the plan to create a governing body that would ensure a streamlined growth of OPEN and its mission. This organization was initially called "OPEN National" and was US centric. Soon after it was decided not to limit it to US but expand the reach globally thus Open National was renamed as "OPEN Global" and its charter was defined. The first OPEN location was converted to the first chapter Boston, MA with New York, Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C., as other chapters. Houston was the next chapter that was formed. Globally, OPEN now has 17 chapters and over 350 charter members, 2,000 general members and over 50,000 on its mailing list. The chapters and members continue to grow. The organization consists of corporate professionals, entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, banking professionals, social leaders and academics.

Throughout its entire existence OPEN has been and is a team effort! No single person can and should take full credit or claim to be a founder of any entity of OPEN. If anyone does, itâ€™s a false claim!
