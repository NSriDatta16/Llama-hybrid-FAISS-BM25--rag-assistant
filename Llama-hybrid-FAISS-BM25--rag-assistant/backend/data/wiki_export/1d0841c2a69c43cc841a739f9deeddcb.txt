Miracles on Maple Hill is a 1956 novel by Virginia Sorensen that won the 1957 Newbery Medal for excellence in American children's literature. The book was illustrated by Beth and Joe Krush.

The settings and characters for the book were inspired by real people and locations the author encountered during her stay in Edinboro, Pennsylvania between 1952–1958.

Summary
Marly's family moves to the country so that her father, a former prisoner of war, can learn to function once more. The family is befriended by a neighbor couple, Mr. and Mrs. Chris, who make their living with maple syrup. Marly and her brother adapt to living in the country. Their father's condition also improves.

Plot
Marly's father just returned from the war; he is suffering from mood swings and depression, and seems to be tired all the time. Lee, Marly's mother, moves the family to Maple Hill, a town where the children's grandmother once lived, so that her husband, Marly's father, will not suffer as much as he would in the city. In Maple Hill, neighbors help one another when help is needed; they do not keep secrets from one another.  The family is supported by a neighbor couple, Mr. and Mrs. Chris, who make their living with maple syrup. Marly and her brother adapt to living in the country very well, and eventually become happier there. Their father's condition also improves  tremendously.

When Mr. Chris has a heart attack during sugaring time, Marly's family steps forward to return the kindness that the Chrises have shown them. They collect the entire crop of sap and boil it down, but they are certain that they lack Mr. Chris's deft touch with making syrup. When Mr. Chris is allowed to return home, it is the moment of truth: is their syrup as good as Mr. Chris's?  Mr. Chris himself is unable to detect any difference. Marly reflects that the recovery of her father and Mr. Chris, the growing strength of bonds within her family, and the second chances for life and love are the true miracles of Maple Hill.

Critical reception
Miracles on Maple Hill was published to very strong reviews. Kirkus Reviews called it "a complete and realistic family story", while the School Library Journal found it "skillfully dramatized" and an "inspiring American classic". The New York Times Book Review called the book "Warm and real as her two previous books centering about a 10-year-old 'curious Missile' and 'Plain Girl'-this one packed with incident, country magic, family love and people to remember; it has substance and spiritual worth." In a retrospective essay about the Newbery Medal-winning books from 1956 to 1965, librarian Carolyn Horovitz wrote that the book "seems to miss its objective because of a sentimental use of language. I know this author has written better books."
