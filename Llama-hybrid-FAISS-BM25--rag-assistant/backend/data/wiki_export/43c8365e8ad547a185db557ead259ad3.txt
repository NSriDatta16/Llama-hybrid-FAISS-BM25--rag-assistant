The Yellow Rose is an American soap opera television series that was broadcast on NBC from October 2, 1983, until May 12, 1984. The series was produced by Paul Freeman and was at least partly inspired by the more coltish elements of the soap opera Dallas, and dealt with the intrigues of the Texas-based Champion family who owned a 200,000-acre cattle and oil ranch called "The Yellow Rose".

The Yellow Rose was canceled after one season of 22 episodes. In 1990, the series was rerun again on NBC along with Bret Maverick starring James Garner.
