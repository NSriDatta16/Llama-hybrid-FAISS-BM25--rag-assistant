Critical reception
A reviewer for Keyboard wrote that Telemetry of a Fallen Angel "crosses over into the realm of concept album, detailing the travels of an extraterrestrial probe. The tone is persistently dark, with a restless intellectual bent creeping underneath it all. However, this is not a goth retread. The sounds blend into a single, highly polished sheen; rhythms bounce along energetically, and everything moves along purposefully." Daniel Rubin of The Philadelphia Inquirer called the album "Passionate yet accessible, with lyrics that evoke myths ancient and modern."
