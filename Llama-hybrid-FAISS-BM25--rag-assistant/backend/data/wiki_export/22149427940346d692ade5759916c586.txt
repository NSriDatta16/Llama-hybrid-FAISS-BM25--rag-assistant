"Breakfast in Bed" is a soul–R&B song written by Muscle Shoals songwriters Eddie Hinton and Donnie Fritts for Dusty Springfield. It takes a knowing spin on the line "You Don't Have to Say You Love Me", the title of a song that had previously been a number one hit for her in the UK. After being released on her 1969 album Dusty in Memphis, it was recorded and popularized the same year by Baby Washington. Harry J produced three reggae versions in 1972, by Lorna Bennett, Scotty, and Bongo Herman.

UB40 and Chrissie Hynde version

English reggae and pop band UB40 collaborated with Chrissie Hynde of the English-American band the Pretenders for a cover version of "Breakfast in Bed", included on the band's self-titled eighth album (1988). This was the group's second time recording with Hynde for a single release, after "I Got You Babe", in 1985. UB40 chose to record the song after hearing Lorna Bennett's rendition. Released as a single in 1988, this version peaked at number six on the UK Singles Chart and entered the top ten in Belgium, Ireland, the Netherlands, and New Zealand. In the United States, the song reached number four on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart.
