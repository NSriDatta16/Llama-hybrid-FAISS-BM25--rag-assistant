History and profile

The University of Insubria, which includes two main sites, in Como and in Varese, was incorporated on 14 July 1998, but the institution which thus became a university had earlier origins.
In 1972, a University Centre had been established in Varese as an extension of the Faculty of Medicine of University of Pavia followed in 1990 by an extension of the Faculty of Mathematical, Physical and Natural Sciences and of the Faculty of Economics of the University of Milan.
In 1989, a University Centre had been established in Como as an extension of the Engineering Faculty of the Politecnico di Milano university and of the Faculty of Mathematical, Physical and Natural Sciences of the University of Milan.

In Como, during the fifteenth century at the College of Chartered Jurisconsults, there was a University School with three chairs: Moral Theology (active since 1473), Mixed Canon Law (founded in 1656 by Thomas Verga) and Institutions (founded in 1656 by Francesco Benzi). This university remained active until the year 1795.

Since 1989 indeed Como has been the centre for regular degree courses in Engineering which were arisen precisely from Politecnico of Milan as well as in Science and since 1994 in Law, which originated from the University of Milan.

In the frame of Governmental reform designed to solve the problems of overcrowded universities in Italy, plans were made to establish new universities, some of which had to include a network of sites.

In 1996â€“1997, the Osservatorio Nazionale, the Italian national office for the assessment of the university system, visited the facilities in the university sites in Como and Varese, where other Faculties had been opened in the meantime and suggested that a new university featuring an organisation based on two Delegacies should be opened.

In Italy, this was one of the first proposals aimed at establishing a university network.
The new University of Insubria is in a large centre of population and has close cultural and academic relationships with the Universities of Milan and Pavia, upon which it is based, as well as with the other Universities in the Insubria territory, including the Canton Ticino (Switzerland).

The University of Insubria acquired full status on 14 July 1998. The newly established University, which is anchored to the traditions of the Insubria territory is the first example of a network-based organisation as suggested by the Osservatorio Nazionale in its assessment of the Italian University system.

The University of Insubria implied a radical change in the local historical development, which was socially and economically expensive because the territory was organised as a suburb of the city of Milan, and horizontal connections were inadequate for the population's growing needs. Today more than 7,000 students no longer commute between Varese and Milan or Como and Milan.

Sites
Overall, Insubria University counts two main sites, educational facilities and laboratories in different locations of the Lombard territory.

The two main institutional sites are actually Como and Varese.

According to the Statute, laid down on 11 March 2002, the two sites just mentioned have equal dignity: the university ensures equal development, harmonic and fair, encouraging common initiatives and the integration of both the didactic and research activities.

In Varese at present there are the sites of:
 Via Ravasi, 2 - 21100 Varese
 Via J.H. Dunant, 3 - 21100 Varese
 Via Ottorino Rossi, 9 - 21100 Varese
 Via Monte Generoso, 71 - 21100 Varese

In Como you can find the following sites:
 Via M.E. Bossi, 5 - 22100 Como
 Viale Felice Cavallotti, 5 - 22100 Como
 Via Valleggio, 11 - 22100 Como
 Via S. Abbondio, 12 - 22100 Como

Of particular historic and artistic interest should be surely noticed the Cloister of the Basilica of Sant'Abbondio in Como (among the oldest in Europe and used at first as a convent, then as an Episcopal Seminary), already home of the Faculty of Law, now of the Department of Law, Economics and Cultures (DEC), the most prestigious centre of the entire University, and the Palazzo Natta, ancient palace of a noble family belonging to the aristocracy of Como dating back to the sixteenth century, with details dating back even to the thirteenth century, headquarters of the rectorate.

Further didactic facilities are: Saronno (VA) and Busto Arsizio (VA).

There are also other locations where you may find laboratories, offices and premises in the provinces of Como and Varese.

The main university hospital is the Ospedale di Circolo e Fondazione Macchi in Varese.
Villa Toeplitz, Varese houses the headquarters of the Faculty of Communication Sciences of the University of Insubria.

Didactics
There are about 10.000 students attending the academic year 2014/2015.
