Goliath is a steel roller coaster located at Six Flags Magic Mountain amusement park in Valencia, California. Manufactured by Giovanola of Switzerland, the hypercoaster is located in the Goliath Plaza section of the park and opened to the public on February 11, 2000. Its sub-tropical theme is characterized by ancient ruins of the Mayan civilization. The ride is nearly identical to Titan at Six Flags Over Texas, but it lacks a 540-degree upward helix prior to the mid-course brake run and features a slightly shorter track layout.

For a brief period, Goliath was widely recognized for having the longest drop at  and the fastest speed of  among all closed-circuit roller coasters in the world. Millennium Force at Cedar Point eclipsed both records several months later when it debuted on May 13, 2000, with a drop of  and a maximum speed of .

History
On January 29, 1999, Giovanola roller coaster track arrived at Six Flags Magic Mountain. It was then confirmed that the new attraction would be a hypercoaster.

On November 11, 1999, Six Flags Magic Mountain announced that the new coaster would be named Goliath. The ride officially opened on February 11, 2000.

In November 2013, seat belts were added to Goliath and Full Throttle.

During the 2015 season, Goliath was covered in advertisements to promote Monster Hunter 4, a Nintendo 3DS game. A Gore Magala monster statue was displayed near the entrance. The queue line featured a supply hunt, large signs talking about the game, a camping site and other props. Plus, the train was wrapped to look like the Gore Magala. A good luck sign was placed in the station and a larger sign was displayed near the exit.

Ride experience
Leaving the station, the train makes a nearly 180 degree right turn. The train then ascends the chain lift hill, reaching a height of . Ascent slows toward the top of the chain lift hill, a safety feature that reduces stress on the chain; it is also an attempt to reduce positive g-forces and increases rider anticipation. The train begins accelerating down its first  drop at a 61-degree angle, into an underground tunnel, reaching a top speed of . Upon exiting the tunnel, the train heads upwards into a banked right turn that towers above Twisted Colossus. After completing the turn, the train heads down another drop, flattening out to pass by the onride camera. An airtime hill and banked left turn (rather than a helix on "Titan") follows into the mid-course brake run. The train is decelerated quickly and makes a hard left turn out of the brake section. Another 180 degree banked turn directs the train into a 585 degree, descending helix. Then, the track turns upwards and banks left. After an ascending right turn, the train reaches the final brake run.

Three five-car 30-passenger trains, with two abreast seating.
A small error was made while the ride's parts were being manufactured by Giovanola. The very last track piece before the final brake run was about  too short. The mistake was found while the final piece was being bolted to the ride, and a supplementary track piece had to be made to fill the  gap.

Incidents
