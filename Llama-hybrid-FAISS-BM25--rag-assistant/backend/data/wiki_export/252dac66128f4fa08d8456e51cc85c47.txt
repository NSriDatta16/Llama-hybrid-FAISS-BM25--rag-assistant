Jacques Laurent or Jacques Laurent-Cély (5 January 1919 – 29 December 2000) was a French writer and journalist. He was born in Paris, the son of a barrister. During World War II, he fought with the Algerian Tirailleurs.

Laurent was elected to the Académie française in 1986.

Laurent belonged to the literary group of the Hussards, and is known as a prolific historical novelist, essay writer, and screenwriter under the pen name of Cecil Saint-Laurent. The 1955 film Lola Montès, directed by Max Ophüls, was based on his historic novel based on the life of Lola Montez. He wrote Jean Aurel's Oscar-nominated 1963 World War I documentary, 14-18. He also directed the film Quarante-huit heures d'amour/48 Hours of Love (1969).

Another noteworthy novel by Saint-Laurent was Darling Caroline (written in 1947), a powerful book set in the early days of the French Revolution. This also became a film. This was released in France in 1951, directed by Jean-Devaivre and starring Martine Carol in the title role. Saint-Laurent was one of the scriptwriters of the film.

The 1961 "Les Passagers pour Alger" (translated to English as "Algerian Adventure") was a contemporary thriller, set against the background of the then raging Algerian War, and like many of his books written from the point of view of adventurous, daring young woman.

Laurent received the Prix Goncourt in 1971 for his novel Les Bêtises.

Revolutionary  insurgent Ukrainian  Anarchist and ally of Nestor Makhno appears in the novel "Clarisse", by Cecil Saint-Laurent.
