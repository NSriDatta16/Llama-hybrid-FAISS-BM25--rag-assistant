Archive status
Most of the original videotapes of this show were wiped by the BBC, mainly from series one and two. As a result, 14 episodes are missing, mostly from series one, leaving 48 surviving. Although many episodes survive as black and white telerecordings, the series was produced in colour. Series four and one episode of series three exist as their original colour versions.
