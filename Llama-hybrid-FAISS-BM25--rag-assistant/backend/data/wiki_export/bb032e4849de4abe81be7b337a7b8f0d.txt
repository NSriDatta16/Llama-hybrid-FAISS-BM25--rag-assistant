Chi Epsilon () is an American collegiate civil engineering honor society. It honors engineering students who have exemplified the "principles of scholarship, character, practicality, and sociability...in the civil engineering profession."  As of 2023, there are 141 chapters, of which 137 are active, where over 125,000 members have been inducted.

History 
In early 1922, two local civil engineering student groups–Chi Epsilon and Chi Delta Chi–formed independently at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign and petitioned for university recognition. Once the two groups learned of each other, they merged under the Chi Epsilon name. The university approved Chi Epsilon on May 20, 1922, recognized by the society as it founding date, The group had 25 founding members.

Chi Epsilon  is "dedicated to the purpose of maintaining and promoting the status of civil engineering as an ideal profession." Its objective and purpose are to uphold competence, sound engineering, good moral judgment, and a commitment to society to improve the civil engineering profession.

The society received a certificate of incorporation from the State of Illinois on February 23, 1923.

Chi Epsilon sent letters to other engineering programs, inviting students to found a chapter. A second chapter was chartered at the Armour Institute of Technology on March 29, 1923.

The society is overseen by student officers at each chapter who act through a National Council. Its headquarters is located at the University of Texas at Arlington.

Symbols 
The society's motto is "Conception, Design, Construction", suggested by the Greek letters Chi Delta Chi, the proposed name for one of Chi Epsion's predecessor groups.

The colors of Chi Epsilon are purple and white. Its badge is a key made in the likeness of the front of a Theodolite or engineer's transit, the instrument of a surveyor. Its publication is The Transit, published semi-annually in the spring and fall of each year.

Membership 
Male and female undergraduates, graduates, and faculty in civil engineering are all eligible to become members if they meet basic requirements. Undergraduates must be in the top third of their class and have completed at least half of the civil engineering curriculum leading to a bachelor's degree. Members are selected based on scholarship, character, practicality, and sociability, the four primary requirements of a successful engineer.

All candidates must participate in a formal initiation ceremony. After becoming a regular member, anyone who has attained eminence through accomplishments in the profession may become a Chapter Honor Member.  The next level of elevation is National Honor Member.

National Honor Members 
National Honor Members start as collegiate members or chapter honor members but are elevated based on professional achievement. The chapters listed are the original chapter of initiation, followed by the NHM elevation chapter if different.
