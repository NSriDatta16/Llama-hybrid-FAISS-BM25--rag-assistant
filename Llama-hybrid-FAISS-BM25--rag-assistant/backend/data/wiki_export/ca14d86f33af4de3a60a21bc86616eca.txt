Charles LeMaire (April 22, 1897 – June 8, 1985) was an American costume designer. He
was born in Chicago.

LeMaire's early career was as a vaudeville performer, but he became a costume designer for such Broadway productions as Ziegfeld Follies and The Five O'Clock Girl. By 1925 he turned to the movies. LeMaire was instrumental in persuading the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to institute a costume design Oscar. In a career spanning 37 years and nearly 300 films, he earned a total of three Academy Awards and an additional 13 nominations.

LeMaire married Beatrice Hayman Goetz (1892-1978), the former wife of film producer Harry Goetz, in Beverly Hills on November 27, 1943. He died of heart failure in 1985.
