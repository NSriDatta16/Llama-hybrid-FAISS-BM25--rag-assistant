Structure

Department of Homeland Security 
The Department of Homeland Security is a department within the military that protects the United States and its civilians outside and in its borders. The main goal of homeland security is to prevent and protect against natural disasters and terrorism. There is a wide variety of jobs that fulfill the goals/needs of homeland security. Border patrol, cyber security, and emergency response are some jobs within the department. The Idaho Office of Emergency Management (IOEM) falls within the Homeland Security as well. IOEM’s mission is to have a thorough and effective plan when it comes to emergencies and natural disasters. IOEM’s operation plan lists out all the duties and responsibilities when responding to disasters. Their one main goal out of many is to have a prompt and well planned response, care, and search for victims injured by disaster.

Idaho Youth Challenge Program 
The Idaho Youth Challenge Academy is a high school academy open to 16–18 year old Idaho resident high school dropouts. This program is used as a constructive learning environment to help teach life skills and self-discipline to at-risk youth.

Idaho Air Force Bases 
Idaho is home of two major Air Force bases; Gowen Field Air National Guard and Mountain Home Air Force Base.

Gowen Field Air National Guard 
Gowen Field was established in 1946, on October 13 by Lieutenant Colonel Thomas George Lanphier Jr. The first unit among the Idaho Air Force Department became the 190th Fighter Squadron, which they were originally named. They started with no airfield, planes, or money, which they eventually moved to Gowen Field which used to be a United States Army Air Corps base in 1947. The squadron had acquired their first P-51D Mustang right before transferring to Gowen Field, which was then used for training. The first call to action for the 190th Fighter Squadron was in 1950 when they were to replace American Air Force units in the Korean War. The 124th Fighter Wing's A-10s had supported NATO forces in Kosovo in 1999, and again in Iraq in 2003 as part of  Operation Iraqi Freedom.

The Idaho Air National Guard continues to serve state-wide as well as nation-wide. They provide assistance for security, as well as provide possibilities for civil engineering and logistics. They indulge in much critical training for their troops which includes air-traffic training, and dangerous ground-to-air preparation.

Mountain Home Air Force Base 
The Mountain Home Air Force Base was first established around the United States' entry into World War II, but the division itself was not officially started until after the war ended. Construction began in November 1942, and was not officially opened to the public until August 7, 1943.

The Mountain Home Air Force Base consists of more than 4,800 military servicemen and servicewomen. The base consists of three different fighter squadrons; the 389th Fighter Squadron, the 391st Fighter Squadron, as well as a Republic of Singapore 428th Fighter Squadron. Today, the 366th Fighter Wing participates is ready to be called to action for suppressing hostile air defenses as well as allied transportation aircraft and ground soldiers.
