Tungsten dichloride dioxide, or Tungstyl chloride is the chemical compound with the formula . It is a yellow-colored solid. It is used as a precursor to other tungsten compounds. Like other tungsten halides,  is sensitive to moisture, undergoing hydrolysis.

Preparation
 is prepared by ligand redistribution reaction from tungsten trioxide and tungsten hexachloride:

Using a two-zone tube furnace, a vacuum-sealed tube containing these solids is heated to 350 °C. The yellow product sublimes to the cooler end of the reaction tube. No redox occurs in this process. An alternative route highlights the oxophilicity of tungsten:

This reaction, like the preceding one, proceeds via the intermediacy of .

Structure
Gaseous tungsten dichloride dioxide is a monomer. Solid tungsten dichloride dioxide is a polymer consisting of distorted octahedral W centres. The polymer is characterized by two short W-O distances, typical for a multiple W-O bond, and two long W-O distances more typical of a single or dative W-O bond.

Related oxy halides
Tungsten forms a number of oxyhalides including , , . The corresponding bromides (, , ) are also known as is .

Reactions

 is a Lewis acid, forming soluble adducts of the type , where L is a donor ligand such as bipyridine and dimethoxyethane. Such complexes often cannot be prepared by depolymerization of the inorganic solid, but are generated in situ from .
