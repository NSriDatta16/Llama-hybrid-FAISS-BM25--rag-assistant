Heartbreaker is the twentieth solo studio album by American singer-songwriter Dolly Parton. It was released on July 17, 1978, by RCA Victor. The album was produced by Gary Klein and Parton with Charles Koppelman serving as executive producer, and was an even more direct aim at the pop charts, with several of its songs verging on disco. The album topped the Billboard Top Country Albums chart for nine consecutive weeks and peaked at number 27 on the Billboard 200. The album produced two number one hits on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, "Heartbreaker" and "I Really Got the Feeling", while "Baby I'm Burnin'" peaked at number 25 on the Billboard Hot 100. The album has been certified Gold in the United States and Canada.

Content
Following the success of 1977's Here You Come Again, Parton again teamed up with producer Gary Klein for her follow-up album. The album furthers her transition into pop music and features disco influences as well.

The album cover, a gatefold design depicting Parton in a series of surreal, dream-like images, was designed by graphic artist Ed Caraeff, who had also designed the cover art for Here You Come Again.

Recording
The album was recorded from March 7–10, 1978 at Sound Labs in Los Angeles, California.

Additional promotion
For Valentine's Day 1979, Parton saturated the media. She co-headlined the CBS TV special Dolly & Carol in Nashville alongside Carol Burnett, and RCA Records provided over 3,000 radio stations with copies of the album and boxes of candies for giveaways. Only a snippet of the title song was performed on the special as part of a heart-themed medley. Participating radio stations designed their own promotions, which included call-in giveaways, drawings, a poetry contest, and one in which winners were assigned gender-specific prizes (candy for ladies, records for men).

Critical reception

The album received positive reviews from music critics. Billboard said that while "Parton continues to lean heavily towards the pop flavored song and delivery...there are subtle country textures and even one or two mainstream country songs." The review praised the album's upbeat songs and ballads as "executed in Parton's charming vocal manner." It went on to praise the album's material, calling Parton's own compositions "forceful", Gary Klein's production as "masterful," and the musicians "top notch." The review selected "I Really Got the Feeling", "Baby I'm Burnin'", "Heartbreaker", "We're Through Forever ('Til Tomorrow)", and "Nickels and Dimes" as the best cuts on the album.

Cashbox also gave a positive review of the album. The review said the album "borders on perfection." While noting Parton's "deep roots sunk back in the hollows of East Tennessee," the review pointed out that "she is fast leaving country music." It went on to say that there isn't anything wrong with this, Parton is simply growing as an artist. The review closed by saying that "at this point, Dolly has to be considered a superstar in the largest sense."

Zac Johnson of AllMusic gave the album four out of five stars. He felt that the album "showcases [Parton's] increasing confidence beautifully."
