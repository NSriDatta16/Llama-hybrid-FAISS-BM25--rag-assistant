History 

Yalkharoy is the ancestral home of the Yalkharoy teip.

In the second half of the 18th century (1770s), the German researcher J. A. Güldenstädt mentioned the village of Yalkharoy as part of the district of "Sholkha" which according to him was called "Little Angusht" by the Russians due to its proximity to Angusht proper. Yalkharoy among the villages of the Ingush in 1823 was also mentioned by S. M. Bronevskiy.

According to the Regulations on the management of the Terek Oblast in 1862, the Ingushskiy Okrug was established as part of the Western Department. It included societies of Nazranians, Karabulaks, Galgai, Kistins, Akkins and Tsorins (also Meredzhin society and some Galanchozh and Yalkharoy auls). The village of Yalkharoy was part of the Gorsky section of the Ingush district. In 1866 the village of Yalkharoy (Meredzhi society, some Galanchozh, Yalkharoy auls and Akkin society) was ceded to the  due to them belonging to the same nation as the locals (Chechen) and geographically closer to the central governance of the Okrug.

From 1940 to 1944, Yalkhara was the administrative center of Galanchozhsky District. On 27 February 1944, after the genocide and deportation of the Chechen and Ingush people and the Chechen-Ingush ASSR was abolished, the village of Yalkhara was abandoned and destroyed.

In 1957, after the Vaynakh people returned and the Chechen-Ingush ASSR was restored, the former residents of Galanchozhsky District were forbidden to resettle there. As a result, most former residents of Yalkhara resettled in the flat lands of the republic, mostly in the Achkhoy-Martanovsky, Groznensky and Sernovodsky districts.

In 2019, Yalkhara was named as one of the first 7 settlements in Galanchozhsky District to be rebuilt in order to resettle the area.
