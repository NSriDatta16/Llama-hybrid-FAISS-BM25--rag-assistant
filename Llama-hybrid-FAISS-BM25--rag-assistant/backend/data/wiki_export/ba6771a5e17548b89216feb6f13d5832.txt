Parabuthus transvaalicus (known as the Transvaalicus thick-tailed scorpion, South African thick tail, or giant deathstalker) is a species of venomous scorpion from semi-arid parts of southern Africa.

Description
Parabuthus transvaalicus grows to a length of , and is dark brown or black in colour, so it is also known as the Black Thick-Tailed scorpion. Its pincers are thin, but its tail is thickened, with the sting segment being as wide as the rest of the tail. It is nocturnal, resting in a shallow burrow under rocks during the day. It resembles its congener P.Â villosus, which is less strictly nocturnal, hairier and has a more westerly distribution.

Distribution
Parabuthus transvaalicus is found in deserts, scrublands and semi-arid regions of Botswana, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, some parts of the Namib Desert and South Africa.

Sting
Parabuthus transvaalicus is a dangerous medically significant scorpion, which can both sting and spray its kurtoxin venom. The first droplet of venom differs from the rest, and is referred to as "pre-venom". A further potassium channel inhibitor, Parabutoxin, has been isolated from the venom of P. transvaalicus.
