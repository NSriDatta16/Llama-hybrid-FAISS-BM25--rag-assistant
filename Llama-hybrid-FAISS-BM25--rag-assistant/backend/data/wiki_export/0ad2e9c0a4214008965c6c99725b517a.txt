Nawanshahr became a district in 1995 during the S. Harcharan Brar government, with strong efforts of the late S. Dilbag Singh, former Cabinet Minister and the then MLA of Nawanshahr. People of this district are economically sound. Many of the district's families have settled abroad. Consequently, much remittance is sent back to India, contributing to the district's economic development and prosperity. The prosperity of Doaba area can be appreciated by the fact that the price of land here is high, and far more than most of the districts in the state except Ludhiana and Chandigarh. Nawanshahr is rising due to the remittances from overseas Punjabis. Nawanshahr is connected to Jalandhar, Rahon and Jaijon by railway.

On 27 September 2008 at Khatkar Kalan, 8Â km from Nawanshahr, the Punjab government announced that a district in the state would be named after the freedom fighter Bhagat Singh. The announcement was made by Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal to mark the 101st anniversary of Bhagat Singh's birth. As a result, Nawanshahr district was renamed Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar.
