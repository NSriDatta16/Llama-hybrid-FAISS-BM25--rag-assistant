When Arizona became a state in 1912, it was allocated a single seat in the United States House of Representatives, whose member was elected at-large, or statewide.

Arizona was represented by a single member of the House until the 1940 census gave Arizona a second seat. However, both members continued to be elected statewide (on a general ticket) until 1949.
