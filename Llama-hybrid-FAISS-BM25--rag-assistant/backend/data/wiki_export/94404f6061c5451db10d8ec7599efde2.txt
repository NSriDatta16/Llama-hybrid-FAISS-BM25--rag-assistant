Wilhelminaoord is a village in the Dutch province of Drenthe. It is a part of the municipality of Westerveld, and lies about 26Â km northwest of Hoogeveen.

Wilhelminaoord was one of the farming colonies established by the Society of Benevolence in 1821 to decrease poverty by providing sustainable employment for able-bodied poor people. Along with the other colonies constructed by the Society, it was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2021 because of its testimony to a unique method of housing reform and its urban planning.  The settlement was named after Wilhelmina of Prussia.

The Colony Church is a Dutch Reformed church which dates from 1853. Attendance used to be mandatory. In 2009, it was decommissioned and is nowadays used for weddings, conferences and parties.
