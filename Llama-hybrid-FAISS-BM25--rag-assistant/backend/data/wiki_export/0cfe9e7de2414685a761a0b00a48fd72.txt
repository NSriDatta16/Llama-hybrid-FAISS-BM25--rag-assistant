History and operations
The family-owned company was founded by David and Charles Malka. It began Canadian distribution of shoes in the 1970s, followed by the U.S. distribution of European shoes in 1987. Their first retail store opened at the CÃ´te-des-Neiges Plaza in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in the early 1970s.

In the spring of 2004, Charles David launched their lower price lines, Charles by Charles David and Exchange by Charles David.
