"That's All" is a 1952 song written by Alan Brandt with music by Bob Haymes. It has been covered by many jazz and blues artists. The first recording, by Nat King Cole in 1953, achieved some popularity but was not among that year's top 20 songs. It was Bobby Darin's version from his 1959 album of the same title that introduced the song to a wider audience, and it has since become a jazz standard.

It was used as theme and bumper music, and as background behind live advertising announcements, on the overnight classical music program, American Airlines Music Til Dawn, which ran on clear-channel AM radio stations, mostly but not all CBS, from 1953 to 1970.

The song is part of the Great American Songbook, and Alec Wilder included it in his book American Popular Song: The Great Innovators, 1900–1950, even though it was composed two years after that period. Wilder gave two reasons for making this exception: (1) "it is one of the last free-flowing, native, and natural melodies in the grand pop style"; (2) "it went through no initial hit phase but became an immediate standard".
