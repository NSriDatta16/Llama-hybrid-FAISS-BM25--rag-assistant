South Lancaster Academy (SLA) is a co-educational preparatory day school, consisting of grades Preschool through 12, operated by Seventh-day Adventists in South Lancaster, Massachusetts.
It is a part of the Seventh-day Adventist education system, the world's second largest Christian school system.

History 

On April 19, 1882, the "New England School", yet unnamed, opened its doors.  Nineteen students started classes and five more joined these a few days later. Stephen Nelson Haskell (1833-1922) was the founder and builder of the school; Goodloe Harper Bell (1832-1899) was the first principal.  The following year in 1883, the school was named South Lancaster Academy.

In 1885, the school expanded to include college preparatory.  Teacher training was added in 1886, with development of a "normal school", the J. T. Browning Missionary and Industrial School.

In 1918, its standing as a junior college was formally recognized and the school name was changed to Lancaster Junior College.

In 1922 degree-granting powers were conferred by the Massachusetts legislature.  Once more the school's name was changed to Atlantic Union College with the school beginning to operate on the senior college level, offering a four-year theological course.  During the same period the college became a separate institute with the academy having its own board of trustees and faculty.

Since 1967, South Lancaster Academy has been a twelve-grade school.  The academy attempts to maintain the historic ideals of Seventh-day Adventists on matters of morals, dress, and conduct, as its reasons for existence.  South Lancaster Academy is operated by the SDA churches of Atlantic Union College, Leominster, South Lancaster Village, and Sterling.  South Lancaster Academy is operated by the Southern New England Conference of Seventh-day Adventists and the Atlantic Union Conference of Seventh-day Adventists.
