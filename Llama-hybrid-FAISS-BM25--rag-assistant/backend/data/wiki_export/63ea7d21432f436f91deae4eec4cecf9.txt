Inhale/Exhale is the first album by the Swedish grindcore band Nasum. It was released on 26 May 1998 by Relapse Records.

The album has been credited with reviving the grindcore scene, following a period of downturn in the 1990s. Napalm Death have also credited the album for encouraging them to return to their faster, grindcore roots with Enemy of the Music Business (2000).
