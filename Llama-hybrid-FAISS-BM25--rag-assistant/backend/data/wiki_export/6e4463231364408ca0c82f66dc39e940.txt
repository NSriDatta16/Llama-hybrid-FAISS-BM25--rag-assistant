Parish
Goldsworth Park is a parish of the Church of England created to serve the Goldsworth Park estate which has diverse housing, parks, gardens and roads laid out on a sparsely populated greenfield area. The parish page on the church's web site states that Goldsworth Park was designed as a “garden estate”.

The parish is bounded by St John's and Woking to the south, and by Knaphill and Horsell to the west and north-east.

Parish history
From the Domesday Book of 1086 (and possibly earlier) until 1884, Goldsworth Park was part of the parish of Woking, which in 1848 "comprise[d] 10,000 acres [] by computation".  St John the Baptist Church, 'Goldsworth' built of stone in 13th-century style, was designed by George Gilbert Scott in 1842 (later knighted), and enlarged in 1879 and 1883, and in the year after what was considered St John's, Goldsworth gained the status of a parish.

In the 20th century the area around that church became widely known as St Johns and the large north-western portion of its area which broke off in 1988 to be the parish of the new church took up a variant of the old name of the district, chosen by the area's developers.
