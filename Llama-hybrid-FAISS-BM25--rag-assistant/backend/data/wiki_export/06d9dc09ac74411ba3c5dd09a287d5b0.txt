SexTV was an award-winning, internationally-syndicated Canadian documentary television series that explored all facets of human sexuality and gender in a thought-provoking and cutting-edge way. Founded by the Canadian media executive Moses Znaimer, the show premiered on national broadcast television in 1999 on Citytv and ran for ten seasons (1999-2008). Citytv was a trailblazing, local TV station in Toronto with independent origins and ground-breaking content. The station was home to other well-known shows at the time including Much (TV channel) (Much Music), FashionTelevision, the Space Channel (re-branded as CTV Sci-Fi Channel) and Bravo's 'Arts and Minds'  (rebranded as CTV Drama Channel). CityTV was the first independent television station in Toronto and the producers of these shows (including SexTV) worked in the iconic and heritage building 299 Queen Street West in the city's downtown core.

With the increasing popularity of the television show and the move to digital television, SexTV, the show developed into a documentary television channel called SexTV: The Channel in 2001.

Airing in a late-night time slot, SexTV, the docu-series, covered a broad and complex array of topics relating to sex, sexuality and gender in an intelligent and non-sensationalistic way.

The critically-acclaimed series ran for ten seasons and received eight Gemini Award nominations (now called Canadian Screen Awards over the course of its run, winning Best Lifestyle/General Interest Series at the 19th Gemini Awards in 2004.

The series used the Canadian music legend Leonard Cohen's song, "Ain't No Cure for Love", as its theme music; Cohen and Znaimer were friends.

Exploring a broad range of topics for the first time on public broadcast television including female masturbation, the show was feminist, ethnographic and part of the sex-positive movement.
