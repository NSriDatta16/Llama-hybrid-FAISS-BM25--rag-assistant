History

After the opening of the Portal de Usme in early 2001, the Autopista Norte line was opened. This station was added as a northerly expansion of that line, which was completed with the opening of the Portal del Norte later that year.

The station is named Calle 142 due to its location near that road, though it serves the Cedritos area.

On March 7, 2011, an articulated bus crashed into one of their wagons. Ten people were injured and the station suffered damage.
