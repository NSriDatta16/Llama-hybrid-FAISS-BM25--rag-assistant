Band director controversy

In 2018, long time band director, Eric Wheeler,  was fired from the district after it was discovered that he had sent inappropriate text messages to two female students. His teaching license was later revoked because of this.

Mascot controversy
On June 6, 2020, a petition was started on Change.org by to remove the Savage mascot due to its racist connotations. The use of terms and images referring to Native Americans and First Nations as the name or mascot for a sports team is a topic of public controversy in the United States and Canada. The American Psychological Association, United States Commission on Civil Rights, and The National Conference for Community and Justice are among those who have called for a ban on Native American mascots. Such mascots are said to misrepresent, distort, and trivialize many aspects of Native American culture; and mascot stereotypes have a negative impact on Native American lives.

A counter-petition was launched on June 29. The Savannah R3 School District's Board of Education met on July 14, 2020, in an open meeting in which community members voiced their opinions on the issue. Previous attempts to change the mascot have been made, notably in 1993 and 2018. On October 14, 2020, the Board of Education voted to create a committee to determine the fate of the mascot. On March 22, 2021, the committee returned with a tie vote, 4-4, in favor of changing or keeping the mascot, pushing the decision back to the school board. Finally, on April 14, 2021, the Savannah R3 School board voted to keep the "Savages" name but phase out the use of Native American imagery, in a 4-3 vote that concluded with one board member resigning on the spot.
