He was celebrated for his Talmudic and kabbalistic learning, and was the teacher of Chaim Joseph David Azulai (the Chida). Nabon wrote several works, of which only two have been published, namely:
Nechpah ba-Kesef (vol. i, Constantinople, 1748; vol. ii, Jerusalem, 1843), responsa; and
 Get Mekushar, on divorce, in the form of a commentary on "Get Pashut," a work on the same subject by Moses ibn Habib.
