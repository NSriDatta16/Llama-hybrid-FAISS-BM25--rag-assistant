Coast Mountain College (CMTN) is an accredited, publicly funded post-secondary educational institution that serves the communities of British Columbia's northwest region. CMTN offers field schools, college access, trades, university credit, health and human services programs. The college is a member of the University of the Arctic network, and Colleges and Institutes Canada (CiCan).

History
The British Columbia Vocational School, Terrace began construction in 1965.  The school opened in September 1968, with 1968-69 enrolment reaching 295 students. An official opening was held August 11, 1970.  Northwest College was established on the site in 1975. The name was soon changed to Northwest Community College (NWCC) and was renamed Coast Mountain College on June 18, 2018.

The college had a full-time equivalent student enrolment of 1,271 students in 2011/12. Significant layoffs occurred in 2012  following deficits of over $1.4 million in 2011 and $2.1 million in 2012. The layoffs were grieved. In 2014 an arbitrator ruled the collective agreement had not been followed in the layoff process, by which time enrolment had dropped by nearly 25% to 970.

A new president joined the college in 2014 bringing a rebranding strategy and increased focus on international students.  Th college's traditionl thunderbird logo was phased out. By 2019 FTE student enrolment had dropped to 699 students.

Totem poles and traditional art which reflect the history of the surrounding territories and peoples are displayed on the college campuses and have been commissioned for groups outside the region, including organizations in the United States and China. In 1996 CMTN established the First Nations Council to facilitate direct contact with Indigenous communities.

The college connected to the Provincial Learning Network (PLNET) in 2003. In 2019 the college transitioned to BCNET's Advanced Network, completing the connection of all BC post-secondary institutions.

The college is named for the Coast Mountains mountain chain it's territory resides in.  The 1600 km range that extends from the Fraser River lowlands to the Yukon. The range is crossed by roads in only 8 places.  These include the Hwy 37 between Kitimat and Terrace, Hwy 16 between Prince Rupert and Terrace (also a rail route), and Hwy 37A between Stewart and Meziadin Junction.  The area is home to notable glaciers such as Salmon Glacier and some of the world's longest fjords including the Douglas Channel, Khutzeymateen Inlet, Prince Rupert Harbour, and the 115 km long Portland Canal.

Coast Mountain College (CMTN) has campuses in five northwest British Columbia communities: Hazelton; Haida Gwaii; Prince Rupert; Smithers; and Terrace.

Aboriginal

Coast Mountain College (CMTN) serves the people of northwest British Columbia, in a region that includes the lands of the Haida, Tsimshian, Nisga'a, Haisla, Gitxsan, Wet'suwet'en, and Tahltan peoples. CMTN through its First Nations Council, has entered into a relationship with the Nisga'a Wilp Wilxo'oskwhl Nisga'a (“Nisga'a House of Learning”) to promote and enable resident of the Nass Valley region to obtain post-secondary education.

In 2020, CMTN added support for Indigenous Students to combat COVID-19.  Indigenous students accessing college programs or services are supported by a team of First Nations Access Coordinators.  In February 2022, CMTN's Freda Diesing School of Northwest Coast Art alumna, artist Kristen McKay, was the winner of a Pink Shirt Day design contest held by the First Nations Access Coordinators (FNAC), that is now being distributed across all campuses in the region.

Freda Diesing School of Northwest Coast Art

The Freda Diesing School of Northwest Coast Art focuses on traditional First Nations Pacific Northwest Coast art.  Named after the Haida artist Freda Diesing, one of the first female carvers on the modern Northwest coast, aka Kant Wuss, Skill-kew-wat & Wee-hwe-doasl, who was born in the Sadsugohilanes Clan of the Haida in British Columbia to Flossie and Frank Johnson.  Her Haida name, Skill-kew-wat, translates roughly as Magical Little Woman.  At the age of 42, she undertook woodcarving apprenticeships under artists including Robert Davidson (artist). In 2000, she was awarded an honorary doctorate from Coast Mountain College.  In 2002, she received an National Aboriginal Achievement Award and honorary doctorate from the University of Northern British Columbia.

The school was opened in the Fall of 2006 by one of Freda's students Dempsey Bob. The school focuses on carving in the Northern Style, with drawing, painting, art history and tool-making courses supporting the carving component of the school.  CMTN offers a certificate and degree program in First Nations Fine Art through the Freda Diesing School of Northwest Coast Art at the Terrace campus.  This program is the first of its kind in North America, offering accredited courses recognized by the Emily Carr University of Art and Design.  In 2021 Tahltan-Tlingit master carver, and senior advisor to the Freda Diesing School, Dempsey Bob, was one of six artists across Canada to be recognized with a 2021 Governor General's Awards in Visual and Media Arts Artistic Achievement Award.

Starting in the 2021/22 academic year, students who complete the First Nations Fine Arts Diploma with a GPA of B are eligible for acceptance into the third year of the Bachelor of Fine Arts degree program at Emily Carr University of Art and Design.
