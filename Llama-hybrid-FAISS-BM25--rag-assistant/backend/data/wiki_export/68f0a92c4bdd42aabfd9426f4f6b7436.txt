Name
Formerly known as Kızılören, renamed Uğurludağ after Urlu Mountain which stands behind the town. The name means 'lucky mountain' and is traditionally a place of healing. Other than some caves said to inhabit healing spirits there is little of historical or archaeological interest. But the mountain scenery, with the snow on the peak even in summer, does attract visitors.
