"Search and Destroy" is a song by American rock band the Stooges, recorded for the group's third album Raw Power (1973). Lead singer Iggy Pop said that the title was derived from a column heading in a Time article about the Vietnam War. In 1997, "Search and Destroy" (along with the rest of the songs on Raw Power) was remixed and remastered by Pop and Bruce Dickinson. The result was far more aggressive and stripped down than the original release, which had been mixed by David Bowie.

In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked "Search and Destroy" at No. 468 on their list of "The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time". In 2009, it was named the 49th best hard rock song of all time by VH1.  The song has also been characterized as garage rock, glam rock and proto-punk.
