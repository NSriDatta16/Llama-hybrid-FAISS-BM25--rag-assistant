"Grown and Sexy" is the third US single and second international single from Chamillionaire's album, The Sound of Revenge. The music video is set up to have a futuristic feel to it.

Chamillionaire's appearances on Ciara's "Get Up" and Frankie J.'s "That Girl" have proven to be successful singles as well as charting No.1 with Ridin'. However, the single failed to chart anywhere in the U.S., but did chart in the UK, peaking at #35, much smaller peak than that of "Ridin" which made #2 there. It charted In the Piczo Countdown at #7 In November 2006.
