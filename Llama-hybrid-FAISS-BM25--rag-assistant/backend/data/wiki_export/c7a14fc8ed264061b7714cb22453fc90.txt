History
The city was founded on February 9, 1929, when a group of 18 people founded a Spiritist center called Luz da Verdade.  These people had converted to Spiritism after seeing the alleged cure of a medium, Dorcelino Damásio da Silva, who had suffered from a disease called fogo selvagem.  In 1953 Palmelo became a municipality separating from Pires do Rio.  It is probably the only town in Brazil and in the world where most of the inhabitants are Spiritists.
