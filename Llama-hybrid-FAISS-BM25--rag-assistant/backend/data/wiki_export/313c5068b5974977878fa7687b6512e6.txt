Glasgow Maryhill was a constituency of the Scottish Parliament (Holyrood). It elected one Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) by the plurality (first past the post) method of election. However, it was also one of ten constituencies in the Glasgow electoral region, which elects seven additional members, in addition to ten constituency MSPs, to produce a form of proportional representation for the region as a whole.

For the Scottish Parliament election, 2011 Maryhill was expanded into a newly created Maryhill and Springburn seat.

Electoral region 

The other nine constituencies of the Glasgow region at the time were: Glasgow Anniesland, Glasgow Baillieston, Glasgow Cathcart, Glasgow Govan, Glasgow Kelvin, Glasgow Pollok, Glasgow Rutherglen, Glasgow Shettleston and Glasgow Springburn.

The region covered the Glasgow City council area and a north-western portion of the South Lanarkshire council area.

Constituency boundaries 

The Glasgow Maryhill constituency was created at the same time as the Scottish Parliament, in 1999, with the name and boundaries of an  existing Westminster constituency. In 2005, however, Scottish Westminster (House of Commons) constituencies were mostly replaced with new constituencies.

The Holyrood constituency was entirely within the Glasgow City council area, on its northern boundary. It was west of the Springburn constituency, north of Kelvin and east of Anniesland, which were also entirely within the city area.

Boundary review 

Following their First Periodic review into constituencies to the Scottish Parliament in time for the 2011 election, the Boundary Commission for Scotland has recommended the effective merger of the Glasgow Springburn and Glasgow Maryhill constituencies. The new creation is a constituency known as Glasgow Maryhill and Springburn.
