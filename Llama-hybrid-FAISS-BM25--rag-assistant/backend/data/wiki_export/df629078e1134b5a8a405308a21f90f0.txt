The 42nd Armoured Division was an armoured division of the British Army raised during the Second World War.

History

War Service
The division was formed in late 1941 by converting the 42nd (East Lancashire) Infantry Division. The 42nd Division was a 1st Line Territorial Army (TA) infantry formation that saw service in the Battle of France and was evacuated at Dunkirk in June 1940. The division was converted on 1 November 1941 into an armoured division. The division's first commander was Major-General Miles C. Dempsey.

However, the division was not posted overseas and its divisional headquarters was disbanded on 17 October 1943; the division's infantry was assigned to the 53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division and its armour to the 79th Armoured Division.

General Officer Commanding
Two men served as the General Officer Commanding of the 42nd Armoured Division:
 Major-General Miles Dempsey: November 1941-December 1942
 Major-General John Aldam Aizlewood: December 1942-October 1943
