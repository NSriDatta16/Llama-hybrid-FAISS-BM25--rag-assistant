Culture and sightseeing

Libraries

Library at the Überwald-Gymnasium
In autumn 2007, the Überwald-Gymnasium opened its new library MIZ (Medien- und Infozentrum – “Media and Infocentre”). This may be used not only by students, but as of April 2008 also by all citizens of the surrounding municipalities.

Museums

Heimatmuseum 
The Heimatmuseum (local history museum) has been housed since 1988 at the old town hall (Altes Rathaus) right in the heart of the community. The building was built in 1594. On display here are not only items from Wald-Michelbach's historical development but sometimes also special exhibits.

Stoewermuseum 
The Stoewermuseum was opened in 2002 and is housed in the building that formerly housed the old savings bank, near the heart of the community. On show here is a collection of products from the Stoewer works in Stettin (now Szczecin, Poland). The museum's centrepiece is the array of cars on display on the ground floor. Most have been restored and are in operating condition. Furthermore, more of the Stoewer company's products, such as sewing machines, typewriters and bicycles, can also be seen. The museum is run privately by a collector who was born in Stettin. In 2005, in honour of the owner and his dedication, a street in the main community was christened Stoewerstraße. It is planned to move the Stoewermuseum back to its origins in Stettin (Szczecin), Poland.

Buildings
The Überwälder Einhaus was completed in 2005 by the Überwälder Museums- und Kulturverein (“Überwald Museum and Culture Club”) and unpaid help. The name Einhaus (“Onehouse”) refers to how such buildings were formerly used: a single building contained a dwelling, a storage cellar, a stable and a barn. Today, though, this one houses a civil wedding venue and a sizeable multipurpose room used by the community's clubs for social occasions. In 2006, the Bücherbrunnen (“Book Fountain”) was also built before the Einhaus. On that spot, until the 19th century, when it was torn down, once stood a town tower in which, in Adam Karrillon’s novel Michael Hely was the hero’s home. The books displayed at the fountain are meant to remind one of the spot’s literary importance.

 Gassenmarkt (“Lane Market”)
