Name 
The town has been called by both the names Islamabad and Anantnag. The latter is characterised by Marc Aurel Stein as its "Hindu name".

"Anantnag" derives from the name of the spring at the southern end of the town, whose Sanskrit name  was mentioned in the Nilamata Purana and other texts. According to the Gazetteer of Kashmir and Ladak, it is named after Ananta, the great serpent of Vishnu and the emblem of eternity.

The name Islamabad is believed to have derived from the name of a Mughal governor Islam Khan who built a garden in the area.

Both names are used for the town, Anantnag being preferred by the Hindus and Sikhs while Islamabad is preferred by the Muslims. The locals continue to use the name Islamabad, even though the Indian security forces deployed in the area from 1998 onwards frown on its use.

During the Dogra rule, Anantnag/Islamabad was the headquarters of one of Kashmir Valley's three districts, which was referred to as the "Anantnag wazarat".
