The International Gymnastics Hall of Fame, located in Oklahoma City, USA, is a hall of fame dedicated to honoring the achievements and contributions of the world's greatest competitors, coaches and authorities in artistic gymnastics.

The early IGHOF was founded in 1972 by Frank Wells of the National Gymnastics Clinic. It had only one member, Olga Korbut, and disbanded in the late 1970s. The current museum was founded in 1986 by Glenn Sundby, publisher of the International Gymnast Magazine. Initially located in Oceanside, California, it was moved into Oklahoma City in 1997.

The Hall of Fame is housed inside the Science Museum Oklahoma, formerly called the Omniplex.
