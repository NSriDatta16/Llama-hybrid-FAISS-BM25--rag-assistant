Walk, Don't Run, Vol. 2 is the 16th studio album by The Ventures, released in 1964. It features "Walk Don't Run '64," an updated recording of the Johnny Smith cover; as a single, it would be the second time the band had a Top 10 hit in the U.S. with that same composition. The album also includes a rendition of blues classic "The House of the Rising Sun," and "Rap City," the Ventures' arrangement of Brahms' Hungarian Dance No. 5.

Background

The original Walk, Don't Run album cover from 1960 featured employees from Liberty Records' stockroom (subbing for The Ventures who were on tour at the time), falling over instruments behind a walking model. For the new album, the genuine group is shown on the floor in more relaxed poses. The model standing in front of them is Nancy Bacon, who was guitarist Don Wilson's wife at the time.

The new Walk, Don't Run, Vol. 2 album was another hit for The Ventures, peaking at #17 on Billboard and #18 on Cashbox.

Reception

In his review for Allmusic, critic Fred Thomas called the album "the standard Ventures experience, though a bit on the livelier side in its song selections... All said, most Ventures records are pretty similar, but the bright moments on Walk, Don't Run, Vol. 2 hint at the band relaxing and having a little bit more fun than usual."
