Synopsis
Tony tells Dr. Melfi that he is angry with everybody, but doesn't know why; he wants to hit her, and the happy-looking people he sees in the street. Tony is told by Uncle Junior that he and Tony's father had a deceased brother, Ercole, who was, in Junior's words, "slow". He also tells him that his father left a "package" of money to his mother, Livia. Tony is uncomfortable when he sees Livia at a funeral and later during a cabaret night at Meadow's high school.

Davey Scatino is a former classmate of Tony's who owns a sporting goods store; his son, Eric, is a classmate of Meadow's and they are going to sing a duet at the school's cabaret night. Davey, a compulsive gambler, owes Richie Aprile $8,000 and has been banned from Richie's poker game until the debt has been paid. Davey knows that Tony has taken over the high-stakes "Executive Game" from Junior and asks to participate. Davey comes to the game uninvited, at which point Tony agrees and loans him $5,000. Davey initially wins and the game goes on through the night while Tony is asleep.

Tony wakes in the morning and is told by Christopher that Davey is down $45,000 after talking his way into more loans. Richie comes to the room, sees Davey playing, and attacks him, which causes the game to break up. For this act of disrespect, Tony tells Richie that he is not permitted to collect his debt from Davey until Tony has collected his. Janice tells Richie he has a right to stand up to Tony. Davey attempts to talk to Tony as a friend, but Tony rebuffs him.

When Davey misses the first deadline for payment, Tony goes to his office at the store and beats him. Davey finds a pretext to take Eric's SUV away from him and gives it to Tony as partial payment. Tony presents it to Meadow, but she realizes it belongs to Eric and tearfully rejects it. At the cabaret night, Eric refuses at the last minute to perform with Meadow and walks out, leaving Meadow to perform a solo, as she had wished.

Title reference
 The episode's title refers to a "happy wanderer", a person who walks around with no worries in the world, whom Tony despises.

Production
 Though this is Joseph R. Gannascoli's first appearance as Vito, he previously had appeared briefly as Gino, a bakery customer, in a scene during the first season episode, "The Legend of Tennessee Moltisanti." He would not be credited as a main cast member until Season 6. 
 Tony Sirico's real-life older brother Carmine appears as the nameless "Dealer" in Aprile's small-stakes poker game. His few words of dialogue are spoken off camera.

Cultural references
 Junior says Ercole was a derivation of Hercules, and that Ercole was strong like a bull and handsome like George Raft.
 Silvio becomes increasingly agitated during a losing night of poker, finally explodes after Matt Bevilaqua sweeps up crumbs near him, and yells at Tony: "I'm losin' my balls over here. This fuckin' moron's playing Hazel?" Hazel was a hit 1960s TV show starring Shirley Booth as a maid.
 When Eric Scatino opts out of performing the "Sun and Moon" duet with Meadow, the emcee announces that Meadow will, instead, sing the solo "My Heart Will Go On", from the 1997 film Titanic. Also, during the "Executive Game" of poker, Paulie makes a joke about Viagra being used to "raise" the real Titanic. Tony once again mentions his role model, actor Gary Cooper, to Dr. Melfi.

Music
  The song sung by Gudren, the blonde soprano, after Meadow and Eric's on-stage rehearsal and again at the beginning of the concert, is "Gretchen am Spinnrade" by Franz Schubert.
 The Muzak version of "Spinning Wheel" by Blood, Sweat, & Tears is playing in the store when Richie comes to collect payment from Davey. Paulie later misquotes this song in the season six episode Stage 5.
 When Eric picks up Meadow, he is listening to "Down" by Stone Temple Pilots.
 The duet that Meadow and Eric are practicing is "Sun and Moon" from the musical Miss Saigon''.
 The song "Love Is Strange" by Mickey & Sylvia is playing in the background when Davey goes to Artie's restaurant seeking a loan from him.
 The song "Tequila Sunrise" by Eagles is playing in the store when Tony goes to collect his first payment from Davey.
 The song played over the closing credits is a version of "The Happy Wanderer" sung by Frankie Yankovic.
