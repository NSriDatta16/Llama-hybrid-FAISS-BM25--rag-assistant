Intelligencer Journal 

First printed in 1794 as the Lancaster Journal, the Intelligencer Journal was the largest circulation newspaper in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and the oldest continuously published newspaper in the United States of America that had not changed its name.

Lancaster New Era 
The Lancaster New Era was founded in 1877 with the goal of taking the state Republican machine to task. In 1920, New Era merged with another Republican newspaper, The Examiner. Paul Block Sr. bought the New Era-Examiner three years later and positioned it to compete with the morning Intelligencer and afternoon New Journal, both published by the Steinmans. When the venture failed in 1928, Block sold the paper, now named New Era, to the Steinmans, who merged the Intell and Journal into the morning Intelligencer Journal and published New Era as an afternoon newspaper on every day of the week except Sunday. The Saturday edition was eliminated in 2007 and associated content moved to the Saturday-morning edition of Intell.

By 2009, New Era had the largest circulation of any Pennsylvania newspaper in the afternoon newspaper market.
It won the Pennsylvania NewsMedia Association Sweepstakes Award four years in a row. Its reporting on the West Nickel Mines School shooting in eastern Lancaster County won numerous state and national awards, among them the Pulliam National Journalism Writing Award and the Taylor Award for Fairness from the Nieman Foundation for Journalism.

On 26 June 2009, Lancaster Newspapers published the final afternoon edition of New Era, citing increasing costs and decreasing readership, and merged it with the Intelligencer Journal. Columns, comics and other syndicated content previously reserved for the afternoon edition now appear in the Journal.

The Sunday News 
Established in 1923 as the first local Sunday newspaper in Lancaster County, The Sunday News was renamed Sunday LNP in October 2014.

La Voz Lancaster 
La Voz Lancaster (formerly La Voz Hispana) is a bi-monthly news source for the Hispanic population of Lancaster County.

Editorial stance
The Intell traditionally retained a center-left editorial stance, while the New Era was reliably conservative. For five years after the papers merged, the combined publication ran two distinct editorial pages. In 2014, however, Lancaster Newspapers adopted an independent stance, publishing a single editorial page thereafter.

LNP

Under its current masthead, LNP was first published in October 2014 with the tagline "Always Lancaster." The newsroom combines journalists from The Intelligencer Journal, New Era and Sunday News.

LancasterOnline 
LancasterOnline is a subscription service that provides access to all features in the daily newspaper and a searchable digital archive of all content published in the newspaper's history.
