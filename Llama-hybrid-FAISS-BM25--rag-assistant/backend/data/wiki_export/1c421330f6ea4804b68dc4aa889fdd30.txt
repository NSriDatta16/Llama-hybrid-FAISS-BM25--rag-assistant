Rābia al-Adawiyya al-Qaysiyya (; 801 CE) was an Arab Muslim saint and Sufi mystic and was an influential religious figure. She is known in some parts of the world as Hazrat Rabia Basri, Rabia Al Basri or simply Rabia Basri. She is considered by Muslims to be an example of piety and is a small part of the complicated early history of Islam.

Biography
Rabia is said to have been born between 714 and 718 CE (95 and 98 AH) in Basra, Iraq, of the Qays tribe. Attar of Nishapur, a later Sufi saint and poet, recounted much of her early life.  

She was the fourth daughter of her family and so was called Rabia "the Fourth". According to Attar of Nishapur, whose account is more myth than historical narrative, when Rabia was born, her parents were so poor that there was no oil in the house to light a lamp, nor even a cloth to wrap her with. Her mother asked her husband to borrow some oil from a neighbor, but he had resolved in his life never to ask for anything from anyone except God. He pretended to go to the neighbor's door and returned home empty-handed. At night Muhammad appeared to him in a dream and told him,

However, after the death of her father, famine overtook Basra. She parted from her sisters and went into the desert to pray and become an ascetic, living a life of semi-seclusion. She is often cited as being the queen of saintly women, and was known for her complete devotion or "pure unconditional love of God". As an exemplar among others devoted to God, she provided a model of mutual love between God and His creation; her example is one in which the loving devotee on earth becomes one with the Beloved.

She prayed:

Rabia died in her eighties in Basra in 801 CE (185 AH), where her tomb was shown outside the city. However, Rabia's main modern biographer Rkia Elaroui Cornell says the datings of her birth and death "come from a much later period and the ultimate source of these dates is unclear." Her life records stem mainly from historical narratives. Rabia is thought of today as a saint because of her contributions to Sufism and her devotion to God.

Philosophy and religious contributions
Often noted as having been the single most famous and influential renunciant women of Islamic history, Rabia was renowned for her extreme virtue and piety. A devoted ascetic, when asked why she performed a thousand ritual prostrations both during the day and at night, she answered:

I desire no reward for it; I do it so that the Messenger of God, may God bless him and give him peace, will delight in it on the day of Resurrection and say to the prophets, 'Take note of what a woman of my community has accomplished.'

She was intense in her self-denial and devotion to God. She never claimed to have achieved unity with Him; instead, she dedicated her life to getting closer to God. As an explanation of her refusal to lift her head toward the heavens (to God) as an act of modesty, she used to say: "Were the world the possession of a single man, it would not make him rich ... because it is passing away."

She was the first to set forth the doctrine of divine love known as Ishq-e-Haqeeqi and is widely considered being the most important of the early renunciants, a form of piety that would eventually be labeled Sufism.

Rabia's teachings had a lasting impact on the religious world, as noted by many religious scholars. One non-Sufi account by Abu Uthman Al-Jahiz referred to her as highly respected, and someone people went to for guidance. Another reference by Abi Tahir Tayfur of Baghdad remembers her always having something important to say. 

She was well known for having a powerful love for God and devoting her life to him. She was beloved not only by many for her spiritual guidance but for her ethics as well. She promoted the idea of loving God for being God, not for reward. 

Among her most notable qualities besides her devotion to God are her humility and celibacy. Living alone and in love with only God, she is idolized by many for her religious passion and the example she set for the growing Muslim population. She is also said to be the founder of Islamic love mysticism.

Poetry and myths
Much of the poetry that is attributed to her is of unknown origin. There is no evidence in the historical archive that Rabia ever met Hasan al-Basri; however the following myth, which first appeared in Attar of Nishapur's Tadhkirat al-Awliya, is a common trope in the modern period: After a life of hardship, she spontaneously achieved a state of self-realization. She was chosen by Allah to perform divine miracles. When asked by Shaikh Hasan al-Basri, how she discovered the secret, she responded by stating "you know of the how, but I know of the how-less."

One of the many myths that surround her life is that she was freed from slavery because her master saw her praying while surrounded by light, realized that she was a saint and feared for his life if he continued to keep her as a slave.

Biographer Rkia Elaroui Cornell discovered four main tropes of her mythologization: Rabia the Teacher, Rabia the Ascetic, Rabia the Lover, and Rabia the Sufi.

Asceticism 
Rabia is often mythologized as an essential ascetic, where "the ascetic attains the Nonworld not by rejecting the World but by treating it as unimportant. The essential ascetic avoids the World not because it is evil per se but because it is a distraction from God."

As teacher 
Rabia was said to have a circle of disciples, including Maryam of Basra. Besides her disciples, she is regarded as a mentor to many emerging Muslims and guided people in their journey toward God and Sufi practices. 

While nothing physical is left, her impact on the lives of the people around her can be seen in the stories still told about her. For someone whose physical existence is unproved, the fact that her name is still known and respected today speaks volumes.

In feminist theory

Several aspects of Sufism suggest that Sufi ideologies and practices have stood as counters to dominant society and its perception of women and the relationships between men and women. The stories detailing the life and practices of Rabia show a countercultural understanding of the role of gender in society. Her role as a spiritual and intellectual superiority is depicted in several narratives. In a Sufi narrative, Sufi leader Hasan al-Basri explained, "I passed one whole night and day with Rabi'a ... it never passed through my mind that I was a man nor did it occur to her that she was a woman...when I looked at her I saw myself as bankrupt [i.e. as spiritually worth nothing] and Rabi'a as truly sincere [rich in spiritual virtue]." She decided to stay celibate in order to leave her womanhood behind and devote herself completely to God.

Legacy
There are no artifacts found written by or about Rabia during her lifetime. While there are various poems and pieces of writing under her name, the legitimacy of their origin is highly debated. Since there are no primary sources confirming her existence or writing, historians rely on the literature of other religious philosophers that came after her time and who wrote about her legacy. 

Because of the lack of eyewitness accounts and surviving evidence of her life, the historical Rabia is unknown. However, her importance and legacy remain prominent through tales of her life, modern references, and her standing in Muslim culture. While no physical evidence was found of her, Rabia's story and poetry remain an inspiration to women and Muslim people today.

Her teachings and example are influential for people of her time and Sufis today. They help narrate what Islam looked like throughout time and show what influential roles women have played in it.

In popular culture
Dilras Banu Begum (1622–1657) was the first wife and chief consort of Emperor Aurangzeb, the sixth Mughal emperor. She was given the posthumous title Rabia-ud-Daurani ("Rabia of the Age") in her honour.

The life of Rabia has been the subject of several motion pictures of Turkish cinema. One of these films, Rabia, released in 1973, was directed by Osman F. Seden, and Fatma Girik played the leading role of Rabia.

Rabia, İlk Kadın Evliya (Rabia, The First Woman Saint) is another Turkish film on Rabia. It was also released in 1973 and was directed by Süreyya Duru, starring Hülya Koçyiğit.

The Indonesian song "Jika Surga dan Neraka Tak Pernah Ada" sung by Ahmad Dhani and Chrisye on their 2004 album Senyawa, is based on Rabia's quotes about worshipping God out of love, not out of fear of punishment or desire for a reward.

Like any tale, small pieces of information can be elaborated upon by different people through the ages. While little is known about Rabia, it is crucial to be mindful of the human exaggeration or modifications possibly made through the passage of time.
