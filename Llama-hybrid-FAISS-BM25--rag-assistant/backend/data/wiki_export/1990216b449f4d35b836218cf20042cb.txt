The Panics is the second EP by Australian band, The Panics. It was released in July 2002 by littleBIGMAN Records. 

"This Day Last Year" was recorded by Steve Bond and Sid Eaton in April, 2002 at their home in Highgate, with the drums and bass recorded at Poons Head, Fremantle by Rob Grant.  "How's It Feel" and "Ghost Song" were recorded and mixed by Sid Eaton on Monmouth Street, North Perth in May, 2002.  "Mushroom Cloud" was recorded and mixed by Myles Wootton in March, 2002, and "The Way Home" was recorded by Steve Bond and Sid Eaton, with bass, drums and piano recorded by Rob Grant at Poons Head, Fremantle in May, 2002.

In April 2020, the EP was re-released to streaming media. Laffer said "I've just had a listen, again, probably not since we made it. I remember in these years we just kept recording, we had a great set up with dedicated friends Steve Bond and Sid Eaton always making themselves available, so we were always in someone's spare room, the whole band sat on someone's bed." Laffer added "I can hear myself trying way too hard at the microphone, but that was part of it at the time â€“ big, nervous energy and ideas, which often worked and sometimes were a shambles."
