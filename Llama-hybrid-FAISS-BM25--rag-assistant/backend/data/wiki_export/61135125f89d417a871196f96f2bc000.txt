Ig Nobel Prize
In 1993, Faid was awarded the Ig Nobel prize for Mathematics for calculating the exact odds (710,609,175,188,282,000 to 1) that Mikhail Gorbachev is the Antichrist, based on his 1988 book Gorbachev! Has the Real Antichrist Come?

On hearing about the award, Faid said "It's a serious book, not a joke... mathematically minded people use numbers to answer many questions, even questions that are not overtly mathematical."
