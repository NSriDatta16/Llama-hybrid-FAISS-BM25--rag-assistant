History
Narbonne dates back to 1925. The school was named for Nathaniel A. Narbonne, a sheep rancher, who owned most of the land in the Lomita and Harbor City area. The original building, from when Narbonne covered 7th through 12 grades, is in Lomita, and is now Alexander Fleming Middle School. In 1957, the new school was built on the present site at 242nd Place and Western Avenue.
