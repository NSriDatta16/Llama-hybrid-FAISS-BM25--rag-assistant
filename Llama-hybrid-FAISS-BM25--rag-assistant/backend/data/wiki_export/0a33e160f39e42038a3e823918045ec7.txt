With the exception of five new songs, "Rockin' at the Philharmonic," "Guitar Boogie," "In-Go," "How You've Changed," and "It Don't Take but a Few Minutes," and one alternate take, "Low Feeling", all tracks had been previously released on 45 rpm singles. It was also released in the United Kingdom. In 2012, Hoodoo reissued the album with Chuck Berry Is on Top on the same CD.
