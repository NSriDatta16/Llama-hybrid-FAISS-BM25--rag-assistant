Taxonomy
The scarlet-throated tanager was formally described in 1819 by the German naturalist Hinrich Lichtenstein under the binomial name Tanagra loricata. Lichtenstein based his description on the Jacap√∫ that had been described in 1648 by Georg Marcgrave. The type locality is northeastern Brazil. The scarlet-throated tanager is now the only member of the genus Compsothraupis that was introduced in 1915 by the American ornithologist Charles Wallace Richmond. The genus name is formed from the Ancient Greek kompsos meaning "pretty" with thraupis, an unknown small bird. In ornithology thraupis is used to signify a tanager. The specific epithet loricata is from the Latin loricatus  meaning "clothed in mail" or "breast-plated". The scarlet-throated tanager is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.
