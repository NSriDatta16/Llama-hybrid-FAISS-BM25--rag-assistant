Sør-Vågsøy is a former municipality in the old Sogn og Fjordane county in Norway.  The municipality existed from 1910 until 1964 and it encompassed the southern part of the island of Vågsøy and a small area on the mainland just east of the island. The area is now located in the present-day Kinn Municipality in Vestland county. The administrative centre of the municipality was Måløy, where Sør-Vågsøy Church is located.

History
Sør-Vågsøy was originally a part of the municipality of Selje (see formannskapsdistrikt law).  On 1 January 1910, the western part of the municipality of Selje was split off into the two new municipalities of Sør-Vågsøy and Nord-Vågsøy. Sør-Vågsøy had an initial population of 1,517.  On 1 July 1921, the Blesrød farm in Nord-Vågsøy (just north of Måløy) was transferred to Sør-Vågsøy. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the new Vågsøy Municipality was created by merging the municipalities of Sør-Vågsøy (population: 3,926) and Nord-Vågsøy (population: 1,476) with parts of the neighboring municipalities of Davik and Selje.
