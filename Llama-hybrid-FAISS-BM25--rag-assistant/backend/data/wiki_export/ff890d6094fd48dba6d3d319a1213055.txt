To date, it has widened its curriculum and developed itself into a fully integrated educational institute with arts, sciences, commercial and social sciences at all levels.

First foundation 
St. Paul's Secondary School owes its parentage to the Sisters of St. Paul de Chartres who arrived in Hong Kong from France in 1848. They became involved in local education soon after their arrival. They sponsored and ran St. Paul's Convent School in 1854 and their work of educational excellence became well known in Hong Kong.

Second foundation 
St. Paul's Secondary School was founded in 1960 by the Sisters of St. Paul of Chartres as an extension of St. Paul's Convent School to meet the growing needs of science education of girls in Hong Kong at secondary and matriculation levels.

Its former principal, Damian Lai, retired in 2006.

School hymn 

Refrain:
Hark! Daughters of the great St. Paul,
Come, listen to his call:
"O children of this loved school,
The loving nurse of all,
Rejoice in God, do work and pray;
Be true from day to day."

Beloved school of mine,
My pains and joys are thine,
My childhood's early dreams
Are closely linked with thee.
The hope that heaven brings
Thou dost unfold to me,
Thou dost unfold to me.

Sweet are the days of girlhood,
When friends we love and care,
Those golden links of childhood,
Whose sympathy we share.
Do stay and while the hours away,
With us in work and play.
And when we leave
Our dear old school
These mem'ries we'll recall,
These mem'ries we'll recall.
(Repeat Refrain)
