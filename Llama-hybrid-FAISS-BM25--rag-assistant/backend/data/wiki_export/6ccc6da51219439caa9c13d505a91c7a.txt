Synopsis

A brother and sister fell into a well, where a nixie caught them and made them work for her.  One Sunday while she was at church, they ran away.  The nixie chased them.  The girl threw a brush, which became a mountain with thousands of spikes, which the nixie got through with great effort.  The boy threw a comb behind them, which became mountains with thousands of teeth, which the nixie got through with great effort.  The girl threw a mirror behind them, which became a mountain too slick for the nixie to climb.  She went back to get an axe, but before she could chop through the mountain, they escaped.
