The Río Grande de Añasco is a river in western Puerto Rico.  Its source is in the Cordillera Central mountain range west of Adjuntas, and it flows about  westward to its mouth on the Mona Passage  north of Mayagüez. The river flows through the municipalities of Mayagüez, Añasco, San Sebastián and Las Marías. The taínos called it Río Guaorabo.

History

In the 1898 Military Notes on Puerto Rico by the U.S. it is written that the "Añasco River is formed by the Lares Mountain ridge. It rises in the eastern extremity of the mountains called Tetas de Cerro Gordo, flowing first northwest, and then west, through the town of its name and thence to the sea."

It is spanned by the Puente de Añasco, a bridge listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
