The Sobolev conjugate of p for , where n is space dimensionality, is

This is an important parameter in the Sobolev inequalities.

Motivation
A question arises whether u from the Sobolev space  belongs to  for some q > p. More specifically, when does  control ? It is easy to check that the following inequality

    

can not be true for arbitrary q. Consider , infinitely differentiable function with compact support. Introduce . We have that:

The inequality (*) for  results in the following inequality for 

If  then by letting  going to zero or infinity we obtain a contradiction. Thus the inequality (*) could only be true for

,

which is the Sobolev conjugate.
