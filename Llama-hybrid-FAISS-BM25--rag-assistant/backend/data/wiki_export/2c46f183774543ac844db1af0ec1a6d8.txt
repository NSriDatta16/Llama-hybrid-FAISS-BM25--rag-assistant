Bare is the third solo studio album by Scottish singer Annie Lennox, released in Europe on 5 June 2003 by 19 Recordings and RCA Records and in North America on 10 June 2003 by J Records. It peaked at number three on the UK Albums Chart and number four on the US Billboard 200. The album has been certified Gold in both the UK and the US and was nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 46th Grammy Awards.

The album was released with a DVD which included interviews and acoustic versions of songs by Lennox. The Japanese edition of the album features a version of Lennox's 1992 single "Cold" recorded live in Toronto.

Singles
No singles were released from the album in the United Kingdom, though "Pavement Cracks" and "Wonderful" were released as a CD maxi single and a limited CD single respectively in the United States, while "A Thousand Beautiful Things" was released as a radio-only single. No music videos were released for the songs, although one was recorded for "Pavement Cracks", but all three singles were remixed extensively and all reached number one on the US Hot Dance Club Play chart. However, the live versions of "A Thousand Beautiful Things" and "Pavement Cracks" were made as music videos instead and the videos were later included on The Annie Lennox Collection DVD.
