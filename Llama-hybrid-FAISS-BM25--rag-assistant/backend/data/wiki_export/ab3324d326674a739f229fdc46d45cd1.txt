Corrigan made his international debut against Canada in November 1997. He played for Ireland in the Rugby World Cup finals, in 1999 and 2003. He captained Ireland on two occasions against Tonga and Western Samoa in 2003. He was a member of the Triple Crown winning side in 2004. He won the last of his 47 caps against France in the 2006 Six Nations Championship. Corrigan continued to play club rugby and stayed at Leinster until the end of the 2006â€“07 season. At time of retirement, he had more appearances (138) for Leinster than any other player. Though that appearance record has since been beaten by players such as Brian O'Driscoll and Gordon D'Arcy.
