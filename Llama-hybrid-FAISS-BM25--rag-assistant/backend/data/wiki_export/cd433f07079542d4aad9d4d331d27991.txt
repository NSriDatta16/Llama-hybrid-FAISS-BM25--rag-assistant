Lamido (Adlam: , pl. Lamibe ) is the Anglicisation of a term from the Fula language or Fulfulde, used to refer to a ruler.  In the language it is properly laamiiɗo (, pl. laamiiɓe ), derived from the verbal root laamu- meaning "leadership", and hence may be translated more specifically as "leader". The title laamiiɗo is higher in rank than laamɗo, which means simply a "leader" or "king". Therefore, "laamiiɗo" means a "great king" or "great leader". It has been used by the traditional leaders of certain Fulani emirates in West Africa, originally as head of confederations of ruling and subordinate (often vassal) states. Its use persists within a number of post-colonial republics.

The word may have its origins from the old Serer title lamane (or laman) which means master of the land, inheritor or heir in old Serer (Fula and Serer are closely related languages). The Lamans were the ancient Serer kings before the fall of the Serer lamanic class in the 14th century. The Fula title Lam Toro—who later became leaders of Futa Toro, originated from the Serer title Laman.
