In August 1963, Cosgrove and his family were stuck on a train near Carlisle railway station for six hours. It transpired that all of the trains on the Glasgow line were stopped because the Great Train Robbery had just occurred in Ledburn, England.

Cosgrove began supporting his hometown club St Johnstone because, before the Tulloch estate to the northeast came to be, he could see their then-ground Muirton Park from his Letham bedroom window. For the first three or four years of his life, the family lived in Hillyland before the short move to Strathtay Road in Letham when he was about seven years of age.

Cosgrove is married to Shirani, a TV executive of Sri Lankan Tamil heritage. They have a son, Jack. Cosgrove also has a daughter from his previous marriage (1992–1999) to Angie, a beautician.
