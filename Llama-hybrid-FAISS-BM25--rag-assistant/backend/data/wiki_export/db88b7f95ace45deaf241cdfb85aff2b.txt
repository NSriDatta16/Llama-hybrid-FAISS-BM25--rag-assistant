Four Adventures of Reinette and Mirabelle () is a 1987 French comedy-drama film written and directed by Éric Rohmer, starring Joëlle Miquel, Jessica Forde, Philippe Laudenbach, Marie Rivière and Fabrice Luchini.

Synopsis
The film consists of four episodes in the relationship of two young women: Reinette, a country girl, and Mirabelle, a Parisian. The first episode, "L'Heure bleue" ("The Blue Hour"), recounts their meeting, and Reinette's wish to share the blue hour, a moment of silence between the natural sounds of the night and the dawn. The second episode, "Le Garçon de café" ("The Waiter"), centers on a café and a difficult waiter. In the third, "Le Mendiant, la Kleptomane et l'Arnaqueuse" ("The Beggar, the Kleptomaniac and the Hustler"), the girls discuss their differing views on people at the margins of society: beggars, thieves and swindlers. In the fourth episode, "La Vente du tableau" ("Selling the Painting"), Reinette and Mirabelle succeed in selling one of Reinette's paintings to an art dealer, while Reinette pretends to be mute and Mirabelle, acting as if she does not know Reinette, does all the talking.
