Voronin (), or Voronina (feminine: Воронина), is a Balto-Slavic last name, most commonly found in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine from Proto-Balto-Slavic word "warnás" meaning raven or crow. Other spelling variant of the name is Woronin (feminine; Woronina), and the Baltic variants of the last name are Vārnas, Voroņins and Varoņins. A similar last name can be found in Finnic countries in the form of Varonen or Vares. The last name is related to Rus/Baltic Sailors, Vikings and Ushkuyniks, because ravens were widely used to navigate the sea.
