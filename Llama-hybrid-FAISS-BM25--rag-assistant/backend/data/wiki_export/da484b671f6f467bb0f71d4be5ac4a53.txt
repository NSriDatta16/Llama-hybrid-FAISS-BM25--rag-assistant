History
Situated in the Sagittario Valley and encircled by the Majella mountains, Scanno has been immortalised by photographers Henri Cartier-Bresson (1951) and Mario Giacomelli (1957–59) and, according to Edward Lear, was host to Italy's most beautiful women.

Local legend has it that Scanno's natural lake (Lago di Scanno - stocked with pike and perch and Abruzzo’s largest natural basin) was created by a feud between a white witch and a sorcerer; the lake marking the spot where the witch finally fell.

People
For a brief period during World War II, future Italian president Carlo Azeglio Ciampi was a refugee in the town.

Quinto Mancini (1893–1963), the father of American composer Henry Mancini, was born in Scanno on 13 March 1893 and later emigrated to America.
