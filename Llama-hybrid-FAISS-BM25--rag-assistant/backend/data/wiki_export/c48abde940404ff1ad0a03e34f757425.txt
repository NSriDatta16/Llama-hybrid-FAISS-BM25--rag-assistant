International career 
During a World Cup warm-up match between Poland and Colombia on May 30, 2006, he scored a remarkable goal, striking directly from a long distance over the head of the opposition goalkeeper, Tomasz Kuszczak.

After a three-year absence from the national team, he was called back by new coach Hernan Dario Gomez for an international friendly match against Bolivia on August 5, 2010.

He was the starting goalkeeper for the Colombia national team during the Copa America 2011, since the starting goalkeeper David Ospina was out with a facial injury after colliding with Hugo Rodallega days before the tournament. Martinez had a good start to the tournament, being the only goalkeeper to have a clean sheet on all three group games. In the quarterfinal match against Peru however he made two crucial mistakes which led to the two goals of Peru.
