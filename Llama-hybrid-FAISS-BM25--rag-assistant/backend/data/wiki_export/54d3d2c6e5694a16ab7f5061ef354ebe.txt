Golden Bauhinia Awards () is a Hong Kong film award organised by the Hong Kong Film Critics Association. Its first award presentation ceremony took place in 1996.

The award attracted controversy in 2007, when ten nominations were given to Pang Ho-Cheungâ€™s Exodus before it had been screened anywhere publicly and the Best Film Award was shared by three movies. Its credibility under intense scrutiny, the association decided to suspend the award until further notice.
