Christos Tsountas (; 1857 – 9 June 1934) was a Greek classical archaeologist. He is considered a pioneer of Greek archaeology and has been called "the first and most eminent Greek prehistorian".

Born in Stenimachos in Thrace in 1857, Tsountas received his university education in Germany, at the universities of Hannover, Munich and Jena. After a brief period working as a teacher, he was hired by the Archaeological Society of Athens as an archaeological official in 1882, and joined the Greek Archaeological Service the following year. He was most active as a field archaeologist in the early decades of his life, carrying out the first archaeological survey of Thessaly, excavating several Mycenaean tombs in Laconia, and carrying out the first formal excavations of the citadel of Mycenae. In the late 1890s, his discoveries in the Cyclades generated the first evidence of Cycladic culture, to which Tsountas gave its name.

Tsountas became a professor of the University of Athens in 1904, from which point he largely retired from practical archaeological work. He published several monographs and textbooks on prehistoric archaeology, including works which became standard works in the field. He moved to the University of Thessaly between 1920 and 1926, and died in 1934.

Life

Education and early career 
Christos Tsountas was born in 1857 in Stenimachos in Thrace (present-day Asenovgrad in Bulgaria), then part of the Ottoman Empire. He completed his schooling in Stenimachos, nearby Philippopolis (present-day Plovdiv) and in Athens. As was common for aspiring Greek archaeologists in the nineteenth century, Tsountas subsequently studied in Germany; initially, he read engineering at the Royal College of Technology in Hannover, before moving to the University of Munich to read philology under the classical archaeologist Heinrich Brunn. He completed his doctoral studies at the University of Jena in 1880. 

On returning from Jena, Tsountas taught for a year at the Zariphios School, a Greek school in Philippopolis. In 1882, Tsountas was hired by the Archaeological Society of Athens, a learned society involved in the excavation and conservation of ancient monuments. One of his first postings was in 1882, to the excavations of the British architect Francis Penrose at the Temple of Zeus at Olympia. In the same year, Panagiotis Stamatakis, the Ephor General in charge of the Greek Archaeological Service, invited Tsountas to accompany him on a tour of Boeotia, combatting the illicit trade in antiquities — an event which has been described by the archaeological historian Eleni Konstantinidi-Syvridi as the beginning of Tsountas's apprenticeship to Stamatakis. 

In 1883, Tsountas joined the Greek Archaeological Service, during its first major period of expansion. Before 1879, it had consisted entirely of the Ephor General, sometimes with an assistant. After the hiring of Panagiotis Kavvadias in 1879 and of Konstantinos Dimitriadis in 1881, Tsountas was recruited by Stamatakis as an ephor alongside Demetrios Philios; they would be joined by Valerios Stais, Vasileios Leonardos and Georgios Lampakis in 1885. On , he was promoted to be the Service's ephor for Arta and Aetolia-Acarnania, both in northwestern Greece, but remained in Athens, working for both the Archaeological Service and the Archaeological Society.

Early excavations 
Between 1880 and 1891, Tsountas excavated in the southern Greek region of Laconia. His excavations there included the  tomb at Vapheio, which uncovered the Vapheio Cups, and the Mycenaean shrine known as the Amyklaion in the same region. From 1884, he worked on the Acropolis of Athens. Following the excavation of Grave Circle A at Mycenae under the German businessman Heinrich Schliemann and Stamatakis in 1876–1877, Tsountas took over the site from 1886 until 1910 and uncovered its Mycenaean citadel as well as parts of the Prehistoric Cemetery around the settlement. His notes on the excavations of the site's chamber tombs were inconsistent, and often left little evidence as to which tomb was being referred to; in the 1990s, the archaeologist Kim Shelton established the correspondence between many of the tombs excavated and numbered by Tsountas and the archaeological remains still visible at the site. Tsountas's work at Mycenae included the excavations of its  tombs as well as the discovery of its subterranean cistern.

The region of Thessaly, in northern Greece, was incorporated into the Greek state in 1881. In 1889, Tsountas, who was by then the Head of Antiquities for the Archaeological Society of Athens, made the first archaeological investigation of the area. His excavation of a Mycenaean burial tumulus at Marmariane uncovered levels of deposits dating to the Neolithic period, providing the first evidence of Neolithic material in Greece and demonstrating that mounds of this kinds, known as , could be tells formed from the deposited layers of settlements of successive periods. Tsountas subsequently excavated the sites of Volos (in 1901), Sesklo (from 1901 to 1902) and Dimini (in 1903), considered type sites for the Neolithic period in Greece.  In 1884, he led an underwater survey to investigate the site of the Battle of Salamis, which took place in 480 BCE; though poor weather made the enterprise largely unsuccessful, it may have been the first archaeological work to take place under water. He also excavated at the Mycenaean citadel of Tiryns in the Argolid between 1890 and 1891.

Tsountas was one of the first archaeologists to excavate in the Cyclades, where he coined the term Cycladic culture after his research of 1898–1899. On the island of Syros, he excavated the cemetery of Chalandriani and the associated fortified settlement of Kastri. He also excavated several hundred other Cycladic graves in cemeteries on the islands of Siphnos, Paros, Antiparos, Despotiko and Amorgos. On Siphnos, he excavated the site of Agios Andreas. 

In 1886 and 1891, Tsountas made excavations of the cemeteries of Eretria on the island of Euboea, which had been looted by antiquities traders, and in 1887 he excavated in the similarly-looted cemeteries of Tanagra. Between 1890 and 1892, Tsountas assisted Kavvadias, then Ephor General, in cataloguing the prehistoric material in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens.

Later career 
On , Tsountas was elected as a professor of the University of Athens, alongside Kavvadias. According to the archaeologist Christos Karouzos, who studied under him, Tsountas was reluctant to accept the post, but was persuaded to do so by the university. In 1914, he appeared as a witness in the Trial of Nafplio, a court case over the closure of a girls' school which had taught in the demotic form of Greek instead of the prestige  dialect then usual in education; Tsountas appeared as a witness in favour of the use of demotic. Between 1909 and 1911, he served as secretary of the Archaeological Society of Athens. 

In February 1919, Tsountas was appointed as a founding professor of the  "Practical School of Art History", an archaeological training centre administered by the Archaeological Society on behalf of the Greek government. The school's thirty-six students in its first year included Karouzos, Semni Papaspyridi and Spyridon Marinatos, all of whom went on to become leading figures in twentieth-century Greek archaeology.

Tsountas left the University of Athens in 1920, and taught until 1926 at the University of Thessaly. In 1926, he was made a member of the Academy of Athens, Greece's national academy. He died in 1934.

Assessment and legacy

The archaeologist Sofia Voutsaki has named Tsountas as a pioneer of Greek archaeology and called him "the first and most eminent Greek prehistorian".  The archaeologist Jack Davis has judged that Tsountas had greater influence on the field of Greek prehistory than any other archaeologist. In an obituary of Tsountas published in the Greek newspaper , his former student Karouzos described him as an "excellent teacher ... [and] modest man" with a "Socratic" appearance.

Tsountas' book Mycenae and the Mycenaean Age, first published in 1893, became a standard textbook on Greek prehistory. He is credited with establishing Thessaly as the primary locus of research into Neolithic Greece.

Tsountas was made an honorary member of the British Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies. Part of the Cult Centre which he excavated is known as "Tsountas's House" after him.
