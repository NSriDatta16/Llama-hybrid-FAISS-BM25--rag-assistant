Geography and administration

History

The estates first housing was built in 1948,
 and it is the largest council populated area per head of local population in England.

For many years the estate was classed as a socially deprived area and encountered serious problems including poor image, poor educational standards, high unemployment rates, a range of social and behavioural problems and environmental dereliction. In April 1997, the Grange Park Initiative project was established to improve the estate and make it a better place to live. It began as a commitment by Bispham Police, who police the estate, to take a long term problem-oriented policing approach to the communities needs after consultations with local people, councillors and the Resident Association groups.

The Grange Park Initiative objectives when it was established were:

 To improve the quality of life on the Grange Park Estate
 To target criminals and those involved in nuisance and disorder
 Create an environment for families
 Promote partnerships
 To encourage the accurate reporting and recording of crime, disorder and fear of crime

The estate's first Neighbourhood Watch scheme was set up in June 1998. On 4 July 1998, the estate celebrated its 50th anniversary with a procession and an It's a Knockout style competition on the playing fields of Grange Park Junior School.

In February 2005, Grange Park won the Deputy Prime Minister, John Prescott's Award for Sustainable Communities as part of the Government of the United Kingdom's Sustainable Communities Plan. At the award ceremony, John Prescott said of the estate, "The people of Grange Park live in one of the most deprived parts of the country...but they were determined to do something about it. Thanks to their energy and commitment, they've found new security and confidence in the place they live." Prescott also visited Grange Park during the Labour Party spring conference, spending time at the Blackpool City Learning Centre.

On 31 March 2006, Blackpool Council hosted a one-day conference "Sustainable Communities: Vision into Reality" at the Palace of Westminster where they showed how "a strong multi agency approach working closely with the community has improved life for the residents of Grange Park." In April 2007, it was revealed that crime on the estate had fallen by a further 9% in the preceding two years with the local Police Inspector, saying, "I think the drop has come as a result of a lot of hard work that has been going on over the last 10 years which is now coming to fruition."
