"Take Your Mama" is a song by American band Scissor Sisters, included as the second track on their self-titled debut album (2004). The song, written by Babydaddy and Jake Shears at Shears' parents' horse farm in West Virginia, was inspired by Shears' coming out to his mother, whom he is close with. The lyrics portray a homosexual man showing his mother the activities of gay nightlife in order to bond with her following his coming out.

The single was released on March 29, 2004, peaking at number 17 on the UK Singles Chart and receiving a gold certification from the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) in July 2023. It also saw success in other regions, most notably in New Zealand, where it reached number 11 on the RIANZ Singles Chart. In Australia, where the song peaked at number 40, it was ranked number 23 on Triple J's Hottest 100 of 2004.
