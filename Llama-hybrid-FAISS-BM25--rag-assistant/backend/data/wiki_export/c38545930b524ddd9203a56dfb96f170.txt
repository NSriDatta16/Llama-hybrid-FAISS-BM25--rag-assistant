History 

Mymensingh Girls' Cadet College was established in 1984 as the first Girls' Cadet College in Bangladesh alongside the nine existing cadet colleges for boys.  Thereafter, the desire to increase the number of places for girls' to promote more equal access to such an education combined with the introduction of commissioning female officers into the Defense Services in 2002 added more impetus to the issue. Finally, the government decided to establish two girls' cadet colleges at Feni and Joypurhat.A portion of an abandoned British Airfield (constructed in 1942 during World War II) was chosen as the site for Feni Girls' Cadet College. The MES (Military Engineer Services) started work on the project on 29 June 2004. The student (called cadet) selection procedure started in December 2005 and a nationwide competitive examination held.

Initially, only a skeleton staff of military and civilian backgrounds were transferred from other cadet colleges while the recruitment process was undertaken. The college received the first batch of newly recruited employees in April 2006. The college opened for teaching on 15 April 2006 with 100 students (cadets), fifty of each from classes VIII and VII. On 7 June 2006 the then Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia formally opened the college. Ministers, Chief of three Services, Senior Military and Civil Officers, Elites, college staff and Cadets were present. The college started running with basic buildings and services as work continued on enlarging the campus.
