Early life 
Gumpert was born on 13 November 1897 in Berlin to his parents Ely, a doctor, and Elise.  In 1923 he married Charlotte Blaschko, also a doctor, who died of tuberculosis in 1933. The couple had a daughter, Nina, who was born in around 1927.  

Gumpert trained as a doctor in Berlin and Heidelberg, working as a medical orderly during the First World War. His 1923 dissertation was on the history of syphilis, and he went on to write texts on pediatrics and developmental deformity. He studied in Paris in 1928. 

Gumpert was a left-wing social activist and trade unionist and published expressionist poetry.

1933 to 1936 
In 1933 Gumpert was forced out of his medical position by the Nazi rise to power.  Over the next few years he wrote several texts of literature and the history of science and  medicine. He was further excluded from the association of German writers, the  Reichsverband deutscher Schriftsteller as a Jew in 1935 and emigrated to the United States in 1936.

United States career
Gumpert opened a dermatology practice in New York in 1936 and became a US citizen in 1942. During these years Gumpert became a friend of the siblings Erika and Klaus Mann and in 1949 visited their father Thomas Mann in Germany. Thomas Mann used Gumpert's medical knowledge on the course of syphilis in writing his novel Doktor Faustus. 

From 1952 Gumpert edited the gerontology journal Lifetime Living  and worked as a geriatrician at the Jewish Memorial Hospital, New York. 

Gumpert continued to write about the exile experience in poems and literary publications.. 

Gumpert died on 18 April 1955.
