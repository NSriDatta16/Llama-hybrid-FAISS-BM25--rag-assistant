History
The ground was originally constructed for football in the late 1980s and first hosted matches at the 1987 Asian Club Championship and 1988–89 Asian Club Championship. The venue was taken over by the Bangladesh Cricket Board in 2004, replacing the Bangabandhu National Stadium as the home of both the men's and women's national teams. The stadium has field dimensions of 186 m × 136 m.

The first international match at the redeveloped ground was held in December 2006, and the stadium has since hosted matches of the 2011 World Cup, 2012 and 2014 Asia Cup, 2016 Asia Cup along with the majority of Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) matches.

Facilities

The ground was originally built for football and athletics, and was hence rectangular in shape. To restore it to a shape suitable for cricket, a lot of renovation had to be done, and the athletics tracks had to be dug up. About three feet of soil was excavated to remove the red clay. PVC pipes were fitted before re-filling with rock chips and sand, and then grass. The slope is even, a difference of 29 inches from the wicket to the boundary. The ground was fitted with floodlights in 2009 and is able to host day/night cricket matches.
