History

Smila arose from an early Cossack settlement founded in the late 16th century. It later came under Polish rule.

The construction of the Fastiv-Znamianka railway line spurred industrial growth in Smila- in 1910, the town had 23 factories and a population of 29 000.

During the Second World War, the Wehrmacht deployed Stalag 345 near Smila to hold Soviet prisoners of war. The camp was kept near Smila from early 1941 until December 1943, when the camp was moved to Zagreb.

In 1957, a machine repairs factory established in 1930 was repurposed to produce new machinery. The plant produced machines for food and transportation industries, and in 1972 it employed over a thousand workers.

In 1989 the population of Smila was 77,500.

Until 18 July 2020, Smila was designated as a city of oblast significance and served as the administrative center of Smila Raion though it did not belong to the raion. The settlements of Ploske and Irdynivka were subordinated to Smila city council. As part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Cherkasy Oblast to four, the city was merged into Cherkasy Raion.

During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian air strikes started a large fire within the city in October, 2022. Air raid sirens sounded in the city as early as March, 2022. A nearby Ukrainian fuel depot containing 100,000 tonnes of fuel was blown up the next day.

Economy
The economic emphasis is on mechanical engineering, and the food industry is also important. However, the town's population has generally declined since the 1980s.

Smila is the transport hub for the surrounding region.  Smila is where the Kyiv–Dnipro and Odesa–Russia rail routes cross, making Smila one of the most important railway junctions in Ukraine. The large station at the junction is named after Ukraine's national poet and artist, Taras Shevchenko.
