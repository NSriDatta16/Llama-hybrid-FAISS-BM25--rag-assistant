History

The area of what eventually became known as Central High School was bought out by Keller ISD following the approval of a $89,700,000 bond on December 6, 1997. The school's proposal fell under proposition three, which was regarded as land for potential future school sites. Anticipating further growth, Keller ISD approved a $179.7 million bond in the fall of 2000. The new bond, which included the district's third high school alongside five additional elementary schools, ascribed the development to their situation between DFW Airport and Alliance Airport.

As construction of the new school went underway, the district's Board of Trustees named Keller High School Principal Randy Baker as the new principal of the high school. Following Keller ISD heritage of upcoming students naming schools, the school's name, mascot and colors were voted on by students, and the new school earned the name Central High School, due to its central location between the two other KISD high schools. The mascot is presently the Chargers and is represented by a lightning bolt.

The school hosted its inaugural body of about 800 freshmen and sophomores the following year, in August of 2003. The school presently has 2,541 students as of the 2018-2019 school year.

The school was in Keller originally, but that area was annexed into Fort Worth.
