The Q1 can boot into two different modes: typical Windows XP (OS can be replaced), and AVS mode running Windows XP Embedded. AVS mode runs in a separate partition and boots directly to a music, photo, and video player with no Windows Explorer interface. The AVS feature is unique to the Q1.

The SSD version is identical to the Q1 except that the 40 GB hard disk drive has been replaced by Samsung's 32 GB solid-state drive. At release, the SSD version was about twice as expensive as the normal Q1.
