Despite her small stature, she had sex appeal and was noted for her exuberance on the stage. In 1955, she was a ballet dancer in Alfredo Alaria dance company. She replaced dancer Eber Lobato's sister (who was his first dance partner), 15 days after starting the relationship, Eber asked for her marriage.
Eber became a choreographer and began to improve her career.

In Buenos Aires, she starred in several "revistas" (variety shows) and played 'Roxie Hart' in the original Buenos Aires version of the musical Chicago.

She separated from Eber Lobato in 1962, after she had suffered a miscarriage. They carried on working together until 1967, when he remarried.

In 1965, she starred in the 1964 exploitation film Scream of the Butterfly directed by Eber Lobato, co starring Mary Leona Gage, Nick Novarro and Richard Beebe.

She later became the partner of Víctor Laplace, an acclaimed Argentinian film actor, and accompanied him into exile when he left Buenos Aires, after being threatened by the Triple A.
