The National Environmental Education Act of 1990 is an act of the United States Congress to promote environmental education.

In this act, Congress found that "threats to human health and environmental quality are increasingly complex, involving a wide range of conventional and toxic pollutants in the air and water and on the land" and that "there is growing evidence of international environmental problems, such as global warming, ocean pollution, and declines in species diversity, and that these problems pose serious threats to human health and the environment on a global scale" and declared several other problems that need to be fixed or addressed by improving environmental education.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the lead agency for implementation of the act. EPA established its Office of Environmental Education to implement this program.
