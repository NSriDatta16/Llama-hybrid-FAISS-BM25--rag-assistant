The  (literally 'Ghost Book' or 'Book of Spectres') is a collection of German ghost stories written by August Apel and Friedrich Laun and published in five volumes between 1810 and 1815. The fifth volume was also published as the first volume of Apel and Laun's  (1815–1817), which served as a continuation of the  series.

Stories

Development
According to Friedrich Laun's Memoirs (1837), Laun had stayed a week at Apel's family estate at Ermlitz, near Schkopau. A few stories were told about ghosts that appeared there at and after dusk, from the times when a high court was located nearby. These stories made such an impression on Apel and Laun, that when they returned to Leipzig they recounted them to their friends over tea. This proved very popular, and they started to hold  () evenings from time to time, where ghost stories were told, and which led Apel and Laun to write the .

They tried to add variety to the book by including comic fairy tales, "" and "", in the first volume, but this met with disapproval. The first volume also included "", a story written by Apel about a hunter making a pact with the devil. Johann Georg Theodor Grässe traced the origin of this story to a 1730 book called  () which contained a similar story taken from a 1710 court session in Bohemia. Laun owned a copy of this book, and Grässe theorised that he brought the story to the attention of Apel. Some characters in the stories may have been based on personal acquaintances, such as Richard Wagner's father, Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Wagner (1770–1813), a police actuary, who may have inspired "Aktuarius Wermuth" ('Registrar Absinth') in "".

Both Apel and Laun knew Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, whose play  (1776) may have influenced Laun's "". Scholar Robert Stockhammer notes that "" contains characters inspired by Cagliostro, who Goethe had written on, and who may have been discussed when Laun visited Goethe in 1804. Goethe's "" (1782) also inspired Apel's poem "".

For the fifth volume, they decided to exand the scope from ghosts to anything that could not be explained by the laws of nature, and gave the series a second title:  (). In another attempt to add variety, they decided to invite other authors to contribute, which led to Apel's friends Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué and Karl Borromäus von Miltitz writing stories for the final volume of the .

Translations

Jean-Baptiste Benoît Eyriès translated fives stories into French for his anthology  (1812): "", "", "", "", and "". The first three of these were then translated from French to English by Sarah Elizabeth Utterson in Tales of the Dead (1813). The fourth of these stories was translated from the original German by Thomas De Quincey in Knight's Quarterly Magazine (1823), which was followed by Robert Pearse Gillies' translations of the first two directly from the German in German Stories (1826), and Charles John Tibbits' abridged translation of the first story in Terrible Tales: German (1891). The first three were translated again by Marjorie Bowen in Great Tales of Horror (1933) and More Great Tales of Horror (1935), and the last two were translated by A. J. Day, and included together with Utterson's translations in Fantasmagoriana: Tales of the Dead (2005).

Following the success of Carl Maria von Weber's opera  (1821), the  story that it was based on – also called "" – was translated into English several times. It was first translated by Thomas De Quincey and published anonymously as "The Fatal Marksman" in Popular Tales and Romances of the Northern Nations (1823), followed by "Der Freischütz; or, The Magic Balls" by Mary Diana Dods in Tales of the Wild and the Wonderful (1825), again as "Der Freischutz" in George Godfrey Cunningham's Foreign Tales and Traditions (1829) along with "" as "The Piper of Neisse", and anonymously as The Original Legend of Der Freischütz, or the Free Shot (1833).

Several more  translations were published in magazines and annuals: "" as "The Raven: A Greek Tale" in Knight's Quarterly Magazine (1823), "" as "The Lamia: Greek Tradition" in Knight's Quarterly Magazine (1824), "" as "The Dance of the Dead" in The Literary Magnet (1824), "" as "Death Tokens" in The European Magazine (1825), "" as "The Veiled Bride" in The Literary Magnet (1825), "" as "The Bridal Ornaments" in Forget-Me-Not for 1827 (1826), "" as "The Spirit's Summons" in Leigh Hunt's London Journal (1835), "" as "The Silver Lady" in The Keepsake for 1838 (1837), "" as "Two New Year's Nights" in The Court Magazine (1839), and "" as "Fatal Curiosity" in The New Monthly Belle Assemblée (1845). A word-for-word translation of "Alp" was included as "The night-mare" in Wilhelm Klauer-Klattowski's The German Manual for the Young and for Self-Tuition volume 2 (1845). In addition to these translations, some authors adapted  stories for an English-speaking audience, such as Mary Diana Dods' "The Three Damsels" in Forget-Me-Not for 1827 (1826), based on part of "", and J. E. Preston Muddock's "The Dance of the Dead" in Tales of Terror (1899), based on "". Some translations were never published, such as Mary Diana Dods' translation of "", and a translation of "" started by De Quincey in autumn 1824.

"" is itself a translation of Madame d'Aulnoy's "" from  (1697), which has been translated from the original French into English a number of times as "Princess Rosetta" and "Princess Rosette".

Influence

Freischütz
The first tale in the first volume is "", a retelling by Apel of the Freischütz folktale. It formed the inspiration for Weber's opera Der Freischütz (1821). However, unlike Apel's version, in Weber's opera the final bullet does not kill the protagonist's fiancée, but is deflected, and kills the huntsman who convinced him to cast the bullets instead.

Frankenstein, The Vampyre, and Manfred
In June 1816, Lord Byron, Mary Shelley, Percy Bysshe Shelley, John William Polidori and Claire Clairmont read  (1812), a collection of German ghost stories translated into French, five of which were from the . Inspired by the book, the group decided to write their own ghost stories, with Mary Shelley writing Frankenstein, and Polidori writing The Vampyre, based on Byron's "Fragment of a Novel".

Two of the five  stories in  had a significant influence on Frankenstein. "" () was one of the two stories Mary Shelley described in her introduction to the 1831 edition of Frankenstein, and the death of Frankenstein's wife Elizabeth may have been inspired by the story, while "" () is similar to Mary Shelley's account of the dream that inspired Frankenstein, of a haunting figure standing at the bedside.

Another of the  stories in , "" (, translated as "", ), may have been an inspiration for the Astarte scene in Byron's Manfred, which he began in late 1816.

Joseph von Auffenberg's 1824 play,  () was based on Apel's "" from volume 2 of .
