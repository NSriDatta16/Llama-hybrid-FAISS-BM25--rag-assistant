Biography

Early years
Young was raised in Boulder, Colorado and is the youngest of five sons. He began writing songs, singing, and taking voice lessons at age 9. In his youth he performed at shopping malls and recreation centers. He performed at various venues in Colorado and other western states, including performing the National Anthem at The Pepsi Center in Denver. Young graduated from Fairview High School in Boulder, Colorado in 1999. While in high school he participated in athletics, choir, and International Baccalaureate classes. He earned the rank of Eagle Scout during his senior year.

After Young graduated from high school he wrote a song called "Reason I Live" that was featured on the soundtrack of the 2000 film The Little Vampire.

In 2001, Young moved to Los Angeles, California to continue pursuing his music career. He ultimately met Brian McKnight and was given the chance to open for McKnight and New Edition. Just prior to auditioning for American Idol he landed a guest-starring role in an episode of Half & Half, playing a character named Ace Blackwell.

American Idol
After over four years in Los Angeles without a record deal, Young auditioned for American Idol in Denver, Colorado. His televised audition featured him singing Westlife's "Swear it Again." Young was introduced as Brett Young, with the name "Ace" marked in quotations. Later, he told producers he preferred to be called Ace and he was not referred to as Brett on the show again.

Young made it through Hollywood week and  sang George Michael's song, "Father Figure" for his live Top 24 performance. He also performed Michael Jackson's song, "Butterflies."

The week that featured the music of Queen and the surviving members of the band as mentors, there was a brief controversy. American Idol's editing of Young's pre-performance package made it appear as if he had offended Brian May and the rest of the band by suggesting a change in the arrangement of "We Will Rock You." May came to Young's defense a few days later when he wrote a blog clarifying he and the band felt their mentoring session was a productive exchange of ideas for the arrangement of the song.

The week Young was eliminated the theme was "Songs from the Great American Songbook," with Rod Stewart as mentor. Young sang "That's All." He changed his look for this performance, slicking his hair back and dressing up in a suit and tie. He received mixed reviews from the judges and was joined by Chris Daughtry and Paris Bennett in the bottom 3.
