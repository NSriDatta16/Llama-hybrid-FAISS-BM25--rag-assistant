History

The original designation of Boynton Beach Boulevard was State Road 195. The 1945 State Road renumbering changed that designation to the current State Road 804. The road originally began as Boynton West Road at State Road 7, about 1/2 mile south of the current western terminus, connecting the farms in that area to the town of Boynton Beach to the east. Boynton West Road headed east to Military Trail at the eastern end of a sugarcane field, where the road would follow Military Trail for 1/2 mile northbound, with the field to the west. The road would continue east, and then south to Boynton West Shellrock Road (now Old Boynton Road), where the road would head east to its original eastern terminus at Dixie Highway (now Federal Highway, US 1, and SR 5) and NW 2nd Avenue.
