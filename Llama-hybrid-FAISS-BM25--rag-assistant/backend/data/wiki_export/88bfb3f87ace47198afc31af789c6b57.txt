History 
In 1948, the Grafenwoehr Training Area was assigned to the 7th Army and designated a tank training center. In 1959, Grafenwoehr becomes headquarters of the Seventh Army Training Center, incorporating the Grafenwoehr and Hohenfels Training Areas to become the largest training complex in Germany. In 1975, Grafenwoehr becomes the headquarters for the Seventh U.S. Army Training Center, which becomes the Seventh Army Training Command the following year. As of January 2006, the 7th ATC became known as the 7th Army Joint Multinational Training Command. In July 2016, the 7th Army Joint Multinational Training Command was returned to its original designation as the 7th Army Training Command.
