The Best of Friends is a compilation album (9th release) by singer-songwriter duo Loggins and Messina, released in late 1976.

It consists of 10 of their most popular and best loved songs in what is essentially a "greatest hits" LP.

The CD release featured the same tracks as the original 1976 LP; "Angry Eyes" is still the shorter version and no additional tracks were added to fill the CD to the 80-minute limit.
