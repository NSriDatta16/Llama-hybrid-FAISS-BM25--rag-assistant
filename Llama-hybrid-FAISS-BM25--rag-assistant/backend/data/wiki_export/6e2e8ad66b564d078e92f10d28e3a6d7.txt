History
The first University of Oregon bookstore was organized by the Associated Students of the University of Oregon (ASUO) in 1916 in a rented house that was on the site of the present store. After World War I, the ASUO found itself in financial difficulty and sold the bookstore to a local druggist.  By 1920, it became clear that the university needed a bookstore, and a supporter from Portland, stationer J. K. Gill, set up the University of Oregon Cooperative Store. Stock in a separate corporation, the University Supply Company, was sold to department heads and faculty, including university president Prince Lucien Campbell. By 1933, the bookstore was financially solvent and the supply company was dissolved.

The bookstore changed locations several times. In 1959, the board of directors voted to buy the College Side Inn, which was located at 13th and Kincaid streets, the site of the present bookstore.  A new bookstore building was completed in 1961, with several additions being made to it since then.

In keeping with the not-for-profit mission of the bookstore, students, faculty and staff of the U of O receive everyday discounts off publisher's suggested prices on all course texts.
