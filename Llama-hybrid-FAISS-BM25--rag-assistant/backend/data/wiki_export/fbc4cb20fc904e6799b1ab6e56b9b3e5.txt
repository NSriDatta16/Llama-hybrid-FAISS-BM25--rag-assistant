Corokia is a genus in the Argophyllaceae family. The genus was first described in 1839. It comprising six species native to New Zealand, Australia and Rapa Iti. Corokia species are shrubs or small trees with zigzagging (divaricating) branches. In fact, Corokia cotoneaster is commonly known as wire-netting bush. The stems of the shrubs are dark when mature, covered with downy or silky hairs (tomentum) when young. In spring, they produce clusters of small, star-shaped yellow blossoms. Berries are red or yellow. The shrubs prefer forests and rocky areas, sun or light shade, reasonably well drained soil, and moderate watering.
