Concordia Lutheran High School is a secondary school affiliated with the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS), serving grades 9 - 12 in Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States.

History
In 1916, the LCMS congregations in Fort Wayne started the Luther Institute, a two-year secondary school teaching basic office skills such as typing and shorthand, and also business law and Bible classes. Initially the school used facilities in those congregations. In 1920, the leaders of the Luther Institute suggested a merger with the high school department of Concordia College, but no agreement was reached, so in 1924-25 the institute erected a three-story building (demolished in 2006) at the corner of Barr and Washington.

Negotiations for the merger were successfully reopened in 1934. The resulting Lutheran High School opened in 1935, using two floors of Hanser Hall on the college campus after seven Lutheran churches in Fort Wayne raised $6,000 to renovate and equip the facility. From 1935 to 1947, the college controlled the academic aspects of the high school, while the Lutheran High School Association handled the financial aspects. The high school undertook steps to receive accreditation from the state of Indiana in 1938.

By 1947, increased enrollment had strained the 300-student capacity of the building, so the association constructed a new classroom building on  in the southeast corner of the college campus. The new building at Anthony Boulevard and Maumee Avenue opened in 1952. The high school continued to use the athletic and other facilities of the college. In 1955, the name of the school was officially changed to Concordia Lutheran High School.

In 1957, the LCMS decided to close Concordia College. The acreage allocated to the high school was increased to , and six additional classrooms were constructed that same year. The next year the remainder of the college campus was sold to Indiana Technical College.

That same year, 1958, a group of Lutheran businessmen took an option on  containing Zollner Stadium at North Anthony Boulevard and St. Joe River Drive. The next year the high school association purchased that property and an additional  on the west side of Anthony for construction of the current building. After $950,000 was raised in a pledge drive, ground was broken for the new facility, designed by architect James Sherbondy, in March 1963. Classes moved to the new campus in the fall of 1964. The old campus was sold to Indiana Technical College, which uses the former high school building as its Cunningham Business Center.

In 1973, a music wing, a chapel-auditorium, and additional classrooms were constructed. More land has also been added to the campus, including  along Crescent Avenue donated by Fred Zollner and the  “Our Creators Classroom” nature area north of the school, raising the size of the campus to . Zollner Stadium has also been rebuilt.
