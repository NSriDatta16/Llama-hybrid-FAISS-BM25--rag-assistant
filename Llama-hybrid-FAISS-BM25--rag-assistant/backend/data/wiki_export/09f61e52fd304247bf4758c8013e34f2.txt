Voorhees College is a college in Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India.  It was founded in 1898 as Arcot Mission College, when Arcot Mission High School was amalgamated to the University of Madras.  The college is named after its benefactors, Mr. and Mrs.  Ralph and Elizabeth Voorhees of the Reformed Church in America.  The College was earlier known as Ralph and Elizabeth Voorhees college when it was a Co-educational institution.  In the late sixties towards the end of the tenure of Dr. A.N. Gopal, the then principal, the college stopped admitting women students and dropped the names Ralph and Elizabeth and became known as Voorhees College.  The college began offering master's level courses in 1975.  The College is managed by the Church of South India, Diocese of Vellore.
