History
A cadet college is an institution following the model of English public schools. In 1979, Rangpur Cadet College was established as the sixth cadet college of Bangladesh. The former Rangpur Residential Model High School was converted into a cadet college with some infrastructural modification. The land now owned by the college is partially taken from the Carmichael College, an educational college which stands beside it. The college started with its first three batches (called the intake) in 7th, 8th and 9th grade in 1979. Commander Habibur Rahman was the first principal of this institution. Krittiranjan Chakma was the first adjutant and Hossain Sohel Shahnewaz was the first College Prefect of the CCR (who was assassinated on the 25 February 2009 in the BDR mutiny). From 2003, English was introduced as the medium of education as per a government decision to convert the cadet colleges into the English versions. The 28th intake was the first batch in the English version.
