Manual is the performing name of electronic musician Jonas Munk Jensen, (born 1981 or 1982), from Odense, Denmark. He makes music in the style of ambient dream pop and indietronica. His sound tends to contain a mix of software synthesizers, guitars (sometimes sampled or heavily processed), and various digital signal processing effects. Mixing elements of pop, glitch, and indie music, Manual is compared to artists ranging from IDM artists, such as Boards of Canada, as well as shoegazer groups like Blonde Redhead.

Munk's output as Manual is strongly associated with the aesthetic of Morr Music, the label that released his first two albums. He also is featured on the Morr Music compilation Blue Skied an' Clear, which was a Slowdive tribute.

In 2004 he joined the American label Darla. Simultaneously, Munk started a psychedelic band called Causa Sui, and they released their self-titled debut album in December 2005.

He composed the soundtrack for the 2012 Danish-American road trip film Searching for Bill.
