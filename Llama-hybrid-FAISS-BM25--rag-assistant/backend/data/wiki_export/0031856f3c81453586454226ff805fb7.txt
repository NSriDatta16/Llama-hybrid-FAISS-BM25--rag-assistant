Mobile app

Renner released a mobile app called "Jeremy Renner" (Android) and "Jeremy Renner Official" (iOS) in March 2017. The app was created by Escapex, a company that specializes in monetized apps for celebrities. Fast Company wrote extensively about Renner's app in April 2019, calling it "a surprising new kind of social media".

The community developed to include memes, selfies, and a "Happy Rennsday" event on Wednesdays. As early as October 2017, there were claims of censorship, bullying, and "contest-rigging". In September 2019, comedian Stefan Heck publicized his discovery of the fact that replies through the app appear as if they were sent by Renner himself in push notifications. After several users abused this feature, Renner asked Escapex to shut down the app.

Personal life
Renner married Canadian model Sonni Pacheco on January 13, 2014. Renner and Pacheco have a daughter. On December 30, 2014, Pacheco filed for divorce from Renner, citing irreconcilable differences.

He has a house-renovating business with his best friend and fellow actor, Kristoffer Winters.

On January 1, 2023, Renner was hospitalized after an accident in which he suffered blunt chest trauma and 30 broken bones from being hit and run over by his snowplow at home. The snowplow was an extremely large snowcat weighing . Renner was flown by helicopter to Renown Regional Medical Center (the region's only trauma center). Renner underwent surgery and remained in the intensive care unit in critical condition. By January 17, Renner was released from the hospital and had returned home to continue his recovery. Doctors who treated him said that Renner's physicality and health likely helped him survive the accident, and added that ten weeks after the accident, Renner was beginning to regain enough strength to walk with a cane.
