is a Welsh hymn, the words of which were written in the 1890s by Daniel James (Gwyrosydd) and sung to a tune by John Hughes. The song was originally written as a hymn, but has become firmly established as a rugby anthem, associated with the Welsh rugby union, being sung before almost every Test match involving the Welsh national team – though more likely to be heard sung at matches involving the Welsh football team in recent years. In 2007 the song was one of the traditional Welsh songs to make it to the screen in an S4C television series , an attempt to bring traditional four-part harmony choral singing back to the Welsh rugby terraces.

In 2012, the Welsh group Only Boys Aloud sang "" on the British ITV show Britain's Got Talent, coming third in the final. It has since become the most watched Welsh-language video on YouTube.

Hymn 223, The English singing translation by Rees Harris (1874–1954) appeared in The Abingdon Song Book in 1937.
