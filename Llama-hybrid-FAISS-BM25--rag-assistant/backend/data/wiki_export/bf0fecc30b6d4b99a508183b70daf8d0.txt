AJ's Fine Foods, formerly known as AJ Bayless, is a supermarket chain formerly headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona. It was founded by Arthur Joseph Bayless in the 1930s.

History 
The company went through a bankruptcy in the late 1980s. It was acquired by Bashasâ€™ in 1993. Under Bashas' ownership, AJ's has positioned itself as an upscale gourmet and specialty grocery chain with each store located in affluent neighborhoods. The stores feature chef-prepared entrees, an extensive wine collection with trained cellar staff, and specialty baked goods.

Some locations in middle-class and blue-collar neighborhoods were converted to Bashas' Food City format.
