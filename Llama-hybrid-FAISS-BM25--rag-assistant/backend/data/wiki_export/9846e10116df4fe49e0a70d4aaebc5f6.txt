The owner
G.W. Holland was a signee to the Southern Rights Association of Centreville District on secession from the Union for the protection of Southern interests and the vindication of Southern rights to preserve and protect the Constitution in its purity as the basis of Federal compact, and the only foundation on which the Union of the States was made, or on which that Union should be preserved.

Purchase of Woodlawn
Dr. Holland lived on the property until about 1844. Having fallen on hard times during and post-Civil War, Holland sold the land to Alexander Mosely in 1871 for $6,760.47 (~$ in ). Mosely was a 30-year-old farmer and Civil War veteran from Leon County and had a wife, Mary L. Moseley and a young son, William. During his 9 years on Woodlawn, Mosely would also become Leon County Sheriff. Mosely's new occupation led to the Mosely's selling Woodlawn and moving to Tallahassee.

In 1880 Mosely sold Woodlawn to Eugene H. Smith, a storekeeper from Thomasville, Georgia for $4000 (~$ in ). Smith then renamed the property Hickory Hill. The Smiths lived at Hickory Hill for 15 years before Mrs. Eugene Smith sold the property.

In 1895 Hickory Hill was purchased for $8000 by Edward Beadle of New York City and became a quail hunting plantation called Tall Timbers Plantation. It would be passed down to Beadle's nephew and then later become the property of Tall Timbers Research Station and Land Conservancy.
