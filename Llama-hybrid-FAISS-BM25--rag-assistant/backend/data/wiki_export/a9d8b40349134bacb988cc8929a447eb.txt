Diablos Rojos del Mexico

Long Island Ducks
On April 8, 2016, Coffey signed with the Long Island Ducks of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. He became a free agent after the 2016 season.

Pitching style
Coffey mainly threw two pitches: a sinking fastball that went up to 95–96 mph, and a sharp dropping slider at 81–82 mph.

He was known for his full-speed sprints from the bullpen to the mound when he was brought into games. According to Coffey, this started when he was in Cincinnati, when he was so distracted while warming up, he wasn't aware that it was his time to pitch, and he quickly ran from the bullpen onto the mound, and the run caused so much of a rush in Coffey, he chose to continue the sprint to the pitching mound from then on.
As a result, the Brewers introduced a "Coffey Time!" graphic on the scoreboard that kept track of Coffey's time to sprint from the bullpen to the pitcher's mound after getting called out to pitch. Also, while with the Brewers, Coffey's intro music was the entrance music of the pro wrestler The Ultimate Warrior, who would run full-sprint to the ring as his entrance.
