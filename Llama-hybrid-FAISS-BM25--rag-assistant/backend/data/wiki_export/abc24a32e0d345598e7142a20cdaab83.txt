Parfait d'amour (), or parfait amour, is a liqueur. It is often used in cocktails primarily for its purple colour, and is generally created from a curaçao liqueur base.

There are several versions of parfait d'amour. The House of Lucas Bols in the Netherlands claims to have originated the liqueur.  Theirs appears to be a curaçao base, flavoured with rose petals, vanilla and almonds. Marie Brizard, a Bordeaux-based distiller, has a product with a similar flavor profile. Another form, produced by DeKuyper, uses a spirit as its base, and is flavoured with lemon, coriander and violets.

Guardian writer John Wright describes it as "a potent compound... It tasted like the perfume counter at Boots." He suggests a homemade version containing rose petals in a base of white rum or eau de vie, with the addition of syrups made from raspberry juice and rosehips.

Availability
Parfait d'amour is primarily produced and sold in France and the Netherlands, although it is available in the United Kingdom, Spain, United States, Canada, Australia, Greece, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, and Norway.
