Glenbard East High School, or GBE, is a public four-year high school located  in Lombard, Illinois, a western suburb of Chicago, in the United States. It is part of Glenbard Township High School District 87. East, on average, draws around 2,500 students from Lombard, and portions of Glendale Heights, Addison, and Bloomingdale.

History
Glenbard East High School opened in September 1959 with a student body of 525 students and 28 staff members. In the week prior to the school's opening, a tornado or microburst hit the school, causing significant damage. The east wall of the Tower section of the building was sucked out and fell through the roof of the then-unnamed auditorium. The classroom wing was unaffected, but the start of school was postponed for two weeks. When choosing team names during the first semester the school was open, the "Tornadoes" was one of three final choices; the other two were the "Apaches" and the winner, the "RAMS"—shown in caps as an acronym for Right Attitude Means Success. Given the school's location in "the Lilac Village," proposed school colors of lilac (purple, really) and white were not selected; instead the student body chose red, black and white. The first principal was William Rider.

Prior to the opening of Glenbard East in 1959, Lombard students in High School District No. 87 attended Glenbard West High School (then Glenbard High School) in Glen Ellyn. In Glenbard East's first year, school activities and sports were contained in the Glenbard West yearbook, the Pinnacle, in a special section. The first Glenbard East yearbook was the 1961 edition, and named the Aries. The yearbook staff, Aries, works year-round to produce the Glenbard East High School yearbook.

In its first few years, Glenbard East competed in the Interim Conference, comprising mostly newly built suburban schools. Other schools in the conference were Willowbrook High School in Villa Park, Niles West High School in Skokie, Morton West High School in Berwyn, among others.

The school celebrated its 50th anniversary in October 2009, with a display of memorabilia and special recognition to athletes of 50 years during a halftime celebration during a home football game October 2.

In 2011, The Washington Post named Glenbard East one of the top public high schools in Illinois.
