Stewart Island Flights is a small airline company from New Zealand that conducts scheduled flights on light aircraft between Invercargill and Stewart Island. The airline also operates charter services to several of the islandâ€™s beaches. In 2000, Southern Air was acquired by South East Air Ltd, which was founded by Raymond Hector and Bill Moffatt in 1993. Since then, South East Air Ltd has been the parent company and holder of the Air Operator Certificate (AOC) under which Stewart Island Flights and Invercargill Aircraft Maintenance operate.

Services 
Stewart Island Flights operates three flights a day between Invercargill Airport and Ryan's Creek Aerodrome on Stewart Island with regular additional departures during the summer season (October to the end of April). Stewart Island Flights also arranges scenic flights around Stewart Island and the Southland Region.

Other services of the company are flights to Mason Bay on the western side of Stewart Island, landing at four different locations on the bay: Duck Creek, Martin's Creek, Cavalier, and Kilbride. As well as servicing other beach landing sites such as Doughboy Bay, Little Hellfire Beach, West Ruggedy Beach, Sealers Bay (Codfish Island), and Smoky Beach. 

Until 2011, the parent company South East Air operated an IFR post run using a Piper PA-32 between Invercargill and Dunedin. As such, South East Air was one of only two companies in New Zealand that had the capability to fly a single-engine piston aircraft at night under IFR.
