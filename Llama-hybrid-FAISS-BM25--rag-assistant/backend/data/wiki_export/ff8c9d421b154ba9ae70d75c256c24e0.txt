Biography
Kayumi was born in Tokyo Prefecture and moved to Kagoshima Prefecture when he was a boy because of wartime evacuation. He entered Kagoshima Prefectural Daini-Kagoshima Middle School. Due to educational reform in occupied Japan, Daini-Kagoshima Middle School became Kagoshima Prefectural Konan High School. He studied at Kagoshima Konan High School and was in drama club. Because he came to aspire to an actor during his high school life, he went to Tokyo and learned at the acting school, Butai Geijutsu Gakuin (Theater Art College, :ja:舞台芸術学院). He became an actor of shingeki and then also worked as a voice actor since 1956.

During his long career, he belonged to some troupes and affiliated with talent agencies for voice actors, for example, Aoni Production. He was finally affiliated with 81 Produce until his death at the age of 80 on September 30, 2014, while undergoing medical treatment.

Fellow voice actor and drinking companion Norio Wakamoto called him a precision machine since he never made a mistake when recording. Ayumi Fujimura cited Kayumi as an inspiration.
