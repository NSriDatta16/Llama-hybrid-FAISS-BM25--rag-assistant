Luton Sixth Form College is a sixth form college in the Barnfield area of Luton, Bedfordshire, England.

History
In 1904 Luton Council acquired the Modern School, which was a mixed-sex secondary school. This school moved into new buildings in Park Square in 1908 (now the site of the University of Bedfordshire). By 1919 the school had grown significantly and further expansion was needed. A new building was constructed at Alexandra Avenue for the girls (now the site of Denbigh High School). This school was named Luton High School for Girls; the boys continued at the old site in Park Square.

Grammar school
Again expansion meant that a new building was needed and, in 1938, the current college was built on the north side of Bradgers Hill Road as the new site for Luton Modern School. At that time, the school was on the northern edge of the developed area of Luton, with open countryside beyond. In 1944 the school became Luton Grammar School. A mixed-sex technical college remained at Park Square until it moved to Barnfield Avenue in the 1950s, as Luton Technical Grammar School, but it was often referred to as Luton Secondary Technical School or the Tech. The site is now home to Barnfield College.

On 16 February 1965, a radio programme recorded at the school, Sporting Chance, was broadcast on the BBC Light Programme, where a team from the school faced Maurice Edelston, Peter West and Alan Clarke, with the quiz hosted by John Snagge.

Sixth Form College

In 1966 Luton Grammar School became the first Sixth Form College in the UK, drawing together the Sixth Forms from the three selective schools in Luton. Many of the staff from the previous sixth forms as well as the libraries moved to the Bradgers Hill Site.

The founding College Principal was Brian David Dance B.A. Oxon (formerly Headmaster Cirencester Grammar School) who oversaw the creation, amalgamation and development of the College from 1966 to 1973. In 2011 the Luton News wrote of Dance's contribution to the College, 'During his tenure at the college, it become a model of excellence for many other local education authorities, seeking as it did to offer the widest possible range of A level courses, in many combinations unavailable elsewhere'.

In 1971 the College participated in the BBC television version of Top of the Form inter-schools quiz show. After three victories (against Oxted County, Merthyr and Weston-super-Mare Grammar Schools) the College reached the finals of the national competition against Kenilworth Grammar School (broadcast on 8 June 1971). In August and September 1971 the same College team (together with Oban and Kenilworth Schools) took part in the BBC TV/USA TV 'Trans World Top Team' competition against the United States (represented by teams from Baltimore, New Orleans and St. Pauls). Of the six teams participating the College was placed close second to winners Baltimore.

In December 1981 the College set up an educational link with the Indian sub-continent when, in co-operation with the Central Bureau for Educational Exchanges and Visits, it participated in a 5 week visit to the Air Force Central School, New Delhi. During the exchange the College students had meetings with the Indian President, Sanjiva Reddy, at the Rashtrapati Bhavan (the former Viceroy's Palace) and Indira Gandhi, the Prime Minister, at her residence at 1, Akbar Road. In June 1982 the Indian students were guests of the College for five weeks and visited the Foreign Secretary in Whitehall.

On 21 April 2001 Dave Edwards, a former Physics teacher at the College, became the first man to win the million pounds in the UK version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? and only the second person after Judith Keppel. He competed in both series of Are You an Egghead?, reaching the last 16 in 2008, and the final in 2009, where he lost to fellow Millionaire winner Pat Gibson.

Rebuild
In early 2007, the college announced plans to rebuild the site. The new £56 million college opened to students on 7 September 2010 on the site of the old college's playing fields. Phase 2 of the rebuilding involved the demolition of the old buildings and the construction of a new car park, a cricket pitch, football pitches and a path from the entrance to the site to the new college in their place.

The rebuilding project took place under the Principalship of Simon Kitchener, who was the fourth College Principal following Brian Dance (1966–73), Laurence Martindale (1974-1988) and Brian Howseman (1988-2000). Simon Kitchener (2000-2012) was succeeded by Chris Nicholls (2012-2018), who retired in September 2018, to be followed by the present, fifth, incumbent, Altaf Hussain.
