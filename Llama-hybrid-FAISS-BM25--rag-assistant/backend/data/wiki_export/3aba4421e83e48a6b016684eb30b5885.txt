Star Wars: Republic is an American comic book series set in the fictional Star Wars universe.  The series was published by Dark Horse Comics from 1998 to February 2006. The series was originally titled simply Star Wars, but acquired its Republic title at issue 46.  The entire series comprises 83 issues. After issue 83, the series was replaced by Star Wars: Dark Times, which continued the Republic numbering on its inside covers. The Republic series is one of a number of comic book series set in the Star Wars Expanded Universe.

The events in Star Wars: Republic are set in roughly the same fictional timeframe as the Star Wars film prequel trilogy.  Character development builds on the films, including appearances by more prominent characters such as Mace Windu and Yoda, as well as peripheral characters such as Ki-Adi-Mundi and Quinlan Vos.

Story arcs

Prelude to Rebellion
Issues 1–6 (December 1998–May 1999) were written by Jan Strnad with art by Anthony Winn.

Shortly before the events of The Phantom Menace, Jedi Master Ki-Adi-Mundi returns to his home world and defends his people, including his family, from raiders. After his success there, he is made a member of the Jedi Council.

Outlander
Issues 7–12 (June–November 1999) were written by Timothy Truman with art by Tom Raney, Rod Pereira, Rick Leonardi, and Al Rio.

Following the events of The Phantom Menace, Ki-Adi-Mundi is sent by the Jedi Council to Tatooine to investigate whether former Padawan Sharad Hett, who now identifies as a Tusken Raider, has become evil. Meanwhile, Gardulla and Jabba the Hutt send their minions to attack the Sand People in a scheme to drive the sales of outdated weapons. Hett dies, but his son and Padawan, A'Sharad Hett, returns to Coruscant to join the Jedi Order.

Emissaries to Malastare
Issues 13–18 (December 1999–May 2000) were written by Timothy Truman with art by Tom Lyle, Jan Duursema, and John Nadeau.

Jedi Masters Mace Windu, Yaddle, Adi Gallia, Plo Koon, Even Piell, and Ki-Adi-Mundi, as well as A'Sharad Hett, travel to Malastare to establish peace between two rival factions. They are caught up in the middle of a high-stakes podrace, which Sebulba dominates despite an assassination attempt on him. Mace then travels to Nar Shaddaa to investigate the trafficking of an animal from his home world.

Twilight
Quinlan Vos has had his memory erased, including his Jedi training and system of morality. He teams up with the Devaronian Vilmarh Grahrk, who places a bet on the Jedi's survival after failing to benefit from his death. Vos remembers his identity and that of his apprentice, Aayla Secura, when he finds their lightsabers. Vos and Grahrk travel to Ryloth in hopes of finding Secura and discovering who tried to erase her and Vos's existence.

Infinity's End
Quinlan Vos has been sent to Dathomir, where he is tasked with preventing a coven of crazy witches from using an outmoded portal to jump across spacetime, wreaking havoc to planets each time the gate is used.

Starcrash
A newly knighted Jedi crash-lands on a planet where he helps liberate a princess from an unwanted marriage.

The Hunt for Aurra Sing
Ki-Adi-Mundi, A'Sharad Hett, and Adi Gallia pursue Aurra Sing, who has recently been on a Jedi-slaying rampage.

Darkness
Quinlan Vos goes to a planet where the leader of some brain-devouring creatures has turned Aayla Secura to the dark side. Vos's former master shows up, as do some other Jedi and Vilmarh Grahrk, who help Vos save Secura.

One officer reluctant to serve the Empire, Sagoro Autem, is warned by his former partner Omin that he is soon to be executed. Vader arrives and kills Omin, knowing he helped Autem flee.
