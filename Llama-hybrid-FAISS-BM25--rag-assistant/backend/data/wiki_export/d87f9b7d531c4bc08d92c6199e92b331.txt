History
The originally Slavic community of Dietrichsdorf had its first documentary mention on 14 November 1385. It was however named after the colonization leader Dietrich who led a group of German settlers during the East Colonization; the original Slavic name was not kept.

The subdivision of Külso had its first documentary mention in 1378. Külso, too, is of Slavic origin. The name comes from koko, meaning "rounding", "circle" or "round village", which most likely refers to the village's original shape. Since 1942, the community has been part of Dietrichsdorf.
