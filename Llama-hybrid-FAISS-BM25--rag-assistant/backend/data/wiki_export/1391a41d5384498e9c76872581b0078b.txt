Services

Up until the electrification of the West Coast Main Line through to  in 1974, Wishaw was served by a Monday to Saturday hourly diesel service from  to Glasgow Central High Level, alternating between services via Holytown/Hamilton and Bellshill.

1974 to 1979 
An hourly electric service was provided between Glasgow Central High Level, running non-stop to Motherwell, as Shieldmuir station did not open until 1987.

1979 to 2001

Other services
The station has some other sporadic passenger services such as two trains a day to  and two to  via . Since the December 2013 timetable change, the station has also been served by a regular Glasgow Central - Carstairs - Edinburgh semi-fast service in each direction, giving a through journey time of 48-50 minutes to Edinburgh.

From December 2014 

A recast of the Argyle Line timetable in the wake of the Whifflet Line electrification has seen some significant changes to the service pattern.  All services to Motherwell & Glasgow Central now run via Shieldmuir & Bellshill (every half-hour) rather than alternating via this route and Holytown & Hamilton and they also now terminate at Central High Level rather than running through to Partick and beyond via Rutherglen & Central Low Level (passengers now must change at  for these destinations). The only exception is a single weekday train from  to Garscadden in the morning peak, which returns from  to Carstairs in the evening & uses the route via Holytown.

The two-hourly semi-fast service between Glasgow Central & Edinburgh still calls all day (except on Sundays) and now is extended through to/from .

The line is heavily used for freight services also, with several Freightliner container trains a day from the nearby Coatbridge terminal to destinations in the south of England such as Felixstowe and Southampton. It is also used by services to the Mossend freight terminal as well as those travelling from the West Coast Main Line to the Highlands.

The line through Wishaw station is heavily used during engineering work on the adjacent West Coast Main Line (less than 1Â km to the west of the station) which brings a wide variety of rolling stock to the line.

Facilities
The station has a small (25 spaces) car park and ticket office staffed from Monday to Saturday.
