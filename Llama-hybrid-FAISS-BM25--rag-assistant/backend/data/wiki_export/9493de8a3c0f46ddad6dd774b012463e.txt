"A Perfect Match" was A-Teens' second single from the European reissue of Pop 'til You Drop, New Arrival. The track was written by Mack, Habolin and Jasson. The song peaked at number two on the Swedish charts.

Music video
The video was filmed in Cuba, and was co-directed by the A-Teens themselves. It tells a story of a rich girl and a poor boy who fall in love with each other, but their families are against their relationship; however, despite this, and their differences, they are still "a perfect match".

Cover songs and renditions 
An additional version of the song, in which the references to "South Park" and "Snatch" had been changed to "Star Wars" and "Flash", was played on Radio Disney, to make it more child-friendly.
The music was used with new lyrics in J-Pop singer Nami Tamaki's 2004 single "Daitan ni Ikimashou â€“ Heart & Soul"
