North, south and southwest areas of Mt. Şaphane are appropriate for energy production from wind. This energy potential would be enough for meeting the electric energy needs of the district and nearby districts.

Thermal water energy

a) 90 °C hot water (30lt/second) was found after drilling works made under 1326 meters depth in Üçbaş sub-district by MTA in 2006. this thermal source has been opened for bid by MTA.

b) 97 °C hot water was found after drilling works made under 1600 meters depth by MTA in 2007 in Karacaderbent Ward that is on Kütahya-Gediz-Simav-Balıkesir-Bursa highway.

MTA has planned activities in this area in its 2009 agenda that TPAO is going to carry
out drilling projects by the depth of 4000 meters. This area is appealing for both tourism and energy investments because of its proximity to the highway.
