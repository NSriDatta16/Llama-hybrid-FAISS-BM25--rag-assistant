The Mouth of Baffle Creek Conservation Parks are a series of two protected conservation parks located adjacent to the mouth of the Baffle Creek, on the central coastal region of Queensland, Australia.

The  parks are within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park coastal region.

This small coastal remnant features sandy beaches backed by low, open, eucalypt and she-oak woodlands with a camping area set behind the fore dunes on the creek's northern shore. There is no camping area on the creek's southern side.
