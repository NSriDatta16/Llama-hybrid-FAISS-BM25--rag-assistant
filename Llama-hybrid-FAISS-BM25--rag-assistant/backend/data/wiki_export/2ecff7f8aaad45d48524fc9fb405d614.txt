History 
Starting in the late 19th century it was common for the wealthy of Harrisburg to buy rural plots of land to vacation for the summer. In 1903, congressman Marlin Olmsted of Harrisburg purchased 69 acres as a summer farm residence named "Cedar Cliff". Following his passing, his widow remarried Vance C. McCormick, whose family maintained Cedar Cliff until 1954 when it was sold to prominent architect William Lynch Murray of Shipoke, Harrisburg. 

Cedar Cliff High school was formed from the merger of West Shore High School (Closed Lemoyne Middle School) and New Cumberland High School (New Cumberland Middle School) in 1959. West Shore's colors, navy blue and silver, would merge with New Cumberland's navy blue and gold, to make Cedar Cliff's colors, navy blue, gold, and silver. The West Shore Joint School System would become the West Shore School District in 1966, the year that Red Land High School opened.
