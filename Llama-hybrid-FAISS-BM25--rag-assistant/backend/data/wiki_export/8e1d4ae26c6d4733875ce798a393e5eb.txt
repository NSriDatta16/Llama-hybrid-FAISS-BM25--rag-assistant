The Congregation of the Most Holy Rosary of the Order of Preachers, better known as the Dominican Sisters of Sinsinawa is an American religious institute of the Regular, or religious branch of the Third Order of St. Dominic. It was founded in 1847. The General Motherhouse is located in Sinsinawa, Wisconsin.

History
The congregation was founded in 1847 by Samuel Mazzuchelli, O.P., (1806-1864) a pioneer Italian Dominican friar and missionary priest to the Upper Midwest. By the time of the founder's death in 1864, the community numbered nearly 25, and had blossomed to 100 within a decade. By the end of the century, the congregation had grown to almost 400 Sisters, and had begun to spread to work in schools throughout the region. Growth continued until the mid-20th century, when the congregation peaked at nearly 2,000 members in the 1960s. Like many other religious institutes, numbers then began to drop dramatically after the Second Vatican Council.

Overview
The motherhouse of the congregation, Sinsinawa Mound, has been called the "Hill of Grace". Since 1847, more than 3,200 women have ascended its slopes to take their vows as Sinsinawa Dominican Sisters, then departed to preach and teach the Gospel. Today, the Mound still serves as the motherhouse for about 250 sisters and more than 200 associates.

Apostolate
Sinsinawa Dominicans are called to proclaim the Gospel through the ministry of preaching and teaching to participate in the building of a holy and just society. These Dominican Sisters are associated with Edgewood College in Madison, Wisconsin (edgewood.edu), and Dominican University in River Forest, Illinois.
