Lindbergh High School is a public high school in the Lindbergh School District. It is in Sappington, an unincorporated area in St. Louis County, Missouri, in the suburbs of St. Louis. It is the only high school in the district. The 2022 graduating class had 555 students.

History

The school district was founded in 1949 but the first schools appeared in the district as far back as 1939.  The high school was originally named Grandview. Its mascot was the Griffin and the school colors were maroon and gold. During the high school's first academic year in 1950–51, classes were held in the basement and boiler room of the district's Sappington School elementary building.  Construction began on the new high school in 1951, and classes began at the site in September of that year, even though the building was still under construction.

The school district decided that the name Grandview sounded too much like a rest home, so in April 1952, the school was renamed Lindbergh, after world-acclaimed pilot Charles Lindbergh.  Its students became the Flyers and the school colors became green and gold.  The mascot later became Lindy, sporting a chicken or eagle-like costume.  In the fall of 2007, Lindy sported a new look: A black eagle, sporting a flight jacket, aviation cap and aviation goggles, as part of The Green Machine, a student spirit organization known for its rowdy antics.  In 1957 the district also adopted the name, becoming the Lindbergh School District.  Several new school buildings were created over the following years, several of which later closed as a result of a declining student population.

Over the past three decades, the district's population waned (and aged, leading to childless senior citizens), causing the student body to drop significantly over the years. Lindbergh was the first school in Missouri to  offer the International Baccalaureate program, and Lindbergh High School is the secondary school home of the St. Louis Regional Program for Exceptionally Gifted Students (PEGS). In 1995 the school received $25 million for construction and improved facilities through the approval of bond measure, Proposition R.  In 2000 and 2003 similar propositions were passed, giving the school additional revenues for improvements of infrastructure and facilities.

Proposition R and Construction 
In April 2019, voters who live in the district approved Proposition R, which would spend $105 million (to be raised by a bond issue, without raising taxes) on construction projects in the district. $80 million was allocated to demolish and rebuild parts of the high school (the school consists of multiple buildings), with the other $25 million spent on constructing secure entrances in other schools. The proposition was approved with 77% of the vote (57.15% was needed to approve the measure). The project is organized into three phases.

Phase 1 began in May 2020 and was completed in September 2020. It included the demolition of the old Math Building and main office and the installation of a utility building on the site of the Math Building. Phase 1 also included removal of asbestos, which was a problem on the nearly 70 year old campus. Construction was done by Wachter, Inc. (with the exception of the asbestos work, which was done by Talbert, Inc.)

Phase 2 began in September 2020 and is scheduled to be completed in January 2023. It consists of remodeling existing buildings and building a new 3-story building that will connect buildings on campus. Construction was done by BSI Constructors, Inc.

Phase 3 is scheduled to begin in January 2023 and will involve demolishing the Auditorium and another building, and repaving parking areas. The contractor has not yet been selected.
