Alfred-Pierre Joseph Agache (; 29 August 1843 – 15 September 1915), also known simply as Alfred Agache, was a French academic painter.

Biography

Little is known of Agache's life. He was born in Lille, France, and exhibited his work frequently in Paris. He seems to have specialized in portraits and large-scale allegorical paintings. He was a member of the Société des Artistes Français, and won a third-class medal in 1885 for his work. He may have been friends with American painter James Abbott McNeill Whistler and French writer Auguste Angellier; the latter dedicated a book to him around 1893. A portrait of his wife was painted by Aimé Morot.

Awards
At the 1889 Paris Exposition Universelle he was decorated by a silver medal, and then a gold medal during the subsequent 1893 Chicago World's Columbian Exposition, where two of his pieces, "Vanity" and "The Annunciation", were exhibited.

By decree in 10 August 1899 (declaration: 24 August 1899), he was awarded a knighthood in France's Legion of Honour, which was upgraded to the rank of officer by decree on 16 May 1910 (declaration: 25 June 1910).

Death
He died in Lille in 1915.

"L'Épée"

One of these paintings, L'Épée (French, "The Sword"), painted in 1896, includes the Latin phrase "PRO IUSTITIA TANTUM" ("On behalf of Justice Only") to represent that violence should be used only by Justice. It was displayed at the Paris Salon that year. It was purchased by the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE) in 1916 from an exhibition of paintings that were currently on loan from France. Following the CNE's decision in 1938 to cease collecting and exhibiting European art, the painting (with other French works) was loaned to the Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO); in the mid-1960s these works were formally donated to the AGO. This painting remained in the AGO's vaults until the early 1990s; it was cleaned and restored and displayed in the AGO's Fudger Gallery.

In June 2005, "L'Épée" was included in an exhibition called "Favourites: Your Choices from Our Collection", which displayed works based on votes from the general public from the previous four months.
