The 8th Critics' Choice Awards were presented on January 17, 2003, honoring the finest achievements of 2002 filmmaking.

This ceremony is particularly notable for the moment when Best Actor nominee Robin Williams came up on stage after being called upon by Best Actor co-winner Jack Nicholson, who claimed to be "baked", to assist him with his acceptance speech, culminating in what is considered to be the funniest moment in the awards' history. The moment was uploaded on YouTube in July 2009; it currently has over 4 million views.
