The Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences (Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales; FCEN), commonly and informally known as Exactas, is the natural science school of the University of Buenos Aires, the largest university in Argentina.

It occupies several buildings of the Ciudad Universitaria complex in the Núñez neighbourhood of Buenos Aires. The computer science, mathematics and physics departments occupy the Pabellón 1, while the other departments are located at the Pabellón 2. Other building at the complex are also used for its academical and research activities such as the Pabellón de Industrias with the Faculty of Engineering or are wholly dedicated to research institutes operated in conjunction with Argentina's national research council CONICET (see list below).

Master degrees
 Atmospheric Sciences
 Oceanography
 Biological Sciences
This Master´s degree Programme consists of three stages:  1) the Common Basic Cycle (CBC), as required for all careers at the University of Buenos Aires,  2) the Basic Professional Cycle of Biological Sciences (CPB) and 3) the Superior  Professional Cycle (CPS). The CPB, which comprises 13 subjects, concentrates all the scientist's basic training. The CPS consists of 10 subjects (or 9 subjects and a bachelor's thesis) and is carried out in the orientation chosen by the student. Different from the CPB, the CPS curriculum is not rigid, but each student must agree on a study plan under the guidance of a teacher (Study Plan´s Tutor).

The subjects of the complete Study plan and the corresponding requirement of study hours can be found here "Plan de Estudio":
 Computer Sciences
 Physical Sciences
 Geological Sciences
 Mathematical Sciences
 Chemical Sciences
 Paleontology

Postgraduate degrees
The School also offers Masters of Science and Ph.D. degrees.
