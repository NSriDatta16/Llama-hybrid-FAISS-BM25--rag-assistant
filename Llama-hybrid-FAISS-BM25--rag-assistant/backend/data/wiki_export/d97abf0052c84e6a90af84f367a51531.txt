Pickhill is a village in North Yorkshire, England,  west of Thirsk. It forms part of Hambleton District, and is a part of the civil parish of Pickhill with Roxby.

History

The Roman road, Dere Street, passed close to the village following the route of the modern A1(M) motorway.

The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book as Picala. The manor at the time of the Norman invasion was split between Sprot and Thor. Afterwards it passed to Count Alan of Brittany. Up to the 16th century, the manor was largely owned by the Neville family, with some having been given to Fountains Abbey. Thereafter it was split in two and was the possession of the Byerley and Meynell families until the 18th century.

Pickhill with Roxby was a large ancient parish, which comprised the townships of Ainderby Quernhow, Holme, Howe, Pickhill with Roxby, Sinderby and Swainby with Allerthorpe.  All these townships became separate civil parishes in 1866.

The village used to have a station in the North Eastern Railway region on the Ripon to Northallerton Line. The old Station House can be found on Cross Lane. It was functioning between March 1875 and September 1959.

Roxby 
Roxby is a deserted medieval village about  west of the village, recorded in 1198.  By the 20th century it was reduced to a single farmhouse, Roxby House.  The farmhouse was demolished in 1994 to make way for the construction of the A1(M) motorway.
