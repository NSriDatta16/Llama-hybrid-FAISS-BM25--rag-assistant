Oh we're from Tigerland
A fighting fury we're from Tigerland
In any weather you will see us with a grin, Risking head and shin
If we're behind, we never mind we'll fight and fight and win
Oh we're from Tigerland
We never weaken til the final sirens goes
Like the tigers of old, we're strong and we're bold
Oh we're from Tiger
-YELLOW AND BLACK-
Oh we're from Tigerland
-EAT 'EM ALIVE-
We're from Tigerland
