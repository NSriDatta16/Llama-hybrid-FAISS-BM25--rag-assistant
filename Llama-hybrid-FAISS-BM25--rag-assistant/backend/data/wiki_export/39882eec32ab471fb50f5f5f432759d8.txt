Heath Hayes were Staffordshire County League (South) Division One champions in 1976–77 and were promoted to the Premier Division. They won the league's Premier Trophy in 1986–87 and went on to win the Premier Division title the following season. After retaining the Premier Division title in 1988–89 and returning to the Five Ways Inn in 1989, the club adopted their current name and moved up to the Staffordshire Senior League.
