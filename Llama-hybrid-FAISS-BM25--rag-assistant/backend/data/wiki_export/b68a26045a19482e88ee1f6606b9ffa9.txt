Compiled by Gareth Hughes, based on the preliminary list of drawings held in the RIBA Drawings Collection.

This is as complete a list as can be achieved, although some works have gone unrecorded because of the loss of most of Clough Williams-Ellis's office papers in a fire in 1951. In addition, a number of drawings in the collection are not from Clough's office and may represent schemes on which he was asked to comment, rather than design projects by him.

 – entries marked thus are known or reputed to be by Clough but are not represented in the RIBA Drawings Collection.

RIBA Catalogue references are shown as [general location / file], or file(sheets) where there is more than one sheet of drawings for a project.
