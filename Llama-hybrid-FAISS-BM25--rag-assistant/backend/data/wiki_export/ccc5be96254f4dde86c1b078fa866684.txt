The Chords were an American doo-wop vocal group formed in 1951 in The Bronx, New York, known for their 1954 hit "Sh-Boom", which they wrote. It is the only song they created that reached mainstream popularity.

Career
The group was formed by friends from a high school based in the Bronx, New York City, United States. The initial members were the brothers Carl and Claude Feaster, plus Jimmy Keyes, Floyd McRae, William Edwards, with support from the pianist Rupert Branker. The Chords were one of the early acts to be signed to Cat Records, a subsidiary label of Atlantic Records.

Their debut single was a doo-wop version of a Patti Page song "Cross Over the Bridge", and the record label reluctantly allowed a number penned by the Chords on the B-side. That track was "Sh-Boom", which quickly became the more popular side. The record reached the top 2 of the U.S. pop chart, which was then a unique occurrence for an R&B number. The track was covered by The Crew-Cuts, who took the song to the top of the charts, arguably registering the first U.S. rock and roll number one hit record.

The enthusiasm doo-wop fans had for the Chords' music was dampened when Gem Records claimed that one of the groups on its roster was called the Chords; consequently the group changed their name to the Chordcats. Their success was a one-off as subsequent releases, including "Zippity-Zum", all failed to chart. A round of personnel changes and recordings on a variety of labels all failed to reignite the public's interest.
