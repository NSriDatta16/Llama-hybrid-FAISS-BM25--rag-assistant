Whipped Cream & Other Delights is a 1965 album by Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass, called "Herb Alpert's Tijuana Brass" for this album, released on A&M Records. It is the band's fourth full album and arguably their most popular release.

This album saw the band nearly abandoning its Mexican-themed music, featuring mostly instrumental arrangements of popular songs, and also generating some major pop hits for the first time since "The Lonely Bull". One "tradition" of the early Brass was to include a number rendered in "strip-tease" fashion, and this album's entry for that style was "Love Potion No. 9".

Influence

Whipped Cream & Other Delights sold over 6 million copies in the United States and the album cover alone is considered a classic pop culture icon. It featured model Dolores Erickson wearing chiffon and shaving cream. The picture was taken at a time when Erickson was three months pregnant. The album cover was so popular with Alpert fans that, during concerts, when about to play the song "Whipped Cream," Alpert would jokingly tell the audience, "Sorry, we can't play the album cover for you!"

The art was parodied by several groups including once A&M band Soul Asylum, who made fun of the liner notes along with the back cover on their 1989 EP Clam Dip & Other Delights

Singles taken from the album included "A Taste of Honey," "Whipped Cream" and "Lollipops and Roses". The latter two of these were eventually featured on the ABC-TV series The Dating Game: "Whipped Cream" as the intro to the bachelorette, and "Lollipops and Roses" as the theme used when the bachelor(ette) learned about the person chosen for the date. "Spanish Flea", a song taken from the TJB's next album Going Places, was used as the theme for the bachelor.

Up until this album, Alpert had used Los Angeles area studio musicians to back him on his records. On this album, eventual members of the Tijuana Brass (John Pisano, guitar and Bob Edmondson, trombone) were featured as well as elite session musicians from the Wrecking Crew: Hal Blaine (drums), Carol Kaye (electric bass), Chuck Berghofer (double bass), and Russell Bridges (who would later become famous in his own right as Leon Russell). With the success of Whipped Cream & Other Delights came huge demands for concert appearances.  It was at this time that Alpert formed the public version of the Tijuana Brass which included: Pisano, Edmondson, Nick Ceroli (drums), Pat Senatore (bass), Tonni Kalash (trumpet), Lou Pagani (piano) as well as Julius Wechter on marimba and vibes (studio only).

A remix of the album was released in 2006 on the Shout Factory label with model Bree Condon "clothed" on the cover in a similar fashion to the original.

The album is seen briefly in the movie The Big Lebowski when The Dude is looking through Maude's record collection. It is also seen in The Boondock Saints when Rocco frantically gathers his possessions after killing three associates in a diner. It is seen among other period albums early in The Honeymoon Killers, and can also be spotted in the living room of the Weir household in multiple episodes of Freaks and Geeks.
