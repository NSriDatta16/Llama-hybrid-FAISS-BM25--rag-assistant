A nāḥiyah ( , plural nawāḥī  ), also nahiya or nahia, is a regional or local type of administrative division that usually consists of a number of villages or sometimes smaller towns. In Tajikistan, it is a second-level division while in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan, Xinjiang, and the former Ottoman Empire, where it was also called a bucak, it is a third-level or lower division. It can constitute a division of a qadaa, mintaqah or other such district-type division and is sometimes translated as "subdistrict".

Ottoman Empire 
The nahiye () was an administrative territorial entity of the Ottoman Empire, smaller than a . The head was a  (governor) who was appointed by the Pasha.

The  was a subdivision of a  and corresponded roughly to a city with its surrounding villages. s, in turn, were divided into s (each governed by a ) and villages (, each governed by a ).  Revisions of 1871 to the administrative law established the  (still governed a ) as an intermediate level between the kaza and the village.

The term was adopted by the Principality of Serbia (1817–1833) and Principality of Montenegro (1852–1910), as  ().
