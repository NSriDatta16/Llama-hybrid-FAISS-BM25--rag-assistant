A private hospital was founded on August 22, 1922, the province granted a Charter of Incorporation for the York County Hospital Corporation.  York County Hospital became a public hospital in 1924. In 1927 the new hospital building was completed by architects Craig and Madill. In 1946, the Margaret Johnson Davis Wing opened with 55 beds. In 1956, the South Wing opened and a six-storey tower opened in 1964.  Capacity was increased to 420 beds with the opening of the East Wing in 1976.  On September 12, 1998, the name of the hospital was changed from York County Hospital to the present name. In 1999, a project to further expand the hospital was begun
