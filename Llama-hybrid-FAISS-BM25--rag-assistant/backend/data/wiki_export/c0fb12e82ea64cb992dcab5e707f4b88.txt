Griphognathus (from   'riddle') and   'jaw') is an extinct genus of lungfish from the late Devonian period of Europe and Australia.

Griphognathus was a specialized lungfish, about  long, with an elongated snout. The lower jaw and palate were lined with tooth-like denticles. Like all other lungfish, its skin was covered by overlapping scales, and it had an asymmetrical tail.
