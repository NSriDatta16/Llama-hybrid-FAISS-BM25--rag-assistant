Before Eurovision

Dansk Melodi Grand Prix 2006 
Dansk Melodi Grand Prix 2006 was the 36th edition of Dansk Melodi Grand Prix, the music competition that selects Denmark's entries for the Eurovision Song Contest. The event was held on 11 February 2006 at the Gigantium in Aalborg, hosted by Adam Duvå Hall and Mads Vangsø with Græker-Kaj hosting segments from the green room. The show was televised on DR1 as well as streamed online at the official DR website. The national final was watched by 1.651 million viewers in Denmark.

Competing entries 
DR opened a submission period between 17 June 2005 and 10 October 2005 for composers to submit their entries. All composers and lyricists were required to be Danish citizens or have been registered as a Danish resident from 1 July 2005 to 20 May 2006. The broadcaster received 336 entries during the submission period. A selection committee selected ten songs from the entries submitted to the broadcaster, while the artists of the selected entries were chosen by DR in consultation with their composers. DR held a press meet and greet at the DR Byen in Copenhagen on 8 December 2005 where the competing artists and songs were announced and officially presented. Among the artists were Helge Engelbrecht (member of Neighbours) who represented Denmark in the Eurovision Song Contest 1987 as part of Bandjo, Trine Jepsen who represented Denmark in the Eurovision Song Contest 1999, and Søren Poppe who represented Denmark in the Eurovision Song Contest 2001 as part of Rollo and King.

Final

In the first round of voting the top five advanced to the superfinal. In the superfinal, the winner, "Twist of Love" performed by Sidsel Ben Semmane, was selected. Viewers were able to vote via telephone or SMS and the voting results of each of Denmark's four regions in the superfinal were converted to points which were distributed as follows: 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 points.
