The Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) is an Indian autonomous scientific society, operating under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology.

History

C-DAC was created in November 1987, initially as the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing Technology (C-DACT). In 1988, the US Government refused to sell India a Cray supercomputer  due to concerns about India using it to develop nuclear weapons. In response India started development of its own supercomputer, and C-DACT was created as part of this programme.

Dr Vijay Bhatkar was hired as the director of C-DACT. The project was given an initial run of three years and an initial funding of 30,00,00,000, the cost of a Cray supercomputer.

A prototype computer was benchmarked at the 1990 Zurich Super-computing Show. It demonstrated that India had the second most powerful, publicly demonstrated, supercomputer in the world after the United States.

The final result of the effort was the PARAM 8000, released in 1991. 

The National Centre for Software Technology, Electronic Research and Development Centre and CEDTI were merged into C-DAC in 2003.
