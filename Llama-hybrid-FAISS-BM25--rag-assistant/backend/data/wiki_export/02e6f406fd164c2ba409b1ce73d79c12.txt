Kamtapur is an autonomous area in the Assam state of India administered by the Kamatapur Autonomous Council.

History
Kamtapur is a very ancient city, it was known as "Kampilya" according to Purana and Mahabharata.
Kamatapur emerged as a sovereign state in the middle of the 13th century, and it continued through fluctuating levels of prosperity until the year 1498, when its last capital at Gosanimari was attacked by the invading army of Alauddin Husain Shah of Bengal. 

The ancient kingdom of Kamatapur was located in the western Brahmaputra Valley. Most probably, Nalrajar Garh in Chilapata forest was its earliest capital. Through a long course of changes and developments the capital shifted to Maynaguri and then to Prithu Rajar Garh, Singijani and finally Gosanimari, an ancient river port-town since the seventh century. After the kingdom's end, the Koch Kingdom emerged with its capital at Hingulavas in the Dooars.

Nilambar was the last ruler of Kamatapur. He was defeated by Alauddin Husain Shah in 1970.
