History 
Nieheim, with its more than 750-year-old history reaches well back into the Middle Ages. From its beginnings as a community, it grew after being granted municipal privileges (lower court rights, market rights and minting rights, among others) in Bishop Bernhard IV's time (1228–1247), into today's town of Nieheim. After quickly developing from a former farming town and Hanseatic member, Nieheim has risen today to be a climatic spa with a function as a minor centre, and a mediaeval town with flair.

Coat of arms

These arms date from 1591 at the latest, and the colours are those borne by the old Prince-Bishopric of Paderborn, among whose many holdings was Nieheim. The orbs stand for Saint Nicholas, the town's patron saint.

The coat of arms was granted on 18 July 1908.

The Catholic Parish Church of Saint Nicholas with its artistically relief-decorated baptismal font and late Gothic little sacramental house has parts that were built as early as the 13th century.

The Protestant Church of the Cross (Kreuzkirche) was built in a neo-Gothic style in 1868–1869.

The Gut Holzhausen estate is a biodynamic farm and the venue for a summer festival called Voices.

"Holsterturm" landmark 
As Nieheim's landmark, the Holsterturm (tower) on a nearby bank south of the main town, can look back on a 700-year history.

Mediaeval vault system 
Unique in Westphalia is the vault system through which runs the Nikolausbach (brook), which rises below the Holsterberg (mountain) and runs through the middle of town in this mediaeval vault system.

Weberhaus Nieheim 
The Weberhaus Nieheim, the doctor, poet and politician Friedrich Wilhelm Weber's former abode, today houses a widely known Kolping diocesan training centre and a Heimvolkshochschule, which lends itself well to any form of training work and has at its disposal the best technical equipment.

Also, the Pan-German Education Centre of Youth in Europe (Gesamtdeutsche Bildungsstätte der Deutschen Jugend in Europa) in Nieheim-Himmighausen offers extensive seminars for groups geared towards various ends.

Nieheimer Flechthecke 
Typical of countryside scenery around Nieheim is what is called Flechthecke, meaning, roughly, "braided hedge". The hedges themselves are mostly – about 80% – hazelnut growth, all planted in a row. Here and there are found the odd hawthorn and single wild roses. Trimmed willow trees, about 2 m high, serve as living fenceposts to keep the hedges steady. Young withes are taken from these willows to do the braiding. If dairy cows or horses are to be kept in the paddock ringed by one of these braided hedges, blackthorn twigs are also tied onto the inside to thwart any nibbling. A finished hedge has a height of roughly 1.5 m and is braided in three layers.

Telegraph station no. 32 
As a relic of an almost forgotten communication technology, a reconstructed optical telegraph station still stands high over the countryside near Oeynhausen. This is run by the Oeynhausen history club (Heimatverein), and guided tours are available to those who wish them.

Culinary specialities 
In Nieheim, a kind of cheese is made, Nieheimer Käse (Nieheim cheese), a sour milk cheese nowadays made by only one cheesemaker. It had almost been forgotten, but is now becoming better known thanks to tourism. It is ripened in wooden moulds in a warm place and then seasoned with salt and caraway. Depending on the ripening time, it can be a Handkäse, a cooking cheese or a hard grating cheese.
