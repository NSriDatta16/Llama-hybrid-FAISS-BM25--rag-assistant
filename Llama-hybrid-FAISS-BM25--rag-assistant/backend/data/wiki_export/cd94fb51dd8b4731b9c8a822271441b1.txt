Nightmare in A-Minor is the third and final studio album by the hip hop supergroup Gravediggaz, recorded by two remaining members (Poetic and Frukwan) and released after Poetic's death.

By this time, RZA and Prince Paul had left the group, and Poetic died after his 2-year fight with Colon cancer. The album was produced by Too Poetic, Frukwan, LG, Diamond J, and True Master (For Wu-Tang Productions) and features guest appearances from Wu-Tang affiliates Killarmy and Sunz of Man, and an intro from fellow member Prince Paul, introducing new Gravediggaz DJ Diamond J as a member of the group. Too Poetic rhymes about his terminal illness on the track "Burn, Baby, Burn." Executive producers were J.Collins & P. Klein. The album was released with three different covers. Six tracks from the album appear on the compilation Six Feet Under under different titles and released without permission by any surviving Gravediggaz members as legal actions are in pursuit. Earlier versions of the album contain the extra songs "Current Events" and "Betta Wake up."
