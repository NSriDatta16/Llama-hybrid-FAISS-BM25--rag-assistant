The Tony Award for Best Special Theatrical Event was awarded from 2001 to 2009 to live theatrical productions that were not plays or musicals. The category was created after the 2000 controversy of Contact winning Best Musical; the show used pre-recorded music and featured no singing. The category was retired in 2009 allowing the shows that were previously eligible for it to be eligible in Best Play or Best Musical categories, if they met the proper criteria. The shows are also now eligible in other creative categories.

In 1999 and 2000 a Special Tony Award for a Live Theatrical Presentation was awarded which may be seen as the precursor of the Best Special Theatrical Event award and is generally included in this award's listing.
