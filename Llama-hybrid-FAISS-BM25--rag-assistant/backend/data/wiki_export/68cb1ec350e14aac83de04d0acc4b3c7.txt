John Charles Morgan (born 9 August 1955) is an English musician, singer and songwriter.

Early years
Charlie Morgan was born in Hammersmith, London. He became professional in 1973.

Music career
By the mid-1980s, Charlie Morgan had become one of the top session drummers in the UK. In the 1980s he played on albums by artists including Elton John, Gary Moore, Justin Hayward, Kate Bush, Roy Harper, Pete Townshend, Judie Tzuke, Clannad, Tracey Ullman and Nik Kershaw. He was also the drummer in Gary Moore & Phil Lynott's video "Out in the Fields".

In 1985 his drumming work with Nik Kershaw attracted the attention of Elton John, who booked him to play on his Ice on Fire album. Later that year John invited him to play with his band at Live Aid. This was the start of a thirteen-year period of recording and touring with John.

Morgan co-wrote the theme music to the ITV TV series, The Bill, with bassist Andy Pask.
