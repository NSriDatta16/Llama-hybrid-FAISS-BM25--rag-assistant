Bryan Christopher Barker (born June 28, 1964) is a former American football punter in the National Football League (NFL).

Barker last played for the St. Louis Rams in 2005.  Barker has previously played with the Kansas City Chiefs, the Philadelphia Eagles, the Jacksonville Jaguars, the Washington Redskins, and the Green Bay Packers.

On November 28, 2002, during week 13 of the NFL season against the Dallas Cowboys, Barker experienced a severely broken nose, a subdural hematoma, while playing in a nationally televised game.

Aaron Schatz of statistics site Football Outsiders noted a punt Barker kicked "in 1999 that was just ridiculous, far past any baseline I had ever created. In Week 5, on the road against the Jets, [Barker] punted the ball from the Jaguars' own 5-yard line to the Jets' 12-yard line, an 83-yard punt
