Musical style
Driscoll is known for his bluesy and varied style, which he also infuses into gospel, inspirational, and patriotic songs. Driscoll's raspy, blues-like voice has been compared to Ray Charles, Joe Cocker and Michael Bolton. His sound ranges from classic rock to country, gospel, patriotic, R&B, pop, and classical styles. He is widely known as being a rare white singer who sings in a convincing black gospel style. As one independent 2006 analysis puts it, "Driscoll has a bluesy-gospel ('soul') style and sings in a course, guttural voice that sounds very much like Ray Charles."

He is noted for incorporating the sound of soul, R&B, rock 'n' roll, jazz, and blues into the inspirational genre.  "God's funky too", he said in a 1980s interview, noting that he was keen on eliminating stereotyped opinions about inspirational music. In a 1999 interview for Billboard magazine, he reiterated this, saying, "If you're a football player and you become a Christian, you don't suddenly start playing Christian football." Driscoll incorporated his bluesy, soulful jazz horn-playing and singing into Christmas music in his 2000 album, The Spirit of Christmas, which includes a jazz version of "O Little Town of Bethlehem" played on muted flugelhorn and sung in a slow improvisational jazz style.

Musicianship
Driscoll is celebrated for his virtuosic, inspirational, and quite varied trumpet playing. He is also known as one of the few trumpeters who can reach and play well in the very highest of notes and ranges. His combination trumpet and singing performances are noted for their smooth transitions from trumpet playing to singing to glossolalia, and back again. And in addition to his well-known trumpet playing and his distinctive style of singing, Driscoll is also skilled on the keyboard, and on the flugelhorn, and he also performs on the shofar, cornet, and flumpet.

Driscoll's performances and recordings include many mainstream and bluesy works such as "The Long and Winding Road", "You're the Best Thing That Ever Happened to Me", "You Are So Beautiful",  "You Don't Know Me", "Georgia on My Mind", "Have I Told You Lately That I Love You?",  "You Raise Me Up", and "Amazing Grace". In ceremonial and patriotic performances he is known for his virtuosic and inspirational trumpet and vocal renditions of "America the Beautiful", "God Bless America", "The Battle Hymn of the Republic", and other patriotic favorites.

Personal life
Driscoll married his wife Lynne in 1978. He and Lynne have two children, Jamie and Danielle, and Driscoll has a son, Shawn, from his previous marriage to Patti McDavitt. 
He married Darlene Bishop in 2018. He resides in Ohio. Driscoll lived in Cleveland, Tennessee from the early 1980s. In the mid-2000s he relocated to Greensboro, Georgia. Driscoll is an accomplished pilot, with commercial, instrument and multi engine ratings.

Cocaine Trafficking Indictment
In January 1978, Driscoll was one of 32 people indicted by a Texas federal grand jury on charges of being part of a cocaine trafficking conspiracy. Also indicted was actress Linda Blair. Driscoll was arrested after nineteen federal agents surrounded his home during a sting operation stemming from a government wiretap. Following the indictment, Driscoll wrote a letter to the court stating that he had "found God" about three weeks before his arrest, on Christmas Day 1977. Driscoll was charged with three felony counts of conspiracy to distribute cocaine, but was eventually allowed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge of cocaine possession. He was placed on probation and his criminal record later expunged. Driscoll said in a 1986 newspaper interview that he was "doing a lot of drugs", and he was reported to have had a $5,000-dollar a day cocaine habit, prior to his religious conversion and subsequent arrest.

Tax Evasion
In 2006, Phil Driscoll and his wife Lynne Driscoll were indicted in U.S. Federal Court for using their Cleveland, Tennessee-based Christian music ministry in an income-tax cheating scheme, failing to report more than $1 million in income and evading the payment of more than $300,000 in taxes from 1996 to 2000. Also indicted was Lynne Driscoll’s mother, bookkeeper Chris Blankenship, who died just before the trial. The Driscolls ministry took in as much as $2.8 million annually, and according to the prosecution, Phil Driscoll owned an airplane, drove a Porsche, and used money funneled through Mighty Horn Ministries (later renamed Phil Driscoll Ministries and relocated to Eatonton, Georgia), to buy and sell lake houses. Rick Blankenship, brother of Lynne Driscoll and former U.S. Ambassador to the Bahamas, testified on behalf of the prosecution that he had worked for Mighty Horn Ministries until he became concerned that “there was little or no differentiation between personal and ministry expenses." On June 8, 2006, Phil Driscoll was found guilty on 2 counts of tax evasion and one count of conspiracy, and was sentenced to serve one year in Federal prison, beginning on March 14, 2007. Following his release, Driscoll wrote and co-produced an autobiographical film about his experiences, starring Danny Glover and Brian Dennehy.
