Concept and creation

When watching Tsubasa Chronicle, Maaya Sakamoto felt that Syaoran's straightforward feelings and strength to protect Sakura were very touching. Within "Kazemachi Jet", the ending theme of second season of the anime television series Tsubasa Chronicle, she tried to capture the image of Syaoran growing from his "naive" self into a young man as a result of experiencing the repetition of meetings and partings over his journey and Syaoran continuing to try to protect his loved one in spite of the mishaps along the way. In "Spica", an insert song into Tsubasa Chronicle that was sold alongside "Kazemachi Jet", she tried to capture the Sakura's feminine and maternal strength as one with courage to continually move forward despite the odds but also ability to show weakness at times. In "Saigo no Kajitsu", the ending of the OVA series Tsubasa Tokyo Revelations, she worked once more with Shōko Suzuki whom she had been with for three years prior and thus was very comfortable working with. She described having created the song as beginning quietly and building up into a magnificent and dramatic song as a wave washes over the surface of still water. She wrote its lyrics trying to capture the feelings of the characters who learn that the Syaoran whom they had been traveling with was in reality a copy and their desire to continue to choose their own future despite knowing the reason why Syaoran was cloned and what they would face by choosing to continuing their journey.

Kinya Kotani has been a fan of Clamp's work for quite some time and was extremely happy when he could take part in creating the theme music for adaptations of the group's work. When Kinya Kotani wrote the lyrics for the theme music for Tsubasa Chronicle and the anime film Tsubasa Chronicle the Movie: The Princess of the Country of Birdcages as if he were Syaoran. Kotani had to deliver both "Blaze" and "Aerial"—the opening themes for the first season of the anime series and the opening for the anime film respectively—on a tight schedule. When first creating "Aerial", he described always having the word "aerial" in his mind. He wrote the lyrics by comparing the universe of Tsubasa Chronicle with the everything that he had written so far. When creating the opening theme song "It's" for the second season of the anime, he tried to capture the sad feel of Syaoran's strength in his singing; he tried to create a clear image of Syaoran's feelings in writing the song's lyrics, both Syaoran's forwarding-facing and backward-facing characteristics. The music was designed to be simple but deep, conveying a sense of something missed and of something new. Kotani feels that "It's" is a song that conveys the feeling of one's back being propelled into a journey. For the film Yuki Kajiura was asked to create a score different from the one used in TV series in order to convey characters' states of mind. Producer Tetsuya Natakate was satisfied with the result, as Kajiura's music ended being what he hoped.

Reception
The musical score for the anime adaptation have generally received praise by critics. N.S. Davidson of IGN described the soundtrack as some of "some of the most glorious and touching music to be found in anime". Mania Entertainment's Chris Beveridge described the background music as "beautiful" and Bryan Morton of Mania Entertainment described the score as "another excellent soundtrack by Yuki Kajiura". Anime News Network's Carl Kimlinger agreed with Beveridge and Morton, however described the musical score as "apocalyptic" and "gloomy", ill-suited to the mood of the anime that helped transform the "what should have been a breezy lark ... into something muddy, ponderous, and far too serious-minded". However, both Beveridge and IGN's Chris Wyatt noted that the bass levels were overwhelming at times.

The anime's first season's theme music have received good reviews whereas the second season's theme music have not. Anime Fringe Lesley Smith described the first season's theme opening as providing a "breathtaking" introduction to the anime, taking the listener through a journey to unknown worlds similar to what the protagonists of Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle'' do. She described the first season's ending theme as "gorgeous" with "amazing" vocals and "lyrics [that] fit the song perfectly".
