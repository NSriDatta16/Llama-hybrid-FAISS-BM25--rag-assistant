Fictional character biography 
Not much is known about Murmur, apart from that he was mutated into a pseudo-vampire form by Emplate. He joined a team that Emplate gathered to torment Generation X, including Bulwark, Vincente, and DOA. In an uncharacteristic move, Emplate not only recruited mutants for his team but a human as well: a woman named Gayle Edgerton, a Generation X member from the Chamber's past.

When Chamber's powers first manifested, he unintentionally paralyzed Gayle. Emplate offered her [Gayle] a chance for vengeance, turning her into one of his vampire minions as well. They were successful in capturing the young mutants, while M telepathically called for help, a call which was answered by the X-Man Bishop. Vincente and Murmur collaborated to try to conquer him, but when Murmur realized he would soon be defeated, he fled along with Bulwark. With Penance's realignment of alliances, they were victorious in stopping the team.

Powers and abilities 
Murmur has been de-powered during M-Day. He had superhuman strength and durability. He could open teleportation portals in space via his line of sight.

Murmur (Arlette Truffaut) 

Murmur (Arlette Truffaut) belongs to the subspecies of humans called mutants, who are born with superhuman abilities. She is a former member of the superhero team Alpha Flight. She is currently in Beta Flight.

Fictional character biography 
Murmur became a member of Alpha Flight while the team was being heavily influenced by the Canadian government. One of her main duties is to mentally control the powerful beast known as Sasquatch, believed to be former Alpha Flight member Walter Langowski. During one of her first missions, against the criminal organization known as Zodiac, she lost control of Sasquatch. Murmur and some of her teammates were briefly mind controlled by Mesmero. Though she broke free, she couldn't take control of Sasquatch in time and he injured her. Manbot sedated Sasquatch. 

Murmur joins the team to kidnap Wolverine for the supposed murder of the ex-Alpha Flight member Box.  

The team meets up with Wolverine on a heavily forested road near an abandoned gas station. Murmur and Sasquatch, with Wolverine, investigate the hopping form of a man, who was the powerful mutant, Sauron.

Wolverine summons help and a fight break out between the two teams. It concludes on peaceful terms, due to the willingness of teammate Flex who wanted to talk instead of battle. Also, Alpha Flight is unsure of the motives behind the fight, as they have uncovered discrepancies. 

The mind-controlling leader of Alpha Flight, Jeremey Clarke, died in a battle with the criminal organization known as Zodiac. Murmur was shot in the leg by Zodiac members and was sidelined from action for some time.

Powers and abilities 
Murmur has been de-powered during M-Day. Her mind control ability allowed her to control the minds of others by touch. They are completely under her control and obey her verbal commands. Puck immediately fell asleep when Murmur touched him and used her power. She also has been shown to free people that were under Mesmero's control. She also demonstrated that she could directly kill a person using her power.
