Daniel Ionel Oprița (born 10 August 1981) is a Romanian professional football manager and former football player.

Club career 
Oprița began his career at FCM Reșița in 2000 in Liga II, the second tier of the Romanian football pyramid. In 2002, he moved on to Steaua București, making the step up to Liga I in the top tier of the Romanian football. Oprița spent the next seven years of his career in Bucharest winning the Divizia A in 2004–05 and 2005–06 and also the Supercupa României in 2005–06. He scored 14 goals in 93 appearances whilst at FCSB.

On 12 April 2007, he moved across Bucharest to play for city rivals FC Dinamo București on a four-year contract. His time at the club was not a success and he played just five games without scoring. Later, in 2008, he signed for FCM UTA Arad based in Arad in the west of the country.

After one season with the club, Oprița terminated his contract and moved to south-east Spain to play for Lorca Deportiva CF of the Segunda División B, the third tier of the Spanish football league system. Oprița failed to settle in Spain and returned to Romania after just one month and three games. Due to the Transfer window being closed, he was unable to sign for a new team until the winter break. In January 2009, he signed a six-month loan contract with FC Aarau of the Swiss Super League.

Style of play 
Despite playing as a striker, Oprița did not score many goals, he was a more of a target man and his main ability was to create spaces for his teammates, where many goals were from. He was very committed while playing, and he was also technically gifted.

International career 
For Romania, Oprița was capped six times and scoring one goal. He made his debut in 2003 against Ukraine.
