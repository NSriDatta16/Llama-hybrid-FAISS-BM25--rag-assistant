Elections

2011 special

In 2011, Tomblin stated his desire to run for the governorship. Following a ruling by the Supreme Court of Appeals on January 18, 2011, a special gubernatorial election was scheduled for October 4, 2011. Tomblin was successful in the Democratic primary, beating a field of six contenders, while Morgantown businessman Bill Maloney emerged as the Republican nominee in the May 14 primary. Tomblin went on to win the general election against Maloney and was sworn in as governor on November 13, 2011. Immediately before taking the oath as governor, Tomblin officially resigned from both the offices of Senate President and state senator.

2012

Tomblin ran for election to a full term in 2012, and defeated Maloney in a rematch.

Tenure
In the 2016 presidential election, Tomblin endorsed fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton.

Abortion
Tomblin is anti-abortion. Despite this, in March 2014, Tomblin vetoed a bill that would have banned abortions in West Virginia after 20 weeks, which he said was due to constitutionality issues. In March 2015, Tomblin again vetoed the bill; however, his veto was overridden by the West Virginia legislature.

Approval ratings
A May 2013 survey by Republican strategist Mark Blankenship showed Tomblin's job approval rating to be at 69 percent, unchanged from two months earlier. According to a poll conducted by Public Policy Polling in September 2013, Tomblin had an approval rating of 47 percent with 35 percent disapproving, up from 44 percent in 2011.

Term limit
Tomblin was barred from running for a second full term in 2016. Under the West Virginia Constitution, a partial term counts toward the limit of two consecutive terms.

Personal life
Tomblin was married on September 8, 1979 to Joanne Jaeger, a native New Yorker and graduate of Marshall University, who served as the president of Southern West Virginia Community and Technical College from 1999 to 2015. They reside in Chapmanville and have one son, Brent. Tomblin attends the First Presbyterian Church of Logan.
