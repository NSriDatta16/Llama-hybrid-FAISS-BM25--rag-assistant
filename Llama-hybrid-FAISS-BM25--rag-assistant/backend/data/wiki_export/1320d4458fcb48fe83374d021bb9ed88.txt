History
Most ancient buildings are the ruins of the donjon, built in the 11th century and destroyed in 1425.

There is also near St Sauveur's church, dating from the 15th century.

In 768, the French king Pepin the Short offered the village of Maurepas (formerly spelled Malrepast) and its wooden keep to the Abbey of Saint-Denis. Facing the Normans' invasions, they left the domain to the Lords of Chevreuse. The castle and village were given to the family of Malrepast, a vassal of the Lords of Chevreuse, which gave its name to the village.

In 1432, during the Hundred Years' War, the English conquered the village and destroyed the keep.

After the war, the domain of Maurepas returned to the family of Chevreuse, but the castle remained a ruin.

Jean-Frédéric Phélypeaux from the Phélypeaux family, was Count of Maurepas. He was living in the next city of Jouars-Pontchartrain in the Château de Pontchartrain.
