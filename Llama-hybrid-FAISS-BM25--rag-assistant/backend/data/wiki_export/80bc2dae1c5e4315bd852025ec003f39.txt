Many fictional depictions of the Roma in literature and art present Romanticized narratives of their supposed mystical powers of fortune telling, and their supposed irascible or passionate temper which is paired with an indomitable love of freedom and a habit of criminality. Critics of how the Roma have been portrayed in popular culture point out similarities to portrayals of Jewish people, with both groups stereotyped negatively as wandering, spreading disease, abducting children, and violating and murdering others.

The Roma were portrayed in Victorian and modern British literature as having "sinister occult and criminal tendencies" and as associated with "thievery and cunning", and in English Renaissance and baroque theatre as incorporating "elements of outlandish charm and elements which depict [them] as the lowest of social outcasts," connected with "magic and charms," and "juggling and cozening." In opera, literature and music, throughout Europe, Roma women have been portrayed as provocative, sexually available, gaudy, exotic and mysterious. Hollywood and European movies, as well as popular music and other forms of pop culture, have promoted similar stereotypes.

Particularly notable representations of the Roma appear in classics like Carmen by Prosper Mérimée and adapted by Georges Bizet, Victor Hugo's  The Hunchback of Notre-Dame and Miguel de Cervantes'  La Gitanilla.
The Roma were also heavily romanticized in the Soviet Union, a classic example being the 1975 Tabor ukhodit v Nebo.
A more realistic depiction of contemporary Romani in the Balkans, featuring Roma lay actors speaking in their native dialects, although still playing with established clichés of a Roma penchant for both magic and crime, was presented by Emir Kusturica in his Time of the Gypsies (1988) and Black Cat, White Cat (1998). Another realistic depiction of the Roma in Yugoslavia is I Even Met Happy Gypsies (1967).

 Alan Cumming portrays Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler in the film X2 (2003). Kurt is depicted as a German, former circus performer, who was the victim of mind control by the film's villain. After being freed, he joins the X-Men. The role of Kurt Wagner was later recast with Kodi Smit-McPhee, who portrayed a younger Kurt in X-Men: Apocalypse (2016) and Dark Phoenix (2019). When first introduced in X-Men: Apocalypse, he is depicted as wearing Romanies-esque clothing (upon coming to America, he gets different clothes), and a victim of an underground arena (which forces captured mutants to fight each other to the death). Kurt is rescued by Mystique (unlike in the comics, not indicated to be his biological mother), and joins the X-Men.
 Daniel Cudmore portrays Colossus in the films X2 (2003), X-Men: The Last Stand (2006), and X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014). Colossus is a minor character in the films (even after becoming a member of the X-Men), and no backstory is provided for the character.

 In the 2011 film Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance, Danny Ketch is depicted as the son of a Roma woman named Nadya Ketch, and the demon Mephistopheles. Nadya had gotten involved with a man named Carrigan, who was a mercenary, drug dealer, and gun runner. She did not care what he was, all Nadya saw was a ticket out for herself (from what is never expanded upon). Nadya became mortally wounded, after one of Carrigan's deals went south (and she had attempted to escape). Nadya agreed to carry the child of Mephistopheles, in return for him saving her life. The film revolves around Johnny Blaze (Ghost Rider) attempting to protect Danny and Nadya from Mephistopheles. After Johnny's had his powers taken away from him, Danny uses his own powers to turn Johnny back into Ghost Rider. While Nadya and Danny are on the run from Carrigan (who is working for Mephistopheles), Nadya finds herself approached by a businessman (who removes a wedding ring). The businessman asks if she is Roma, and notes that he has heard things about Roma women (implied to be of a sexual nature). However, he backs away when Danny makes his presence known. Without the businessman noticing, Danny steals his wallet and wedding ring (so that businessman will have a lot of explaining to do with his wife). Afterwards, Nadya assures Danny that they will not always have to steal.
 Evan Peters portrays Peter Maximoff (an adaptation of Pietro Maximoff/Quicksilver) in the 20th Century Fox movies X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014), X-Men: Apocalypse (2016), and Dark Phoenix (2019).

 Elizabeth Olsen portrays Wanda Maximoff (Scarlet Witch) in the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise (with Aaron Taylor-Johnson portraying Pietro Maximoff in the films Captain America: The Winter Soldier (post-credit sequence) and Avengers: Age of Ultron). As of her Disney+ limited series, WandaVision, no reference has been made to Wanda (and her twin brother) being of Roma heritage. In the WandaVision episode "All-New Halloween Spooktacular!", Wanda dresses up as a "Sokovian fortune-teller" (an outfit based on the classic Scarlet Witch costume from the comic books) for Halloween. The plot of WandaVision has Wanda use magic on a town. She brainwashes all the residents (turning them into sitcom characters), and separating parents from their children (acts rooted in anti-Roma stereotypes). When the locals are freed, one of the women (in tears) begs Wanda to let her be reunited with her daughter. In Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (directed by Drag Me to Hell director Sam Raimi) Wanda (who serves as the film's main antagonist/villain) is shown attempting to steal the children of her alternate reality counterpart, and killing people to get what she wants. Avengers: Age of Ultron introduces and depicts Wanda and Pietro as having been willing members of Hydra. Hydra is a fictional organization, that Captain America: The First Avenger introduced as the former science division of the Nazi Party. Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver were adapted for the Marvel Cinematic Universe by Joss Whedon, the creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. (For information on the depiction of Roma on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and its spin-off, see under Television.) The casting of Elizabeth Olsen (a blond white woman) was met with backlash from fans, who felt that the character was being ruined by removing her Roma heritage. In a 2022 interview, Olsen stated that Scarlet Witch is not a role model, nor someone whom children should idolize.
 Stefan Kapičić voiced Colossus (the character appears through CGI) in Deadpool (2016) and Deadpool 2 (2018). While Kapičić's role is bigger than the Daniel Cudmore version, no backstory is provided for the character. In the films, Colossus tries to recruit Deadpool into the X-Men, and teaching him the morality of being a superhero.
 The television series Legion (2017-2019) depicts Gabrielle (the mother of series protagonist David Haller) as Roma (and, by extension, David Haller). In the comics, Gabrielle is Jewish. (For further information, see under Television.)
 Anya Taylor-Joy portrays Illyana Rasputin in the film The New Mutants (2020). Outside of being established as being a former victim of child trafficking, the film gives no backstory on Illyana. The trauma of her past as a trafficking victim is shown to have made Illyana distant and hostile towards others, though she gets close to the other young mutants at the institution (where they're all kept prisoners), even willing to save the others in the end. Throughout the film, Illyana is shown having a purple dragon hand puppet named Lockheed. During the climax, Lockheed transforms into a real dragon.

The narration states that the identity of Bombi Bitt's father is unknown (though, as his mother is said to sleep with Travellers, it is possible that the boy's father was one).

Due to Jana and her family having helped him, MacGyver helps them out of the country (and arranges for them to go to the United States). When MacGyver and Jana says goodbye, he gives her his Swiss Army knife (and she gives him her necklace). While at the prison, one of Jana's brothers is harassed by an antiziganistic guard, who compares Roma to mongrel dogs and says that it is a public service to kill the Roma.

However, he quickly changes his mind, upon hearing Edith's terrible singing voice (while Romana's mother had a great voice). He concludes that Edith's probably a distant cousin of Romana (noting that the tribe have left a lot of babies on doorsteps). The Roma tribe agrees to do the fair, but cancels after seeing a bad omen (a cat walking backward). Still needing the cover for the Resistance operation, the Resistance members dress up as Roma and hold the fair themselves.

Rowan refuses to get rid of the family, on the grounds that they haven't committed any crimes. A local vicar describes the situation with the Roma, as the problem not being so much what they do, as much as the prejudice that they bring out in people. During their stay in Aidensfield, the oldest son (Milos), becomes close to the vicar's daughter, Anna. Anna is engaged to a young local, who dislikes the Roma. Anna's fiancé tries to frame Milos for a series of crimes, but Rowan uncovers the plot, and Milos is proven innocent. At the end of the episode, the Roma family leaves Aidensfield.

When Police Sergeant Craddock meets Johnny, Craddock uses the term "Gypsies". Johnny corrects him: "We call ourselves Travellers. It's only very rude and ignorant people who calls us Gypsies". The presence of Johnny and the Irish Travellers spark prejudice from Craddock, and the Aidensfield Arms landlord Oscar Blaketon, while most other locals treat them with kindness. The plot of the episode has Johnny encounter a young, and comically inept would-be robber named Nathaniel Cooper (who screwed up his first attempt at a robbery, and shot himself in the foot, then shot one of the tires of his getaway car). Realizing that Nathaniel is no real criminal, Johnny decides to hide Nathaniel from the police. However, when Nathaniel steals money from the Aidensfield Arms (an act that Blaketon is quick to blame the Travellers for), Johnny changes his mind about Nathaniel. He tells Nathaniel that he had no right to steal that money (which Johnny gives back to Blaketon), and asks Nathaniel to turn himself in, but Nathaniel refuses and leaves.

The old woman reads Indy's future in tarot cards, but is harassed by police and arrested (for not having a license for her business), before she can finish her reading. Indy then travels to Transylvania with the American Colonel Waters, to investigate the Romanian General Mattias Targo (an adaptation of Count Dracula), where they meet Maria (and two other Allied agents). Maria is depicted as a skilled pick pocket, and an expert with knives (a skill she first uses the reassure the sexist Colonel Waters that she can take care of herself, then kill the double agent (when he reveals himself and shoots the man whom Maria loves), and finally to save the life of Indiana Jones). When they get to Targo's castle, Maria is for a few seconds possessed by a being, and calls attention to the old fortune teller's final tarot card (that Indy's been carrying with him, in his pocket). It is left unclear if Maria is supposed to be psychic, or if her possession is just another example of the castle being haunted (other examples include ball lightning, spontaneous human combustion, a bleeding ceiling, a frozen bedroom, along with Targo (a vampire) and an entire camp of the undead). Maria never becomes involved with Indiana Jones (like some sort of Bond girl), and is engaged to a French spy named François Picard (one of three agents previously sent to investigate General Targo, and disappeared). Maria and Indy are the only ones to make it out of the castle alive. They destroy Targo by driving a stake through his heart, and then head back to their superiors in Venice.

Angel was doomed to misery until he could enjoy a moment of pure happiness. It is later revealed that these Roma were members of the Kalderash tribe and that the character Jenny Calendar, actually Janna of the Kalderash, is a member of the tribe, who was sent to ensure the continued suffering of Angel.

After Jenny's deception, and true identity, is exposed, the Scoobies turn against her. Jenny is soon after brutally murdered by Angelus. In an analysis of the treatment of the Roma in literature and media, Nikolina Dobreva asserts that the show deserves to be criticized for associating the Roma with curses and primitivism, for stereotyping the Roma as "irrevocably foreign" in clothing and speech, and for perpetuating the persistent air of mystery surrounding them. Dobreva, however, praises the character of Jenny Calendar, writing in 2009: "Jenny's character, despite the reversion to a few stereotypes, is arguably one of the most multi-faceted and positive representations of a female Gypsy in the past 20 years. In sharp contrast to all other Gypsy portrayals, she is technologically savvy, and, instead of resorting to incantations or obscure rituals, is able to create a computer algorithm that would make possible the restoration of Angel's soul."

 No Mundo da Luna (2022–present) is a television series centered around a young Roma woman named Luna Lovari (played by Marina Moschen), who is an aspiring journalist. Luna attempts to get a reporter job at a newspaper. However, the editor (who has found out that Luna is Roma) only offers Luna a position writing horoscopes for the magazine (as she assumes that all Roma women are fortune tellers, and is surprised to see that Luna is not wearing a stereotypical skirt). A reluctant Luna takes the job, despite not knowing the first thing about tarot cards. She goes to her grandmother, who does. The grandmother becomes upset and says that the non-Rom think that all Roma are the same. She also tells Luna that she won't let her use their culture without knowing anything about it, while it would take her years of study to use the cards. Without her grandmother's permission, Luna takes some tarot cards that have been in the family's possession for centuries. Fleeing from her grandmother's house, Luna is followed to her car by her brother and grandmother. The grandmother says something in the Romani language (Luna, who never learned it, doesn't understand), which prompts Luna to declare that her grandmother is putting a curse on her (likely sarcastically, as Luna's shown to not believe in psychic powers) and drives off. Luna's brother remarks that Luna missed the class about "Gypsy curses" not existing. When Luna later starts using the cards, the artwork becomes animated and the figures seemingly speak to her, as if through magic. In one episode, an entertainment company sees a video from the wedding of Luna's cousin, whose wedding dress caught fire. This inspires them to plan a movie called "The Curse of the Gypsy Bride" (intended to use all clichés about the Roma), much to the annoyance of Luna. A reluctant Luna takes part in a press event for the movie, together with the two (non-Roma) actors cast to play the leads. The lead actress expresses a fear of the Roma, and asks if they still live in tents (and travels around Europe). Eventually, Luna has had enough and tells everyone off for reducing the rich Roma culture to stereotypes. The planned film is shot down, after a video of the event leaks online, and results in the entertainment company being bombarded with allegations of racism and cultural appropriation (with the internet not being too happy about them not even casting real Roma actors for the two leads).
