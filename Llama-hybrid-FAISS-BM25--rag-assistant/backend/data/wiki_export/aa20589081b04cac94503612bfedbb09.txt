Alabama's 3rd congressional district is a United States congressional district in Alabama that elects a representative to the United States House of Representatives. It is based in east-central Alabama and encompasses Calhoun, Chambers, Cherokee, Clay, Cleburne, Lee, Macon, Randolph, Russell, St. Clair, Talladega, and Tallapoosa counties, and parts of Chilton County. Cities in the district include Phenix City, Talladega, Tuskegee, and Auburn. Prior to the most recent redistricting cycle, the 3rd district had included parts of the state capital city of Montgomery in Montgomery County.

At the federal level, the district is strongly Republican-leaning, though not quite as strongly as some of the other districts in the state. John McCain carried the district in 2008 with 56.21% of the vote while Barack Obama won 43.04% of the vote.

The district is currently represented by Republican Mike Rogers and was once represented by Bob Riley, the former Governor of Alabama.
