Old Wesley Rugby Football Club was founded in 1891 from the past pupils of Wesley College, Dublin. Since then it has become one of Leinster's most famous clubs. It plays in Division 1B of the All-Ireland League. The club won the Leinster Senior Cup in 1909 and 1985 as well as winning the AIL Division 2 title in 1989 and the AIL Division 2A title in 2015. They celebrated their Centenary year in 1991 with a match against a star-studded Barbarians team featuring Internationals such as Eric Rush, Pierre Berbizier and Tony Underwood. They won the eleven-try match in dramatic fashion with a last minute drop-goal to win 37-36.

Through the early 1990s they were one of the most successful teams in Leinster, reaching three cup finals and consistently playing in the 1st Division of the AIL League. Old Wesley RFC were relegated from Division 1 in 1997 and the early years of professionalism marked a tough period for the club.

Old Wesley RFC were crowned AIL Division 3 Champions 2008/2009 following a 30 - 12 victory over Corinthians, gaining promotion to AIL Division 2.

Old Wesley RFC won AIL Division 2A in the 2014/2015 season, gaining promotion to Division 1B.
