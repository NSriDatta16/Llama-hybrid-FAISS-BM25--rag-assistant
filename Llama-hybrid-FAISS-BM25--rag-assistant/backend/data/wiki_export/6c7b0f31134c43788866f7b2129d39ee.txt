More than 1,500 African American officeholders served during the Reconstruction era (1865–1877) and in the years after Reconstruction before white supremacy, disenfranchisement, and the Democratic Party fully reasserted control in Southern states. Historian Canter Brown Jr. noted that in some states, such as Florida, the highest number of African Americans were elected or appointed to offices after the end of Reconstruction in 1877. The following is a partial list of notable African American officeholders from the end of the Civil War until before 1900. Dates listed are the year that a term states or the range of years served if multiple terms.

Arkansas
Between 1868 and 1893, 85 men noted as "colored" or "mulatto" were elected to the Arkansas legislature.

As a result, after 1893, the next African American to serve as an Arkansas state legislator was in 1973.
