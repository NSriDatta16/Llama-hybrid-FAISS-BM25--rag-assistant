RPM ( and later ) was a Canadian music-industry publication that featured song and album charts for Canada. The publication was founded by Walt Grealis in February 1964, supported through its existence by record label owner Stan Klees. RPM ceased publication in November 2000.

RPM stood for "Records, Promotion, Music". The magazine's title varied over the years, including RPM Weekly and RPM Magazine.

Background
In 1964, Harriett Wasser came on board as the magazine's New York correspondent. She was no stranger to the music industry and she had been associated with many prominent figures in the industry that included Bobby Darin and Bob Crewe. The address at the time for correspondence was Harriet Wasser, 161 West 54th Street, Suite 1202, New York, N.Y. 10019. An example of her work can be seen in page 5 of the October 9, 1964 edition of R. P. M., in DATELINE NEW YORK by Harriet Wasser.

Canadian music charts
RPM maintained several format charts, including Top Singles (all genres), Adult Contemporary, Dance, Urban, Rock/Alternative and Country Tracks (or Top Country Tracks) for country music. On 21 March 1966, RPM expanded its Top Singles chart from 40 positions to 100. On 6 December 1980, the main chart became a top-50 chart and remained this way until 4 August 1984, whereupon it reverted to a top-100 singles chart.

For the first several weeks of its existence, the magazine did not compile a national chart, but simply printed the current airplay lists of several major-market top-40 stations. A national chart was introduced in the 22 June 1964 issue, and the first national number-one single was "Chapel of Love" by the Dixie Cups. Prior to the introduction of RPM's national chart, the CHUM Chart issued by Toronto radio station CHUM was considered the de facto national chart. The final number-one single in the magazine's chart was "Music" by Madonna.

RPM'''s Top Singles chart was initially based on airplay and record company reports. Beginning in June 1964, the chart began factoring in record store sales reports. In September 1988, RPM began basing their Top Singles chart soley on airplay.

The RPM Awards
The modern Juno Awards had their origins in an annual survey conducted by RPM since its founding year. Readers of the magazine were invited to mail in survey ballots to indicate their choices under various categories of people or companies.

The RPM Awards poll was transformed into a formal awards ceremony, the Gold Leaf Awards, in 1970. These became the Juno Awards in following years.
