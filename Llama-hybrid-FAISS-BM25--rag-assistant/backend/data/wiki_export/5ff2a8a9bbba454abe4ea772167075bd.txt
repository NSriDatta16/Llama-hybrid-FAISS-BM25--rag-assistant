Academics
ConVal High School has over six different academic departments, including the ATC or CATE (Career and Technical Education) programs.

TASC
ConVal has developed the TASC intervention block. The Teachers in Academic Service Centers (TASC) block is a program where students 'Book' teachers that they need help or support from. The ConVal TASC model has been implemented by over 40 schools across the nation.

ConVal's TASC program was developed as a way to fit RTI, i.e. opportunities for relearning, extensions and enrichment as well as mentoring and advising, effectively into the school day.
