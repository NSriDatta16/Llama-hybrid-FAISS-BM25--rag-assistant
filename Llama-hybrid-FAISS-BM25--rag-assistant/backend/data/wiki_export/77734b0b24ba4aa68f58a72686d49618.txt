In popular culture
The first verse of "Kate Kelly", a song about Kate Kelly, younger sister of Ned Kelly, may have inspired Australian author David Hunt in his 2016 book "True Girt: The Unauthorised History of Australia, Volume 2" in which he also describes Joe Byrne as having been "strung up" like a "marionette".
