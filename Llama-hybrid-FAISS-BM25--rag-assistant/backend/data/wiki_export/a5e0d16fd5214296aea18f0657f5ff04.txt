Adami was the son of a surgeon, Christian Gottlieb Adami, and his wife Regina Dorothea. At his father's behest, he began studying medicine in 1835, in Berlin, but soon switched to philosophy and history. On 28 September 1841, Adami married the actress Auguste Pohl in Berlin.

In 1836, he starting working as a freelance employee for the Berliner Figaro for the publisher Ernst Litfaß. In 1839, he founded Sonnenblumen (the "Sunflower"), which was an annual almanac of historical and modern novels. He stopped publishing it after ten years due to the revolutions of 1848 in the German states. He then became a critic and columnist for the Neuen Preußischen Zeitung newspaper in 1849.

Adami was considered a conservative and he was, in his time, a successful writer. For many of his publications, he used the pen name Paul Fronberg.
