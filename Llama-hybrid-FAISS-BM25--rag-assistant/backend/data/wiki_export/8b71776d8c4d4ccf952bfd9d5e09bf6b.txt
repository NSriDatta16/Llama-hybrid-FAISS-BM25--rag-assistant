The Holden EH is an automobile produced by General Motors-Holden in Australia from 1963 to 1965. The EH was released in August 1963 replacing the Holden EJ series, and was the first Holden to incorporate the new "Red" engine, with a seven main bearing crankshaft instead of the four main bearing crankshaft used in the "Grey" engine. At first, a larger capacity  engine was only sold attached to a three-speed manual gearbox or the "Hydramatic" four-stage automatic transmission with a column shift. The Controlled Coupling Hydramatic used in the EH was actually a four-stage, although it effectively worked as a three-speed unit, except at full throttle.EH Holden Owners Manual, General Motors - Holden, 1964 (Provided with car at purchase) The  engine was initially sold only with the "Hydramatic" transmission. The first EH with a 179-cubic-inch engine and a manual gear box was called the "EH-S4", and was fitted with an upgraded manual gearbox, having stronger gears than in the 149 gear box, and an upgraded clutch. The three-speed manual column shift gearboxes had no synchromesh on first gear, only on the second and third (top) gear.

A total of 256,959 EH Holdens were produced and sold from 1963 to 1965, when the EH was replaced by the Holden HD series.
