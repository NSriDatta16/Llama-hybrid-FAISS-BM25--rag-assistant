Forego (April 30, 1970 – August 27, 1997) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse that won eight Eclipse Awards including Horse of the Year, Champion Handicap Horse and Champion Sprinter.

Background
Foaled at Claiborne Farm in Paris, Kentucky, he was owned and bred by Mrs. Martha Farish Gerry's Lazy F Ranch. Over the years, Forego had four trainers; Sherrill W. Ward, Eddie Hayward, and eventually Frank Y. Whiteley Jr. and his son David A. Whiteley. He had two main jockeys: Hall of Fame rider Bill Shoemaker and Heliodoro Gustines.

Racing career
In 1973, Forego was fourth behind Secretariat in a Kentucky Derby that was run in record time (1:59 2/5). Eddie Hayward, assistant trainer to Sherrill Ward, took over when Ward was ill and is officially listed as Forego's trainer in his wins in his final two races of 1973: the Roamer and Discovery Handicaps. During the 1973 season, Forego had 18 starts for 9 wins, 3 seconds and 3 thirds for $188,909 in earnings.

Forego started 1974 in Florida with wins in the Donn Handicap, Gulfstream Park Handicap and Widener Handicap. Moving back to his home base in New York, he next won the Carter Handicap and Brooklyn Handicap, while placing in the Metropolitan Handicap and Suburban Handicap.  He started the fall campaign with a loss in the Marlboro Cup, then went on to win the Woodward Stakes, Vosburgh Handicap and Jockey Club Gold Cup. In the Vosburgh, he carried 131 pounds to victory, the first of 13 races in which he carried 130 pounds or more. He won three Eclipse Awards that year: Champion Sprinter, Champion Older Horse and 1974 Horse of the Year.

At the age of five years, he placed in all but one start. He won the Seminole and Widener Handicaps in Florida, took the Carter Handicap carrying , set a track record with  in the Brooklyn Handicap, and won the 1½ mile Suburban Handicap carrying .

As a six-year-old, Forego won the 1976 Marlboro Cup (carrying 137 pounds) at Belmont Park. After contending for the lead, he faded to eighth of 11 horses on the backstretch, with Honest Pleasure holding the lead most of the way. Entering the stretch, Forego appeared to be too far behind, but he made up ground in the closing strides and just edged out Honest Pleasure. He also won the Brooklyn Handicap, Metropolitan Handicap and Woodward Stakes to become the leader in stakes earnings for a second time.

As a seven-year-old, Forego won the Metropolitan Handicap again and his fourth consecutive Woodward Stakes. He also was named Champion Handicapper for the fourth time.

He raced twice as an eight-year-old before chronic fetlock problems finished his racing career.
