The Santa Barbara Daily Sound was a daily newspaper in Santa Barbara, California that was published Tuesday through Saturday. After discontinuing publication of its print edition in late June 2012, publisher Jeramy Gordon was quoted by the Santa Barbara Independent as saying the paper would continue as a "web only" news outlet and that the company was "currently in a state of re-organization". On July 23, 2012 the website of the Daily Sound went offline and apparently it has ceased to operate.

As a free five-day-a-week publication the Daily Sound was distributed through newspaper racks and in stores, coffee shops, restaurants, schools and major workplaces. The founder and publisher was Jeramy Gordon, former managing editor of the Palo Alto Daily News. Gordon was 23 when he founded the paper.

The Daily Sound published its first color edition on September 11, 2006, launched its Saturday edition September 8, 2007, and began home delivery on April 29, 2008

The "Daily Sound" ceased publication of a Monday edition in January 2009. The paper cited the economy as that main reason.

Legal issues

Less than four months after publishing its first edition, the Santa Barbara Daily Sound received a letter from David Millstein, a San Francisco-based lawyer for the Santa Barbara News-Press, claiming that the Daily Sound's banner looked too much like the News-Press' and that it had to be changed. Gordon said that not only did the News-Press attorney demand a change in the look of the Daily Sound banner, but asked that it consider a name change, perhaps to the Los Angeles Daily Sound.

In late June and early July 2007, Santa Barbara County Public Defender Karen Atkins issues three subpoenas to Daily Sound employees, including Editor and Publisher Jeramy Gordon, demanding they turn over all photographs in the paper's possession depicting a March 14, 2007 gang melee that left a 15-year-old dead and 14-year-old charged with his murder. The Daily Sound refused to hand over the photos citing the First Amendment and California's Shield Law, but eventually gave in amid growing legal costs and possible fines that would likely shut down the paper.
