The 1998 Women's Rugby World Cup was the first world cup fully sanctioned by the International Rugby Board (IRB) and the third Women's Rugby World Cup in history. The tournament took place in Amsterdam, in the Netherlands and was the first women's world cup held outside of the United Kingdom.

The tournament saw a record 16 teams compete and heightened media attention. There was no qualification process, teams taking part by invitation from the IRB. New Zealand defeated the United States 44â€“12 in the final.

Several matches in the tournament were filmed for television and a one-hour TV highlights programme was produced by IMG. These recordings are held as part of the IRB's World Cup Archive.
