Makalaka is a general designation used by the Bechuana, Matabele and kindred peoples, for other conquered or enslaved peoples. Thus, many of the subjugated peoples by the Kololo chief, Sebetwane (or Sebituane, Setitwane) â€” in about 1830, were called makalaka.

The name is more frequently used to designate the Makalanga, one of the peoples mistakenly classed as Shonas, who were brought into subjection by the Matabele people.
