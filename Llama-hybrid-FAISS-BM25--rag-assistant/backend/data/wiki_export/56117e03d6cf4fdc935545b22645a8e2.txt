Spacifix is a New Zealand funk/soul/R&B and reggae boy group from West Auckland, New Zealand. They formed in April 2003 with the view of entering the Smokefree Pacifica Beats national competition. Aged between 13 and 18 years they won the competition first time up. Until April 2005, the band played a number of festivals and concerts and increased their fan base in West Auckland.

In March 2006 Spacifix signed a management agreement with Ocean Entertainment Ltd, a management team dedicated to taking New Zealand music on to the world stage.
World Fresh (Director Ondrej Havas) commissioned Spacifix to write and record the 2006 40-hour Famine soundtrack – Spread da Word. A television series commissioned with TVNZ was produced – Henderson To Hollywood – following the band's preparation for a major opportunity in Los Angeles, U.S.

Spacifix have recorded Sunshine Day and it has been released to radio and television.

Sunshine Day was selected by NZ On Air to be distributed to all radio programmers on their February Hit Disc release.

On 8 March 2006 Spacifix supported UB40 in their Tongan concert and performed to a crowd of over 10,000 people. Telecom chose Spacifix to launch the Telecom Music Store to promote the new cellphone download phenomenon. Spacifix appeared as virtual holograms in Telecom's downtown store in Queen Street throughout May, June and July in the hours of darkness.

They have released two more singles; "Gotta get Like This", and more recently, "Make things Right" released on Tuesday 20 February 2007.

In August 2007 Spacifix released 'Old Skool Remix (feat. AMG). The song received heavy radio support.
