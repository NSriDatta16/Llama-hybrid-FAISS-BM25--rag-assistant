History

Just over four years later, on March 21, 2015, the reconstructed Onagawa Station reopened marking the restoration of the entire Ishinomaki Line. The new station building features an integrated community center and public bathing facility on the upper floors. The building was designed by Pritzker Architecture Prize winning architect Shigeru Ban, who also contributed to the design of temporary housing structures in the town in the wake of the March 2011 tsunami.
