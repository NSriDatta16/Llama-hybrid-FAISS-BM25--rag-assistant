Epilepsy Currents is a bimonthly peer-reviewed open-access medical journal that was established in 2001 by the American Epilepsy Society. It publishes commentary articles, written by a board of contributing editors, and brief topical reviews. While commentary articles are solicited from members of the board of contributing editors, the editors entertain suggestions regarding topics for review articles. Content is available on the society's web site and on PubMed Central. The journal began to be self-published by the society in collaboration with Allen Press in 2011; prior to that time the journal was published on behalf of the society by Wiley-Blackwell.
