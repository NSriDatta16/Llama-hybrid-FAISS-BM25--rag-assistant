Early years
Čobej's first club was Tesla Stropkov but in 1997 he moved to BSC Bardejov. In the summer of 2000 Čobejs joined Artmedia. Initially he struggled and was not a regular first team fixture. As a result, shortly after joining Artmedia he loaned out to Slovan Bratislava where he made five first team appearances.

An Artmedia regular and diagnosis of a brain tumour
In the seasons following Čobej soon became the first choice keeper at Artmedia, however during the 2005–06 season he was forced out of the game for several months after doctors discovered that he had developed a brain tumour. The tumour was successfully treated and he returned to the first team to feature as one of the most important players during the club's famous run which saw them reach the lucrative group stages of the UEFA Champions League in 2005–06.

In 2007 after a number of successful seasons with Artmedia Čobejs lost his place in the starting line up. At the start of the 2008-09 he was fighting to return to the Artmedia first team.

International selection
On 20 May 2006 Čobej played his first and only game for the Slovak national team, featuring for just two minutes.

Away from football
Čobej is married, has two daughters and lives on the outskirts of Bratislava.
