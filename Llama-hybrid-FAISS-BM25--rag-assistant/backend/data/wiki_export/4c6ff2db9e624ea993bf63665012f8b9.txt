The Royal Canadian Logistics Service (RCLS, ) is a personnel branch of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF).

In April 1997, the CF Armed Forces Council decided to incorporate the Personnel Administration Branch into the Logistics Branch.

From 1968 to 2018 the organization was named the Logistics Branch. On October 16, 2018, on the occasion on its 50th anniversary, the Logistics Branch received its "Royal" designation from Queen Elizabeth II becoming the Royal Canadian Logistics Service.

Unification
When the Canadian Army, Royal Canadian Navy, and Royal Canadian Air Force were merged in 1968 to form the Canadian Armed Forces, the administrative corps of the Canadian Army were deactivated and merged with their naval and air force counterparts to ultimately form the Canadian Forces Logistics Branch. 
 The Royal Canadian Army Service Corps transport and supply elements were combined with the Royal Canadian Ordnance Corps to form the Logistics Branch
 The Royal Canadian Postal Corps and  Royal Canadian Army Service Corps  clerical trades  were merged to form the Administration Branch (later merged with the Logistics Branch)

Uniform
The officers that belong to the corps wear a metallic embroidered or composite cap badge, while the non-commissioned members (NCM) wear a cloth-like version on berets and Air Force wedge caps; however, Navy NCMs wear a solid-metal version on their service caps and bowlers.
