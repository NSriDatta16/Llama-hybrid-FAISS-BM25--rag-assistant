College career
Dockery accepted a football scholarship from the University of Texas at Austin. He played for coach Mack Brown's Texas Longhorns football team from 1999 to 2002.  As a true freshman in 1999, he served as a backup offensive guard, but saw action in all 14 games, including the Cotton Bowl Classic, at both guard spots and on special teams.

As a sophomore in 2000, he started in all 12 games at guard, including the Holiday Bowl. He helped pave the way for a Longhorns offense that averaged 38.6 points per game.

He shared the Longhorns' Outstanding Offensive Lineman Award and was a key member of a Longhorn offense that ranked fifth in the Big 12 and 16th nationally in scoring offense (33.8 points per game).

During his career, the team had a 40-12 record, including back-to-back 11-2 seasons and a top six ranking in 2001 and 2002. He played 52 consecutive games with 31 starts (25 at guard and 6 at tackle).

Professional career

Pre-Draft

First stint with Redskins
Dockery was selected in the third round (81st overall) of the 2003 NFL Draft by the Washington Redskins. In 2003, he began his rookie season as a backup at several positions along the offensive line, including left guard and right tackle.

He would go on to start the final 13 games of the regular season at left guard. In 2004, he started all 16 games at left guard for the Redskins, teaming with left tackle Chris Samuels to form a solid tandem on the left side of the offensive line. He finished the season having garnered 29 consecutive starts at left guard, although he was one of the league leaders in false starts.

Buffalo Bills

He was a two-year starter at left guard (32 games) and was part of one of the NFL's biggest offensive lines in terms of height and weight.

He injured his left knee against the Tennessee Titans. He was released on March 1, 2011.

Dallas Cowboys
