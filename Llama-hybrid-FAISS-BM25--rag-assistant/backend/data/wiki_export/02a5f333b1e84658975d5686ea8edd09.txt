Setiawangsa is an eastern suburb in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, located less than 4 kilometres from the city centre and located right next to Ampang. There are 4 main residentials within this area; 

 Taman Setiawangsa
 Tiara Setiawangsa
 Bukit Setiawangsa
 Puncak Setiawangsa

While Taman Setiawangsa and Tiara Setiawangsa are located on the busier, flatter and more visible front part of the suburb, Puncak Setiawangsa and Bukit Setiawangsa are neighborhoods positioned higher up on the hills in a quieter surrounding.  

The residential was developed by Island & Peninsular (I&P) Group Sdn Bhd. The foothill and mid-hill areas were originally part of Bukit Dinding,  developed in stages in the 1980s and renamed as Bukit Setiawangsa. Final phase of the development was Puncak Setiawangsa, which was completed in 1995. 

The lists of tenants here is changing daily, due possibly to the easier traffic flow (helped by the new Duta–Ulu Klang Expressway (DUKE)), competitive rentals and accessibility between KL, Petaling Jaya and other suburbs. Firms such as Texas Instruments, I & P, Right Balance Group, Fidin Universal, Tanjung and RB Helicopters all have their operational bases in Setiawangsa. Japanese retailer JUSCO also has one outlet operating here in AU2 since 2008.

Setiawangsa's parliamentary constituency is currently led by Nik Nazmi of PKR.
