was a  of the Imperial Japanese Navy.

Design and description
The Yūgumo class was a repeat of the preceding  with minor improvements that increased their anti-aircraft capabilities. Their crew numbered 228 officers and enlisted men. The ships measured  overall, with a beam of  and a draft of . They displaced  at standard load and  at deep load. The ships had two Kampon geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by three Kampon water-tube boilers. The turbines were rated at a total of  for a designed speed of .

The main armament of the Yūgumo class consisted of six Type 3  guns in three twin-gun turrets, one superfiring pair aft and one turret forward of the superstructure. The guns were able to elevate up to 75° to increase their ability against aircraft, but their slow rate of fire, slow traversing speed, and the lack of any sort of high-angle fire-control system meant that they were virtually useless as anti-aircraft guns. They were built with four Type 96  anti-aircraft guns in two twin-gun mounts, but more of these guns were added over the course of the war. The ships were also armed with eight  torpedo tubes in a two quadruple traversing mounts; one reload was carried for each tube. Their anti-submarine weapons comprised two depth charge throwers for which 36 depth charges were carried.

Construction and career
During the Battle of the Philippine Sea Hayashimo was assigned to Force B. In the Battle of Leyte Gulf, Hayashimo escorted the 1st Diversion Attack Force commanded by Admiral Kurita Takeo. She was damaged on 25 October 1944 during air attacks in the Battle off Samar. Falling behind the withdrawing fleet, she was escorted toward Coron by the destroyer  until 26 October, when the latter was ordered to rejoin the fleet. Hayashimo lost her bow to a torpedo in renewed air attacks on 26 October. She was grounded and sank in shallow water off Semirara Island,  southeast of Mindoro (). Salvage attempts and sporadic air attacks continued through 12 November, when the last of the crew finally abandoned ship.
