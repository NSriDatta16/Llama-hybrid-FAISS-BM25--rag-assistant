The Northern Utah Academy for Math Engineering and Science (NUAMES) is a public charter high school for students in grades 10-12.  The school started to provide an educational experience that prepares high school students for an early transition into a university baccalaureate program in fields related to math, science and engineering. Students who have attended NUAMES for a full year and meet Weber State's admission requirements receive a scholarship to attend the university while they are also completing their high school diploma. Many students earn their associate degrees by the time they graduate.
The NUAMES campus is on the Weber State University Davis campus in Layton, Utah.  The principal is Kelli Booth, the vice principal is Steve Davis and Nate Taggart is the director of business operations.
