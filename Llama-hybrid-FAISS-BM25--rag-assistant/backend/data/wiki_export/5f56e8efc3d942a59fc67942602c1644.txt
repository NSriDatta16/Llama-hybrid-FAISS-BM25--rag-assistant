Rogers is an English patronymic surname deriving from the given name of Roger commonly used by the Normans and meaning "son of Roger".  Variants include Rodgers.

Most genealogists believe that the name Roger is derived from the pre-7th century Old English name Hrothgar, which means 'fame spear' ("hroð" fame or renown, "gari" spear), the first reference to which is in Beowulf, the Anglo-Saxon epic poem.

The surname was probably first introduced into England during the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain. The "Rogers" given name was probably first introduced to England after the Norman Conquest of 1066, and is first recorded as "Rogerus" in the Domesday Book of 1086. It was introduced to Ireland when the Anglo-Normans invaded in the 1170s. According to a 2020 study, those with the surname are more likely to have Viking ancestors.

The first recorded mention of the surname is in mid-13th-century England. Examples include William Rogger in the subsidy tax rolls of the county of Sussex in 1296, and Henry Rogeres in similar records for Worcestershire of 1327. The first recorded spelling of the surname is that of Richard Roger from 1263, in the "Archaeological Records" of the county of Kent during the reign of Henry III (1216–1272).

The surname is now found commonly throughout Britain, particularly in southern and western England, and also in Scotland and Wales. The surname was also taken from England to Ireland in Norman and later Cromwellian invasions. However, many occurrences of it in Ireland represent an Anglicisation of Mac Ruaidhrí and Mac Ruairí in the newer and current standard spelling.

In England and Wales it ranks as the 77th most common surname.

The surname is also popular in North America, where it was introduced during English colonisation. According to the 1990 United States Census, 'Rogers' ranked fifty-fourth in frequency among all reported surnames, accounting for 0.12% of the population. By the 2010 United States Census, 'Rogers' ranked sixty-ninth among all reported surnames.
