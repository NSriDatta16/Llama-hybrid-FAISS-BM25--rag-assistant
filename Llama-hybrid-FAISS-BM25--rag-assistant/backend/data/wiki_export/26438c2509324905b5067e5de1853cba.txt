Abilene Independent School District is a public school district based in Abilene, Texas (USA).

The district serves the cities of Abilene and Impact in northeastern Taylor County as well as the portion of Abilene that lies in southeastern Jones County. As of the 2009-10 school year, AISD enrolled 17,016 students in 2 High Schools, 2 Magnet High Schools, 4 Middle Schools, 15 Elementary Schools and numerous special and alternative campuses. The district's enrollment peaked, for the time being, in the late 1990s and early part of the new century as development in south Abilene began to sprawl ever outward, spilling into neighboring Wylie ISD and Jim Ned CISD. As the city continues to age, school enrollment seems to have stabilized, for now, around 17,000.

Finances
As of the 2010-2011 school year, the appraised valuation of property in the district was $3,810,069,000. The maintenance tax rate was $0.104 and the bond tax rate was $0.012 per $100 of appraised valuation.

Academic achievement
In 2011, the school district was rated "academically acceptable" by the Texas Education Agency.  Forty-nine percent of districts in Texas in 2011 received the same rating. No state accountability ratings will be given to districts in 2012. A school district in Texas can receive one of four possible rankings from the Texas Education Agency: Exemplary (the highest possible ranking), Recognized, Academically Acceptable, and Academically Unacceptable (the lowest possible ranking).
