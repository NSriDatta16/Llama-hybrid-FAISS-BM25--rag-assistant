The Civil Union Act 2004 is an Act of Parliament in New Zealand. It was passed into law on Thursday 9 December 2004 by a final vote of 65â€“55 in the New Zealand Parliament. The Act makes it legal for those in same-sex as well as heterosexual relationships to enter into a civil-union.

The Act is still in force, despite New Zealand providing same-sex marriages since 19 August 2013, under the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Act 2013.

Attitudes of political parties 
The act was opposed by religious groups, including the Catholic Church. Then New Zealand National Party leader Don Brash opposed the bill, but only as he believed it should be put to a referendum. The Act was widely supported by the then-governing New Zealand Labour Party.
