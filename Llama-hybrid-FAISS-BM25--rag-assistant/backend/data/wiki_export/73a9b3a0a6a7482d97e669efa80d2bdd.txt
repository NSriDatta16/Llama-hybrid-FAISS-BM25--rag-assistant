Dickinson Independent School District is a school district based in Dickinson, Texas, United States in Greater Houston.

DISD serves most of the city of Dickinson as well as portions of the cities of La Marque, League City, and Texas City and some houses in unincorporated Galveston County (including most of Bacliff and all of San Leon).

All of the DISD catchment area is also served by the College of the Mainland.

In 2009, the school district was rated "academically acceptable" by the Texas Education Agency.

History

In the 2000s, rising real estate costs in Galveston, alongside the devastation brought by Hurricane Ike, forced many families to move to other areas, including League City and Texas City. This meant an influx of children out of Galveston ISD and into other school districts like Dickinson ISD.

Standardized dress
All DISD students are required to wear "standardized dress", which is similar to school uniforms. 
In 2014 DISD did away with the standardized dress code.
