Hardy is a French, English and Scottish surname.

It appears that the oldest usage is from the Old French hardi  meaning "bold, courageous" which itself comes from Old Frankish hardjan meaning "to make hard". The final -y is also typical of the French proper names (first names, surnames and place names, with the notable exception Henri, when it is a given name). 

Some of the oldest Hardy families in England seem to originate from a Norman Knight de Hardy in the mid 11th century. English Hardy families can mainly be found around Dorset and Yorkshire. 

In Scotland Hardi is considered to have Norman, Viking or Celtic origins and is mainly a Lowland surname. Scottish Hardys are mainly affiliated with Clan Mackintosh as a sept and the larger Clan Chattan.
