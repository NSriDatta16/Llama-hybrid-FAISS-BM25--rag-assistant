Thunderbolt Peak is a peak in the Palisades group of peaks in the Sierra Nevada in the U.S. state of California.  It rises to  and could be considered the thirteenth-highest peak in the state, but since the peak has less than  of prominence it is usually considered a subsidiary peak of North Palisade. But if it is considered a separate mountain peak, Thunderbolt Peak is the northernmost fourteener in the Sierra Nevada.

The first ascent was attempted by a party of very well-known climbers. During the climb, a lightning bolt struck very close to Jules Eichorn, breaking his concentration. The mountain was named in commemoration of this event.
