Career 
Raja Mohan began his academic career at the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, New Delhi.

Mohan has had a number of stints in journalism as well. He was Strategic Affairs Editor of the Indian Express, New Delhi, and before that, served as Diplomatic Editor and the Washington Correspondent of The Hindu newspaper.  He is a columnist for the Indian Express.

His foreign policy perspective is broadly liberal and pragmatist, arguing for closer ties between India and key global powers such as the United States, Russia, and China (PRC). He has also argued for using greater economic linkages to improve India's troubled ties with Pakistan.  As he stated in an opinion piece in April 2012, "For far too long, Delhi has viewed its regional policy through the prism of security without reference to the economic interests of the people. Delhi should instead focus on modernising the national security management and bring it in line with the demands of a globalising economy. Denying visas, limiting trade and blocking foreign investment from neighbours — the traditional and blunt instruments of Delhi’s national security strategy — are hopelessly out of date."

He has a master's degree in nuclear physics and a Ph.D. in international relations.  Mohan was a member of India's National Security Advisory Board during 1998-2000 and 2004-06. His books include Crossing the Rubicon: The Shaping of India's Foreign Policy (New York: Palgrave, 2004) and Impossible Allies: Nuclear India, United States and the Global Order (New Delhi: India Research press, 2006). His most recent work is Samudra Manthan: Sino-Indian Rivalry in the Indo-Pacific (Washington;Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 2012). He was awarded the highest French distinction of Chevalier de la Légion d’Honneur (Knight of the Legion of Honour) in 2016.
