Mogneville () is a commune in the Oise department in northern France.

History
Though inhabited from the Stone Age, the existence of the village first dates from the Romans. One of the merchants who followed Caesar and his camp to Catenoy, placed himself on the site of the modern village. The name of the village derives from the Latin Monnachivilla, "settlement of the monks", which is Moineville in French. Monks inhabited this territory in the 10th and 11th centuries. The Abbey of Chaalis, the Abbey of Lannoy and the Priory of Wariville  possessed benefices here.
