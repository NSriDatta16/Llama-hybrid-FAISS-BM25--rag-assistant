Plot
Koi Tujh Sa Kahan is a movie whose story revolves around a loving couple of husband and wife, i.e. Peeru (Moammar Rana) and Bella (Reema Khan), respectively.

The story starts with Bella (Reema Khan) who has traveled all the way along to Singapore to lead the naming ceremony of PEERU HOTEL, which is owned by her group named Surkhab Group of Companies, as a token of gift to her husband on his birthday. There she also narrated the success story of her husband (Peeru), who from meager post of waiter as today turned to be the MD of the group. Given all that, both are enjoying a Beautiful and Idealistic Life after Marriage which is full of Love and Passion.

Despite a very affectionate relationship between the husband and wife, Peeru's secretary named Beena (Veena Malik) is shown taking keen interest in Peeru and trying to make illegitimate advances towards Peeru many times. Finally, Beena was successful at inviting Peeru to her home on her birthday party, and Peeru fell for the trap as Peeru was the only invitee for the night. However, before Beena can take advantage of the night and wine, Bella, on the advice of her close but very skeptical friend, Sarah (Simran), intervened on time before any mishap takes place. Although it was not the first time that Sarah (Simran) was seen taking a keen interest in the affairs of Peeru and Bella, while her detest for Beena was also not new. However, the event was enough to shake the trust and affection for Peeru in Bella's heart.

The above event was soon followed by a call from Beena to Bella, which was full of infuriating utterances by Beena, that made Bella leave her house in anger. Soon Bella was at Beena's home, and her pistol pointed towards Beena. Suddenly, there were bangs of gun shots, and Beena was dead, while Bella kept denying that she fired any of the shots.

On the advice of Peeru (Moammar Rana), Bella (Reema Khan) plans to leave for Singapore in order to hide from the police. However, in the last moments, she changes her plan and goes on to stay in Malaysia with her uncle SIR ROMEO (Nadeem Baig), without keeping her husband informed of this. Thus, with an intention to let her husband know about her change of plans, Bella calls to Peeru (Moammar Rana) only, to overhear her friend Sarah and her husband Peeru's romantic gossip. Feeling completely with broken trust, she had a mild nervous breakdown which she soon comes out of.

In the meantime, it becomes clear that Peeru and Sarah, planned this all along for lust, revenge, money and property. While Bella being supported by her faithful driver Butta Singh (Irfan Khoosat) and her uncle Romeo, recovers once again. Soon Butta Singh discloses the fact that it was he who fired the shots that day out of love and faithfulness for his master's degree and that he will take the responsibility of the murder when the right time comes.

Now aware of the true intentions of her husband, Bella takes back the "Power of Attorney" from Peeru, who once again becomes penniless. Uncle Romeo meets with Sarah and talks Sarah into killing Peeru for 10 million dollars on his birthday. The offer was accepted by Sarah.

Finally, on Peeru's birthday, Bella (Reema Khan) reveals the real story to all the invited guests, while on the other side, Sarah points her gun towards Peeru. However, a shot from behind by Sarah's boyfriend Zaviar (Babrak Shah) on the pretext of getting cheated by him, ends her life. However, in the meantime, Peeru realizes his mistakes and apologizes to Bella, who after some thinking, forgives him. Thus the movie ends on a happy note.
