Finlay Park, at , is the largest and most visited park in downtown Columbia, South Carolina. The park opened in 1991. Initially named Sidney Park, it was renamed after a former Columbia mayor Kirkman Finlay in 1994. In the park there was a scenic waterfall along with cascading mountain type stream falling to the park lake. This waterfall has remained broken for the better half of two years. There are picnic tables, two playground areas and a cafe. The park was a favorite for families, but is now home to the city's largest population of homeless people. Problems with the park have persisted and prompted local charity organizations to begin weekly food services to the people living on the park's benches. Outdoor movies are played on Friday nights during the summer months.

The park is also host to numerous events and festivals, including the Sizzlin' Summer Concert Series. The free outdoor concerts (7 â€“ 10 p.m.) run for 13 weeks beginning May 24 and include blues, beach, classical, contemporary/top 40, country, bluegrass, reggae and more. Admission is free and picnics are welcomed (glass containers, grills, pets and radios are not permitted).
