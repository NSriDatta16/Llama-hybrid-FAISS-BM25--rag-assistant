Long Pond Ironworks Historic District

The ironworks were built in 1766 and were added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 11, 1974.

Long Pond Ironworks were founded in 1766 by Peter Hasenclever. Hasenclever brought 500 ironworkers and their families from Germany to build an ironworks "plantation". A dam at "Long Pond" (Greenwood Lake) provided the waterpower needed to operate a blast for the furnace and a large forge. The ironworks produced iron for the Continental Army, for the American forces in the War of 1812, and for the Union Army during the Civil War. Metalmaking stopped at the site in 1882 when the ironworks was bankrupted by newer facilities in Pittsburgh.

The remnants of the ironmaking structures at the district date from the 18th and 19th centuries. There are furnaces, casting house ruins, charging areas, ice houses, water wheels and other structures. The area is currently undergoing restoration. The "Old Country Store" has been renovated and now houses the Long Pond Ironworks Museum. The original Village of Hewitt grew up around the 19th-century iron enterprise. This settlement included a church, a store/post office, schoolhouses, and dwellings and outbuildings for workers and managers.

There are many structures within Long Pond Ironworks. There are two main water wheels in fairly good condition, despite one of the wheels being burned by vandals in 1957. There are also several furnaces of various sizes located on the property. Long Pond Ironworks Historic Site offers a tour of the historic area, where slag and charcoal produced by the ironworks are visible.
