Buster Poindexter version

The song was later covered in 1987 by American singer David Johansen, as his lounge singer persona Buster Poindexter, and released as the first single from his album Buster Poindexter. It garnered extensive airplay through radio, MTV, and other television appearances. The music video is unique in the fact that it crosses the two identities: despite being in the Buster Poindexter persona, the video begins with Johansen briefly mentioning his role as the frontman for the 1970s proto-punk band the New York Dolls, showing the band's vinyl and tossing them aside while talking about the "really outrageous clothes" he wore and how he came to be interested in a "refined and dignified kind of a situation", which leads into the song.

In an interview on National Public Radio, Johansen called the tune "the bane of my existence," owing to its pervasive popularity as a karaoke and wedding song.

In 2013, reggaeton artist Don Omar released a cover titled "Feeling Hot" for his live album Hecho en Puerto Rico''. His version peaked at No. 22 on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart in the United States.  Omar's cover led to Arrow posthumously winning the ASCAP Latin Award in the Urban category.
