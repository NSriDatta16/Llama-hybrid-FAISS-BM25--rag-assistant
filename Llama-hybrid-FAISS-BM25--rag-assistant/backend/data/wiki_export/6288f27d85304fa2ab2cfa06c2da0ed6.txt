Anna Komnene Angelina or Comnena Angelina (; c. 1176 – 1212) was Empress consort of Nicaea. She was the daughter of emperor Alexios III Angelos and of Euphrosyne Doukaina Kamatera.

Life
Her first marriage was to the sebastokratōr Isaac Komnenos Vatatzes, a great-nephew of the emperor Manuel I Komnenos. They had one daughter, Theodora Angelina. Soon after Anna's father became emperor, in 1195, Isaac Komnenos was dispatched to combat the Uprising of Asen and Peter. He was captured, became a pawn between rival Bulgarian and Vlach factions, and died in chains.

Her second marriage to Theodore Laskaris, future emperor of Nicaea, was celebrated in a double wedding in early 1200 (the other couple was Anna's sister Irene and Alexios Palaiologos).
