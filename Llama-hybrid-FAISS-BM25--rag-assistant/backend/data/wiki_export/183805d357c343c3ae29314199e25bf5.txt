History 
The station was opened by the Busby Railway on 1 January 1866.  Services were subsequently extended through to East Kilbride by the Caledonian Railway two years later and eventually to High Blantyre (on the Hamilton and Strathaven Railway), though the section beyond East Kilbride closed back in the 1940s.  A further pair of connections to the Lanarkshire and Ayrshire Railway were subsequently constructed around 1903-4 by the latter company, though only the south to west one saw regular traffic and even then for just a few months.

Proposals put forward by British Rail in the early 1980s would have seen the former south to east curve reinstated to allow East Kilbride trains to be re-routed via ,  and  to Glasgow Central.  The scheme would have seen the branch electrified but the Clarkston to Busby Junction portion would have been closed, along with  and  stations.  The plans were not well received and were eventually dropped.

Services 
The station has a half-hourly service in each direction (including Sundays) to  and .
