Criticism

Stucco defects in Florida homes
In 2019, after an investigation by Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody, Pulte agreed to pay $4.7 million in restitution and make repairs to houses it sold in Florida that had cracks in stucco applied to a wood frame, stucco delamination, and improper installation of weep screed.

2009 allegations of systematic construction defects
On March 26, 2009, Building Justice, a project of the International Union of Painters and the Sheet Metal Workers International Association, with support from the AFL-CIO, released the report of a survey of 872 Pulte and Del Webb home owners in Arizona, Nevada, and California, in which 63% of respondents reported construction defects in their homes. The report "Poorly Built by Pulte, No Different at Del Webb: Homeowner Dissatisfaction in Arizona, Nevada, and California" was published on the project's website.

Assault of picketing workers
In May 2007, during a protest at a Pulte Homes construction site, an employee used a water truck owned by the company to repeatedly assault a group of workers picketing outside a home with a high-pressure water hose. On June 20, 2007, a video of the incident was posted on Youtube.

Dismissed lawsuit regarding propping up sale prices
In October 2009, a class-action lawsuit was filed by Steve Berman accusing the company of artificially propping up house sales prices and contributing to the United States housing bubble. The lawsuit was dismissed by the court.
