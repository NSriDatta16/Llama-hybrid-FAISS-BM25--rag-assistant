Eulimellini is a tribe of minute sea snails, marine gastropod molluscs in the family Pyramidellidae, the pyrams and their allies.

Taxonomy 
According to Schander, Van Aartsen & Corgan (1999) there are 17 genera in the Eulimellinae.

As "Eulimellinae", this taxon was previously one of eleven recognised subfamilies of the Pyramidellidae (according to the taxonomy of Ponder & Lindberg, 1997).

In the taxonomy of Bouchet & Rocroi (2005), this subfamily Cingulininae was downgraded to the rank of tribe, as Eulimellini, belonging to the subfamily Turbonillinae.
