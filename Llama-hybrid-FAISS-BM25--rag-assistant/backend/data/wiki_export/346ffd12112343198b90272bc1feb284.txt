Choi Sai Woo Park () is an urban park located near the top of Braemar Hill at Braemar Hill Road, Hong Kong. The park serves as a social hub for the neighbourhood.

History
The park was named after the Choi Sai Woo Reservoir, which was formerly located in the park. According to the commemorative plaque in the park, the reservoir was built by Taikoo Sugar Company Limited in 1894; it was the largest and the last of the five private reservoirs built by the company. During the drought and bubonic plague outbreak that started in 1894, the reservoir once supplied water to Tai Ping Shan District. It was filled in  to create the current park site. In World War II it was the scene of bitter fighting as the Japanese advanced towards Wong Nai Chung Gap to split the defence of Hong Kong into two.

The park was built at a cost of $9.5 million and opened by the Urban Council in August 1986. It was designed to retain most of the existing mature trees and shrubs on site. An opening ceremony, officiated by Urban Councillor Kim Cham and the Director of Urban Services, was held on 16 January 1987.
