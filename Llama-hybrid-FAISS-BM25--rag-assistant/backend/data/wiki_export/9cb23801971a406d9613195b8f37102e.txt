Adderley Park railway station serves the Adderley Park area in the east of Birmingham, England. The station, and all trains serving it, are operated by West Midlands Trains. It was threatened with closure in 2004, but was given a reprieve (although its train service was reduced from half-hourly to hourly each way). The station will become the main railway station for the proposed City of Birmingham Stadium, if that is constructed.

It lies on Bordesley Green Road, part of the B4145.

History

Opened by the London and North Western Railway, it became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway 
following the Grouping of 1923. The line passed to the London Midland Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948.

When Sectorisation was introduced, the station was served by Regional Railways on behalf of the West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive, for whom British Rail had been running the trains since the PTE's inception. Services on the Intercity Sector would frequently pass through on the West Coast Main Line as these services, run by the current operator, continue to do.

When the ticket office is open tickets must be purchased before boarding the train.
