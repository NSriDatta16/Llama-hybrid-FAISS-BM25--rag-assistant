The Dallas Independent School District, which covers most of the city, is one of the largest school districts in the United States. It operates independently of the city and enrolls over 161,000 students.  One of the district's magnet schools, the School for the Talented & Gifted, was named the #1 school in the United States (in a list of public and private schools) by Newsweek in 2006 and 2007. The Science and Engineering Magnet, another local magnet school, was ranked eighth in 2006 and second in 2007 in the same survey.

Dallas extends into several other school districts including Carrollton-Farmers Branch, Duncanville, Garland, Highland Park, Mesquite, Plano, and Richardson. The Wilmer-Hutchins Independent School District once served portions of southern Dallas, but it was shut down for the 2005-2006 year. WHISD students started attending other Dallas ISD schools during that time. Following the close, the Texas Education Agency consolidated WHISD into Dallas ISD, which will work to rebuild the schools in the former WHISD area.

Libraries 

The city is served by the Dallas Public Library system.  The system was originally created by the Dallas Federation of Women's Clubs with efforts spearheaded by then-president Mrs. Henry (May Dickson) Exall â€” Her work raising money led to a grant from philanthropist and steel baron Andrew Carnegie, which enabled the construction of the first branch in 1901.  Today the library operates 25 branch locations throughout the city. The Dallas Public Library also operates J. Erik Jonsson Central Library, the 8-story main library in the Government District of downtown.  It also operates the Bookmarks Children's library in the Northpark Mall.
