History

Wilton station opened in 1852 alongside Cannondale station, Georgetown station, and Kent station on the Danbury and Norwalk Railroad. The original station house was replaced in 1939 by the current one. The original station was moved north to the nearby property of Charles Dana in 1941. Following the death of Dana in 1968, the town acquired the Dana property. However, the original station had fallen into advanced disrepair, and after almost being demolished in 1974, the original station house was moved to Lambert Corners in 1978. where it remains today.

On May 21, 2014, both businesses housed inside of the station house closed unexpectedly. During the COVID-19 pandemic, ridership at Wilton station dropped significantly, prompting a decreased frequency of trains stopping at Wilton.
