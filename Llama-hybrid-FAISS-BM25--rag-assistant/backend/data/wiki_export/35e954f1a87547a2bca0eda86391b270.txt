Career
Ravi writes songs with Anders Løvlie under the name Ravi og DJ Løv. He played in the bands like Briskeby, Folk & Røvere, Jessica Fletchers and was a founding member of Jaga Jazzist (1994-2001).

Ravi covered the song "Cheerio", originally sung by The Monroes, and renamed it Tsjeriåu/Tsjeriå. In the music video, he appears as a baby and DJ Løv is dressed as a Marine.

Ravi has also appeared in "Venn" ("Friend") by Espen Lind and Lene Marlin, which was made to raise money for tsunami victims.

Ravi has released many albums, in his own "Ravi language", he writes things phonetically, e.g. "cheerio" = "tsjeriåu", "kroppen min" (my body) = kråpn min, and "it's too late to cry" = "its tu leit tu krai".

Some of his other known songs are "Utadæsjælåplevelse", "E-Ore", "Ås To I Osjlo" and "Dødsøt".

In 2007, 2008 and 2009 he was the host of the show "Landeplage" on NRK.
