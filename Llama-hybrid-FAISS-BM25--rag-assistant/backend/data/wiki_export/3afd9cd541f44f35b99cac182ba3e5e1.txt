Marcel Arland (5 July 1899, Varennes-sur-Amance, Haute-Marne – 12 January 1986, Haute-Marne) was a French novelist, literary critic, and journalist.

Biography
With René Crevel and Roger Vitrac he founded the dadaist newspaper Aventure. He was awarded the Prix Goncourt for L'Ordre in 1929, and was elected to the French academy in 1968.  He directed the Nouvelle Revue Française from 1968 to 1977.

References

Arland is referenced by Deleuze & Guattari in Chapter 8 of A Thousand Plateaus. They cite Arland's 1944 work 'Le Promeneur' where he describes the novella as "nothing but pure lines right down to the nuances, and nothing but the pure and conscious power of the word". Arland's view of the novella form accords with Deleuze and Guattari's: that it consists of abstract lines (connections) that constitute subjects and entities by relating them to one another.
