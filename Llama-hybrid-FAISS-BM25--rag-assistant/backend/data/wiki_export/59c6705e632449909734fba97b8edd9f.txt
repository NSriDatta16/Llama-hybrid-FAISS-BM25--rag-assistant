Henry E. Larkin (January 12, 1860 – January 31, 1942) was a professional baseball player who played Major League Baseball for 10 seasons (1883–1893).

At age 24, Larkin started his career with the Philadelphia Athletics in 1884. On June 16, 1885, he hit for the cycle. That same year in a single game he recorded four doubles, still a major league record that has been tied many times, but never broken.
He played six years with the club, usually hitting above .300. His 7th season he switched leagues to the Players' League, and was the Cleveland Infants' star first baseman, hitting .330 and knocking in 112 RBI. He also managed the club in 1890. When the league disbanded, he returned to Philadelphia, and later finished his career with the Washington Senators. He averaged a .303 batting average for his career. Unlike other power hitters of his era, Larkin hit more of his home runs on the road than at home – 35 versus 18.
