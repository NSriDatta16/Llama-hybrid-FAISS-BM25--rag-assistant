In regions where they are said to appear and disappear, there seemed to be a custom where children were warned that if they play too late, that " would come."

Also, it is said that in Kimotsuki, there are shrines (the  for example) where  are said to frequently appear, and it was believed that when children pass in front of the shrine, an  flying above in the skies would attack the last child in line, so children would go run ahead and cut through.

In fiction
There are no depictions of ittan momen in classical yōkai emaki, so these yōkai was once relatively unknown, but they have become more widely known since appearing in Mizuki Shigeru's manga GeGeGe no Kitarō. This manga depicted them as speaking a Kyushu dialect, having good-natured personalities, and having a unique look while flying, which raised their fame and popularity despite their original legend of attacking people. In Mizuki's depictions these yōkai are depicted as a cloth with two eyes and two arms, so now they are commonly perceived to be pieces of cloth with two eyes in yōkai depictions, but Mizuki's depictions are original inventions and the ones in actual legend and in the previous witness reports have no eyes or arms and are instead simply flying objects that resembled cloth. In Mizuki's birthplace, Sakaiminato, Tottori Prefecture, they ranked number 1 in the "First Yōkai Popularity Poll" held by the tourism association.

In Kamen Rider Hibiki they appeared as enemy characters and they were based on the original legend with some extra original twists on their appearance and personality.

In 2007, the local historian of Kagoshima Prefecture, Takenoi Satoshi, started creating kamishibai of ittan momen so that such legends that are gradually being forgotten can be remembered by the children.

In the 2020 anime adaptation of the In/Spectre ("Kyokō Suiri") novels, an ittan momen drawn in the Mizuki style, flies out from under the skirt of the female protagonist Kotoko.

Similar yōkai
The following are yōkai considered to be similar to ittan momen. The musasabi would through the air along forest streets at night and cling to people's faces in surprise, so it is theorized that they are thought to a yōkai like this.

Fusuma ("bedding")
A yōkai told to frequently appear and disappear on Sado Island in the Edo Period. It was a yōkai that looked like a large furoshiki, and they would come flying out of nowhere at roads at night and cover the heads of pedestrians. They cannot be cut with blades of any sharpness, but they can be bit apart with teeth that have been blackened at least once. It is said that because of this, there was a custom for males to blacken their teeth.

Futon kabuse (literally, "cover with futon")
Saku-shima, Aichi Prefecture. In the writings of the folkloricist Kunio Yanagita, it is only written that "they'd float along and flying in with a whoosh, covering and suffocating to death," so there are not many legends about it and not much is known, but it is interpreted to be a futon-shaped object that come flying in and covering people's faces and suffocating them to death.

In popular culture
 In the anime/manga series Inu x Boku SS, one of the characters, Renshō Sorinozuka, is an Ittan-momen.
 In the tokusatsu franchise Super Sentai, the Ittan-momen was seen as a basis of a monster in series installments themed after Japanese culture:
 In Kakuranger (1994), one of the Youkai Army Corps members the Kakurangers fought was an Ittan-momen. It appeared in the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers toyline as "Calcifire".
 In Shinkenger (2009), one of the Ayakashi, named Urawadachi, served as the basis of the Ittan-momen within the series. He was not adapted into Power Rangers Samurai.
 In Ninninger (2015), one of the Youkai the Ninningers fought was an Ittan-momen, with elements borrowed from a carpet and a magician. It was later adapted into Power Rangers Ninja Steel as Abrakadanger who appears in his self-titled episode.
 In The Legend of Korra in the Avatar series, the two waring spirits, Raava and Vaatu that are based on Yin and Yang, may have had their designs inspired from Ittan-momen.
 In Yo-kai Watch, the Ittan-momen appears as a cloth-strip Yo-kai and is called So-Sorree in the English dub. Anyone inspirited by So-Sorree can become mischievous and then give insincere apologies. So-Sorree can evolve into Bowminos (a domino-shaped Yo-kai who makes anyone it inspirits give sincere apologies) and can be fused with Merican Flower to become Ittan-Sorry.
 In GeGeGe no Kitarō, a recurring yōkai character named Ittan Momen (Rollo Cloth in English translations) appears as an anthropomorphic cloth with the ability to fly. He is among Kitaro's core group of friends.
