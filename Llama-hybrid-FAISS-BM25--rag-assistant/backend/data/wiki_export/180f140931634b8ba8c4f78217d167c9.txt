The Daily Campus, founded in 1896, is a student-run newspaper at the University of Connecticut. The Daily Campus has a circulation of 1,500 on weekdays during school term. Since its creation, the newspaper has undergone several name changes, having starting as The Storrs Agricultural College Lookout, a monthly, when it published its first issue on May 11, 1896. The name was changed to The Connecticut Campus in 1915, followed by The Connecticut Daily Campus, and then finally The Daily Campus in 1984. It began publishing five days a week during the academic year in 1952 and became a morning paper in 1955.

The newspaper's offices are located at The Daily Campus Building at 1266 Storrs Road in Storrs, Connecticut. The paper was previously located across campus at 121 North Eagleville Road, but moved to the current location in 1991/1992. Though originally addressed at 11 Dog Lane, the building was re-addressed as 1266 Storrs Road in the spring of 2012 to accommodate the new buildings being constructed alongside the building as part of the new Storrs Center.

The building is located at the south entrance to campus, across the street from the Fine Arts Building, and adjacent to Buckley Residence Hall.

History

2015–present 
In 2015 The Daily Campus switched to a board composed entirely of student voters, rather than the mixture of professionals (non-students) and students that have served on the board since the seventies.  The decision was made after the university threatened to take away funding from the paper and the editor-in-chief at the time, with student support, agreed to the university administration's demands, citing the over $300,000 in student fees the paper is dependent upon (which account for nearly 75% of the paper's total income).

Coverage

The Daily Campus splits its coverage into sections, including news, opinion, comics, life, and sports. It also regularly publishes special extras, usually tabloid-style inserts of approximately eight to 12 pages.

In 2014 the opinion section retracted and issued an apology for a piece titled "On sexual assault, risk of overreacting."

Operation

The paper operates as a daily, printing 147 issues a year with a circulation of 8,000. Its staff is roughly 180 students.

It is funded by a mix of student fees and advertising revenue, and has struggled financially .
