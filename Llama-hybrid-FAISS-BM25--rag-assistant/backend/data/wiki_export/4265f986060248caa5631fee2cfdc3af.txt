U.F.Off: The Best of the Orb is a greatest hits album by The Orb released in 1998 by Island Records.  There is both a double disc and single disc version, the latter being the first disc of the former. The second disc contains alternate mixes of many of the tracks on the first.
Unlike many "greatest hits" releases that include the tracks as individual, stand-alone pieces, the tracks included here are seamlessly continuously-mixed like other DJ mixes.
