Balbriggan railway station () serves Balbriggan in County Dublin.

The station is located on the Dublin to Belfast railway line. It is the northern limit of Dublin's Short Hop Zone, meaning it is the last station Leap cards are valid at. Due to a growing population, planning permission has been submitted to increase the capacity of the station.

History
The station opened on 25 May 1844. It was opened by the Dublin and Drogheda Railway, then run by the Great Northern Railway (Ireland) until 1950.  The GNR(I) was then taken over by the Irish and Northern Irish Governments and was run through the Railway Board until 1958. Upon the dissolution of the GNRB those portions of the former GNR(I) within the Irish Republic passed to the Córas Iompair Éireann. The station closed for goods traffic on Monday 2 December 1974.
