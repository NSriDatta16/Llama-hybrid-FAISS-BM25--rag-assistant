Wallace's Cave is situated in Roslin Glen, in Midlothian, Scotland beside the River Avon. It is also known as Hawthornden Castle Cave, after Hawthornden Castle which is nearby.  It takes its name from William Wallace, the Scottish national hero, who participated in the Battle of Roslin, which took place close to the cave on 24 February 1303. The cave is made up of Limestone and would have formed between 363 and 325 million years ago under water.
