La Géode is a mirror-finished geodesic dome that holds an Omnimax theatre in Parc de la Villette at the Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie (City of Science and Industry) in the 19th arrondissement of Paris, France.

The nearest Paris Métro stations to La Géode are Corentin Cariou on Line 7 and Porte de Pantin on Line 5.

In 2017, Pathé Gaumont was chosen as the new operator of the cinema. A refurbishment was announced, and the building closed for works to modernize its concept on December 1, 2018, to reopen to the public in June 2020. La Géode remains closed as of 2023, with no announced reopening date.

Structure 
La Géode was designed by architect Adrien Fainsilber and engineer Gérard Chamayou. The geodesic dome is  in diameter, composed of 6,433 polished stainless steel triangles that form the sphere that reflects the sky. These triangles are 1.5 meters long and are fixed on a thin metal frame with the same triangular geodesic structure, consisting of 2,580 steel tube bars. The dome stands on a reinforced concrete base, which is attached to Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie, the largest science museum in Europe. La Géode officially opened on May 6, 1985. After a similar venue located in La Défense closed in 2001, La Géode became the only spherical building in the Île-de-France region of France.

Before the name "Géode" was selected, other names were proposed, including humorous suggestions such as "Bouboule", "Irma", "Minouchette", "Double Zéro", and "Zézette".

Theatre 
Until closing for refurbishment in 2018, movies were projected in IMAX format on a giant hemispherical screen covering . The auditorium was fitted with a 12-point sound system with four large subwoofers that deliver 21,000 watts in surround sound designed by Cabasse. The IMAX films were presented in high definition and Géode 3D-relief, feature science, nature, and travel documentaries, short and long feature-length films, and high definition animated subjects. It also presented satellite concert events, including live broadcasts of the Metropolitan Opera from New York City.
