Ignitor is a heavy metal band based in Austin, in the U.S. state of Texas.

History 
Ignitor was formed in 2003 by Erika Tandy (ex-Autumn Tears, vocals), Stuart Laurence aka Batlord (lead guitar, ex-Agony Column), Pat Doyle (ex-Offenders, ex-Pocket Fishrmen, drums), Beverly Barrington (ex-T.A.N.G., rhythm guitar), and Brendon Bigelow (ex-Death Of Millions, ex-T.A.N.G., bass guitar). In the spring of 2006, Beverly Barrigton left the band and was replaced with Annah Moore (ex-Boneglove, ex-Red Volution). The band has been compared to early NWOBHM acts, such as Judas Priest and Iron Maiden. In July 2005, the Austin Chronicle listed Erika Tandy number one in a list of top ten frontmen in Austin music.

In late 2007, Erika and guitarist Annah left the band for personal reasons. Founding member Beverly Barrigton was asked to rejoin the band and in October 2008. Then the band scored a coup de grace by recruiting legendary metal frontman Jason McMaster (Watchtower, Dangerous Toys) as lead vocalist, and recorded their second full-length album entitled The Spider Queen in 2009, and their third, "Year of the Metal Tiger" in 2012.
