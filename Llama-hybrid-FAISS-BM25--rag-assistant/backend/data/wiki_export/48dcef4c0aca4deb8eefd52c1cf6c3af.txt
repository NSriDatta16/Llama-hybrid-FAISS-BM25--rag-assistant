Sunny Delight Beverages Co. is the creator of SunnyD, formally known as Sunny Delight. It spun off from Procter & Gamble in 2004. The company is owned by Harvest Hill Beverage Company.

History 

The original predecessor of Sunny Delight Beverages Co., Sunny Delight, was founded in 1963 in Florida by Howard Dick and Phil Grinnell. In 1966, it was purchased by a Coca-Cola bottling operation who later, in 1982, sold it and its now parent company, Doric Foods, to the bottler's parent, The Coca-Cola Company.

Doric Foods was then sold in 1983 to a joint venture between Charterhouse Group International and American Fruit Co., creating Sundor Brands Inc. Sundor was acquired by Procter & Gamble in 1989. In the late 1990s, SunnyD expanded into both Canada and Europe.

In 2004, Sunny Delight Beverages Co. was established when J. W. Childs, a Boston-based private equity firm, acquired Sunny Delight brands from Procter & Gamble. Through the 2000s, the company expanded its product offerings, launching the Elations brand in 2007 and acquiring Veryfine and Fruit20 from Kraft in the same year. In 2009, it acquired Bossa Nova from that brand's founder.

Sunny Delight Europe was sold to Orangina Schweppes in 2011 and in 2016 J. W. Childs sold Sunny Delight Beverages Co. to Brynwood Partners.

Operations 
The company’s main headquarters are located in Blue Ash, Ohio with a head count of 615 employees. It operates five manufacturing plants located in the United States.

Economic achievements 
SDBC seeks to increase profits through stewardship of resources and improvements in the taste, healthiness, and packaging of their products.
 Recycling efforts are a revenue stream
 Introduced three new products that they believe will help increase revenue and volume as consumers become aware of and purchase them: SunnyD pouches geared toward the lunchbox occasion; SunnyD Chillers to satisfy consumers during thirstquenching occasions; and Sparkling Fruit2O to provide consumers with the excitement of carbonation married with natural fruit flavors and a trusted brand name.
 Significantly increased the use of aseptic packaging capability – a process generating great tasting, preservative free products.

 Motivated healthy behavior changes by rewarding employees up to $300/year for maintaining/improving specific biometric measures.
 Developed innovative competitions using employees’ Nike+Fuelbands to encourage exercise.
