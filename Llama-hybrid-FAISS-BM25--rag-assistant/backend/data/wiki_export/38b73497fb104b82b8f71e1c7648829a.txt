Radio personality
Before working at KSSK, Price worked for the administration of Hawaii Governor George Ariyoshi and served as the University of Hawaii Director of the Small Business Management Program. Congressman Cecil Heftel needed a new vice president of public relations and publicity for his radio station and hired Price for the position in 1977.  In August 1983, Price was paired with afternoon radio deejay Michael W. Perry to host the station's morning drive program. A top-rated program in the state, the two continue to host the same program today despite various station ownership changes.

Perry and Price host a popular live radio variety show each Saturday in front of a ballroom audience.  Over twenty years, it had been broadcast from the Champeaux at the Ilikai Hotel, the Hanohano Room of the Sheraton Waikiki Hotel, John Dominis Restaurant in Waikiki, and after 6 years at Jimmy Buffett's at the Beachcomber, and the show had its final broadcast from the KSSK studios at Dole Cannery.  The show's popularity has garnered frequent appearances by celebrities that include Arnold Schwarzenegger, Dolly Parton, Oprah Winfrey and many more.

In May 2016 at the age of 81, Price ended his 33-year run as a co-host of the Perry and Price show. Price simultaneously announced he would begin a new sports show with Rick Hamada on KIKI: FOX Sports 990 Hawai'i, airing Saturdays at 11 a.m.
