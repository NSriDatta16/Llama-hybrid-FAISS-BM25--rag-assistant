Historical orders, decorations and medals

Union of South Africa

The Union of South Africa was formed in 1910, as a self-governing Dominion in the British Empire. A medal was issued to commemorate the event.

As a Dominion, the Union came under the British honours system, and South Africans featured in the semi-annual British honours lists. South Africans also received British civilian decorations for bravery. The nationalist government stopped the conferment of titles and orders in 1925, and discontinued nominations for bravery awards after the Union's independence was recognised in 1931. It established its own bravery awards a few years later.

The Union's civil honours thus consisted of:

 Decoration
 King's/Queen's Medal for Bravery (1939–61)
 Commemorative Medal
 Union of South Africa Commemoration Medal (1910)
 War service medal
 South African Medal for War Services (1945)

When South Africa established its own independent honours system in 1952, the Queen's Medal for Bravery was transferred to it. The medal issued to mark Queen Elizabeth II's coronation in 1953 was also ranked as a South African award, because she was Queen of South Africa as well as of the United Kingdom and her other realms and territories.

Republic of South Africa

South Africa became a republic outside the Commonwealth on 31 May 1961.

1967–1986

During the 1960s and 1970s, the government developed a small range of civil honours to recognise bravery and meritorious service:

 Decorations and orders
 Woltemade Decoration for Bravery (1970–88)
 Order of the Star of South Africa (Civilian Division) (SSA/SSAS) (1978–2002)
 Order of Good Hope (1973–2003)
 Decoration for Meritorious Service (DMS) (1970–86)
 Civil Defence Medal for Bravery (1976–??)
 Civil Defence Medal for Meritorious Service (1976–??)

 Sports awards
 State President's Sports Award (1967–94)
 South African Sports Merit Award (1971–94)

1986–2002

The civil honours system was enlarged during the 1980s. In 1986, the five orders were collectively dubbed the "national orders", and a Chancery of Orders was established in the Office of the State President to administer them. These were retained after South Africa's return to the Commonwealth of Nations in 1994. The expanded honours system comprised:

 Decorations and orders
 Woltemade Cross for Bravery (WD/WDS) (1988–2002)
 Order of the Southern Cross (OSG/OSS) (1986–2002)
 Order of the Star of South Africa (Non-Military) (SSA/SSAS) (1978–2002)
 Order for Meritorious Service (OMSG/OMSS) (1986–2002)
 Order of Good Hope (1973–2003)
 Civil Protection Medal for Bravery (1976–??)
 President's Decoration for Distinguished Service (1987–??)
 Civil Protection Medal for Meritorious Service (1976–??)
 Sports awards
 State President's Sports Award (1967–94)
 South African Sports Merit Award (1971–94)

Union of South Africa King's/Queen's Medal for Bravery

The Union of South Africa King's Medal for Bravery was instituted in 1939 to award South African citizens for exceptional gallantry in saving life.

The decoration had two grades (Gold and Silver) and had a blue ribbon with orange edges. The medal lapsed on 31 May 1961, when South Africa became a republic, albeit, outside the Commonwealth.

Woltemade Decoration for Bravery

The Woltemade Decoration for Bravery was a revived, republican version of the King's/Queen's Medal for Bravery. It was instituted in 1970 and was awarded until 1988, when it was replaced by the Woltemade Cross for Bravery.

Woltemade Cross for Bravery

The Woltemade Cross for Bravery (post-nominal letters: WD) was instituted in 1988, replacing the Woltemade Decoration, to award South African citizens for outstanding bravery in saving life. The cross had two grades (Gold and Silver) and had a blue ribbon with orange edges. The Woltemade Cross was discontinued in 2002.
