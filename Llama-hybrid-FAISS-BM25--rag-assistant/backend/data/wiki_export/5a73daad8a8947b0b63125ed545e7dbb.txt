This dockyard was the final Tamar shore station prior to the handover and used briefly by the Royal Navy. The base was closed on April 11, 1997 a few months prior to the handover and centenary of HMS Tamar's arrival to Hong Kong.

The base was used to service 3 of the Peacock class patrol ships:

 HMS Peacock
 HMS Plover
 HMS Starling

The ships remained at the decommissioned base before being sold to the Philippine Navy.
