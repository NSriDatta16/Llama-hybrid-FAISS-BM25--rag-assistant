Theodor Scheimpflug (October 7, 1865 - August 22, 1911) was an Austrian army Captain who elaborated a systematic method and apparatus for correcting perspective distortion in aerial photographs, now known as the eponymous Scheimpflug principle. He disclaimed inventing it however, citing an English patent of the early French photographic engineer Jules Carpentier.

Work

He was also involved in aerial photography, and held several patents in that area.
