During the 1990s the Civic Center witnessed a large number of performances by large Alternative rock bands such as Nirvana, The Foo Fighters, Jane's Addiction, The Smashing Pumpkins, Fugazi, Soundgarden, and Rage Against the Machine. As the Civic Center slowly fell into disrepair over the course of the decades the planetarium had to be closed, and concerts fell into disfavor.

Control and ownership of the Civic Center was transferred from the City of Fitchburg to Fitchburg State University in August, 2007. Since this transfer, the college has performed many upgrades to the Civic Center. These include new roofing, new ice making machinery and ventilation, and overall refurbishment. They have also transformed the Landry Arena into an indoor turf field.
