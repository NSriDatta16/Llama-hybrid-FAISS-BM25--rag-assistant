Personal life

Her sister was also abused by the same man, later identified as Gerry Depaula. At the time she believed it was wrong behavior but wanted to gain his affection. Burke testified against Depaula at age 6, leading to him being sentenced to 24 years in prison. He was released in 2008. Burke said that she is fearful of Depaula.

Burke has done numerous promotions outside of Dancing with the Stars which include Depend Silhouette briefs, Impress Nails and Sargento Cheese.

She opened her first dance studio in April 2008 and created her own line of activewear the next year.
