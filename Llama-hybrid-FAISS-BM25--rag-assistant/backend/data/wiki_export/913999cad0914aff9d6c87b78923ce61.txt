Goodleburg Cemetery is a cemetery located in  South Wales, New York.  It is an old, inactive village lot whose use has been discontinued.  Many of the original settlers of Wales and the surrounding areas are buried here.

History 
Goodleberg Cemetery was an active cemetery from 1811 until 1927. The cemetery stood relatively peacefully until the late 1990s, when stories spread about ghost stories and ghastly apparitions.  Various paranormal research organizations, intent on capturing the paranormal activities at Goodleberg paraded carloads of investigators from neighboring counties, intent on capturing evidence of the paranormal.

Folklore

In recent years, it has been a site of frequent desecration.

Paranormal author Mason Winfield has written about this cemetery and its purported activity several times, but has also expressed regret to writing anything about it due to the spike in vandalism since then.
