The Eight honors and Eight Shames () also known as the Eight honors and Disgraces, is a set of moral concepts developed by former General Secretary Hu Jintao for the citizens of the People's Republic of China. It is also known as Eight Virtues and Shames, or Hu Jintao's Eight-Step Programme. Its formal name in China is Socialist Concepts on honors and Disgraces ().

On March 4, 2006, Hu released this list calling it the "new moral yardstick to measure the work, conduct and attitude of Communist Party officials."  It is being promulgated as the moral code for all Chinese, especially Communist Party cadres.
