People is Barbra Streisand's fourth solo studio album, released in September 1964. The title track was a newly recorded version of the hit song from the Broadway musical Funny Girl in which Streisand starred.

The album became the first of Streisand's albums to hit #1 on the Billboard album chart, spending five weeks in the top spot; it was also certified Platinum. After hitting #1 on the charts, Barbra received a commemorative plaque from Billboard magazine editor Mike Gross. The album was re-released in the UK on the CBS Hallmark Series label in 1966 with different artwork.

In 2017, the album was selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or artistically significant."

Artwork
The cover photo was taken by Don Bronstein at Chicago's Oak Street Beach in June 1963, when Streisand was in town for an engagement at Mister Kelly's nightclub.
