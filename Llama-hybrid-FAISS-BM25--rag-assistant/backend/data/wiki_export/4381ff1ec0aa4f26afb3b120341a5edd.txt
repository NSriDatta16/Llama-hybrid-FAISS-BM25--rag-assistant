The "" is, as stated in the title, the national anthem of the Republic of San Marino. It was written by Federico Consolo, an Italian violinist and composer, and was officially adopted in 1894, replacing both "La Sammarinese" and the "Hymn of San Marino".

It is one of a few without official lyrics along with the "Marcha Real" of Spain, the National Anthem of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and "Europe" of Kosovo. Giosu√© Carducci wrote the lyrics which were never adopted and are not sung in official ceremonies. While they are occasionally performed in informal contexts and taught in school, they remain quite unpopular among the citizens.

It is regularly played in the streets of the City of San Marino by the musicians of the Sammarinese Armed Forces during national and religious festivals.
