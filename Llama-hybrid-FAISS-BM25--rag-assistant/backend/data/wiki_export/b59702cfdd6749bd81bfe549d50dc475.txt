Jan Tesánek () (1728–1788) was a Bohemian scholar and author of scientific literature.

Biography
Tesánek studied at a gymnasium (school) in Prague and later at Faculty of Philosophy of Charles University. In 1745, he became a Jesuit and studied mathematics, physics and astronomy under Joseph Stepling, a student of Ignatz Mühlwenzel. Stepling introduced Tesánek to the works of Isaac Newton. After finishing under the Faculty of Philosophy, Tesánek continued with study of theology. He was then ordained a priest and became professor of physics at Charles University. Later, he taught mathematics at the University of Olomouc. Two years later he returned to Prague to assume a professorship of high mathematics at the University. He remained at the University after the dissolution of the Jesuit order in 1773 and assumed the position of head of the Department of Mathematics and Physics in 1778. Tesánek is known for his many writings on the science of the day, helping to spread knowledge of scientific findings throughout Europe.
