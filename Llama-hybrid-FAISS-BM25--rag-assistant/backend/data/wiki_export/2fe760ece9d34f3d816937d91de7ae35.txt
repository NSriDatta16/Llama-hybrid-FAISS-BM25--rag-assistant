Jonathan Andrew Kaye (born August 2, 1970) is an American professional golfer who played on the PGA Tour.

Early life
Kaye was born in Denver, Colorado, and is Jewish. He attended Sunnyslope High School in Phoenix, Arizona, where he was a star in golf, graduating in 1988. Kaye graduated from the University of Colorado in 1993.

Professional career 
Kaye turned pro the year he graduated from college. Kaye successfully graduated from 1994 PGA Tour Qualifying School started playing on tour the following year.

Kaye has won twice on the PGA Tour, at the 2003 Buick Classic and the 2004 FBR Open, and he has over 30 top-10 finishes. He is a self-taught player who has never had a teacher. "There's nobody who could teach my swing," he has said.

Kaye has featured in the top 20 of the Official World Golf Ranking, though he has not played a PGA Tour event since 2011. Kaye briefly reappeared on the Web.com Tour in 2014, playing in three events and making the cut once with a T65 at the Panama Claro Championship. He also played on the Web.com Tour in 2017. In July 2017, 21 years after winning his first Colorado Open, he won it again with a record-tying 23-under-par 265 in the 53rd CoBank Colorado Open, earning $100,000.

2001 incident
Kaye was the co-leader at the 2001 Michelob Championship at Kingsmill after the second round. As he was heading to the locker room, a security guard refused him entry without his player ID badge, which Kaye then found and clipped provocatively to his belt buckle or the zipper of his pants. The guard took offense, and PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem reportedly suspended Kaye for two months (but the PGA Tour never divulges or even acknowledges player suspensions).
