Professional wrestling career

Independent circuit (1997–present)
Dux trained under Scott D'Amore, Joe E. Legend and Terry Taylor and debuted in 1997 at the age of 18 in the International Championship Wrestling promotion. He was initially known by the ring name "Muay Thai Kid", with a gimmick that saw him don red karate pants and shave off his hair and eyebrows, before switching to the name Tyson Dux. Dux was asked to participate in the East Coast Wrestling Association's 2004 Super 8 Tournament, a tournament highlighting prominent cruiserweights on the independent circuit. However, he was forced to pull out of the tournament on March 31, 2004 after tearing his anterior cruciate ligament while wrestling Mark Jindrak on an episode of Velocity. Dux went on to take part in the 2005 Super 8 Tournament on April 9, 2005, losing to J.J. Perez in the first round.

In other media

Dux has been featured in an episode of Kenny vs Spenny in which the two friends train to become the best professional wrestlers. Dux is assigned with training Spenny, who chooses the name "The Nice Guy", whereas Kenny chooses the name "Specimen Yarp". When the actual match occurs, Dux turns on Spenny, aiding Kenny and his trainer in a three-on-one assault. At the conclusion of the episode, Kenny is declared the winner because Spenny breaks character, and as his humiliation forces Spenny to strip naked and receive a beating from wrestling legend The Iron Sheik.
