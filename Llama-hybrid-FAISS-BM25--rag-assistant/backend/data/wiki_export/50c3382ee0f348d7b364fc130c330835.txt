The École nationale supérieure d'informatique et de mathématiques appliquées, or Ensimag, is a prestigious French Grande École located in Grenoble, France. Ensimag is part of the Institut polytechnique de Grenoble (Grenoble INP). The school is one of the top French engineering institutions and specializes in computer science, applied mathematics and telecommunications.

In the fields of computer science and applied mathematics, Ensimag ranks first in France, as measured by the position of its students in the national admission examinations and by the ranking of companies hiring its students and specialized media.

Students are usually admitted to Ensimag competitively following two years of undergraduate studies in classes préparatoires aux grandes écoles. Studies at Ensimag are of three years' duration and lead to the French degree of "Diplôme National d'Ingénieur" (equivalent to a master's degree).

Grenoble, in the French Alps, has always been a pioneer for high-tech engineering education in France. The first French school of electrical engineering has been created in Grenoble in 1900 (one of the first in the world after MIT). In 1960 the eminent French mathematician Jean Kuntzmann founded Ensimag. Since that time it has become the highest ranking French engineering school in computer science and applied mathematics.

About 250 students graduates from the school each year in its different degrees, and counts with more than 5500 alumni worldwide.

Ensimag Graduate specializations

Ensimag's curriculum offers a variety of compulsory and elective advanced courses, making up specific profiles.
Most of the common core courses are taught in the first year and the first semester of the second year, allowing students to acquire the basics in applied mathematics and informatics. 
Students then choose a graduate specialization.

Research at Ensimag
Ensimag students can perform research work as part of their curriculum in second year, as well as a second-year internship and their end of studies project in a research laboratory. 15% of Ensimag graduates choose to pursue a Ph.D.

Junior enterprise: Nsigma
Nsigma was founded on November 17, 1980 as a voluntary association under the name ENSIGMA PROGRAMMATION. This association obtained the label Junior-Entreprise ® in 1981 and managed to renew it every year since then. The Junior enterprise took advantage of the Ensimag reform in 2008 to update its status and title. Currently called Nsigma, it is now an information technology service provider.
