Airlines and destinations

Accidents and incidents
On February 2, 2001, a Piper PA-34 Seneca collided with a runway light and snowbank while attempting to land in Charlevoix. The pilot reported that, during the landing roll, the aircraft veered right  because there was too much aileron into the right crosswind. The pilot neutralized the controls, at which point the aircraft's left wing was lifted before the whole plane veered left, sliding over ice and into the snow bank. The probable cause was found to be that the pilot failed to maintain directional control of the airplane due to inadequate compensation for the wind conditions.
On June 24, 2011, a Beechcraft Bonanza crashed into a garage in Charlevoix while attempting to land at the airport. Authorities found the aircraft had stalled due to inadequate airspeed during an improper instrument approach procedure.
On September 13, 2019, a plane crash-landed at Charlevoix Municipal after having problems with its landing gear following a flight from Beaver Island. None of the nine aboard were injured.
