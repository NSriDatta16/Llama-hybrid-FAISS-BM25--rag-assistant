The 2008–09 IFA Interim Intermediate League was a temporary league in Northern Ireland for one season only, consisting of the former members of the IFA Intermediate League (dissolved in 2008) who did not meet the criteria for the new IFA Championship. Members of the Interim League had one year to make improvements in order to gain entry to the 2009–10 IFA Championship.

The title was won by Harland & Wolff Welders.

With the Championship expanding to two divisions the following season; Championship 1 and Championship 2, ten of the twelve members of the league succeeded in gaining entry to the 2009–10 IFA Championship 2, with only Oxford United Stars and Brantwood failing to do so, dropping out of national football.
