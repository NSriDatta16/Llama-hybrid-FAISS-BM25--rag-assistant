History

Establishment 
Castle Peak Hospital is the oldest extant psychiatric hospital in Hong Kong. It replaced the older  on Hong Kong Island as the main public inpatient hospital for the treatment of mental illness. Castle Peak Hospital was opened by the then-Governor Robert Black on 27 March 1961. The 1,000-bed hospital, occupying a  site, was spread over 10 buildings. Four two-storey blocks accommodated the patients, who were divided in two sections by gender. The hospital, designed by the Public Works Department to have an "open and pleasant" atmosphere, included teaching and residential facilities for psychiatric nursing students.

Redevelopment 
The hospital completed its redevelopment project in 2006. As the design and construction of the old hospital dated back to the 1950s, after nearly 40 years of heavy utilisation, redevelopment of the whole hospital to upgrade its facilities was necessary in order to keep the hospital functional, and the project commenced in 1992.

The redevelopment of the hospital was carried out in two phases. The Phase I project was funded by a donation of $500 million from the Hong Kong Jockey Club. The Phase II redevelopment, at an estimated cost of $1,470.8 million, was funded by the government. The modernised and improved facilities and environment facilitate treatment and rehabilitation of patients, and their re-integration into the community.
