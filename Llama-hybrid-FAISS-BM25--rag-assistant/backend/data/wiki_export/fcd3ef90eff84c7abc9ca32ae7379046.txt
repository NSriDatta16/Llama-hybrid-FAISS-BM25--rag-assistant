The Gempylidae are a family of perciform fishes commonly known as snake mackerels or escolars. The family includes about 25 species.

They are elongated fishes with a similar appearance to barracudas, having a long dorsal fin, usually with one or finlets trailing it. The largest species, including the snoek (Thyrsites atun), grow up to 2 m long, and the oilfish (Ruvettus pretiosus) can reach 3 m, though they rarely surpass 150Â cm. Like the barracudas, they are predators, with fang-like teeth.

They are deep-water benthopelagic fishes, and several species are important commercial and game fishes.
