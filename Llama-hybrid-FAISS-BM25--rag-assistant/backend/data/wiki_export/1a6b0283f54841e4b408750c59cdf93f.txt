The English Classic was a professional golf tournament which was played annually from 1979 to 1983. It was a fixture on the European Tour schedule, and hosted at The Belfry in Wishaw, Warwickshire, England.

Two of the five winners were major championship winners and World Number 1 golfers, namely the Australian Greg Norman and the Spaniard Seve Ballesteros. In 1983 the prize fund was Â£90,000, which was mid range for a European Tour event at that time.
