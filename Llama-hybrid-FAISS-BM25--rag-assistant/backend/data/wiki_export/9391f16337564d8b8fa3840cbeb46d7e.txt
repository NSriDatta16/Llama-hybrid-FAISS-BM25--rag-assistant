Doug Richardson is an American screenwriter and novelist who writes action movies and thrillers. He is best known for writing movies like Die Hard 2, Bad Boys, and Hostage and was the first Hollywood writer to sell a spec script for a million dollars.

Career
Richardson's first major Hollywood project was writing Die Hard 2, a commission he received from Larry Gordon just three weeks into the theatrical run of the original Die Hard film. He went on to write Bad Boys, adapting it from an existing screenplay by George Gallo. The film was set to be directed by Michael Bay, and became a final film starring Martin Lawrence and Will Smith.
