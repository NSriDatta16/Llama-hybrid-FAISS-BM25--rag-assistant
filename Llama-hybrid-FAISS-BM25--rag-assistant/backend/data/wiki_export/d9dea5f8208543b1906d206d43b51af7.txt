"Spin" is a 1995 documentary film by Brian Springer composed of raw satellite feeds featuring politicians' pre-appearance planning. It covers the presidential election as well as the 1992 Los Angeles riots and the Operation Rescue abortion protests.

The film also documents behind-the-scenes footage of Larry Agran who unsuccessfully sought the Democratic Party nomination for president. Agran was generally ignored by the media during his candidacy, a topic covered in the documentary. The media did not report his polling numbers, even as he met or exceeded the support of other candidates such as Jerry Brown. Party officials excluded him from most debates on various grounds, even having him arrested when he interrupted to ask to participate. When he managed to join the other candidates in any forum, his ideas went unreported. He was cropped out in photographs with other candidates.

Stephen Holden of The New York Times described the film as "a devastating critique of television's profound manipulativeness in the way it packages the news and politics". Spin is a follow-up of the 1992 film Feed, for which Springer provided much of the raw satellite footage.
