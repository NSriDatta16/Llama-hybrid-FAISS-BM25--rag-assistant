The paper backing is occasionally printed with games, jokes, or trivia facts. In the early 1990s, Fruit by the Foot came with stickers as a marketing prize. Children would often place these stickers on their lunch boxes to prove they had eaten Fruit by the Foot.

In early 1999, Nintendo and General Mills worked together on a promotional television advertising campaign costing $5 million. The advertisement by Saatchi began on January 25 with Fruit by the Foot snacks including tips on various Nintendo 64 games on the wax paper. Ninety different tips were available, with three variations of thirty tips each.
