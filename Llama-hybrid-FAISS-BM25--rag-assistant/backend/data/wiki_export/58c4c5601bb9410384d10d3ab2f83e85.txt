History
According to the resolution of the Soviet of People's Commissars of Azerbaijan from April 14, 1938, a two-year pedagogical institute named after Nadezhda Krupskaya was established in the city of Ganja, Azerbaijan. Due to a lack of space, the college was placed on the third floor of Gorky School. The first two departments of the institute were the Natural Sciences Department and the Department of Physics and Mathematics. Twenty-three teachers were hired to teach at the institute. The first class of 244 students started on October 1, 1938.
In 1939, the departments of History and Azerbaijani language and literature were established in the institute.
On September 1, 1943, the two-year college was abolished and a four-year Kirovobad (Ganja) State Pedagogical Institute was established on its basis. In the fall of 1943, the institute was named after a renowned scientist and publicist of Azerbaijan Hasan bey Zardabi.
