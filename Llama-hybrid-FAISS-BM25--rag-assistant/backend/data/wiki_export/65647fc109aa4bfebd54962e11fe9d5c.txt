The Netball at the 2006 Commonwealth Games was the third Commonwealth Games tournament. The preliminary matches were held at the State Netball and Hockey Centre with the finals being held at the multi-purpose Melbourne Park in the inner city.

Netball was among the most popular sports with viewers at this Games, with most tickets selling out in the initial ballot, and no more being available until a second release in the week before the Games - a rare event in a competition where many tickets remained unsold in the final week before the start of competition.
