Ashina Xichun, also known as Chuluo Khagan (Turkic: Çula Han, , Middle Chinese: (Guangyun) , died 620), was the khagan of the Eastern Turkic Khaganate, and second son of Yami Qaghan. He succeeded his elder brother Shibi and ruled for 18 months.

Reign 
Since Ashina Shibobi was still a minor, Ilteber shad () succeeded his elder brother as khagan, also creating him Nipu shad and appointing eastern territories to him. He terminated the campaign started by his brother after receiving a large tribute from Tang.

As part of the plan, he requested Dou to cross the Taihang Mountains and meet him at Jin (晉州, roughly modern Linfen, Shanxi) and Jiang (絳州, roughly modern Yuncheng, Shanxi) Prefectures.
