The channel launched in Canada on March 12, 2006, as Oasis HD, focusing on wildlife and nature programming, similar to its current format.

On December 21, 2011, High Fidelity HDTV announced that it had entered into an agreement to be purchased outright by Blue Ant Media. While initially purchasing 29.9% of the company, the remaining 70.1% would be purchased once it is approved by the CRTC.
