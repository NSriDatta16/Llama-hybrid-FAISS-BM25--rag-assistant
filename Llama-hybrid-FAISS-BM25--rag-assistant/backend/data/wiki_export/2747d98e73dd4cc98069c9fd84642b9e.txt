The men's rope climbing was one of eight gymnastics events on the Gymnastics at the 1896 Summer Olympics programme. The final event in the gymnastics competition, rope climbing was held on 10 April. The rope was 14 metres long, suspended from a frame. Time and style were considered in placing the competitors who reached the top and distance climbed separating those who did not make it all the way up. Five competitors entered, with the two Greeks taking top honors by being the only two to complete the climb. The German Fritz Hofmann won the bronze medal, while the weightlifting champions Viggo Jensen and Launceston Elliot finished fourth and fifth.

Background

This was the first appearance of the event, which was held four times. The event appeared again in 1904, 1924, and 1932.

Competition format

The rope climb was 14 metres in height with a smooth, unknotted rope. Those who completed the climb were ranked on time and style points, with those not reaching the top ranked on height climbed.

Schedule

The men's rope climbing was held in the morning of the fifth day of events. The gymnastics programme was intended to be completed on the fourth day, but after six of the eight events had finished it was too late to continue and the final two were moved to the fifth day. The rope climbing was the second of the two that day, the last gymnastics event held.
