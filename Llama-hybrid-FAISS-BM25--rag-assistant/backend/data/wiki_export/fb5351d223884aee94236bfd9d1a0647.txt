Kavtiskhevi kurgans
Near the village of Kavtiskhevi in Kaspi Municipality some very ancient kurgans have been found. They were excavated by Makharadze in 2007.

Materials recovered from these excavations can be related to remains from the metal-working Late Chalcolithic site  of Leilatepe on the Karabakh steppe. Also, at Soyuqbulaq, Agstafa, there are similar kurgans.

Also, the earliest level at the multi-period site of Berikldeebi in Kvemo Kartli is relevant. These discoveries reveal the presence of early 4th millennium kurgans in the southern Caucasus.
