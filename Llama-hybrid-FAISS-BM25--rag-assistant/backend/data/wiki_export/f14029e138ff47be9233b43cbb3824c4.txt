The Aquarium of Western Australia (AQWA) is a privately owned aquarium in Hillarys, Western Australia. Located approximately  north-west of Perth City, it is a popular attraction for tourists and locals alike.

AQWA was Australia's largest aquarium when it opened and still possesses Australia's largest single aquarium and underwater tunnel, the 3 million litre Shipwreck Coast exhibit.

History

The aquarium opened on 13 April 1988 as Underwater World, Perth. It was acquired by the current owners, Coral World International and Morris Kahn, in 1991, and changed its name to AQWA - The Aquarium of Western Australia on 1 January 2001.

AQWA (then Underwater World, Perth) opened with only a handful of aquariums, including the feature walk-through aquarium which has been listed as one of the largest aquariums in the world.

In 1992, following unsuccessful attempts by the defunct Atlantis Marine Park to rehabilitate three of its previously captive dolphins to the wild; a new sea pen was constructed at Underwater World to provide the dolphins a new home. They later died due to unknown causes (possibly stress) and in 1999 the sea pen was removed.

Today in 2023, AQWA houses over 45 unique displays which showcase only native Western Australian marine life and living corals, many of which are endemic to WA's waters.

Exhibits
The aquarium specializes in marine animals that inhabit the  long coastline of Western Australia. In total AQWA holds over  of water and is home to approximately 400 species of marine life.

AQWA is themed as an underwater journey along W.A.'s coastline and is broken up into distinct zones. These include:
the Great Southern, the Shipwreck Coast, the Perth Coast and the Far North. Each zone represents the unique marine life and habitats found along WA's expansive and varied coast.

The unequivocal highlight of AQWA is the main Shipwreck Coast aquarium. It is  long and  wide and holds  of flowing seawater. It incorporates a  underwater acrylic tunnel, the largest in Australia, with a motorised conveyor belt walkway.
