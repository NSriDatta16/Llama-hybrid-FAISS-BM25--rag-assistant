Thomas Y. Crowell Co. was a publishing company founded by Thomas Y. Crowell. The company began as a bookbindery founded by Benjamin Bradley in 1834. Crowell operated the business after Bradley's death in 1862 and eventually purchased the company from Bradley's widow in 1870.

History
The company began publishing books in 1876, and in 1882 T. Irving Crowell joined his father in the business. Jeremiah Osborne Crowell became the sales manager.

In 1909, after Thomas Y. Crowell died, T. Irving Crowell became the company's president. Then in 1937, after T. Irving Crowell retired, the third generation Robert L. Crowell took over and moved towards publishing trade books and biographies. They were sold to Dun & Bradstreet in 1968.

Crowell acquired the textbook publisher Intext in 1974, which also owned the trade publisher Abelard-Schuman.

In 1978, the company was sold to Harper & Row, which bought Lippincott and briefly combined the two as Lippincott & Crowell in 1979 before consolidating them into Harper & Row in 1980.

The Thomas Y. Crowell Publishers Records are housed in the Syracuse University Library's Special Collections Research Center. The records are composed mainly of correspondence with authors, agents, other publishing firms and interested persons.
