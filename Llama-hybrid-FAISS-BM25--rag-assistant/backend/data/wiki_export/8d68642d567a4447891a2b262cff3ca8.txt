History
The station became WSKZ in August 1978. The station was formerly co-owned with their nearby AM station WGOW during its early years, but by 1981 the station became a Top 40/CHR format. WSKZ is the only FM radio station in Chattanooga that broadcasts a fully-fledged Top 40/CHR station. Beginning in 1985, unlike most Top 40 stations, WSKZ began fledging into a similar "Rock-40" format lean (similar to KEGL in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex in Texas). Its "rock" formula was dropped when the format began adding more mainstream titles during the middle of 1987.

The station flipped back to "Rock 40" in connection to its competition against a "new" Top 40/CHR station WBDX in 1989. WSKZ continued its run as a Top 40/CHR station until 1994, when WSKZ decided to change to their current Classic Rock format.
