For One Night is a 2006 American made-for-TV drama film directed by Ernest Dickerson, written by Denetria Harris-Lawrence, and starring Raven-Symoné as Brianna McCallister and Aisha Tyler as Desiree Howard. The film's premise is based on the true story of Gerica McCrary, who made headlines in 2002 by getting Taylor County High School in her hometown of Butler, Georgia, to integrate the prom after thirty-one years of segregation.

Plot
Inspired by the true story of an African American teenager who shook up a small town where high school proms had been racially segregated for decades. Amid the protests of the community and with the help of a newspaper reporter who returns to her hometown to cover the story, the two women are able to reverse decades of racist tradition and make history, at least for one night.

Production
For One Night is based on events that occurred in Taylor County, Georgia in 2002. It was filmed in the summer of 2005 in Jefferson, Louisiana shortly before Hurricane Katrina. This film is the first drama role in the career of Raven-Symoné and disengaged from the Disney Channel. In an interview with the film director, Raven-Symoné said that she had to gain weight for the lead role, along with getting a Southern accent.
