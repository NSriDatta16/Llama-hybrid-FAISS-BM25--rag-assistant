Professional career

New York Jets

Clemens was selected by the New York Jets in the second round of the 2006 NFL Draft, the 49th overall pick, to serve as the secondary quarterback to Chad Pennington. A healthy Pennington resulted in little playing time for Clemens in 2006. He made his NFL debut in relief appearance against the Jacksonville Jaguars, recording his first career pass attempt and rushing once for two yards in the 41–0 loss. He entered in a Week 14 31–13 loss to the Buffalo Bills, rushed once for eight yards but did not attempt a pass. He recorded only two attempts and 0 completions in his rookie season.

Due to an injury to Pennington in the Jets's 2007 season opener against the New England Patriots, Clemens recorded his first completed pass in the NFL with a final record for the day of five complete passes on ten attempts in the 38–14 loss. Clemens made his first career start in Week 2 of the 2007 season. His effectiveness was minimized by the Ravens's defense for the first three quarters, with the Jets trailing 20–3 at one point. However, in the fourth quarter, Clemens led the Jets on a scoring drive that cut Baltimore's lead to 20–13. On the last drive, he attempted what would have been a game-tying touchdown pass to Jets wide receiver Justin McCareins, but the pass was dropped by McCareins and intercepted by the Ravens' Ray Lewis.

His next appearance came in week 8 against the Buffalo Bills. A struggling Pennington was pulled by head coach Eric Mangini in the middle of the fourth quarter and replaced by Clemens. Clemens led two drives against the Buffalo defense. Down 13–3 and pressed for time, Clemens attempted to quickly move the Jets offense down the field but was intercepted twice. The following day, on October 29, 2007, Clemens was named the starting quarterback for the next game against the Washington Redskins. In the 23–20 loss, he had 226 passing yards and a passing touchdown. He finished the 2007 season with 1,529 passing yards, five passing touchdowns, and ten interceptions in 11 games.

In 2008, Clemens was only on the field in two games to attempt five passes as the backup to Brett Favre. When Mike Nugent, the Jets's kicker, injured his thigh in the September 7 game against the Miami Dolphins, Clemens filled in as the team's placekicker, but was not called upon to kick.

On August 26, 2009, Jet's head coach Rex Ryan announced that Mark Sanchez would be the starting quarterback for the 2009 season, a position left vacant after Brett Favre was released from the Jets in February.  On December 3, Clemens was forced to come in against the Buffalo Bills after Mark Sanchez sprained his PCL. Clemens started the Jets's next game against the 1-11 Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Despite an unexceptional personal performance by Clemens, the Jets were still able to pick up an important 26–3 victory.

Clemens threw for 125 yards with no touchdowns in 2009 and played mostly when Mark Sanchez was injured. He was re-signed to a one-year contract for the 2010 season on April 13, but the only action he saw was in the Week 17 game against the Buffalo Bills.

St. Louis Rams
The St. Louis Rams claimed Clemens off of waivers from Houston on December 7. 2011.

After an ankle sprain sidelined starting quarterback Sam Bradford and with backup A. J. Feeley out with a thumb injury, Clemens started on December 18 against the Cincinnati Bengals. With only 11 days to get familiar with the team and the offense, Clemens passed for 229 yards completing 25-of-36 passes. In that game, he completed a 25-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Danario Alexander, his first NFL touchdown pass since Week 17 of the 2007 season with the Jets, but the Bengals won by a score of 20–13. Clemens started the final two games for the Rams, both losses to the Steelers and rival 49ers. He finished the 2011 season with two touchdown passes and one rushing touchdown, and was re-signed by the Rams.

In the 2012 season, Clemens only saw action in two games against the New England Patriots and Arizona Cardinals. He completed one pass for 39 yards and had two rushes for five yards.

After Bradford went down with a season-ending injury in Week 7 in 2013, Clemens started the final nine games, going 4-5 as the Rams' starter and finished with 1,673 yards, eight touchdowns, and seven interceptions.

San Diego / Los Angeles Chargers

Clemens signed a two-year contract with the San Diego Chargers on March 13, 2014. In the 2014 season, he only appeared in two games and completed one pass for 10 yards.
