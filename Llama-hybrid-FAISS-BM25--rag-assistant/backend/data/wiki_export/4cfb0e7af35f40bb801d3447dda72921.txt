Events

April 15 – On Opening Day, Red Ames of the New York Giants allowed no hits through nine innings. In the 10th inning he gave up a single with one out. The Giants eventually fell to the Brooklyn Superbas, 3–0, in 13 innings. In total, Ames allowed a total of seven hits.
May 10 – Fred Toney pitches a 17-inning no-hitter for the Winchester Hustlers of the Blue Grass League. Toney has 19 strikeouts and 1 walk in the 1-0 victory. In 1917, Toney will pitch a 10-inning no-hitter in the major leagues.

July 15 - The Brooklyn Superbas purchase the contract of outfielder Zach Wheat from Mobile of the Southern Association. 
July 19 – In the second inning of the first game of a doubleheader, Cleveland Naps shortstop Neal Ball becomes the first player in Major League Baseball history to turn an undisputed unassisted triple play. With two men on base, Neal caught a line drive hit by Amby McConnell, then gets Heinie Wagner at second base, and later tagged Jake Stahl to complete the feat. Cleveland defeated the Boston Red Sox, 6–1, while Cy Young was credited as the winning pitcher.

November 26 – The Philadelphia Phillies are sold for $350,000 to a group headed by sportswriter Horace Fogel. Because of his dual roles, Fogel will become the only executive barred from a league meeting.
