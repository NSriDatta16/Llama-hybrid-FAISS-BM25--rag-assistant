Alvina is an English female given name with the meaning "elf friend", "amicable", "friendly". In English it is the feminine form of Alvin, which comes from the Old English name Ælfwine, containing the words ælf meaning "elf" and wine meaning "friend", or from the Old High German name Adelwin / Adalwin, meaning Noble Friend.

It is an uncommon name, first attested in mediaeval English records, and was revived in the 20th century. Popularity waned after 1939, and now less than 0.001% of the British population is named Alvina. Diminutives of this name include Alveena, Alvi, Alvy and Alwy.
