The 141st Reserve Division (Kommandeur der Ersatztruppen I and temporarily the 151st Division and Division Nr. 141), was a German infantry division during World War II .

History 
The Division was formed on 26 August 1939, as Kommandeur der Ersatztruppen I (Commander of Replacement Troops I) in Insterburg. On 13 November 1939, it was temporarily renamed as the 151st Division and then Division Nr. 141, on 8 December 1939. In September 1940 it was relocated to Prague, Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. When the German campaign in the East began, on 15 July 1941, the division was returned to Insterburg, Germany and the Wehrkreis I (Corps Area I). In 1942, Division Nr. 141 was redesigned as the 141st Reserve Division and it kept that name until 19 February 1944, when it was disbanded. Some of its men were transferred to reinforce the 68th Infantry Division.
