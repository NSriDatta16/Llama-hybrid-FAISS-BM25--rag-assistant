Mutiny Up My Sleeve was the third album by Canadian rock band Max Webster. The record was released in 1978 in Canada by Anthem Records and in the United States and Europe by Capitol Records. The album was certified gold by the Canadian Recording Industry Association. 

Recording sessions began in late 1977 at Sounds Interchange with Terry Brown as co-producer, and resumed at Phase One Studios in early 1978 with bassist, Mike Tilka stepping in after Brown quit. The intro of "The Party" was recorded live at the Seneca College Field House in Toronto, Ontario on December 31, 1977, which was also Tilka's last gig with the band before being replaced by Dave Myles.

In 1988 when the band's back catalog was re-released on CD, the original album cover was amended to include the phrase "Featuring Kim Mitchell" to capitalize on the success of Mitchell's post-Max Webster solo career.
