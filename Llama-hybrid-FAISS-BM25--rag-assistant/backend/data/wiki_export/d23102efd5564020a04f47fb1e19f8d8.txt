10 Song Demo is an album by the American musician Rosanne Cash. Released in 1996, it was her first album for Capitol Records. The album's first single, "The Summer I Read Collette", is a tribute to French novelist Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette. Its second and final single, "Western Wall", was covered by Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt on Western Wall: The Tucson Sessions.

Critical reception

No Depression wrote that "her voice and person completely dominate, and even when the literary lyrics border on being sappy or overly articulate, the sheer force of Cash’s persona makes it work." Entertainment Weekly determined that "unlike, say, Bruce Springsteen, she knows that bare-bones doesn’t mean tuneless ... Demo's spare arrangements reinforce the sturdiness of her melodies."
