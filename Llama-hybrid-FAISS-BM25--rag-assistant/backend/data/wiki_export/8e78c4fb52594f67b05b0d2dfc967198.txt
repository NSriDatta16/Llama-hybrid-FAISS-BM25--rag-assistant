Street Hockey '95 is a roller hockey video game for the Super NES released in 1994 to an exclusively North American market.

This video game takes place in an urban environment. Instead of ice, the players play on cement and instead of ice skates, they use rollerblades. Players assemble their squads from nine hockey players who are savvy in the ways of the street. There are six different kinds of urban arenas and five different variations on the "traditional" road hockey game.

Street Hockey '95 uses more than two thousand frames of digitized animation, making it relatively advanced for its era.

Reception
GamePro praised the game's variety of options and trash talking voices, but criticized the music and the controls, elaborating that "Jerky player movements and slow reactions to the button presses can be frustrating and might cause you to spend too much time on defense." They nonetheless concluded the game to be "a decent walk on hockey's wild side."
