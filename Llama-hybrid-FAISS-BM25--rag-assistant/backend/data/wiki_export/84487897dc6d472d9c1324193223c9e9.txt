Game summary
World Bowl XII began with the Galaxy getting the ball first, yet four plays and one "Delay of Game" penalty later, QB J. T. O'Sullivan tried to pass to RB Skip Hicks and his pass got intercepted by Berlin DT Montique Sharpe, who returned the ball 28 yards for a touchdown.  The Galaxy would then start their second drive at their own 25-yard line.  Despite going 66 yards on 11 plays, the Thunder defense forced the Galaxy to settle for a 28-yard field goal by Ralf Kleinmann.  In the second quarter, both teams prevented each other from scoring for most of the period.  It wasn't until the final two minutes of the half that the scoring would continue, with J. T. O'Sullivan leading a 5-play, 55-yard drive and capping it off with an 8-yard TD pass to WR Derrick Lewis.  With less than a minute to go in the half, Thunder QB Rohan Davey got a 7-play, 51-yard drive going, yet Frankfurt's defense forced Berlin to settle for a 38-yard field goal by Jonathan Ruffin, which gave the Berlin Thunder a 10–7 halftime lead.  In the third quarter, one play was all that was needed on their second drive of the half, as a little trick play helped QB Rohan Davey get the ball to WR Richard Alston, who in turn completed a 60-yard TD pass to fellow WR Chas Gessner.  The Thunder would later continue to pour on their lead, as Ruffin kicked a 42-yard field goal to give the Thunder a 23–10 lead going into the fourth quarter.  In the fourth quarter, the Thunder got their final points of the game, as MVP RB Eric McCoo ran 69 yards for a touchdown.  With the Galaxy trailing 30–10 with under six minutes to play, they needed points and they needed them fast.  They would respond as O'Sullivan lead a 5-play, 64-yard drive and wrap it up with a 17-yard TD pass to WR Drew Haddad.  On their next drive, O'Sullivan would throw a 19-yard pass to Derrick Lewis.  Unfortunately, it was too little, too late as the Thunder would wind the game clock to zero and clinch their third World Bowl title in four years.
