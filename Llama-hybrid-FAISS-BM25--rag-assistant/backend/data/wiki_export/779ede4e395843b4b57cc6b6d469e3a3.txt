Minor Hockey

It is believed that Jones is the only player to play Jr.C. level hockey in Ontario at age 18 and eventually crack the National Hockey League. Two others, Hunter Drew (Anaheim) and Ryan Jones (no relation - Edmonton) played Jr.C. at 17 and eventually cracked the NHL. Jones played Midget at 16, Jr.C. at 17 and 18 and then Jr.B. at age 19.
