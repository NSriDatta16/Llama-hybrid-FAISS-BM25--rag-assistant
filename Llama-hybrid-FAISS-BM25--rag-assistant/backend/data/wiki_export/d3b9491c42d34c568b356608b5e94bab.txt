History
Knox Atoll was claimed by the German Empire along with the rest of the Marshall Islands in 1885. After World War I, the island came under the South Seas Mandate of the Empire of Japan. Following the end of World War II, it came under the control of the United States as part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands until the independence of the Marshall Islands in 1986.

Typhoon
On 30 June 1905 the atoll of Nadikdik was completely washed over by a huge typhoon that stripped the atoll down to the bare coral.  Almost all of the some 60 inhabitants perished, save by two boys who survived a 24-hour drift voyage clinging on a breadfruit tree. In the century since then, the islands have largely regenerated.
