The Italian government had refused to allow his extradition, since the crime took place five months before Italy had entered into an international extradition treaty and because of its own law prohibiting extradition for any crime where the death penalty was applicable.

Beginning with 1971, a three-day Memorial Day Weekend became an annual observance within the U.S. federal government and by nearly all of the U.S. states, as the scheduled Memorial Day was fixed permanently for federal agencies as the last Monday in May, pursuant to the Uniform Monday Holiday Act, Public Law 90-363.  From 1868 to 1970, Memorial Day (formerly "Decoration Day") had been observed on May 30, regardless of what day of the week it fell upon.
The government of South Vietnam announced that it had compiled a list of 660 "sick or wounded" prisoners of war for repatriation to North Vietnam, pursuant to an agreement between the two warring nations, but that 647 of the 660 informed the Saigon government that they didn't want to go back to the north. At the time, the U.S. had a list of 339 Americans known to be prisoners of war in the north and had seen the repatriation of the North Vietnamese as a first step in securing the release of the U.S. POWs.  The 13 who did agree to go boarded the transport ship USS Upshur on June 3, but were told by the Hanoi government that they could not come back to North Vietnam.
