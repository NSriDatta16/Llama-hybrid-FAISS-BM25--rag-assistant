Fictional character biography

Shannon Carter is the niece of S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Sharon Carter. She grew up idolizing Captain America. She is hired by Edwin Jarvis as a tour guide for the Avengers Headquarters, at the time functioning only as a museum. When the new Avengers team is formed, she is determined to join. She wears a costume based on Captain America's and carries on her arms disc weapons resembling miniature versions of his shield. Her strength and agility are honed by intensive physical training. After joining the team as the American Dream, Shannon soon proves herself to be an effective Avenger, and when the team saves the original Avengers from a dark parallel world, Captain America himself judges her worthy to wield the shield of the alternate Captain. She also proves to be an important character in defeating Galactus in the Last Planet Standing limited series. She, along with Stinger and Spider-Girl, take down Galactus from the inside. They survive the imminent explosion by shrinking to microscopic size.

Carter is the leader of the "Dream Team", consisting of herself, Bluestreak, Crimson Curse and Freebooter. All members of the Dream Team become members of the new Avengers team in A-Next #4. American Dream is also an ally of Spider-Girl, Earth Sentry, Blacklight, Coal Tiger, Argo and Captain America.

American Dream has fought against the Sons of the Serpent, Seth, the Revengers, Fatal Force and Loki. When Superia launches a cross-temporal attack to eliminate Steve Rogers' post-war career as Captain America and take his place herself, American Dream is one of five heirs to Rogers' legacy that were assembled by the Contemplator to thwart her plans, the others being Rogers early in his career, John Walker shortly after his own time as Cap, Bucky during his time as Captain America, and Commander A from the twenty-fifth century. She receives an invitation to join the newly established Avengers squad. She has designed a suit, made disc weapons that resembled miniaturized copies of Captain America's shield, and engaged in extensive physical training to become the strongest and most agile person on the planet.
