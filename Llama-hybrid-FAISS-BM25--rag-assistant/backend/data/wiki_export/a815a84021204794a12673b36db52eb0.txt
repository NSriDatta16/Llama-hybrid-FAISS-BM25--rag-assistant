California's 13th congressional district is a congressional district in the U.S. state of California. John Duarte, a Republican, has represented this district since January 2023.

The 13th district no longer consists of the northwestern portion of Alameda County.  Cities in the former 13th district included Alameda, Albany, Berkeley, Emeryville, Oakland, Piedmont, and San Leandro. 

In the 2022 redistricting cycle, the district was moved to the San Joaquin Valley, while the old 13th district was renumbered as the 12th. The new 13th district includes all of Merced County; most of the population of Madera County; and parts of Stanislaus, Fresno, and San Joaquin Counties. It includes the cities of Merced, Madera, Ceres, Patterson, Lathrop, Chowchilla, Atwater, Coalinga, and Mendota; as well as the southern parts of both Modesto and Turlock. The new 13th district is considered a Democratic-leaning swing district. Despite that, Duarte was narrowly elected to represent it in 2022. As a result, it was one of 18 districts that would have voted for Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election had they existed in their current configuration while being won or held by a Republican in 2022.
