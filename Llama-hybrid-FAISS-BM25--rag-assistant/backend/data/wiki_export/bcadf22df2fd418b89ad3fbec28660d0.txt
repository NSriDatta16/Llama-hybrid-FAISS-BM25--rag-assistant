The Beaumont Stakes is a Grade II American Thoroughbred horse race for three-year-old fillies over a distance of 7 furlongs and 184 feet on the dirt held annually in early April at Keeneland Race Course, Lexington, Kentucky during the spring meeting.

History

The race is named in honor of the Beaumont Farm of Hal Price Headley, one of Keeneland's founders. The Beaumont is run on the Beard Course which is named after Major Louie Beard, another one of Keeneland's founders.

The event was inaugurated on 5 April 1986 and was won by Classy Cathy, trained by the former jockey Joseph M. Bollero in a time of .

The event was classified as Grade III in 1990 when it was won by the ill-fated 1989 US Champion Two-Year-Old, Go For Wand. In 1993 the event was upgraded to Grade II and held that class until 2016 when it was downgraded back to Grade III.

In 2023 the American Graded Stakes Committee upgraded the event to Grade II status.
