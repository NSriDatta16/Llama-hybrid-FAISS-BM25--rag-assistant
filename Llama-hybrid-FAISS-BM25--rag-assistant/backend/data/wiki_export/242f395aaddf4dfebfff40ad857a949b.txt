Daniela Bártová-Břečková () (born 6 May 1974) is a retired Czech athlete. She was born in Ostrava. Originally a gymnast, her coach persuaded her to be a pole vaulter. She set nine world records in the mid-1990s, but she lost it on 4 November 1995 to Sun Caiyun and was unable to recapture it. Her personal best is 4.51 m (Bratislava, Slovakia, 9 June 1998).

Despite her success she only won one international medal, a silver medal at the 1998 European Indoor Championships.

As a gymnast, she represented the Czech Republic at the 1991 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships, placing 33rd in the all-around event, also took part in the all-around team event at the 1992 Summer Olympics.

Bártová is married to flatwater canoer Jan Břečka.
