History
The station was built as a private station for Duncraig Castle by the Kyle of Lochalsh Extension (Highland Railway), opening on 2 November 1897.

It became a public station in 1949. Duncraig was closed between 7 December 1964 and 5 January 1976; it was reopened after local train drivers refused to acknowledge the station's closure for the intervening 11 years. One of the drivers is quoted as saying:"We thought that if the English wanted to close a railway station they should pick on Euston or King's Cross"The station is a Category B listed building.

Facilities 

The only facilities at the station are a small waiting room, a bench and a help point. The station, however, has step-free access. As there are no facilities to purchase tickets, passengers must buy one in advance, or from the guard on the train.

Services 

Four trains each way call (on request) on weekdays and Saturdays. On Sundays, there is only one train each way, plus a second from May to late September only.
