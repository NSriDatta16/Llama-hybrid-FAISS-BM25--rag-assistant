Muhammad Ali Jinnah Road (), frequently abbreviated as MA Jinnah Road, is a major thoroughfare in central Karachi, Pakistan. The road was originally named Bandar Road ( ;"Port Road"), owing to the fact that it linked the city to the Port of Karachi, but was later renamed in honour of Pakistan's founder, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. MA Jinnah Road stretches 6.1 kilometres from Jinnah Bridge in the south, near the Port of Karachi, to Gurumandir Chowk, north of Mazar-e-Quaid. It is one of the city's oldest roads, and passes through much of the colonial era historic core of Karachi, with numerous landmarks along its route.

History 
During Talpur rule, the Rah-i-Bandar road was built to connect the city's port to the caravan terminals in what is now the Serai Quarter. The Rah-i-Bandar in the 1860s would eventually be further developed by the British into Bandar Road. In 1949, the road was renamed after Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan.
