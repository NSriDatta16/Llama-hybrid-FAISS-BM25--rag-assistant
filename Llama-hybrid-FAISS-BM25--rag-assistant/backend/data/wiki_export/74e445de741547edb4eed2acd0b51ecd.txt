Scholastica is a private English medium school in Dhaka, Bangladesh, offering pre-school to A level courses. It was founded in 1977 by businesswoman and former advisor to the government, Yasmeen Murshed.

GCE AS  Level and the GCE A Level qualifications. 
It is prominently recognised as one of the elite schools of Bangladesh, boasting a strong alumni network.

History
Scholastica was founded  in 1977, in an effort to meet the demands for schools having English as the medium of instruction, but emphasising equal proficiency in Bengali. At the time of its founding, the school comprised a single campus for junior-level students (grades PG to Class 2) in Gulshan. Since then, the school has expanded to six campuses: four for junior-level students, and two senior-level campuses, both of which, the Mirpur and Uttara campuses are now considered the school's main campus.

Curriculum
Scholastica offers a complete primary, elementary, secondary and high school program leading to the General Certificate of Education examinations which are conducted by the British Council in Dhaka.

Since the 2008â€“09 academic session, the school's O and A Level examinations have been administered by Cambridge Assessment International Education, replacing the Edexcel system of schooling.

Laboratory
Laboratory facilities are provided for all the science classes. The senior laboratories are inspected and approved by the representatives of the University of London to meet its standard for the practical requirement of the 'O' and 'A' Level examinations.

Extra-curricular activities
Scholastica extra-curricular activities include drama, debating and public speaking. The school also offers a large number of both teacher and student run clubs. School teams participate in inter-school and national competitions. Theatrical presentations are performed in English and Bengali, and it is well known for its annual dramas. Several after-school programs are offered beginning in middle school.

The school is also famous for its renowned Model United Nations conferences, known as "SCHOMUN" in its Uttara Branch and "SMUN" in its Mirpur Branch. The school is also known for hosting the Scholastica Business Summit or "SBS."
