Local attractions
The most popular festival held in Niyodogawa is the Akiba Matsuri, held annually on February 11. A day long procession up a hillside to the Akiba Jinja, it features elaborate costumes, a highly choreographed march and focuses on the tossing of long wooden poles topped with the tail feathers of Onagadori, the famous long tailed roosters of Kōchi Prefecture. Often designated as one of the three major festivals in the Kōchi festival calendar, it is the one occasion where many former residents of the town return to participate, particularly important for a small town ravaged by depopulation.

Niyodogawa has two popular nature spots, Nakatsu Gorge and Yasui Valley. Nakatsu Gorge has a walking path to Uryu Falls. It has more dramatic views of the rock walls that make up the gorge. It has also become a spot for canyoning. There is a public hot bath at a small hotel called Yunomori. Yasui Valley has more waterfalls to explore. It also has some cottages to rent. Tourists come to Yasui Valley to see "Niyodo Blue," an iridescent blue color that is best observed when the sun hits the river at a low angle. Another spot to see "Niyodo Blue" is at Nikobuchi Falls in neighboring Ino Town.
