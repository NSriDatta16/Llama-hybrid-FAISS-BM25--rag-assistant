"Forever" is a song by American rock band the Beach Boys from their 1970 album Sunflower. It was written by Dennis Wilson and Gregg Jakobson. Dennis sang lead vocal. His brother Brian assisted with the arrangement.

Reception
Brian Wilson declared of the song, "'Forever' has to be the most harmonically beautiful thing I've ever heard. It's a rock and roll prayer." AllMusic reviewer Matthew Greenwalk wrote,

Other releases
 In 1972, American Spring, a duo consisting of Brian Wilson's then-wife Marilyn and her sister Diane Rovell released a version on their sole album, produced by Wilson.
 In 2003, an a cappella version of the song was included on the Beach Boys' compilation Hawthorne, CA.
 In 2021, session highlights, instrumental, and a cappella versions were included on the band's box set Feel Flows.

John Stamos version
A newly recorded version of the song, featuring lead vocals from actor and Beach Boys sideman John Stamos, appeared on the band's 1992 album Summer in Paradise. Stamos performed the song on at least three episodes of his sitcom Full House (one of them during his character's 1991 wedding). On the first episode of Fuller House in 2016, "Forever" was once again performed by Jesse and the Rippers with other characters from the show singing as well.
