Early life
He was born in Braymer, Missouri, graduated from Northeast High School in Kansas City, Missouri and Central Missouri State University in Warrensburg, Missouri. He was a member of Sigma Tau Gamma fraternity. He started his newspaper career at The Daily Star-Journal in Warrensburg and rose to be its editor.  He went on to be editor of the Jefferson City News-Tribune.  He purchased weekly newspapers Windsor, Missouri Review and then the Lamar, Missouri Democrat.  Governor Forrest Smith asked him to write speeches for him.  In 1960 he was defeated by Warren Hearnes in his first bid for Missouri Secretary of State.  He won his first term in 1964.

Career
A member of the Democratic Party, he served as Missouri's Secretary of State from 1965 to 1985, establishing the current Missouri record for tenure of an elected state constitutional officer.

Kirkpatrick was a publisher by trade; the Northwest Missouri Press Association gives an annual award bearing his name.

Legacy
Numerous public facilities in Missouri have been named in Kirkpatrick's honor.  Senate Concurrent Resolution 36, passed in 1998, renamed Missouri's State Information Center the James C. Kirkpatrick Information Center.  The main library at the University of Central Missouri in Warrensburg, Missouri, is named the James C. Kirkpatrick Library. A replica of his capital office, located previously in the former Ward Edwards Library, can be found on the second floor, and a collection of his public and private papers is held in their Special Collections.
