The Daily Gamecock (formerly The Gamecock) is the editorially independent student news organization of the University of South Carolina. It primarily serves the main campus of the University of South Carolina System in the state of South Carolina.

History

The first issue of The Gamecock was published on January 30, 1908. Robert Gonzales, a student, was primarily responsible for the paper's establishment.

In its first semester only three issues were produced, but in the following term the paper began weekly production. The paper eventually moved to publication on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and in the fall semester of 2006 began publishing Monday through Friday publication. At this time, it was renamed The Daily Gamecock and became the first student paper in South Carolina to publish daily. In the Fall of 2014 the paper ended Friday production, producing instead a tabloid-format known as Weekender. In the Fall of 2016 the paper moved two a twice-weekly production, Mondays and Thursdays, citing declining paper readership but increased digital readership. In fall 2018, the news organization's print edition moved to a once-weekly production with a circulation of 7,000.

On January 30, 2008, the newspaper completed 100 years of operation, which it marked with prizes, a special letterhead, historical headlines, and an alumni ball celebrated the milestone.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the newspaper stopped publishing weekly print editions and moved almost entirely online in March 2020. Themed print editions now release once or twice a semester.
