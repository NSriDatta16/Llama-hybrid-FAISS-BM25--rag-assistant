The Pennsylvania High School Speech League is a high school forensics league. The PHSSL state championship takes place yearly in March at Bloomsburg University. Each qualifying event contains 2 qualifiers from each district throughout Pennsylvania, and the non-qualifying events have one student from each participating school.

History of PHSSL 

PHSSL was founded in 1961, by Dr. Robert E. Dunham, to promote speaking throughout the entire state of Pennsylvania at Penn State University. The actual championship took place at Susquehanna University from 1992 through 2016. The PA High School Speech League moved to Bloomsburg University in June, 2016. The championship has always been considered the "state championship" in Pennsylvania by allowing all schools to compete regardless of state affiliation.

Publications

The Pennsylvania High School Speech League publishes its own newsletter which is titled "The Communicator". PHSSL uses "The Communicator" to put forth information regarding leadership in the organization, plans, and records of student performance in the state championship.
