Elzo Aloísio Coelho (born 22 January 1961), better known as Elzo, is a retired Brazilian footballer who played for the national team, a number of Brazilian clubs and Portuguese Benfica.

Playing career
At the 1986 Mexico World Cup, he played an active role as a main regular for Brazil's volunteers in all five matches, alongside Carecca, Socrates and Zico. In the group league, they won against Spain (1-0), Algeria (1-0), and Northern Ireland (3-0○), and defeated the Poland national team 4-0 in the best 16. In the quarterfinals, they played against the France national team led by Platini, but entered the penalty shootout with a score of 1-1 and lost in the best eight.
In 1987-88-89 he moved to Benfica in Portugal. At that time, Portugal's legendary black panther, Coach Eusebio, evaluated as highly Euzo's defensive ability and joined the team. From the first year after joining the team, he became a regular volunteer, won the Portuguese league and advanced to the final of the European Champions Cup (currently the European Champions League), and made a full appearance in Stuttgart, Germany, before 75,000 spectators. Unfortunately, they lost to PSV Eindhoven, led by Hiddink, in a 0-0 penalty shootout, ending up in second place.
