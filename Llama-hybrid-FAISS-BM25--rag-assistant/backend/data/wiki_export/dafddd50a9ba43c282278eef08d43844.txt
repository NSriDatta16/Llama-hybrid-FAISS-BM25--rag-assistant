Area code 254 is a telephone area code in the North American Numbering Plan for the Waco/Temple/Killeen area in the U.S. state of Texas. It was created May 25, 1997, in an area code split of area code 817.

Despite having only a single area code, even local calls in the numbering plan area require ten-digit dialing, because prior to October 2021, area code 254 had telephone numbers assigned for the central office code 988. In 2020, 988 was designated nationwide as a dialing code for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which created a conflict for exchanges that permit seven-digit dialing. This area code was therefore transitioned to ten-digit dialing by October 24, 2021.
