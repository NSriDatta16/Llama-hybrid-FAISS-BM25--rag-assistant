Sulzbach-Rosenberg () is a municipality in the Amberg-Sulzbach district, in Bavaria, Germany. It is situated approximately 14 km northwest of Amberg, and 50 km east of Nuremberg. The town consists of two parts: Sulzbach in the west, and Rosenberg in the east.

Archeological evidence tells that Sulzbach was an important centre from the 8th century on. Sulzbach castle was founded during the early 8th century, probably by the late-Merovingian/early-Carolingian kingdom.

The castle was the residence of the powerful counts of the Nordgau (9th–10th century), the important counts of Sulzbach (c. 1003 – 1188) — one of whose daughters, Bertha of Sulzbach became the Empress of Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Comnenus — and later of the counts of Hirschberg (1188–1305), the counts of Wittelsbach (1305–1354, 1373–1504), emperor Karl IV (1354–1373), the palatine-dukes of Neuburg and of the dukes of Palatinate-Sulzbach (17th–18th century) of the House of Wittelsbach.

Since 2005, Sulzbach has hosted the Sulzbach-Rosenberg International Music Festival (known as the InterHarmony International Music Festival in other locations). It is one of several locations that hosts the InterHarmony international Music Festival, first conceptualized in 1997.
