To the east, the R501 goes to Templemore with fine views of the Devil's Bit mountain on the left hand side near Drom and Barnane. Borrisoleigh is 20 km south-east of Nenagh, 13 km north-west of

History
Borrisoleigh derives its name from the ancient territory of Uí Luighdheach in which it was situated. An annual cattle fair was held here every 27 November until the 1960s.

The first recorded settlement here was an abbey established by St. Cualan at Glean Caoin, anglicised as "Glankeen Abbey."  Kilcuilan (St. Cualan's Church) was dedicated to him at a nearby holy well.  A bell attributed to this saint, known as the "Bearnan Culan" or "Glankeen Bell" is now housed at the British Museum in London.  A replica may be seen in the sanctuary of the parish church in Borrisoleigh.

After the Norman invasion of Ireland in the 12th century, the O'Dwyer and DeBurgo clans established a fortress on the River Camoge as a defence against the native settlement at Ileigh.  Its ruins may still be seen as you leave Borrisoleigh on the Templemore Road.

In October 1846, absentee landlord Lord Portarlington threw a banquet at the Temperance Hall in Borrisoleigh while the surrounding parish was suffering through the Great Famine.   He left a meager one hundred pound donation to the local Poor Relief Committee when he returned to England.

Catholic church
The parish priest Michael Slattery was appointed as Archdiocese of Cashel and Emly in 1833. Slattery was succeeded by Father William Morris, who led 118 local men in signing the Cormack Petition in 1858.  This document provides a vital snapshot of the town's population, including its largest families (in this order): Ryan, Bourke, Kennedy, Dwyer, Maher, Gleeson, Harrington, and Patterson.  It also shows the top 10 male given names were: John, James, Patrick, William, Michael, Daniel, Martin, Philip, Thomas, Edmond (tie), and Jeremiah (tie).

Borrisoleigh has produced two well-known Catholic bishops: Joseph Shanahan (1871–1943) and Thomas Quinlan (1896–1970).

Church of Ireland
In 1785, a parish church for the Church of Ireland parish of Glenkeen was built in Borrisoleigh, on the site where St. Brigid's Cemetery is today. The glebe-house, which had a glebe of , was in the townland of Glenkeen. When the parish church was closed, the glebe house was sold in 1870.

Amenities
Among its attractions are some traditional shop fronts, and a 15th-century tower house. An inscribed slab inserted into the gable of one of a pair of red sandstone houses are engraved the names Richard Burke and Ellis Hurley, 1643. Walter Doolin was the architect of the church in the main street. The window and door surrounds were quarried at Drombane,  away. It is similar to the stone used in Cormac's Chapel, Cashel.
