The Faculty of Arts is one of six faculties at the University of Waterloo in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.

Departments
The faculty presently houses sixteen academic departments, the School of Accounting and Finance and the Stratford School of Interaction Design and Business.

Academic Departments:
Anthropology, Classical Studies, Drama and Speech Communication, Economics, English Language and Literature, Fine Arts, French Studies, Germanic and Slavic Studies, History, Independent Studies, Philosophy, Political Science, Psychology, Religious Studies, Social Development Studies, Sociology, Spanish and Latin American Studies.

The Faculty of Arts offers seven undergraduate entry programs, over thirty majors and more than 400 degree options.

The University of Waterloo, along with University of Guelph and Wilfrid Laurier University is a member of the Tri-University Graduate History Program, which combines the history departments of the three universities at the graduate level. Graduate students are registered at one of the three universities according to their supervisor, but can take courses at any of the campuses. This allows the group to have more diverse course offerings more efficiently.
