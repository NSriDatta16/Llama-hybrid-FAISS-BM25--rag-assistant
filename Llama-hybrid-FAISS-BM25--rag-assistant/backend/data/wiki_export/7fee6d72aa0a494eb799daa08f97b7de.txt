History

In 1934, construction began on the Army Ammunition Institute in the Kampstüh Forest  east Lehre.  More than 100 buildings on  were constructed and was connected to the railway system.  The Institute produced ammunition for infantry weapons, anti-tank mines, tank shells, artillery guns and .38 cm. Up until February 1945, 6,000 tons of chemical weapons were transported to the institute. It was not bombed during World War II and up until the end war, most of these weapons remained on site.  In 1945, the location also housed Russian prisoners of war. On 11 April 1945, the area was liberated by the United States' 5th Armored Division and the Army Ammunition Institute was occupied without a fight. In mid 1945, the area was handed over to British troops who had a local presence until 1951. Today, many original buildings still remain standing and some are still in use.
