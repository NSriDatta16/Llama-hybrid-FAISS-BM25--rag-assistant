2019 strike and contract negotiations
On March 7, 2019, members of the ONA voted unanimously to strike due to the fact that the proposed Windsor-Essex County Health Unit proposed only a 1% raise. Following several weeks of negotiations, the union won an annual 1.5% pay raise for three years, for a total of 4.5%. In addition to the wage gains, the union won increased family medical leave and a provision to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.
