This is an alphabetical list of school districts in Missouri, sorted first by the state supervisors of instruction regions, the counties each region serves, and then alphabetically.

Many districts have the letters "C" or "R" in their name, followed by a numeral. These stand for "consolidated" (merged through consent of voters) and "reorganized" (merged by the state), respectively, with number indicating the historical order of the merger.
