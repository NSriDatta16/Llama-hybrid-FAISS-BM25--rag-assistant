The Platinum Collection is a compilation album by English drummer and singer Phil Collins. It was released in May 2004. 

The set consists of all three of Collins' number one albums in the UK: Face Value, No Jacket Required and ...But Seriously. The last two also reached number one in the United States.

The individual albums featured several of Collins' most successful singles, including "In the Air Tonight", "One More Night" and "Another Day in Paradise". The collection sold approximately 200,000 copies and reached number four in the UK.

A compilation album covering the band Genesis, of whom Collins is a member, also titled The Platinum Collection and also consisting of three CDs, was released later in 2004.

In 2010 a different collection of the same name was released in some European countries, which consisted of Face Value, Both Sides and Testify.
