Biography

He was born Marcel Hyacinthe le Bozec in Paris, France.

Varnel started his working life on the Paris stage, soon becoming a director of musical comedies. In 1925, he moved to New York City, working as director in several Broadway operettas, musicals and dramas for the Shubert family. This was followed by a move to Hollywood, where he directed three low budget thrillers.
