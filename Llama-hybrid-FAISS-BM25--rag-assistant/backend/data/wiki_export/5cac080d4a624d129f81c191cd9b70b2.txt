The King's Venturer Award (formerly Queen's Venturer Award) is the highest Scouting proficiency award for Venturer Scouts in Scouts Canada that can be regularly awarded, as the Amory Adventure Award is only awarded to one venturer company each year. When the Scout program was divided into Scouts and Venturers, during the reign of Queen Elizabeth II, the highest award, the Queen's Scout Award, was renamed to reflect its application to the Venturer section. The award is presented to venturers who have acquired competence and skills that will be of considerable use to themselves, their company, and their community. These venturers will have also been recognized by the company, the advisor, and Scouts Canada as being worthy of receiving the award.

The King's Venturer Award signifies that a venturer has, in the opinion of those who know the venturer, both the character and ability to be of significant help to others. It consists of a cloth emblem and a parchment certificate, signed by the governor general of Canada, in the official capacity as chief scout of Canada.
