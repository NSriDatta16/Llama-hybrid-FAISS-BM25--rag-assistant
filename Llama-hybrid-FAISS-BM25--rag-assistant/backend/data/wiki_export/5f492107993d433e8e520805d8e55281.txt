History 
The location of the neighborhood was once an ancient village, and in 1788, the Qajar dynasty choose this as their capital. It is known for its mountainous landscape. The area was often used as a summer retreat by city residents. 

Until the 1920s, Tajrish and neighboring Shemiranat were a collection of small villages along Tehran's border. The area was relatively disconnected from Tehran's urban with the exception of Old Shemiran Road, currently known as Shariati Avenue. With the construction of Pahlavi Road (now named Valiasr Street) in 1930s and Modarres Highway, then known as Shahanshahi Boulevard, the Northern suburbs became highly accessible from downtown and rapid extension became possible.

Tajrish Bazaar 

Tehran has two bazaars, the Tajrish Bazaar is located in the north and the Grand Bazaar is located in the south of the city. The bazaar was developed in the 18th-century (although some sources state early 19th-century), and was associated with the village of Shemiranat and the Qajar dynasty. The location of the Tajrish Bazaar is bound by Panzandeh-e Kordad Street, Molavi Street, Mostafa Khomeini Street, and Khayyam Street.

Tajrish Bazaar has been built according to architectural style which closely resembles the Grand Bazaar in downtown Tehran. Some of its arches have been destroyed due to construction of multi-story buildings and its traditional identity has been threatened by irregularity of window shops and external view of new stores. Tajrish Bazaar includes a roofed passageway through which thousands of people pass en route to either paying pilgrimage the Emamzadeh Saleh or to the bazaar for purchasing goods.

The traditional bazaar of Tajrish neighborhood has been renovated by the Tehran Beautification Organization, which featured reconstruction of the traditional market using both traditional and modern styles, wastewater collection, power, gas, telecommunication installations, as well as repair of small and large shops and passageways.

Language dialect 
Tajrishi is also a dialect of Persian, which is nowadays almost extinct and has been replaced by standard Persian. The etymology of the word Tajrish itself is unknown.

Iranian linguist Habib Borjian, after examining all the available material at hand concerning this dialect confirms it is a dialect of the Persian and writes: "Tajrishi shows no divergence from the Persid group, despite minor variation with respect to modern standard Persian. It is in verb morphology that we do find in Tajrishi a massive Caspian overlay, imposed on the dialect by means of age-old socio-economic ties with the districts to its north in the Alborz chain. We may thus characterize Tajrishi and
other Shemirāni dialects as Persian with a significant Caspian imprint. Surprisingly enough, we find no trace of a Northwestern Iranian substratum in the dialect of Tajrish, nor do we find it in the scanty material available to us about the other extinct vernaculars of Shemirān ... This situation can only attest to an early Persianization of Rey and its adjoining settlements."
