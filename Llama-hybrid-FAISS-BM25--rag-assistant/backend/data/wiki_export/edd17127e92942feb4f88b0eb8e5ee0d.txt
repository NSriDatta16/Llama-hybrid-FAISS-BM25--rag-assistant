Lotusblüthen (1893-1900) and New Lotusblüten (1908-1913 (1914/15)) was a theosophical magazine published by Franz Hartmann. It was the second theosophical magazine in Germany and Austria after Wilhelm Hübbe-Schleidens Die Sphinx.

Lotusblüthen
Lotusblüthen was a monthly journal containing articles and selected translations. The first edition appeared in March 1893 in Leipzig, the last in September 1900, thus there were altogether 96 editions. In each case six editions were bound to one booklet, i.e. editions January to June were combined into a large booklet, which appeared in each case in March, likewise editions July until Decembers with publication date in September. The format corresponded to today's DIN A 5. Franz Hartmann not only functioned as a publisher, but wrote also most of the published articles. The total number of pages of all editions during 1893 to 1900 was approx. 7300 pages, of this 6300 pages were written by Hartmann.

New Lotusblüten 
The new Lotusblüten, (this time already written without "h"), was published after 1908. 
It was now a bimonthly journal, containing original articles and selected translations. The first edition appeared June/July 1908 in Leipzig and Berlin, the last probably in June/July 1913, thus altogether there were 36 (possibly also 42 or 48) editions. It is unsure if the magazine was published in 1914 and 1915. During the secured six years of existence of the magazine until 1913, the total number of pages was approximately 2400 pages. The edition of 1913, was published, because of Hartmann's death on 7 August 1912, by Paul Harald Grävell von Jostenoode (1856-1932).

The new Lotusblüten did not reach the same level of quality as the first Lotusblüthen.
