"9 PM (Till I Come)" is a song by German DJ and producer ATB from his debut studio album, Movin' Melodies (1999). It was co-written by ATB, Angel Ferrerons, Julio Posadas and Yolanda Rivera. It features vocals by Spanish model Yolanda Rivera and a pipe organ hook created on guitar. The track's hook would later be reworked into the single "Don't Stop!" in 1999, which also featured on Movin' Melodies and also proved very popular.

"9 PM (Till I Come)" was released by Kontor and Radikal Records on 26 October 1998 as ATB's debut single. The song topped the UK Singles Chart and Irish Singles Chart, charting within the top 10 in Australia, Denmark, Greece, Italy, and Norway. A remake with German DJ producer Topic and Swedish singer A7S was released by Virgin Records on 15 January 2021. Tiësto also released a remix of the remake.

Background
The original draft of the song was titled "9 PM" after ATB overran time spent in studio creating it. The song was written and produced solely by ATB. It is composed in the key of A minor with a tempo of 130 beats per minute.

Critical reception
In The Independent, Barney Hoskyns cited the song's "purring titillation" as an example of trance music sublimating sexuality. NMEs Sarah Anderson called it "the woozy sound of Ibiza when it's just too hot" and described Rivera's vocals as "suitably breathy".

Chart performance
"9 PM (Till I Come)" peaked at number 14 on the German Singles Chart. Internationally, the song was also successful. The single entered at number one in the United Kingdom for the week ending 3 July 1999 becoming the first trance song to top the UK charts, and stayed there for two weeks, becoming the country's fifth best-selling single of 1999. As of July 2014, it has sold over 890,000 copies in the UK. The song was also number one in Ireland for four consecutive weeks. It reached number three in Denmark, Italy, and Norway, number five in Flanders, and number 10 in Australia.

"Your Love (9PM)"

It was written by the three artists and produced by ATB, Rudi Dittmann and Topic.

They met in a studio in Germany for the collaboration and worked with A7S on the lyrics and vocals via Zoom. The lyrics were written in one take. It is composed in the key of A minor with a tempo of 126 beats per minute. A remix by Dutch DJ Tiësto was released on 26 March 2021.
