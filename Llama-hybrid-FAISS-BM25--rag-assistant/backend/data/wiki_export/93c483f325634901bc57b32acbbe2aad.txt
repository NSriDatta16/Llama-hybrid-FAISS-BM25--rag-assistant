Palacio Salvo () is a building at the intersection of 18 de Julio Avenue and Plaza Independencia in Montevideo, Uruguay.

Finished in 1928, Palacio Salvo stands  high with the antenna included. It was the tallest building in Latin America for a brief period.

Overview 
The site was bought by the Salvo brothers for 650,000 Uruguayan pesos. It was built on the site where the Confiteria La Giralda was once located, a place renowned for being where Gerardo Matos Rodríguez wrote his tango La Cumparsita in 1917. At present, on that same historic site, inside Palacio Salvo, the Tango Museum of Montevideo is open to the public, and exhibits the history of La Cumparsita and of Uruguayan Tango.
