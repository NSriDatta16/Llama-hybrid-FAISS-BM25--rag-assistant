David Goodman Mandelbaum (August 22, 1911, in Chicago – April 19, 1987) was an American anthropologist.

He majored in anthropology at Northwestern University, studying with Melville J. Herskovits. His major published work dealt with the Plains Cree people of Saskatchewan, Canada and he was well regarded for his study of society in India. He earned his doctorate at Yale University in 1936.

He taught at University of Minnesota (1941–1946), University of California (1946–1978), and was an active professor emeritus at the latter until his death in 1987 from cancer.
