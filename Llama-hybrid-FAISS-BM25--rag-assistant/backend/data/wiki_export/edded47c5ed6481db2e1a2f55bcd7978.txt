Karen Zoid (born Karen Louise Greeff on 10 August 1978) is a  South African rock singer, songwriter, guitarist, composer and talk show host. Her work in both English and Afrikaans has gathered critical acclaim, and she has been dubbed South Africa's "Queen of Rock" by several major local publications. Her followers and, more generally, the South African youth have also been referred to as the "Zoid Generation" by the press. Zoid's current band members are Henry Steel Jnr (guitar), Schalk van der Merwe (bass guitar) and Jonno Sweetman (drums). The singer is also known for hosting the kykNet television series Republiek van Zoid Afrika and was one of the judges on The Voice SA as well.

Early life

Born in Brussels to a South African diplomat, Zoid grew up in Belgium before moving to Johannesburg. Here she attended the National School of the Arts before going on to study drama at AFDA. In 2001, she dropped out of university to focus her attention on music.

Career

Zoid's first album, Poles Apart, was released by EMI in June 2001. "Afrikaners is Plesierig", a song featured on the album, has achieved iconic status in South Africa, entering the local lexicon and being listed as one of the 100 greatest South African songs by the Sunday Times.  EMI released her second album, Chasing the Sun, in June 2003 and her third, Media, in July 2005. Her fourth album, Postmodern World, was released in August 2007 after she had left EMI and signed with Just Music earlier that year. In 2009, Sony released Ultimate Zoid, a two disk album combining hits from her previous albums with three new tracks, and a live recording. Terms and Conditions was also released by Sony in 2010. Zoid Afrika was released in 2012, by Zoid's own production company, Karen Zoid Productions.

Music from Zoid's albums has been included on the audio entertainment of international flights to and from South Africa. She has also written music for television, with two of her songs featuring in the 2006 movie "Number 10". On 3 May 2008, she won the SAMA for Best Female Solo Artist. Karen Zoid performed at the inaugurations of Presidents Thabo Mbeki in 2004 and Jacob Zuma in 2009.
