The Miss Nebraska Teen USA competition is the pageant that selects the representative for the state of Nebraska in the Miss Teen USA pageant. The pageant is directed by Vanbros & Associates, headquartered in Lenexa, Kansas. In 2002, Nebraska joined the Vanbros group of state pageants for the Miss USA and Teen USA system. In 2022, Nebraska became the 28th state that won the Miss Teen USA title for the first time.

Nebraska has had only six placements at Miss Teen USA. The state was the second-to-last to make its first placement, which came in 2004, when Meagan Winings advanced to the semi-finals. 

Five Nebraska teens have crossed over to win the Miss Nebraska USA title and compete at Miss USA, with Sarah Summers being the most successful, winning the title of Miss USA 2018. One other Nebraskan previously competed in the Miss America's Outstanding Teen.

Faron Medhi of Omaha was crowned Miss Nebraska Teen USA 2022 on March 6, 2022, at Rose Blumkin Performing Arts Center in Omaha. She went on to win Miss Teen USA 2022 on October 1, 2022, becoming the very first delegate from Nebraska to win the title.
