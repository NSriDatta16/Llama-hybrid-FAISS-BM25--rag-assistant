The TSport 200 is a NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series race at Lucas Oil Indianapolis Raceway Park in the suburb of Clermont, Indiana, located west of Indianapolis. It was held each year starting in 1995 (the first season of the Truck Series) until 2011 and returned to the Truck Series schedule in 2022. The event has always been held on the same weekend as the NASCAR Cup Series Verizon 200 (previously the Brickyard 400) weekend at the nearby Indianapolis Motor Speedway, similar to the IndyCar Road to Indy Carb Night Classic serving the same purpose for the Indianapolis 500. From 1995 to 2000, the race was held on Thursday night. From 2001 to 2011, and again in 2022, the race was held on Friday night.
