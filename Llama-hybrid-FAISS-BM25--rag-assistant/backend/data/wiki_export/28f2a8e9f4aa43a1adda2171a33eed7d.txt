Volvo Cars has a long reputation as a maker of inline (or straight) engines. This list of Volvo engines gives an overview of available internal combustion engines.

When Volvo started in 1927, they ordered their engines from the engine manufacturer Penta in Skövde. The first engine was the inline four-cylinder side valve  Type DA. In 1931, Volvo acquired a majority of the Penta stock, and in 1935, Penta became a subsidiary of Volvo. For the engines used by Volvo Trucks, see List of Volvo Trucks engines.

Previous owner, Ford Motor Company, allowed Volvo to continue to design their own engines, with a new-generation straight-six engine introduced in 2006. More recently the VEA program has been launched. VEA engines are branded as "Drive-E" in marketing. In 2017, Volvo Cars announced they will no longer develop diesel engines.

Naming
To name their engines, Volvo has used:
1955–1985 — four or five characters
1985–1994 — five or six characters
1993–1994 — six to eight characters

Generally, the following naming scheme is used:
Either B for Bensin (petrol/gasoline engines) or D  for diesel engines
Two digits for engine displacement (moved after number of cylinders from 1993)
One for valves per cylinder (not found before 1985)
One to three characters for other engine features

In 2010 Volvo changed their engine branding nomenclature so that it is independent of engine size and number of cylinders. The letter "D" designates diesel and "T" petrol. Letters are followed by a number that dictate the level of power. The table below list the lower limit power required for each emblem in 2010.

Engines in production

Petrol

GEP3 
The Global Engine Petrol 3 is a three-cylinder engine jointly developed by Volvo and Geely based on the Volvo Engine Architecture. It is marketed under the Drive-E and G-power names.

VEP4 
The Volvo Engine Petrol 4 is a four-cylinder engine with 1.5L or 2.0L displacement. It is used by Volvo, Lynk&Co and Geely marque vehicles.

Diesel

VED4 
The Volvo Engine Diesel 4 is a four-cylinder engine with 2.0L displacement. It is used by Volvo in certain markets and is the final family of Volvo Cars diesel engines after they announced in 2017 that they would no longer develop diesel engines. Most possible reason of that is a damaged overall reputation of diesel engines for passenger cars after 2015 Volkswagen Group emissions scandal.
