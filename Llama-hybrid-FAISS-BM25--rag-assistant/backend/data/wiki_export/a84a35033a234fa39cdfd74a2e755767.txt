Life and career
Tanaka was born on November 23, 1932 in Toki District, Gifu to a family of Mino ware potters. After graduating from Reitaku Junior College, he became a substitute teacher in Gifu. However, he gave up the job to become an actor for the Haiyuza Theatre Company.

In 1957, Tanaka had his first film role in Tadashi Imai's Jun'ai Monogatari. His first notable role was as a thug in Akira Kurosawa's The Bad Sleep Well (1960), and he would later work with the director again on Sanjuro (1962) and Dodes'ka-den (1970). He established himself as an actor with the role of lecherous antagonist Shinjiro Ishiyama, nicknamed "Aodaishō", in 1961's Daigaku no Wakadaishō. It spawned the 17-film Wakadaishō series (1961–1981), and he reprised the role for each installment. Tanaka also appeared in Masaki Kobayashi's Kwaidan (1964), and portrayed Daisuke Jigen in Lupin III: Strange Psychokinetic Strategy (1974). He is also known for playing Masakichi Makihara in Kinji Fukasaku's Battles Without Honor and Humanity series (1973–1974) of yakuza films.

Tanaka is well-known for starring as Goro Kuroita in the Kita no Kuni Kara television series, which had various installments between 1981 and 2002. His last film role was in 2010's Saigo no Chushingura.
