Biography 
He was born on 29 December 1925 in Lahore (which was then part of British India before the partition). He pursued his higher studies at the Government College University, Lahore. He moved to Bombay and later settled in Kolkata in 1950 at a time when his birthplace Lahore (which later became part of Pakistan after it gained independence in 1947) endured post-independence riots in 1948.

He was the vice captain of the Indian team at the 1952 Summer Olympics where India secured gold medal in the final against the Netherlands with a comfortable 6–1 win. He was also in the radar for the 1956 Summer Olympics but could not make it into the team due to his professional commitments with Brooke Bond. It was revealed that his employer Brooke Bond did not grant him permission to participate at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics.

He played for Calcutta Port Commissioners in 1950 and then joined Mohun Bagan AC in 1951 after accepting the invitation from Jahar Ganguly who served as the then secretary of Mohun Bagan Hockey.

During his ten-year career with Mohun Bagan club, the club won a total of three Beighton Cups and six Calcutta Hockey League titles. He also played badminton, representing Bengal at the national level.

He was conferred with the Mohun Bagan award in 2019 and became the first non footballer to receive the award. In 2020, he received the Dhyan Chand Lifetime Achievement Award for his contributions in the field of hockey.
