Subtv owns its own cable network where it broadcasts to 96 British universities on plasma screens. As well as broadcasting standardised programming consisting solely of music videos, music programming and advertising, the channel also airs a mix of student-made content, messages and announcements specific to the unions, and interactive content.

SubDC

In 2009 Subtv network in a minor way expanded with the introduction of the new and advanced Subtv Info digital signage network. Aimed specifically for University coverage, within high foot-fall areas of University buildings, departments, libraries, canteens, gyms and lecture theatres. This venture failed.

Cable network broadcast technology

Content is stored locally on a network of servers installed at each installation. A Touch Screen accessible at each location allows for interaction with the application. Features include creating playlists of content from the catalogue, digital signage mode, DJ visuals and Sports Mode. Sports mode allow for the system to broadcast traditional TV via a TV tuner card. A distinct feature of the system is the two channel format, where 1 channel is used to display entertainment content and the other channel displays digital signage.

Stakeholders in Subtv's estate are encouraged to upload content to the screens installed in their environment, via a small website dedicated to content upload. In 2010 Subtv launched 'TouchScreen' an iPhone application, allowing consumers to select tracks and make dedications from their iPhone.
