Hidden Valley was a ski resort in Vernon Township, New Jersey, United States, located off of County Route 515, near the intersection with Route 94, approximately an hour's drive from the George Washington Bridge. Since January 2016, the area has been repurposed as the National Winter Activity Center, which provides education and ski/snowboard instruction to groups that might not have access to winter sports.

History
Built by Jack and Peg Kurlander - the resort opened in 1975. In 2007 the resort, after years of struggling to compete with the nearby and much larger Mountain Creek, declared bankruptcy and was sold at a sheriff's auction. A group of investors bought it at auction with the intention of turning it into an all-inclusive resort. After an unusually warm winter in 2011 and numerous problems throughout,  it was once again put up for liquidation auction in the fall of 2013. It failed to sell at auction, and did not open for the 2013/2014 ski season.

In February 2014, the National Winter Activity Center (NWAC) began operating at the former Hidden Valley site.
