Holly Hobbie & Friends is a series of American animated specials produced by Nickelodeon and American Greetings. It is the first series to star the Holly Hobbie doll, albeit redesigned from her traditional look. The specials aired on both Nickelodeon's Nick Jr. block and the separate Noggin channel.

In this incarnation of Holly Hobbie, Holly is a ten-year-old girl who forms a secret club (called the Hey Girls) with her two best friends, Amy and Carrie. Holly is the great, great granddaughter of the original Holly Hobbie character. According to American Greetings, the intention was for Holly to "look pretty much the same, but with new, contemporary colors and patterns."

The first special, "Surprise Party," premiered during the Nick Jr. block on February 10, 2006. Eight episodes were made in total. A line of merchandise was also made as a partnership between American Greetings and Nickelodeon & Viacom Consumer Products.

DVD releases for the specials were released by Paramount Home Entertainment, but later transitioned to Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.

A video game based on the series for the Nintendo DS released on October 8, 2007.

Music 
The show's theme song "Twinkle in Her Eye" was performed by the country singer LeAnn Rimes.

Reception
The specials received positive reviews. Regina McMenomy, a researcher at Washington State University specializing in female pop culture, praised how Holly embraces her girlishness while still being a "strong, independent" thinker. In comparison, "so many [other] newer girl characters focus on power and gender equality that they've lost their femininity," said McMenomy. Writing for The World, Jacqueline Cutler said that the show keeps the "sweet spirit" of the original Holly Hobbie brand. She also said that it would connect to its target audience: "If you're a traditional little girl and love copious amounts of sugar and everything cute, then Nickelodeon's Holly Hobbie & Friends airing Monday, Nov. 13, is for you." The Dove Foundation awarded the series its "Dove Family-Approved Seal" and wrote that "Holly Hobbie is a wonderful role model for children and adults. She has a way of brightening your day."
