History 

The current residential settlement was founded by one Gilberto Fogliani in 1262 with the construction of the Castle around which some houses developed. Initially built for defensive purposes, it was later transformed into a seigneurial mansion by the Boiardo family (1423–1560) and later into a Renaissance palace by the Marquis Thiene (1565–1623), the Bentivoglio (1623–45) and princes of Este (1645–1796).

Since the 1960s, the town has been an important centre for the production of tiles, connected to the district of Sassuolo.
