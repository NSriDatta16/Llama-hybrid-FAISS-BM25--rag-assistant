Fresh is the second studio album by Raspberries, released in 1972 (see 1972 in music).  It contained two Top 40 singles.  "I Wanna Be With You" reached number 16 on the Billboard Hot 100, number 10 on Cash Box and number 7 on Record World.  "Let's Pretend" reached number 35 on Billboard, number 18 on Cashbox, and number 14 on Record World.  It was their highest-charting album, peaking at number 36 on the Billboard album chart.

Creem critic Mike Saunders said of it that "This is the best album Iâ€™ve heard in a long time, and it looks like we have an important group on our hands." Music critic Greg Shaw said that the album is "every bit as enjoyable as the classic Beatles albums."

Record World called the single "Drivin' Around" a "Beach Boys-styled hot rod rocker." Music critic Robert Christgau called it a "remarkable Beach Boys takeoff that has tape decks in it."

This album was re-released on CD as part of Power Pop Vol. 1, also containing their first album, Raspberries.
