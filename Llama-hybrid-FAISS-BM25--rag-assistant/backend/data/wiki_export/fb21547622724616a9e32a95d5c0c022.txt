Hidden Stash II: The Kream of the Krop is the third studio album by American rap rock group Kottonmouth Kings. It was released on October 9, 2001 via Suburban Noize/Capitol Records. Recording sessions took place at DJ Bobby B's 211 Hip-Hop Shack, Electric Ghetto Studios, The Green Room in Los Angeles and The Jungle Room. Production was handled by members Daddy X, who also served as executive producer, DJ Bobby B and D-Loc, as well as Mike Kumagai and Dog Boy. It features guest appearances from Dog Boy and Judge D.

The album peaked at number 100 on the Billboard 200.

While the album title refers to Hidden Stash, the KMK's post-Royal Highness collection of b-sides, rarities, and remixes, the album itself is a regular studio album. The only song on Hidden Stash, Vol. 2 that had been previously released was "My Mind's Playin' Tricks on Me", a Geto Boys cover version that was recorded for the compilation album Take A Bite Outta Rhyme.

On September 15, 2009, Hidden Stash II was re-issued with the Dopeumentary DVD as Double Dose V3, the third and final double dose set.
