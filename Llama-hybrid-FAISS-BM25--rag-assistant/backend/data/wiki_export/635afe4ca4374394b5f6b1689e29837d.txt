History
The settlement of the region began in 1880 with the Galheiros Ranch, owned by Inácia Ferreira Lima, who incentivated the arrival of settlers from the state of Bahia. Lands were donated to build a chapel to São João Bautista (Saint John the Baptist) and soon houses began to appear. In 1890 the village (povoado) was raised to the status of district belonging to São Domingos with the name of Galheiros, taking the name of the ranch with the same name. In 1958 it separated and became a municipality with the same name. This was changed to Cirinópolis in 1964 in honor of Luis Pereira Cirino, who had fought hard to make it a municipality. Later, in 1989 the name was changed to Divinópolis de Goiás.
