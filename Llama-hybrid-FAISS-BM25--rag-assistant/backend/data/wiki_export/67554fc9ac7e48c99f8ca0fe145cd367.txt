The Ricoh GR Digital is a compact digital camera made by Ricoh since 2005.

First announced at photokina 2004, it went on sale in Japan on 21 October 2005. The GR Digital is Ricoh's digital successor to their 35 mm GR series film cameras and the first in a series of Ricoh GR digital cameras.

Unlike most similar cameras, it lacks a zoom lens, instead having a fixed focal length of 5.9 mm (or 28 mm, in 35 mm full frame equivalent).
