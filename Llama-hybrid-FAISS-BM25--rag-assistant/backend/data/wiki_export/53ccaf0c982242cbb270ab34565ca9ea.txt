Louis Fisher (March 20, 1913 â€“ November 28, 2001) was the Socialist Labor Party of America candidate for United States President in the 1972 Presidential election and he was "the party's top vote-getting presidential candidate."  His vice presidential candidate was Genevieve Gunderson.

Fisher also ran for Governor of Illinois twice unsuccessfully; the party had run candidates for governor starting in 1896.  He also ran for Senator from Illinois four times: in 1956, 1960, 1968, 1970 and for Secretary of State of Illinois in 1944. He was also a political scholar and staunch opponent of the line-item veto.
