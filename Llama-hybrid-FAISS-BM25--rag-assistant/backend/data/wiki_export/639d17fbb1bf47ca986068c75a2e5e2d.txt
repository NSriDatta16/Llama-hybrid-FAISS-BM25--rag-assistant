Many Christmas stories have been adapted to feature films and TV specials, and have been broadcast and repeated many times on television. Since the popularization of home video in the 1980s, these films are sold and re-sold every year during the holiday shopping season. Many networks, studios, and production companies, such as Lifetime or Hallmark, produce and release new Christmas-themed films every year during or around December, all with different variations of similar plots and themes.

One film that has become the flashpoint for "Is this a Christmas movie or not?" debates is the original Die Hard (1988), alongside argument lines that either view the Bruce Willis-starring action film as a genuine "Christmas movie" intertwined with its action genre setting, or as a film that is simply set around that time of year.
