Club career
During his career, Giusti played for Unión de Santa Fe, Argentinos Juniors and Newell's Old Boys, but he had most of his success with Independiente where he captained the team in their most successful era, and was part of the sides that won the Primera Division Argentina titles in the 1983 Metropolitano Championship and during the 1988–89 season. He was named as the club's best midfielder during Independiente's 90th anniversary.

For much of his Independiente career, Giusti was partnered in midfield with Claudio Marangoni and Ricardo Bochini, which was widely considered to be one of the best midfields in Argentina in its time.

International career
At international level, Giusti played a part in five major tournaments for Argentina. He won the FIFA World Cup with Argentina in 1986, where he played in every game for the eventual champions. He also played in the 1990 FIFA World Cup where, after missing the first two group matches, he went on to figure in every game up till the semi-finals where Argentina knocked out the hosts Italy. Giusti was sent off in that match after a second bookable offence where he elbowed Italian forward Roberto Baggio. Argentina were defeated 1–0 by West Germany in the final of the competition.

Giusti is currently 22nd in the appearance records for Argentina with a total of 53 caps between 1983 and 1990.
