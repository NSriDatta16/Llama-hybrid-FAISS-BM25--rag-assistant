Beaulieu-sur-Mer (; ; ;  "Beautiful Place on the Sea"), commonly referred to simply as Beaulieu, is a seaside commune on the French Riviera between Nice and the Principality of Monaco. Located in the Alpes-Maritimes department in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region, it borders the communes of Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat and Villefranche-sur-Mer, not far from Èze to the northeast. In 2018, Beaulieu-sur-Mer had a population of 3,731. Its inhabitants are called Berlugans (masculine) and Berluganes (feminine).

History
Beaulieu-sur-Mer was inhabited in prehistoric times; a port was built by Ligurians before Romans took over the site.

The area was part of the commune of Villefranche-sur-Mer until mid-1891, when the French Parliament voted in favour of the bill allowing for the separation following local support and a positive recommendation from the General Council of Alpes-Maritimes. The first municipal elections were held on 20 September 1891 after President Sadi Carnot signed the bill into law the preceding 23 July.

The commune was renamed Beaulieu-sur-Mer from Beaulieu in 1908; the name has previously been changed from the Italian name Belloloco in 1860, after the incorporation of the County of Nice into France.

In the late 19th century and early 20th century, it became a popular destination for the international elite in the winter season. Tourism helped the commune develop economically, as it welcomed writer Leo Tolstoy, civil engineer Gustave Eiffel, publisher James Gordon Bennett Jr., composer Igor Stravinsky, as well as other personalities and monarchs from major European countries.

Today Beaulieu-sur-Mer is renowned as a Mediterranean resort village with quality marina facilities. It is also known for its the Villa Kerylos, built between 1902 and 1908 following the plans of architect Emmanuel Pontremoli.
