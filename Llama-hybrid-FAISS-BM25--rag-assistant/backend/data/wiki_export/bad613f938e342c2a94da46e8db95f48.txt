Pisharody (also spelled Pisharodi, Pisharadi, Pisharoty, or Pisharoti; colloquially known as Sharody) is a Hindu Acharya  community found more in Kerala. As Vaishnavites Pisharodys were traditionally caretakers of Hindu temples and considered as Gurus or Acharyas who taught Sanskrit and the Vedic texts. Most Pisharams (Pisharody ancestral households) are situated near Lord Krishna or Goddess Devi temples.They generally carry Vaishnavite surnames being a subset of Vishnavite sanyasi brahmin clan (Rama, krishna, Narayanan, Gopala etc) and a majority of the community still does teaching as their major profession. Eventhough they are seen more in Kerala their origin is from Kashmir and are spread throughout Indian major cities.

Origins
The Pisharodys belong to Koushika Gotra and deeply connected to the temples of Kerala and traditionally subscribed to the Vaishnavaite school of thought in the post Adi Shankaracharya period in Kerala.

Etymology
Etymologically, the word owes its origins to the saintly antecedents of the community. Bhikhshuvar (monk/mendicant) + Adikal (reverential addressing / honorific suffix) = Bhikhshuvaradikal, later corrupted to Pisharodikal and pisharody ( Shara itself being a term for a younger sanyasi). There is also another theory behind the origin of the name Pisharody. According to this, Pisharodys are descendants of a group of highly respected pure brahmans who intended to be Sanyasis. During the process of initiation to sanyasam, the aspirants are referred to as "sharas" in Sanskrit. However, the group could not complete the process to become full time "sanyasis". By then they had discarded almost all basic rituals usually performed by an ordinary brahman being elevated to the next level and hence they could not return to their earlier sect. Since they are already elevated to Sanyasi thought process, they continued as advisors to temples and authentic teachers of scriptures and higher level sanskrit. Thereafter this 'Shara' group and their descendants were called as Pisharody, later coloqualized into Pisharody, Pisharady and Sharoty. Pisharodys do not need to wear the sacred thread nor perform puja in temples as per the tradition, but act only as advisors. They do not cremate the dead body being a sanyasi, instead do the burial as samadhi, as the person has been charcterised with all sanyasi qualities. The last rites are oriented towards "Vishnusayoojyam" and the atma is directly submitted/given to lord vishnu. There for, there are no 'Bhrammarakshas' for this community and also do not perform the 'sradham' the usual annual death ritual, unlike other Hindus, the reason being their 'atma/jeeva' had already been merged with lord Vishnu after the death. The life of a 'shara' is considered as the last form of human birth and it is believed that, there will not be any rebirth.
