Wayne High School is a secondary public school located in Huber Heights, Ohio, north of Dayton, Ohio. With the high school being established in 1956, the school district was formerly known as Wayne Township Local School District. In 1981, the name changed to Huber Heights City School District when the majority of Wayne Township was turned into Huber Heights City. In February 2021, Ohio Treasurer Robert Sprague named the school one of three Ohio Compass Award honorees of the month for its financial education curriculum and partnership with Sinclair Community College with its College Credit Plus program.

Facilities 

The construction of new buildings for five elementary schools, a new junior high, and a new high school was completed in 2012.  Usage of the new high school building began in January 2013. Before then, there was a second junior high school which is now an independent preschool/ central district office.

The five elementary schools and single junior high that feed Wayne High School are as follows:

  Charles Huber Elementary
  Monticello Elementary
  Rushmore Elementary
  Valley Forge Elementary
  Wright Brothers Elementary
  Weisenborn Junior High

The old high school comprised seven separate single-story buildings connected by covered walkways: Filbrun Hall (including the cafeteria, library, music rehearsal hall, and woodworking and metalworking shops), Hawke Hall, Storck Hall, Douglass Hall, Shank Hall, Alumni Hall, and the Gymnasium and Auditorium.

The Gymnasium and Auditorium were retained for continued usage.

The new building covers approximately 292,000 square feet.  The building includes a new and larger gymnasium. It also includes a new and larger cafeteria.
