She became internationally famous for her role as "Hari" in Andrei Tarkovsky's Solaris in 1972. It was her favorite role. She was also Tarkovsky's favorite of the film, as he wrote in his diary that "Natalya B. has outshone everybody".

In 1973 she met her future husband Nikolai Burlyayev on the set of the Nikolai Mashchenko film How the Steel Was Tempered. The two later withdrew from their participation in this film. In 1976 their son Ivan was born.
