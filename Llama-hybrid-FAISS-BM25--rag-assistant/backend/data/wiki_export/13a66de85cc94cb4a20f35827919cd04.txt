Treorchy Male  Choir, also known as Treorchy Male Voice Choir, is a choir based in Treorchy in the Rhondda Valley, Wales, United Kingdom.

History
Choirs have existed in the Rhondda Valley for more than a 150 years and Treorchy is one of the best known from the area. One of its first male choirs was formed in the Red Cow Hotel in the summer of 1883 and developed into a National Eisteddfod winner, culminating in a royal command performance for Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle in 1895. The choir would later disband after the South Wales Valleys suffered during the massive economic downturn of the Great Depression in the United Kingdom and two World Wars.
 
The present Treorchy Male Choir was reformed on October 16, 1946, under the baton of John Haydn Davies, who led the choir for 20 years. They reached musical distinction in the national Eisteddfod by gaining a record eight national wins, making a total of twenty-two first prizes out of twenty seven entries.

The Treorchy Male Choir is a registered charity. It has launched its own Junior Musician of the Year competition for children in the Rhondda area.

Recordings
Treorchy was to become the first male choir to venture into the field of popular music and subsequently the choir has made more than fifty commercial recordings. Their popular music production include an album of music by Freddie Mercury and Queen and two recordings of music by Bob Marley, but they have also recorded more classical works and became the first British choir to perform Sibeliusâ€™ Kullervo Symphony in Finnish.

A series of four tours of the USA followed, with visits to the White House and performances in San Francisco, Denver, Seattle and the Mid West.
