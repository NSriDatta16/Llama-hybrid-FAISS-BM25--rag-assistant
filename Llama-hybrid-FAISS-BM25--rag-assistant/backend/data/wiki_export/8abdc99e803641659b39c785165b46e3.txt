History
Aberfoyle Park High School was built in 1983 and opened in 1984 to service the growing suburbs of Aberfoyle Park, Happy Valley, Flagstaff Hill and other surrounding suburbs. An extra two buildings were completed in 1984 for Science and English / Computing studies at the school. In 1986, Elizabeth II visited the school inspecting the facilities and meeting the students. In 1987 a new Computing Facility was opened providing computers for the students. The school grew throughout the 1990s to a peak of over 1500 students and in the late 1990s the school expanded to include the former primary school site, south-east of the original site.

Aberfoyle Park High School celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2004.
