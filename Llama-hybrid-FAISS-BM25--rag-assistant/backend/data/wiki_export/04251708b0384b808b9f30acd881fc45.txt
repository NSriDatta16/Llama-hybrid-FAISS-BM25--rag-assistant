Kihnu Airfield  is an airfield on Kihnu island in Estonia. The airfield is situated near the village of Sääre and is  southwest of Pärnu. It has no IATA airport code and is owned by AS Pärnu Lennujaam (Pärnu Airport Ltd).

Overview
The airfield has two crossing runways; 04/22  and 15/33 , both with grass surface. There are no landing lights or navigational systems on the airfield.

Small private planes use the airfield for general flights in the summer. Also LFH does charter flights to Kihnu.
