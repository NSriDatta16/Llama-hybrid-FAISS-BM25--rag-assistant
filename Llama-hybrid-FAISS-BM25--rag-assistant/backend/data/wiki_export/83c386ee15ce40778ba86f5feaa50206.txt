Guldhjälmen (The Gold Helmet) is a Swedish ice hockey award, which is awarded annually to the's most valuable player of the Swedish Hockey League (SHL) and of the Swedish Women's Hockey League (SDHL) as decided by a vote of each league’s players.

First awarded in the SHL in 1986, the Guldhjälmen is sponsored by the Swedish hockey magazine Hockey in cooperation with CCM Hockey. It is considered one of the most prestigious ice hockey prizes in Sweden. It is similar to the country's Viking Award, presented to the top Swede playing in North America as determined by player vote, and the NHL's Ted Lindsay Award, an MVP award also voted on by the players. It should not be confused with Guldpucken (Golden Puck), which is awarded by Expressen and the Swedish Ice Hockey Association to the Swedish Player of the Year.

The first woman to be awarded the Guldhjälmen by vote of the SDHL players was Lara Stalder of Brynäs IF in 2020. It should not be confused with the Kronprinsessan Margaretas pris (Crown Princess Margaretas Award), also called the SDHL MVP, which is awarded to the SDHL MVP as chosen by the Swedish Ice Hockey Association.
