Loafing and Camouflage: Sirens in the Aegean  is a 2005 motion picture and the second to bear the "Loafing & Camo" stamp (the first being Loafing and Camouflage by Nikos Perakis), although in fact it has nothing to do with that production beyond the military environment. The original sequel to Loafing and Camouflage (1984) was the 1987 film "Living Dangerously" by the same director. The film stars an ensemble cast of Greek and Turkish actors. In 2011, the film "Loafing and Camouflage: Sirens at Land" features the reunion of the cast 8 years later.

Plot
This army satire follows a small group of Greek Army soldiers in the island of Kos, when they are assigned to spend a few days guarding a small rock island named Pitta to defend an alleged invasion from Turkish troops. After their arrival in Pitta, everything looked normal until a Turkish boat (sent there for a modeling photo shooting) disembarked 4 castaways on Pitta. Amongst the models was the niece of a Turkish Admiral, which made things more complicated when the Turkish authorities started looking for them. The protagonists did not know what to do since a diplomatic incident could be inevitable. The outcome is the involvement of both countries in the incident resulting in several comic situations.
