Śrēṣṭha () is a Nepalese surname meaning "most excellent” or "great” in Sanskrit. Shrestha is one of the eponym surnames used by those belonging to the caste of Shresthas who prior to the unification of modern Nepal formed the ruling and administrative Kshatriya castes in the court of the Malla kings of Nepal. They also counted among them the trading and business Vaishya castes, and were the pre-eminent traders in between Nepal and Tibet. After the unification of Nepal, Shresthas took up business and trading since their former positions as administrators and courtiers of the royal Malla court was supplanted by the invading Gorkha forces mainly of the Khas tribe.

Background 

The word "Shrestha" was derived from Sanskrit term Shista meaning 'noble' or 'decent'. "Syasya" also means 'warrior' in Nepal Bhasa. Shresthas (or Syasya) served as administrators and courtiers during the rule of the Malla Newar kings that ruled Nepal for six hundred years  – known as the "Golden Era" of Nepal – when much of the cultural and architectural development of Nepal took place. They took a prominent role in the governance and administration of the nation and fought against the Gorkha invasion. They also contributed to protect their country Nepal from external powers like the Mughal.
