Nightmare of You is the debut studio album by American rock band Nightmare of You.

Background and production
The Movielife broke up in September 2003; guitarist Brandon Reilly formed Nightmare of You the following month, with the intention of making more pop-oriented music. As news was being spread that Reilly had started a new band, several demos (with Hot Rod Circuit drummer Mike Poorman) were posted online in January 2004. By this point, the band consisted of him and guitarist Joe McCaffery; they had written 15 songs. The following month, former Movielife bassist Phil Navetta had joined the band; drummer Sammy Siegler would be added sometime after. In June 2004, the band toured the east coast with My Chemical Romance, Boys Night Out, and Driveby. In January 2005, Navetta left the band, leaving them as a three-piece. Following this, the band flew to Los Angeles to begin work on their debut album. They accumulated 25 songs, which they cutdown to 16, and in preparation for recording, the band did 10 days of pre-production. 

Nightmare of You was recorded at The Fiction Factory in Koreatown, Los Angeles, Platinum Audio and King Noise Recording Studios in Malibu, California, and One East Recording in New York City, with producer and engineer Jason Lader; Chris Avadon engineered "In the Bathroom Is Where I Want You" and "Heaven Runs on Oil". As the band had no bassist, Lader record bass for the album. Sessions lasted between January 25 and March 13, 2005; McCaffrey and Siegler returned home a week before Reilly did as he was finishing up vocals. Mixing sessions were spread across Skip Saylor in Larchmont, Henson in Hollywood, The Fiction Factory, and Pie Studio in Long Island. Lader mixed "Dear Scene, I Wish I Were Deaf", "Ode to Serotonin", "Marry Me", and "The Studded Cinctures". Greg Collins mixed "The Days Go by Oh So Slow", "Thumbelina", "My Name Is Trouble", "Why Am I Always Right?", and "I Want to Be Buried in Your Backyard"; Perry Margouleff mixed "In the Bathroom Is Where I Want You" and "Heaven Runs on Oil".

Composition
Musically, the sound of Nightmare of You has been described as indie pop, and pop rock, with Reilly's vocals drawing comparisons to Alkaline Trio frontman Matt Skiba, and Billy Joel. Lader played bass on nearly every track, except for "Thumbelina" and "Heaven Runs on Oil", which were done by Joe Cairnes. Adam MacDougal adds keyboards and piano to every song, save for "My Name Is Trouble", "I Want to Be Buried in Your Backyard", and "In the Bathroom Is Where I Want You", and occasionally provided vocal harmonies. Lader contributed brass, mellotron, and keys on "Thumbelina" and "My Name Is Trouble". Stephanie Eital of Agent Sparks sun backup vocals on "The Days Go by Oh So Slow" and "Thumbelina".

The opening track "The Days Go by Oh So Slow" sets the tone of the album with its upbeat tempo and melodic nature showcasing Reilly's vocals. It comes across as a mix between Aztec Camera and the Smiths' frontman Morrissey. "Dear Scene, I Wish I Were Deaf" details acts that perform without having any meaningful topics to their songs. "Thumbelina" features lap steel guitar from Ben Peeler of the Mavericks, and details sexual deviance, and being young. "My Name Is Trouble" is dance song that blends Euro disco and millennial pop. "I Want to Be Buried in Your Backyard" is a mid-tempo song, and was previously named "Yuengling" after the drink of the same name. It features acoustic guitarwork from Joel Shearer of Pedestrian, and background vocals from Chantal Kreviazuk. Reilly said it was about being obsessed with a person and viewing them from a distance, while they did not harbor the same emotion. The outro horns, played by Dengue Fever member David Ralicke, in "Ode to Serotonin" recalled the work of the Decemberists. The country-indebted "Marry Me", which sees the addition of pedal steel guitar from Peeler, is followed by "In the Bathroom Is Where I Want You", which opens with an 1980s keyboard part.

Reception

Reviewers focused on the songwriting. The Guardian critic Leonie Cooper remarked that with their "glossy, ultra-modern rock, if you're looking for a band to fall in love with in 2007, Nightmare of You are currently looking like pretty fetching prospective partners". AbsolutePunk staff member Drew Beringer thought that the album was "full of personality and is a breath of fresh air in a scene that rehashes the same idea and trend over and over again". Punknews.org staff member Brian Shultz wrote that it can be difficult to maintain the "same abundant consistency to a full, proper record, but with Nightmare Of You's self-titled debut, they've nearly succeeded.  It's an exceptional album and a bit hard to believe its status as a first official LP". Raziq Rauf of Drowned in Sound praised the band for side stepping their "hardcore roots for a new, more comfortable outlook where they are more concerned with the finer points of life". He added that "despite its instantaneous nature, this self-titled debut also appears to be a grower".

Blender writer Dennis Lim said with the band's "ingratiating puppy dog of a debut, this Long Island foursome homes in on a demographic that has come to be personified by Natalie Portman’s character in Garden State: girls who love the Shins". Stylus Magazine writer Ayo Jegede remarked that the band "mastered General Studies, digging into every little field and retrieving a little kernel of interest. But rather than plant those kernels in their own soil [...] they’d rather festoon their exterior with the influences hoping some wouldn’t be able to discern their center from the surface". Gigwise Michelle Lowery wrote that the band's name "name may suggest something that ultimately should sound heavier and the pink flowery album cover even hints at a slice of irony but it would be hard pressed to find anything other than made for radio bubbly pop rock with this offering".
