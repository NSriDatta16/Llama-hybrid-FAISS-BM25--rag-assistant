The lyrics to the song were written by Charles Schoffstall, a commercial teacher between 1917 and 1920. It is played to the tune of Annie Lisle.

Lyrics:

Just above the winding Lehigh
Midst the mountains grand
Stands our dear old Alma Mater
Famed throughout the land.

Far and wide through we may sojourn,
Still our hearts are true,
To our dear old Alma Mater,
Dear old white and blue

Chorus:
High school, high school, our own high school
Dear N.L.H.S.
When afar from the we wander,
Thy dear name we bless.
