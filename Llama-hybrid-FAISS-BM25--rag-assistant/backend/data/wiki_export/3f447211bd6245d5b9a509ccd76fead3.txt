Brother's Keeper is the eighth studio album by American singer and songwriter Rich Mullins, released in 1995. This would be the final album of all-new material released by Mullins prior to his death in 1997.

Mullins originally considered naming the album "Songs" to draw ironic contrast from the unusually long titles of his previous albums. In a 1995 radio special, Mullins commented, "It's a real in-house kind of record. We didn't hire background singers; we had the wives of the guys sing for backgrounds...It was more of a family kind of project, which for me was a real blast."

The artwork on the album cover was produced by Jimmy Abegg, a member of Mullins' band.
