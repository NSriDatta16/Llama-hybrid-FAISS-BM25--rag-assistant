On 20 May, 2017, Escandon challenged Gary Russel Jr for the WBC featherweight title. Escandon was knocked down twice in the fight, the second knockdown, in the seventh round, being the decisive one. Escandon managed to get up, but was on shaky legs, as the referee waved the fight off.

His next fight was against Tugstsogt Nyambayar. Escandon dropped Nyambayar in the first round. In the second round, however, it was Nyambayar who managed to drop Escandon twice. In the third round, Nyambayar continued his dominance, dropping Escandon three times, the third time being the final one before the contest was waved off.

On 30 September, 2018, Escandon suffered his third loss in a row, this time against Brandon Figueroa. Figueroa was dominating the final rounds, before finishing Escandon in the tenth round, with a big uppercut that sent Escandon to the canvas. Escandon was in no condition to continue and the referee was forced to stop the fight.
