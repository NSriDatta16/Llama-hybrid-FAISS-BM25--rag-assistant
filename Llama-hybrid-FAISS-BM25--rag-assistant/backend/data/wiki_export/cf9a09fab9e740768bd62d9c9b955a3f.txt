José Luis "Coto" Sierra Pando (born 5 December 1968) is a Chilean football coach and former player. 

Playing in the midfield, he retired in 2009, and one year later he became the coach of his long-time team Unión Española.

Club career

Unión Española
Sierra made his debut in professional soccer with Unión Española on November 1988 against the Universidad de Chile. After two solid campaigns with Unión Española, Sierra was transferred to Real Valladolid in Spain. However, during Sierra's short time in Spain, the team had economic problems which caused him to return to Unión Española. After more success he made his debut with the Chile national team. Sierra won the Copa Chile with Unión Española in 1992 and 1993.

Colo-Colo
After an unsuccessful stint in Brazil playing for São Paulo, he went on to spend three successful years with Colo-Colo, which saw his team capture the championship in all three seasons.  Currently Sierra has found his way back to Unión Española, making a stop in between to play with UANL Tigres in Mexico for one season.  He captured the Golden Boot in Chile (awarded to the best professional football player in Chile) in 2004 and 2005.

In 1997, it was widely rumoured that then Premier League side Everton manager Howard Kendall had made an approach to bring Sierra to Goodison Park. However, for unknown reasons, possibly relating to lack of sufficient capital, Kendall decided to pull the plug on the deal.

Return to Unión Española
Sierra announced his retirement in December 2008 and accepted the position of manager with his beloved Unión Española.  He will continue on the position until the end of the Clausura 2009 tournament.

International career
Sierra was capped 53 times and scored eight goals for the Chile national team between 1991 and 2000. He played four games at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, scoring a goal on a free-kick against Cameroon.
