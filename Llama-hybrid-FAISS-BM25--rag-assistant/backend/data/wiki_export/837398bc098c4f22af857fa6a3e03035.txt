1989â€“2003 is a compilation CD released by Hedningarna in 2003 under the NorthSide label. The album is a retrospect of Hedningarna's entire career, and is like other Hedningarna albums a mixture of electronics, rock and elements from old Scandinavian folk music. It covers the period from when Hedningarna was an acoustic trio and includes a rare remix of Kruspolka and two new tracks including the six members of Hedningarna that were part of the group in 2003.
