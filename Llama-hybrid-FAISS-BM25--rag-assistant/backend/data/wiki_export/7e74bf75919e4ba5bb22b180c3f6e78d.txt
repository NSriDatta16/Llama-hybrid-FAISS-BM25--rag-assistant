Mario Edgio Pantaleone Fabrizi (25 June 1924 â€“ 5 April 1963) was an English comedian and actor of Italian descent, noted for his luxuriant moustache. He was active in Britain in the 1950s and early 1960s.

Life
Fabrizi was born to Italian parents in Holborn, London, England, in 1924, his mother's maiden name being Pisani.  His father was a Vicomte (Italian: visconte), a title that Mario inherited on his father's death in 1959.  He married Katherine Boyne of Leeds on 28 May 1960.  They had a son, Anthony, in 1961.

On 5 April 1963 Fabrizi died of a stress-related illness at his home in Neasden, London; his wife and son survived him. A week before his death, he had announced that he was leaving show business.

His son Anthony is now a businessman based in the City of London.

Career
On ITV, Fabrizi was well known for his role in Granada Television's popular series The Army Game, as Corporal "Moosh" Merryweather, while on BBC television, he was a regular member of the ensemble cast of the Tony Hancock sitcom Hancock's Half Hour. His most notable film role was as Neville Shanks, the photographer, in Hancock's 1963 film, The Punch and Judy Man. He also worked frequently with Peter Sellers and Spike Milligan.

He was buried in St. Mary's Catholic Cemetery, Harrow Road, Kensal Green, London, W.10.
