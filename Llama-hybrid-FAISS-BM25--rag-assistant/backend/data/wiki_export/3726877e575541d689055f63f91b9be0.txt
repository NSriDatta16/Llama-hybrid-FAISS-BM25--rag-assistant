Through the Looking Glass is the eleventh studio album (though counted as the 12th album overall â€” see Toto XIV)  by the American band Toto. It was released in 2002, three years after their last studio release, Mindfields. The album consists of cover versions of songs that had inspired the band.

Reception

AllMusic noted that Toto made no attempt to rework the songs they covered for the album, and concluded that "while it's nice to know that the band has good taste in other people's music, that doesn't explain why anyone needs to hear them copy that music when the originals are so readily available."
