"Just a Little" is a song by English-Irish pop group Liberty X. Written by singer Michelle Escoffery and produced by the BigPockets, it was released on 13 May 2002 as the third single from the group's debut studio album, Thinking It Over. The song proved to be Liberty X's breakthrough to mainstream and critical success, in the process overtaking fellow Popstars alumni Hear'Say in terms of success.

The song reached number one on the UK Singles Chart and reached the top 10 in Australia, Ireland, the Netherlands and New Zealand. The music video features the group as a gang of professional burglars (with two of its members, Jessica Taylor and Kelli Young, wearing tight black latex catsuits) who steal a diamond from an atrium at the Vintners' Hall in London.

Chart performance
Following its release on 13 May 2002, the song debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart on 19 May 2002, selling 153,000 copies in its first week. It stayed at number one for only a week, being replaced by Eminem's "Without Me". The record ended 2002 as the seventh-best-selling single of the year and has sold over 600,000 copies in the UK, allowing it to become a platinum-selling hit. At the 2003 BRIT Awards, the song won the Best British Single award. Outside the UK, the song experienced success in New Zealand, where it reached number two and stayed there for six non-consecutive weeks, ending the year as the third-best-selling single. It also charted within the top five in Australia, the Netherlands and Ireland, reaching numbers four, three and two, respectively.

Live performances
On occasions where the group has performed the song live on television, both Taylor and Young wear their catsuits from the original music video. In 2013, when the group performed during the Big Reunion, both members wore a different design of their catsuits.
