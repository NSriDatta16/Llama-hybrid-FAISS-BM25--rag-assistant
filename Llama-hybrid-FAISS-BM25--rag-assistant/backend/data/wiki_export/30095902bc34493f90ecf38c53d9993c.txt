Career
After establishing his reputation as a lightweight wrestler, in 1889 Eyton sailed from Australia to the United States, where he participated in a series of wrestling matches. In 1900, he came to Los Angeles and became assistant manager of the Burbank Theater and an officer of the Los Angeles Athletic Club. He also worked as a boxing referee for over a decade, and was featured on a cigarette sports trading card in 1910. The championship bouts refereed by Charles Eyton included:

In 1914, Frank Garbutt created the Oliver Morosco Photoplay Company, named after Oliver Morosco. Charles Eyton was appointed to supervise the company's productions 
and also the productions of Bosworth, Inc., which were produced in the same studio at 201 N. Occidental, in Los Angeles. Bosworth, Inc. soon folded and was replaced by Pallas Pictures. In 1916, Morosco and Pallas became part of Famous Players–Lasky, and Charles Eyton remained manager of the Morosco studio. In 1919, Eyton became manager of the larger Famous Players–Lasky studio at Sunset and Vine in Hollywood.

In 1925, he was appointed to be in charge of Paramount productions abroad. He resigned from Paramount in 1926.

William Taylor's murder
Charles Eyton was one of the first people to arrive on the scene of the murder of film director William Desmond Taylor, and was said to have been the person to have discovered that Taylor was shot when he attempted to raise the body. Eyton was interviewed by police, ostensibly in relation to means of locating the deceased's missing butler, and Eyton denied knowing about letters apparently missing from Taylor's house.
