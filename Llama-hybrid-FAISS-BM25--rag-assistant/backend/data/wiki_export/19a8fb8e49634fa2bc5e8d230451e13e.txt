Campus
Bornova Campus of Ege University is situated on an area of 370 hectares. The campus covers a wide range of facilities including culture, sports and social services. Car park, road and traffic signs and directions are available throughout. Intercity, national and international communication from the campus is possible owing to phone lines and a computer network.

Since the campus is at the crossroad between Ankara, Istanbul, and Izmir, intercity transportation is very fast. Apart from this, intercity transportation provided by municipal bus and underground services enables students to reach the campus from every part of the city. The General Directorate of Students' Credits and Dormitories administers dormitories, which provide facilities for 6000 students on campus.

Apart from the rectorate and university campus in Bornova, there are vocational training schools in Tire, Bergama, Bayındır and Ödemiş, Atatürk Cultural Center in Konak, applied educational centers in Urla, Menemen, Mordoğan, Çiğli and Özdere, and an observatory in Kurudağ. With these facilities, Ege University serves the students and the public in terms of education, science, health, social, and cultural services. To extend these services, a West Campus was recently [when?] established in Çeşme.
