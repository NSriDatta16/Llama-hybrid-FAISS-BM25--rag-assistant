History
Historically, most of this district was located in Upstate New York. In the 1960s, the 25th district was a Westchester/Rockland seat, covering areas now in the 17th and 18th districts. In the 1970s it was the lower Hudson Valley district and congruent to the present 19th district. Onondaga County was split between the 32nd district (which included rural counties east of Syracuse now in the 23rd and 24th districts) and the 33rd district (which included the Finger Lakes counties in the 24th and 29th districts).

In the 1980s, the district was centered in the Utica area (now the 24th district), and the Syracuse area was entirely in the 27th district. From 2003 to 2013, it stretched from Syracuse to the northeastern suburbs of Rochester.  The district comprised Onondaga and Wayne counties, the northernmost portion of Cayuga County, and the towns of Irondequoit, Penfield, and Webster in Monroe County.  The district included 100 miles of Lake Ontario shoreline, the easternmost Finger Lakes, and significant portions of the Erie Canal.
