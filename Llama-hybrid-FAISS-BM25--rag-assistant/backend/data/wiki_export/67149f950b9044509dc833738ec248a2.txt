Hunkpapa is the third studio album by Throwing Muses, released in 1989. It peaked at number 59 on the UK Albums Chart.

Critical reception
Trouser Press called the album "a chilly and dull record that could be by any number of contempo jangle-pop bands," and said that lead singer Kristin Hersh’s voice, "no longer possessing any strong character, is ineffectual and a bit strident at times." The New York Times wrote that the band "have edged toward rock convention." The Rolling Stone Album Guide praised the "stronger sense of groove."

NME named it the 33rd best album of 1989.
