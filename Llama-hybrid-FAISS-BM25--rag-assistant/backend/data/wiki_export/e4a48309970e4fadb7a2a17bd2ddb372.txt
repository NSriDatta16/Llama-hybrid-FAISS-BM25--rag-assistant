School Motto
The school motto was conceived in 2008, when the Vicar of Preston, simply asked, in an assembly 'what is your motto'? He received an embarrassed silence, The Headteacher responded by consulting the student leadership and the Church of England. The motto Faith, Nurture and Service evolved out of a long debate, reflecting the schools foundation of faith, the devotion of the school to the nuturing and well-being of all its pupils and a reflection of its students service within the community.

"Here I am, Lord" was the school song sung at Prize evenings at the Minster Church of Preston, and other ceremonial occasions
