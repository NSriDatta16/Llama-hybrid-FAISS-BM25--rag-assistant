Marijuana Anonymous (MA) founded in 1989 is an organization and twelve-step program for people with common desire to maintain abstinence from marijuana.

History 

Marijuana Anonymous (MA) formed in June 1989 to address compulsive use of cannabis. Since its inception, the MA fellowship has followed the Twelve Traditions and suggests practicing the Twelve Steps, both of which originated from Alcoholics Anonymous. Among the founders at the first MA conference in Morro Bay were delegates from Marijuana Smokers Anonymous (Orange County, California), Marijuana Addicts Anonymous (the San Francisco Bay area), and Marijuana Anonymous (Los Angeles County). Other existing fellowships from Seattle and New York City (1974), enfolded into MA later.

Marijuana Anonymous set up in London UK in 2000.

Marijuana Anonymous World Services is a non-profit corporation formed to carry out the necessary business and legal affairs of Marijuana Anonymous. Trustees are the officers of MA World Services, as “trusted servants” of the members of MA. These are volunteer positions and no one governs, as Marijuana Anonymous follows an "inverted triangle" of service, where the members are considered most important.

Organization 
The only requirement for membership to Marijuana Anonymous is a desire to stop using marijuana; there are no dues or fees. As an organization, Marijuana Anonymous attempts to stay neutral and has no official stance on the legality of cannabis, per Tradition Ten which states, "Marijuana Anonymous has no opinion on outside issues; hence the MA name ought never be drawn into public controversy." It is difficult for the organization to avoid taking a stance on whether marijuana is physically addicting, as their program is intended to help recover from marijuana addiction. However, the organization maintains that its materials are not to be considered medical or scientific literature, but rather based on personal experiences of its members. There is a piece of literature, "The Doctor's Opinion on Marijuana Addiction"  by Dr. Marvin Seppala, Chief Medical Officer of Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation written for members of Marijuana Anonymous.

Meetings 
Meetings are a vital part of the MA program. This is where fellowship members go for peer-to-peer support, for literature, and to mark and celebrate their abstinence from marijuana. There are regularly scheduled daily meetings across the globe, in many formats including: in-person, online and phone meetings. Per the 7th Tradition, all meetings are autonomous, self-supporting, free to attend, and outside contributions are not accepted.
