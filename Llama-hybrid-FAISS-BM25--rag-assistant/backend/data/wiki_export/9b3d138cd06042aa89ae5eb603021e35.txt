The Kansas Boxed Set is the third compilation from the band Kansas. It was originally released in 1994, and was the band's first boxed set overview. It focuses solely on the original line-up of the band, from their first album in 1974 to Audio-Visions in 1980. It also includes a new track "Wheels". The release was supervised by all the original band members, unlike the first release of The Best of Kansas in 1984.
