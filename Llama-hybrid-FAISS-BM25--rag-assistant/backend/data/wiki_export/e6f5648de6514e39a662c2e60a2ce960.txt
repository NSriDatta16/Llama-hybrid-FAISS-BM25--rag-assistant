Synopsis
Mikey beats up the leader of a card game that had been protected by Jimmy Altieri, a DiMeo family capo. While Uncle Junior is being fitted for a new suit, his tailor tells him that his 14-year-old grandson committed suicide after taking drugs sold to him by Rusty Irish, who works for DiMeo capo "Larry Boy" Barese. Junior has him killed, even though he is Larry Boy's top earner.

Prompted by Livia, Junior tells Hesh that he must now, for the first time, make payments to him. Hesh goes to Tony, who goes to Johnny Sack, the underboss in New York's Lupertazzi crime family. They negotiate with Junior, who reduces his demands, and Hesh agrees to pay. The other DiMeo capos are resentful because Junior is keeping too much money for himself. Tony speaks to Junior, who agrees to pass Hesh's tribute money down to his capos. Tony gives his share of this money back to Hesh.

Tony loses his libido as a side effect of his medication. Carmela, and Tony's mistress Irina, become very discontented. Tony also starts having erotic dreams about Dr. Melfi and believes he is in love with her. He tries to kiss her during a session, then has her aging car stolen and returned with a new starter. Carmela admits to Tony that she is jealous that his therapist can help him but she cannot. Tony tells Carmela that she is his life, and they reconcile.

Junior celebrates his promotion to boss with a banquet. A waiter has a button camera and takes photos for the FBI, which are affixed to a bulletin board mapping out the hierarchy of the DiMeo family.

First appearance
 John "Johnny Sack" Sacrimoni:  The underboss of the Lupertazzi crime family, one of the Five Families of New York City.

Title reference
The title is a reference to Pax Romana (Roman peace) and related terms (Pax Britannica, Pax Americana, etc.), which refer to a lack of conflict over a long period of time due to the unchallenged rule of a single dominant power, which Tony hopes to achieve within the Soprano family. Pax Romana was an era initiated by the Roman emperor Augustus, mentioned by Tony in his conversation with Uncle Junior.

Cultural references
 Tony speaks to Junior about Octavian, later the Roman Emperor Augustus.
 Livia alludes to Rudyard Kipling's poem Gunga Din. He was a servant who carried water to soldiers in need.
In the episode's final scene, sitting to Tony Soprano's left in the banquet hall is real-life Gambino crime family associate Anthony Corozzo, brother of Gambino capo Nicholas Corozzo and former Gambino consigliere, Joseph Corozzo.

Reception
In 2015, Alan Sepinwall argued that "Pax Soprana" is "so fraught with discomfort and complications with both family and Family (and whatever separate sphere Melfi occupies) that it's nearly as compelling in its own right as last week's Very Special Episode." Emily St. James of The A.V. Club wrote that the episode "isn't a tremendous hour of television like 'College' was, but it may be more significant."
