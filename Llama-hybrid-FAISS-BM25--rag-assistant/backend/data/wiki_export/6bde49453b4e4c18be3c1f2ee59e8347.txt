Ronald Henry Pember (11 April 1934 – 8 March 2022) was an English actor, stage director and dramatist. In a career stretching over thirty years, he was a character actor in British television productions in the 1970s – 1980s, usually in smaller parts or as a support playing a worldly-wise everyman.

Pember played the role of Alain Muny in the 1970s BBC drama series Secret Army. He also wrote a stage musical entitled Jack the Ripper (1974), about the Victorian murder spree in London in the late 1880s, which is regularly produced by amateur theatre groups and companies around the globe.
