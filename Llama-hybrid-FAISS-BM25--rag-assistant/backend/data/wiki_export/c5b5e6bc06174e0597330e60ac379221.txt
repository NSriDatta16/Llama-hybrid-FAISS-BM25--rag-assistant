Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas is the sixth game in the Rainbow Six series of video games. It was released in November 2006 for the Xbox 360, December 2006 for Windows, and in June 2007 for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable. The game's storyline follows a new team that is dispatched to Las Vegas, Nevada to defeat international terrorist Irena Morales and her army of mercenaries that are repeatedly attacking key locations in the city. A sequel developed by Ubisoft Montreal was released on Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 consoles in March 2008 and on PC in April 2008. The game is also playable on Xbox Series X with online features still available.

Gameplay
Rainbow Six Vegas changes the series with multiple new features, such as a new health system where the player regenerates health while not taking fire (the player may sometimes be killed instantly, without a chance to regenerate health; this usually happens from grenades, as well as taking close-range fire from very powerful weapons, particularly to the head). The player's vision is greatly impaired while damaged, similar to the health system in Gears of War. Furthermore, a third-person view has been included for moments where players can blind-fire around corners to lay down suppression or covering fire. Other changes include a larger enemy presence and much tougher artificial intelligence, a shift in focus to where kills will be much harder to obtain, a reincarnated aiming system similar to the aiming system of the old Rainbow Six games and a context-sensitive D-pad based command system for the player's squad and sections of gameplay where the player will scale buildings and cause environmental damage. The player can also give voice commands using the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 headset, but teammates are no longer audible through the headset.

There is no mission planning feature or save system; instead, the game uses a checkpoint system. The developers also opted to almost entirely exclude cutscenes, telling the story through video feeds on a heads-up display. The player also has various skills, such as the ability to rappel up and down buildings while shooting and the ability to fast rope into an area.

Plot
In 2010, Rainbow operatives Logan Keller, Gabriel Nowak and Kan Akahashi are deployed to a Mexican border town, where they are tasked with capturing Irena Morales, a terrorist ringleader. As the team reaches its landing zone, Logan is separated from the others after he fast-ropes down first.

Logan fights his way through the town and manages to regroup with Gabriel and Kan at an old church. After infiltrating a train yard and freeing a group of hostages, the team eventually makes its way to a mine where Irena is hiding. However, they are ambushed, and Gabriel and Kan are captured as Irena escapes.

Alone and armed only with his sidearm, Logan fights his way through an abandoned factory, eventually escaping by helicopter. He is then redeployed to handle a related crisis in Las Vegas. He is dropped outside the Calypso Casino and links up with his new team: Michael Walters and Jung Park. The team clears out the casino and saves a group of hostages, including a NATO weapons researcher, who reveals that another researcher has been captured.

The team then rescues a kidnapped reporter, who informs them that the terrorists are using a news van as a communications hub. Logan's team destroys the hub, then heads to rescue the other weapons researcher. Rainbow is dropped on the Vertigo Spire luxury hotel, where the team finds and rescues the missing researcher, who informs the team about a micro-pulse bomb that was planted in the Vertigo. Michael disarms the bomb, and the team is then extracted to locate Gabriel and Kan.

The team is dispatched to Dante's Casino, where they find Gabriel and Kan. However, Kan is fatally wounded during extraction, but manages to reveal that the attack in Las Vegas is a distraction before dying. The team then proceeds to a theatre to hack a terrorist server where they discover that Irena's target is the Nevada Dam.

As they arrive at the dam, the team discovers another micro-pulse bomb which they defuse. They then encounter a hostage who informs them that the dam will collapse if they do not activate an emergency release valve. After activating the valve, the team proceed into the facility, where they discover that it is a weapons research lab. They also find that the terrorists have a micro-pulse missile on top of the dam.

Logan presses forward, confronts Irena, and kills her. The team then heads to the top of the dam and destroys the missile. Logan receives a transmission from Gabriel, who tells him that he was Irena's mole before hijacking the team's helicopter.

As Gabriel attempts to escape with the helicopter, Logan can either let him escape or shoot him down. Afterward, Logan and the team are sent out to locate the organization behind Irena and Gabriel's terrorist activity. Later, a news clip states that a helicopter had crashed into a lake, but no bodies were found.

Development
The game was in development for more than 2 years. 180 people worked on the game.

Patches
During November 2007, the North American Support Supervisor announced on the Ubisoft forums that Ubisoft "has and will always provide support for this title", and also confirmed that Ubisoft was working on another patch." The patch was released on July 19, 2007, and updated the game to version 1.05. Since that time, Ubisoft has released the latest patch 1.06.

Collector's Edition
A Limited Collector's Edition of Rainbow Six: Vegas was released at the game's launch featuring alternative cover art and a bonus disc. The bonus disc contained a documentary on the making of Rainbow Six: Vegas and a Rainbow Six retrospective, which features information on all Rainbow Six games in the series.

Expansion packs
On April 18, 2007, the Player's Pack Red Edition was released as downloadable content on Xbox Live. The pack includes two new game modes. The first is "Assassination" whereby one team has to protect a VIP armed only with a pistol, whilst the other team needs to assassinate him. The second is Conquest (a "capture and hold"-style game, whereby each team has to hold as many strategic points for as long as possible). Three new maps were also included: "Doscala Restaurant," "Marshalling Yard," and "Roof." The maps "Killhouse" and "Border Town" have been redesigned and packaged as two new "redux" maps. The expansion pack comes directly after an update was released for the game. All original game modes and maps are compatible with those featured in the Player's Pack Red Edition. On July 6, 2007, the Red Pack was made available for download free of charge.

On June 26, 2007, a new downloadable content pack was released. The Player's Pack Black Edition features five new maps. "Red Lotus", "Wartown" and "Neon Graveyard" are the three newly featured maps. "Streets: Redux" has been redesigned in a similar fashion to the Redux maps found in the Player's Pack Red Edition, and "Presidio" is a map overhauled and upgraded from Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield. On June 27, 2007, the Black Edition was retracted from the Xbox Live Marketplace. Ubisoft announced that it was pulled due to a pricing error and that the pack (which was originally priced at 800 Microsoft Points) was intended to be free. On June 30, 2007, the Black Edition was re-released for download free of charge; Xbox Live users who paid for the pack had their points reimbursed.
