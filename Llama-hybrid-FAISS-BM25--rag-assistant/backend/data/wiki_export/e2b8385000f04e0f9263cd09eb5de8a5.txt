History

Bloomfield Stadium was built in Eastern Jaffa, on the land where Basa Stadium, home to Hapoel Tel Aviv since 1950, once stood. Finance for the stadium project came from the Canadian Association of Labour, Israel, a Canadian charity supporting the charitable works of the Hapoel Sports Movement of the Histadrut Labour Organization in Israel, the Bloomfield family of Montreal, Canada, directly and through their family foundation called the Eldee Foundation. The project was financed in Canada and intended to honor the names of brothers Bernard M. Bloomfield and Louis M. Bloomfield, Q.C. of Montreal, Canada for their lifelong dedication to the ideals of sport in Israel. The first match at the new stadium was a 1–1 draw between Hapoel and Shimshon Tel Aviv on 13 October 1962. The stadium officially opened on 13 December 1962 on a friendly match between Hapoel and Dutch club Sportclub Enschede.

In 1963, Maccabi Tel Aviv moved into Bloomfield Stadium after hosting of their matches at the Maccabiah Stadium, in 1985 Maccabi left Bloomfield Stadium for the Ramat Gan Stadium and in 2000, Maccabi returned to host at Bloomfield Stadium.

Between 2016 and 2019, it was closed due to renovations for expansion to 29,000 seats. As a result, the three clubs had to play their home matches in Petah Tikva and Netanya up until August 2019.

When Israel allowed concerts to take place again after the COVID-19 pandemic, Bloomfield Stadium was one of the first arenas to let people in for live shows.
