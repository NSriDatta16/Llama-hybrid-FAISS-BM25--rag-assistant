USA Basketball
Martin was named to the USA Basketball Women's Junior National Team (now called the U18 team). The team participated in the third Junior World Championship, held in Chetumal, Mexico in late August and early September 1996. The USA team won their early games easily, but lost by four points to the team from Brazil, ending up with the silver medal for the event.

Martin continued with the team when it was invited to the 1997 FIBA Junior World Championship (now called U19) held in Natal, Brazil. In the opening game against Japan, Martin had a double-double with 24 points and eleven rebounds, leading the team to a win. The next game was against Australia, the defending champion. The USA team pulled out to a 13-point lead in the second half, but gave up the lead and lost the game 80–74. The USA rebounded with a close 92–88 victory over Cuba, helped by 23 points from Martin and Lynn Pride. The USA then went on to beat previously unbeaten Russia. After winning the next two games, the USA faced Australia in the gold medal game. The USA team has a three-point lead late, but the Aussies hit a three-pointer with three seconds left in regulation to force overtime. Although the Aussies scored first, the USA team came back, held on to win 78–74 to earn the gold, and the first medal for a USA team at a Junior World Championship. Martin was the leading scorer for the USA team with 17.9 points per game and the second leading rebounder with 7.0 per game.
