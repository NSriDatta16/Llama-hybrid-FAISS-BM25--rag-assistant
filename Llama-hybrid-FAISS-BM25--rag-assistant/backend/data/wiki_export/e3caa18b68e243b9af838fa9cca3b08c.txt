The Swoop! and Other Stories is a collection of early short stories and a novella by P. G. Wodehouse, first published in the United States on 11 April 1979 by the Seabury Press, New York City, four years after Wodehouse's death.

The collection was edited and introduced by Wodehouse's biographer, David A. Jasen, and featured an "appreciation" by Malcolm Muggeridge. The Swoop! (a satirical spoof) was published as a book in the United Kingdom in 1909, and many of the stories had previously appeared in magazines. Two of them also featured in the UK collection Tales of St. Austin's (1903), and four in The Man Upstairs (1914).
