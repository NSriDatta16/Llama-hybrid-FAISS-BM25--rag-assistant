New York's 32nd congressional district was a congressional district for the United States House of Representatives in New York. It was eliminated as a result of the 1990 census. It was last represented by John J. LaFalce who was redistricted into the 29th district.

Past components
New York's 32nd Congressional District was first formed in 1832. The district was abolished in 1862.

It was reestablished in 1872 and then consisted of Chautauqua County, New York and Cattaraugus County, New York. In 1874, the congressional districts of New York were redrawn and the 32nd district was moved to Erie County, the location of Buffalo, New York. With 178,699 residents it was the most populous district in New York, with its closest competitor being the 153,000 population of the 1st district on Long Island.

When district boundaries were again redrawn in 1885, the 32nd district was reduced to just covering Buffalo.

By 1892 even just Buffalo was too populous for a single district, and the city was split, with the southern portion being put in the 32nd district.

In the 1902 redistricting the 32nd district was moved to Monroe County, which is dominated by the city of Rochester.
