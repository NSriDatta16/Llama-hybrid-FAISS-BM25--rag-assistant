Career

Early career
In 1987, Birklett founded Short Stop and joined the group Mass 187 in 1987. Mass 187's song "Gangsta Strut" was featured on local radio. He eventually was convicted of conspiracy and served eighteen months in prison, at a Beaumont, Texas, federal detention center.

Wanna Be a Baller and later career
In the late 1990s, Lil' Troy featured many of Houston's rappers in his songs. He reached national audiences with his single "Wanna Be a Baller". The song reached No. 70 on the Billboard Hot 100, and propelled his Shortstop/Me & Mine Entertainment debut album, Sittin' Fat Down South, to the Top 25 albums on the Billboard 200. After the success of the lead single, Lil' Troy was picked up by Universal Music Group, which re-released his debut album in 1999 with a larger national distribution. The debut album was a success, as it certified Platinum by the RIAA selling 1.9Â million copies in America. Lil' Troy released his follow up in 2001, titled Back to Ballin.  This album did not contain a charting single and did not fare nearly as well as his debut.  He released his third and to date last album, Paperwork, in 2006.

Lil' Troy later became a truck driver, forming Birklett Trucking Company in Missouri City, Texas.
