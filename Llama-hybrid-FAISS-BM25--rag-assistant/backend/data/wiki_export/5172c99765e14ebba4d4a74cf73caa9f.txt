The Surrey County Intermediate League (Western) is one of the three intermediate football leagues which has most of its teams in the English county of Surrey and is the smaller of the two feeder leagues to the Surrey Elite Intermediate League.

The current champions are Keens Park Rangers.

History
The league can trace its roots back to 1891 when the East and West Surrey League was formed then 're-constructed' into the West Surrey League in 1905. That, in turn, became the Surrey Intermediate League at the same time as the Surrey Senior League was formed, 1922.

Structure
The league has one division for first teams (reduced from two prior to the 2023–24 season) and one division for reserves. The Premier Division is at the 12th level of the English football league system. Teams may be promoted to the Surrey Elite Intermediate League, or be relegated to and replaced by teams from the Guildford & Woking Alliance.
