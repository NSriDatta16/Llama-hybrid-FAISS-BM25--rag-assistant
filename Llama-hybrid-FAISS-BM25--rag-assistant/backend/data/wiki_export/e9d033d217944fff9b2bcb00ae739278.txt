Wayne Richardson (born 8 December 1946) is a former Australian rules footballer who played for Collingwood Football Club in the Victorian Football League (VFL).

Richardson was recruited to Collingwood from South Fremantle Football Club in the West Australian National Football League. South Fremantle would not clear Richardson to Collingwood so he ended up sitting out the 1965 season.

Richardson played predominantly as an onballer for Collingwood. He won Collingwood's best and fairest, the Copeland Trophy, in 1971 and 1974. And also captained the club from 1971 to 1975.

In 1996, Richardson was named on the interchange in Collingwood's Team of the Century.

Wayne's brother Max Richardson played 211 games for Collingwood from 1969–1978, and another 30 for Fitzroy Football Club in 1979–1980. His son Mark Richardson played 141 games for Collingwood from 1992–2002.
