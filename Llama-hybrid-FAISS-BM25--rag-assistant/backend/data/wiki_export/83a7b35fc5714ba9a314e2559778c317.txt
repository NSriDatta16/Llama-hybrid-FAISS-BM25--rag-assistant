The Basketball League of Serbia (BLS) (; abbr. КЛС or KLS), is a top-tier men's professional basketball league in Serbia. Founded in 2006. It is currently not run by the Basketball Federation of Serbia (KSS).

Rules

Competition format
The league, operated by the Basketball Federation of Serbia, consists of two stages: the First League which has 16 teams and the SuperLeague which has 8 teams.

Since the 2017–18 season, the top 8 teams in First League are promoted to Super League with five Serbian teams from the ABA League. Two lowest-placed teams, positioned 15th and 16th in the First League, are relegated to a lower-tier league – Second Basketball League of Serbia. Teams positioned 1st and 2nd in First League will be qualified for the next season's ABA League Second Division. The SuperLeague has 8 clubs divided into 2 groups of 4 teams. The best 4 clubs (top 2 teams from groups A and B each) in the SuperLeague go to the Playoff stage.

The following is the access list for current season:

Arena standards
Currently, clubs must have home arenas with a capacity of a minimum of 1,000 seats.
