History 

The original, private Balboa Bay Club was owned by Jack Wrather from 1960 until 1971, when he sold it to William Ray. In 1988, William Ray was inducted into the International Hall of Fame for his conservation efforts.

Ray died in 1991, and his widow, Beverly Ray Parkhurst owned the club until 2012. The 160-room hotel opened to the public on May 14, 2003. In 2011 the club was sold to Winston Chung, a Hongkongese businessman. It was later reported that the sale to Chung fell out of escrow as Chung was having difficulty moving funds out of China to pay for the purchase.

In June 2012, the BBC was sold to Richard H. Pickup and his family members, Eagle Four Partners and Pacific Hospitality Group, LLC  The Resort & Club is now fully independent and owned by Eagle Four Partners, making up the entity of International Bay Clubs.

In 2013, the Balboa Bay Club and Resort was renamed as two separate entities and opened its renovated resort 'Balboa Bay Resort' to the public. The club continues to be open for members only.
