While at WWKB-AM, he was offered his first professional on-air gig as a lifestyles reporter for WWKB's sister station, WKSE-FM (KISS 98.5).  Blaustein continued to attend college full-time, work at both radio stations and create and co-host a popular talk show on the campus radio station, WBNY-FM, called "Misinformation."  Mr. Blaustein's co-host was novelist Micah Nathan, author of Simon and Schuster's Gods of Aberdeen.

Blaustein once served as a radio Producer for Alan Colmes of the Fox News Channel's Hannity and Colmes, and nationally syndicated radio personality Barry Farber.

Trainwreck: Woodstock '99 
Blaustein is featured in the Netflix series Trainwreck: Woodstock 99. Blaustein, a young reporter for ABC News Radio in 1999, is the first person we see in the series, with archival footage of Blaustein participating in an interview in the aftermath of the ill-fated festival.

The titles of episodes 1 and 2, "How the F**k Did This Happen"  and "Kerosene. Match. Boom!"  are based on quotes from Blaustein.
