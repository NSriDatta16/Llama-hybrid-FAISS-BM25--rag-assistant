An earthquake devastated this area on May 31, 1970 and the USAF sent crews down to help with the recovery.  Two USAF Combat Controllers were deployed to Anta, in the mountains, to convert an existing dirt roadway into a runway.  During the week or so that they were constructing the runway, supplies were airdropped in for the people in the region.  After about a week, aircraft were able to land with supplies and leave with injured.
