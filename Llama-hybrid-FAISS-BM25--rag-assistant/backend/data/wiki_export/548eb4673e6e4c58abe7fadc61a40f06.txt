Louis Joseph Kenny Tussaud (1869–1938) was a great-grandson of Marie Tussaud, creator of the Madame Tussauds wax museums. He worked at Madame Tussauds museum as a wax figure sculptor but left when his brother John Theodore Tussaud became chief artist and manager of the museum after a limited company was formed in 1888 and sold in 1889. The main shareholder was Edwin Josiah Poyser.

Louis Tussaud created a waxwork museum in London, 207 Regent Street, which opened 24 December 1890. The Regent Street waxwork museum was destroyed in a fire on 20 June 1891. He moved to Blackpool in 1900. He first set up a waxworks in Blackpool in the basement of the Hippodrome Theatre, Church Street, opening it in July 1900. The following year, he moved the exhibition to the Brunswick Café, South Shore. In 1929 the Louis Tussaud's Waxworks opened on Central Promenade. It was closed in 2010 and re-opened as Madame Tussauds in 2011.

Louis Tussaud wax museums were later established in Atlantic City; Belle Vue, Greater Manchester; Brighton (1937–1979); Copenhagen (1974–2007); Great Yarmouth (1954–2013) and St. Petersburg, Florida. There was a Louis Tussaud shakespearian waxworks in Stratford-upon-Avon from 1971 to 1983.
