The Crater Highlands  or Ngorongoro Volcanic Highlands (Milima kasoko ya Ngorongoro , in Swahili) are a geological region along the East African Rift in the Arusha Region and parts of northern Manyara Region in north Tanzania. The Crater Highlands are made up of several large volcanic complexes, including the 2.4-2.2 Ma Lemagarut and 2.25-2.0 Ma Ngorongoro basalt-trachybasalt-trachyandesite volcanoes (Ngorongoro also contains trachydacite) and the 1.6-1.5 Ma Oldeani basalt-trachyandesite volcano.

Geology
The highlands are located in a spreading zone at the intersection of branches of two tectonic plates, the African Plate and Somali Plate, resulting in distinctive and prominent landforms.

The highlands are named for the many craters and calderas present. As is common in spreading zones, volcanoes can be found here. Magma, rising to fill the gaps, reaches the surface and builds cones. Calderas form if a volcano explodes or collapses, following the emptying of the magma chamber below, and further spreading can fracture the volcanoes as well.
