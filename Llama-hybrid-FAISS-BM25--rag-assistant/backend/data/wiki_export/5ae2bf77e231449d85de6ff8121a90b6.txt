George Joseph Amy (October 15, 1903 â€“ December 18, 1986) was an American film editor. He was born in Brooklyn, New York, and started his career at the age of  17, finding his niche at Warner Brothers in the 1930s. It was Amy's editing that was one of the main reasons Warners' films got their reputation for their fluid style and breakneck pace.

He was a favorite of such top Warners directors as Michael Curtiz and Howard Hawks, and won an Academy Award for Best Film Editing for Hawks' Air Force (1943). He received Oscar nominations for Curtiz's Yankee Doodle Dandy in 1942 and Raoul Walsh's fanciful war film Objective, Burma! in 1945. Although Amy directed several shorts and a few features (including She Had to Say Yes) on his own for Warners, they didn't meet with much success. In the 1950s, he turned to editing and directing for television.
