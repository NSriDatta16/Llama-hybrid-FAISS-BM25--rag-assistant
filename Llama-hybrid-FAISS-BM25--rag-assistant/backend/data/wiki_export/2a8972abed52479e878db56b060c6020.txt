In mathematics, the Nagata conjecture on curves, named after Masayoshi Nagata, governs the minimal degree required for a plane algebraic curve to pass through a collection of very general points with prescribed multiplicities.

History
Nagata arrived at the conjecture via work on the 14th problem of Hilbert, which asks whether the invariant ring of a linear group action on the polynomial ring  over some field  is finitely generated. Nagata published the conjecture in a 1959 paper in the American Journal of Mathematics, in which he presented a counterexample to Hilbert's 14th problem.

Statement
Nagata Conjecture. Suppose  are very general points in  and that  are given positive integers. Then for  any curve  in  that passes through each of the points  with multiplicity  must satisfy

The condition  is necessary:  The cases  and  are distinguished by whether or not the anti-canonical bundle on the blowup of  at a collection of  points is nef. In the case where , the cone theorem essentially gives a complete description of the cone of curves of the blow-up of the plane.

Current status
The only case when this is known to hold is when  is a perfect square, which was proved by Nagata. Despite much interest, the other cases remain open.  A more modern formulation of this conjecture is often given in terms of Seshadri constants and has been generalised to other surfaces under the name of the Nagataâ€“Biran conjecture.
