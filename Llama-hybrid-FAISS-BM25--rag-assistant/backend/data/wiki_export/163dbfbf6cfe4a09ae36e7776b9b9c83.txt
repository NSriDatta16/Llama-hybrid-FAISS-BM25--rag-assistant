Shinola was a rock band from Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States, that existed from 1994 to 1997, and was a regular mainstay in the burgeoning local indie-rock scene of the time. Employing two guitars, electrified violin, drums, bass guitar, and occasionally Farfisa organ and banjo, their sound drew simultaneously on country/folk and punk rock influences. The band brandished left-wing politics on its album art, website and flyers, but lyrically most of its songs focused on heartbreak.

They recorded the single "Vodka" (b/w "Who's a Fuck-up?") on Backporch Revolution, which was released it in 1996. The record was accorded a favorable review by Billboard Magazine and other periodicals. The band had over 30 songs, but never released a full-length album. A compilation of singles, demos, and live recordings was released after the band broke up in 1997.
