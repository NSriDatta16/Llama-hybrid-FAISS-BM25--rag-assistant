In the video game series Super Smash Bros. up until Super Smash Bros. Brawl, a large fan (called "" in the Japanese version, but simply "Fan" in the English version) is a usable item. Characters can wield it as a very fast weapon, causing minimal but repeated and nigh-unstoppable damage to enemy characters. The item's trophy in Brawl mentions its origin as a  prop. Additionally, in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Banjo & Kazooie's aforementioned "Breegull Bash" attack returns as a part of their moveset, with director Masahiro Sakurai making a remark during a September 2019 presentation for Banjo & Kazooie about the move's Japanese name being "Harisen Kazooie" while also mentioning its original English name.
