Life
He was a carpenter by trade, but entered into real estate in Louisville and became wealthy. He held various public offices in Louisville and Jefferson County, including city tax collector, constable, sheriff and deputy marshall of the chancery court. He was the first mayor to serve under a new city charter that allowed a two-year term for mayors, as opposed to the earlier single-year term.

During his first term, the city experienced a Cholera epidemic, and Delph lead a push for better sanitation in Louisville. Though a member of the Whig Party during his first term, he became a Unionist and staunch supporter of the Union during and after that term.

He served a term in the state legislature after his second term as mayor. He was a founder of Walnut Street Baptist Church.

Delph died on December 15, 1891, in Louisville. He is buried in Cave Hill Cemetery.
