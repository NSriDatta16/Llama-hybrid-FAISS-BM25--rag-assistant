Biography
Bing grew up in Trondheim, Norway. After graduating with a degree at Trondheim Cathedral School, Bing began studying at the University of Oslo. Bing was awarded his PhD in law in 1982. Together with Tor Åge Bringsværd and other students at the University of Oslo, Jon Bing started the Aniara society, a club for science fiction fans. He was often profiled in the media around the topic. He published several books, both fiction and non-fiction specialist literature.

He was a much-loved public figure, often offering opinions on digital media, copyright, science fiction, etc. He was outspoken about cases concerning ethics in technology, copyright, and the future in general.
