History
Tottenham High Road follows, for the whole of its length, the course of the erstwhile Roman road, Ermine Street. The road became an important thoroughfare between London and Cambridge attracting inns, almshouses and residential properties to be established at strategic points. By the 16th century large country retreats leased by affluent Londoners could be found on the high road. From 1800-1850 new roads were built connecting to the high road, which provided better accessibility to London, bringing professionals into the area, causing the population to grow rapidly over the proceeding decades.   In 1881 North London Tramways Co. opened a  tramway from Edmonton to Stamford Hill along Tottenham High Road
