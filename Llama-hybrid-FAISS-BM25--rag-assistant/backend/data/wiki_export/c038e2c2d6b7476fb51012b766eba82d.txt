History
Wakatomika Creek takes its name from the Shawnee village of Wakatomika, which was located at the mouth of Wakatomika Creek along the Muskingum River, at about the present-day site of Dresden, Ohio. The village was destroyed during Lord Dunmore's War in 1774. After the American Revolution, the valley along Wakatomika Creek was one of the first areas in present-day Muskingum County to be settled by white Americans. The Longaberger Basket Company maintained a large facility in the Wakatomika Valley between Frazeysburg and Dresden.
