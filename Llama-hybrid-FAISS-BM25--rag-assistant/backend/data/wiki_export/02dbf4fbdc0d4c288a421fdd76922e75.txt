Home media
Traditionally, Live from Lincoln Center has never been made available on home video due to rights issues. A notable exception was a series of selected classic episodes licensed to Paramount Home Video and released under the "Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts Presents" banner through its Bel Canto Video division in the late '80s. Kultur International Films also released a few episodes on videocassette without any branding.
