History

Magellan was formed in 1996 from the remains of Fleet Industries, a subsidiary of the US-based Fleet Aerospace located in Fort Erie, Ontario. They produced products and services for the Canadian military, as well as subassemblies for aviation companies.

Through the 1990s, Magellan expanded, buying a number of Canadian aviation companies. These included:

 Orenda Aerospace (c. 1946 and now Magellan Aerospace, Mississauga) in Mississauga and acquired in 1997
 Bristol Aerospace (c. 1930) of Winnipeg and acquired in 1997 and now Magellan Aerospace, Winnipeg)
 Chicopee Manufacturing Limited (c. 1953) and now Magellan Aerospace, Kitchener in Kitchener, Ontario 
 Haley Industries (c. 1952) of Haley Station, Ontario, and acquired 2002 and now Magellan Aerospace, Haley. 

Several US companies were also added, including Aeronca  Magellan Aerospace Middleton, (formerly part of the US-based portions of Fleet), AMBEL Precision Manufacturing, Ellanef Manufacturing, (Magellan Aerospace New York) Middleton Aerospace (Magellan Aerospace, Haverhill) and Presto Casting Company (Magellan Aerospace, Glendale). They also purchased the assets of Mayflower Aerospace in England, becoming Magellan Aerospace UK in 2003.
The Fleet Aerospace division was closed in 2003, was sold, and later re-opened as Fleet Canada Inc.  Magellan Aerospace is now an integrated, international company and all of its subsidiaries are wholly owned, operating under the Magellan name.
