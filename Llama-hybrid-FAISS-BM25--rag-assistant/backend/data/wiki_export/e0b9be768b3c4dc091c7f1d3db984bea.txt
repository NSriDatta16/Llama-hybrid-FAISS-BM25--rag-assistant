WaterTower Music (formerly New Line Records from 2000 to 2010) is an American record label serving as the in-house music label and run by entertainment company Warner Bros., ultimately owned by Warner Bros. Discovery. The name and logo are based on the iconic Warner Bros. Water Tower.

History 
It was founded in 2000 as New Line Records by Jason Linn.

On January 15, 2010, New Line Records was renamed as WaterTower Music with Linn now also reporting to Paul Broucek, president, music, Warner Bros. Pictures. In March 2010, the company switched distribution from Warner Music Group's Alternative Distribution Alliance to Fontana, Universal Music Group's independent distributor.

In 2019, the distribution changed back to ADA, effectively reuniting WMG with former parent Warner Bros.
