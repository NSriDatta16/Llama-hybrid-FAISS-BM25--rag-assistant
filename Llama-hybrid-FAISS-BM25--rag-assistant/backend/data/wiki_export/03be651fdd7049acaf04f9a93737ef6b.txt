Noga Alon (; born 1956) is an Israeli mathematician and a professor of mathematics at Princeton University noted for his contributions to combinatorics and theoretical computer science, having authored hundreds of papers.

Education and career 
Alon was born in 1956 in Haifa, where he graduated from the Hebrew Reali School in 1974. He graduated summa cum laude from the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology in 1979, earned a master's degree in mathematics in 1980 from Tel Aviv University, and received his Ph.D. in Mathematics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1983 with the dissertation Extremal Problems in Combinatorics supervised by Micha Perles.

After postdoctoral research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology he returned to Tel Aviv University as a senior lecturer in 1985, obtained a permanent position as an associate professor there in 1986, and was promoted to full professor in 1988. He was head of the School of Mathematical Science from 1999 to 2001, and was given the Florence and Ted Baumritter Combinatorics and Computer Science Chair, before retiring as professor emeritus and moving to Princeton University in 2018.

He was editor-in-chief of the journal Random Structures and Algorithms beginning in 2008.

Research 
Alon has published more than five hundred research papers, mostly in combinatorics and in theoretical computer science, and one book, on the probabilistic method. He has also published under the pseudonym "A. Nilli", based on the name of his daughter Nilli Alon.

His research contributions include the combinatorial Nullstellensatz, an algebraic tool with many applications in combinatorics; color-coding, a technique for fixed-parameter tractability of pattern-matching algorithms in graphs; and the Alon–Boppana bound in spectral graph theory.

 2008 – Israel Prize, for mathematics.
 2011 – EMET Prize, with Saharon Shelah, for mathematics.
 2019 – Paris Kanellakis Award, with Phillip Gibbons, Yossi Matias and Mario Szegedy, "for foundational work on streaming algorithms and their application to large scale data analytics"
 2021 – Leroy P. Steele Prize for Mathematical Exposition, with Joel Spencer, for The Probabilistic Method
 2022 – Shaw Prize in Mathematical Sciences, with Ehud Hrushovski, "for their remarkable contributions to discrete mathematics and model theory with interaction notably with algebraic geometry, topology and computer sciences"
 2022 – Knuth Prize, "for foundational contributions in combinatorics and graph theory and applications to fundamental topics in computer science"

Alon gave plenary addresses in the 1996 European Congress of Mathematics and in the 2002 International Congress of Mathematicians, the 2009 Turán Memorial Lectures, and a lecture in the 1990 International Congress of Mathematicians. In 2015 he gave the Łojasiewicz Lecture (on the "Signrank and its applications in combinatorics and complexity") at the Jagiellonian University in Kraków. He was given an honorary doctorate by ETH Zurich in 2013 and by the University of Waterloo in 2015.

In addition, Alon has been a member of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities since 1997. He was elected to the Academia Europaea in 2008. In 2015 he was elected as a fellow of the American Mathematical Society. In 2017 he became a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery. In 2019 he was named an honorary member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.
