Western attention
In 2003, the Peabody Essex Museum, in Salem, Massachusetts, completed a 200 million dollar renovation and expansion, designed by architect Moshe Safdie, moving a 200-year-old 16-room Chinese house from Xiuning County to the grounds of the Museum. While in China this house was home to many generations who made a living in traveling to Shanghai and running a pawn brokers business (as stated by the movie shown at the Peabody Essex Museum after exiting Yin Yu Tang House).

In early 2008, the BBC broadcast a series of 5 documentaries on the life of pupils at schools in China. Called "Chinese School", the three schools documented were all located in Xiuning County: Xiuning High School, the top school in the county; Haiyang Middle/High School; and Ping Min Elementary School. This series was shown on BBC 4 and was received with mixed reactions, most of which were positive.
