He lived in North Eaton until his family moved to Oberlin, Ohio, where he attended Oberlin Academy. Fauver father was a prominent citizen in Lorain County, Ohio, where he served as Lorain County commissioner and Mayor of the town of Oberlin. Clayton Fauver had several siblings including Alfred Fauver, a former Lorain County Surveyor, Louis B. Fauver who played football with Clayton Fauver at Oberlin, and twin brothers, Edward Fauver and Edgar Fauver, who were both were well-known coaches and college athletic administrators.

College student and athlete
Fauver entered Oberlin College in 1893 and graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1897. He was active on campus including being on the debate team, assistant editor of the student newspaper and manager of the annual yearbook. A talented athlete, he played varsity football and baseball and was captain of the football team in 1893 and 1894, and captain of the baseball team in 1896.

Football player
Fauver earned a varsity letter in football at Oberlin in 1892, 1893, 1894 and 1895.
In 1892, Fauver was not a student at the college but a student at the Oberlin Academy, a college predatory school run by the college. He still played on the college football team, which included his brother Louis B. Fauver, a 24-year-old freshman, and was coached by John W. Heisman. This team was captained by its quarterback Carl Sheldon Williams and finished the season undefeated with a record of 7–0 including a season with an opening victory over Ohio State University After winning its first six games against teams from Ohio, Oberlin crossed the border to play regional power Michigan. In a controversial game known for rough and dirty play, including a Michigan player being kicked out for punching an Oberlin player and the Umpire, Oberlin claimed a 24 to 22 win Because of injuries to other players, Fauver helped the Yoeman effort by playing two positions. In middle game he moved from left tackle to right tackle. The game ended with a dispute over the time remaining. Oberlin contended the game was over resulting in an Oberlin win. Michigan contended there was still time left. Oberlin left the field so they could catch a train back to Ohio. Michigan stayed on the field and ran a play with no opposition that resulted in a touchdown. Both teams claimed victory. Oberlin finished the season with a 16–0 victory over Western Reserve.

In 1893, Fauver was elected captain of the varsity football team after Will Merriam resigned. The team was coached by Everett B. Camp and finished with a 6–1 record including victories over Ohio State, Chicago and Illinois. Fauver helped by scoring a touchdown against Ohio State and blocking a punt against Chicago. Oberlin won the first 6 games but lost the last one to Case Institute of Technology by a score of 8–22. The team was hampered by injuries and lack of practice due to exams. The injuries forced Fauver to move from the line to the backfield for the game.

Before the 1894 season Fauver brought national attention to Oberlin by being featured in Spalding Athletic Equipment Company football guide. The 1894 Oberlin Yeoman were again coached by John W. Heisman. Fauver once again was elected captain, but Heisman moved him from the tackle to right halfback. The team finished with a record of 4–3–1. Fauver was injured late in season in a loss to Adelbert College, also known then as Western Reserve. He missed the Michigan game but returned to his right half back position for a victory over Penn State University. This victory was short lived when Walter Camp later overruled the game officials allowing a game winning kick by Penn State.

Fauver once again played on Oberlin varsity football team in 1895. The team finished with a record of 4–1–1 under former Yale University player William M. Richards. The record allowed it to self proclaim the team as champion of Ohio.

In 1895, before he graduated from Oberlin, Fauver was hired by Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, to coach the football team. He arrived two days before the Wittenberg game and stay three weeks. In addition to coaching, Fauver also suited up and played in games. The Miami University student newspaper praised his play versus Wittenberg for being "in almost every play" and credited him for knocking down six player in one play. Fauver is credited with an undefeated record of 3–0 with victories over Wittenberg, Butler, and Cincinnati.
