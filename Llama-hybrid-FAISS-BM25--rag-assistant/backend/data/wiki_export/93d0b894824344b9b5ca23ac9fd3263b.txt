There have been two baronetcies created for members of the Bowater family, both in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom. Both creations are extant as of 2010.

The Bowater baronetcy, of Hill Crest in the Borough of Croydon, was created in 1914 for Vansittart Bowater, Lord Mayor of London (a one-year office) from 1913 to 1914.

The Bowater baronetcy, of Friston in the County of Suffolk, was created in 1939 for Frank Bowater, a paper entrepreneur and Lord Mayor of London 1938–1939. He was the younger brother of the above. His son, the second Baronet was Lord Mayor of London 1953–1954.

Frederick Bowater (1856–1924), fourth son of William Vansittart Bowater and brother of the above Baronets was created a KBE (knight) in 1920. His son, Sir Eric Vansittart Bowater (1895–1962), was Director-General of the Ministry of Aircraft Production between 1940 and 1943 and was knighted in 1944.

Sir Ian Bowater, second son of the second-created Baronet, was Lord Mayor of London from 1969 to 1970.
