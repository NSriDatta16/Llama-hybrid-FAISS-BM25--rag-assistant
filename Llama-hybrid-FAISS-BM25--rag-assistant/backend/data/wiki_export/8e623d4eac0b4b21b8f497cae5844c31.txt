The 1995 UEFA Intertoto Cup was the first edition of the tournament administered by the UEFA.  It saw Strasbourg and Bordeaux win their semi-finals to advance to the UEFA Cup, the latter eventually finishing runners-up. It also saw English representatives Wimbledon and Tottenham Hotspur banned from European competition for the following season, after both had fielded under-strength sides in their respective Intertoto Cup matches. The ban was lifted on appeal but England were still forced to forfeit their UEFA Fair Play berth for the 1996–97 UEFA Cup.

The 1995 competition also saw the return of Yugoslav clubs on the international scene after three years of ban due to UN embargo. However both representatives, FK Bečej and FK Budućnost, were eliminated in the group stage.
