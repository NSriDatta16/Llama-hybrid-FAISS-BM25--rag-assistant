Newshour is BBC World Service's flagship international news and current affairs radio programme, which is broadcast twice daily: weekdays at 1400, weekends at 1300 and nightly at 2100 (UK time). There is also an additional online programme at 20:00 on weekdays. Occasionally the programme can run for three hours during major breaking stories such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Each edition lasts one hour. It consists of news bulletins on the hour and half hour, international interviews and in-depth reports of world news. The BBC World Service considers it one of their most important programmes. In 2011 it was kept as one of four key outlets, despite severe cutbacks. It is also broadcast in the United States on various American Public Media stations. Most prominently, WNYC simulcasts the programme's afternoon edition on weekdays, and the nightly edition on weekends. The programme is broadcast live from Broadcasting House in London. It covers the major news of the day, often interviewing heads of state and government ministers.
