The city was originally called Lar after the person who had first established the city. Lar (لاڑ) is the name of one of Shahnameh's famous heroes. Around 16th and 17th centuries, Lar was considered to be a major stop along the road to the Persian Gulf.

Civilization 
Lar city is divided into two areas: new-city (called Shahre-jadid) and old-city (called Shahre-ghadim). New-city, which was constructed after the historical earthquake of 1960, now accommodates the main population and is considered to be modern in terms of civil and transport engineering (e.g. dead-ends are very rare). The Old city contains the Bazaar of Qaisariye, a pre-Safavid dynasty creation, that was proposed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site on August 9, 2007.

Transport 

As the Department of Roads & transport & some other centres are situated in city of Lar, an interesting aspect of it is building & construction of a modern expressway between the city of Lar and a police station 10 km from the city of Gerash, but in the cost of cutting most spending from other town & villages' roads in the region & it costs human life in the road accidents in the regions which happens almost daily & have high fatality rates. The  6-lane expressway has been fully upgraded with high luminous lighting and high quality pavement to facilitate the transportation needs of people of Lar town but the cost is paid by cutting almost all other funds for repairs & making new roads in the area who are governed by Lar Road & Transport Department in Lar.
