History
Ancient Suyyapura, founded by a reputed Kashmiri engineer Suyya during the reign of Raja Awantivarma (855-883 A.D.) and commemorating his name, is undoubtedly the town known now as Sopore.

J.P. Ferguson in his book entitled 'Kashmir' remarks "Suyya stands out as a person hundreds of years in advance of his time". It is because of the technical intelligence and real skill he possessed and applied for draining off the flood water which could find no outlet and had made the cultivation of land impossible with the result that famine like condition prevailed in the whole of the valley. That is why, in the light of the results achieved by this great engineer, he has been regarded as an incarnation of Lord of Food himself by the great historian Kalhana in his book 'Rajatarangini'. Suyya's reputation attracted many persons who also settled at the place he resided and which eventually came to be known as Suyyapura, meaning the place where Suyya settled. With the passage of time and constant use, the pronunciation of the name was distorted into Sopore by which it is known at present.

M.A. Stein, the English translator of Kalhanas 'Rajatarangini' in his book 'Memoir on maps illustrating the Ancient Geography of Kashmir' published in 1899, (p-208) while writing about Sopore town remarks: Sopore which lies a short distance below the point where the Vitasta leaves the Wular, has retained its importance to this day and still a town of over 8,000 inhabitants. It has during recent times been the official headquarter for the whole of Kumraz. From a passage of Srivara it appears that this had been the case already at an earlier period. Relating a great conflagration which destroyed Suyyapura in Zain-ul-Abidin's time, this chronicle tells us that in it perished the whole of the official archives relating to Kamarajya. The royal residence, however, escaped and the town itself was again built up by the Kingin greate splendour. Of this, however, nothing has remained; nor does the town now show older remains of any interest." As will be clear from the history of the town narrated above, there is no trace left of any historical buildings or ancient monuments which could throw some light on the past. It is quite likely that the ancient remains might have been destroyed in the conflagration that broke out during the reign of Zain-ul-Abdin (1420-1470 A.D.). A reference about an attack and this conflagration during the reign of Zain-ul-Abdin has also been given in Kashmir Under the Sultans (p-77 and 95) written by Mohibbul Hassan in these words:-

"Adham attacked Sopur in 1459. Its governor offered resistance, but Adham defeated and killed him and destroyed the town. Hearing of this, the Sultan sent a large army to Sopur. After heavy fighting Adham was routed. And as his followers were fleeing across the Jhelum at Sopur, the bridge gave way, and three hundred of them were drowned in the river. After the Sultan himself proceeded to Sopur and consoled the inhabitants on their sufferings. During the later part of his reign the town of Sopur was destroyed by fire. The Sultan built there a palace with the materials of the one at Baramulla, which was pulled down. He also constructed in the town a swinging bridge". The swinging bridge continued to be the sole communication link across the river until 1955 when it was discarded in favour of an R.C.C. bridge constructed about half a mile down stream. Lately the old bridge has also been reconstructed and thrown open to traffic.
