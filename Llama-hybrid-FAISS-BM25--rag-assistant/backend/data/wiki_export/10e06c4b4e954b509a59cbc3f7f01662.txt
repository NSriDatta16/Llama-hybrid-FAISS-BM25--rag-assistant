Structure
Wethersfield High School originally opened in 1952, with several small renovations taking place in 1957, 1970, and 1993. The current school building standing on the property is a multi-story brick modern-style structure. By the 2010s the school did not meet current educational curriculum requirements, did not address current safety standards, and was not code compliant for individuals with disabilities. The aging building was evaluated and a referendum was passed for a "Renovate As New" construction plan. The renovation started in October 2013 with a planned completion date of April 2017. It was fully completed by January 2017.
