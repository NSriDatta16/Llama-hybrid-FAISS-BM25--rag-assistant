Eko gained high popularity during the rock 'n' roll craze of the 1960s, becoming the largest guitar exporter in Europe. Their electric models were often highly ornamented with pearl, featured 3 or 4 pickups and recognizable "rocker" switches for pickup selection. The acoustic models were popular in country and folk rock bands of the late '60s. The best-known models of the '60s include:

 Eko 400 Ekomaster (Fender Jaguar shape with flat-top,  Hagstr√∂m-style control panel),
 Eko 500 (Fender Jaguar lookalike),
 Eko 700 (original triple-cutaway design with "hockey stick" head),
 Eko 290 (also known as Eko Barracuda, semi-hollow flat-top electric),
 Eko Rokes (rocket-shaped electric, made popular by an Italian pop band of the same name, The Rokes)
