}}TNA Global Impact! is an online professional wrestling show produced by Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) that existed in 2006. Global Impact!, which was hosted by TNA interviewers Jeremy Borash and Christy Hemme, featured "exclusive footage, interviews, news updates, matches and more".

History

Original segmentsGlobal Impact! originated in TNA in 2005. Segments displayed the worldwide "Impact!" of TNA, with an unseen Jeremy Borash providing a voice-over. These segments included TNA performers appearing in promotions and tours of different countries, and various happenings in TNA.

Online show
On April 24, 2006, TNA announced that it would be converting Global Impact! into a weekly webcast show as of May 3, 2006 as part of an agreement between TNA and YouTube. Jeremy Borash was announced as the onscreen host, with Christy Hemme to co-host the inaugural broadcast. TNA website manager Bill Banks (who helped launch similar online shows such as WWE Byte This! and WCW Reload''), was expected to have a large behind-the-scenes role.

This agreement would be short-lived after high viewership caused the YouTube server to crash, future episodes were hosted on TNA's official website.

On August 19, 2006, the show was put on hold with no real reason given. Instead, TNA switched to providing information in the form of an audio podcast.

Television revival
On December 14, 2007, Spike TV issued a press release which indicated that TNA would hold a one-hour special in January of the following year entitled "Global Impact!". The show would feature taped matches involving TNA wrestlers competing at the Wrestle Kingdom II New Japan Pro-Wrestling Tokyo Dome show on January 4, including Kurt Angle facing Yuji Nagata for the IGF's version of the IWGP Heavyweight Championship.

The show aired on Thursday, January 17, 2008 at 11:00pm EST following the weekly episode of TNA Impact!. According to TNA's recent contract renewal with Spike TV, it is expected that this will be the first of several occasional special-airing shows.

DVD release
On February 28, 2008, TNA released the first Global Impact! special from Japan on DVD.
