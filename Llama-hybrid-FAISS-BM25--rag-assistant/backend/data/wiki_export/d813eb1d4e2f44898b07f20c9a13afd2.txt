Alison Jane Streeter MBE is a British long-distance swimmer.

Biography
Streeter has swum across the English Channel 43 times, the most crossings done by an individual until surpassed by Chloe McCardel on 13 October 2021. She also completed seven Channel crossings in one year. Her 1988 Channel swim, from France to England, set a female record of 8 hours 48 minutes. She was the first woman to swim the Channel three ways non-stop in 1990, taking 34h40 min for the feat.

In 1988, Streeter became the first woman to swim across the North Channel, between Northern Ireland and Scotland, a feat she repeated in 1989 and 1997. She currently holds the record for the highest number of crossings.

She formerly worked as a currency trader in London, and now spends part of her life in Adelaide (Seacliff) and the summers in Dover as a Channel Swim boat pilot.

The Queen appointed Streeter a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1991 Birthday Honours for her swimming prowess and charity fundraising. To date she has raised over £100,000 for various charities.

In May 2006, she was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame.
