The Pratt & Whitney Canada PW500 is a series of medium thrust turbofan engines designed specifically for business jet applications.

Design
The PW530 has a single stage fan, driven by a 2-stage LP turbine, supercharging a 2A/1CF axial-centrifugal HP compressor, driven by a single stage HP turbine.
Although similar in configuration, the PW535 has a booster stage, mounted on the LP shaft behind the fan, to increase overall pressure ratio and core flow.
Similar to the PW535, the PW545 has an additional LP turbine stage to drive a larger diameter fan.

Development

The PW530A, rated at , entered service in February 1997 on the Cessna Citation II Bravo, and the PW545 in July 1998 on the Cessna Citation Excel.
The PW535 powered the Cessna Citation V Encore in September 2000, and was selected for the Embraer Phenom 300, first delivered in December 2009.

On 31 January 2020, Embraer announced improvements to its Phenom 300, including increased speeds and upgraded engines. The engines, designated PW535E1, are rated at /

Unveiled at the May 2023 EBACE show, the FADEC-controlled PW545D is developed for the Cessna 560XL Ascend variant, to be rated at  and optimized for improved fuel burn and longer time between overhauls (TBO) up to 6,000 hours.
By then, 4,600 PW500s had been produced and had flown 22 million hours.
