Reception
Andrew Rilstone reviewed The Best of the Star Wars Adventure Journal for Arcane magazine, rating it a 4 out of 10 overall. Rilstone comments that "If you like the writing of Zahn and Tyers, then this book is probably worth having for the fiction; but if it's roleplaying material you are after, there are better things to spend your credits on."
