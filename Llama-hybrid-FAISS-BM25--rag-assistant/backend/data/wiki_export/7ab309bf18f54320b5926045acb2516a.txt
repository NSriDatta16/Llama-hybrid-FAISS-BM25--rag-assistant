The Miss New Jersey USA competition is the pageant that selects the representative for the state of New Jersey in the Miss USA pageant. It is produced by D&D Productions.

New Jersey has yet to win the Miss USA title, although from 1989 to 1991 they had two 2nd runners-up and one 1st runner-up in a row.  Two years later, another Miss New Jersey USA placed in the finals, and in 2008, Tiffany Andrade finished as 2nd runner up, one of three Miss New Jersey USAs to place third at Miss USA. In the year 2017, 1st runner-up placement was achieved by Miss New Jersey USA 2017, Chhavi Verg. The most recent placement was Derby Chukwudi in 2023, placing Top 20.

Five Miss New Jersey USA titleholders have held the Miss New Jersey Teen USA title and two have competed at Miss America.
