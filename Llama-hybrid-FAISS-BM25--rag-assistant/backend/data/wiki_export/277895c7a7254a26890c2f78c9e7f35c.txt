Justin Foley is an American musician and the drummer of the metalcore band Killswitch Engage. He is also a former member of the band Blood Has Been Shed along with Killswitch Engage's former lead singer, Howard Jones.

Early life 
Foley is a classically trained percussionist who attended the University of Connecticut for his bachelor's degree and the University of Hartford's Hartt School for his master's degree.

Career 
Before joining Killswitch Engage, Foley participated in a Connecticut band called Red Tide. Red Tide began as a thrash metal outfit in 1993 then evolved into a jazz metal band in the late 1990s. As the primary lyricist and one of the songwriters for Red Tide, Foley earned local celebrityhood. With Red Tide, Foley released at least five demo tapes and two CDs. Red Tide disbanded in 2002 as there was a general lack of interest in continuing (cited by interview).

Foley joined Killswitch Engage after the departure of the previous drummer, Tom Gomes, in October 2003. Foley has played drums on six albums with Killswitch Engage, to date.

Foley is one of the many advertising artists for Evans Drumheads, Yamaha Drums, and Zildjian Cymbals.

Foley also plays drums on metalcore band Unearth's 2011 album, Darkness in the Light, filling in for departed drummer Derek Kerswill.

Foley started Lybica, a four-piece instrumental post-rock/metal band, in 2020. His primary role is guitarist, but he played both guitar and drums on their self-titled album, which was released on September 16, 2022. Lybica is signed with Metalblade Records.

Personal life 
Foley has been quoted as saying that if he did not play drums, he would like to try out for the New York Yankees, of whom he is a fan. He is also a Simpsons fanatic. Foley is known for his love of cats, a major inspiration for the band Lybica, where Foley plays guitar.
