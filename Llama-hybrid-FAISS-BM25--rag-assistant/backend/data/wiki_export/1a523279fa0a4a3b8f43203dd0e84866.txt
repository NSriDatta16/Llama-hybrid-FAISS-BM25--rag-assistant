Weston is a neighbourhood in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, located south of the Canadian Pacific Railway Weston Yards, west of McPhillips Street, north of Notre Dame Avenue, and east of Keewatin Street. It is a working-class residential and industrial district with some retail establishments along Logan Avenue and on Keewatin Street.

Historically, the neighbourhood was nicknamed "CPR Town" due to the large number of railway workers who resided there. As the number of jobs at the Weston Shops declined, correspondingly, so did the neighbourhood. About 80% of the housing stock was constructed before 1960.
