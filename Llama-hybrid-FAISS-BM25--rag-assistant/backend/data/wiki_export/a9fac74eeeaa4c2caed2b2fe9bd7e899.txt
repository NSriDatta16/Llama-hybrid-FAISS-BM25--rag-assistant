Lima Senior High School, the only high school in the Lima City Schools District, was established in 1955, in Lima, Ohio. There are approximately 1,500 students currently enrolled at Lima Senior.

Overview 
Lima Senior remained in the same building for 49 years until a new building was constructed over two years and completed in 2004. The new Lima Senior High School building contained three small learning communities, consisting of the Performance Based School, the Progressive Academy, and the School of Multiple Intelligences. Each small school followed an instructional model of teaching core subjects of Ohio class requirements. As of the 2013-14 school year, Lima Senior High School has transitioned into a single institution, dissolving the three small schools. Spartan Stadium, home to the Lima Senior Spartans, is a registered historic building listed in the National Register on 2002-03-21.

In 1987, Lima Senior High School began formally recognizing the accomplishments of its alumni who had received local, state or national recognition for achievements in their occupational fields, made significant contributions to society, or performed meritorious service for our country by inducting them into the Lima Senior High School Distinguished Alumni Hall of Fame. In 1990 the Hall of Fame was opened up to all students in the Lima City School District and the name was changed to the Lima City Schools Distinguished Hall of Fame. There are currently 87 alumni honored in the Hall of Fame. Every four years, ten to fifteen outstanding alumni are inducted into the Hall of Fame during an induction ceremony and banquet. All Hall of Fame inductees have their portraits displayed in Lima Senior Highschool's cafeteria.

Lima Senior's mascot is the Spartan. They are members of the Three Rivers Athletic Conference. Sports consist of football, cross country, boys and girls soccer, volleyball, boys and girls basketball, wrestling, boys and girls swimming, indoor and outdoor track, baseball, boys and girls bowling, and boys and girls lacrosse.
