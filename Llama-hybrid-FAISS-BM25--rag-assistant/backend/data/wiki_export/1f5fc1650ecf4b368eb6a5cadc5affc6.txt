The Saidina Abu Bakar As Siddiq Mosque (MSABA) () is a prominent mosque in Bangsar, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The mosque was named after Muhammad's successor (Caliph) Abu Bakr.

History
In 1976, the people of Bangsar began to request for a mosque. It was approved by the Federal Territory Islamic Religious Council on 25 November 1977. A meeting was held by local representatives with YB Datuk Othman Abdullah on 27 November 1977.

It received RM700,000 as donations collected from the public. The government took over the project and placed it under the 3rd Malaysian 5-Year Plan. Planning for the construction of the mosque began in 1979 and completed in March 1982.

The site was officially handed over to the contractor 18 July 1980. The direction of the qiblat was consented by The Mufti of the Federal Territories, S.S. Datuk Sheikh Abdul Mohsein bin Haji Salleh on 24 August 1980. Ground levelling work started in September 1980.

The mosque was handed over officially to the government on 29 March 1982. Its official opening ceremony was officiated by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, Sultan Ahmad Shah ibni Almarhum Sultan Abu Bakar on 15 July 1982.

Architecture and features
It was originally designed for up to 3,500 people, but after expansion work done in 2009 and 2010, it can accommodate 500 more.
