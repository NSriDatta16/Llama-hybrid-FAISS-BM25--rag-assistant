Lethargic Lad is a protagonist in the comic strip of the same name, created by Greg Hyland sometime in the late 1980s.  The character is notable for being very slow and inactive. Lethargic Lad does not speak, though he sometimes mutters "Umm...".

Comics
Lethargic Lad is the name of both a comic and a comic book character created by Canadian artist Greg Hyland. Hyland created the character in high school as a doodle, and beginning in 1988, he featured the character in a photocopied anthology mini-comic called Lethargic Comics Weakly. This anthology, which was rounded out with contributions from fellow animation students (and one instructor) at Sheridan College, lampooned superhero comics, and was sold to local animation and comics fans.

In June 1991, Lethargic Comics Weakly restarted its continuity in an internationally distributed, professional format independent black and white comic, which ran for 12 issues until June 1993. This was followed by the spin-off Tales of Lethargy, which ran for three issues beginning in August 1993, and featured "Gun Guy, Ghost Guy, and Guy With Claws." Publishing began again in January 1994 under the new title Lethargic Comics, which ran for 15 issues through June 1996. In June 1996, a three issue mini-series was released that dropped the anthology style of the comic. In a testament to the character's intense cult following, the cover to issue #3 of this mini-series was painted by Alex Ross as a parody of the DC Comics Kingdom Come series, which Ross himself had illustrated.

Lethargic Lad Adventures launched in October 1997. This series lasted 13 issues, being renamed Lethargic Lad with the third issue. The series featured an innovation: the actual story in the comic began right on the cover.

In April 2000, Greg Hyland launched lethargiclad.com and moved from doing a print comic book to doing a weekly webcomic, with each month's collection of webcomics considered one "issue." Some of these webcomics have been reprinted in irregular "jumbo-sized annuals" put out by John Kovalic's Dork Storm (publisher of the gaming satire/humor comic Dork Tower). More recently, books collecting the online webcomics have been put out by Mr. Hyland himself.

Currently, Lethargic Lad is a weekly webcomic posted on Sunday.

Greg Hyland has occasionally taken off time for other projects, as well as for the birth of his daughter.

Other projects include providing production art for licensed LEGO brand product and doing storyboarding for their animated shorts. Greg has worked in the past for Nelvana on such cartoons as Beetlejuice (TV series). He has also worked as an illustrator and colorist for Steve Jackson Games on card games including Munchkin Fu  and its expansion Munchkin Fu – Monky Business,  Ninja Burger,  and Burn In Hell.

The Lethargic Lad universe has many supporting and recurring characters lampooning much of the Marvel and DC catalogues.
