Hersha Parady (born Betty Sandhoff; May 25, 1945 â€“ August 23, 2023) was an American actress best known for her role of Alice Garvey in Little House on the Prairie.

Life and career 
Parady was born as Betty Sandhoff in Berea, Ohio, and attended Berea High School. She began acting locally at age 14 in Cleveland area theatrical productions. She moved west in the early 1970s to further her acting career and landed a role opposite Jon Voight in a touring production of A Streetcar Named Desire.

Parady began her career in television with guest-appearances in Mannix, Bearcats! and The Waltons. Hersha was considered to play Caroline Ingalls in Little House on the Prairie, but lost out to Karen Grassle.  Later, in 1976 episode "Journey in the Spring", Paraday played Eliza Anne Ingalls, Charles' sister-in-law.
Then, in 1977, she was given the role of Alice Garvey in Little House on the Prairie, which she played until 1980 when her character was killed in a fire accidentally set by Albert Quinn Ingalls. After Little House on the Prairie, she made only rare appearances in television, including Kenan & Kel.

Parady was once married to Oscar-winning producer John Peverall and had one child with him. 

Parady died of complications from a brain tumor in Norfolk, Virginia, on August 23, 2023. Her death was announced on Alison Arngrim's Facebook page.
