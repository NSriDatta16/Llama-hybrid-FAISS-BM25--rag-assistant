International match hosting problem
The venue hosted its last international match in 2006. Transportion problems, player's accommodation problems, are a few of problems for which Bangladesh Cricket Board preclude matches being hosted at the venue. Although the city has a domestic airport, it is maintained by the Bangladesh Air Force and needs prior approval for operations which makes it difficult to host international matches. The Bangladesh Cricket Board and the Government of Bangladesh are trying to solve problems related to hosting so that the venue can come back to host international matches as soon as possible.
