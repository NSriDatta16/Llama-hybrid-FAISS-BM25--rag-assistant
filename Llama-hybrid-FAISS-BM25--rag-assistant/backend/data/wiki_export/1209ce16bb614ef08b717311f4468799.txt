The House of Branković (,  Brankovići / Бранковићи, ) is a Serbian medieval noble family and dynasty. According to genealogies created in the first half of the 15th century, the family descends via female lineage, through marriage with the Nemanjić dynasty. The family rose to prominence during the fall of the Serbian Empire. The original family domains were centered in the Kosovo region. Later family members extended their rule over all remaining unconquered regions of Serbia making them the last sovereign rulers of medieval Serbian state. The dynasty ruled the Serbian Despotate from 1427 to 1459 and their descendants continue to claim the throne of the Despotate Serbia, some having entered the ranks of the Hungarian aristocracy, while other descendants of the dynasty continue to go by a courtesy title.

Members of the family intermarried with other noble houses from neighbouring countries including Austrian and Hungarian nobility, and provided at least one wife to Ottoman Sultan. By the 17th century, Branković blood had entered into the House of Habsburg, providing more descendants into the ruling houses of Europe. One such descendant was Maria of Yugoslavia, the wife of Alexander I of Yugoslavia. With the ascension of her son Peter II of Yugoslavia in 1934, Branković, Lazarević, and Nemanjić blood returned to the Serbian throne.

Some of the family members were:
Vuk Branković
Đurađ Branković (1427–1456)
Lazar Branković (1456–1458)
Stefan Branković (1458–1459)
