Season synopsis

Season 1
The series starts with new female recruit Morgan Cartwright (Georgie Parker) joining the ranks of South East Fire station in Brisbane. Morgan has to face prejudices in the male dominated profession, mainly from the icy platoon sergeant "Spit". Other characters include The Boss (Peter Phelps), Grievous, Banjo (Aaron Jeffrey), Dinosaur, Repo (Andy Anderson) and Giraffe.

The local arson squad also play a very prominent part from the beginning of season 1. Detective Sergeant Jean Diamond (Liddy Clark) has been investigating a series of fires for over a year, which she believes to actually be the work of a firefighter. Knowing that Morgan has just joined South East, Jean approaches Morgan and puts her theory to her. She asks that Morgan will be her "eyes and ears" in the fire station. This makes life complicated for Morgan.

Ultimately, Detective Diamond's theory is proved correct. It is revealed that one of the firefighters from South East has been lighting fires.

Season 1 was made with the cooperation of the Queensland Fire Service and their appliances were used during filming as well as their logos. The two main appliances used at South East were an International ACCO Teleboom and a Firepac appliance.

Season 2
Season 2 was centred on a different fire station. However, three fire fighters from the original series, Repo, Grievous and Spit, were retained and joined by new characters at West End fire station. After the death of Repo's father, he decides to apply for the rank of Station Officer at West End.  He gains the promotion much to the disgust of Spit, the Senior Station Officer. After some events that take place at fire scenes, Repo decides that he would be happier just being a firefighter. He steps down from the position of Station Officer and this vacancy is taken by Seldom, who has recently passed his tests.

Meanwhile, Tex finds out that she is pregnant and is confused as to what to do. She talks to Repo's wife, Dolores and her doctor and decides to terminate.

The station is a mix of various characters. Grievous is the womaniser who loves to fight fires and finds out that he has a son from the turkey baster incident in season 1. Nugget is the veteran who just likes to get on with the job.  Mary, the Army wannabe loves regiment and discipline and looks up to Spit. TNT is the union rep at the station who seems to always look on the negative side of everything (hence the nickname "Totally Negative Tommo").

Seldom gets himself into disciplinary trouble with Spit, when his vendetta against Jimmy Runyon (Kym Gyngell) becomes far more than job related. After TNT makes some disparaging remarks towards the Commissioner he finds himself transferred to the bush. His replacement is Greta Fazio who just happens to be Grievous' cousin. She is a bit of a daredevil (earning herself the nickname "Garbo") and takes a little while to settle in. She becomes involved in a sexual harassment case with Nugget, which ultimately ends in tragedy.

Season 2 was made without the support of the Queensland Fire Service. The made up name of Queensland Fire Brigade was used during this season with a different logo. Appliances used were purchased/loaned to make the show. The two main appliances used at West End were an International ACCO Pumper and a RFW Wormald Simon Snorkel appliance. The withdrawal of support by the Queensland Fire Service was the result of concerns raised by the United Firefighters Union and Fire Service management about the way firefighters and the fire service were portrayed in the first season.

Unlike Season 1, which featured 13 episodes, Season 2 only had six episodes, although Episode 5, "Vendetta", was divided into five parts, and episode 6, "War of the Worlds", into four, giving the season a total of 13 separate "episodes".
