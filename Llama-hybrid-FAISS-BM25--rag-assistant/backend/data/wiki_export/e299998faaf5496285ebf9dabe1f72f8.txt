Belogorsk () is a town in Amur Oblast, Russia, located on the river Tom, a tributary of the Zeya. Population:    53,000 (1969); 34,000 (1939).

The town was included in a list of towns at risk of social problems, including poverty and corruption. It was previously known as Alexandrovskoye (until 1926), Alexandrovsk (until 1931), Krasnopartizansk (until 1935), Kuybyshevka Vostochnaya (until 1957).

History
The selo of Alexandrovskoye () was founded in 1860 by the settlers from the European part of Russia. In 1893, the selo of Bochkaryovka () appeared nearby. The two localities grew with the construction of a station on the Trans-Siberian Railway in 1913, and by 1923 Alexandrovskoye and Bochkarevka merged and were transformed into Alexandrovsk (). Town status was granted to Alexandrovsk in 1926. In 1931, it was renamed Krasnopartizansk (), then, in 1935, Kuybyshevka-Vostochnaya (), to commemorate the Soviet statesman Valerian Kuybyshev. In 1957, possibly to reduce the number of localities named after Kuybyshev, the town was given its present name. While the literal meaning of the name is white mountains, the reasons for renaming are unclear, as the town stands on a plain with no "white mountains" anywhere in the vicinity. It is possible, however, that the name was due to the whitish color of the quartz sands of the bluffs on the Tom River, or that it was allegorical, with the meaning of a white town.
