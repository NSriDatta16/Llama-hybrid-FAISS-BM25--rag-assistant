Zirconium(II) hydride is a molecular chemical compound with the chemical formula . It is a grey crystalline solid or dark gray to black powder. It has been prepared by laser ablation and isolated at low temperature.

Zirconium(II) hydride has repeatedly been the subject of Dirac–Hartree–Fock relativistic calculation studies, which investigate the stabilities, geometries, and relative energies of hydrides of the formula , , , or MH.

Zirconium(II) hydride has a dihedral (C2v) structure. In zirconium(II) hydride, the formal oxidation states of zirconium and hydrogen are +2 and −1, respectively, because the electronegativity of zirconium is lower than that of hydrogen. The stability of metal hydrides with the formula  (M = Ti, Zr, Hf) decreases from Ti to Hf.

Uses
Zirconium(II) hydride is used as a thermal neutron moderator in nuclear reactors and as a material for neutron reflectors in fast reactors.

Zirconium(II) hydride in the form of a powder is used in powder metallurgy as a hydrogenation catalyst, vacuum tube getter, foaming agent in the production of metal foams and as a reducing agent.
