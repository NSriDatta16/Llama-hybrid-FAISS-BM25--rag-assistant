Arlow Burdette Stout (March 10, 1876 â€“ October 12, 1957) was an American botanist and the pioneer breeder of the modern hybrid daylily.

Stout was born in Jackson Center, Ohio on March 10, 1876 and moved to Albion, Wisconsin as a child. He worked between 1911 and 1948 at the New York Botanical Garden. In over 50,000 cross-pollination experiments, Stout produced over one hundred viable Hemerocallis hybrids, revolutionizing nursery breeding and popular interest in daylilies. Without a doubt, Stout's public renown rested largely on the knowledge and innovation he brought to the breeding of daylilies. He died at his home in Pleasantville, New York in 1957.

In 1950, American Hemerocallis Society established an annual Stout Award in his honor.
