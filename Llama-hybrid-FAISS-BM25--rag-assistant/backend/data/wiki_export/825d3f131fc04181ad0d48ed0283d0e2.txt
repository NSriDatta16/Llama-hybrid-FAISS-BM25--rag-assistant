The Provincial Towns Cup was established in 1888 and is one of the oldest trophies in existence in Irish rugby union.

The trophy itself was purchased in 1892 for Â£25 from Wests in Dublin and bears the title of Leinster Junior Challenge Cup.

In 1925, the Leinster branch of the Irish Rugby Football Union reorganized its junior competitions. The Leinster Junior Challenge Cup became the Provincial Towns Cup. This was now a knock-out competition for junior clubs from outside Dublin.
