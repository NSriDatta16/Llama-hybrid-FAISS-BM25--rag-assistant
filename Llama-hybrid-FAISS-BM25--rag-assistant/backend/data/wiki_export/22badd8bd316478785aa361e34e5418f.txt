New Clear Water Bay Road
New Clear Water Bay Road is an expressway deviation of Clear Water Bay Road in Kowloon near Choi Wan Estate and Shun Lee Estate. For the section below Kowloon Peak, Clear Water Bay Road is very steep and reaches the ratio of 1 in 6 It is difficult for buses ascending the incline. With the ever-increasing usage of the road due to population increases and the establishment of a country park in Sai Kung, the Hong Kong Government decided to build a new expressway diverging from the junction near Choi Wan Estate, then junctions with Shun Lee Tsuen Road at Shun Lee, then loops back over itself to climb the steep hill and then rejoins the original road at the junction with Anderson Road near Cha Liu Au. The new road was completed in 1980. The loop flyover runs from the hill north of Jordan Valley to Kowloon Peak, and it was the highest bridge in Hong Kong at that time.
