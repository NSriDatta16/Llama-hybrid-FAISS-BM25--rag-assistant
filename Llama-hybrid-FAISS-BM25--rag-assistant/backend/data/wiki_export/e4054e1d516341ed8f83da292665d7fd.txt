Stroodorp is a hamlet in the Dutch province of Zeeland. It is a part of the municipality of Noord-Beveland, and lies about 11Â km northeast of Middelburg.

The hamlet was first mentioned in 1847 as Strooijedorp (Het), and means "straw village" after the straw covering of the temporary houses of the people who poldered the land.
