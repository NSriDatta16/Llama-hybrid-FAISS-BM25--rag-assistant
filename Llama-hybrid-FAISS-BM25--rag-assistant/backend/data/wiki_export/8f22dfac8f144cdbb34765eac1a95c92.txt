History

1988-2003: Citylite

On July 26, 1986, the station was inaugurated as Citylite 88.3 with the call letters DWFR. It was owned by Francisco Ravina, along with 7 Board members at the launch of the station, namely Gerry Geronimo (host of Ating Alamin), Steve Salonga, Alex Limjuco, Kit Ravina, Francis Lumen, Bong Sierra and Mike Pedero, who was also the program director at the time.

Initially a Soft adult contemporary station, it played a smooth jazz track every hour. After several months, more jazz tracks were played than usual. In October 1988, it changed its call letters to DWCT, and became a fully fledged smooth jazz station, playing smooth jazz, contemporary pieces and rhythm and blues.

The station was initially manned by Pancho Alvarez, Pinky Aseron, Mike Taylor (Adam Kite), Ramon Cruz (Joey Pizza) and J. Zorrilla (Jlatin), with Eya Perdigon and Wickette handling the daily newscasts. It was also the official radio station of CNN and Asia Business News and was also affiliated with the American expats in the country. A few years later, 105.1 Crossover and Kiss Jazz 101.1 followed suit after the success of the station with the A and B crowd.

In October 1996, Citylite launched its live streaming on its website. After 2 years, Raven Broadcasting Corporation was acquired by the Vera family while Francis Lumen moved to Joey @ Rhythms 92.3. From March 2001 to June 2003, it was known as Smooth Jazz Citylite 88.3. On June 30, 2003, Citylite bid farewell with Eumir Deodato's "Love Island" as its swansong.

2003â€“present: Jam

On July 1, 2003, the station changed its call letters to DWJM and was relaunched as Jam 88.3 with a soft rock format to cater to a larger more advertiser-friendly audience. Ronaldo Sulit ("Joe D'Mango"), who was also responsible for managing sister station Wave 89.1, was the station manager until 2007, when he was replaced by Eric Perpetua. In 2005, it shifted to a modern adult contemporary format.

In 2011, Jam gradually shifted to a modern rock format, after the demise of the two defunct rock stations NU 107 and UR 105.9. On September 11, 2012, it was relaunched as The New Jam, launching a few new programs, such as WRXP: Weekend Rock XPerience.

Since 2013, the station became the home of playing songs from local and unsigned Filipino independent artists/bands through its supplemental program Fresh Filter. Some indie acts became popular (and eventually rise into mainstream) such as Autotelic, Bullet Dumas, Yolanda Moon and others. The program ended in March 2017 and was replaced by Locals Only, a program similar to Fresh Filter.

On October 3, 2022, Jam shifted its timeline, focusing on music from the 1990s and 2000s, with occasional songs from the 2010s to the present. A month prior, most of its programs were axed.
