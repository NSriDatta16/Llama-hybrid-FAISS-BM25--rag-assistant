He studied in Brno the Faculty of Civil Engineering of the Brno University of Technology. He used to come back home by train through Přerov, where he had to wait until the locomotive was changed. One day it was changed earlier and Loska almost missed the train. He tried to jump into the accelerating train, but he fell under it and lost his left arm.
