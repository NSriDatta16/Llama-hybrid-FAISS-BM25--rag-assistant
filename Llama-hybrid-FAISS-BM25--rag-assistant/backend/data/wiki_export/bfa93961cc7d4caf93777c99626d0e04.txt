Original 106fm was formerly a radio station broadcasting to the Solent region of southern England, centred on the towns and cities of Portsmouth, Southampton and Bournemouth, from its transmitters at Chillerton Down, Mannings Heath (Poole) and Crabwood Farm (Winchester). It was awarded its broadcast licence in September 2005 and launched on 1 October 2006 and ceased broadcasting on 30 September 2008.

The station broadcast an Adult Alternative format, with only 35% of its music coming from past or present Top 20 charts.

Original 106fm was notable for holding the first United Kingdom broadcast licence to be awarded to an overseas group when Canwest won the licence in 2005.  They sold it to Celador Radio Broadcasting in August 2008.

The station ceased broadcasting on 30 September 2008 and was replaced by Celedor's new station The Coast.

Licence breach and lifting
On 8 October 2007 OFCOM found Original 106 in breach of its licence.

"This Spot Sampling report was triggered following complaints received by Ofcom that
Original 106, the "Adult Alternative" station for the Solent region, is not delivering the
music policy set out in its Format.

After carrying out a detailed analysis of the music logs from three days of Original’s
output, we found that the station, which its Format states is "an album-led music
service", was clearly exceeding the percentage of Top 20 hit singles that its Format
permits it to play, and particularly during daytime hours. We concluded from our
analysis that an unacceptably high number of the music tracks being aired by
Original were mainstream pop records that do not sit happily with the station’s "Adult
Alternative" remit, and were therefore out-of-Format.

Original 106 is not operating within its Format and a Yellow Card warning has been issued."

On 29 February 2008 Original 106 was sampled again by OFCOM on Wednesday 30 January, Thursday 31 January and Friday 1 February 2008. OFCOM concluded:

"At the end of January 2008, we carried out a second three-day analysis of Original’s output, and found that, across a 24-hour period, the station was now within its permitted percentage of Top 20 hit singles. There was also a considerable reduction in the number of tracks that could not comfortably be described as "Adult Alternative". The station was within its Format in other aspects of its music policy. The station was also compliant with its Format regarding news and speech output, which included a high percentage of speech at breakfast, along with interviews and features, and two extended news bulletins.  We concluded that Original 106 is now operating within its Format, and the Yellow Card issued in October 2007 therefore has been lifted."
