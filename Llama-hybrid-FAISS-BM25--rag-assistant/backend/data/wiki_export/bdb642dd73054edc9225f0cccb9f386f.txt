The Four Days of Dunkirk () is road bicycle race around the Nord-Pas de Calais region of northern France.  Despite the name of the race, since the addition of an individual time trial in 1963, the race has been held over a 5 or 6 day period for most of its history. Since 2005, the race has been organised as a 2.HC event on the UCI Europe Tour. The race became part of the UCI ProSeries in 2020. French cyclist Romain Gr√©goire won the most recent edition of the race.
