It was established in 1923 as  during the Japanese period. The soccer stadium was opened in 1989, it was reconstructed from the former site of Yuanshan Baseball Ground () under the guidance of then Chinese Taipei Football Association President Chiang Wei-kuo.

Closure
In March 2007, Taipei City Government announced that Yuanshan will be replacing Guandu Plain as the main venue of the 2010 International Garden and Horticulture Exhibition to be hosted in Taipei. In their plan, Chungshan Soccer Stadium, being one of the major parts of the Yuanshan area, would serve as the primary venue of the exhibition featuring indoor activities. As a result, the stadium was closed on July 1, 2008.

However, the Chinese Taipei Football Association made a statement in its official site on June 29, 2007, opposing the proposal. They stated that Chungshan Soccer Stadium was the only FIFA-approved stadium in Taiwan at present. If it is closed, Taiwan (Chinese Taipei) would lose its home ground and would not be allowed to hold international football competitions.

Though there were several ongoing construction projects for new stadiums, including the World Games Stadium for World Games 2009 in Kaohsiung and the new Taipei Municipal Stadium for 2009 Summer Deaflympics in Taipei. But both cannot be complete prior to the end of 2008.

On September 30, 2007, Taipei City Mayor Hau Lung-pin committed to delay the stadium's closing schedule to the end of 2008 for hosting 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification and 2008 AFC Challenge Cup qualifiers. The stadium was closed on November 28, 2008.

Transportation
