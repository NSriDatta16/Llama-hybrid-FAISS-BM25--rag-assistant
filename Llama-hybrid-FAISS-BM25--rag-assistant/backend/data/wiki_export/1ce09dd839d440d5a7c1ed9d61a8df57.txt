The Greek Orthodox Monastery of Saint Demetrius, situated on the mountain slope above Stomio, was founded in the 6th century and rebuilt in its present form in the 12th century by Byzantine emperor Alexios I Komnenos. Before 1927 Stomio was named Tsagezi (), deriving from the Turkish Çay ağzı which translates to "river mouth". (Çay = river, ağız = mouth, ağzı = the mouth).
