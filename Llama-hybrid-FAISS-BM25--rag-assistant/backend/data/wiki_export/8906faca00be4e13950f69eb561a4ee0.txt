StagKnight is an 2007 English black comedy-horror film directed by Simon Cathcart and written by Cathcart and Rob Mercer. It stars Martin Bayfield as a murderous knight who hunts down a paintball team during a weekend party. The title is a reference to a stag night, the party featured in the film.

Two tie-in Flash games were created to promote the film, the second of which had been played over a million times on Newgrounds.com prior to its deletion.

Plot
A paintballing team known as the "Weekend Warriors" heads to a woodland retreat just outside London to celebrate the marital engagement of one of their members. However, deep within the forest, an ancient warrior preserved from the time of King Arthur has awoken and begins to hunt them down one by one.
