History

The station was opened on 2 July 1990, along with Broombridge, Castleknock, and Leixlip Confey. Like the latter three of these stations it underwent an upgrade project in 2000 which led to the portacabin booking office being replaced by a permanent station building and the platforms being lengthened. The ticket office is open from 06:30 to 13:00, Monday to Friday. It is closed on Saturday and Sunday.
