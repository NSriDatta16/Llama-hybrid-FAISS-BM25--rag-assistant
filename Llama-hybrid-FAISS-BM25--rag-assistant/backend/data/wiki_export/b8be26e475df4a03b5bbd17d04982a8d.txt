Live Alien Broadcast is a Baltimore-based rock band that began between the Washington D.C. suburb of Gaithersburg, Maryland and Baltimore City, as a straight up heavy band and later incorporated a DJ and samples to their sound.

Biography
During the mid-to-late 1990s through the first part of the 2000 decade, Live Alien Broadcast was a strong musical presence in the Mid-Atlantic Music Scene. They were voted "Best Live Show" by Music Monthly Magazine. They are commonly known and referred to as L.A.B., for short.

The band has played with national acts such as Limp Bizkit, Kid Rock, 2 Skinnee J's, Jimmie's Chicken Shack, and Kottonmouth Kings.

Originally the band started from two members, Don DeOliveira and Rob Lasky of the band Tattoo Taxi from Baltimore. The pair decided to start anew, and Fubler, Cook, then (after a long search) Jones answered an advertisement in ROX Magazine and met up with DeOliveira and Lasky.  A demo was recorded at Flite III studios in Baltimore and they began playing gigs in the local Baltimore/Washington area. Due to personal and financial reasons, Cook was let go, and Kevin Baker joined shortly thereafter. In 1996 Lasky, DeOliveira, Fubler, Baker, and Jones became the core members of L.A.B.

When drummer Rob Lasky left the band in 1997, L.A.B. decided to move in a new direction, inviting former Orange Whip drummer Jerome Maffeo and Dancehall DJ Michael "Bigga" Haight to join the band.

In 1999, Live Alien Broadcast went through another lineup change that has essentially remained the current. DJ Bigga Mike and drummer Jerome Maffeo, left L.A.B. to join another local band Fidel. Shortly after their departure, the band recruited DJ Geoffro and drummer Matt Toronto joined the band.

L.A.B. has played to large-scale audiences at venues like RFK Stadium for the Annual HFStival in 2001 and at the famous 9:30 Club in Washington D.C.

The "Hiatus"
In 2001, Don decided to retire from LAB, and Matt Toronto left the band to pursue other projects. L.A.B. then recruited Dave and Ray from Zero Frequency to fill the missing spots in the band and continued on. In 2002, L.A.B decided to take a Vacation from their rigorous touring and writing schedule to "clear their heads and just breathe for a while". During this downtime, Kevin Baker formed The Mayan Factor with former L.A.B. webmaster, drummer Chuck Jacobs. Jason Fubler, Dave and Ray and formed Agents Of The Sun.

Reunited

The band played their second gig back together at the Portuguese Festival on June 10, 2006, in Newark, New Jersey.
In February 2006, the band has promised a new full-length CD "ORDINARY" to be released on July 1, 2006. The record release will take place in Baltimore, MD at the club Sonar.
