Professional career

Philadelphia Eagles
Williams was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the second round (61st overall) in the 2000 NFL Draft. He was inactive throughout the entire 2000 season as he made the transition from tackle to guard. He made his NFL debut at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on January 6, 2001, starting at right guard. Williams played in every game for the Eagles in 2002 and 2003 and also played in two playoff games in 2002. He took over the starting right guard job after an elbow injury to Jermane Mayberry in 2003.
During his four years with Philadelphia, Williams helped the Eagles win three NFC East Division titles in a row (2001-2003), reaching the NFC Championship Game (2001-2003) during that three-year run.

He was re-signed to a two-year contract on April 5, 2010. In Week 14 of the 2011 NFL season, Williams broke his ankle in a 20–19 loss against the Houston Texans, causing him to miss the remainder of the season.
