Plot outline

Series 1
Henry Jay, a lacklustre and predictable government clerk compiling statistics and writing reports on computer fraud, suddenly finds himself with the threads of an international computer fraud in his hands. Forced to flee his wife and home when bodies start littering his path, he unexpectedly evades pursuit long enough to realise that his one chance at survival is to complete the puzzle and turn the tables on his pursuers â€“ thus turning this very unlikely candidate into a "bird of prey".

Series 2
Again under attack, Henry Jay must escape the clutches of a professional assassin and the country they are in, find a way to eliminate the danger, and permanently safeguard his wife and himself.
