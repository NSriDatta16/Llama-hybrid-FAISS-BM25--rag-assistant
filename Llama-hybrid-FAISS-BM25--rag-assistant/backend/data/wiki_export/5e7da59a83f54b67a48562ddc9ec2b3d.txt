The Bläck Fööss (Ripuarian De Bläck Fööss) are a music group from Cologne, Germany, started in 1970. From 1973 to 2003 Werner Dies was producer of the music group.

Name of the band 

The band's name in Kölsch, a local dialect of Ripuarian, in which the group predominantly sings, means barefoot.
It is pronounced .
In their early days the group would perform barefoot, which was later given up mainly after several injuries from remains of broken glass on stages.

Repertoire 

The band's style of music is a cross between Schlager and pop, but they also perform songs with jazz, blues, rock and reggae styles. The group is famous for its a cappella singing. Many of the band's songs are popular carnival songs, while others are covers of bands such as Ladysmith Black Mambazo, (Bütz mich, cover of Hey baby, 1990) Cologne music group De Vier Botze (En d'r Kaygaß Nummere Null!, 1975) Beatles (When I'm Sixty-Four, Penny Lane, 1989), Hollies or Willi Ostermann.

In August 1985 the band got their biggest chart success, with the song "Frankreich, Frankreich" (English: France, France) landing in at number 9 in the German charts, after the band had entered the German charts for the first time  with the song "Katrin" in January 1985.
