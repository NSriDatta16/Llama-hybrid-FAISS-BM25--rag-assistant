Omega Capricorni, which is Latinized from ω Capricorni, is a star in the southern constellation Capricornus, near the southern constellation border with Microscopium. It is an orange hued star that is faintly visible to the naked eye, having an apparent visual magnitude of +4.11. Based upon an annual parallax shift of  as seen from the Earth, it is located approximately 1,000 light years from the Sun. It is a candidate member of the Ursa Major Moving Group and has a relatively high peculiar velocity of , making it is a possible runaway star.

In Chinese,  (), meaning Celestial Farmland, refers to an asterism consisting of ω Capricorni, 3 Piscis Austrini, 24 Capricorni and ψ Capricorni. Consequently, the Chinese name for ω Capricorni itself is  (, .)

This is an evolved K-type giant star with a stellar classification of K4 III, and is a suspected variable. With the supply of hydrogen at its core exhausted, the star has expanded to about 172 times the radius of the Sun. It is 48 million years old with 7 times the mass of the Sun. Omega Capricorni is radiating 6,300 times the luminosity of the Sun from its bloated photosphere at an effective temperature of 3,915 K. It is a barium star, showing an overabundance of the s-process elements. This suggests that Omega Capricorni has an orbiting white dwarf companion.
