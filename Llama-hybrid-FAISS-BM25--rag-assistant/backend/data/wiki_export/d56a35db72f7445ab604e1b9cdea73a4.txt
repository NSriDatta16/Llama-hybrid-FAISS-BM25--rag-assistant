Lexmond is a village in the Dutch province of Utrecht. It is a part of the municipality of Vijfheerenlanden, and lies about 7Â km south of IJsselstein.

Lexmond was a separate municipality in the province of South Holland until 1986, when it became part of Zederik. When Zederik merged into the new municipality Vijfheerenlanden in 2019, it became a part of the province of Utrecht.

History 
The village was first mentioned in 1180 as Lakesmunde, and means "mouth of the Laak (river)". Lexmond started as a dike village along the Lek River. In 1277, the Laak was dammed and a little harbour was constructed. The Dutch Reformed Church dates from the 14th century and was extensively restored between 1954 and 1958. In 1840, it was home to 700 people.
