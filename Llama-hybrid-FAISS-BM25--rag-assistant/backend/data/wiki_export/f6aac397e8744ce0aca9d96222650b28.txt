In the Latin-based orthographies of many European languages, including English, a distinction between hard and soft  occurs in which  represents two distinct phonemes. The sound of a hard  often precedes the non-front vowels ,  and , and is that of the voiceless velar stop,  (as in car). The sound of a soft , typically before ,  and , may be a fricative or affricate, depending on the language. In English (and not coincidentally also French), the sound of soft  is  (as in the first and final c's in "circumference").

There was no soft  in classical Latin, where it was always pronounced as .

History
This alternation is caused by a historical palatalization of  which took place in Late Latin, and led to a change in the pronunciation of the sound  before the front vowels  and . Later, other languages not directly descended from Latin, such as English, inherited this feature as an orthographic convention.

English

General overview
In English orthography, the pronunciation of hard  is  and of soft  is generally . Yod-coalescence has altered instances of  ─ particularly in unstressed syllables ─ to  in most varieties of English, affecting words such as ocean, logician and magician. Generally, the soft  pronunciation occurs before ; it also occurs before  and  in a number of Greek and Latin loanwords (such as coelacanth, caecum, caesar). The hard  pronunciation occurs everywhere else except in the letter combinations , , and  which have distinct pronunciation rules.  generally represents  before , as in accident, succeed, and coccyx.

There are exceptions to the general rules of hard and soft :
 The  in the words Celt and Celtic was traditionally soft, but since the late 19th century, the hard pronunciation has also been recognized in conscious imitation of the classical Latin pronunciation of Celtae; see Pronunciation of Celtic. Welsh and Gaelic loanwords in English which retain their native spelling, such as ceilidh, cistvaen (alternatively spelled ) or Cymric, are also pronounced hard. The Irish and Welsh languages have no letter K, so all Cs are pronounced hard.
 The  is hard in a handful of words like arcing, synced/syncing, chicer (), and Quebecer (alternatively spelled ) that involve a word normally spelled with a final  followed by an affix starting with  or ; soccer and recce also have a hard .
 The  in sceptic, and its derivatives such as sceptical and scepticism, represents . These words are alternative spellings to  and , respectively.
 The  of flaccid now sometimes represents a single soft  pronunciation , which is a simplification of .
 The  is silent before  in indict and its derivatives such as indictment, in the name of the U.S. state Connecticut, and in some pronunciations of Arctic and Antarctic.
 In a few cases such as facade and limacon, a soft  appears before  and is optionally indicated to be soft by means of attaching a cedilla to its bottom, giving façade, limaçon.

A silent  can occur after  at the end of a word or component root word part of a larger word. The  can serve a marking function indicating that the preceding  is soft, as in dance and enhancement. The silent  often additionally indicates that the vowel before  is a long vowel, as in rice, mace, and pacesetter.

When adding suffixes with  (such as -ed, -ing, -er, -est, -ism, -ist, -y, and -ie) to root words ending in , the final  of the root word is often dropped and the root word retains the soft  pronunciation as in danced, dancing, and dancer from dance. The suffixes -ify and -ise/-ize can be added to most nouns and adjectives to form new verbs. The pronunciation of  in newly coined words using these suffixes is not always clear. The digraph  may be used to retain the hard  pronunciation in inflections and derivatives of a word such as trafficking from the verb traffic.

There are several cases in English in which hard and soft  alternate with the addition of suffixes as in critic/criticism and electric/electricity (electrician has a soft  pronunciation of  because of yod-coalescence).

Letter combinations
A number of two-letter combinations or digraphs follow distinct pronunciation patterns and do not follow the hard/soft distinction of . For example,  may represent  (as in chicken),  (as in chef), or  (as in choir). Other letter combinations that don't follow the paradigm include , , , , , and . These come primarily from loanwords.

Besides a few examples (recce, soccer, Speccy),  fits neatly with the regular rules of : Before , the second  is soft while the first is hard. Words such as accept and success are pronounced with  and words such as succumb and accommodate are pronounced with . Exceptions include loanwords from Italian such as cappuccino with  for .

Many placenames and other proper nouns with -cester (from Old English ceaster, meaning Roman station or walled town) are pronounced with  such as Worcester (), Gloucester ( or ), and Leicester (). The  pronunciation occurs as a combination of a historically soft  pronunciation and historical elision of the first vowel of the suffix.

Italian loanwords
The original spellings and pronunciations of Italian loanwords have mostly been kept. Many English words that have been borrowed from Italian follow a distinct set of pronunciation rules corresponding to those in Italian. The Italian soft  pronunciation is  (as in cello and ciao), while the hard  is the same as in English. Italian orthography uses  to indicate a hard pronunciation before  or , analogous to English using  (as in kill and keep) and  (as in mosquito and queue).

In addition to hard and soft , the digraph  represents  or, if between vowels,  when followed by  or  (as in scena or sciarpa with , crescendo and fascia with ). Meanwhile,  in Italian always represents , not , but English-speakers commonly pronounce it as , perhaps in part due to familiarity with the German pronunciation; thus bruschetta often is realized not with the  of Italian , but with . Italian uses  to indicate the geminate  before , ,  or  before  or . English does not have geminate phonemes, thus loanwords with soft  that are pronounced with  in Italian, such as cappuccino, are normally pronounced in English with the geminate simplified: .

Suffixation issues
Rarely, the use of unusual suffixed forms to create neologisms occurs. For example, the words ace and race are both standard words but adding -ate or -age (both productive affixes in English) would create spellings that seem to indicate hard  pronunciations. ( and racage). Potential remedies include altering the spelling to  and rasage, though no standard conventions exist.

Replacement with 

Sometimes  replaces , , or , as a trope for giving words a hard-edged or whimsical feel. Examples include the Mortal Kombat franchise and product names such as Kool-Aid and Nesquik. More intensely, this use of  has also been used to give extremist or racist connotations. Examples include Amerika or Amerikkka (where the  is reminiscent of German and the totalitarian Nazi regime and the racist Ku Klux Klan, respectively).

Other languages
Most modern Romance languages make the hard/soft distinction with , except a few that have undergone spelling reforms such as Ladino and archaic variants like Sardinian. Some non-Romance languages like German, Danish and Dutch use  in loanwords and also make this distinction. The soft  pronunciation, which occurs before ,  and , is: 
 in Italian, Romanian, and Old English;
 in English, French, Portuguese, Catalan, Latin American Spanish, and in words loaned into Dutch and the Scandinavian languages;
 in European and equatoguinean Spanish;
 in words loaned into German. This is one of the more archaic pronunciations, and was also the pronunciation in Old Spanish, Old French and other historical languages where it is now pronounced . Most languages in eastern and central Europe came to use  only for , and  only for  (this would include those Slavic languages that use Latin script, Hungarian, Albanian, and the Baltic languages).
The hard  occurs in all other positions and represents  in all these aforementioned languages, including in the case of ⟨c⟩ that comes before the Romanian letter î, which is different from i.

In Italian and Romanian, the orthographic convention for representing  before front vowels is to add  (Italian chiaro,  'clear').  is used to accomplish the same purpose in Catalan, Portuguese, Spanish, and French. Rarely, the use of unusual suffixed forms to create neologisms occurs. For example, the words saco and taco are both standard words but adding -es or -ez (both productive affixes in Spanish) would create spellings that seem to indicate soft  pronunciations. ( and tacez). Potential remedies include altering the spelling to  and taquez, though no standard conventions exist.
In French, Catalan, Portuguese, and Old Spanish a cedilla is used to indicate a soft  pronunciation when it would otherwise seem to be hard. (French garçon , 'boy'; Portuguese coração , 'heart'; Catalan caçar , 'to hunt'). Spanish is similar, though  is used instead of  (e.g. corazón , 'heart'). However, this is essentially equivalent because despite common misconception the symbol  is actually derived from a Visigothic Z.

In the orthographies of Irish and Scottish Gaelic, most consonants including  have a "broad" (velarized) vs "slender" distinction (palatalized) for many of its other consonants generally based on whether the nearest vowel is  or , respectively. In Irish, ⟨c⟩ usually represents a hard , but represents  before e or i, or after i. In Scottish Gaelic, broad  is one of /kʰ ʰk ʰk k/, and slender  is one of /kʰʲ ʰkʲ ʰkʲ kʲ/, depending on the phonetic environment.

A number of orthographies do not make a hard/soft distinction. The  is always hard in Welsh but is always soft in Slavic languages, Hungarian, and in Hanyu Pinyin transcription system of Mandarin Chinese, where it represents  and in Indonesian and many of the transcriptions of the languages of India such as Sanskrit and Hindi, where it always represents . See also C § Other languages.

Swedish has a similar phenomenon with hard and soft : this results from a similar historical palatalization development. Soft  is typically a palatal  or an alveolo-palatal , and occurs before not only  ,  and , but also , , and . Another similar system with hard and soft  is found in Faroese with the hard  being  and the soft being , and Turkish where the soft  is .

The Vietnamese alphabet, while based on European orthographies, does not have a hard or a soft  per se. The letter , outside of the digraph , always represents a hard /k/ sound. However, it never occurs in "soft positions", i.e. before , where  is used instead, while  never occurs elsewhere except in the digraph  and a few loanwords. Quite ironically, the names of the letters "c" and "k" are borrowed from Europe and those letters don't even occur in their own letter names (C: xê and K: ca.) Hồ Chí Minh had proposed a simplified spelling, as shown in the title of one of his books, 'Đường kách mệnh'.
