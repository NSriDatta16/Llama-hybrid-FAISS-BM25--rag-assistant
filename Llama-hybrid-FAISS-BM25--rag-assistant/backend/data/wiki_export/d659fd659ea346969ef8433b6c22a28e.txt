Necronauts was a story appearing in the British comics anthology 2000 AD, by British comics writer Gordon Rennie and artist Frazer Irving. It brought Irving to public attention as his high contrast black and white artwork complemented Rennie's dark storyline.

Publication history
The outline for the story and was written in 1991 and was originally intended for Tundra Publishing, where Rennie had published White Trash, however:

The story formed part of a general push by editor Andy Diggle to get more horror into the comic: "I commissioned Necronauts because I thought horror would work well in 2000 AD."

It eventually started in the 2000 AD end of year special in 2000, Prog 2001, and continued in issues #1223-1230.

Sir Arthur travels to New York City to speak to Houdini, where they are attacked by Tcho-Tchos, summoned by The Sleepers' human minions (The Hidden Masters of the World: The Illuminated Ones).
