Vasse (Tweants: ) is a village in the Dutch province of Overijssel. It is a part of the municipality of Tubbergen, and lies about 15Â km northeast of Almelo.

History 
Vasse developed as an esdorp along the Vasser Es River. It was first mentioned in the late 10th century as "in Fahsi". The etymology is unclear. In 1803, it became an independent parish. In 1840, it was home to 298 people. In 1861, the Catholic church was built in Vasse, and a village developed around it.

Some rural farms and barns are good examples of the traditional building style in Twente which includes variations of the Low German house. 
The village is a popular destiny as a starting point for hiking or biking trips because of the beauty and variety of the nature surrounding it. Local hotels and restaurants are primarily oriented towards this type of tourists.

The tar pits of Vasse were a former sand excavation in which chemical waste was dumped in the 1960s and 1970s. It is one of the largest contaminated areas of the Netherlands. Given the expenditure to clean it up, the area is contained to prevent leakage.
