Track listing

Leftover track
"The Set Up" (featuring Heather B. & Nikki D) (produced by DJ Premier)
The song was confirmed as a diss song to rival Foxy Brown who previously made derogatory comments about Rage and Heather B. in a particular interview. The track however was subsequently deleted from the album's track listing. This would also be the second time Nikki D made a cameo in a Foxy Brown diss record, the first being Queen Latifah's controversial, "Name Callin' (Part 1)".
