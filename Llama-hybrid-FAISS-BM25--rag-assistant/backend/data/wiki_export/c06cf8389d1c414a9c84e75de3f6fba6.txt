The Juno Awards of 2006 were held in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada on the weekend of 31 March to 2 April 2006. These ceremonies honour music industry achievements in Canada during the previous year.

The primary ceremonies were hosted by Pamela Anderson at the Halifax Metro Centre on 2 April and televised on CTV. Buck 65 was the ceremony's introduction and preview announcer. Music artists Bedouin Soundclash, Broken Social Scene, Divine Brown, Hedley, Massari and Nickelback performed songs at these ceremonies. Also performing were the co-winners for the 2006 International Album of the Year, The Black Eyed Peas and Coldplay.

Bryan Adams was the 2006 inductee into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame. Chris Martin of Coldplay introduced Adams at the primary ceremony.

Michael Bublé won four awards, more than any other individual that year. Besides winning Artist of the Year, his album It's Time won in both the Album of the Year and Pop Album of the Year categories. His song "Home" from that album was declared Single of the Year.

Awards for most categories were presented on 1 April in a non-televised ceremony at the Halifax World Trade and Convention Centre hosted by Jully Black, with performances by Kardinal Offishall, The Road Hammers and Martha Wainwright. This Saturday gala included the presentation of the Junos' first Humanitarian award to Bruce Cockburn. The Walt Grealis Special Achievement Award was given to True North Records founder Bernie Finkelstein.

International telecast 
The 2006 awards were the first to be televised by broadcasters outside Canada, as seen on the following MTV-related operations:

 Australia (VH1)
 China (MTV)
 India (VH1)
 Italy (MTV)
 Latin America (VH1)
 Malaysia (MTV Asia)
 Portugal (MTV)
 Singapore (MTV Asia)
 Taiwan (MTV Asia)
 United Kingdom (VH1)
 United States (MTV2)

Controversy 
During the televised ceremony, a commercial aired congratulating Michael Bublé for his Single of the Year victory, half an hour before the award was announced.

Both CTV and Warner Music Canada have indicated that they did not, in fact, have advance knowledge that Bublé was the actual winner. As is normal practice, Warner had prepared a number of contingency ads congratulating its artists, to be aired only in the event that the artist in question was actually named a winner. CTV has confirmed that its control room technicians mistakenly aired the Bublé ad in place of another congratulatory announcement.

Host of the show, Pamela Anderson made numerous failed attempts to joke during the show and spoke out against the seal hunt, which elicited loud boos from the audience.  Quotes included, "One of my favourite artists couldn't be here tonight; Seal. He was afraid he might get clubbed to death."
