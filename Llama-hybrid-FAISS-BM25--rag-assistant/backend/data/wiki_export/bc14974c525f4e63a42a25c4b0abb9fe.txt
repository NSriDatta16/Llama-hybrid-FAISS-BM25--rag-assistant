I Am Santa Claus is the second Christmas album by Bob Rivers & Twisted Radio.  It was released in November 1993 by Atlantic Records (WEA 82548), five years after Twisted Christmas, and four years before More Twisted Christmas.

Track listing
 "There's Another Santa Claus" - 2:01
(parody of "Here Comes Santa Claus," performed by a Gene Autry impersonator)
 "Walkin' 'Round in Women's Underwear" - 1:55
(parody of "Winter Wonderland" about cross-dressing)
 "I Am Santa Claus" - 3:22
(sung to tune of "Iron Man" by Black Sabbath, except the last ten notes on the prominent guitar riff are replaced with five notes from Jingle Bells.)
A music video was made for the title track, in which Rivers, playing a father of two, inexplicably transforms into a heavy-metal Santa Claus riding in a reindeer-pulled limousine on Christmas Eve. In a meta-cameo, Ozzy Osbourne, in a black-and-white universe watching the video on a television, angrily turns the TV off, transforming metal-Santa (in the middle of a concert) back into Rivers.
 "Manger 6" - 0:44
(parody of Motel 6 ads, narrated by a Tom Bodett impersonator)
 "O Little Town of Bethlehem" - 2:09

 "Grahbe Yahbalz" - 1:08
(parody of "Deck the Halls;" the name is pseudo-Yiddish for censorship purposes, song describes a gesture frequently used by Michael Jackson)

 spoken by Bob Rivers
 "The Magical Kingdom of Claus" - 5:53

 "The 'What's It to Ya' Chorus - 2:37

 "O Christmas Tree" - 2:33
 Instrumental set to the sounds of chainsaws.

Critical reaction
J. D. Considine wrote in the Baltimore Sun that "Rivers' idea of 'funny' generally seems the work of a guy who's read too many issues of Mad magazine, but there are some good bits here." Helen Bryant of The Dallas Morning News wrote "Irving Berlin, it's not" while the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette called the album "this year's hip offering."

Chart performance
By late December 2003, the album had already sold more than 100,000 copies. I Am Santa Claus entered the Billboard Top Albums chart at #180 before peaking at #106.
