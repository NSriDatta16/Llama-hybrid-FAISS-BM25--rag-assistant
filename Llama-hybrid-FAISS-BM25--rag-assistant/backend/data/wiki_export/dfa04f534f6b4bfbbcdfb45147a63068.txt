Biography 
The band was formed in 1993. After releasing their first album, My Animal, independently in 1998, they went on the Sno-Core Tour and recorded their next album, Boy Hits Car, on Wind-up Records. Their song "LoveFuryPassionEnergy" was used as a theme song for WWE Hall of Famer Lita and was distributed on the WWF Forceable Entry album in 2002. A third album was self released in 2005 called The Passage. In 2006 the band re-released the album in July after signing with Rock Ridge Music as their distributor. It was announced on their homepage that they will have a new album with a planned release on March 15, 2011. Boy Hits Car released their 5th studio album All That Led Us Here in May 2014 and are presently following it up with a European tour.

Peterson stated in a Reddit AMA conducted to mark the self-titled album's 20th anniversary that 12 to 13 tracks had been written for a pending sixth album, with a name for said album still being decided upon at that time. The lead single, Injustice Fatigue, was released in November 2022.
