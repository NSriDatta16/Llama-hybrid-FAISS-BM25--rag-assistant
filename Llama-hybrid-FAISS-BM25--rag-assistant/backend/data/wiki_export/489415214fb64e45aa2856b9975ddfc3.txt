History

1988–2009
Churchill Brothers FC were founded in 1988 as Varca Club. After one season, they  renamed as Brothers Sporting Club. Later on they were bought out by Churchill Braz Alemao and renamed as Churchill Brothers FC and emerged as runners-up of the National Football League thrice: 1996–97, 1999–2000 and 2001–02. In the 1997–98 Asian Club Championship, Churchill Brothers went on to represent India. But, they had a forgetful debut outing as the Goan outfit was knocked out in the very first round by Vietnamese club Dong Thap with a 2–1 aggregate loss. In 1998, Churchill roped in Bassim Yonan, the first Iraqi player in India.

After the take over by Churchill, the club went on to win the Durand Cup in 2007, and the 2008–09 I-League, Durand Cup in 2009, IFA Shield in the same year.

During the AFC Cup they won two games against Al-Hilal Al-Sahili and finished runners-up in their group, advancing to the next round. Finally, they were defeated 1–2 to Al-Qadsia at the Mohammed Al-Hamad Stadium.

2010–2019
Churchill Brothers was managed by Singaporean Vincent Subramaniam for the 2010–11 season. The club went the rest of the season with Croatian Drago Mamić, who helped them win the IFA Shield that year.

On 9 June 2011, Churchill Brothers announced they have signed former Portugal national football team assistant coach Manuel Gomes as a permanent coach. His start proved to be successful as the club captured the 2011 Durand Cup for the third team in their history in October 2011, defeating Prayag United 5–4. However, on 15 February 2012, it was announced that Gomes had resigned and that former coach Carlos Roberto Pereira would be brought in on a caretaker basis.

Then on 13 July 2012, it was announced that Mariano Dias had been signed to become their new full-time head coach. After his first season in charge, Dias managed to lead Churchill Brothers to the I-League championship, their second domestic title in the history.

After the end of 2013–14 I-League season, Churchill finished in twelfth position with 25 points in 24 matches and was evicted from I-League for not fulfilling the Asian Football Confederation's club licensing criteria. In that season, they clinched the 2013–14 Indian Federation Cup title.

In November 2017, it was announced that Ukrainian Mykola Shevchenko joined Churchill as their head coach. His first game as a manager occurred on 2 December 2017, when Churchill took on Shillong Lajong, resulting in a 2–0 loss. His stint came to an end as he was sacked from the position. Churchill then roped in Joseph Afusi of Nigeria as technical director, but were relegated at the end of the 2017–18 season, with just 17 points from 18 games. However, their position was reinstated by the AIFF, after a successful appeal by the club.

In August 2018, Romanian manager Petre Gigiu was appointed head coach. His first competitive game was on 28 October 2018 in Churchill's opening match against the reigning champions, Minerva Punjab. The match ended in a 0–0 draw. At the end of the 2018–19 I-League season, they finished on fourth position with 34 points.

2020–present
In September 2020, Churchill appointed Fernando Santiago Varela as head coach. Under his guidance, Churchill emerged as the runners-up of the 2020–21 I-League with 29 points. Although Churchill managed a win against RoundGlass Punjab in their last match, Gokulam Kerala FC were crowned champions courtesy of a better head-to-head record.

Ahead of the 2021–22 I-League, Churchill roped in their first ever Guinean player Sekou Sylla, and Romanian Petre Gigiu returned to the club as head coach. They finished the season in fourth place. The club later in November, reached final of Baji Rout Cup in Odisha, finished as runners-up after defeat to Rajasthan United. They later took part in 2023 Indian Super Cup in Kerala, in April.
