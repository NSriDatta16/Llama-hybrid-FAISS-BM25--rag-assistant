NCTA – The Internet & Television Association, formerly known as the National Cable & Telecommunications Association (NCTA), is a prominent trade association representing the American broadband and pay television industries. As of 2011, the NCTA encompassed more than 90% of the U.S. cable market, over 200 cable networks, and various equipment suppliers and service providers to the cable industry.

The NCTA holds a significant position as a political lobbying organization in the United States, having allocated $14 million to lobbying efforts in 2021 alone. Regarding policy matters, the NCTA has expressed opposition to net neutrality and municipal broadband proposals. Currently, the association is led by Michael Powell, a former Republican member of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

History

NCTA was initially established as the National Community Television Council in September 1951, when a small group of community antenna (CATV) operators convened in Pottsville, Pennsylvania. Their gathering was prompted by concerns over the Internal Revenue Service's proposed 8% excise tax on their operations. Recognizing shared interests, these business individuals held a series of organizational meetings from September 1951 to October 1951 and January 1952. In January 1952, the organization officially changed its name to the National Community Television Association.

As the CATV industry rapidly expanded, NCTA experienced parallel growth. Within its first year, nearly 40 CATV systems became members of the organization. By the end of the 1950s, membership had reached the hundreds, and by the end of the 1960s, it had expanded into the thousands. During the 1960s, the industry transitioned from using the term "Community Antenna Television (CATV)" to simply "cable," reflecting the broader range of services offered, including local news, weather information, and pay television channels. In 1968, NCTA underwent its first official name change, becoming the National Cable Television Association while retaining its acronym.

With the advent of global telecommunication satellites, the late 1970s and 1980s witnessed a significant surge in cable content. Entrepreneurs launched networks such as CNN, ESPN, MTV, BET, TBS, USA, Discovery, Lifetime, C-SPAN, and many others. Concurrently, major programming services across the nation joined NCTA, augmenting the organization's representation of cable interests in Washington.

To reflect the growing influence of cable internet and other two-way communication forms in the industry, the organization rebranded as the National Cable and Telecommunications Association in April 2001. Subsequently, on September 19, 2016, NCTA underwent another name change, becoming NCTA – The Internet & Television Association. While retaining the NCTA acronym, the new name deliberately eliminates the reference to cable to reflect the organization's expanded scope. This change aligns with the association's efforts to acknowledge that the marketplace is no longer confined to past divisions. The organization had already taken steps to reduce its emphasis on cable by rebranding its annual convention, previously known as The Cable Show, as INTX in 2015.

Leadership
NCTA operates under the guidance of a board of directors. In March 2012, the chairman of the board was Patrick Esser, serving as the president of Cox Communications.

Michael Powell currently holds the position of president and CEO of NCTA. Powell assumed the role on April 25, 2011, succeeding Kyle McSlarrow, who departed to join Comcast. Powell previously served as the head of the FCC.

Lobbying
The NCTA is recognized as one of the most prominent lobbying organizations in the United States. In 2014, it allocated approximately $12.0 million for political lobbying.

The NCTA expressed opposition to the FCC's proposal to expand the definition of multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs) to include internet-based services. However, it stated that if the definition were expanded, internet delivery should be subject to the same obligations as traditional cable services. NCTA President Michael Powell holds a stance against amending the Telecommunications Act of 1996 to enable a la carte pay television, citing potential impacts on smaller niche networks.

In March 2014, the NCTA voiced support for the FCC's decision to allocate 100 MHz of spectrum for unlicensed Wi-Fi services.

Internet issues
The NCTA has expressed its views on net neutrality, specifically objecting to the classification of internet service as a common carrier under Title II of the 1996 Telecommunications Act. In 2010, the NCTA advised the FCC against formalizing its net neutrality rules. After the rules were invalidated by the court in 2014, the NCTA ran advertisements in the media opposing reclassification as a common carrier. According to ProPublica in 2014, the NCTA was privately associated with the "Onward Internet" campaign, which advocates for an internet free from regulations. In 2016, the NCTA and the American Cable Association submitted petitions for en banc review of a ruling that upheld net neutrality rules, arguing against regulating cable internet systems in the same manner as "archaic telephone systems".

The NCTA supported the Stop Online Piracy Act of 2011, stating that it provided copyright owners with reasonable tools to protect their intellectual property. The NCTA objected to the FCC's decision to raise the minimum internet speed for Connect America Fund broadband subsidies from 4 Mbit/s to 10 Mbit/s, asserting that 4 Mbit/s was sufficient.

Using a model bill developed by the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), the NCTA has advocated for legislation that prohibits or restricts municipal broadband in several states. When President Barack Obama requested the FCC preempt these laws in January 2015, the NCTA defended the legislation, contending that municipal projects often incur high costs and prove unsuccessful.

NCTA President Michael Powell has advocated for internet service providers to expand their usage of data caps on internet usage, with the aim of promoting fairness rather than alleviating network congestion.

Events and subsidiaries

INTX
NCTA organizes an annual conference called INTX: The Internet and Television Expo (formerly The Cable Show until 2015). It was the largest trade show in the United States for the cable and broadband industry. The conference featured discussions with current and former FCC commissioners, including remarks from the FCC chair in multiple years.

During INTX, the NCTA presented the Vanguard Awards, which were nominated by NCTA members and selected by a committee consisting of members from the NCTA Board of Directors and previous award recipients.

In September 2016, the NCTA announced the discontinuation of INTX. President and CEO Michael Powell described the trade shows as outdated and highlighted the importance of contemporary venues that foster conversation, dialogue, and more intimate interactions with technology. Attendance had been declining due to industry consolidation, making the trade show less necessary.

CableACE Awards

From 1978 to 1997, NCTA supported the CableACE Award, which aimed to recognize excellence in American cable television programming. The CableACE Award served as a counterpart to the Emmy Awards, which did not previously acknowledge cable programming. However, after 1997, the Emmys began to include cable television programming, leading to the discontinuation of the CableACE Awards.

Cable in the Classroom

The association also oversees Cable in the Classroom, which is the education foundation of the cable industry.

Walter Kaitz Foundation

NCTA is responsible for managing and overseeing the Walter Kaitz Foundation, which aims to promote diversity in the cable industry's workforce, supplier chain, content, and marketing.
