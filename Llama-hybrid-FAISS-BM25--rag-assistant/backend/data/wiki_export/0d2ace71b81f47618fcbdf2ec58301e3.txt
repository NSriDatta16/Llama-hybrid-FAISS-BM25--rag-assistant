Vacation in Reno  is a 1946 American comedy film directed by Leslie Goodwins and starring Jack Haley, Anne Jeffreys, Iris Adrian, Wally Brown, Alan Carney, and Morgan Conway.

Plot
Jack Carroll (portrayed by Jack Haley) and his wife (Anne Jeffreys) have an argument about their friends, but when he makes a crack that his mother-in-law is a "fat porpoise," they fight and she leaves him.

Jack runs into two strange men right before they burglarize a bank, leaving Jack to be the only one to identify. Because of this, he takes a vacation to Reno and checks into the Bar Nothing Ranch. Later, the robbers come to Reno and check in. They bury a suitcase of money where Jack plans to find it with his metal detector. Jack finds the money, but is taken by another lady.

This is the beginning of his troubles, where he encounters different men: a sheriff, a sailor, and a gun moll who convinces the police that she is Mrs. Carroll. Jack's wife arrives and Jack is unable to adequately explain things to her before she gets a divorce.
