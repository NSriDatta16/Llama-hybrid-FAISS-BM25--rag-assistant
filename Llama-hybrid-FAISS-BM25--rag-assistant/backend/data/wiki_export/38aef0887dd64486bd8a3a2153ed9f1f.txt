Jonne Aaron's younger brother, Ville Liimatainen, is the lead singer of the Finnish rock band, Flinch, who are managed by Hype Productions, the same label as Negative. He contributed backing vocals to Negative's cover of Queen's "Too Much Love Will Kill You" alongside Jussi Selo from Uniklubi (who also contributed to backing vocals on some Negative tracks), in which Jonne shared the limelight with Jann Wilde from Jann Wilde and Rose Avenue, and Christian from Dead By Gun.
Sir Christus (guitar) previously played bass in his younger brother's band, Bloodpit. Antti Anatomy (bass) made a guest appearance as a vengeful brother in 2007's "Wise Men Don't Cry", released as a single from Bloodpit's second album, Off the Hook.
Negative has toured with Jann Wilde and Rose Avenue before that band broke up (as they shared Tommi Liimatainen's management, who is Jonne's older brother.) as well as a triple team-up with The Rasmus and HIM in 2005.
Teemu Rajamäki, bassist for Uniklubi, has also appeared as guest musician on some concerts.
