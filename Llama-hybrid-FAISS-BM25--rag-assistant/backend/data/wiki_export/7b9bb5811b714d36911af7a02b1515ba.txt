History

NAHL, 1974–1977
1974–75
The Firebirds were established for the 1974–75 NAHL season hoping to capitalize on hockey's popularity in Philadelphia. The NHL's Philadelphia Flyers had just won their first Stanley Cup in 1974, and the Philadelphia Civic Center was recently vacated by the WHA's Philadelphia Blazers, making room for a minor league team. Gregg Pilling was named head coach of the Firebirds, and led the team for three seasons. Bob Collyard emerged as the team's scoring leader with 42 goals, 61 assists, and 103 points. The team finished the season second place in the NAHL with a 40–31–3 record and 83 points. The Firebirds faced the seventh place Long Island Cougars in the first round of the playoffs. Philadelphia won the first game 4–2, but lost the next three games in the best-of-five series by scores of 2–3, 2–5 and, 2–8 to finish the season.

1975–76
In the 1975–76 NAHL season, Bob Collyard led the team again in scoring with 45 goals, 84 assists, and 129 points.

AHL, 1977–1980

Danny Belisle was named the new coach and general manager. The team was built with several Red Wings prospects, and many of the top players from the Firebirds' NAHL seasons returned. Gord Brooks and Bob Collyard continued to lead the team in scoring even after switching leagues. Collyard scored 28 goals, 62 assists, and 90 points. Good Brooks scored 42 goals, 56 assists, and 98 points to tie for first in the league in points scored with Rick Adduono of the Rochester Americans, sharing the John B. Sollenberger Trophy.

The Firebirds finished their first AHL season with a record of 35–35–11 and placed third in the Southern Division. In the first round of the playoffs they faced the second place New Haven Nighthawks in a best-of-five series. The Firebirds lost the first two games on the road by scores of 3–6, and 1–7. At home for game three, Philadelphia won 4–1, but lost game four 2–5, to end the season.
 
1978–79
For the 1978–79 AHL season, the Firebirds were affiliated with the NHL's Colorado Rockies. Head coach Danny Belisle had moved on to the Washington Capitals, and was replaced by Armand "Bep" Guidolin. Gord Brooks finished second in the league with 43 goals, and led the team with 74 points. Larry Skinner was second in team scoring with 34 goals, 33 assists, and 67 points. The Firebirds lost their first ten games of the season, before defeating the Hershey Bears on November 10. The team never recovered from the bad start, and finished last overall in the AHL with a record of 23-49-8, and missing the playoffs. The Firebirds also scored a league worst 230 goals, and had the league's lowest average attendance at only 2,841 fans per game. The bad fortunes this season led to the team's departure from Philadelphia in the off-season.

 
1979–80
The Firebirds relocated to Syracuse, New York for the 1979–80 AHL season, playing home games at Onondaga County War Memorial Arena. The Firebirds were led by rookie coach Michel Parizeau, who recently retired from a seven-year WHA playing career. Gord Brooks led the team in scoring again with 34 goals, 41 assists, and 75 points. Syracuse struggled on defence, allowing a league worst 364 goals against, and finished with a 31–42–7 record, and third place in the southern division.
