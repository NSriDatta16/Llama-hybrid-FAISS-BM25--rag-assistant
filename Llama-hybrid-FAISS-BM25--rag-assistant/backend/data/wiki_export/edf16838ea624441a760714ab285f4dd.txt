Anthropology

Tadić brotherhood in Piva

In Piva, a historical tribe of Old Herzegovina (now western Montenegro), there was a brotherhood (bratstvo) named Tadić. This brotherhood was one of the largest and oldest brotherhoods of Piva.  recorded 45 houses of Tadić in Piva. They have for long lived in Smriječno (in Plužine), where they are mainly concentrated, while one or two houses exist in Potprisoje, Donja Brezna and Stabna, which they settled later. The brotherhood has the slava (patron saint veneration) of Jovanjdan (John the Baptist). It belongs to the family tree of the old brotherhood of Branilović, one of two family trees in Piva from which many Pivan families descend from according to tradition; the Branilović either left or was absorbed by other families. A knez Jovan Tadić is mentioned in a 1673 document from the Piva Monastery, as one of the witnesses regarding the bequest of Bare on Jezerce to the monastery. According to one story, 17th-century hajduk Bajo Pivljanin's mother was a Tadić. Families descending from the brotherhood are widespread in former Yugoslavia. Former President of Serbia, Boris Tadić, is a descendant of the brotherhood.
