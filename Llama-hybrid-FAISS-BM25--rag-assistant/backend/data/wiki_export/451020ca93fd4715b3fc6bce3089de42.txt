Mighty Motorsports is a defunct NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series team. Used to be owned by racer Rob Ferguson, it fielded the No. 24 PMI Heating and Air Conditioning Chevrolet Silverado driven by Wayne Edwards in the early part of 2006 before its closure. The team was sold to Ferguson by previous owner Lonnie Troxell in 2005. The team's corporate headquarters were located in Poway, California, but the shop was in Mooresville, North Carolina.

The team made its debut in 2000 at Homestead-Miami Speedway. Edwards, who was a co-owner of the team, drove the No. 93 WorldBestBuy.com Chevy to a 27th-place finish. Edwards ran twelve other races that year, his best finish a 19th at Loudon, leading to a 30th-place finish in the owner's points. Edwards made two starts for the team in 2001, both resulting in early engine failures. Other drivers raced for Troxell that year were Mike Harmon, Jerry Hill, and Mike Leffingwell. Hill had the best finish for the team, posting a 17th-place run at Texas.
