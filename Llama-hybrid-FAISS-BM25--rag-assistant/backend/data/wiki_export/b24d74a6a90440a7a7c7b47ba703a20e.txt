Pull is the third studio album by American rock band Winger. The album was released in 1993 by Atlantic Records.

Replacing Beau Hill, Kip Winger took the production reigns with the help of Mike Shipley, who had previously worked on Def Leppard's 1992 album, Adrenalize. With Winger and Shipley at the helm, the album's production was on a considerable budget and marked a significant change in Winger's sound, eschewing their glam metal anthems prevalent in their first two albums for a harder and more aggressive style of music with a good dose of socio-political leanings on tracks like "Blind Revolution Mad", "In for the Kill" and "Who's the One". The material was also less commercial and radio-friendly, evident especially in the track "Junkyard Dog (Tears on Stone)" incorporating contemporary heavy metal and progressive elements and clocking in at 6:54.

The album is often regarded as the favourite among the group's fans, but in terms of sales figures the album was not as successful as the two first albums, peaking at #83 on Billboard's Album chart. However, the lead single "Down Incognito" reached #15 on the Mainstream rock Billboard chart.

Pull was recorded by Winger as a trio, as guitarist/keyboardist Paul Taylor left the band after the In the Heart of the Young tour in 1992.

A bonus track called "Hell to Pay" was available on the Japanese version of the album. This track is also included on the 2001 compilation The Very Best of Winger.
