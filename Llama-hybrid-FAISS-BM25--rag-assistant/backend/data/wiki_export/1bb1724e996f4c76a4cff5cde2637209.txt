History
Vila Boa was once a district (1988) of Formosa, and for years was just a small village with a gas station and a few houses on the main road to Salvador.  It is 95 kilometres northeast of Formosa.  It has grown rapidly with the arrival of farmers from the south of the country in search of inexpensive land to plant soybeans and raise cattle.  In 1992 it was dismembered from Formosa and raised to municipal status.

The economy
The economy is based on agriculture (rice, coffee, sugarcane, and corn), cattle raising (34,000 head in 2006), services, public administration, and small transformation industries.
