In the high-altitude area of over , however, there exists violent local air circulation and its yearly precipitation is several hundred mm more than that in the foothill area. Thus, snow and hailstones frequently fall, presenting conditions for the development of glaciers.

Climbing
Geladaindong was first climbed by Japanese team in 1985 after three years of trying to obtain a permit. They ascended the peak via the northwest ridge approaching from the northeast.

In 1997 an American team climbed a new route up the northeast face (55–60°). The team consisted of William N. Rom M.D., Dan Luchtel PhD, and Mark Newcomb.  Mark Newcomb also pioneered a face solo route on the same expedition.

Although a dangerous peak to climb, Geladaindong is popular among Chinese mountain climbers. In 1994, the Mountaineering Association of Peking University (MAPKU) became the first Chinese climbing team to reach the summit of Geladaindong.
