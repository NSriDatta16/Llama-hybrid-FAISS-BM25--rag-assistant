École des Pionniers de Maillardville is a  French first language school located in Port Coquitlam, British Columbia, Canada. It serves the French speaking population of the Metro Vancouver area.

The school was founded in 2000 and is located on the former Terry Fox Secondary School grounds.  It incorporates classes formerly held at Millside Elementary, Como Lake Middle and Centennial Secondary School in Coquitlam. The school now has the IB Diploma Programme in French for grade 11 and 12 students, and has the MYP IB Programme for grade 7 to 10 students.  Not directly affiliated with École des Pionniers, but located within it and often a stepping stone to attending the school, is an independent non-profit francophone preschool called Prématernelle Les p'tits lutins.

New School Construction 
In 2013 the provincial government announced plans to build a new facility for the school, which has since been completed during the winter of 2018. The 32.7 million dollar project received joint funding from the Government of British Columbia ($27.3 million contributed for the replacement), the Government of Canada ($3.7 million contributed for community and child-care spaces within the school), and the Conseil Scolaire Francophone de la Colombie-Britannique ($1.7 million contributed for generalities and additional classrooms). Since the old school's demolition, the space has since been turned into a playing field and parking area.
