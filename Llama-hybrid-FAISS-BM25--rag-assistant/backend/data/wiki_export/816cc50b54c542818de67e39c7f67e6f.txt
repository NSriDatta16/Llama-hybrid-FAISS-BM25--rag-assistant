Donald William Beaupré (born September 19, 1961) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for 17 seasons with the Minnesota North Stars, Washington Capitals, Ottawa Senators, and Toronto Maple Leafs. 

A two-time NHL All-Star, Beaupré played in the 33rd National Hockey League All-Star Game in 1981 and 43rd National Hockey League All-Star Game in 1992. As a rookie in 1981, Beaupré appeared in the Stanley Cup Finals with the North Stars, losing to the New York Islanders.

Playing career
Beaupré emerged as a goaltender in the OHA for the Sudbury Wolves.  In 1979–80 he won 28 games and was named to the league's first All-star team.

As one of the top rated goalies in the 1980 NHL Entry Draft, Beaupré didn't last very long and was claimed 37th overall by the Minnesota North Stars.  In 1981 with Minnesota, Beaupré split goaltending with Gilles Meloche and in his rookie year appeared in the 1981 All-Star Game (his other All-Star appearance would come in 1993), and although Minnesota would lose the series, recorded a 4–2 win in Game 4 of the 1981 Stanley Cup Finals against the powerful New York Islanders.

Traded in 1989 to the Washington Capitals, Beaupré continued to play well and benefit from Washington's solid defence in the early 1990s. He led the NHL with five shutouts in 1990–91, then won a career-high 29 games the next year. By the mid-'90s, the Capitals were looking to Olaf Kolzig to lead them in goal. Beaupré was shipped to the weak Ottawa Senators where he saw plenty of rubber in 71 games over two seasons. Beaupre became the first Ottawa netminder to register a shutout. By the time he was traded to Toronto in 1995–96, the veteran's reflexes were disappearing with age. He retired in 1997, after spending most of the season with the St. John's Maple Leafs of the AHL.

Beaupré is the owner and president of an aerial lift equipment company in Minneapolis.
