The 20th World Cup season began in August 1985 in Argentina (for men only), resumed in December 1985 in Italy, and concluded in March 1986 in Canada.  Because of the South America events (held during winter in the Southern Hemisphere), this was the first time that the World Cup season had started prior to December 1.  The overall champions were Marc Girardelli of Luxembourg, his second consecutive overall win, and Maria Walliser of Switzerland, her first.

This was the first season in which a separate discipline championship was awarded for Super G, which had been introduced as a part of giant slalom in the 1983 season.  The addition increased the number of discipline champions to five, which led to the elimination of the Combined discipline championship the next season.  Combined would not award another World Cup discipline championship until after the introduction of the "Super Combined" (downhill/slalom) or "Alpine combined" (Super G/slalom) races, but that championship would only last from the 2006/07 season until it was again eliminated after the 2011/12 season.

In addition, the number of men's races that counted for World Cup championship points reached 45, which remains the all-time high. There were also two individual parallel slaloms held for men (one in Vienna in January and one as the final event in Bromont) that only counted toward the Nations Cup team championship.
