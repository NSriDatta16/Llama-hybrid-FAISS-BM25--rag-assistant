With over 20 years of public service at the state and federal level, Ausley was a member of the Florida House of Representatives from 2000 to 2008. Her district then included the northern half Leon County, including most of Tallahassee, and the northwest part of adjoining Jefferson County.

2010 Chief Financial Officer campaign

In 2022, Ausley questioned the need for a special session on the Reedy Creek Improvement Act, claiming it adds "insult to injury" and goes "after a private business." She also argued that Disney has made Florida "what it is."
