Codville Lagoon Marine Provincial Park is a provincial park in British Columbia, Canada, located on the southwest end of King Island. The park was created in 1965 because it is a significant site to the Heiltsuk People. This park, which is approximately 755 ha. in area, has an unmaintained trail to Sagar Lake which has a red sand beach. Created in 1992, it was expanded in 1995 by the incorporation of the former Sugar Lake Provincial Park.
