The Royal Air Force's Logistics Command was a command formed to provide logistics support for the RAF.

History
The Command was formed on 1 April 1994 and its role was to provide logistics support to the RAF. The formation of Logistics Command resulted from the Government's PROSPECT study which was aimed to achieve a 20% reduction in the UK armed forces' headquarters staff to match the previous 'Options for Change' front-line cuts.  This provided the mandate to create a centre of excellence in logistics management within the RAF with the task of delivering the best standards of support for the front-line whilst at the same time achieving significant reductions in cost.

The Command brought together most of the logistics functions of the Air Member for Supply and Organisation with those of RAF Support Command.  These included the Maintenance Group Defence Agency, Support Command Communication and Information Systems, the Radio Introduction Unit, and the Central Servicing Development Establishment.  Logistics Command was headquartered across two sites, RAF Brampton and RAF Wyton; on the later base 4 purpose-built open-planned pavilions were built.  Its motto was Sustentamus ut Bellent which means 'We sustain that they may fight'.

The Strategic Defence Review (SDR) in 1997 marked the beginning of a process of radical and far-reaching modernization of the way the Armed Forces conducted defence activities including the creation of unified logistics support.  Many of the RAF's innovations in Logistics Command were incorporated into the SDR's 'Smart Procurement Initiative'.

Logistics Command was disbanded on 31 October 1999 and thereafter the majority of its functions were subsumed by the tri-Services Defence Logistics Organisation which stood up formally on 1 April 2000.
