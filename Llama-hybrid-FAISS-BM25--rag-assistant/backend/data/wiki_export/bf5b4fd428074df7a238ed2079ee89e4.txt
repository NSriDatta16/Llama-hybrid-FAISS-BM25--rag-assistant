History

The Northern Nevada Aces were founded in 2001 in Reno, Nevada to begin play in the USL D-3 Pro League, considered the third division of the American soccer pyramid. They would play two seasons in the league, finishing 5th in 2001 and 6th in 2002, both in the Western Conference.

The Aces would voluntarily drop down to the newly created amateur Men's Premier Soccer League, becoming a founding member in 2003 alongside two other former USL D-3 Pro clubs, the Chico Rooks and Arizona Sahuaros. A neighboring new amateur team, the Nevada Wonders, would debut in the fourth division USL Premier Development League (PDL), in Carson City, Nevada in 2003.

The Aces would finish 4th in the regular season in 2003, losing in the play-off semifinals to the neighboring Utah Salt Ratz 9-0. The club would drop to 9th place in the next season in 2004, folding following the season.

The club's away colors were red and black with white trim.
