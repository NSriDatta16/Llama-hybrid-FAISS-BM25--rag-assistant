Doonies Rare Breeds Farm was a farm in Aberdeen, Scotland. Doonies Farm had one of Scotland's largest collections of rare and endangered farm animal breeds. The farm occupied 134 acres and was nationally recognised as a breeding centre for rare breeds. There were 23 rare animal breeds on the farm, such as pigs, cattle, sheep, horses, chickens and ducks. During the Easter time of year, new arrivals could be seen such as lambs, calves, chicks and foals.

Doonies farm stood on the coast, just past the old fishing village of Cove in Aberdeen, Scotland.

At the time of its closure, Doonies Farm operated as a family-run business; however, the farm was owned and operated by Aberdeen City Council for roughly 20 years. Doonies Farm finally closed on the 21st of August, 2023, as a result of the nearby ETZ (Energy Transition Zone) being built by the council.
