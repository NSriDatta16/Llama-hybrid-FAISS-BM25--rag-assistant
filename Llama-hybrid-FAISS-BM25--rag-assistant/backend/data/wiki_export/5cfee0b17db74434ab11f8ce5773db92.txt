Teams
Mt. Carmel's athletic teams are nicknamed the Golden Aces and the school's colors are maroon and gold. The school received the nickname during the 1915-1916 basketball season. Before then, the school's athletic teams were called the Maroon & Gold. The boys' basketball team participated in a tournament in the Wood River area and won the tournament championship. A sportswriter for the area said that the team played like "Five Golden Aces." The players and students like it and teams have competed as the Golden Aces ever since.
