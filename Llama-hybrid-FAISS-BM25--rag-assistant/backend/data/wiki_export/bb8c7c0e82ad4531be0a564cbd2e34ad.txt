is a fighting video game developed and published by Capcom for the PlayStation 2. A spin-off of the Onimusha series. Similarly to Super Smash Bros., Blade Warriors is a 2D fighter game featuring many of the characters of the Onimusha franchise.

Players may use standard sword fighting with combos, blocks, block-breaking kicks, jump, switch planes (the different levels of the fighting area), use various items, and disarm their opponents. It also includes the original aspects of the Onimusha series, including the absorption of souls and special elemental attacks (lightning, fire, and wind). The story takes place months after the events in Onimusha 2 and before the events in Onimusha 3.
