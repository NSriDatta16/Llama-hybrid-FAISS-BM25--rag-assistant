Plot 
Nico and Dani are 17-year-old friends spending the summer together at Dani's parent's beach house, while his parents are traveling. They aim to meet girls and lose their virginity, and in the meantime they practice mutual masturbation and other sexual practices. They meet a pair of cousins, Berta and Elena. Nico is much more interested in Elena than Dani is in Berta. Nico has sex with Elena, making Dani jealous of her.

Dani realizes he is in love with Nico and tells him this, causing an argument. Dani then goes out to get drunk and meets a gay writer friend of his father. After having dinner and sailing with him, Dani proposes that the two have sex, but runs away and returns home to Nico. The friends reconcile by the end of the summer.
