History
The State of Illinois designated Route 103 in 1924 between Ripley and Beardstown. A road between Ripley and the route's current eastern terminus was first marked on state highway maps in 1924; this route began at Ripley and ran parallel to and south of the current route on its western half, before turning north and following the eastern half of the current alignment. Route 103 was first numbered on the 1929 Illinois highway map. The western terminus of Route 103 moved from Ripley to its current location in 1932, shifting the western half of the highway to its present alignment. The community of Layton, which was near Sugar Grove, was marked along the route until 1951.
