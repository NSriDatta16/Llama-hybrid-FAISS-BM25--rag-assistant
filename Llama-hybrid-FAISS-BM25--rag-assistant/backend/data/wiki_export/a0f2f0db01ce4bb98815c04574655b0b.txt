Antoinette Batumubwira (born 1956, in Ngozi, Burundi) is a Burundian politician. She was Minister of Foreign Affairs of Burundi from 2005 to 2009. She is married to former foreign minister Jean-Marie Ngendahayo.

In late 2007, Batumubwira was named as a candidate to succeed Alpha Oumar Konar√© as Chairperson of the Commission of the African Union in the election for that post in early 2008. The government tried to obtain the support of other African countries for her candidacy, and African Great Lakes nations pledged that they would support her; however, the government later withdrew her candidacy and backed Jean Ping of Gabon.
