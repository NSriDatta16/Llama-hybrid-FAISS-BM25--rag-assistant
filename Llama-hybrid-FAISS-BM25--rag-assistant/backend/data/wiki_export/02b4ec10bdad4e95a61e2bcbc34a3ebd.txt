Airbles railway station serves the Airbles area of Motherwell, North Lanarkshire in Scotland. It is located around  away from Fir Park stadium, home of Motherwell F.C.

History 
The station was a new construction in 1989 by British Rail, on the Hamilton Circle.

The station missed out on services from the new Larkhall branch because the reopened line connects in a westerly direction as a result of the M74 now being in the location of the previous easterly junction.
