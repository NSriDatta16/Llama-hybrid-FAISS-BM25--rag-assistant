Orange is an electoral district of the Legislative Assembly in the Australian state of New South Wales. It is a regional electorate that covers four local government areas in their entirety: the City of Orange, Cabonne Council, Parkes Shire and Forbes Shire. 

The seat has been held by Philip Donato since a by-election in November 2016. Donato was initially elected as a member of the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party but resigned in 2022 and became an Independent.

History
The electorate of Orange was created in 1859. Between 1920 and 1927, Orange and Hartley were absorbed into Bathurst, which elected three members under proportional representation. In 1927, Bathurst, Hartley and Orange were recreated as single-member electorates.

The area leans strongly toward the National Party. The Labor Party hasn't held the seat since 1947, although it came close to winning at a 1996 by-election. The Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party won the seat at the 2016 by-election, after Andrew Gee resigned to successfully contest the federal electorate of Calare.
