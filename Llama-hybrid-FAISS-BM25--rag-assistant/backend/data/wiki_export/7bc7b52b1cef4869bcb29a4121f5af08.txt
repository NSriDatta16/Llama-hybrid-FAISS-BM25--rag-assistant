History
Great Wyrley joined the West Midlands (Regional) League in 1980 and won three divisional titles. In 2005 they gained promotion to the Premier Division for the first time and finished third in their first season in the top division, but financial problems at the start of the subsequent season led them to start the season late, fail to fulfil a number of fixtures, and ultimately withdraw from the league in October 2006.

They won the local JW Hunt Cup twice and the Staffordshire Challenge Vase on three occasions.
