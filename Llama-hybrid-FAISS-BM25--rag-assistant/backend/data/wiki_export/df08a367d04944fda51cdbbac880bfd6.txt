Baseball Night in America is an American television presentation of Major League Baseball (MLB) games produced by Fox Sports for the Fox network on Saturday or Thursday nights.

History
While Fox has aired Fox Saturday Baseball games since 1996, Fox only began using the Baseball Night in America branding in 2012. In the inaugural season, the Baseball Night in America branding was used for games from May 26 to July 7.

Until 2021, Baseball Night in America aired every Saturday from the last week in May to the second week in July. Beginning with the 2019 season, late season Fox Saturday Baseball games moved from the afternoon to prime time. therefore  a separate section of games was added for September. Some of these September games aired on Thursday night as Thursday Night Baseball.

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic delaying the 2020 season, Fox Saturday Baseball returned to airing some afternoon Saturday games on July 25, August 29 and September 5. Fox aired Saturday primetime games between July 25 and August 1, and between September 12 and September 26, as well as on August 15. Fox returned to their 2019 scheduling for the 2021 season.

For the 2022 season, Fox aired Baseball Night in America games every Saturday from May 28 to September 10, as well as on Saturday, October 1. Games aired on Thursday nights on September 15 and September 22. This is the result of Fox increasing the amount of games they air on broadcast television in their new television contract, as well as a side effect of the loss of Fox's Thursday night NFL games outside of local syndication.

For the 2023 season, Fox will air Baseball Night in America games every Saturday from May 6 to July 29, as well as on August 12, August 26, September 2 and September 30. Games will air on Thursday nights on August 3, August 17, September 14 and September 21. For the first time since 2020, Fox also aired afternoon Fox Saturday Baseball games on April 1, April 22, April 29 and June 24.
