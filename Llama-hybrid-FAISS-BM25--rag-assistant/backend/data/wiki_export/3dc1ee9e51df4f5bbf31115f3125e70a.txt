The Texas Tech University System is a Public university system in Texas with five member universities. Headquartered in Lubbock, Texas, the Texas Tech University System is a $2.5 billion enterprise focused on advancing higher education, health care, research, and outreach with approximately 21,000 employees, more than 63,000 students, nearly 370,000 alumni and an endowment valued at $1.7 billion. In its short history (established in 1996), the TTU System has grown tremendously with 24 academic locations statewide and internationally.

History
On February 10, 1923, Texas Technological College (now named Texas Tech University) was founded, and that August, a committee selected to locate the institution in Lubbock. The Board of Directors of Texas Technological College (now named the Board of Regents of the Texas Tech University System) was established to oversee the institution.

In 1969, the Texas Tech University School of Medicine (now named Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center), was founded as separate multi-campus institution from Texas Tech University. It was also overseen by same board of regents as Texas Tech University.

In 1985, then state senator, and future TTU System chancellor, John T. Montford proposed the creation of the Texas Tech University System.

In 1999, the Texas Legislature formally established the Texas Tech University System, consisting of the same two institutions, overseen by the board of regents, and the newly created position of chancellor to provide leadership and support for both Texas Tech University, and Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center.

In 2007, Angelo State University left the Texas State University System and joined the Texas Tech University System. On May 18, 2013, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center at El Paso was established as a standalone institution after previously being a regional site for TTUHSC in El Paso.

On August 6, 2020, the Texas Tech University System and Midwestern State University agreed to a memorandum of understanding to begin the process of MSU Texas becoming the fifth university to join the system. The process continued on June 8, 2021, when Governor Greg Abbott signed HB 1522 into law. Midwestern State officially became a component institution when HB 1522 went into effect on September 1, 2021.

Component institutions

The merger received widespread support in both Lubbock and San Angelo. The bill was approved by the full House on April 24, 2007, and by the Senate in a unanimous vote on May 15, 2007. On May 23, 2007, Gov. Rick Perry signed the bill.

Governance and administration

Board of Regents
The government, control, and direction of the Texas Tech University System is vested in a nine-member Board of Regents appointed by the governor and confirmed by the legislature.  Each Regent serves a six-year term, and appointments are staggered so that three members of the Board's terms expire in odd-numbered years. In addition to the nine members, there also is a student regent who is appointed by the governor to serve a one-year term that begins on June 1 of each year.

In 1923, Governor Pat Neff appointed the first members of the Board of Directors of Texas Technological College (as the council was known until 1969). When the name of Texas Technological College was changed in 1969, so did the council to: Board of Regents of Texas Tech University. The council has been known by its current name, Board of Regents of the Texas Tech University System, after the Texas Tech University System was established in 1996.

Chancellor
The Chancellor is the chief executive officer of the Texas Tech University System appointed by, and responsible to, the Board of Regents. The Chancellor carries out the policies of the System as determined by the Regents and has direct responsibility for all aspects of the operations of the Texas Tech University System's six primary components: Texas Tech University, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Angelo State University, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center El Paso, Midwestern State University and the Texas Tech University System Administration.

The Texas Tech University System has had five Chancellors: John T. Montford, David Smith, Kent Hance, Robert L. Duncan, and Tedd L. Mitchell.

Presidents
The presidents of Texas Tech University, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Angelo State University, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center El Paso and Midwestern State University are appointed by the Chancellor and are the CEOs of their respective institutions and responsible for the strategic operation of each institution.
