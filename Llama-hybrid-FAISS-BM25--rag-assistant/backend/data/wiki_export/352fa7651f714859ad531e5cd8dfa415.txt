The Real News Network (TRNN) is an independent, nonprofit news organization based in Baltimore, MD that covers both national and international news.

History 

TRNN was founded by documentary producer Paul Jay and Mishuk Munier in September 2003, with the goal of creating a news network that made complicated concepts accessible to the average person. 

TRNN moved to Baltimore in June 2014, with the focus of telling stories about urban America, specifically focusing on the city's issues, including crime, education, and housing that are found throughout the United States. Communications executive John Duda became the organization's executive director in June 2020.

TRNN does not accept funding from advertising, governments, or corporations - it is sustained through donations from viewers and foundations, and has a small for-profit segment.
