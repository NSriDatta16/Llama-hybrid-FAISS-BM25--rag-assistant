The 1st World Cup races began in early January in West Germany and concluded in late March in the United States. Jean-Claude Killy of France dominated the men's competition, winning each of the three disciplines and the overall title.  Nancy Greene of Canada edged out Marielle Goitschel of France for the women's overall title, her first of two consecutive titles, defending successfully in 1968.

Killy's 12 race wins for the season (amazingly, out of only 17 races during the season) stood as the record for wins in a season by a skier (male or female) until Ingemar Stenmark won 13 races in 1978-79.
