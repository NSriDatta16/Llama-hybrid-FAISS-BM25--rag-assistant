The Miss Alabama competition is the pageant that selects the representative for the state of Alabama in the annual Miss America Competition. 

Alabama has won three Miss America titles: Deidre Downs in 2005, Heather Whitestone (the first deaf woman to win the Miss America crown) in 1995, and Yolande Betbeze in 1951. Betbeze is also known as the contestant who refused to pose in a swimsuit, causing swimsuit sponsor Catalina Swimwear to pull out and ultimately start the Miss USA pageant.

Lindsay Fincher of Wedowee was crowned Miss Alabama 2022 on July 3, 2022 at the Alabama Theatre in Birmingham, Alabama. She competed for the title of Miss America 2023 at the Mohegan Sun in Uncasville, Connecticut in December 2022 where she was a Jean Bartel Social Impact Initiaive Finalist.
