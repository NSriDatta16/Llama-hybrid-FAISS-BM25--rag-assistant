This is a list of area codes in the U.S. state of Florida.

When the original North American area codes were introduced for a nationwide telephone numbering plan in 1947, the entire state was a single numbering plan area (NPA) with area code 305. In 1953, area code 813 was introduced for the western coast of Florida, and 904 was assigned for northern Florida in 1965. In 1988, area code 407 was introduced for the Orlando area. In 1995, area code 954 was introduced for Broward County. In 1996, area code 239 was introduced for southwest Florida and area code 352 for the areas around Gainesville and Ocala. Many new area codes were introduced in the first two decades of the 21st Century, as a result of city expansion and growth of telecommunication services.
