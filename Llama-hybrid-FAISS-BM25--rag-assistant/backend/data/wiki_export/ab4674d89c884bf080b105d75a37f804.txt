Noel Anthony Ratcliffe (born 17 January 1945) is an Australian professional golfer.

Ratcliffe turned to golf exceptionally late for a future professional, and didn't own a set of clubs until he was twenty-one. He studied pharmacy and worked for an insurance company and in public service before turning professional in 1974. Like many Australian golfers of his era, he divided his time between the PGA Tour of Australia and the European Tour. In his regular career he won three titles in Australasia and two in Europe, where his best year was 1978 when he finished 11th on the Order of Merit.

Since turning fifty he has been successful on the European Seniors Tour, where he topped the Order of Merit in 2000, made the top five on four other occasions, and won eight tournaments. He was the second man to win over one million Euro on the tour.
