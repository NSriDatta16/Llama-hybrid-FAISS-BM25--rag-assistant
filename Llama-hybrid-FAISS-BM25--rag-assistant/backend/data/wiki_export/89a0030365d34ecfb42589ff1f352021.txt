Premiership Round 3. 13 May
Glebe Dirty Reds 8 ( Muggivan, L. Cubitt tries;  A.Burge goal ) defeated Eastern Suburbs 0 at Wentworth park. crowd 4000
"Quite the liveliest, contest of the day was that at Wentworth Park, where about 4000 locals cheered the Reds to victory over the redoubtable Eastern Suburbs. It was fast and furious at times. Two men were carried off Injured. Two more were ordered off the field-one for indiscriminate kicking, and one for unnecessarily rough play. Now and then the spectators, worked to a pitch of excitement, started melees of their own. The game itaelf was a triumph for the local forwards, who ran over the opponents, and the Glebe backs, taking advantage of the situation, notched 8 points to nil."
