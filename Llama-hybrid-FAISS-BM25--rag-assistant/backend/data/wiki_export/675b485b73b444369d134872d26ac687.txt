Release
More Betterness! was released in October 1999. No Use for a Name co-headlined the Fat Tour, with the Mad Caddies, in February and March 2000. They embarked on a tour of Australia in June 2000. In November 2001, the band toured Arizona and California with Zero Down, HBA, and Diesel Boy.

Critical reception
Exclaim! wrote that the album "has the requisite guitar harmonics and occasional thrashing drum part, but mostly it is a pop record along the lines of Blink 182." The Los Angeles Times called More Betterness! "the band’s best-regarded full-length." CMJ New Music Report called it "intelligent punk rock" and a "refreshing change of pace." The Washington Post called the album "energetic," but noted that all the songs "tend to sound the same."
