Todd Landers is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera Neighbours, played by Kristian Schmid. He made his first appearance during the episode broadcast on 15 February 1988. Todd was introduced along with his younger sister Katie Landers (Sally Jensen). They were given an instant connection to the show through their aunt, Beverly Marshall (Lisa Armytage). After choosing to leave the serial in 1991, Schmid suggested to the producers that his character should be killed off, and Todd died in the episode broadcast on 13 July 1992. He reappeared as a spirit in the following episode.

Casting
Schmid was 12 years old when decided to sign himself up for an acting course in Melbourne. Three weeks later, Jan Russ, Neighbours' casting director, came to the school to hold auditions for the show. Russ said she was looking for a teenage boy, around 14 or 15, to play the role of Todd Landers. Schmid asked to audition and he was successfully cast in the role of Todd.

Schmid remained with Neighbours until his character was killed off at the age of 17. Schmid revealed that he had suggested that Todd was killed. He said "I spoke to the producers about a year before I left the show. The fact they gave me such a dramatic exit was what I wanted. It's flattering on a show like that". After his character's death, Schmid made one last appearance as Todd in the following episode.

Characterisation
Todd is Beverly Marshall's "cheekily independent nephew". He and his sister, Katie Landers (Sally Jensen), come to live with their aunt Beverly Marshall (Lisa Armytage) in Ramsay Street to escape their bullying father, who believes that his children should pay for his drinking habit. They become adopted members of Beverly and her husband, Jim Robinson's (Alan Dale) household. Todd is initially overprotective towards Katie and cynical. He later becomes a "conscientious student" who is easily distracted by his girlfriends.

Writers paired Todd with fellow student Cody Willis (Amelia Frid). Frid told Dawn Bebe from BIG! that Cody is "flirty and does her best to chase boys â€“ especially Todd". Frid was embarrassed by her character's actions. Schmid told a reporter from the magazine that their first on-screen kiss was really "embarrassing" because of the many cameramen watching. Producers established a relationship between Todd and Phoebe Bright (Simone Robertson) and they lose their virginity to each other. Phoebe falls pregnant and the couple are later seen discussing their options. They decide that Phoebe should have an abortion, but Todd changes his mind.

Storylines
Todd and his sister Katie Landers accompany family friend Hilary Robinson, to their aunt Beverly Marshall's wedding to Hilary's cousin, Jim Robinson. Todd is dismissive when Jim's children Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) and Lucy Robinson (Sasha Close) try to communicate with him and Katie. Shortly after the ceremony and before the beginning of Paul's vow renewal to his wife Gail Robinson (Fiona Corke), Todd steals Hilary's car keys to retrieve his and Katie's bags from the car. Todd and Katie run away but are eventually found by Jim's son Scott Robinson (Jason Donovan) and his wife, Charlene Robinson (Kylie Minogue).

Jim and Beverley agree to sacrifice their honeymoon to look after Todd and Katie and let them stay at Number 26 with them while Bob (Robin Harrison; Bruce Kilpatrick) and Annette (Tania Uren) work through their problems. During his first few months in Erinsborough, Todd manages to provoke the ire of local residents Harold Bishop (Ian Smith) and Nell Mangel (Vivean Gray). Later in the year, Todd finds himself at odds with street kid and graffiti artist Nick Page (Mark Stevens) who has previously graffitied Jim's fence and things are not helped when Emma Gordon (Tamsin West), Todd's crush, develops an attraction to Nick. Eventually, Todd softens towards Nick when his grandmother dies and he moves in with the Robinsons.

After a babysitting blunder, which leads to Jamie Clarke (S.J. Dey) nearly drowning, Todd runs away from home and begins living in a squat with a petty criminal named Skinner (Mat Stevenson) who forces him into crime. Nick, acting on a hunch, follows Todd and Skinner who are about to rob a warehouse, which backfires, resulting in Nick's arrest. Racked with guilt, Todd returns home and confesses to get Nick off the hook, resulting in Todd being cautioned. The stress of Todd's recent behaviour causes Helen Daniels (Anne Haddy), Jim's mother-in-law to have a stroke.

While staying with Paul and Gail at Number 22, Todd comes face to face with Skinner again who forces his way in and threatens to hurt Katie if Todd does not comply with the theft of the VCR. Gail returns home and rescues the Landers children, Skinner bolts with Todd in hot pursuit and is collared by Nick and eventually arrested. Katie tells Todd that Bob is in Erinsborough and initially disbelieves her until he phones Annette, who confirms he walked out two weeks earlier. Todd talks to Bob and eventually obtains a confession about trying to extort money out of Helen. Bob tries to leave but Todd catches him and Bob suggests he come up North with him. Todd is about to go with Bob, but Jim and Beverly (now Shaunna O'Grady) arrive and stop him.

Alison stays with the Robinsons, but when Helen finds $30 missing, Alison is accused of being a thief. Todd refuses to believe the accusation, and decides to go back to Adelaide with Alison when her visit ends. On the day Todd and Alison are supposed to leave, Todd discovers the brooch Helen's late husband Bill gave her for her 21st birthday in Alison's bag. Todd confronts Alison and she is rude to him, insisting her actions are no big deal, Jim drives her to the bus station and she is never seen again.

When fellow student Melissa Jarrett (Jade Amenta) begins taking piano lessons from Hilary, she is attracted to Todd, who is initially shy and begins avoiding her. Melissa is unimpressed but eventually softens when Todd tells her about his experience with Alison. Todd and Melissa begin dating, but he receives a phone call from Annette, who believes she is able to cope with Todd and Katie now. Todd is allowed to stay in Erinsborough while Katie goes back to Adelaide. Melissa's father, Ben (David Ravenswood) takes a dislike to Todd, who he feels is leading his daughter astray after misconstruing a situation with Todd being in Melissa's room.

The Jarretts go to America for several months, leaving Todd devastated. Cody, a classmate of Todd and Melissa's at Erinsborough High takes more than a passing interest in Todd and stages a Hawaiian-themed party, which is a ruse to have Todd as the only guest in order to seduce him. After Christmas, Melissa returns to find Todd and Cody kissing passionately and promptly breaks up with Todd. Todd is incensed when Melissa begins flirting with Hilary's son Matt Robinson (Ashley Paske), in order to make him jealous.

On Todd's 16th birthday, he befriends Josh Anderson (Jeremy Angerson), who moves to Erinsborough from Mildura with his parents who have bought the newsagent's on Anson's Corner.

However, Beverly's second miscarriage is the final straw for her marriage to Jim, which results in Beverly leaving for Perth but not before taking Todd back to Adelaide.

They agree to keep in touch via long distance, but several months later, Cody writes to Todd telling him she has found someone else.

At Christmas, Todd elects to stay in Erinsborough rather than going to Surfers Paradise, Queensland with Josh, Lucy and Cody's brother Brad Willis (Scott Michaelson).
