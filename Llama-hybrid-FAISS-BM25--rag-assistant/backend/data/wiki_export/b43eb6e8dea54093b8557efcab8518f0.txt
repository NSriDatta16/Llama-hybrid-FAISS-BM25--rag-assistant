Oud-Leusden is a hamlet in the Dutch province of Utrecht. It is a part of the municipality of Leusden, and lies about 4Â km south of Amersfoort.

History
Oud-Leusden ("old-Leusden") was formerly just called "Leusden". The name is known from the year 777, when villa Lisaduna was a large farm complex with defences. Although it was assumed to be located near the current location of Oud-Leusden, no evidence of this complex has been found.

The church tower of Oud-Leusden was originally part of a church, which before the reformation was dedicated to Saint Anthony. In the nineteenth century, most of the churchgoing population lived in the nearby village of Leusbroek (now Leusden-Zuid), and the church was replaced with a new one in Leusbroek, and demolished in 1828.

Oud-Leusden is not a statistical entity, and the postal authorities have placed it under Leusden. The hamlet consists of about 15 houses.
