Design

The exterior body is around four inches shorter and has a differently shaped nose. Some cues, such as the steering wheel, derive from Ferrari's F1 vehicles of the past. Unique parts of the GG50 are its dashboard and the fact that the GG50 uses the Pioneer AVIC–X1R satellite navigation system.
