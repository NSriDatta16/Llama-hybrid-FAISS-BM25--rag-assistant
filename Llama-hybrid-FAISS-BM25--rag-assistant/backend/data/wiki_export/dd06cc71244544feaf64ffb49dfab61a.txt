Mick Jones is Foreigner guitarist Mick Jones' self-titled debut/studio album, released in 1989 and his only solo release as of 2023.

Released on Atlantic Records, this album included Billy Joel and Carly Simon as guest singers. Joel sang with Jones on the song "Just Wanna Hold" and Simon sang with Jones on the songs "That's the Way My Love Is" and "Write Tonight". It is widely believed that the co-composer "M.
