Tingwall Airport , also known as Lerwick/Tingwall Airport, is located in the Tingwall valley, near the village of Gott,  northwest of Lerwick in Mainland, Shetland, Scotland. Although it is the nearest airport to Lerwick, it is not Shetland's main airport, which is Sumburgh, rather, it is Shetland's inter-island flight hub.

Tingwall Aerodrome has a CAA Ordinary Licence (Number P614) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction as authorised by the licensee (Shetland Islands Council).

It was opened in 1976.

Statistics

Accidents and incidents
In 1996, an air ambulance lost altitude while turning to final approach for Runway 2 in strong and gusting winds, crashing 1.5 km short of the runway. The pilot was killed, and the doctor and nurse in the passenger cabin were injured. (Their patient had already been delivered to Inverness.) Lack of adequate ground lighting or other visual cues during the nighttime approach was a factor.
