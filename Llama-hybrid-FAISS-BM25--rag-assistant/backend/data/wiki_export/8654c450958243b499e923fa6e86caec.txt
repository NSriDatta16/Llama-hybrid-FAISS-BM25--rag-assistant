(Latin for '[signed] with one's own hand'), abbreviated to m.p. or mppr.  or mppria is a phrase sometimes used at the end of typewritten or printed documents when there is no handwritten signature. It is typically found just after the name(s) of the person(s) who would have signed the document if it had not been printed or typewritten.

It is also found in several ancient documents in front of or after the writer's signature at the end of the document.
