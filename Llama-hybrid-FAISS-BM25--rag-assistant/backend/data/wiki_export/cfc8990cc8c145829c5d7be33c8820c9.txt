Sefronia is the eighth album by singer-songwriter Tim Buckley, released in September 1973.

Production
The album was produced by Denny Randell. It was recorded at Paramount Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California. Other tracks were recorded at Record Plant, in New York, and at Devonshire Sound Studios in North Hollywood.

Critical reception
AllMusic wrote that Buckley's "voice isn't as stunning as usual on his next-to-last album, but the bigger problem is the material, which is usually forced and pedestrian." Trouser Press wrote: "Denny Randell’s anachronistic-on-impact LA white-soul production, which pours syrupy strings over several numbers, is hardest to digest on poorly chosen middle-of-the-road love songs that didn’t suit Buckley at all." NME declared that the album is "widely agreed to be Buckley’s most over-produced and underwhelming effort."
