Christopher Aaron Hornbrook is an American drummer and a founding member of Metalcore/Post-hardcore band, Poison the Well. He also is working with Dhani Harrison and Killer Be Killed and The Black Queen singer, Greg Puciato. From 2014 to 2018, Hornbrook was also a member of Senses Fail.

Early life 
Chris Hornbrook was born in Hollywood, Florida to French-Canadian immigrants, Donald Hornbrook and Moisette Maltais, in the early nineteen eighties. He started playing local South Florida punk shows at the age of fifteen with his high school garage band before being asked to join a local punk band called Last Minute. He met future band member Ryan Primack as he was playing bass in the band. At seventeen Hornbrook was asked to join an early incarnation of Poison the Well dubbed Doubting Thomas. Not too long after the bands' formation they had to change their name to An Acre Lost due to Doubting Thomas already being a side project of industrial band Skinny Puppy.

After a brief hiatus with An Acre Lost Hornbrook rejoined the band and the name was changed to Poison the Well. During his junior year of high school, he toured with the band during breaks from school. Then during his senior year, Poison the Well played a few shows up the east coast of the United States one weekend a month.

There is footage of the band performing at the now defunct CBGB's on YouTube from around this period. Once he graduated high school he started to pursue the band more seriously as a career.

Drumming style and influences 
His drumming style has been described as very musical and heavy hitting with an emphasis on groove and feel. He was quoted as saying: “I think fundamentally I always strive to do what the song calls for. Whether it’s a lot, or really simple, or whatever. I think that’s the most important thing. That’s the role that the drummer has, to hold everything together. Play a beat and be really musical. Not to say that I don’t enjoy overplaying, but it has to be the right sort of environment for that. I’m not a big fan of guys that like to do a lot and it sounds like they’re trampling over the music because they’re trying to prove whatever point they’re trying to prove. Ultimately, I look to serve the song and do exactly what it needs to be effective from the drumming department." Ghostcult Magazine was quoted as saying "Chris is one of the most distinctive drummers in music for almost 20 years".

Hornbrook has stated that he was "obsessed" with English rock band Queen drummer Roger Taylor when he first started playing. Other early influences were Matt Cameron, Dave Abbruzzese and Dave Grohl. His later influences expanded to Billy Cobham and Chris Dave.

Poison the Well 

Hornbrook started working with Poison the Well in 1998. He has drummed on all five of the bands' full-length records, both EPs and performed on all the touring in support of those records. Alongside being a founding member he is also considered to be a part of the core lineup alongside guitar player Ryan Primack and vocalist Jeffrey Moreira.

In an interview he did with The Washington Post during the promotion of the bands' fourth record "Versions", he stated, "I wanted to push the envelope. Thinking deep down I wasn’t trying to prove anything to anyone else, but prove to ourselves that we could make a record better than our last one and make something different and innovative.” Poison the Well are considered as one of the fathers of what is now referred to as contemporary "Metalcore" helping to popularize the genre. They were also an influential band during the early 2000s Post-hardcore "boom".
