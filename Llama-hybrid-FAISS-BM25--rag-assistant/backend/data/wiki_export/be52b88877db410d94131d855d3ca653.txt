Brian Skyrms (born 1938) is an American philosopher, Distinguished Professor of Logic and Philosophy of Science and Economics at the University of California, Irvine, and a professor of philosophy at Stanford University.  He has worked on problems in the philosophy of science, causation, decision theory, game theory, and the foundations of probability.

Education and career

Skyrms graduated from Lehigh University in 1960 and earned his Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Pittsburgh in 1964.  He taught at several different universities, before teaching at the University of Illinois, Chicago from 1968 until 1980, when he moved to the University of California, Irvine.

Skyrms is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences and one of two living philosophers (along with Allan Gibbard) to be elected a Fellow of the National Academy of Sciences.

Philosophical work

Most recently, his work has focused on the evolution of social norms using evolutionary game theory.  His two recent books Evolution of the Social Contract  and The Stag Hunt  are both on this topic.  These books use arguments and examples from evolutionary game theory to cover topics of interest to political philosophy, philosophy of social science, philosophy of language, and the philosophy of biology.
