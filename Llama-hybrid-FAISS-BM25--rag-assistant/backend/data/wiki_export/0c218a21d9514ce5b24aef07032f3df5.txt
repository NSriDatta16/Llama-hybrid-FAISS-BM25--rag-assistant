NFL career
Entering the 1994 NFL Draft Foley worked out for almost all the teams in the NFL at the February scouting combine in Indianapolis.

Before the draft, Foley was rated by Miami Herald sports writer Alex Marvez and by Charles Bricker of the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel as the draft’s third-best quarterback behind Heath Shuler and Trent Dilfer. NFL analyst Mel Kiper also rated Foley as the third-best quarterback in the draft, whilst The Californian rated him fourth behind Shuler, Dilfer, and Idaho’s Doug Nussmeier. Jim Thomas of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, however, did not rate Foley among the five best quarterbacks available. Those who had played against Foley in college had doubts about his size, durability, and consistency as a short passer, and Bricker said that Foley would not be chosen before the fourth round.

Foley was ultimately selected in the seventh round of the draft and played sporadically for the Jets from 1994 to 1998. From 1996 to 1998 he threw for 2,013 yards with 10 touchdowns and 14 interceptions during that three-season span. Foley was the Jets' starting quarterback to open the 1998 season, but injuries resulted in Vinny Testaverde taking the starting job.

Foley was traded to the Seattle Seahawks in 1999. He was released in a cost-cutting move during the Seahawks' final cuts before the 2000 season.

Post–playing career
Foley worked at Sports Radio 950 AM in Philadelphia from August 2006 until March 2008 when WPEN joined ESPN Radio.

Foley was also camp director at Valley Forge Military Academy in Wayne, Pennsylvania. In 2010, he served as the Academy's head football coach. In his only season as head coach he led the team to an 8–0 record. After leaving Valley Forge, Foley worked as an instructor for Football University.

Foley's father, Ed Sr., was a quarterback for Boston College from 1963 to 1965. His brother, Ed Jr. is, as of 2021, the Assistant Special Teams Coach of the NFL's Carolina Panthers.
