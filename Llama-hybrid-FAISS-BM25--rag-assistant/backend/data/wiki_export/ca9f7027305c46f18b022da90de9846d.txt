CSX sold the line to the Georgia Eastern Railroad in February 1987. The railroad lasted just over a year before becoming the Georgia Woodlands Railroad on June 7, 1988. Upon its start, traffic included pulpwood, woodchips, plastic, lumber, fertilizer, and others, generating 2,500 annual carloads.

The railroad became part of OmniTRAX in 1992.
