During the first half of the 19th century, several treaties were concluded between the United States of America and the Native American tribe of the Potawatomi. These treaties concerned the cession of lands by the tribe, and were part of a large-scale effort by the United States government to purchase and thereby extinguish their claims in the Northwest Territory and the Southeast, and to remove all such indigenous peoples to lands west of the Mississippi River.
