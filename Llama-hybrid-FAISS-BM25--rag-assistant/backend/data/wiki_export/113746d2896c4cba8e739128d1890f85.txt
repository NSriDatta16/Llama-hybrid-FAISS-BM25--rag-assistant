El Privilegio de Mandar (The Privilege to Rule) is a Mexican political parody broadcast by Televisa on Canal de las Estrellas. It started as a sketch on another Televisa show, called La Parodia, that parodies political, social and cultural events happening in Mexico. High ratings kept the show running.

It was first broadcast on October 25, 2004, during La Parodia. Soon, the high success of the program encouraged the producers to separate it from the other show, so on January 3, 2005, it became an independent show.

Televisa broadcast what is considered the last episode of the series on July 9, 2006, just after the federal elections in Mexico. However, some of the actors who performed leading roles (such as Arath de la Torre, who played the role of presidential candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), Roberto Madrazo) stated that in a few years, when political events have advanced, they will make a return to see how things are.

History
In September 2004, La Parodia was one of the most successful shows on Mexican television. Characters presented here first would later appear on El Privilegio de Mandar, like "Chente" and "Andrés Manuel". The idea of the name "Privilegio" emerged from a skit on the famous Mexican telenovela El Privilegio de Amar (The privilege of loving), so the main title was presented with golden letters and slide images, just like a telenovela. This show was first aired as a section on La Parodia, on Monday October 25, 2004, at 10pm with its first episode, "El Informe". This quickly became such a success that from January 3, 2005, it became a show in its own right, La Parodia now being broadcast on Sundays. In September of the same year, Alter Films released a DVD containing the first ten broadcast episodes of El Privilegio de Mandar.

The show followed closely the world of the Mexican and even foreign politics, from the 2004 videoscandals and the Desafuero judges to the last 2006 Mexican general elections. During its broadcast, the show had several guest artists, like Consuelo Duval (from La Hora Pico and La Familia P.Luche). It won the 2005 TVyNovelas Award for Best Comic Program.

The show made history as the first political parody ever aired in Mexico, where every single political person was parodied. On Saturday July 8, Televisa broadcast a special programme hosted by Mexican entertainer and actor Ernesto Laguardia, in which scenes were presented from the first episodes of the show, interviews with the actors and the people parodied, as well as "behind the scenes" specials.

Televisa broadcast the last episode of what is considered the first season on July 9, 2006, just after the federal elections in Mexico.

From 2004, there have appeared around 50 different characters.  The January 7, 2011 edition of NuestroDetroit.com, however, reported that a second season may soon be in production with Reynaldo Lopez taking over executive producing duties.  The report went on to say that at least four actors—de la Torre, the Ortega brothers, and Vale—will return to the series.

Synopsis
As a parody, it is kind of predictable knowing what will happen the next episode. The only thing the viewer has to do is follow the political news. For example, in 2004, Andrés Manuel López Obrador had problems with the law, confronting a desafuero judge, so in the show all the trouble was parodied for months.

Not all the shows are directly related to real politics, although there is usually some political context. In February 2006, Bailando Por Un Sueño (Dancing for a Dream) was highest rating show on Televisa, El Privilegio de Mandar parodied the show as Bailando Por Un Hueso (Dancing for a Bone) a double meaning because Hueso in this context is an expression for an influence,  the participants were the politicians dancing, with the idea that the winner would get some political position or influence as a result.

On El Privilegio de Mandar, Mexico is parodied as "Colonia el Relaxo con x" ("Relaxo"  means "mess" in Spanish. The real word is "relajo", but the "j" is changed to "x" like the one in "Mexico"), representing the bad organization of the political world in that country. The states are represented as "Manzanas" (blocks), and the president as the president of the neighbors' association. Many of the parodied names and places are word-plays in Spanish, so they wouldn't be understood by many English or other languages speakers.

Parody
The show takes off with Andrés Manuel waiting for the IFE to open the polls at 7am on Sunday July 2, when the polls were actually opened at 8am (as a parody of the early arrive to the polls of the real Andrés Manuel). Then, are shown the Televisa studios where four journalists are waiting for the candidates to vote (they are also rarely presented characters):
Carlos Loharé de MoleDámela Micha'''Joaquín Loque-NósdigaVíctor TrujilloShortly after almost all characters arrive to the polls to present their votes (including characters that weren't presented anymore, like "Bejarano"). After the elections, "Ugalde" (parody to IFE's president) made an announcement on TV, saying that he couldn't give an official winner because two candidates (Felipe and Andrés Manuel) were head to head so it wasn't time to celebrate yet. The scene changes and shows Felipe celebrating with balloons and all the people supporting him:
- (Crowd, cheering) Felipe!, Felipe!, Felipe!
- (Felipe, happy) Friends, that disobedient boy (Disobedient boy is a mariachi song sung by Vicente Fox in a TV show during his campaign) said it!, I'm the next president!. And I'm sorry for Andrés Manuel that must be very sad
The scene changes again, now to Andrés Manuel:
- (Crowd, cheering) Andrés Manuel!, Andrés Manuel!, Andrés Manuel!
- (Andrés Manuel, happy) I am president!. I won for over five hundred thousand votes!
However, the scene changes once more, now to Roberto, in his house sat down and paralysed in front of the TV. Soon the door rings:
- (Roberto, sitting next to Mariano Palacios) The doorbell rings Mariano. Open the door; it could be a vote.

The day now changes to Thursday July 6, when the official counting was finished and declared Felipe winner of the election.
However, Andrés Manuel is very angry, and calls to a demonstration:
- (Andrés Manuel, angry) We have to do a meeting at Saturday 8 at the Zócalo for battling against the polls! (Talking to Jesús Ortega)
- (Jesús Ortega) Why not Sunday 9 morning?
- (Andrés Manuel) No Jesús, is the final match of the World Cup!
- (Jesús Ortega) And why not Sunday 9 night?
- (Andrés Manuel) No, it's the final episode of "El Privilegio de Mandar"

Finally, the scene of the meeting of Andrés Manuel is presented. When he finishes talking, Canti goes up the platform and starts talking about Andres Manuel's decision and the respect of the democracy. The show ends with all the crowd cheering "México!, México!, México!", a screen showing "¿Fin?" (The End?) and all the actors thanking the viewers for their support.

Jokes on this episode
Joaquín Loque-Nósidga, talking about the great coverage of Televisa of the elections by their reporters:
-(Joaquín) We've got a reporter and a camera on every state, on every district, on every poll, on every crayon.
Roberto has voted and now goes up to Mariano Palacios (his consultant):
- (Mariano, proud) Hey Roberto! You know what?, I voted against Felipe! (Roberto's rival)
- (Roberto, curious) And how did you vote against Felipe, Mariano?
- (Mariano, proud) I marked him with a cross! (Note: mark the candidate space with a cross means a vote)
Mario de Tin Marín hadn't respected the line and he was voting. The crowd protests about that selfish act:
- (Mario de Tin Marín, smiling) Calm down, as if you were gods!

Troubles with politicians
Andrés M. López Obrador criticised the show as making fun of him personally and as a strategy of the media to attack him because he felt that the amount of time dedicated to him was excessive in relation to other politicians. However, the show continued to broadcast parodies of him. 
Víctor González Torres also criticized the show as making fun of his way of talking, as he has physical problems.

After 2006 elections, changes to the laws were provided to warn any television propaganda in favor or against a candidate, preventing Televisa to do another season of El Privilegio de Mandar.

Common phrases and jokes

Chente
"No Marthita" (complaining about what his wife says)
He often wears boots, as the real person
Several one-liners used in his campaign and presidential cycle were used to ridicule the President's actions.
Everytime the president says something aggressive to others, Vocero appears from nothing telling "What Chente really means is...")

Felipe Calderón
He is referred to sometimes as "Jelipe", as a common bad pronunciation of the letter F.
He waves his left arm up and down, as the real person. When doing this there was a funny cartoon sound effect.
Jokes with the real political campaign "Manos limpias" (clean hands):
"Since I have to keep my hands clean, a few days ago, I couldn't play Play-Doh with my daughter!
"Since I have to keep my hands clean, the other day, my wife had to replace our SUV's wheel!
"Since I have to keep my hands clean, the other day, I ate a taco with a spoon!

Andrés Manuel
The mispronunciation of the letters C and S, commonly between people from the Mexican Southeast
Parody of the pauses the real person makes while he is speaking
He always has his hair bad bruised so he had some hairs on the backhead lift up. He mentioned this portion of hair as his "Gallito Feliz" and sing a children song about it (Gallo in Mexico is a portion of hair bad bruised... literally translated to "Happy Rooster"). This gag is joking at the point that the real person woke up early the press to give a daily conference press as Mayor of Mexico City, and sometimes he arrived without bruising his hair properly.
Fear from Carlos Salinas de Gortari, he always mentions him as "El Innombrable" (The one must not be named) in a similar way to Harry Potter's Voldemort.In an episode he fights Darth Vader and when he is defeated he reveals to be "El Innombrable" and then Salinas said that Peje is his son.

"Que poca... ¡eso no es cierto!" (Son of a... that's not true!); used several times
"¡Esto es un compló!" (This is a complot!); every time he feels cornered about a situation that everybody is blaming on him even when he was the real cause. The phrase was original from Mexican Big Brother reality show where some participants plotted to nominate another participant. Indeed, when the real person said that he was plotted against in a political ruse to get him expelled from the elections, in the comedy the characters participated in a Big Brother-style reality show and he was the first to be nominated because he broke some of the rules in order to attend his morning conference, at the end he replies "This is a complot!".
"¡Callese, cha-cha-la-ca!" (Shut up you insignificant thing!); Chachalaca is a very small animal, and it was used frequently after the real one said this to the President during his campaign. In the program he used to shut up another characters.

Roberto
Uses the phrase "Amigo" (my friend) anytime he talks to somebody

Home media
In 2005, 10 early episodes from September–November 2004 were released on a double-sided DVD format. This DVD edition is still available in some music stores in Mexico.
These episodes include all the desafuero judge to Bejarano and the videoscandals.

Synopsis
Episode 6: "Derecho de soñar" (Right to dream); is about Bejarano's desafuero judge.
Two police officers ("polecias", as a parody of the ignorance of some police officers in Mexico) are waiting for Bejarano to come out of his house. The frame changes to the room of Bejarano, where he is packing his clothes.
Later, in the desafuero judge, he starts avoiding the judge's questions:
Part of the dialogue:
(Bejarano): "I know, you all have seen the video of me receiving money from Ahumada. The thing that really disappoints me is that, since an original version exists, you've all seen a fake copy. Now, our partner Dolores (referring to his wife) will give you the original videos that you can buy for a low price"
(Judge): "And the cash René?" (In Spanish: ¿Y la lana René?) (lana is a form to say money or cash in Mexico)
(Bejarano): "La Rana René está con los Muppets" (Kermit the Frog is with the Muppets) (Joking of the pronunciation of lana=rana; Rana René is the name of Kermit the Frog in Mexico)
 (Judge, after finishing the judgement): "What does the people say?" (¿Qué es lo que dice el público?)
 (Crowd, furious): "Out!" "Out!" (¡Fuera, fuera!) (this is parody of the TV Show Sabado Gigante)
(Bejarano): "Finally, to wrap things up, no matter where I am, nobody, absolutely nobody will ever take from me my right to dream!"
(Crowd): "Out"! "Out!"
 (The frame changes and Bejarano is trapped in jail, before he wakes up and realizes he was dreaming), after this, other characters also dream, specially Peje where he dreams he's fighting Carlos Salinas dressed as Star Wars'' characters; Salinas, dressed as Darth Vader, rips Peje's "gallito feliz" and then removes his mask to show his identity and revealing to be his father.
