History
The settlement of this region began in 1924 with the discovery of diamonds along the banks of the João Velho River by two prospectors, Cosme and Borges.  Soon many prospectors arrived with their families and a settlement began with the name of "Baliza", the name of a large rock in the middle of the Araguaia River.  In 1930 the town was raised to the category of district in the municipality of Rio Bonito, now called Caiapônia.  In 1936 it became a municipality.  Soon the diamonds ran out and the families emigrated to other regions.  Baliza was almost totally abandoned with its urban population declining to 883 in the 1980 census.
