Heart Attack was an American early New York hardcore band formed in 1980 and active until 1984.

History 

Formed in the suburban area of Whitestone, Queens, in New York City, they were probably the youngest punk band in the New York City area at the time, according to some flyers and fanzines, as the first line-up was formed by people from 12 to 16 years old. Their first demos (Hitler Demo and The Mojo Sessions) was heavily influenced by English punk rock, especially Sex Pistols and The Clash, with hilarious lyrics, but soon after attending a CBGB show of the Bad Brains, singer Jesse Malin and guitarist Jackie Flanagan decided to switch genres to the latest wave of punk, hardcore.

Heart Attack existed for less than four years, part of the NYC hardcore scene with other bands such as the Beastie Boys, Kraut, Bad Brains, The Undead, The Mad, Reagan Youth, The Misguided, and Even Worse. Heart Attack was the first band of the area to go on tour in the rest of the United States. Their final show was on July 4, 1984, at CBGB. All of their songs are now published on "The Last War 1980–84" CD.

Malin went on to form the bands The Finger and D Generation (also with later Heart Attack guitarist Danny Sage), and later, a successful solo career. Flanagan went on to play in the New York group The Mob. Drummer Javier Madriaga later joined Reagan Youth. The band is mentioned in the film American Hardcore.
