Prophets, Seers & Sages: The Angels of the Ages is the second studio album by English psychedelic folk band Tyrannosaurus Rex (later known as T. Rex). It was released on 1 November 1968 by record label Regal Zonophone.

Recording 

Prophets, Seers & Sages was recorded from May to August 1968 at Trident Studios in London, England and was produced by Tony Visconti.

Music 

Prophets, Seers & Sages featured Marc Bolan on vocals and guitar and Steve Peregrin Took on bongos, African drums, kazoo, pixiephone and Chinese gong.

The album opened with a revisiting of Tyrannosaurus Rex's first single "Debora", altered midway by a reversed-tape effect, as indicated by its new title "Deboraarobed". "Eastern Spell" had first been demoed in 1966 yet was passed over for the debut. The brief "Juniper Suction" also featured backwards psychedelic effects and contained oblique references to sex. The closing "Scenescof Dynasty" was a spoken word poem accompanied only by handclaps. Other tracks attempted during the sessions but not on the final album include the outtake "Nickelodeon" and the single "One Inch Rock" (also first demoed in 1966), which became a minor UK hit when it peaked at #28 that August.

Release 

Prophets, Seers & Sages was released on 1 November 1968 by record label Regal Zonophone, but failed to chart in the top 30 upon first release (it bubbled under at #44). It is speculated that its sales were adversely affected by its release coming a mere three months after the debut. 

The album was released in both mono and stereo editions; on the labels, "Oh Harley (the Saltimbanques)" was spelled "O Harley (the Saltimbanques)".

The album was paired with the first Tyrannosaurus Rex album, My People Were Fair and Had Sky in Their Hair... But Now They're Content to Wear Stars on Their Brows (1968), and re-released by Fly Records as a double album on 14 April 1972, following the success of the T. Rex albums Electric Warrior (1971) and The Slider (1972). This re-released edition of the album reached No. 1 in the UK Albums Chart. This double LP set was released in the United States on A&M Records titled Tyrannosaurus Rex: A Beginning, and was the first time the albums were available there.

Reception and legacy 

Initial reviews for the album were nearly as positive as for the debut, with Chris Welch in Melody Maker declaring that duo had "hit upon the simplest and most effective recording sound in history". New Musical Express, however, while complimenting the lyrics, complained that the sound became unmelodic and monotonous over its length. 

In a retrospective review, AllMusic wrote that "the album delivered some of Marc Bolan's most resonant songs". "The already classic pop of the opening "Deboraarobed" is further dignified by its segue into the same performance played backwards, a fairly groundbreaking move at a time when even the Beatles were still burying such experiments deep in the mix". The reviewer concluded saying, "Bolan simply made one up, and in the process created a whole new language -- half nonsense, half mystery, but wholly intoxicating. Tiny Mix Tapes wrote that it was a psychedelic folk album with  "intense bongo action" and "strong backing vocals" . The reviewer added that "Prophets, remains a timeless album for everyone" and its original arrangements ensured it "a long life for many generations to come".

"Debora", the original recording of "Deboraarobed", features in Edgar Wright's 2017 film Baby Driver.
