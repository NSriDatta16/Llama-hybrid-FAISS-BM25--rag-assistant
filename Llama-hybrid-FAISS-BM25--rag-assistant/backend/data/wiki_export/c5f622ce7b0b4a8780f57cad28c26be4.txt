Career

In high school, Barkley was a starter on the AAU team the Riverside Hawks, along with future professional basketball players Lamar Odom, Ron Artest, Elton Brand, and Anthony Glover. In 1996, the team went 66-1 in AAU play. Barkley and Artest would both later star at St. John's together, and led the team to the Elite Eight in the 1999 NCAA Tournament.

During the 2000 NBA draft, Barkley was selected in the first round (28 pick overall) by the Portland Trail Blazers. After two seasons with Portland, he was traded with Steve Kerr and a 2003 second-round pick to the San Antonio Spurs for Antonio Daniels, Amal McCaskill and Charles Smith on August 5, 2002. The Spurs traded Barkley to the Chicago Bulls on October 26, 2002, but he was waived the same day. 

His final NBA game was played on April 17, 2002, in a 92 - 79 win over the Houston Rockets where he recorded 7 points, 3 assists and 2 steals.

When Barkley told team management he was planning to retire due to injuries, he was persuaded to finish out the season as a player-coach.
