TVU Networks Corporation is a privately held technology company based in Mountain View, California.

History (Early Years)

TVUPlayer was the company’s first product. It was a live streaming TV viewer client that provided free live television programming worldwide. It was viewable from a PC or laptop with a broadband connection until its services stopped on February 25, 2013.

The company introduced its first IP-based hardware device on September 11, 2010. The TVUPack TM8000 was a mobile news gathering backpack transmitter that allowed broadcasters to deliver a live broadcast-quality HD signal with latency of two seconds over IP, even with limited bandwidth. The aggregated cellular transmission technology used in TVUPack and other similar devices at the time provided an alternative to traditional satellite trucks, helping to change on-location live reporting for television stations.

The technology used in these backpack style cellular transmitters were often referred to as bonded cellular or aggregated cellular within the broadcast industry. The expression refers to “multiple circuits or connections synchronized to provide a more reliable signal than standard consumer wireless connections.” The advantage of backpack transmitters was the ability for news crews in the field to air first or exclusively.

Rapid releases of upgraded and more technologically advanced versions of the TVUPack transmitter were introduced following the TM8000 including the TM8100 and the TM8200 models within two years. With each new version of the early generation backpack transmitters, the form factor and weight were reduced and more product features were added to the software.

The company also began expanding its IP based product line, including the rollout of TVU Anywhere, a newsgathering live video mobile app for iOS and Android devices, and TVU Grid for cloud based point-to-multipoint live video distribution. Gray Television was the first national station group to deploy TVU Grid at launch.

History (Present Day)

In 2015, the company achieved a breakthrough in size and functionality with the rollout of its TVU One portable transmitter as the eventual successor to the original TVUPacks. The new transmitter was 90% smaller than the first generation cellular packs but without any reduction in performance or features. TVU also entered into a partnership with leading drone manufacturer DJI in the same year in which the two companies collaborated on integrating their products for drone applications.

TVU has shifted its focus in recent years to the development of cloud native applications that address each phase of the broadcast workflow  acquisition, transmission, production, distribution and management. The broadcast industry had been transitioning to IP from transitional SDI with the COVID pandemic accelerating the migration. The need for cloud native and IP products and services in the broadcast industry are a direct result of studios moving away from traditional fixed studio hardware infrastructure to flexible anywhere remote production.
