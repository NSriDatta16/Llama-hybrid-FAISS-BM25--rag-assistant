History

McIntosh High School (named after William McIntosh) was opened on January 18, 1981 to serve the growing community of Peachtree City. Before this, all county residents went to Fayette County High School.

At the time, the building was still under construction, though deemed sufficient to serve the truncated 2nd Semester of the 1981-1982 school year. The following year, the school was finally able to open a full school year on its campus.

More additions came a few years later during the 1985-1986 school semester. The math and science wing was added to the east side of campus.

Some years later the Black Box theater was built next to the construction education classroom during the 1994-1995 school year.

The opening of Starr's Mill High School in 1997 helped alleviate the rapid population growth of Peachtree City.

Shortly before the 2004-2005 school year the automotive education program was dropped and the black box theater was converted into the new band room. A new gym was constructed and the former converted into a new auditorium.
