Texas Tech University Center at Junction is an official off-campus teaching site of Texas Tech University in Junction, Texas. It hosts undergraduate and graduate courses in an intensive three-week period format from May through July. Additionally, an intersession is held in May; this allows students to earn up to three hours of credit between the spring and summer sessions. These courses are taught by Texas Tech University faculty members who either travel to Junction or teach via videoconferencing.

History
The land where the campus is located was given by Kimble County, Texas, to the State of Texas to establish an institution of higher education. In 1951, Texas A&M University opened an adjunct campus at Junction, and for several years, the site was used as a college preparatory and research center. In 1971, the campus was given to Texas Tech University by the Texas Legislature. Since then, Texas Tech has offered intensive academic courses between May and August at the center. Traditionally, the majority of courses have related to field science and art, but many other courses have been taught.

Since 2000, year-round academic programs for the Texas Hill Country have been offered by Texas Tech, using the Center at Junction as a base of operations. University and community-college partnerships were established, and local academic teaching sites were founded in donated or leased space in the Fredericksburg and Marble Falls. These teaching sites host year-round academic programs, with videoconferencing courses often meeting simultaneously at the three sites.

The Junction Boys
While Texas A&M owned and operated the Junction campus, the site was used for summer training of the Aggie football team under coach Paul "Bear" Bryant. The Junction campus is still known to the Aggies and to college football fans in general as the site of the famous 1954 10-day camp that produced the so-called "Junction Boys", including the core of their 1956 undefeated team. Over 100 players began the camp, but only 27 to 35 finished it having survived blistering heat and highly demanding training with no water breaks.

The camp was subsequently commemorated in a novel by Jim Dent and a film by ESPN starring Tom Berenger as Bryant. Among the Junction Boys were College Football Hall of Fame coach Jack Pardee and Gene "Bebes" Stallings, who went on both to coach the Aggies and then to coach Alabama to its first national championship since Bryant's retirement and death.
