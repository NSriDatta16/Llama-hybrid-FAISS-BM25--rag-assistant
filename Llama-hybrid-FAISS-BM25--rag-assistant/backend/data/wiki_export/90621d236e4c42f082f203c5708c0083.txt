Previous availability

Although a new collection, much of Atomic Chilis content had been previously available in some form. The Dead in the West adaptation by Neal Barrett, Jr. and Jack "Jaxon" Jackson had been published by Dark Horse Comics as a two-issue mini-series in 1991. "By Bizarre Hands", "Night They Missed the Horror Show", and "Tight Little Stitches" were also previously published by Dark Horse as the 3-issue By Bizarre Hands mini-series (1994).

Three stories had been previously published in collections from Mojo Press: "Trains Not Taken" was included in Wild West Show by Richard Klaw (ed.) (1996); "Steel Valentine" appeared in Weird Business by Joe R. Lansdale and Richard Klaw (ed.s)) (1995); and "The Grease Trap" had seen print in Mojo's debut title, Creature Features''', by Richard Klaw (ed.) (1994).

"Pilots" and "The Job" originated in this collection.Note that "The Grease Trap" was never printed as a text story and was originally published as a comic book story. Contents
