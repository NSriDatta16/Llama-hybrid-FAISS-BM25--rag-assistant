Kentucky's 3rd congressional district is a congressional district in the U.S. state of Kentucky.  It encompasses almost all of Louisville Metro, which, since the merger of 2003, is consolidated with Jefferson County, though other incorporated cities exist within the county, such as Shively and St. Matthews. The far eastern portions of Louisville Metro are part of the 2nd congressional district.

The district is currently represented by Democrat Morgan McGarvey. With a Cook Partisan Voting Index rating of D+9, it is the only Democratic district in Kentucky.

Characteristics
The district's character is very different from the rest of Kentucky. It is entirely contained within Jefferson County, and in contrast to the rest of the state, it is urban and leans Democratic. It has the highest percentage of African Americans in the state, who are concentrated in and near Louisville. It is a cosmopolitan, diverse district, with major businesses, health care organizations and universities.

Until January 1, 2006, Kentucky did not track party affiliation for registered voters who were neither Democratic nor Republican. The Kentucky voter registration card does not explicitly list anything other than Democratic Party, Republican Party, or Other, with the "Other" option having a blank line and no instructions on how to register as something else.
