Cumberland County College was a public community college in Vineland and Millville in Cumberland County, New Jersey. It became the Cumberland Campus of Rowan College of South Jersey (RCSJâ€“Cumberland) on July 1, 2019, as part of a merger with Rowan College at Gloucester County. The historic merger is the first of its kind in New Jersey.

History 
Founded in 1966, Cumberland County College was the first community college in the state to open its own campus. The State of New Jersey, in 1962, passed the New Jersey County College Act, after which the Cumberland County Board of Chosen Freeholders authorized the founding of a community college. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on December 10, 1965. The original campus, which cost $2.7 million to construct, consisted of three buildings. Today, the 90-acre RCSJ Cumberland Campus consists of 12 buildings, including: Phillip Alampi Science Center, Frank Guaracini Jr. Fine and Performing Arts Center, George P. Luciano Family Center for Public Service and Leadership, Shirlee and Bernard Brown University Center, and Paul Navone Healthcare Education Center. On October 17, 1966, the college opened its doors to offer nine associate degree programs to approximately 350 enrolled students. The college's first class of graduates, in 1968, numbered 151. The Class of 2017, the largest in Cumberland County College's history, numbered 758.

University Center 
In May 2006, Bernard Brown and his wife Shirlee donated $1 million to establish an endowment to assist with the operating costs of a facility that would enable students to earn a bachelor's or master's degree on Cumberland County College's campus. The $6 million Shirlee and Bernard Brown University Center opened in February 2008. The modern 17,423-square-foot facility features 12 classrooms, study areas and offices.
The University Center marked its 10th anniversary in 2018 by hosting an inaugural Distinguished Alumni Induction ceremony.
