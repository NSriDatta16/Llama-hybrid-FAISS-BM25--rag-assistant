Maryland Route 454 (MD 454) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland.  Known for most of its length as Crown Stone Road, the state highway runs  from the Delaware state line in Marydel, where the highway continues east as Delaware Route 8 (DE 8), north to MD 302 in Templeville.  MD 454 was built in the late 1910s.  The state highway originally ended in Marydel at MD 311, which crossed the state line.  MD 454 replaced MD 311 along the stretch to the state line around 1946 and bypassed Marydel by 1956.

Route description

MD 454 begins at the Delaware state line in the town of Marydel in Caroline County, adjacent to a five-mile (8 km) Masonâ€“Dixon marker that gives the highway its name.  The highway continues east as DE 8 (Halltown Road) toward Dover.  The state highway, known as Halltown Road, heads northwest as a two-lane undivided road. The route immediately encounters the eastern end of MD 821 (Main Street) and crosses an unused railroad grade owned by the Maryland Department of Transportation.  MD 454 meets the northern terminus of MD 311 (Halltown Road), where the name changes to Crown Stone Road, before leaving Marydel and collecting the other end of MD 821.  The state highway turns north through farmland before entering the town of Templeville and terminating at MD 302 (Barclay Road), which forms the border between Caroline County and Queen Anne's County.

History
MD 454 was paved as a state-aid road from Marydel to Templeville between 1915 and 1921.  The state highway originally had its southern terminus in Marydel at MD 311.  It was MD 311 that continued to the state line until 1946.  MD 454 was moved off of Main Street and onto a new alignment through Marydel by 1956.
