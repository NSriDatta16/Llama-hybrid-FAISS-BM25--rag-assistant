The United States competed at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, Italy. It was the first Summer Olympics in which the athletes marched under the present 50-star flag. 292 competitors, 241 men and 51 women, took part in 147 events in 17 sports.
The 1960 Summer Olympics was the first Olympics in history that was being covered by a television provider.  American network CBS became the first official broadcaster of the games, by purchasing the rights to cover the Rome Olympics.
The 1960 Summer Olympics also brought one of the first appearances of one of the greatest heavyweight boxers ever, Muhammad Ali. Since these Olympic Games occurred before his conversion to Islam, he fought under the name Cassius Clay.
