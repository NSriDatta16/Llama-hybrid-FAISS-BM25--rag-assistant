Here at the Mayflower is the nineteenth studio album by Barry Manilow released in 2001. It was Manilow's first to include all original material since 2:00 AM Paradise Cafe in 1984. His next album of original songs, 15 Minutes, would not be released until 2011. The album concept (designed by album cover designer Dennis Purcell) is based on the Brooklyn, New York, apartment complex Manilow grew up in. There were different covers for the US and UK versions.

It was also his first album with new label Concord Records. Manilow left Arista Records after a span of over 20 years there (with the exception of two years at the RCA label between 1985-1986).

Two singles, "Turn the Radio Up" and "They Dance!", reached the top 30 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart.

On the UK version of this album, American Idol vocal coach Debra Byrd, Manilow's longtime backup singer, makes an uncredited appearance on "Say Goodbye" and "I Don't Wanna Know". Also only on this release, "She Should'a Been Mine" and "The Night That Tito Played" features dialogue by Manilow.
