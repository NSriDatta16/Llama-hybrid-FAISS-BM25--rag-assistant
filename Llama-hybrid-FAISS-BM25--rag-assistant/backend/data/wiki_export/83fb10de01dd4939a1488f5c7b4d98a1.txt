Trinoc*coN was an annual science fiction convention which was held in North Carolina. It started in 2000. Guests of honor included George R.R. Martin. 2006 was the first year that the convention was held outside of Durham; it was held in the Northern Raleigh Hilton in Raleigh, North Carolina. The name "Trinoc*coN" is a reference to the Trinocs, a fictional alien race from the works of Larry Niven. It ceased operation in 2009.
