Wonderful is the fourth studio album by the American hardcore punk band Circle Jerks, released in 1985.

Critical reception

The Daily Breeze wrote that the album "has the speed and energy that belies [Keith] Morris' disinterest in the punk scene, and the record showcases the band's outrageous sense of humor." The Los Angeles Times noted that "the new rhythm team of bassist Zander Schloss and drummer Keith Clark lends tight support to the slower, more heavy metal-ish tunes."

In an AllMusic review, Alex Ogg wrote: "The Circle Jerks were always a limited band that happened to cover the basics exceptionally well. However, Wonderful is the worst example of the treadmill approach to hard rock/punk that engulfed them in the mid-'80s. Greg Hetson and Keith Morris were trying out yet another rhythm section (Keith Clark and journeyman Zander Schloss), but the real fault lies in their gutless, inconclusive self-production and lackluster songwriting. Dodge this and opt for either their earlier or later work. The one saving grace is the cover artwork by Gary Leonardâ€”featuring your heroes resplendent in tuxedos and cheesy smiles."
