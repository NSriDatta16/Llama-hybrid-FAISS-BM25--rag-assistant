Got You on My Mind is a jazz album by William Galison and Madeleine Peyroux, recorded in 1999, and later compiled into an album by Galison alone in 2003.  Seven of its eleven tracks are by the two collaborators, the remainder are by Galison alone.

The album is made up of a wide variety of material, ranging from jazz standards like Jerome Kern and Dorothy Fields' "The Way You Look Tonight" to pop songs like John Lennon's "Jealous Guy"; and containing two originals by Galison and one by Galison and Peyroux.  The instrumentation is also varied, with Galison himself playing six different instruments.  Some of the songs are early demo recordings of songs Peyroux later released on Careless Love.

Controversy
Tha album has a controversy-ridden history. In late 2005 it became known that Peyroux and her record label had been sued for $1 million by her former boyfriend and musical collaborator Galison, who asserted he had produced and co-created Got You on My Mind.

According to Galison, in 2003 Peyroux told him she was negotiating a deal with Rounder Records for the album that became Careless Love. Rounder Records did not want the recording Peyroux was making with him to be in stores when the Rounder album came out. Peyroux's contract prohibited her from selling the seven tracks she made with Galison except at live performances. When Galison tried to market the record with another label, both Rounder Records and Peyroux's lawyers threatened to sue him and his distributor for copyright infringement. After Galison's potential distributors dropped him, Galison sued Peyroux and her lawyers for libel and tortious interference.

Galison also sued Rounder Records, but later dropped their name from the suit. Rounder Records commented that Galison may be using the legal dispute as an "ill-advised attempt ... to trade on the name and reputation of Ms Peyroux to boost his career by passing off an inferior version of a Madeleine Peyroux album." They also asserted that they had obtained "directly and from Ms Peyroux, evidence of numerous incidents of physically and verbally abusive behaviour by Mr Galison against Ms Peyroux"; Galison denied the abuse allegations and characterized them as libellous.
