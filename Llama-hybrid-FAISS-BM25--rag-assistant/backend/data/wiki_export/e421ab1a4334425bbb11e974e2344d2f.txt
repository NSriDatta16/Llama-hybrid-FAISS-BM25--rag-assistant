On 1 October 1850, the line was extended southwards to , where it connected with an existing line into Liverpool from Preston and from Bury. Among the intermediate stations on the extension was one at Seaforth,  from the new southern terminus at  (later Liverpool Exchange). The LCSR was absorbed by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway at the start of 1855. Seaforth station was renamed Seaforth and Litherland in July 1905. The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway amalgamated with the London and North Western Railway on 1 January 1922 and in turn was Grouped into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway at the start of 1923. Nationalisation followed in 1948 and in 1978 the station became part of the Merseyrail network's Northern Line (operated by British Rail until privatised in 1995).

The station also provided a service from 2 July 1905 to Dingle in south Liverpool (and all intermediate stations running parallel with the Liverpool dock system) via Liverpool on the Liverpool Overhead Railway until 30 December 1956, when the LOR was closed and later demolished. The station underwent improvement work in 2009.
