 Traverse the Jervvassbreen glacier and climb from there
 Climb all the peaks from Store Skagastølstind (Norway's third highest peak at ) across to the summit—the so-called Styggedal traverse.  It is a multi-day trek across Store Skagastølstind, Vetle Skagastølstind (18th-highest peak at ), Sentraltind (13th-highest peak at ), the eastern and then western summits of Styggedalstind, and then descending from Jervvasstind (12th-highest peak at )—bagging 6 of Norway's 20 tallest peaks in one trip.
