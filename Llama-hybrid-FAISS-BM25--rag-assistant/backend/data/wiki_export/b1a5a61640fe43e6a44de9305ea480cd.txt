"What If" is a song performed by English actress Kate Winslet, recorded for the animated film Christmas Carol: The Movie (2001). Winslet provided the voice of Belle in the feature, which is based on the Charles Dickens classic 1843 novel and also stars Nicolas Cage, Jane Horrocks and Simon Callow. "What If" was written by Wayne Hector and Steve Mac, while production was helmed by the latter. The song is a ballad that follows the film's theme, as Belle laments the end of her and Scrooge's relationship and wonders what could have been. It was the only song to be released from the official movie soundtrack.

News that Winslet was secretly recording the one-off single to vie for the 2001 UK Christmas number one spot was reported in the Daily Mirror. In the event, the song entered the UK Singles Chart at number six, its peak. Elsewhere, "What If" was released to even bigger success; it became a number-one hit in Austria, Flanders, and Ireland whilst also reaching the top ten in Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. Critically acclaimed, the song won the 2002 OGAE Song Contest. At Winslet's request, the proceeds from the single were given to the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and Sargent Cancer Care for Children.

Critical reception
Can't Stop the Pop described "What If" as a "ballad of epic proportions", and a "huge, soaring Disney-esque ballad". Barbara Ellen from The Observer said it is "a sweet, trilling, sub-Celine little ditty." British trade paper Music Week wrote that Winslet could sing the track well but noted that her divorce from Jim Threapleton would make the lyrics less "poignant".

Music video
An accompanying music video, which was directed by Paul Donnellon and produced by Chris Horton, shows Winslet walking around an old Victorian house, haunted by the ghost of a girl, along with clips from the film.
