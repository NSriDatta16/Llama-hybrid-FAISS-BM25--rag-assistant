The NAM News Network (NNN) is a news agency established by countries of the Non-Aligned Movement to disseminate news which are not prejudicial to the third-world countries.

Organisation and operations
It was established at the initiative of Malaysia, but in concurrence with the decision taken by the Sixth Conference of Ministers of Information of Non-Aligned Countries (COMINAC VI) hosted in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in November 2005. The agency was created after the earlier network, Non-Aligned News Agencies Pool (NANAP), fell into disuse in the mid-1990s.

NAM News Network's stated mission is to promote information and news from a developing country perspective and to be "a valuable alternative for the Western news dominance", essentially revitalizing Non-Aligned Movement's original intention with NANAP but now equipped with the technology of Internet. It was also set up as a working platform and central hub for accredited news organizations within NAM countries to publish and reuse content.

According to the agency's website, "the NNN sees itself as an alternative source of information rather than being in competition with other major news services. Essentially it would serve as a conduit for NAM member countries to tell their story and use it as a yet another tool of communication for them."

Secretariat
The agency's secretariat is located in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The national news agency Bernama serves as NNN's coordinating body.
