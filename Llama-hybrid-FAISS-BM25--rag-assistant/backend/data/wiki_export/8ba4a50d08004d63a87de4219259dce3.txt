Incarnate is a compilation album by American doom metal band The Obsessed. It consists of tracks taken from a number of rare and unreleased sources, namely their Sodden Jackal and Altamont Nation 7"s, the Hellhound Records What the Hell! compilation, and some unreleased demos. There are also two cover songs -- "On the Hunt" (originally by Lynyrd Skynyrd) and "Inside-Looking Out" (originally by The Animals and later covered by Grand Funk Railroad). The track "Streetside" is a video clip.

The album was re-released on double vinyl, digipak CD and digital by Blues Funeral Recordings on October 23, 2020, as part of Record Store Day.
