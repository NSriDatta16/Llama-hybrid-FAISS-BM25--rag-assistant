The Columbus Quest was a professional women's basketball franchise located in Columbus, Ohio in the now-defunct American Basketball League (ABL).  They were one of the league's original eight teams that started play in 1996.  In the league's brief history, the Quest was its most successful franchise, winning both championships the league awarded.

The Quest's head coach was Brian Agler, who finished with a record of 82–22 during the team's two-plus seasons of existence. After Agler left the Quest midseason to become the head coach of the WNBA's Minnesota Lynx, the team was coached by player-coach Tonya Edwards
.  Many of the Quest's players later played for the Lynx, including Edwards, Katie Smith, Andrea Lloyd-Curry, Angie Potthoff and Shanele Stires.

The Quest played their home games at the Greater Columbus Convention Center in Battelle Hall. Despite being the league's most successful team, they had the league's lowest average attendance for all three years of the ABL's existence.
