Turners Falls Airport , also referred to as Turners Falls Municipal Airport, is a town owned, public use airport located three nautical miles (6 km) north of the central business district of Montague, a town in Franklin County, Massachusetts, United States. It is owned by the Town of Montague. It is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015, which categorized it as a general aviation facility.

History 
Although started by a private group, the airport was the site of a large Civilian Conservation Corps camp during the Great Depression. Workers lived in tents on the grounds and labored by day. Built in 1940 by the Works Progress Administration, the airport was used by the U.S. Navy for basic aviation training in World War II; students, including famous Boston Red Sox players turned aviators Ted Williams and Johnny Pesky, trained there.  The field was expanded after the war and eventually gained the name Turners Falls Municipal Airport.  

Turners Falls Airport was mentioned by name by President Joe Biden in a 2022 speech highlighting his $1.2 trillion dollar infrastructure bill.

Airport 

The airport complex is situated in a valley between a small mountain and the Barton's Cove oxbow of the Connecticut River.  A dispute with Native Americans over alleged burial grounds once threatened to shut down the airport but an accord has been reached on the matter.

The Airport Industrial Park includes high-tech manufacturers and biotech companies.  Private jet traffic has increased due to local corporations and students at the Five Colleges, Williams College, Northfield Mount Hermon School (NMH), Deerfield Academy and Eaglebrook School.
