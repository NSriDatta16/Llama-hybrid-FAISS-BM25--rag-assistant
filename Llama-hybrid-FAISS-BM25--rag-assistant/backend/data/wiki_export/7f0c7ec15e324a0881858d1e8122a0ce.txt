Importance

Binnaguri lies close to the Bhutan border, the Bhutanese town of Samchi being 10 km to the north. Binnaguri lies in deep Dooars country. Tea gardens are nearby, prominent amongst which are the Binaguri Tea Estate (Binaguri Tea Co. Pvt. Ltd. Kolkata), Moraghat Tea Estate (Binaguri Tea Co. Pvt. Ltd. Kolkata), Telepara Tea Garden, Huldibari Tea Garden, Banarhat Tea Garden, Karbala Tea Garden, Lakhipara Tea Garden, and Gandrapara Tea Garden. The decline in the tea industry has increased the poverty and unemployment in the neighbouring areas. Most of the employment opportunities apart from the tea gardens are in the Army Cantonment, an orphanage and a local chapter of the Dooars Branch Indian Tea Association.

The town is considered the education hub of the region, with institutions like St. James' School, Binnaguri, Army Public School, Binnaguri, Kendriya Vidyalaya, St. Patrick's School and NIOS/IGNOU.
