Kirchlindach is a municipality in the Bern-Mittelland administrative district in the canton of Bern in Switzerland.

History
The name Lindenacho (for Kirchlindach) first appeared in writing on 2 October 1185, when Pope Lucius III affirmed legal possession of the area to Erlach in a papal bull.

A number of Hallstatt grave mounds, a La Tène period grave with jewelry and a stone bowl all indicate prehistoric settlements in the area. During the Roman era there was a Roman estate near Muri-Alchenmatte between Oberlindach and Buchsacker. During the Middle Ages the most important land owner was the Lords of Bremgarten. In 1185, they granted some of their land in Kirchlindach to St. Johannsen Abbey in Erlach. By 1300, the Lords of Bremgarten lost the remainder of their lands and wealthy families in Bern became the main land owners. The low court was usually administered by Bern through the court of Herrenschwanden while the high court for Kirchlindach was held in the district capital of Zollikofen.

Kirchlindach was home to several large country estates that were built by Bernese patricians. In the 12th or 13th century the stone late-Romanesque country estate of Heimenhaus was built in the village. In the 18th century Werdt Matthey bought the old estate and remodeled and expanded it. Nüchtern estate was built at the beginning of the 18th century. In 1891 it became a health resort and in the late 20th century, a social therapy center. Sacker estate was built in 1727 and is now a farm house.

The village church of St. George was built around 1200 and was first mentioned in 1275. It was built above a couple of earlier, high medieval churches including an 8th-century wooden building and a stone building from the 9th or 10th century. The building was renovated and rebuilt several times during its history. The tower was rebuilt in the 13th century, followed by the chancel in the 14th century. In 1766 the main hall of the church was renovated. The 14th- and 15th-century wall paintings were restored in 1907 and the entire building was renovated in 1978–79.

During the Middle Ages, Kirchlindach, Niederlindach, Oberlindach, Jetzikofen, Heimenhaus and Herrenschwanden were all farming villages. Beginning in the 18th century, the local farms switched from growing grain for local consumption to producing hay, milk, vegetables and fruit for the weekly market in Bern. The village was located on the Bern-Aarberg highway after 1467, when the Neubrücke (New Bridge) was built over the Aare river. Starting in the 1950s, the population grew in the villages surrounding Bern. However, in Kirchlindach, the old village centers remained mostly intact and new construction happened in detached settlements. In Herrenschwanden several pioneering large housing developments were built between 1957 and the 1970s. These "Holistic Building" designs featured integrated offices, studios and gardens in a compact mixed residential and commercial development. The first project was Halen (built 1957–61) above the Halen bridge. This was followed in the 1970s by the Hostalen, Thalmatt (I-II) and Möslimatt projects. The area around Halen is both a Swiss heritage site of national significance and on the Inventory of Swiss Heritage Sites. Between 1950 and 1980, the population doubled, as commuters moved into the municipality. Despite jobs in agriculture and light industry, the majority of workers in Kirchlindach now commute to Bern for work.
