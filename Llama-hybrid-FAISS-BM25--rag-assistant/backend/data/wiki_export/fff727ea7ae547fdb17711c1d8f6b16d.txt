History
In May 2011, site preparation began for construction of the $300 million project. The building consists of six below-grade stories used for lab space, parking, and mechanical systems, as well as eight above-grade stories. The design of the Science and Engineering Hall combines flexible, reconfigurable spaces within common areas on each floor to promote collaborative thinking and to integrate lectures and laboratories with hands-on projects. Other key features of the building include: a vibration and particulate-free nanotechnology facility, a three-story high-bay including a strong wall and floor with easy access to a street level loading dock, and a multi-use auditorium and media center for science and engineering symposia and conferences.

The building was designed by architecture firm Ballinger and conceptualized to meet the growing research needs of engineering disciplines. After four years of construction, which included demolishing the campus' largest parking deck, the building was completed in November 2014.

Since January 2015, the School of Engineering and Applied Science has occupied the Science and Engineering Hall on George Washington University's main campus in Foggy Bottom. Previously, the engineering school was housed in Tompkins Hall. Tompkins Hall is still used as office space for faculty as well as the computing facility.

The Science and Engineering Hall is the largest academic building dedicated to these fields in Washington, D.C. The facility is 500,000 square feet and eight floors tall. It houses 140 faculty members and classrooms used by four schools: the School of Engineering and Applied Science, Columbian College of Arts & Sciences, the School of Medicine and Health Sciences, and the Milken Institute School of Public Health. The building is designed with sustainability in mind.
