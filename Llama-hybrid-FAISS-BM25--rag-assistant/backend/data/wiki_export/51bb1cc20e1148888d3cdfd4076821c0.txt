Andrew Noel Griffiths (born 3 September 1961) is an Australian children's and comedy writer. He was educated at Yarra Valley Grammar School. He is most notable for his Just! series, which was adapted into an animated television series called What's with Andy?, his novel The Day My Bum Went Psycho, which was also adapted into a television series, and the Treehouse series, which has been adapted into several stage plays. Previously a vocalist with alternative rock bands Gothic Farmyard and Ivory Coast, in 1992 he turned to writing. He is well known for working with Terry Denton.

Early life
An event cited by Griffiths as instrumental in developing his literary style was when, as a child, he read the 1845 German children's book Struwwelpeter, which featured children being maimed and killed as a consequence for bad behaviour.

Career

Literary style
Griffiths places an emphasis on toilet and gross out humour in his books, and aims to balance levels of what he deems "anarchy" and "nice" within his series; he notes that his Just! series was more anarchic while his Treehouse series was more nice.

Personal life
Griffiths is noted as a supporter of children against what he views as "cotton wool" childhoods, and, along with Denton, was a noted supporter of the September 2019 climate strikes.
