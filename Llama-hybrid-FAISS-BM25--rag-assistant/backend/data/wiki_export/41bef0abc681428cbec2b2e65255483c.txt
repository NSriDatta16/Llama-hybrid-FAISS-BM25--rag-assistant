History
Prior to the 1920s, Juniata Park was mostly farmland. Nicetown Lane ran generally west to east from near the line of B St. and Erie Avenue through to the present-day Pike Street and Frankford Avenue. Powder Mill Lane ran from the present-day Wingohocking Street in Frankford southwest to Nicetown Lane, near the intersection of L and Lycoming Sts. I Street, from Ramona Avenue west, was called Fisher's Lane and ran generally through the west side of the Tacony Creek to the intersection of Harrowgate Lane, near the present day H Street and Ramona Avenue. Harrowgate Lane ran generally south and southeast into Harrowgate to the present day Atlantic Street, ending at Frankford Avenue.

The first row homes were built in Juniata Park, near Castor Avenue and Luzerne Street, in the mid-1920s. The western area of Juniata, around I and Cayuga Sts., was developed in the 1950s.

Facilities and infrastructure
The Marketâ€“Frankford Line elevated train stops in the neighborhood at the Erie-Torresdale Station, located at the intersection of Erie, and Torresdale Avenues.

The Juniata News, the neighborhood's weekly community newspaper, was first published in July 1934.

Most of the neighborhood's retail and commercial establishments are situated along Castor, Hunting Park, and Erie Avenues.

In 1935, the Carl Mackley Houses (now Apartments) were constructed on the block bounded by Castor Avenue, Bristol, M, and Cayuga Streets.
