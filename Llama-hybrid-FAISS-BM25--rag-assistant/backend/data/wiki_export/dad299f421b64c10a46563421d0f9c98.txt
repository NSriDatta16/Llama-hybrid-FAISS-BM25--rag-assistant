Make Way for Noddy (stylized make way for NODDY) is a computer-animated musical children's television series that was produced by British animation studio Chorion in conjunction with American animation studio SD Entertainment. Based on Enid Blyton's Noddy character, it was originally broadcast on Channel 5 (later known as Five; in twelve minute segments and as part of the Milkshake! programme) in September 2002. It features music and songs composed by Steven Bernstein and Julie Bernstein, with the musical direction done by Sharon Sampson and Terry Sampson.

Premise
The series changed its format in some ways from previous incarnations of Noddy to take advantage of the CGI medium and to appeal to more contemporary audiences, such as Noddy now also being able to fly a plane as part of his taxi duties and making Master Tubby Bear a more believable character. However it largely stuck to what the franchise established prior-hand. In addition to the franchise's characters, Make Way for Noddy also introduced actual children voicing the younger characters of the series.

Characters
Noddy (voiced by Martin Skews in the UK and David A. Kaye/Alberto Ghisi in the US) is the protagonist of the series. Noddy is an imaginative wooden boy who lives in Toyland. Although Noddy is characterised as a child, he also serves as the main taxi driver. He sometimes begins nodding uncontrollably, such as after sneezing, and has to physically stop himself from nodding.
Tessie Bear (voiced by Joanna Ruiz in the UK and Britt McKillip in the US) is a neutral and child-like female teddy bear who is Noddy's best friend, always ready to try something new and help everyone she sees.
Big Ears (voiced by Pavel Douglas in the UK and Michael Dobson in the US) is a gnome who serves as a father figure to Noddy and the other toys with astute knowledge and a fine sense-of-humour.
Dinah Doll (voiced by Andrea Harris in the UK and Tabitha St. Germain in the US) is a Toy Town shopkeeper and a big sibling support figure to Noddy.
Mr. Plod (voiced by Richard Newman in the UK and in the US and Pavel Douglas in the UK and in the US specials and the video game (excluding Noddy and the Magic Moondust) and part of the UK and the US episodes) is Toyland's sole police officer who is persistent for maintaining a certain order but means well and whose catchphrase is "Halt/Stop, in the name of Plod!"
Bumpy Dog (voiced by Ben Small in the UK and Lee Tockar in the US) is Tessie Bear's extremely playful but loyal and sensitive dog.
Gobbo and Sly (voiced by Ben Small in the UK and Don Brown and Doug Parker in the US) are two goblins who serve as the series' antagonists. Gobbo is the more conniving and intelligent one while Sly is the more airheaded and curious of the two members.
Mr. Sparks (voiced by Ben Small in the UK and Lee Tockar in the US) is Toyland's street-smart mechanic.
Miss Pink Cat (voiced by Tabitha St. Germain in the UK and in the US and Carrie Mullan in the specials and the video game) is the pessimistic and sophisticated owner of Toy Town's ice cream shop. She speaks with a French accent.
Master Tubby Bear (voiced by Carrie Mullan in the UK and Manny Petruzzelli in the US) is a young teddy bear whose role was changed from a tricky mummy's boy (in previous incarnations) to a moody but lovable anti-idol kid in this series, though this was clearly done as it lent more to having him involved in stories, this time in noticeable contrast as a boy hero to Noddy.
Martha Monkey (voiced by Joanna Ruiz in the UK and Kathleen Barr in the US) is a stuffed monkey with an energetic but bossy tomboy personality.
Mr. Jumbo (voiced by Ben Small in the UK and Ian James Corlett in the US) is a mild-mannered stuffed elephant.
Clockwork Mouse (voiced by Joanna Ruiz in the UK and Kathleen Barr in the US) is a perky wind-up toy mouse who isn't sometimes feeling dwarfed by the other inhabitants of Toyland for his size.
Mr. Wobblyman (voiced by Ben Small in the UK and Ian James Corlett in the US) is a roly-poly toy who is always diligent about doing the right thing.
Clockwork Clown (voiced by Ben Small in the UK and Ian James Corlett in the US) is a toy clown.
The Skittles (voiced by Joanna Ruiz, Carrie Johnston and Ben Small in the UK and Teryl Rothery and Chantal Strand in the US) are a family of orderly bowling pins.
Harvey and Cecilia (voiced by Ben Small) and Cecilia (voiced by Joanna Ruiz) are two beetles.
