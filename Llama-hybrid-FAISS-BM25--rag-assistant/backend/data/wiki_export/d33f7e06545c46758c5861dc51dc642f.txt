Juan José "Johnny" Canales (born 1947 in General Treviño, Nuevo León, Mexico) is a Mexican retired  Tejano singer and former host of the television show "The Johnny Canales Show". Canales is credited with one of the first live performances of vocalist Selena by her 13th birthday. He took Selena y Los Dinos for their first concerts in Mexico. As a radio DJ in 1974, Canales gave Ruben Naranjo considerable airplay.

The original show

Johnny Canales was the executive producer for The Johnny Canales Show which debuted in 1983. His program showcased emerging bands from Mexico and the United States. Some of his guests included La Sombra de Chicago, Selena, Nancy, La Mafia, Mazz, Intocable, Grupo Pegasso De Emilio Reyna, Fama, Jaime y Los Chamacos, Jennifer Peña, Los Tigres del Norte and Los Relámpagos del Norte and many more. It aired on Televisa in Mexico and Univision in the United States from 1988 until 1996.

In 1996, Canales made the transition to the Telemundo Network. On November 12, 1997, Canales was interviewed for the UTA Center for Mexican American Studies Oral History Project. In 2002, Johnny Canales reached an agreement to bring his show back to Televisa and arranged to start touring again, doing shows in the Southwest part of the United States and Mexico. The show also aired on TuVision from August 2008 to November 2009.

Cancellation and Telemundo Lawsuit

Telemundo canceled the show in 2005, prompting Canales to file a lawsuit against the network.

At the time of the lawsuit, Canales was seeking $100 million. The suit has since been dropped.
