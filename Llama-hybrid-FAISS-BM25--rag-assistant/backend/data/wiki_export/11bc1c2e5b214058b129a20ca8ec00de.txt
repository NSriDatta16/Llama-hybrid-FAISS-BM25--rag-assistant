History
Founded in June 1981 by secular Israelis from the Beitar and Herut movements, Barkan  is part of a chain of settlements built along the Trans-Samaria Highway, and adjacent to the Barkan Industrial Park. The park, established in 1982, has  120 businesses and factories manufacturing plastics, metal-work, food, textile, and more. Of the 5,000 workers, 90% are Palestinian Arabs.

According to ARIJ, Israel confiscated land from two Palestinian villages in order to construct Barkan: 167 dunams from Qarawat Bani Hassan, and 353 dunams from Sarta.

"Barkan" is called after the Hebrew name of the Syrian thistle. The original name of the town was Beit Abba after Abba Ahimeir, a leader of the Lehi.
