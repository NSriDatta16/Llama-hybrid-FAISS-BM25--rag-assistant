History
Into the early 1970s, students from Delran Township and Delanco Township attended Riverside High School as part of sending/receiving relationships with the Riverside School District. Efforts to merge the three districts into a combined regional K-12 system were rejected in a November 1971 referendum, leading the Delran district to pursue efforts to create its own high school. The Delran sending relationship began in 1954. Delran High School, constructed at a cost of $6 million (equivalent to $ million in ), opened for the 1975-76 school year.
