Looney Tunes: Space Race is a 2000 kart-racing video game published by Infogrames for the Dreamcast and developed through Infogrames' own Melbourne House studio. A version of Nintendo 64 was developed, but it was never released. It was ported to PlayStation 2 in 2002 (under the name "Space Race") with a new tournament mode and different soundtrack.

Reception 

The Dreamcast version received "favorable" reviews, while the PlayStation 2 version received "mixed" reviews, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Evan Shamoon of NextGen said of the former console version, "Despite one frustrating design decision, this is a beautifully presented and eminently likable gameâ€”and easily the best kart racer on Dreamcast."
