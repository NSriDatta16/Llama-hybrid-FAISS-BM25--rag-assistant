Myrciaria is a genus of large shrubs and small trees described as a genus in 1856. It is native to 
Central and South America, Mexico, and the West Indies, with many of the species endemic to Brazil.  Common names include hivapuru, sabar√°, and ybapuru.

The jaboticabas are a significant commercial fruit in Brazil.  The fruit is grapelike in size and appearance, and often likened to a muscadine grape in taste. Myrciaria dubia, the camu-camu berry, is grown primarily in flood-zone areas of Peru and has one of the highest vitamin C (ascorbic acid) concentrations of any fruit, alongside Terminalia ferdinandiana.
