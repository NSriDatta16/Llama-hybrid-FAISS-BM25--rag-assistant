"Blaze of Glory" is the debut solo single of American singer-songwriter Jon Bon Jovi. It reached  1 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and Album Rock Tracks charts in 1990, becoming his only chart-topper away from his band Bon Jovi. "Blaze of Glory" also topped the Australian, Canadian, and New Zealand singles charts and reached No. 13 on the UK Singles Chart.

Background
The power ballad was allegedly recorded by Jon Bon Jovi because Emilio Estevez requested Bon Jovi's song "Wanted Dead or Alive" for the soundtrack to Young Guns II, but Bon Jovi did not think the lyrics—about the band constantly touring—fit the theme of the Western movie. However, the request inspired him to write "Blaze of Glory" with lyrics more topical to the film.

The song features a music video and remains a crowd favorite with Bon Jovi fans, despite the fact that the song was not released as one of the band's singles, and only by Jon. The track is notable for the performance of Jeff Beck on guitar. The music video was filmed at The Rectory near Moab, Utah.
