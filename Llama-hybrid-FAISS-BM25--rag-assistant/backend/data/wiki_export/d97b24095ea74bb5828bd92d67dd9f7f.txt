The coast
L’Ametlla de Mar's coastline is 16 km long and is made up of 30 bays and beaches. Some of the beaches have fine, white sand whilst others are pebbly. They are surrounded by pine trees and have crystal-clear water due to the abundance of Posidonia found here. L’Ametlla de Mar, which has been awarded 5 blue flags for its beaches and one for the Marina, is the second municipality in Catalonia to have been awarded so many flags. Nudists can go to the "Torrent del Pi" bay and those who like going to the beach with their pets can go to the "Bon Caponet" bay. Some of the beaches are accessible to people with disabilities.
