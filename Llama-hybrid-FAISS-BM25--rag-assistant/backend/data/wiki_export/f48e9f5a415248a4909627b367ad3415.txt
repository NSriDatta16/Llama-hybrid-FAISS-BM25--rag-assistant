Swanwick railway station is a railway station in Fareham, Hampshire, England. Despite its name, it is actually located in Park Gate, one mile south of Swanwick.

The station opened on 2 September 1889, and was specially built for the local strawberry industry.  For a short time each year, it was one of the busiest stations in the country.  The station is near a small industrial estate between the residential areas of Locks Heath and Whiteley.

History 
The railway line between  and  was built by the London and South Western Railway; it was authorised on 20 August 1883, construction began in April 1886, and the line was opened on 2 September 1889. Swanwick was one of two intermediate stations originally provided, but unlike its neighbour , it was provided with a crossing loop so that two trains could pass each other on the single-track route.
The local area's strawberry industry  provided up to 7,000 tons each year in the late 1800s.  During the harvest, Swanwick Station became one of the busiest in the country with "Strawberry Specials" heading to Covent Garden and across the country.  Long platforms were constructed to accommodate the trains.

After the Second World War, the station was mainly used for passenger services.
