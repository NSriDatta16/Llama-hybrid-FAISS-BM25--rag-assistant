Niagara Falls Convention and Civic Center was a 10,000-seat multi-purpose arena and convention center in Niagara Falls, New York from 1973 to 2002.

Planning and construction
The venue was built in 1973 as part of an urban renewal project in the city of Niagara Falls. It was built in the center of a main thoroughfare, Falls Street, and blocked traffic to Niagara Falls State Park. It also eliminated Jefferson Avenue and Erie Avenue, two main thoroughfares.

The building was designed by Johnson/Burgee Architects in collaboration with Jane Davis Doggett. Its arched design was inspired by the rainbows commonly seen over Niagara Falls, according to architect Philip Johnson. Locals jokingly noted its resemblance to a Quonset hut.
