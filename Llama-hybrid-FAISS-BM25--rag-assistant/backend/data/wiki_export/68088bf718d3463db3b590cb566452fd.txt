Mascot
Name: EFE

Efes are the leaders and heroes of societies that lived in Western Anatolia during the early 1990s. The village dandy Efe, guards and defends all the members of his society and also deals with much of their social work and events as if he is the father of all. For this reason, all the members of the society behave respectfully towards him with strong, emotional, family ties. The Efes were legends in these areas with their smart, fearless, alert dashing behaviors as brave and manly young fellows. They became the symbols of bravery, power and justice throughout the Aegean history.

Nowadays, the word “Efe” is the explanation of a virtuous, brave man who is the symbol of justice in every case. Therefore, we call successful athletes “Efe” stating their various qualifications in one brief word.
