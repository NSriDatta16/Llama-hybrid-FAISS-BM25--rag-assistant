Ngozumpa Spillway lake 

The Nepali Himalayas have been warming significantly over recent decades. Ngozumpa glacier is showing signs of shrinking and thinning, producing melt water. Some of this water pools on the surface where an enormous lake is growing. This lake, called Spillway, has the potential to be about  long,  wide and  deep. In the future this might be a threat to the Sherpa villages down the valley.
