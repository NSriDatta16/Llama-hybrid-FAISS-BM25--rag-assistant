Long Point Provincial Park is a provincial park on the northwest shore of Lake Erie near Port Rowan, Ontario, Canada. The park is part of a sandy spit of land called Long Point that juts out into the lake. It covers part of the area of Long Point Biosphere Reserve, which was designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve because of its biological significance.

Summary
Long Point Provincial Park is famous for its migrating birds during spring and fall, and attracts thousands of birdwatchers. There have been 383 different species recorded on Long Point. Many different types of turtles and snakes are a common sight during the summer season. The park is within the most significant part of the core range of the Fowler's toad (Anaxyrus fowleri).

The other section is the "new park", which contains Firefly, Monarch's Rest  and Turtle Dunes Campgrounds as well as a boat launch and many good views of the marshes and Long Point Bay. It is larger and more spread than the old park and about a kilometre further down Long Point.
