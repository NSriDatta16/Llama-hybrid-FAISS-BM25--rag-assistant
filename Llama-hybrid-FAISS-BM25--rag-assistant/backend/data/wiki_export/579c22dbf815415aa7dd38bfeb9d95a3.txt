Dønnes is a former municipality in the Helgeland traditional region in Nordland county, Norway. The  municipality existed from 1888 until its dissolution in 1962. The former municipality encompassed the northern part of the island of Dønna, the western parts of the islands of Tomma and Løkta, and over 300 smaller surrounding islands, islets, and skerries.

Dønnes Church was probably built here at the request of Paul Vågaskalm who was governor of Alstahaug. It was built on the site of an older church sometime between 1200 and 1300. The characteristic onion dome was added in 1866. The church organ, built by Paul Christian Brantzeg, was installed in 1866.

History
Dønnes was established as a municipality on 1 July 1888 when the western part of the old Nesna Municipality was separated to form a new municipality. Initially, Dønnes had a population of 1,348.
