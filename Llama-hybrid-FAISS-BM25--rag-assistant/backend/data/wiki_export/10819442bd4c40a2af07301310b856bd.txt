"Say Goodbye" is a song recorded by American singer Chris Brown. Released on August 8, 2006, from his self-titled debut album, the song is also featured in the movie Step Up. It became Brown's third top-ten single on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number ten on October 31, 2006, and the second single of his career to top the R&B charts. The track was released as a single in the UK and US. It was his first single to not chart at all in the UK.

Composition
The song is written in the key of B minor in common time with a tempo of 115 beats per minute.  Brown's vocals span from D4 to C6 in the song.

Music video
The song's music video (directed by Jessy Terrero) was released July 26, 2006. It features a short clip of the track "Ain't No Way (You Won't Love Me)" at the beginning of the music video. It follows Brown trying to end his relationship with his girlfriend but at the same time, cannot find a way to explain himself to her. While doing dance rehearsals, his new love interest appears and this causes friction between Brown and his girlfriend. The current girlfriend begins to cry as she catches Brown and his new love interest almost kiss. When the dance performance begins, Brown’s girlfriend and new love interest almost get involved in a physical altercation but Brown appears just in time to stop them. When Brown’s girlfriend tries to stay by his side, he pushes her away. Once Brown does this, we then see Brown finally dumping his girlfriend for the new love interest. She then walks offstage, clearly disappointed and heartbroken over seeing Brown choose his new woman over her.

Critical reception
While reviewing Step Up OST, Heather Phares of Allmusic called this song "wistful" and noted that it gets the film's romantic angle across without interrupting the flow of the more danceable tracks.
