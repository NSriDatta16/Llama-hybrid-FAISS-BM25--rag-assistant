Boston College (1994)
Herren turned down offers from the University of Kentucky and Duke University to play at Boston College. Entering Boston College, Herren was featured in Sports Illustrated, hyping his possible success. Before playing, Herren failed a drug test for marijuana and cocaine use. On November 25, 1994, in his first game for Boston College, Herren scored 14 points in 21 minutes of playing time, but broke his wrist and was ruled out for the entire 1994–1995 season. Within three months of his injury, Herren failed two more drug tests for marijuana and cocaine use, and was subsequently expelled from the team and the university.

Fresno State (1995–1999)
After being kicked out of Boston College, Herren transferred to Fresno State to play basketball under coach Jerry Tarkanian. Here he was hailed as much as at BC, featured in Rolling Stone magazine. After sitting out a year, per NCAA transfer rules, Herren first made news in the Fresno Bee for his involvement in a disturbance at a local bar.

Herren impressed everyone at practice, and when  Herren made his debut, as a sophomore, on December 10, 1996, for the Bulldogs. he averaged 31 points per game over his last four games and finished the season averaging 17.5 ppg.

Herren finished the season strong, willing Fresno State into the National Invitation Tournament by leading the Bulldogs past Hawaii. Herren led the squad into Madison Square Garden but the Bulldogs fell short. In a later press conference Herren announced his plan to stay at Fresno State another year.
