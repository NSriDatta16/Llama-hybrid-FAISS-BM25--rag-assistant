History
Vienna Christian School was founded in 1986 by missionaries coming to Vienna to witness to those in the then-Soviet Union. At that time, VCS was focused directly on educating the missionary community. In 1991, when the borders opened, most of the missionary community moved on into the Eastern Bloc countries. Due to the lack of attendance, VCS opened its doors to the international community. When VCS was founded, the school campus was in the Heiligenstadt vicinity, but in 2001, the school moved to its current location in Donaustadt. In 2010, Vienna Christian School changed its name to the International Christian School of Vienna to embrace the international community. ICSV's 25th anniversary was in 2012. In 2015, ICSV became an IB World School, offering the Diploma Programme to 11th and 12th graders.
