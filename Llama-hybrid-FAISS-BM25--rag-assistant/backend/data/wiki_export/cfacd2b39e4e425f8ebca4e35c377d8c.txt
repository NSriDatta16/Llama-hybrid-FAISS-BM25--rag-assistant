Paruyr Sevak (; January 24, 1924 – June 17, 1971) was an Armenian poet, translator and literary critic. He is considered one of the greatest Armenian poets of the 20th century.

Biography
Sevak was born Paruyr Ghazaryan () in Chanakhchi (now Zangakatun) village, Armenian SSR, Soviet Union to Rafael Soghomonyan and Anahit Soghomonyan on January 24, 1924. Young Paruyr attended the village school. Sevak spent the part of his childhood and adolescence in a location called Navchalu yayla (near Zangakatun) and in his early writings, he signed his writings with ‘Navchalu’ as the location where they were written. Later in 1940 moved to Yerevan to study at the philological faculty of Yerevan State University. He graduated in 1945. The same year he started his postgraduate studies of Armenian literature at the Academy of Sciences Abeghyan Institute of Literature, which lasted until 1948.  In 1951 Sevak went to Moscow to study at the Gorky Institute of World Literature. After graduation, he worked there as professor of translation in 1957-59.

Paruyr Ghazaryan adopted the name Paruyr Sevak as his pen name after Western Armenian poet Ruben Sevak.

In 1960 Sevak returned to Yerevan and resumed his prolific and meaningful literary, scientific and public career. He started to work at the Abeghyan Institute of Literature as a scientific researcher. From 1966-1971 Sevak served as secretary on the Board of the Writers Union of Armenia.

In 1967 Sevak became a doctor of philology after his dissertation defense. In 1968 he was elected to the Supreme Council of the Armenian SSR.

Sevak died on June 17, 1971, in a car crash while on a drive back to Yerevan. In previous years, he had voiced his criticism of the corruption of the Soviet establishment and for this, many Armenians believe, he was murdered by the Soviet government. His wife, Nelly Menagharishvili, also died in the car crash. He was buried in the backyard of his home, in Zangakatun, which later became a museum open to everyone.

Literary work
Sevak's poem The Unsilenceable Belfry is dedicated to Armenian composer Komitas Vardapet and to the remembrance of the Armenian genocide.
