He was named the NFL Player of the Year by the Washington D.C. Touchdown Club after the 1955 season.  Brito played in the Canadian Football League for the Calgary Stampeders in 1954 where he was an All-conference selection in the CFL's Western Conference.

Brito was elected posthumously to the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame in 1989.  He hosted "The Gene Brito Show" which aired prior to Redskins games in the 1950s making him one of the first NFL athletes to host a show and making him the most popular Redskins of his era.  He was then-President John F. Kennedy's favorite player. Brito died on June 8, 1965, of ALS at the age of 39. During an August 1971 visit to the Hall of Fame Game in Canton, Ohio, President Richard Nixon, who had been friendly with Kennedy during their congressional years, told sportscaster Frank Gifford that he considered Brito a candidate for enshrinement at the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
