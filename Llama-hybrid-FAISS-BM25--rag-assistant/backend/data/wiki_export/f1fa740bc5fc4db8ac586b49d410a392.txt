All I Can Do is the seventeenth solo studio album by American singer-songwriter Dolly Parton. It was released on August 16, 1976, by RCA Victor. The album was co-produced by Parton and Porter Wagoner and would be the last of Parton's solo albums to have any involvement from Wagoner. It was nominated for Best Country Vocal Performance, Female at the 19th Annual Grammy Awards. The album spawned three singles: "Hey, Lucky Lady", "All I Can Do", and "Shattered Image".

The album was reissued for the first time in March 2007. It was released on CD with Parton's 1977 album New Harvest...First Gathering and was also released as a digital download.

Content
In addition to eight Parton compositions, the album includes two covers: Emmylou Harris' "Boulder to Birmingham" and Merle Haggard's "Life's Like Poetry". The album was released around the time Parton began appearing regularly in the tabloids, and "Shattered Image", which advised to "stay out of my closet if your own's full of trash," was said to be a reaction to that. "The Fire That Keeps You Warm" was previously recorded by Parton and Porter Wagoner on their 1974 album Porter 'n' Dolly.

Parton would re-record "Shattered Image" for her 2002 album Halos & Horns.

"Falling Out of Love with Me" was covered by country-rock band Pinmonkey in 2002 with Parton providing harmony vocals.

Critical reception

In a review published in the August 28, 1976 issue, Billboard said, "Exceptional LP by the enigmatic lady who has reached the pinnacle of country music success and is now making her impact, deservingly, on the pop music market. Few artists write better songs than Parton, and no one can sing them better. A powerful performer, Parton provides an album for country and pop chart consideration. Her version of Emmylou Harris' "Boulder to Birmingham" is a striking, heartfelt song, sung without pretension and with a surplus of feeling. Effective blend of slow ballads and uptempo numbers, contains a pair of her hit singles and a couple more that should make good singles. Incisve liner notes by Don Cusic add depth to an already noteworthy LP."

Cashbox published a review in the August 28, 1976 issue which said, "Making a positive move into the progressive sound, Dolly makes her current single the theme of the total offering. Other self-penned selections are "The Fire That Keeps You Warm", "When the Sun Goes Down Tomorrow", "I'm a Drifter," "Falling Out of Love with Me", "Shattered Image", "Preacher Tom" and "Hey, Lucky Lady". Also included are "Life’s Like Poetry" (Merle Haggard) and "Boulder to Birmingham" (Emmylou Harris/Bill Danoff). A Dolly Parton/Porter Wagoner production."
