South Western Railway (SWR) operates a regular service between Salisbury and Southampton Central via Romsey. This runs hourly during the week, with a two-hourly service on Sundays, and uses two-car Class 158 units. As a result of the introduction of the SWR service, the number of Great Western Railway (GWR) trains between Portsmouth Harbour and Cardiff that stop at Dean was reduced. Since October 2011, there have been no GWR trains stopping at Dean, and from April 2020 the management of the station was transferred from GWR to SWR.
