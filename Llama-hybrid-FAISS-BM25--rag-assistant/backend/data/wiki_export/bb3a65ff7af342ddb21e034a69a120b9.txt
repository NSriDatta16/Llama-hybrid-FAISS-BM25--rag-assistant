Monte Gordo Natural Park

The Monte Gordo Natural Park (Portuguese: Parque Natural de Monte Gordo)) has been created to protect the typical humid mountain ecosystem.

Some of the higher parts of the site are forested, especially around Monte Gordo where relatively high rainfall and frequent misty conditions cause the trees to be thickly covered with lichens.

The dominant vegetation in the park is forests of Pinus, Eucalyptus and Cupressus species. Endemic plant species include Euphorbia tuckeyana, Nauplius smithii, Echium stenosiphon, Sonchus daltonii, Aeonium gorgoneum and Campanula jacobaea.
