Early life and education
Wicks grew up in the western suburbs of Sydney. He studied for a Bachelor of Arts in Asian and Australian History at Macquarie University and worked at a variety of unskilled and semi-skilled jobs while living in Sydney and London.

In the late 1970s, he established Meuse publications (with Bill Farrow) which mixed text and graphics. He helped set up the Poets Union in NSW. From the 1980s, he worked as a union industrial advocate for several unions after obtaining qualifications in Industrial Law from the University of Sydney.
