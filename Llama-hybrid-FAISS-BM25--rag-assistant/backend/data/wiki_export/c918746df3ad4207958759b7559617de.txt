History 

Kingswood station originally opened in 1897 as Kingswood and Burgh Heath. It was the original terminus of the single-track Tattenham Corner Line before it was extended to Tadworth & Walton-on-the-Hill in 1900 (now Tadworth) and Tattenham Corner a year later.

An open air terrace was once provided on top of the station's platform canopy for afternoon tea. However, this only lasted until 1920 as the steam and soot from the trains beneath rendered it unprofitable.
