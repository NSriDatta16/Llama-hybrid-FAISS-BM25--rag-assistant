The Czech Cup (), officially known as the MOL Cup for sponsorship reasons, is the major men's football cup competition in the Czech Republic. It is organised by the Czech Football Association.

The Czech Cup was first held in 1961. The winner would then face the winner of the Slovak Cup in the Czechoslovak Cup final. This competition was discontinued in 1993, after the dissolution of Czechoslovakia into two independent states (Czech Republic and Slovakia).

The winner gains entry to the following season's UEFA Europa League.
