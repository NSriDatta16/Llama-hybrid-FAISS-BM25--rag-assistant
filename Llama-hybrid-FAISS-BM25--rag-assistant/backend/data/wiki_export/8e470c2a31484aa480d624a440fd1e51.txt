Vernon (; ) is a commune in the French department of Eure, administrative region of Normandy, northern France.

It lies on the banks of the river Seine, about midway between Paris and Rouen. Vernon–Giverny station has rail connections to Rouen and Paris. The town is known for its production of engines by the SNECMA group.

History

Mentioned in a Latin written document as Vernum, the /m/ at the end could be the last remains of the Celtic magus 'plain' or 'market', or it is a simple latinization, and the origin is just the Celtic word *uerno, alder tree (Breton gwern, Welsh gwern, Irish fern, modern French verne).

The village gave its name to a family who took part in the Norman Conquest of England, and then became a British first name.

The village is home to Établissement Saint-Adjutor, a notable private school.
