Walter William Ristow (April 20, 1908 in La Crosse, Wisconsin – April 3, 2006 in Mitchellville, Maryland) was the head librarian of the map library at the New York Public Library and later the Library of Congress. Ristow graduated with a degree in geography from the University of Wisconsin in 1931. He went on to earn a master's degree in geography from Oberlin College and a doctorate from Clark University. Ristow joined the Library of Congress in 1946 and became chief of its map department in 1967. He retired in 1978.

In 1979, Ristow helped establish the Washington Map Society. The Society gives an award in his name annually to an author of "a paper in the field of cartographic history or map librarianship."
