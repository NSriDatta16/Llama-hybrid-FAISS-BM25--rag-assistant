History 
In 1944, after the genocide and deportation of the Chechen and Ingush people and the Chechen-Ingush ASSR was abolished, the village of Alleroy was renamed to Shuragat, and settled by people from the neighboring republic of Dagestan. From 1944 to 1957, it was the administrative center of the Shuragatsky District of the Dagestan ASSR.

In 1958, after the Vaynakh people returned and the Chechen-Ingush ASSR was restored, the village regained its old Chechen name, Alleroy.

Post-war insurgency in Chechnya 
On January 28–29, 2004, a force of Akhmad Kadyrov's Security Service and police carried out a mass cleansing operation in Alleroy, which is also the birthplace of rebel president Aslan Maskhadov. Two days later Sultan Dadayev, who led the operation, and four of his men were shot dead in Aleroy by pro-Maskhadov fighters.

On May 1, 2004, Alleroy was invaded by fighters from the Akhmed Avdarkhanov group. The combatants went to the home of the Abuyev family, whose son Suleiman worked for Kadyrov Security Service. Suleiman was not at home and the fighters kidnapped Yusup Abuyev, Abukar Abuyev, and Isa Ousmayev. The hostages' relatives were told the men were kidnapped in retaliation for the murder of Ruslan Dalkhanov, who had been kidnapped from his house by Kadyrov's Security Service under command of Suleiman Abuyev and tortured to death. On November 9, 2004, a grave was discovered in the proximity of Aleroy, which contained the bodies of the three men, kidnapped by the Chechen fighters on May 1.

On July 12, 2004, guerrillas entered Avtury. The fighters first blocked all entrances to the village and then in the videotaped attack seized the buildings of the security forces, inflicting heavy casualties and capturing twelve members of pro-Moscow Chechen militia. A small relief force composed of a carload of paramilitaries was ambushed and destroyed, according to villagers.
