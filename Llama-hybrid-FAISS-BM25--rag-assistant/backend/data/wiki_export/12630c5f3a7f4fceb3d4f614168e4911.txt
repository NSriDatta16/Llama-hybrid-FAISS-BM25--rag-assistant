History
On February 13, 1999, CZW debuted their version of a tag team championship, which they named the CZW World Tag Team Championship at the company's Opening Night event. Jon Dahmer and Jose Rivera, Jr. were awarded the championship at the said event, becoming the inaugural champions in the process.  Although the title is a world tag team championship, supposedly only intended for tag teams, a wrestler has held the championship by himself â€“ Justice Pain. Pain held the championship during his entire reign alone, from November 20, 1999 to January 8, 2000, when he lost it to The Thrill Kill Kult (Diablos Macabre and Midknight); the same team he defeated to win the championship.
