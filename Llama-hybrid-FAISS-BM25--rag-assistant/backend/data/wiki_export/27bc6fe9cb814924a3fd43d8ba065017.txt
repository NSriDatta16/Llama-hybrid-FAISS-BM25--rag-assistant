Vgo, or Ugo, for "Hugues", was a stonemason active in Provence during the twelfth century. He left his signature on several Romanesque religious edifices in Provence and mainly in Tricastin:

 Vaison Cathedral
 Notre Dame d'Aubune
 St Blaise de Bauzon
 St Sepulchre Chapel in Beaumont
 Crypt of Apt Cathedral

He is not to be confused with Master Hugo, an English artist of the same century.
