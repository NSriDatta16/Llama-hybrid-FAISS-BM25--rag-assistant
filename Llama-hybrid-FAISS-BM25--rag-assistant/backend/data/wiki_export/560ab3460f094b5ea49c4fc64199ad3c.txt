Poot! was an adult British comics magazine which ran between 1985 and 1990. It had the tagline "silly cartoons and smart-arse satire for grown ups". The first edition was published in 1985 with a run of 500 copies. The comic grew to around 50,000 per issue up until the time of its cessation in 1990, due to the publishers getting proper jobs and the distributor going bust. Publication resumed in September 2009 after a gap of 19 years for a further two years until the new distributor went bust as well. Poot! billed itself as "Probably Britain's silliest comic".
