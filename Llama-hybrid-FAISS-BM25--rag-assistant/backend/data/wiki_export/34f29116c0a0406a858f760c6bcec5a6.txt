History
WENJ first signed on February 2, 1962, as WMVB-FM, an FM sister station to WMVB (1440), airing an easy listening format; through the 1970s, the station began to evolve to an adult contemporary format. In 1988 the station changed their call letters to WBSS-FM, for its branding as "The Boss 97 FM", and become a CHR station. In 1995, WBSS was sold to the owners of WKXW (101.5), which switched the station to a simulcast of WKXW's news/talk and oldies format, with a small amount of local news.

On March 15, 2002, WBSS dropped the simulcast of WKXW in favor of a modern adult contemporary format, with a call change to WIXM (referring to the station's branding of "Mix 97.3") following a few weeks later.

In November 2004, in the wake of sister station WSJO debuting a hot adult contemporary format, WIXM reverted to the WKXW simulcast; two years later, the station was renamed to WXKW.

In May 2009, WKXW began to remove references to having a simulcast partner for South Jersey from its promotions, indicating a planned format change for WXKW; on June 1, the station switched to ESPN Radio as WENJ-FM. The sports format had previously been heard in the market on WENJ, which switched to ESPN Deportes Radio after a brief period of simulcasting. The station simulcast again on that station from January 2, 2011, to October 15, 2012.

On October 31, 2012, the station dropped the -FM suffix.
