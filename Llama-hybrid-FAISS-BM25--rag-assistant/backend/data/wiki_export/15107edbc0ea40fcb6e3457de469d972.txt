Books

 Duende: A journey in search of Flamenco (2003), which recounts Webster's move to Spain after university and his quest to learn flamenco guitar and the path to the elusive yet passionate feeling of duende, an untranslatable term referring to the feeling that is the essence of flamenco. It was long-listed for the Guardian First Book Award and read on BBC Radio 4's Book of the Week.

 Andalus: Unlocking the secrets of Moorish Spain (2004, Doubleday, ) examines the deep impact left on Spain – and by extension the rest of Europe – by the Moorish presence and was adapted as a radio play by the BBC.
 Guerra: Living in the shadows of the Spanish Civil War (2006, Black Swan, ), studied the wounds left by the civil war on contemporary Spain through a combination of history and travel. A Spanish edition, Las heridas abiertas de la guerra civil, was published in 2008 with a prologue by Paul Preston of the London School of Economics
 Sacred Sierra: A year on a Spanish mountain (2009, Chatto & Windus, ) describes a year that Webster and his Spanish wife spent living on their mountain farm in eastern Spain, on the slopes of the sacred peak of Penyagolosa, working on the land and planting trees with the help of a 12th-century Moorish gardening manual. It paints a portrait of a little-known part of the country, with details of its folklore, history and customs, and with meditations on stories, the need to preserve them and their importance for communities. Webster made a short promotional film for the book in conjunction with the award-winning Swedish film director David Flamholc of Caravan Film.
