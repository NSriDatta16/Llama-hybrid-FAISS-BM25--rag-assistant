The Senate (, ) was the upper house of Parliament in Mauritania from April 1992 to August 2017. The Senate had 56 members, 53 members elected indirectly for a six-year term by municipal councillors with one third renewed every two years and 3 members elected by Mauritanians abroad.

The Senate was an attempt to guarantee a minimum level of representation to every part of Mauritania, irrespective of population. The Senate had especially budgetary, financial and oversight powers.

In 2017, the Senate was abolished as a result of a constitutional referendum; the last election was held in 2007.
