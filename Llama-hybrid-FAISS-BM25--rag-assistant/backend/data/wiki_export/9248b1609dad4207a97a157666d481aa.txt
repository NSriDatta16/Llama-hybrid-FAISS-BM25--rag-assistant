Born in Barrow-in-Furness, Lancashire and trained at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, he worked extensively for the Royal Exchange in Manchester.

In the 2000s, Perry's work included performances at the Mill at Sonning. In the summer of 2008, he played Mr. Mole in Love's a Luxury. He was also a director of NOT The National Theatre and toured with them, appearing in several productions.
