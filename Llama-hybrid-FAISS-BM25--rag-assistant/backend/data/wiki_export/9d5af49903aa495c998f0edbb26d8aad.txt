Christopher Lee Yost (; born February 21, 1973) is an American film, television, animation, and comic book writer best known for his work for Marvel Studios' Marvel Cinematic Universe with Thor: The Dark World (2013) and Thor: Ragnarok (2017) and on The Mandalorian for Lucasfilm and Disney+.

Career
Yost graduated from the University of Michigan in 1995 with a film and video degree and got into advertising in the Detroit area, producing TV commercials. He went on to earn an MFA in film from The Peter Stark Producing Program at the University of Southern California and later interned, in 2002, in Marvel Comics' west coast office. His spec film scripts got attention from Marvel executives who hired Yost to write episodes of the TV series X-Men: Evolution.

Yost has also written for animated shows such as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, The Batman and was the story editor and head writer on the Fantastic Four animated series that aired on Cartoon Network in 2006 as well as Iron Man: Armored Adventures. He was the head writer of Marvel Animation's The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes, which aired on Disney XD from 2010 to 2012, and has worked on Lucasfilm's Star Wars: Rebels on Disney XD.

Yost worked in the Marvel Feature Film Writers Program from 2010 to 2012 before embarking on his feature film screenwriting career. He was one of the writers of Marvel's feature film Thor: The Dark World (2013), and then wrote Mattel's film Max Steel, before returning to Marvel to work on Thor: Ragnarok.

On June 6, 2017, it was announced that Yost would write an American live-action adaptation of Cowboy Bebop for television with Tomorrow Studios, a partnership between Marty Adelstein and Sunrise Inc., which also produced the original anime. Additionally, he worked on The Mandalorian for Lucasfilm and Disney+. In July 2023, it was announced that Yost and Alan Wan would serve as showrunners and executive producers on Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles for Paramount+.
