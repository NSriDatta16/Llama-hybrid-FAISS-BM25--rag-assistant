Nova Scotia is the third album by Cousteau, released in 2005 on the Endeavour record label. It was subsequently released in the U.S. under the band name 'Moreau' due to legal reasons on the One Little Indian label with two additional tracks (*). The US release also featured new artwork.

Davey Ray Moor had previously left the band leaving the main song writing duties to be taken over by lead singer Liam McKahey. "We thought it was the end and we were all feeling really emotional," says McKahey of Moor's departure. "But after a few pints, we'd decided to carry on and do it (the songwriting) ourselves. It was sink or swim, and we decided to swim."
