In sewing and crafts, an embellishment is anything that adds design interest to the piece.

Embellishments allow individuals to express their personal style and identity. Clothing can be a form of self-expression, and the choice of embellishments can communicate one's personality, taste, and cultural background.

 buttons can be placed anywhere on the piece
 zippers can be unzipped and be used as piping, or simply stitched on
 buckles can be placed anywhere on the piece
 grommets can be placed anywhere even when there is no cord is looped through them
