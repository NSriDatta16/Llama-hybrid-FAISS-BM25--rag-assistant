P.A. (short for Parental Advisory) was a Southern hip hop trio, part of the Atlanta-based Dungeon Family. The group composed of rappers/producers James "Mello" Hollins, Kawan "K.P." Prather and Maurice "Big Reese" Sinclair. In 1993, they released their debut studio album, Ghetto Street Funk. In 1998, they released their second full-length titled Straight No Chase via DreamWorks Records. The single "Like We Do" became a southern anthem while the group's second single, "Reservations" secured a spot on the Blade (soundtrack) earning the group a Gold Record for the soundtrack. My Life, Your Entertainment was the group's third album overall and their second record distributed by DreamWorks as well. The single "Sundown" featuring 8Ball filled the southeastern airwaves while BET played the video in heavy rotation.
