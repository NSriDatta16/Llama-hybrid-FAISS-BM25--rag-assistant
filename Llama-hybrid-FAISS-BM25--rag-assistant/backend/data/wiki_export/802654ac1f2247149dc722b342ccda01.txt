Homai railway station is on the Southern Line of the Auckland railway network in New Zealand. It has an island platform layout. A bus stop and a park and ride facility are located adjacent to the station.

History

The North Island Main Trunk Line through South Auckland opened in 1875. However, Homai Station didn't open until 15 August 1924, after local farmers John Dreadon, Alexander and Masters lobbied Prime Minister William Massey. In line with other stations opened in Auckland suburbs at the time, it was partly financed by local developers. In the case of Homai, John Dreadon donated £500 and land for the station and the bridge, which replaced a level crossing. Three other landowners also contributed. As a result, it was decided to name the station using the Māori word for 'gift', homai, rather than Browns Rd, as it was initially referred to.

Daily boardings were measured as 338 in 2003. This figure had jumped to 936 by 2010. The station was upgraded in 2006 with a modern shelter, platform lighting and a much longer platform installed.
