Description
The station has two staggered platforms, there is a level crossing on Victoria Road, hence the staggered platforms to minimise delay to road traffic, and Carlton's centre is a considerable distance further away than Netherfield's, but the nearby Netherfield railway station on the neighbouring Nottingham-Skegness line had already taken that name.

Service
There is generally an hourly service from Carlton, with trains running westbound to  via Nottingham and eastbound to  with a few continuing to Lincoln at peak times and in the evening. There is a reduced service on Sundays.

The station has a PlusBus scheme where train and bus tickets can be bought together for a cheaper price. It is in the same area as Beeston, Bulwell, Netherfield and Nottingham stations.
