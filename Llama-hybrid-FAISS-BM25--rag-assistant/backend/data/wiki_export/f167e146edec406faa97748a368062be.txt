The Syracuse Stars were a minor professional ice hockey team from Syracuse, New York, for ten seasons from 1930–31 to 1939–40. The Stars name had previously been used by sports teams, including several Syracuse Stars baseball teams from the 19th century. The team played at the New York State Fair Coliseum on the New York State Fairgrounds. The Stars were affiliated with the Toronto Maple Leafs and the New York Americans.

History
In 1930, the Hamilton Tigers International Hockey League (IHL) franchise was purchased by Percy LeSueur and partners and transferred to Syracuse to become the Syracuse Stars. LeSueur also managed the Syracuse Arena and coached the Stars team for part of the first season before giving way to Frank Foyston. The Stars hockey team played their first six seasons in the IHL from 1930 to 1936, and then in the International-American Hockey League from 1936 to 1940. The Stars were an affiliate of the Toronto Maple Leafs for the 1932–33 season and then from 1934 until 1939. The Stars had a one-season affiliation with the New York Americans in 1933–34.

The first five seasons for the Stars did not produce any championships. However, they won the IHL's regular season East Division in 1935–36 during their sixth season.

During the 1936–37 season in the IAHL, Syracuse won the F. G. "Teddy" Oke Trophy as West Division champions, and became the first ever Calder Cup champions after beating the Philadelphia Ramblers in the finals. The Stars reached the Calder Cup finals the following season, losing to the Providence Reds.

After four seasons in the IAHL, the team was acquired in 1940 by Louis Jacobs, owner of Jacob's Concessions, and relocated to Buffalo, New York to play as the Buffalo Bisons, where they played in the newly built Buffalo Memorial Auditorium. They played in Buffalo until 1970 when the National Hockey League expanded to Buffalo and created the Buffalo Sabres.

AHL in Syracuse
Other AHL teams such as the Syracuse Warriors, Syracuse Eagles and Syracuse Firebirds would call Syracuse home after the Stars. The city has been home to the AHL's Syracuse Crunch since 1994. A banner memorializing the Stars inaugural AHL Calder Cup championship hung in the rafters of the Upstate Medical University Arena until 2018. The Syracuse Crunch wore replica Stars jerseys in 2011 to honor the AHL's 75th anniversary in a game versus the Lake Erie Monsters.
