Daredevil: The Album is the soundtrack album for the film Daredevil (2003), starring Ben Affleck. It was released on February 4, 2003 by Wind-up Records. Many of the songs on the album appeared in the film.

Three songs from the album were released as singles: Fuel's "Won't Back Down", the Calling's "For You", and Evanescence's "Bring Me to Life". Each of the singles had music videos, as did three other tracks from the album: "Fade Out/In" by Paloalto, "Caught in the Rain" by Revis, and "My Immortal" by Evanescence. "Bring Me to Life" won Best Hard Rock Performance at the 46th Grammy Awards, and Soundtrack Single of the Year at the Billboard Music Awards.

Three songs were omitted from release on the album: N.E.R.D.'s "Lapdance", Dara Shindler's "Faraway", and House of Pain's "Top o' the Morning to Ya". The album was one of the first collaborations between Marvel Comics and Wind-up Records, which would continue with the releases of The Punisher, Fantastic Four and the Daredevil sequel/spin-off Elektra.
