The Political Film Society Award for exposé is given out each year to a film that has an investigative depth into a subject matter and often exposes surprising information on the subject.  This award has been handed out by the Society since 1988.  Depending on the number of films that qualify, as few as one films has been nominated for this award before but as many as fourteen have been nominated in years past.

The film that first won this award was A Cry in the Dark in 1988 that was directed by Fred Schepisi. The award, as with any other Political Film Society Award, can go to a mainstream film, independent film, or even an international film.  The Political Film Society looks at a broad selection of films before it nominates them for an award.
