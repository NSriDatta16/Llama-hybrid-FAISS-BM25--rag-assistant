In mathematics, particularly in algebra, an indeterminate equation is an equation for which there is more than one solution. For example, the equation  is a simple indeterminate equation, as is . Indeterminate equations cannot be solved uniquely. In fact, in some cases it might even have infinitely many solutions. Some of the prominent examples of indeterminate equations include:

Univariate polynomial equation:

which has multiple solutions for the variable  in the complex plane—unless it can be rewritten in the form .

Non-degenerate conic equation:

where at least one of the given parameters , , and  is non-zero, and  and  are real variables.

Pell's equation:

where  is a given integer that is not a square number, and in which the variables  and  are required to be integers.

The equation of Pythagorean triples:

in which the variables , , and  are required to be positive integers.

The equation of the Fermat–Catalan conjecture:

in which the variables , ,  are required to be coprime positive integers, and the variables , , and  are required to be positive integers satisfying the following equation:
