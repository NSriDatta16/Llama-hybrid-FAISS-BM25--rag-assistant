Claude Bernard University Lyon 1 (, UCBL) is one of the three public universities of Lyon, France. It is named after the French physiologist Claude Bernard and specialises in science and technology, medicine, and sports science. It was established in 1971 by the merger of the 'faculté des sciences de Lyon' with the 'faculté de médecine'.

The main administrative, teaching and research facilities are located in Villeurbanne, with other campuses located in Gerland, Rockefeller, and Laennec in the 8th arrondissement of Lyon. Attached to the university are the Hospices Civils de Lyon, including the 'Centre Hospitalier Lyon-Sud', which is the largest teaching hospital in the Rhône-Alpes region and the second-largest in France.

The university has been independent since January 2009. In 2020 it managed an annual budget of over €420 million and had 2857 faculty.

History
On 17 March 1808, Napoleon I founded the University of France, a national organisation with responsibility for formal education from primary through to university level. This decree created the Academy of Lyon within the University and established the Lyon Faculty of Science. The Lyon Faculty of Medicine was founded on 8 November 1874 and was later merged with the Faculty of Science on 8 December 1970 to create Claude Bernard University.

Locations and buildings

Main sites
The university is not located on a single campus but has departments and other facilities distributed across several key sites throughout Lyon and the wider region. The LyonTech-la Doua campus located north of Villeurbanne and east of Lyon's Parc de la Tête d'Or hosts the administrative headquarters of the university as well as its Faculties of Science and Technology and of Sport Sciences.

A second key site, the Lyon Health East Campus, is located in the eighth arrondissement next to the Edouard Herriot hospital and the Vinatier medical centre. It hosts the Faculty of Odontology and the Lyon East Faculty of Medicine, in addition to several research institutes dedicated to medical and biological sciences.
