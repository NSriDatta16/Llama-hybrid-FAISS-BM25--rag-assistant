is a PlayStation game published by Bandai, based on the anime of the same name.

The game was never released outside Japan.

Gameplay
The player controls Spike Spiegel's Swordfish II from a third-person perspective. Each level involves chasing another ship (the bounty head) along a set track through different environments, while enemies (spaceships, robots, etc.) attack. Each stage ends with a boss battle, where the player confronts their target.

Between stages, bonus points earned can be used to purchase upgrades for the ship (faster speed, more powerful ammo, stronger laser).

Cast
In the same way that characters interacted with the player in Star Fox, series regulars Faye Valentine, Jet Black, and Radical Edward appear on screen to offer advice. Each character is voiced by their original Japanese voice actor. Other series regular Ein also occasionally appears.

Music
Shinsuke Sugiuchi composed the soundtrack for the game which greatly diverges from the TV show in style.
