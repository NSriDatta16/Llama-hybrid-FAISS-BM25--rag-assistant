"Louie, Go Home" is a song written by Paul Revere and Mark Lindsay as a sequel after Richard Berry declined their request for a follow-up to "Louie Louie".  It was recorded by Paul Revere and the Raiders in 1963 and released in March 1964.

Two versions of "Louie, Go Home" were issued. The original (with sax opening) was only released as a single. A re-recorded "groovy, quasi-psychedelic rearrangement" (with guitar opening) was featured on the Midnight Ride album in 1966 as well as the group's first Greatest Hits compilation the following year.

Cover versions

Davie Jones with the King Bees version

When manager Leslie Conn obtained an acetate of the Raiders version in 1964, the young David Bowie, then still called David Jones, recorded the song with his band Davie Jones and the King Bees. He titled it "Louie, Louie Go Home" and released it as the B-side of Bowie's first ever single "Liza Jane".

Bowie's version of the song also appeared on the compilations Another Face (1981) and Early On (1964-1966) (1991). Bowie borrowed the call-and-response refrain of 'Just a little bit louder now' for the track "She'll Drive the Big Car" in 2003.
