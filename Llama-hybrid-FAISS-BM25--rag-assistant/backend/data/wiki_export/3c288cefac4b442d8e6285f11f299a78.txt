Cocktail is the debut album of Mexican electropop band Belanova.
The album was recorded in Mexico City in 2002 and released on 14 February 2003 with very little promotion. Some mexican radio stations started adding the first single, "Tus Ojos" to their playlists in the spring of 2003. By the summer of that year the album entered the charts in Mexico, reaching its peak position of #5 and #3 on the Mexican Latin Albums Chart. The band embarked on a 100-concert tour across the country and the album finally reached Gold status (for selling 50,000 copies) after three official singles. The Mexican edition of Rolling Stone named the album, Cocktail, one of the best five albums of 2003.
In 2005 the album was re-issued on reduced priced collections by Universal Music Mexico and because of this the sales of the album increased considerably, re-entering on the Mexican Top 100 Albums at seventy-nine and peaking at fifty-four after a few weeks. The album has been re-issued on Universal Music's slide-pack collections, making it the first time that the album has been available outside of Mexico.
