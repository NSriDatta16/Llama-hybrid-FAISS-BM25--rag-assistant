History

In 1364 offered Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor the town privileges to the population, these however rejected, allegedly because they did not want to build any walls.
The tradition of Laichingen linen weaving goes back until the Middle Ages.  The poor soils on the Alb gave only small harvests, and so the inhabitants have relied on the growing of flax and the trade with the town of Ulm. One of the in 1677 built weber houses stood in Laichingen till 2002. It was dismantled and rebuilt and can now be visited in the open air museum in Beuren.

Laichingen textile industry
The linen weaving was an important economic activity. In the period after the Second World War, the consequences of the war were still very noticeable. Many of the Laichingen companies were used during the war for making war necessary materials. After the war six companies of Laichingen were authorized by the American military government to resume their production.

So many looms were rebuilt and put into operation. With the currency reform the windows of the shops were filled and also Laichingen textile industry could benefit. The demand for textiles rose after the war enormously, especially bed linen was now in demand. This led to a veritable boom in this industry. In 1948, all companies were fully occupied in Laichingen and then followed from 1950 to 1960, a wave of start-ups, because everyone wanted to participate in the upswing. Over the next 10 years, many textiles were produced in Laichingen.
