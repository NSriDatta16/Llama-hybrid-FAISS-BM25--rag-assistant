Dig Your Roots/Découvre tes racines is a Canadian series of compilation albums, released by the National Campus and Community Radio Association (NCRA/ANREC) in the 2000s to promote new and emerging artists. The project was launched in 2002, utilizing development funding that Corus Entertainment provided to the NCRA/ANREC as part of a benefits package relating to a major radio acquisition transaction.

Each year's Dig Your Roots compilation focused on a particular genre of music. Submissions were judged by a panel that first chose up to 100 artists to be featured through streaming audio on the project's website. It then chose the 15 best entries for the CD compilation. The albums were also promoted by a series of live concert broadcasts which aired on participating campus and community radio stations across Canada.

Project 1: Hip Hop (2003) 
The first album, released in 2003, featured unsigned hip hop artists. The five associated concert shows were held on March 17 in Surrey, British Columbia; March 20 in Winnipeg, Manitoba; March 23 in Toronto, Ontario; March 26 in Montreal, Quebec; and March 29 in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

In Exclaim!'s review of the album, critic Thomas Quinlan called it "the greatest Canadian hip-hop compilation since Cold Front", claiming that it had corrected "the mistakes of Rap Essentials."

Notes

1 Due to manufacturer error, another song, Anodajay's "Le détenu", was mistakenly substituted on the CD for this one. Dig Your Roots subsequently released a special three-song sampler of Les Architekts' songs to compensate for the error.
