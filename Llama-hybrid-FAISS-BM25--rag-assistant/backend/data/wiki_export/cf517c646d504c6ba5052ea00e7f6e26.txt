The Binghamton Metropolitan Statistical Area, also called Greater Binghamton or the Triple Cities, is a region of southern Upstate New York in the Northeastern United States, anchored by Binghamton. The MSA encompasses Broome and Tioga counties, which together had a population of 247,138 as of the 2020 census.  From 1963 to 1983, the MSA also included neighboring Susquehanna County in Pennsylvania, part of which still falls in the Binghamton, NY–PA Urban Area.  In addition to these three counties, the greater region includes parts of Delaware and Chenango counties in New York; portions of Cortland and Otsego counties in New York and Wayne County, Pennsylvania are sometimes considered part of the region as well. Using the definition of a 30-mile radius from Binghamton, the population as of the 2010 census is 317,331.

The Greater Binghamton name was adopted in the early 21st century to better identify the region with its most well-known city in efforts of marketing and external promotion.

The metropolitan area is located in the Southern Tier of New York State and lies on Pennsylvania's northern border, approximately 66 miles (110 km) south of Syracuse, New York.

Triple Cities
Historically, the region has been known as the Triple Cities and is made up of Binghamton, Johnson City, and Endicott, the latter two of which are technically villages.

The area is also sometimes called the "Greater Binghamton Area" as the city of Binghamton is the largest and most prominent of the three, with a population greater than the other two combined, and a much larger geographical area.  The three incorporated areas are close enough to appear as a single large, spread out, city. They are economically integrated, though they retain their political identities.

The idea of merging the three into a single city has been broached, but is politically unlikely. While "triple cities" strictly covers only the three main municipalities, the term also refers broadly to the surrounding area of conurbation, including Endwell, West Corners, the Upper Front Street area (technically in the town of Dickinson), and the town of Vestal. Vestal is home to the Vestal Parkway, a major commercial strip for the entire area, housing one of the two major multiplex theaters in the area, and a number of shopping plazas, major chain stores, and eateries. Binghamton University is also physically located in Vestal, though its mailing address is in Binghamton.

Transportation

The core municipalities of Binghamton, Johnson City, and Endicott are connected together by the Southern Tier Expressway (NY 17, future Interstate 86). Along with NY 17, Interstate 81 and Interstate 88 provide high-speed expressways that connect the majority of communities in the metro area together. I-81 connects the metro area to Syracuse, Canada, and Pennsylvania, while NY 17 connects the area to New York City and Western New York, and I-88 provides connections to Albany and New England. U.S. Route 11 and New York State Route 12 serve as important non-expressway gateways to the area.

Main Street (NY 17C) is connected as a single road through much of the urban core, beginning in downtown Binghamton and running through Johnson City, Endwell, and Endicott.

Broome County Transit operates 14 fixed route bus lines in the metropolitan area. Greyhound Bus Lines and New York Trailways operate intercity coach bus service through Binghamton, with direct connection to major cities in the region such as Ithaca, Syracuse, Rochester, Albany, and New York City.

The Greater Binghamton Airport is located in the Village of Johnson City. Currently Delta and Avelo airlines service the airport.
