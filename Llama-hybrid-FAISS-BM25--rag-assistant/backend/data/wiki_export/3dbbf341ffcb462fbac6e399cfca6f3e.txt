Maurren Higa Maggi (born June 25, 1976, in São Carlos) is a former Brazilian track and field athlete and Olympic gold medallist. She is the South American record holder in the 100 metres hurdles and long jump, with 12.71 seconds and 7.26 metres respectively. She also has a best of 14.53 metres in the triple jump – a former South American record. She is the first Brazilian woman to win an Olympic gold medal in an individual sport.

In 2003, Maurren got in a doping scandal after clostebol was found on her sample. She claimed that an anti-scarring gel sheet that she used contained the anabolic steroid in its composition. Maurren was suspended for two years, preventing her from participating in the 2003 Pan American Games. She missed going to the Olympic Games due to a pregnancy.

She finished second at the 2009 Troféu Brasil Caixa de Atletismo to Keila Costa, losing the event for the first time since 1998.

Maurren was married to racer Antônio Pizzonia, with whom she has a daughter, Sophia.
