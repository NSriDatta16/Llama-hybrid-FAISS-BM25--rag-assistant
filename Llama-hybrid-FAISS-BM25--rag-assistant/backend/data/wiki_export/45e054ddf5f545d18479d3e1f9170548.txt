History
 In 1882, El Paso Independent School District was established, with Joseph Magoffin, Samuel Freudenthal and Edward Pew as the founding trustees and Calvin W. Esterly as the first superintendent.
 In 1889, the first kindergarten ever established in Texas was established at Alamo Elementary School in the EPISD.
 In 1916, the first high school in the EPISD was established: El Paso High School.
 In 1927, Bowie High School was established to reduce overcrowding at El Paso High School by converting a grammar school built in 1923 in Central El Paso.
 In 1930, Austin High School was established as the third high school in the EPISD, admitting its first students following its construction in 1929.
In 1949, Jefferson High School was established in Central El Paso
 In 1955, Burges High School was established in East El Paso.
 In 1959, Irvin High School was established in Northeast El Paso.
 In 1961, Andress High School was established in Northeast El Paso.
 In 1962, Coronado High School was established in Northwest El Paso.
 In 1993, Franklin High School was established in Northwest El Paso.
 In 1999, the district's oldest operating school, Alamo Elementary School, celebrated its 100th birthday.
 In 2000, Chapin High School was established in Northeast El Paso.
 In 2011, the district's superintendent Lorenzo Garcia was arrested by the FBI. He later pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit mail fraud- he stole money from the district and also had high school principals illegally kick students out of school and illegally change 10th graders to being listed as members of other grades, in order to cheat on the state's standardized tests.
 In 2012, the district's board of trustees were stripped of power by the Texas Education Agency, and oversight of the district was given to a TEA-appointed board of managers, because the trustees failed to stop Garcia's wrongdoing and failed to fire his co-conspirators after he was arrested.

Administrative offices

Its current headquarters are in Downtown El Paso. It includes two buildings: an , eight story building that was acquired and a newly built , three story building.

The district began leasing a property on the grounds of El Paso International Airport in 1963 to house its administrative headquarters. By the 2010s the City of El Paso desired the use of the property for airport expansion, but chose to defer the original 2014 expiration of the lease to at least December 31, 2019 so EPISD had time to find a new headquarters location. In 2021 the current EPISD headquarters opened. The district spent $3.2 million to buy the land and the building on it for the downtown headquarters.
