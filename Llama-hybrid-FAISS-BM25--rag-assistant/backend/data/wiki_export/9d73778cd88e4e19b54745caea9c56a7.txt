The Ukrainian Super Cup () is an association football game of the Ukrainian Premier League in traditional super cup format that acts as the grand-opening for every new football competition season in Ukraine. Originally it was set as a contest between the winners of the previous season's Ukrainian Championship and Ukrainian Cup. From 2008 through 2014, it was branded as the Inter Super Cup of Ukraine, in 2017 – Super Cup Fokstrot.

History and overview
The competition and its trophy was presented on 1 July 2007 in hotel "Ekspres". In the event participated president of the Professional Football League of Ukraine (PFL) Ravil Safiullin, general director of Info-sport Marketing Serhiy Kharchenko, representative of the game general sponsor "Olimp". At the press conference Mr.Safiullin informed several details about the new tournament among which was the money prize fund that consisted of 75,000 "conditional units", a lottery for fans winner of which would receive a car, the game opening show was planned to be hosted by Ukrainian singer Kateryna Buzhynska (uk). It was also informed that there will be no extra time and series of penalty kicks would follow right after the regular time.

The president of PFL refused to disclose the amount of money that was paid to create the Super Cup trophy. He noted that the trophy will be given away for eternal keeping to the team that would win it five times.

The drawing for the trophy was created by Mykhailo Cheburakhin ("Dialan-M" company), for which he received a reward of 1,000 "conditional units".

The prize money fund for the second edition in 2005 was established at ₴375,000.

Format
The Ukrainian Super Cup usually features one representative of the Ukrainian Premier League and another the Ukrainian Cup. In event when both tournaments were won by one club, participation in the game is granted to the cup finalist (until 2014) or the league runner-up (since 2015).

On some occasions when the national cup was won by a national champion, it was challenged by the league runner-up or the cup finalist.

Traditionally playing in Odesa at the Chornomorets Stadium, the season's opening match did not initially have a "fixed" venue. The decision on conducting the match in Odesa in 2005 was adopted by the PFL Bureau three days before the game and on petition of both Dynamo and Shakhtar. Due to the preparation for UEFA Euro 2012, however, the newly established tradition changed and for the 2008 rendition it has been moved to Poltava's Oleksiy Butovsky Vorskla Stadium. In 2009, the cup venue changed once again to the Sumy's Yuvileiny Stadium which stood relatively underutilized since the main city football club went bankrupt. The 2009 edition featured Vorskla, which became the first team outside of the Ukrainian derby (Dynamo and Shakhtar) to participate. In 2007 and 2008, the Cup played-off between the first and second placed teams as one of the team won both the Cup and the Premier League.

Sponsors
The 2008 rendition was officially known as Inter Super Cup of Ukraine and sponsored by the TV channel Inter. In 2009, the contract was extended for another three years and later again to 2014. The very first Super Cup was handed over by Prime Minister of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych.

In 2016, the tournament received another sponsor, an American construction company UDP (Urban Development + Partners).

The prize money fund in 2014 and 2015 consisted of ₴1 million. The winner was to receive 650,000 and the other finalist 350,000.
