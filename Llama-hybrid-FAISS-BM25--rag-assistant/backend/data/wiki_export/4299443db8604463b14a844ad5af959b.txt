Anthony Elliott-Kelly FAcSS or Anthony Kelly, better known as Tony Kelly, is an Irish academic who is currently Professor of Education at the University of Southampton, England.

Education and career
Kelly attended the National University of Ireland, Queens' College, Cambridge and Trinity College, Cambridge.

He previously worked at the University of Cambridge with Mel West, and before that was a headteacher in Ireland. His background is in applied mathematics and theoretical physics. He is a fellow of the Institute of Physics and of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications, organizations devoted to improving education and research.  In 2013 he was elected as an Academician of the Academy of Social Sciences. He was a leading figure in the movement to integrate and rationalise education in the Irish border region where he developed new governance structures.

Kelly was well known in Ireland because of his work in merging schools with different traditions. As a student at Cambridge he famously cast doubt on the sincerity of a student discussion (on Irish politics) in a student society.

Kelly was founding editor of the journal Education, Knowledge and Economy, serves on the editorial board of other international academic journals, and is an invited lecturer at several leading universities outside the UK. He serves on several national UK steering groups and approval panels, and has appeared before the House of Commons Select Committee on Education. He served on the REF2014 and REF2021 panels for Education. He also retains an interest and involvement in Anglo-Irish affairs. He is the author of approximately one hundred single-authored research reports, books and papers in leading academic journals.
