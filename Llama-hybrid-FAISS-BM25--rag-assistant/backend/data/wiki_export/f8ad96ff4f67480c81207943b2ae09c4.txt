History

Early years
VMC-2 was formally commissioned at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point on September 15, 1952, evolving from the Airborne Early Warning and Electronic Countermeasures section of the Wing Headquarters Squadron. On December 1, 1955, the squadron was combined with Marine Photographic Squadron 2 (VMJ-2). In July 1975, VMCJ-2 was reorganized into separate electronic warfare and photoreconnaissance squadrons. VMAQ-2, based at MCAS Cherry Point, retained all electronic warfare aircraft, while the photo reconnaissance aircraft became VMFP-3, based at Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, California.

Some of the aircraft flown by VMAQ-3's tactical electronic warfare predecessors included; the AD-5Q Skyraider, the EF-10B Skyknight and the EA-6A Electric Intruder. In 1977, the Marine Corps received the first of its EA-6B "Prowlers,".

Reorganization
VMAQ-2 was organized into three Detachments; XRAY, YANKEE and ZULU to better support the Marine Corps' worldwide mission. On July 1, 1992, VMAQ-3 was commissioned and formed from the personnel and aircraft of VMAQ-2 Detachment ZULU.  In October 1994, VMAQ-3 received The Association of Old Crows Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron of the Year Award.

VMAQ-3 began integrating with Carrier Airwing One (CVW-1), in December 1994 and deployed to the Mediterranean Sea and Persian Gulf aboard the  in August 1995. The Squadron saw combat action in Operation Deliberate Force, Operation Deny Flight and Operation Decisive Endeavor.
