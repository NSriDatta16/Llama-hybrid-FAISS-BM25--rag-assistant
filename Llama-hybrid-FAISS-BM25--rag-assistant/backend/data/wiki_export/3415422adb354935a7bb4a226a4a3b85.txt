The meningeal branch of the mandibular nerve (also known as the nervus spinosus) is a sensory branch of the mandibular nerve (CN V3) that enters the middle cranial fossa through either the foramen spinosum or foramen ovale to innervate the meninges of this fossa as well as the mastoid air cells.

Anatomy

Branches 
It divides into two branches - anterior and posterior - which accompany the main divisions of the middle meningeal artery and supply the dura mater:

 The anterior branch communicates with the meningeal branch of the maxillary nerve.

 The posterior branch also supplies the mucous lining of the mastoid cells.
