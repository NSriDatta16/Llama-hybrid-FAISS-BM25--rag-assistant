Eliahu Ibrahim Jury (May 23, 1923 – September 20, 2020) was an Iraqi-born American engineer. He received his the E.E. degree from the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Mandatory Palestine (now, Israel), in 1947, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, in 1949, and the Sc.D. degree degree from Columbia University of New York City in 1953. He was professor of electrical engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Miami.

He developed the advanced Z-transform, used in digital control systems and signal processing. He was the creator of the Jury stability criterion, which is named after him.

He was a Life Fellow of the IEEE and received the Rufus Oldenburger Medal from the ASME, the First Education Award of IEEE Circuits and Systems Society, and the IEEE Millennium Medal. In 1993 he received the AACC's Richard E. Bellman Control Heritage Award.
