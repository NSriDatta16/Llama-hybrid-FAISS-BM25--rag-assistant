WBGT-CD (channel 46) is a low-power, Class A television station in Rochester, New York, United States, affiliated with MyNetworkTV. Owned by Vision Communications, the station has studios on Buffalo Road (NY 33) in the town of Gates (with a Rochester postal address), and its transmitter is located on Pinnacle Hill. It can also be seen on Charter Spectrum channel 18 (hence the My 18 branding).

History

WBGT-CD began operations as WBGT-LP on February 2, 1998. For its first ten months on-air, it was an independent station under the Big TV branding, before it became an UPN affiliate in November of that year. Despite the affiliation, the station used the branding throughout most of the years of the network, only ditching it after 2003. The Victor translator was added in 1999, and in 2001, Time Warner Cable (predecessor of Charter Spectrum) added WBGT-LP to its lineup. On January 24, 2006, The WB and UPN announced that the networks would end broadcasting and merge to form The CW, which signed with cable-only WB affiliate WRWB (the forerunner of WHAM-DT2). Several weeks later, MyNetworkTV was announced by Fox as an alternative for UPN or WB affiliates not chosen by the CW. WBGT-LP quickly signed an affiliation deal with MyNetworkTV, and joined the network at its launch on September 5, 2006. Around this time, the suffix was changed from -LP to -CA.

The station has never been added to DirecTV or Dish Network; it has no must-carry rights as a low-power operation. Eventually, when it signed on its digital facilities, the station's calls were changed to WBGT-CD.
