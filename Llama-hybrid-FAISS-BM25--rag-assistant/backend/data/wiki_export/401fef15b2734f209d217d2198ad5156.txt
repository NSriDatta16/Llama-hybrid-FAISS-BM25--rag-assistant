Perhaps the first of what would become many notable mountain lists around the world was Sir Hugh Munro’s catalogue of the Munros, the peaks above 3,000’ elevation in Scotland. Once defined the list became a popular target for what became known as peak bagging, where the adventurous attempted to summit all of the peaks on the list.

Over time the peaks on such lists grew more challenging, with perhaps the eight-thousanders as the most notable (the mentioned list being first fully completed by Reinhold Messner in 1986).  Other extreme examples are the Seven Summits, defined as the highest peaks on each of the seven continents.

An ever-growing collection of peak lists is maintained and published on mountaineering-related websites.
