History

Kwinana was originally served by a station on the Fremantle line. However passenger services ceased in the 1960s, with the line closed in 1973.

During planning, the station was known as Thomas Road station, as it was near Thomas Road.

For the construction of the railway to Mandurah, among other rail projects in Perth, New MetroRail was set up as a division of the Public Transport Authority. The design and construction of the Mandurah railway line was split up into eight "packages". Among the things that were part of Package A was the bulk earthworks for several stations on the line, including Kwinana station. The $310 million contract for Package A was awarded to a joint venture between John Holland, MacMahon Contractors, and Multiplex Constructions Pty Ltd on 23 May 2004.

The actual construction of Kwinana station, along with Cockburn Central station and Wellard station, was part of Package B. The designer for Package B was Woodhead International Architects and MPS Architects. The design contract was awarded to them in April 2002, at a cost of $2.1 million. Expressions of interest for the construction of Package B opened in September 2003. The contract for the construction of Package B was awarded to the consortium of Doric Constructions and Brierty Contractors in March 2005, at a cost of $32 million. Construction on the station began in late 2005. By January 2007, the station was complete and handed over to the Public Transport Authority. Kwinana station opened along with the rest of the Mandurah line on 23 December 2007.
