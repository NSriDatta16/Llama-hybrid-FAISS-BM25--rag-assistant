Indiana University of Pennsylvania
Dr. Atwater served as president of Indiana University of Pennsylvania, the largest member university of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education, from 2005 to 2010.  During his tenure at IUP, he attempted to change the institution's "party-school" image. The university also continued an ambitious residential hall construction project under Atwater's leadership.

In December 2009, 84% of voting faculty members chose "no confidence" in Atwater as president. The vote was based on 31 specific complaints identified by the faculty union, including questionable use of university funds, poor leadership style, and poor decision-making. The vote of "no confidence" also included allegations of an "imperialistic leadership style."

Atwater resigned as president of IUP on June 30, 2010, to serve as a Senior Fellow at the American Association of State Colleges and Universities.

Since his departure as president, Atwater has continued to be the subject of news reports probing his spending practices at IUP.
