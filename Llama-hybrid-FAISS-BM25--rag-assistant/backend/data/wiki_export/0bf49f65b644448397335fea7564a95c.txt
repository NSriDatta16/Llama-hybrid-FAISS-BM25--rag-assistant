The 1998 Philippines men's national basketball team, nicknamed the "Philippine Centennial Team", competed in the 1998 Asian Games. The team consisted of professional players in the country that included national team veterans Allan Caidic and Alvin Patrimonio, both sharing the distinction of being the only PBA players to represent the country in four Asian Games basketball tournaments since 1986. The team nickname was a reference to the centennial celebration of the independence of the Philippines.

The national team participated in the Philippine Basketball Association Centennial Cup (where they placed last, where other team had two non-Filipinos in their lineups) and later played exhibition games against the China national basketball team and the PBA All-Star (non-national team members) Selection. The Nationals went on to win the 21st William Jones Cup International Basketball Tournament in Taiwan and then on a tough Midwest tour of the United States.

The national team’s main goal was to win the 1998 Asian Games basketball tournament and to reclaim Philippine basketball supremacy in Asia. The team started the tournament by winning four games in a row and finished with a 5-2 record losing to China and Korea, but they were able to capture the Bronze medal in the play-offs.

Overall, the national basketball achievements of 1998 include the William Jones Cup and the Asian Games bronze medal. This team was the third PBA-backed national team that followed the 1994 national team (finished fourth) and the 1990 national team (finished second – Silver Medal), and preceded the 2002 national team that finished fourth in the Asian Games.
