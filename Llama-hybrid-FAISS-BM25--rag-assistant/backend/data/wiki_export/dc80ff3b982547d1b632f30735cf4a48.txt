The Bawean, or Baweans, or also Baweanese, also called Bawean Madurese (Madurese: , , or ) are an ethnic group native to the island of Bawean, located in the Java Sea off the coast of Java, Indonesia. They are considered a distinct ethnic group within the larger Javanese cultural sphere. The Bawean people have their own unique language, also called Bawean, which belongs to the Austronesian language family.

Historically, the Bawean Island was a trading post and a hub for maritime activities, which brought influences from various cultures such as Javanese, Madurese, Banjarese, Makassarese, Chinese, and Arab. As a result, the Bawean people have a rich cultural heritage that blends elements from these diverse influences. 

The majority of Bawean people are Muslims, and Islamic traditions and values play a significant role in their daily lives. They have a close-knit community structure and maintain strong cultural and social ties. Traditionally, the Bawean people have been involved in various occupations, including agriculture, fishing, and maritime trade. 

Migration also plays a significant role in the history and present-day dynamics of the Bawean people. Due to various factors, including economic opportunities, trade networks, and colonial influences, the Bawean people have engaged in migration both within Indonesia and to other countries. They traveled to different parts of the Indonesian archipelago and even ventured further to neighboring countries like Malaysia and Singapore for trade and economic purposes. In the latter two countries, they are known as Boyan (originally an English mispronunciation of Bawean, but now generally used, including as self-designation of the local Bawean community). These maritime connections allowed them to establish communities and settlements in different regions.

History

Although the Baweans are originally belongs to the Madurese group in general, however, the Baweans are also officially classified and recognized as a distinct ethnic group by the Indonesian Government due to their multiple inter-connected historical lineage backgrounds; for instance, common intermarriage phenomenon with the Javanese, an ethnic group originally from the Java Island located in southern Bawean Islands (blooming intensively since the conquest of Majapahit era over Bawean until present-day). The official Indonesian dictionary defines the Baweans as "mixed people of Javanese, Madurese, Banjar, Bugis, and Makassar which occurred since hundreds of years ago".

Distribution

The homeland of the Bawean people is the Bawean Islands in the Java Sea. As a result of migration, nowadays the Baweans can be found in all regions across Indonesia, especially in western Indonesian region. Some small population (which mostly considered or viewed as ethnic minority group) of Baweans also can be found in several countries across Southeast Asia and Oceania, such as in Singapore, Australia, Vietnam, Malaysia, etc.

Culture

As part of the wider Javanese cultural sphere, the culture possessed by the Baweans shared quite similar cultural traits to those Javanese people in general. The arts and crafts of Baweans generally are following those in Java, such as the Batik-making culture, the martial art of Pencak and Silat, the prominent usage of Kris dagger, etc. However, the Baweans also quite well-known for their ꦠꦶꦏꦂ (,  'plaited mat') handicraft tradition adorned with intricate Bawean's cultural patterns which symbolize their ethnic identity; these cultural practice is officially recognized by Indonesian government as integral part of national's Intangible Cultural Heritage.

Cultural architecture

The  commonly functioned as the outdoor meeting point to welcome the non-formal guests (traditionally speaking, non-formal guests means the guests that came only for having a casual talks, not the one who are going to make important deals or agreements), apart from that, the  also traditionally functioned as the barn to store the harvested rice or another crops.

Cultural clothing

Following their ancestors whose originally came from Java and Madura islands, the Baweans usually wore the cultural clothing tradition of ultimate Javanese origin, which may include the prominent usage of  for women as well as the Batik loincloth () for both gender, some Majapahit naval flag's derived clothing may also apparent on the island which exhibits their Madurese and Eastern Javanese kinship. One of the popular Batik-making traditions possessed by the Baweans is called the  ( ), chracterized by its prominent depiction of Bawean's cultural motifs. Administratively part of Gresik in mainland Java, some Bawean islanders in Bawean Islands also preserved the  tradition, which is part of the larger  (Indonesian for 'woven fabric') uniquely native to Gresik.

Language

According to anthropological and linguistic studies, the Baweans speak the Bawean Madurese, a western dialect of Madurese language closely related to the Bangkalan Madurese spoken natively in Bangkalan (Madura Island) with >80% to 94% dialectical similarity. Part of Javanic languages family, some Javanese (especially through Old Javanese) linguistic elements also apparent within the Bawean Madurese (as well as Madurese in general). However, the Baweans in some villages still preserve their spoken language in full Javanese, such as in the Diponggo village. These language variety is traditionally written in both Javanese (following the Javanese script of Standard Madurese) and Pegon (Java-Arabic) scripts, but nowadays it has gradually written using the Latin script as well (following the Standard Madurese romanization).

Livelihood

The Baweans traditionally are fishermen, farmers, gardeners, craftsmen,  weavers, and some of them succeed as businessmen. Descended from Javanese and Madurese sailors, back in ancient times, the Baweans also recorded as one of notable 'maritime people' who were socially active dealing with foreign (non-native Indonesians) traders such as with the Arabs, Indians, Chinese, etc and even regarded as one of the 'maritime axis' people of Indonesia; these can be examined through some archaeological findings in Bawean Island, from ancient harbours sites to the Arabic-carved gravestones which dates back to pre-Islamic era.
