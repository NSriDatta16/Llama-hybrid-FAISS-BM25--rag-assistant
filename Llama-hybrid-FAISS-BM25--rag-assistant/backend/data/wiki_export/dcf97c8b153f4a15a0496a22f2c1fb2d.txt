Geography 
Albany Creek is located approximately 17 kilometres north-west of the Brisbane central business district.

Cashs Crossing is a historic crossing point of the South Pine River  (). It takes its name from early settlers James and Mary Cash, who settled near the crossing point. South Pine Road now crosses the river at that point via a bridge.

History 
Albany Creek is situated in the Yugarabul traditional Indigenous Australian country.

The suburb of Albany Creek was originally established on the intersection of two Aboriginal tracks.  The main track formed the primary route north of Brisbane and is still known as "Old Northern Road".  The second track formed a route from Old Northern Road to Little Cabbage Tree Creek in Aspley and onto Downfall Creek in Chermside.  Albany Creek Road and Gympie Road now follow this second route.

Albany Creek was originally known as Chinaman's Creek before its name was changed due to growing anti-Chinese sentiment amongst white residents resistant to rising migration that came with the newly-opened gold fields. The new name was chosen in 1885 to honour the Duke of Albany.

A United Methodist Free Church opened in Chinaman's Creek on Sunday 30 December 1866.

Chinaman's Creek State School opened on 25 January 1875, but was downgraded to Chinamans Creek Provisional School in 1883. In 1887 it became Albany Creek State School.

Cashs Crossing at the South Pine River was on the main route from Brisbane to Gympie. In 1891 it was proposed to build a bridge over it. Construction of the bridge had commenced by August 1892. South Pine Bridge was completed in November 1892. It survived the disastrous floods in February 1893 despite three days of great concern.

Initially a rural area, Albany Creek began to develop as a suburban area in the 1960s as the Brisbane metropolitan area expanded. This led to the opening of more schools to cater for the growing population with Albany Hills State School opening on 30 January 1979, Albany Creek State High School opening on 25 January 1982, Good Shepherd Christian (Baptist) School opening in 1983, and All Saints (Catholic) Primary School opening on 24 January 1989.

Albany Creek public library opened in 2000.
