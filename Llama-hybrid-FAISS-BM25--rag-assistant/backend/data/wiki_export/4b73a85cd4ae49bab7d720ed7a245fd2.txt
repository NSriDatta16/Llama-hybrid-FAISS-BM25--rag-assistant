Elsbeth Johanna Irma Baltuttis (Lithuanian: Baltutis; 28 September 1920 — 20 May 1958) was a German singer and entertainer based in Leipzig, Germany.

Early life
Irma was born in the Leutzsch district of Leipzig, to Ernst Baltuttis and Elsa Hamann. Her parents recognized her talent and encouraged training for music early on.

Career 
After training in music during the Third Reich, her singing career took place within the German Democratic Republic after the Soviet occupation of Eastern Germany. Some of her music is featured on Spotify.

Personal life 
In the early 1950s, she married a doctor named Max Herricht. They had no children.

Death 
Baltuttis died on May 20th, 1958, after falling out of her apartment window in Leipzig. Although her death was officially classified as suicide, some speculated that her husband had pushed her out of the window. This speculation was fueled by the post-mortem circumstances: no autopsy was performed, nor a coroner's inquest held. Supposedly, her husband was remarkably taciturn about her death. Herricht was an important Communist Party member, and in a position to quash any official attention to Baltuttis's death.
