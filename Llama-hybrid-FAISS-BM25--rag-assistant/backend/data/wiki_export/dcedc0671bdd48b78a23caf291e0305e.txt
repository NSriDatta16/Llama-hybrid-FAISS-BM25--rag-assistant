Marketing

The "It's Time for a Tiger" slogan for Tiger Beer has run for decades since its inception in the 1930s.

The writer Anthony Burgess named his first novel Time for a Tiger (the first part of the Malayan trilogy The Long Day Wanes) as the beer was popular in the Malaya of the 1950s, where Burgess was working.

Burgess reveals in his autobiography that, when his Time for a Tiger was published, he asked the manufacturer, then Fraser and Neave, for a complimentary clock with the Tiger beer slogan. The brewery declined to offer this or any other gift to him. But, fourteen years later, when Burgess was more famous, it relented. In 1970, the company offered Burgess the privilege to consume any of their beers free of charge while in Singapore. However, in his own words, Burgess wrote in response: "But it was too late, I had become wholly a gin man."

The Tiger Sky Tower operated in Sentosa until 2018.

Awards
Tiger Beer has entered a number of beer tasting competitions and has performed well. At the 2011 World Quality Selections, organised by Monde Selection, the brand won a Gold Quality award.
