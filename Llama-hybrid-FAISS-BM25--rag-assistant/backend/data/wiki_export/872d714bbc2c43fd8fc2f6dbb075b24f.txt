Students are admitted through competitive examinations for students holding a Higher School Diploma or by virtue of outstanding academic records.
Specialist degree opens access to professional practice in areas like medicine, engineering and teaching, and it is also the traditional prerequisite for admission to doctoral studies. The qualification of  Specialist Diploma is awarded after studies lasting 5 to 6 years. The diploma is awarded in all fields of study, including various specializations. The State final attestation for a Specialist Diploma covers the defense of a project or a thesis and State final examinations.
