Bloomberg Radio is a radio service of Bloomberg L.P. that provides global business news programming 24 hours a day. The format is general and financial news, offering local, national and international news reports along with financial market updates and interviews with corporate executives, economists and industry analysts. On off hours, local stations may preempt with local sports play-by-play coverage such as college basketball, tennis and other sports coverage.

Bloomberg Radio is broadcast on radio stations around the United States, and directly operates five radio stations:

WBBR 1130 AM in New York City.
WRCA 1330 AM in Watertown-Boston and WNBP 1450 AM Newburyport-Boston along with two FM translators at 106.1 MHz.
KNEW 960 AM in Oakland-San Francisco, along with the HD Radio digital subchannel on 103.7 KOSF-HD2.
WDCH-FM 99.1 FM in Bowie, Maryland, serving Washington, D.C., and Baltimore.

In 1992, Bloomberg purchased the first of these, WBBR 1130 AM in New York (at the time using the call sign WNEW), for $13.5 million. Bloomberg took over the operation of WXKS (1200 AM) in Newton, Massachusetts, (serving Boston) on March 1, 2013. The following year, Bloomberg began programming KNEW on September 29, 2014. Both stations are owned and operated by iHeartMedia, Inc., but are programmed by Bloomberg Radio under a local marketing agreement (LMA).  On December 21, 2015, Bloomberg Radio launched a similar arrangement on CBS Radio-owned WNEW-FM, its first FM radio station. The call letters of WNEW-FM were later changed to WDCH-FM and the station is now owned by Entercom. On July 4, 2017, Bloomberg moved its programming in Boston to WRCA, owned by Beasley Media Group.  Later that year, it fully acquired WNBP 1450 AM in Newburyport to serve as a simulcast of WRCA.  Both WRCA and WNBP operate translator stations on 106.1 FM.  Its LMA with WXKS expired on March 1, 2018. Bloomberg Radio is also heard nationally on Sirius XM satellite radio channel 119. Select programming is also broadcast in London UK on DAB digital radio via the London 3 multiplex (VHF block 11B), with simulcasts of the Bloomberg TV audio at other times.

Programming
The original Bloomberg Radio news format divided each hour of the day into three 20-minute segments, each of which contained stock market updates, business headlines, traffic, weather, local news/sports, a human interest piece or a general update about cultural happenings. However, by 2010, Bloomberg Radio had shifted from a headline service to a discussion-based format in order to offer more in-depth market and economic analysis. Bloomberg Radio is the world's only global business radio service. Bloomberg Daybreak Asia broadcasts live from New York and Hong Kong, Sunday through Thursday 6:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. ET (morning drive time in Asian time zones.) It is then followed by Bloomberg Daybreak Europe, originating from London, on Monday to Friday 1:00 a.m. to 5:00 a.m. ET (morning drive time GMT). Finally, Bloomberg Daybreak Americas is live until 7:00 a.m. ET from New York, Boston, Washington DC and San Francisco.  Through these programs, Bloomberg Radio offers a start to the business day globally, via the Bloomberg Radio+ Mobile App and via its live stream on Bloomberg.com and the Bloomberg Terminal. During each day, the network broadcasts over 20 live interviews with economists, market analysts, and other influential newsmakers on shows such as Bloomberg Surveillance with Tom Keene and Michael McKee which airs weekday mornings from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. ET.
