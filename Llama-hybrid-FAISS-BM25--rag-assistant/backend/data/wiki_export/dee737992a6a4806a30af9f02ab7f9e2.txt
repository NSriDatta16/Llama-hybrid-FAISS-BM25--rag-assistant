Biography 

McClymont was discovered in 1992, at age eleven, when a family friend heard her sing in front of the mirror at her home and told Brooke's mother that she should put her into the Jacaranda Talent Quest in Grafton. Her mother entered her into the contest and she sang "All I Wanna Do Is Make Love to You" by Heart. In 1999, she sang "God Save the Queen" and "Advance Australia Fair" to open the day-night Australia vs. England cricket match.

Charles Fisher was one of the people McClymont worked with on her debut album and she stated that the two had a really good working relationship. "I Can't Wait" was chosen to be the first song released because McClymont felt it is a really positive song and definitely shows her personality. The song was released as a CD on 17 June 2002 and peaked in the top fifty at number forty-nine. Soon after, the song was again recorded by Hilary Duff for the Disney Channel original series Lizzie McGuire. "I Don't Think, I Know" was the second song released on 2 December 2002 and it also peaked in the top fifty at number forty-five. McClymont stated that she did not get to release her album as certain circumstances arose, it just never happened.

In 2006, McClymont and her two sisters (Samantha and Mollie) started a band named The McClymonts. By 2019 the band had amassed one platinum and two gold records, two ARIA Awards, one APRA Award and thirteen Country Music Awards of Australia ("Golden Guitars").

In 2016, McClymont appeared in her first movie,  Australian romantic comedy Spin Out.

McClymont is married to singer-songwriter Adam Eckersley. They had a daughter in 2013 and a son in 2020.

The duo released the album Adam & Brooke in February 2018 which peaked at number 16 on the ARIA Charts.

In January 2022, McClymont appeared as a contestant on the eighth season of I’m A Celebrity…Get Me Out Of Here! Australia. She finished second, behind winner Dylan Lewis.

On 30 June 2023, McClymont and Eckersley released their second album Up, Down & Sideways.
