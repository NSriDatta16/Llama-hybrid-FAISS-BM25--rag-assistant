The Ski Amadé region of Austria is a network of 28 ski areas and towns that combined, make up the second largest ski area in Europe.  It is named after the composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart who was born in the city of Salzburg.

Background
The resorts are linked by buses. There are 860 km of downhill slopes and 278 modern ski lifts, the highest lift being at the Dachstein Glacier with an altitude of 2,700 m. There are over 700 km of marked cross country Nordic skiing tracks.

Five Regions
The resorts are made up of 28 villages across five principal regions that make up the alliance. The five regions are Salzburger Sportwelt, Dachstein Tauern, Gastein Valley, Hochkönig Ski Area, and Grossarl Valley.

Geography
The ski region stretches from the south-east of Salzburg to the upper Styrian Ennstal, including the impressive mountain ranges of Steinernes Meer, Hochkönig, Dachstein and Tauernkamm.

Being in the Eastern Alps, thus being colder than the Western Alps the region has a good record of snowfall during the winter months.
