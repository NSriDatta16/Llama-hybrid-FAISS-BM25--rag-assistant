Treriksrøysa (Three-Country Cairn) is a cairn which marks the tripoint where the borders between Norway, Finland and Russia meet.  The site is on a hill called Muotkavaara, in Pasvikdalen, west of the Pasvikelva and  southwest of Nyrud just west of Krokfjellet in Sør-Varanger municipality of Finnmark, Norway. It is the only place in Europe where three time zones meet: Central European Time, Eastern European Time and Further-eastern European Time. The tripoint can only be approached by the public from the Norwegian side, since both Finland and Russia maintain extensive border zones where public access is prohibited.
