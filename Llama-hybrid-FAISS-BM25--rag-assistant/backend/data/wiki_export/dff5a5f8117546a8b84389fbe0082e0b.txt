Ali Abdu Ahmed is a former Eritrean politician who left the government and sought asylum abroad. From 2002 until his defection in November 2012, Ali was the Eritrean Minister of Information. 

His father (an Eritrean national), brother, and 15-year-old daughter, a United States citizen, were subsequently detained and have been held indefinitely. The US government inquired regarding his daughter's well-being while the Eritrean government vehemently rejected her status as an US citizen and has refused to release information regarding her whereabouts or well being. Meanwhile, Ali has applied for asylum in Australia.
