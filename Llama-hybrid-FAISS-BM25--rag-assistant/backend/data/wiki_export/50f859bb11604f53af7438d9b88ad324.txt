Erattupetta is a municipal town located in Kottayam district of Kerala state, India. It is located  east of Kottayam, the district capital.    

Erattupetta panchayath was founded in 1964 and upgraded to a municipality in 2015.

The "Eraaru" part in all the variations of the names arose from the geographical location, where the two rivers (aaru) merge as single one and "Petta" means town. Erattupetta is situated in the foothills of High Ranges. Hence the place is also known as "the gateway of High range/Malanadu."

Etymology
The "Eraaru" part in all the variation of the names arose from the geographical location, where the two rivers (aaru) merge as a single one. Erattupetta is situated in the foothills of High Ranges. 'Peta' means town in Dravidian languages. Earlier it was known as 'Erapoli' or 'Erapuzha'. It was the commercial capital of the Poonjar principality until 1949.

Native Peoples
The indigenous population can be broadly divided into three groups.
It includes the base class, the children of the soil - the Hindu sects and the Christian Muslim sects that have converted from them.

Tamil Immigrants - The most important of these were the (Rawther) Khan family Muslims who came from Madurai in Tamil Nadu in the twelfth century along with the Poonjar royal family along with their loyal servants and bodyguards.  The Hindus belonging to the Chetti tribe and the Rawthers who left the country in the 14th century from Tamil areas.  They still speak Malayalam mixed with Tamil. These include the Brahmin families of Tamil Nadu who came from Tamil Nadu and were converted to Christianity by St.Thomas and many Jewish families who came from Tamil Nadu and converted to Christianity.

Malayali Immigrants - Christians who migrated from Kodungallur with the advent of Christianity and Nilakkal in the fourteenth century, Muslims who came from Edappally near Kochi after the advent of Islam, Mehtar sect, and later Muslims from various families who came from Malappuram and Ernakulam districts belong to this category.
Apart from this, there is another sect with roots in Saudi Arabia.  They are the Labbas, descendants of the previously mentioned Shaikh Saeed Bawa.
While the Muslims, who depended on trade in these groups, settled in Eratupetta itself, the Christians moved to the nearby hills in search of fertile farmlands.  Others who were laborers moved to different areas depending on the availability of work.  This is the reason why Eratupetta became a Muslim majority area.
