When You Wish Upon a Chipmunk is a 1995 music album by Alvin and the Chipmunks, released by Sony Wonder, and contains 10 tracks.

The album features the Chipmunks and Chipettes singing Disney songs. A footnote on the back of the CD case stated that The Walt Disney Company neither sponsored nor endorsed the album. However, coincidentally, the home entertainment division Buena Vista Home Video (currently known as Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment) had released several Chipmunks cartoons on home video in the early and mid-1990s.
