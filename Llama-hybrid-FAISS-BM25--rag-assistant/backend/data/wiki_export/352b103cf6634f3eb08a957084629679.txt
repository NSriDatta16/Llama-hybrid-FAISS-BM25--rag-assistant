Verdun Collège Français were a junior ice hockey team from Verdun, Quebec, Canada. They were members of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League from 1991 to 1994. Collège Français resurrected the dormant Quebec Remparts franchise in 1985 after a three-year hiatus, as Longueuil Collège Français. The team played in Longueuil, Quebec at Colisée Jean Béliveau for three seasons  before moving to the Verdun Auditorium.

Led by coach Claude Therien, Verdun finished the 1991–92 regular season first overall winning the Jean Rougeau Trophy with 101 points. Collège Français won all three playoff rounds en route to capturing the President's Cup as league playoff champions. Verdun represented the QMJHL at the 1992 Memorial Cup, finishing fourth place.

The franchise ceased operations after the 1993–94 QMJHL season, and the Collège Français transferred its sponsorship and some management to the Laval Titan. The team's players were assigned to other QMJHL clubs by a dispersal draft. The expansion Halifax Mooseheads claimed top prospect Jean-Sébastien Giguère from the defunct Verdun team.
