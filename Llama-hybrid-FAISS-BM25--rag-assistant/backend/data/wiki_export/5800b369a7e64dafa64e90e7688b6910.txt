Tour Égée (also known as tour Ernst&Young) is an office skyscraper located in La Défense, the high-rise business district situated west of Paris, France.

Tour Égée was built in 1999 by Michel Andrault and Nicolas Ayoub, architects from Conceptua. A twin of Tour Égée, Tour Adria, was built nearby three years later in 2002. The only difference between both towers consists in their cladding: the one from Adria is darker, while the one from Égée is lighter with a glass cladding giving an interesting feeling of vertical and horizontal stripes crossing at the level of each window. Tour Égée is 155 m (509 ft) tall and has a triangular floorplan.
