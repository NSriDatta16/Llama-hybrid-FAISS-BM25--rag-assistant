Fan the Flame (Part 1) is the fifth studio album from English band Dead or Alive, released in 1990. Epic Records released Fan the Flame (Part 1) in Japan only. The album remained an exclusive in this territory until the worldwide release of the Sophisticated Boom Box MMXVI compilation box set in 2016.

The album was a slight change in the band's musical style towards more melancholic lyrics and refined vocals from Burns.  The background vocals on "Total Stranger" were performed by British pop group Londonbeat and the London Community Gospel Choir provided backing vocals for "Unhappy Birthday".

The song "My Love's on the Line" was also recorded for the album and performed live in 1990 but went unreleased. In 2020, the master tape was discovered in Steve Coy's personal collection and the track was released on the Invincible reissue set the following year.

A follow-up album, Fan the Flame (Part 2), also began recording in 1990 but was abandoned until posthumous completion in 2021.

An acoustic album Love, Pete was also made available during a US personal appearance tour in 1992 and was since widely bootlegged with the title Fan the Flame (Part 2): The Acoustic Sessions. Pete strongly criticized its subsequent distribution.

In Japan, they released the singles "Your Sweetness (Is Your Weakness)" (JPN#3), "Unhappy Birthday" (JPN#14) and "Gone 2 Long" (JPN#18). The album peaked at number 27 on the Japanese Albums Chart.
