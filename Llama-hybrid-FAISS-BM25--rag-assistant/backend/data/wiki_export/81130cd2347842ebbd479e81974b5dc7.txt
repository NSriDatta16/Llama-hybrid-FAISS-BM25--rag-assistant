The Inkosi Albert Luthuli International Convention Centre Complex, often abbreviated as ICC Durban, is a large events facility located in the city centre of Durban, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. It is named after 1960 Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former president of the African National Congress, Inkosi Albert Luthuli. Opened by former president Nelson Mandela in 1997, the Durban ICC was South Africa’s first International Convention Centre and has played a pioneering role in attracting international events to Durban since its inception. The complex is composed of an arena, hotel, convention and exhibition centre.

The venue has hosted various high-level conferences and meetings since its inception, namely: the International AIDS Conference in 2000 and again in July 2016; the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1999; and the Non-Aligned Movement in 2004. It hosted the preliminary draw for the 2010 FIFA World Cup and final draw for 2013 African Cup of Nations. It also hosted the COP17 meeting in 2011 and the 5th Global Conference on the Elimination of Child Labour in 2022.

History
Discussions in the city of Durban on the merits of a major convention centre date back to the 1960s. However, planning for the convention centre began in 1991. After consultations by the whites-only municipal authorities with unrepresented political groupings in 1993, construction commenced in 1994. The Convention Centre hosted the 123rd IOC Session where Pyeongchang was elected host city of the 2018 Winter Olympics.

Change of name
It was proposed on 1 February 2006 that the name of the centre be changed from Durban International Convention Centre.
