The Wentworth Senior Masters was a men's professional golf tournament on the European Seniors Tour from 1997 to 2007.

The first tournament was won by multi-major winner Gary Player. It was staged at the Wentworth Club beyond the western fringe of London, which has the headquarters of the PGA European Tour European Seniors Tour Championship, as the Seniors Tour's fixed location tournament.

It was played on the Edinburgh Course. The two European Tour tournaments at the club (the corporate-sponsored PGA Championship and the World Play Championship) were played over the West Course. In 2007 the prize fund was Â£250,000.
