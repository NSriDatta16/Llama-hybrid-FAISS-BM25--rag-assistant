Early life and education
Marquis James was born on August 29, 1891, in Springfield, Missouri, the fifth child and only son of Houstin James (December 18, 1844, Pike Co., Ohio – August 18, 1908, Enid, Oklahoma), a lawyer, and Rachel Leo Marquis (July 14, 1848, Jay Co., Indiana – May 22, 1930, Enid, Oklahoma), a schoolteacher (daughter of Dr. James Marquis and Mary Cosner). Houstin, a Civil War veteran, participated in both the Land run of 1889 and the Land Run of 1893.  While unsuccessful in 1889, Houstin successfully staked a claim southeast of Enid, Oklahoma in the 1893 run and moved his family there. Marquis James was educated at East Hill School and Central, and graduated Enid High School in 1910. He attended one year of college at Oklahoma Christian University (later Phillips University).
