It is located approximately  from Helsinki Central railway station and  from Helsinki Airport.

Tikkurila was one of the first seven railway stations in Finland constructed together with the country's first railway between Helsinki and Hämeenlinna in 1862. It was also the only one apart from the two terminus stations to be built out of brick and not wood. The old station was converted into a museum in the 1970s, and a new, more modern station was built to the north of the old one.
