Bill Carroll (born December 29, 1966 in Wilmington, Delaware) is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, bassist and guitarist. He has been a professional musician since the mid-1980s, and has been a member of the groups No Such Thing, Doubting Thomas, and The Real Underground. As solo artist, he scored a Rate-A-Record appearance on Dick Clark's American Bandstand program on April 2, 1988 with "When We're Apart", shortly after being signed to Hollywood-based Aardvark Records.

Carroll's musical styles have ranged from serious orchestral arrangements (Dune I from 1994's Kohoutek) to television, sitcom, and film scores, with themes like The Mecklenburgers, to what he is best known for: rock and roll power pop. He is heavily influenced by The Beatles, The Who, The Jam, REM, Jellyfish, and less mainstream artists such as Bruce Foxton, Lee Mavers, Kevin Gilbert and John Wetton.

Carroll joined Doubting Thomas as vocalist/bassist in 1997, contributing songs to the band's last two albums, Who Died and Made You King (1998) and their eponymous live recording, Doubting Thomas (1999). He remained with the group until it disbanded in 2001, but as of 2009, Doubting Thomas had reformed for limited performances, and began recording a new album in 2023.

In 2004, Carroll composed and performed the theme for the PBS program The Mecklenburgers. He was nominated for a regional Emmy Award for the song in late 2005. In 2019, he received a Gold Telly Award as part of the international Telly Awards for music he composed for a recycling awareness campaign in Mecklenburg County, NC. He was nominated for another regional Emmy Award in late 2019.

In March 2023, Carroll announced that he was working on an album of new material with co-producer Greg Endy.
