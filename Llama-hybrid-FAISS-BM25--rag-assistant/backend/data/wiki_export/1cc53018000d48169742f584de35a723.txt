Due Drop Events Centre (previously known as the Vodafone Events Centre and TelstraClear Pacific Events Centre) is a multi-purpose event centre located in Manukau, Auckland, New Zealand (suburb of the former Manukau City), with an indoor arena, theatre and meeting halls hosting community, cultural and sports events, concerts and plays, exhibits, trade fairs and expos, corporate functions, meetings, weddings and other special events. Construction of the centre cost an estimated NZ$ 48.7 million, of which somewhat less than half came from the former Manukau City Council.
