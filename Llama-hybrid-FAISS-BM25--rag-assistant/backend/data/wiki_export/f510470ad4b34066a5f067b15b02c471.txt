Carrollton School of the Sacred Heart is a Catholic college preparatory day school for girls, founded in 1961 in Coconut Grove, Miami, Florida.

Description
Carrollton School of the Sacred Heart was founded in 1961. Its oldest building, El Jardin, built in 1918, was donated to the Society of the Sacred Heart by the O’Neil family. The school now resides across two campuses in Coconut Grove, Florida, and still uses El Jardin for classes, along with many other buildings. El Jardin is part of the Barat Campus, named after St. Madeline Sophie Barat, the founding mother of the Sacred Heart. Carrollton has a student population of around 862. 

A member of the Network of Sacred Heart Schools, Carrollton is divided into five independent learning communities or schools: Montessori, Primary, Intermediate, Junior High and High School.

Carrollton has a nationally recognized debate and robotics team. In 2007, the school hosted a national robotics competition. Its athletic mascot is the Carrollton Cyclone.

In 2023, Carrollton was ranked the #1 Catholic and All-Girls High School in Florida.

History
In 2019, the school had plans to build an elementary school for boys on the property of Villa Woodbine, which prompted complaints from area residents.
