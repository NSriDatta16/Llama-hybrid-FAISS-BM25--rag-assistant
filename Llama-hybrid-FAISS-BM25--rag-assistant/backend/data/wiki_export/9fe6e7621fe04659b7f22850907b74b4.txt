Domaine de Maizerets
Le Domaine de Maizerets is a 27-hectare park owned by the Commission de la Capitale Nationale du Québec. The park is operated and maintained by the Société du domaine Maizerets, a non-profit organization that was mandated to that effect.

The park offers 11 kilometers of walking trails. Bird watchers and locals frequently visit the park for its beautiful oasis of nature, which is located inside an urban area. The park features an arboretum which was created in 1997 and replaces a vacant lot formerly used as a snow dumping site in the winter. The Arboretum has been recognized as one of the province of Québec's 20 most beautiful gardens.

In winter, the park is accessible for skiers and offers ice skating and trails for snowshoeing.

The park has several buildings, one of which is the Château Ango des Maizerets, an 18th-century mansion built by the French, as well as a modern observation tower overlooking the Saint Lawrence River.

The stone barn and the Château are two of the oldest buildings in the borough, and both  are classified as patrimonial heritage by the City of Québec.

Access to the park is free and is regulated by the Quebec City by-laws.
