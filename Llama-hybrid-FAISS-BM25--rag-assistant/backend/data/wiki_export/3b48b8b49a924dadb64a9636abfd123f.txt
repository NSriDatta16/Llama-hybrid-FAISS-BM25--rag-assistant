Moreau Catholic High School is a college preparatory Roman Catholic secondary school sponsored by the Moreau Province of the Congregation of Holy Cross. It is located in Hayward, California, within the Roman Catholic Diocese of Oakland under the care of Michael C. Barber, the Bishop of Oakland. It opened in 1965 as an all-boys Catholic High School, temporarily located on the parish grounds of St. Bede's Church. That same year, construction of the permanent campus began at the current location. That construction was completed in the spring of 1967. At the request of Bishop Floyd Begin, Moreau became a coeducational institution in 1969, with the admission of 177 ninth grade girls. Moreau has twice been named a Blue Ribbon School.

School History 
Moreau Catholic High School opened its doors in 1965 to a class of 103 ninth grade boys. In 1969, as the only Catholic high school serving the Southern Alameda County, the school became co-educational. The high school was constructed with financial and community support from the members of the Diocese of Oakland, the late Bishop Floyd L. Begin and the Brothers of Holy Cross, South-West province. It is the only school to be named after Blessed Basil Moreau.

In addition to its strong commitment to providing young men and women with a quality education that is firmly rooted in the Christian values, Moreau Catholic has twice earned national recognition for academic excellence as a Blue Ribbon School by the United States Department of Education and the Council for American Private education.
