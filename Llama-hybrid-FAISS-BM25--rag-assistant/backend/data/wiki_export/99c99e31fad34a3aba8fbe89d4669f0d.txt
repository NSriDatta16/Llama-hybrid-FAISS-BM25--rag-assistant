Groß-Zimmern is a municipality in the district of Darmstadt-Dieburg, in Hessen, Germany. It is situated  east of Darmstadt and right next to Dieburg.

In 1846, over 700 town residents emigrated in the Great Migration to New York City.  The town paid for the passage of 674 passengers and about 100 more paid their own way.  The emigrants sailed on at least five ships – the Atlas (46%), the Sardinia (37%), the Manchester (6%), the Montezuma (7%), and the Pontiac (6%). 425 of the emigrants had no funds or food when they landed in New York city and entered the Bellevue Almshouse which overloaded the capacity of the Almshouse.  New York City petitioned the US Congress to pass laws that would prevent the arrival of paupers on overcrowded ships to the United States.
