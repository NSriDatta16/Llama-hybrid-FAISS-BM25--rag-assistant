Prince Qing of the First Rank (Manchu: ; hošoi fengšen cin wang), or simply Prince Qing, was the title of a princely peerage used in China during the Manchu-led Qing dynasty (1636–1912). It was also one of the 12 "iron-cap" princely peerages in the Qing dynasty, which meant that the title could be passed down without being downgraded.

The first bearer of the title was Yonglin (1766–1820), the 17th son of the Qianlong Emperor. He was awarded the title by his 15th brother, the Jiaqing Emperor, who succeeded their father. Between 1820 and 1908, the Prince Qing title was capped at a junwang (prince of the second rank) status, which meant that the next bearer of the title would inherit, at most, the title "Prince Qing of the Second Rank". However, from 1908 onwards, the title was accorded a qinwang (prince of the first rank) status. The title was passed down over four generations and held by five princes – three qinwangs and two junwangs.

 Yonglin (1766–1820), the Qianlong Emperor's 17th son, initially a beile from 1789 to 1799, promoted to Prince Qing of the Second Rank in 1799 and then to Prince Qing of the First Rank in 1820, posthumously honoured as Prince Qingxi of the First Rank (慶僖親王)
 Mianmin (綿愍; 1797–1836), Yonglin's third son, held a feng'en fuguo gong title from 1802 to 1819 and a beizi title from 1819 to 1820, held the title Prince Qing of the Second Rank from 1820 to 1836, posthumously honoured as Prince Qingliang of the Second Rank (慶良郡王)

 Mianxing (綿性; 1814–1879), Yonglin's sixth son, held the title of a second class zhenguo jiangjun from 1833 to 1837 and the title of a buru bafen fuguo gong from 1837 to 1842, stripped of his title in 1842

In 1884, he was made Prince Qing of the Second Rank, and was subsequently promoted to Prince Qing of the First Rank in 1894. In 1908, the Prince Qing title was given "iron-cap" status, which meant that the next bearer would be a qinwang (first-rank prince) by default. He was posthumously honoured as Prince Qingmi of the First Rank (慶密親王).
