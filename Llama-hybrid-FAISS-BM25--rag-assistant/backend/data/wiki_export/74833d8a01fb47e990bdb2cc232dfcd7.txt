Biography
Lorson was born and raised in the suburbs of New York City and formed Madder Rose with Billy Coté in 1991 in Greenwich Village. When Madder Rose disbanded in 1999 she founded Saint Low with bassist Stahl Caso, violinist Joe Myer, pianist Michael Stark, vocalist Jennie Stearns, and drummer Zaun Marshburn. Lorson and Coté toured with Tanya Donelly from 1996-7.

Lorson and Coté have collaborated on film scores including the original score for "What Remains: The Life and Art of Sally Mann" for Steven Cantor and HBO. She and Coté have a son, Roman. A breast cancer survivor and high school English teacher, Lorson is the author of "Freak Baby and the Kill Thought," an original screenplay about the life of vaudeville singer and actress Eva Tanguay. The album "BurnBabyBurn," released by Mary Lorson & the Soubrettes in 2011, features a version of Tanguay's 1922 song "I Don't Care."

Lorson's projects also have included developing a television series, "Old School"; scoring the independent web series "The Chanticleer"; a multimedia performance memoir, "Signal"; and setting a chapter of James Joyce's Finnegans Wake to music, for the Waywords and Meansigns project. Her 11th full-length album, "Themes From Whatever," was released in November 2017.
