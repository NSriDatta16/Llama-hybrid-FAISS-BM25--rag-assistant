Yahya (), also spelled Yehya, is an Arabic male given name. 
According to the Qur'anic narrative, it is an Arabic form of the given name John, originally Hebrew Yohanan (Yəhôḥānān
יְהוֹחָנָן‎  "Yahu is gracious"), i.e. primarily John the Baptist, who is known as
Yahya ibn Zakariyya in Islam, and is considered a prophet in Islam. For this reason, Yahya is a comparatively common name in the Muslim world. 
The related Biblical name of Jehiah (Yᵊḥîyâ יְחִיָּה "Yahu lives") has the Arabic form Yaḥiyyā ., having the same Arabic consonantal text as the name Yahya does.

In Persian, Yahya is a title of address for a senior village or community elder. It is also a common nickname for the 12th Imam.
