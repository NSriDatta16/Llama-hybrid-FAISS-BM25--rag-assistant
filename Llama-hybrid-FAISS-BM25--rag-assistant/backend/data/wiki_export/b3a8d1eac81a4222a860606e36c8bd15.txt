The Swedish Union for Service and Communications Employees (, SEKO) is a trade union in Sweden.

History
The union was founded on 14 May 1970, as the Swedish National Union of State Employees (SF).  It resulted from the merger of eight unions:

 Employees' Union of State Power Stations
 Swedish Civil Administration's Employees' Union
 Swedish Defence Forces Civilian Employees' Union
 Swedish Post Union
 Swedish Prison Employees' Union

Like all its predecessors, the union affiliated to the Swedish Trade Union Confederation.  On formation, it had 145,350 members, and it grew to 161,794 in 1986.  The National Association of Civil Servants in Prisons split away in 1973.

In 1995, the union became SEKO.  The following year, the Swedish Sailors' Union merged in, then in 1997 the Swedish Association of Engine Drivers split away.  By 2019, it had a membership of 70,818.
