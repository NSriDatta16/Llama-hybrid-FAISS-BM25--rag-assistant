Early years

National Football League

Houston Texans 
Ryans was selected with the first pick of the second round (33rd overall) in the 2006 NFL Draft by the Texans. He was the highest-selected Alabama linebacker since Dwayne Rudd was drafted 20th overall by the Minnesota Vikings in 1997. Though Ryans had been an outside linebacker in college, he earned the starting middle linebacker position due to his excellent performance in the preseason. In his first game, Ryans recorded a league-high 12 solo tackles against the Philadelphia Eagles. He had an overwhelming impact as a rookie linebacker for the Texans, leading the team in tackles in the first half of the 2006 season. He was named AFC Defensive Player of the Week for his Week 13 game against the Oakland Raiders.

Ryans was named the AP NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year after finishing second in the league with 155 total tackles (Zach Thomas 165), 31 more tackles than the next rookie (Detroit Lions linebacker Ernie Sims). He was named to the NFL All-Rookie Team. In 2007, Ryans was named a first-team All-Pro linebacker and was selected to the Pro Bowl twice in 2007 and 2009.

On March 30, 2010, Ryans signed a six-year extension worth $48 million, including $21.75 million guaranteed.

Philadelphia Eagles
On March 20, 2012, Ryans was traded to the Philadelphia Eagles in exchange for a 2012 fourth-round draft pick (used on Ben Jones) and a swap of third-round picks between the two teams (used on Brandon Brooks and Nick Foles). Ryans was immediately inserted as the team's starting middle linebacker. Although the Eagles were 4–12, Ryans still made plays, leading the team in tackles with 113 while adding a sack and interception.

In 2013, Ryans improved even further, leading the team in tackles once more with 127, while also recording career highs in sacks (4.0), interceptions (2), and interception return yardage (46). On January 4, 2014, he had 10 tackles and his first career playoff interception in his first playoff game with the Eagles, a close 26–24 loss to the New Orleans Saints. On November 3, 2014, Ryans was placed on injured reserve after tearing his Achilles tendon.

Ryans was released on February 24, 2016.

San Francisco 49ers
On February 28, 2017, Ryans was hired by the San Francisco 49ers as a defensive quality control coach. In 2018, he was promoted to inside linebackers coach. On January 18, 2021, Ryans was promoted to defensive coordinator following the departure of Robert Saleh, who left to become the head coach of the New York Jets.

Following a successful postseason for the 49ers defense, Ryans was interviewed for the head coaching vacancy at the Minnesota Vikings, but declined a second interview and opted to remain with the 49ers.

In 2022, Ryans' unit finished as the top defense in football by DVOA, second by weighted DVOA, fifth against the pass, and second against the rush. As a result, Ryans was named as the PFWA Assistant Coach of the Year.

On January 31, 2023, Ryans was announced as the next head coach of the Houston Texans, the same franchise he originally started his professional NFL career for, after signing a six-year contract. He is the third head coach hired in the last three offseasons by the Texans.
