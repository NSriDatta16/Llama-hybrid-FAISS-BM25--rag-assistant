Gingell or Gyngell is a last name of English origin from the county of Wiltshire, in the west country of England.

The name is probably of Anglo-Saxon origin, from one of the estimated seven to ten thousand villages and hamlets that have disappeared in Britain. The placename itself may mean "Ginge Dale" or "the hill or valley of the people of Gaeging", from the personal name derived from the Old English pre 7th-century "gaegan", to turn aside, and the Old English "hyll", a hill, or the Old English "dael", valley. The first recorded spelling of the family name is shown to be that of Michael de Gingedale, which was dated 1273, in the "Hundred Rolls of Wiltshire", during the reign of King Edward 1, 1272–1307.
