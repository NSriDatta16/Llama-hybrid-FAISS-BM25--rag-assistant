The Ultimate Anthology is a compilation album by pop group Bucks Fizz.

Released in 2005, this album was significant in that it was the first release that contained all of Bucks Fizz's 20 hit singles together on one disc. The album was released by Sony/BMG in conjunction with Fat Dog Productions - who were a fan-based team of producers who later went on to produce The Lost Masters collections.

Many of the tracks on the album differed from the original 7" versions in that they featured a 'dead-end' rather than a fade-out. These recordings were produced at the time for television promotional appearances by the group. The album came with a Bonus disc of rare tracks and previously unreleased remixes.

In a review, Music Week said that among a number of Bucks Fizz compilations, this was "undeniably the best".
