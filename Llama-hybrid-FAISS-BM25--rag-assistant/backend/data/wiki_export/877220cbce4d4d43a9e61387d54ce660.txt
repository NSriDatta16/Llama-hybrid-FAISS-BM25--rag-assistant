Sarki/Mijar () is an occupational caste in Nepal traditionally belonging to leather workers. They are found in the region of the Himalayas, Nepal, across the hills of Darjeeling & Kalimpong and in Terai area of Dooars. They are experts in playing their musical instrument "Madal" and performing dance in a group which is also called “Khayali Marooni”. According to the 2021 Nepal census, Sarki makes up 1.55% of Nepal's population (452,229 people). 
Sarki are referred to in the Nepali and Thakali languages.

Due to many caste-based discriminations in Nepal, the government of Nepal legally abolished the caste-system and criminalized any caste-based discrimination, including "untouchability" (the ostracism of a specific caste) - in the year 1963 A.D. With Nepal's step towards freedom and equality, Nepal, previously ruled by a Hindu monarchy, was a Hindu nation which has now become a secular state, and on 28 May 2008, it was declared a republic, ending it as a Hindu Kingdom

The 1854 Nepalese Muluki Ain (Legal Code) categorized Sarki as a category. Sarki is categorized under "Hill Dalit" among the 9 broad social groups, along with Damai, Badi, Kami and Gaine by the Government of Nepal.
