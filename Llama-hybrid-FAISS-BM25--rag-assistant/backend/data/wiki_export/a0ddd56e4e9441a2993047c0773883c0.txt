Folden is a former municipality in Nordland county, Norway.  The  municipality existed from 1838 until its dissolution in 1887.  Folden encompassed all of the areas surrounding the Folda fjord and all of the fjord branches that connect to the main fjord. It included all the areas in what is now Sørfold Municipality, plus the Kjerringøy area of Bodø Municipality, and the southeastern part of the Steigen Municipality.

History
The municipality of Folden was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt).  The municipality existed until 1 January 1887, when it was divided into two new municipalities: Nordfold-Kjerringøy and Sørfold.  Before the partition, Folden had a population of 3,293.

Name
The municipality is named after the local Folda fjord (). The name is derived from the word  which probably means "broad" or "wide" referring to the width of the fjord. The outer part of the fjord is usually what is referred to as the Folda fjord, while the inner part of the fjord is divided into two arms Nordfolda ("the northern Folda") and Sørfolda ("the southern Folda").

Government
During its existence, this municipality was governed by a municipal council of elected representatives, which in turn elected a mayor.
