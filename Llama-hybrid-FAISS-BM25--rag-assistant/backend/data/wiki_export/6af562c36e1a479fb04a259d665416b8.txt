Drew Z. Greenberg is an American television producer and writer best known for working on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Smallville, The O.C., Dexter, Warehouse 13, Arrow and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. He has also written some comic books, like Green Arrow and Buffy the Vampire Slayer comics.

Personal life
Greenberg is openly gay, and is proud to work homosexual characters into his scripts. "I’ve never written an original pilot script that didn’t have at least one gay character in it, even if I was the only one who knew that character was going to be gay. Sure, telling stories about gays and lesbians has been a priority for me."

In 2022, Greenberg joined current and past Disney employees who criticized Bob Chapek for refusing to criticize anti-LGBT legislation that was passed in Florida.
