Colin "Popeye" Doyle (born September 8, 1977) is a Canadian former professional lacrosse player and captain for the Toronto Rock of the National Lacrosse League and the Six Nations Chiefs of Major Series Lacrosse.

National Lacrosse League (NLL) career
Doyle was born in Kitchener, Ontario. He began his NLL career in 1998, playing for Ontario Raiders. He scored 34 goals and 27 assists, leading the Raiders in scoring. He was named NLL Rookie of the Year.

In 1999, the Raiders moved to Toronto, becoming the Toronto Rock, where they won their first of 6 NLL Championships. Doyle finished first or second in Rock scoring every year from 1999 until 2005, and was named league MVP in 2005. He has been named playoff MVP an unprecedented three times â€” in 1999, 2002, and 2005.

On December 27, 2006, the Rock traded Doyle, Darren Halls, and a draft pick to the San Jose Stealth for Ryan Benesch, Kevin Fines, Chad Thompson, and two draft picks.

Just after the 2009 season began, Doyle was named by Paul Tutka of NLLInsider.com as the top player in the league, stating that Doyle "has become today's most stellar offensive leader, creating a relationship with Jeff Zywicki that is turning out to be one of the most lethal in the NLL." Tutka also praised Doyle's commitment to his teammates: 

Doyle was named a starter to the All-Star Game in both 2009 and 2012.

On December 14, 2009, almost three years after they traded him away, the Rock re-acquired Doyle from the Stealth for Lewis Ratcliff, Tyler Codron, and Joel Dalgarno.

On November 9, 2016, Doyle announced his retirement from lacrosse.
