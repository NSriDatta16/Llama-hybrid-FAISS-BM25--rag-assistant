Transform  is the sixth studio album by Christian pop and rock singer Rebecca St. James. It was released on 24 October 2000 and debuted at No. 166 on the Billboard 200. The album spawned two singles, "Wait for Me" and "Reborn".

Background

Writing and development 

Like her previous albums, Rebecca co-wrote the majority of the album, with the exception of "One" and "In Me". "For the Love of God" was written after Rebecca attended a missions trip to Romania, while the song "Reborn" was written about a friend coming to know Christ. Rebecca stated that "To see the joy and excitement in her new 'reborn' life is beautiful." Rebecca commented on the meaning of "Don't Worry" by saying "I am really quite a dramatic person and this song is a drama, a story, that challenges me to truly give things to God and not 'take them back' by worrying." "Merciful" was inspired by a book titled The Mitford Years, while "Universe" was penned after she took a walk by a creek next to her house, in which she was inspired of God's love.

The song "Wait for Me", a track about sexual purity, was solely written by St. James. It has become one of her staple songs, being featured on every compilation album released by the singer to date. Rebecca talked about the song, saying "The idea for this song came from letters that I have written to my future husband, that I will one day give to him. I sing it not just to him but on behalf of young women today, encouraging the future husbands of our generation to stay sexually pure, to wait for us." "Stand" was written in the Pontiac Silverdome, and "Lean On" was penned with the band Earthsuit. Rebecca described "My Hope" as "a worship song that points to Jesus as the Hope for us all."

The album was chiefly produced by Matt Bronleewe, who produced eight out of the thirteen tracks, including "Reborn", "Don't Worry", and "For the Love of God". Frequent Rebecca St. James collaborator Tedd T. produced the songs "Wait for Me" and "Universe". Other producers who worked on the album were Dann Huff and Pete Kipley. The album's strings were performed by The London Sessions Orchestra and The Love Sponge String Quartet. Rebecca described the process by saying, "Recording the strings with the London Sessions Orchestra... was a moving experience that I will never forget." A song called "Vision" that was featured on a pre-release of the album was taken off for unknown reasons. It is a very rare song and extremely hard to find.

Music structure and lyrics 

Transform has a more electronic drive to the album. Songs such as "For the Love of God" and "Merciful" are rock-driven songs backed by string arrangements, while "Reborn" is a dance-groove track. "One", "Wait for Me", and "All Around Me" all offer different outlooks on the album as well, with funk, pop, and rock respectively. Lyrical content includes topics on salvation, worrying, unity, hope, and sexual purity.

Release and reception

Critical reception 

Transform received generally positive reviews from critics. Jesus Freak Hideout gave the album 3.5 out of 5 stars, saying the album "marks yet another step and progression for Rebecca", while Christianity Today said "This is easily Rebecca's biggest, most dramatic, and most mature production to date." AllMusic also enjoyed the album saying "Transform has textured production, Top 40 resonance and inspiring lyrics".
