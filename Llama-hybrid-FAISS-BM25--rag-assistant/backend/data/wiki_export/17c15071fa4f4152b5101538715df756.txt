Critical reception

The New York Times wrote: "Guitar riffs like corkscrews, like barbed wire, like punching bags and like trampolines animate the music of That Petrol Emotion, a five-man Irish band with a fiercely defiant streak." The Philadelphia Inquirer noted that the "abrasiveness is held in check by strong guitar playing and clear melodies." The Vancouver Sun called "Big Decision" "one of the year's great singles."

The Los Angeles Times determined that, "though characterized by stun guitar, howling vocals and brutal beats, the album always keeps you on your toes with an eclectic though unrefined array of styles." The Washington Post deemed it "a fierce yet tuneful postpunk landmark." The Gazette concluded that "this is about being alive in Northern Ireland, and it's no day on the beach... Bracing stuff." The Windsor Star listed it among the best albums of 1987.

MusicHound Rock: The Essential Album Guide praised the "smart, angry songs" and "eclectic sound."
