The Panorama Mesdag is housed in different premises within walking distance from The Mesdag Collection.

History 
In 1887, Hendrik Willem Mesdag and Sina Van Houten finished construction on a building next to their house to serve as a museum for their art collection. In 1903, Hendrik Mesdag donated the museum to the Netherlands. After Henrik Mesdag's death in 1915, parts of his private collection were sold. 

In 1990, the museum came under the management of the Van Gogh Museum. From 2011 to 2015, the Van Gogh Museum and the Netherlands Institute for Art History researched and digitized the Mesdags' original art collection, the current Mesdag collection, and Henrik Mesdag's letters.
