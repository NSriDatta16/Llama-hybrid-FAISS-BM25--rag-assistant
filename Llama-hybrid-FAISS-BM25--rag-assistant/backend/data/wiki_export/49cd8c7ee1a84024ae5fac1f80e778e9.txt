Luckily enough, something happened a day later ...”  Pagan was sacked as senior coach of Carlton and Brett Ratten took the reins, “Ratts straight away came up to me, because he’d heard what had happened and a few of the boys had too He said: ‘I’m going to play you every game for the rest of the season”.
