The Juno Awards of 1973, representing Canadian music industry achievements of the previous year, were awarded on 12 March 1973 in Toronto at a ceremony at the Inn on the Park's Centennial ballroom. Approximately 1500 people attended this event which was hosted by George Wilson of CFRB radio.

David Crombie, Toronto's mayor at that time, presented the Best Male Vocalist award to Stompin' Tom Connors. Gordon Lightfoot also made his first personal appearance at the Junos.

An associated music industry conference known as Communication 6 was held from 10 March and concluded with the Juno Award ceremonies.
