Politics 
Following Stephane Dion's resignation, Marissen supported Michael Ignatieff for Liberal Party leader. Ignatieff was confirmed as Leader at a national convention in Vancouver in late April 2009. In the most recent federal Liberal leadership contest, Marissen was campaign manager for George Takach for Liberal Party leader. After Takach withdrew from the contest, Marissen joined him in supporting Justin Trudeau.

In 2017-2018, Marissen served as strategist for Michael Lee's campaign for the leadership of the BC Liberal Party, where Lee was 30 points short from being on the final ballot.

Marissen was a candidate for mayor of Vancouver in the 2022 election, nominated by Progress Vancouver. He placed fourth with 3.47% of the vote. In July 2023, he and all other Progress Vancouver candidates were disqualified from running in a local election until after the 2026 general local elections for failing to meet campaign financing disclosure requirements.
