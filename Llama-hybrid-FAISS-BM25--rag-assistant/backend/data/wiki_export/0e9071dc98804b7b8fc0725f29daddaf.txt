European Psychologist is a quarterly peer-reviewed academic journal within the field of psychology. The journal was established in 1996 as the official organ of the European Federation of Psychologists' Associations, and is published by Hogrefe Publishing.

European Psychologist seeks to integrate across all specializations in psychology and to provide a general platform for communication and cooperation among psychologists throughout Europe and worldwide. Integrative articles and reviews constitute the core material published in the journal. These state-of-the-art papers cover research trends and developments within psychology, with possible reference to European perceptions or fields of specialization. Empirical articles will be considered only in rare circumstances when they present findings from major multinational, multidisciplinary or longitudinal studies, or present results with markedly wide relevance.
