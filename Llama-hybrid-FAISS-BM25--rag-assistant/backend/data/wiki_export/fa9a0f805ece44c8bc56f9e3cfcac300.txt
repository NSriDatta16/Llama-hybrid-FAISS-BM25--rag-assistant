Peter Richens was a British screenwriter. Richens is perhaps best known as the writing partner of Peter Richardson, writer/director/star of the long-running TV series The Comic Strip Presents.

Biography
In Richens's own words, Richardson was "the boss" of the script, with Richens acting as a "mechanic" who was "paid to make these ideas work." His talent for shaping a script was honed in the early days of The Comic Strip stage performances, where he would transcribe the best of the performer's improvisations and create a coherent narrative from them.  He also acted as associate director on Comic Strip productions, and enjoyed the occasional cameo role, notably as a cheerful depressive in Gregory: Diary of a Nutcase.

Death
Richens died at the age of 65. No cause of death was immediately announced.
