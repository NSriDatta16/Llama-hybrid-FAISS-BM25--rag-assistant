Jeonggang of Silla (c.863–887) (r. 886–887) was the 50th ruler of the Korean kingdom of Silla.  He was the son of King Gyeongmun; his siblings included his predecessor King Heongang and his successor Queen Jinseong.

Jeonggang rose to the throne when his brother Heongang died without an heir.  Jeonggang died in turn less than two years later.  In his final year, he put down the rebellion of Kim Yo.

The tomb of King Jeonggang lies to the southeast of Borisa in Gyeongju.
