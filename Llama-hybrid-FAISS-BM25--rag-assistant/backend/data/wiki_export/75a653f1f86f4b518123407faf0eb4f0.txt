Wassougna Souleymanou Hamidou (born 22 November 1973) is a Cameroonian former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper.

International career
He was a member of the Cameroonian 2006 African Nations Cup team, who exited in the quarter-finals. He was again called up to the Cameroon squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, where he was starting goalkeeper for the three group matches played. This was considered a surprise, because he was selected by Paul Le Guen for this match over the expected keeper, Idriss Carlos Kameni. Cameroon lost all three of the group matches and thus did not qualify to move on to the knockout stage of the competition.

He was part of the victorious 2000 African Cup of Nations squad.
