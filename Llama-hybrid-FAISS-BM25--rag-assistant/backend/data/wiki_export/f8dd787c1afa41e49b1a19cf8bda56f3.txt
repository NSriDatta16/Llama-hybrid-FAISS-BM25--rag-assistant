The McNaughton Park Trail Runs, over distances of 50, 100, 150 and , is an annual ultramarathon running event held in Pekin, Illinois each spring on a rugged, ten-mile (16 km) loop course.  All four races are run concurrently. The 150 and  ultra are the only ones of that distance held in Illinois.

The loop course is primarily a single lane footpath, through natural countryside including forests and meadows. Each ten-mile (16 km) loop provides approximately  of elevation gain.

A thirty-mile run, part of the event through 2006, was replaced by a  option beginning in 2007.
