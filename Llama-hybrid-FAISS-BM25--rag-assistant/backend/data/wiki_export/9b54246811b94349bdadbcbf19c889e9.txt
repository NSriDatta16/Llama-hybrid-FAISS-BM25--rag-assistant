During the 1950s, the site was the home of Orenda Engines Limited and was used in the development of the Iroquois jet engine for the Avro Arrow fighter aircraft. The site was purchased by a group of private investors from DeHavilland in 1971, which led to the development of its present use today, as a major multi-purpose facility.
