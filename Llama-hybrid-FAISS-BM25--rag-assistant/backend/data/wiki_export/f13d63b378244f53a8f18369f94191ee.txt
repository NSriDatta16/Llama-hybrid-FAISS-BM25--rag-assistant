History

In 1986 the Intel Corporation closed their subsidiary called Intel (Barbados) Ltd. the company was involved in microprocessor manufacturing at the building. The move displaced about 1,000 workers and placed pressure on the Government of Barbados to make further use of the facility. Sometime after the Sheraton Mall opened and over the years as popularity grew the mall has continued to build onto the original building structure.

On the afternoon of December 30, 2004, a fire began at the Sheraton Centre, as it was then known. One firefighter was injured and the western side of the mall was severely damaged.

For the year 2009 the mall began celebrations of its twentieth anniversary.
