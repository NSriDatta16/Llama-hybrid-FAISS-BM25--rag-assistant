Richard Stanley Kayne is Professor of Linguistics in the Linguistics Department at New York University.

Born in 1944, after receiving an A.B. in mathematics from Columbia College, New York City in 1964, he studied linguistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, receiving his Ph.D. in 1969. He then taught at the University of Paris VIII (1969–1986), MIT (1986–1988) and the City University of New York (1988–1997), becoming Professor at New York University in 1997.

He has made prominent contributions to the study of the syntax of English and the Romance languages   within the framework of transformational grammar. His theory of Antisymmetry has become part of the canon of the Minimalist syntax literature.
