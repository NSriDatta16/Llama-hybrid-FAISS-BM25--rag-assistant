Godere is a woreda in Gambela Region, Ethiopia. Part of the Mezhenger Zone, Godere is bordered on the south and east by the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region (SNNPR), and on the west by Mengesh. The largest town in Godere is Meti.

Overview 
Godere encompasses the headwaters of the Gilo River, thus its terrain is predominantly hilly, unlike the rest of Gambela. According to the Atlas of the Ethiopian Rural Economy published by the Central Statistical Agency (CSA), this woreda has an average elevation of between 500 and 1000 meters with an average slope between 2 and 4%; over 40% of the area is covered with forest.

The economy of Godere is predominantly agricultural. There are no agricultural cooperatives, no documented roads, and little other infrastructure.

History 
At the start of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, Godere was the only woreda of the Administrative Zone 4 and thus considered a Special woreda; however between 1994 and 2001 Godere was made part of the Administrative Zone 2. Subsequently, but before 2007, a number of kebeles were split off to create Mengesh; both woredas became the Mezhenger Zone.

A 2002 United Nations Emergency Unit for Ethiopia assessment report mentions increasing conflict between the Mezhenger and Sheko in the neighboring Yeki woreda of the SNNPR, which spilled over into Godere.
