History
The April 1981 announcement of the Stockholm Sweden Temple was received with virtually no opposition. There were numerous sites explored for the building of the temple, but the one decided upon by church leaders was in Västerhaninge in Haninge Municipality, just south of Stockholm. Municipal officials and merchants welcomed the temple project, and later the Municipality showed further support by changing the name of the street on which the temple is located to Tempelvägen ("The Temple Road"). The Stockholm Sweden Temple was dedicated by Gordon B. Hinckley on July 2, 1985.

On July 29, 1988, an explosion, caused by a bomb placed outside the temple, caused minor damage to a side door of the structure. In 2020, like all the church's other temples, the Stockholm Sweden Temple was closed in response to the coronavirus pandemic.
