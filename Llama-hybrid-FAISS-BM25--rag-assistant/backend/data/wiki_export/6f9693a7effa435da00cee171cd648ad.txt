Release and reception 
Jana was released on 1 May 2004. Visual Dasan of Kalki called it a comforting victory film for Ajith. Indiaglitz called it "a complete rehash of Rajini starrer Baasha" and that it "is completely out of sorts movie". Behindwoods wrote "Jana is nothing new except a different on screen looks of Ajith." Sify wrote "Neither great nor ghastly Jana packs in a sting but ends with a whimper and is strictly for the no-holds barred Ajith addicts." Malathi Rangarajan of The Hindu wrote, "A little of Nayakan and a lot of Badshah peppered with some originality in screenplay, a ravishing heroine and an invincible hero make up this summer cocktail".
