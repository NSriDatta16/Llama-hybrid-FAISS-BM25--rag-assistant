Club career

Brøndby IF 
Born in Nørre Alslev, Kamper made his senior debut for Brøndby IF in the 2002–03 Danish Superliga season which ended with a runners-up silver medal. He was also a part of the Brøndby team which won the 2003 Danish Cup. The following two years, Kamper missed only three league matches, as he scored 11 goals in 63 league matches, and Kamper was a constant part of the Brøndby team during the 2004–05 Danish Superliga championship winning season. He completed the Double with the team, as Brøndby also won the 2005 Danish Cup. With the arrival of new signings Danish international player Thomas Rasmussen and Swedish international player Martin Ericsson, Kamper faced stiff competition for a place in the starting line-up in the 2005–06 Danish Superliga season. He played only 19 of 33 games that season.

Arminia Bielefeld 
In the summer of 2006, Kamper moved abroad to play for Arminia Bielefeld in the German Bundesliga championship. In September 2006, Kamper scored his first Bielefeld goal on a free kick, to win the match against defending Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich 2–1. He scored six goals in 29 games during his first Bundesliga season. In March 2009, Kamper suffered an injury, and spent two months in recovery. He returned to the team for the last two games of the season, but could not prevent Bielefeld from being relegated to the German 2. Bundesliga. Under new Bielefeld coach Thomas Gerstner, Kamper found himself far from the starting line-up. He played only six games during the 2009–10 season, as Bielefeld finished in sixth place, and he was released from the club at the end of his contract.

Randers FC 
On 3 July 2010, Kamper signed a three-year contract with Randers FC.

Viborg 
On 11 June 2015, Kamper signed a one-year contract with Viborg FF. On 1 April 2016, he extended his contract to June 2018.

International career
He represented the Denmark under-21 national team in the UEFA U-21 Championship 2006 tournament in May 2006, where he earned his record 39th cap for the under-21 national team. He was called up for the Denmark national football team in November 2006 following good displays for Bielefeld, and made his debut against the Czech Republic, although he played no games for the national team afterwards.

Coaching and later career
After retiring in the summer 2018, Kamper began working as a insurer in an insurance company. A year later, in April 2019, he was hired as a sponsor salesman at his former club Randers FC, where he also helped the youth teams out in training sessions once in a while. He resigned from the position on 27 July 2021, because he wanted to start a coaching career.

Later on the same day, 27 July 2021, Kamper was announced as Kolding IF's new U-19 head coach.
