"She Wants to Be Me" is a song by British pop punk band Busted, co-written with the record production team The Matrix. It was first included on their second album A Present for Everyone in November 2003. A year later it was released as a limited edition single, one week later than planned, but because the format was a 3-inch CD it was not eligible to chart.

Busted performed the song on CD:UK in October 2004. A live version was included on both the single and the live album A Ticket for Everyone.
