Ketazolam (marketed under the brand names Anseren, Ansieten, Ansietil, Marcen, Sedatival, Sedotime, Solatran and Unakalm) is a drug which is a benzodiazepine derivative. It possesses anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant properties.

Therapeutic uses
It is used for the treatment of anxiety and has similar effectiveness compared to diazepam. Ketazolam also appears to produce reduced levels of side effects such as sedation compared with diazepam and the side effects when they occur tend to be milder. Ketazolam is also an effective antispasmodic drug and is used for the treatment of spasticity.
