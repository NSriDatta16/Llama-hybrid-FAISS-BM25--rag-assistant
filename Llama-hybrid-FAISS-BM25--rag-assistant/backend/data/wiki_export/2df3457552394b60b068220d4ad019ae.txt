Delview Secondary is a public high school in Delta, British Columbia, Canada. It is managed by the School District 37 Delta. The school mascot is a Raider, reflecting the Scandinavian roots in the school's area, when Norse settlers came to the Annieville area. Delview's school colours are black, white and red. The school currently educates just under 700 students under principal Kevin Vasconcelos.

History
The school was established in 1969, with the first Principal Ernie Marshall combining the names "Delta" and "Riverview" to make Delview. That September, the school opened, sharing premises at North Delta Secondary School. In February 1970, the school moved to its permanent site at 116th Street with a budget of $130,000.

Seismic upgrading of the school was approved in April 2006 and was completed by fall 2007.

Classes for students in grades 11 and 12 were added in 2006–07 and the school now supports a full 8–12 curriculum, no longer requiring students to switch over to North Delta Secondary School after 10th grade.

Academics and Electives 
Delview offers a wide range of academic classes to its students. The programs listed below are only for academic courses available during the school day.

Delview's elective courses depend on the interest in the course, with a wide range of choices as well. Grade 8's do not get to choose their own electives for their first year at Delview, but instead go through a full rotation of all of the electives offered at Delview for three weeks each.

Electives are organized into Fine Arts and Applied Skills (ADST) for Grade 8's, until students can choose their own electives in Grade 9.

Delview operated on a two-semester timetable, consisting of 8 courses total over both semesters, with 4 courses a day, labelled as blocks A, B, C and D.

Innovation 10 
Innovation 10 is a special course offered only at Delview, co-taught by teachers Mr. Kung and Mr. Turpin. It is a cross-curricular course covering Science 10, Social Studies 10, and English 10 along with an Independent Directed Study (IDS) elective all together. Students are part of a cohort of students meeting every day for two consecutive blocks during the semester (students completing the course will earn credit for 4 courses in 2 blocks which adds up to 2 extra blocks in their schedules).

The majority of activities combines aspects of the three academic areas. Students learn about topics varying from cosmology and Canadian Confederation, to the writing of character origin stories and creation myths, all learned by doing hands-on projects and using critical thinking.

Students have produced many memorable projects from this course, such as publishing books, doing interviews, and having heated debates. Students have created podcasts covering eating disorders, air pollution, racism, ocean waste and homelessness, as well as written published books such as The March of Humanity, The World (Almost) Sucks, and More Than the Sum of Our Parts: A Student Understanding of Mental Health. For 2023-2024, Innovation 10 is writing children's books.

Athletics
Delview Secondary offers a number of athletic programs, but all of the programs depend on student enrollment, which means programs change depending on interest. These sports are usually divided into grade categories unless they are individual sports. The categories start at grade-8 teams, which sometimes combine with junior (grades 9–10), and senior teams (11–12).

For the 2022–23 fall season (Sept–Nov), Delview offers grade 8, junior and senior teams for both boys and girls in volleyball, as well as junior and senior boys soccer teams, and a co-ed swim team.

For the 2023–24 winter season (Nov–Mar), Delview offers grade 8, junior, and senior boys and girls basketball teams as well as a co-ed wrestling program.

For the 2023–24 spring season, Delview offers grade 8/junior  and senior badminton teams, girls junior and senior soccer teams, junior and senior track and field teams (co-ed), an ultimate co-ed team, and a ball hockey team.

The athletics director for 2023–2024 is Mr. Simon Crowley.

 Theatre Company 9-12 offers students the whole performing package, with a variation of musical theatre and plays. Delview has performed musicals and plays such as Urinetown, performed March 2023, Delvusical, performed June 2022, TDM Mixtape, D.O.A., and The Drowsy Chaperone.

For this upcoming year, the Delview Theatre Company has announced that it will be debuting a play based on the well known historic event, The Titanic, but in the form of a play, taking the perspective of the man who built the ship himself, and how his life changed after he got on the last lifeboat to leave the Titanic, hence the play's name 'The Last Lifeboat'.

 Theatre Production & Design 10-11 offers students a separate look into the makings of a production, eventually getting to help set up and organise the production set as well as do many creative projects in the program.
 Theatre Scriptwriting and Directing 11-12 offers students a chance to write and direct short plays and learn the techniques to making masterpieces on stage, eventually presenting a self-written play at the end.
 *Theatre Company "Club" (Grade 8) offers students the same benefits as Theatre Company 9–12, but does not give course credits- instead students can get volunteer hours while still acting in the play.

Yearbook (grades 10–12) 
Yearbook is an X-Block course offered to students to give them a chance to learn visual and graphic design through photography, photoshop, and writing, coming together to form the yearbook, a book composed and sold to Delview students consisting of photos from the year.

Delview Band 
Currently led by Mx. Spilchen, the Delview band offers students the chance to learn and grow in their musical knowledge, focusing on learning orchestral instruments, playing a wide variety of music from classical to jazz. These pieces are played during performance nights such as Fine Arts Night at Delview.

Thanks 4 Giving 
In 2022, Delview held its 30th Annual Thanks 4 Giving (T4G) Food Drive, one of the biggest events at Delview during the First Semester. T4G sees hundreds of students and parents, plus the school's entire staff, come together to collect tens of thousands of non-perishable food items, recyclables and cash donations from across North Delta, all to benefit the Surrey Food Bank and Deltassist.

In 2022, Thanks 4 Giving took place on Oct. 27, in the pouring rain, with a goal of collecting 20,000 items. The planning for this event started before the school year even started, and once the year starts, many students dedicate their time to contribute to the committee. Not only do most students contribute to the planning of the event, but all students have class competitions to raise cans and funds, collecting hundreds of cans by students bringing in cans to support the cause before the big night.

On the night of T4G, teams of students fan out across the community, collecting donations door-to-door and bring them back to the school where they will be counted, sorted and boxed for pick up the following morning. In 2022, the total count was 21,561 cans and many more money donations going towards supporting food banks in the community.

Started by teachers Ron McNeill, Barb Woodford and Sandy Ferguson in 1992 under the name "Ten-in-One" (10,000 items collected in one night), it has grown into a widespread volunteer event that influences people from across North Delta to contribute and help out local food banks.

Since 1922, T4G has collected over 480,000 non-perishable foods and is the largest one-day food drive in all of British Columbia.

For the 31st year of Thanks 4 Giving on October 11, 2023, Delview's T4G committee set a goal for 10,000, and well exceeded that goal- beating their highest total record ever- raising 26,552 cans after the final count. This beat the previous can record set on the 25th anniversary of 26,441 cans!

Other events

Live @ Lunch 
Live @ Lunch is a music event occurring around once every month where students get to perform music during lunch in front of the school. Tim Bonikowsky runs this event once a month and lets all Delview students sign up to perform and come watch, ranging from organ solos to rock music.

Fine Arts Nite 
Once per semester, Delview hosts its Fine Arts Night, a collection of performing arts, musical arts and visual arts all in one night. Delview's Media Arts and Photography portion, taught by Mr. Choy, as well as Delview's Art and Sculpture portions are displayed for viewing, taught by Mrs. Johnston. On stage during the night there are a variety of dance performances, taught by Ms. Hanson and musical performances opened to any Delview students. The Delview Band will also play a collection of songs learned over the year, led by Mx. Spilchen. At the end of the year, the money raised goes towards a Grad Arts Scholarship.

Spirit Weeks 
Delview's Leadership team often hosts Spirit Weeks throughout the year, encouraging everyone to dress up in different costumes to show off Delview spirit, such as "Twin Day", "Inside-Out Day", or "Anything But A Backpack Day". Other clubs such as Culture Club also encourage people to wear things on specific days, such as cultural clothing or Delview merchandise.
