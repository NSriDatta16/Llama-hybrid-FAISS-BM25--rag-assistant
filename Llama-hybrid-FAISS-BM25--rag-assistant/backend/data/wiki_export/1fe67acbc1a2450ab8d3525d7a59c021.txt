Cherif-Touré Mamam (born 13 January 1978) is a Togolese former professional footballer who played as a midfielder for the Togo national team.

Club career
During his time at Livingston, Touré wore number 91. This is said to be his lucky number from his childhood as he had a basketball shirt bearing that number. He also had "Sheriff" on the shirt but the Scottish Premier League ordered him to use his real name. His most memorable moment at Livingston was scoring twice in a 5–1 win at Motherwell in October 2002.

Touré was in January 2005 on a trial with Norwegian club SK Brann, where he claimed that he was born in 1985 and that he had never played for any clubs in Europe, despite having previously played for the Scottish side Livingston where he was registered as born in 1981. One of Brann's players, Charlie Miller who had previously played for Dundee United, asked him if he was the same player as the one who used to play for Livingston, but Toure denied this.

International career
Touré was a member of the Togo national team and played in the 1998, 2000, 2006 African Cup of Nations, and was called up to the 2006 World Cup in Germany. He is the only Togolese player in history to score a goal for Togo at a FIFA World Cup.

Personal life
His brother Souleymane Mamam also plays for the Togolese National side.  Although Mamam is the family name, Cherif Touré has his Christian names on the back of his shirt.
