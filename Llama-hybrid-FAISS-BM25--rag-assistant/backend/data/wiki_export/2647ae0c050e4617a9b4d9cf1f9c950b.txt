Hickory Records is an American record label founded in 1954 by Acuff-Rose Music, which operated the label up to 1979. Sony Music Publishing (then Sony/ATV) revived the label in 2007. Originally based in Nashville, and functioning as an independent label throughout its history, it has had several distributors.

History

From its inception in 1955 to 1973, Hickory was distributed independently. MGM Records then distributed the label in 1973, and ABC Records began distributing it four years later. MCA Records inherited the ABC distribution deal when it bought ABC Records in 1979. The relationship between Acuff-Rose/Hickory and MCA turned sour shortly afterwards, so the Hickory label was discontinued, and its catalog was pulled when the distribution deal expired later in 1979.

In 1993, Scotti Bros. Records began reissuing the Hickory catalog.

The Hickory catalog is owned by Sony Music Publishing, which owns the Acuff-Rose catalogue, and the Hickory label was revived in 2007 with an album by Elliott Yamin. The output of the revived Hickory Records is distributed by Sony Music's RED Distribution unit.

Although Hickory began as a country music label, it signed some rock groups, such as Neal Ford and the Fanatics, The Sparkles (from Texas), and The Newbeats, as well as distributing a few UK Pye Records artists such as Donovan. Pye distributed Hickory in the UK. Among the hits that Hickory had on the pop charts were those by Sue Thompson, Kris Jensen, Donovan, and The Newbeats.
