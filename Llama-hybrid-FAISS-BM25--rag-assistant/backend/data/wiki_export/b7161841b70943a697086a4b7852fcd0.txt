Waterdown was a hardcore punk and post-hardcore band from Osnabrück, Germany. The band emerged onto the scene in 1999 under the formation of: Axel Pralat (guitar), Marcel Bischoff (vocals), Jörg Schwoeppe (drums), Christian Kruse (bass), Holger Behrens (guitar), and Ingo Rieser (vocals). The band was signed to Victory Records up until the mid-2000s. The band's first release was Never Kill the Boy on the First Date, which put them on the map in both Europe and America. This was followed by their second release The Files You Have on Me. They then toured until one of their vocalists (Bischoff) left the group in 2004. Eventually they found their current singer, Michael "Zacken" Janczak. After acquiring Janczak, production on their following album All Riot began immediately. The album was released on January 24, 2006. Sometime between the release of All Riot and the EP Powersnake, Ingo Rieser left the ensemble. The band put out the EP Powersnake and a final record Into the Flames, until they called it quits in 2012. Their song “Repeater” off of their 2006 album “All Riot” was featured in the 2006 baseball game MVP 06: NCAA Baseball.
