He succeeded his father to the earldom in 1698. He married Lady Elizabeth Egerton, daughter of John Egerton, 2nd Earl of Bridgewater, and they had four sons:

Hon. Thomas Sidney (1681 – 27 January 1729)
Jocelyn Sidney, 7th Earl of Leicester (1682–1743)

Three of his sons succeeded their father in turn to the earldom. The youngest son, Jocelyn, was the last earl of this creation.
