Tristychius (from  , 'three' and   'row') is an extinct genus of elasmobranch chondrichthyan from the Carboniferous period (Visean). Fossils of T. arcuatus, the type and only species, including fin spines have been found in Scotland.

Tristychius was a small animal, up to about  long. It had a heterocercal caudal fin, and large spines on two dorsal fins. Unlike other chondrichthyans that have three basal plates on pectoral fin (propterygium, mesopterygium and metapterygium), its pectoral fin had only two basal plates and lacked mesopterygium. Even through it is one of the earliest known stem-elasmobranchs, it is estimated to be a specialized suction feedeeing benthic predator, either ambushing or using stealth to approach its prey.
