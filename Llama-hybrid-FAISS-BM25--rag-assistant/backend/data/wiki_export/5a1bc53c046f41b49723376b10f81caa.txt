The National Registry of Identification and Civil Status (Registro Nacional de Identificaci√≥n y Estado Civil, RENIEC) is an autonomous constitutional body of the State of Peru. Its role is to maintain the records of births, marriages, divorces and deaths in the country, as well as of the suffrage eligibility and registration. Its headquarters are in downtown Lima.

History 

While RENIEC is a recently created entity, its roots can be traced to the Viceroyalty of Peru, in which the Catholic Church kept records of all people born within the territory. With the Independence of the country, the Registry System was created, which depended on what today is the National Jury of Elections.

Following the self-coup by Alberto Fujimori, the new Constitution of 1993 created the National Registry of Identification and Civil Status, to complement the National Jury of Elections and the National Office of Electoral Processes.
