A Roma youth product, Lupatelli was farmed to Chievo for the 2001–02 and 2002–03 seasons, after he played just 12 Serie A games for the capital club, wearing the number 10 jersey, despite being a goalkeeper, because of a bet he made with friends. He was sold to Chievo for 3 billion Italian lire in a co-ownership deal in 2002. In the 2003–04 season, he returned to Roma for €900,000, as the backup of Ivan Pelizzoli.

Whilst on loan at Parma F.C., he was exchanged with Matteo Guardalben mid-season.

In September 2008, he joined Cagliari on a free transfer, acting as a deputy to Federico Marchetti.

He was set to become a free agent on 1 July 2010, and was not called up to the club's 2010–11 pre-season training camp.
