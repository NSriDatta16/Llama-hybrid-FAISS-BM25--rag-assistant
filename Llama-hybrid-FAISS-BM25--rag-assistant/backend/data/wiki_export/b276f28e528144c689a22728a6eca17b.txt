KMFY (96.9 FM) is a radio station licensed to Grand Rapids, Minnesota. KMFY covers the counties of Itasca, Aitkin, Cass and western St. Louis. KMFY broadcasts local weather, sports, local news, and community events. Sometime in 2023, KMFY removed all music from 1980’s, a majority of 1990’s, and 2000’s music from its main playlist, making it lean more towards a Hot AC station. KMFY plays 80’s music on Friday nights with the syndicated Backtrax USA 80’s Edition.
