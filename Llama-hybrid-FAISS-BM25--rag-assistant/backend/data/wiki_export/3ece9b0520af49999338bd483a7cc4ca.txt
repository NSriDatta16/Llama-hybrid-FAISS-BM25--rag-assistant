The area is part of the traditional region of Styria. The municipality is now included in the Mura Statistical Region.

Name
The settlement was first mentioned in written sources in 1680 under name Videm (borrowed from Middle High German videme 'church property'—originally, 'property left by the deceased to the church'). The settlement was known as Videm ob Ščavnici (literally, 'church property on the Ščavnica River') until 1997. On January 22, 1997 the municipal authorities mistakenly assumed that the name had been changed from a religious name under communist Yugoslavia, and it was changed to match the parish name Sveti Jurij ob Ščavnici (literally, 'Saint George on the Ščavnica River').

Church

The local parish church is dedicated to Saint George () and belongs to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Murska Sobota. It dates to the 13th century with numerous rebuildings, adaptations, and renovations over the following centuries.
