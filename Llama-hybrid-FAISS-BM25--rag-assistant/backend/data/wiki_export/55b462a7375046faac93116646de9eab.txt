The European Federation of Psychologists' Associations is the umbrella organization of national societies in the field of psychology that are located in the European Economic Area.

History
The federation was founded in 1981 and the first general assembly was held in Heidelberg. Since then, general assemblies have been held every two years in different European cities. Since 1995, the general assembly is held in conjunction with the biennial European Congress of Psychology.

Aims
The federation is concerned with promoting and improving psychology as a profession and as a discipline, particularly, though not exclusively, in applied settings and with emphasis on the training and research associated with such practice. Its official journal is the European Psychologist. In 2009, the federation launched the EuroPsy register.

Member associations 
 the federation has 37 member associations, which together represent over 350,000 psychologists from all 27 members states of the European Union plus 3 members states of the EEA (Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein) plus Albania, San Marino, Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom. In addition, there are 14 organisations registered as associate member associations and 2 that are registered as affiliate member associations.

EuroPsy
One of the major initiatives of the federation was the establishment  of the EuroPsy or European Certificate in Psychology. This qualification sets a common standard for education, professional training and competence for psychologists to practice independently across Europe.
