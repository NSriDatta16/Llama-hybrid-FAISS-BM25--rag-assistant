The Waputik Range lies west of the upper Bow Valley, east of Bath Creek, and south of Balfour Creek in the Canadian Rockies. "Waputik" means "white goat" in Stoney.  The range was named in 1884 by George Mercer Dawson of the Geological Survey of Canada. The President Range lies within the Waputik Range.

The Waputik Range should not be confused with the much larger Waputik Mountains which encompasses this range and other peaks along the Continental Divide in Yoho National Park.
