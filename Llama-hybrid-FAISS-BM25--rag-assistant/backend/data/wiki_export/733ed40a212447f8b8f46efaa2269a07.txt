Campus and facilities

Saugus High School is located just north of the geographic center of Santa Clarita. The school's campus is built on a hill, with a leveled upper and lower campus and a sloped quad in between the two campuses. The A, B, C, D, E, F, and G buildings are located on the lower campus. Generally speaking, elective classes are located on the lower campus. The theater arts, choir, and band classes are housed in building E. The ASB and student store are housed in the A building, art and ceramics classes in the B building, and computer and business classes in the C building. Video, wood, auto shop, and other elective classes are in the D building. Some core classes are scattered throughout the lower campus nonetheless. The campus is bounded on the east by Centurion Way, on the south by Bouquet Creek, and on the west by the Los Angeles Aqueduct.

The upper campus is larger than the lower campus and houses teachers that teach core subjects. Teachers who teach an elective alongside their core class also teach their elective class here. It houses the H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, R, S, and X buildings. In buildings H, K, and Q are English classes, although some English classes are scattered in the L, P, and A buildings due to a lack of space. In building J is the math department, in L are social studies classes, in M is the world language department, in P and R are history classes, and in the S building is the S lecture hall.

The two-story Y building is located on both upper and lower campus, with the offices portion on the first floor, in the lower campus, and the library located on the second floor in the upper campus.

Saugus High has multiple entrances. The main entrance is at Centurion Colonnade located between the Y and A buildings in the lower campus, next to Centurion Way. Other lower campus entrances include the student parking lot D gate, auto compound gate, basketball courts gate, and the gate located towards the end of the football field. There are two entrances on the upper campus. The "driveway" is located behind the K and J buildings, leading up to Centurion Way.

Many of Saugus's renovations were completed in September 2007. These renovations included a new X building, the football field, the gym, the amphitheater, the refurbishing of the A, B, C, E, F, H, J, L, K, Q, M, P, R, and S buildings, a new cafeteria, a new student store, ASB office, library and administration building. During the modernization, the D building in the lower campus and the W weight room building next to the field were not altered, except for the new exterior paint the D building got to match the school's new and modern look. During the summer of 2011, the D building went through extensive renovation in order to modernize the current electives up to today's standards. Room D5 which houses video production, and TV production (SNN) will expand and receive a new television studio. Wood shop and the auto compound will also expand and receive new equipment. New facilities and accommodations continue to arise on campus including a  performing arts center which includes a large performance stage, 468 audience seats, catwalks, a fly room for lights and set rigging, spaces for drama rooms, and a large lobby and ticketing area.

The school newspaper is known as the Saugus Scroll.
