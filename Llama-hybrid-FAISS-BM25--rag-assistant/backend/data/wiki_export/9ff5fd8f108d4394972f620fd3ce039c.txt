Architecture 

The principal (south) façade is two storeys high and  in length with three projections: a large porte-cochère in the centre and semi-octagonal towers at either end. The porte-cochère consists of a five bay arcade with buttresses of corbelled brickwork at each corner. Each of the two vehicle entrances is spanned by a large pointed arch. The porte-cochère opens on to a  wide continuous veranda with pointed arch openings, the tympana of which are filled with louvre frames for ventilation and shade. The veranda on the second storey wraps around the porte-cochère in a narrower strip supported by concrete brackets set on corbelled brick footings. This strip of veranda is covered with a sloping shingled roof. The entrance foyer is surmounted by a hemispherical dome. The blocks behind the semi-octagonal terminal projections are three storeys high.
