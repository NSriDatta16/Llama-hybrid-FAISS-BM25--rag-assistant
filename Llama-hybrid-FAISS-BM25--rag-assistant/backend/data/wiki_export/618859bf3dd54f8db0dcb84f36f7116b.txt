This is a list of the birds species of the Tuamotus. The avifauna of the Tuamotus include 86 species. Of these, 13 are endemic, and one is extinct.

This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 2022 edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Introduced and accidental species are included in the total counts for the Tuamotus.

The following tags have been used to highlight several categories. The commonly occurring native species do not fall into any of these categories.

 (A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in the Tuamotus
 (E) Endemic - a species endemic to the Tuamotus
 (I) Introduced - a species introduced to the Tuamotus as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions
