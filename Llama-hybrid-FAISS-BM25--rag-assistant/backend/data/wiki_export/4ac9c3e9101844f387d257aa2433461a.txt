The mine layer HNoMS Laugen was built for the Royal Norwegian Navy during World War I, as the lead ship of a two ship class. Her sister ship was Glommen.

She and her sister ship were kept in service until the German invasion of Norway in 1940. Laugen surrendered to the Germans on 14 April 1940, and like her sister ship was rebuilt as a floating anti-aircraft battery. She was returned to the Royal Norwegian Navy in 1945 and decommissioned in 1950.

Laugen was built at Akers mekaniske verksted in Kristiania. She was named after the river LÃ¥gen in southern Norway.
