In the SHA-2 family of six cryptographic hash functions, the weakest is SHA-224, named because it produces 224-bit hash values. It was defined in this way so that the number of bits of security it provides (half of its output length, 112 bits) would match the key length of two-key Triple DES.

The ancient Phoenician shekel was a standardized measure of silver, equal to 224 grains, although other forms of the shekel employed in other ancient cultures (including the Babylonians and Hebrews) had different measures. Likely not coincidentally, as far as ancient Burma and Thailand, silver was measured in a unit called a tikal, equal to 224 grains.
