The Marshal's Star () is an additional badge of rank worn by marshals of the armed forces of the Soviet Union, and subsequently the Russian Federation.

Overview
The armed forces of the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation have two such insignia for higher military ranks, both in the form of a five-pointed star of gold and platinum with diamonds. They are worn around the neck when in parade uniform (originally under the collar of the parade tunic, since 1955 on top of the necktie). There are two different sizes of star available, with the official name, size and number of diamonds corresponding to the marshal's rank. Informally they are known as the "Large Marshal's Star" and the "Small Marshal's Star". The official names of the Marshal's Stars have changed over time, depending on which ranks received the right to wear them.

The Marshal's Stars correspond with the Western use of the marshal's baton. On the death of the recipient, the award is returned to the Diamond Fund for re-use.
