"Heat Wave" is a popular song written by Irving Berlin for the 1933 musical As Thousands Cheer, and introduced in the show by Ethel Waters.

1946: It was also featured in the film Blue Skies, where it was performed by Olga San Juan.
1954: There's No Business Like Show Business, where it was performed by Marilyn Monroe. (Note: based on the lyrics alone, the Marilyn song is different, and within the film's narrative, Monroe's version is a sexier variant of the original that's "stolen" from Ethel Merman's character).
