"After the Love Has Gone" is a single by Earth, Wind & Fire released in 1979 on ARC/Columbia Records. The song reached No. 2 on both the US Billboard Hot 100 (behind The Knack's "My Sharona") and the US Billboard Hot R&B Singles chart, No. 4 on the UK Pop Singles chart, and No. 3 on the US Billboard Adult Contemporary Songs chart. "After the Love Has Gone" was certified gold in the US by the RIAA and silver in the UK by the BPI.

Background
"After the Love Has Gone" was produced by Maurice White and written by David Foster, Jay Graydon, and  Bill Champlin. The single's B-side was "Rock That." Both songs appeared on Earth, Wind & Fire's 1979 album I Am.

The song dates back to when David Foster was working on an album for Motown Records singer Jaye P. Morgan. The album was released in Japan and never took off in the United States. Foster later went to Motown to let the executives hear some of the material. Foster was in the middle of a song and ad-libbed the chorus to "After The Love Has Gone", as he had forgotten the words. Foster and Jay Graydon  then asked Bill Champlin to write lyrics to the music after Graydon had come up with an idea for the verse. At the time, Foster was producing Champlin's 1978 solo debut Single for Full Moon/Epic Records and was working with Earth, Wind & Fire around the time they were recording their album I Am. Foster then showed Maurice White the song, which White loved and wanted to record. Foster and Graydon later told Champlin that the song would be removed from his album for inclusion on Earth, Wind & Fire's album, which Champlin allowed. According to former manager turned Sony Music Entertainment CEO Tommy Mottola, Foster previously offered the song to Hall and Oates, but they rejected it as they were only interested in performing their own material.

Graydon commented about the song's background:

Earth, Wind & Fire bassist Verdine White called "After the Love Has Gone" one of the group's most difficult songs to record:

"The track was based on a vibe. We cut it about six, seven times, and Maurice just said, 'No, it's not right yet. We'll come back and get it tomorrow. It's not right yet.'" And then one day we nailed it, and it was right. The way it felt. It sounded like Earth, Wind & Fire".

Critical reception
Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian described "After the Love Has Gone" as "an exercise in classic songcraft â€“ the horn section's precise jabs and the exquisite harmonies dazzle" Rose Riggins of Gannett wrote Maurice White's "talents are vividly expressed through 'Wait' and 'After The Love is Gone.' But he has yet to recapture the enchantment of the previous recording of 'Love's Holiday' off the All-n-All album." Matthew Greenwald of Allmusic proclaimed that a "simple soul-based melody and groove underlines the bittersweet goodbye message of the lyrics. But it's the arrangement that captured audience's attention, as it combined the group's vocal counterpoint harmony genius in full glory. A swinging saxophone in the song's middle-eight bridge also added an element of jazz". Allen Weiner of Morning Call found that "After The Love Is Gone is perhaps the best ballad EW&F has ever recorded. It's sensitive and warm, and interesting enough to justify its four-minute length." Ace Adams of the New York Daily News called After the Love Has Gone one of the album's "best songs".
Phyl Garland of Stereo Review noted that the song is "laced with unexpected Wonder-ful progressions". Cash Box said it is an "easy, smooth ballad, with...lush horn and vocal arrangements," "superb harmonies and jazzy sax work."  Record World called it a "lovely ballad."

"After the Love Has Gone" was nominated for the Grammy Awards for Record of the Year and Song of the Year, and won Best R&B Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group for the band and Best R&B Song for Champlin, Foster, and Graydon. It also placed on Bruce Pollock's list of "The 7,500 Most Important Songs of 1944-2000".

Appearances in other media
The song was heard on an episode of WKRP in Cincinnati in a scene where staffer Bailey Quarters was brooding over being stood up on a planned date with morning drive DJ Johnny Fever.

The Houston Rockets played this song for losses, as would many other professional sports teams, including the Chicago White Sox, Philadelphia Phillies and Charlotte Hornets.
