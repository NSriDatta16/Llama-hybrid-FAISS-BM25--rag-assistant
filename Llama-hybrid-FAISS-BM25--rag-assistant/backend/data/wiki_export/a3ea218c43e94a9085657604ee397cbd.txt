Driffield Navigation
The Driffield Navigation canal passes at the west of the village. The Brigham section of the Driffield Navigation was dug about 1767. A swing bridge was built across the canal to allow access to Elm Tree Farm, and a footpath to Corpslanding and Hutton Cranswick. In 1967, after a decline in canal traffic, the swing bridge was kept closed, and was replaced by a fixed bridge in the 1970s. In 2003 a new working swing bridge was installed.
