Churches
 The Roman Catholic Church of St. Fidelis was built in 1908 in Landquart.
 The current Reformed church in Igis was built to its current appearance in 1486.  At that time, the nave was extended to the south and the choir was expanded.  The main portal was also built in 1486, as this date is carved into the stone.  The paintings on the north-east wall date from before the 1486 renovation.  It is believed that this wall is part of St. Damian's Church in Ovine that was mentioned in 841, though this identification is debated.  Part of the identification rests on the fact that the bell of the church contains an inscription that indicates that it was dedicated to Cosmas and Damian.  Regardless, the current church is clearly mentioned about 1300 in the records of Pfäfers Abbey.
 The Church in Landquart was built in the 20th Century as the village section grew.  The land was acquired in 1914, though construction began only in 1925.  Construction finished on 11 January 1926.
