El Norte
Villalpando's role in El Norte meant a lot to him. He gave an interview to Lear Media about the film: what it meant to him and why the film was important. Villalpando said:
"Twenty nine years ago, the indigenous people in Guatemala, were living a cruel extermination that forced them to flee toward Mexico and the United States. This exodus lasted a decade and half a million Guatemalans made the journey to America seeking for asylum and refuge.*
