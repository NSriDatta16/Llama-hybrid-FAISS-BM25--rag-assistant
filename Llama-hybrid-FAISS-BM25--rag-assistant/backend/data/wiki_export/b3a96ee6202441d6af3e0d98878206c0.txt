Background

NASCAR team owner 

Melling's first involvement in NASCAR began in 1979 as a primary sponsor for Benny Parsons. Melling Racing won the NASCAR Winston Cup points championship with Bill Elliott.

Death 
Melling died of a heart attack at his golf course in Gaylord, Michigan, two weeks before his 54th birthday. At the Michigan race two weeks later, which is usually the team's homecoming, the team raced a red and white Cartoon Network (the sponsor in the 1999 season) with the team's driver Jerry Nadeau. On the decklid, a decal said "To Harry! We miss you". Harry's favorite colors were red and white, and semi-served as a team throwback. His son, Mark ran his team for a few more years.
