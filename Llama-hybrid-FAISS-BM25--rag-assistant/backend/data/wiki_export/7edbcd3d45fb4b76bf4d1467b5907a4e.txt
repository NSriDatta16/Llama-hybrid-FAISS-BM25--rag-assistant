New York State Route 90 (NY 90) is a north–south state highway in the Finger Lakes region of New York in the United States. All but five of the route's  are located in Cayuga County, with the remaining  situated in Cortland County. The southern terminus of the route is at an intersection with U.S. Route 11 (US 11) and NY 41 in the village of Homer. Its northern terminus is at a junction with NY 31 in the town of Montezuma. Although the route is signed as north–south, the portion of NY 90 from King Ferry to Homer follows an east–west alignment.

It is not to be confused with Interstate 90 (I-90), which also passes through Montezuma. The two 90s in fact cross, the only time when two same numbered highways intersect in the state, but there is no access between them.

History
The earliest predecessor to NY 90 was the fifth segment of the Great Western Turnpike, chartered in 1814 to run from Homer to Cayuga Lake. At its western terminus, ferries took travellers to points opposite on the lake.

NY 90 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. It originally began at US 11 in the hamlet of Messengerville and passed through Virgil, Cortland to King Ferry, where it ran along the eastern edge of Cayuga Lake to its terminus at NY 31 in Montezuma. In Cortland, NY 90 had an overlap with NY 13 along Tompkins Street from Owego Street to Main Street. At Main Street, NY 90 turned north to follow US 11 and NY 41 to Homer, where NY 90 split from the two routes and headed west toward Cayuga County.

In the early 1980s, the state of New York assumed maintenance of an east–west highway connecting NY 90 in Virgil to the village of Dryden. Around the same time, NY 90 was truncated on its southern end to its junction with US 11 and NY 41 in Homer. The Dryden–Virgil highway and NY 90's former routing from Virgil to Messengerville became NY 392; from Virgil to Cortland, old NY 90 was redesignated as NY 215. Today, at least two signs showing NY 90 signed concurrently with US 11 and NY 41 still exist in the village of Homer as remnants of its former southward extension.
