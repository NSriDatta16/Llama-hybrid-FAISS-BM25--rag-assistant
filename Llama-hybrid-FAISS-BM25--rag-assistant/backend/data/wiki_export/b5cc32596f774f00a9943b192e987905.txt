History  

History of Mahad

Mahad, a quaint town nestled in the beautiful Konkan ( History of Mahad ) region of Maharashtra, India, holds a significant historical and cultural legacy. With a rich past that dates back to ancient times, Ma-had has witnessed the rise and fall of empires, played a vital role in the Indian independence movement, and now stands as a thriving modern town with its unique charm.

Chavdaar Tale Satyagraha 

It is famous for the Chavdaar Tale's satyagraha of Bhimrao Ambedkar at Chavdar Tale, which is large public water tank in Mahad town. Ambedkar with his followers of over 2,500 dalits marched to the tank. In the March some upper caste people also participated, who use to admired Bhimrao's idiolgy.  Ambedkar was the first to take his hand and sip water from the tank, followed by the rest. This was a revolutionary step for the time and broke the taboo of caste discrimination. This came to be known as the Mahad Satyagraha. Many disciples of Lord Buddha and followers of  B.R. Ambedkar visit Chavdaar Tale every year on Kranti Din (Day of Revolution).

However, this was not the end of the struggle. There was tremendous backlash from the rest of the community and some even performed a purification ritual to counter the act of revolution.  Ambedkar made another statement by burning the Hindu book Manusmriti at the very same spot on 25 December 1927.
