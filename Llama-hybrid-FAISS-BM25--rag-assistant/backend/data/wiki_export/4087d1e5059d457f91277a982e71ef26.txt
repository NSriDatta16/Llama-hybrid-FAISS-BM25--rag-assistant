In 1966, the United States FBI, under Director J. Edgar Hoover, continued for a seventeenth year to maintain a public list of the people it regarded as the Ten Most Wanted Fugitives.

Throughout the year 1966, six of the ten places on the list remained filled by these elusive long-time fugitives from prior years, then still at large:

 1962 #170 (four years), Edward Howard Maps remained still at large
 1964 #193 (two years), Chester Collins remained still at large
 1964 #197 (two years), Alson Thomas Wahrlich remained still at large
 1965 #203 (one year), John William Clouser remained still at large
 1965 #208 (one year), Donald Stewart Heien arrested February 3, 1966
 1965 #220 (one year), Edward Owens Watkins arrested December 2, 1966

By year end, a clear trend had emerged in the years of the mid-1960s, during which the FBI consistently was able to list and then capture the largest number of fugitives in multiple back to back years than in any other period in history for the top ten list.  Keeping pace with this trend, the FBI added a total of an additional nineteen new Fugitives in 1966.

1966 also brought the first ever dual listing of two Fugitives at the same time, on February 16, Charles Lorin Gove at #229 and Ralph Dwayne Owen at #230.
