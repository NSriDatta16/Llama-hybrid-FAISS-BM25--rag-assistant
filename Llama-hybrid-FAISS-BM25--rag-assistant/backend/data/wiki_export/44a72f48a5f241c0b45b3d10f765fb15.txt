A Bit of Liverpool, released as With Love (From Us to You) in the UK, is the third studio album by the Supremes, released in the fall of 1964 on the Motown label. It was produced by Berry Gordy with Hal Davis and Marc Gordon doing the mixing.

The Supremes performed the Beatles' "Eight Days a Week" on several television shows including Shindig and Hullabaloo, though the song did not make the album. The album just missed the Top 20 in the U.S., peaking at No. 21. While not quite as prolific as the Beatles, the Supremes enjoyed three albums charting simultaneously in 1964–65.

Critical response
Among contemporary reviews, an anonymous reviewer in the San Francisco Examiner commented "the selection, 'You Can't Do That' rates the first slot on the album; the others just exist".

In 1982, The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Black Music described A Bit of Liverpool as one of "several banal albums" recorded in the midst of their run of hits. The 2011 edition of The Encyclopedia of Popular Music rated the album 2 out of 5 stars.
