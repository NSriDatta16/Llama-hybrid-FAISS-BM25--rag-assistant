Alabama's 2nd congressional district is a United States congressional district in Alabama, which elects a representative to the United States House of Representatives. It includes most of the Montgomery metropolitan area, and stretches into the Wiregrass Region in the southeastern portion of the state. The district encompasses portions of Montgomery County and the entirety of Autauga, Barbour, Bullock, Butler, Coffee, Conecuh, Covington, Crenshaw, Dale, Elmore, Geneva, Henry, Houston and Pike counties. Other cities in the district include Andalusia, Dothan, Greenville, and Troy.

The district is represented by Republican Barry Moore, a former Alabama state representative, who replaced Martha Roby, the retired Republican incumbent, in the 2020 election.

The 2nd is scheduled to be completely overhauled in advance of the 2024 elections, in consequence of the United States Supreme Court's decision in Allen v. Milligan, which ordered Alabama to create a second black opportunity district. Following this, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama appointed a special master to create new maps for the state, which resulted in the 2nd joining the 7th as the state's two opportunity districts. Under its future configuration, this district would have been one of 19 districts that voted for Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election had they existed in such configurations while being won or held by a Republican in 2022. However, with Moore's home county of Coffee being drawn out of this district and into the 1st, the district has potentially been left with no incumbent.

Character

There are several small-to-medium-sized cities spread throughout the district. Fort Novosel and Maxwell-Gunter Air Force Base are both within its bounds, as is Troy University.

White voters here were among the first in Alabama to shift from the Democratic Party; the old-line Southern Democrats in this area began splitting their tickets as early as the 1950s. Today, the district is one of the most Republican districts in both Alabama and the nation. It has only supported a Democrat for president once since 1956, when Jimmy Carter carried it in 1976.  In 2008, the district elected a Democrat to Congress for the first time since 1964, but it reverted to its Republican ways in 2010.  At the state and local level, however, conservative Democrats continued to hold most offices as late as 2002.

White voters gave John McCain, the Republican candidate, 63.42% of the vote in 2008; Barack Obama, the Democratic candidate, received 36.05%, attracting voters beyond the substantial (and expected) African-American minority.

The district gives its congressmen very long tenures in Washington; only seven people have represented it since 1923, with all but one holding it for at least 10 years and four holding it for at least 15 years.
