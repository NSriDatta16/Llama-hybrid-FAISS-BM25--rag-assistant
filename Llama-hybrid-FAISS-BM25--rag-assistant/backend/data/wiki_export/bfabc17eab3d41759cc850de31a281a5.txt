History
The area has been a crossroads since antiquity, with archaeological evidence indicating habitation since 4000 BC. Surface excavations in the village of Küçükhöyük go back to 3000 BC.

The name Sinan Paşa comes from the son of a lord of the Akkoyunlu Turks who in 1473 took refuge with Ottoman Sultan Mehmet II during the war between the Akkoyunlu and the warrior Uzun Hasan (the Otlukbeli War). Later in the Ottoman period the important general Hersekzade Ahmet Paşa settled here in the village still known as Ahmet Paşa today.

The town was occupied by Greek forces during the Turkish War of Independence, but was recovered during the great Turkish counter-attack in 1922.

Sinanpaşa today
Nowadays Sinanpaşa is a country town providing schools, hospital and other infrastructure to the surrounding countryside, where poppy seeds, wheat and other grains are grown.
