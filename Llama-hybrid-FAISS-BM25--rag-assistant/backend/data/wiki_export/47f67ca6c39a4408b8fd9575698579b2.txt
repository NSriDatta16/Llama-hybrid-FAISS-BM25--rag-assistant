Nambal is located in the Kallar Syedan Tehsil of  Rawalpindi district of Pakistan.

Nambal was part of Tehsil Kahuta until recently when it became part of Kallar Seydan due to Kallar recently becoming Rawalpindi's seventh tehsil. Nambal has a mixture of Ranial Rajputs, Hayal and Bangial Rajputs.

History
The Ranial Rajas of Nambal can trace their ancestry back to the Muslim Janjua Rajpoot's who were a war-like clan and till this day are addressed as Raja.

The Ranial Rajputs are linked ancestrally to the Janjuas through Raja Malu Khan, who was a descendant of Raja Bhir as illustrated below:
