Globosat, was a Brazilian pay television content service, part of Grupo Globo. Established in 1991, after the creation of subscription television services in Brazil, with 29 channels and over 1,000 employees, it is the largest pay television content provider in Brazil, as well as of Latin America, comprising a domestic audience of 45 million viewers distributed among more than 15 million households.

History 

In 1993, Globosat split its content generation and distribution businesses. Cable TV sales and distribution were assigned to Net Brasil, which was also responsible for installing cable networks in selected cities. Nowadays NET is responsible for the cable network in those cities. Content production and programming remained with Globosat, renamed to Canais Globosat.

It has also operated a channel in Portugal, TV Globo Portugal, having earlier operated a similar channel, GNT Portugal, until 2006.

On September 15, 2020, Globosat merged its operations with Rede Globo, following Grupo Globo's "Uma só Globo" ("One Globo") restructuring; the merger made Globosat being renamed that day to Canais Globo.
