Currently, it is the main cricket venue of the port city. Previously, the M. A. Aziz Stadium was the main cricket venue of Chittagong; however, it focuses on football now.  It is also home to the Chattogram Challengers, the local franchise in the Bangladesh Premier League.

History
Situated about half-an-hour's drive outside the city centre, the Chittagong Divisional Stadium was one of the five purpose-built cricket grounds established in the run-up to the 2004 Under-19 World Cup. It was finally granted full international status in January 2006, ahead of Sri Lanka's tour to the country. The stadium itself is a concrete bowl set in acres of prime agricultural land, with a three-tier pavilion providing the focal point. The stadium provides views of lush trees, the port, and ships on the coast. It had floodlights installed prior to the world cup, only the fourth cricket ground in Bangladesh, giving the ability to host day/night cricket matches.

The venue has also hosted group stage matches of 2004 and 2016 Under-19 Cricket World Cup matches.

In February 2021, in the  first test between Bangladesh and West Indies, West Indies won the match by 3 wickets chasing 395 runs, courtesy of debutant Kyle Mayers's 210*, which was  fifth-highest successful run chase in test cricket and highest successful run chase on Asian soil, while Mayers became the first batsman to score a double century in the fourth innings of a test on debut and overall sixth batsman to score a double hundred in the fourth innings.
