Roger Langridge (born 14 February 1967) is a New Zealand comics writer, artist and letterer, currently living in Britain.

Biography
Langridge originally came to public prominence most notably with the Judge Dredd Megazine series The Straitjacket Fits (written by David Bishop), a surreal, hallucinatory, convention-bending strip set in an insane asylum with a cast of characters who realised they were in a comic strip and burst from the edge of the frame. He had previously been a regular artist for the 1988 issues of the Auckland University Students' Association's magazine Craccum.

His cartoon style proved perfect for the series and he continued to work for the Megazine, in addition to a series of comedy books dedicated to his Buster Keaton-inspired character Fred the Clown, which he wrote and drew as a webcomic before self-publishing the material as small press titles. These were collected as a single volume by Fantagraphics Books in 2004. His work on Fred the Clown was nominated for two Eisner Awards, a Harvey Award, a Reuben Award and an Ignatz Award. Langridge also does illustration work.

He has also provided artwork for Shaenon Garrity's Smithson webcomic.

Langridge has provided the Fin Fang Four, with Scott Gray, first for Marvel Monsters, then a series of short stories and in late 2008 as a digital comic on Marvel Digital Comics Unlimited.

He was the writer, and usually the cartoonist for, Boom! Studios' The Muppet Show comics (2009–12).

In 2012, he scripted for IDW a four-issue Popeye miniseries, illustrated by Bruce Ozella, so successful that even before the second issue it was expanded into an "ongoing" series, according to Langridge.

For Doctor Who Magazine he did one-panel humorous images for the "Review" section. He also does a weekly illustration for the UK TV magazine Inside Soap.
