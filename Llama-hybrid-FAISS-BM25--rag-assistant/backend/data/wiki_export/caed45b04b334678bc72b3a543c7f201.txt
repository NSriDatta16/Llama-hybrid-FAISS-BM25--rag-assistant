In 1903 the Defiance Female Seminary formally became Defiance College, making it one of only two religious-affiliated colleges to begin operation in Ohio during the 20th century.

McCann era
During President Kevin McCann's leadership (1951â€“1964), the campus increased in size to ; the library, student union, and Pilgrim halls were built; and old buildings were renovated. President Dwight D. Eisenhower paid two visits to Defiance. On October 15, 1953, he laid the cornerstone for the Anthony Wayne Library of American Study . Eisenhower re-visited the campus on May 26, 1963, to deliver the commencement address, at which time the college announced that one room in the library had been designated "the Eisenhower Room," honoring the friendship between Eisenhower and Kevin C. McCann.
