George Marcus Aquatics Center
In October, 2010, work began on a state-of-the-art pool and bathhouse. The pool took the place of the Upper Courts, a multi-use basketball and street-hockey court. The Aquatics Center was finished in June 2011, and was ready for the 2011 Camp Season. The facility is dedicated in memory of George Marcus, longtime former director of Camp Tel Noar. The pool was officially dedicated on June 25, 2011, four days before the 2011 Camp Opening Day. For the 2013 Summer season, the final phase of the George Marcus Aquatics Center project was completed. The former volleyball court in the dell was razed and replaced by a modern, multi-use basketball and volleyball court.
