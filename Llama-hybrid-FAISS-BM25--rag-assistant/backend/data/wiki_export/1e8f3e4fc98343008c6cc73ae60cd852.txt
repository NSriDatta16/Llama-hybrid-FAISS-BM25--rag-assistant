History
Mairipotaba began with the installation of a telegraph station at the end of the nineteenth century. In 1896 there were a few huts made of palm fronds surrounding the only solid construction—the telegraph station. The first name was São Sebastião do Atolador. With this name the settlement became a district of Piracanjuba, formerly known as Pouso Alto, in 1904. In 1920 the name was abbreviated to Atolador, being changed again to Sâo Sebastião do Atolador in 1933. In 1933 the name was changed to Serrania. In 1943 the name was changed to Mairipotaba, the same year that Pouso Alto became Piracanjuba. In 1950 it was dismembered to become a municipality.
