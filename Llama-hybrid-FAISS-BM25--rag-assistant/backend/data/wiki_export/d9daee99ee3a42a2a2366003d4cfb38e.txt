Isa Chandra Moskowitz is an American vegan chef, cookbook author, former host of the vegan community access cooking show Post Punk Kitchen, and restaurateur.

Early life and education
Raised in Brooklyn, New York, and having dropped out of The High School of Music & Art, where she majored in fine art, Moskowitz found herself drawn toward the punk rock scene of the Lower East Side of Manhattan in the late 1980s, embracing first a vegetarian diet, then veganism.  She also volunteered with Food Not Bombs. an anarchist organization that provides free vegan meals to the homeless and needy.

Vegan career

Post Punk Kitchen (cooking show)
The inspiration to create her own cooking show, the Post Punk Kitchen, came while watching the Food Network and wondering to herself why there were no vegan shows. According to Moskowitz, the show used the title The Post Punk Kitchen to signify the feeling of being "older and facing the conundrum of growing up and making compromises that their eighteen-year-old selves might hate them for".

Cookbooks
The success of The Post Punk Kitchen led to the compilation of a cookbook, Vegan with a Vengeance, in late  2005, and a number of additional cookbooks over the years. Both Veganomicon and Isa Does It: Amazingly Easy, Wildly Delicious Vegan Recipes for Every Day of the Week appeared on the list of the 16 best vegan cookbooks for 2023 by Food & Wine,

Restaurants
In April 2008, she relocated from New York to Portland, Oregon, then to Omaha, Nebraska. Her restaurant, Modern Love, has locations in Omaha and Brooklyn.Post Punk Kitchen's Isa Chandra Moskowitz Talks Opening Modern Love in Brooklyn Her first restaurant, Modern Love, opened in Omaha in 2014 and a second location opened in Brooklyn in 2016.

Activism
  
Moskowitz is a vocal opponent of "humane meat", promoting animal rights through what she calls "Culinary Activism" or "Baketivism":

After the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Moskowitz posted on her blog a call for vegans to host bake sales in their home cities to fundraise for relief which resulted in over $75,000 being raised.
