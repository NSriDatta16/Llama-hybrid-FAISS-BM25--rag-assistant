Arsenal of Megadeth is a DVD by American heavy metal band Megadeth, released on March 21, 2006 via Capitol. Presented as an anthology of the band's first 20 years, the two-disc DVD set contains music videos, live performances, interviews, home videos, and special appearances. As a result of licensing issues, videos from soundtrack and non-Capitol albums are not featured, save for "No More Mr. Nice Guy" and "Go to Hell" as well as despite being on Risk, "Crush 'Em" and "Breadline" were not included (though the former along with its accompanying album was also a soundtrack song it is unknown whether its exclusion was a result of the same reason as the other excluded soundtrack videos while reasons for the latter not being featured have never been disclosed). The album was certified gold in the United States and platinum in Canada.
