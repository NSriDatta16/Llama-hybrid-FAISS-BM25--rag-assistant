"Wolf at the Door" is a song performed and composed by English alternative rock band Keane and was the second single they released, originally intended only as a promo item with only fifty copies made, becoming the rarest Keane item in existence.

Recording started on 28 October 2000 and finished in May 2001 even though the record was originally planned to be released before 2001. The CD single was released by the band's own record label, Zoomorphic, in June 2001 and was sold at the pubs where Keane used to play. All fifty copies were handmade and recorded on CD-Rs.

Because of its limited production it is one of the most desired collectors' items amongst Keane fans, and has been known to sell for around Â£1000 on eBay. Its status as a rarity is such that, allegedly, no member of the band is in possession of a copy.

The single features a re-recording of their previous single "Call Me What You Like", as well as an early version of "She Has No Time", which would later appear on Hopes and Fears, the band's debut album.

Shortly after this record was released, guitarist Dominic Scott left the band, and was Keane's last release with a guitar as part of their instrumentation until the 2007 cover b-side "She Sells Sanctuary".

Information about song
The song was composed circa July 2000 and first played at the Monarch pub in Camden, London. It was recorded at Roundhouse Studios and Balfour Studios.

Musical structure
Most people would say the song is reminiscent to Coldplay's "Brothers & Sisters" due to the electric guitar entry in the F#sus4 key, similar to the Asus4 found in the latter.
However, the "epic and dreamlike" Keane sound is still found in the track, with Chaplin and Scott vocals, the guitarist backing.
"Wolf at the Door" is the only 6/8 time signature song by Keane to date.
