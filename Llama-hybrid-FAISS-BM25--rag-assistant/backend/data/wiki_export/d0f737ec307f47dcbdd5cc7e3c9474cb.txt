Basket Club Maritime Gravelines-Dunkerque, commonly referred to as BCM Gravelines-Dunkerque, is a French professional basketball club based in Gravelines. They currently play in the Pro A, the highest professional league in France. The team plays it home games at Sportica, which has a capacity for 3,043 people.

History
During the summer of 2012, Gravelines secured the services of a player who would become a club legend, Dwight Buycks. His teammates included Ludovic Vaty, JK Edwards, Ousmane Camara, and Yannick Bokolo, and they formed one of the greatest teams in the club's history.

Only real regret, this "Dream Team" will not go after the title of Champion of France, and will be eliminated in the 8th final.
But she will still win the "LeadersCup" formerly "Semaine des As" for the 2nd time in its history.

The 2020–21 season brought severe challenges as the club struggled with the Covid breaks plus had to compensate the injuries of key players such as Erik McCree and Briante Weber. Yet, the arrival of new head coach JD Jackson brought some victories so that the team was able to stay in the country's prime division.

For the 2021-2022 season, the club is extending coach JD Jackson. They sign during the summer players like Vafessa Fofana, Marcquise Reed, Brandon Taylor, Dominik Olejniczak.
The club will go to the 1/2 finals of the Coupe de France, and will finish in 12th place in the standings.

The 2022/2023 season will be a real challenge for the club, to finally get out of this negative spiral that has been rotating for several seasons.
The club announces the arrivals of players with big careers during the summer, such as JaJuan Johnson and DJ Seeley.
However, after 11 games, the club separated from coach JD Jackson and signed the former coach of Bourg, Laurent Legname!
The new coach will make an incredible rise in the standings, going from 15th place in November to 8th place for a time.
Only two players will leave the ship, and Kenny Boynton will replace DJ Seeley who returned to the EuroLeague at Bayern Munich.
Legname and his team will play their destiny in the Playoffs during the final day against SLUC Nancy.
But unfortunately the BCM failed by a few points at home, and will send Strasbourg to 8th place.
The rise in the standings is still exceptional for a club almost promised to descend into the 2nd division.

The return in the European Cup
On June 19, 2023, the club formalized the club's return to FIBA Europe Cup more than six years after their last appearance.
