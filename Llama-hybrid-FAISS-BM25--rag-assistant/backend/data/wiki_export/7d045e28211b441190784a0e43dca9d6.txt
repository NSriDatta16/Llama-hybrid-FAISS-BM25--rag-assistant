 |ShortSummary = After reconciling, Jeremy and Anastasia spend most of their time together playing separate games in Jeremy's apartment. Later, en route to meeting Doug, Jeremy must flee from a group of enthusiastic Pure Pwnage fans. Doug reveals that he is carrying his Sega Master Light Phaser, and displays that it is functional in RL. Suddenly, Teh_Masterer calls Jeremy from a nearby pay phone, telling him to go to the Netherlands.
Immediately, the scene switches to a council of mysterious people who discuss Teh_Masterer's training scheme.
Jeremy and Kyle visit the Netherlands using the money from the eBay auction of Jeremy's hair, where Jeremy engages in more micro training. This dangerous trip infuriates Jeremy, but pleases Teh_Masterer. An unrelated footage follows the episode where Jeremy makes fun of sheep by imitating "lol" (pronounced "lawl") like a sheep at forum user Skrie'''s farm.

 Season 2 (2007–08) 
The second season was released between 2007 and 2008, with 6 episodes currently released. The second season was put on hold due to the death of cast member Troy Dixon (T-Bag). In January 2011, a forum post by Jarett Cale explained, "After struggling to continue the web series myself, I've now placed it on indefinite hold. While this doesn't mean it's officially 'dead', that is unfortunately the most likely outcome."
