"Take Good Care of My Baby" is a song written by Carole King and Gerry Goffin. The song was made famous by Bobby Vee, when it was released in 1961.

Bobby Vee versions
While searching for material for Bobby Vee to record, Vee's producer Snuff Garrett heard a demo of Carole King singing "Take Good Care of My Baby". Garrett told publisher Don Kirshner that he wanted the song for Vee, but he believed the song needed an introductory verse. Garrett met with Carole King, and the introductory verse of Vee's version was written.

Among the musicians on the record were Barney Kessel, Tommy Allsup, and Howard Roberts on guitar, Clifford Hills on bass, Robert Florence on piano, and Earl Palmer on drums, while Sid Sharp did the string arrangements. The Johnny Mann Singers sang backup.

Bobby Vee released "Take Good Care of My Baby" as a single on July 20, 1961, and it was reviewed by Billboard in its issue dated July 31, 1961. Vee's recording quickly became popular, spending 15 weeks on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, reaching No. 1 on September 18, 1961, and spending three weeks in that position. The song became a major hit internationally as well, reaching No. 1 in Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.

The song was ranked No. 12 on Billboards "Hot 100 for 1961 – Top Sides of the Year" and No. 23 on Cash Boxs "Top 100 Chart Hits of 1961".

The song was the lead track on Bobby Vee's album, Take Good Care of My Baby, which was released in 1962.

Vee re-recorded the song as a ballad in 1972. He released under his real name, Robert Thomas Velline, on his 1972 album Ain't Nothing Like a Sunny Day, and as a single in 1973. However, it is his original version, along with Bobby Vinton's, that remain as staples of oldies radio stations.
