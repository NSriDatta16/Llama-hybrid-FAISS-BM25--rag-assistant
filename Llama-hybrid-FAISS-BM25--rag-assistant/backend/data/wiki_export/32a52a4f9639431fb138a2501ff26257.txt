History
Manx2 was launched on 11 May 2006, with services starting on 15 July. Its chairman was Noel Hayes. Manx2 was founded by the team who set up the Blue Islands airline, which serves the Channel Islands.

On 11 July 2006, Manx2 took delivery of its first chartered aircraft, a Let L-410 Turbolet painted in the new corporate colours of Manx2. The aircraft was initially operated by 'BASe Air Kft' (Budapest Air Services) under the call sign 'Base' and the flight code 'BPS'. The first three routes to be announced by Manx2 were from the Isle of Man to Belfast International and Blackpool on 15 July, followed by Leeds Bradford on 12 August 2006.

Manx2 introduced the BAe Jetstream 31 into its fleet in September 2006 with the aircraft being operated by Jetstream Executive Travel. Initially only one Jetstream 31 was added to the fleet to operate the Isle of Man to Leeds Bradford service.

Manx2 added a Fairchild Metroliner from Flightline BCN to its fleet for a period and extended its route network to include Belfast City. Routes to Belfast City and Blackpool were flown by two 19-seat turboprop Let L-410 aircraft from European operator VanAir Europe.

On 3 September 2007, Manx2 launched a new service connecting Manx2's base on the Isle of Man with Gloucestershire Airport, located at Staverton between Gloucester and Cheltenham, within an hour of major cities such as Birmingham and Bristol. This route sought to compete with Flybe's service to Birmingham. The route also had a seasonal extension to Jersey on Saturdays.

In 2008, Manx 2 added two Dornier 228 aircraft to its fleet and carried 100,000 passengers that year. A third Do 228 was added in 2009. In 2009, Manx2 announced it had carried its 250,000th passenger. It also announced an increased frequency of five flights daily on its main route from Blackpool and additional flights to Belfast City.

The flagship route to Blackpool was subsequently increased to ten flights per day after the company launched 15 days free parking for its customers at Blackpool airport, while the Belfast City flights surpassed the former Island flag carrier's numbers. A new base was established at Belfast City with additional frequency to the Isle of Man and Cork. The Leeds Bradford route also operated daily. The Gloucestershire route operated every weekday morning In August 2009 a new route was started to Newcastle upon Tyne, and in May 2010 the company tendered for a seven-month Public Service Obligation contract to operate the Cardiff–Isle of Anglesey route for the Welsh Assembly Government. This contract was subsequently extended for a further four years.

Shortly thereafter Manx2 launched a service from Galway to Belfast and the Isle of Man, and in September 2010 a twice daily service between Belfast and Cork was launched. This service ceased in March 2011 following an accident. and Manx2 ceased its leasing arrangement with Flightline BCN. Manx2 subsequently exited the domestic Irish market, cancelling its seasonal Belfast – Galway service. 

Services between Belfast City and Isle of Man were increased, and through Services to Gloucester (Staverton) from Belfast City were launched. The company also operated seasonal services between Isle of Man and Anglesey (Valley) Airport. A service to London Oxford airport was announced, and services began seven days a week starting May 2012 and this service continued through to January 2013.

On 22 November 2012, Manx2.com announced a buy-out of its business by Citywing Aviation Services Ltd, a new company formed by a management buyout team. Manx2's last flight took place on 31 December 2012. From 1 January 2013, all flights were transferred to Citywing.
