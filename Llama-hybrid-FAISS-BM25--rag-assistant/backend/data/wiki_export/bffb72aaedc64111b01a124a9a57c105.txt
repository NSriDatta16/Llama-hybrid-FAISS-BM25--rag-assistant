Summary
The Card Kingdom is a prominent land that is taken over by invaders and it is up to the Crown Knights to push back the invaders and protect their land with all their might.

This anime has very little fan service compared to the director's previous works and instead of the cute magical girl genre, the focus is more action-oriented with styles similar to a sh≈çnen series. Some of the characters and enemies are named after game pieces and cards to coincide with the theme.
