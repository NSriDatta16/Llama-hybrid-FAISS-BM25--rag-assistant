Yde () is a village in the municipality of Tynaarlo in the province of Drenthe in the Netherlands. It lies about 11Â km south of Groningen. Yde is twinned with De Punt as Yde-De Punt, however both remain separate villages.

Yde is known as the location near to where the bog body of the Yde Girl was discovered in 1897 and whose long hair has remained. She was strangled, and is on display in the Drents Museum.

The village was first mentioned 1206 as Ide. The etymology is unclear. Yde was home to 258 people in 1840. During World War II, there was a forced labour camp near Yde which mainly consisted of people arrest in neighbouring Friesland. The labourers had to build a defence line.
