NYSDA provides its members with a powerful presence in the New York State Legislature, business development programs, peer review, a clinical journal and educational and scientific programs that promote the art and science of dentistry. NYSDA is one of the largest state constituents of the American Dental Association and is composed of 13 local component societies.
