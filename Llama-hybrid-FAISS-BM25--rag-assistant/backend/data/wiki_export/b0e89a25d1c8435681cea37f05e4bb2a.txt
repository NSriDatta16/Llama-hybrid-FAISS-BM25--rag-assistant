Two Great Guitars is a studio album by Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry, released in August 1964 by Checker Records, a subsidiary of Chess Records. It was the first studio album issued by Berry after his release from prison in October 1963.

Diddley and Berry were friends, and both recorded for Chess. The album consists of two lengthy spontaneous instrumental jams and a few recently recorded instrumentals by the two guitarists; additional instrumental recordings, three by Diddley and one by Berry, are included in the compact disc reissue. The album cover shows a Gibson ES-350T owned by Berry and a guitar created by Diddley.
