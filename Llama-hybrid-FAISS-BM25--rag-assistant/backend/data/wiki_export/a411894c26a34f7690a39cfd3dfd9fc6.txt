Plot
Govindan is a thief who has two sons: Aadhi and Mathi. Years go by and the brothers decide to stop stealing, mend their ways, and lead a hardworking life with their father. They migrate to a neighboring village and meet a retired agricultural officer Chidambaram, who is in deep debt and is under pressure from the village landlord Kalingarayar to clear his debts. In efforts to help Chidambaram, Mathi confronts Seetha Lakshmi, Kalingarayar's daughter, who comes to collect the money Chidambaram owes her father. Seetha Lakshmi starts to acquire a liking for Mathi, but keeps it hidden due to her father's atrocious temper. In an attempt to teach Kalingarayar a lesson, Mathi forcibly ties the mangalsutram around Seetha's neck. Kalingarayar, realizing his daughter's love for Mathi, comes down to arrange a grand remarriage between the two. But things go awry when Manicka Vel, Seetha Lakshmi's maternal uncle, comes to town in an effort to stop the wedding between the two as he has wicked plans of marrying her and usurping her family fortune.

Reception
Sify wrote:"The major flaw of Majaa is its wafer-thin story and screenplay, a mediocre subject to be remade from Malayalam, sic the film gives you a dreary sense of déjà vu, a feeling that one has seen it before". A critic from Chennai Online wrote that "'Thomanum Makkalum', the film's original Malayalam version, in which Mammootty starred, had some perfect casting for the trio. But here the combination of Vikram, Pasupathi and Manivannan somehow fails to jell together as a team". A critic from Behindwoods wrote that "On seeing the movie spectators are enfolded with action, comedy, love, and emotion. Members of the family can sit together and enjoy this movie". A critic from webindia123 wrote that "Overall it is a clean family entertainer worth a watch". A critic from Kungumam called the film a Tamil film from a Malayalam origin made in a Telugu style and added that the film can be enjoyed in theatres during Diwali if you watch the film ignoring the pre-release hype.
