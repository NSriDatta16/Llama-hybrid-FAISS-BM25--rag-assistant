History 
The evolution of the Belizean university can be traced over a 22
-year period beginning in 1977 with the establishment of the Committee for Sixth Form Studies in response to emerging concerns regarding the relevance of existing tertiary education, and ending in the year 2000 with a second attempt to coordinate and rationalize Belizean higher or tertiary education. During this time, the evolution of the university resulted in the establishment of three institutions: the Belize College of Arts, Sciences and Technology, the University College of Belize, and the University of Belize.

Previous attempts at national universities 
Belizean nationalists long wished to decolonize the educational system and rely less on foreign academic institutions. In 1979 the ruling People's United Party (PUP) established the Belize College of Arts, Science, and Technology (BELCAST) as a state institution free of church involvement. The government secured funds from the European Economic Community for construction of a campus in Belmopan, but the campus was never built. On February 24, 1986, it was announced at a meeting of the National Council on Education that BELCAST would be closed. The rival United Democratic Party assumed power in December 1984 and later established an alternative college—the University College of Belize—in July 1986, created and maintained by Ferris State College of Big Rapids, Michigan. Nationalists were dismayed that the new University College of Belize would be administered by non-Belizeans. Intense political controversy arose in 1991 when it was discovered that the university had not been properly accredited, calling into question the value of its degrees. A new PUP government severed its agreement with Ferris State College, and the state of Belize assumed full control over the university.

Amalgamation 

The University of Belize was established in August 2000 as an amalgamation of five tertiary-level institutions: Bliss School of Nursing, Belize Technical College, Belize Teachers' College, University College of Belize, and Belize School of Agriculture. Except for the last one, all institutions forming UB were located in Belize City; UCB had established a college affiliate in Belmopan.
