Work with James Corden

Since working on the BBC sitcom Gavin & Stacey, Horne has collaborated a number of times with its co-creator James Corden.

Horne and Corden presented the Big Brother spin-off show Big Brother's Big Mouth as guests in 2007 and were then regulars for the run covering E4's Big Brother: Celebrity Hijack. They presented the NME Shockwaves Awards together in 2008 and a section of Comic Relief in March 2009. In 2008, the pair toured the UK with a stand-up show in preparation for their BBC sketch show Horne & Corden. The first episode was broadcast on 10 March 2009 on BBC Three. It was presented in front of a live audience, in a style reminiscent of Morecambe and Wise or The Two Ronnies. A variety of pre-filmed sketches and live performances were included.

2009 also saw the release of Lesbian Vampire Killers, a comedy horror film. Reviews of the film were largely negative. It holds a 29% approval rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes with an average score of 4/10. James Christopher of The Times described it as "profoundly awful", stating that it is an "instantly forgettable lads' mag farce" and an "appalling waste of a perfectly decent title". Allan Hunter of the Daily Express called it "badly written and hastily executed" and "takes all the easy options of bad taste, bosoms and body fluids". Anthony Quinn, writing in The Independent, gave the film 1 star out of 5, describing it as woeful and stating Horne and Corden had "overstretched their appeal" and looked in danger of becoming today's Hale and Pace. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian described the film as "mostly pretty awful, but there are one or two crass laughs".

Nicholas Yanes of Scifipulse.net found it to be "a great B film" worth becoming a cult classic. In September 2010, whilst on the comedy panel show, The King is Dead, Corden commented that watching the film would be too harsh a punishment for prisoners being held at Guantanamo Bay and that it was "a pile of shit".

Horne appeared alongside Corden in the CGI film Planet 51, with a minor part voicing a soldier, Vesklin.

Personal life
Horne splits his time between East London and Helmsdale in the Scottish Highlands. He is a fan of Tottenham Hotspur F.C. and has often been seen at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Horne is also the narrator of the stadium's multi media tour device. 

On 20 December 2018, Horne was struck by a train as he was crossing the railway line near to his parents' home in Burton Joyce, Nottinghamshire. Horne was said not to have been injured and had been near a dedicated pedestrian crossing across the Nottingham to Newark railway line.

Horne was engaged to actress Evelyn Hoskins until 2018. Horne married set-designer Celina Bassili in September 2021, in Norway. They had been romantically linked since July 2019.
