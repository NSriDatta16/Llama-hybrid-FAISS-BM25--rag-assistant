"Up the Bracket" is a song by the Libertines, released in September 2002. It is their second overall single and their first from the debut album Up the Bracket.

The song alludes to London street crime, and tells the story of a romantic couple who refuse to become informants for a pair of gangsters, the gangsters might be an allusion to the Kray Twins, since the Kray family lived in 178 Vallance Road; and the danger that this decision creates.The title is a slang term used by comedian Tony Hancock for a punch to the throat; while "two crooked fingers" refers to the V-sign. "Joseph bloody in the hole" is a reference to Genesis, chapter 37.

In May 2007, NME magazine placed "Up the Bracket" at number 47 in its list of the 50 Greatest Indie Anthems Ever.
