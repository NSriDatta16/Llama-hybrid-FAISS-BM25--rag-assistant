Economy 
Lignite mining and a lignite-fired thermal power plant are the main economic activities in Soma. During World War I the mines were opened up for production. The lignite extracted during that time was described as being of "very bad" quality. That lignite was burned with German coal for trains in the region. A small portion was exported to İzmir. A just transition from coal could be supported by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.

The Soma Wind Farm, with 119 wind turbines and an installed total capacity of 140.4 MW, is one of Turkey's largest wind farms.

Olive, walnut and almond cultivation is among the important agricultural activities of Soma.
