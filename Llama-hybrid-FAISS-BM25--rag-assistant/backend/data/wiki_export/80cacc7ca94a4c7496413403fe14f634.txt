Red Hot + Bothered (also known as  Red Hot + Bothered: The Indie Rock Guide Book to Dating) is an anthology of the indie rock scene from the 1990s produced by Paul Heck. It was released as part of the Red Hot AIDS Benefit Series.

The recording initially appeared as a pair of 10" EP recordings bundled with limited edition fanzines, and spoofing dating guides. Also included was advice from well-known artists and freelancing writers aimed at reaching the jaded youth in the audience on a variety of issues; these include relationships, love, sex and the impact of AIDS on such matters.

The EP recordings were eventually followed-up by a fullâ€“length CD which included several tracks absent on the vinyl EP's.
