He was with Burton Albion between 2007 and 2010, helping the "Brewers" to the Conference National title in 2008–09, though also played on loan for both Barrow and Kidderminster Harriers. He switched to Barrow permanently in 2010, spending one season with the club, before he joined Gresley in 2011. In his first season with the "Moatmen", he helped the club to win the Midland Football Alliance title. He joined King's Lynn Town in November 2013, before joining Worksop Town in January 2014 and then Mickleover Sports two months later.

Career
Marc started his playing career with Stoke City in 2000, the following year he found himself in Iceland with ÍBV Vestmannaeyjar, the Icelandic connection with the Potteries club being strong at the time with Stoke being owned by an Icelandic consortium. Upon his return he managed to appear fairly regular for the "Potters", as he played twelve games in his debut season.

He began to make his mark in the 2001–02 campaign, putting in 29 appearances across all competitions. He did not play in the club's Second Division play-off final success, though he did make 20 First Division appearances in the subsequent 2002–03 season.

He made only a handful of appearances at the Britannia Stadium in 2003–04, though he earned a £50,000 move to Bristol City in the January transfer window. He played in the play-off final defeat to Brighton & Hove Albion, replacing defender Tony Butler on 88 minutes as manager Danny Wilson made a late attempt to save the game. He did not feature heavily at Ashton Gate and instead was loaned out to Port Vale in October 2004. The next month Swansea City manager Kenny Jackett was on the lookout for a quality winger, Goodfellow meanwhile was prepared to go out on loan to the League Two club. Jackett managed to persuade City to allow Goodfellow to join the "Swans" on loan. He impressed at the Welsh club and his loan spell was extended the following month. However, he was quickly recalled to Ashton Gate after a spate of injuries at the Bristol club. Soon after Swansea attempted to buy Goodfellow off City, however, City manager Brian Tinnion informed Goodfellow he still had a future at the club. Tinnion was expecting at least what they paid Stoke for him and Swansea were unable to comply. In March 2005 he joined Colchester United on loan until the end of the season and scored once against Peterborough United.

In May 2005, Swansea again admitted their interest in the young winger, and the following month they finally got their man, ending months of speculation. Goodfellow said he was delighted with the move and that his "heart was always set on Swansea". His thirteen appearances proved to be something of an anti-climax, and so Goodfellow left Swansea, now in League One, to join Grimsby Town in February 2006. He played for the "Mariners" in the 2006 Football League Two play-off final at the Millennium Stadium, which ended in a 1–0 defeat to Cheltenham Town. He scored once during his spell at Grimsby in a 1–1 draw with Shrewsbury Town.

In the summer of 2006 Goodfellow joined Bury on a free transfer, before leaving in November 2006. He dropped out of the English Football League to sign for Conference National side Burton Albion in January 2007. He made 36 appearances in the 2007–08 season, helping them to a fifth-place finish. The 2008–09 would prove much more successful, as Goodfellow made 29 league appearances to help Burton finish as Conference champions, and therefore win promotion into the Football League.

In November 2009 Goodfellow returned to the Conference, signing with Barrow on a month-long loan, he made just two appearances for the club. On transfer-deadline day he joined Kidderminster Harriers on loan for the rest of the season. He was released from Burton at the end of the 2009–10 season, and returned to Barrow for the following season. After nineteen appearances in 2010–11, he was released by Barrow in May 2011. Goodfellow joined Midland Football Alliance side Gresley in August 2011. He helped the "Moatmen" to the league title in 2011–12. Gresley finished 11th in the Northern Premier League Division One South in 2012–13.

In November 2013 Goodfellow moved up a division to join King's Lynn Town. He stayed at King's Lynn for two months before joining Worksop Town on 2 January 2014. On 28 March 2014 Goodfellow moved to Mickleover Sports. Mickleover finished the 2013–14 season in the play-off places, but were beaten by Belper Town in the play-off final. In June 2014, Goodfellow joined Nottingham side Basford United. United won the Midland League in 2014–15.
