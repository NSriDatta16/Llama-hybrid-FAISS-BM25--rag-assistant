Goat is the second studio album by The Jesus Lizard, released in 1991. The album was produced by Steve Albini.

Its cover art, by bassist David Wm. Sims, at first glance resembles a flame, but is actually a topless woman with a close-up image of nails projected onto her body. The rear of the album, and several panels of the enclosed CD booklet include similar pictures of the same naked woman, with different images projected onto her body.

Critical reception

In 2003, Goat was ranked as the 38th best album of the 1990s by the online magazine Pitchfork.
