Forest Hills Local School District is a public school district serving the southeasternmost area of Hamilton County, Ohio outside the city of Cincinnati.  The district specifically serves approximately 7,600 students from Anderson Township and the village of Newtown. There are 1,008 staff members working for the district.

The district has been rated excellent or excellent with distinction for the 12 consecutive years based on the State Report Card. It consists of nine schools:

The student progression from elementary to middle to high school in Forest Hills is noteworthy. There are six neighborhood elementary schools, all of which feed Nagel Middle School. Nagel students are then again divided based on their home addresses between the two high schools.  Anderson High School gets all students from Ayer, Maddux and Summit Elementaries.  Turpin gets all students from Wilson and Mercer Elementaries.  Sherwood Elementary students are split between Anderson and Turpin, depending on street address; students on a few designated "swing" streets may choose either high school.

Forest Hills School District has also been the subject of public criticism following their decision to ban "anti-racism" teachings in schools.   Board member Sara Jonas was quoted as saying the measure was brought forward "just to make sure that both sides are always being taught to the students".
