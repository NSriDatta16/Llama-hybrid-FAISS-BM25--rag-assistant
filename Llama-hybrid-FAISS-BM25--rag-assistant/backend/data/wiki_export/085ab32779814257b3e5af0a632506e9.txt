August Kluckhohn (6 July 1832 – 19 May 1893) was a German historian, born at Bavenhausen in Lippe.

He studied at the University of Heidelberg as a pupil of Ludwig Häusser, and at the University of Göttingen, where he was influenced by Georg Waitz. In 1858 he went to Munich to become editor of the "critical division" of Sybel's Historische Zeitschrift. He became an instructor in history at the University of Munich in 1860, five years later being promoted to associate professor. In 1869, he was appointed a full professor of history at the Polytechnic School in Munich, and in 1883 he returned to Göttingen as a successor to historian Reinhold Pauli.
