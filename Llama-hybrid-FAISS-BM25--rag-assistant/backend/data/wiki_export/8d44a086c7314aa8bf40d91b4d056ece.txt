Critical reception 
Allmovie gave the film a mildly favorable review, writing "Sean Cunningham's first post-Friday the 13th film was shrugged off by most critics, but it is better than its reputation might lead one to believe." Janet Maslin of The New York Times thought the film is "a lot better" than  Friday the 13th, and noted: "The story offers a few surprises, and the bowels of the railway station are scenic, in their grubby way."
