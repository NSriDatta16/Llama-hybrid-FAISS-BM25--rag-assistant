Sikalongo is a rural community in the Southern Province of Zambia.  It is located 30Â km east-south-east of Choma in the Singani Chieftaincy, not far from the Zambezi Escarpment north-west of Lake Kariba.  It existed as a traditional community until the early twentieth century when American missionaries from the Brethren in Christ Church established a mission station there.  During the first half of the twentieth century, missionaries established a church, a clinic, and a primary school.  In 1968, the Brethren in Christ church established a Bible Institute which continues to the present.  With help from the local community, the mission station established a secondary school during the 1970s.
