History 
Vilna was founded in 1907, mostly by central European settlers. By 1918, the settlers were calling the larger district Vilna, after the Lithuanian capital city of Vilnius (). The main community started to coalesce in 1919, when the railroad reached the area and the first grain elevator was built. The "Villette" post office, located two miles east, was relocated to the growing community in 1920, at which time the community was officially named Vilna. That same year, the first schoolhouse was built. Vilna was incorporated as a village on June 13, 1923.

On February 5, 1967, Vilna experienced a meteor air burst with a yield estimated at 600 tonnes of TNT (2.5 TJ). Subsequently, two very small meteorite fragments were found â€“  and  which are now stored at University of Alberta, in Edmonton.
