Royal Albert Hall October 10, 1997 is a live album by space rock group Spiritualized from their 1997 tour of the United Kingdom, recorded during an October show at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The album was released in late 1998.

This was the last album recorded with the original Spiritualized line-up before frontman Jason Pierce sacked every member apart from keyboardist Thighpaulsandra and saxophonist Ray Dickaty.

The six-piece band are joined by a horn section, string quartet and members of the London Community Gospel Choir on disc two, with 19 members in total. This expanded version of Spiritualized headlined Glastonbury in 1998, and was also filmed on Later... with Jools Holland. This orchestral line-up signalled the dense musical style to come on their next album Let It Come Down, released 3 years later.

The majority of the setlist comes from Ladies And Gentlemen We Are Floating In Space, their third album, with some material from their previous albums, Lazer Guided Melodies and Pure Phase. "Walking With Jesus" was a Spacemen 3 song from The Perfect Prescription, but Pierce has performed it throughout his career. Here is its second official live release, the first being on the limited edition live release Fucked Up Inside in 1993.
