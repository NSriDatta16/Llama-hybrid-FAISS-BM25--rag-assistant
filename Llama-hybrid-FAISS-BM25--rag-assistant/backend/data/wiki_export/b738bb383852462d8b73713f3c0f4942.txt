The Anthology: 1947–1972 is a double compilation album by Chicago blues singer and guitarist Muddy Waters. It contains many of his best-known songs, including his R&B single chart hits "I'm Your Hoochie Coochie Man", "Just Make Love to Me (I Just Want to Make Love to You)", and "I'm Ready". Chess and MCA Records released the set on August 28, 2001.

Reception and awards
In his review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted "if you're going to be buying two discs to get the full Muddy Waters story, you should get this instead of two separate discs, since it's simply easier.".

In 2020, the album was ranked number 483 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time: "the fifty essential cuts... run from guitar-and-standup-bass duets to full-band rompsand they still just manage to scratch the surface of Waters' legacy,"

Track listing
