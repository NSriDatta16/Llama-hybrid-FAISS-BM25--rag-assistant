The Tanjong Pagar Group Representation Constituency is a five-member Group Representation Constituency (GRC) in Central and Western Singapore. The five divisions consists: Buona Vista, Queenstown, Moulmein-Cairnhill, Tanjong Pagar-Tiong Bahru and Henderson-Dawson. The current Members of Parliament are Chan Chun Sing, Joan Pereira, Alvin Tan, Eric Chua and Indranee Rajah from the People's Action Party (PAP).

History
This GRC came into formation in 1991, when it absorbed the Tiong Bahru GRC, Telok Blangah SMC and Tanjong Pagar SMC. Since the formation of the GRC, the ward was notable for its repeated walkovers. The last walkover was in 2011 when Tanjong Pagar GRC became the only constituency to be uncontested following the disqualification of a team of independent candidates (which led by Ng Teck Siong) as they submitted their nomination papers 35 seconds late.

Members of Parliament

Lee died on 23 March 2015 due to pneumonia. No by-elections were called as it was a GRC and Rajah served as a temporary MP for the ward until the general elections in September that year.
