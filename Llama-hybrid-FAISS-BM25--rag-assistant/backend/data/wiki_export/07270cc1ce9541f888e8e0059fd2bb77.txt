The National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Assamese is one of the National Film Awards presented annually by the Directorate of Film Festivals, the organisation set up by Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, India. It is one of several awards presented for feature films and awarded with Rajat Kamal (Silver Lotus).

The National Film Awards, established in 1954, are the most prominent film awards in India that merit the best of the Indian cinema. The ceremony also presents awards for films in various regional languages.

Awards for films in seven regional language (Bengali, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Tamil and Telugu) started from 2nd National Film Awards which were presented in 1955. Three awards of "President's Silver Medal for Best Feature Film", "Certificate of Merit for the Second Best Feature Film" and "Certificate of Merit for the Third Best Feature Film" were instituted. The later two certificate awards were discontinued from 15th National Film Awards (1967).

The films made in Assamese language were not considered until the 3rd National Film Awards ceremony held in September 1956. However, only Certificate of Merit was issued in this ceremony as no film was found suitable for the "President's Silver Medal". The 1955 Phani Sarma directorial film Piyali Phukan received the first Certificate of Merit. Later in the 6th National Film Awards the 1958 film Ronga Police, directed by Nip Barua, became the first film to receive the president's silver medal for Best Feature Film in Assamese.
