Sixways Stadium is a stadium in Worcester, England.  It is currently used for rugby union and association football matches and is the home stadium of Premier 15s side Worcester Warriors Women and  football side Worcester Raiders. Prior to their administration and suspension from Premiership Rugby it was also home of Worcester Warriors. The stadium is able to hold 12,067 with parking for 1,000 cars, Sixways has 60 modern meeting and event rooms . The ground opened in 1975 and is located off junction 6 of the M5 motorway, which splits into six directions, hence the name Sixways. The Stadium commenced building on the site of the old 3rd team pitch and club house after a lottery grant in 1998.

On 7 April 2016 it was announced that Sixways' pitch would be converted to the latest technology artificial grass ahead of the 2016–17 season. Sixways would become the third Premiership Rugby venue with an artificial pitch after Copthall stadium and Kingston Park but the first to feature organic infill rather than rubber crumb.
