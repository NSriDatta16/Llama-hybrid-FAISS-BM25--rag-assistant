Tipperary is a parliamentary constituency that has been represented in Dáil Éireann, the lower house of the Irish parliament or Oireachtas, since the 2016 general election. The constituency elects 5 deputies (Teachtaí Dála, commonly known as TDs) on the system of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote (PR-STV). A constituency of the same name existed between 1923 and 1948.

History and boundaries

The constituency was created under the Electoral Act 1923, and was first used at the 1923 general election, incorporating the separate counties of North Tipperary and South Tipperary. It was abolished in 1948.

The Constituency Commission proposed in its 2012 report that at the next general election a new constituency called Tipperary be created, as part of changes that reduced the total number of TDs from 166 to 158. This occurred in 2016, shortly after the administrative amalgamation in 2014 of the separate counties to form County Tipperary.

Elections

2020 general election

On 3 February 2020, following the death of independent candidate, Marese Skehan, the election in the Tipperary constituency was due to be postponed, with nominations to be re-opened. However, on 5 February the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government issued a Special Difficulty Order allowing the election to proceed on the same date as other constituencies. This was in consideration of the constitutional requirement that elections take place within 30 days of the dissolution of the Dáil.
