History
A possible Iron Age or Roman enclosure was  north-east from the present village, identified by aerial photography, and at the north and south of the village is evidence of medieval earthworks, field boundaries, ponds, trackways, and ridges and furrows. Less than  west of the village is the site of St Philips Well, a medieval water spring.

Keyingham is listed in the 1086 Domesday Book as in the Hundred of Holderness, with 31 households, 30 villagers, one priest and a church. Eight ploughlands and  of meadow are recorded. In 1066 Thorfridh held the lordship, this transferred by 1086 to Drogo of la Beuvri√ãre, who was also Tenant-in-chief to King William I.

In 1823, Keyingham (or Kyingham) was a civil parish in the Wapentake and Liberty of Holderness. The patronage of the ecclesiastical parish and church was under the Archbishop of York. In 1802, the interest from a bequest of 200 shillings was left for the education of poor parish children of 'Kayingham', administered by the churchwardens, and the incumbent who held his post as a perpetual curate. Parish population in 1823 was 639. Occupations included eight farmers, two blacksmiths, two wheelwrights, four grocers, a corn miller, six shoemakers, two tailors, one of whom was also a draper, a bricklayer who was also the parish clerk, a school master, the landlord of The Blue Bell and the landlady of The Gate public houses. Two carriers operated between the village and Hull twice weekly.

Keyingham was served from 1854 to 1964 by Keyingham railway station on the Hull and Holderness Railway.

Education
The village has one primary school, Keyingham Primary School. It was opened to pupils at the beginning of the 2007 school year, replacing the former infant school on the same site. The new school combines the former junior and infant schools, the junior school being based in a former board school building across the road which closed in 2006. The schools serve children from Keyingham and the neighbouring village of Ottringham just over  to the east.
