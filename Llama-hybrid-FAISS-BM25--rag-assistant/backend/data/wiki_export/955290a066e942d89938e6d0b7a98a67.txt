Fuzön ( – literal English pronunciation: "fusion") is a pop rock band from Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan formed in 2001. The name was derived from fusion, as the former lead vocalist of the band, Shafqat Amanat Ali describes the band as a fusion of Hindustani classical and modern soft rock music blended with the Sufi Style of singing.

Fuzön encompasses hybrid styles of pop and rock instrumentation. "Fuzon was one of the innovative bands of the new millennium, as they gave us a timeless album like Saagar."

History
Shallum Asher Xavier and Imran Momina were the founding members, who decided to put their heads together as they realised the similarities between their musical ideas and tastes.

Meanwhile, Shafqat Amanat Ali, who had been singing for a few years, had happened to drop into Immo's recording studio for an assignment. Shafqat's vocals so impressed the duo, that he was signed up with Shallum and Immu to form the band "Fuzön". "The year 2011 marks the 10th anniversary of the three-member band that has made a significant contribution to Pakistani music."

Shafqat had to leave the band to concentrate more on his solo projects. He was replaced by Rameez Mukhtar, the main vocalist in 2011.
