Biography

Charlotte Knobloch was born in Munich, in 1932, into a well-to-do Jewish family of lawyers. She is the daughter of Munich lawyer and Bavarian senator Fritz Neuland. Her mother Margarethe was a born Christian, but converted to Judaism upon marrying Neuland. However, her parents divorced in 1936. She was subsequently raised by her grandmother Albertine Neuland. Upon the arrest of her father, Knobloch was saved by the former housekeeper of the Neuland family, who took her in her hand and brought her to her Christian family in Franconia, pretending she was her own illegitimate daughter.

Charlotte Neuland married the late Samuel Knobloch in 1951, and has three children.

One of her achievements is the Jewish Centre () in Munich, with a new principal Ohel Jakob synagogue and a Jewish museum. She was made an honorary citizen of Munich in 2005.

Knobloch is especially concerned with the problem of antisemitism in Eastern Europe. In the World Jewish Congress, she works to promote the German-speaking Jewish communities and to build bridges to Jewish communities in other countries. She took a controversial stand against the Stolpersteine in Munich, stumbling blocks on pavement inscribed with the name and life dates of victims of Nazi extermination or persecution, effectively blocking their collocation on public grounds until today.

In January 2009, she claimed that the Central Council was temporarily breaking off contact with the Roman Catholic Church because of the lifting of the excommunication of controversial bishop Richard Williamson.
