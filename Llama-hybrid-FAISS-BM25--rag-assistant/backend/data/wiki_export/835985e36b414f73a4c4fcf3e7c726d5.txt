The Gold Star Memorial Bridge is a pair of steel truss bridges that carry both Interstate 95 and U.S. Route 1 across the Thames River between New London, Connecticut, US and Groton, Connecticut. The bridge is the largest structure in the state with more than  of deck area, and the longest bridge in the state at . Its 11 highway lanes accommodate an average daily traffic of 117,000 vehicles. The bridge is actually a set of twin bridges, but they are generally spoken of using the singular "bridge;" the local media and residents refer to it as "The Goldstar".

History

The current south span (northbound) of the bridge was completed in 1943 as a single span carrying traffic in both directions. It was part of Southeastern Connecticut's "free span" highway, a short  long four-lane stretch connecting New London to Groton, Connecticut. As part of the new highway, the bridge's purpose was to remove automobiles from a previous bridge that carried U.S. Route 1 over the Thames River.  In 1951, the bridge was designated as the Gold Star Memorial Bridge in honor of members of the Armed Forces from Groton, New London, and Waterford who lost their lives during  World War I, World War II, and the Korean War.

In 1958, the Route 1 bypass containing the Gold Star Bridge was connected to the Connecticut Turnpike by extending west to what is today the interchange of Interstates 95 and 395 in East Lyme. East of the bridge, a  bypass of Route 184 was completed to the Rhode Island border on December 12, 1964, officially making the bridge and both bypasses part of Interstate 95. The stretch of I-95 containing the bridge is known as the Jewish War Veterans Memorial Highway.

During construction of the north span (southbound) on July 1, 1972, the US Coast Guard Academy's three-masted barque  was involved in a serious accident with the bridge as she was returning to her berth in New London. The ship's foremast and mainmast caught the safety netting slung below the new bridge, despite extensive precautions, as she passed below the original span and the new span being built parallel to it. Both masts were snapped off about seven-eighths of the way up, the upper parts left hanging dangerously from the remaining upright masts. The ship had to undergo emergency repairs as a result.

The bridge's second span was completed in 1973.

In 1975, the south span was partially rebuilt, and it carries northbound traffic.

2023 fire 

On April 21, 2023 a truck carrying heating oil collided with a vehicle on the southbound bridge, killing one person, the driver of the oil truck, and injuring at least two more. The crash dumped approximately 2,200 gallons of oil onto the bridge, which caught on fire. Initially, authorities believed the fire spread to buildings below the bridge, although later stated that it only spread to adjacent brush. The fire was initially reported as a one alarm fire however at 11:07 AM it was raised to a two alarm. Following the crash, the Connecticut Department of Transportation shut down the southbound bridge to traffic, awaiting for engineers to confirm the bridge's structural integrity. The bridge reopened to automobile traffic later that day. The pedestrian/cyclist section of the bridge remained closed, giving those users no way to cross the Thames River. It took 23 days of this closure before announcement of shuttle service provided to pedestrians and cyclists, which would be available 6 AM until 5 PM, daily.

Design
The design is a pair of steel cantilever bridges, each composed of eleven spans.

The posted traffic speed limit is 55 miles  per hour.

The newer southbound (north) span has a sidewalk/bike path on the north side of the bridge, accessible from Bridge St and Riverview Ave on the Groton side and Williams Street on the New London side.
