The Wales national women's football team () represents Wales in international football. It is controlled by the Football Association of Wales (FAW), the governing body for football in Wales and the third-oldest national football association in the world, founded in .

The team has never qualified for the FIFA Women's World Cup or the UEFA European Women's Championship. They most recently came the closest they ever have to qualifying for their first ever FIFA Women's World Cup going all the way to the FIFA Women's World Cup UEFA play-off final before falling to a 2–1 defeat at the fate of an opposition last minute winner in extra time against the Switzerland women's national football team.

All of Welsh women's football clubs play in the Welsh women's football league system. Wales, as a country of the United Kingdom, is not a member of the International Olympic Committee and therefore the national team does not compete in the Olympic Games.

Colours and logo
The primary kit has long been all-red. The crest of the Football Association of Wales features a rampant Welsh Dragon on a white shield. From 1920, the shield was surrounded by a red border, and the letters 'FAW' were added in 1926. The badge was redesigned in 1951, adding a green border with 11 daffodils, as well as the Welsh-language motto Gorau Chwarae Cyd Chwarae ("The best play is team play"). The motto was briefly removed in 1984, but the badge stayed largely the same until 2010, when the shield was changed to feature rounded sides and the motto banner was changed from white to red and green. The dragon also changed from rampant to rampant regardant. The motto was removed again in 2019, following another major redesign of the badge, which saw the top of the shield flattened and the sides changed not to curve outwards; the green border was also thinned and the daffodils removed.
