My Bare Lady is a 2006 United Kingdom-based reality TV show that aired on the Fox Reality Channel.  The series followed four American female pornographic stars as they took acting lessons and performed in scenes from classic drama alongside British actors in London's West End.  The show was hosted by British actor/director Christopher Biggins and the women were trained by Biggins and various other British theatre professionals, including Louie Spence of Pineapple Dance Studios fame.

The show is named after a 1963 film whose title is a pun recalling the Pygmalion-inspired musical My Fair Lady by Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe, popularized in a film adaptation starring Audrey Hepburn.

The show placed four adult entertainment stars in the same house for a month in Los Angeles and adopted a reality format similar to the first season to provide an in depth look at the daily goings on.  The cast competed in a series of tasks and challenges under the tutelage of top business coach Mike Mataraza in preparation for leading an existing business for one week.
