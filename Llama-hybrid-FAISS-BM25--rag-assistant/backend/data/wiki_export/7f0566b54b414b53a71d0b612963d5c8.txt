WCBZ-CD (channel 22) is a low-power Class A television station in Columbus, Ohio, United States, affiliated with the digital multicast network Cozi TV. The station is owned by the Columbus Broadcasting Corporation.

History
WCBZ-CD was founded as W22AE in Marion, Ohio, on April 17, 1989. The station then changed its call letters to WBKA-LP in 1995. In 2004, the station was acquired from low-power broadcaster, Crawford Broadcasting by Metro Video Productions, and was granted Class A status, thus changing its callsign to WBKA-CA.

In 2008, the station was acquired by Studio 51 Multimedia Productions, Ltd., and began operating as TV 22 Marion, offering comprehensive coverage of the events in the Marion County area, as well as other original programming. In August 2009, the WBKA-CA call sign was changed to WMNO-CA (for "Marion, Ohio").

In 2015, the station was purchased by Positive News Network, Inc. at which point it took on its current network affiliation.

In 2017, the call sign changed again to WCBZ-CD (for "Columbus Broadcasting") to better reflect its new ownership by Columbus Broadcasting Corporation.

In Marion, WCBZ-CD had been carried on Time Warner Cable (now Charter Spectrum) channel 3 (with cable box) or channel 96 (without cable box), but the station was removed from the Marion channel lineup on May 8, 2018.
