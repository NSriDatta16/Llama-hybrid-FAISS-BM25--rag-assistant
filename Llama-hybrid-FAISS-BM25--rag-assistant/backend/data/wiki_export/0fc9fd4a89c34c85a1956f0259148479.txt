Riverstage was officially opened on 7 September 1989 by Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Sallyanne Atkinson. It was inspired by the temporary Riverstage used for World Expo '88 a year earlier. The venue formerly hosted the touring Soundwave festival; having its first show there in 2007 and returning in 2008. Brisbane band Powderfinger performed their final show at the venue in November 2010.

Some of the most notable performances at Riverstage is the annual Carols by Candlelight event held every December and Daft Punk's Alive 2006-2007 Tour which they performed in December 2007. In 2011, a Queensland Relief Concert was held in which the Foo Fighters played to a sold-out crowd.  The benefit concert was held in aid of victims of the 2010â€“2011 Queensland floods.  Gigantour used the stage on multiple occasions.
