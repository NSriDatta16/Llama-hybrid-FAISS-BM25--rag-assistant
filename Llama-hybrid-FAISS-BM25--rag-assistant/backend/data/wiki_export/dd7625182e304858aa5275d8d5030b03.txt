Semiahmoo Secondary School ( ) is a public high school in South Surrey, British Columbia, and is part of School District 36 Surrey. It was founded in 1940 as the first senior secondary school in South Surrey. The school serves grades eight through twelve.

Semiahmoo is one of four public high schools on the peninsula, along with Earl Marriott Secondary School, Elgin Park Secondary School and Grandview Heights Secondary School.

The school is named after the indigenous Semiahmoo people.

History 
Before 1940, students from White Rock and Surrey were educated at Surrey High School in Cloverdale or Blaine High School in the state of Washington in the United States. Overcrowding at Surrey High School led to petitions for a new school; by the time the new school opened students were spread to the basement of Rock Public School, and the Campbell River Saw Mill Office. A three storey wood frame building was constructed in White Rock with 14 classrooms, a library, an Industrial Education shop, and a 50 by 80 feet gym with a large stage at the south end; it opened in November 29, 1940 as Semiahmoo. The building was expanded in the late-1950s and 1960s to alleviate overcrowding; the opening of White Rock Junior High and Douglas College providing additional relief.

In 1989, Semiahmoo High School absorbed White Rock Junior High to become Semiahmoo Secondary School; it moved into a new building on the latter's site on 148th Street. The old Semiahmoo building was occupied by White Rock Elementary School. The old building was demolished in 2004; the cupola was saved in 2004 and delivered to Semiahmoo for restoration in 2016.

Academics
Semiahmoo Secondary School has been an International Baccalaureate (IB) World School since June 1980, making it one of the oldest IB programs in British Columbia.
