The basilar plexus (transverse or basilar sinus) consists of several interlacing venous channels between the layers of the dura mater over the basilar part of the occipital bone (the clivus) and serves to connect the two inferior petrosal sinuses.

It communicates with the anterior vertebral venous plexus.

Clinical Significance 

The basilar plexus is not typically a clinically significant structure. However, it can sometimes be involved in certain medical conditions, such as a posterior circulation infarction and a cavernous sinus thrombosis.
