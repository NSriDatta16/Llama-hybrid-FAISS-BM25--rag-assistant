The Geoff Show was a humorous radio program, broadcast on Absolute Radio (formerly Virgin Radio) from 3 January 2006 to 25 September 2008. 

The show ran for three hours, between 10pm and 1am, Monday to Thursday. Presented by Geoff Lloyd, it also featured his 'symposium', comprising himself, Annabel Port and his producer Nelson Kumah. A daily podcast of the previous night's show was also produced.  

During the introductions of each of these podcasts, Geoff read out dedications sent in by listeners.  Those who send letters through the post were rewarded with a Geoff Show badge, which were handmade by Annabel Port (shown at right).

On the podcast of the 11 December 2007 show, it was announced that Tony would be leaving his position as producer to take a promotion elsewhere within Absolute Radio.  His replacement, Nelson Kumah began on 7 January 2008.

As part of the re-brand to Absolute Radio, Geoff moved to Geoff Lloyd's Hometime Show, in the afternoon slot. On 16 September 2008 he announced that the Geoff Show was going to end on Thursday 25 September 2008 .

Features that ran until the final show
Podications: Every Podcast was dedicated to listeners who contacted the show in a 'podication'. This was not broadcast on air, but recorded immediately after the show and appeared at the start of each podcast.
Phone In topics: Topics were suggested by Geoff, Annabel and Nelson, normally illustrated by an example. Listeners contacted the station with their ideas, views and experiences. There was also a standing list of 101 different topics on the website.
Porting Controversy: A humorous, self-opinionated debate against widely held beliefs by Annabel, such as 'The Mona Lisa is a good piece of artwork' and 'Reading is fun'.
Drunk Versus Stoned: A quiz in which someone who had been drinking alcohol competes with another listener who had been smoking cannabis in order to win a prize, not to reward them for their activity, but to give them an alternative. This was to examine the detrimental effects of cannabis and alcohol. In the last Geoff Show on 25 September 2008, the scores of the 'Drunk Versus Stoned' game was Stoned with 1 more win than drunks.
The Big 'I Am...': Listeners had to complete the sentence 'I am...' with whatever they were doing or thinking, and Annabel Port read out the texts every night.
Annabel's Letter: Where Annabel writes an open letter to a famous person and gives them career or relationship advice.
Nelson's Special Offers: The closeout feature of the show where listeners would either text or email in with either a name of a city/town in the British Isles or a type of business (keycutters, Indian restaurant etc.) and Nelson had to procure a discount for Geoff Show listeners at that place in that city/town.

Former features
The Dead of the Night: A competition in which Tony describes a dead person's life and the listeners, along with Geoff and Annabel, guess the way in which he dies. Originally the prize was a CD accompanied with an audio book. Now the prize ranges from sexual toys to CD packs.
The Shitting Forecast: In an attempt to topple the shipping forecast in the late night ratings, listeners called in to tell Geoff what they had to eat that day and Annabel predicted how their bowel movement would be the following morning. This was taken off the air as the quality of the callers had decreased and it did not topple BBC Radio 4. Traditionally, when Geoff asked the caller whether their bowel movements were regular, the caller would reply "I'm as regular as clockwork, Geoff!"
The Dirty Book at Bedtime: An erotic story read by Annabel Port.
What the Hell are we going to do on Monday night's show?: A feature on Thursday nights, where three options were given for a one-off feature for the next Monday. Examples include 'Strong thong', 'hackney cab vs acne lad' and 'mop gear'.
A game with a fellow DJ: Geoff talks to the presenter who succeeds The Geoff Show and plays a game with them. Robin Burke's game is entitled "Rocking Robin" and his theme is the Michael Jackson song of the same name. Geoff asks Robin a question about himself. The twist comes when Robin is not presenting his regular show. In that case, Geoff asks the replacement presenter a question about Robin's personality and they have to estimate the answer from what they know about Robin. When Steve Harris presents the following show, the game is entitled "Call My Band" â€“ Steve reads out three band names, two of which are not real bands. The Symposium have to try to guess which is the real band name. Steve's theme is the theme tune from Call My Bluff. Greg Burns's game is "Chinese Burns", where Geoff explains to the listeners that he suspects China is soon to be the dominant world power. Geoff then asks Greg a question concerning China, 'in an effort to discover more about our Chinese masters'.
Night fever: Tony, the patient, gives the symptoms of a well known illness to the doctors, Annabel and Geoff, who do not know what it is and the listeners call in and diagnose Tony. The prize for a correct diagnosis is the Operation board game and a first aid kit.
You Say It's Your Birthday, It's My Birthday Too, Yeah!: This is a weekly competition that takes place on a Wednesday in which Geoff goes head to head with a caller that "dares to take on the mighty Geoff", usually threatening to "geoffocate" on them. The caller has the choice of what subject both they and Geoff will answer questions on. Geoff goes out of the recording studio room and the caller answers as many questions right as they can. Geoff then takes his turn to answer the same questions. Geoff has to answer more questions correctly than the caller if he is to win the prize. If there is a draw, the caller wins the prize and Geoff feels cheated as he "didn't answer any less amount of questions than the caller-in did". The prize for the winner is an item from the show's sponsor "i want one of those.com".
The Sensual Olympics: For five weeks, every Wednesday, a Sensual Olympics event takes place between Geoff, Annabel, Nelson and a person from the wider symposium. There was one event for each of the five senses. The first event of the sense of smell was on 27 February 2008 where Annabel Port came first, followed by the wider symposium representative Mark Forsythe, Nelson Kumah coming third, and Geoff Lloyd in last place. The second event on 7 March 2008 was based on eyesight. Geoff came last yet again because of his strong prescription glasses, Nelson retaining his third position, Annabel dropping to second, with the representative of the wider symposium for the second event, Garry Potter winning. The hearing test on 13 March 2008 was won by Nelson, followed by Geoff second, Annabel coming third and the representative of the wider symposium, Charlee Brown coming last.
