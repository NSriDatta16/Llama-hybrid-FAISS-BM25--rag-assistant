History 
The picture gallery's collection was started by a bequest of 184 paintings and around 2000 drawings from General John Guise, a former Christ Church undergraduate and British army officer who had fought at the Battle of Oudenarde. His bequest consisted of Italian paintings from the 16th and 17th centuries, with painters such as Tintoretto, Annibale Carracci and Paolo Veronese represented. The 14th and 15th-century paintings were donated by W. T. H. Fox-Strangways and Walter Savage Landor. Both men had lived in Florence in the 1820s and 1830s where they collected art.

Smaller bequests were made by Lord Frederick Campbell, Sir Richard Nosworthy, and others. C. R. Patterson donated his collection of 18th and 19th-century Russian icons.

On 14 March 2020, burglars broke into the gallery by night and stole 3 paintings; Salvator Rosa's A Rocky Coast, with Soldiers Studying a Plan, Anthony van Dyck's A Soldier on Horseback, and Annibale Carracci's A Boy Drinking. The estimated value of the stolen paintings is over £10 million. As of November 2022, the perpetrators have not been caught, and three empty frames hang in the gallery to mark where the stolen paintings were formerly displayed.
