He was named the second star of the game. Mauldin continued to make an impact with the Avalanche from the fourth line, most notably scoring two goals and two assists in a 7-4 victory over the Minnesota Wild on November 28, 2010, to be named first star of the game. Mauldin remained with the Avalanche for a career-high 29 games and 10 points before he was later returned to help Lake Erie to their first post-season berth.

In the 2011–12 season, Mauldin failed to make the Avalanche out of training camp and was reassigned to Lake Erie. After a strong start with the Monsters, Mauldin was limited through injury before finishing with 59 games, to place third in Lake Erie scoring 34 points.
