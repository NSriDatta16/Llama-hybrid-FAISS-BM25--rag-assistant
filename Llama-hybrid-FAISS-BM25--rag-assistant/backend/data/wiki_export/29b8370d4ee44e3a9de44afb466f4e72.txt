History

Formation and early years (1958–1970) 
The club was founded after 10 sports enthusiasts from Ruggell met at the Gasthaus Rössle - a local Inn - at midday of 9 March 1958. The first match played under the name FC Ruggell was in the Liechtenstein Junior Tournament in Triesen, which Ruggell's Youth C-Team took place in, with their first match happening on 7 September 1958. The following year the club competed in a senior league match for the first time, spending the 1959/60 season in the Swiss 4. Liga. In 1963 the club reached the final of the Liechtenstein Cup for the first time, losing 3:1 against FC Schaan. The team won its first honour in 1970, winning the league title in 4. Liga but losing the promotion playoffs to FC Gams.

3. Liga (1970–1983) 
In 1973 Ruggell won their league once again, however this time they won their playoff matches against FC Buchs and FC Untervaz, promoting them to the 3. Liga for the first time in their history. The club remained in the 3. Liga for several years after, never getting into any promotion playoffs, however did have some success in the Swiss Cup (which clubs from Liechtenstein were allowed to participate in at the time. In 1975, they beat the second division teams of Altstätten and Rorschach but were knocked out in the third round by FC Triesen.

Liga table. In 1981 they reached the Liechtenstein Cup Final for the fourth time, after a 5–0 victory over Vaduz in the semi-final, but lost to FC Balzers 3-0 after extra time.

Playoffs and Decline (1983–2000) 
1983 was the 25th anniversary of the founding of FC Ruggell, with several sporting events done in celebration. At the end of the 1984–85 season, the club was joint on points with the league leaders FC Diepoldsau, after winning a crucial final day match against local rivals FC Schann. This meant that a final match between the two teams was scheduled to decide who had won the division, with Ruggell winning the match, giving them their first 3. Liga title and their first time in the playoffs for promotion to the 2. Liga, however they failed to get promoted. In the 1988–89 season, the club had a women's team for the first time.

In the 1994–95 season, the club was relegated back to the 4. Liga, however was promoted back to the 3. Liga the following season. The club was then promoted and relegated between these two divisions until the new millennium.
