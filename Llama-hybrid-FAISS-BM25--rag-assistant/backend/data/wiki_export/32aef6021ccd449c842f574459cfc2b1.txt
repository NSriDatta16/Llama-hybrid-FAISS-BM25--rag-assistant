T. H. Lain was a collective pseudonym used by nine separate authors writing under Wizards of the Coast's Dungeons & Dragons novels imprint.

According to Peter Archer, WotC's Director of Publishing, the decision to credit the Dungeons & Dragons novels to just one author was made to ensure they would be shelved together, as well as to spark a certain measure of curiosity and speculation as to T.H. Lain's identity. However, it was already obvious to many from the stylistic differences between volumes that Lain's output was the work of many authors rather than one. In December 2003, WotC formally announced the nine authors whose work was published under the T.H. Lain name:

 Philip Athans, Managing Editor for Wizards of the Coast Book Publishing and editor of the Forgotten Realms novel line.
 Cory Herndon, a freelance writer and one-time editor of the Star Wars Roleplaying Game.
