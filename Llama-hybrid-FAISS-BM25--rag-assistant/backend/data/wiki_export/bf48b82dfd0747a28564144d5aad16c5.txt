Biography
Vale-Allen (who would never reveal either her birthname or her father's name) was born on January 19, 1941 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and lived in England from 1961 to 1964 where she worked as a television actress and singer. She returned to Toronto briefly, performing as a singer and in cabaret revues until she emigrated to the United States in 1966. She adopted the name "Charlotte Vale" from the Bette Davis character of the film Now, Voyager. 

She married Walter Bateman Allen Jr. in 1970, adopting his surname, portmanteau-style. They made their home in Connecticut and she began to write. Her first book, Daddy's Girl, was written in 1971, detailing the sexual abuse she described at the hands of her father. It was initially rejected by editors who considered the topic of incest too contentious. It was eventually published in 1980.

Charlotte Vale-Allen died a week before her 82nd birthday in Norwalk, Connecticut. She was survived by her daughter and extended family.
