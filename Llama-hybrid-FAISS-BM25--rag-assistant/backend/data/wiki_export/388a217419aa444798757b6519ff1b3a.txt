History
WMDB signed on the air in 1983 under the original owner, Reverend Morgan Babb. It was a black-oriented station with urban gospel in the morning, transitioning to secular rhythm & blues in the afternoon. Morgan Babb came up with the station's popular moniker slogan "The Big Mouth", because of WMDB's large daytime signal. Morgan Babb also claimed his secular R&B format was the "rock lite" format, drawing not just black listeners, but many white listeners as well. By 2000, the music format also included Hip Hop.
In May of 2005, Reverend Morgan Babb sold WMDB to Peter Davison of Davidson Media Group, based out of Charlotte, North Carolina, according to FCC Records. The FCC granted the transfer of WMDB's license July 5th, 2005. During this time period, Davidson Media Group purchased AM 1240, (then WNSG) in the Nashville Market. Davidson Media Changed WNSG's call sign to WNVL on September 21, 2005. Shortly afterwards, Davidson Media Group would eventually flip both WMDB and WNVL to Spanish Language Formats.
