Enrico Ricardo "Ricky" Januarie (born 2 January 1982) is a former South African professional rugby union player. He played for SU Agen Lot-et-Garonne of the Rugby Pro D2 second-level division in France. He has also been a member of the South Africa national rugby union team, having won the 2007 Rugby World Cup.

Career
Januarie was one of the top players of his high school team, Weston High School, in Vredenburg, South Africa. He is known for scoring the match-winning try against New Zealand in a 2008 Tri Nations Series match that the Springboks had won 30â€“28. In November 2009, whilst a member of the South African Western Province rugby team, Januarie joined the Welsh regional team Ospreys on a three-month loan arrangement, with questions of him potentially being an ineligible player due to pre-season obligations with Western Province and the 2010 Currie Cup pre-season matches having been solved. In 2011, he left South Africa and joined Lyon OU in France and spent four years with the team. Januarie then signed on with La Rochelle for two years. In June 2017, he signed with Agen and has been an active player on the team since then.
