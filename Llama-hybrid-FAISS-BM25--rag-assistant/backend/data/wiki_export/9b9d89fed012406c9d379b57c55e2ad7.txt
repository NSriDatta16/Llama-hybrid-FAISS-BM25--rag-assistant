General Sir James Aylmer Lowthorpe Haldane,  (17 November 1862 – 19 April 1950) was a Scottish soldier who rose to high rank in the British Army.

Early life
Born to physician Daniel Rutherford Haldane and his wife Charlotte Elizabeth née Lowthorpe, James Aylmer Lowthorpe Haldane came from a family of distinguished Scottish aristocrats based in Gleneagles. He was cousin to Richard Haldane, 1st Viscount Haldane, Secretary of State for War 1905–1912, instigator of the Haldane Reforms.

Military career
In September 1882, after attending the Edinburgh Academy and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Haldane was commissioned as a British officer of the Gordon Highlanders. On 18 February 1886, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant, and on 8 April 1892 to the rank of captain.

Between 1894 and 1895, Haldane was part of the Waziristan Field Force and participated in the Chitral Expedition. He was dispatched to quell the Afridis rebellion in the Tirah campaign for the next two years (1897–1898), was appointed a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) on 20 May 1898, and became aide-de-camp to General Sir William Lockhart, Commander-in-Chief in India, later the same year.  Haldane fought in the Second Boer War in South Africa, where he was taken a war prisoner. While imprisoned in Pretoria, he planned the escape which made Winston Churchill famous. Haldane failed to escape at the same time and later complained of Churchill's lack of regard for those who should have escaped with him. However, Haldane later managed his own escape.

Haldane was appointed a staff captain in the Intelligence Section at the War Office on 27 June 1901, promoted to major on 23 July 1902, and received the brevet rank of lieutenant colonel on the following day. He was military attaché with the Imperial Japanese Army from July 1904 to September 1905 during the Russo-Japanese War, and accompanied Japanese forces into Manchuria.

Following promotion to brevet colonel, Haldane was appointed Companion of the Bath on 16 March 1906 and granted the rank of colonel on 29 October 1906. From 1906 to 1909, he served as assistant director of military intelligence. On 1 October 1909, Haldane was promoted to temporary brigadier-general and in 1910 become commander of 10th Infantry Brigade.
