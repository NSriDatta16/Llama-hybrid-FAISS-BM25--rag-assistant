History 
Malkangiri or Malikamardhangiri as it was historically known was founded by Simhadri Vivek for his queen (1676-1681 CE), ruler of Nandapur-Jeypore kingdom of Odisha. He was a valorous military genius who defeated the joint forces of the French and the army of Golconda and captured fifteen French canons. He killed the general of the Golconda army called Malik Mohammad and therefore was named 'Malik-mardhan' which means 'destroyer of Malik'. He also constructed a strong fort named Malikamardhangadha and it is surmised that the whole area in which the fort was located came to be known in the course of time as Malikamardhangiri and later the British renamed it as Malkangiri.
