History
There was a village in the place of Tázlár in the age of the Árpád dynasty, not much is know about that settlement though. In the mongol invasion of hungary people of the town fortified a stone church, but they were ultimately slain by the invaders and the village was burnt down. The king later repopulated the area with cumans, the villages current name is from a certificate dating back to 1429, which has cuman origins too.

The medieval village was later destroyed, it was in the hands of various landlords, who spilt their lands up to give to peasants, to work their lands.

In 1872 from the neighouring Kisbócsa, Nagybócsa, Kötöny and Harka formed a new village with the same name of Tázlár. Bócsa in 1906 and Harkakötöny in 1949 split off to be their own settlements.

Tázlár's name was changed to Prónayfalva in 1907, but since 1947 it's called Tázlár again.
The village was studied in the 1970s by anthropologist Chris Hann, resulting in a book "Tázlár: A village in Hungary". He has returned there in 2000s studying the further developments The New Property System in Tázlár
