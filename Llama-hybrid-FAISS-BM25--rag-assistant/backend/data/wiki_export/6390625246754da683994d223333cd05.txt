Political career

Sonompil's political career began when his Parliamentary Member brother Mishigiin Chimedtseren died in a deltaplane accident in 1997. He ran as an MP candidate from the Democratic Union Coalition, to fill in his died brother's position, but he was unsuccessful in both the 1997 and 2000 elections. In 2004, Sonompil ran for the third time for the elections from the Democratic Party, and this time he was elected as a Member of Parliament.

However, in January 2006 he voted with the former communist MPRP members against the coalition government of Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj. He did so in spite of a decision of the Democratic Party's Directing Board. The Party's Main Legal Committee therefore cancelled Sonompil's membership in February 2006. In the new government under Miyeegombyn Enkhbold of MPRP, Mishigiin Sonompil was awarded the role of Minister of Defense.
