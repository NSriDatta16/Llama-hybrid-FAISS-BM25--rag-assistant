Virgin Australia (known as Virgin Blue until early 2011) is an Australian airline, with headquarters in Brisbane, Australia. A number of hubs are located throughout Australia.

Virgin Australia previously suspended flights from 30 March 2020 to all international destinations "in response to expanded government travel restrictions and increased impacts from COVID-19 on travel demand", as well as several destinations in Australia.
