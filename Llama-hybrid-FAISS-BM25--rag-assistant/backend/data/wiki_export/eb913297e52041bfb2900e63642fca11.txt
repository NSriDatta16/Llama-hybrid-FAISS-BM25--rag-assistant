History

Envisioned during the 1950s by Philippine abstract painter Fernando Zóbel de Ayala y Montojo, as a museum of Philippine history and iconography, the Ayala Museum was established in 1967 as a project of the Filipinas Foundation, now known as the Ayala Foundation. The museum was housed at the Insular Life Building and was transferred to the old Makati Stock Exchange Building. The old building was designed by National Artist Leandro Locsin.

Plans to transfer to the Ayala Museum were made as early as 2002. The old building that hosted the old Ayala Museum was demolished which met some criticism from heritage conservationists.

The museum moved to a new six-story building made from granite, steel and glass, which was designed by Leandro V. Locsin Partners, led by Leandro Y. Locsin, Jr., the son of the architect that designed the old Ayala Museum. It was formally dedicated at the 170th anniversary of the Ayala Corporation on September 28, 2004, and stands on the same site of the original Ayala Museum.

The museum temporarily closed on June 1, 2019, for renovations, which were expected to finish by the end of 2020. These renovations were halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but subsequently finished by November 2021. The museum reopened on December 4, 2021.
