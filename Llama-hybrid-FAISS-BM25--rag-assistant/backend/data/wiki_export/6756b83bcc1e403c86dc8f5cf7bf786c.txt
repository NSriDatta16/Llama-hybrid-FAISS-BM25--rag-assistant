Bobby Keith Moreland (born May 2, 1954), nicknamed "Zonk", is a former outfielder, catcher, and infielder in Major League Baseball who played for the Philadelphia Phillies, Chicago Cubs, and San Diego Padres. In 1989, the final year of his career, he played for the Detroit Tigers, then the Baltimore Orioles.  On February 16, 2011, he was named the Cubs' color analyst on WGN-AM and the Cubs Radio Network, replacing Ron Santo. On November 6, 2013, he announced that he was stepping down from his position at WGN Radio to spend more time with his family.

Baseball career 
Moreland graduated from The University of Texas at Austin, and was drafted by the Phillies in the seventh round of the 1975 draft. He started out as a catcher, but the Phillies also played him at third base and first base. He was traded along with Dickie Noles and Dan Larson from the Phillies to the Cubs for Mike Krukow on December 8, 1981. During his time with the Cubs, he was primarily used as a corner outfielder, except in his final year. He was dealt along with Mike Brumley from the Cubs to the Padres for Goose Gossage and Ray Hayward on February 12, 1988. In 1989, playing for American League teams, he also made 80 appearances as a designated hitter.

Moreland was acquired by the Orioles from the Tigers for Brian Dubois on July 28, 1989. The Orioles needed a power hitter for its pennant drive and settled for Moreland after its failed pursuit of Harold Baines. Prior to an 11–1 loss to the Chicago White Sox at Memorial Stadium on September 12, a frustrated Moreland, who at the time was mired in a .212 slump with one home run and 10 RBI in 104 at-bats in 30 games since joining the ball club, complained, "I'm not going to hit anymore. My career is over." Orioles manager Frank Robinson responded, "If he wants to retire, retire now. If he's not going to retire, he should be here keeping himself ready to go out and do whatever I ask." The misunderstanding was resolved by the team before it became a bigger distraction. Moreland eventually retired as an active player after the conclusion of the season.

Moreland played twelve seasons in Major League Baseball. He helped the Cubs win the 1984 National League Eastern Division championship. His best year was in 1985 with the Cubs, when he batted .307 (14 HR, 106 RBI, 12 SB). He also had a good year in 1987, with 27 HR and 88 RBI. In 1988 as a member of the San Diego Padres, he was the last player to wear #6 before it was retired in honor of Steve Garvey. He is inducted in Texas Longhorn Hall of Honor.
