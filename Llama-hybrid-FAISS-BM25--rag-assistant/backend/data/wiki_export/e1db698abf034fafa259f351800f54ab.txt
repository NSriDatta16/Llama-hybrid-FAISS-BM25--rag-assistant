Al Gharrafa () is a district of Al Rayyan City in Qatar, located in the municipality of Al Rayyan. In close proximity to metropolitan Doha and Education City, the Doha Expressway and Al Shamal Highway run along the district. Many malls operate out of the area, most notably Landmark Mall. To the east it neighbors the largely residential areas of Duhail and Madinat Khalifa North, therefore Al Gharrafa is largely a retail hub for nearby residential areas. Doha's downtown is about  to the southeast.

Etymology
In Arabic, "gharafa" translates as "to scoop up". It was so named because it is a low-lying floodplain from whence locals would scoop up water from in the past.
