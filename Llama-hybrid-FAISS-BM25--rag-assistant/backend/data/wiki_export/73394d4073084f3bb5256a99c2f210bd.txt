Career outside writing
Over his lifetime, Stevens had many jobs:  as a farmer, deliveryman, selectman, and assistant manager at Carvel Hall, an Annapolis landmark.  Stevens lived overseas for five years, two of those in the Netherlands, moving approximately every six months to countries including Ireland, England, Portugal, and Malta.

His interest in images led him to become a poet and a writer.  It also led to a second career in painting, and along with his writing, he compiles a photographer's portfolio. Photographs of his paintings may be seen at this photography site. His biographies and other non-fiction are unusual, in that in all cases he had access to either the subject or to someone intimate with the subject–a wife, friend, lover, or mother.

Stevens also lectured and traveled extensively, living in Phillips, Maine, in Weld, Maine, in Temple, Maine,  and in South Carolina with his Dutch wife Stella Rachel (née Taschlicky) Stevens, whom he married on June 13, 1954.
