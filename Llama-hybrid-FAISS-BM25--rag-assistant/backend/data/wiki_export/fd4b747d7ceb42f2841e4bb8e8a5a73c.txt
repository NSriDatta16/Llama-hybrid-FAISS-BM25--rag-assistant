11/6/00 – Seattle, Washington is a three-disc live album and the seventy-second and final in a long series of live bootlegs that the American alternative rock band Pearl Jam released from the band's 2000 Binaural Tour. It was released along with the other official bootlegs from the second North American leg of the tour on March 27, 2001.

Overview
The album was recorded on November 6, 2000, in Seattle, Washington at KeyArena. This was the band's last show of its three-leg 2000 tour. The band performed at this show for over three hours, playing most of its hits along with selected cover songs such as "The Kids Are Alright" and "Baba O'Riley" by The Who, one of Pearl Jam's biggest musical influences. This show also featured the North American tour's first performance of "Alive", which had been purposely omitted from all shows on the tour.

This show was selected by the band as one of 18 "Ape/Man" shows from the tour, which, according to bassist Jeff Ament, were shows the band found "really exciting." Allmusic called the show an "essential live document," and gave it four and a half out of a possible five stars. Allmusic staff writer Douglas Siwek said that "by the time they hit their hometown of Seattle in November 2000, it was obvious that the band was truly in sync musically." It debuted at number 98 on the Billboard 200 album chart and was the highest charting official bootleg out of the entire series. "Leatherman", "Better Man", "Nothingman", "Nothing as It Seems", and "Rearviewmirror" from this show appear on the Touring Band 2000 DVD.
