Changlun also known as Changlon (; ) is a small town in Kubang Pasu District, Kedah, Malaysia. The word changlun originates from Thai, chang lon (), which means "fallen elephant".

Located less than 10 km south of the Thai border, Changlun is home to Universiti Utara Malaysia, located in the Sintok suburb in the eastern part of the town. The PLUS Expressway passes through Changlun town, interchanging with the Changlun-Kuala Perlis Highway (national highway 194), an alternative route to the state of Perlis.

History

Sultanate of Kedah

Kedah is one of the oldest surviving sultanates in the world founded in 1136.
Prior to becoming part of Malaysia, it had a well-defined territory and population supported by a working government and had previously entered into various legal relations with other nations like Siam and the British.
Siam has been claiming that Kedah was part of their kingdom.

Anglo–Siamese Treaty of 1909

When the British and Siam signed the Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909 without taking into consideration the interests of the Kedah Sultanate, deciding what belonged to whom, Changlun was divided into two parts. The main border town of Changlun became the district of Kubang Pasu, now in Kedah of Malaysia. The rest remained as Thailand. Tambon Sadao, together with the former minor district (King Amphoe) Prik, forms modern Sadao. This resulting in adverse socio-demographic impacts that affected majority Malay population particularly in the Thai provinces of Pattani, Yala and Narathiwat.

'''Second World War

The Battle of Jitra was fought between the invading Japanese and Allied forces during the Malayan Campaign of the Second World War, from 11–13 December 1941 including in Changlun.
