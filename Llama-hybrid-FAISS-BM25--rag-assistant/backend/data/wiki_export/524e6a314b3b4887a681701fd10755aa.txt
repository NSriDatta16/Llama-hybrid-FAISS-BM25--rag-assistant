Coat of arms

The coat of arms of Heinrich Mussinghoff is based on the coat of arms of the diocese of Aachen, a black cross on a golden shield. The inner shield is based on the coat of arms of the diocese of Münster, a red bar on golden ground. In the upper left corner of the inner shield is an eight-cornered star, resembling the Octagon of the Aachen Cathedral as well as the eight regions of the diocese. The star symbolizes the morning star, which never sets beneath the horizon as a symbol for Jesus Christ. On the red bar are the silver Greek letters Chi and Rho as another symbol for Christ. The red rose in bottom both symbolizes the hometown Rosendahl of the bishop, but also Mary, patron saint of the cathedral, town and diocese of Aachen.

The slogan of Bishop Mussinghoff is Parate viam domini (prepare the way of the lord), taken from Isaiah (40:3).

The coat of arms was designed by Ludwig Schaffrath.
