Goulburn Airport  is a general aviation airport located  south of Goulburn, New South Wales. Throughout the 1990s, suggestions were put forward to have Goulburn airport as a secondary international airport to service Sydney.

The Windellama Rd facility was advertised for sale in the United States, Asia Pacific as well as within Australia, it was determined in February 2011 that Goulburn Mulwaree Council sell the Airport to John Ferrara. Initially the Airport is to be leased and operated by Ferrara for up to two years. Goulburn Airport has been under consideration as a freight hub for Canberra, as the city's international airport expands. In what is believed to be a first for an Australian airport, Goulburn airport has installed a series of hybrid wind and solar powered street light systems.

Airport Facilities
The primary runway is 04/22, with a paved surface measuring 1,283 m × 30 m (4,209 ft × 98 ft). 04/22 is equipped with pilot activated low intensity runway lighting. The secondary runway 08/26 measuring 676 m × 30 m (2,218 ft × 98 ft) is suitable for day operations only as it is not equipped with runway lighting and is unsealed.

There is no control tower located at the airport and pilots must co-ordinate arrivals and departures using a Common Traffic Advisory Frequency (127.15), aided by an Aerodrome Frequency Response Unit (AFRU), which notifies pilots that their transmissions have been received on the frequency and activates lighting systems as appropriate. The nearest radio navigation aid for pilots is the Goulburn Non-Directional Beacon installation located within the airport boundary. Fuel is available for piston, turbine and jet powered aircraft and an automated weather service (AWIS – 136.30) also operates at the airport.
