6mm XC (also known as 6XC) is a rifle cartridge, similar to the 6x47mm Swiss Match.

History
The 6mm XC was initially developed as a Wildcat cartridge specifically for  NRA High Power match shooting by 11-time US National Champion David Tubb. The round originated from chambering a barrel using a .243 Winchester reamer held short, with the case reformed from .22-250. The round is optimised for bullets heavier than 100 grains to improve performance at long ranges - .243Win typically uses bullets lighter than 100 grains. It is touted as being one of the most accurate long-range 6 mm rounds in the world that is designed for repeating rifles.

The 6XC is now a CIP standardized case. The origin is listed as Sweden since Norma standardised the case. Factory brass is available from Norma and Peterson.

Performance

The 6XC is a 1000-yard cartridge, comparable to benchrest calibers such as 6x47mm Swiss Match, 6.5×47mm Lapua and 6 mm/22-250; it fits into cartridge class that exceeds the velocities of benchrest calibers such as 6mm BR Remington, 6mm BRX and 6mm Dasher.  David Tubb has claimed several wins with the 6XC in NRA High Power National Championships and a number of NRA Long Range championship events (1000 yard events).
