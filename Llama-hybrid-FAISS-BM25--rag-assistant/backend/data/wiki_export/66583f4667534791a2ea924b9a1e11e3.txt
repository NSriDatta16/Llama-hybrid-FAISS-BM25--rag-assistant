Name
Nallıhan is named after a caravanserai on the ancient Silk Road to the Orient next to the river Nallı. There has been a settlement here for thousands of years.

Today
Today the town is known for its needlework and local cuisine including stuffed vine-leaves, pilav, pumpkin dessert, gozleme (flat bread with cheese and potatoes filling), and many other types of more fine pastries such as baklava with locally grown walnut. The countryside is used for growing rice, wheat, barley, grapes, apples, tomatoes, and lavender. 
Almost everything grows in the fertile soils of Nalliah such as figs, olives, mulberry, pears, apple, persimmons, quince, hazelnut, pecans, squashes, beans, and melons. 

Visitors can walk through the idyllic Ottoman villages (e.g. Akdere) and have local cuisine in the Ottoman era Caravan Palace.
