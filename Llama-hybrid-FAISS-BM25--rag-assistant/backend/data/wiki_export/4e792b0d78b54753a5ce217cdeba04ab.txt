Eriswil is a municipality in the Emmental administrative district in the Swiss canton of Bern.

History
Eriswil is first mentioned in 1256 as Erolzwile.

Very little is known about the early history of the village.  By the High Middle Ages a local noble family, the von Eriswil family, were a Ministerialis (unfree knights in the service of a feudal overlord) family in service to the Counts of Kyburg.  However, the family died out in the 14th century.  In the last quarter of the 14th century the region was acquired by St. Gallen and incorporated into the Rohrbach district.  Over the following century, Bernese expansion brought Rohrbach under Bern's control.  In 1504 it bought the entire region and added Eriswil to the Trachselwald bailiwick in the Oberaargau District.

The village church was originally under the authority of the Abbey of Saint Gall.  It appears that the oldest part of the church is the bell tower which dates from around the 14th century.  The current choir was built in the 16th century, while the nave was built in 1905.  In 1528 Bern adopted the new faith of the Protestant Reformation and Eriswil converted at that time, severing most ties with the Abbey.  Until 1966 the local parish also included the nearby village of Wyssachen.

Traditionally the village economy relied on agriculture.  By the 17th century village society had stratified into two major classes, well-off citizen farmers and a large number of poor Tauner who had limited rights and worked as sharecroppers.  In 1622 the village closed itself to further Tauner immigration and prevented them from building houses on any of the common land.  In the following century many of the local Tauner began producing canvas in small home factories.  By 1750 there was a thriving canvas cottage industry in the village.  Around 1860, the small scale weaving was replaced with large weaving factories.  Despite economic depressions and wars, four of the local factories remained in operation until the 1970s to 1990s.
