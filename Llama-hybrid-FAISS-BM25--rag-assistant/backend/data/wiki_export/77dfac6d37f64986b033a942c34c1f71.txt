One Man Army and the Undead Quartet was a Swedish band, that played a fusion of melodic death metal and thrash metal. The band was formed by vocalist Johan Lindstrand after the breakup of The Crown. After two albums on Nuclear Blast Records, they moved to Massacre Records. Their third album, Grim Tales, received lukewarm reviews.

The band officially split-up in 2012.
