Mohyal Brahmins are an Indian sub-caste of Saraswat Brahmins from the Punjab region.

Prior to the Partition of India, Mohyal Brahmins lived primarily in the Potohar and Hazara regions of Northern Punjab and North-West Frontier Province (Rawalpindi, Chakwal, Jhelum, Sargodha, Campbellpur, Haripur, Abbottabad and Murree) and in the Pahari regions of Jammu and Kashmir (Pulandari, Mirpur, Kotli, Alibeg, Bhimber, Poonch, Rawlakote, Jammu, Bagh and Rajouri). Frequent migrations of these Brahmins had happened from these regions to hilly areas of Kangra and Chamba from 1200 CE. After the partition, most migrated to, and settled in the neighbouring Indian states of Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Delhi.

Mohyal Brahmins were not priests in the traditional sense as they abandoned their priestly duties. They were warriors, spiritual healers and preachers of different sects of Hinduism.

Mohyal Brahmins are a caste and a sub-group of the Punjabi Hindu community. The members of this sub-caste originate from the broader Saraswat Brahmin group and comprise seven clans named Bali, Bhimwal, Chhibber, Datt, Lau, Mohan and Vaid. These each claim their lineage from one of seven different Brahmin rishis.

Some Mohyal Brahmins also have an association with Shia Muslims because they claim to have helped Imam Hussain in the Battle of Karbala, these Mohyal Brahmnins are called Hussaini Brahmins.

Dhanvantari gotra is found as the original gotra among the Bengali Baidyas.

The Mohyal Brahmins stopped practising priestly duties. The same tradition is seen amongst the Bhumihar Brahmins and the Bengali Baidya clan, who despite following Brahmin varna-rituals, are often considered as Semi-Brahmins for not performing priestly duties.

Mohyal Brahmins of Punjab are among the Brahmarshi community of Brahmins in India.

Contributions to Sikhism

Spirituality and identity 

The majority of Mohyal Brahmins identify as Hindu, with some also identifying as Sikh. Guru Nanak revitalised faith in order to make it accessible for the common people of late Medieval India. As a part of this transformation, many Punjabi Hindus, including the Mohyals, revered and followed Guru Nanak. This devotion towards Nanak's mat (teachings/wisdom) led them to follow Nanak's successors and then assist in the creation of the Sikh ethos. Moreover, as the latter Gurus became martial, this community was a natural home for the warrior-class of Punjabi Hindus.

Guru Nanak, continuing in the tradition of Bhakti Saints, revitalised Sanatan ('Hindu') wisdom in order to make to accessible for the common people of late Medieval India. As a part of this transformation, many Punjabi Hindus, including the Mohyals, revered and followed Guru Nanak. Its worth mentioning that a distinct Sikh religious identity was not created until the 19th century, thus, referring to the period of the Gurus as 'Sikhism' is not problematic.

Guru period

Other notable Mohyals include the brothers Bhai Mati Das and Bhai Sati Das, who both died alongside the ninth Guru, Guru Tegh Bahadur, for protecting Hindu Religion from Islamic Jihad. As the family of the latter Gurus and this Chhibber family were close, Bhai Chaupa Singh Chhibber became a care-taker of Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth guru.
