Biography
Ciccone was born very prematurely, with doctors giving him just 5% of survival, as he recounts in his autobiography, Cuore. Born to parents from Abruzzo, in southern Italy, he lived in the Mile-Ex part of Montreal, which was a very poor area of Montreal's Little Italy area. When he was very young, his father died. Nicola was a victim of bullying at school.

Nicola studied child psychology at Montreal's McGill University. in 1998, he won "Ma Première" held annually for upcoming Canadian artists at Montreal's Place des Arts and soon signed a record.contract He released his debut album, L'Opéra du Mendiant in 1998, which got gold. He then released a number of albums and had chart success with a number of singles.

In 2017, he became a spokesman for Quebec Autism Federation. He also became one of the spokesmen for fondation Charles Bruneau in 2019 and the spokesman for Trouble craniocérébral TCC in 2020.

In September 2021 Ciccone released his 13th album, the musical project "Gratitude." Its release was followed by an important tour. The 12-song record was written during the lockdown, which makes it both touching and universal.
