The Mitsubishi 4M4 engine is a range of four-cylinder diesel piston engines from Mitsubishi Motors, first introduced in the second generation of their Montero/Pajero/Shogun SUVs. They superseded the previous 4D5 engine family, main differences are enlarged displacements and the utilization of one or two over-head camshafts. Originally available only as a 2835 cc intercooled turbo, detail improvements in 1996 and a larger 3.2 litre option in 1999 served to improve power, torque, fuel economy and emissions. The final version has 3.0 litres swept volume and Common rail direct injection.
