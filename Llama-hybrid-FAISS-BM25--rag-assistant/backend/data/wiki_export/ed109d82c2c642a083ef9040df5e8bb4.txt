Career
Serra's journalistic career started at the BBC as a researcher. She spent three years working as a producer/presenter for BBC London News and produced on Radio 4's Today programme. She regularly presented EuroNews on BBC Radio Five Live. Her most challenging on-air moment was having to improvise a 5 minute radio bulletin without any scripts due to a technical mishap.

In 2003, she joined Sky News as a reporter, working on both domestic and international assignments. Serra covered a wide range of stories, from the death of Pope John Paul II in Rome, to the Michael Jackson trial in California.

Serra became part of the Five News team in 2005, following a deal between Sky News and Five to deliver Five's news programming. She became the first news presenter in the United Kingdom to present a prime time news programme in her second language on terrestrial television, with her first language as Italian.

In 2006, a newly formed news network was launched which was part of the Al Jazeera network. Serra subsequently joined Al Jazeera English in April 2006 as part of its launch-team. The role and many of the other news correspondents for the network were based in London.

As part of the Al Jazeera English team, she was a correspondent in a number of European countries and also the West Bank and Gaza between 2006 and 2009. Since September 2007, she has co-presented a weekly programme called TV Talk, broadcast on Italian state TV RAI from the Al Jazeera studios in London. The TV programme broadcasts on RAI 3, with Serra regularly speaking out about the lack of female representation on Italian television.

Her work with Al Jazeera English included the breaking news report that Palestinian farmers were being attacked by Israelis in the West Bank in 2009. Also in 2009, she shadowed Pope Benedict XVI on his trip around the Middle East. This included meeting the Pope during his controversial trip to the Holy Land. Her reports were logged on the Al Jazeera website, covering each day of the Pope's trip.

In 2013, Serra interviewed Anders Fogh Rasmussen where he discussed NATO's involvement in Afghanistan and also the success of its operations in the region.

Serra presented a TEDx talk in the city of Matera, Italy in 2014. The talk discussed the understanding of meritocracy within Italy, when compared to other aspects such as competition and ambition.

Having started as a London-based European reporter, she now works primarily as a London anchor on the flagship programme Newshour for Al Jazeera. Serra reports and anchors on location for big stories for the news and was live on air in 2013 as the conclave in Rome elected Pope Francis. She is also a stand-in presenter for The Listening Post. She has presented several programmes and documentaries, including People & Power and Streetfood Palermo on the same network. She also still works as a regular commentator for RAI.

In March 2017 she presented the prestigious Royal Television Society Journalism awards, which took place in Mayfair, London.

In 2020, Al Jazeera aired Serra's documentary, Fascism in the Family. In the documentary, Serra looks at the story of her grandfather who was mayor of Carbonia, a city built by the Benito Mussolini regime to service the local coal mines, to see what link there is between Italy's fascist past and its present. The documentary also looks at the  rhetoric of Matteo Salvini and has a testimony from Holocaust survivor Senator Liliana Segre.
