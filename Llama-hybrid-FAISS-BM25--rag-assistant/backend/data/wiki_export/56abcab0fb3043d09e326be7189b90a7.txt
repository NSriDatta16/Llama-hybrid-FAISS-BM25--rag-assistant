History
Campos Belos began around the small chapel dedicated to Our Lady of the Conception in 1881.  Lands were donated by local cattle ranchers for the foundation of the new town.  In 1889 the settlement was elevated to district, belonging to Arraias, which is now part of the state of Tocantins.  In 1953 Campos Belos became a city.

Development took off with the construction of Brasília in the 1950s and its inauguration in 1960.  By the end of the 1970s the city had its first banking agencies and in the 1980s it was integrated into the national telephone system.

A major change occurred in 1988 when the state of Goiás was divided.  Campos Belos became an inter-state municipality.  Growth was substantial in the decade of the 1990s since the city began to supply the population of the new state of Tocantins, which did not have an adequate commercial infrastructure.  With the construction of Palmas, the city acquired an alternative route of access to the north of the country.
