It was issued to radio January 2, 1995, in the US, as the first single released from her second studio album The Woman in Me (1995). The song was the first single that Twain co-wrote with her then-husband Robert John "Mutt" Lange. The song became Twain's first hit on country radio, peaking at number 11. Radio stations began putting the song into high rotation after they noticed high amounts of the album selling.

In August 1995, the single was certified Gold for 500,000 sales, making it Twain's first Gold single. The song won the SOCAN Song of the Year award at the Canadian Country Music Awards in 1995.
