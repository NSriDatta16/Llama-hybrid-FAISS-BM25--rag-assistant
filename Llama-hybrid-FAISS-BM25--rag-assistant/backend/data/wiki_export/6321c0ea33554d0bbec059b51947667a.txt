The Max M. Fisher College of Business is the business college of The Ohio State University, a public research university located in Columbus, Ohio. Fisher's campus is located on the northern part of the university within a partially enclosed business campus adjacent to St. John Arena.

The college is home to five academic departments: Accounting and Management Information Systems, Finance, Management and Human Resources, Marketing and Logistics, and Operations and Business Analytics.

The Journal of Business Logistics was created at Fisher (then the College of Business) in 1978. The Leader Behavior Description Questionnaire, a tool still used today to measure and describe the behavior of leaders, was created at the college in 1962.

The American Accounting Association's Hall of Fame was established at Fisher in 1950 to honor those who in some way distinguished themselves in the field. An international board of accountants nominate and select new members annually to add to the 78 inducted members. Current Ohio State University faculty are prohibited from nomination.

Faculty thought leadership from Fisher is available and accessible to the practitioner community via Forefront, the college’s research newsroom. Forefront houses translations of the latest and most impactful research, as well as media coverage of Fisher’s faculty, expertise and insights.

Max Fisher

Born in Salem, Ohio, Max M. Fisher enrolled at Ohio State in 1926 and graduated four years later with a bachelor’s degree in business. After graduation, Max moved to Detroit, Michigan, to join his family, where he worked for his father’s oil reclamation business. He eventually helped grow the business — Aurora Gasoline — into one of the largest gas station chains in the Midwest. The business was later bought out by Marathon Petroleum.

Max once described Ohio State as a place that provided him with opportunities to take risks, shape his own future and develop a base to make lasting and meaningful impacts on the world. In 1993, a $20 million gift from Max spearheaded the transformation of Ohio State’s business college into a highly competitive, top-ranked business school. In recognition of his generous commitment, the college was named The Ohio State University Max M. Fisher College of Business.

Together with Marjorie, his wife of 52 years, and his family, Max cultivated a lifetime legacy of philanthropy that impacted countless causes and organizations, including Fisher College of Business, through the Max M. & Marjorie S. Fisher Family Foundation.

Campus plan and architecture

The six-building campus is oriented around its largest building, the signature Fisher Hall, which is the same height as the main university library and on axis with it. This visually links the college to the larger Ohio State campus. The organization of undergraduate buildings, graduate study, and administration cluster around the Alutto Quad, a traditional campus green. The brick architecture reinterprets the Neo-Classical tradition found throughout Ohio State’s campus.

In 2022, construction on the newest addition to Fisher’s campus began. The Daley Family Pavilion and Daley Family Terrace will offer 13,000 square feet of permanent entertaining space adjacent to The Blackwell Inn, the Pfahl Conference Center and Fisher Hall. The structures are named to recognize the family of Clayton Daley, Jr. (MBA ’74), a business leader at The Procter & Gamble Company, member of the college’s Dean’s Advisory Council and a proud alumnus, as well as two other generations of Daleys to graduate from Fisher.
