As Minister in the French cabinet, he is known for the "Dutreil Acts", which have modernized the French tax system, the distribution system, the professional education system and encouraged a pro-entrepreneurial culture and environment in France

2003
A strong advocate of national artisanal and Luxury traditions, Dutreil co-authored among other books Le Geste et La Parole des Métiers d'Art, an important reference work on the subject. In 2003, he created a Government sponsored label, "Entreprise du Patrimoine vivant" (Living Heritage Companies) which has been granted to more than 600 French companies selected for their exceptional know how and heritage.

2005
Dutreil argued strongly for 'fonctions régaliennes' in the French administration (army, police, justice and heritage) to be reserved for French citizens (i.e. not open to other European citizens) (speech at the Ecole Normale Supérieure, 2005).

2008-2009
He is member of the Advisory Board of L Capital, a Private Equity fund part of LVMH.

he has developed a highly appreciated expertise in Brand development and management and initiated, during the crisis in 2008 and 2009, a strategic focus of the brands on the values of Artisanship, heritage and narrative communication, exclusive store experience and controlled distribution, which are now the core of the Luxury marketing and distribution strategies.  He has also developed a strong network in Asia (China and India) and Brazil. As a "multi cultural" leader, familiar with distribution and marketing in the emerging markets as well as in Europe and the US, Dutreil believes growth in consumer goods will more and more come from the "globalization of exception", implying a double focus on brand identity as well as global distribution, executed by multinational management teams.
