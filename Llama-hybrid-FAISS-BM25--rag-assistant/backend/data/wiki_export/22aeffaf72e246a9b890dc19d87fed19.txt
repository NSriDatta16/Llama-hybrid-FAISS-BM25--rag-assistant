Lester B. Pearson Collegiate Institute, also known as Lester B. Pearson CI, LBPCI,  or simply Pearson, is a public high school in the Malvern neighbourhood of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

The school operates grades 9 through 12 under the sanction of the Toronto District School Board. Opened in 1978, it formerly was part of the Scarborough Board of Education.

Overview
Pearson CI is located at 150 Tapscott Road. It is located across from Malvern Town Centre and can be easily accessed by various TTC bus routes. LBP is a school with a multicultural group of students coming from 56 different countries, speaking 42 languages, and practicing 17 different religions. 

The school is named after Canadian Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson, who was Canada's only winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. The school's motto is "Peace through Understanding," which is from Pearson's 1957 Nobel speech, and attempts to inspire appreciation of diversity. This motto is featured on the school's logo in which stylized human figures in the outside circle have outstretched arms, symbolizing understanding among the nations of the world. The circular shape represents the world, and contains the dove of peace and Canada's maple leaf.

Design 
Lester B. Pearson Collegiate Institute was designed by Raymond Moriyama, a renowned Toronto architect, whose many notable projects include the Ontario Science Centre and Toronto Reference Library.

Key features of the original design have become an important part of the school culture including "The Ramp," the wide main entrance ramp that leads into "Main Street," a lane that leads to the learning areas, a student gathering place called "The Caf or Cafetorium," and ends at a senior public school (Dr. Marion Hilliard Senior Public School).

History 
The school opened its doors to students in October 1978. For the first several weeks of that school year, Pearson CI students were bussed to nearby Albert Campbell CI at McCowan and Finch because of construction delays due to a province-wide strike of carpenters. The previous year, Pearson's first cohort of students, including students who would be attending the adjoining Hilliard Senior Public School, was bussed to West Hill Collegiate Institute for classes.

In 1978, the junior boys' basketball team, which included Farley Flex and Darryl Sampson, won the Scarborough Championship, the first time in 46 years that a brand-new school won the championship. They won three consecutive basketball championships.
