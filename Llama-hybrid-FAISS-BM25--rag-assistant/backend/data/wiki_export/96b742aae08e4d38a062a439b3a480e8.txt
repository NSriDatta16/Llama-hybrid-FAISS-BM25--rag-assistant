Nikos Alefantos (, 3 January 1939 – 23 June 2020) was a Greek professional footballer and football coach. He is regarded as one of the most innovative managers of the 20th century, known in Greece for his phlegmatic personality, short temper, famous quips, various moments and experiences from his days in the football pitches and is regarded as the greatest Greek manager never to have won one of the two major titles (Alpha Ethniki/Greek Superleague and Greek Football Cup) in his home country. In his 35-year managerial career he managed 28 different teams, most notably his three spells at Olympiacos (1983–84, 1993–94, 2003–04) and at Iraklis, where he led a team with 1 point in 6 matches to a 4th place in 1985–86, after what was dubbed the "Play-off of Shame" in Greece.

Career
After playing football in the streets in the years of WWII and the Greek Civil War, his talent was spotted by Asteras Exarchion, the club from which he would later start his long and memorable managerial career. At 13 he would sign for P.A.O. Rouf at age 13 and embarked on a 16–year footballing career which included being one of roughly 30 players who have appeared for both eternal enemies, Panathinaikos and Olympiacos. At the latter, the club he supported for all his life, he played a vital role in the club's Double in the 1958–59 season. After noteworthy spells at other clubs, he retired in 1969 aged 30 and immediately embarked on a lengthy career in managemenent.

Alefantos managed several clubs in the Greek Super League, including Olympiacos during 2004. He also had brief spells leading AEL in 1975 and 1990.

Alefantos gained notoriety for his unusually short tenure as the manager of Fostiras in 2002. He was appointed manager of the club, replacing Vlachos in September 2002. One of Fostira's players, Dimitrios Moutas, immediately refused to train with Alefantos, and then Alefantos resigned later that day after failed contract negotiations. Eventually Alefantos appeared in ART channel of Greece, participating in a sport TV program called "Dokari Kai mesa" presented by Giannis Karatzaferis.

He died from a heart attack on 23 June 2020, aged 81.
