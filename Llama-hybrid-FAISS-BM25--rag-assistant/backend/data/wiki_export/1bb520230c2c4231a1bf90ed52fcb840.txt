Professional career

San Diego Padres
Davis was a first-round pick, second overall, in the 1995 Major League Baseball draft, by the San Diego Padres, out of Malvern Preparatory School. USA Today called him the best high school catcher since Dale Murphy, in . Davis was named to the Pioneer League All-Star team, in his first professional season, with the Advanced-Rookie Idaho Falls Braves, in .

In , Davis was limited to designated hitter duties, for the first month of the season, with the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes, due to a sore right elbow. He threw out 25 of 98 attempted base-stealers. Davis also spent the  season at Rancho Cucamonga, throwing out 59 of 159 attempted base-stealers.

The Padres purchased Davis' contract from the Double-A Mobile BayBears on September 19, 1998. He made his Major League debut, as a defensive replacement, on September 25, against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Davis reached on an error, in his first and only at-bat of the season. He was named to the Southern League All-Star team, that season, his first with Mobile. Davis threw out 47 of 83 attempted base-stealers.

Davis spent the majority of the  season with the Padres. He started 71 of 93 games for San Diego, after being recalled, on June 23. Davis collected his first major league hit, on June 26, against the Colorado Rockies, a single off Mark Brownson. He posted his first career four-hit game, on September 15, against the Atlanta Braves, including a solo home run off John Smoltz.

Davis split the  season between the Triple-A Las Vegas 51s and San Diego. He began the season with the Padres, appearing in seven games, before being optioned to Las Vegas, on April 20. Davis was recalled, on July 8. He was placed on the disabled list, in August, with a strained left oblique muscle.

Davis was the subject of controversy in a game against the Arizona Diamondbacks on May 26, 2001, as a member of the San Diego Padres. Starting pitcher Curt Schilling took a perfect game into the eighth inning, when, with one out, Davis laid down a successful drag bunt single, to second baseman Jay Bell.

After Davis reached base, many of the Diamondbacks' players shouted obscenities at him for supposedly breaking baseball's unwritten rules. After the game, Diamondbacks manager Bob Brenly called Davis's play "chickenshit".

Many analysts still debate Davis's decision to bunt for a base hit, as the Diamondbacks were only leading by a score of 2–0, which brought the tying run to the plate for the Padres. Eventually, San Diego's Alex Arias led off the ninth inning with a clean double. Schilling completed the three-hitter, sealing the Diamondbacks' 3–1 win. This game started a fierce rivalry between the two teams, which included several bench-clearing brawls, that lasted for several years, which has since dissipated.

Seattle Mariners
In December , Davis was traded, along with Wascar Serrano and Alex Arias, to the Seattle Mariners, in exchange for Brett Tomko, Tom Lampkin, and Ramón Vázquez. This trade, in large, disappointed the Padres organization and fanbase, because of their continuing failures to produce "home-grown" talent. Davis was a highly regarded top prospect.

Davis had a .998 fielding percentage, in 77 games behind the plate, and threw out 44 percent of would be base-stealers, in . He batted .300 with runners in scoring position, and was 6-for-11, with two home runs, with the bases loaded. Davis also hit .294, with six home runs, on the road, as opposed to .216, with one home run, at home. He batted .294, in the second half of the season, raising his average from .216, at the break, to .259, at the end of the season. All seven of Davis' home runs came from the left side of the plate. He hit his first American League (AL) home run, and first homer of the season, May 4, against the New York Yankees, at Yankee Stadium. Davis had a nine-game hitting streak, from May 17 to June 6, going 13-for-29, during that span. He hit his first triple of season, on August 4, against the Cleveland Indians.

Davis spent his second season with the Mariners in a platoon with fellow backstop Dan Wilson, in . Davis appeared in 80 games, hitting .236, with six home runs, and 42 RBIs. He hit a go-ahead home run off Ricardo Rincón, to lead off the 11th inning, April 3, against the Oakland Athletics.

He hit .331, with six doubles, three triples, three home runs, and 19 RBIs, in 36 games with Camden and played in 36 games with Las Vegas, batting .218, with four doubles, a home run, and 11 RBIs.

Baltimore Orioles
