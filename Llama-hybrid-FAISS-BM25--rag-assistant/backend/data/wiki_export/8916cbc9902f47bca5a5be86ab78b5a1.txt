Coaching career

University of Wisconsin–Madison 
Tucker was first invited by UW—Madison to join as Director of Student-Athlete Engagement in February 2017, a position in which he oversaw health and safety policies for athletes and staff. After two years in this role, on July 31, 2019, he was announced as interim assistant coach on for the Badgers for the 2019–20 season.

He was hired by head coach Greg Gard to fill the role of Howard Moore, who left his position as assistant coach after being involved in a car accident that left him with serious injuries. Tucker was known for his ability to develop close relationships with the players, which led him to remain as interim assistant coach throughout the 2020–21 season, enjoying popularity among players and fans alike.

Following the conclusion of the 2020–21 season, Tucker applied to become a full-time assistant coach, but Wisconsin officials decided to part ways with him. Allegations surfaced in local media surrounding Tucker's desire to take over the head coaching job, but he later dismissed these as rumors and denied any accusations of wrongdoing.

He finished his 2-year stint with a Big Ten Conference Championship for the 2019 regular season and a 39–23 record.

Personal life 
During his stint at Hapoel Tel Aviv, Tucker partnered with an Israeli “Hoops for Kids International” non-for-profit organization for speaking engagements, basketball clinics, and mentorship to impoverished children throughout the Middle East. He remains passionate about philanthropy and giving back to the community.

He currently resides with his wife, Krystal, and their three sons in Chicago, where he is a member of the board of directors for the Special Olympics' local committee.
