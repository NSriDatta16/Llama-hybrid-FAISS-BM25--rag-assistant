Debut of national teams

The 2015 tournament was the first edition with no country making its debut. It simply featured the return of Uruguay after not qualifying for the 2007 and 2011 editions. The 2019 was the same, with Romania disqualified and replaced by Russia.

The worst result by a country who hosted the final is held by England, being eliminated in the group stage in 2015.

Results of defending champions 
New Zealand and South Africa are the only nations to successfully defend the World Cup as defending champions in 2015 and 2023 respectively.
