The Michael Kelly Guitar Company is a US musical instrument company founded in 1999 and based in Clearwater, Florida. Michael Kelly imports high quality instruments manufactured to their specifications (mainly from South Korea). The company has recently gained popularity, particularly due to the release of their new Mod Shop Guitars, where they take some of their standard designs and swap out the pickups using Lindy Fralin, Seymour Duncan, TV Jones, Bare Knuckle and Fishman.

Michael Kelly gained popularity due to their Dragonfly II acoustic bass, which has been used by Duff McKagan of Guns N' Roses, Shavo Odadjian of System of a Down, and Tony Bigley of Souls Harbor.

Current line of products commercialised by Michael Kelly includes electric and acoustic guitars, basses, acoustic and electric mandolins.
