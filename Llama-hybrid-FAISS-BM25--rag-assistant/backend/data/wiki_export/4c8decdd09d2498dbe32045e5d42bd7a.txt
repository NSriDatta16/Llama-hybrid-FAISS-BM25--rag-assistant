History 
Pulloxhill is one of the oldest villages in Bedfordshire being well over 1000 years old, and still has a Norman Church.  It is the oldest known home of the Bunyan family and near where John Bunyan was arrested.

Pulloxhill is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as having 11 villagers, 13 smallholders and 2 slaves, under Lord Freeman-Eight. Tenant-in-Chief at the time was Nigel of Aubigny.

In 1680 it was thought that gold had been discovered in the village and a mine was established, this was however abandoned shortly afterwards. It is believed that what was actually discovered was flakes of mica in quartz, giving the appearance of gold. It is possible that the silver mine of Demas referred to in Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress was inspired by the gold mine in Pulloxhill.

There are records of 'Fort' or 'Castle' within the parish, most probable due to the elevated nature of the geography, however the remains are on private land and not viewable without the current land-owner's permission.

Elizabeth Ocle of Pulloxhill was hanged in Bedford in 1596 for practicing witchcraft.

Julius Drewe, businessman and retailer, known for creating of the successful Home and Colonial Stores, and for commissioning the building of Castle Drogo in Devon as his family's country home, was born at the vicarage in 1856.
