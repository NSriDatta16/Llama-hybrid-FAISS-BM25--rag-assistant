Birth dearth is a term coined by Ben J. Wattenberg in his 1987 book by the same name. The term refers to the falling fertility rates observed in many modern industrialised nations.  It is often cited as a response to overpopulation but is not incompatible with it. Countries and geographic regions that are currently experiencing falling populations include Russia, Europe, Japan, and populations of people of these descents in other countries such as the United States.

Russia 
Russia is often mentioned in articles concerning birth dearth because of its rapidly declining population, and the proposal by Vladimir Putin to offer women additional benefits for having more children. It is predicted that should current trends continue, Russia's population will be an estimated 111 million in 2050, compared with 147 million in 2000, according to the UN World Population Prospects report (2004 Revision, medium variant).

Europe 

Europe is one of the major geographic regions in the World that is expected to decline in population in the coming years. Europe's population is forecast to decline by nearly 70 million people by 2050, as the total fertility rate has remained perpetually below the replacement rate.
