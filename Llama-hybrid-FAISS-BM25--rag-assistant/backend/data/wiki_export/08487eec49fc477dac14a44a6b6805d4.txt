Reception

Critical reception

2000 Fold received generally positive reviews. The critics gave the album a loud applause and comparing the group with the artists like Prince Paul or Kool Keith. Allmusic gave the album 4 out of 5 stars saying that Styles have professed and display an appreciation for that early-'90s mindset with cleverly used electro-funk samples and rapid rhyming trade offs between Ryu and Takbir. RapReviews gave the album a rating of 9 out of 10 and opposing the censorship in the album saying, "For some reason, this entire album is censored. It makes no sense - but then again, neither does the fact they can freak so many diverse sounds and still retain sanity. If you're not completely satisfied.. well I can't get you your money back, but I'll be damn surprised."

Sputnik music gave the album a rating of 4.5 out of 5, saying that the album is great, and praising the group as, first things first. These guys can rap. No doubt, when you hear the way Ryu and Tak flow you'll be amazed. While Tak presents the smooth-as-silk flow, Ryu brings the punchline pain. A duo of rap Gods that seemed untouchable in that period of time, and even through today they don't go down hard. Safe to say, their debut album is no different.

Track listing

 Only the original 1998 release includes the tracks "Wild Style" and "Many Styles", which were omitted from the reissues because of copyright issues. Additionally, "Exile" was replaced with a new track simply titled "Intro", and the music in "Click Beat Box" was changed.
