The Battle of Campomorto was a battle fought near Frosinone, in the Lazio (Italy) on August 21, 1482, in the course of the War of Ferrara.

It saw the Papal army, led by the condottiero Roberto Malatesta, face King Ferdinand I of Naples's army, under the command of Alfonso, Duke of Calabria.

Malatesta won the clash. According to Niccol√≤ Machiavelli, "this battle was fought with more virtue than any other that had been made in fifty years of Italy".
