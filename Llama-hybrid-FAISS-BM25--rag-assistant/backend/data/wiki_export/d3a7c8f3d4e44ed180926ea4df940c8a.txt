The SpeedyCash.com 250 is an annual NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series race held at the Texas Motor Speedway near Fort Worth, Texas. The race is currently held on the same weekend as the IndyCar Series race at the track, the PPG 375 and is a standalone race for the Truck Series (no other NASCAR series have races at the track that weekend).

History
The race was originally a standalone race for NASCAR in the month of June that shared a weekend with the track's IndyCar Series race, the Genesys 600. In 2021, the NASCAR Cup and Xfinity Series' spring race weekend at Texas, usually in late March or early-to-mid-April, was removed from the schedule and both series joined the Truck Series on the June weekend. The Cup Series race would now be their All-Star Race, which was previously held at Charlotte Motor Speedway. The distance was also shortened from 250.5 miles (403.14 km) to 220.5 miles in 2021, and the race name was changed to reflect the miles (which is the case for most NASCAR races) instead of the kilometers. The race was now 147 laps in length (with the first 2 stages being 35 laps each and the final stage being 77 laps) with the shortened distance.

In 2023, NASCAR moved the Cup Series All-Star Race from Texas Motor Speedway to the reopened North Wilkesboro Speedway and the Truck Series race at Texas became a standalone race (for NASCAR with no other NASCAR series there on that weekend) as it was from 2019 on back. As was also the case for the previous Truck Series standalone races at Texas, the race was held on the same weekend as the track's IndyCar race. Unlike the previous Truck Series/IndyCar race weekends which were in June, their 2023 race weekend was in April. Additionally, the race length of the Truck Series race was increased from 220 miles to 250 miles that year (its former distance from 2020 on back).
