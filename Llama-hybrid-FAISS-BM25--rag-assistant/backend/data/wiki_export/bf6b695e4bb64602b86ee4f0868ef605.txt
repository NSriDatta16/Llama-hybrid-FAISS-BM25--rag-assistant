Edward Hepple (4 June 1914 – 3 September 2005) billed variously as Eddie Hepple and Ted Hepple, was an Australian actor, voice artist, producer, director, playwright and television scriptwriter, known for his roles in theatre, television serials, soap operas and TV movies. His well-known roles were as Sid Humphrey in Prisoner and the voice of the prospector in the animated series The Silver Brumby.

Scriptwriter
Hepple wrote scripts for television productions, (usually billed as "Eddie Hepple") including: Class of '74. and The Dovers. His script for the Homicide episode "The Corrupter" (screened 23 March 1971), is an early example of an Australian television storyline which took a neutral (and arguably sympathetic) attitude to male homosexuality.

Death
Hepole died in Melbourne, Victoria on 3 September 2005, age 91 of unspecified causes.
