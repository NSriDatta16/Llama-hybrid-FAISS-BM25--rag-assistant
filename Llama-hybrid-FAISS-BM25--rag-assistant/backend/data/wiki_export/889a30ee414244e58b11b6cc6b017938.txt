Ohio is divided into 15 congressional districts, each represented by a member of the United States House of Representatives. After the 2010 census, Ohio lost two House seats due to slow population growth compared to the national average, and a new map was signed into law on September 26, 2011. Starting in the 2022 midterms, per the 2020 United States census, Ohio will lose a congressional seat.

Redistricting challenges

2019 challenge

On May 3, 2019, a three-judge panel from the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio declared Ohio's 2012 district map contrary to Article One of the United States Constitution, as "an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander" and ordered "the enactment of a constitutionally viable replacement" prior to the 2020 elections. An appeal made to the U.S. Supreme Court resulted in the order to redraw the map being nullified.

2022 redistricting 

On November 17, 2021, after lengthy discussions, a new map was passed by the Ohio House of Representatives 55-36, along party lines, with no Democrat voting in favor of the map. The map was sent to Governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine, where he accepted it 3 days later on November 20.

The map has been controversial, as Democrats accuse the map of being purposefully designed to benefit Republicans. By December 7, 2021, six lawsuits had been filed against the new 15-seat congressional map, citing it as "racially discriminatory".  The proposed map favors Republican to Democratic districts by a 12-3 margin.

On January 14, 2022, the Ohio Supreme Court declared the map a partisan gerrymander, violating Article XIX of the Constitution of Ohio, in a 4-3 decision. The Ohio General Assembly had 30 days to draw a new map.

On March 16, 2022, the Ohio Supreme Court rejected the new proposed state legislative district map for the third time.  In spite of the decision, the primary elections scheduled to take place on May 3 were held using the second set of districts. Even though the maps were struck down, the state’s constitution allows for the second version to be used for the primary elections because a third proposal won’t be ready until after the May 3 primary.
