The Georgia National Guard is the National Guard of the U.S. state of Georgia, and consists of the Georgia Army National Guard and the Georgia Air National Guard. (The Georgia State Defense Force is the third military unit of the Georgia Department of Defense, part of the Government of Georgia.)  The Constitution of the United States specifically charges the National Guard with dual federal and state missions. The state functions range from limited actions during non-emergency situations to full scale law enforcement of martial law when local law enforcement officials can no longer maintain civil control.

The National Guard may be called into federal service by the President under either Title 10 or Title 32 status. When National Guard troops are called to federal service, the President serves as Commander-in-Chief. The federal mission assigned to the National Guard is: "To provide properly trained and equipped units for prompt mobilization for war, National emergency or as otherwise needed."

The Governor may call individuals or units of the Georgia National Guard into state service during emergencies or to assist in special situations which lend themselves to use of the National Guard. The state mission assigned to the National Guard is: "To provide trained and disciplined forces for domestic emergencies or as otherwise provided by state law."

As authorized under the Constitution, Congress has the power to regulate National Guard units; hence they are trained and equipped as a part of the United States Army, even when under state command.  The same ranks and insignia are used and National Guardsmen are eligible to receive all United States military awards. All Georgia National Guard soldiers are also eligible for a number of state awards for local services rendered in or to the state of Georgia.

Georgia also maintains its own State Defense Force. This force is separate from the National Guard and reports to the Governor of Georgia as Commander-in-Chief. The GSDF services the state exclusively, especially when the National Guard is deployed and unavailable.

The Georgia National Guard has a State Partnership Program relationship with the Georgian Defence Forces since 1994, and Argentina since 2016.

In 2021, in response to a massive spike in COVID-19 cases, more than 100 National Guard personnel were deployed to 20 hospitals across Georgia.
