Controversy
In May 2023, Brown sparked a backlash on social media when she appeared to use a special needs child to attack Catherine, Princess of Wales during Catherine's charity hospital visit. Brown tweeted a photo of Catherine meeting with a little black girl who suffers from achondroplasia wearing a contorted facial expression, and the caption "Let this be a lesson: Black women come here KNOWIN'." The tweet was one of several by Brown claiming that black children and small animals dislike Catherine and display their disapproval when being photographed with her. Reacting to Brown's comments, supporters of the British royal family posted other positive photos of the same interaction and called Brown "angry and bitter" for using an ailing child to "fuel her hate filled narrative".
