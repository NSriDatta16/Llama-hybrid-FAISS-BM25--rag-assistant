Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park (), or GWK, is a tourist destination and attraction located at Ungasan, Badung on the island of Bali, Indonesia, about 10–15 minutes drive from Ngurah Rai International Airport. It is devoted to the Hindu god Vishnu, and his mount, Garuda, the mythical bird who became his companion.

Owned and managed by Alam Sutera Realty, Tbk, the construction of the  statue of Vishnu riding his mount Garuda was completed in August 2018. The park has a land area of about 60 hectares and is  above sea level.

Garuda Wisnu Kencana statue

Designed to be Indonesia’s tallest statue, Garuda Wisnu Kencana was inspired by a story from Hindu mythology about the search for Amrita (the elixir of life).
According to that, Garuda agreed to be ridden by Lord Visnu in return for the right to use the elixir to liberate his enslaved mother.

The idea for the monument was not without controversy, and religious authorities on the island complained that its massive size might disrupt the spiritual balance of the island, and that its commercial nature was inappropriate, but some groups approve of the project, because it will be a new tourist attraction on barren land.

The  tall,  wide statue was designed by Nyoman Nuarta. It sits atop a pedestal to bring the total height of the monument to , which is nearly  taller than the Statue of Liberty in the United States. The completed monument is about as tall as a 21-storey building. It weighs 4000 tonnes, making it the heaviest statue in the country. The statue is made of copper and brass sheeting, with a stainless steel frame and skeleton, as well as a steel and concrete core column. The outer covering measures  in area. The crown of Visnu is covered with golden mosaics and the statue has a dedicated lighting arrangement. The monument was completed on 31 July 2018 and inaugurated by Indonesian President Joko Widodo on 22 September 2018.
