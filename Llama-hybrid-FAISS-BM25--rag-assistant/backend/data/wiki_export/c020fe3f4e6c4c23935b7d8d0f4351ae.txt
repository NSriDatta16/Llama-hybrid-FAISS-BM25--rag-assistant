Tim Pekin (born 22 January 1965) is a former Australian rules footballer in the VFL/AFL.

Recruited from Colac-Coragulac, Pekin debuted with the Fitzroy Football Club in 1984 and was a solid contributor in many positions on the ground. His consistency meant he played 107 games for the club (for 15 goals). 

Pekin was delisted from the cash-strapped Lions at the end of 1989 due to his refusal of a lower salary, so went to the St Kilda Football Club where he was also a noted performer. He also went on to make a name for himself at the Saints, passing the 100-game barrier at a second club to end up with 112 games at the Saints (37 goals).
