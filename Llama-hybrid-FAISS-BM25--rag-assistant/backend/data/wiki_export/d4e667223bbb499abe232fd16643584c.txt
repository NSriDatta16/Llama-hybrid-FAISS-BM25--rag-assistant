Quigley's Point () is a village in County Donegal, Ireland. Located on the eastern shores of Inishowen and overlooking Lough Foyle, the village is sometimes known locally as "Carrowkeel" (or "Carowkeel") as it is in a townland of that name. To the south is the city of Derry and to the north lie the villages of Moville and Greencastle. A car ferry links Greencastle with Magilligan during the summer.  The river Cabry, which flows through the area, is spanned by a late-18th century bridge at Quigley's Point.

Evidence of ancient settlement in the area includes a standing stone site in Cabry townland, and a reputed former cromlech site (since removed) in Carrowkeel townland.

The Presbyterian Church in Ireland has a church at Greenbank near the village. Greenbank Presbyterian Church was built in 1862 in a "Gothic influenced" style. The nearby Presbyterian church hall, which was gutted by fire following an apparent arson attack in 2003, was subsequently restored.

Quigley's Point had a population of 199 people at the time of the 2016 census, down from 227 in the 2011 census.
