Chañaral is a small coastal city and commune in the Atacama Region, Chile and capital of the Chañaral Province.

For this reason, the town was founded in October 26, 1833 as Chañaral de las Ánimas ("Chañar field of the Souls"). A few years later, Pedro Lujan discovered ore at El Salado where a mine was built. In 1836, a shipping port promising raw material was constructed. The great boom Chañaral began in 1860 when A. Edwards & Company was settled where an inn exists today.
