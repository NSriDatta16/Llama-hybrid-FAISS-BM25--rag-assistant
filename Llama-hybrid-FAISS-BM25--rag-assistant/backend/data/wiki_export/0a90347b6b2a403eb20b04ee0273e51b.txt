Michael Allen King (born June 30, 1969 in Washington, D.C., U.S.) is an "Old School/Mid School" former professional Bicycle Motocross (BMX) racer whose prime competitive years were from 1984 to 1998 and is also a former Mountain Bike (MTB) racer who prime competitive years in that discipline were 1993 to 2004.

Biography 

Mike King is the younger sibling of one of the most respected brother combinations of BMX racing: Eddy & Mike King. Of the two King Brothers, Mike had a more dominating career in terms of national titles he won as an amateur and professional. As with most brother combinations the younger brother often live in the shadow of the elder and Eddy King was a well-respected rider with a long career. Mike came out of his brother's shadow when he won his first national title when he became the American Bicycle Association's national number one amateur for 1984 and again in 1987.  Mike turned to the pro class in 1988 and earned the Rookie of Year honor and the National number one pro title. Still without a nickname at the time, although he was also known as "Mikey" by many, he became known as "The Snake" by his competitors for his relentless ability to pass riders during a race.  In 1993, Mike took to mountain bike racing and instantly found success in his rookie year by winning the National Off-Road Bicycle Association’s Dual Slalom National Championships and the coveted Union Cycliste Internationale Downhill Mountain Bike World Championship title in Métabief, France. After multiple international and domestic victories, world cup wins, and national championships, Mike retired from professional cycling in 2005.
 
In 2006, Mike was hired by USA Cycling as the BMX program director and lead Team USA at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China and 2012 Summer Olympics in London, England. During that time, Team USA brought home three Olympic medals to BMX.
 
Mike was inducted into the National BMX Hall of Fame in 1999 and the U.S. Bicycling Hall of Fame in 2013. Currently, Mike works for the City of Rock Hill, SC as the BMX Supervisor of the Novant Health BMX Supercross facility as well consulting and brand ambassador roles in the bicycle industry with companies Vee Tire Co, Felt Bicycles, Turbine, and XRCEL.

Racing career milestones 

Note: Professional first are on the national level unless otherwise indicated.

Started racing: June 29, 1975, one day shy of his sixth birthday and approximately six and a half months after his elder brother Eddy started racing on January 15, 1975 at the Silver Wing BMX track in San Diego, California. Went on a one and a half year hiatus from National racing for most of the 1981 season (he raced at least in one national event, the National Bicycle Motocross Association (NBmxA) 1981 Rancho National near El Cajon, California on August 16) and into the first half of 1982 sticking to only racing on the local level. He returned to National level racing during the 1982 season. Dropped out briefly again for six months in 1983 but returned permanently for the November 1983 ABA Fall Nationals. After his hiatus from racing BMX nationals he came back with renewed commitment stating:"When I was 13 I decided I wanted to make BMX my career!"--Mike King, American BMXer July 1985

1976 No.2
1984 14 Expert Tijuana BMX Cup Champion

*The Tijuana BMX Cup was a one time event held in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico, and sponsored by the International Cycling Organization, Coca-Cola, Carta Blanca, and the State Secretary of Tourism of Baja California. The BMX Association of San Diego after the major BMX governing bodies, the NBL and ABA, declined to sanction the event, ran it. As a result, while heavily promoted it had sparse participation with only 200 racers comprising about 22 motos (including 13 professionals from the United States) out of the hoped for 6000 tourist. A promoter of the race Phil Bartel had anticipated making enough money to build three or four tracks in Tijuana. He instead lost US$5,000. The reason for the low turn out are attributed to the lack of ABA and NBL points for racers touring those circuits, negating an important motivation to attend. A further disincentive was the high entrance fees of $20 and the mere fact that it was in Mexico, a nation with foreign (to Americans) standards of culture and law, even though it was held only a half mile from the border inside Mexico. In May 1984 the BMXA of San Diego merged with the ABA.

*Beginning in the 1985 season the ABA made it possible to earn an amateur national no.1 plate in the age group of the racer, similar to NBL practice. However, the ABA still had an overall National no.1 amateur, which in 1985 was Brent Romero.

International Bicycle Motocross Federation (IBMXF)
1981 11 Expert International Champion
1985 15 Expert Murray World Cup IV Champion.
1986 16 Expert Murray World Cup V Champion.
1987 17 Expert Vision Street Wear World Cup* Champion
1987 Supercross World Champion**

*The Vision Street Wear World Cup was the direct descendant of the Murry World Cup. Murray stopped sponsoring the World Cup after the fifth 1986 edition due to the failure of Murray of Ohio bicycle company and the NBL to come to an agreement about the sponsorship fee Murray would have had to pay the NBL. If Murray continued its sponsor ship, the 1987 addition would have been the sixth (VI) in the series. 
**In Europe, Supercross is a pro/am class in which amateurs could win a limited amount of money but still retain their amateur status. Eddy King's amateur status in the NBL and ABA was unaffected in part because no prize money was awarded. However, this class is different from the Pro World Championship which was held by Gary Ellis in 1987.

It was sponsored by the Yoplait Yogurt company. As such it was also known as the Bicross de Paris Challenge Yop Champion (The Paris Yoplait BMX Challenge) in which American and English pros as well as French pros were brought together to compete in a single race. As with the 1985 addition, which Tommy Brackens won, it was a hit in France with tickets sold out three months in advance.

Introduction of clipless pedals

Mike King, along with fellow racer Brian Lopes, is credited with starting the Mountain Bike racing SPD clipless pedals trend in BMX racing starting in the mid-1990s, moving away from the then standard platform and cage pedals for racing. They both raced with them at the ABA Fall Nationals in Burbank, California on October 22, 1994. There is controversy in BMX over the use of clipless pedals, including that rider can not maneuver their feet off and on the pedals in turns when the racer wants to set up for a pass, or stabilize his or her bicycle in a low-speed, tight turn. This reduces the opportunity to pass riders in the turns, as was commonplace in the 1980s when cage and platform pedals were the norm. Some say that clipless pedals reduce the excitement of BMX races, with the racers "following the leader" and only having the ability to pass on straights. Despite the respect given by the BMX world to Mike King and Brian Lopes, clipless pedals were not used by the majority of pro or amateur racers until the end of the year 2000. It was the late Mario Soto, a young and highly talented rookie pro who broke into the Senior pro ranks and started immediately doing very well despite his comparatively small size and being totally new to the senior pro ranks, that prompted the move. He attributed part of his success to his use of clipless pedals. Today clipless pedals are the norm in BMX racing. Wade Bootes a highly respected Senior Pro was an early adopter of clipless pedals and helped with the move to them.

Another criticism of clipless pedals is that they lead to more injuries since the feet can not be readily be freed from the pedals despite their quick release feature. The racer is prevented from either stabilizing his bike by placing one foot on the ground to prevent a crash or brace himself quickly if a crash is inevitable, leading to more frequent and serious crashes involving leg and foot injury. On August 20, 2007 professional BMX racer Bubba Harris completely dislocated ankle at the talus bone in Beijing, China on the official Olympic BMX racing track during the first run of his Time Trial in the "rhythm section", a series of closely but evenly spaced jumps that you use gravity and "body English" to navigate and maintain speed. He was launched sideways by his momentum into the air, coming down on the back side of a jump with his foot still clipped into an SPD pedal. Doctors almost amputated his foot. With platform pedals his feet would have not been tied to the bicycle which acted like an anchor. As of this time he is still recovering. He expects to race the NBL Christmas Classic BMX race at the end of December 2007. He was able to fulfill that expectation, but he did not make the mains. Mishaps like this, though usually much less catastrophic, have ignited debate in the BMX racing community. This is particularly true among "Old School" veterans of the 1970s and 1980s who raced with caged and platform pedals. Generally the only danger with pedals of these types was that if the rider slipped a pedal, the teeth of the pedal could gouge his shin, thigh or ankle, unless the rider has protective padding.

In a January 7, 2009 interview with Gary Haselhorst on the BMX discussion site "BMX Action Online" Mike King said he went to clipless pedals because, "My motivation to use SPD pedals/shoes had to do with the ABA introducing a pro time trial in 1995. Then it helped me when I was racing mountain bikes. However, I think the clip debate is overrated. I don’t think kids under 10 years old should be racing in them and I believe this has affected how tracks are designed today. They are too many cookie cutter type tracks in this country and this has slowed the progression of the sport.
