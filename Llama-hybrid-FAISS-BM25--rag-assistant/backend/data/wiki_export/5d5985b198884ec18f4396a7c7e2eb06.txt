Slobodan () is a Serbo-Croatian masculine given name which means "free" (sloboda /  meaning "freedom, liberty") used among other South Slavs as well. It was coined by Serbian liberal politician Vladimir Jovanović who, inspired by John Stuart Mill's essay On Liberty baptised his son as Slobodan in 1869 and his daughter Pravda (Justice) in 1871. It became popular in both the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (1918–1945) and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (1945–1991) among various ethnic groups within Yugoslavia and therefore today there are also Slobodans among Croats, Slovenes and other Yugoslav peoples.
 
During the decade after World War II, the name Slobodan (means "freedom") became the most popular Serbian male name, and it remained so until 1980.

Common derived nicknames are Sloba, Slobo, Boban, Boba, Bobi and Čobi.

The feminine counterpart is Slobodanka.
