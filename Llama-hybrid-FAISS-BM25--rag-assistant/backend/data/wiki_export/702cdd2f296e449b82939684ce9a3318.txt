The Argentine Chamber of Phonograms and Videograms Producers (, CAPIF) is an Argentine organization member of the IFPI, which represents the music industry in the country. It is a nonprofit organization integrated by multinational and independent record labels.

Sales certification 

CAPIF launched its Gold and Platinum certification program in 1980. Initially, albums required to sell 30,000 units to become Gold and 60,000 units to become Platinum. CAPIF, however, lowered its certification levels in the beginning of 2001 to reflect the declining sales in the recording industry. In 2016, CAPIF once again lowered its certification levels for albums, digital singles and DVD releases, and introduced certifications for music sets (CD+DVD) and certifications based on streaming for both albums and singles.
