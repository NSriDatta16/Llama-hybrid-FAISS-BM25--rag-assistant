Name and History

The first known human inhabitants of the Township were the Seneca People, who lived in Newbury until they were forcibly removed to Indian Territory in Oklahoma in the 1830s. Newbury Township was part of the Connecticut Western Reserve until 1786, making it part of the State of Connecticut for a period of time.

The name "Newbury" likely came from a town in England or Newburyport, Massachusetts. It is the only Newbury Township statewide.
