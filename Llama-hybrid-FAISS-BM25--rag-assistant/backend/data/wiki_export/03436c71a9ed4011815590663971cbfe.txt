History

Bill Burgess, coach and general manager of the local Intermediate Flyers, formed the Junior Flyers in 1954. They were a Junior B team in the Southwestern League until 1958 when they quit the league.

The Flyers were a part of the BCJBHL 1958 until 1964. When the OHA allowed the Border Cities League to fail in 1964, the town mothballed the junior team and operated a top-notch juvenile team in its stead. In 1966, the team operated as an independent team, playing only in OHA playdowns and exhibition against local all-star, juvenile, and intermediate teams. In 1967, they joined the Western Junior B League.  They entered the new Border Cities league in 1968.  When the league became the Great Lakes Junior C Hockey League in 1970, the Flyers stayed on board.  The Flyers were promoted to the Western Junior "B" league in 1992 and are still a charter member.

On January 3, 1993, the Leamington Flyers helped set a record for the highest scoring tie in the history of the Western Ontario Hockey League by tying the London Nationals 11–11.  The Flyers hold the record for the most lopsided game in the history of the WOHL.  On January 20, 1995, the Flyers defeated the Windsor Bulldogs by a score of 30–3.  On January 26, 2002, the Flyers set the WOHL record for largest margin in a shutout victory by defeating the Aylmer Aces by a score of 16–0.
On Tuesday March 16, 2010, the Leamington Flyers hired Head Coach Tony Piroski.  Previously, as coach of the Essex 73's, Piroski won seven Great Lakes Junior C Hockey League championships and three Clarence Schmalz Cups in nine seasons.

In Piroski's first season the team went from 7 wins to 26 wins, losing Game 7 in overtime to the Lasalle Vipers. In spring 2011 the Flyers brought aboard OHL scout Mike Sadler as the club's general manager.

On May 11, 2015, General Manager Mike Sadler stepped down from the organization. Kevin Hopper takes over as the team General Manager.

April 2, 2018, owner Abe Fehr announced that he had sold the team to five local businessman,  Jason Melo, Dan Jancevski, Cam Crowder, David Halliwill & Craig Mahon. Eight-year Head Coach Tony Piroski also announced he would not be returning to the team. In eight seasons under Piroski the Flyers had a record of 262–108–31 (a .692 winning percentage) in 401 regular-season games with the Flyers and took the team to the conference final four-straight years with two titles.

April 10, 2018, Cam Crowder was named head coach of the Leamington Flyers.  Starting the season with only 10 returning players, Leamington stumbled out of the gate with a 12–8–1–2 record. Following a shocking trade of their top two scorers Maddux Rychel and Griffin Robinson, Leamington went on to finish the regular season 21–4–1–1 and claim the Western Conference regular season title. Leamington played Strathroy in the first round and clinched the series 4–1. Moving on to the conference semifinals Leamington played a tightly contested playoff series coming back from a 1–3 deficit defeating the Komoka Kings on home ice to clinch the series 4–3. In the Western Conference finals the young Flyers team were out matched by a veteran London Nationals team, and were swept 0–4.

Although the season ended in disappointment, Leamington had a very successful season having multiple award winners. Adam Jeffrey Top Rookie Scorer, Ryan Gagnier Rookie of the year, Levi Tetrault Defenceman of year, Zach Borgiel Goalie of year, and Cam Crowder being named coach of the year.

The current version of the Leamington Flyers led by Cam Crowder and General Manager Justin Solcz, take great pride in competing for the Sutherland cup while developing players for higher levels of hockey. The 2018–19 team moved on two players to major junior ( Ryan Gagnier Oshawa Generals and Colton O'Brien Quebec Remparts), and four players to tier II.

The Leamington Flyers and the Ontario Hockey League's Flint Firebirds announced an affiliation agreement in June 2019 prior to the 2019–2020 season.

In the 2022–23 season the Flyers finished the regular season with a record of 35–11–4 for a total of 72 points finishing first in the Western Conference. In the playoffs the Flyers swept the Sarnia Legionnaires and the LaSalle Vipers before defeating the St. Marys Lincolns 4–1 in the Western Conference finals. The Flyers went 2–2 in the Sutherland Cup Round Robin which was enough to advance to the Sutherland Cup Championship Series against the Stratford Warriors. The series went the full seven games and in the seventh and final game on May 9, the Flyers defeated the Warriors 4–0 to capture the franchises first Sutherland Cup. Following the victory, on May 17 the Flyers announce they would be leaving the GOJHL and would be joining the Junior A level Ontario Junior Hockey League for the 2023–24 season.
