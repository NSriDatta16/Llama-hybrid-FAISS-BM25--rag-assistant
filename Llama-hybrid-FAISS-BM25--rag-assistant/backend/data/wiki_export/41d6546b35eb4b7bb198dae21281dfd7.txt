History 
Cheverus High School was established in 1917 as The Catholic Institute High School and renamed Cheverus Classical High School in 1925, after Jean-Louis Lefebvre de Cheverus, the first Bishop of Boston. It was initially located on Free Street, moved to Cumberland Avenue in 1946, and then to its present location on Ocean Avenue in 1952. The school was originally run by the diocesan clergy and the Society of Jesus took over responsibility in 1942.

In 1998, nine male alumni claimed that they had been molested while attending the school. Two former faculty members were accused. The school confirmed the abuse and apologized to the victims. The victims also accused both the school and the Portland Diocese of hiding information, and that they had previously known about the abuse. Settlements to victims have reached a cumulative seven figures, with ongoing counseling additional.
