The Psychedelic Furs is the debut studio album by English rock band the Psychedelic Furs, released on 7 March 1980 by Columbia Records. It was reissued with bonus tracks in 2002 by Columbia/Legacy. In 2020, Rolling Stone included the band's debut studio album in their "80 Greatest albums of 1980" list, praising the musicians for sounding like "a grand art project".

The original UK LP had nine tracks. The US LP contained 10 tracks, deleting one track from the UK LP ("Blacks/Radio") and adding two others ("Susan's Strange" and "Soap Commercial"), and changing the order of the tracks significantly. The CD reissue contained 13 tracks, beginning with the original nine UK LP tracks (programmed in their original order), then adding the two additional tracks from the US LP release, plus a version of "Mack the Knife" and a demo of the album track "Flowers".

Lyrics
In both his delivery and content Richard Butler introduces the sarcastic style which would become his signature and makes use of a number of recurring motifs in the album's lyrics (track numbering refers to the CD issue). 
 "Stupid" (people, friends, dreams, sea) - tracks 1,2,4,6,8.
 "Useless" (lives, sound, drivel) - tracks 1,2,5,7,9.
 "Flowers" - tracks 1,4,5,9.
 "Carpet/Floor" - tracks 1,2,3,9.
 "Dancing/Reeling" - tracks 1,3,5,8.
