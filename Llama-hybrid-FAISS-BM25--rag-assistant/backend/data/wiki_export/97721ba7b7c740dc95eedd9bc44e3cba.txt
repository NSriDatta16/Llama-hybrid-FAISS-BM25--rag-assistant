Etymology
Dharmapuri was called Thagadur during the Sangam era. The name Thagadur is derived from two Tamil words, Thagadu meaning iron ore, and ur meaning place. The name Thagadur was changed to Dharmapuri after the Sangam period, possibly during the period of the Vijayanagara Empire or the period of the Kingdom of Mysore. The name Thagadur is still used by some of the people of Dharmapuri.

History
The region is believed to have been controlled by the Pallava dynasty in the 8th century. The Rashtrakutas took over in the 9th century. They were defeated by the Cholas in the 11th century, and subsequently the district came under the Chola sphere of governance.

During 18th century, present-day Dharmapuri district was part of the Kingdom of Mysore and was called Baramahal. As part of the Treaty of Seringapatam (signed on 18 March 1792) after the Third Anglo-Mysore War, Tipu Sultan agreed to give part of his territories including present-day Dharmapuri district to the British East India Company which was then merged into the Madras Presidency an administrative subdivision of British India.
