Canyon Blaster is an indoor roller coaster at the Adventuredome theme park in Winchester, Nevada. It features back-to-back vertical loops and corkscrews, and ends with a helix inside the mountain that takes up a large portion of the park. It is proclaimed as the world's largest indoor double-loop, double-corkscrew coaster. It's a copy of the original Python roller coaster in Dutch theme park the Efteling.

Canyon Blaster features two six-car trains that seat four passengers in two rows per car. When it originally opened it operated with seven-car trains. In 2001, the trains were re-painted in a dark blue and deep purple heliochrome paint but changed to white and green livery somewhere between 2010 and 2011.

It is the second Arrow coaster to be built for an indoor amusement park. The first was Chicago Loop at Old Chicago in Bolingbrook, Illinois, later relocated to Canobie Lake Park as an outdoor coaster named Canobie Corkscrew.

Ride experience
The train departs from the loading zone and get pulled up the lift. After that, the train drops a bit and curves and makes the 66Â ft. drop, entering the double loops. Afterward, the train turns right into the double corkscrews. Then the train goes into the double helix and pulls back into the station.

Typically a single train is used while the other comes out during busier times.

In media
