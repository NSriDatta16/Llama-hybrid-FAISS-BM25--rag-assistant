The Junior Ryder Cup is a team golf competition between Europe and the United States for junior golfers aged 18 and under. It is based on the men's Ryder Cup and is run by the same organisations, the PGA of America and Ryder Cup Europe.

The 2018 event took place at Golf Disneyland, Marne-la-Vallée, Paris, France on Monday 24 and Tuesday 25 September. The United States won 12–11, their sixth successive victory in the event.

Format
The teams consist of six boys and six girls. From 2008 to 2018 the tournament was played over two days of foursomes, fourball and singles matches. There were three boys' matches and three girls' foursomes matches and six mixed fourball matches on the first day. There were 12 singles matches on the second day, In 2023 the event will be extended to three days with foursomes and fourballs played on the first two days and the singles played on the final day. From 2008 to 2018 there was an informal "friendship match" played on the Ryder Cup course after the Junior Ryder Cup but before the Ryder Cup. However in 2023 the final day singles matches will be played at the host venue. From 1997 to 2006 only fourball matches were played. There were three boys' matches and three girls' matches on the first day and six mixed matches on the second day.

History
In 1995 an informal match was played between European junior golfers and Central New York PGA Section and area juniors. The European team included 15-year-old Sergio García.
