History
Jammu and Kashmir first took part in the Ranji Trophy in 1959-60. Until recent seasons it had always been one of the weaker teams. Its first victory did not come until the 1982-83 season, when it defeated Services by four wickets. As of mid-November 2020 it had played 301 matches in the competition and won only 32 times, against 199 losses.

In recent seasons Jammu and Kashmir has been more successful. In 2013–14, the team qualified for the knockout stage of the Ranji Trophy after a gap of more than 10 years. Placed in Group C, the state team, which last qualified for the knockout stage in 2001–02 season, notched up four outright wins in the league round to pip Goa by .001 points on net run rate for a berth in the quarterfinals. Later in 2015-16, the team led by Parvez Rasool defeated heavyweights Mumbai at Wankhade Stadium. However, in the following seasons, the team again lost the rhythm. In the ongoing 2018-19 season, they won three out of nine games played, finishing at number six in Group C points-table.

Sunil Joshi was the former coach of the team. In 2014, the side tasted early success under him by beating the Ranji giants Mumbai cricket team at Wankhede Stadium in the prelim rounds of Ranji Trophy in 2014–15.

The board appointed Irfan Pathan as mentor cum player of the team ahead of the 2018-19 season. He went to Jammu and Kashmir a few months before the start of domestic season and spent his time with the youngsters there.
