Talgje (or Sør-Talgje) is a populated island in the eastern part of Stavanger municipality in Rogaland county, Norway. The  island is located in the Talgjefjorden and Brimsefjorden, both arms off of the main Boknafjorden in a large archipelago of islands northeast of the city of Stavanger. It is surrounded by islands: Brimse to the south, Rennesøy to the west, Finnøy to the north, and Fogn to the northeast.  The island has a lot of agricultural uses, especially in growing tomatoes.

The island has a long history.  The farm that today is known as Gard was once the seat of major clans that controlled the western part of Norway.  Gaute Erlingson was a nobleman from the 1200s who lived here. Talgje Church dating from around the year 1100 is located here.

The Talgjefjord Tunnel connects the island to the larger island of Rennesøy which in turn is connected to the mainland through a series of tunnels and bridges. There are also ferries that run from eastern Talgje to the island of Fogn and to the village of Tau on the mainland.
