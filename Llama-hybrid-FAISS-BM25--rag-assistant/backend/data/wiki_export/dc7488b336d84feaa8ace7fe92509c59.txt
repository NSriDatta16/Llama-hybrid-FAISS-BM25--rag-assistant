History
Sandia View Academy was established in 1939 as the Spanish-American Seminary and operated by the General Conference to train young men and women of Hispanic origin to serve as workers in the Spanish-speaking areas in the Canada and Latin American countries.
 
For a time the Spanish-American Seminary operated as a junior college. Spanish-speaking students from almost all the Latin-American countries enrolled, in addition to Hispanic-Americans from California, Colorado, Arizona, Texas, New York, and other areas of the United States.

This was one of four seminaries operated at various times by the church to serve special language groups. The other schools were Clinton Theological Seminary (German); Humpinson Theological Seminary (Danish and Norwegian); and Broadview Seminary (Swedish).
 
In 1951 the General Conference voted to turn the Spanish-American Seminary property and buildings over to the Texico Conference for adoption as the conference secondary boarding school.

In 2010 the property was sold and plans were made to build a new school in Rio Rancho, New Mexico.
