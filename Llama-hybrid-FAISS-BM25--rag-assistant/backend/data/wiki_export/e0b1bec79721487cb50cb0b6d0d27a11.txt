The Days of Our Nights is the fifth album by American alternative rock band Luna, currently out of print in the United States. It includes a cover of the Guns N' Roses hit "Sweet Child o' Mine".

Release
The album was recorded as Luna's fifth LP for Elektra Records, a part of the WEA music family. Because of the major label consolidations that occurred in the late 1990s, many alternative bands signed to major labels were dropped in this time period, including Luna. In an ironic twist, the album was picked up by Jericho records, a subsidiary of Sire Records, which is also part of the Warner Bros. Records family. It would, however, prove to be the final album by the band to receive major-label distribution.

The track "The Old Fashioned Way" is featured during the opening scene of the 2001 American crime/drama Kill Me Later starred  by actress Selma Blair.
