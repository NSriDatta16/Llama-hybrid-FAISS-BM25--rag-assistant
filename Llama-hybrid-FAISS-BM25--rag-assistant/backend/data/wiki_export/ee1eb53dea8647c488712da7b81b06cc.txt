Sample of the translated lyrics:
You are a flower of love, I am a flower of romance
Seizing time, shaking
A tale of the moon, a tale of the stars, I continued to pray
You are a trap of love, I am a trap of romance; seizing everything, we'll sleep
A tale of the wind, a tale of a dream, an illusion that won't fade
