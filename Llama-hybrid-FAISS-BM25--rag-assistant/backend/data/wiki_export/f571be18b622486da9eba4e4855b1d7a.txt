Great American Scream Machine (GASM) is a wooden roller coaster located at Six Flags Over Georgia in Austell, Georgia, United States. Manufactured by Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters, the ride opened in 1973 as the tallest, longest, and fastest roller coaster in the world. Often shortened to GASM, the  ride reaches a maximum speed of . At the time of opening, early riders were given a "Red Badge of Courage" button for riding the coaster. On May 21, 2017, Great American Scream Machine received an ACE landmark designation from American Coaster Enthusiasts, recognized for becoming the first wooden coaster built by Six Flags and for being well maintained.

History

Construction of Great American Scream Machine was subcontracted to Marvin M. Black & Sons. It officially opened to the public on March 31, 1973.

In the spring of 1993, Great American Scream Machine ran backwards for its 20th anniversary. The same thing would occur for its 45th anniversary in 2018.

Operational Information
A computerized block system is used to prevent trains from contacting each other. Great American Scream Machine has 5 blocks: Station, Transfer Table, Lift, Main Brake and Ready Brake. Normal operation uses two trains; however, it can be operated with only one. During two-train operation, if the train in the station has not fully exited the loading platform, the inbound train will stop abruptly in the Main Brakes. A combination of proximity switches, mechanical switches, photoelectric sensors and timers are all used by the controller to track train movements.

Each train consists of four cars with three rows per car, two riders per row, holding 24 total riders. Each row has a lap bar and a seat belt. Until the 2018 season, the lap bar itself was locked and unlocked by an electrical current that activates solenoids on the train, resulting in a "buzzing" electrical sound. They could be troublesome, sometimes requiring the operating crew to manually unlock the lap bar for a rider. For the 2018 season, the former Georgia Cyclone trains were added, which allowed for more reliable and safe lap bars to be installed on this ride. Each train consists of six cars with two rows per car, two riders per row, holding 24 riders total. The trains ride on steel wheels with guide wheels and upstops attached. The track is plank wood stacked 7 planks high, with steel running surfaces on the top, bottom and sides (locations where the running, guide and upstop wheels contact the track).

Before computerized control existed, operators used a lever to operate the brake system and dispatch trains. The operator near the end of the station controlled the main brakes at the end of the circuit; the operator at the front of the station operated the brakes at the station platform only and worked to dispatch trains to the lift.
