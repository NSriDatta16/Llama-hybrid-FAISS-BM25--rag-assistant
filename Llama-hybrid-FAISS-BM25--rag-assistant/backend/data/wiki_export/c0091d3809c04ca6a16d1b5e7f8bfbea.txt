Ready Records was a small but influential independent record label based out of Toronto, Canada that signed a number of new wave and indie rock bands from the early to mid-1980s.  Focusing primarily on local Toronto-area talent, it released 7" and 12" singles, LPs, and cassettes. Founded in 1979 by Angus MacKay and Andy Crosbie, the label existed between 1979 and 1985, when it folded.

Its best selling group was the Spoons, but other acts that had minor hits or received national attention included Blue Peter, Colin Linden, and Manteca.

As part of their 20th Century Masters series, Universal released two collections entitled Best of Ready Vol. 1 and Best of Ready Vol. 2.
