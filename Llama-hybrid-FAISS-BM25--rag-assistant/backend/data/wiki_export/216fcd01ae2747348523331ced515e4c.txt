Grants/Cibola County Schools is a school district based in Grants, New Mexico, United States.

Attendance area
GCCS's attendance boundary includes most of Cibola County, New Mexico, including the city of Grants. Exceptions are areas on the Zuni Reservation and Fence Lake. While the Ramah Navajo Indian Reservation is physically within Grants/Cibola County Schools, children going to non-tribal public schools are bussed to Ramah's schools, which are operated by the Gallup-McKinley County Schools. The proximity of the nearest schools in Cibola County were so far,  away, that Cibola and McKinley counties agreed to have students on the reservation sent to McKinley County schools, including Ramah Elementary School and Ramah Middle/High School.
