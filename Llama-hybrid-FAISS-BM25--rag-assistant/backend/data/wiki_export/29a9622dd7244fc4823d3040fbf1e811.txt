Branham High School is a secondary school in San Jose, California, located in the Cambrian neighborhood within the West San Jose region. It originally opened on September 13, 1967, under the Campbell Union High School District (CUHSD) before closing in 1991. The District leased the campus to Valley Christian Schools in 1991. The school was reopened by CUHSD in 1999 due to increased enrollment within the district. It is named after Isaac Branham, a Californian pioneer who became a successful farmer and lumber mill owner. 

The colors of Branham High School are navy blue, Columbia blue, and white and the official mascot is the Bruin.

As of March 2022, the school also has a boba drink dedicated to them by the locally owned business Boba Pub called "Blu's Bev". This was made possible through a partnership between the business and Branham's associated student body (ASB).
