Clenchwarton is a village, civil parish and electoral ward in the English county of Norfolk. It is located about  west of the River Great Ouse, about   from the town of King's Lynn on the east side of the river.

History
Clenchwarton's name is of Anglo-Saxon origin and derives from the Old English for a hill dweller's farmstead or settlement.

In the Domesday Book, Clenchwarton is recorded as an abandoned village with no recorded population in the hundred of Freebridge. The village was part of the estates of William d'Ecounis. The abandonment of the village was likely the result of the Norman reprisals in retaliation for the Ely Rebellion of 1070, led by Hereward the Wake.

The village was also surveyed by the Victorian traveller, John Marius, in the 1870s. He wrote the following about the village in the Imperial Gazetteer: "church is old but good. There are a N.Methodist chapel, and a national school."

St. Margaret's Church
Clenchwarton's parish church is of Norman origin and is dedicated to Saint Margaret of Scotland. The church was significantly remodelled in the Fourteenth, Fifteenth and Nineteenth Centuries and is Grade II listed.

Clenchwarton is also home to a Methodist Church which still hosts regular services.
