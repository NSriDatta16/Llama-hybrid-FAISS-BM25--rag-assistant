The Kromfohrländer ( ) commonly known as Kromi is a breed of dog that originated in Germany. It is used as a companion dog. Particularly long lived, reaching 17-18 years old regularly. Very attached to their owners, often being described as a "one-person dog".

Appearance

The Kromfohrlander comes in 2 coat variations: rough hair (Rauhaar) and smooth hair (Glatthaar). The distinction is the presence of a beard on the rough variety and a rather long coat on the furnishings of the smooth variety. Therefore, the rough resembles a terrier, while the smooth looks rather like a spaniel.

Temperament
The Kromfohrlander is a very lively, emotionally and physically sensitive, athletic, good-natured, intelligent breed. They love to play and run, are very active and have comparatively little hunting instinct.

Kromfohrlanders have quirky personalities and are warm and friendly with their own chosen people, from whom they rarely wander. They can adapt to many situations, including being re-homed, fairly well with patient training and socializing. They take to strangers and children rather hesitantly at first, but once they become familiar, remain friends for life. They are very selective with dog friends and are quick to engage with those it dislikes. They will also engage with other dog family members in disputes, so awareness, management and supervision is always recommended. It is generally good with cats but should be supervised with very small pets and farm animals. Their active nature has often led to injury when off leash, so a harness with leash or supervision is recommended.

Health
It is a breed with very limited genetics and health issues that have been observed include: 

cystinuria

epilepsy

frontonasal dysplasia 

heart murmur

ivermectin sensitivity

hyperkeratosis

liver shunt

von Willebrand Disease Type 1 

Breeding dogs and puppies should have a wide panel DNA health screening test, especially for hyperkeratosis and VWD1.

History

Origin
The Kromfohrlander originated in Germany in 1945. It is the only dog breed descended from a military mascot dog. The origin dog was found as a stray in France by American soldiers during the end of World War II. The little dog came over to Germany with his troop and was abandoned. He was discovered by musician Ilsa Schleifenbaum, who named him 'Peter' and decided to create a companion breed after an accidental litter with a neighbor's fox terrier, "Fiffi," produced puppies of similar appearance. Primarily these puppies and one other female dog (and with assistance from her friend Otto Borner, a German Kennel Club member) the breed was developed over 10 years. It obtained full recognition in Germany in 1955.

The Kromfohrlander remains an exceptionally rare breed, by original design even in its country of origin. Ms. Schleifenbaum's original principles included fairness, honesty, sharing information and not overbreeding. 
 
It has been established in Switzerland, Austria, Finland (with Maria Åkerblom), Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Belgium, The Netherlands and in The United States with Mary Dixon  (also the founder of Wirehaired Portuguese Podengo Medios in the USA and one of the founders of Berger Picards in the USA). 
From the USA it was exported to Canada, Mexico, France and back to Finland.
