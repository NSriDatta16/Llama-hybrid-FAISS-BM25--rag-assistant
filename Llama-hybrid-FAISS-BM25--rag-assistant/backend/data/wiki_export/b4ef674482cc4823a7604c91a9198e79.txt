Wizzard Brew is the debut album by rock group Wizzard, released in 1973 on EMI's Harvest label. It reached a peak of No. 29 in the UK Albums Chart. In the United States, it was released by United Artists Records as Wizzard's Brew (with a different cover photo) but failed to chart there.

In 2003, Mojo magazine ranked it number 18 on its list of the "Top 50 Eccentric Albums".

Release

The original release included an insert with song lyrics on one side and photos of the band members on the other. It was reissued on CD in 1999 but was soon deleted. An expanded remastered edition, which includes all the A-sides and B-sides of the group's first four singles from 1972–1973 as bonus tracks, was released on CD in November 2006.

Wizzard Brew is a very eccentric album, starting with a typical heavy glam rock song lasting 4:36 on the first track, but then moving to an eclectic mixture of all sorts of sound lasting a marathon 13:30 on the second track, which includes jazz elements and a long period of duelling saxophones. The third track, lasting a short 2:08, is a sergeant major style military march, before then moving on to fast paced rock and roll on the fourth and fifth tracks, with the fifth track reminiscent of Elvis Presley sound. The sixth track, lasting 9:10, slows the pace down and mixes rock, pop melody, classical music and a verse of "Abide with Me" as the final lyrics.

Reception

Stephen Thomas Erlewine, in a retrospective review for AllMusic, felt that Roy Wood differentiated between the accessibility of Wizzard's singles and the "real art" of Wizzard Brew.

Wood frequently used ring modulation to give the instruments a harsh, distorted sound.  Critical and popular reaction was mixed.
