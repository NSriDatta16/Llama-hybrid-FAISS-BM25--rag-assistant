Lakeshore Catholic High School is a high school located in Port Colborne, just north of the eastern edge of Lake Erie, in Ontario, Canada. It is part of the Niagara Catholic District School Board, and competes with students from communities in Fort Erie, Wainfleet, Dunnville and Port Colborne.  The city is also serviced by a community based public high school, Port Colborne High School. 

Lakeshore is home to over 1100 students from across southern Niagara, stretching from Fort Erie to Dunnville. Lakeshore Catholic is known for its highly competitive and well-respected athletics department that competes in Level 1 play. The Gator football team currently plays in Zone 1 Premier League for Zone 3, SOSSA and OFSAA. Gator football has made three previous trips to both Ivor Wynn Stadium and SkyDome (Rogers Centre) to play for one of the five provincial championship bowl games, winning in 2004 for southern Ontario and placing second in southern Ontario 2006 for an overall tie for fifth place. They have gone back to back in 2008 winning again and in 2009 and 2010 they were defeated by Notre Dame of Burlington. It is also the home of a music/arts department.

The school was founded in 1988 by Principal Pat Hudak to support the growing population of Catholic students in the area. Since then, the school has expanded twice, with another addition and multiple renovations currently on the books. 

The school has been home to current NCDSB Director of Education John Crocco. Subsequent to the election, Mike Lostracco was transferred and became principal of St. Paul Catholic in Niagara Falls. The current principal of Lakeshore Catholic is Denise Robertson.
