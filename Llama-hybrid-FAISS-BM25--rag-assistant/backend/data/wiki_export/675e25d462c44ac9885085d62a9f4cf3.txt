The Birmingham School of Law is a state-accredited law school located in Birmingham, Alabama.  Founded in 1915 by Judge Hugh A. Locke, a judge of the Chancery Court and president of the Birmingham Bar Association, the Birmingham School of Law offers a part-time program of study in which graduates receive the Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree.

Program of study
The school is located in downtown Birmingham. Birmingham School of Law has renovated a historical building into an educational facility. The school consists of an auditorium, mock courtroom, legal library, computer lab, and multimedia classrooms. In the past, classes were held at Birmingham-Southern College, the Birmingham YMCA, the historic Frank Nelson Building in downtown Birmingham, and the Jefferson County Courthouse.  Birmingham School of Law is a four-year law school

Accreditation and bar exam performance
Graduates are eligible to take the Alabama Bar Exam pursuant to the authority granted by the Alabama Legislature and the Alabama Supreme Court. The Birmingham School of Law is not accredited by the American Bar Association, nor is the school seeking accreditation. As a result, graduates are generally not allowed to take the bar exam and practice in other states.  

At the July 2022 sitting of the Alabama bar exam, 20.8% of Birmingham School of Law's first-time takers passed, compared to 78.9% for the state as a whole.
