The village bordered on the Annaburg Heath and the villages of Zwiesigko, Schöneicho, Kähnitzsch, Hohndorf and Plossig.

Lebien was once a branch of Axien and only later got its own church.

From 1815 to 1944, Lebien was part of the Prussian Province of Saxony and from 1944 to 1945 of the Province of Halle-Merseburg.

After World War II, Lebien was incorporated into the Province (since 1947, State) of Saxony-Anhalt from 1945 to 1952 and the Bezirk Cottbus of East Germany from 1952 to 1990. Since 1990, Lebien has been part of Saxony-Anhalt, since 2011 as a part of Annaburg.
