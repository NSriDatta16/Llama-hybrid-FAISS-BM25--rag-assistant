The Teaches of Peaches is the second studio album by Canadian recording artist Merrill Nisker, and her first under the stage name Peaches. It was released on September 5, 2000, by Kitty-Yo. Her roommate Feist contributed vocals for the album.

In 2002, XL Recordings re-released the album and as well put out an "Expanded Edition" featuring a bonus disc.

Writing and development
After creating a six-track "Lovertits" EP, Peaches moved to Berlin, Germany. While visiting her old friend Jason Beck, who was enjoying modest European success as Chilly Gonzales in Berlin, Peaches landed a one-night gig. On the merits of that show alone, Berlin's Kitty-Yo label signed her on the spot. The label offered her the chance to record The Teaches of Peaches back home in Toronto.

Composition
Musically, The Teaches of Peaches, like many other electroclash albums, draws from 1980s new wave music. It incorporates the Roland MC-505 and lo-fi beats in songs such as "AA XXX", which also features a roller-rink electro bassline. "Sucker" and "Rock Show" employ guitar and Runaways-like singing.

Lyrically, many of the songs on The Teaches of Peaches deal with pro-sex postfeminist themes. "Felix Partz" is a tribute to Felix Partz, a Canadian artist who was associated with the arts collective General Idea.

Critical reception

The Teaches of Peaches received generally favorable reviews. The album holds a score of 73 out of 100 on the review aggregator website Metacritic. Heather Phares from AllMusic said, "Funny, sexy, outrageous, and danceable (not to mention endlessly quotable) all at once, The Teaches of Peaches is a great introduction to a unique artist who defines herself by gleefully blurring boundaries."  Likewise, Mark Desrosiers of Popmatters described the album as "one of the year's defining albums."

The Guardian included The Teaches of Peaches in its 1000 Albums to Hear Before You Die. Slant Magazine placed it at #236 on its Best of the Aughts: Albums list.  SPIN placed it at #10 on the Ten Memorable Albums From Forgotten Genres for electroclash.  The Village Voice ranked it among the Best Albums of 2000.

At a performance on July 22, 2015, Trey Anastasio of Phish called The Teaches of Peaches the "greatest album ever".

In 2015, the album won the 2000s category of the inaugural Slaight Family Polaris Heritage Prize, an annual Canadian music award for classic albums released prior to the creation of the Polaris Music Prize.

The Teaches of Peaches was included on The Guardian'''s 100 Best Albums of the 21st Century list, based on a 2019 poll of music writers.

"The first four tracks are incredible," remarked Iggy Pop. "The way she uses the drum machine gives it a great sense of space. 'Fuck the Pain Away' is a great song. It sounds like the title to a Stooges track."

The first track was used in the film Lost in Translation'', although it was not included on the soundtrack.
