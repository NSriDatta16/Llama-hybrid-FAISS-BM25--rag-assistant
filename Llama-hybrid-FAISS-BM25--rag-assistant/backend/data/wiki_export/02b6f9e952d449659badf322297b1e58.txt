"Anthony Thornton is a better writer than Lester Bangs" Peter Doherty

Reviews

 "Bound Together reads like a great thriller, yet has moments - like an exceptional passage on an impromptu Doherty gig in Chelsea that helped split the band - that evoke the poetry, courage and optimism that surrounded Doherty at his best" Q **** Recommended
 "[Sargent's] shots reclaim the band from the tabloids' caricature portrayal and stand as a fine testament to their rebellious, joyous, yet ultimately destructive Arcadian dream. Anthony Thornton's accompanying text is equally enrapturing." Mojo ****
 "An intelligent and pacy exploration of a musical phenomenon" The Independent
 "...the story of the band and the fallout from their split is recorded in intimate detail. Thornton and Sargent, with full access to the battling frontmen, had a unique insight into their complex relationship" UNCUT
 "A nicely produced book...Thornton's intention is to give a good, respectful account of the artistic project of Barat and Doherty, and in this the book is a success." Independent on Sunday. Consequently, the critics of the Independent on Sunday voted it book of the week on 26 March 2006.
 "Writer Thornton and photographer Sargent really were on the spot (be it the van, the pub, the East End squat or the dressing room) while most of the squalid Libertines saga went down, capturing the queasy zigzags of the bands career." The Sunday Times
 "Pete Doherty and Carl Barat fans should check out a new history of The Libertines, called Bound Together. After a couple of poor books on Pete this is the first I can recommend." The Sun
 "The photographs tell the story as movingly as any text possibly could....What's surprising especially for me - who couldn't give a monkey's about Peter 'n' bloody Carl - is just how involving the book actually is... [it's] driven by a literate, witty narration... hugely entertaining." The Word
