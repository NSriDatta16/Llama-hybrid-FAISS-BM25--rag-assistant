Dalton Trumbo's Reluctant Cabaret, or simply Reluctant Cabaret are a musical comedy double act. 

Reluctant Cabaret are made up of Lord Trumbo and Lady Hugo with special guest appearances from the Reverend Po Chi. Trumbo used to have a dutiful man servant, Jenifer, but he was sacked for stealing the naughty juice.

Their brand of comedy is absurd, silly and musical.
