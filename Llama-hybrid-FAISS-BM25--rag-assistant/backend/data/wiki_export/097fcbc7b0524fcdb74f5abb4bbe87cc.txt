Formerly known as "Yenişehir", Karacasu is reached by turning off the Aydın - Denizli road south-east at Kuyucak and following the Dandalaz River upstream into the hills. The road is windy and the surrounding countryside is planted with olives, citrus fruits and as you get higher up, pines. 

The ruins of the ancient city of Aphrodisias are located within the boundaries of Karacasu, near the small town of Geyre.

The ruins include a stadium, Temple of Aphrodite, theatre, agora and a bath with the heating system still visible.
