Harry Mullan was an Irish boxing writer and journalist. He died on 21 May 1999 at the age of 53 after suffering from cancer for  four years. Born Patrick Henry Pearse Mullan in Portstewart, Northern Ireland, on 22 April 1946, Mullan was educated at St Patrick's College, Armagh and University College Dublin. He edited the British trade paper, Boxing News for 19 years, from 1977 until 1996. Only Gilbert Odd, Mullan's mentor, had a longer tenure. Mullan was an authoritative and principled writer, never afraid to highlight perceived injustice, and conveyed an innate understanding of the sport's political structure.

He wrote many books on boxing and was held in high regard in the United States, where he covered many bouts and was posthumously inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2005. Mullan also contributed regularly to television and radio coverage of the sport. In the 1990s, Mullan worked as the boxing correspondent for  the Sunday Times and later for the Independent on Sunday.

He was buried in Glenullin, beside his father, according to his wish to come home to Ireland in death.  He has since been exhumed and reburied in England.
