The 1983–84 season of the European Cup Winners' Cup was won by Juventus in a final against Porto. The next year, the club went on to complete a full complement of European trophies with the European Cup. Aberdeen were the defending champions, but were eliminated in the semi-finals by Porto.

Universitatea Craiova, winners of the 1983 Romanian Cup Final, had their entry rejected since the Romanian Football Federation scheduled the Cup Final for one week after the closing date for entries. As a result, Andrei Rădulescu and Florin Dumitrescu, the president and secretary of the Federation, were sacked.
