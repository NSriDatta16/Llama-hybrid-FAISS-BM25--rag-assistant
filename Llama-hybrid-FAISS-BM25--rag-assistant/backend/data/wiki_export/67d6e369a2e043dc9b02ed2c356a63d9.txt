American singer Lindsay Lohan has released two studio albums and six singles. While acting in the Disney films Freaky Friday (2003) and Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen (2004), Lohan began recording songs for the soundtracks. In September 2002, Emilio Estefan, Jr. had signed Lohan to a five-album contract. The deal was later scrapped and Lohan signed on to Casablanca Records in 2004, under the management of Tommy Mottola. Speak, her debut album, was released in December 2004. The record peaked at number 4 on the Billboard 200 and earned a Platinum certification. Speak spawned Lohan's first single, "Rumors", which eventually earned a Gold certification, as well as a nomination for Best Pop Video at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards.

Lohan's second album, A Little More Personal (Raw), was released in December 2005. The album peaked at number 20 on the Billboard 200, gaining Gold certification in early 2006. The first and only single from the album, "Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)", peaked at number 57 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it Lohan's first song to debut on the chart. In 2007, Lohan commenced work on a third album following a move to the Universal Motown label. A promotional single, "Bossy", released in May 2008, was written by Ne-Yo and Stargate. The album was initially due for release in late 2008, however, Lohan announced in November 2008 that work on the album had stalled. In 2010, it was believed that she was still recording an album after the long wait. In July 2019, it was confirmed that Lohan was working on new music with Universal Republic's Casablanca Records again, and teased the track "Xanax" on social media. The single "Back to Me" was then released on April 3, 2020. In 2022, she revealed being focused on her acting career and new music would likely only come in soundtrack form, adding, "I've done a ton of songs that are sitting, waiting. Maybe five years down the line, I'll do another album."
