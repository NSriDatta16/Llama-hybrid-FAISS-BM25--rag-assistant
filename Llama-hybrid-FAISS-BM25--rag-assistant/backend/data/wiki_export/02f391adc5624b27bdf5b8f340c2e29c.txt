Ribérac (; ) is a commune in the Dordogne department in Nouvelle-Aquitaine in southwestern France. The commune is situated by the Dronne River.

History

In response to the 848 Norman plunder of nearby Brantôme, a fort was built near a ford of the Dronne. Around the year 1000, the castle of Ribérac was built on a hill where the current cemetery is. Houses are set up at the foot of the walls, descending towards the valley. After the Wars of Religion, in the late 1500s, the castle was abanonded and was in ruins by the time of the French Revolution.

In 1790, Ribérac became the prefecture of the District of Ribérac (). In 1793, the commune of La Faye joined with Ribérac. In 1800 Ribérac became one of the four sub-prefectures of the Dordogne. In 1851, part of the commune moved to the new commune of Saint-Martin-de-Ribérac. 
In 1926, the Arrondissement of Ribérac was disbanded, and Ribérac joined the Arrondissement of Périgueux.

Despite the efforts of local Maquis resistance fighters, the area was occupied by the German army in March 1944.
