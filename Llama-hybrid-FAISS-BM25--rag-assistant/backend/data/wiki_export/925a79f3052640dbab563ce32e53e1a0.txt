The Diocese of Macau (; ) is a Latin Church ecclesiastical territory or diocese of the Catholic Church, in contrast with the Diocese of Hong Kong, which is, de jure, part of the Ecclesiastical Province of Guangdong.

The territory of the Diocese of Macau encompasses Macau, a special administrative region of China. In theory, a part of Guangdong province also belongs to the diocese, but in practice, the diocese is limited to Macau.

Its cathedral is the Cathedral of the Nativity of Our Lady.

Its patron saints are Francis Xavier and Catherine of Siena, and its motto is Scientia et Virtus (Knowledge and Virtue).

Stephen Lee Bun-sang is the current bishop and the third Chinese bishop of the diocese.

History 
It was established on January 23, 1576, by the edict of Pope Gregory XIII, on vast territory split off from Roman Catholic Diocese of Malacca. It originally covered China, Japan, Vietnam and the Malay archipelago, with the exception of the Philippines. From its founding, the diocese was a suffragan diocese of the Archdiocese (soon Patriarchate) of Goa, in Portuguese India.

It gradually lost most of its territory, in and around continental China:
 on February 19, 1588, to establish the Diocese of Funai (Japan)
 on September 9, 1659, Pope Alexander VII issued the papal bull Super cathedram principis apostolorum to establish and define the jurisdiction of the Apostolic Vicariate of Tonkin (Northern Vietnam, Laos and five adjacent provinces of southern China: Yunnan, Guizhou, Huguang, Sichuan, Guangxi), the Apostolic Vicariate of Cochinchina (Central Vietnam and five provinces of southeastern China: Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Hainan), and Apostolic Vicariate of Nanjing (including five adjacent provinces: Beijing, Shanxi, Shandong, Korea and Tartary).
In 1696, Pope Innocent XII returned the provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi, and the island of Hainan to its authority.
 on April 22, 1841, to establish the then-Apostolic Prefecture of Hong Kong
 on May 10, 1848, to establish the then-Apostolic Vicariate of Guangdong-Guangxi including Hainan 
 on April 9, 1940, to establish the Diocese of Díli (on Timor)

It was made exempt in 1975, following Portugal's loss of sovereignty over Goa, its former metropolitan.

It now only administers Macau alone, the last regions outside Macau under its administration were the parishes of Saint Joseph in Singapore (re-united with the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Singapore c. 1972) and St. Peter's Church in Malacca (now as part of Roman Catholic Diocese of Malacca-Johor), which separated from the Diocese of Macau in 1981.
