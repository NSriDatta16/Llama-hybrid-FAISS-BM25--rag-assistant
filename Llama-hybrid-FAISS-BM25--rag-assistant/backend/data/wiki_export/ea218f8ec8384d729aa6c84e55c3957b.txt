Controversies

Kavim's service has often been criticized, especially in Petah Tikva. In April 2008, Avi Blustein, a member of the city council, proposed to create a committee which would inspect Kavim's operations within the city. Kavim responded that Blustein was 'hurting its good reputation out of political considerations'.

In 2008, a Kavim driver was arrested for dealing drugs on his bus routes. Kavim stated in response that this did not reflect the company or its drivers.

On October 6, 2010, 30 buses belonging to Kavim in Afula were taken out of service following a raid by the police, due to severe safety violations, ranging from broken seats to worn out tires.

Criticism

Involvement in Israeli settlements

On 12 February 2020, the United Nations published a database of companies doing business related in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, as well as in the occupied Golan Heights. Kavim was listed on the database on account of its activities in Israeli settlements in these occupied territories, which are considered illegal under international law.
