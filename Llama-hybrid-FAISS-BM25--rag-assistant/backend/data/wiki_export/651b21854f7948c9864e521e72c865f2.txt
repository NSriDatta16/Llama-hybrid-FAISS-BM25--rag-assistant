Coat of arms

The coat of arms of Johannes Bündgens is based on the coat of arms of the diocese of Aachen, a black cross on a golden shield. The inner blue shield displays a golden "love knot" in the middle, symbolizing the love between God and men. It is also an allusion to his family name, which relates to the word bonding. It also looks similar to Celtic ornamentic plaits, which connects the coat of arms to his titular diocese of Árd Carna in Ireland. A golden trefoil leaf above and below the knot also symbolizes the connection with Ireland, as well as his ancestry of farmers. The colors blue and golden were chosen as the colors of his hometown Eschweiler.

The motto of Bishop Bündgens is Mysterium magnum Ecclesia (This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church), taken from Epistle to the Ephesians (5:32).
