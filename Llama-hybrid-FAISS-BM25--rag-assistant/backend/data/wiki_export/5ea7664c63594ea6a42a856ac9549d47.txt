WRNS-FM (95.1 MHz) is a radio station located in Kinston, North Carolina in the United States. Its format is contemporary country.

The station has a non-directional signal of 100,000 watts, that reaches "from the capital to the coast". The station has served Kinston and eastern North Carolina since the 1960s, when it was WFTC-FM. At one time, it was the only country station in the area and had one of the highest market shares of any station. Known for its generosity, the station has held a radiothon for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital annually for the past 5 years.  The station is constantly ranked as the #1 station in its market by Arbitron.

The WRNS-FM transmitter antenna is located on WCTI-TV's tower north of Trenton, North Carolina. Studios are located in New Bern.

In September 2017, Dick Broadcasting announced the purchase of Alpha Media stations in three markets â€” 18 stations and two translators in total, at a purchase price of $19.5 million. The acquisition of WRNS-FM by Dick Broadcasting was consummated on December 20, 2017.
