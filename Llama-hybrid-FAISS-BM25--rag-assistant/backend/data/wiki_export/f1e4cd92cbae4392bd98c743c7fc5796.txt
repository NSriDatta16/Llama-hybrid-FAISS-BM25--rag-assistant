Young Lions is an Australian TV police drama shown on the Nine Network in 2002 and in Ireland on RTÃ‰ Two. The storyline of the series revolved around the professional and private lives of four rookie detectives, the Young Lions, of South West 101, an inner city Sydney police station.

The program rated poorly and was not renewed after its first season. Competition from other new drama series and several timeslot changes also contributed to the show's demise.
