Sehwan (; ; also commonly referred to as Sehwan Sharif or Noble Sehwan) is a historic city located in Jamshoro District of Sindh province in Pakistan situated on the west bank of the Indus River  north-west of Hyderabad. The city is renowned for being the home of one of Pakistan's most important Sufi shrines, the Shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar. The city also holds the status of taluka under the Jamshoro District. It was previously a part of the Dadu District; however, with the establishment of the Jamshoro District, Sehwan became linked with it.

Sehwan is among Pakistan's most significant spiritual centers, alongside other revered shrines like the Shrine of Abdullah Shah Ghazi in Karachi, the Data Durbar Complex in Lahore, Bari Imam in Noorpur Shehan near Islamabad, and the magnificent tombs of the Suhrawardi Sufis in Multan.

History 

Sehwan is one of the most ancient places in Sindh. Some historians suggest that this town dates back to the period of Prophet Shees, son of Adam, hence it was named Sheestan, Sewistan and eventually Sehwan. Syed Muhibullah, the author of "A Brief History of Sind," notes that Sehwan was the name of the great-grandson of Ham (son of Noah). However, there are various other views about the nomenclature of Sehwan as well. William Dalrymple proposes that the name is derived from Shivistan, after Lord Shiva. Notable historian Molai Sheedai writes in his book "Tarikh-e-Tamadan-e-Sind" that Sehwan was built by the Sewi Aryas and was hence called Sewistan. Another view is that its name was Sindomana, a name well-mentioned in Greek literature. Sindhu-mán is a Sanskrit word that means "the possessor (the capital, or Raja) of Sindh," with which Sindhu-vàn is synonymous. The latter may have softened in common speech to the modern Seh-wan. Sindomana was the capital of King Sambos, who was defeated by Alexander in 326 BC. A large tell called Kafir Qila (castle of the pagans) is located to the north of the city. 

Sehwan was conquered by Muhammad bin Qasim in 711 from the son of King Dahir, and three centuries later by Mahmud of Ghazni in 1026. In all subsequent dynastic struggles of Sindh, Sehwan continued to feature prominently. It was successively held by the Sumrahs, the Summas, the Arghuns, and the Tarkhans. During the Thatta Kingdom, it served as the capital. An abortive attempt was made by the Mughal emperor Humayun to capture it on his way to Umarkot in 1542, but it finally fell to his son Akbar in 1590s. After the Mughals, it was ruled by the Kalhoras and Talpurs.

Notable places 
The city is renowned for its Sufi patron saint Lal Shahbaz Qalandar, who lived there in the 13th century. The Shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors every year. Additionally, the Shrine of Murshid Nadir Ali Shah, a notable spiritual descendant of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar is also located in Sehwan, where a large number of people are served free meals around the clock. Another famous place is the inverted city. Moreover, Manchar Lake, the largest freshwater lake in Pakistan, is located a short distance from Sehwan Sharif.
