Albert Schatz (1839â€“1910) was a German music dealer. In 1873 Shatz assumed ownership of the Musikalienhandlung Ludwig Trutschel Nachfolger, a music store in Rostock, Germany. He owned a large collection of libretti due to his passion for operatic history and his plan to write a comprehensive history of opera. His collection came from all around Europe including many German, French, and Italian libretto ranging from the 17th to the 18th century. His plans for the book unfortunately came to halt due his poor health. He ended up selling his extensive collection to his friend and music division chief of the library of congress Oscar Sonneck. After Shatz's death, Sonneck also arranged the purchase of Shatz's research paper's and notes.
