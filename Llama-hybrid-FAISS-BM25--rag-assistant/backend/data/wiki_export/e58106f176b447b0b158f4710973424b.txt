Jindabyne Dam is a major ungated rockfill embankment dam across the Snowy River in the Snowy Mountains of New South Wales, Australia. The dam's main purpose is to redirect water from the Snowy River to the Murray, for the generation of hydro-power and irrigation. It is one of the sixteen major dams that comprise the Snowy Mountains Scheme, a vast hydroelectricity and irrigation complex constructed in south-east Australia between 1949 and 1974 and now run by Snowy Hydro. 

The impounded reservoir is called Lake Jindabyne.

Location and features
Completed in 1967, Jindabyne Dam is a major dam, located approximately  south south-east of the relocated town of Jindabyne. The dam was constructed by a consortium of Utah-Brown and Sudamericana based on engineering plans developed under contract by the Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Authority. Construction of the dam flooded the settlement of Old Jindabyne that accommodated approximately 300 people. Parts of Old Jindabyne can be seen when the levels of Lake Jindabyne are low. The settlement of East Jindabyne is located above what was Old Jindabyne.

The dam wall comprising  of rockfill is  high and  long. At 100% capacity the dam wall holds back  of water. The surface area of Lake Jindabyne is  and the catchment area is . The spillway is capable of discharging .

Work to modify the dam spillway commenced in 1994 and was ongoing as at July 2009.

The dam has a 1.1MW hydro power generator that can be used during environmental releases into the Snowy River.

Lake Jindabyne

Lake Jindabyne receives the flow from the Snowy River as well as its tributaries, the Thredbo River and Eucumbene River. Smaller inflows include Cobbin Creek, Rushes Creek and Wollondibby Creek. The flow of water into Lake Jindabyne is particularly strong during the spring months of October and November due to snow melt.

The Jindabyne pumping station pumps the water from the lake into the Jindabyne-Island Bend tunnel. The water then goes to Geehi Dam via the Snowy-Geehi tunnel and is then available to the Murray Hydroelectric Power Station before entering the Murray River.

The damming and redirection of the Snowy River reduced its flow below the dam to about was only 1% of the amount that flowed before the river was dammed. This caused environmental concerns about the state of the lower reaches of the Snowy River in Victoria and NSW. The result was Snowy Hydro releasing water as environmental flows. In 2000, the NSW and Victorian Governments reached a long-term agreement to increase the flow of water into the Snowy to 28%.

Recreational uses
Lake Jindabyne is a popular sailing and fishing destination. The body of water is one of the largest fresh water reservoirs in New South Wales, and has a resident population of Atlantic Salmon, Brook Trout and Rainbow Trout. Lake Jindabyne also has a reputation as one of the best places to catch trout in Australia.

In 1969 the Eucumbene Sailing Club moved to Lake Jindabyne and formed the Lake Jindabyne Yacht Club as conditions were not as rough as Lake Eucumbene. The club operates from November until April every year with racing in nineteen different classes of boat.

It is also a popular venue for waterskiing and sailing during spring, summer and autumn.
