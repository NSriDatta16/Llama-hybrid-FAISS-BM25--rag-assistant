Sven Strüver (born 9 August 1967) is a German professional golfer.

Early life and professional career
Strüver was born in Bremen. In the 1989 German Open, he shot a 62 in the second round to set a new record for the lowest round by an amateur in a European Tour event. The record was equalled by Shane Lowry in the 2009 Irish Open.

After reaching the final in the 1990 Spanish International Amateur Championship, losing to Darren Clarke, Strüver turned professional in and won the German PGA Championship that year. He joined the European Tour in 1992, and reached his peak during the mid to late 1990s, when he won three tournaments and consistently finished inside the top 50 on the Order of Merit. His best season was 1998, when he captured the Canon European Masters and finished 13th on the Order of Merit having missed just two cuts all season.

Since 2003, Strüver has failed to win enough money to retain his European Tour card automatically and visited the end of season tour qualifying school every year through 2007, regaining his card on three occasions.
