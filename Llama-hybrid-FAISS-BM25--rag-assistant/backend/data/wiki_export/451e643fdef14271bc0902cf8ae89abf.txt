Óscar Eduardo Córdoba Arce (born 3 February 1970) is a Colombian retired professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper. He played more than 70 games for the Colombia national team. He is also the only person to never concede a goal in a Copa América edition, having done so in 2001.

Club career
Córdoba started playing professionally with Atlético Nacional in 1988, but transferred to Deportivo Cali in 1989 and loaned to Deportes Quindío in 1990. In 1991, he moved to Millonarios, and in 1993 he played for Once Caldas, and América de Cali, with which he would win the Colombian Championship in 1997.

After the title, he moved to Argentine team Boca Juniors to what was probably his most successful time, winning the Argentine Championships Apertura 1998, Clausura 1999 and Apertura 2000, the Copa Libertadores 2000 and 2001, and the Intercontinental Cup of 2000. In 2000 and 2001 was part of the dream team of America.

Ready to make the jump to Europe, Córdoba moved to Italian Perugia Calcio, but after only half season he transferred to Turkish Beşiktaş Istanbul. In Turkey he often played against another Colombian goalkeeper of the Süper Lig; Faryd Mondragón of Galatasaray. After four seasons and after winning the 2002–03 Süper Lig and the 2005–06 Turkish Cup, he transferred to Antalyaspor, club in which he announced his retirement after the 2006–07 season. In spite of the announcement, he returned to Colombia and signed for Deportivo Cali to play the following season.

His contract with the Colombian side expired after Deportivo Cali were eliminated in the semi-finals of the Copa Mustang in the Apertura of 2008. In December 2008 he was nominated by the American channel Fox Sports as "Outstanding Career" Award given annually by such means the best athletes in the world. Oscar will be awarded with special recognition for Outstanding Career with Argentine striker Gabriel Batistuta.

After his experience at Deportivo Cali, Córdoba expressed his interest in either returning to Argentina, returning to Turkey, or retiring from football itself. He finally signed for Millonarios where he played until his retirement in December 2009. He won Fox Sports Radio's "Outstanding Career" Award with three other Colombians, including Formula 3 driver Gustavo Yacaman and bronze medal-winning Paralympic athlete Elkin Serna.

International career
Córdoba made his debut for the Colombia national team in a friendly against Costa Rica on 31 March 1993. He has gone on to make over 70 appearances for his country, making him the most capped goalkeeper in the history of Colombian international football.

In the 1994 FIFA World Cup qualification he started in every game and conceded only two goals making him the best goalkeeper in the playoffs. He played a key role in the 2001 Copa América, playing five of six games, and winning the tournament with no goals conceded. Along with Miguel Calero, the Colombian side kept their net virgin throughout the tournament, first time to ever happen in the Copa América. He also won the award for best goalkeeper in the tournament. He played in the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup where Colombia came fourth.

On 10 September 2003, Córdoba surpassed René Higuita's record of 68 caps, to become Colombia's all-time record goalkeeper. He was called up to the Colombia national team for his final time in October 2009 as the third goalkeeper in a FIFA World Cup qualifier for the CONMEBOL.
