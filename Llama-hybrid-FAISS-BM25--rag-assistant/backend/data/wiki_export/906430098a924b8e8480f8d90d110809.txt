The DeepSouthCon (DSC) is an annual science fiction convention, which is hosted in different cities in the Southern United States. Site selection is by vote of the membership of a given DSC, for the convention to be held 2 years in the future. DSC is often, but not always, held in conjunction with an existing annual convention so the time of year varies. Many regular attendees of DeepSouthCon are also members of the Southern Fandom Confederation, but there is no direct relationship between the two organizations.

DeepSouthCon 60, 2022, will be in Huntsville, AL. www.dsc60.com

Awards

DSC issues two principal awards: the Phoenix, which is awarded to a science fiction professional editor, author, or artist with connections to the South, and the Rebel, which is awarded to a like-placed fan.  The Phoenix and Rebel awards are considered lifetime achievement awards for a professional or fan who has done the most for southern fandom.

The 2013 DeepSouthCon, JordanCon in Atlanta, Georgia, awarded the Phoenix to Robert Jordan (posthumously), and the Rebel to Regina Kirby and Mike Lee Rogers. Jordan's award was accepted by his wife, Harriet McDougal. The 2014 DeepSouthCon, Contrails in Bristol, Virginia, awarded the Phoenix to Steve Jackson, and the Rebel to Judy Bemis. The 2015 DeepSouthCon, CONtraflow V in New Orleans, Louisiana, awarded the Phoenix to Diana Rowland and (posthumously) Robert Asprin with the Rebel awarded to Michael Scott and Frank Schiavo.

A Rubble award to the person who has done the most to southern fandom in the past year is also awarded at the DeepSouthCon, usually good-naturedly. The Rubble is not an officially-sponsored convention award.
