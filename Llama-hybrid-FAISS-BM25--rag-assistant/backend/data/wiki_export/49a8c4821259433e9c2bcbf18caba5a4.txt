2nd generation (2015–2017) 

The bikes got a completely new makeover, with new design elements such as a new Avenger insignia, paint jobs, alloy wheels etc. Two versions, Street and Cruise, were introduced, with the former designed as a cross between a cruiser and a city bike in terms of handlebar positioning and handling etc., while the latter being a more textbook cruiser. The Street came with two engine options: 150 cc and 220 cc, while the Cruise comes only with a 220 cc engine.

Avenger Street 150
It comes with a 150cc engine. It was launched on 2015 October along with Avenger Street 220 and Avenger 220 Cruise. It works on carburettor system. It has an impressive mileage of 45 km/L and draws a top speed of 117 km/h. Avenger 150 street requires 1150 mL of Engine oil to refill at servicing.

Avenger Cruise 220
This bike is similar to the outgoing Avenger 220 model with a few cosmetic changes. There is a new Avenger insignia and more chrome addition in the form of oil cooler and horn. An optional windshield is also available. The Avenger Cruise 220 is closest to the classical cruiser look among the 3 variants released. The Avenger Cruise has ergonomic changes in its handlebar when compared to its predecessors thereby giving it more cruise like riding feel for the rider. The Avenger Cruise has a blue back lit digital meter. Currently its available in Ebony Black and Desert Gold colors.

3rd generation (January 2018 – present) 

The third generation of the widely successful Avenger required an update in order to deal with competition such as the Suzuki Intruder, which was launched in Q3, 2017. With this update, the 150 cc version was retired in favour of a 180 cc version.

The third generation brought with it a slew of design changes such as a new headlamp with LED DRLs. A digital instrument cluster, backlit with blue on the Cruise and Orange on the Street, is also a recent addition. There is also a new tall shroud that shields the instrument cluster from direct sunlight. The new cluster gets a speedometer, two trip meters, fuel gauge and a service reminder. The back grab rail for the Street version has been revamped too.

The Avenger insignia has also been changed and made bigger. There are new graphics and colours for all three variants, too:

Avenger Cruise 220: Auburn Black, Moon White

Avenger Street 220: Matt Black, Matt White

Avenger Street 180: Red, Black

Apart from these, there are no mechanical changes to any of the bikes.
