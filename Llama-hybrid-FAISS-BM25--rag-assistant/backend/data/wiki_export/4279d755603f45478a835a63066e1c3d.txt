Tourism

Nkhata Bay is described by Lonely Planet as "Caribbeanesque" and a "lush tropical indent". There are several guesthouses and lodges for tourists in Nkhata Bay. In February 2005, the Malawian government announced plans to build ecolodges as a way of increasing ecotourism in the Nkhata Bay area. The diving school in Nkhata Bay offers the "cheapest diving course in the world" according to The Daily Telegraph. Nkhata Bay tourism has a long history. It has been part of the overland backpackers route between east Africa and cape town but the number of backpackers have dropped considerably in recent years. Political issues in Zimbabwe has revised the overland backpacking route so that many people now go through Zambia or the Mozambique coast. The Heart Hotel was a local owned establishment in the local village where very low budget backpackers could get a room and breakfast for well under one US dollar. Nkhata Bay became a place where people could rest on a long trip and spend very little money. With the opening of Njajay Lodge the scene changed a little. The town along with backpackers culture shifted to catering to a traveller with more money to spend. While the village now has many places to stay the problem has become attracting people who now often travel through other countries or easier accessed beaches in Malawi. Another shift that has reduced the amount of foreign visitors to Nkhata Bay is the increasing number of people travelling Africa by overland truck rather than independent backpackers travel. Overland trucks do not come to Nkhata Bay but instead, choose the beaches on Chinteche to the south. As a result, many of the local artists have moved their craft stalls to the Nkhata Bay/Chinteche road junction. This along with huge increases in international parcel rates from Malawi have made it increasingly difficult for the talented local artist to make a living. Many artists now set up stalls directly outside of overland truck camps around Malawi understanding that backpackers can no longer afford to send famous Malawi chief chairs and masks home.

Notable events

Marriage
In March 2000, 73-year-old man from Nkhata and a 22-year-old woman married, in what BBC News reported as "Malawi's surprise wedding of the year"

Crocodile attack
In December 2002, a businessman, Mac Bosco Chawinga, was dragged in to Lake Malawi at Nkhata Bay by a crocodile; Chawinga managed to escape by biting the crocodile on the nose. The crocodile then released him, and Chawinga managed to return to the shore, although he had received severe injuries to his legs and arms. The Times reported that, according to "wildlife experts", Chawinga is the first person to survive after "using such an audacious tactic".

Capsized boat
On 9 May 2004, the then-Tourism, Parks and Wildlife Minister Wallace Chiume survived when a boat capsized in Nkhata Bay. At least six other people drowned in the accident. One of the dead passengers was a child. The boat was being used for campaigning in the Malawian election. Strong winds were blamed for the accident which happened  from the shore of Lake Malawi. 40 people were on the boat at the time.

Organizations
In 2006, the Nkhata Bay AIDS Support Organization was created in Malawi and later registered in the state of Wisconsin as a non-profit corporation. The American-Malawian partnership has led to great success in the fight against HIV/AIDS in the Nkhata Bay District. Over six outreach clinics were established in the past two years, leading to a 23% drop in positive HIV testing results. The charity operates on a small budget coming from local Wisconsin donors.
