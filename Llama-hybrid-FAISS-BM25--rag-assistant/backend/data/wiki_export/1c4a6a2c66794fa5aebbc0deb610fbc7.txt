Clipmapping is a method of clipping a mipmap to a subset of data pertinent to the geometry being displayed. This is useful for loading as little data as possible when memory is limited, such as on a graphics processing unit. The technique is used for LODing in NVIDIAâ€™s implementation of voxel cone tracing. The high-resolution levels of the mipmapped scene representation are clipped to a region near the camera while lower resolution levels are clipped further away.
