Utair () () is a Russian airline with its head office at Khanty-Mansiysk Airport while its hubs are at Surgut International Airport and Vnukovo International Airport. It operates scheduled domestic and some international passenger services, scheduled helicopter services, and extensive charter flights with fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters in support of the oil and gas industry across western Siberia.

History 

In February 1967, the Aeroflot Tyumen Directorate was set up to meet the transport requirements of the fast-growing oil and gas industry undergoing development in western Siberia. In the wake of the break-up of the Aeroflot organization, Tyumenaviatrans Aviation (TAT) was formed in 1991 to replace the Aeroflot Tyumen Directorate. TAT adopted the name of UTair in 2002.
The airline is owned by Khanty Mansiysk District administration (23%), Surgut City administration (19%), Russian shareholders and companies (33%), the Russian Federation (2%), and private foreign investors (20%).

In October 2010, Utair announced plans to replace its Tupolev Tu-134 fleet with the Sukhoi Superjet 100. In December, UTair officially placed an order for 24 of the jets to enter service in 2013. Also in 2010, the airline named a Tu-154 aircraft after Boris Evdokimovich Sherbina, a Tyumenfigure.

In November 2014, Utair faced financial difficulties and was unable to make a bond payment. In April 2015, Utair announced a fleet reduction of over 50 aircraft due to financial difficulty. It also cancelled its order for 24 Sukhoi Superjet 100 aircraft. A few weeks later, its regional airline subsidiary UTair Express ceased operations.

In December 2015, it was announced that Utair sold its leisure subsidiary Azur Air to Turkish tourism company Anex Tourism Group, which had bought UTair-Ukraine a few weeks earlier. On 31 October 2017, Utair announced its rebranding and changing its name from "UTair Aviation" to "Utair".

On 8 April 2022 the US Department of Commerce restricted flights on aircraft manufactured in the US for Aeroflot, Aviastar, Azur Air, Belavia, Rossiya and Utair. It seems the US wants to reclaim ownership of the intellectual property. On 16 June the US broadened its restrictions on the six airlines after violations of the sanctions regime were detected. The effect of the restrictions is to ground the US-manufactured part of its fleet.
