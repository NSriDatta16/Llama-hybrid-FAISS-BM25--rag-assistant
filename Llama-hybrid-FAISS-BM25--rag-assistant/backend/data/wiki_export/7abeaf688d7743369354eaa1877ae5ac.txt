Personal life
Wickham had surgery to remove a polyp from folds of his vocal cords on April 28, 2014, after which he was prescribed a month of silence to allow the surgical site to heal. He was uncertain that he would be able to sing again, leading to identity issues and self-doubt. His spiritual revelation during these times was the basis for his 2016 album Children of God.

He now lives in San Diego, California with his wife, Mallory, 4 kids, and two dogs.
