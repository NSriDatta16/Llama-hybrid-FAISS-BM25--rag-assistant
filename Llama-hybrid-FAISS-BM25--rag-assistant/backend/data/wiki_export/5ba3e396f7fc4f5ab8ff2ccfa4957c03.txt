The Tintic Standard Reduction Mill—also known as the Tintic Mill or Harold Mill—built in 1920, and only operating from 1921 to 1925, is an abandoned refinery or concentrator located on the west slope of Warm Springs Mountain on the southern edge of Genola, Utah, United States. In 2002, the Utah Department of Environmental Quality tested the soil and found it contained high levels of arsenic and lead, which can lead to serious health problems and even death.

Description

The mill was designed and built by  W. C. Madge. It is significant as the only American mill using the Augustin process during the early 1920s. Metals processed at the mill included copper, gold, silver, and lead, all of which were received from another mill near Eureka. The metal content of ore was increased through the process to make transportation less expensive. The reducing process used was an acid-brine chloridizing and leaching process which became outdated, leading to the abandonment of the site in 1925. At the mill's highest productivity it processed 200 tons of ore daily from the Tintic Mining District.

What remains of the mill are foundations for water tanks, crushers, roasters, iron boxes, leaching tanks, and drain boxes. The site dominates the surrounding landscape with its size and unique colors and shapes. It has been speculated that the mill may be the contributor of heavy metal pollution in the Warm Springs which lie below it.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places September 13, 1978.
