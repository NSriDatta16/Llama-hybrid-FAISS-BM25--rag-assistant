"Jungle Boogie" is a funk song recorded by Kool & the Gang for their 1973 album Wild and Peaceful. It reached number four as a single, and became very popular in nightclubs. Billboard ranked it as the number 12 song for 1974, despite there being as many as 36 No. 1 singles that year. 

In 1994 the song experienced a revival in popularity, after being used on the soundtrack of the film Pulp Fiction. It was also used in promo packages by wrestling promotion Extreme Championship Wrestling in the mid 1990's.

Background
The song's spoken main vocal was performed by the band's roadie Don Boyce. An instrumental version of the tune with an overdubbed flute part and additional percussion instruments, titled "Jungle Jazz", appeared on the album Spirit of the Boogie. There is a Tarzan yell at the song's end and grunting, panting and scatting heard throughout.
