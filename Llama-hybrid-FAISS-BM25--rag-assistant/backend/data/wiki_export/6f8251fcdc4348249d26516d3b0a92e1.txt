History
The area around Ballan was part of the tribal area of the Wautharong people, part of the Kulin nation. The area was rich in fauna, including kangaroo, kangaroo rats, bandicoots, dingos, and two species of native cat. Many species had vanished by the end of the 19th century, with European settlement.

The first European settlers crossed Bass Strait landing near Geelong and worked their way up the Moorabool River with their sheep flocks. Robert von Steiglitz first settled the area in 1838; he named the area after Ballan in Ireland. Other early settler names included Cowie, Stead, Wallace and Egerton.

There were clashes between indigenous Australians and white settlers during settlement. Robert von Steiglitz stated in his journal 
"… it may be questioned by some feather-bed philanthropist whether we had the right to take the country from the blacks but I believe the general rule is that if people cultivate or graze the land they have a claim to it. These creatures did neither …".

Gold was found in the area in 1851, which brought an influx of prospectors during the Victorian Gold Rush. The Ballan Hotel dates from the gold rush period in 1851. The town became an important staging point for coaches travelling to the Ballarat goldfields. The post office in the township opened around September 1853, although two earlier offices in the area were named Ballan.

Community Groups

 Ballan & District CWA - The Ballan CWA was established in September 1937; and the first meeting was held at Mrs. Rae's Coffee Palace. A committee was established and was run by Mrs J Rhodes (President), Mrs Turley (Secretary) & Mrs A.Flack (Treasurer) and consisted of 10 other members. For 70 years, the office bearers have passed on the torch to their fellow sisters, keeping alive the traditions, recipes & spirit of the CWA. The Ballan branch has had 34 presidents, 12 secretaries & 9 treasurers, with some members serving multiple terms. During these 70 years, the extraordinary country women of the CWA Ballan branch had helped those in need by raising funds for medical, war and other charity groups. This was achieved by donations, providing entertainment, volunteering at the Ballarat Hospital, penny drives, hosting events such as debutante balls, film evenings, sports competitions, and were widely known and were in high demand for their catering. In 2007, the last group said their farewells. After a 9 year hiatus, (October 2016) the Ballan & District CWA branch was established with a fresh set of members, goals and attitudes. "Our branch is passionate about supporting our local & surrounding communities within the Moorabool Shire & of course bakes the best scones. One of the marvellous things about being part of a community, is that it enables us to welcome, connect & support people in ways we couldn't as individuals."
