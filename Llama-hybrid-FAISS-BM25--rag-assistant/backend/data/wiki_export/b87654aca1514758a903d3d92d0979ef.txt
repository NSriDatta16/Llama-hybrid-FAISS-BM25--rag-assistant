Sings America is the tenth studio album by American actor and singer David Hasselhoff. It was released on February 2, 2004, by Edel Records. It became his first studio project in seven years since Hooked on a Feeling (1997).

The album contains covers of songs originally made famous by artists such as Elvis Presley, The Beach Boys, Glen Campbell, Burt Bacharach and Madonna.
