History
The Gulshan Garden is one of the oldest gardens in Shiraz.

During the Safavid dynasty, it was used as a palace by the Safavid Kings.

The current main building was constructed by Mirza Ali Mohammad Khan Qavam II in 1863. He bought a nearby qanat to water his garden. After his death, the garden was eventually inherited by his niece, Afife; thus being called "Afif-Abad".

In 1962, it was restored by the army. It now functions as a weapons museum.
