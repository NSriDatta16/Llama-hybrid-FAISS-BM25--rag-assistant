History
At the Norman Conquest, Staining was part of the hundred of Amounderness, in the possession of Earl Tostig, the brother of King Harold II. Tostig died at the Battle of Stamford Bridge and his lands were subsequently taken over by the Normans. Between 1069 and 1086 William the Conqueror gave Amounderness to Anglo-Norman baron Roger the Poitevin. Staining was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Staininghe. The village was estimated in that survey to contain six carucates of land.
