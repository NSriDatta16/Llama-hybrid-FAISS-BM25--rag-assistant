History
In 1794, Juan de Videla visited Piedra Blanca and saw that the place was suitable for the foundation of a town, as he afterward informed the Marquess of Sobremonte.  On October 1, 1796, Sobremonte ordered the formalization of its foundation, under the name of Villa de Melo ("Town of Melo"), given in honor of Pedro Melo of Portugal.

On the morning of January 1, 1797, the townsfolk witnessed the formal foundation of their town.  The ceremony took place in front of the chapel, beside an image of the Virgin of the Rosary.  (At the same time, Saint Augustine was chosen to be the patron saint of the town.)  The name of the town was altered over time and became Villa de Merlo.

One may see, in Marqués de Sobremonte square, plaques which commemorate the ceremonial founding of the town, and he may visit the old communal well and the chapel of Nuestra Señora del Rosario nearby.

Population
The census of 2001 showed a total population of 11,159, an increase of 84% over the 6,079 of the previous census, in 1991.  This figure includes the populations of Piedrablanca, Barranca Colorada, El Rincón, and El Rincón del Este.  The population is 95% of European descent, with the remainder Native and Spanish mix.  There is a small but thriving community of Americans, Germans and British expats who have made their homes and fortunes in Merlo.
