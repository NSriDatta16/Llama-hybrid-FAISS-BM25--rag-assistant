Víctor Neumann-Lara (1933–2004) was a Mexican mathematician and a pioneer in the field of graph theory in Mexico. His work also covers general topology, game theory and combinatorics.

Biography
Born in the city of Huejutla de Reyes, Hidalgo, Mexico, he soon moved to Mexico City, where he received his bachelor's degree in mathematics from the School of Sciences, UNAM.

His life was greatly devoted to teaching, giving over 100 courses in Mexico and around the world, and introducing new teaching methods. He carried color chalks with him all the time, and was prompt to give graphic explanations.

Work
Full Professor at Institute of Mathematics, UNAM, he directed over 15 theses and taught both in the Institute and in the Faculty of Sciences. Below is a selection of his multiple publications, which earned him over 120 citations from renowned mathematicians in the area of graph theory.

In 1982 he introduced the notion of dichromatic number of a digraph, which will eventually be used in kernel theory and tournament theory.
