Say No More was an American four-piece rock band from Salinas, California, United States, formed in December 2001. The band  independently released two records — 2004's Stranger in Dreams and 2006's The Transition. In August 2005, the quartet relocated to Los Angeles, California to attend California State University, Northridge. Shortly thereafter, they placed first in 2006's "Best Music on Campus" award — a battle of the bands competition held by Drive-Thru Records in cooperation with mtvU — which led to a recording contract with the record label. Preceded by the songs "This Is Our Way" and "Long Drive Home", What You Thought You Knew was released in October 2007. The music video for their single "Long Drive Home" was released on mtvU and mtvU.com on September 5, 2008.
