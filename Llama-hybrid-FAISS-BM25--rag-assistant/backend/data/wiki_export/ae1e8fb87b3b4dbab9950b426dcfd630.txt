House Party 4: Down to the Last Minute is a 2001 American direct-to-video comedy film. It is the standalone fourth installment in the House Party film series as it has no connection to any of the preceding films or the subsequent film House Party: Tonight's the Night. It stars IMx, and is the only film in the series to not star Kid 'n Play. This is IMx's second House Party film; they also appeared in House Party 3 when they were known as Immature and portrayed entirely different characters than they do in this film.

Plot 

Jon-Jon sees a ripe opportunity for a major party when he snags the job house-sitting for his rich Uncle Charles. The mansion comes with a platinum colored Mercedes-Benz 430 and, although Uncle Charles has told him not to drive the car or have people over, Jon-Jon wastes no time in doing both; Jon-Jon is not only having an "entertainment party", but he's auditioning his hip-hop band (IMx) for a record executive. When Jon-Jon finds out his uncle is coming home earlier than announced, he has to race against time to try to put everything back the way he found it.

Sequel 
At the end of the film, Jon Jon and Monique hint at a sequel centering on Monique as the protagonist. That film, however, was never produced. The next film in the series, House Party: Tonight's the Night starring Tequan Richmond and Zac Goodspeed, was released direct to DVD on July 23, 2013; that film is a direct continuation of House Party 3, and disregards the events of House Party 4. Kid 'n Play, the franchise's original leads, make an appearance at the end of the film, reprising their roles from the first three films. It is revealed that the two have gone on to be successful music producers just as they aspired to in the second and third films.
