A fuel cell vehicle is a vehicle that uses a fuel cell to power an electric drive system. There are also hybrid vehicles meaning that they are fitted with a fuel cell and a battery or a fuel cell and an ultracapacitor. For HICEV see List of hydrogen internal combustion engine vehicles.  For a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of fuel cell vehicles, see fuel cell vehicle.
