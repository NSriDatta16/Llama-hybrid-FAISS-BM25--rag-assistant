Ali Farka Touré is an album by the Malian musician Ali Farka Touré. It was recorded in London.

Critical reception

The New York Times wrote that Touré picks "out patterns so light and lilting that their intricate cross-rhythms sound easy; his voice, an earthy tenor, shares the guitar's modal melody lines or slides in between, and he underlines the syncopations with the slapping sound of overdubbed bongos." The Los Angeles Times noted that he "concentrates on measured, mid-tempo tunes that showcase his throaty vocals and rich guitar tone with minimal percussion accompaniment."
