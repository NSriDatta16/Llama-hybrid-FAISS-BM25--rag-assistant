History

IL 102 and IL 113 were both established in 1924, and originally both routes were numbered as IL 113. In 1935, IL 113 north of the river became IL 113N, and the south branch became IL 113S. From 1936 to 1940, US 52 was formed to run along IL 113S, renumbering IL 113N to IL 113. In 1940, US 52 was rerouted to go through downtown Joliet, reverting to the IL 113N and IL 113S layout. In 1961, Illinois 113N was renumbered as IL 102, and IL 113S became IL 113 again.
