"My Love Is Your Love" is a song by American singer Whitney Houston. It was written and produced by Wyclef Jean and Jerry Duplessis for Houston’s fourth studio album of the same name (1998). Released on June 21, 1999, as the album's fourth single, it received positive reviews and was successful worldwide, hitting the top 10 in 23 international markets. The song peaked at number four on the US Billboard Hot 100, number two in the United Kingdom, and number one in New Zealand. It was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

Along with the original mid-tempo reggae-influenced version that was produced by Wyclef Jean, a dance remixed version by Jonathan Peters was also released. A live version was included in the 2014 CD/DVD release, Whitney Houston Live: Her Greatest Performances. Duke Dumont interpolated the song in his song "I Got U".

Critical reception
Daily Record wrote, "A fantastic return to form and another great single from her latest album of the same name. This once again uses a hip-hop beat to perfectly capture Whitney's soaring vocals." They also stated that "this is the best track in years from the soul diva." Entertainment Weekly editor Mark Bautz praised the song, "Wyclef Jean's gorgeous reggae-tinged title song and three funky cuts by Rodney Jerkins showcase the 35-year-old Whitney Houston in all her creative, soulful maturity." Rolling Stone's Rob Sheffield praised the song as a one with some "creative juice"; "on the excellent title track, Wyclef gives Houston the sexiest Bob Marley rip-off he's ever written." USA Today editor Rachel D. called this track "a spiritual, reggae-tinged jam from Wyclef Jean."
