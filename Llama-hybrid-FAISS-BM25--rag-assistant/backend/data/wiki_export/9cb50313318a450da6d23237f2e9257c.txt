In philosophy of language, Metadiscourse is the discussion about a discussion, as opposed to a simple discussion about a given topic. Metadiscourse contained within a written work can be any phrase that is included within a clause or sentence that goes beyond the subject itself, often to examine the purpose of the sentence or a response from the author, usually as an introductory adverbial clause.  Metadiscourse often includes phrases such as "frankly," "after all," "on the other hand," "to our surprise," and so on.

Below are some examples of metadiscourse in writing, denoting:
 the writer's intentions: "to sum up," "candidly," "I believe"
 the writer's confidence: "may," "perhaps," "certainly," "must"
 directions to the reader: "note that," "finally," "therefore," "however"
 the structure of the text: "first," "second," "finally," "therefore," "however"
