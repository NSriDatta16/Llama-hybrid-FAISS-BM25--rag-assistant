History
KUCD started broadcasting in 1991 as a smooth jazz station as "CD 101.9". On August 29, 1997, at 3 p.m., it switched to modern AC as "Star 101.9." It further evolved towards modern rock in 2001. This lasted until 2009, when it shifted back to modern AC; with this format change, KUCD changed its positioner from "Hawaii's New Music Alternative" to "90's, 2K, and Today". In early 2011, KUCD reverted to the modern rock format, albeit with a slight modern AC lean, using their previous "Hawaii's New Music Alternative" slogan once again. A few months after this, KUCD dropped the modern AC lean, and is once again a modern rock station.

In 2013, the station changed its positioner to "Hawaii's Alternative". With the May 2020 format flip of KPOI from alternative to soft AC, KUCD is now the only radio station in Honolulu playing alternative rock music. KUCD's HD2 sub-channel airs Asian Pop formatted PoP! 99.1 at 101.9-2 and on the iHeartRadio app.

On May 16, 2023 iHeartMedia announced that KUCD and K256AS/KUCD-HD2 would swap formats at 10AM the following Thursday, the 18, with 101.9 set to inherit the Asian pop music format of K256AS as "Pop! 101.9" at that time.
