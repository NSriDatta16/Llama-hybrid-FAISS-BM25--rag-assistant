Alice Hanson Cook (November 28, 1903 â€“ February 7, 1998) was an activist and professor of labor history at Cornell University in the United States. At Cornell, the Alice Cook House residential college was named in her honor.

Her varied life experiences included social worker, YWCA secretary, labor educator, post World War II advisor in Germany on reconstituting German labor unions, professor, university ombudsman, world acclaimed researcher, and to the very end, an activist. Cook was appointed Cornell University's first ombudsman and worked to establish the credibility and acceptance of that office.
