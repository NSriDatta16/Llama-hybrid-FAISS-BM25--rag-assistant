Track listing

Music video
In the music video, directed by David Mallet, Angus Young explodes from a life-sized television set. He throws his hat, and it lands on a switch, causing it to flip. A missile is launched, and on the screen is film footage of the Strategic Air Command in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. The missile reveals to be a cruise missile, and travels across the world, whereupon it finally crashes into the Opera House in Sydney, during an AC/DC concert. Angus explodes out of the giant missile's warhead and does a guitar solo and at the end, he heads back into the missile's nose cone and leaves.
