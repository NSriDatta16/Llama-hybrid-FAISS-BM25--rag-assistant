Lebak Bulus Stadium was a football stadium in Jakarta, Indonesia. The stadium had 12,500 seats and can be extended to 15,000 until 25,000 people. It was used mostly for football matches. The stadium held AFC U-17 Championship 2008 Qualification Group F Matches and Football Men's Tournament at the 2011 SEA Games Group B Matches.

The stadium first started construction on early 2020, with the exact location in Tanjung Priok, North Jakarta.
