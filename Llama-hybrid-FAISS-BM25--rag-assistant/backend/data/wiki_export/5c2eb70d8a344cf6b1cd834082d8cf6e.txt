Clifton is an upscale and historic seaside locality in Karachi, Pakistan. It is one of the most affluent parts of the city, home to some of Karachi's most expensive real estates. It is home to several foreign consulates, while its commercial centres are amongst the most high-end in Pakistan, with a strong presence of international brands.

History

The area around Clifton was a largely barren seashore until British rule, and was previously known to locals as "Hawa Bandar," or "Wind Port." Prior to the establishment of the area as a suburb of Karachi, Clifton's shoreline had been home to a shrine of 8th century Abdullah Shah Ghazi - widely regarded as the city's patron saint. The shrine is immediately adjacent to the historic Sri Ratneswar Mahadev Hindu Temple.

Clifton was initially developed in the late 19th century under British colonial rule, and initially served as the location for homes belonging to the city's British elite as an escape from the city. In the early 20th century, Parsis from nearby Iran began moving to the area, and were soon followed by Muslims and Hindus. The Jehangir Kothari Parade, bestowed to the city by Parsi businessman Seth Jehangir Hormusji Kothari, was built in Clifton in 1919â€“20. The Mohatta Palace was built in Clifton in 1927 by a wealthy Hindu businessman, and now serves as a museum. Clifton Bridge was built in the 1930s to connect the suburb to central Karachi. By the 1950s, camel owners began offering rides to local tourists on the beach. The area remained a residential area characterized by bungalows until the 1970s, when the area began to develop as one of Karachi's prime commercial and retail centres.

In 1973, Clifton's famous Three Sword monument was erected as part of a beautification programme launched by Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, and was built in the shape of his political parties election symbol at the time. Despite a breakdown of law and order in Karachi in the 1980s and 1990s, Clifton was one of the localities in Karachi where real estate activity remained strong.

The government of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto planned a casino in the area near the Clifton Beach in a bid to attract foreign tourists to Pakistan in the 70s. However, the idea was abandoned soon because of political issues and the structure lay empty for many decades until it was taken over by a local amusement parks company, who opened a themed entertainment center named "Sindbad" on it. This was also closed down in the early 2000s and after another bout of vacancy, the place was finally torn down and the Dolmen Mall was erected in its place. This mall is now one of Pakistan's premier shopping malls, housing local and many foreign brands like Debenham's.

The areas also houses the former residence of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and the current residence of Bilawal Bhutto Zardari & Asif Ali Zardari. Bilawal House, which is now the current residence of Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has been surrounded with controversy since the erection of a protective wall around the house, with many local politicians asking authorities to pull it down.

In 2018, a group of Islamic extremists attacked the Chinese embassy here. The extremists were killed but unfortunately two police officers were also killed.
