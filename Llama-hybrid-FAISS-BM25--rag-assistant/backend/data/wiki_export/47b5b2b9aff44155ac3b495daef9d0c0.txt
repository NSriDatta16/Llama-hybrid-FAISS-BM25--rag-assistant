Hedwiga Reicher (Born Hedwig Reicher; 12 June 1884 – 2 September 1971) was a German actress. Her performances on Broadway were credited with the original spelling of her first name.

Reicher was christened Hedwig, but she altered the spelling after she came to the United States because some people called her "Mr. Hedwig". She was half-sister of actor Frank Reicher, sister of actor and screenwriter Ernst Reicher, and daughter of actor Emanuel Reicher. Another brother, Hans Reicher, was a sculptor, and her sister, Elly, was an actress.

Reicher's film debut came in The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, produced by Ferdinand Earle.

In addition to acting, Reicher produced two plays with her father and in 1921 had a solo production of Monna Vanna at Los Angeles's Little Theater. She also acted in all three.

On February 2, 1934, Reicher married concert pianist and music teacher Maurice Zam in Hollywood, California.

Reicher was hired to portray the mythological figure Columbia for the Woman Suffrage Procession, a suffrage parade on March 3, 1913, in Washington, DC. According to news reports at the time, the group, which included 5000 to 8000 suffragists, marched from the US Capitol to the Treasury Building, and was watched by a crowd of 500,000 (mostly men).  Their intent was to upstage Woodrow Wilson's inauguration, due to take place the following day.
