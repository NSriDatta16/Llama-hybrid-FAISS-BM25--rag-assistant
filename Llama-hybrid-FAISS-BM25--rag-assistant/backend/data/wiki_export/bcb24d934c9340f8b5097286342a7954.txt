History
Dahanu is a medieval town with a long history. It was settled probably as early as 500 AD. Some records show possible settlement as early as 150 BC. The reasons for nomadic lifestyle of locals are unknown. All these developments were before 100 AD and are in reference to the area around Dahanu, rather than the Dahanu village itself.
 
Under the administration of the Sultanate of Gujarat, the coastal settlement grew in importance and soon attracted many other communities such as the local Konkanis as well as the surrounding tribal and Gujarati people. Later the Zoroastrians arrived too. It was frequented by Arab merchants during this time.

By the 1510s, the Portuguese established their influence in the Konkan region. The village was under de jure control of Portuguese from circa 1515 to 1661. The Inquisition as well as the Portuguese-Vijayanagara alliance fueled this change of power. In 1570, Portuguese built a chapel as the region had several converts to Christianity. They also built a fortress to defend the surrounding area. The Chapel still stands today and goes by the name of Nossa Senhora Das Angustias. During the Portuguese era the village went by the name of Dolours.

In the 1700s, Dahanu was invaded and captured by the Marathas and remained under their control until the fall of Maratha Empire.

According to the Treaty of Mandsaur (1818), the Holkar state (which included the village of Dahanu) became subsidiary to the British. An unnamed officer was assassinated in the town by villagers over some dispute in the 1870s. Its details are unknown. The town became a part of  Independent India after its Struggle for Independence.

After the Sanyukta Maharashtra  Movement the Dahanu Taluka along with Talasari Taluka and Mumbai city became a part of Maharashtra state on 1 May 1960.
