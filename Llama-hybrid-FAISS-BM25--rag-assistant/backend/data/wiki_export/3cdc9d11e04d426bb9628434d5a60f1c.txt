Provincially protected areas 
There are several different departments and agencies that deal with land use in Alberta, however Alberta's provincial parks are managed by Alberta Parks, which since 2022 is part of the Ministry of Forestry, Parks and Tourism whose mandate is to protect the province's natural landscapes in Alberta, as well as the Ministry of Environment and Protected Areas.  Seven categories of protection exist, provincial parks being one. These categories are:
 
 Ecological reserves
 Wilderness areas
 Wildland provincial parks
 Provincial parks 
 Natural areas 
 Heritage rangelands  
 Provincial recreation areas

, the province of Alberta managed 76 provincial parks, 32 wildland provincial parks, 208 provincial recreation areas, 15 ecological reserves, 3 wilderness areas, 139 natural areas and 2 heritage rangeland.
