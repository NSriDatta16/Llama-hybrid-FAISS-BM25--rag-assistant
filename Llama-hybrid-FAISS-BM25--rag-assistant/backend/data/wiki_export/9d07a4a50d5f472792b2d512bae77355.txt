Svenska Akademien is a Swedish reggae band formed in 1999 by Carl-Martin Vikingsson, Simon Vikokel and Kristoffer Hellman. Since the band dissolved in 2009, Carl-Martin Vikingsson has released two solo albums as "Sture Alléns Dansorkester". Svenska Akademien vocalist and toaster Ivan Olausson-Klatil aka "General Knas" has released three solo albums, the first one in June 2006 called "Äntligen har rika människor fått det bättre" ("Finally rich people's conditions have improved") and the latest one in 2012, called "Kärlek & Revolt" ("Love & Rebellion").

Although some people consider their music to be politically green and leftish, they have stated on their website that "Svenska Akademien doesn't have its own ideology, or some kind of manifest approved by its members."

On 1 February 2013, it was announced that Svenska Akademien would make a comeback, with an upcoming album and new tour dates.
