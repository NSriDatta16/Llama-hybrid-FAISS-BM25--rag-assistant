The Llapi River is a river in the north-eastern part of Kosovo. The  long right tributary to the Sitnica river, it is the main river in the Llap (region) depression.

Etymology
The etymology of the river's name is derived from a pre-Slavic form Alb that underwent linguistic metathesis within Slavic giving the final form as Lab. 

The name of the river was first used in Antiquity and the Middle Ages, but has been preserved in the New Age.
