The Cooperage Football Ground is an association football stadium located in Nariman Point, Mumbai, India. It is predominantly home to multiple Mumbai Football League clubs.

The Western India Football Association has operated from the Cooperage Ground since 1969, and the Mumbai District Football Association holds a small office. It was a venue for one of India's premier national leagues, the I-League. Mahindra United used the stadium as home ground in both NFL and I-League.

History

Cooperage Ground was the primary venue of the Rovers Cup, the third oldest football tournament in India after Durand and Trades Cup. The stadium was occupied by the British Indian Army during the World War I. In April 2011, plans were announced for the Cooperage Football Ground to be renovated when FIFA announced that they would give the Western India Football Association US$2 million in order to renovate that stadium. On 12 June 2011, it was announced in the Bombay High Court that the West India Football Association would be given the right to renovate the Cooperage Ground.
