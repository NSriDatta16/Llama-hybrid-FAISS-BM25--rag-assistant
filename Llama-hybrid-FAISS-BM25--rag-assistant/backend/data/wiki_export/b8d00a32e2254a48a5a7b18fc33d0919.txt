Religion
In the 1870s, Presbyterians living in the Magheramason area began a campaign to have their own congregation. In August 1877, work began on a meeting house at Magheramason on a site granted by the Duke of Abercorn. The opening service in the new church took place on 17 November 1878, and the following year the Reverend Thomas Boyd was ordained its first minister.
