"2HB" is a song written by Bryan Ferry and first recorded by Roxy Music for their 1972 debut album, Roxy Music. Ferry also recorded a version for his 1976 solo album, Let's Stick Together.

The title is a dedication to the film star Humphrey Bogart ("2HB" = "To Humphrey Bogart"). In particular, the song references the Bogart classic Casablanca.

The instrumentation on the Roxy Music recording is dominated by Ferry's Hohner Pianet N electric piano and features an Andy Mackay sax solo—based on the melody of "As Time Goes By", a song featured prominently in Casablanca—that is treated with tape echo effects by Brian Eno.
