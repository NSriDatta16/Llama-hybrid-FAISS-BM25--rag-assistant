History

Commissioning and the 1980s
MWSS-273 was commissioned on June 13, 1986, at Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort, South Carolina. The squadron was formed from elements of Marine Air Base Squadron 31, and Detachment Bravo, Marine Wing Support Group 27.

In 1989, MWSS-273 provided extensive disaster relief support to the city of Charleston, South Carolina, during the aftermath of Hurricane Hugo.

The Gulf War & the 1990s
During The Persian Gulf War in 1991, Marines were reassigned from MWSS-272 and MWSS-274 to augment the squadron which was deployed in December 1990 and played a direct role in providing aviation ground support for UN forces conducting combat operations against Iraq. The Marines of MWSS-273 assisted in the construction of the largest expeditionary airfield in Marine Corps history at Al Khanjar, Saudi Arabia, in addition to several other major construction and transportation projects located at Ras Al Jubail, Ras Mishab, and on the Kuwait/Saudi Arabian border located at "LoneSome Dove". While conducting unit activities at Ras Mishab, the squadron received numerous FROG missile attacks from Iraqi enemy units located north of Ras Al Khafji during the first days of the "Air War Campaign".

Throughout the 1990s, the squadron provided extensive operational support for Aviano Air Base, Italy, NATO contingency operations Deny Flight and Provide Promise, Operation Uphold Democracy in Haiti, Operation Joint Forge in the Balkans, Operation Allied Force and Joint Task Force Noble Anvil in Taszar, Hungary, and numerous Marine Expeditionary Units. MWSS-273 has also provided support personnel for the ongoing Operation Enduring Freedom taking place in Afghanistan.
