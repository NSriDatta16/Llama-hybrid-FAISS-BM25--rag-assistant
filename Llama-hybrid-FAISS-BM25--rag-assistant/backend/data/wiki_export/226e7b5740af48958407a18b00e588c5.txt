The Pinkerton's Surrender Bridge (officially known as the Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad Bridge at Munhall) is a truss bridge that carries CSX Transportation's Pittsburgh Subdivision across the Monongahela River between Munhall, Pennsylvania and Rankin, Pennsylvania, United States. The structure's nickname references the 1892 Homestead strike, in which Pinkerton forces surrendered to striking union steelworkers. 
 

It is also known as the Pemickey Bridge, for the Pittsburgh, McKeesport and Youghiogheny Railroad (P. McK. & Y., pronounced "Pemickey") which used to run over the bridge.
