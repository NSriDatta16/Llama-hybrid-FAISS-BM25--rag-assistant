Arizona's 6th congressional district is a congressional district located in the U.S. state of Arizona and encompasses all of Greenlee County, most of Cochise County, and parts of Pima County, Pinal County and Graham  County. Most of its population resides in suburbs of Tucson, including Oro Valley, Marana, Green Valley, and Vail. The district is currently represented by Republican Juan Ciscomani. It was one of 18 districts that would have voted for Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election had they existed in their current configuration while being won or held by a Republican in 2022.

The new 6th district includes a notable military presence. The Fort Huachuca installation is located in Cochise County, approximately  north of the Mexican border, and is within the city of Sierra Vista.

History
Arizona picked up a sixth district after the 1990 census. It covered the northeast quadrant of the state, from Flagstaff to the New Mexico border. Most of its population, however, was located in the northeastern portion of the Valley of the Sun, including Tempe and Scottsdale.

After the 2000 census, most of the Maricopa County portion of the old 6th became the 5th district, while the 6th was reconfigured to take in most of the former 1st district. It included parts of Mesa, Chandler and all of Gilbert as well as the fast-growing town of Queen Creek. It also contained the city of Apache Junction in Pinal County. For the first time since its creation in 1951, it didn't include any of Phoenix itself. The district and its predecessors had seen its share of Phoenix gradually reduced amid the Valley's explosive growth in the second half of the 20th century.

George W. Bush received 64% of the vote in this district in 2004. John McCain—who represented this district (then numbered as the 1st) from 1983 to 1987—received 61.32% of the vote in the district in 2008, making it his best showing in his home state.

After the 2010 census, the old 6th district essentially became the 5th district, while the 6th was redrawn to take in most of the old 3rd district.
