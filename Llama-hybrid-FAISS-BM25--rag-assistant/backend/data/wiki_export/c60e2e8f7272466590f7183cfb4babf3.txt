Maple leaf cream cookies (also called maple leaf creme cookies, maple leaf cookies, maple creme cookies, maple leaf cremes,  and maple cremes) are Canadian sandwich cookies.

The cream filling is maple-flavoured, and may contain real maple syrup. The cookies are shaped like a maple leaf, a national symbol of Canada.

Several Canadian companies produce maple cremes, mainly for the domestic market, although they have a growing following in the United States.
