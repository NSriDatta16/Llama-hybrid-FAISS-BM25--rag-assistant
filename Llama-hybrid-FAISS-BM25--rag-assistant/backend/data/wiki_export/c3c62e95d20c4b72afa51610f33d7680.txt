Life
Togrul Ferman oglu Narimanbekov was born on August 7, 1930, in Baku. His father, Amirbey Narimanbekov, was a lawyer who had been in exile during the reign of Tsar Nicholas II. He held lesson in Kyiv. After the establishment of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, he returned to Azerbaijan and worked as a governor in Baku. His father, Ferman Narimanbekov, was one of the 40 students sent abroad by the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic to study. He graduated with a degree in electrical engineering from Toulouse University while in France. While living in France, he married Irma Lya Rude, a dressmaker. Togrul's brother Vidadi was born in France.

In 1929, Ferman Narimanbekov returned to Baku with his wife Irma Lya Rude and their son Vidadi. Togrul Narimanbekov was born during that time. Towards the end of 1930, Ferman Narimanbekov, like other Azerbaijani intellectuals who had received education in Europe, became a victim of repression and was exiled to the Siberian city of Marinsk. Later, his mother was also arrested and exiled. Togrul Narimanbekov lived with his mother in exile for a while. He eventually started attending school, going to classes in the morning, and returning to the prison in the evening, enduring challenging circumstances. In 1941, when France was occupied by Germany, Irma Rude was given the ultimatum to renounce her French citizenship or be sent into exile, but she chose not to renounce her citizenship and was first sent to Kazakhstan and later exiled to Samarkand. While his parents were imprisoned, Togrul and his brother were looked after by their Polish aunt, Anna Andreyevna. Later, he painted a portrait of his aunt and named the painting "Mother.

In 1946, Togrul Narimanbekov initially entered the Azim Azimzadeh State School of Painting in Azerbaijan. From 1950 onwards, he studied monumental and decorative painting at the Lithuanian Institute of Fine Arts. He graduated from there in 1955. At the same time, he began studying classical vocal music at the Vilnius Conservatory. During his student years, he met his mother in Samarkand. In 1961, Togrul's mother received amnesty and returned to Baku. His father, Ferman Bey Narimanbekov, who had been exiled to Siberia, also returned to his homeland after some time.

From the 1980s onward, Togrul Narimanbekov lived in several countries. He first traveled from Baku to Moscow and lived there for a while. In 1989, he was invited to Boston, Massachusetts, USA, where he held solo exhibitions. In 1992, he moved to the city of Luxembourg. He continued his artistic career in Luxembourg in 1992-1993. He held exhibitions in several galleries, which garnered significant attention. In 1993, he moved from Luxembourg to Paris. The reason Paris was particularly appealing to the artist was that his mother, Irma Rude, was originally French. The period of his life in Paris is considered one of the most productive in the artist's creative career.

Family 
Togrul Narimanbekov married twice during his lifetime. His first wife was the sculptor Elmira Huseynova, born in 1922. From this marriage, Togrul Narimanbekov had a daughter named Asmar. Elmira Huseynova passed away on January 23, 1995. The renowned painter later entered into a second marriage with the musician Sevil Nejefzade. From this marriage, the artist had a son named Fransua Narimanbekov. His son Fransua followed in his father's footsteps and became involved in painting.
