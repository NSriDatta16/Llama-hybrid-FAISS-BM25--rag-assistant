Annual events
St Pete's puts on two different plays every year, one by the grade 7 and 8 students and the other by the high school students. The high school's performance is often a musical.

St. Peter's show choir (Treble Threat) also used to perform annually at the local "choir fest," a gathering of numerous Christian choirs to sing and celebrate the Christmas season. The choir also has many other annual events, formerly including the Show Choir Canada Competition held at the Sony Center in Toronto. In 2012, St Pete's performed and won a national bronze medal, only losing to choirs from two of the audition-based performing art schools located in Toronto.

Location 
The high school is located on Charlemagne Boulevard in the community of Fallingbrook in Orléans, Ontario. Construction began in 1991 and the school was completed for the 1992–1993 academic year. As the student population grew, portable classrooms were set up in the lot behind the main building. A new wing was constructed and opened in 2005, replacing a number of these classrooms.

The school is served by OC Transpo routes 35 and 131.
