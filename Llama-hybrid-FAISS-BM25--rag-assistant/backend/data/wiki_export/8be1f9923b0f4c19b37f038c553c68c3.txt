Black Diamond is the debut studio album by American singer Angie Stone. It was released on September 28, 1999, by Arista Records. The album is named after Stone's then-teenaged daughter Diamond Ti'ara.

Critical reception

In his review for Billboard, Michael Paoletta declared the album "a musically rich and empowering journey through life's many ups and downs" that pairs "smooth, mellow grooves [...] with emotion-packed lyrics." He further wrote: "For those lamenting the lack of honest R&B/soul, stop worrying: With Black Diamond, it's back where it belongs." AllMusic editor Theresa E. LaVeck rated the album four out of five stars. She noted that "purposefully positive, the album chronicles Stone's journeys maintaining personal faith and loving relationships, resplendent with new takes on traditional soul sounds. Stone supports her songwriting and vocal talents with help from A-list musicians/writer/producers such as Lenny Kravitz and D'Angelo. The sophisticated mix is elevated by Stone's incredible voice." 

Entertainment Weeklys Laura Morgan found that "on her alluring retro-soul bow, the Southern songstress pairs sensual R&B with tastefully lean production, allowing her raw emotion to roam free." Ayana Byrd, writing for Rolling Stone, compared Stone's vocal performance with Chaka Khan and Gladys Knight and remarked that "Stone's Southern country-road sensibilities prevent her from being derivative of her obvious influences; instead, Black Diamond shines with the intensity of brilliant soul." BBC Music critic Daryl Easlea called the album "a fine debut" that proclaims "after years of struggle, Stone's arrival as an artist in her own right." Kerry Potter from Q described Black Diamond as "a low-key album of quietly poetic soul, epitomised by the muffled funk of "Green Grass Vapors." [It] is meandering and over-polished at times, but, in the main, hints at a sparkling future." Exclaim! editor Del F. Cowie complimented the album for its "classy and subdued mood."
