I Want to Be a Clone is the title of the debut EP by new wave and post-punk influenced Christian musician Steve Taylor. As in later works, the singer-songwriter mixed criticism of general secular society, for things such as empty materialism and selfishness, with criticism of Christian church organizations, for things such as muddying the gospel message for marketing. Jonathan David Brown produced the work.

After hearing this album, influential Christian author Francis Schaeffer wrote the following to Taylor; "The combination of music and lyrics really works on a very high level, and the message, therefore, comes across with real clarity... in the light of the gifts that the Lord has so obviously given you, and which you obviously developed with care and hard work, I do urge you with all my heart to press on. You are really doing something marvelously worthwhile. I must say the words really cut a wide swath in the need in the church today."
