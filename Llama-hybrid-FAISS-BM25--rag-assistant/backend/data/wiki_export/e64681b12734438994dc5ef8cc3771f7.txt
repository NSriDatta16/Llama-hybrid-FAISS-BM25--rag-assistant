Francis Brabazon (24 January 1907 – 24 June 1984) was an Australian poet and a member of Meher Baba's mandali.

Brabazon was born in London, but moved to Australia with his family when he was still a boy. At the age of 21, he embarked on a quest to discover the relationship between beauty and truth. He studied music and painting and finally found his niche in poetry. In the 1940s, Brabazon became interested in Eastern spirituality and soon became a student of the Australian Sufi leader Baron Friedrich von Frankenberg.

With the death of his Sufi teacher in 1950, Brabazon became the head of the Sufi Movement in Australia. He met Meher Baba on a trip to America in 1952 and later described Baba as "the very personification of truth and the very embodiment of beauty." After returning to Australia, Francis and a party of helpers managed to complete "Beacon Hill house" near Sydney in time for Baba's first visit to Australia in August 1956. It was later renamed "Meher House". In 1958 Brabazon established a new center on a  estate on Kiel Mountain, Woombye, Queensland to host Meher Baba on his second visit. This was named Avatar's Abode.

Brabazon's grave is on Avatar's Abode and the Avatar's Abode Trust holds copyright of his works.
