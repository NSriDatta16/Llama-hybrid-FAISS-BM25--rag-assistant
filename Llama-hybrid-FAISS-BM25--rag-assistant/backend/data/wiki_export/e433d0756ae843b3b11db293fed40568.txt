Plot
Raju Malhotra and Rajan Malhotra study at the same college but are poles apart in every trait. While Raju is a brat, poor in studies but good in sports, Rajan is a brilliant student but a zero in extracurricular activities. The college they study at has a new and strict principal, Mr. Awasthi who wants to transform this ill-reputed college into a flocked one. Hence he divides the students according to their merit. So while Raju is fit for the C section, for poorly performing students, Rajan easily gets access to the A section with his 90% marks. But Raju falls for a girl in A-section and hence swaps his place with a hesitant Rajan who enters C-section for the first time in his life. Mr. Awasthi learns of this and retaliates by sending their names to a quiz and dance competition. So now, geeky Rajan will have to dance while brat Raju will have to answer questions hurled at him. What will Raju and Rajan do? Will they accept the challenge or just scoot off?
