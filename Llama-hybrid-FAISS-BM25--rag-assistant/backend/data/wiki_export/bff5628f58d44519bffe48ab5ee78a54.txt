Torbalı is a municipality and district of İzmir Province, Turkey. Its area is 577 km2, and its population is 207,840 (2022).

An ancient Ionian city, Metropolis, is found in the district. It was famous for its wines and religious sites, and had three sanctuaries in marble dedicated to the Roman Emperor Augustus and his foster child Germanicus, in an ancient theatre which dominates the valley.
