Gods on Voodoo Moon is the first recording and release by American rock band White Zombie, released independently as an EP in November 1985. It was their only release with Paul "Ena" Kostabi on guitar and Peter Landau on drums.

Production 
The six songs, including "Black Friday" and "Dead or Alive", were all recorded in one session and in one take each.

Release and reception 

The EP was initially only released to vinyl. The songs "Black Friday" and "Dead Or Alive" were recorded during the same sessions but were excluded from the vinyl pressings due to lack of space. A cassette version was released in 1989 on Caroline Records featuring the two unreleased tracks. Due to a lack of funds at the time, only 300 copies of vinyl were pressed at Macola Records, Hollywood, California, 100 of which were sold, while the others remained in the possession of the band.

The EP was re-released by the Numero Group on June 3, 2016, as part of the It Came from N.Y.C. retrospective box set. Remastered by Jay Yuenger, the set was available on 5 vinyl discs with a free digital download in 320 KBps MP3 format, or as a 3-CD set. This release includes the two tracks previously only available on cassette.

It was re-released on Record Store Day, in April 2017, on red ("Zombie Blood") vinyl and white ("Zombie Pus") vinyl, on 750 copies total.
