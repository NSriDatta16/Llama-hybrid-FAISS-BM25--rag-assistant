Music video
Directed by Jeb Brien and shot in New Jersey, the music video for "Un Alma Sentenciada" tells the story of a hermit woman who lives in a lost city. She lives alone, and therefore she feels surprised when she finds a strange shoe lying on the ground. 

Then, she starts looking for the intruder, and she find a poor, injured man. She takes him home, takes care of him and washes his feet. Finally, she falls asleep at his side, and she has a dream where the poor man is Jesus, who puts a little rock in her hand. When she wakes up, the man is not at her side, but the rock of her dream is in her hand. Then, she realizes that the dream was not a dream.

The video was officially released by the TV Magazine "Primer Impacto" ("First Impact").
