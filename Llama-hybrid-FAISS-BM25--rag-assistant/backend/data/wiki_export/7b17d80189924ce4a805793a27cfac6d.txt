Reception

Robo Pit received mixed reviews. Critics generally reviled the one-player mode as mind-numbingly long and easy, but were much more pleased with the two-player mode, though some criticized the lack of support for the PlayStation Link Cable. They particularly praised the ability to create one's own robot and save it to memory card, the winner's claiming of one of their opponent's arms as a prize, and the generally fun quality of the gameplay. Most found the graphics generally lacking in detail, but liked the cute and varied robot designs. The controls were also praised as being accurate and easy to learn.

Reviews for the Saturn port made similar comments, though this time they tended to criticize rather than complement the cuteness of the robots. A review in Next Generation said the Saturn and PlayStation versions are "nearly identical".
