The Love of Hopeless Causes is the sixth studio album by British rock band New Model Army, released in 1993. It was produced by Niko Bolas, except "Afternoon Song", which was produced by Riku Mattila. It featured guest musicians, guitarist Adrian Portas and Clive Layton, who played the Hammond organ on "Fate".

After the break from EMI, The Love of Hopeless Causes was the band's only album to be released on Epic, prior to the formation of the band's own label, Attack Attack Records.

The album saw the band abandoning the folk rock-oriented sound of their previous albums, Thunder and Consolation (1989) and Impurity (1990), going for a more classic straightforward rock sound.

The album reached No. 22 on the UK Albums Chart in April 1993.
