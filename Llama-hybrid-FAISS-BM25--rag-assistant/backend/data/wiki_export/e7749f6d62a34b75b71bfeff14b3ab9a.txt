WMTU-FM 91.9 is a campus radio station run by the students at Michigan Technological University. It is found in the basement of Wadsworth Hall. It works 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Staff is constituted of a volunteer general staff featuring a general manager and six different departments as well as the air staff.  Open DJ signups are held the first Wednesday and Thursday of each semester, including the summer tracks.

History
The station's precursor, WVRW (Voice of Radio, Wadsworth), began broadcasting in 1956, as a carrier current AM station. It changed its callsign to WRS (Wadsworth Radio Service) two years later, to show that it now served all dormitories on campus. The current WMTU callsign was adopted in 1975. Two years after that WMTU began broadcasting as a cable FM station via the local cable television system. The 24-hour format, with three-hour shows, was adopted two years later in 1979.

In 1993 WMTU received an FM broadcasting license from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The following year the station began over-the-air broadcasting from atop the Mechanical Engineering and Engineering Mechanics building on the Michigan Tech campus with an effective radiated power of 100 watts. In 1998 WMTU began broadcasting via RealAudio, utilizing a Helix server located in the basement of Michigan Tech's Electrical Engineering Resources Center (EERC).

In 2004 renovations to Wadsworth Hall resulted in a move from the original location next to the Tri-Hall Weight Club to a temporary location near the Campus Cafe. In 2005 the FCC approved a request for WMTU to move its transmitter to a university-owned tower atop Arcadia Hill. This allowed the station to upgrade its power from 100 watts to 4400 watts effective radiated power, providing coverage to campus as well as many surrounding communities. Later that year the station returned to its original location, now sporting a new "storefront" look along with nearly triple the music storage space. Renovations also resulted in a "commons" area outside of the station, used for small concerts and other activities, as well as a room which the WMTU staff uses for weekly meetings.

In 2009 WMTU changed its daily schedule to 12 two-hour shows. In 2012 the station remodeled its DJ booth with new equipment and a new look, and began broadcasting continuous 24-hour broadcast over breaks for the first time.

Station programming
WMTU currently runs seventy programs, all of which are staffed by volunteers who apply at semesterly DJ meetings. Primetime slots are generally allocated based upon seniority, volunteer work at the station, and uniqueness of programming offered. All programming decisions are made by the Program Director and the Broadcast Supervisor, both positions elected yearly by WMTU's General Staff.

WMTU allows DJs to play music of their choice without any prescribed playlisting. Commercial free programming including metal, hip hop, techno, punk, indie, classic rock, electronica, Americana, noise, industrial, world, local, and freeform all appear on WMTU's current programming schedule.

Local artists that have performed on air include Erik Koskinen, VSEPR, the Lumber Janes, Flashing Red Airplane, Carp, and Sycamore Smith. In the fall semester of the 2010 school year local music blog Mostly Midwest partnered with WMTU for an official Mostly Midwest radio show every Tuesday and Thursday from 6-8pm. This program showcases local midwestern acts and promotes upcoming local area shows, as well as providing information on upcoming local CD releases, interviews with out-of-town musicians, and occasional CD giveaways.

The DJ of the Week program airs each Saturday afternoon from 2pm-5pm, featuring WMTU's up-and-coming DJs and giving the programming and broadcasting departments the chance to evaluate the musical selections and general style of newer DJs.
