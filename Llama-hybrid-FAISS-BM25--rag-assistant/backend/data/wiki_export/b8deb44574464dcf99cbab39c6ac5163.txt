Eighth Day Slice and Fiddlin on Ya Roof are the second album and first album of original songs by the Australian punk rock band Yidcore, released on 13 June 2005 (see 2005 in music). Eighth Day Slice is an album containing Yidcore's first original, composed songs as well as several covers. It includes a cover of Bette Midler's "Wind Beneath My Wings" and the track "Since I Bothered You" which both received play on Triple J as well as its counterpart music video show Rage.

Fiddlin on Ya Roof is a reworking of the musical Fiddler on the Roof. It features guest vocals from Ben Lee, Useless ID, Ren√©e Geyer, Ella Hooper, Handsome Dick Manitoba, The Drugs and Adam Goren (of Atom And His Package).

Some of these tracks have previously been released: "Why Won't Adam Sandler Let Us Do His Song?" previously appeared on the Chicken Soup Caper and Adam Slander EPs and tracks 3, 7, 15 and 16 previously appeared on the compilation Scrambles: New, Rare, Live and Classic Shtick released on Yidcore's first tour of Israel in 2003.

Despite being a double album, the whole package could easily fit on one CD.
