The Fifth Sorceress
Newcomb's debut novel The Fifth Sorceress was accused of misogyny or sexism, and was critically panned. In response to the criticism, Newcomb said his intent was not "to be sexist or to be controversial, or to espouse some anti-politically correct viewpoint. It just happened to be the particular story I wanted to tell to get the saga rolling."
