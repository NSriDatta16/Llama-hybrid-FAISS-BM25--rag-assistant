In 1908, Carlos Gruneisen y Julio Ulises Martin (Swiss, born 31 July 1862, creator of the Yerbatera Martin, in Rosario), acquired the land that would become the jurisdiction of Villa Angela.  He had the tannin factory, La Chaqueña S.A., built and the adjacent areas immediately began to be settled.

Punta de rieles and km 95 were the names it first received when it was no more than a hamlet. In 1910, as a tribute to the centennial of the May Revolution and 24 May, they decided to found a village and give it the name Villa Ángela. It was named after Ángela Joostens, the wife of Julio Ulises Martin, one of its two founders.
