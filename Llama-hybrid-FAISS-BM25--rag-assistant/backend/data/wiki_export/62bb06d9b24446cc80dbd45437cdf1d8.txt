The Kiss Kasket is an item of merchandise licensed by the rock band Kiss.  It is a casket decorated with a Kiss logo and pictures of the band members. In introducing the Kiss Kasket, Gene Simmons said, "I love livin', but this makes the alternative look pretty damn good." The Kiss Kasket went on sale in 2001; as of 2008, it was no longer available from Kiss' website. As of February 2011, the second-generation models of the Kiss Kasket became available on Kiss's website.

Dimebag Darrell, the guitarist of Pantera and Damageplan, was buried in a Kiss Kasket donated by Simmons at Darrell’s funeral in 2004. His brother Vinnie Paul, the drummer of Pantera, Damageplan, and Hellyeah, was also buried in a Kiss Kasket at his funeral in 2018.

The line will reportedly include caskets, cremation urns, bronze memorials, memorial prayer cards, registry books, memorial candles, and pet cremation urns—-all designed after the famous rock band's iconic images.
