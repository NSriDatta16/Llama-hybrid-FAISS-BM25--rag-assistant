The 1991–92 UEFA Cup was the 21st season of Europe's then-tertiary club football tournament organised by UEFA. It was won by Dutch club Ajax on away goals over Torino of Italy. The victory made Ajax only the second team – after Torino's city rivals Juventus – to have won all three major European trophies (European Cup/UEFA Champions League, UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League, and the Cup Winners' Cup).

Although this was the second season since the ban on English clubs in European competitions was lifted, only one English club was entered into the 1991–92 UEFA Cup. Liverpool, who had been forced to serve an extra year over all other English clubs as they had been the team present at the Heysel disaster which had sparked the ban in 1985, was England's representatives in the competition, and ultimately reached the quarter-finals. The defending champion was Internazionale, which was eliminated in the first round by Boavista.

Teams
A total of 64 teams participated in the competition, all entering into the first round.
