The International Literacy Association (ILA), formerly the International Reading Association (IRA), is an international global advocacy and member professional organization that was created in 1956 to improve reading instruction, facilitate dialogue about research on reading, and encourage the habit of reading across the globe.

The organization is headquartered in Newark, Delaware, United States, with a network of more than 300,000 literacy educators, researchers, and experts across 128 countries.
The current ILA President of the Board is Kia Brown-Dudley.

Publishing

ILA officially ended its book publishing program on June 30, 2018. However, the organization continues to publish three peer-reviewed academic journals:

 The Reading Teacher—for those working with children to age 12
 Journal of Adolescent & Adult Literacy—for teachers of older learners
 Reading Research Quarterly—publishes contributions in literacy research

Reading Online, an e-journal, sponsored by the organization, was retired in 2005.

Literacy Today (formerly titled Reading Today), ILA’s membership magazine, was published from 1983 to 2011 as a bimonthly membership newspaper. From the 2011 August/September issue forward, the publication was split into two parts: a bimonthly print magazine and an interactive digital e-zine. Literacy Today is currently an online-only quarterly magazine.
