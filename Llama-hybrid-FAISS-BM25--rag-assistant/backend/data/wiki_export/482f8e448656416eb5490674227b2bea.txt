Wild Love is the fourth album by Bill Callahan (also known as Smog), released on March 27, 1995, on Drag City and re-released in Europe on Domino in 2001. Jim O'Rourke appeared as cellist on this album, his first collaboration with Smog. Drag City's producer Rian Murphy helped to develop a wider musical palette than its predecessor Julius Caesar.

Critical reception
Wild Love has attracted favorable critical reviews. In a retrospective biography of Smog, AllMusic's Jason Ankeny called the album "a triumph of abject failure", seeing that it "reflected [Callahan's] bitter obsessions with stunning clarity."

Cat Power later covered "Bathysphere" on her 1996 album What Would the Community Think.
