BlackBerry Enterprise Server designates the middleware software package that is part of the BlackBerry wireless platform supplied by BlackBerry Limited.  The software plus service connects to messaging and collaboration software (MDaemon Messaging Server, Microsoft Exchange, Lotus Domino, Novell GroupWise) on enterprise networks to redirect emails and synchronize contacts and calendaring information between servers, desktop workstations, as well as mobile devices. Some third-party connectors exist, including Scalix, Zarafa, Zimbra, and the Google Apps BES Connector, although these are not supported by BlackBerry Limited. As of June 2018, BlackBerry Enterprise Server has been renamed to BlackBerry Unified Endpoint Manager (UEM).

Before version 4.0, BES was largely two separate codebases, with the 2.2 version for Domino and the 3.6 version for Exchange. In version 4.0 and beyond, much of the code is integrated, but separate distributions remain for each supported mail platform.  Beginning with version 4.1.2, the company introduced a newer option, BlackBerry Enterprise Server for Applications, which provides a secure wireless gateway for BlackBerry devices without requiring the device owner to possess an email account.  The latest major revision, version 5.0, was released in 2009 for Exchange and Domino; support for GroupWise was added in 2010.

To support the growing number of multiple devices, ownership models, and operating environments, BlackBerry reinvented Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM) by bringing together Mobile Device Management, Security, Unified Communications and Applications by launching BlackBerry Enterprise Service 10 (BES 10). This represents the unification and simplification of its products to deliver an integrated and end-to-end solution. Mobile Device Management - it enables enterprises to manage their entire device fleet ever, the types of devices, the brands, ownership, operating system (BlackBerry 10, iOS or Android)  and type of usage. Security - it enables enterprises to have secured end-to-end mobility. Unified Communication - it enables enterprises to integrate voice, messaging, PIM, apps, and social experiences. Applications enable enterprises to manage business, productivity, and personal apps.

Managing BES 5 
BES is typically deployed and managed within the enterprise by messaging administrators (for example, the individuals already responsible for managing Microsoft Exchange, Lotus Domino, or Novell GroupWise) or sometimes a dedicated IT person, usually called the BlackBerry or BES Administrator.

BPS and BES Express 
As of 2010, RIM is offering free the Blackberry Enterprise Server Express edition with no user limitations. It has a few minor feature limitations but only requires a data plan - not a BES plan. It enables near-instant seamless mail and calendar integration with your existing exchange server (incoming emails often appear on the Blackberry handset before they appear in the Outlook or OWA clients), which is an advantage over the existing Outlook Web Access model that the Blackberry Internet Service offers.The free download requires a license code, which may be delayed due to demand.

As of January 2007, RIM is offering a free version of BES called BlackBerry Professional Software, a free download from the BlackBerry website and includes 1 user license. BPSE provides a "...wireless communications and collaboration solution designed specifically for small and medium-sized businesses." It comes with one CAL (Client Access License) - meaning one BlackBerry handheld can be activated on the Server, and you can add up to 29 additional CALs (for a total of 30) or upgrade to BlackBerry Enterprise Server at any time. It is only available for Notes and Exchange environments. BPS is based on the 4.1 code, but with a more simplified management tool, a limited number of patches are being released. (BPS is "stuck" at v 4.1.4, where full BES is at 4.1.6 plus maintenance Releases). As such, BPS is missing out on some functions that full BES did get from SP6 onwards, such as rich content email, free/busy search, and remote search.

Blackberry Professional Software - originally called Blackberry Enterprise Server Express - first appeared with version 4. There was BES (full), and BES Express (same as full, but no cost, limited maximum number of clients, and 1 CAL included free); they then renamed BES Express to BPS, but it was still the same thing, and then later they introduced BES Express 5, which is rather different from the previous BES Express and BPS primarily because it allows non-BES devices/subscribers to have a "full-fat" Blackberry experience which is finally cost/feature competitive with Exchange ActiveSync devices, i.e., provides full synchronisation of read/unread status, deletions, mail subfolders (including sent items), contacts, and calendar, all without license costs and the requirement of an expensive and sometimes extremely difficult to acquire BES tariff. (For example, Orange in the UK may make it challenging to supply BES package/provisioning to less than 10 handsets at a time, and other operators often have extreme difficulty applying the BES package to handsets/subscribers that were originally BIS supplied.)

For GroupWise RIM offered Blackberry Enterprise Server.  version 5.0 is available.

BlackBerry Enterprise Server Resource Kit 
The BlackBerry Enterprise Server Resource Kit (BRK) is a collection of useful tools and other resources released to expand the manageability of the BlackBerry Enterprise Server. These tools are available as a free download. Each BRK release is developed and certified as compatible for each BES service pack.

The BRK includes tools such as:
 BlackBerry User Administration Service (BESUserAdmin) — Allows administrators to perform user and smartphone administration on the command line level.
 NoResponseCheck Tool — Analyzes the logs for threads reporting as non-responsive to differentiate between non-responsive and slow threads.
 MessageFlow Tool — Tracks the flow of mail from the mail server through the BlackBerry Enterprise Server to the BlackBerry smartphone and provides statistics in a csv file 
 AvailIndex Tool — Analyzes log files and produces a snapshot report of user activity for a specific time in a CSV file.
 HistoricalStats Tool — Checks usage patterns of individual users and provides statistics on a per-day per-user basis.
 OutOf Coverage Tool — Checks for users who have not sent/received it in a specified time.
 Pending Tool — Tracks messages pending delivery in BlackBerry Enterprise Server.
 Delayed Notifics administrators to detect when BlackBerry Enterprise Server is no longer receiving notifications for new emails in a timely fashion.
