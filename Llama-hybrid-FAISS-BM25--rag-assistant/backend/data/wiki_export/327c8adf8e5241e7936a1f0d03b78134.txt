Critical reception
"Ms. New Booty" received generally mixed reviews from music critics who questioned Bubba's decision to deliver a cliché mainstream hip-hop track.

Mike Diver of Drowned in Sound said that despite the inclusion of the Ying Yang Twins, the song doesn't steer away from Bubba's laidback flow of sexual content over dance-worthy production. Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club found the female glorification vibe of the song tolerable because of Bubba's sensible flow, saying that "he retains a courtly formality that sets him apart." Steve 'Flash' Juon of RapReviews said that the production and Bubba's energetic flow manage to lift the song above subpar lyrics, saying that "Admittedly Bubba's not going to win any "Best Lyric Writing of 2006" awards for this song, but between him and the Ying Yang it's not hard to see who comes off like a champ."

Pitchfork writer Tom Breihan found the song's production lacking in creativity but backhandedly said that its "depressingly boring, but it's done its job, giving Bubba his biggest-ever hit." Jeff Vrabel of PopMatters found it disappointing that Bubba dwindled the talents from his first two albums to deliver an "exceedingly conservative" stripper track. Peter Relic of Rolling Stone found the song derivative of other southern hip-hop tracks, in terms of lyrical subject and production, saying that it "further suggest Sparxxx is trying to fit new rims on retreads."
