The championship battle took on a new complexion going into Miami. After polesitter Brian Vickers led the opening 6 laps, none of the title contenders were a serious threat for the win, though all but Keller and Hornaday ran in the Top 10 in the first half of the race. Point leader Scott Riggs dropped from the Top 10 due to a loose condition, exacerbated by a long green flag run. Though he gained several spots in the pit cycle by coming in early, he slid into the wall on Lap 166 and ended his day in the garage in 38th. Hamilton rebounded with another Top 5, with Vickers and Green in the Top 10, Keller on the lead lap in 13th, and Hornaday, who never cracked the Top 10 all day, a lap down in 17th. All this left 20 year old Brian Vickers with a 22 point lead over 1994 champion David Green, with Riggs dropping from the lead to 5th, and 6th place Hamilton still in reasonable contention at 89 points out of the lead. Disregarding what any of his title challengers might do, Vickers would secure the championship if he could finish 3rd or better at Homestead.

Scott Riggs' championship hopes ended on the first lap, when he crashed in Turn 3 with teammate Jon Wood and the FitzBradshaw Racing duo of Casey Atwood and Tim Fedewa. Riggs' crew would repair the car, but he would only complete 28 laps before ending his day in 41st. Despite the disappointing end to 2003, he would look ahead to 2004 and the start of his Nextel Cup Series career with MBV Motorsports.
Two-time series runner-up Jason Keller was never a factor, and he finished a lap down in 24th. Ron Hornaday Jr finished 15th, leader Brian Vickers 11th, David Green 9th, and Bobby Hamilton Jr 3rd after leading 41 laps.
With Green only gaining 8 points on leader Vickers, the 20 year old from Thomasville, North Carolina won the Busch Series championship by 14 points. He was also the youngest series champion in history, breaking the record set by the late Rob Moroso, who was 21 when he overcame Tommy Houston for the 1989 NASCAR Busch Series title. Vickers, like Riggs, would be a candidate for 2004 Nextel Cup rookie of the year, graduating with Hendrick Motorsports. 18 year old Kyle Busch would take his place in the #5 Busch car for 2004.

Rookie of the Year 

Despite not completing a full schedule and running for two different teams, David Stremme was named the 2003 Busch Series Rookie of the Year, posting three top-five finishes. Runner-up Coy Gibbs ran the full schedule and finished 14th in points, but did not accumulate enough rookie points to overtake Stremme. He would retire from racing at the end of the year. Third-place finisher Joey Clanton shared the #27 Brewco Motorsports ride with fellow rookie Chase Montgomery, while Chad Blount finished fourth running part-time with Braun and Carroll Racing. Regan Smith, Damon Lusk, and Chris Bingham were released from their rides during the season.
