CRRC Changchun Railway Vehicles Co., Ltd. () is a Chinese rolling stock manufacturer and a division of the CRRC. While the CRV emerged in 2002, the company's roots date back to the establishment of the Changchun Car Company in 1954. The company became a division of CNR Corporation before its merger with CSR to form the present CRRC. It has produced a variety of rolling stock for customers in China and abroad, including locomotives, passenger cars, multiple units, rapid transit and light rail vehicles. It has established technology transfer partnerships with several foreign railcar manufacturers, including Bombardier Transportation, Alstom, and Siemens Mobility.

Joint Ventures
In 2004 Alstom won the first high speed train contract in China, supporting CRRC to build 60 CRH5 high speed trains.

In November 2016, CRRC won the contract to build the High Capacity Metro Train for the Melbourne suburban train network, as part of Evolution Rail, a public–private partnership including the Downer Group and the Plenary Group.

Changchun Bombardier Railway Vehicles Co. Ltd. (CBRC)
In 1996, CRRC and Adtranz (later Bombardier Transportation) established a joint venture. CRRC has built cars for Shanghai Metro, Guangzhou Metro and Shenzhen Metro since 2000.
