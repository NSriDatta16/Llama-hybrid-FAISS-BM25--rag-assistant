Carl L. Garrett (August 31, 1947 â€“ August 24, 2020) was an American football running back who began his professional career with the American Football League (AFL)'s Boston Patriots.

Carl Garrett caught 29 passes for 267 yards and two touchdowns in 1969, and ran the ball for over five yards per carry with 137 attempts for 691 yards and five touchdowns. He was the 1969 Sporting News ' AFL Rookie of the Year. He was also selected to the AFL All-Star team in 1969.

Garrett was involved in a highly unusual trade just prior to the 1971 season.  The Patriots traded Garrett to the Dallas Cowboys for running back Duane Thomas.  Shortly after the players reported to their new teams, the trade was rescinded, and Thomas returned to the Cowboys and Garrett to the Patriots.  The Cowboys ultimately won the Super Bowl at the end of the 1971 season with Duane Thomas as their leading rusher in the game.
