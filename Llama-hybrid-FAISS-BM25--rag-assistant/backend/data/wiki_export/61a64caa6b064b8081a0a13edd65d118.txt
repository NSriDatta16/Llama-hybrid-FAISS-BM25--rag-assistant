Allan A. Lamport Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium on King Street West in the Liberty Village neighbourhood of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is the practice facility for the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League.  It is also partial home for Canada national rugby league team.  The playing surface of the 9,600 seating capacity stadium is also dually marked for soccer and field hockey. The stadium was named for long-time Toronto politician Allan Lamport, who was associated with sporting activities in the city.

History
Lamport Stadium was built during the winter and spring of 1974–1975 on the site of the Andrew Mercer Reformatory for Women, and opened on July 1, 1975.

As part of a deal with the city to convert BMO Field to natural grass, Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment spent  adding a winter bubble to Lamport Stadium in the winter of 2009–2010.  MLSE manages the operations of the facility during the winter season, when the field is covered by the dome and community soccer programs are held.

Since opening in 1975, the playing surface has been artificial turf. Lamport Stadium's indoor field measures 68 metres by 105 metres, allowing a full eleven-a-side game.
