Early life
Walter was born in Mbale in East Africa where his father worked for the British government. He returned to India as a young boy to pursue his education, which he did in Saint Josephs in Bangalore
It was while he was a schoolboy in Bangalore that he started playing hockey. In the early 1940s he played for a club called the Bangalore Blues. He then moved to Bombay and joined the Times Of India and played both hockey and soccer for them.
He subsequently joined the Lusitanians - a Goan hockey team that in years to come fielded several Olympians including fellow Olympians Leo Pinto, Maxi Vaz, Reggie Rodrigues and Amir Kumar.

A member of the Indian Field Hockey Team that took the gold medal at the 1948 Olympic competition, Walter D’Souza's athletic career lasted around two decades.
