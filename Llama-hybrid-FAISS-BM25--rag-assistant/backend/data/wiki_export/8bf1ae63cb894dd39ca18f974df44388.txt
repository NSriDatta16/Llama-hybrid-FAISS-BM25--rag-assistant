Synopsis
Adriana is proud of Christopher's screenwriting and enrolls him in an acting course. He is applauded for his acting in an emotional scene in which he plays a son with his father. When a student asks him how he managed to seemingly cry on cue, an embarrassed Christopher walks out. In the next class, while playing another scene with the student who had played his father, Christopher violently beats him. Adriana suggests this was because he was angry with his father for dying when Christopher was young. That night he throws away everything he has written.

Furio Giunta is now in New Jersey, a soldier with the DiMeo crime family. Christopher has been making collections from the owner of a tanning salon that is used to front a brothel, but payments have been short. Tony sends Furio to obtain the money owed. Furio breaks the owner's arm and shoots him in the kneecap, then hits and spits on his wife.

With Furio's arrival, Tony promotes Paulie and Silvio, but refuses to promote Pussy. Pussy sees this as a betrayal and complains about it to Agent Lipari, who feels he has been passed over in his job as well. Sympathizing with each other, each complains about the declining standards of his own organization.

Tony becomes irate when he learns that Janice is using their mother's house as security for a loan. He goes to the house early one morning to confront her. He is taken aback when the door is opened by Richie, who says that he and Janice have revived their previous relationship. Tony leaves, saying with disgust, "She's your fucking problem now."

Tony visits Hesh Rabkin, seeking the comfort and guidance from him that he is not getting from Dr. Melfi. Hesh is sympathetic and tells Tony that Tony's father also had panic attacks. However, Hesh gets bored listening to Tony and rambles on about his own experiences. 

Dr. Melfi consults Dr. Kupferberg in order to understand her feelings about Tony. Eventually, she decides to resume treating him. During their first session, while questions are being asked and answered, it seems they cannot stop smiling at each other.
