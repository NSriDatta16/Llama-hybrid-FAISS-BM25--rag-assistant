Castlereagh Street is a  major street located in the Sydney central business district in New South Wales, Australia. The street runs in a north-to-south, in a one way direction only.

Description
Castlereagh Street's northern terminus is at the junction of Hunter Street, with its southern terminus at the junction with Hay Street, near Belmore Park. The street is one-way southbound to motorised traffic, with a bicycle path running in both directions from Liverpool Street to Hay Street.

At its northern end near Martin Place, the street is lined by many of Sydney's most expensive boutiques and jewellery stores, such as Chanel, Gucci, Cartier, Bvlgari, Dior, Prada, Van Cleef & Arpels, Ermenegildo Zegna, Omega and Mont Blanc.

Etymology
Previously Chapel Row and Camden Street, Castlereagh Street was named by Governor Macquarie in 1810 in honour of Viscount Castlereagh, the Secretary of State for the Colonies. At the time the street included what is now known as Loftus Street, named as Castlereagh Street North, until 1881, and what is now known as Chalmers Street, prior to the establishment of Belmore Park, until 1905.

History
Castlereagh Street once contained the Australia Hotel, whose foundation stone was laid by Sir Henry Parkes, and the Theatre Royal. Both of these buildings were demolished during the 1970s.

The Circular Quay to Central station line was an important part of the Sydney tram network. It was an extremely busy service for passengers transferring from suburban trains, particularly prior to the opening of the City Circle underground railway line in 1926. Trams operated in a loop from Central station, running north along Pitt Street to Circular Quay returning south via Castlereagh Street. These tracks were also used by some eastern and south-western routes during busy periods. The line closed on 27 September 1957 with four tram services replaced with buses and three others diverted to operate via Elizabeth Street. The line made use of the sandstone viaduct onto the colonnade above Eddy Avenue at Central station, which since 1997 has formed part of the Inner West Light Rail.

Having previously operated as a one-way street in a northerly direction, in February 1987 Castlereagh Street was changed to operate in a southerly direction. In 1997, a bus lane was introduced between Hunter and Bathurst Streets.
