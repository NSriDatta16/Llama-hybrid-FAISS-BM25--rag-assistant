Roedean School for Girls is a private English medium and boarding school for girls situated in the suburb of Parktown in the city of  Johannesburg in the  Gauteng province of South Africa.

History
The school was founded in 1903 by Theresa Lawrence and, Katherine Margaret Earle: two young women in their early thirties, both educated at the University of Cambridge. They acted as joint Heads of School during the years 1903â€“1930. It is a sister school of Roedean School in Brighton, England which was founded by three older sisters of Theresa Lawrence, namely Penelope, Millicent, and Dorothy.

The school began with 22 pupils, and was situated in a small house in Jeppestown, Johannesburg. In 1904, it relocated to its current site in Parktown, Johannesburg.
 
Sir Herbert Baker, a prominent architect responsible for many of Johannesburg's most historical houses and monuments, designed the original school buildings. The oldest structures include St. Ursula's Building and Founder's Hall. Over the years, additions have been made, but the signature Herbert Baker features, with arches, colonnades, unwashed brickwork, and courtyards have been maintained.
