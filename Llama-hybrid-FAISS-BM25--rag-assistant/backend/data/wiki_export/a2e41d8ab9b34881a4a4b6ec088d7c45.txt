Dominic Simon Barrett (often called Dom Barrett) (born 30 July 1985 in Cambridge, England) is one of England's leading ten-pin bowlers. He competes in world events and on the PBA Tour, where he has won ten titles. This total includes three PBA major titles: the PBA World Championship (2013), the U.S. Open (2018) and the Tournament of Champions (2022), which makes him one of nine triple crown winners in PBA history and the first European player to accomplish the feat. He has been the ranking winner on the European Bowling Tour (EBT) in three seasons (2010, 2012 and 2013) and is also the only player to have been named as ‘World Bowling Writers’ bowler of the year three consecutive times. He is nicknamed "The Dominator".

For much of his PBA career, Barrett was sponsored by the Track division of Ebonite International. He is now a member of the Brunswick pro staff after Brunswick purchased Ebonite in late 2019. He is also sponsored by Turbo 2n1 grips and Dexter shoes.

Perfect Games

To date, Barrett has bowled 65 perfect 300 games in professional competition, including 18 on the PBA Tour.

After a convincing 279–201 semifinal match win over Shawn Maldonado, Barrett defeated top seed Kristopher Prather 210–189 in the final match. Barrett's ninth PBA title gave him a win in all three of the PBA Tour's original major championships, making him the eighth triple crown winner in PBA history.

All players were required to use identical low-technology Skill 3.02 bowling balls on two differently oiled lanes. After losing to Matt Ogle 193–150 in the first match of the race-to-two-points final, Barrett made a drastic move and won the second game 213–172.
