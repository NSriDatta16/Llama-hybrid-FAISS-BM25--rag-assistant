Linzer Stadion was a multi-purpose stadium, in Linz, Austria. Originally built in 1952, the stadium was last modified in 2012 and now has a capacity of 21,005. The 2012 modifications included the installation of rail seats for safe standing.

The stadium was opened on 28 July 1952, on the grounds of the former Froschberg-Brickworks. The stadium is also known as "Auf der Gugl", the name of the hill on which it is situated.

It was used for football matches and hosted most matches of FC Blau-Weiß Linz and the top matches of LASK Linz.

In July 2020, LASK presented their plans to build a new stadium on the site of the old stadium, with groundbreaking planned for early 2021 and completion scheduled for February 2023.
