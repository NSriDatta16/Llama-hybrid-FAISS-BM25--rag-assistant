Tread Lightly! is a nonprofit organization based in Centerville, Utah, whose mission is to promote responsible recreation through stewardship, education and communication.  It was started as a campaign to address impacts from off road vehicles by the United States Forest Service in 1985, and became a nonprofit in 1990.

Background
Tread Lightly and its partners lead a national initiative to protect and enhance recreation access and opportunities by promoting outdoor ethics to heighten individuals’ sense of good stewardship. The organization's goal is to balance the needs of people who enjoy outdoor recreation with the need to maintain a healthy environment through minimum impact education and on-the-ground public land stewardship.

Tread Lightly's core ethic revolves around five tenets of responsible recreation, called the T.R.E.A.D. Principles:

Travel Responsibly
Respect the Rights of Others
Educate Yourself
Avoid Sensitive Areas
Do Your Part
