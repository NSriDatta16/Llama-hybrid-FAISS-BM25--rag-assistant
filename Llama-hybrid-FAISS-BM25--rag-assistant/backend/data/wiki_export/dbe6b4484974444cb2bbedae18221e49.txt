Nepenthes argentii (; after George Argent) is a highland Nepenthes pitcher plant native to Mount Guiting-Guiting on Sibuyan Island in the Philippines. It is possibly the smallest species in the genus and does not appear to have a climbing stage.

Nepenthes argentii inhabits subalpine shrubbery "with a smooth wind-clipped canopy 30 cm tall on an ultrabasic ridge". It grows at an elevation of 1400–1900 m.

On Mount Guiting-Guiting, N. argentii is sympatric with N. sibuyanensis at around 1600 to 1770 m. A taxon resembling N. alata grows on Mount Guiting-Guiting at lower elevations of 800 to 1000 m; it was described as N. graciliflora by Adolph Daniel Edward Elmer. Other plant species endemic to the mountain include Lobelia proctorii and Rhododendron rousei.

Nepenthes argentii has no known natural hybrids, although it may hybridise with N. sibuyanensis. No forms or varieties have been described.
