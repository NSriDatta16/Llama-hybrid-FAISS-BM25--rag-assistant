When Young Terrorists Chase the Sun is the second studio album by Gerling, released in September 2001. Originally due to be released on 16 September was delayed due to the September 11 attacks and renamed in the UK and Japan under the title Headzcleaner. The album peaked at number 41 in Australia.

Cross later said, "with WYTCTS we didn't really care about how we were going to do it live, it was more this album of all these different songs that fit into each other and I think that was a really ambitious record, we don't regret anything about it."

At the ARIA Music Awards of 2002, Gerling and Magoo were nominated for Producer of the Year for their work on this album.
