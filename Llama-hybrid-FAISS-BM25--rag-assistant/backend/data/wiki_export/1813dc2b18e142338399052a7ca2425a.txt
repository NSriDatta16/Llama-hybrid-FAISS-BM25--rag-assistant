Fairfield College Preparatory School (Fairfield Prep) is a Jesuit preparatory school located on the campus of Fairfield University in Fairfield, Connecticut. It is an all-male school of about 800 students, founded by the Society of Jesus in 1942.

History
The bishop of Diocese of Bridgeport brought the Jesuits to the diocese in 1942 with the purchase of the adjoining estates of Jennings and Lashar off North Benson Road in Fairfield. The school began operations first; the university followed in 1947.  Prep was first accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges in 1945.

The prep campus proper is on the east-central side of the university and has its own sports field, while having use of university facilities for many activities. The three, conjoined Prep buildings occupy a hill overlooking Long Island Sound on the 200-acre campus it shares with the university.

Students come from 51 towns across Connecticut, with the majority of the students from Bridgeport, Trumbull, Stratford, Norwalk, and Fairfield. Ten percent are students of color. The tuition for the 2017–2018 school year was $19,800. Approximately 25% of Prep students share in more than $2.5 million (2017) in financial aid.

Program 
Peer tutors are provided to students from members of the National Honor Society.

Qualifying students are admitted to honors courses. Seventeen advanced placement (AP) courses are offered at Prep. Seniors who excel in math, science, and foreign languages are permitted to take courses next door at Fairfield University, at no additional tuition. Admission to the university library is also permitted to Prep students.

Prep has entered a program whereby (coed) students from Überlingen, Germany, spend two weeks in Spring with the family of a Prep student, attending classes at Prep, and the family is welcomed to visit the German student's home in June.

Prep activities include 50 clubs described on its website.

Service 
Freshmen conduct a field day for inner-city children and may choose to participate in an immersion experience among immigrant workers in Immokalee, Florida. In sophomore year students contribute 20 hours of service, with a variety of community needs to choose from. For juniors several options are offered requiring at least 30 hours of service. These include: a two-day "Urban Plunge" retreat living and working with the poor; an immersion experience in Immokalee, Appalachia, Jamaica, or Ecuador; and a trial experiences at a few sites where the student might perform his senior service hours. Seniors are required to be involved in service throughout the year and a year-long reflection class is conducted in connection with this service.
