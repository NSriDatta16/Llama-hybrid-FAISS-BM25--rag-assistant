The Wallington Public Schools is a comprehensive community public school district that serves students in pre-kindergarten through twelfth grade from Wallington, in Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey.

As of the 2021–22 school year, the district, comprised of three schools, had an enrollment of 1,243 students and 91.0 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 13.7:1.

The district is classified by the New Jersey Department of Education as being in District Factor Group "B", the second lowest of eight groupings. District Factor Groups organize districts statewide to allow comparison by common socioeconomic characteristics of the local districts. From lowest socioeconomic status to highest, the categories are A, B, CD, DE, FG, GH, I and J.

Starting in 2014, the district began discussions with the Carlstadt-East Rutherford Regional School District for a proposal in which the 350 Wallington students would be added to the 500 already attending Henry P. Becton Regional High School for grades 9–12. The consolidation would allow for Wallington High School to be reused for other purposes, avoiding the need to build a new high school building, and could allow for elimination of duplicate administrators.
