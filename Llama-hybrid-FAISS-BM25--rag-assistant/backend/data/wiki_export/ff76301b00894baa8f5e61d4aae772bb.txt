White Willow is a Norwegian art rock band, mixing elements of orchestral pop, 1970s progressive rock, jazz-rock and even electronic elements.

White Willow's influences range from 10cc, The Beach Boys, Big Star and Steely Dan to King Crimson, Magma, Weather Report and even Nick Drake and Joni Mitchell. Typical of their sound is the prominence of female vocals, flute and mellotrons and analog synthesizers.

Many guest artists have appeared on White Willow's albums. They include Norwegian singer/songwriter Finn Coren, British art-pop vocalist Tim Bowness, and US avant-rock guitarist Michael S. Judge.
