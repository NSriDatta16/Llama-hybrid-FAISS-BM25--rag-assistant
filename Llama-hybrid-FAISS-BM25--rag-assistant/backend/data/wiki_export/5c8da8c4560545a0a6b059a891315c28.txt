The British Ambassador to Germany is the United Kingdom's foremost diplomatic representative in the Federal Republic of Germany, and in charge of the UK's diplomatic mission in Germany.  The official title is His Britannic Majesty's Ambassador to the Federal Republic of Germany.

History
On German unification in 1871 the British Ambassador to the Kingdom of Prussia/North German Confederation in Berlin became the Ambassador to the new German Empire.  During the partition of Germany following World War II the Ambassador to the new Federal Republic (or West Germany) resided in Bonn, the capital, from 1952.  Berlin once more became the capital at reunification in 1990 and the Ambassador returned to Berlin in a new Embassy building, on the exact site of its predecessor in the Wilhelmstrasse, in 2000.
