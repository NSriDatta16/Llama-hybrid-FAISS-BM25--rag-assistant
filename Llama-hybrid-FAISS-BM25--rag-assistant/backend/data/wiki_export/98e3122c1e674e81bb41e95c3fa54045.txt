Allison Ann Higson (born March 13, 1973), later known by her married name Allison Cavanaugh, is a former 2-time Olympic breaststroke, individual medley, and freestyle swimmer from Canada. Born in Mississauga, Ontario, she grew up in Brampton, Ontario, a suburb of Toronto. She now lives in Traverse City, Michigan with her husband, Sean, and 2 children.

At the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, Scotland, Higson won gold medals in the women's 100-metre and 200-metre breaststroke, setting new Commonwealth Records in both. Later that summer at the 1986 World Championships in Madrid, Spain, Higson captured a bronze medal in the 200-metre breaststroke event.

At the 1988 Canadian Olympic Trials, in Montreal, Quebec, at the age of 15, Higson broke the women's 200-metre breaststroke World Record in a time of 2:27:27, previously held by Silke Hoerner of East Germany.

Higson also competed at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, in the preliminary heats of the 100-metre and 200-metre freestyle, and placed eighth in final of the women's 4x100-metre freestyle relay as a member of Canada's team.
