A curlicue, or alternatively curlycue, in the visual arts, is a fancy twist, or curl, composed usually from a series of concentric circles.  It is a recurring motif in architecture (as decoration to the lintel or architrave above a door), in calligraphy and in general scrollwork. The word can also refer to a specific kind of origami, made out of a single strip of paper that can be transformed in many geometric shapes.
