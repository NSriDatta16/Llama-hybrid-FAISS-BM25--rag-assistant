Plot
The Sooryavansham family head - Thakur Bhanu Pratap Singh is the sarpanch of the village of Bharatpur. The people of Bharatpur respect and revere him for his blue blood and virtuous ideologies. Bhanupratap has done yeoman's service not only for the people of Bharatpur but also for those of the 18 neighbouring villages in the district. The local police and administration also obey his orders in the matters of law.

Bhanupratap lives in a grand mansion with his wife Sharda, three sons, Karan, Varun and Heera and daughter Urmila. One of his sons is an engineer, one is a doctor, while Heera, the youngest one, lives like a servant in the house because of his illiteracy. Bhanupratap hates him to the core. Heera is not allowed to be involved in familial matters and performs menial activities like cleaning, washing, herding cattle, etc. Although despised by Bhanupratap and treated worse than animals, Heera has intense love and respect for his father, making him a person with intense Stockholm syndrome. Heera is only loved and cared for by Sharda and Heera's close friend Dharmendra/Mindra, one of the servants in the house.

Bhanupratap arranges the marriage of his daughter Urmila. A few days before the engagement ceremony, the groom comes to his house along with his uncle Ranjit Singh, a retired major, and sister Radha. Radha, a modern young woman, is unaware of Heera being Bhanupratap's son and makes Heera do various chores. On the day of the engagement, when Radha learns the truth from her father, she is shocked as well as touched. Subsequently, Radha develops an eagerness to know why Heera lives like a servant in his own house. Radha inquires Dharmendra about this. Dharmendra reveals Heera's past to Radha without Heera's consent.

During his childhood, although Heera attended school, Heera wasn't at all interested in studies and often failed his examinations. He used to go to school only to meet Gauri, the girl who was adopted by Bhanupratap after the demise of her parents. Gauri and Heera were more than just friends. One day at school, a teacher thrashed Gauri, causing Heera to discontinue his academic studies. Gauri, however, continued her studies. Bhanupratap thought that Heera's company would hamper Gauri's studies and sent her to a boarding school in the city. Being separated from Gauri, Heera cheered up when Gauri came on weekends, during which the two met each other. Soon, Heera and Gauri come of age. Bhanupratap planned Heera's marriage with Gauri. When Gauri learned about this, she attempted suicide but was timely rescued by Heera. Gauri told Heera that she would rather die than marry an illiterate man like him. She revealed that she loved Heera like a pet animal, and never intended to marry him. Bhanupratap, learning only half the truth, thinks Heera only had lust for Gauri, which made her leave in disgust. He was filled with more hatred for Heera than ever. Later, Gauri married another rich man while Heera continued to live a sad and miserable life. Radha, after listening to Heera's sad story, is overwhelmed with pity for Heera. On the day of Urmila's marriage, Radha proposes to Heera out of pity. Heera thinks that Radha is a loyal and virtuous woman and accepts her proposal of love.

Deshraj Thakur is another zamindar in Bharatpur who schemes to devastate his enemy Bhanupratap and his family by making Radha his daughter-in-law. If Radha is married to Deshraj's son Arjun, Radha's lawyer father will do whatever Deshraj wants. In this way, he will be able to get ahead of Bhanu Pratap. Radha's mother approves of the alliance and asks Bhanupratap to make Heera move out of Radha's life. Bhanupratap gives two choices to Heera: he can either be with Radha, or gain his father's love. Dharmendra convinces Heera to accept Radha as his wife, saying only a fortunate few find true love like Radha. On the day of Radha's marriage to Arjun, Heera takes Radha away with him and marries her. This enrages Bhanupratap and he disowns Heera.

Heera and Radha move into Dharmendra's house on the outskirts of the village and start a new chapter in their lives. Heera gets a job as a laborer in a transport company. When Radha learns that her husband has been toiling to make both ends meet, she encourages him to start his own business. With the money lent by Ranjit, Heera establishes a transport company under the name of his father. Surprisingly soon, Heera becomes a very rich businessman while Radha successfully completes her I.A.S. studies and is appointed the District Collector in her home district. A son is also born to the couple. Despite knowing that Heera and his family have moved up the social strata, Bhanupratap continues to hate them. Heera fulfills his father's dream of setting up a hospital for the poor. In the ceremony of the hospital's inauguration, Heera delivers a highly emotional speech, owing his success to his father, who, he believes, has expelled him from home so that he learns to fend for himself. Bhanupratap attends the ceremony, disguised as a poor man, and overhears this.

While Bhanupratap reconsiders his life decisions, he accidentally meets Heera and Radha's son. After confirming that the child is his grandson, Bhanupratap and the child become friends and spend secret moments with each other. When Heera learns about his, he asks his son about his new friend. The child ruins a photograph of Heera by drawing beard and moustache on it, claiming that his friend looks like this. Heera understands that his son is meeting Bhanupratap, because he and Heera looked exactly alike. Heera hands some Kheer over to his son and tells him to give it to his "friend" (Bhanupratap) when he meets him next, because Bhanupratap liked Kheer. Sharda also gets to know about it and urges her husband to accept Heera back into the family. Bhanupratap, suddenly hating himself for hating his son, rings Heera up. Before Bhanupratap speaks a word to Heera over the phone, he vomits blood and becomes critically ill. Bhanupratap is immediately hospitalised and Deshraj publicly holds Heera guilty of trying to kill his father with the poisoned Kheer, because of his expulsion from the family. When Deshraj and his henchmen assault Heera, Thakur Bhanupratap miraculously recovers, escape from the hospital, arrives for Heera's rescue and beats up the goons. Thakur Bhanupratap, before the crowd, lays bare the truth of the Kheer which was poisoned by Deshraj himself with artifice. Bhanupratap and Heera fight Deshraj and his henchmen until Deshraj confesses his guilt and begs pardon from Bhanupratap.

In the final scene, the kith and kin of Bhanupratap's family assemble in front of the family's grand mansion. Bhanupratap embraces Heera and the film ends.

Having studied Sanskrit, the actress added, she was quite comfortable with Hindi, and could read and write it. She also asked the viewers to be optimistic about the film, although the actress was a bit dubious about her role.
