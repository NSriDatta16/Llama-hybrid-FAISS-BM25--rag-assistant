"Town Called Malice" is a song recorded by British band the Jam from the album The Gift. It debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart in February 1982.

Overview
The title is a play on words of the 1950 Nevil Shute novel A Town Like Alice, although Paul Weller says he had not read the book at the time. It was a double A-side single release featuring "Precious" as the flip side. A 12" version was also available with a live version of "Town Called Malice" backed by an extended version of "Precious".

Paul Weller has said that "Town Called Malice" was written about his hometown of Woking, inspired by his working-class upbringing there and desire to leave. The Irish Independent described the song, like "Going Underground", as a "class-war tirade set to a post-punk northern soul groove". Greg Freeman of The Guardian described it as featuring a "stomping, Motown-inspired beat" conveying a "sense of pent-up rage and frustrated ambition".

Released as the first single from the album on 29 January 1982, it entered the UK Singles Chart at number one and stayed at there for three weeks, preventing "Golden Brown" by the Stranglers from reaching the top spot. EMI, the Stranglers' label, objected to the sales of both versions of "Town Called Malice" being aggregated, arguing that Jam fans were buying both and thus preventing "Golden Brown" from reaching number one.

"Town Called Malice" was the Jam's third number-one single in the UK. It was the band's sole entry on any mainstream American chart when it hit No. 31 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in 1982. The song was ranked among the top ten "Tracks of the Year" for 1982 by NME.
