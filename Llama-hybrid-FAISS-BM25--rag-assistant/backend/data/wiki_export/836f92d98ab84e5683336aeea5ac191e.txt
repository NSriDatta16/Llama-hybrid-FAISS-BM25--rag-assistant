History
The Golf school district is named after the original Golf School, and the Village of Golf that the school originally served. The first Golf School was a prototypical "one room country schoolhouse" that was little more than a wooden shed with windows. It had no electricity or indoor plumbing. The single room was expanded to four, then replaced by a Works Progress Administration-built concrete and masonry structure capable of serving hundreds of students.

During its time, the original Golf School was very much a rural institution, and presumably the only public-funded institute of primary/secondary education in its area at that time. The baby boom after World War II saw the landscape being converted from rural to suburban, and a sudden population growth. The Village of Golf was content to remain a hamlet, but the municipalities that surrounded it, Glenview, Morton Grove and Niles, expanded rapidly, consuming all unincorporated land. The prairie, forests and farmland that remained was rapidly developed for housing and shopping.

Hynes Elementary School joined the district in 1957, filling the distance between Golf School and Morton Grove School. In 1961, Golf Junior High School was built on the west side of the Golf School campus (the Golf School building was set back to the northeast corner of the parcel), and Golf School became Golf Elementary School. Shortly thereafter the Golf Junior High School building was expanded with modern, air-conditioned classrooms in the new wing. Golf Junior High School took students from Golf Elementary and Hynes Elementary schools, and sent graduates on to Niles North High School for secondary education.

By 1975 the baby boom population growth of students had turned into a population decline, and downsizing plans were enacted. The c. 1934 Golf Elementary School building was scheduled for demolition with no replacement. Hynes Elementary School became the only elementary school for the district, and Golf Junior High School (grades 6-8) became the 4-year Golf Middle School, accepting grades 5 through 8. The Village of Golf, after which the district was named, decided to send its children to public schools in Glenview.

Before the end of the 20th century the last working farm in District 67, Delaine Farm, had been converted into a housing development. In less than 70 years the demographics of District 67 have changed radically from rural and agrarian to suburban and professional.
