For centuries, Hacıbektaş has served as the international headquarters of the Bektashi Order until Atatürk outlawed all dervish orders in 1925. In 1930, the Bektashi Order officially set up its new headquarters in Tirana, Albania.

Notable residents
Haji Bektash Veli, the founder of the Bektashi order, lived in the area in the 14th century and is commemorated by the town's current name and in an annual festival. His tomb known as the Hajibektash complex is located near the center of town in his former monastery, now a museum, and is a site of pilgrimage for Alevi and Bektashi from throughout Turkey and the world.
