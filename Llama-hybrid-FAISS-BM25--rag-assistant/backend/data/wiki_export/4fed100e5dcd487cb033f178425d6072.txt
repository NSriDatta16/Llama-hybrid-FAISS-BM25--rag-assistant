Marcel Siem (born 15 July 1980) is a German professional golfer who plays on the European Tour where he has five victories. In 2006 he won the World Cup paired with Bernhard Langer.

Career
Siem was born in Mettmann. He turned professional in 2000 and came through Qualifying School to join the European Tour in 2002. He was again successful at Qualifying School in 2002.  His first win on the European Tour came at the 2004 Dunhill Championship. Siem then had to wait eight years before picking up his second win in 2012 at the Alstom Open de France. This victory ensured Siem's place in the 2012 Open Championship and his first appearance in a World Golf Championship at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational. His best year end ranking on the Order of Merit was 14th in 2012.

In March 2013, Siem won for the third time on the European Tour at the Trophée Hassan II in Morocco. He went wire-to-wire to win by three strokes over David Horsey and Mikko Ilonen. He finished the tournament 51st in the world rankings, just missing out on an invitation to the Masters Tournament.

In November 2014, Siem claimed victory at the BMW Masters, the first event of the Race to Dubai finals series and his fourth overall on the European Tour. He won in a sudden death playoff over Ross Fisher and Alexander Lévy with a birdie on the first extra hole. He ended the season 7th in the Race to Dubai season rankings.

Siem played on the Challenge Tour in 2021. He won the Le Vaudreuil Golf Challenge in July.

At the end of 2022 Siem relocated to Mauritius and experienced a resurgence of form. In February 2023, he ended an eight-year winless drought at the Hero Indian Open in his 501st European Tour start. He shot a final-round 68 to beat Yannik Paul by one shot. In June, he was runner-up at the Porsche European Open in Hamburg, two shots behind Tom McKibbin.

Siem has represented Germany at the World Cup in 2003, 2004, and 2006. In 2006 he was Bernhard Langer's teammate in the second winning German team in the World Cup.
