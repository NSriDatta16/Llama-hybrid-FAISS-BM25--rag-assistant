A pipkin is an earthenware  cooking pot used for cooking over direct heat from coals or a wood fire. They were not held in direct flame which would crack the ceramic. It has a handle and many (though not all) examples had three feet. Late medieval and post-medieval pipkins had a hollow handle into which a stick might be inserted for manipulation. Examples exist unglazed, fully glazed, and glazed only on the interior.

While often spheroidal, they were made with straight outwardly-sloping sides. They were occasionally made with lids or pouring spouts.

Heraldry 
The pipkin, also called a three-legged pot (marmite (fr.),  Grapen (ger.)), is sometimes used as a charge in heraldry. It is especially common in arms in Brandenburg, Pomerania and East Prussia.

It is used in the canting arms for the German families von Grape, Grapengie√üer and Grappendorf, and Groppe von Gudenberg.
