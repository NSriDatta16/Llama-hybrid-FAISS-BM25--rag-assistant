"Dark & Long" is a song by British electronic music group Underworld and the opening track on their third studio album, dubnobasswithmyheadman (1994). The band released a number of versions of the track, including the "Dark Train" mix made popular for inclusion on the hit soundtrack album for the 1996 film Trainspotting, and the 2021 "Drift 2 Dark Train" mix.

Background 
The single entered the UK Singles Chart at number 57 on 25 June 1994 for one week.

The "Dark Train" mix of "Dark & Long" became best known due to its use in the 1996 film Trainspotting (that featured another Underworld track, "Born Slippy (.Nuxx))." "Dark & Long (Dark Train)" appears in a scene of when the main character Mark Renton is going through heroin withdrawal.

"Dark & Long (Dark Train)", as well as the "Darren Price and High Contrast Remix", both appeared during the athletes' march at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics and on its soundtrack album Isles of Wonder.
