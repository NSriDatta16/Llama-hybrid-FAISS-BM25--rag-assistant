The Forty-Fours are a group of islands in the Chatham Archipelago, about  east of the main Chatham Island.  They are called Motchuhar in Moriori and Motuhara in MƒÅori.  The group includes the easternmost point of New Zealand, whose South Island is located about  to the west.

The region is one of only two breeding sites for the Chatham fulmar prion.  It has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International due to it also supporting colonies of Buller's and northern royal albatrosses.
