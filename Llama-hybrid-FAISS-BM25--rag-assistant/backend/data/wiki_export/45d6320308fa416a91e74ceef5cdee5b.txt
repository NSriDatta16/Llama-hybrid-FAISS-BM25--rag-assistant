The Drums from "No Flashlight" by Mt. Eerie

Reception

"No Flashlight": Songs of the Fulfilled Night received generally positive reviews upon release. Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from music critics, the album has received an average score of 72 based on 5 critics, indicating "generally favourable reviews". In a positive review Dom Sinacola of CokeMachineGlow wrote that "No Flashlight doesn’t sound much like a lullaby worth revisiting each night. Amazingly, Mount Eerie still crafts a series of passages that breathes, and walks, and enjoys a generous restraint." Zac Pennington and Adam Gnade of Portland Mercury wrote that "After releasing three consecutive records of masterfully progressive conceptual vision, Elverum's latest (as its title suggests) seems to be more about a search for something than a destination", "And though at times frustrating, it's the questions that keep me consistently coming back to No Flashlight. So Phil: what does Mount Eerie mean, anyway?"

In a review by Tiny Mix Tapes wrote that "Phil is obviously trying to communicate a particular message with little abstraction. He's taking this opportunity to share with us something special to him, and he's doing so in the most honest way he can." Elizabeth Newton of The Quietus praised the album writing that "Fluctuations in Elverum's persona, self-consciously sullen and wrung from second thoughts, ultimately add up to a stable whole because his tone remains so thoroughly distinctive" and that "Now more than ever, this music is laced with its maker's insistent worldview at every turn, and it's better for it."

A mixed review by Stylus wrote that "because Elvrum’s philosophy is a rather muddled one (even with a surfeit explanation bordering on the absurd), it tends to take away from the album at key moments. Musical highlights like the beautifully hummed “How?” are weighed down by Elvrum's insistence on calling the visible world “the romance” or the unfortunate lyric “Because the pupil of my eye is a hole / There’s no Inside and there’s no Out / The world is in me and I am in the world” from the shimmering “No Inside, No Out.”"

In a negative review, Sam Ubl of Pitchfork said that "Demanding listener input-- as Elverum does here by not-so-subtly inviting us to ponder him-- isn't a bad thing. But courting ears with such esoteric hooey is disingenuous and annoying" and that "he now makes boring music that is premised on his persona and the explanation thereof."

Legacy 
Eric Hill of Exclaim! Included the album in a ranking of Elverum's "essential" albums.
