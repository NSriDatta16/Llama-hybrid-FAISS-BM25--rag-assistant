The Signature Tower was being developed by Giarratana LLC at an estimated cost of US$250 to 370 million.  The building's physical address would have been 505 Church Street, on the southwest corner of Church and Fifth Avenue North, which was for many years the location of a Cain-Sloan department store. Giarratana announced on July 18, 2006 that it had slated Turner Construction Co. of New York to complete the project.

Construction of the building was slated to begin once half of the 400 residential apartment units had been sold. By late December 2007, 102 of the 400 units had been presold. When the plan was overhauled in December 2008, this timetable was revoked.

The official website for Signature Tower was taken offline around December 2009. In November 2011, Giarratana announced that he was going to use the site to build a smaller, mixed use tower called 505 CST, which was eventually redeveloped into a residential tower called 505.
