Five for Hell (, also known as Five Into Hell) is a 1969 Italian "macaroni combat" war film starring John Garko, Margaret Lee and Klaus Kinski. Italian cinema specialist Howard Hughes referred to it as a derivative of The Dirty Dozen (1967).

Summary
Gianni Garko is a fun-loving leader of a bunch of oddball G.I.s whose mission is to steal the German's secret attack plans from a villa behind enemy lines, where they run into a brutal Nazi commander.

This film introduced, as it was typical in spaghetti combat films, a very particular and self parodic humour, using also elements inherited directly from the Spaghetti Western, such as the hero using eccentric and odd weaponry, such as an iron baseball.
