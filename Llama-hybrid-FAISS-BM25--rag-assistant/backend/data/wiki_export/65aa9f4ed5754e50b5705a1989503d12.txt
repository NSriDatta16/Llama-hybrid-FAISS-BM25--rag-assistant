Glow is the third album by the American folk rock band the Innocence Mission, released in 1995 on A&M Records. Musically, it marked a radical departure for the group, as the Sundays/10,000 Maniacs-inspired dream pop aesthetic found on their first two albums was replaced by a more straightforward, cleaner rock sound. The album was recorded over a several-month period at Kingsway Studios, New Orleans, Louisiana and Bad Animals Studios, Seattle, Washington. It was the band's final major label release.
