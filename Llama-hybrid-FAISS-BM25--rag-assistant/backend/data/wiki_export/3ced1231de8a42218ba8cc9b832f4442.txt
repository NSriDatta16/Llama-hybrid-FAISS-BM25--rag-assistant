Guhyeong of Geumgwan Gaya, also often Guhae (r. 521–532) was the tenth and final ruler of Geumgwan Gaya, a Gaya state of ancient Korea.  He was the son of King Gyeomji and Queen Suk.

Faced with an onslaught of Silla forces under King Beopheung, King Guhyeong chose to surrender freely, and brought his family and his treasures to Silla.  He was received with ceremony and his family were admitted to the second-highest rank of the Silla bone rank system, the "true bone."  The king was given the rank of Sangdaedeung, and permitted to keep his former territory as sigeup stipend land.  According to the Samguk Yusa, this occurred either 520 or 490 years after the kingdom's legendary founding by King Suro.
