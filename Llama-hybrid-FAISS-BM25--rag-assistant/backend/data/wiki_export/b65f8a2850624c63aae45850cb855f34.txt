History
An earlier name for the town was Macon. The newer name Trilby was in use by 1895, although the Macon post office was not renamed Trilby until 1901. Railroad magnate Henry Plant changed the name of the town because it duplicated the name of Macon, Georgia. He has been quoted as saying he wished to name it "after the heroine of a story which has lately deeply moved me", referring to George du Maurier's novel of the same name. Trilby was incorporated by the state legislature as a town on May 23, 1901, but was disincorporated on May 11, 1909. The town was again incorporated by the state legislature in 1913 but was disincorporated for a second time on April 24, 1935. Because of the loss of its railroad industry, it has declined into a residential community for Dade City, and also for the Tampa Bay region.
