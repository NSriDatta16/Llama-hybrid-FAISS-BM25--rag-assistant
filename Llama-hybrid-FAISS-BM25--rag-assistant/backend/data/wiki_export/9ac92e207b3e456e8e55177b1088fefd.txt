Bob Hoag is an American record producer, songwriter and musician based in Mesa, Arizona. In 2005, he was recruited to be the pianist and keyboardist for American rock band The Ataris.

Career
Hoag wrote songs for his group, The Go Reflex, as well as his previous group, Pollen.  His main band, The Go Reflex, includes Kevin Scanlon from the now defunct band, Pollen (Hoag played the drums and wrote the songs).  In The Go Reflex, Hoag once again writes the songs but also sings and plays piano as well as drums.  He also played drums and recorded records for the power-pop/garage group The Breakup Society, as well as The Love Me Nots.  He currently runs Flying Blanket Recording in Mesa, Arizona where he has produced and recorded many musicians who have led successful careers.

Hoag generally contributes musically to most of the records he produces as well and can be heard singing, playing piano/keyboards, and doing various percussion on most of those releases.  The Go Reflex has not been active since Kevin Scanlon moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in photography in 2004.  There were two shows in late 2004, featuring a heavily expanded line-up but the group would not play again until the summer of 2006 (a benefit show), which was done with the band's original line-up.  There was also a show in summer 2007 with a heavily expanded and different line-up but still featuring Scanlon on guitar.  Hoag has cited his busy recording schedule as the main reason behind the group's recent inactivity and continuously claims that the band will one day become active again.

He is married and has two children.
