Lützelflüh is a municipality in the administrative district of Emmental in the Swiss canton of Bern.

History

Lützelflüh is first mentioned in 1225 as Lucelfluo.

The area around Lützelflüh was probably inhabited during the Roman era.  However, only a single hoard of coins has been discovered, near the ruins of Brandis Castle.  By the High Middle Ages Lützelflüh and the surrounding area were home to several earthen strongholds, a weir in the river valley and Brandis Castle, built around 1230.  The Freiherr von Lützelflüh helped found Trub Abbey in 1125-1130, but nothing is known about the family's origin or the extent of their lands.  The town of Lützelflüh developed out of this barons' seat. In 1230 the Freiherr of Brandis took the place of those of Lützelflüh and built themselves a castle between Lützelflüh and Rüegsau.

In 1450, the Brandis' castle was sold to the nobility of Bern. It was then sold and inherited several times until it ended up in the hand of the city of Bern in 1607. The town then became a bailiwick of Bern. The last bailiff was Franz Ludwig May.

On 14 April 1798, the castle burnt down and this was the end of the bailiwick of Brandis. The municipality Lützelflüh became part of the district Trachselwald.

In 1881 the Emmental railroad was built through the village, encouraging industry to settle in the municipality.  A few years later, in 1886, the Emme river correction project reduced the risk of floods, built a major road through the valley and opened up additional farmland in Lützelflüh.  The railroad and new Emmental road helped transform the village into a local industrial center.  In 1898 an oat and barley mill opened, followed by metal and flooring factories as well as several cheese exporting firms.  A civil defense training center also opened in the municipality.

In 1831 the famous Swiss novelist Albert Bitzius, better known as Jeremias Gotthelf, settled in Lützelflüh as an assistant pastor.  He later became the parish priest and spent the remainder of his life in the municipality.  Bitzius is buried in the local cemetery and a small Gotthelf museum opened in the village.

In 1879 Lützelflüh and Goldbach built a secondary school.
