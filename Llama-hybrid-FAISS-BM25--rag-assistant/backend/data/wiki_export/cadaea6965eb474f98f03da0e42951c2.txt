Tripolis () or Tripolis Larisaia (), also called Scaea (), was an ancient city in the Pelasgiotis in Thessaly, Greece, on the Peneus (Peneios) river, situated approximately 5 km to the east of Larissa.

During the Third Macedonian War, the Romans under Publius Licinius camped here on the march to Larissa (171 BCE).

Its site is tentatively located near Platykampos.
