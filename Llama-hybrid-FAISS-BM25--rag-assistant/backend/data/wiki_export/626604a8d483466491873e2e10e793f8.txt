Our Lady of Mercy School for Young Women is a private all-girls Catholic school teaching grades 6–12, located in Brighton, Monroe County, New York, United States, near Rochester.  It is located within the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rochester.

The American Sisters of Mercy founded Our Lady of Mercy High School in Rochester in 1928, based in the tradition of the Roman Catholic sisterhood begun by Catherine McAuley, founder of the Sisters of Mercy. The building was built in 1928, and designed by noted Rochester architect J. Foster Warner (1859–1937).  It educated young women in grades 9-12 for the first six decades of its operation, branching out to include grades 7 and 8 in 1990. In September 2012, Our Lady of Mercy High School expanded to include grade 6. To reflect this change, its name was changed to Our Lady of Mercy School for Young Women.

Traditions
Mercy has been a part of the Rochester community for nearly 100 years. During that time, the school has developed many traditions, some dating to the earliest days of Mercy's establishment.

 Spirit Week  - Each fall, classes participate in weeklong competitions that culminate on Spirit Day. On this day, students dress in their class colors and compete in relay races, pie-eating contests, class dances, and other festivities. 
 Spirit Gala - Spirit Gala is the school's signature fundraising event attended each fall by hundreds of alumnae, donors, friends, and faculty. Over the years, the Gala has raised millions of dollars in support of the school's academic programs. 
 Golden Mass - In December, homerooms “adopt” a local family in need and provide them with Christmas baskets containing gifts and food. Following a beautiful liturgy, during which the Christmas baskets displayed behind the altar are blessed, students and families deliver the items to the families. 
 Mission Month - In March, students raise money for local, national, and international charities through school-wide fundraisers. 
 Arts Fest - Typically held in the spring, Arts Fest gives students a chance to showcase their talents during a day of performances. Additional activities include a concert from a local professional group and hour-long workshops taught by teachers and other professionals. 
 Father-Daughter Dinner Dance - In May, many girls and their fathers attend the Father-Daughter Dinner Dance. John C. Hayes P’98, ‘01, ‘06, ‘10, ‘12, ‘16, ‘19, holds the record for most Father-Daughter Dinner Dances attended.
 Junior Ring Ceremony - In May, juniors receive their class rings, inscribed with the school crest (a cross encircled by the Latin motto “Via, Veritas et Vita,” meaning the Way, the Truth, and the Life”) and a shank on both sides featuring a rising sun with the open Bible among the rays. The rings, blessed at the Mass, are a sign of their Mercy journey and the oneness they share with the thousands of alumnae who also wear it. Students traditionally “turn” each other's rings at the reception following the ceremony. 
 May Day - In honor of Mary, the mother of Jesus, Mercy observes a traditional May Day celebration, which dates back to the beginnings of the school. A senior is elected May Queen and has a court of peer-elected juniors and seniors who help organize the ceremony. Following the Mass, the Blessed Mother's crowning takes place in the Grotto on the school grounds.
 Moving Up Day - The academic school year ends in June with Moving Up Day where classes gather in the Auditorium to provide advice to the classes below them. Following each presentation, classes “move up” rows and the seniors join hands and walk to the stage to sing the Alma Mater for the last time in the Auditorium. 
 Rose Mass - The evening before commencement, Mercy seniors celebrate Rose Mass in the Motherhouse Chapel. Joined by faculty and staff, this beloved tradition is the last opportunity for seniors and their teachers to gather as a Mercy family to say goodbye. Each student carries a rose into Mass that is blessed and given back to them the next day at graduation. 
 Retreats - Each grade participates in an annual class retreat. Freshman retreat is held in school, while sophomore and junior retreats are daylong events held off campus. Senior retreat is an overnight at Camp Stella Maris and is one of the last times the senior class gathers together.

Extracurriculars
Mercy offers many extracurriculars, including nearly 50 clubs that have been invited to compete regionally, nationally, and internationally.
