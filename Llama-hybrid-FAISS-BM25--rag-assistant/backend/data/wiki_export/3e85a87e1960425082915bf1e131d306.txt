Soon after, she formed Miss Alex White and the Red Orchestra.

Both albums were released on In the Red Records.

With White Mystery
White founded her current group, White Mystery, with her brother Francis on April 20, 2008, named after an Airheads flavor. White Mystery is known for their relentless tour schedule in which White claims to have played 1,000 shows in the band’s first ten years. The group has played with national acts such as Garbage, Shonen Knife, The Stooges and Weezer. They played on a parade float with Sir Richard Branson for the grand opening of Virgin Hotels Chicago. The group has released nine full-length albums as of 2018.

On April 1, 2016, White Mystery premiered "Best Friend" on the NBC Carson Daly Show, “Last Call” and announced forthcoming record Outta Control which is titled in reference to the same Airheads flavor from which the band name is derived. They described it in an interview with Transverso Media as their "pop masterpiece."

Equipment
White’s signature guitar is her Fireglo Rickenbacker 330, a guitar that she has mainly used for all of her projects. She is also sponsored by Orange Amplifiers.

In 2014 White Mystery was featured in an expansive Levi’s ad campaign, with their images being used in such magazines as Rolling Stone, SPIN, and Pitchfork.

Influences
White cites her biggest influences as The MC5, Marc Bolan of T. Rex, Tina Turner, and Poison Ivy of the Cramps respectively. On White Mystery's website, Miss Alex White's band, she lists Roger Daltrey from the Who, Cheetah Chrome from the Dead Boys, Arthur “Killer” Kane from the New York Dolls, Brian Jones of The Rolling Stones, and Led Zeppelin as alternative influences.
