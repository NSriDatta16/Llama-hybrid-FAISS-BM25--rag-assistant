The Telugu Chodas or Telugu Cholas ruled parts of present-day Andhra Pradesh and Telangana between the 6th and the 13th centuries as samantas of Pallavas and later the Cholas. Various dynasties exist among them including Velanati, Pottapi, Konidena, Nannuru, Nellore, Kunduru etc. The earliest Choda dynasty in the Telugu area was that of Renati Chodas who ruled Renadu region in the 6th and 7th centuries. Some of the Telugu Chodas including Renati Chodas claimed descent from the early Sangam Chola king Karikala Chola.Telugu Chodas contributed much to the early development of Telugu language and are the first dynasty to use Telugu as their official language. The first and oldest Telugu inscription founded so far is Kalamalla inscription dating to 575 CE put up by Renati Chola king Erikal Mutturaju Dhanunjaya. Telugu Chodas are believed to have been migrated from Tamilakam to Andhra country due to invasion of Tamilakam by Kalabhras and increasing power of Pallavas in northern most part of Tamilakam.

Velanati Chodas

Telugu Chodas of Velanadu (Velanati Chola) were one of the Telugu Choda families. Velanadu is located in the modern Guntur district. The chieftains who ruled over Velanadu came to be known as the Velanati Chodas. One of them, Rajendra Choda II had even assumed the title Durjayakulaprakara since Velanati Chodas claims descendant from Durjaya, a descendant of Karikala Chola . These Velanati chiefs were the subordinate allies of the Later Cholas of the south. They were entrusted with the responsibility of the governance of the Andhra region, which formed a part of the Chola kingdom in the between the tenth and early decades of the thirteenth century. Their capital was Dhanadapura (Dhannada) or Sanaduprolu, the modern Chandolu in the Guntur district initially then later they ruled from Vengi in West Godavari and Pithpuram in East Godavari Districts. Dhannada is also the site of the war between the Cholas and the Later Chalukyas when the Western Chalukya king Satyashraya invaded the Eastern Chalukyas, which was swiftly repulsed by the forces of Rajendra Chola I who helped the Eastern Chalukyas and the Velanadu Chodas with whom the Cholas had marital ties.

The Velanati Chiefs rose to prominence among the vassals of the Chalukyas of Vengi during the early days of Kulothunga Chola I and served as the Later  viceroys faithfully as their trusted lieutenants and generals. Finding his dominion dwindling, due to the ascendancy of the Kalyani Chalukyas in the Vengi country, Kulothunga Chola lent support to his loyal chieftains of Velanadu to bring the situation under control and rule over Vengi as his vassals. Evidence is available to the effect that five chieftains of Velanadu ruled over the country after which it was overrun by the Kakatiyas and became a part of their kingdom.

Velanati Chodas:

 Gonka I (1076–1108 )
 Rajendra Choda I  (1108–1132 )
 Gonka II (1132–1161 )
 Rajendra Choda II (1161–1181 )
 Gonka III (1181–1186 )
 Pruthviswara (1186–1207 )

Renati Chodas

The Telugu Chodas of Renadu (also called as Renati Cholas) ruled over Renadu region, the present day Kadapa district. In Malepadu plates (seventh century), Renati Chola king Punyakumara stated that they belong to the family of Sangam age Chola king Karikala Chola. They were originally independent, later forced to the suzerainty of the Eastern Chalukyas. They used the Telugu language in their inscriptions of the sixth and eighth centuries. Such inscriptions have found near Muddanur, and at Gandikota, Jammalamadugu and Proddatur. The earliest of this family was Nandivarman (500 AD) who claimed descent from the family of Karikala and the Kasyapa gotra. He had three sons Simhavishnu, Sundarananda and Dhananjaya, all of whom were ruling different territories simultaneously. The family seems to have had its origin in Erigal in the Tunmkur district, situated in the border between Pallava and Kadamba regions. Dhananjaya is described as Erigal-mutturaju and as ruling Renadu. In the first half of the seventh century, we find Punyakumara, a descendant of Nandivarman, ruling over Renadu and Hiranyarashtra. He too bears the title Erikal-mutturaju.

Pottapi Chodas

Telugu Chodas of Pottapi ruled the Cuddapah region after the fall of the Renati Chodas. Their inscriptions from 11th century are found in this area.  It is also believed that they ruled over Chittoor district, since Dhurjati of Kalahasti mentioned that he was from Pottapi region. Now Pottapi is a GramPanchayat of Nandalur mandal of Kadapa district. According to Anbil plates of Parantaka Chola II, the founder of Medieval Chola empire Vijayalaya Chola's predecessor is a Telugu Choda king Srikantha Choladhiraja who was ruling Renadu region and belongs to Pottapi Choda lineage and is a descendant of Tamil king Karikala Chola. During the reign of Vikrama Chola, there was a feudatory called Madhurantaka Pottapi Chola who was the son of Siddharasa. The officer claimed descent from Karikala in epigraphs (carana saroruha etc.).

Konidena Chodas

The Konidena Chodas were also a branch of the Renadu Chodas. Their capital was Konidena (also called as Kotyadona) near Narasaraopeta in the Guntur district. They ruled over parts of Palanadu in 11th and 12th centuries. Early kings Kannara Choda and Kama Choda were independent. Tribhuvana Malla Choda, son of Kama Choda, was a chieftain to Gonka II of Velanati Chodas. Nanni Choda, son of Tribhuvana Malla Choda declared independence again, but was soon defeated and forced to be vassals again by Gonka II. After the fall of Velanadu Chodas, they were forced to suzerainty by Ganapatideva of Kakatiyas.

Nannuru Chodas

Nannuru Chodas were another branch of Telugu Chodas in the region of Pakanadu. The famous Telugu poet Kaviraja Sikhamani Nanne Choda belonged to this family. Not much is known of this clan and it is believed to have been a subordinate of Vikramaditya VI of Kalyani Chalukyas.

Nellore Chodas

Nellore Chodas are Telugu Chodas who ruled from the city of Nellore in Andhra Pradesh and claimed descent from Karikala Chola.

Kunduru Chodas
