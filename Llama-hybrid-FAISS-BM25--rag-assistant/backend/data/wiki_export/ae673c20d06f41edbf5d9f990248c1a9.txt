Biography 
Vincent was born in 1928 in Calicut, then part of Madras Presidency.
He was trained under cinematographer Kamal Ghosh and was initially associated with Gemini Studios. He started his career in Tamil cinema and shot to fame with the Sivaji Ganesan-starrer Uthamaputhiran. Vincent teamed up with C. V. Sridhar in masterpieces such as Kalyana Parisu, Nenjil Or Aalayam, Kaadhalikka Neramillai, Sumaithaangi and Then Nilavu. He then became a freelancer and achieved success in Malayalam and Telugu films. He established himself as one of the leading cinematographers in South India and also earned a name in Hindi films. At a time when cinematography was in its infancy in Indian cinema, he experimented with camera angles and placements. He succeeded in bringing in the kind of visuals that were not seen before in South Indian films.
In 2003, the Indian Society of Cinematographers (ISC) awarded him an Honorary Membership, along with K. K. Mahajan and V. K. Murthy.

Vincent has directed around 30 films, mostly in Malayalam. The first Malayalam film he directed, Bhargavi Nilayam (1964), was scripted by renowned writer Vaikom Muhammad Basheer. It is considered one of the all time classics in Malayalam cinema and the soundtrack to this film was also a notable success. Few directors could claim such an impressive list of chart-toppers and some of the Malayalam feature films directed by Vincent are Murappennu, Nadhi, Gandharvakshethram, Thulabharam, Aswamedham, Achani, Anaavaranam, Aalmaram, Thriveni, Nagarame Nandi, Abhijathyam, Asuravithu, Kochu Themmadi, Nizhalattam, Chenda, Sreekrishna Parunthu, Priyamulla Sophia, Nakhangal and Theerthayathra.
Vincent died on 25 February 2015 at the age of 86. His sons Jayanan Vincent and Ajayan Vincent are also cinematographers
