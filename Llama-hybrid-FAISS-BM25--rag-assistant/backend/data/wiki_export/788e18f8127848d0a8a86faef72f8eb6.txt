Live Bootleg '82 is the title of a live album by rock band Daniel Amos, released on Stunt Records in 1990.

Recorded in St. Louis, Missouri by Bruce A. Brown in April, 1982, this album gave fans a glimpse into a typical D.A. concert in the early 1980s. Having gone in a harder rock/new-wave direction, they abandoned the country-rock songs of their first two albums. This set (as seen on the "Uncut" edition) culled three songs from Horrendous Disc and nine from ¡Alarma!, both released the previous year, along with three songs from Doppelgänger which would not be released for a year and three songs never released on an album.

The album also includes their well-known "Surf Suite", which they had performed in differing fashions for several years. It led off with a new-wave take on The Beach Boys' "Surfin' U.S.A.", the instrumental surf classic "Wipe Out", followed by D.A.'s own surfing-inspired songs "Endless Summer" and "(Near Sighted Girl with Approaching) Tidal Wave".
