Banjos banjos, the banjofish, is a species of marine ray-finned fish from the family Banjosidae. This was formerly considered to be a monotypic family of which the banjofish was the only species. However, in 2017, two new species of banjofish were described, the East Australian banjofish (B. aculeatus) and the Timor Sea banjofish (B. peregrinus). It has an Indo-Pacific distribution.

Taxonomy
Banjos banjos was first formally described as Anoplus banjos in 1846 by Scottish naval surgeon, naturalist and arctic explorer Sir John Richardson (1797â€“1865) with the type locality given as  the Sea of Japan. B. banjos was previously considered to be the only species in the family Banjosidae but in 2017 Matsunuma & Motomura described two new species, the East Australian banjofish (Banjos acuteatus) and the Timor Sea banjofish (Banjos peregrinus) and a new subspecies of B. banjos (see below).

There are two recognised subspecies of Banjos banjos:

 Banjos banjos banjos (Richardson, 1846) - the nominate subspecies from the western Pacific
 Banjos banjos brevispinis Matsunuma & Motomura, 2017 - from the Indian Ocean, called the Western Australian banjofish.
