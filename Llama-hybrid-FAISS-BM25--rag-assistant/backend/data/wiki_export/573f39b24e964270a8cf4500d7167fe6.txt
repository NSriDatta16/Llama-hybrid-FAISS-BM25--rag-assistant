In 1975 he commanded the Boeing 707 aircraft used for the Royal Tour to the Far East which Her Majesty the Queen undertook and a year later he transferred to the Concorde Fleet. In 1977, he commanded the Concorde which flew the Queen from Barbados to London and the first supersonic commercial service from London to New York City. His achievements were recognised in 1978 when he was awarded the Britannia Trophy, presented by HRH Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales (now King Charles III), for his work on the launch of the Concorde New York service.

In 1982 he became the General Manager of the Concorde Division at BA and was responsible for all aspects of British Airways Concorde operations, from marketing and advertising to control of the fleet's day-to-day operations.

In 1988 he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in The Queen's Birthday Honours List.
