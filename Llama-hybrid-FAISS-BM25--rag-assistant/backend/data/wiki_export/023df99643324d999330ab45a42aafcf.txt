Maple Leaf Intermediate
The only intermediate school in Garfield, it is located at the corner of Mapleleaf Drive and Turney, servicing grades 4 and 5 under Principal Thomas Matthews (former Principal of William Foster.)

Maple Leaf Intermediate School was built in 1925 with additions added between 1949–1952. In the 1978-79 school year, The Garfield Hts City Schools closed Maple Leaf School. In 1952, the newly founded Roman Catholic Saint Monica's Church used Maple Leaf School for Sunday masses, in 1954 St. Monica's opened its school/church combination, so Maple Leaf wasn't needed anymore. From 1981–92, Maple Leaf School served as the Garfield Hts Senior Center and Historical Society museum. In 1992, The Senior Center moved to the new City Hall Complex. In 1993, The Historical Society moved to a home on Turney Road. From 1993–1996 Maple Leaf School became an alternative school for troubled children.

In the 1996 school year, citing overcrowding in the districts two primary schools-William Foster and Elmwood, the Garfield Hts City School board voted to reopen Maple Leaf School as an Intermediate school. It reopened on 22 August 1996 with fanfare.

From 2004–2006 Maple Leaf School was renovated and updated with the latest technologies and there have been physical renovations of new windows, air conditioning, and other improvements. In the 2010-11 School year, Maple Leaf School is undergoing a massive renovation project. This massive renovation project includes 12 new state-of-the-art classrooms, a separate gym facility and a courtyard. Right now, the school's 1950s gym doubles as the cafeteria and the school must have 4 lunch shifts to accommodate the students. Also in the 2010-11 school year Maple Leaf School gained a new principal.

Maple Leaf school's distinct features are its chimney which serves as a geographical landmark for the neighborhood. The school has two owls above the front doors facing Turney Road. As of 1/3/2011 Maple Leaf School lost its distinct chimney as part of a massive renovation.

Former schools

"Garfield Heights Middle School"

The former Garfield Heights High School was built in the 1950s, and housed one of the city's fallout shelters. It was three stories, with a basement. The basement consisted mainly of a secondary gymnasium and secondary male locker rooms (usually used for visiting teams of several sports.)

When a new high school was built, this building was turned into Garfield Heights Middle School. It stayed Garfield Heights Middle School until Winter Break (2002–03), when the students were sent to the then high school, and the high school students were moved to their new building right next to this one. In the spring, an auction was held for most of the older items left in the school, such as out-of-date desks, and an old school bus. The building was demolished on the last day of school of the 2002-03 school year, shortly after school let out, so the students could watch. Although the news reported a wrecking ball would be used, initial destruction was started by then-superintendent Ronald Victor, who destroyed a small wall of the building with an excavator, after which a construction worker took over. Once the workers stopped, for about five minutes, teachers and students were allowed to run up and take a brick, then ordered to leave as a fence was put up around the school. By the end of summer 2003, the building had been completely removed and the school ground was turned into a field until work could start on the Performing Arts complex for the new high school.
