Interrogation controversy 
As part of the ACS and Sytex acquisitions, Lockheed Martin became a contractor for military interrogation. Some of the Sytex interrogators have been linked to Guantanamo Bay,  Bagram torture and prisoner abuse and the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse scandals. In 2004, the GSA was reported to have begun investigating Lockheed's interrogation contracts.
