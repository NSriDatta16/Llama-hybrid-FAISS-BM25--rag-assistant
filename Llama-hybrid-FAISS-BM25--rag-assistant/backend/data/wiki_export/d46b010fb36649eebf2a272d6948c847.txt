She worked as a financial expert for the liberal-conservative Democratic Union (UDF) and was head of Bulgaria's Privatization Agency (1992â€“1994).

Interim Prime Minister of Bulgaria

Indzhova was appointed by President Zhelev, former leader of the UDF, to head a caretaker government after the collapse of Lyuben Berov's cabinet. During her brief time in office she gained some popularity for her efforts to combat organized crime.

In 2014 she appeared in the headlines for the first time in more than a decade. As head of the National Statistical Institute of Bulgaria, she accused her two direct subordinates for exerting undue political pressure in the institution.
