History

Hoxton station was first identified as a new station in a London Underground proposal made in 1993 to extend the line from  to Dalston Junction, involving the construction of new stations at  (Later opened as ), Hoxton and , and received the support of a public inquiry in 1994. It was envisaged that the construction of the extension and the station itself would begin in 1996 and to be completed by 1998. The project was finally approved by the Government in 1996 but a lack of funding forced the project to be delayed in 1997.

The station is currently the only completely new station to be built along the route of the former Broad Street branch of the North London line under the East London line project, although it is located on the tracks leading to the former Shoreditch (Dunloe Street) Depot, which was closed in 1968.

At ground level at the entrance to the station is the First World War memorial commemorating fallen staff of the former North London Railway, which built the section of viaduct that is now the modern East London Line through Hoxton. Originally placed at now-closed Broad Street Station, it was moved to first Richmond and then in 2011 returned to be nearer its former location. It is listed with Grade II.
