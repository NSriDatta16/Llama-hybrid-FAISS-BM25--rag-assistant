Early life and training
Hodgkinson was born in Providence, Rhode Island. She is of Armenian, English and French-Canadian descent.   She took part in dancing, ice-skating and gymnastics as a child. From 1983 to 1985 she trained at Festival Ballet Providence, now Ballet RI with Winthrop Corey and Christine Hennessey. She was eleven years old when she moved to Canada to further her training at Canada's National Ballet School in Toronto, skipping seventh grade. She was mentored by ballet mistress Magdalena Popa.

She took courses at Harvard Business School Online from 2020 to 2022, acquiring certificates in Leadership Principles, Negotiation Mastery, Power and Influence for Positive Impact, and Specialization in Leadership and Management.

Career

National Ballet of Canada 
At sixteen, Greta Hodgkinson joined The National Ballet of Canada’s Corps de Ballet (1990 – 1993). She was promoted to Second Soloist (1993-1995), then First Soloist (1995-1996) and, shortly before her 17th birthday, reached the highest rank of Principal Dancer (1996-2020). During her career, she has danced virtually every role in the repertoire, such as the title role in Giselle, Sugar Plum Fairy in The Nutcracker and Juliet in Romeo and Juliet, as well as contemporary works by choreographers such as Jiří Kylián, Christopher Wheeldon, Wayne McGregor and James Kudelka.

During 2019/20, her final season at the National Ballet of Canada, Greta Hodgkinson appeared in Jiry Kilian's Petite Mort and danced one of her signature roles, Giselle, whom she never portrayed as a naive, love-struck weakling, making the mad scene chilling in its intensity. Throughout her career, critics raved about her performances: “The ballerina performing the compelling title character has to go from a tremulously innocent girl, to madwoman, to unearthly spirit, and Greta Hodgkinson is among the best in the world in the role.” (Paula Citron, The Globe and Mail)   "Hodgkinson joins the great Giselles of our time." (Gary Smith, The Hamilton Spectator)  “In the demanding title role, Greta Hodgkinson is a wonder, both as dancer and actress.” (Bob Clark, Calgary Herald)   “Her breezy jumps paint her as a confident, yet trusting woman, who initially has no reason to doubt her man. She is also a technical dynamo, nailing every slow, sustained balance and complex turning sequence.” (National Post) 

Scheduled a few days before the pandemic shut down theatres throughout the world, her final performance was in the role of Marguerite in Frederick Ashton's  Marguerite and Armand, partnered by Guillaume Côté. The ballet was acquired in her honour by Karen Kain and the National Ballet, as Greta Hodgkinson had expressed the desire to dance a new role rather than reprise a past one.

International Guest Artist 
As an International Guest Artist, Greta Hodgkinson performed in over 72 cities and 16 countries. She was invited to dance with the top major ballet companies, including the Mariinsky Ballet, Teatro alla Scala, The Royal Ballet, Stuttgart Ballet, The Australian Ballet, Munich Ballet and Teatro Comunale di Firenze. She has also appeared in many international galas in America, Asia and Europe including the Opening Gala of the Royal Opera House (London), the State Kremlin Palace (Moscow), Gala des Etoiles (Montreal), Stars of the 21st Century (Paris and Toronto) and the Opening Gala of Teatro alla Scala (Milan).

In 2003, Ms. Hodgkinson appeared at The 10th World Ballet Festival in Tokyo, Japan, the world’s largest and most prestigious dance festival, where she performed with frequent partner Roberto Bolle, considered one of the greatest male dancers of his generation. Over their careers, they danced together in more than 26 cities worldwide and developed a much-celebrated partnership. The famed Japanese dancer from the Royal Ballet, Tetsuya Kumakawa, invited Ms. Hodgkinson to tour Japan dancing Swan Lake with him and his company, K-Ballet where they performed to critical acclaim. Apart from Mr. Bolle and Mr. Kumakawa, Ms. Hodgkinson was sought after by many renowned artists including Carlos Acosta, Marcelo Gomes, Guillaume Côté, Massimo Murru, Laurent Hilaire, Federico Bonelli, Robert Tewsley, Zdenek Konvalina, Jason Reilly, Evan McKie, Steven McRae and Matthew Golding.

Muse 
Greta Hodgkinson has had numerous roles created for her by the most influential choreographers of the 20th and 21st century. She enjoyed a "close creative symbiosis"  with choreographer and former Artistic Director of The National Ballet of Canada, James Kudelka. He created the sensuous summer section of his 1997 abstract ballet, The Four Seasons, expressly for Hodgkinson, and considered her a muse.  As such, she helped create many of the lead roles in works that are now a part of The National Ballet of Canada's permanent repertoire, among them Swan Lake, The Nutcracker, and The Firebird.

Hodgkinson also worked closely with such icons as William Forsythe, Jiri Kylian, Glen Tetley, John Neumeier, Wayne McGregor, Christopher Wheeldon, Crystal Pite and Alexei Ratmansky. She also collaborated with such noted Canadian choreographers as Jean-Pierre Perreault, John Alleyne, Robert Desrosiers and Jean Grand-Maitre as well as emerging young Canadian choreographers Dominique Dumais, Sabrina Matthews, Matjash Mrozewski and Guillaume Côté.

Over her 30-year career, Hodgkinson developed strong chemistry with frequent partners Rex Harrington, Aleksandar Antonijevic, Roberto Bolle and Guillaume Côté, "each one being wonderful in his own way".

She continues a prolific creative collaboration with dancer and choreographer Guillaume Côté as a Muse, Creative Assistant and Rehearsal Director. She created and toured in Crypto (2019-2022), a full evening multimedia work. She performed Hamlet’s mother in the Guillaume Côté-Robert Lepage adaptation of Shakespear’s play, which premiered at Festival des arts de Saint-Sauveur in July 2023 to critical acclaim. In 2019, Ballet Kelowna launched its 17th season with Guillaume Côté’s Bolero with Greta Hodgkinson as Guest Artist. The company's arftistic director, Simone Orlando, reflects on the experience: "She is really a superstar. She helped teach Bolero as well as offered so much to our dancers. She is fearless. The lifts in this piece are sort of death-defying. I’m sitting there, just holding my breath, hoping my dancers are going to catch her!”

Body of work 
Greta Hodgkinson possesses "a rare daring and an ability to devour space with aplomb and intelligence." Known for her formidable technique, delicate physicality and articulate characterization, Greta Hodgkinson has performed every leading role in the classical repertoire as well as contemporary works, leaving a legacy of memorable performances. "Being true to herself in an art form that values conformity is what has enabled Hodgkinson to stand out from the tutu-clad pack. She is a ballerina who dances to her own beat, a maverick with a killer work ethic and a heart of gold." (Deirdre Kelly, NUVO)
