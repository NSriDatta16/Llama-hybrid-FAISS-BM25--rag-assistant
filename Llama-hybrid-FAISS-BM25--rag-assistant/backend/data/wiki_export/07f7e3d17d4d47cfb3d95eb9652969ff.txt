Andre Cason (born January 20, 1969) is an American former track and field sprinter. He was a member of the American 4 × 100 meters relay team that won the gold medal at the 1991 World Championships in Tokyo with a world record time of 37.50 seconds. A few weeks after this event Cason, ran his first sub-10-second 100 meters race when winning in Koblenz in 9.99 seconds.

Cason attended Texas A&M University, where he was a two-time NCAA champion, and seven-time All-American for the Aggies.

The 1992 season started well for Cason as he set the world indoor record for the 60 meters on three occasions, leaving a standing world record of 6.41, and equalled the world indoor record for the 50 meters with a time of 5.62. Cason kept his excellent form until the early summer. However, at the 1992 US Olympic Trials he suffered a career threatening injury with a torn Achilles tendon, and was out for the rest of the season.

In 1993 Cason won the 100 m at the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships in Eugene, Oregon and won a silver medal over 100 m at the 1993 World Championships in Athletics in Stuttgart, running in 9.92 s. In the 4×100 m relay he was a member of the US team that tied the world record at 37.40 s in the semi-finals, and won the gold in the final with 37.48 s.

Cason coached the Liaoning Province Team Sprinters, and assisted in building and cultivating the Chinese National Sprint Team from 2010 to 2013. In 2014, Cason oversaw the high performance training for professional MMA fighters in Hong Kong. Since late 2014, Cason has been the National Sprint Coach for the country of Thailand, and the Thailand Olympic team.
