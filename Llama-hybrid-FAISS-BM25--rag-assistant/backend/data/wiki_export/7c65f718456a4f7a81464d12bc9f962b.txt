Construction and renovations 

The Pine Bush Elementary School on Carman Road, Route 146, opened in September 1994. It was approved by the community due to the district's growing enrollment. In 1999, a major expansion and renovation project, supported by a $24 million bond issue, was completed at Guilderland High School. In October 2001, voters approved the expansion and renovation of Farnsworth Middle Schoolâ€”a $19.7 million project which was completed in September 2005. This project included a fourth gym and the entire Seneca House.
