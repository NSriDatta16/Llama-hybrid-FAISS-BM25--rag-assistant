"World at Your Feet" is a song by English rock band Embrace from the re-released version of their fifth studio album, This New Day (2006). It was the official song of the England World Cup squad in the 2006 FIFA World Cup campaign, and was released on 5 June 2006. Singer Danny McNamara told the NME: "We didn't apply to do this. They just asked us. Our manager said, 'Do you want to do the World Cup song? The FA want to know.' I asked my dad and he said, 'if you think you're up to it-do it!' I was just trying to cover all the bases."

It was broadcast on Radio 1 on 21 April by Chris Moyles. A news reporter on BBC One was in a Bristol pub at the time and had several people listen and review the song. The first impressions were that the song is "too slow". This caused Moyles and a good friend of members of the band to shout out on the radio, live, "It's not too slow, it's perfect. Shut up and enjoy it."
