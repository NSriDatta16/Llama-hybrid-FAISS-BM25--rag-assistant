History 
The land that the present Linton Military Camp stands on was purchased by the Government in 1941 for use as a camp for Territorial and other home defence forces, with the first units taking up occupation in tented accommodation in February 1942, with the first prefabricated huts erected in August 1942. Unlike Burnham and Papakura, Linton was not initially intended to be mobilisation camp and as such was provided with minimal facilities. As the war intensified and the threat from Japan increased and the use of infrastructure in Palmerston North for defence purposes stretched to the limit, the decision was made to bring Linton up to the same standard as Burnham and Papakura.  Deliberately designed as a precaution against air attack Linton camp was designed with nine Battalion Blocks, with only eight being completed each with a;

 parade ground, 
 accommodation 
 cookhouse,
 mess building, and 
 ablutions.

Wartime construction was completed in 1945, and included;

 182 Permanent buildings,
521 two-men huts,
155 four-men huts,
480 eight-men huts,
 a power plant,
 water and sewage reticulation,
 rifle ranges,
 assault courses
 magazines.
 Railway siding.
