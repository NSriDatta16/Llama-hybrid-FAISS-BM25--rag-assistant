Description

From Charles Thomas Bingham (1905) The Fauna of British India, Including Ceylon and Burma, Butterflies Vol. 1:
Male upperside rich dark brown. Forewing with a cream-coloured even band from middle of costa to tornus, "bent slightly inwards at each end; a subterminal transverse, very obscure, pale fascia ending anteriorly in a white dot and two subapical white dots. Hindwing: postdiscal and subterminal very obscure pale transversa fasciae; the latter with a superposed series of seven oval black spots each with a white dot on the outer margin and inwardly pale-edged; the preapical two and posterior two of these spots only clearly defined, the others obsolescent, the preapieal two the larger. Underside duller brown; the markings as on the upperside; the hindwing with indications of a sub-basal pale fascia in addition to the others.  Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen dark brown; beneath the palpi, thorax and abdomen paler; antenna with a white dot at apex.

Female. Similar; the termen of the hindwing more distinctly but very broadly angulated outwards in the middle. Upperside: the ground colour paler duller brown, the oblique band on the forewing pure white, not cream-coloured; six (not seven) black spots in the subterminal series on the hindwing, the spots larger and more clearly defined than in the male. Underside: ground colour paler than on the upperside: markings similar; no trace of a subbasal band on the hindwing, the middle two spots of the subterminai series more or less obsolescent. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen concolorous with the ground colour of the wings, a white spot at apex of the antennae; beneath, the palpi, thorax and abdomen paler, marked with white.
