In Tongan mythology, Taufa was a sea god worshipped by chief Tungi of East Tongatapu and by the royal family of Tonga because he cured the Tongan king George I (ruled 1845â€“1893).

He also protects gardens.  In order for a homeowner to gain this protection, they had to braid a coconut leaf into a shark shape.

Taufa is both a sea and a land god.  As a sea god he appears as a shark.
