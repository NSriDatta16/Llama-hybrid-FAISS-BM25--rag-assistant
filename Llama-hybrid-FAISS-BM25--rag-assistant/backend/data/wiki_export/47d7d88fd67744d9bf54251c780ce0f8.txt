Target Video (aka TargetVideo77) is a San Francisco-based studio, founded by artist Joe Rees, collaborating with Jackie Sharp, Jill Hoffman, Sam Edwards and others. The studio archived early art performance, punk and hardcore bands on video and film. Performers such as the Sex Pistols, the Dead Kennedys, The Screamers, The Cramps, William S. Burroughs, The Clash, the Avengers, Mark Pauline, Survival Research Labs, The Go-Go's, John Cooper Clarke, Bauhaus, X, The Dils, Johanna Went, Talking Heads, Black Flag, Flipper, D.O.A and Crucifix were recorded in the late 1970s to the early 1980s. In addition, videos often included interviews with members of the bands. 

Target Video filmed a performance by The Cramps and The Mutants at Napa State Hospital on June 13, 1978, in which the bands performed for an audience of mental patients. Forty years later, Rolling Stone described the performance as "legendary" and "a landmark moment for punk rock". Despite being attended by only 100 people, mostly patients, the recording of the show became an underground sensation.
