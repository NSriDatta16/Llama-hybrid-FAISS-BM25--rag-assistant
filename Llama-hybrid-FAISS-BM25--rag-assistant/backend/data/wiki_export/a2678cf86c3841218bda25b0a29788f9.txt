Go Long Mule is an album by Uncle Dave Macon that was released in 1972.

Reception

Matt Fink of Allmusic called it a "A wild romp through 18 tracks recorded during Uncle Dave Macon's heyday period of 1926 through 1934, Go Long Mule is uniformly strong if not exceptionally complete. These are some of the most vibrant examples of old-timey music likely to be found."
