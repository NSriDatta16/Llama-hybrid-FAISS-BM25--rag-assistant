History

Etymology
As the name suggests, Widdrington Station has a railway station.  This is on the East Coast Main Line.

Geography

The soil is a strong clay, producing fine crops of wheat and beans, and the surface is generally level. It rises more steeply to  AOD to the far west of the parish and with a gentle elevation towards the old village, which commands extensive views in every direction, and the area around which formerly abounded in wood.  On the horizon from here is the sea.  Fields are extensively farmed, some of which are pasture, and there are remains to the west of a quarry of freestone, active in 1848. The population is spread over a large area with a density of approximately 0.7 persons per hectare which is average across the entire region.

Education
Widdrington's educational provision includes a state-assisted first school, voluntary controlled by the local Church of England ecclesiastical parish, supported by the Diocese.
