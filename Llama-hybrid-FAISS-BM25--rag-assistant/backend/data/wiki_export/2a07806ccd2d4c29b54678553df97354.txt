Singles

Album singles 
1983 Les p'tits mots / Mourir sur scène
Back in 1983, the song "Mourir sur scène" was considered one of the most beautiful songs Dalida had ever recorded and both singles enjoyed a fair amount of success in the French charts with the record going Gold by the end of its run.
After Dalida's death, the song "Mourir sur scène" took a huge meaning and became one of her most legendary songs.
The song's music and powerful lyrics say that the only desire of the singer is to die on stage where she was born and the singer talks with death during the verses symbolically asking death not to strike when the singer is sleeping alone in the shadows.
Dalida's live performances of this song during her concerts were so powerful and sincere that it was always followed by a standing ovation.
The song became immensely popular and is now considered a classical French pop ballad of the 1980s and one of Dalida's trademarks and signature tracks.
A remix of the song was released in 1995 and got a lot of radio airplay but the original version of the song is the most widely played on radio stations in all French speaking countries to this day.
Dalida recorded the song in French, English, Spanish and Italian, whilst Shirley Bassey included the English version of the song in her repertoire and performed it during her live concerts in the early nineties.
