Pennsylvania's first congressional district includes all of Bucks County and a sliver of Montgomery County in southeastern Pennsylvania. It has been represented by Brian Fitzpatrick since 2019.

The state congressional district map was redrawn by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in February 2018 after ruling the previous map unconstitutional due to partisan gerrymandering; the previous 1st district was geographically succeeded by the newly redrawn 2nd district which on November 6, 2018, elected Brendan Boyle, the incumbent from the 13th district. The new first district is similar to the previous eighth district, with the new boundaries going into effect for the 2018 elections and representation thereafter.

Fitzpatrick, the incumbent from the previous 8th district, was elected on November 6, 2018, to the newly redrawn 1st district. Only minor changes were made to the district after redistricting following the 2020 census. It was one of 18 districts that would have voted for Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election had they existed in their current configuration while being won or held by a Republican in 2022.

Prior to 2018, the district had generally been based in Philadelphia.
