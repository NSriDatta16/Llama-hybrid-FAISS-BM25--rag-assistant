He earned his B.A. from Oberlin College and his Ph.D. in English Literature with a specialization in Renaissance Literature from The University of Wisconsin. His PhD thesis was an edition of the poems of John Collop. He met his wife Marion Bailey in Madison where she was teaching high school English; their marriage lasted fifty-six years until Marion's death in 2008.  They had four daughters, Katharine, Marilyn, Jane and Ann. Katharine died in 1961 at age nine while the family was traveling to Spain for a Fulbright year.

Hilberry was a professor of English at DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana from 1954 to 1961 and at Kalamazoo College from 1962 to 1998.
