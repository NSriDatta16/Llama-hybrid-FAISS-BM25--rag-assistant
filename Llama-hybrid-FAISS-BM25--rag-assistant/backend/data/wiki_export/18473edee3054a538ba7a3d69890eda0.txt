Burn Hall School is an all boys missionary school in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, India. Its motto is  "Industria Floremus - In Toil We Flourish" . It is one of the oldest schools in the valley. The school celebrated its Diamond Jubilee in 2016.

History

Mill Hill missionaries Fr. Thijssen and Fr. Jong started a boys' school in Srinagar in 1942. "The Willows" building which housed the first Burn Hall School is now the Teachers' Training College.

The Srinagar branch closed down temporarily following the tribal invasion that occurred during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947–1948, and it was restarted on 17 April 1956 with its first principal, Father J. Boerkamp.

Location

Burn Hall School is located in Sonwar, Srinagar. It is neighboured by Ziarat Sharief of Syed Yaqoob Sahib, and Sher-i-Kashmir Stadium.

Administration

Burn Hall School is managed by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Jammu–Srinagar. It is directed by the Education Society of the Jammu-Srinagar Diocese. The school serves children from age 3 years through secondary school.

Social status

According to Greater Kashmir, in 2015 District Development Commissioner Farooq Ahmed Shah praised Burn Hall for "spreading quality education". Kashmir Observer said it is "a prestigious institution in the city, with one of the oldest schooling traditions". Yet Greater Kashmir also reported, in an article about matriculation exam results, "While the old famed brands like Tyndale Biscoe School, Presentation Convent Higher Secondary School and Burn Hall may still be first choice for schooling in this summer capital, other private schools including new ones seem to be emerging more meritorious, at least on the academic front."

In 2017, former Education Minister Altaf Bukhari congratulated the Principal, Father Sebastian Nagathunkal, for inaugurating a debate program at the school.

Affiliations

Registered as a charitable society, it is affiliated with Jammu and Kashmir State Board of School Education (JKBOSE) and recognized by the Education Department of the Government of Jammu and Kashmir. It follows the directions from the Directorate of School Education, Srinagar.

Public empowerment liability

The school's lease agreement on government land requires the school to hold places to admit students from the low economic sector of society.

Curriculum 
Burn Hall School follows curriculum of the JKBOSE, and as an English medium school, it places special emphasis on usage of English language in student-teacher and student-student interaction. Extra-curricular cultural and literary activities, as well as environment and science activities, provide experiential learning opportunities.
