Bruno Zumino (28 April 1923 − 21 June 2014) was an Italian theoretical physicist and faculty member at the University of California, Berkeley. He obtained his DSc degree from the University of Rome in 1945.

He was renowned for his rigorous proof of the CPT theorem with Gerhart Lüders;  his pioneering systematization of effective chiral Lagrangians;  the discoveries, with Julius Wess, of the Wess–Zumino model,  the first four-dimensional supersymmetric quantum field theory with Bose-Fermi degeneracy, and initiator of the field of supersymmetric radiative restrictions;  a concise formulation of supergravity;
and for his deciphering of structured flavour-chiral anomalies, codified in the  Wess–Zumino–Witten model of conformal field theory.
