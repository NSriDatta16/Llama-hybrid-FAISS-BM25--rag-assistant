Postman Pat is a British stop-motion animated television series first produced by Woodland Animations. The series follows the adventures of Pat Clifton, a postman who works for Royal Mail postal service in the fictional village of Greendale (inspired by the real valley of Longsleddale in Cumbria).

Postman Pat'''s first 13-episode series was screened on BBC1 during 1981 and 1982. John Cunliffe wrote the original treatment and scripts, and was directed by animator Ivor Wood, who also worked on The Magic Roundabout, Paddington, and The Herbs. Following the success of the first season, and that of several subsequent television specials, a second season of 13 episodes was produced by the same crew in 1996. Here, Pat has a family for the first time. A new version of the series has been produced by Cosgrove Hall from November 2003, which expanded on many aspects of the original series.
