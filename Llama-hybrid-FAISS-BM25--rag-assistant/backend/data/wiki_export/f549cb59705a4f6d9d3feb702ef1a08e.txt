Tripurantaka () or Tripurari is a manifestation of the Hindu god Shiva. This form of the deity is featured in a Puranic legend in which he destroys the three cities of the asuras, called Tripura, with a single arrow.

Legend
According to the Padma Purana, the asura Taraka had three sons named Tarakaksha, Kamalaksha (or Virayavana), and Vidyunmali. These asura princes performed severe penance towards the creator-god Brahma and obtained the boon of immense power. Brahma, on being pleased with them, presented each of them with an aerial fortress revolving in the sky, one each of gold, silver, and iron built by Mayasura. The boon granted the provision that they would reign for a millenium and could be destroyed only by an arrow that could merge the three forts into one, and set them to fire. The asuras, armed with this boon, wreaked havoc on the universe. The asuras well-entrenched in their aerial cities would mount attacks on the devas (gods) and the rishis (sages), and harass them. Ultimately, the gods and the sages approached Shiva, pleading for his assistance in removing this menace. Shiva refused as they were not engaging in undue harm. Vishnu caused the brothers to convert to Jainism, abandoning the worship of the lingam. 

Seeing that the asuras had engaged in sin, Shiva created a bow and an arrow and a chariot with the various gods and goddesses and components of the universe. His chariot was the earth itself, his wheels were the sun and the moon, his bow was Mount Meru with Vasuki was its string. With Brahma as the charioteer, he sped across, and shot a single arrow of fire, representing Vishnu. The cosmic arrow destroyed the three cities.

Shiva immediately regretted his act of releasing arrow, since he had forgotten to protect Maya, a great devotee of his. Realising this, Nandi raced ahead of the arrow and informed Maya of the impending doom. Instantly, Maya fled Tripura, leaving behind the great city he had constructed, which was immediately reduced to ashes, along with its inhabitants, the asuras, by the great arrow of Shiva. This destruction of Tripura, led to the appellation Tripurantaka, for Shiva.

The legend is also featured in theYajurveda:

Significance 

Stella Kramrisch describes the Tripurantaka episode in her book The Presence of Shiva that:

Iconography
Tripurantaka is usually portrayed as an archer with four arms, his third (right arm) carrying the trishula, while the fourth (left) holding the damaru, in the other two he holds the pinaka bow releasing the pashupatastra missile on Tripura.

The earliest form of this can be seen in Patadakal (belonging to Badami Chalukya period, 6-7 AD). Rashtrakutas also followed the same features as can be seen in Ellora, Kailasanatha Temple. Tripuranthakeshwara  temple at Balligave is built by Kalyana Chalukyas.  During Hoysala period, this story was presented in more detail and with beautiful ornamentation as can be seen in Hoysala temples at Javagal and Hosa Holalu. During this period, representing Tripurasura in 3 circular patterns began. This style is carried on by Vijayanagara sculptures and painters. One can see this depiction in murals at Virupaksha temple at Hampi.

In Hindu art, Tripurantaka is seen as a giant person of light showering light at the darkness which is known as "the destroyer of evil and darkness".

Festivals
Tripurantaka had various festivals, mainly he is celebrated on Kartik Purnima, which falls under the month of Kartika. He is also worshiped on Maha Shivaratri as an important manifestation of Shiva.

Devotees offer prasad which are Hindu sacred offerings to the deity, Tripurantaka prayers are usually done on the day of Rudra yajna which he  is seen as the protector of the universe.

An image of Tripurantaka is enshrined at Tiruvatikai near Chidambaram. The Veeratteswarar temple here is one of the eight Veerata sthalas celebrating Shiva as the destroyer of evil forces. Tripurantaka is also enshrined at Tiruvirkolam (Koovum) near Chennai.
