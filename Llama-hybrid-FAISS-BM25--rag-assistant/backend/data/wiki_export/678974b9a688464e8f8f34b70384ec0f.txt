History

Throughout the first half of the century, the suburban community grew quickly, and local residents desired quality shopping within their local setting.  Their vision began to take shape in 1949 when the Prudential Insurance Company of America acquired a large tract of land where The Mall at Short Hills and part of the Canoe Brook Country Club now sit.  Seven years later, B. Altman & Company opened a  store on the land and eventually added an additional  to meet market demands.  

Local residents continued their demand for expanded retailing and in the early 1960s, a small shopping center opened.  This open-air center included Bonwit Teller alongside retailers such as FAO Schwarz, Pottery Barn and Brentano's. Soon after, America's largest Bloomingdale's premiered on the site in 1967.  The  store included an entire floor devoted to furniture and decorative accessories.

In 1974, Prudential Insurance Company of America began working with The Taubman Company, which was The Mall at Short Hills' owner at that time. By 1980, the two organizations had completed a two-year, $100 million project to enclose the mall, which by then included  of gross leasable space and three anchor stores.  New retailers included Godiva Chocolatier, Black Star and Frost, The Limited and Gap. In 1981, Abraham & Straus joined the center.

The first phase of another major expansion began in 1993 and was completed in November 1994, adding a  Saks Fifth Avenue. Bloomingdale's was renovated, and Abraham & Straus became Macy's. The next expansion phase was completed in August 1995 adding two anchors—a  Neiman Marcus and a  Nordstrom—and many new specialty stores including Tiffany & Co., Crate & Barrel, DKNY and others.

Saks Fifth Avenue closed the Short Hills store in September 2016 in favor of a larger store at American Dream Meadowlands. It was then announced the space would be reconstructed to feature additional stores such as the U.S. debut of Indigo Books, a relocated Crate & Barrel, and Industrious, a pet-friendly, co-working office spacestore.
