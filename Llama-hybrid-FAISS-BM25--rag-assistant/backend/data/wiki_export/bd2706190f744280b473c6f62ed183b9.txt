Burning Shed hosts the official online shops for Porcupine Tree,  Andy Partridge, King Crimson, DGMLive, Thomas Dolby, Bill Bruford, Jethro Tull, Lo-Fi Resistance, No-Man, OSI, Medium (Jansen, Barbieri and Karn), 21st Century Schizoid Band, Rothko, Roger Eno, Hugh Hopper, Stewart/Gaskin and Hatfield and the North and others.
