One Night in Paris – The Exciter Tour 2001 – A Live DVD by Anton Corbijn is a video release by Depeche Mode, featuring an entire concert from their 2001 Exciter Tour, shot at the Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy on 9 and 10 October 2001. Although the cover only lists the second date, material from the first was used, as "It Doesn't Matter Two" was only played on the 9th. That song was replaced by "Sister of Night" the next day (and included as a bonus track on disc 2). Many fans were disappointed to see the popular song "Clean" (a regular on the tour, played on the first night in Paris) not included (no live version is officially released of the song to this date), "Condemnation" (from the second night, rarely performed in 2001, with several live versions previously available) taking its place in the film. It was directed and filmed by Anton Corbijn, and released on 27 May 2002.

The first disc features the full concert, while the second disc contains documentaries on the movie, interviews with the band, extra songs, tour projections, and more.

Background 
The DVD was directed by the band's long-time artistic collaborator Anton Corbijn at the sold-out Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy in front of 16,000 people. The concert film was shot on anamorphic 16:9 Digital Betacam using 13 cameras.
