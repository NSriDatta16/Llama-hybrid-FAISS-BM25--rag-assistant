All Saints Central High School is a private Roman Catholic high school located in Bay City, Michigan, United States. It is located in the Diocese of Saginaw. It is part of a grouping of schools: All Saints Central Elementary, All Saints Central Middle/High School and Little Saints Childcare Center.

In 1967, a University of Michigan study group recommended all east side Bay City Catholic high schools form one central high school. A joint team from the existing schools (St. James, St. Stanislaus, and St. Joseph schools) merged to form All Saints Central. The new school opened in September 1968, with a faculty composed of religious from the Sisters of Charity, the Grand Rapids Dominicans, and the Felician Sisters, as well as lay faculty members.

All Saints had 164 students enrolled in 2009. Students attend mass at St. James Church every week and are required to complete 100 community service hours before they graduate.
