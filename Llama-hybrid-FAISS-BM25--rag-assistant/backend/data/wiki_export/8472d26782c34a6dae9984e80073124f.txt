Critical reception: S. Rasool of Reviewit.pk said: "Jee Chahay has a number of excellent and heart-touching songs. One among the rest, which is closest to Fakhir's heart, is 'Baylia'. It is a-must-listen song. If you have not heard it yet, do give it a go." Ali Ather of Views Craze wrote, "Although not better than Faakhir's previous works Jee chahay the album composed and produced by Faakhir himself comes out to be a pretty decent effort." Rafay Mehmood of Express Tribune said, "Even though Jee Chahay, which comprises 10 songs, might not come close to his previous offering Mantra, which was released in 2005, it still manages to give the listener some tunes worth humming."
