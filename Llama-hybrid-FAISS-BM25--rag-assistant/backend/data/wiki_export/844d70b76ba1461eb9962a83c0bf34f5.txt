JC's Girls 

JC's Girls is an international, faith-based organization that offers spiritual support to women working in the sex industry. Their primary focus includes visiting local strip clubs in order to extend an invitation to attend church. Their approach includes offering small gift packages along with ministry contact information. Additionally, the ministry participates in the annual AVN Adult Entertainment Expo held in Las Vegas. The organization has set up an exhibitor booth during the convention, presenting a message to entertainers and patrons with the message: "There is nothing you have ever done that God would not forgive you for!"

The organization has developed chapter ministries across the United States. These chapters include JCs Girls of San Diego; JCs Girls of Austin, Texas; JCs Girls of Las Vegas; and JCs Girls of Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

In 2007, Veitch began partnering with Annie Lobert of "Hookers for Jesus" on a joint media project entitled "Saving Sex City". However, the project was short lived and , Veitch and Lobert were no longer producing new episodes.
