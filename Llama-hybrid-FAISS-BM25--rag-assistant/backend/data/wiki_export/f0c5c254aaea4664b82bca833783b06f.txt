History

An earlier station was opened nearby as Bescot Bridge in 1837 by the Grand Junction Railway but was later renamed .

A station was subsequently opened as Bescot on the current site on 1 May 1850, it was renamed to Bescot Junction in August 1850.

The line through the station was electrified in 1966 as part of the London Midland Region's electrification programme. The actual energization of the line from Coventry to Walsall through Aston took place on 15 August 1966.

It was renamed  Bescot Stadium in 1990 in order to serve Bescot Stadium, the newly built home of Walsall Football Club.

The station was re-opened on 11 September 2007 after a short period where it was closed for refurbishment. Whilst closed, no services called at the station, but trains continued to pass through.

Incidents

The wagon then struck the engine's tender, and four of the following carriages, derailing and badly damaging them. One passenger died and over 20 more were in injured.
