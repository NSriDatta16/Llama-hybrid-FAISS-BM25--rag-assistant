Sunan al-Darimi () or Musnad al-Darimi () by `Abd Allah ibn `Abd al-Rahman al-Darimi (181H–255H) is a hadith collection considered by  Sunnis to be among the prominent nine collections: the Al-Kutub al-Sittah, Al-Muwatta and the Musnad of Imam Ahmad.

Despite its title as a Musnad, it is not arranged by narrator in the manner of other Musnads, such as that of Tayalisi or Ibn Hanbal. It is arranged by subject matter in the manner of a book of Sunan, like the Sunan Ibn Majah.

Description
It contain almost three thousand five hundred hadith (3833) according to Maktaba Shamila. The arrangement of Hadiths are by subject matter. Most of Hadiths in Sunan are authentic, only few of Hadiths are weak (Dhaif).

Conveyance
Darimi transmitted these hadiths to `Isa ibn `Umar al-Samarqandi; date of death unknown, but presumably after 293 AH. Thereafter it passed to:
 `Abdullah ibn Ahmad ibn Hamawiya al-Sarkhasi (293–381 AH) 
 `Abd al-Rahman ibn Muhammad ibn Muzaffar al-Dawudi "Jamal al-Islam" (374–467 AH) 
 Abu'l-Waqt `Abd al-Awwal ibn `Isa ibn Shu`ayb al-Sijizzi (458–553 AH)
