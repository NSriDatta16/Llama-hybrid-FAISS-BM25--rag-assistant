Controversies

Football team mass baptism
In 2015, the school came under scrutiny for allowing a local pastor to perform mass baptisms on the school football team during an official on-campus practice. The Freedom From Religion Foundation threatened legal action against the school district if steps were not taken to prevent a recurrence. An investigation by the school district concluded that the school "failed to follow district facility usage procedures for outside groups using school facilities". A miscommunication was later claimed between the head football coach and pastor regarding ability to perform such actions on a public school campus.

Basketball game fight
On January 25, 2022, a fight broke out at a basketball game against Lithia Springs High School that took place at the Villa Rica school gym. The fight, which started in the stands, spilled onto the court and caused the game to be suspended. After an investigation, authorities charged seven teenagers with affray and disruption of a public school.
