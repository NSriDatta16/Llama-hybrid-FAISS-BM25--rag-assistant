Tchai-Ovna also provides a place for music, poetry readings and dramatic performances and an arts exhibition space for local artists. It also hosts musical events on most week days, with performances from songwriters, jazz musicians and local and world music artists.

Tchai-Ovna's name is inspired by the teahouses (ƒçajovny) in the Czech Republic. The Glasgow venues are popular, particularly with students, the elderly and members from local bands Belle and Sebastian's 2003 album art for Dear Catastrophe Waitress was shot in Tchai-Ovna's West End venue.
