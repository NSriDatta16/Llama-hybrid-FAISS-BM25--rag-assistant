The Catholic Church in Korea is part of the worldwide Catholic Church, under the spiritual leadership of the pope in Rome.

The Catholic Church in Korea originated because of Western books and the increase if Western knowledge that related to Catholic teachings. The Catholic Church faced severe persecution under the Joseon Dynasty. Due to a threat against Confucian-based social and political order. Many major events contributed to the spread of the Catholic Church in Korea. This effected the spread of the Catholic church to be different between the South and the North.

The Catholic hierarchy in Korea has never been divided between South and North, in the same manner as the Catholic hierarchy in Germany was never divided between East and West between the artificially created borders. For example, some parts of the territory of the archdiocese of Seoul are located in North Korea. Nevertheless, since the political division of Korea in 1945, Catholicism has had a different development in North and South.

North Korea

North Korea is officially an atheist state and does not have diplomatic relations with the Holy See. The Catholic hierarchy has been inactive there for decades (i.e. since the Korean War), and there are no active Catholic churches in the country.

The only territorial abbey outside of Europe and one of only 11 remaining territorial abbeys is the Territorial Abbey of Tokwon, located near Wonsan in North Korea. The persecution of Christians in North Korea since 1949 has made any activity in the abbacy impossible. However, the Territorial Abbacy of Tokwon is formally still kept as one of the few remaining territorial abbeys within the Catholic Church.

South Korea

About 11% of the population of South Korea (roughly 5.8 million) are Catholics, with about 1,734 parishes and 5,360 priests as of 2017. By proportion of a national population and by raw number of adherents, South Korea ranks among the most strongly Catholic countries in Asia after the Philippines and East Timor.

Origin of the Catholic Church in Korea
The origin of the Catholic Church in Korea can be traced back to the late 18th century. During this period, a small group of Korean intellectuals and scholars were exposed to Catholicism through Western books and Chinese translations. The growing influx of Western knowledge into Korea facilitated these early encounters with Catholic teachings. As a result, some scholars began to embrace the new faith and lay the groundwork for establishing the Catholic Church in the Korean peninsula.
The pivotal event in the early development of the Catholic Church in Korea occurred when Yi Seung-hun, a Korean diplomat, traveled to Beijing in 1784. During his stay, Yi Seung-hun encountered Catholicism for the first time and was baptized as Peter in the Catholic Church. Upon returning to Korea, he brought back Catholic books and religious materials, which he shared with friends and associates. This marked the beginning of a small, albeit significant, Catholic community in Korea.

Persecution of Catholics before 1866
In the decades that followed the introduction of Catholicism to Korea, the Catholic Church faced severe persecution under the Joseon Dynasty. The primary reason for this persecution was the perceived threat of Catholic teachings to the existing Confucian-based social and political order. The Catholic faith, emphasizing loyalty to God above earthly authorities, was seen as subversive, potentially destabilizing the established hierarchy.
The first official record of persecution against Catholics dates back to 1801 when Siméon-François Berneux, a French Catholic priest, was arrested and expelled from the country. Over the years, the number of converts and the intensity of the persecution grew. The government issued several edicts banning Catholicism and subjected known adherents to torture and execution. Despite the risks, the Catholic community grew clandestinely, and many Korean Catholics died as martyrs for their faith during this period.

Major Event Affecting the Spread of the Catholic Church in Korea
One of the most critical events that significantly affected the spread of the Catholic Church in Korea was the Catholic Persecution of 1866, also known as the Byeongin Persecution. Fears of foreign intervention triggered this persecution, as Catholicism was associated with Western countries, particularly France. The prevailing anti-foreign sentiment further fueled the hostility towards Catholics, making them easy targets of persecution.
The Byeongin Persecution was characterized by widespread violence and brutal suppression of the Catholic community. Thousands of Korean Catholics, including clergy and laity, were killed during this period. Among the notable figures who suffered martyrdom during the persecution were French bishop Siméon-François Berneux and Korean lay leader Paul Yun Ji-Chung.
Despite the immense challenges faced by the Catholic Church during this time, the persecution did not crush the faith of Korean Catholics. Instead, it further strengthened their resolve, and the sacrifice of the martyrs became a source of inspiration for future generations of believers.
