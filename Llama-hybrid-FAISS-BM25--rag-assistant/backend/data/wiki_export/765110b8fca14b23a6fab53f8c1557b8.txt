Pact for Sicily (Patto per la Sicilia, PpS) was a political party in Italy, based in Sicily.

It emerged in 2005 by the split from New Sicily, a mainly social-democratic party, of the Christian-democratic faction led by Nicol√≤ Nicolosi, who had been the party's only member of the Chamber of Deputies since 2001. Shortly before the 2008 regional election, the PpS was merged into the Movement for Autonomy.
