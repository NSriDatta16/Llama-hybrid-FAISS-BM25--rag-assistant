The XPW King of the Deathmatch Championship is one of Xtreme Pro Wrestling's championships. Originally, the championship existed as a trophy at stake in the first-ever Baptized in Blood event, featuring a Japanese-style 8-Man King of the Deathmatch tournament.

Background
After The Messiah defeated Supreme for the championship, an actual title belt for the championship would later appear and debut at XPW's Baptized in Blood 2. The Messiah would wind up as the longest reigning champion, holding onto the title for nearly a year, and only being stripped of the title after he was fired from XPW.

The championship was highly contested while XPW was based on the West Coast, as matches would often consist of a plethora of Barbed-Wire, Beds of Nails, Beds of Thumbtacks, Light Bulbs and (occasionally) exploding barbed-wire devices.
