The Namibia Football Association (NFA) is the governing body of football in Namibia. It was founded in 1990, and affiliated to FIFA and to CAF in 1992. It organizes the national football league and the national team. Its aim is to create a football culture and industry that provides entertainment and economical benefits for all; to become a dominant national association within the confederation via the professionalism of the game's administration; to promote education and development programmes in all aspects of the game, particularly regarding youth and women's football; and to provide a force for cohesion in society.

Its Mission & Vision:

Promoting and facilitating football development through sustainable structures and training initiatives.
Engage in pro-active dialogue with the government to cultivate recognition of the game as a national asset.
Establishing mutually beneficial relationships with the corporate world.
Creating an image of being a transparent, stable, and progressive organization.
Working relentlessly to engage national teams and clubs in international competitions, contributing to the rise of Africa as a football powerhouse.

On 22 July 2020, the NFA officially expelled the Namibia Premier League as a member and a 2 year absence of soccer comes from the disputes of these two bodies, and founded the Namibia Football Premier League in 2021.
