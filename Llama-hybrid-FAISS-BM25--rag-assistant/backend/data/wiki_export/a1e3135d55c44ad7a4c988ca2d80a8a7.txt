Ángel David Comizzo Leiva (born 27 April 1962) is an Argentine football manager and former player who played as a goalkeeper. He is the current manager of Peruvian club Atlético Grau.

Comizzo was born in Reconquista, and began his career at Talleres in the Primera Division Argentina. In 1988, he joined River Plate where he was loaned to UANL Tigres of Mexico in 1990–1991. In 1993, he moved to América de Cali in Colombia, but after a very poor performance, he returned to Argentina later that year to play for Club Atlético Banfield.

In 1996, he joined Club León in Mexico, and in 1999 he moved to team Morelia in time to be part of a championship club. In 2001 Comizzo returned to River Plate, and in 2003 he joined Atlético Rafaela where he retired from football in 2004.

In September 2009, Angel Comizzo was brought in by Carlos Reinoso to be his assistant manager for Querétaro FC. Comizzo was a huge part of Reinoso's Leon in 1997 when they lost the final against Cruz Azul in Extra Time with a golden goal.

World Cup 1990

When Nery Pumpido was injured in Argentina's second match at the 1990 World Cup finals, Comizzo was brought into the squad as a replacement. He did not actually play in any of the team's subsequent matches in the tournament.

Curse of Leon and Cruz Azul

It is said that Comizzo cursed Leon and Cruz Azul during the final of 97 by kicking Carlos Hermosillo at the last minute and causing a penalty kick that made them lose the final.
