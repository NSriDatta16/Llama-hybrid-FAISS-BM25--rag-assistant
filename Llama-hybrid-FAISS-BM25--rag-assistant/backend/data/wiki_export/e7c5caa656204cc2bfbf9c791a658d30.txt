Hanguana  is a genus of flowering plants with a dozen known species. It is the only genus in the family Hanguanaceae.

The APG IV system of 2016 recognizes such a family and places it in the order Commelinales, in the clade commelinids, in the monocots (unchanged from the APG III system of 2009 and the APG II system of 2003. This represents a slight change from the APG system, of 1998, which left Hanguanaceae unplaced as to order, but assigned it to these same clades (although it used the name commelinoids). The family consists of only very few species of perennial, tropical plants in Sri Lanka, Southeast Asia, New Guinea, Micronesia, and northern Australia.
