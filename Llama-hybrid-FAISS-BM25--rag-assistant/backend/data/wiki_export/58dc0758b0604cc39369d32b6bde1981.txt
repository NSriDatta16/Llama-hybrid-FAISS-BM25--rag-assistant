"Nothing Like the Rain" is a song recorded by Belgian/Dutch Eurodance band 2 Unlimited. It was released on 10 June 1995 as the fourth and final single from their third album, Real Things (1994). The song was written by co-producers Phil Wilde and Peter Bauwens with Michael Leahy. In the US, it was released as a double a-side single with the European hit single "Here I Go". It peaked within the top 20 in at least four countries, and was also the first single by 2 Unlimited that was a pop-ballad. The single was not released in the UK. Its music video was directed by Nigel Simpkiss, who had previously directed several videos for the band.

Chart performance
"Nothing Like the Rain" was a moderate success on the charts in Europe, entering the top 10 in the band's native Netherlands, peaking at number six. Additionally, it entered the top 20 in Finland (18), Norway (17) and Spain (14), while it reached the top 30 in Belgium (23). On the Eurochart Hot 100, the single peaked at number 68. It was the first 2 Unlimited single to not receive a UK release, and did not chart on the UK Singles Chart. Outside Europe, "Nothing Like the Rain" peaked at number 134 in Australia.

Critical reception
Pop Rescue called the song "brilliant", describing it as "a slow, gentle, beautiful ballad, and it really gives Anita the room to show off her vocals."
