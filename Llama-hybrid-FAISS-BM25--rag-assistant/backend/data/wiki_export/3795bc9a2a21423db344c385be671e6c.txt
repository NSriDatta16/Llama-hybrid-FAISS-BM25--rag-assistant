Ringedalsvatnet is a lake in Ullensvang Municipality in Vestland county, Norway. The  lake sits just east of the village of Skjeggedal and about  east (up the valley) from the village of Tyssedal, which sits on the shore of the Sørfjorden.  The lake is the main reservoir for a hydroelectric power station in Tyssedal which provides electricity for the power intensive industries in the nearby town of Odda.  The  wide and  high Ringedals Dam was constructed from 1910–1918.

Due to the extensive regulation of the nearby lakes such as Langavatnet and Nybuvatnet in the mountains above this lake, several of the large waterfalls that once fed Ringedalsvatnet are no longer regularly flowing.  The Tyssestrengene and Ringedalsfossen waterfalls were once very notable waterfalls on the cliffs surrounding this lake.  The Trolltunga cliff overlooks this lake too, attracting many tourists and hikers each year.
