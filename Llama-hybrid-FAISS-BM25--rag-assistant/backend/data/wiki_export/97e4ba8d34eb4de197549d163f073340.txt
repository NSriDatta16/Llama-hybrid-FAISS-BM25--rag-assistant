"Say You'll Be Mine" is a song by British dance-pop group Steps, released as a double A-side with a cover version of Kylie Minogue's "Better the Devil You Know". Steps' cover of "Better the Devil You Know" was later included as the opening track on their third studio album, Buzz (2000), but did not serve as a lead single. A limited-edition single was released as a digipack that was included with a doubled-sided poster in the sleeve. The song is the first to feature all five members on lead vocals.

"Say You'll Be Mine" / "Better the Devil You Know" was released on 13 December 1999 and reached number four on the UK Singles Chart in January 2000. The double A-side also reached the top 40 in Australia and Ireland. A new Matt Pop's Old Skool Mix was included on the remix album Stomp All Night: The Remix Anthology as the first track on the second disc.

Critical reception
Scottish newspaper Aberdeen Evening Express noted that "this is the first track where the Stepsters all take turns on lead." They added, "The instantly catchy singalong fest has a mature feel and is a dead cert to get you bopping this winter." Lucas Villa from AXS stated that Steps was at "its most adorable" on the "sweet" pop tune "Say You'll Be Mine". Can't Stop the Pop described it as "fascinating" and "one of their most brilliantly uplifting songs", adding that the track is "bursting at the seams with subtly catchy hooks." Also they noted that it is their first song to feature all five members of the group on lead vocals.
