John Kowalski (born December 22, 1951 in Miłków, Poland) is a former coach of the professional United States soccer clubs Tampa Bay Mutiny (Major League Soccer), Pittsburgh Riverhounds (NASL) and Pittsburgh Spirit (MISL). He also briefly managed the United States national team in 1991, compiling a 2-0-1 record.

Kowalski was also the head coach of the 1989 and 1992 U.S. five-a-side (Futsal) teams which won a bronze medal in the Netherlands in 1989 and a silver medal in Hong Kong in 1992.

The 1989 bronze was the first official U.S. medal in a FIFA world competition.

He also coached the Robert Morris University women's soccer team from 2001 until 2019. With the Colonials, he amassed a career 112-224-19 record, and guided RMU to their first ever Northeast Conference Tournament appearance.
