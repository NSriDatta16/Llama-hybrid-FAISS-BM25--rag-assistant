Etymology and History 

The settlement was originally named Kampong Melayu, a large Malay village that used to include Kampong Ubi and Kaki Bukit areas. It was later renamed  Eunos in honour of its founder, Mohamed Eunos bin Abdullah.

Eunos was the Chairman and co-founder of the Singapore Malay Union and the first Malay representative of the Legislative Council, the then governing body of Singapore. In 1927, he appealed to the government and was granted $700,000 that the Singapore Malay Union used for the purchase of 670 hectares of land, which later became known as Kampong Melayu. This land was used to provide a home for Malays who were affected by the building of Singaporeâ€™s first airport at Kallang.
