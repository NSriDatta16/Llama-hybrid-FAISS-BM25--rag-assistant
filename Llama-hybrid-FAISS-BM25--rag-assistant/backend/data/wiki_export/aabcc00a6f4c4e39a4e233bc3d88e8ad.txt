NFL Football '94 Starring Joe Montana, released as simply NFL Football '94 in Japan, is a 1993 Sega Mega Drive/Genesis game. It features realistic running commentary while the player engages in exhibition, regular season, or playoff action. It is fifth in the Joe Montana Football series and the fourth to be developed by BlueSky Software. Unlike the earlier Joe Montana Football, this game had both NFL and NFLPA licenses, and as such, contains all of the league's (then) 28 NFL teams, and its players and their attributes for the 1993 season.
