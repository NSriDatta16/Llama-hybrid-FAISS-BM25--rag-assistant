Music video
In July 2006 the video for "Gigolo" premiered in Greece. The video is in Greeklish (Greek/English), with the first verse in Greek and the rest of the song in English. In the video Elena plays 2 parts: of herself and of the gigolo that steals Elena's mobile phone.

The video starts with Elena talking on her phone when the gigolo steals it. Security goes after the gigolo while Elena goes on set to shoot her newest videoclip. She dances to her song and as the second verse of the chorus starts the gigolo films Elena with the phone. Elena notices this and quickly chases the gigolo, along with her three dancers. Elena ends up in the car park of the building where she finds her phone on the ground. She looks at the phone, seeing a video of herself moments ago. As the song comes to an end, the gigolo appears from behind, slowly revealing that it's actually Elena herself.
