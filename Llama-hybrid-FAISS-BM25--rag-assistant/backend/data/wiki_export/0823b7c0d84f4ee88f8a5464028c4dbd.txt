Other scenic lakes including Evans Lake and Sand Lake as well as chains of smaller lakes lie nearby. The park is traversed by Michigan Route 124 north of its intersection with US HighwayÂ 12.

History
Dedicated in 1920, the park was among the first 25 established by the Michigan State Parks Commission, which referred to it as both Cedar Hills State Park and Adrian State Park. It originally comprised a 99-acre purchase by the state plus two donations of land which brought the park's size to some 200 acres. It was renamed in 1930 after the family of Michigan State Senator Walter J. Hayes made a donation of land with the stipulation that the name change take place. The Civilian Conservation Corps made improvements to the park during the 1930s. Michigan CCC camp SP1 was active in Hayes State Park from 1933 to 1935.

Facilities and activities
The park offers fishing for bass, bluegill and pike, swimming, hiking, picnicking, boat launch, boat rentals, campgrounds, and mini-cabins.
