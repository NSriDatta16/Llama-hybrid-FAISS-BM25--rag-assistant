Dark at the End of the Tunnel  is the seventh studio album by American new wave band Oingo Boingo, released in 1990.

Music
Dark at the End of the Tunnel marked Oingo Boingo's move toward a more pure pop sound, eschewing the frantic style of previous records for a more mainstream approach, with an emphasis on emotional lyrics.

By the time of the album's recording, frontman Danny Elfman had become a famed film composer, particularly in collaboration with Tim Burton. The track "Try to Believe" had been recorded for the 1988 film Midnight Run (scored by Elfman), appearing as an instrumental mix in the end credits; and a vocal version, attributed to "Mosley & The B-Men", was released on the film's soundtrack album. An alternate mix was persuaded for inclusion on Dark. Similarly, an early mix of "Flesh 'N Blood" first appeared in the 1989 film Ghostbusters II and on its soundtrack.

"When the Lights Go Out" peaked at No. 15 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart in March 1990.

Artwork
The cover art of the album depicts a portion of a painting entitled "Volcano", by artist Peter Zokosky.

A promotional version of the album was released on a vinyl picture disc, with one side featuring the album cover and the other side featuring a color photograph of the band.

Reissue
In 2022, a remastered issue of Dark at the End of the Tunnel was released on CD as an expanded edition with four bonus tracks, and coloured vinyl.
