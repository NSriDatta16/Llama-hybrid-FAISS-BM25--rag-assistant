Critical acclaim
Rhapsody ranked the album number 7 on its "Country's Best Albums of the Decade" list. "Allan's sixth album was the first one released after his wife of three years committed suicide. This collection of haunting, heartbreaking songs chronicles his pain and, ultimately, his path back to living. Steeped in grief, Tough All Over is one of Allan's most consistent efforts to date, thanks in part to his gift of conveying emotions like regret, heartbreak and emptiness in a single, well-phrased line. Country Universe said the album was the 3rd best of the decade. Engine 145 country music blog list it number 7 on the "Top Country Albums of the Decade" list.
