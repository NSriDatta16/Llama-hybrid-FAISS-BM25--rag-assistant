History 
Long Island National Cemetery was established in 1936 with a purchase of  of land from Pinelawn Cemetery (a neighboring cemetery) to answer a need after World War I of a large number of veterans, and not enough burial space in the urban cemeteries in New York City. At the time the only National Cemetery in the area was Cypress Hills National Cemetery in Brooklyn, and it had very limited area available. The land was developed and burials began in March 1937. Within its first 8 years, it saw over 10,000 interments from World War II.

A section of the cemetery has the interments of World War II prisoners of war, including 37 Germans and 54 Italians.  There are also 35 British Commonwealth servicemen buried here from the same war.

Notable monuments 
  A granite memorial to "Fallen Comrades of Nassau & Suffolk Counties" was erected in 1940.
