Background and career
Thomas Anson was born 14 February 1767, the first son of George Anson, of Shugborough and Mary Vernon, the daughter of George Venables Vernon. The family's surname was Adams until 1773, when his father inherited the Anson estates upon the death of his maternal uncles and his unmarried older brother, Thomas.

He was the brother of Mary Anson (born 1759), who married Sir Francis Ford, 1st Baronet, in 1785. Thomas's brothers included army generals Sir George Anson and Sir William Anson.

He was educated at Eton College in 1779 and Oriel College, Oxford, in 1784.

On his father's death in 1789, Thomas Anson succeeded him as Member of Parliament for Lichfield, which he represented until 17 February 1806, when he was succeeded by his brother, George.
