History
There have been several callsigns and formats over the years; the current one consists of Mainstream County and is the Flagship for Cheatham County Central High School Sports.

The then-WQSV signed off on June 8, 2013 due to insufficient advertising support from area businesses. The station's studio and transmitter site were sold in a foreclosure sale to Community Bank & Trust on June 14. A deal was reached to sell WQSV to Lightning Broadcasting in September 2013; Lightning is controlled by Neil Peterson, who also owns WSGI and WDBL in Springfield. The station changed its call sign to WJNA on December 9, 2013.

On February 7, 2019, Fowler Media Partners began operating WJNA under a local marketing agreement and changed the station's format from southern gospel to classic country, simulcasting WVWF 105.1 FM Waverly, under new WVWK call letters. The station has since relaunched separate original programming under the brand name The Bear.

On June 26, 2019, the station changed its call sign to WBWR. The next day, owner Sycamore Valley Broadcasting closed on the sale of the station and the W280FN translator to Mike Parchman's Consolidated Media LLC at a purchase price of $100,000.

On January 9, 2020, the station changed its call sign to WVWZ. On February 22, 2021, the station changed its call sign to WCHQ and rebranded as "Q Country 103.9". The call sign changed again to WNTC on July 22.

Effective October 14, 2021, Consolidated Media sold WNTC and translator W280FN to The Mighty Seven Ninety Incorporated.
