History

Montrose station, and the corresponding Montrose Avenue, are both named after James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose, a Scottish nobleman.

Montrose Station opened in 1907 as part of the Northwestern Elevated Railroad's Ravenswood line. In CTA's skip-stop service on the Brown Line, instituted in 1949, Montrose was originally an "AB" station, but it was changed to "B" station in 1973, and remained that way until the CTA discontinued skip-stop service in 1995.

In 2006, the CTA began the Brown Line Capacity Expansion Project, which involved the renovation and reconstruction of all Brown Line stations to allow eight car trains to run on the line and to ensure that all stations are accessible to passengers with disabilities. Montrose station closed between December 2, 2006, and November 26, 2007, and was completely rebuilt.
