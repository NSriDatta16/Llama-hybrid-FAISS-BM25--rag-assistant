History

Scuol is first mentioned in 1095 as Schulles. At the end of the 11th and in the 12th century, the lords of Tarasp owned extensive estates in Scuol. In 1095/1096 their family founded a Marian monastery in Scuol and endowed it richly. In 1150 the monastery was moved to Marienberg in the Vinschgau valley. In 1178 Pope Alexander III confirmed all of the monastery's possessions in Scuol, including the church.

The village was destroyed in the Swabian War of 1499; in 1516 Bernardo da Poschiavo built a new church. Circa 1533 Scuol became Protestant. In 1621/1622 the village was devastated by Austrian troops; in 1652 it bought its freedom from Austria.

From circa 1860 onwards, the healing springs of Scuol were used on a larger scale and the time of spa tourism began. During the following decades, the bath house and numerous hotels were built between the two old parts of the village. The opening of the Bever–Scuol line of the Rhaetian Railway in 1913 stimulated further growth.

With the advent of winter sports in the middle of the 20th century, the second era of tourism in Scuol began. After the gondola lift to Motta Naluns (1956), numerous chairlifts and surface lifts were constructed. The spa tradition was revived in 1993 with the opening of the Bogn Engiadina ("Engadine bath"), including the first Roman-Irish bath in Switzerland.

The Neo-Renaissance style Grand Hotel Waldhaus Vulpera in Scuol-Tarasp with Sgraffito-Elements was opened on 8 June 1897. It was one of the first addresses in the Swiss Alps and a major Belle Époque monument in Europe.

Heritage sites of national significance

The Baselgia refurmada, the Chasa Wieland Nr. 29 and the Kurhaus Bad Tarasp (spa Bad Tarasp) in Scuol, the Chasté (a prehistoric site, a medieval fortress and a church) and the Doppelwohnhaus (Double-house) in Ardez, Tarasp Castle and the Trinkhalle (drinking hall) in Tarasp are all listed as Swiss heritage sites of national significance.

The Chastè site includes settlements from the late Bronze Age (Melauner culture) into the early Iron Age (Fritzens-Sanzeno culture) as well as some finds from the Roman Empire.

The Chasa Wieland Nr.29 in Scuol village was built around a three story medieval stone tower.  It was likely built by one of a few Graubünden noble families.  The tower may have been damaged when Scuol was destroyed in 1499 during the Swabian War, but if so it was quickly repaired.  During the Bündner Wirren, in 1622, Scuol and the tower were burned.  Soon thereafter a farmhouse was built over the ruins, incorporating the  thick walls.  Some of the doorways are from the tower, while new windows had to be broken into the walls.  The date 1753 was carved into the lintel.  The walls still show the Pietra Rasa construction, where the mortar that holds the rough stones together is also used as a plaster to them.  After plastering with mortar, lines are incised into the mortar to give the appearance of regular bricks or stones.
