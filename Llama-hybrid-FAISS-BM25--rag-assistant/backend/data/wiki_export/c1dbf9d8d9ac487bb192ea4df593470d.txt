"Rez" is a non-album track by British electronic music group Underworld, originally released in 1993 in the UK. It became a popular club hit and live track in Underworld's sets, despite the fact it could not be found on an album. However, it did appear on many compilations, b-sides, and even appeared on a bonus disc for Second Toughest in the Infants (1996). The first promo release of the single was pressed onto pink vinyl, and is highly collectible as it has an exclusive non-album track, "Why, Why, Why". The song's obscurity led to many bootleg pressings of the song before it was officially re-issued as part of 1992–2012 The Anthology. The more common release has the single "Cowgirl" as its b-side. This version also received a limited white vinyl pressing in the US.

Notes 
 The text "CLOUD HAT REMEMBER THIS" is etched into the run-out groove of the COLLECT 002 12".
 Unofficial bootleg remixes of 'Rez' / 'Cowgirl' by breakz DJ's 'Atomic Hooligan' were deemed good enough by Underworld's record label and led to their inclusion as remixers of "Born Slippy .NUXX 2003" in 2003
 The White Island EP (CD & 2x12") by Salt Tank features a track inspired by Underworld's "Rez". "Rezmorize", as the name suggests, is an homage to Underworld's famous instrumental track.
 Underworld's labelmates, Futureshock, were also inspired by "Rez"'s b-side, "Why, Why, Why", which is sampled heavily in "The Question", and was released on the JBO label offshoot, Fuju.
 After hearing the song at a performance, Tetsuya Mizuguchi decided to rename his at-the-time work in progress game from K-Project to Rez. The name stayed into its release.
