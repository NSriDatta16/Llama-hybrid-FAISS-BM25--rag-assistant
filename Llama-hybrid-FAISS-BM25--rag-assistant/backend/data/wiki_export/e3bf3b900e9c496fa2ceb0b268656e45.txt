The Ontario Hockey Federation (OHF) is the governing body of all sanctioned ice hockey in the province of Ontario in Canada, except for those portions governed by Hockey Northwestern Ontario and the Hockey Eastern Ontario.  The federation is one of Hockey Canada's thirteen regional branches.

During the summer in 1989, the Metro Toronto Hockey League (MTHL) and the Ontario Minor Hockey Association (OMHA), broke away from the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) and formed the Central Canada Hockey Association, due to disagreement with an OHA restructuring proposal which would have limited their voting powers. The dispute ended when the OHF was established, with equal representation for the OHA, Northern Ontario Hockey Association, MTHL, and OMHA. OHA president Brent Ladds was named executive director of the OHF, which was given the mandate to oversee hockey in Ontario, and be a review panel for three years to propose further restructuring if necessary.

William T. Ruddock Trophy

The William T. Ruddock Trophy is presented by the Ontario Hockey Federation to top Junior "A" hockey club within their jurisdiction.  The trophy is awarded at the Dudley Hewitt Cup tournament to the winner of the round robin game between the Ontario Junior Hockey League champion and the Northern Ontario Junior Hockey League champion.  In the past, the now defunct Metro Junior A Hockey League's champion also competed for the trophy.
