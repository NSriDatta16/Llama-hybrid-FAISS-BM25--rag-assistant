Tom found the whole thing stupid, but the brothers brought their best. Pat did not give up a hit until the fifth inning. Tom allowed four hits and struck out four in keeping the Tigers scoreless through seven. Then, Tigers center fielder Jerry Morales led off the eighth with a home run. Pat pitched into the ninth before handing the game over to the bullpen with one out. For Tom, it was a complete game loss.

He split the season in the minor leagues between Evansville with the Tigers and at the Indianapolis Indians of the International League for the Reds. Between the two teams he had a record of 7-4 with a 4.09 ERA.
