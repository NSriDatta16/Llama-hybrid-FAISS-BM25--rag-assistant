The West River is a river in the U.S. state of Rhode Island. It flows approximately  and is the only named tributary of the Moshassuck River. It has a history of providing water to textile mills during the Industrial Revolution as evidenced by the 7 dams along the river's length.

Course
The West River rises on the town line between Lincoln and Smithfield from a few small streams that originate in the vicinity of Lantern Road. The West River then flows southward, past Twin River Road and into Wenscott Reservoir.  Below the reservoir, the river meanders east-southeast through North Providence and into Providence where it flows into the Moshassuck River north of downtown.
