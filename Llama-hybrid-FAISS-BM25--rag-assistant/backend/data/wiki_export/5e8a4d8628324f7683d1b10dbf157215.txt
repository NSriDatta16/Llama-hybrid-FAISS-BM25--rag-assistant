Penetrator is the eighth studio album by American rock musician Ted Nugent. It was released in February 1984 by Atlantic Records.

"Tied Up in Love" was made into a promo clip to support the album. It reached No. 56 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. The song "(Where Do You) Draw the Line", written by Bryan Adams and Jim Vallance, was originally recorded by Adams for his hit 1984 album Reckless but was left off the final track list. Adams' version eventually saw a release on the 30th anniversary reissue of Reckless.

The cover art is a section of the painting "Dragon Tattoo" by Boris Vallejo.

Reception 

In a largely negative review, John Franck of AllMusic proclaimed Penetrator to be "one of Nugent's most underwhelming releases".
