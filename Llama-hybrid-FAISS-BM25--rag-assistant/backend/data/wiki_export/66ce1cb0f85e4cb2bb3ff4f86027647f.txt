History
Plans to build a new transit system linking the city centre of Hiroshima with the suburban area to the northwest were first proposed in July 1977.

The third-sector Hiroshima Rapid Transit was founded in 1987, funded primarily by the city of Hiroshima.  Groundbreaking for the rapid transit line project began on February 28, 1989, and construction would continue over a five-year period. However, on March 14, 1991, 15 people were killed when a girder collapsed on a section of the line's elevated viaduct near the  station's construction site. The line opened for revenue service on August 20, 1994.

When the line originally opened in 1994, it had 21 stations, of which  provided the line's only transfer with a JR West line (the Kabe Line). On March 14, 2015,  opened as an infill station between Hakushima and J≈çhoku in order to provide a transfer point with the Sanyo Main Line.
