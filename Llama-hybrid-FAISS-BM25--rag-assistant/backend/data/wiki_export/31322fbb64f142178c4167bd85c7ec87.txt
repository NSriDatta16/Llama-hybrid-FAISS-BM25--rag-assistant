History
The Handball Working Committee was first formed in Zagreb in 1948 and the following year the HRS itself was formed within the Independent State of Croatia. After the Second World War, it was renamed the Handball Federation of Croatia and ceded some powers to the Yugoslav Handball Federation. Upon Croatia's independence from Yugoslavia, the Croatian Handball Federation again represented the country. It joined the European Handball Federation and the International Handball Federation in 1992.
