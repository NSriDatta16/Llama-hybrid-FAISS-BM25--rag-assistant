Matt Kenseth was the top runner-up, despite replacing fellow candidate Tim Bender several races into the season. Johnny Chapman began the year with NorthStar Motorsports, but was released with several races to go in the season. Brothers Jeff and Mark Krogh came in from the Northwest driving for their family-owned team, each posting one top-ten apiece. Lyndon Amick and Dale Earnhardt Jr. were the only other rookie contenders in 1997.
