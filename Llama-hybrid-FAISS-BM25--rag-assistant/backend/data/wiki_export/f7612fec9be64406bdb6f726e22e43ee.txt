History 
The Buena Vista Palace Resort & Spa was rebranded and renamed as the Wyndham Palace Resort & Spa in November 1998 (the hotel's owners, who had acquired the hotel a year earlier, had purchased Wyndham earlier in the year).  In 2005, the Blackstone Group acquired Wyndham International and announced plans to launch a new brand LXR Luxury Resorts.  LXR Luxury Resorts would consist of 21 premium properties wholly owned by the Blackstone Group, including the former Wyndham Palace which reverted to its original name in 2006. The hotel was sold to the Hilton Corporation in 2015, and has since been renamed as the "Hilton Orlando Buena Vista Palace".

In the late 80s, the Buena Vista Palace was also used as a Grand Prize in the Nickelodeon Game Shows, Double Dare And Think Fast.

In 2015, the Hilton Corporation acquired the hotel. With the acquisition, a multi-million-dollar renovation of the entire hotel commenced.
