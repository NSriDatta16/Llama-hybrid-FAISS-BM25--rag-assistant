History

The station opened in 1888 as part of the Brockenhurst to Christchurch Branch Railway. It was operated by the London and South Western Railway from 1888 to 1923, by the Southern Railway from 1923 to 1948 and by British Railways from 1948, and from 1982 as part of the Network SouthEast region. From privatisation in 1996 to 2017, all train services were run by South West Trains. Services are now run by South Western Railway.

When it was built there was some discussion on what to call the new station. Milton was suggested, as the closest place, but was discounted as there are a number of places in England with that name. Barton, a short distance away, was also suggested but was decided against for the same reason. It was not until the sub-postmistress set up the sub post office across the road and called it New Milton Sub Post Office that the current name was decided upon.
