One day, Rohit calls Chandni and asks her to come on the roof of her home where he is waiting for her in a helicopter to shower rose petals on her.

Production 
Speaking about the film with Karan Johar, Yash Chopra recalled when he was making Vijay (1988), an action film, he felt like he was not supposed to make films like this. Later he met with writer Kamna Chandra, who had achieved popularity after having written Raj Kapoor's Prem Rog (1982). She presented the story of a social romantic musical film to Chopra who liked it and started casting the stars. However, at the launch party, Chopra had a change of heart and decided to change the second half of the script, wherein originally Chandni was supposed to marry Lalit and have a son.

Initially Rekha was approached to play the titular role. With casting of Vinod Khanna, distributors started demanding an action sequence in the film to which Chopra refused. Originally, the script required Khanna saving Sridevi from a fire incident. However, upon watching the completed film, Chopra felt that it did not feel like a part of the film, so he called Sridevi and Khanna back for a day's shoot to re-film their first meeting sequence.

Music
The soundtrack of Chandni was composed by Shiv Kumar Sharma and Hariprasad Chaurasia, known together as Shiv-Hari. The lyrics were provided by Anand Bakshi. In addition to the songs listed below, there was a recurring instrumental love melody, not part of a full song. That melody was further developed into the song "Kabhi Main Kahoon" for Chopra's next film Lamhe (1991), also scored by Shiv-Hari.

The film's soundtrack was a major success in India and sold more than 10 million copies, becoming the best-selling soundtrack album of the year as well as the decade. It is believed that the soundtrack helped bring back the romantic musical genre, along with Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak (1988) and Maine Pyar Kiya (1989), with its songs and lyrics receiving major critical acclaim. According to Yash Raj Films, the soundtrack went 4× Platinum by the day of the premiere. By the 25th week, it went 25× Platinum, a new standard in the music industry.

Reception & Legacy 
Chandni received widespread critical acclaim upon its release, with many critics highlighting the film's impact in being instrumental in bringing an end to an era of violent action movies in Indian cinema and rejuvenating the romantic musical genre. Chandni emerged as one of the biggest hits of 1989. The Hindu stated that "the film opened to full houses and distributors had to drastically increase the number of theatres". It was cited by Times of India as "one of the most-watched films of Indian Cinema." Hindustan Times featured the movie in its list of 'Yash Chopra's Greatest Hits' saying "it was instrumental in ending the era of violence in Bollywood and bringing back the romance into Hindi films."

The film consolidated Sridevi's position as the top female star of the era. Describing Sridevi's performance in Chandni, Indiatimes wrote "True to her screen-name, she was an epitome of radiance, warmth and vivacity. She effortlessly introduced us to the powerful streaks, her classic, angelic character was laden with." The scene where she confronts Rishi Kapoor was ranked by Rediff as one of the "10 Best Scenes from Yash Chopra Films." While Sridevi topped the Hindustan Times list of Yash Chopra's "Top 5 Heroines", CNN-IBN ranked her #1 on its list of 'Yash Chopra's 10 Most Sensuous Heroines', saying that "Yash Chopra immortalized Sridevi as the perfect Chandni." The titular character became one of the most famous characters of Hindi cinema, with India Today including it in its list of 'Yash Chopra's Iconic Characters'. CNN-IBN listed it among 'The Cult Characters Yash Chopra Created', while NDTV featured it in its list of 'Yash Chopra's Greatest Creations' stating that the film established Sridevi "as the nation's sweetheart" and "reinforced her position as the reigning actress in Bollywood."

Costume design in the film was done by Bhanu Athaiya and Leena Daru. Sridevi's iconic 'Chandni Look' revolutionized fashion in North India and became synonymous with the actress, with Rediff stating "A luminous Sridevi slips into every possible design in white for a major chunk of the romance and no one complains." Speaking about the look, Chopra told film critic Rajeev Masand "While making Chandni, I had a vision of who I wanted this girl to be. I told Sridevi that most of her costumes in the film would be in white." The Tribune wrote "Leena Daru scored a winner again when she created the Chandni look for Sridevi. Every street corner sold the salwar-kameez and dupatta that gave the heroine a refreshingly understated look, rarely seen on the Indian screen." while Mid-Day reported "Leena Daru dressed Bollywood's beauties for several years. But it was her simple white churidar and kurta with the leheriya dupatta for Sridevi in Chandni that gave the Southern belle an angelic image and caused the Chandni Chowk stores to hit the jackpot with thousands of copies." BizAsia described the effect of the look saying "Chopra never quite got over his Sridevi hangover and almost always chose to present his future lead heroines in similar outfits (Juhi Chawla in Darr (1993), Madhuri Dixit in Dil To Pagal Hai (1997), Preity Zinta in Veer-Zaara (2004)), but none of them became half as iconic as Sridevi did after Chandni." The 'Chandni Look' was also highlighted in the film's famous tandav dance sequence by Sridevi, where Rediff said "the actress transformed into a mythical goddess in a white number." Sridevi's chiffon sarees became equally popular with Indian Express writing "This film made the chiffon sari a must-have in every Indian woman's wardrobe."

The music of Chandni became a multi-platinum success with Sridevi's famous dance number "Mere Haathon Mein Nau Nau Choodiyan Hai" finding a place in Rediff's chart of 'Bollywood's Top 25 Wedding Songs'. Sridevi also lent her voice to the film's popular title-track "Chandni O Meri Chandni" which featured among the 'Top 5 Songs of Yash Chopra' by Hindustan Times. Talking about her role in Chandni, Sridevi said it was "a lively and vibrant girl in the first half (who) becomes quiet and goes into a shell in the second half. I loved that transformation and when you have a director like Yash Chopra at the helm, you can be sure that he will make the best out of everything."
