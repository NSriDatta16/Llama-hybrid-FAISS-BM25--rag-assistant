Bangor West railway station is located in the townland of Ballyvarnet in Bangor, County Down, Northern Ireland.

It was opened on 1 June 1928 by the Belfast and County Down Railway to serve the rapidly expanding suburbs of Bangor. It was initially provided with a wooden structure on the up side to function as waiting room and ticket office.

It was replaced with a simple, more robust concrete structure in 1978. It remains one of the few intermediate suburban stations in Northern Ireland to retain a ticket office. This is owed to the station's high popularity and usage, being served by the Bangor express train, one of the few stations in North Down to be served.
