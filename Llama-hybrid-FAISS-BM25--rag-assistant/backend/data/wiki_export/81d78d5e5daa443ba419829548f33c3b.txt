I Hear The Music is a compilation album of songs by American pop rock duo England Dan & John Ford Coley, released by A&M Records several years after the various A&M recording sessions. Four songs, "Tell Her Hello", "New Jersey", "Mud and Stone" and "Miss Me", had already been released on the 1970 album England Dan & John Ford Coley. The other songs were recorded around 1970–72 for the album Fables (1971) or other shelved projects. After showing only minor success in the US with "New Jersey" (number 102) and better results in Japan with "Simone" (number 1), the duo was cut from the A&M roster in 1972. A&M kept testing the market, though, releasing "I Hear the Music" as a promotional single in September 1973. England Dan & John Ford Coley were left without a record company for a few years, but they participated in various projects including two Seals & Crofts albums.

After the duo's huge 1976 hit single "I'd Really Love to See You Tonight", released through Big Tree Records, A&M capitalized on the market success by releasing an album of tracks recorded years earlier. The UK version of the album includes "Simone" as an extra track.
