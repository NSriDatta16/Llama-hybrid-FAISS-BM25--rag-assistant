Phonology
The phonology of Guere (here the Zagna dialect of Central Guere / Southern Wè) is briefly sketched out below.

Consonants
The consonant phonemes are as follows:

Allophones of some of these phonemes include:
  is an allophone of  before nasal vowels
  is an allophone of  before nasal vowels
  is an allophone of  before nasal vowels
  is an allophone of  in word-initial position
  is an allophone of  after a coronal consonant (alveolar or palatal)
In addition, while the nasal consonants  and contrast with  and  before oral vowels, and are thus separate phonemes, before nasal vowels only the nasal consonants occur.  and  do not occur before nasal vowels, suggesting that historically a phonemic merger between these sounds and the nasals  may have occurred in this position.

Vowels
Like many West African languages, Guere makes use of a contrast between vowels with advanced tongue root and those with retracted tongue root. In addition, nasal vowels contrast phonemically with oral vowels.

Tones
Guere is a tonal language and contrasts ten tones:
