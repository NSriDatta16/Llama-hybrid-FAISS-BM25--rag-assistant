A by-election was held for the House of Commons constituency of Dudley West on 15 December 1994 following the death of the sitting Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) John Blackburn.

The result was a Labour gain from the Conservatives, on one of the largest swings since the Second World War. This was the first significant sign of the changed political climate following the election of Tony Blair as Labour leader, which would eventually lead to Labour's 1997 general election victory. Labour gained nearly 70% of the votes, whereas the Conservative candidate attracted fewer than 20% of the votes.
