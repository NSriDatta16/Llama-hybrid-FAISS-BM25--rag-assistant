is a former Japanese long-distance runner, best known from winning the gold medal in the marathon at the 1991 World Championships in Athletics in Tokyo. The favourite to win the race, Olympic champion Gelindo Bordin, only finished eighth. The marathon was run under extremely adverse conditions of heat and humidity, which are reflected in the slow winning time of 2:14:57h. Taniguchi is the only male Japanese runner ever to have won a gold medal at World Championships.

Taniguchi also won the Beppu-ÅŒita Marathon in 1985 and the London Marathon in 1987.
