The Organisation of Marxist–Leninists of Greece (), known by its Greek acronym OMLE (ΟΜΛΕ), was a Greek anti-revisionist Marxist-Leninist political movement, which split from the Communist Party of Greece in 1964, opposing Soviet revisionism.

OMLE emerged from the merger of exiled Greek communist in the former Soviet Union and the other Eastern bloc countries with a Greek communist group which was publishing the magazine  Anagenisi (, 'Renaissance').

After Mao Zedong's death, in 1976, OMLE came into a major crisis and split in two major parties: Communist Party of Greece (Marxist-Leninist) and the Marxist-Leninist Communist Party of Greece, the latter party following the Three Worlds Theory.
