Biography
Stennett was born in Pencoed, Bridgend. During World War II, he served in the army and also worked as an entertainer. He made his professional stage debut with a group called the Harmaniacs. In 1940, he became resident comedian on variety radio show, Welsh Rarebit, and he gained further success as one of the regular comedy guests on The Black and White Minstrel Show.

In the 1990s Stennett presented a country music show on Pontypridd Community Radio Station GTFM, having been introduced by former Valleys Radio/BBC presenter Steve Powell.

Television
Although primarily a comedian, who appeared in variety shows and pantomime throughout the UK, Stennett played "straight" acting roles in television programmes such as Coronation Street and Casualty. He was best known as Sid Hooper in the ITV soap opera, Crossroads, before taking a lease in 1980 on the Roses Theatre in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire.

Stennett was a friend of Eric Morecambe, and hosted a show at The Roses that was to be Morecambe's final appearance, on 27 May 1984, immediately after which Morecambe died of a heart attack.

Stennett played trumpet and guitar. In his 80s he was still performing onstage. His autobiography, Fully Booked, was published in 2010.
