Sergio Galindo (September 2, 1926 – January 3, 1993) was a Mexican novelist and short story writer.  He was born in Xalapa in the state of Veracruz, a region of Mexico that figures prominently in much of his writing.  His most popular and widely acclaimed novels are El Bordo (“The Precipice”, 1960) and Otilia Rauda (1986), the latter filmed as La Mujer del Pueblo in 2001. Galindo studied at the Mexican National Autonomous University (UNAM) and in Paris.  He was the founder and first director of the University of Veracruz Press, where he also founded and edited the journal La Palabra y el Hombre (“The Word and the Man”).

Galindo was Director of the Palacio de Bellas Artes (National Institute of Fine Arts) from 1974 to 1976.
