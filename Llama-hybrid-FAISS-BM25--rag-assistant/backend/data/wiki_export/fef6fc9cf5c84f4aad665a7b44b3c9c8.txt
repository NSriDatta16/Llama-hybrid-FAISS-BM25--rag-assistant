"Oh L'amour" is a song by English synth-pop duo Erasure, released in April 1986 as their third single. Written by Erasure members Vince Clarke and Andy Bell, it is a lament from someone experiencing unrequited love. The song is an uptempo, synth-pop dance track and its popularity was further fueled in dance clubs by the "Funky Sisters Remix", which appeared on the UK 12-inch single and as a bonus track on the US edition of Erasure's debut album, Wonderland (1986). A different mix of the song was submitted for the single release, adding new instrumentation and extra sounds. This version appears on all of the band's compilation albums. A version of the 12" single was included with early copies of the debut LP Wonderland. One of the B-sides is a cover version of "Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)", the first time Erasure covered a song from the ABBA songbook. It was issued by Mute Records in the UK and Sire Records in the U.S. to herald the June release of Wonderland, but became the third consecutive commercial failure for the band in both territories. Despite its low chart placement, "Oh L'amour" has proven to be one of Erasure's signature songs, due to its popularity in dance clubs. It remains a favourite among fans, particularly when performed live.

In 2003, the song was remixed and released as a single again to promote the greatest hits package Hits! The Very Best of Erasure. In its remixed form, the song became a UK Top 20 hit, peaking at number 13 in autumn 2003. The original artwork of the "Oh L'amour" single featured illustrations from The Railway Series of characters Percy and Rheneas. As permission had not been given, this cover was withdrawn and replaced with a plain black cover with only the title and band name.

Critical reception
Ned Raggett from AllMusic wrote, "A lovely a cappella opening and instantly catchy hook, not to mention sprightly performances from Clarke and Bell both (the latter wisely undersings rather than pushing the flamboyance, letting loose more on the chorus), ensured its classic status." He also called it "brilliant", noting the "soothing jump" of the song. Everett True from Melody Maker stated that "it takes some kind of fool genius to create fast songs of the scope and emotional rush" of the "dramatic" "Oh L'amour". Chris Gerard from Metro Weekly complimented it as "the first truly great Erasure single" and "an infectious dance/pop classic". Darren Lee from The Quietus noted the "effete hormonal cravings" of the song, praising it as one of "the most gloriously effervescent pop anthems ever recorded."

Chart performance
In 1986, "Oh L'amour" climbed to number 85 on the UK Singles Chart and became Erasure's first big hit in South Africa (number two), Germany (number 16), Australia (number 13), and their sole hit in France (number 14). In the United States, the song's biggest impact was on the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart, where it hit number three on 26 July 1986.
