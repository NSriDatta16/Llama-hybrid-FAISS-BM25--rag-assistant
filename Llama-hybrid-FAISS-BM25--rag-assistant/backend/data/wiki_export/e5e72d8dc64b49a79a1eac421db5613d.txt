The athletics program and teams of Bishop Gorman are known as the Gaels, and compete in the Southwest Division of the Sunset 5A Region. The Gaels have been described by USA Today and Sports Illustrated as being among the top thousand high school athletic programs in the United States.

In the summer of 2008, the Gaels baseball team, sponsored by American Legion Post 76 in Las Vegas, won the American Legion World Series, a first for any Nevada high school. They ended up fielding 798 points total in football, more than any other high school in the nation for the 2009 season and ended up being ranked 46th in the nation by Rivals.

At the start of the 2012 season, Gorman beat nationally ranked teams Our Lady of Good Counsel in Maryland and St. Louis High School in Hawaii to raise its high school ranking into the top ten schools.  Both matches were televised, by ESPN and Fox networks, respectively. In 2014 and 2015, Bishop Gorman won back-to-back National Championships. Sanchez then left the program to coach at the collegiate level.
