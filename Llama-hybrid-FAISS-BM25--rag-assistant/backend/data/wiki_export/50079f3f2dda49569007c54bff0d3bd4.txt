The Pearl Jam "official" bootlegs are a large, continually growing series of live albums by the American alternative rock band Pearl Jam. Pearl Jam noted the desire of fans to own a copy of the shows they attended and the popularity of bootleg recordings. They had been open in the past about allowing fans to make amateur recordings, and these "official bootlegs" were an attempt to provide a more affordable and better quality product. The official bootlegs are a complete record of almost every show the band plays, excluding club "warm-up" dates.

The band has sold more than 13.5 million copies of shows since launching the bootleg series in 2000.

2000–2001
Pearl Jam's official bootleg program was begun for the band's 2000 Binaural Tour. 72 of the "bootlegs" were released to stores in three waves in late 2000 and early 2001, with the 25 European bootlegs coming first. Every show was released in a cardboard sleeve containing two CDs, with the exception of the 72nd and final show on the tour, November 6, 2000, at KeyArena in Seattle, Washington. The Seattle show was released as a triple-disc set, and was the highest-charting of the series, peaking at number 98 on the Billboard 200, and was called an "essential live document" by Allmusic. Eighteen shows from the tour were chosen by the band as "Ape/Man" shows, which, according to bassist Jeff Ament, were shows the band found "really exciting." With the release of these official bootlegs, Pearl Jam would set a record for most albums to debut in the Billboard 200 at the same time.

2003

The CDs continued for the 2003 Riot Act Tour, but they were not available in stores at first. They had to be ordered through the band's official website, and were mailed out. The bootlegs were made available within a week of each show date. After each leg of the tour, however, certain standout shows were released in stores: February 23, 2003, in Perth, Australia; March 3, 2003, in Tokyo, Japan; May 3, 2003, in State College, Pennsylvania; July 8, 2003, and July 9, 2003, in New York City; and July 11, 2003, in Mansfield, Massachusetts. The State College show was a three-hour, triple disc show, which vocalist Eddie Vedder vowed to make "the longest Pearl Jam show ever played." It was surpassed by the Mansfield show, from the Tweeter Center Boston, in which the band played 45 songs, including an acoustic set. The New York shows, from Madison Square Garden, were released both separately and as a boxed set. The July 8, 2003 show was also released as the Live at the Garden DVD. In 2004, Pearl Jam released Live at Benaroya Hall, and while it came in similar packaging to the bootlegs, it is not considered to be part of the series.

2005–2006
Pearl Jam took a year-long touring break until the 2004 Vote for Change tour, but the band elected not to release bootlegs for the six shows from that tour. The band took yet another year off until a fall 2005 tour of Canada and South America. For the first time, the bootlegs were MP3-only, again only available through the band's official website. The music downloads were accompanied by pictures from individual shows. The MP3-only format expanded to include lossless FLAC format for the band's 2006 summer tour for its self-titled eighth album. The digital bootlegs were typically made available within 2–3 days of each show date. The bootlegs were available through the band's official download website, which has since been discontinued.
