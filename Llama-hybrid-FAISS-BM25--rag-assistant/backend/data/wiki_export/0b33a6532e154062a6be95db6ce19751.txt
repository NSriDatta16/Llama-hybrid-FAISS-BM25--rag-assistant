Etymology
Until the 1970s Zarrinshahr was known as Riz-e Lenjan (or simply Riz for the locals). The name changed to Zarrinshahr as a result of what seems to be merely bureaucratic decision making.

History
The center of Lanjan county was renamed to Zarinshahr due to its neighbors to Zayandeh Roud in 1336 according to the resolution of Riz city council, inspired by the ancient name of Zarinroud. According to archaeologists, the objects discovered in the hills of Bagh Mahmud, Bagh Daraz and hills Kafer, which are located in the south of this city and in the neighbors of ancient riz canal , come from the heart of a few ancient hills along the Zayandeh Rood route, which historically It is the period with Silk Kashan civilization.
