There are over 230 Catholics in the Falkland Islands, approximately 10% of the total population. There are no dioceses in the islands, instead they form an apostolic prefecture which was erected in January 1952. It is immediately subject to the Holy See and separate from any Argentine or UK dioceses. The spiritual leader of the prefecture is Father Hugh Allan who was appointed in 2016.

The Eucharist is celebrated at RAF Mount Pleasant.
