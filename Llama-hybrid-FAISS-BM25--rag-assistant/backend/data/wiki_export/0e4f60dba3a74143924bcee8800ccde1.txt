Geography

Although the north is mountainous the south is lower lying at around . On the north and south slopes there are fields and vineyards whose wines compete with those  from Tokaj, and the fields bordering the vineyards offer views of the Tatra Mountains.

History
It is not certain when the village was established, but it was some time during the Mongol invasion of Europe, or the earlier Hungarian invasion ().

The first record of the village is in 1392 and the Monok family owned it from the mid 13th century until the mid 17th century. The name of the village allegedly comes from Slavic monoh meaning "monk". During the Ottoman Empire the village was razed and in 1567 it was recorded as being just barren fields. Towards the end of this century the village was reinhabited and around 1570 a small castle was built in the Renaissance style. Later, the village was owned by the Andrássy family who renovated the castle, but because it was too small they built another nearby in the Classical style.

Ethnicity

93% of the population is Hungarian, with the remaining 7% being of Romany origin.
