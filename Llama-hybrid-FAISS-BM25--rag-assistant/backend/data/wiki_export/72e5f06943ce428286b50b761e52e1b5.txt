Duke of Tetuán () is a hereditary title in the Peerage of Spain, accompanied by the dignity of Grandee and granted in 1860 by Queen Isabella II to General Leopoldo O'Donnell, 1st Count of Lucena, who had served as the Prime Minister of Spain for several legislatures between 1856 and 1866.

It is a victory title, and was granted to O'Donnell as a result of his success at the Battle of Tétouan, during the War of Africa.

It has been held since its creation by members of the O'Donnell family, as the 5th Duchess, Blanca O'Donnell, died without issue of her marriage to Guillermo Pelizaeus. Should they have had children, the dukedom would have gone out of the family.
