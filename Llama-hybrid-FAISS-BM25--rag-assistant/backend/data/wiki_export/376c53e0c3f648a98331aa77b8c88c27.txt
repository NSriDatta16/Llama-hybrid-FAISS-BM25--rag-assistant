European route E28 is a west-east intermediate road in the international E-road network. Beginning at the Bundesautobahn 10 (Berliner Ring) in Germany, it runs west-east for a length of  to Minsk, Belarus. The section between Kaliningrad and Minsk is part of the Pan-European Corridor IX.

History 
In the 1975-version of E-roads, the predecessor of this road was the E26 (and current E26 was called E28) going from Berlin to Gdańsk. It changed its name when it still was this short. This was not signposted, as signposting was delayed until the modified version was released, in which the road was called E28.

In the 1950-version of E-roads, signposted until after 1980, the road Berlin-Szczecin was the E74, while Szczecin-Minsk was not an E-road.
