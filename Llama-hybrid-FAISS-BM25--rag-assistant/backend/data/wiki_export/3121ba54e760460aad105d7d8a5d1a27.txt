BƒÅb Antakiya (, Aleppo Arabic: , "Gate of Antioch") is a critical defense gate in Aleppo, and protects the city from the west. Bab Antakiya is located in the centre of the western wall of the old city of Aleppo, and its name was derived from Antioch, the capital of ancient Syria, as the gate was the main exit which was leading to the city of Antioch.

This gate was considered the main bab of the city during the Byzantine rule, but it lost its importance gradually during the Islamic and Arab rule, until the reconstruction by the Ayyubid Emir of Aleppo An-Nasir Yusuf (ruled 1242-60) on an 11th-century base. It was further rebuilt in the 15th century in Mamluk era when the gate regained its vital role as a main landmark for the old city.
