The City Center District is served by the Dallas Independent School District.

The neighborhood schools for downtown are outside of the loop.

Four elementary schools—City Park, Sam Houston, Hope Medrano, and Ignacio Zaragoza; three middle schools—Billy Earl Dade, Thomas J. Rusk, and Alex W. Spence; and two high schools—James Madison and North Dallas, serve the district.

Private Schools

Holy Trinity Catholic School has served Dallas' central neighborhoods since 1914 and is located at the corner of Oak Lawn Avenue and Gilbert Avenue. Providing early education for three-year-olds through eighth grade, Holy Trinity is the oldest continually operating Catholic school in North Texas.

Residents are also served by First Baptist Academy of Dallas, a Biblically-integrated, college preparatory K-12 school located in the city center district of downtown Dallas.
