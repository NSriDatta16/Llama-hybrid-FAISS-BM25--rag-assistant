South Asian influence on other film industries

Indonesian cinema 

Last but not least is Indonesian cinema. In the beginning, Indonesian cinema grew after World War I, rooted in the Folk Theater Drama called Dardanela. Under Usmar Ismail, Indonesian cinema became the new entertainment from 1950 to 1980. Hundred of film stars were born, such as Citra Dewi (1960), and Tanty Yosepha (1970). Yenny Rachman and Christine Hakim (1980) and Dian Sastro (the late 1990s). Teguh Karya was one of the leading Film directors in Indonesia after the era of Usmar Ismail. Now, with the popularity of television, the film is replaced with electronic cinema which is popular as sinetron. This industry has made the Indian-born producer, Raam Punjabi, a tycoon of sinetron in Indonesia.
