Eternity Road: Reflections of Lowlife 85â€“95 is a compilation album released in 2006 by LTM, as part of their re-release of Lowlife's entire back catalogue.  It served as an introduction to the band and spanned their entire career.  Allmusic gave the album "4.5" stars (out of 5) and noted, "Eternity Road taken as a whole is so shockingly good that it's practically astonishing at how the group never gained greater attention or cachet during its lifetime -- in retrospect they easily deserve mention alongside groups like The Sound and most especially The Chameleons."
