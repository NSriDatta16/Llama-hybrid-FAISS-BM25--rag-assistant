Stateline is a television current affairs program that was produced by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. It provided analysis of state and municipal politics as well as insight into state and regional issues in a current affairs journalistic style. The program was known for its interviews with politicians, and for its coverage of important regional issues.

The program premiered on 16 February 1996 at 6pm. It moved to 7:30pm in February 2001, which resulted in The 7.30 Report being removed from Fridays.

The ABC announced in December 2010 that the state-based current affairs program Stateline would be folded into a new 7.30 brand from March 2011. The change saw 7.30 extended to five nights a week, although Friday editions were to be presented locally and focus on state affairs. The Friday state-based editions of 7.30 were eventually axed in December 2014.

Format

It was broadcast on ABC1 on Fridays at 7:30Â pm (in place of The 7.30 Report), with eight separate state and territory specific editions. It was also broadcast on the new digital channel ABC2 after its launch in March 2005.

With the launch of ABC News 24 in 2010, each local version of Stateline was also broadcast nationally on the channel over the weekend.
