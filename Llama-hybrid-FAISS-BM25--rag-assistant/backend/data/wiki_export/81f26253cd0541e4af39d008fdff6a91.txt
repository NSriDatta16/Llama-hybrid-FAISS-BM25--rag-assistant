Schritt für Schritt () is the debut solo album by German recording artist Nadja Benaissa. It was released by Universal Music Urban on February 24, 2006 in German-speaking Europe. Her first solo effort following the disbandment of her former band, No Angels, it signaled a breakaway from the group's Europop sound in favor of a more soul-influenced pop album with German lyrics. Benaissa co-wrote the whole album, which features production by Tino Oac and Giuseppe Porrello, with additional credits from DJ Release, Audiotreats and Fairtone. Upon its release, Schritt für Schritt underperformed, debuting and peaking at number 71 on the German Albums Chart.
