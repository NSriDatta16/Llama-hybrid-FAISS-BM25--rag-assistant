Rosenberg first lived in Malden and Revere becoming a foster child as a toddler and raised in foster care.

Bryon Hefner scandal 
In November 2017, it was reported that four men accused Rosenberg's estranged husband, Bryon Hefner, of sexual harassment, allegedly willing to trade his influence with Rosenberg in return for sexual favors. In December 2017, Rosenberg voluntarily stepped down as Senate President while an ethics probe into his possible role in the scandal began. Also in December 2017, The Boston Globe reported that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had opened an investigation of the matter.

On March 29, 2018, a state grand jury indicted Rosenberg's husband, Bryon Hefner, on charges of sexual assault, criminal lewdness, and distributing nude photographs without consent. Hefner faced the possibility of two years in a county jail and to up to five years in state prison.

On April 24, 2018, Hefner appeared in Suffolk Superior Court and pled not guilty to five counts of sexual assault, four counts of distributing nude images without consent, and one count of criminal lewdness. He was ordered not to enter the Massachusetts State House or to contact witnesses or victims.

On May 3, 2018, Rosenberg announced that he was resigning from the Senate, effective at 5 p.m. EDT on May 4. According to Boston.com, this announcement followed the release of an ethics report that claimed that Rosenberg "violated policy by giving Hefner access to his Senate email account despite a promise to his colleagues that he would build a firewall between his personal and professional life," and recommended that Rosenberg be barred from leadership positions through 2020.

In June 2018, a civil lawsuit was filed in the state of Massachusetts saying that Hefner sexually assaulted the plaintiff and alleged that Rosenberg  "knew or was aware" that Hefner posed a risk to others and he continually allowed Hefner access to lobbyists, State House staff members, and others. The lawsuit does not ask for specific damages on any of the six counts.

In September 2019, Hefner pleaded guilty to three counts, including indecent assault and battery, assault and battery and dissemination of a nude image. He was sentenced to three years on probation and required to register as a sex offender.

Personal
Rosenberg currently resides in Amherst. He was one of five openly LGBT members of the Massachusetts General Court, alongside Representatives Sarah Peake (D–Provincetown),  Kate Hogan (D–Stow), Denise Andrews (D–Orange) and Liz Malia (D–Jamaica Plain).

In January 2018, it was announced that Rosenberg and Hefner had separated while Hefner undergoes treatment for substance abuse issues.
