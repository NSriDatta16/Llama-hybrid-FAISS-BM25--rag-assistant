The Marine Region comprises approximately 3,000 officers overseeing around 13,000 local craft and a total maritime population of 14,100. In addition to normal marine policing functions, the marine police are also responsible for countering illegal immigration and smuggling at sea.

History
The Hong Kong 'Water Police' had a role from the earliest days of British Hong Kong. The first actual vessel was acquired in 1846 – a sailing 'gun-boat' with a crew of 17, which was used for anti-piracy work. The vessel and its entire crew were lost in a typhoon two years later. By then the unit consisted of approximately 40 men and three boats. Each Constable in a six-man crew was armed with a pistol and a cutlass.

After World War II, as part of a major reshaping of the police force, the service was renamed 'Marine Police'. During the 1966 Star Ferry riots, the Marine Police provided a riot company which was deployed in action on Nathan Road. As part of the response to the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests, the Marine Police participated in Operation Tiderider aimed at quelling the ensuing riots.
