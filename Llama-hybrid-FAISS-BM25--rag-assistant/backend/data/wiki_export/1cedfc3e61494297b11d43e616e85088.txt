Humor
In 1988, Barrett wrote and recorded the song "Find the Longest Path," a parody incorporating an NP-complete problem in computer science and the frustrations of graduate school. It has been played at mathematics conferences, incorporated into several YouTube videos by other people, and independently performed by a choral ensemble at ACM SIGCSE 2013. Computer scientist Robert Sedgewick ends his algorithms course on Coursera with this song.
