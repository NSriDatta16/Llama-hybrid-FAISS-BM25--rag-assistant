Candi & The Backbeat (initially named Candi) was a Canadian pop band fronted by lead vocalist Candita "Candi" Pennella. Band members included Nino (Big Papa) Milazzo (bass and background vocals), Paul (Baldy) Russo (drums and percussion), and Rich Imbrogno (keyboards). The band is best known among U.S. audiences for the freestyle classic "Dancing Under a Latin Moon", a major dance hit which also made number 68 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1988.
