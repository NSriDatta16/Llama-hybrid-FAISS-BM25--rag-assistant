Graduation requirements
Mt. Hope High School implements four graduation requirements. First, students will need to acquire 23 Carnegie Units (Credits) throughout their education. Credits from specific content areas must be obtained that amount to the required 23 credits. Second, students will need to demonstrate proficiency in a set of academic, social, and civic regulations known as "Proficiency-Based Graduation Requirements". These academic expectations include listening, speaking, reading, writing, and problem-solving effectively. Each student must score a grade of "Proficient" or higher. These regulations tie in with the new diploma system of the school; any student graduating in 2008 or later must average a score of "Proficient" in all the rubrics to be able to officially graduate Mt. Hope High School. They also have to create a digital portfolio, which is an online showcase of the student's best work. As the third graduation requirement, Mt. Hope students in the Class of 2015 and onward must have completed the New England Common Assessment Program with at least a score of "Proficient" in Math, English, and Science. Starting with the Class of 2014, the NECAP is planned to be replaced with the PARCC as the graduation requirement. Last, students are required to create an Individual Learning Plan (ILP). This ILP is able to be accessed through the digital portfolio and includes such components as an assessment of skills, values, interests, creation of goals, and is used in the course selection process.
