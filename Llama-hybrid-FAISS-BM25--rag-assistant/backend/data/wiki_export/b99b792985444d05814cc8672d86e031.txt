Alessandra, Princess of Bismarck (née Silvestri, later Silvestri-Lévy, born 1 November 1972, in São Paulo) is an Italo-Brazilian art writer and curator. As the wife of Carl-Eduard von Bismarck, she became the Princess of Bismarck in 2019.

A patron of the arts, she has produced and curated several exhibitions of photography, contemporary art, literature, and film festivals, mainly in Paris, São Paulo, and Havana.  She was the International Executive Director for the Brazilian Cinema Foundation (Cinemateca Brasileira).

Biography 
She was married between 1998 and 2014 to French diplomat Jean Levy, with whom she had two children. The godmother to the wedding was Danielle Mitterrand, widow of former French President François Mitterrand, a friend of the couple.

Silvestri-Lévy served as Consulesse General of France in São Paulo between 1998 and 2000. She then served as French ambassador in Havana, Cuba, between 2000 and 2004, where she co-produced the publication of the photographic collection of Alberto Korda, the Cuban photographer known for the Guerrillero Heroico photo. The collection was presented in the work Cuba por Korda, published in 2002, accompanied by texts by Silvestri-Levy and journalist Christophe Lovigny. The work was published in Brazil in 2004, being praised for the "well cared for edition" of Silvestri-Levy and Lovigny by the magazine Primeira Leitura, and the "beautiful Brazilian edition" of those authors, demonstrating the close relationship between photography and the Cuban Revolution, by the writer, and professor from Ceará, Edmilson Caminha.
