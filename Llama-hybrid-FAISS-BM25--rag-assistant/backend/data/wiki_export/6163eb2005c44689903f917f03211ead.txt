The depot at Wallingford was built in 1871 by the Hartford & New Haven Railroad on the Springfield Line, and was built in a French Second Empire style similar to that of the Windsor train station.

The original station building was closed to the public in 1994 and is now used for adult education and the New Haven Model Railroad Club. The line through Wallingford was double-tracked until 1990 when the second track was removed. The original Wallingford station building has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1993.

A temporary platform replaced the former station platform on April 25, 2016. The temporary platform was used until the new station was completed.

The existing commercial, industrial zone near the station, as part of the plan, will be replaced with medium- and high-density residential zoning. New commercial and residential development will be encouraged near the station and improvements will be made in the area of the station to connect to downtown Wallingford.
