Braddock Bay, sometimes improperly referred to as Braddock's Bay, is a small bay of Lake Ontario located in Monroe County northwest of Rochester, New York in the United States. Braddock Bay is renowned for being an excellent bird-watching location, as raptors and other birds congregate there when migrating north in spring.

History
The bay's name is derived from a "barbarous mispronunciation" of its original name, Prideaux Bay, which referred to British General John Prideaux. The name was first given after Prideaux and his force of 3,200 soldiers encamped at the bay in 1759, on their way to the Battle of Fort Niagara during the French and Indian War, where Prideaux would be killed. Initial mispronunciation of the bay's name led to some confusion with British General Edward Braddock, resulting in the bay's current name.

Braddock Bay Marina was home to United States Coast Guard Auxiliary Flotilla 45 from its creation in November 1974 until its dissolution at the end of 2011.

Land management
Much of the land in this complex of marshland and small bays is managed by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) as the  Braddock Bay Wildlife Management Area. The WMA was created in 1982 after the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation (NYSOPRHP) transferred all but approximately  of the former Braddock Bay State Park (established in 1956) to the NYSDEC. The remaining parcels were leased to the Town of Greece in 1981.

As of 2014, the NYSOPRHP retains ownership of  on the bay. Much of this property is maintained by the Town of Greece as Braddock Bay Park, which is located on the east side of the open bay and includes a hawk-watching station.
