Trivia
 Some of the tracks on the vinyl release are significantly shorter than the tracks on the CD versions.
 "Party til You Puke" was re-recorded and included on Andrew's first album, I Get Wet.
 "Dance Party" was re-worked into the song "Long Live the Party" for Andrew's second album; The Wolf.
 The original pressing of the vinyl version of this EP came with an insert.
 Andrew's first full-length release, according to the Bulb Records website as of the year 2000, was supposed to contain all of the tracks on this EP, plus 10 other tracks, which were to be remixes and brand new tracks. It was supposed to be in CD format, and only 1,000 copies were to be pressed. This plan was ultimately scrapped, and some of the tracks that were to be on the album went on to be included on Andrew's first and second major-label albums, I Get Wet and The Wolf.
 It was planned at one point in time that some of the tracks on this EP were to be incorporated into Andrew's second major label album, The Wolf.
