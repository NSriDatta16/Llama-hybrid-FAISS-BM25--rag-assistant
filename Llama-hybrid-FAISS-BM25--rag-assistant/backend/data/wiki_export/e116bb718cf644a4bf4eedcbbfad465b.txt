The Miss New Jersey Teen USA competition is the pageant that selects the representative for the state of New Jersey in the Miss Teen USA pageant.

New Jersey has had a moderated success at Miss Teen USA, with ten placements. In the first twenty years of the competition, New Jersey only recorded three placements; from 2003 they placed in four of five years. New Jersey's first top five placement came in 2003 when Jacklyn Pezzotta placed fourth runner-up, and this was bettered in 2007 when Alyssa Campanella placed 1st runner up.

Three New Jersey teens (2001, 2006, and 2008) have held the Miss New Jersey USA title and competed at Miss USA. Alyssa Campanella, Miss New Jersey Teen USA 2007, competed twice for Miss New Jersey USA, but relocated to California and won Miss California USA and won the title of Miss USA 2011, the first former Miss New Jersey Teen USA titleholder to win Miss USA, regardless of the representing state.

Isabella Galan of Wayne was crowned Miss New Jersey Teen USA 2022 on April 3, 2022 at Hilton Parsippany Hotel in Parsipanny. She will represent New Jersey for the title of Miss Teen USA 2022.
