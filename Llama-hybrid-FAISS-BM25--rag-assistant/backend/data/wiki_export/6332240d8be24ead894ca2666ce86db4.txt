Insineratehymn is the fifth studio album by American death metal band Deicide. The band's songwriting on this album exhibits songs with slower and more atmospheric grooves. The track "Bible Basher" is the only song that has become a staple in the band's live set. Rather than being about God, the song "Forever Hate You" is directed at Glen Benton's ex-wife. The song "The Gift That Keeps on Giving" is featured on "Pie-o-My" S4E5 of the television series The Sopranos.
