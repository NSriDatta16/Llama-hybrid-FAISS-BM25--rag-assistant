Cut Loose is the 1983 debut solo album by Paul Rodgers, of Free and Bad Company fame. Unlike his other work, Rodgers plays all the instruments on this album. It was recorded at his house in Kingstone.

The song "Live in Peace" was later re-recorded by Rodgers with his band The Firm for their second album Mean Business. "Superstar Woman" was originally recorded by Bad Company for their debut self-titled album, but it was ultimately left off the final track listing; Rodgers re-recorded it for this album. (The original Bad Company version was eventually released on The 'Original' Bad Co. Anthology in 1999.) The album peaked at #135 on the Billboard's 200 chart.
