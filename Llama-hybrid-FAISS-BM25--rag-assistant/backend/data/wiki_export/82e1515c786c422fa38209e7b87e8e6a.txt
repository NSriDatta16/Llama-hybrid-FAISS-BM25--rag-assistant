Seminole High School is a public high school located in Seminole, Oklahoma, operated by Seminole Public Schools.

As of the 2006–07 school year, the school had an enrollment of 482 students and 30.6 classroom teachers (on a FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 15.8.

In 2015, students were moved out of the high school due to safety concerns with the building that was originally built in 1930. In 2017, Seminole voters approved construction of a brand new high school to be built on the northwest side of the city. In January 2020, at the beginning of the second semester of the 2019–2020 school year, the students were moved out of the temporary building with the new facility having been completed.
