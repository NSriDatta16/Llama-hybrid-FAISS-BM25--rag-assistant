The S&W Ladysmith (later styled LadySmith) is a series of handguns manufactured by Smith & Wesson starting early in the first decade of the 20th century. Early models, branded were chambered in .22 Long. Starting in the 1980s, under the slightly modified "LadySmith" moniker, S&W manufactured several short-barreled revolvers and semi-automatic pistols.

History
Smith & Wesson has produced firearms over the years in several standard frame sizes. M-frame refers to the small early Ladysmith frame. Later LadySmith small revolvers were made on the somewhat larger J-frame, the standard S&W small-frame revolver.

The tiny M-frame .22" hand-ejector Ladysmith revolver was produced from 1902 through 1921, and later diminutive revolvers were termed LadySmith, capitalizing the "S".
