Kosova Press is a news agency headquartered in Pristina, Kosovo, which was established on January 4, 1999. Since that time, it has published information in these languages: Albanian, English, German, and French. It currently publishes in Albanian and English.

During the provisional stage under the international protectorate and due to the current political status of Kosovo, Kosova Press transformed into an independent news agency. Today, it has the status of an independent and free media house. It has mutually beneficial relations with many news agencies in the region and a network of correspondents. It is a member of SEEMO, ABNA, and the Association of Private News Agencies. [citation needed]
