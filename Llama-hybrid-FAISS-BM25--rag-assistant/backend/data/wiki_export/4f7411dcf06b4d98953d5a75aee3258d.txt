History
The area around present-day Kōnan Ward was part of Kuraki District in Musashi Province until the end of the Edo period, and was tenryō territory controlled directly by the Tokugawa shogunate, but administered through various hatamoto. 

After the Meiji Restoration, the area was transferred to the new Kanagawa Prefecture, and during the cadastral reform of April 1, 1889, Kamiooka village and several other villages were established. On October 1, 1927 the area was annexed by the neighboring city of Yokohama, becoming part of Naka Ward. The Shōnan Electric Railway, the predecessor to the Keikyū Main Line began operations from April 1, 1935 leading to the rapid urbanization of the area. In a major administrative reorganization of October 1, 1969, Kōnan was separated from Naka Ward, and became an independent Ward within Yokohama. The population exceeded 100,000 in ay 1970, and 200,000 in June 1984.

Economy
Kōnan Ward is largely a regional commercial center and bedroom community for central Yokohama and Tokyo.
