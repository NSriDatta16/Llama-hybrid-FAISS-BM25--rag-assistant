Live Phish Vol. 7 was recorded live at the World Music Theater in Tinley Park, Illinois, United States, on August 14, 1993.

Almost immediately, this concert became a sought after collectors item on the Phish bootleg circuit, as it seemed to define an era when Phish began breaking down many of its live performance boundaries. Whereas most shows before 1993 contained a distinct set of songs with specifically placed jams, many concerts in the summer of 1993 saw Phish experimenting with song segues and improvisation within sections of songs that were once tightly structured.

Here, the band floats in and out of "Run Like an Antelope" through most of the second set, switching from on-the-spot instrumental forays to unique and rare cover songs, all within the context of "Run Like an Antelope." Shortly after a massive jam session in "You Enjoy Myself," drummer Jon Fishman provides a bit of comic relief with a performance of Prince's "Purple Rain."
