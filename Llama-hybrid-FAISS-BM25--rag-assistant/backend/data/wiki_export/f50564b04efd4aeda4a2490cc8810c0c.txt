Ma Rong (; 79–166), courtesy name Jichang (), was a Chinese poet and politician of the Eastern Han dynasty. He was born in Youfufeng () in the former Han capital region, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi Province. His father Ma Yan (马严) was a son of Ma Yu (马余), an elder brother of the famed general Ma Yuan. He was known for his commentaries on the books on the Five Classics, and the first scholar known to have done this. He also developed the double column commentary while doing it. His notable students were Lu Zhi and Zheng Xuan.

He was suspended for ten years due to critical comments. Eventually he was restored to the Governor of Nan Commandery (modern Hubei). His biography appears in the Book of Later Han (volume 60, part 1). He wrote the Rhapsody on Long Flute (); the Song dynasty Classic of Loyalty (), patterned after the Classic of Filial Piety, bears attribution to his name.
