The Institute of Bill of Rights Law (IBRL), founded in 1982, is a center for the study of constitutional law at the William & Mary School of Law in Williamsburg, Virginia, United States. The IBRL focuses on enhancing a scholarly understanding of the nation's Bill of Rights by hosting an annual "Supreme Court Preview" that brings together constitutional and legal experts from law schools in the United States, as well as reporters and affiliates from the nation's news outlets. It also enables research fellows to conduct constitutional research with law professors at the law school, and co-sponsors the Constitutional Conflicts book series with Duke University Law School. The Institute of Bill of Rights Law sponsors events such as Constitutional Originalism debates and various symposiums.
