The Buffalo Wings are an inline hockey team, playing in Major League Roller Hockey and formerly in Roller Hockey International, that is based in the city of Buffalo, New York.

History 
The Buffalo Wings franchise was originally the Phoenix Cobras from 1994 to 1995, and the Empire State Cobras in 1996.

The 1996 Cobras consisted of former Buffalo Stampede players who joined the team after their franchise folded following the 1995 Roller Hockey International season.

Relocated from Glen Falls, New York and renamed as the Buffalo Wings, the team played the 1997 season at the Marine Midland Arena. The arrival of the Wings marked the return of professional roller hockey to Buffalo, having been the home of the short-lived Buffalo Stampede, which played at the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium from 1994-1995. From 1998-1999, the team played at the Buffalo State Sports Arena at Buffalo State College.

Following the demise of Roller Hockey International, the organization continues to exist to this day as a youth hockey development organization. The professional team has been revived at least once (in 2004) in the Professional Inline Hockey Association.

The Wings were announced as one of the six teams participating in the 2008 Major League Roller Hockey Pro Tour.
