Norway was the host nation for the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer.  It was the second time that Norway had hosted the Winter Olympic Games, after the 1952 Games in Oslo.  In 1994, Norway finished second in the medal ranking to Russia, with strong results in the skiing events.

During the games, Norway set a record: most gold medals won by a host nation, with 10. The United States tied it when they hosted the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, but Canada broke it during the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.

Withdrawn from Figure Skating and Bobsleigh
As the host country, Norway automatically qualified spots to the 1994 Olympics. In 1992, however, the Norwegian Olympic Committee announced that skaters aspiring to be selected for Norway would have to finish in the top 12 at the European or World Championships. Since none met this requirement, Norway to withdraw from all the events. Although Leslie Monod / Cédric Monod's result at the 1993 World Championships allowed Switzerland to send two pairs to the Olympics, the Swiss Olympic Association elected not to send a pair after the Monods finished 11th at the 1994 European Championships.
