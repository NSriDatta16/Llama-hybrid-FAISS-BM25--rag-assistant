Candace Glendenning (born 9 August 1953) is a retired English actress, known for her work in the horror film genre in the 1970s as a "scream queen". She also had a career in British television throughout the late 60s to early 80s.

Career

She began her career as a child actress cast in one of the headlining roles of the  six-part children's serial drama, The Tyrant King (1968). She also had an un-credited role as a schoolgirl in the film adaptation of The Prime of Miss Jean Brody (1969), opposite Maggie Smith.

In 1971, she played the Grand Duchess Maria Romanov in the film, Nicholas and Alexandra (1971). Glendenning and her co-stars Ania Marson, Lynne Frederick, and Fiona Fullerton headlined the film's press tour. That same year, at the age of 18, she auditioned for the role of Clare of Assisi in the Franco Zeffirelli production of Brother Sun, Sister Moon (1972), but was considered to be "too exotic looking" for the part.

She then appeared in two slasher horror films back to back. The first was a small role in the Tower Of Evil (1972), and despite her part being small, the image of her character running nude, covered in blood, and carrying a dagger, featured prominently in the film's promotional material (most notably the posters and trailers). The film was a critical and commercial flop and dismissed as a mere exploitation film.

Her next appearance was a supporting role in The Flesh and Blood Show (1972). Like Tower of Evil, this film also featured nudity and a great deal of violence. 

Despite a lack of offers for further films, she had success working as a television actress. In 1972, she appeared in an episode of the costume drama, The Strauss Family, and guest starred in an episode of The Main Chance, where she played a spiritual hippy. From 1971 to 1973, she appeared in three episodes of the BBC television anthology series, BBC Play of the Month. She also appeared in an episode of the comedy drama series Ripping Yarns and an episode of the science fiction series, Blake's 7, in which she played Rashel, a liberated bond-slave.

She made her final feature film appearance in the 1976 independent horror film, Satan's Slave. The film's director, Norman J Warren,  sought her out to be in the project, having been an admirer of her previous horror films. This role turned out to be her biggest starring role, in which she played an independent and spirited young woman who, after surviving a car accident in which her parents are seemingly killed.  She is taken in by her uncle and cousin (played by Michael Gough and Martin Potter), unaware that they are both necromancers who intend to sacrifice her to resurrect the spirit of a supernaturally-gifted ancestor.   Although her performance was well received by critics, the film itself was panned and failed to turn a profit.

After the failure of her last theatrical film, she continued to work in television roles.  In 1980, she appeared on five episodes of the BBC series Flesh and Blood, in which she played an elegant secretary. She was also reunited with Michael Jayston, who had played her father in Nicholas and Alexandra nearly ten years before. Glendenning's last role was a guest spot in a 1983 episode of the medical drama series, Angels.
