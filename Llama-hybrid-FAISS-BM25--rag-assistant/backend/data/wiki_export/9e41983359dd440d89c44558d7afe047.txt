Temple
Sam Shan Kwok Wong Temple () is located next to the estate, along Kwun Tong Road. “Sam Shan” refers to three famous mountains of Chaozhou in Guangdong, namely Du Shan, Ming Shan and Jin Shan. There are many legendary stories about this. One of them is about the Lords of the Three Mountains who had assisted the Emperor Song Tai Zu to put down the revolt between Liu and Zhang, and so the Deities were granted the title as Lords of the Three Mountains. The Hakkas also worship the Deities and would build a temple in their new migrated place. The temple has been renovated for several times. At the end of the lunar year, there will also be a small flower fair at the open area outside the temple.
