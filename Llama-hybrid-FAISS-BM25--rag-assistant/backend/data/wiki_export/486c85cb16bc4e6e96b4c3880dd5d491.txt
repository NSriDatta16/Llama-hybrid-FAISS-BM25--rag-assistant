Six/Nine is the eighth studio album by the Japanese rock band Buck-Tick. It was released in a clear purple case on May 15, 1995, through Victor Entertainment.

The album was digitally remastered and re-released on September 19, 2002, with a bonus track. The album remastered once again and released on September 5, 2007, in a clear red case.

The single "Uta" is band's 2nd best-selling single, with over 200,000 copies sold.

Issay (Der Zibet) provides vocals for "Itoshi no Rock Star".

Controversy
The hard-industrial rock song "Rakuen (Inori Koinegai)" (4:48) was released as a B-side of single "Kodou". It also has a music video, but the accompanied version was from the studio album (4:37) which oriental composition and arrangement is in instrumental-acoustic style. During the tours the band usually performed the original rock version. 

Sakurai's lyrics are socially conscious and critical of the people seeing the political and war situation in the Middle East. They talk how in a country/garden of love and peace (Garden of Eden) suddenly there is bloodshed, children of God kill each other with gunfire, but on the TV it is showcased as a melodrama while "I" (Sakurai, in other sense, the listener/viewer) is indifferent, pretends to show tears and shuts their eyes (willful blindness).

The song caused controversy because some of the lyrics were lifted from the Quran and later the album was re-issued with the offending part removed by November 1995 in a clear case.
