Sinfin is a suburb of Derby, England,  southwest of the city centre on its southern outskirts. The ward, which includes Osmaston as well as Sinfin itself, had a population of 15,128 in 2011. Historically, Sinfin and Osmaston were separate villages before being swallowed up by the expansion of Derby. Osmaston is characterised by inter-war housing developments while much of the housing in Sinfin is post-war. Between the two suburbs lies a more industrialised area dominated by the Rolls-Royce works.

History

Sinfin is recorded in the Domesday Book produced in 1086 as Sedenfeld as a manor that belonged to baron Henry de Ferrers. Mention is made of two carucates of land assessed to the geld; land for one plough and two villeins having another and of  of meadow. The land was valued at ten shillings. Its undertenant was named William, later William de Rolleston, a vassal to Henry de Ferrers, who displaced a Saxon thegn named Ulfkell. Today the Ferrers name is still seen in Sinfin.

Sinfin now has two distinct areas – the "new" and the "old"; it also merges with the Stenson Fields district of South Derbyshire to the south.
The "old" part is bordered to the north by the Derby – Crewe railway. Here, at the outset of WW2, was built a substantial ordnance depot. This was protected by a series of pillboxes, gun emplacements and barrage balloons. Most of this is now built over but some evidence remains.

It once had a railway passenger station — Sinfin Central railway station — at which passenger trains last called in May 1993.
