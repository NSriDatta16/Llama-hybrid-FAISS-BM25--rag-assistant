Geography
The park is 66.34 km2. The park landscape includes the southern portion of Woss Lake, as well as very steep forested slopes above the lake and the permanent snowfields and north facing slopes of Rugged Mountain, part of the Haihte Range.

Conservation

The park contains Roosevelt elk populations, a salmon fishery and potentially, habitat for the endangered Vancouver Island marmot.
