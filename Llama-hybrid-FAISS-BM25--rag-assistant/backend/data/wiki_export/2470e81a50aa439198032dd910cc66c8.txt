David McCord Lippincott (17 June 1924 â€“ January 1984) was an American composer, lyricist and novelist.

Education
David McCord Lippincott wrote music and lyrics from an early age. The first evidence of that is a musical revue he wrote while attending the Hotchkiss School called "Little Boy Blue". He then went to Yale University, as did his father; was a member of Skull & Bones, as was his father William Jackson Lippincott. He graduated in 1949.

Work
After college, Lippincott worked for McCann Erickson as a creative director, writing copy and creating jingles.  His original album musical, The Body in the Seine has become a collector's item.

During this time, he also wrote books, several of which are still available. Some of the writings were turned into films.
