History

1980–1998
The company's first production was Raj Khosla's Dostana (1980) starring Amitabh Bachchan, Shatrughan Sinha, and Zeenat Aman. The film was the highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year.

The company then went on to produce Duniya (1984) and Muqaddar Ka Faisla (1987), neither of which performed well at the box office. This was followed by Agneepath (1990), which was not a box office success at that time, but would later become a cult film. It also won a National Film Award for its lead actor Amitabh Bachchan. The company's next two films Gumrah (1993) and Duplicate (1998), which were both directed by Mahesh Bhatt, met with moderate success at the box office.

All the 4 films mentioned above, namely Duniya, Muqaddar Ka Faisla, Agneepath and Gumrah, were based on the same broad theme, which may be termed The Count of Monte Christo theme, where the protagonist is falsely accused and imprisoned for a crime which they did not commit and emerges from jail to exact vengeance from those who had framed them.
