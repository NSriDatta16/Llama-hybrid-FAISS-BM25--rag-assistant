No One's Gonna Change Our World is a charity album released in the United Kingdom on 12 December 1969 for the benefit of the World Wildlife Fund.

The compilation, assembled by comedian Spike Milligan, includes two tracks from Milligan and one from his Goon Show castmate Harry Secombe, and features liner notes by Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. It is widely known by fans of the Beatles as the first release of the song "Across the Universe"; its title is adapted from one of the song's lyrics; "Nothing's gonna change my world". It was also the first release of the Hollies song "Wings", one of the last songs they recorded with Graham Nash in early 1968.

The album was released on Regal Starline as catalogue number SRS 5013.
