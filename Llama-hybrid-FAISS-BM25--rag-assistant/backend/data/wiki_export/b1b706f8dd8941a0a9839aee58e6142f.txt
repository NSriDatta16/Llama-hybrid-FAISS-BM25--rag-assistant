Bound Brook is a New Jersey Transit railroad station on the Raritan Valley Line, in Bound Brook, New Jersey.  The station building on the north side of the tracks is now a restaurant; the other station building on the south side is now privately owned.  A pedestrian tunnel connects the south and north sides of the tracks.

The Norfolk Southern Railway's Lehigh Line, the railroad's main freight line into the New York City area – built and formerly owned by the Lehigh Valley Railroad until merged into Conrail – is a few yards south of the south platform and is used by around 25 freight trains a day. The Lehigh Valley Railroad used a separate station to the south.

History

The station on the north side of the tracks replaced the original station (circa 1847-1848) that was located on the south side of the tracks as built by the Elizabethtown and Somerville Railroad.

Bound Brook station was listed on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places and the  National Register of Historic Places in 1984 as part of the Operating Passenger Railroad Stations Thematic Resource.
