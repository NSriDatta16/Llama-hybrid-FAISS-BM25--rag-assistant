West Shore Community College is a public community college in Scottville, Michigan.

History
In 1967 West Shore was established on 365 acres between Ludington and Manistee in Mason County, Michigan. Along with this main campus, West Shore also has a center in Manistee County, just north of the city of Manistee.

Planning for the college began in 1962 with high school superintendents from three adjacent counties meeting to discuss the possibility of a community college in their districts. In September 1968, part-time faculty members were hired to teach evening courses at local high schools. The first permanent structure was the Campus Center (now the Administrative Building), which was dedicated in the spring of 1970; prior to this, classes were held in six relocatable classrooms the college had purchased.

Since 1967, West Shore Community college has experienced growth in student body as well as facilities. From an initial enrollment in the fall of 1968 of 118 students and an initial graduating class of 62 students, the college has grown to a current enrollment close to 1,200 students, with the most recent graduation class consisting of nearly 140 students eligible to receive degrees or certificates.

Growth in facilities includes the following: In 2002, an 18,000 sq. ft. state-of-the-art science wing was added to the Arts and Sciences Center and West Shore Community College opened a 36,000 sq. ft. ice arena.  In 2006, Manistee County Education Center, a partnership between the college and West Shore Medical Center, opened in Manistee. In 2008, the 38,000 sq. ft. Schoenherr Campus Center opened for students.
