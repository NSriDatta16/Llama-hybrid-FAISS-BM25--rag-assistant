Us Girls is a BBC Television sitcom about the culture gap among three generations of West Indian women.

Freelance journalist Bev Pinnock (Campbell in series one; Blackman in series two) was trying to live an independent life, which was being interrupted by her teenage daughter Aisha (Gordon) and her motherâ€”Grandma (Hammond). They all shared a house in the first series. In series 2, the grandparents had moved across the road, but were still able to watch Bev and Aisha.
