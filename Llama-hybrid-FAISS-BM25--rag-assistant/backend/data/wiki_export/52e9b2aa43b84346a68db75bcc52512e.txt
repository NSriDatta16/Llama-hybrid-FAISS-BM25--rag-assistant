When the Chilean fleet was dispersed in 1826, Simpson went into the reserve and took command of the Peruvian ship Congreso. In 1827, he took command of a Mexican ship also named Congreso. He finally returned to Chile in 1829 and named the Naval Governor of Coquimbo. From 1830 to 1836, Simpson commanded the Aquiles and in December 1834 became the first Chilean hydrographer.
