De Pere High School (DPHS) is a public high school located in De Pere, Wisconsin. Founded in 1870, it serves students in grades 9 through 12. It is the only high school in the Unified School District of De Pere.

History 

Until 1870, schooling for all grades in De Pere, Wisconsin was held in one building; starting in 1870, a high school was located in a stone building on the corner of James Street and Wisconsin Street. During the back half of the 1890s, plans were made for a new high school at the corner of Chicago Street and Broadway. A fire ravaged the stone school on February 20, 1900; it was demolished in 1906 after sitting dormant. After spending the rest of the term at the local German Benevolent Society Hall, the school located at Chicago and Broadway opened in fall 1900. It was quickly nicknamed the "Castle School" or "Castle on the Hill" due to its architecture and topographic situation. In 1978, the current high school was built at 1700 Chicago Street. It underwent major expansion in 2001, with the addition of a gymnasium and several classrooms. In January 2007, more classrooms were added. In 2017, De Pere High School underwent another small expansion. De Pere High School's mascot is the Redbird.

In 2005, the school received a cease-and-desist order on the grounds that its mascot was copyrighted material of Illinois State University. The school eventually redesigned the logo so as to not violate the copyright.

In 2016, Newsweek included DPHS on its list of best high schools for low-income students.

Demographics 
The school is 90 percent white, three percent Hispanic, two percent black, two percent Asian, and one percent American Indian.

Athletics 
De Pere High School is a member of the Fox River Classic Conference, and its athletic teams are nicknamed the Redbirds. Redbird athletic teams had been a member of the Bay Conference.

In late 2019, the school revealed plans for a $3 million renovation of its football stadium, which would add 600 seats to the home grandstand and establish a permanent 500-seat visitors grandstand.

Performing arts 
The school fields two show choirs, Chicago Street Singers and Jam Session. In 2020, the school hosted a show choir competition, "Destination De Pere: Let's Jam!", and while event organizers claimed it was the first one hosted at De Pere, the school hosted a competition named "Big Jam" from 1996 to 1999.
