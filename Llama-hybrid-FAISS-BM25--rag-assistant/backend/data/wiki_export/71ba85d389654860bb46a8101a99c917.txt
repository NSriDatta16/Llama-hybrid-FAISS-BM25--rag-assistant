John Kiran Fernandes (born November 21, 1975) is an American multi-instrumentalist musician.

Professional career
Fernandes, along with several other members of the Elephant Six Collective, joined the acclaimed psychedelic pop group The Olivia Tremor Control in Athens, GA in 1994. Fernandes was also a member of the side-project Black Swan Network.

Upon that band's demise, Fernandes went on to form the Athens-based group Circulatory System with other members of Olivia Tremor Control, most notably Will Cullen Hart.

In addition, Hart and Fernandes started a record label in 2001 called Cloud Recordings, which issued the Circulatory System's self-titled first album. Fernandes frequently contributes to multiple Athens-based bands' live shows and recordings. He currently plays with Circulatory System, The New Sound of Numbers, Old Smokey, Freehand, Lavender Holyfield, Jacob Morris - Moths, and Dream Boat. He has also recently been performing his own live solo shows, and has performed as part of the Elephant 6 Collective's occasional tours.

He released an album of solo material in February 2011 under the name John Kiran Fernandes. He released a second album of solo material in November 2015.

Fernandes works at Wuxtry Records in Athens, where one of his co-workers was Danger Mouse.
