Grind Finale is a two-CD compilation album by Swedish grindcore band Nasum. It covers the band's entire career, with songs from all the 15 studio recordings between 1993 and 2004, including 21 previously-unreleased songs.

The original title for the compilation was Blueprint for Extinction, but after the death of Nasum frontman Mieszko Talarczyk, the remaining band members felt that the word "extinction" made the title inappropriate. The band started to think of a play on words with "Grind" somewhere in the title, and ended up with "Grind Finale" since it would be the final major release from Nasum.

The lyrics of the song "Erased" are almost entirely derived from a frequently quoted passage in Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's The General Idea of the Revolution in the Nineteenth Century.
