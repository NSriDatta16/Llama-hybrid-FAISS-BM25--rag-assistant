The term  generally refers to weekly magazines published in Japan, including politically provocative weekly tabloid newspapers.

As noted by Watanabe and Gamble in the Japan Media Review and in their book A Public Betrayed, the genre is "often described as bizarre blends of various types of U.S. magazines, such as Newsweek, The New Yorker, People, Penthouse, and The National Enquirer.

In Japan, weekly magazines have been a source of anti-semitic articles, including Shukan Bunshun, Marco Polo, and Shukan Shincho, which have repeatedly published articles denying the Holocaust.  Shukan Shincho was ordered by the Supreme Court of Japan to pay damages to a Soka Gakkai member for publishing an unsubstantiated allegation of murder, and has been criticized for sensationalistic stories regarding a disputed Paleolithic settlement site in Japan. The magazine has also been rebuked for publishing the names and photographs of minors who have been accused of criminal acts, even before their trials began.
