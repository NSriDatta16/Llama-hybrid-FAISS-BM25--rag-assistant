Unia Tarnów was a Polish multi-sports club, based in Tarnów, Poland, whose legacy is continued by several separate club still carrying the same name.

The club was stablished in 1928 as a football club, which continues to play to this day, and athletics club. The club is best known for its motorcycle speedway team, founded in 1957, becoming independent in 2001. Over time many sections of the club have become independent entities in their own right but keeping the historical name. Since the last re-organisation in 2010 all sections of the club had become independent with the exception of the football and athletics sections. By 2013 only the football club was left and had therefore de facto ceased to exist as a multi-sports club. The football club did however create a futsal section in 2019.
