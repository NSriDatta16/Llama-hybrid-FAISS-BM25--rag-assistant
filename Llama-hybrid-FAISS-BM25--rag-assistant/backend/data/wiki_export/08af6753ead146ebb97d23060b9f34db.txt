Events

January 8 - Frank Chance is named as the new manager of the New York Highlanders. However, Chance is never able to reproduce the success he had in Chicago as the manager of the Cubs, and he leaves New York going 117-168 during his tenure. 
February 17 – The Missouri Court of Appeals holds that a fan injured by a foul ball at a 1910 Kansas City Blues game was not entitled to damages from the team since he had chosen to sit in a seat unprotected by a screen when such seats were available, establishing the Baseball Rule in United States tort law.
April 9 – Ebbets Field opens.
June 14 - Ray Schalk hits his first career home one, off of Walter "Big Train" Johnson. 
October 11 – The Philadelphia Athletics defeat the New York Giants, 3–1, in Game 5 of the World Series to win the World Championship, four games to one. The Giants thus become the second club, following the Detroit Tigers of 1907–1909, to lose three consecutive World Series; and, to date, the last to do so.
November 2 – George Stovall, former St. Louis Browns player-manager, became the first Major Leaguer to jump to the outlaw Federal League after signing a contract to manage the Kansas City Packers.
December 3- Upset that the Brooklyn Dodgers will not give him a raise, Joe Tinker makes the jump to the Federal League. Tinker is named player/manager of the Chicago Whales for $12,000 in salary.
