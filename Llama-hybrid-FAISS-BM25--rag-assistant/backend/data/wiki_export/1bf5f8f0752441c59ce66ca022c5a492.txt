"Disremembrance" is a song written by David Green and Ian Masterson for Australian singer Dannii Minogue's third studio album, Girl (1997). The song was produced by Flexifinger and received a positive reception from music critics. It was released by Eternal and Warner Music Group as the third single on 16 March 1998 and peaked at number 21 in the United Kingdom. In Australia, the song narrowly missed peaking within the top 50, reaching number 53 and spending five weeks in the top 100.

Critical reception
A reviewer from Music Week declared the song as "a equally fast-paced, Europop hit — worthy of a Eurovision Song Contest entrant. Produced by Flexifinger and with remixes by the same, Twyce As Nice and Trouser Enhusiasts, the hook isn't quite strong enough for it to hang around in the charts, but it will sell."
