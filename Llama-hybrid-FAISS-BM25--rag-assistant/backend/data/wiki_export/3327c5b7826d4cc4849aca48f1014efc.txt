Julius Duboc (October 10, 1829 Hamburg - June 11, 1903) was a German author and philosopher.

Biography
Karl Julius Duboc was the brother of the writer and painter Charles Edouard Duboc (1822 - 1910). He studied in Leipzig, Giessen, and Berlin. During his studies he became a member of the Cattia Gießen fraternity in 1849. He also became a student of Ludwig Feuerbach.

In his philosophical writings, Duboc propagated a form of ethically reverent atheism and defended optimism in opposition to Arthur Schopenhauer's pessimism. He critiqued Friedrich Nietzsche in his 1897 "Anti-Nietzsche" (Dresden: Helmuth Henkler). He also published historical works as well as essays and novellas. He died in Niederlößnitz in 1903 and was cremated in the Crematorium Gotha.
