Chungseon of Goryeo (20 October 1275 – 23 June 1325) , born Wang Won (Hangul: 왕원, Hanja: 王謜), later changed his name to Wang Jang (Hangul: 왕장, Hanja: 王璋), was the 26th ruler of the Goryeo Dynasty of Korea. He reigned in 1298, and again from 1308 to 1313.

He is sometimes known by his Mongolian name, Ijir Bukhqa (益知禮普花). Adept at calligraphy and painting, rather than politics, he generally preferred the life in Khanbaliq (the capital of the Yuan Empire, present-day Beijing) to that in Gaegyeong (the capital of Goryeo, present-day Kaesong). He was the eldest son of King Chungryeol and Queen Jangmok, a daughter of Kublai Khan.

Biography
In 1277, King Chungseon was confirmed as Crown Prince; the following year he travelled to China and received his Mongolian name.

In 1296, he married Borjigin Budashiri, a Yuan princess and great-granddaughter of Kublai Khan. However, he already had three Korean wives, who were daughters of the powerful nobles.

King Chungseon's mother died in 1297, and this was followed by a violent purge brought on by allegations that she had been murdered. Perhaps upset by these events, King Chungnyeol petitioned Yuan to abdicate the throne and was accordingly replaced by his son in 1298. Faced with intense plotting between the faction of his Mongol Queen and his Korean wife, Royal Consort Jo of the Pungyang Jo clan, King Chungseon returned the throne to his father shortly thereafter.

He received a new title, the Prince of Shenyang, in 1307 or 1308. After his father's death in 1308, King Chungseon was obliged to return to the throne of Goryeo and made efforts to reform court politics, but spent as much time as possible in China. In 1310, his Chinese title was changed to Prince of Shen. He is a very rare case of personal unions in East Asia.

He retired from the throne in 1313, and was replaced by his son, Wang Do. After the death of Emperor Renzong of Yuan (元仁宗), King Chungseon was briefly sent into exile to Tibet (lately Sakya), but was permitted to return to Khanbaliq soon thereafter, where he died in 1325.
