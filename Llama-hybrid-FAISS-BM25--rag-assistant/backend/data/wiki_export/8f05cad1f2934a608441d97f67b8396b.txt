He has composed several singles for other artists, in addition to releasing music of his own. Tebey has landed seven songs in the top ten of the Canada Country airplay chart, including the number one hit "Who's Gonna Love You" in 2018.

Early life
He started singing in church at the age of five and then began to sing at local events. In 1990 and again in 1994, he won the 14-and-under male division of the Canadian Open Country Singing Contest, and in 1996 and 1998, the 18-and-under male division. At 15, he signed a development deal with a major Nashville record label and moved to that city with his father, a Nigerian-born electronics engineer, with his mother and siblings staying back at their family home in Burlington, Ontario.

After three years, he and his father returned to Burlington. Ottoh was a high school football player at Assumption Catholic High School. But his Nashville career took a belated turn as Ottoh was signed to BNA Records as a singer and Warner Chappell Music as a staff songwriter in 2000.  Soon after, he signed fellow Canadian Bruce Allen as his manager.

Career
In 2002 and 2003, his performance of "We Shook Hands (Man to Man)" became a charted country radio hit in the United States and Canada. Tebey was the subject of a segment on CBC Radio's Sounds Like Canada, and nominated for a 2004 Canadian Radio Music Award for Best New Group or Solo Artist (Country), against Damian Marshall, Deric Ruttan, Heather Dawn and Jason Blaine.

Returning to Canada, Tebey became a professional songwriter in popular music outside of country.

As a country music artist Tebey has had several hit singles in Canada.  His songs "Somewhere In The Country" and "Till It's Gone" were Top 10 radio hits in 2012 and 2013 respectively.  In 2014, Tebey's country cover of Avicii's "Wake Me Up" reached No. 5 on the Canadian country music radio airplay chart and has sold in excess of 40,000 copies, being certified Canadian Gold. In 2014 Tebey signed a record deal with Road Angel Entertainment, a sub label of the parent company, Warner Music Canada. In February 2018 Tebey released the first single "Denim on Denim" off his EP Love a Girl.

In 2019, Tebey launched his own record label, Jayward Artist Group, with management executive Jill Snell. He signed himself and Quebecois country artist Matt Lang to the new label. His third album The Good Ones was released on the new label in January 2021. It includes the singles "Good Jeans", "Happened on a Saturday Night", "Shotgun Rider", "Song of the Summer", and the title track "The Good Ones", a duet with pop artist Marie-Mai.
