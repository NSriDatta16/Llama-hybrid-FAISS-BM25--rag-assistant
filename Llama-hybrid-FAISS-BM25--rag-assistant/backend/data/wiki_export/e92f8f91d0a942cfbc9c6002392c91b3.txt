The Force Element Groups (FEGs) of the Australian Defence Force are the operational capabilities.

Each of the component commands has a set of FEGs. The FEG operational commanders report to the component commanders (COMAUSFLT/CFC/ACAUST), who in turn report to the operation's Task Force commander. The FEG commanders are either of Captain (naval)/Colonel/Group Captain rank, or one-star rank for larger FEGs (Commodore/Brigadier/Air Commodore). The component commanders are of two-star rank (Rear Admiral/Major General/Air Vice Marshal).

Maritime FEGs
There are two parts to the Royal Australian Navy (RAN)'s structure. One is an operational command, Fleet Command, and the other is a support command, Navy Systems Command. The Navy's assets are administered by seven Force Element Groups (FEGs), which report to the Commander Australian Fleet (COMAUSFLT).

The seven Maritime FEGs are: 
 Australian Navy Surface Combatants Force,
 Amphibious Warfare Forces along with the Afloat Support Force,
 Naval Aviation Force, (Fleet Air Arm (FAA) formally: Australian Navy Aviation Group),
 Australian Navy Submarine Force, (Royal Australian Navy Submarine Service),
 Mine Warfare and Clearance Diving Forces,
 Australian Navy Patrol Boat Force and the
 Australian Navy Hydrographic Force (Royal Australian Navy Hydrographic Service).
