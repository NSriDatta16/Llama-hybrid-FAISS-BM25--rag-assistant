The Gap is the fourth full-length album by Joan of Arc. It released in 2000 on Jade Tree Records.

Production
The album was made almost entirely using ProTools.

Critical reception
Exclaim! wrote: "With each album, the band pushes their craftsmanship for the obscure even further, and The Gap is a prime result of this." The Chicago Tribune deemed the album "a frustrating, daring and sometimes unlistenable entry in the band's canon." PopMatters wrote that it "may be one of the most unlistenable albums in existence."
