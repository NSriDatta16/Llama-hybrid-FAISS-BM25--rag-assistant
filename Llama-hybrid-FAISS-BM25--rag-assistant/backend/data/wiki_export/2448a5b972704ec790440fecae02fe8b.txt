Campbell Hall School is an independent, coeducational,  episcopal, K–12 day school located in the Studio City neighborhood of the city of Los Angeles, California, United States.  Founded in 1944 by the Reverend Alexander Campbell, the school has an enrollment of approximately 1,000 students from kindergarten through high school.  It has programs in athletics, music, drama, dance and all other major academic areas. The school features a developed Performing Arts Program. Students in kindergarten through grade twelve participate in dance, voice, instrumental and drama programs. Orchestra and a World Music Program are available for grades 7–12.

History 
The school opened in 1944 as a kindergarten to sixth grade school at the St. David's Parish Sunday School building at 4343 Radford Avenue in Studio City. It moved to its current site in the 1945–46 school year. It gradually expanded to include junior high school, a girls high school, and the acceptance of boys for all levels in the mid-1980s. The Fourth R, a film made in the late 1940s explains the founding of the school based on a need for religion in the daily education of the school's students. The chapel program continues this tradition. Since its founding, Campbell Hall School has had three headmasters: the Rev. Alexander Campbell, the founder; the Rev. Canon Thomas G. Clarke, who served in this position for 32 years and the current as of July 1, 2003, headmaster, the Rev. Julian Bull. http://www.campbellhall.org/about_us/history2000.aspx
