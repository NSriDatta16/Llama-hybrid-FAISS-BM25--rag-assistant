History
The history of Damolândia began in 1918 when Antônio Dâmaso da Sila and his family, from Patrocínio, Minas Gerais settled on the banks of the Ribeirão Capoeirão.  There he set up a saw mill and began to divide the land that he had acquired from João Pires, hoping to start a new town.  In 1925 the settlement was elevated to the category of district of Anápolis and in 1928 a road was opened connecting it to Anápolis and Inhumas.  In 1958 it became a municipality on its own taking the name of Damolândia honoring its founder.
