After the break-up of the Soviet Union, Andrey Soloviev covered many armed conflicts, including in Nagorno-Karabakh, Transnistria, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, South Ossetia. He also filmed the aftermath of the 1988 Armenian earthquake, the collapse of the regime of Nicolae Ceaușescu, and was in Iraq during the Gulf War.

His photographs received numerous awards, including the World Press Photo prize.
