Vanadium(III) bromide, also known as vanadium tribromide, describes the inorganic compounds with the formula VBr3 and its hydrates.  The anhydrous material is a green-black solid.  In terms of its structure, the compound is polymeric with octahedral vanadium(III) surrounded by six bromide ligands.

VBr3 has been prepared by treatment of vanadium tetrachloride with hydrogen bromide:
2 VCl4  + 8 HBr  →  2 VBr3  +  8 HCl  +  Br2
The  reaction proceeds via the unstable vanadium(IV) bromide (VBr4), which releases Br2 near room temperature.

Like VCl3, VBr3 forms red-brown soluble complexes with dimethoxyethane and THF, such as mer-VBr3(THF)3.

Aqueous solutions prepared from VBr3 contain the cation trans-[VBr2(H2O)4]+.  Evaporation of these solutions give the salt trans-[VBr2(H2O)4]Br.(H2O)2.
