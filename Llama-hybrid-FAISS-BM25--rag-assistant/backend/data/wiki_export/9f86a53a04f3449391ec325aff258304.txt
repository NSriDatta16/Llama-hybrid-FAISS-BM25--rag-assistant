Capenhurst tower
In 1999 the journalist Duncan Campbell published claims that a  tower on the premises of the uranium enrichment plant had been used to intercept telephone calls transmitted by microwave between the British Telecom towers at Gwaenysgor, Clwyd, and Pale Heights, near Chester.  Campbell claimed that the interception was conducted by the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), initially from a temporary installation on the roof of the plant until commissioning of the tower in 1990.

The main route for phone calls between Ireland and the United Kingdom was via the submarine fibre optic cable UK-Ireland 1, landed at Holyhead, Anglesey, then transmitted by a microwave link.  Campbell claimed that calls were monitored by GCHQ until 1998 when the Irish telecommunication system was changed.

The tower was demolished in 2004.
