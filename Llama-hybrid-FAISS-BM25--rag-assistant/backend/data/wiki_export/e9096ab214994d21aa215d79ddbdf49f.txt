Chacha Bhatija () is a 1977 Indian Bollywood comedy drama film, written by Salim–Javed and directed by Manmohan Desai. It was the year's fourth hit for Manmohan Desai (Amar Akbar Anthony, Dharam Veer and Parvarish are the other three). It was his second film with Dharmendra (after Dharam Veer). Chacha Bhatija stars Dharmendra, Randhir Kapoor, Rehman, Hema Malini, Yogeeta Bali, Jeevan, Master Satyajeet and Sonia Sahni.

Plot 
Ranvir Singh Teja (Rehman) lives with his family, wife Sita, son Sunder and younger brother-Shanker (Dharmendra). The family lives happily, until Sita dies suddenly. Teja remarried, and his new wife is Sonia (Sonia Sahni), who comes to live with him at his palatial home with her wicked brother, Laxmidas (Jeevan). They have a devious agenda of taking over Teja's property. Soon after marriage, misunderstandings arise, and Shanker is asked to leave the house. These misunderstandings involve Sunder, who also is sent away from the house (to a miserable boarding school) by Teja, who thinks that his brother and son are inciting each other and conspiring against his newly-wedded wife Soniya.

Many years pass. Sunder has grown up to be a conman, and Shanker has become a black-marketeer. They come across each other without knowing each other's identity, and a confrontation takes place. When they realize they are uncle and nephew, they decide to expose Sonia, and open Teja's eyes, who is completely blinded by Sonia's love and will not let anyone come between them.
