François Boucq (; born 28 November 1955 in Lille), is a French comic book artist.  He is most famous for his surreal comics revolving around the main character .

Career
Boucq published cartoons in magazines like Le Point or L'Expansion at an early age. Soon, he also created comic albums, becoming famous with Les pionniers de l'aventure humaine. Many more have been published in the meantime, including  (1986)  (1990) and  (2014) with American novelist Jerome Charyn. Boucq created the successful series Face de Lune in cooperation with the artist Alexandro Jodorowsky. 1994 saw the publication of Les dents du recoin, the first album of a series of surreal comics that feature Jérôme Moucherot, a door-to-door insurance salesman with a fountain pen through his nose, who is dressed in a leopard fur suit; his bizarre adventures take place in a world where Smurfs are jungle-dwelling headhunters and sharks swim around in the blue wallpapers of bourgeois living rooms.

Boucq later teamed up with Jodorowsky again, creating the graphic novel series Bouncer, set in a bleak Western scenario.

In 1998, Boucq was awarded the Grand Prix de la ville d'Angoulême. In keeping with the festival's tradition, he was the president of the jury in the following year.

Personal life
Apart from his comic book career he is an enthusiast of kendo (Japanese fencing), in which he achieved a 5 Dan master grade.
