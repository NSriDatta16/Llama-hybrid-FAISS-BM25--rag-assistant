Fürstenau (Northern Low Saxon: Försnau) is a municipality in the district of Osnabrück, in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is situated approximately  northwest of Osnabrück, and  east of Lingen.

Fürstenau is also the seat of the Samtgemeinde ("collective municipality") Fürstenau.

St. Georg Evangelical Lutheran Church stands in the city market square.  Pastor Anke Kusche tells the story of how during World War II the army required all the available metal for war products.  The church bells which had rung daily for hundreds of years were taken down as required. But during the night one of them was stolen and buried until after the war in a farmer's field.

In the city clerks office hangs a painting of the city in the late 18th century. It is how the city still looks in December 2006.
