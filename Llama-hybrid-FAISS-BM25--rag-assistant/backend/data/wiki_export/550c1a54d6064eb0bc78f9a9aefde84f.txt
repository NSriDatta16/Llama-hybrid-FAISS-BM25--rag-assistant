Chelford railway station serves the village of Chelford in Cheshire, England. The station is  north of Crewe on the Crewe to Manchester Line.

History
Chelford railway station was opened by the Manchester and Birmingham Railway on 10 May 1842.

Chelford railway station once had an engine shed, however this was demolished around 1880.

The station was rebuilt in 1960 by the architect William Robert Headley.

On 4 May 1970 the goods yard at Chelford Railway station was closed.

1894 rail crash

On 22 December 1894 a strong wind blew a high-sided freight wagon into violent contact with other wagons, causing one to overturn and block the main line. An express train between London and Manchester collided with the wagon; 14 people were killed, and 48 injured.

Services

Following the timetable changes in December 2008 there exists an hourly service southbound to Crewe and northbound to Manchester Piccadilly via Stockport.
Services to Manchester via Manchester Airport run 'semi-fast' and skip the station, though a few services via Manchester Airport do call here (mainly at peak times). Services are operated by Northern.

The December 2008 timetable also saw the introduction of a regular 2-hourly Sunday service to Manchester Piccadilly and Crewe.
