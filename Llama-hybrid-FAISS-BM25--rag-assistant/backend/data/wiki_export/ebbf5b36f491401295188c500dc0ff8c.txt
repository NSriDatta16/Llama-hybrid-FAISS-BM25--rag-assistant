History
When the Southampton and Dorchester Railway (S&DR) was opened on 1 June 1847, Wool was one of the original stations on the line. The S&DR was amalgamated into the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) on 11 October 1848, and that company doubled the line in stages: the section from  to Wool was doubled on 1 June 1863, and the double track was extended from Wool to Dorchester on 1 August 1863.

The station was host to a Southern Railway camping coach from 1936 to 1939.

Two camping coaches were positioned here by the Southern Region from 1954 to 1960, the coaches were replaced in 1961 by two Pullman camping coaches until 1967. The coaches were fitted with a full kitchen, two sleeping compartments and a room with two single beds.

Accidents and incidents 
The line was originally built with a single track but no telegraph, with the result that there was a head-on collision between Wool and  on 27 September 1847; casualties were light.

Services
Until 1967, trains through the station were normally steam hauled. Between 1967 and 1988, passenger services were normally provided by Class 33/1 diesel locomotives with Class 438 coaching stock (also known as 4-TC units). The line was electrified in 1988, using the standard British Rail Southern Region direct current third rail at 750 volts. Class 442 electric multiple units were initially used following electrification, until being displaced by new Class 444 electric multiple units in 2007.
