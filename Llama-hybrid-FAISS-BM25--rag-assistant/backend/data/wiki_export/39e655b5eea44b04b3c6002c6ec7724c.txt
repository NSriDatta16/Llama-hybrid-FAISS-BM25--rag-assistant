Timeline

Life
Kim Hae-Gyeong was born in Seoul, Korea on September 23, 1910 (August 20, 1910 in lunar calendar), in Seoul. His father Kim Young-Chang worked in the letterpress printing service in a palace before his birth, but after an accident that cut off his finger, he opened a barbershop and made their living. He was raised by his uncle Kim Yeon-Pil (hangul: 김연필, hanja: 金演弼) since 1913, because Yeon-Pil and his wife had no children at that point. Later, however, Yeon-Pil takes Kim Young-Sook (hangul: 김영숙, hanja: 金英淑) as his concubine and the son she already had, Kim Moon-Kyung (hangul: 김문경, hanja: 金汶卿), became a legal son of Yeon-Pil.

Donggwang School was merged into Posung School at 1922.). He met his friend Koo Bon-Woong (hangul: 구본웅, hanja: 具本雄) at Sinmyeong School. The Posung School record shows that he wanted to become an artist.

In 1926, he entered  (hangul: 경성고등공업학교, hanja: 京城高等工業學校), which was the most prominent tertiary education institution at that time, majoring architecture. In 1928, he graduated the college with 1st place honor. In the graduation photobook, he used his writing name Yi Sang (hangul: 이상, hanja: 李箱) for the first time, as far as known. In April 1929, with the recommendation through the college, he was employed as a public official (hangul: 기수, hanja: 技手) in the architecture team in the department of domestic affairs (hangul: 내무국 건축과, hanja: 內務局 建築課) of the Government-General of Korea (hangul: 조선총독부, hanja: 朝鮮總督府). At November, he moved his position to the building maintenance team of the department of secretariat and accounting (hangul: 관방회계과 영선계, hanja: 官房會計課 營繕係).

In December 1929, he became a member of Joseon Architecture Society (Joseon Geonchukhoe, hangul: 조선건축회, hanja: 朝鮮建築會), of which the members were mainly Japanese architects in Korea, and he won first and third prizes in a design contest for the cover of Joseon and Architecture (Joseongwa Geonchuk, Japanese: 朝鮮と建築, hangul: 조선과건축), a journal issued by the Joseon Architecture Society. Most of his works were produced during the 1930s.

In 1933, he coughed up blood as he had tuberculosis, which had him quit his job as a public official of architecture. Then he opened a coffee house, Jebi, where he had related with other writers and artists.

In 1934 he joined the Circle of Nine (Guinhoe, hangul: 구인회, hanja: 九人會), of which core members included Kim Kirim, Lee Taejun, and Jung Jiyong. In 1936 Yi Sang edited Siwa soseol (hangul: 시와 소설), the Circle of Nine magazine, published by Changmunsa under the aegis of Koo Bonung. His “Street exterior, street passage” (Gaoe gajeon, hangul: 가외가전, hanja: 街外街傳) was published in this journal. His short story “Diary Before Death” (Jongsaenggi, hangul: 종생기, hanja: 終生記) and his personal memoir “Monotony” (Gwontae, hangul: 권태, hanja: 倦怠) were published posthumously in Tokyo. In 1935, the coffee shop Jebi was closed due to financial difficulties and broke up with Geumhong. Cafe Tsuru and Coffee Shop 69 in Insa-dong were opened and transferred, and after managing Coffee Shop Mugi in Myeong-dong, and right after he closed it he healed in Seongcheon and Incheon.

In November 1936 he went to Japan. 
In February 1937, he was investigated by the Nishi-Ganda Police Station in Tokyo on ideological charges, and after being investigated for about a month, he was bailed for worsening tuberculosis and released from prison. He was hospitalized to the Tokyo Imperial University Hospital, and died on April 17 at the age of 28 at the Tokyo Imperial University Hospital. His wife, Byun Dong-rim, moved to Japan directly after hearing that Yi Sang was in critical condition, and after Yi Sang died, She cremated his ashes and buried them in Miari Cemetery. Later, according to Byun Dong-rim, Byun Dong-rim asked him what he wanted to eat, and he died soon after leaving the words, "Sembikiya's melon."
 Park Tae-won, a fellow literary man and friend, mentions the following, "He loved girl so much, loved alcohol, loved his friends, and loved literature, but not half of it loved his body." And "His death is named as death from illness, but isn't the essence of death suicide? Such suspicions become intense," he said.

Literary Relationship

Jung Ji-yong 
Jung Ji-yong is a founding member of the Guinhoe which Lee Sang belongs. In 1933, he was an editorial advisor to <Catholic Youth> and played a major role in promoting Yi sang's poems to the world. With the help of Jeong Ji-yong, Yi sang published works such as "꽃나무" and "이런시" in Korean in <Catholic Youth>.

Park Tae-won 
Park Tae-won and Yi Sang were members of Guinhoe(九人會), which means the Circle of Nine people. And they joined the club in 1934. They first met at Dabang Jebi, which is coffee house opened by Yi Sang in Jong-no 1(il)-ga. The time when they first met is supposed June or July 1933, because, Kim Ki-rim, one of members of Guinhoe, and Ko Un wrote Jebi was held in July 1933 and Kim Ok-hee, sister of Yi Sang, wrote June of same year. The story of their first met is written in Park Tae-won’s memoir for Yi sang, “Yi sang-ui Pyeonmo (이상의 편모)” after Yi sang’s death. Park Tae-won has interest in that Yi Sang is a poet and the poem of first met poet, “Movement (운동, 運動)” .  Maintaining their relationship, Park Tae-won and Yi Sang consulted with worker of newspaper “Joseon-Jungang-ilbo” to post series of Yi Sang’s poetries, “Ogam-do(오감도, 烏瞰圖)” and Park’s novel “소설가 구보씨의 일일 (小說家仇甫氏─一日)” on the newspaper. They could put their literature in the newspapers, and Yi Sang also composed illustrations for his friend Park Tae-won’s novel, “소설가 구보씨의 일일(小說家仇甫氏─一日)". Even if, they encountered harsh criticism because of abstrusities of their literatures, after Yi Sang’s admission to “Guinhoe(九人會)” in fall of 1934, they focused on publication of bulletin “시와 소설 (Poet and Novel)” . They also have literary relationship with Yi Sang’s poet “Movement (운동, 運動)” and Park Tae-won’s short novel “Bangranjang Juin (芳蘭莊 主人)” . Both are written in only one sentence. However, their relation is halted by Yi Sang’s death in Tokyo.

Kim Ki-rim 
Kim Ki-rim, a poet and a newspaper reporter at the Chosun Ilbo, played as one of the founding members of Guinhoe. Initially, Yi was introduced to Kim by Park Tae-won. In their first encounter, they talked about Jules Renard, Salvador Dalí, and René Clair. Kim got interested in Yi because there was a common aesthetic affinity about surrealism between them.

Kim's 7 letters with Yi Sang remains today with the name "To Kim Ki-rim (김기림에게)". The letters were written in 1936 to 1937. In that period, Yi moved to Mainland Japan, and was about to die due to chronic lung disease. In those letters, Yi's everyday thoughts and experiences are represented. For example, in the fourth letter, Yi refers to René Clair, a French filmmaker, and criticize his movie, The Ghost Goes West. On the other hand, he comments about paper of Choi Jae-seo, a Korean literature critic, that criticizes works of Yi such as "The Wings (날개)".

After the death of Yi Sang, Kim Kirim wrote a tribute named 'Memories of the late Yi Sang (고 이상의 추억)'. In the tribute, he recognizes the death of Yi Sang as a "tragedy of a reduce-printed era", contextualizing Yi's death within a historical framework.

Koo Bon-Woong 
Koo Bon-Woong is a painter and art critic who graduated from the Taiheiyo Art School(太平洋美術 學校). He first met Yi Sang at Sinmyeong School. Koo Bon-Woong, who had had a hunchback, attended school intermittently because of health problems and ended up graduating alongside Yi Sang, who was four years younger. Koo Bon-Woong, teased because of his hunchback, had a keen interest in art. Similarly, Yi Sang, who also had a strong interest in art, became friends with Koo Bon-Woong, supporting and respecting him. This marked the beginning of their relationship, which continued into adulthood.

In 1933, to care for Yi Sang, who had quit his job as a public official of due to illness, Koo Bon-Woong took him to Baechon Hot Springs in Hwanghae Province. Baechon Hot Springs is also known as the place where Yi Sang first met Geum-Hong. After Yi Sang's health slightly improved, Yi Sang and Geum-Hong returned to Seoul (Koo Bon-Woong came back to Seoul before them) and they opened a coffee shop called "Jebi". It is said that Koo Bon-Woong's painting, "Still Object with a Doll(인형이 있는 정물)" (71.4 cm*89.4 cm), was displayed in this café.

After Jebi closed down, Yi Sang had no means of livelihood. He eventually found work as a proofreader at Koo Bon-Woong's printing press. There, with Koo Bon-Woong's assistance, Yi Sang founded a literary magazine called "Poetry and Novel(시와 소설)" featuring works from members of Guinhoe. Although only the inaugural issue was produced due to a lack of active participation from the members, looking at Yi Sang's postscript in the magazine, it is evident that Koo Bon-Woong was a fervent supporter of Yi Sang's artistic activities.

Furthermore, Yi Sang's last lover Byun Dong-Rim was the younger sister of Koo Bon-Woong's stepmother. This somewhat unusual relationship was due to the fact that Koo Bon-Woong's stepmother was not significantly older than Koo Bon-Woong.

Yi Sang's Lovers

Geum-Hong 
In 1933, 23-years-old Yi Sang first encountered Keum Hong, who was Kisaeng, when he was on a trip to Baecheon Oncheon (hangul: 배천온천, Hanja: 白川温泉) for recuperation of his tuberculosis. They developed their romantic relationship, thus they managed a coffee house, Jebi, in Jong-no 1st Street, Gyeongseong. He designated her as the manager of the coffee house and lived together estimate for two years. Their relationship was rough since they had suffered from financial degradation. She frequently stayed outside then, and accordingly, Yi sang lashed out her mind by mentioning her prior routine as a Kisaeng. In consequence, she beat him physically and often ran away from their home, and eventually, they broke up. Accordingly, in September 1935, the coffee house Jebi was closed. The love story about them is illustrated in his novel, Bongbyeolgi, which means "a story of meet and separate." Moreover, Keum Hong is implicitly appeared in his short story, The Wings (novel), as Yeon-shim-i (Hangul: 연심이) is her real name.

Gwon Sun-ok 
After the failure of the coffeehouse Jebi, he took over the cafe 'Tsuru'(Hangul: 쓰루, Kanji: 鶴) by being mortgaged the house held by Yi Sang's parents. He scouted Kwon Soon-ok had worked in the other cafe, 'Angel', as a waitress. Since she was highly educated, she had broad interaction with other writers like Jeong In-taek. While he fell over to her, their romantic relationship was not completely established. Jeong In-taek had a secret crush on her, which led to a romantic triangle. Even Jeong In-taek attempted suicide to be in her favor, and after the incident, Kwon Soon-ok and Jeong In-taek married. Ironically, Yi sang and presided over their wedding ceremony. Following Jeong In-taek's death, Gwon Sun-ok remarried to Park Tae-won.

Byeon Dong-rim 
Byeon Dong-rim (hangul: 변동림), a writer introduced to Yi Sang through Gu Bon-woong, became his wife. Yi Sang and Byeon Dong-rim met in 1936, through a set-up by Gu Bon-woong. Only three months into their marriage, Yi Sang left for Tokyo alone, where his health sharply deteriorated, resulting in his transfer to the attached hospital of Tokyo Imperial University. His condition further worsened due to a sudden arrest, and he was already in a severe state by the time he arrived at the hospital. Upon receiving the news, Byeon Dong-rim immediately traveled to Tokyo in two days. After just four months of marriage, Yi Sang passed away in her presence. Their feelings towards each other can be traced through Yi Sang's "Tokyo" (Donggyeong, hangul: 동경, hanja: 東京) and Byeon Dong-rim's "The Mind Under the Moon" (hangul: 월하의 마음, hanja:月下의 마음). In later years, Byeon Dong-rim reflected on Yi Sang's death, stating, "He lived a most brilliant, enchanted life. The 27 years he spent on this earth were enough time for a genius to fully blossom and then fade away."

Work
Yi was perhaps the most famous avant-garde writer of the colonial era. In his work he experimented with language, interiority, separation from inside one's self as well as the outer world. His poems, particularly, were influenced by Western literary concepts including Dadaism and Surrealism. Yi's history in architecture influenced his work, which often included the languages of mathematics and architecture including, lines, dots, number systems, equations and diagrams.

His literary legacy is punctuated by his modernist tendencies evinced throughout his oeuvre. His poems reveal the desolate internal landscape of modern humanity and, as in “Crow's eye view poem No. 1” (Ogamdo si je1ho), utilize an anti-realist technique to condense the themes of anxiety and fear. His stories disjoint the form of traditional fiction to show the conditions of the lives of modern people. “Wings” (Nalgae), for example, utilizes a stream-of-consciousness technique to express these conditions in terms of the alienation of modern people, who are fragmented commodities unable to relate to quotidian (daily) realities.

Yi Sang never received much recognition for his writing during his lifetime, but his works began to be reprinted in the 1950s.  In the 1970s his reputation soared, and in 1977 the Yi Sang Literary Award was established.  In 2007, he was listed by the Korean Poets' Association among the ten most important modern Korean poets. His most famous short story is "The Wings" ("Nalgae", ), and his poem "Crow's-Eye View" is also well-known.

Study of Yi Sang
Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology(GIST) 'Yi Sang's Literature and Science' course, which is opened annually for undergraduate students by Division of liberal arts and sciences of the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology(GIST), aims to analyze the Yi Sang's literary works from the perspective of science. In this class, in addition to Korean, the Yi Sang text is created in old Korean, Chinese characters, Japanese, English, German, French, modified characters, coined words, and homonymy language play, and these parts are interpreted modernly. As many scientific elements have appeared in the Yi Sang's literary works, students analyze and discuss what those elements mean from a scientific perspective. They also investigates and presents the Yi Sang's biographical facts, the level of science education in Joseon in the 1920s and 30s, and contemporary writers and works mentioned in the Yi Sang text, and closely analyzes and discusses prose, novels, and poems left by Yi Sang. Through this class, a student at the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology wrote a paper that logically interpreted the Yi Sang's "Building Infinite Hexahedral Bodies" and "Triple Angle blueprint" from the perspective of space-time design and architecture in four dimensions, causing a great stir in the literary world.
