Gloucester Rugby 
On 6 December 2013, Afoa officially joined Gloucester Rugby in the English Aviva Premiership on a four-year contract worth £400,000 per season. This made him one of the highest-paid players in the Premiership and the third highest-paid player in European rugby.

Crusaders
On the 27 May 2023, Afoa answered a call from Crusaders coach Scott Robertson due to the Crusaders mounting injury crisis for front row forwards. Afoa flew from back from France, where he had been playing, and debuted as the tight head prop for the Crusaders match against the Waratahs. Afoa became the oldest ever super rugby player at the age of 39 years and 233 days.

International career 
Afoa has moved through a number of international representative sides. In 1999, Afoa made the New Zealand U16 team, the youngest national representative team. Through 2000 and 2001, Afoa had played in the more senior New Zealand Schools' side. Moving steadily through the age grades, he was a member of the New Zealand under-19 teams of 2002 and 2003.

In both 2003 and 2004, Afoa was part of the New Zealand Under 21 Rugby World Championship team. The New Zealanders won the tournament both years. In 2003 Afoa was one of four kiwis named in the IRB's team of the tournament.

In 2005 Afoa was selected for the All Blacks Tri-nations squad. Despite this, he never took the field in that competition and didn't earn his first test cap until the end-of-year tour. In November 2005, Afoa finally became the All Black number 1062 when he started against Ireland at Lansdowne Road.

In 2010, Afoa was experimented to be used at hooker. The same year against Wales, Afoa scored his first test try showing some great running for a prop with a 30-meter dash to the try line.

Afoa's test career ended after the 2011 Rugby World Cup. He played 36 tests, 30 as a substitute.

Coaching career
Afoa was appointed scrum coach at Bristol Bears from the 2021–22 season. He would also continue his playing duties.
