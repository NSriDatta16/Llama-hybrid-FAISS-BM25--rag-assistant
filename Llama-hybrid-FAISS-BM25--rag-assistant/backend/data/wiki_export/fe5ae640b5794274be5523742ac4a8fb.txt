He was the son of Angelos Evert, chief of police in Athens during the Nazi occupation of Greece in World War II and credited for saving many Jews and resistance fighters from Gestapo persecution. The Ebert family is of Bavarian origin, one of the families that settled in Athens during the reign of King Otto in the early 19th century.

As mayor of Athens in 1987, Evert was the first to exercise the legal possibility of opposition radio broadcasting in Greece since all radio stations (including television networks) were a state monopoly. He helped launch Athena 98.4 FM, the first private radio station to begin broadcasting legally in Greece.
