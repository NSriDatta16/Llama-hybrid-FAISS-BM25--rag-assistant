This page details the format and usage of telephone numbers in Slovakia. Today, Slovakia uses a closed numbering plan with area codes beginning with 0. After 0, there is usually a 2-digit prefix, followed by a 7-digit subscriber number. The capital, Bratislava, has one-digit prefix and an 8-digit subscriber number.

Following the break-up of Czechoslovakia in 1993, the successor states, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, continued to share the 42 country code, until 28 February 1997, when the Czech Republic adopted 420 while Slovakia adopted 421.
