Be'lakor is an Australian melodic death metal band from Melbourne, Victoria. The band's name originates from the character Be'lakor the Dark Master, in the Warhammer Fantasy game setting.

History
Be'lakor formed as a band in 2004, but did not start playing live shows until 2005. In 2007, the band self-released their debut album, The Frail Tide, which received generally positive reviews. In 2008, Be'lakor signed with Descent Productions, and re-released The Frail Tide in digipack form.  In 2009, Be'lakor embarked on a national tour, and signed with Prime Cuts Music.  Their second album, Stone's Reach, was released on 20 June 2009
and received much praise by reviewers.  In November 2009, Be'lakor signed with Kolony Records.

In March 2010, Be'lakor's album Stone's Reach took first place in Metal Storm's "Best Melodeath/Gothenburg Metal Album" for 2009. Be'lakor also supported Turisas on their national tour of Australia in May. They were the opening act for Alestorm in Melbourne for their "PLUNDER DOWNUNDER” tour in June 2010. The band also performed at the Summer Breeze Open Air Festival in Germany in August 2010.
