The village was first mentioned between 1851 and 1855 "Zuider Hoofddiep of Exlooder Mond", and means "second (canal) that has his mouth (at the main canal) belonging to Exloo".

The hamlet of Eexloërkijl developed on the western end, however both settlement later merged into a single settlement. The peat concession measured  and the peat layer was about  thick.
