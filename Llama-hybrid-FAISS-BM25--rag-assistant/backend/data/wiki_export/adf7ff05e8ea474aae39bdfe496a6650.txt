History
Edward C. Reed High School is named after Judge Edward C. Reed, Jr., a Senior United States District Judge for the District of Nevada. Before being appointed to the bench in 1979, Judge Reed was a Washoe County School Board Member from 1956 to 1959, and President of the School Board from 1959 to 1977.

1976 was the first graduating class for Reed High. Sparks high has so many students prior to the opening of Reed High, that the school ran three shifts of students, with Seniors and Junior arriving for First period, Sophomores for Second Period, and Freshman arriving for Third Period.

While the school was being built, the district held a vote of future students on what to name the school. Although students decided that the alliteration of Reed Raiders sounded best, the Reed Conquistadors was also a popular choice - garnering the second most votes.
