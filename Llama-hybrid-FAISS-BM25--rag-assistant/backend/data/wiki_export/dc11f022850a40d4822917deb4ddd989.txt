Vigilantism
The town first experienced this problem in early 2015. After a stray of robberies within the small community the police seemed powerless to stop these crimes from being carried out. A group known as "Blood Brothers" were seen taking matters into their own hands. The group soon started going through the streets at night in an effort to stop the robberies. After a month or so they apprehended the robbers, who were later discovered to be members of the Gang 77. The after effects of this also led to the capture of their leader, which was confirmed by the police in 2017.
