The 1998–99 Serie A saw Milan win their 16th Scudetto, led by coach Alberto Zaccheroni. Lazio finished second, losing the title on the last day. Internazionale, with an often injured or rested Ronaldo, had a disastrous season, finishing in 8th position, whereas Juventus' impressive start was cut short by a bad injury to Alessandro Del Piero, and they wound up having an unimpressive season.

Teams
Salernitana, Venezia, Cagliari and Perugia had been promoted from Serie B.
