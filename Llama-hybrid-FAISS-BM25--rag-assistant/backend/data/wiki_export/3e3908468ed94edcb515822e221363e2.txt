Today, the museums of Uzbekistan store over two million artifacts, evidence of the unique historical, cultural, and spiritual life of the Central Asian peoples that have lived in the region.

The Statistical Internet Survey conducted between May 7 and August 27, 2008, found that the majority of those surveyed (39%) visit Uzbekistan due to their fascination with its architectural and historical sites. The next-largest group (24%) visited Uzbekistan to observe its culture, way of life, and customs. 

Tourist activities in Uzbekistan range from outdoor activities, such as rock-climbing, to exploration of its rich archeological and religious history.

In 2019, 6.75 million tourists visited Uzbekistan. The industry earned a total of $1.68 billion. The tourism industry has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with both tourist numbers and revenue dropping heavily. Each autumn, the Uzbek travel industry holds an International Tourism Fair.

Uzbekistan is a member of The Region Initiative (TRI), which is an umbrella organization for tourism-related entities across three regions.
