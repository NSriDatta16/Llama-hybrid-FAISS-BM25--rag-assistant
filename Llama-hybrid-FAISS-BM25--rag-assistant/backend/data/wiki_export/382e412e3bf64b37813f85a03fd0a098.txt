Sokol () is a town in the center of Vologda Oblast, Russia, located on both banks of the Sukhona River. Population: ; 36,000 (1970).

History
The village of Sokolovo () existed on this location since at least 1615. Since 1796, the village was part of Kadnikovsky Uyezd of Vologda Governorate. In 1897, a paper mill was built near the village and Sokolovo became the primary place of residence of the employees of the mill.

In November 1923, the Vologda Executive Committee decreed to create Sverdlovsko-Sukhonsky District with the administrative center in the settlement of Sokol; however, the decision was not approved by the central authorities, and the district was never created.

On July 15, 1929, the uyezds were abolished, the governorates merged into Northern Krai, and Sverdlovsky District with the administrative center in the work settlement of Sokol was established among others. It became a part of Vologda Okrug of Northern Krai. In 1932, Sokol was granted town status, and the district was renamed Sokolsky.
