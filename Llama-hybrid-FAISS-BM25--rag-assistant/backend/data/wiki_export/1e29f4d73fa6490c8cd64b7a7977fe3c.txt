Viscount Stonehaven, of Ury in the County of Kincardine, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 27 June 1938 for the Conservative politician and former Governor General of Australia, John Baird, 1st Baron Stonehaven. He had already been created Baron Stonehaven, of Ury in the County of Kincardine, on 12 June 1925. The Baird Baronetcy of Urie, had been created on 8 March 1897 for his father Alexander Baird.

The first Viscount married Lady Ethel Sydney Keith, daughter of Algernon Keith-Falconer, 9th Earl of Kintore, who in 1966 succeeded her younger brother as 12th Countess of Kintore. Their son James Ian Keith succeeded to his father's titles in 1941 and to his mother's titles in 1974. The baronetcy, barony and viscountcy of Stonehaven are now subsidiary titles of the Earldom of Kintore.
