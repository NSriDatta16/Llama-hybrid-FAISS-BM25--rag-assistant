Kingsway Mall (formerly Kingsway Garden Mall) is a shopping centre located in central Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The mall, constructed in 1976, completed a $70-million redevelopment from 2007â€“2009. The "Revealing" held at the weekend of 13 November 2009, saw the name change, introduced the public to the new mall, and opened the winter shopping season. Bordered by three major commuter roads (109 Street, Princess Elizabeth Avenue, and Kingsway), Kingsway Mall is situated near NAIT (Northern Alberta Institute of Technology) and the Royal Alexandra Hospital. On 14 March 2014, its Target location opened, but closed in 2015. Also, in 2015, Forever 21 opened in the former Smitty's and Sheffield Express. It also had the last Smart Set in Edmonton. Hot Topic opened in the mall in the Fall of 2015, and it is the first in Edmonton. In 2017, they announced they would go under a renovation adding a new wing of the mall in the former Target. On July 8, 2021, Walmart announced that it would be exiting its current Westmount Centre Location and relocating to Kingsway Mall in the former Sears space on October 20, 2022. A portion of the former Sears where the store's Sears Home entrance and section were located, was not taken over by Walmart, and that space was replaced by Fit 4 Less, on February 22, 2023.
