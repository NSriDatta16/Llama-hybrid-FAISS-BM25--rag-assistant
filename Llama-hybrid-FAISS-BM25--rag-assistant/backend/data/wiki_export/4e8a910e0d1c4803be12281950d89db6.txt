History
Originally begun in 1884 with two students, an elementary school was added in 1888, and a senior high school in 1889. The school expanded to include a kindergarten class in 1914, a dormitory, kindergarten building, and a house for the Methodist missionaries in 1932, and a brand new building for the school in 1933.

Due to the anti-Western sentiment during World War II, the  (meaning "English") in  was changed to , meaning "eternal" or "eternity", in 1941. The name was changed back in 1946. Because of the changes made in the Japanese education system following World War II, each department changed its name to reflect the new government-approved names. In 1965, facilities were expanded to include a location at Oiwake, Karuizawa, Nagano Prefecture and camp was established in 1970 at Lake Nojiri.

In 1986, the junior college was moved to a campus in Midori-ku, Yokohama, the attached women's university became a four-year college in 1989, and opened its graduate school in 1993.
