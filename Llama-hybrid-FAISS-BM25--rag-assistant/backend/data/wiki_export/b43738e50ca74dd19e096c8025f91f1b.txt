The Yurok Indian Reservation is a Native American reservation for the Yurok people located in parts of Del Norte and Humboldt counties, California, on a  stretch of the Klamath River. It is one of a very few tribes who have never been removed from their ancestral lands in California.

The  reservation is serviced by California Route 169 from the south, which dead ends within the reservation. It is bordered by the Hoopa Indian Reservation to the south, adjacent to Redwood National Park to the west and completely surrounds the Resighini Rancheria. The 2000 census reported a resident population of 1,103 persons on reservation territory, mostly in the community of Klamath, at the reservation's north end. As of the 2010 Census the population was 1,238 and as of the 2020 census it was 1,236.
