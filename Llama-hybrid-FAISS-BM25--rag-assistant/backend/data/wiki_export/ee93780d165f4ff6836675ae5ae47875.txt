Etymology 
There are at least two versions of the origin of the town name. The first is connected with the term derkach, the Ukrainian name for the corncrake that inhabits the banks of the local Lopan river. Another version links the name to that of a legendary cossack Derkach who, it said, was the town's founder. After 1943, the Soviet local authorities  rejected the Ukrainian variant of the name with letter k and began to use only the Russian version, Derhachi (with letter h). Later, the Russian pronunciation was officially installed in Ukrainian official settlements classification.

History

The Scythian period (500-200 BC) 
It has been established that the present area of today's town was populated in Scythian times (6th-3rd centuries B.C.) and later. A unique Scythian ritual pommel decorated with a sphinx was found in the town. This artefact formed part of a Scythian World Tree and is now on show at the Kharkiv Historical Museum. In 2018 and 2019, an archaeological expedition from Kharkiv Historical Museum carried out excavations of the Scythian kurgan or burial mound in the western part of Derhachi. Scholars examined the mounds and put together a collection of items that provided information about the funeral rites of the Scythian period.

The Cossack era 
In the 17th century, Derkachi was a sotnia town of the Kharkiv Sloboda Cossack Regiment. Up to 1742 there was one cossacks sotnia administration there; from 1742 to 1765 there were two. Traditionally, a sotnyk (head of a sotnia) in Derkachi was a member of a family, well known in Sloboda Ukraine, the Kowalewskis (Dołęga coat of arms). The town had its own symbols. The sotnia standard used an image of the Archangel Michael. The town seal contained an image of the derkach (corn crake) surmounted by an octagram. According to 1779 documents, Derkachi was a military sloboda of the Kharkiv povit (uyezd) with a population of 2,287 citizens.

Russian Empire 
During Tsarist times, Derkachi was a settlement within Kharkov Governorate of the Russian Empire.

Soviet times

Holodomor: the man-made famine of 1932-1933 
At least 274 of the town's residents died in the Holodomor, the man-made famine in Soviet Ukraine in 1932 and 1933. The officials of Derkachi town council were involved in expropriation of local citizens property in 1932.

Second World War 
Derhachi spent 630 days during the Eastern Front under the occupation of the German Army, from 21 October 1941 to 13 August 1943; save for a period during the Third Battle of Kharkov in February 1943 when it was briefly recaptured by the Red Army.  The town would be liberated later that year during the Belgorod–Kharkov offensive operation.

In January 1989, the town's population was 22,915 people.

Independent Ukraine (since 1991) 
In January 2013, the town population was 18,154 people.

Until 18 July 2020, Derhachi was the administrative center of Derhachi Raion. The raion was abolished in July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions or districts in the Kharkiv Oblast to seven. The area of Derhachi Raion was merged into Kharkiv Raion.

During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the town saw shelling and fighting as part of the Battle of Kharkiv, resulting in civilian casualties. On 12 May 2022, the local palace of culture was shelled by a BM-27 Uragan MLRS, killing two people and wounding four. Later, on the night of May 12–13, the building was completely destroyed by a missile strike. Unlike swaths of Kharkiv Oblast Russian troops did not occupy Derhachi. In honor of this in September 2023 to the pedestal of the monument to the alledged founder of the city, Cossack Derkachu, there was a new shield attached with the inscription "Derhachi - the shield of defense of Kharkiv".
