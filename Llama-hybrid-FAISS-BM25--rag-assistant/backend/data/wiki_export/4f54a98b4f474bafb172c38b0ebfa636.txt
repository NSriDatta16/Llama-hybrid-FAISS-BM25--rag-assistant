Jump to It is the twenty-eighth studio album by American singer Aretha Franklin, produced by Luther Vandross and released on July 26, 1982, by Arista Records.

Background
Jump to It gave Franklin her tenth number one R&B album – at the time it was the all-time record. It enjoyed a seven-week run at number one on Billboards R&B albums chart and also reached number 23 on Billboards Pop albums chart. It was hailed as a comeback album, given that it provided Franklin with her first Gold-certified disc and Top 40 Pop song since Sparkle in 1976.

The title track, "Jump to It", was Franklin's first Top 40 Pop hit since 1976, and her first number one R&B hit since 1977's "Break It to Me Gently". "Jump to It" was nominated for a Grammy Award. The album itself received an American Music Award for Best Soul Album in 1983.

Commercial performance
On February 1, 1983, Jump to It was certified Gold by the RIAA. Franklin was presented her framed Gold record in Detroit by her long-time friends the Four Tops. In 2005, Patrick Alavi released "Come to Me", which used a sample of "Jump to It".

Reception
Armond White of Spin complained about "Luther Vandross's piss-elegant Jump to It, which, despite the lively title track, mistakenly bent Aretha into Dionne Warwick postures amid the iciness of the Chic background singers."
