Greg Mardon Somerville is a New Zealand rugby union player. He is a former All Black and a specialised tighthead prop who can also play loosehead. Somerville made his All Black debut in 2000 against Tonga, a match in which the All Blacks won 102â€“0. Somerville went 41 test matches before scoring his first, and only test try against Fiji in 2005. Somerville played domestic rugby for Canterbury Rugby Football Union and for the Crusaders in the Super Rugby competition, having played 100 matches for the latter after debuting against the Chiefs in 1999. Somerville's nickname is Yoda, after the fictional character from Star Wars due to their resemblance.

Somerville left New Zealand in late 2008, having signed a two-and-a-half-year deal with the Guinness Premiership team Gloucester. In 2010 he left Gloucester for the Melbourne Rebels, with whom he spent the 2011 season before retiring.

Somerville's sporting hero is Buck Shelford, who, he says, "was a tremendous leader for the All Blacks and an outstanding front-rower."
