Tustin Ranch is a community located in the city of Tustin, California in Orange County, California. The property is historically part of the Irvine Ranch, and was a land preserve up until the creation of the community. The Irvine Company decided to build the planned community in 1982; it was approved for construction in 1986 by the County of Orange. It was annexed to the city of Tustin in 1986, and formed the 92782 ZIP Code. The Tustin Ranch was formerly a citrus ranch prior to the 1980s before its development. Today, no citrus ranches can be found on the Tustin Ranch plan, but almost all of the community streets are named after components of the former ranch.

The plan called for the creation of 7,000 residential units, from mansions to apartments to accommodate the variety of residents living in Orange County. The community falls within the Tustin Unified School District, and currently includes four schools within the ZIP code.

Nearly all the communities within Tustin Ranch surround the Tustin Ranch Golf Course, an 18-hole championship level course that was named Orange County's Finest Golf Course. The  property winds through the foothills of the communities, and is dotted with several man made lakes.
