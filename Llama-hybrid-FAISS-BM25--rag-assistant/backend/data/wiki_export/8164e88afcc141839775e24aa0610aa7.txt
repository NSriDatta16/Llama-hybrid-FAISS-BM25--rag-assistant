Stephen Robert Jenkins (born 16 July 1972) is a former Wales international footballer and the current Barry Town manager. A full back as a player, he won 16 Welsh caps between 1995 and 2001.

He began his career at Swansea, where he was a part of the team that won the 1994 Football League Trophy Final after a penalty shootout. After a seven-year spell at Huddersfield Town, in which he became not only the captain but a well established fans' favourite, Jenkins signed for Swindon Town in 2005, but after Swindon's relegation to League Two and the appointment of Dennis Wise as manager, Jenkins' offer of a new deal at the County Ground was withdrawn and he was released. He spent three years playing for and latterly coaching Newport County, before joining Llanelli as player/assistant manager to Andy Legg in May 2009.

In June 2013 Jenkins was appointed manager of Monmouth Town.

On 20 March 2014 Jenkins was appointed assistant manager to Peter Beadle at Hereford United. Hereford ended the 2013â€“14 season in 20th place, finishing above the relegation zone on goal difference after beating Aldershot Town on the final day of the season.

On 23 May 2014, Jenkins was appointed as manager of his home town club Merthyr Town.

On 30 May 2016, Jenkins was confirmed as Hereford's assistant manager. He left the role on 13 September 2018.

On 4 September 2020, Jenkins joined Barnet, once again as assistant to Beadle. He left the club on 18 December, shortly after Beadle's departure.

On 5 August 2023, one week before the start of the 2023-24 Cymru Premier season, Jenkins was confirmed as the new manager of promoted Barry Town, replacing the departed Lee Kendall.
