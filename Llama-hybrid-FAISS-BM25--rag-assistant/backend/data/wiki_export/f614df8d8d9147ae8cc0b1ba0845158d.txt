The Old Gold & Black is the student-run newspaper of Wake Forest University, named after the school's colors.  The newspaper was founded in 1916 and is published in print every other Thursday, with the exception of school holidays and exam weeks. The Old Gold & Black office is located on the fifth floor of the Benson University Center on Wake Forest's main campus.

The newspaper is Wake Forest University's only student newspaper and serves as the printed history of the university. It comprises six main sections: news, features, environment, opinion, sports and life. Each section is managed by an editor and assistant editors. They are all under the leadership of an editor-in-chief and managing editors for print and online. The editor-in-chief works alongside the business manager who is in charge of the budget, advertising revenue, and payroll. These editors form the editorial board which meets weekly to discuss campus issues, compose an editorial and decide on the paper's content. Among ACC student newspapers, the Old Gold & Black is the only paper that pays all writers and staff members.

The staff's advisor, Phoebe Zerwick, assists the staff and offers advice and counsel on important editorial decisions. These editors form the editorial board which meets weekly to discuss campus issues, compose a left-hand editorial and decide on the paper's content.

The Old Gold & Black employs graphic designers, production assistants, photographers and staff writers.  The majority of positions at the Old Gold & Black are paid, though a new writer must submit three articles for publication in order to receive pay and become a staff writer. The Old Gold & Black consistently employs a total staff of over 100 members, the majority of them writers.

The Old Gold & Black is a newspaper that has placed many times at Associated Collegiate Press conferences.

Marks on Wake Forest history
The Old Gold & Black is responsible for naming the Wake Forest mascot, the Demon Deacon. In 1923, the Wake Forest American football team defeated rival Duke University. In the following issue of the Old Gold and Black, sports editor Mayon Parker (1924 Wake Forest graduate) first referred to the team as "Demon Deacons", in recognition of what he called their "devilish" play and fighting spirit. Henry Belk, Wake Forest's news director, and Hank Garrity, the coach who led the team to their victory, liked the title and used it often, so the name stuck.

Due to pressure from the Baptist State Convention in the late 1930s, the college began to take a strong stance against student dancing. The decision and subsequent enforcement was harshly criticized by the editorial board of the Old Gold & Black. In the February 4, 1939 issue, the editorial board argued that "Despite the objection of some few blue-nosed and narrow-minded powers-that-be, you can't stop Wake Forest students from dancing. It would work wonders for the morale of the school as a whole." This lobbying on behalf of social organizations is credited with the eventual founding of national fraternities and sororities at Wake Forest.

Controversies 
In October 1962, the High Point Central Baptist Association censured the Old Gold & Black for running an advertisement featuring a student mixing an alcoholic beverage in his dorm room. The controversy of the advertisement was part of ongoing tensions between university leadership and the Baptist State Convention. In response to the censure, university officials promised to Baptist board members that the ads would not reappear.

In December 1989, Tim Bell, a Wake Forest student studying abroad in China, was found guilty by the Honor Council of deceiving his professors who were chaperoning the trip. Bell had secretly filmed parts of the Tiananmen Square massacre and then smuggled them out of the country. Public opinion on campus was mixed following the conviction; some felt he acted heroically while others thought he was selfish for endangering the rest of the students on the trip. Nevertheless, in an editorial the Old Gold & Black defended Bell's actions and criticized the Honor Council for procedural errors. Eventually, Bell's conviction was overturned.

In March 2000, the Old Gold & Black published an anti-Semitic advertising insert entitled "The Revisionist." The Editorial Staff realized its error later that day, and issued a public apology. The Resident Student Association sponsored a forum where the issue was discussed. President Thomas Hearn issued a powerful public statement uniting the campus community against the hatred represented in the insert and creating a schedule of Holocaust-related speakers and events for the following semesters. Furthermore, the advertising manager wrote an op-ed piece regretting her mistake and taking full responsibility. She announced that the proceeds of the advertisement would be donated to a local Holocaust Center. As a result of the insert, a formal advertising policy was established and goals were set to improve
communication between the editorial and business offices.

The issue is produced by senior editors and includes spoof articles, columns and humorous staff photos. The 'OGBYN' made a comeback in April of 2021.

In 2015 the Old Gold & Black dedicated its September 29 edition to honoring the life and career of Arnold Palmer, following his passing earlier in the week.

Executive Staff
The five people most responsible for the day-to-day operations of the paper are the Editor-in-Chief, the Business Manager, and the Print, Online, and Multimedia Managing Editors. The incoming Business Manager and Editor-in-Chief are selected by their predecessors after consultation with the Faculty Adviser and other members of the Editorial Board. The outgoing editor-in-chief also selects the following year's managing editors.
