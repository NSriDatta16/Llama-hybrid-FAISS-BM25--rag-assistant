High school career
Cribbs played quarterback at Dunbar High School in Washington, D.C. As a senior in the 2000 season, he was named a first-team All-Met selection by the Washington Post. While attending, he was teammates with future San Francisco 49ers tight end Vernon Davis.  Cribbs played and lettered in baseball, swimming, and basketball in addition to football.

During Cribbs' time at Dunbar, the Crimson Tide won three consecutive DCIAA football titles. In his senior season, Cribbs completed 130-of-277 passes for 2,022 yards, nine touchdowns and five interceptions. In the 2000 Turkey Bowl (DCIAA Championship game played the morning of Thanksgiving), he led Dunbar to a 35-12 victory over the Ballou Knights. Two second-half touchdowns thrown by Cribbs were key to the Crimson Tide's victory over Ballouâ€”one of which was caught by then Dunbar sophomore tight end Vernon Davis.

College career
Cribbs attended Kent State University, where he played quarterback for the Kent State Golden Flashes football team. He is the all-time total offense leader with 10,839 yards. Other school records include rushing touchdowns (38), pass completions (616), pass attempts (1,123), passing yardage (7,169), touchdowns scored (41), and points scored (246).

He is one of only two true freshman in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) history to both rush and pass for 1,000 yards (the other being Armanti Edwards of Appalachian State).

2006 season
In 2006, Cribbs signed a six-year contract extension with the Browns. That year, he set a new franchise record for most kickoff yardage in a season, breaking the record he had set the year prior.

2007 season
After returning yet another kickoff for a touchdown against the Oakland Raiders in Week 3 of the 2007 season, Cribbs had one kick-return touchdown in each of his first three years in the NFL. Cribbs recorded his fourth kickoff-return touchdown with a 100-yard return against the Steelers in Week 10 of the 2007 season, as well as a 90-yard return earlier in the game. Cribbs continued his season with 245 return yards and 61 punt return yards in the Browns overtime victory over the Ravens in week 11. Cribbs was voted to the 2008 Pro Bowl as a kick returner for the AFC. Cribbs also had a 76-yard punt return for a touchdown against the 49ers. Cribbs had another returned for 94 yards for another score but was called back on a holding penalty.

2008 season
For the fourth straight season, Cribbs again had a touchdown on a kickoff return, scoring on a 92-yard return versus the Baltimore Ravens in Week 9. It was the fifth kickoff return touchdown of Cribbs's career. Cribbs also had a four-yard rushing touchdown against the Buffalo Bills in a Monday Night Football game. On November 26, 2008, after placing Brady Quinn on injured reserve, the Browns named Cribbs their emergency quarterback.

2009 season
On September 13, in the Browns' home opener versus the Minnesota Vikings, Cribbs returned a punt 67 yards for a touchdown, tying the team record for career returns for a touchdown (seven) with Eric Metcalf. Also, in that same game, Cribbs was named as a starting wide receiver for the first time in his NFL career. On October 18, Cribbs returned a Pittsburgh kickoff for a touchdown, breaking the team record for returns for a touchdown. In this game he became the first NFL player to throw an interception and record a kick-off return touchdown in the same game since 1950. On December 10, Cribbs led the Browns to victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers, their first win over their rival in 13 games.  Cribbs led all offensive players with 200 all-purpose yards, including 87 yards rushing out of the Wildcat formation. On December 20, Cribbs returned two kickoffs for touchdowns against the Kansas City Chiefs to set and extend the all-time NFL record for most kickoff returns for touchdowns in a career. On December 29, Cribbs was named to the 2010 Pro Bowl for the second time in his career as the Browns' and AFC's representative as the kick returner. Cribbs was also named the Browns' team MVP for the 2009 season.

2010 season
Relations between Cribbs and the Browns soured at the end of the 2009 season, as negotiations on a new contract extension ended with a reported $1.4 million per year offer that Cribbs felt was insultingly low. On January 7, 2010, Cribbs cleaned out his locker at the Browns' training complex and announced his intention to walk out on the final three years of his contract, telling reporters, "... it absolutely felt like the last time I'd be setting foot inside the building. I feel like it's over for me in Cleveland", adding that the Browns' offer felt "like I've been betrayed and stabbed in the back."

On March 5, 2010, Cribbs re-signed with the Cleveland Browns with a three-year, $20 million contract.

In January 2010, Cribbs was named to the NFL's All-Decade Team for the 2000s.

2011 season
In 2011, Cribbs set a career-high of 41 receptions, 518 yards and four touchdowns. He also had an 84-yard punt return for a touchdown.

The 2011 season also marked the year of the NFL's rule change on kickoffs, shifting the position from the kicking team's own 30-yard line to the 35. The move intended to prevent more returns due to the violent collisions that they sometimes yielded. Cribbs saw his return numbers dwindle somewhat from the rule change, and the market value for specialized return men has dwindled as well.

2012 season
Cribbs had a rebound season with 1,136 kick return yards and 450 punt return yards with just three lost fumbles. He averaged 27.4 yards per return, good for fourth in the NFL.

On October 7, during a Week 5 game against the New York Giants, during which Cribbs returned 6 kickoffs for 221 yards, including a 74-yard return; he also returned one punt for just 12 yards. The Browns would lose to the Giants, 41-27.
