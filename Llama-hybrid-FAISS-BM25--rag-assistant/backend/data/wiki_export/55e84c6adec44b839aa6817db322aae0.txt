The Fabulous Sounds of the Pacific Northwest is the debut album by rock band the Young Fresh Fellows. It was released on PopLlama in 1984.

The album title and cover were inspired by an actual record from the early 1960s. The original was produced by the regional phone company Pacific Northwest Bell and was intended to promote tourism in the Pacific Northwest region. Interspersed among the 15 songs on the Young Fresh Fellows album are eight sound clips taken from the original record.

The album was re-released on compact disc as a two-for-one with the second Young Fresh Fellows album, Topsy Turvy.
