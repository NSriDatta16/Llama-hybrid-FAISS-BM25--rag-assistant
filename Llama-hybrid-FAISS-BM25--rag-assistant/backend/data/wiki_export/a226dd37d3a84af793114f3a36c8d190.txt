The Final Swing is a compilation album by English hard rock band Trapeze. Released in 1974 by Threshold Records, it features tracks from the band's first three albums, Trapeze, Medusa and You Are the Music...We're Just the Band, as well as two new tracks produced by Gerry Hoff.

Background
The Final Swing features one track from Trapeze's 1970 self-titled debut album Trapeze, three tracks from the band's 1970 second album Medusa, three tracks from the band's 1972 third album You Are the Music...We're Just the Band, and two previously unreleased tracks. The two new tracks – "Good Love" and "Dats It" – were performed by band members Glenn Hughes, Mel Galley and Dave Holland, along with pianist Jean Roussel, and produced by Gerry Hoff.

Reception

Despite Trapeze, Medusa and You Are the Music...We're Just the Band receiving at least four out of five stars each, The Final Swing was awarded two out of five stars by music website AllMusic, although no review was posted.

The album did, however, provide Trapeze with their first experience of chart success, reaching number 172 on the US Billboard 200 upon its release.
