Jackson appeared in Doctor Who in the show's original run, including the stories The Romans and in the episode Mission to the Unknown. Jackson also returned to the show and played "Drax," a school chum of the Doctor, in the Fourth Doctor story The Armageddon Factor. In 1977 he appeared as a Lock-Keeper in the Secret Army episode Identity in Doubt. This was followed in 1980 by his appearance as farmer Ken Billings in the All Creatures Great and Small episode, Matters of Life and Death. Jackson later played another Yorkshire farmer, Jim Hobson, in the Heartbeat episode, Risky Business.

He also starred in Horace, a drama about a middle-aged man with the mind of a 10-year-old.  Written by Roy Minton and directed by Alan Clarke, it was a one-off television play broadcast as part of a BBC1 new play series on 21 March 1972.  It was later revived as a TV series in 1982.  It was arguably the first mainstream UK TV serial that had a person with a learning disability as the protagonist. All episodes are thought to be in existence but have yet to be released.

He appeared in the first fourteen series of Midsomer Murders as Dr George Bullard, the pathologist, although he did not appear in series two. The character outlasted the show's original lead, DCI Tom Barnaby, by one season.
