Bio
The Letters Organize formed in 2000 in Atlanta, Georgia. The band's members are Brent Jay (vocalist), Garrett Range (bass and vocals), Donnie Adkinson (Drums), Casey Maxwell (Guitar), and Zach Hinkle (Guitar).  Taking influences from bands such as Refused and other post-hardcore bands while incorporating their own style of schizophrenic rock and roll, the band recorded their first EP "Everyone Goes Yeah...Bash!" on Brand Name Records which would subsequently be re-released as "The Cure" later. Their sound earned them recognition in the independent music scene, playing with bands such as Vaux and the SXSW festival. Nitro Records soon took interest and signed the band, releasing their only full-length "Dead Rhythm Machine" in early 2005, to much critical acclaim from magazines such as Alternative Press among many others.
