Playing career
As a youth, Országh played in the 1991 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a team from Poprad.

After becoming an unrestricted free agent after the 1999–2000 NHL season, Országh signed a contract with the Djurgårdens IF hockey team of the Swedish Elitserien, based in Stockholm. In Sweden, he had a breakthrough season, scoring 23 goals and marking 13 assists, for a combined total of 36 points. The scouts of the Nashville Predators of the NHL noticed Országh's solid performance and signed him as a free agent the following season. In his time with the Predators, he has tallied 105 points (47 goals and 58 assists) and he has also helped them earn their first play-off spot in the team's six-year history. Throughout his six years of NHL experience, Országh wore the number 33 jersey and has played both the left wing and the right wing positions. On December 30, 2005, Országh joined the St. Louis Blues after he was claimed off of waivers. Orszagh missed the entire 2006–2007 season due to a knee injury.
