Monte Moir (born September 10, 1958) is an American songwriter, producer and musician best known as the keyboardist of Morris Day's band The Time and songwriter of many notable American artists.

Biography
Monte Moir is the original and current keyboardist for The Time, as well as a songwriter and producer for Janet Jackson, Alexander O'Neal, Gladys Knight, as well as the duo Deja (Curt Jones & Starleana Young). He is also credited for working with Prince, Vanity 6, Deniece Williams, Thelma Houston, Steven Dante, Lolly Pop, Precious Wilson and various other artists.

Some of his greatest writing successes were writing the first side of Alexander O'Neal's solo debut – including "If You Were Here Tonight" and "The Pleasure Principle' by Janet Jackson. Patti Austin and Thelma Houston are other notable artists he wrote classics for as part of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis's 'The Secret'. Monte is something of a cult writing figure in the world of soulful music. "In My Life" by Ruby Turner as well as Steven Dante's "It's Only Love" are key examples of his songwriting.

He left The Time soon after Jam and Lewis were released by Prince, following conflicting writing interests with The SOS Band and failing to make a concert. However, he rejoined The Time for their Pandemonium album and Prince's film Graffiti Bridge, in the late 1980s when the original Time members reunited.

Moir continues to compose his own material and produce for various artists.  He was credited on Rihanna's 2016 Billboard number one hit "Work" and most recently surfaced at the 2020 Grammy Award Salute To Prince.
