September 11, 2001
As a result of the September 11, 2001 attacks and the subsequent grounding of international flights, Gander Collegiate became one of many buildings that had to be converted into makeshift hostels. Specifically, passengers of Lufthansa Flight LH400 became residents of Gander Collegiate during this time. Necessities such as food and drink were provided through the cafeteria while television coverage of events and access to computers and internet was provided through the school's facilities.
