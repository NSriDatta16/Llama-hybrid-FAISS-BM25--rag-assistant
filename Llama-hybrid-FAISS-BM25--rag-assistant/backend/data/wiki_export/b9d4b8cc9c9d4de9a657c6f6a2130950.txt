History
The station opened in 1871 on the North British Railways Coatbridge branch and the City of Glasgow Union Railway cross-city line from Shields Junction.  The City of Glasgow Union Railway (CGUR) added a branch northwestwards to  in 1875, to give access to the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway main line at Cowlairs by means of running powers over the E&G Sighthill Branch, whilst the impressive terminus at  opened a year later.  Services on the Coatbridge route did not run there however, the NBR instead using a separate terminus known as College situated on the end of a short spur from the CGUR route southwest of Bellgrove.  This only lasted until 1886, when the Glasgow City and District Railway was opened from  via a low level station at Queen Street to join the CGUR at High Street East Junction.  This was henceforth used by all services from the Coatbridge &  direction and also by the newly inaugurated passenger services to Springburn (trains had been progressively introduced on the route prior to this, but only as far as ).

The North British company took over the CGUR in 1896 jointly with the Glasgow and South Western Railway, operating all services on the Springburn line thereafter.  Local traffic on the remainder of the line from St Enoch declined in the face of strong competition from the local tram network and by 1902, the one intermediate station at Gallowgate had been closed.  Services continued to run from St Enoch to  until 1913, but thereafter the line was only used by freight & parcels traffic, periodic excursions & other special trains.

Services beyond Airdrie were withdrawn by British Railways in January 1956, whilst St Enoch closed to passengers a decade later in June 1966 and was subsequently demolished.  One more positive development was the North Clyde Line electrification scheme of 1960, which brought overhead wiring to the Queen St LL - Airdrie & Springburn routes in November that year.

The former CGUR route is still used by freight and empty stock transfer moves between Queen Street High Level or Eastfield depot and the city's other main DMU depot at  on the south side of Glasgow, whilst the Bathgate link was restored by Network Rail in 2010, after an absence of 28 years.

Bellgrove rail crash 

On 6 March 1989, the station was the scene of a head-on collision between two  trains on the Springburn branch in which two people died.
