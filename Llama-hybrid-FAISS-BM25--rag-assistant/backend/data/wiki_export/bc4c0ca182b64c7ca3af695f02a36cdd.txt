Characters and story
King Features describes Crock as "the greatest and longest-running parody of the Foreign Legion classic, Beau Geste," written in 1924 by P. C. Wren and filmed several times. The comic strip is set in the middle of a barren desert at a desolate fort, where the tyrannical and corrupt Commandant Vermin P. Crock rules over a curious group of beleaguered legionnaires. The characters include:

 the cowardly Captain Poulet (French for chicken),
 the simple-minded Maggot who digs and digs,
 Figowitz (who just wants a kind word),
 Le Cesspool owner Grossie (Le Cesspool is a favorite, though dilapidated hangout for the characters) who is married to Maggot,
 the narcissistic Preppie,
 Mario the Bartender,
 Jules Schmesse who is always about to be executed,
 the Arab horde and their stone god Nebookanezzer, who resembles a moai,
 the ancient sage, never seen, who lives in a cave and dispenses wisdom and sarcasm,
 the men of Outpost 5,
 the Bookmobile,
 the men being punished in the heat boxes,
 Quench the ever-dry camel,
 the Lost Patrol who have been wandering the desert for 20 years, trying to find their way back to the fort.

TV appearance
A live action Crock sketch was included in the special Mother's Day Sunday Funnies broadcast May 8, 1983 on NBC.

Theme park
Crock is featured in the Universal Studios Florida theme park Islands of Adventure, where Crock's fort is part of Toon Extra in Toon Lagoon.
