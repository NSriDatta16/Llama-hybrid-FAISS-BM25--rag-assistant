Hedlund sang in the Swedish bands Clifftones and Hep Stars in the 1960s. In 1968, the singer Charlotte Walker (born 1944) became a member of the band, and they formed the duo Svenne and Lotta (called "Sven and Charlotte" in several countries) the following year. 

The couple were married from 1969 until they divorced in 2014.

Hedlund died in Värnamo on 3 December 2022, at the age of 77 from COVID-19.
