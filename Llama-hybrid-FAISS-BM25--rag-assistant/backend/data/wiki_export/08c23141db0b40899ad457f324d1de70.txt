Life and career
Louise Lorraine was born Louise Escovar in San Francisco, California. One day, a photography salesman knocked on the door of the Los Angeles home where Lorraine lived with her widowed mother and five siblings. The door was answered by Lorraine. The salesman was so taken aback by her looks and demeanor that he told her mother she should be in films, then silent films and he happened to have a contact with Ince Studio. Initially, Lorraine's mother refused, but eventually she gave in.

Lorraine began working in films as an extra and "a bathing girl" before she gained leading roles in comedies for independent studios. After that, she spent time at MGM and Universal. She became very popular in action-filled serials such as The Radio King and With Stanley in Africa in 1922.

She starred in 11 in all, showing much energy and charisma, not as much seen in many of her colleagues in that genre. Lorraine was selected one of the WAMPAS Baby Stars in 1922.

She starred in only five talkies in her film career, including Near the Rainbow's End (1930), co-starring Bob Steele. Following this film, she retired from the film industry to devote her time with her husband and two children.
