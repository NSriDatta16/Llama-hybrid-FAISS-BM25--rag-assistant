This is a list of the stories in Richard Francis Burton's translation of One Thousand and One Nights. Burton's first ten volumes—which he called The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night—were published in 1885.  His Supplemental Nights were published between 1886 and 1888 as six volumes.  Later pirate copies split the very large third volume into two volumes. The nights are in the style of stories within stories, and the frame story is The Story Of King Shahryar of Persia and His Brother or The Story Of King Shahryar and Queen Shahrazad, in which Shahrazad tells tales to her husband Shahryar.

NOTE: The stories in this collection contains both Sunni and Shi'ite stories and does not follow a specific timeline or chronology. The numbers in parentheses indicate that the night in question began (and the previous night ended) during the tale indicated (or one of its sub-tales). Numbers in double parentheses mean that the story is fully contained in the indicated night. An asterisk indicates the story begins with the night.
