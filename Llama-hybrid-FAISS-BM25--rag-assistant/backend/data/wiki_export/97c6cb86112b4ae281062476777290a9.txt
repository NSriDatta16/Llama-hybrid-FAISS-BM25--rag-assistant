Thomas Morgan Woodward (September 16, 1925 – February 22, 2019) was an American actor who is best known for his recurring role as Marvin "Punk" Anderson on the television soap opera Dallas and for his portrayal of Boss Godfrey, the sunglasses-wearing "man with no eyes", in the 1967 film Cool Hand Luke. On TV, he was a familiar guest star on cowboy shows. On the long-running Western Gunsmoke, he played 16 different characters in 19 episodes (including a pair of two-part stories), the most such appearances of any actor on the show. He also had a recurring role on The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp.

Early years
Woodward was born in Fort Worth, Texas, the third of five sons of Dr. Valin Woodward and his wife, Frances McKinley. He grew up in Arlington, Texas, graduating from high school in 1944. After serving in the U.S. Army Air Corps during World War II, he enrolled at North Texas Agriculture College, where he was active in the theater. He graduated in 1948 with a bachelor's of business administration in finance. He attended law school at the University of Texas at Austin. During that time, he hosted a local radio talk show and sang with a barbershop quartet and a dance band.

Military service
Woodward was a member of the United States Army Air Force during World War II. He flew his first plane at the age of 16 years. He returned to the military during the Korean War in the now-Military Air Transport Service.

Acting career

Westerns
One of Woodward's longest television roles was in 42 episodes between 1958 and 1961 on the ABC television series The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp as the deputy/sidekick "Shotgun" Gibbs. Woodward made a dozen guest appearances on Wagon Train between 1958 and 1965, and many appearances in Gunsmoke, Rawhide, and Bonanza.

In the 1966 episode "Hugh Glass Meets the Bear" of the syndicated anthology series, Death Valley Days, Woodward was cast as Thomas "Broken Hand" Fitzpatrick. John Alderson played Hugh Glass, who after being mauled by a bear and abandoned by Fitzpatrick, crawled 200 miles to civilization.
