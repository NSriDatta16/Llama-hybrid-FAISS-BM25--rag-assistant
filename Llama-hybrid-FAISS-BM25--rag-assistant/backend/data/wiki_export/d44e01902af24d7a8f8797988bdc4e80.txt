David Lawrence Shaw (14 November 1950 – 23 August 2022) was a British politician who served as a Member of Parliament (MP). He was the Conservative Member for Dover from the 1987 general election until the 1997 election, when he lost the seat to Gwyn Prosser of Labour. He was one of the first British Members of Parliament to use the Internet to communicate.

Early life
Shaw was born on 14 November 1950. He was educated at the King's College School, Wimbledon and the City of London Polytechnic.

Political career
Shaw contested the Leigh, Greater Manchester, constituency at the 1979 general election, but was not elected.

Shaw was embroiled in the Pamella Bordes scandal after providing her with a House of Commons security pass.  Bordes was "his part-time unpaid researcher" from the end of December 1988 until 21 February 1989, working on the Net Book Agreement.

In January 1998 the then Prime Minister Tony Blair described Shaw who had lost his seat nine months before as being "[both] nasty and ineffectual in equal quantities."

At the 2001 general election he stood in the London constituency of Kingston and Surbiton against the Liberal Democrat MP Ed Davey, who was defending a majority of just 56 from the election four years earlier. In the event, Davey held the seat with a majority increased by over 15,000.
