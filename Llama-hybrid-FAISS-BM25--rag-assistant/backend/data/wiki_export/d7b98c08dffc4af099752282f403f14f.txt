Navigation Road is a station that serves both Northern Trains and Manchester Metrolink located in the east of Altrincham, in Greater Manchester, England. It consists of a Northern-operated heavy rail station on the Mid-Cheshire Line, and an adjoining light rail stop on the Altrincham Line of Greater Manchester's Metrolink network. The original heavy rail element of the station was opened by the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway in 1931, and the Metrolink element opened in 1992. A level crossing operates at the southern end of the station.

History

The station originally opened on 20 July 1931 on  the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway (MSJAR) following the electrification of that line, and was referred to as Navigation Road (Altrincham) on early tickets, timetables, etc. British Rail electric trains between Manchester and Altrincham ceased serving the station on 24 December 1991. The former Altrincham-bound (down) platform has since  been used for Mid-Cheshire Line trains and  the former Manchester-bound (up) platform reopened as a Metrolink stop on 15 June 1992.
Freight trains also operate through Navigation Road, including heavy block trains carrying limestone from quarries at Tunstead (near Buxton) to alkali works at Northwich.

Facilities
There is a car park on the Metrolink side of the station with 65 spaces plus 5 disabled spaces.

In January 2018 a ticket machine was installed within the shelter on the heavy rail side of the station. Pre-ordered tickets can be collected here as well as buying tickets for journeys from this station.

The nearest hospitality venues to the Navigation Road stop are The Waiting Room Cafe at A4 studios and The Hive by VH Interiors a General Store & Beverage Bar, both located on Grosvenor Road on the way into Altrincham.
