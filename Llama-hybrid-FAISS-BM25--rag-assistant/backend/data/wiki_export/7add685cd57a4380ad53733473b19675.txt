Corinthian Pointe is a large planned affordable subdivision located in Houston, Texas, in the United States. It is a part of the larger master planned community Pointe 2.3.4, and is within the 5 Corners District.

Corinthian Pointe is located immediately outside the 610 Loop and inside Beltway 8 near Reliant Park. The Windsor Village United Methodist Church's Reverend Kirbyjon Caldwell, Pyramid Residential Community Corporation, and Ryland Homes established the community in the 2000s; the church is the largest United Methodist Church in the United States. Caldwell said that the neighborhood is the largest residential subdivision in Houston that was developed by a non-profit group.  According to the church, it is the largest residential subdivision developed by a nonprofit group in the City of Houston.

The community, which spans , included 462 homes by the end of 2006. The subdivision cost 173 million United States dollars to build. About 80% of the subdivision's homes are classified as "affordable" by the City of Houston according to Genora Boykins, the chairperson of Pyramid Residential Community Corporation.

The West Orem Family YMCA built for $7 million, Kingdom Builders' Community Center built for $68 million and including a church and a prayer center, the Zina Garrison Tennis Center built for $3.5 million, an independent living center built for $8.1 million, a children's medical clinic built for $1 million, and retail outlets that are next to and were developed for the subdivision.

History
Around 2000 Kirbyjon Caldwell wanted to build a prayer chapel. He found a  plot. The owners were not willing to break up the entire plot, so a nonprofit development purchased the entire plot. That section became Pointe 2.3.4.

Corinthian Pointe opened in 2000, and construction of the first houses finished that year. Back then the average selling price per house was $80,000 ($ in today's money). Boykins said that low income families who received down-payment assistance from the City of Houston bought one third of the homes in the neighborhood. 451 homes opened prior to April 2006, and 11 homes were scheduled to be completed by the end of the year. By April 2006 the average selling price was $106,000 per home ($ in today's money). Of the houses, 80 percent were sold at below-market prices to lower income families; the selling prices ranging from $69,000 ($ in today's money) to $103,990 ($ in today's money). The rest of them were sold between the $100,000s (range beginning at $ in today's money) and the $140,000s (range beginning at $ in today's money).

George E. Johnson Sr., the community's developer, said that because Corinthian Pointe was successful, other homebuilders decided to build on nearby plots of land. Johnson said "Here's a market that's been overlooked. It's not too far from downtown, but the growth had passed over it".
