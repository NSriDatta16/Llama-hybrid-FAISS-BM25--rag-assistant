Renée (without the accent in non-French speaking countries) is a French/Latin feminine given name and surname.

Renée is the female form of René, with the extra –e making it feminine according to French grammar. The name Renée is the French form of the late Roman name Renatus and the meaning is reborn or born again. In medieval times, the meaning was associated with the Christian concept of being spiritually born again through baptism.

Renee was among the top 100 names given to girls in the United States in the late 1950s, the 1960s, the 1970s and the early 1980s. It ranked as the 734th most popular name given to American girls in 2008 and is continuing to fall in popularity.
