History
Mesudiye has been inhabited since the Iron Age era and has numerous remains from the time of the Hittites and there are a number of rock tombs from early antiquity in the area. When it was brought into the Ottoman Empire by Mehmed II in 1455 the area was a collection of mountain villages centred on the slightly larger village and market place known then as Milas. This was renamed Hamidiye in 1876 and then Mesudiye in 1908. According to Bryer and Winfield, the later Greek name for Mesudiye (or Hamidiye) was Meletios, Melet, or Milas (Grk: Μελέτιος, Μελέτ, or Μήλας), probably derived from the Melanthios River (Melet Irmak) which runs through it and down to Ordu.
