SeaWorld San Diego is a theme park located in Mission Bay Park, San Diego, California, United States. Owned and operated by SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, the park is an animal-focused marine mammal park, oceanarium, marine animal rehabilitation center, and aquarium with both indoor and outdoor aquatic exhibits. The park's shared waters of Mission Bay connect directly to the Pacific Ocean, and it is this location which enables the rescuing, rehabilitating and re-releasing of injured, orphaned or stranded marine animals.

SeaWorld San Diego is a member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). Adjacent to the property is the Hubbs-SeaWorld Research Institute, which conducts marine biology research, provides educational and outreach programs on marine issues to the general public, and provides information on the park's animal exhibits.

History

SeaWorld is located on San Diego's Mission Bay. SeaWorld was founded on March 21, 1964, by four graduates of the University of California, Los Angeles. Although their original idea of an underwater restaurant was not feasible at the time, the idea was shifted into a  marine zoological park along the shore of Mission Bay in San Diego. After an investment of about $1.5 million, the park opened with 45 employees, several dolphins, sea lions, and two seawater aquariums. It hosted more than 400,000 visitors in its first year of operation.

SeaWorld began as a private partnership before going public in 1968, allowing it to expand and open new parks. The second SeaWorld location, SeaWorld Ohio, opened in 1970, followed by SeaWorld Orlando in 1973, and SeaWorld San Antonio (the largest of the parks) in 1988. The partnership later sold SeaWorld Ohio to Six Flags in January 2001. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich owned the parks between 1976 and 1989, when Anheuser-Busch Companies, Inc. purchased them. After InBev acquired Anheuser-Busch, it sold SeaWorld San Diego and the rest of the company's theme parks to the Blackstone Group in December 2009, which operates the park through its SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment division.

The land is currently leased by SeaWorld from the City of San Diego, with the lease set to expire in 2048. The premises must be used as a marine mammal park, and no other marine mammal park may be operated by SeaWorld within  of the city limits.

The park was closed between March 16, 2020, and April 12, 2021, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and two stay-at-home orders issued by California Governor Gavin Newsom.

Attractions

Shows
Many of SeaWorld's shows are seasonal and may change based on the time of year.

 Orca Encounter: a live show highlighting the park's killer whales and various aspects of their lives, biology and adaptations. Post-2015, the show focuses less on physically demanding (for the orcas) entertainment and more on showcasing the animals themselves. The show is an opportunity to teach the audience more about orcas without the use of “circus tricks” and over-stressing the animals.
 Dolphin Adventures: guests can meet the whale & dolphin family and learn what inspires their keepers. The name change simply came after the remodeling of the stage. It is still the same format as Dolphin Days.
 Sea Lion and Otter Spotlight: a new educational presentation that replaces “Sea Lions Live”, featuring California sea lions and Asian small-clawed otters.

Rides

Bayside Skyride
Bayside Skyride is a Von Roll type 101 gondola ride located in the northwest corner of the park behind the Bayside Amphitheater. It travels over the waters of west Mission Bay-Perez Cove for a 6-minute ride on two  towers, making a U-turn on the opposite side before returning, completing a full loop. Bayside Skyride has the longest span between towers out of any Von Roll Skyride ever built ().  From its opening in 1967 to 1988, the Skyride was known as the SeaWorld Atlantis Skyride, transporting riders to the SeaWorld Atlantis Restaurant, which was formerly located on the opposite end of the ride across the lagoon. After the restaurant closed, the ride remained, but took riders on one full loop, passing through the second station instead of stopping. A similar attraction in San Diego is the Skyfari at the San Diego Zoo.

Ocean Explorer
Ocean Explorer is a children's realm that opened on May 27, 2017. The area includes four rides: Aqua Scout, a ride that bounces in mini submarines, Octarock, a swing that rocks back and forth, Sea Dragon Drop, a child-size drop tower and Tentacle Twirl, a jellyfish-themed wave swing ride. This addition also features an original 45 minute orchestral soundtrack by composer Rick McKee.

The realm originally featured Submarine Quest, an outdoor people mover-like ride with indoor segments, themed around deep sea exploration. The ride cars featured a touchscreen dashboard that contained minigames and interactions during the ride. Amid negative reviews, the ride only began to operate intermittently after the summer season, and quietly closed indefinitely in 2018 with little fanfare. SeaWorld staff initially indicated that Submarine Quest had been temporarily closed for maintenance, but by May 2018 references to the ride had been removed from SeaWorld's maps and website.
