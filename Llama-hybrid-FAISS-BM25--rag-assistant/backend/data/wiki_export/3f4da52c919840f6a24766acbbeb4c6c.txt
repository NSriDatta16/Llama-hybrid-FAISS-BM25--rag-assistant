"Who's David" is a song by British pop punk band Busted. It was released on 16 February 2004 as the second single from their second studio album, A Present for Everyone (2003). It was co-written by Tom Fletcher of McFly. The single features the live version of "Teenage Kicks", which the band performed at the 2004 Brit Awards ceremony. In response to being frequently asked "who is David?", Willis claimed that David is the name of his facial mole.

The song was written about experiences with a girl who is unfaithful. It peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart, becoming the band's third number-one single and their second consecutive.

Critical reception
In August 2004, "Who's David" came 20th in a VH1 viewer survey of the worst number-one singles of all time.

In her review of Busted's May 2016 show at Wembley Arena during the Pigs Can Fly Tour 2016, The Daily Telegraphs Alice Vincent wrote: "Who's David, which paints its female muse crudely, has dated badly – especially when misogynistic epithets came from the mouths of now fully grown men." When asked about it by Harriet Gibsone of The Guardian, Bourne seemed confused; Willis replied "Basically, it's not cool to call women bitches any more.", whilst Simpson said "[he was] not sure it ever was."

Music video
The official music video features Busted before they go on stage for a gig at Wembley Arena. The video begins with the band backstage, followed by thousands of fans piling into the arena. Busted are swamped by paparazzi as they go towards the stage, but are helped there by management. The video ends with Busted running up a ramp onto the stage.
