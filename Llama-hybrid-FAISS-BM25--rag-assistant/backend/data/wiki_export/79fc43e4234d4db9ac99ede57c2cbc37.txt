Notable players

Lorenzo Charles (a.k.a. "Zo") of the famous national champion N.C. State wolfpack. 6' 7" Forward.
Greg Newton - 6' 11" Center Duke University.  Cougars literature noted that Mr. Newton was 1 away from Duke's all-time top 10 in blocks.  (This is no longer the case).
Amere May - After averaging 13 points per game, Amere left Division II Shaw University early to declare for the 1997 NBA draft.  Was quoted by Sports Illustrated as saying that he thought no one in the NBA could stop his game.  One observer quipped that he was right - no one in the NBA ever would stop his game.  Amere was a strong performer off the bench for the Cougars.
Chuck Kornegay - Powerful big man from Villanova University (he transferred there from NC State). Cougars fans dubbed him "the Chuck-wagon", a la NBA star Charles Barkley.
Nate Higgs - Cheered on by the crowd: "Come on Nate-Dawg!  You're better than that!"
Jeremy Hyatt - 6' 6" sharpshooter from NC State
Donald Williams - 6' 3" North Carolina guard.

Trivia

The Cougars drafted National Basketball Association superstar Tracy McGrady in the fourth round of the 1997 USBL draft.
