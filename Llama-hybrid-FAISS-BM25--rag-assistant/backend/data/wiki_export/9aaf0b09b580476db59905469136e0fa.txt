Yippee, Yappee and Yahooey is a Hanna-Barbera animated television series that premiered September 16, 1964. It was presented as a segment of The Peter Potamus Show, along with Breezly and Sneezly and Peter Potamus.

Plot
Yippee, Yappee and Yahooey are dogs who serve the King as his Royal Guards. They are usually called the goofy guards by the king. They must always protect, serve and obey the King. They are loosely based on the Three Musketeers. The King doesn't like calling them, due to their incompetence the King ends up being accidentally hurt, bruised, squashed, and involved in various disasters in each episode.  At times, the three heroes find themselves fighting a fire-breathing dragon and other villains. A common mistake in nearly every short is that Yippee, Yappee and Yahooey's voices tend to get mixed up with one another. Irving Berlin wrote a stage show while in the Army during World War I entitled "Yip Yip Yaphank" at Camp Yaphank from which names were taken for this cartoon. Yahooey spoke very much like Jerry Lewis.
