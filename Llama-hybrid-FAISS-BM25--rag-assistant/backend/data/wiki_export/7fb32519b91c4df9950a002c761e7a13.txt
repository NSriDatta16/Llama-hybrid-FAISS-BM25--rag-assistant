Zvonimir "Rale" Rašić OAM (; 26 December 1935 – 8 June 2023) was a Serbian-Australian association football player, coach and media personality.

Playing career
Born in Dole, Littoral Banovina, Kingdom of Yugoslavia, Rasic begin his career playing in Yugoslav clubs. Also known as Zvonko Rasic, Zvonko being a usual diminutive for Zvonimir, he played with FK Proleter Zrenjanin, FK Vojvodina, FK Spartak Subotica and FK Borac Banja Luka.  He migrated to Australia in 1962, but returned to Yugoslavia after 18 months to serve in the army. His obligations met, Rasic returned to Australia, and played football in the Victorian league.

Managerial career
Rasic revolutionised the game in Australia, he was appointed coach in 1970 at just 34 years of age, and in 1974, he led the Australia national team to the World Cup as coach.

After the World Cup, the Australian Soccer Federation sacked Rasic, replacing him with Englishman Brian Green. Rasic and others believe that he was dumped because he was not seen as being a real "Aussie." He has stated, "They took from me something that I was doing better than anyone else. I was a true-blue Aussie and nobody can deny that. I taught the players how to sing the national anthem."

Rasic was a television presenter on SBS, during the Australian network's 2006 FIFA World Cup coverage. His biography, "The Rale Rasic Story," was published in 2006 by New Holland.

Death
Rasic died on 8 June 2023, at the age of 87.

Honours
Rasic was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1989. In 2001, he was awarded the Australian Sports Medal and the Centenary Medal for "services to soccer", and was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) in the 2004 Australia Day Honours for "service to soccer as a player, coach and administrator."
