"I Should've Never Let You Go" is a song by Australian female group Bardot, and was the second single from their debut album Bardot (2000). It was co-written by Lotti Golden, Hinda Hicks and Tommy Faragher and produced by Faragher. The single peaked at number 14 on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart and was certified gold. It was the 96th-highest-selling single of Australia in 2000. In New Zealand, the song reached number 25. The B-side, "Do It for Love", is a cover version of a 1992 single by Dannielle Gaha, written by Paul Gray (ex-Wa Wa Nee) and R. Feldman.

Music video

The music video is semi-animated. It features the group in a recording studio flying through space before transforming into animated superheroes whose mission must defeat a giant green monster. In the end, they succeed, and once their mission is complete, return to their real-life selves. Bardot's then-manager, Michael Napthali, makes a small cameo, rounding up the girls back into the recording studio before the end of the song.
