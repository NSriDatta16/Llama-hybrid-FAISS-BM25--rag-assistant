Werner – Beinhart! (1990) 
Despite its relatively small population of approx. 4,000 citizens, Süderbrarup was instantly catapulted into the limelight of the German cinema, due to an opening scene in German cartoonist Rötger Feldmann's infamous first full-length feature release "Werner – Beinhart!" in 1990. This wacky, shrewd cartoon depicts a local plumber's apprentice and full-time motorcycle rocker in his zany adventures at work and with his notoriously drunk colleagues. In the relevant scene of this animated feature, the protagonist observes an impromptu soccer match at the weekly farmer's market - sparked by mistake. Werner, comments the accidental match between the market's visitors referring to the players as part of the real local soccer teams TSV Süderbrarup and the regional rival soccer club from Holzbein Kiel ("Holzbein Kiel" - German for "Pegleg Kiel" - a pun on the real Holstein Kiel soccer club).
