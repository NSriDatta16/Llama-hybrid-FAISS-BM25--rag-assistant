The Association of Physicians of Pakistani Descent of North America (APPNA) is an American nonprofit organization headquartered in Westmont, Illinois, United States. It is one of the largest medical associations in the United States.

APPNA is the largest medical organization of expatriate Pakistanis.

Founding 
In 1976, Dr. Zaheer Ahmed, a Pakistani gastroenterologist based in Michigan, envisioned an idea of a professional organization of Pakistani physicians in the U.S and Canada that would provide a platform for social gatherings and a vehicle for educational and humanitarian projects in Pakistan. APPNA was registered in the state of Michigan as a non-profit charitable organization on 29 August 1978. The Internal Revenue Service granted it tax exempt status in 1983.

Representation in Pakistan Government Health Task Force 
In December 2021, Prime Minister of Pakistan Imran Khan gave APPNA representation in his government's health task force for getting its input towards improving the healthcare system in the country.

Meetings 
APPNA holds four meetings through the year. Its meetings present opportunities for continuing medical education as well as social get-togethers. The four meetings are:

 Spring meeting
 Annual summer convention
 Fall meeting
 Winter meeting

Activism 
Amidst news of the exorbitantly high prices of the COVID-19 vaccine set in Pakistan, APPNA wrote to the Prime Minister to express its concern. "A human tragedy must not be allowed to be used for profiteering," the APPNA association pleaded in the letter. The association recommended that the government should undertake the task of importing the vaccine itself, "on an emergent basis" as it is "best positioned to negotiate favorable rates with manufacturers." The group of doctors noted that although ideally the vaccine should be available to all free of cost, but if the country's financial situation did not allow it, it should be sold "at no more than cost". It also urged for subsidies to be provided to the poor regardless.

In March 2022, the United States Department of State acknowledged APPNA's efforts for COVID-19 relief.

APPNA members offer free community healthcare through free clinics.
