Early life

Music career

1987–1994: Career beginnings and "Take Me in Your Arms"
At 8 years old, Melone got her first contract with Fever Records, and in 1988 released her first single, "Randy".

At age 12 she joined the label Warlock Records. In November 1991, Melone released her first studio album, Love Can't Wait, which was produced by Tony Garcia. It was preceded by the single "Take Me in Your Arms" which peaked at No. 67 on the Billboard Hot 100. Another single, "Falling in Love", was released in 1992. She was named Billboard magazine's Best New Dance Artist that year, making her the youngest artist ever to receive the honor.

In early 1994, her second album Back to Dance was released. This album was again produced by Tony Garcia. "Turn the Beat Around" was released in late 1993 as the sole single from the album but was not successful. Due to the limited success of the album, Lil Suzy left Warlock Records and went on to become president of her own record label, Empress Records.

1995–1997: "Promise Me" and later releases
In April 1995, Melone released her third album, Life Goes On, a eurodance release. The album spawned four singles, the first being "Promise Me", which peaked at No. 62 on the Billboard Hot 100.

In 1997, Melone released her fourth studio album, Paradise. The album spawned four singles; Can't Get You Out of My Mind was the most successful of these releases. The album contains a collaboration with singer Crystal Waters on the track "Lost Love Letter". This album also contains a cover of the Netzwerk song, "Memories".

In 2009, Melone released the single "Dance Tonight".

In 2015 and 2022 she toured in Freestyle Explosion shows.
