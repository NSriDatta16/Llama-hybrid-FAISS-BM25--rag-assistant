The 1990 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship was the 104th staging of the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship, the Gaelic Athletic Association's premier inter-county hurling tournament. The draw for the 1990 provincial fixtures took place in November 1989. The championship began on 13 May 1990 and ended on 2 September 1990.

Tipperary were the defending champions but were defeated by Cork in the Munster final. London qualified for the championship for the first time in two years.

On 2 September 1990, Cork won the championship following a 5–15 to 2–21 defeat of Galway in the All-Ireland final. This was their 27th All-Ireland title, their first in four championship seasons.

Cork's John Fitzgibbon was the championship's top scorer with 7-09. Cork's Tony O'Sullivan was the unanimous choice for Hurler of the Year.

Championship draw

As a result of the Republic of Ireland football team qualifying for the 1990 FIFA World Cup, the Munster Council took precautions in avoiding a fixtures clash and a potential loss of revenue by changing the dates and times of their games.
