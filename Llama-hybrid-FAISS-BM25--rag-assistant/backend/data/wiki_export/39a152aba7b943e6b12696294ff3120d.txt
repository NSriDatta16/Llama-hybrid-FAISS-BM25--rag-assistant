Mats Lidström (born 1959) is a Swedish solo cellist, recording artist, chamber musician, composer, teacher and publisher.

His first teacher was Maja Vogl, of the music conservatory in Gothenburg. He then went on to study at the Juilliard School (New York) with Leonard Rose whose own teaching goes straight back to Luigi Boccherini (via  Felix Salmond, Bernard Whitehouse, Alfredo Piatti and Gaetano Zanetti).

Lidström plays the "Grützmacher" Rocca (Giuseppe Rocca 1857).

Lidström commissioned and gave the world premiere of Rolf Martinsson's first cello concerto on 20 April 2005 with the BBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Mario Venzago.

In 1986 Lidström was invited to Moscow to play Dmitri Kabalevsky's Second Cello Concerto Op. 77 to the composer. Time was also spent with the composer in his home, sight-reading Lidström’s new Tango in C major. The concerto was later recorded on a CD and conducted by Vladimir Ashkenazy.

Lidström seeks out neglected but beautiful music for the cello and has produced several highly acclaimed and award-winning CDs. He appears on EMI, Deutsche Grammophon, Decca, BIS, Hyperion, Musica Sveciae, Opus 3, , as well as on his own label CelloLid.com.

Lidström has appeared on TV and radio throughout Europe, Japan, the U.S (including guest appearances on Andy Warhol's TV show Interiors) and South America.

He has performed at many festivals including Aspen, Kingston, Pensacola (USA), Cello Encounter (Rio de Janeiro) and across Europe, including the Netherlands, Italy, Poland, Bulgaria, Denmark, Spain and Sweden.

Lidström was the artistic director of the 2004/05 festival From Sweden in London, the greatest undertaking for Swedish classical music abroad by the Swedish government.

His ancestor on his father's side, Richard Dybeck, wrote the Swedish national anthem.

Education publications

Lidström's compilation of orchestral excerpts for Boosey & Hawkes, The Orchestral Cellist, formed the basis for his publishing company CelloLid.com.

The Essential Warm-up Routine for Cellists gives practical guidance and daily warm-up exercises to support all facets of cello-playing.

The Beauty of Scale (made possible through a research grant from the Royal Academy of Music) explores the standard scales and contains chapters on alternative scales such as pizzicato, unisons, 4ths and 7ths, and also on how to practise scales.
