Stevie Wonder Live is a 1970 live album by American musician Stevie Wonder on the Tamla (Motown) label. The second live collection by the singer-songwriter, it was released during the crossroads of Wonder's career as he was preparing to negotiate a new contract with Motown that gave him artistic control over his work.

The M.C. heard on the recording is veteran Detroit DJ Scott Regen, who can also be heard on the 1966 albums Temptations Live! and Four Tops Live!.

At 60:37 long, this was a remarkably long running time for a single LP, especially for 1970 when albums typically ran for 35–40 minutes.
