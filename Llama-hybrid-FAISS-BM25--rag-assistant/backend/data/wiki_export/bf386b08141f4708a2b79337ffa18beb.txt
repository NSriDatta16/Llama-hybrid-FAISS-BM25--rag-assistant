The Long Ones is a rare compilation of novellas by American writer Joe R. Lansdale, which are too long to be "short stories", but too short to be "novels".  It was apparently only printed once, in hardcover form, in 1999.

Contents
Bubba Ho-Tep (nominated for Bram Stoker Award)  {originally published in The King Is Dead, ed. Paul M. Sammon (1994)}
The Events Concerning a Nude Fold-Out Found in a Harlequin Romance  (winner of Bram Stoker Award) {originally published in Dark at Heart, ed. Joe & Karen Lansdale (1992) }

Afterword

At the time, The Steam Man was exclusive to this collection, but it has been subsequently re-published in Mad Dog Summer as well as the short-story anthology Steampunk.
