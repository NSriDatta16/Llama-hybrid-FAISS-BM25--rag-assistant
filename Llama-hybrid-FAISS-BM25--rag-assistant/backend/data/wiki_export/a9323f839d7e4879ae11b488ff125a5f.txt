Altar is a Dutch death metal band.

History 
The band started in the early 1990s under various names, including Manticore and Anubis, in the town of Hardenberg. Eventually it settled on Altar. In 1992 it released its only demo, which landed it at Displeased Records. After five full-lengths the band split up in 2001. From time to time, the classic line-up reunites to play a limited number of shows under the name Altar-native.
