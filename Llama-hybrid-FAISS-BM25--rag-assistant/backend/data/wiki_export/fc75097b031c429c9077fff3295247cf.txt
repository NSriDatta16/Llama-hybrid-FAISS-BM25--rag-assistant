The village is situated approximately  to the north-east of York and near the border with the East Riding of Yorkshire. It, with Bossall parish, had a recorded population of about 100 in the 2001 Census.

The village was part of the Ryedale district between 1974 and 2023. It is now administered by North Yorkshire Council.

Aldby Hall and the Church of St John the Evangelist are at the centre of the village. To the west of Buttercrambe, on high ground, are the remains of a Roman Temporary Camp: a square enclosure, ditched and banked, constructed quickly by an army on manoeuvres in enemy territory and used either overnight or for a short period of time, and demolished upon abandonment of the site. The camp was constructed probably 20 years before the establishment of nearby Eboracum, Roman York, in 71Â AD.
