Almost Killed Me is the debut studio album by Brooklyn-based rock band the Hold Steady, released on March 16, 2004, on Frenchkiss Records. It is considered by many to be a concept album, with several recurring themes such as near-death experiences, parties and the fictional character Charlemagne. Its concept album roots are further explored with the recurring characters in Separation Sunday, the Hold Steady's second album, which uses the same characters introduced in Almost Killed Me. Almost Killed Me was ranked number 99 on Rolling Stones 100 Best Albums of the Decade.

While not a full-time member of the band at this time, future keyboard player Franz Nicolay makes a guest appearance on the album alongside the World/Inferno Friendship Society bandmate Peter Hess.
