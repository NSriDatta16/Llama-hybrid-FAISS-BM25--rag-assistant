Career

Political work 
Attie began his career in Democratic politics and government. He was chief White House and campaign speechwriter for Vice President Al Gore through the Florida recount in 2000. It was Attie who broke the news to Gore on election night – as he was about to deliver a concession speech Attie had written – that he was suddenly only 600 votes behind George W. Bush in Florida, and that the election might not be over.

Television 
After working in the real White House and on the campaign trail, Attie became a writer on the NBC-TV series The West Wing for the last five of the show's seven seasons, ultimately serving as supervising producer. Series creator Aaron Sorkin has written that Attie "made a big impact immediately," reducing the show's need for part-time consultants. A number of the show's key storylines came from Attie's own experiences in politics. In addition, according to David Remnick's biography of Barack Obama, The Bridge: The Life and Rise of Barack Obama, and other news sources, Attie used then-State Senator Obama as a model for the character of Matt Santos, a presidential candidate played by actor Jimmy Smits in the final two seasons of the show. Attie was nominated for Writers Guild and Humanitas awards for the episode "Election Day: Part 2", in which Santos wins the presidency. In 2020, Attie collaborated with Sorkin on new material for the show's HBO Max reunion special, A West Wing Special to Benefit When We All Vote.

Attie was a writer and co-executive producer on House for the last five of its eight seasons, and was nominated for a Humanitas award for the series finale, "Everybody Dies", which he co-wrote with series creator David Shore. He makes an uncredited appearance in the episode as well. 

Attie's more recent television credits include several seasons as a writer and producer on Showtime's hit Wall Street drama Billions -- he makes a brief appearance as a presidential aide in its series finale -- as well as on Netflix's upcoming limited series Zero Day and on Netflix's political thriller The Diplomat.

Other work 
In addition to his work in television, Attie's  screenplay "Smile Relax Attack" was included on the Black List, an industry list of executives' most-liked scripts, and he has done numerous uncredited movie rewrites.

He has also been a guest on political consultant David Axelrod's podcast "The Axe Files", and on Aimee Mann and Ted Leo's podcast "The Art of Process". Attie was a frequent guest on "The West Wing Weekly", a podcast that ran episode-by-episode through the entire series of The West Wing.

Attie has worked as a rock critic for The Washington Post, Slate, and other publications.

Attie is on the board of Let America Vote, a non-profit founded by Jason Kander that fights voter suppression.

Awards 

Attie is a seven-time Emmy nominee and a three-time WGA award nominee; he won an Emmy Award for "The West Wing Documentary Special" and a Peabody Award for co-writing the September 11th special America: A Tribute to Heroes. He won ASCAP's Deems-Taylor award for pop music writing.
