Darren Siwes (born 1968) is an Australian artist of Indigenous and Dutch descent. He was born in Adelaide, South Australia.

Siwes completed a Bachelor of Visual Arts (Hons), (1996) and a Graduate Diploma of Education (1997) at the University of South Australia.

Siwes has a unique style of photographing familiar South Australian landmarks, and using long exposure to reveal the ghostly figure of an Aboriginal man in a suit and tie onto the image. More recently he has used female figures in this same style. Siwes' work is political in this sense. He says he is inspired by contemporary Indigenous Australian artists such as Tracey Moffatt and Gordon Bennett, and is interested in exploring the possibilities of Aboriginal art in new forms and new media.

Siwes is represented by Greenaway Art Gallery in Adelaide and Nellie Castan Gallery in Melbourne.
