Maarten Lafeber (born 11 December 1974) is a Dutch professional golfer who won the Dutch, Swiss and Spanish amateur championships before turning professional in 1997.

Lafeber was born in Eindhoven, North Brabant. He earned a European Tour card at the first attempt, but lost it at the end of 1998. After spending time on the second tier Challenge Tour, where he won the 1999 Tusker Kenya Open, he regained his place on the main tour for the 2000 season. In 2003 he became the first home player to win the Dutch Open since Joop RÃ¼hl 1947, and that remains his only win on the European Tour. In July 2005 he reached a career high ranking of 88 in the World Golf Ranking.

Lafeber sold shares in himself to finance his career, and bought the shareholders out at a profit of 85% at the end of the 2004 season.
