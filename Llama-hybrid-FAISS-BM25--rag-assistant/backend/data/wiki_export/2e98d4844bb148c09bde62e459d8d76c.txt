The Northwestern Wildcats are the athletic teams that represent Northwestern University, located in Evanston, Illinois. Northwestern is a founding member of the Big Ten Conference and the only private university in the conference. Northwestern has eight men's and eleven women's NCAA Division I sports teams and is marketed as "Chicago's Big Ten Team". The mascot is Willie the Wildcat.

History
Northwestern is a charter member of the Big Ten Conference and has been the only private university in the conference since the University of Chicago left in 1946. With approximately 8,000 undergraduate students, it is the smallest school in the Big Ten.

Currently, Northwestern fields 19 intercollegiate athletic teams (8 men's and 11 women's) in addition to numerous club sports. Recent success by the Wildcats includes: Northwestern Football's bowl game victories (2016-2018 and 2020) and its 2018 and 2020 Big Ten West title; Women's Basketball winning the 2020 Big Ten regular season championship; Women's Lacrosse winning the 2019 and 2021 Big Ten tournament title and 2021 Big Ten Regular Season title; Women's Field Hockey winning the 2021 NCAA tournament title; Softball earning the 2019 and 2022 NCAA Regional Championship in Evanston and reaching the 2022 Women's College World Series; Wrestling's Sebastian Rivera winning an individual Big Ten championship in 2019 and Ryan Deakin winning an individual NCAA championship in 2022; Fencing claiming multiple Midwest Fencing Conference championships in 2018, 2019 and 2021; Women's Tennis securing the 2018 Big Ten regular season crown; and Women's Diver Olivia Rosendahl collecting individual NCAA championships in both 2018 and 2019.

Mascot
The Northwestern Athletics' mascot is Willie the Wildcat. However, the team's first mascot was a live, caged bear cub from the Lincoln Park Zoo named Furpaw. In fall 1923, Furpaw was driven to the playing field to greet the fans before each game. After a losing season, the team decided that Furpaw was the harbinger of bad luck and Willie made his debut ten years later in 1933. Willie initially debuted as a logo, coming to life later in 1947, when members of the Alpha Delta fraternity dressed up as him during the Homecoming parade. Now, Willie attends at least one event of each varsity sport throughout the year and dons replica uniforms whenever possible.

Origin of the name
Northwestern's athletic teams are nicknamed the Wildcats. Before 1924, they were known as "The Purple" and unofficially as "The Fighting Methodists." The name Wildcats was bestowed upon the university in 1924 by Wallace Abbey, a writer for the Chicago Daily Tribune who wrote that even in a loss to the University of Chicago, "Football players had not come down from Evanston; wildcats would be a name better suited to Coach Glenn Thistletwaite's boys." The team was also referred to in the article as "a Purple wall of wildcats." The name was so popular that university board members made "Wildcats" the official nickname just months later. In 1972, the student body voted to change the official nickname from "Wildcats" to "Purple Haze" but the new name never stuck.

Traditions

The Northwestern Wildcats have several traditions relating to its athletics teams including the official chant, "Go U! NU!” and the Wildcats' fight song, "Go U! Northwestern!” A secondary fight song is "Rise Northwestern (Push on Song),” the final 4-measure tag (ending with a shouted "Go 'Cats!”) of which is often played after first downs. The alma mater is played by the Marching Band and sung by fans, students, and the team after each game. Victories by the football team are celebrated by lighting the face of the clock tower on south campus in Northwestern purple.

In addition, Northwestern Football honors former head coach Randy Walker with a pregame "Walk with Us" event before each home football game where the band, cheerleaders, and fans greet the team as they arrive to Ryan Field and head to the locker room. Additionally, the Northwestern Wildcats share an intrastate rivalry with the Illinois Fighting Illini and its football programs play for the Land of Lincoln Trophy after retiring the Sweet Sioux Tomahawk Trophy in 2008.

Athletics Department

Leadership 
Northwestern Athletics, also known as the Northwestern University Department of Athletics and Recreation, is led by Combe Family Vice President for Athletics and Recreation, Dr. James J. (Jim) Phillips. Phillips became Northwestern's 21st director of intercollegiate athletics and recreation in April 2008. Phillips has earned several awards and appointments including the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics (NACDA) Under Armour Athletic Director of the Year in both 2012 and 2016, the 2018 Sports Business Journal Athletic Director of the Year, and Vice Chair of the 2020–21 NCAA Men's Basketball Selection Committee, expected to chair the committee in the following year. Phillips leads the department with focus on providing student-athletes with a "world-class experience" that enables them to thrive academically, socially, and athletically.

Under Phillips' leadership, Northwestern student-athletes have achieved impressive academic feats. Northwestern scored a 98-percent in the latest Graduation Success Rate (GSR), a figure which led all FBS schools for the second consecutive year. The Wildcats have scored a 96-percent or higher in every year that GSR data has been released, finishing in the top four among FBS schools all 15 years. Additionally, Phillips oversaw the creation of the department's NU for Life program, providing student-athletes with professional development opportunities and resources, as well as the department's first-ever community relations position, dedicated to connecting the department with the community. Moreover, Northwestern Athletics launched the ongoing "Chicago's Big Ten Team" campaign and the first master facility plan study with Phillips at the helm.

Phillips has a bachelor's degree from the University of Illinois, a master's degree in education from Arizona State University, and a PhD in educational administration from the University of Tennessee.

In January 2021, Phillips left Northwestern to become the commissioner of the Atlantic Coast Conference. Mike Polisky, Northwestern's deputy athletic director for external affairs since 2010, was promoted to replace Phillips. On May 12, 2021, amidst much controversy and protest from students and other members of the Northwestern community, Polisky stepped down. Schapiro named Northwestern linguistics professor Robert Gundlach as interim AD.

Under Armour Partnership 
In December 2011, Northwestern University announced a multiyear partnership with Under Armour as its official outfitter of the university's athletic program. Under Armour began outfitting the Northwestern Wildcats in 2012–13 and the partnership marked Under Armour's first with a Big Ten team. Now, Northwestern is one of three Big Ten teams sporting Under Armour gear.
Since the partnership began, the Wildcats have introduced a number of exclusive uniform designs, including its hallmark Gothic uniforms for several sports (debuted in 2014 with football), its Gothic Ice line in 2020 for women's lacrosse and softball, as well as the "By the Players" uniforms for the men's basketball program to debut on Senior Day each season. In addition, the football program's CFB 150th Anniversary uniforms, worn in 2019, earned the first place spot on Uniswag's weekly countdown that features the Top 10 college football uniforms each week.

Chicago's Big Ten Team 
In 2010, Northwestern Athletics launched its first-ever wide-ranging marketing campaign in department history. The ongoing "Chicago's Big Ten Team" campaign is intended to increase the Wildcats' presence around Chicago and raise local and regional awareness of Northwestern University. The Northwestern Wildcats reside in the city of Evanston and have a campus in Chicago along Lake Michigan. Northwestern remains the only Division I FBS institution in the Chicago area.

Over the last several years, the Northwestern Wildcats have increased their presence in the Chicago area through relationships with Chicago sports teams and venues. Under Phillips' direction, Northwestern sports programs have hosted games at U.S. Cellular Field (home of the Chicago White Sox) and Wrigley Field (home of the Chicago Cubs), in addition to partnering with the White Sox, Cubs, Blackhawks, and Arlington Park to host Northwestern-themed promotional days throughout the year.

The Foundation 
Northwestern Athletics' Studio N debuted The Foundation in 2015. It includes "exclusive access" inside team meetings and road trips in addition to hearing from the coaches and players on the sidelines and in the locker room. The Foundation won the Chicago/Midwest Regional Emmy Award for Outstanding Achievement in Sports Programs – Program Series in December 2017 and has earned multiple NACDA/SVG College Sports Video awards.

"The Foundation: Expect Victory" was an eight-episode series that reviewed Northwestern Football's run to the 1995 Big Ten Championship and Rose Bowl game. The series aired on Wednesdays during fall 2020 on NBC Sports Chicago and each episode was released online after each airing.

Sports sponsored

Football

The Northwestern Wildcats football team has evidence of organization as early as 1876, but evidence confirms that Northwestern football was played in 1882 as a group of Northwestern men played a "football heat" against a group of Lake Forest men. The Wildcats have since achieved an all-time high rank of No. 1 during the 1936 and 1962 seasons, which has thus far not been duplicated. The team plays home games at Ryan Field in Evanston, Illinois. 
Northwestern Football has played in a total of 16 bowl games, including 10 appearances in just 10 seasons between 2008 and 2020. The Wildcats won three consecutive bowl games in 2016–18. Despite the Wildcats challenging season in 2019, the 2020 season marked their most recent seasons of success. In 2020, the Wildcats were Big Ten West Champions and bowl game champions. In addition, defensive Coordinator, Mike Hankwitz, who has been with Northwestern Football since 2008, received his 400 career win on January 1, 2021. Perhaps the most memorable Northwestern Football season was in 1995 as the Wildcats won the Big Ten Championship and saw their first Rose Bowl berth in nearly 50 years. Despite recent success, the Wildcats still hold the record for the longest losing streak in Division I-A football with 34 consecutive losses between 1979 and 1982.

Following the sudden death of football coach Randy Walker in 2006, 31-year-old and former All-American Northwestern linebacker Pat Fitzgerald assumed the position becoming the youngest Division I FBS coach at the time. Fitzgerald is already the second-longest tenured Big Ten head coach, the sixth-longest tenured head coach in Division 1 Football Bowl Subdivision and has been head coach for the Wildcats since 2011. The Wildcats earned their first-ever Big Ten West title and berth in the Big Ten Championship game in 2018. Fitzgerald was named the consensus Big Ten Coach of the Year and a finalist for the 2018 Dodd Trophy that season. Most recently, Fitzgerald earned the 2020 Dodd Trophy Coach of the Year. On October 24, 2020, Fitzgerald recorded his 100th career win in a victory over Maryland. His overall record is 106–81.

Former Wildcats active in the National Football League going into the 2020 season include Ibraheim Campbell, Austin Carr, Garrett Dickerson, Joe Gaziano, Nate Hall, Blake Hance, Montre Hartage, Justin Jackson, Joe Jones, Tyler Lancaster, Dean Lowry, Sherrick McManis, Ifeadi Odenigbo, Trevor Siemian, Clayton Thorson, Dan Vitale, and Anthony Walker, Jr.

Collins was named as one of four finalists for the Naismith Men's Coach of the Year award in 2017.

The Wildcats single national championship is from 1931, retro-picked by the Helms Athletic Foundation and, later, by the Premo-Porrett Power Poll. Since then, the Wildcats have played in the National Invitation Tournament seven times, most recently in 2012. 
The men's basketball program was the first to open the renovated Welsh-Ryan Arena on November 2, 2018, in an exhibition game against McKendree. The state-of-the-art facility was built to be the most accessible arena in college athletics and seats 7,039. The team is cheered on by the Wildside student section.

Women's lacrosse

Northwestern lacrosse has won the national championship in women's lacrosse five straight times, from 2005 to 2009, and then again in 2011 and 2012, giving them 7 championships in 8 years. In 2007, the team joined Maryland as the only other school to three-peat. The run started in 2005, when the team enjoyed a perfect season and defeated many long-established east-coast schools after only five years as a varsity sport to capture the school's first national championship since 1941. In doing so, it became the westernmost institution to ever win the title. Soon after, the team made national news when members appeared in a White House photo with President Bush wearing thong sandals, or flip-flops, dubbed as the "White House flip-flop flap." The 2009 season also was an undefeated run. In their five consecutive championship seasons, the Wildcats have a 106–3 record. The Wildcats are led by head coach Kelly Amonte-Hiller, a role that she's been in since 2002.

Rivalries

Illinois Fighting Illini 
Northwestern's most prominent rivalry is with their Big Ten foe, the University of Illinois. The rivalry runs deep due to the schools' proximity to each other, history, and the Land of Lincoln Trophy between the football programs. The Land of Lincoln Trophy—popularly known as "The Hat" for its resemblance to and design modeled after Abraham Lincoln's hat—replaced the former football rivalry trophy, the Sweet Sioux Tomahawk Trophy. The Sweet Sioux was retired in 2008 after 64 seasons and the Land of Lincoln debuted the year following. Illinois leads the all-time series, 55-53-5, but Northwestern leads the Land of Lincoln Trophy series, 8–3, including victories in the last five consecutive meetings. The rivalry's first recorded game was in 1892 and resulted in a tie, 16-16.

University of Michigan Wolverines 
In February 2021, the football programs at Northwestern and the University of Michigan announced a new rivalry trophy called the George Jewett Trophy. The game honors George Jewett, the first Black player in Big Ten history, who played football for both universities in the 1890s. The game is the first trophy in Football Bowl Subdivision history to be named for a Black player.

Controversies
In May 2006 the website BadJocks.com republished photos a reader had found on Webshots of the women's soccer team hazing its freshmen. The whole team was suspended for a time as a result. In the wake of the incident, head coach Jenny Haigh resigned. Since, athletic director Mark Murphy named Stephanie Erickson, the school's all-time leader in goals and points, as Haigh's replacement.
