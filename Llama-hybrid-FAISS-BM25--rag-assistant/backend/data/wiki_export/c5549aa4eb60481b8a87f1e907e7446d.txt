The British International Motor Show was an annual (bi-annual after 1976) motor show held by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) between 1903 and 2008 in England.

Initially held in London at The Crystal Palace, Olympia and then the Earls Court Exhibition Centre, it moved to the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham in 1978, where it stayed until 2004. The International motorshow alternated with the London Motorfair which continued in Earl's Court from 1977 to 1999

The motorshow was held at ExCeL London in 2006 and 2008. The 2010 and 2012 events were cancelled due to the global financial crisis, and there was no 2014 show. The last British International Motor Show in the UK was 2008, and after the 2012 cancellation, ended the involvement of the SMMT. 

With the absence of an international show in England, between 2016 and 2019 there were annual motor shows held under the London Motor Show banner held in Battersea Park for the first two years and moved to Excel for 2019. The 2020 show was cancelled due to Covid-19.

The show was relaunched in 2021 with a new location at Farnborough under the banner of The British Motor Show and was the first motor show event to take place after the lifting of coronavirus measures.

History
Britain's first motor show—for horseless carriages—was held in South Kensington in 1896 at the Imperial Institute under the auspices of Lawson's Motor Car Club.

The first British Motor Show organised by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) was held at The Crystal Palace, London in 1903, the same year that the speed limit was raised from  to  by the Motor Car Act 1903 and two years before the formation of The AA.

In 1905, it moved to Olympia, London, where it was held for the next 32 years before moving to the Earls Court Exhibition Centre from 1937 until 1976, except for the period of World War II during which time there were no shows. From 1978 until 2004, it was held every second year at the National Exhibition Centre (NEC), Birmingham, with the 2004 event being held in May, rather than the traditional October, to avoid a clash with the Paris Motor Show. The 1980 event was attended by both the actor Lewis Collins and the stand-up comedian Stewart Lee.

The July 2006 and July 2008 shows were held at ExCeL London. The 2010 and 2012 shows were cancelled due to the global financial crisis.
