The ancient Nubian princess Amenirdis II, daughter of the Kushite pharaoh Taharqa of the 25th Dynasty, was adopted by Shepenupet II, daughter of Piye, to become Divine Adoratrice of Amun from around 650 BC to 640 BC during the 26th Dynasty. Amenirdis adopted Nitocris, daughter of Psamtik I, to become her successor. She may have been married to one of Taharqa's sons, king Atlanersa.
