Prayad Marksaeng (; born 30 January 1966) is a Thai professional golfer.

Career
Prayad was a member of Thailand's winning golf team at the 1987 South East Asian Games and turned professional in 1991. He has been a member of the Asian Tour since it began in its modern form in 1995. He has won seven events on the tour, becoming one of the first ten men to reach a million U.S. dollars in career earnings. He has also competed on the Japan Golf Tour and in 2008 won three tournaments in Japan.

Prayad represented Thailand at the 2007 and 2008 Omega Mission Hills World Cup and has been featured in the top 50 of the Official World Golf Ranking.

Prayad received a special invitation to play in the 2008 Masters Tournament. Marksaeng shot an 82 (+10) in the first round and withdrew midway through the second round due to a back injury.

At the age of 50, Prayad won the SMBC Singapore Open by one stroke over Phachara Khongwatmai, Jbe' Kruger, Juvic Pagunsan and Song Young-han. This event was co-sanctioned by the Japan Golf Tour and the Asian Tour. This win also guaranteed him a place in the 2017 Open Championship.
