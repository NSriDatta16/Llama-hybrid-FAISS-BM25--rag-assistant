Hidden City Entertainment was a game publisher founded in 2004 (as Hidden City Games, Inc.)  by Jesper Myrfors and Paul Peterson to develop and market the chip-throwing game, "Clout Fantasy." After Clout was developed the company recruited Peter Adkison as CEO.

In June 2006, Hidden City Games signed a five-year agreement with Danish game publisher Conceptcard to market the card game Bella Sara outside Conceptcard's Scandinavian market. In November 2006, Hidden City Entertainment secured $15 million in venture funding from Rustic Canyon Partners and Trinity Ventures, intended to significantly grow the online portion of the business.

In April 2007, Hidden City discontinued development of Clout Fantasy to focus on marketing Bella Sara. In June 2011, after its five-year contract to market Bella Sara ended, Hidden City games shut down.
