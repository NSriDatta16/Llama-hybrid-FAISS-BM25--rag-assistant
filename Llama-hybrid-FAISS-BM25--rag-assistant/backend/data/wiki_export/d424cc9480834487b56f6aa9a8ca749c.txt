The Indian flying barb (Esomus danrica), historically flying barb,  is one of the species known in the group flying barbs owing to their extremely long barbels. It was discovered as long ago as 1822 by Hamilton. However, it is rarely seen in aquaria. It is found in Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and India, it is found in many of the same localities as Danio rerio and Danio dangila, an example being the Jorai Rivulet, a tributary of the Sankosh river in Coochbehar district, West Bengal, India. The rare fish Borellius spp. is locally named "Boirali maach".

Description 
This fish reaches a maximum length of 6 in (15Â cm). The Indian flying barb is a silver fish with a black line on an elongated body and gold fins. Barbels reach almost to the anal fin.

Behaviour 
This fish has an exceptional ability for jumping, hence its name.

Research in 2001 by Fang Fang suggests that Esomus is the genus most closely related to Danio, closer even than Devario.
