Peck is also known for its many traditions. It has an annual field day called Downy-Redhead Day, which has relay races and an all-school tug-of-war. Downy-Redhead day is the final date of friendly competition between the Downy team and the Redhead team, named for woodpeckers native to the area. Students earn points for their team by earning "Job Well Done Tickets," which are acquired through acts of kindness, and active displays of the school's core values. Peck has a talent show, where students can showcase their talents to the school body. There is a Christmas Sing. There is also a Spring Sing. Lower schoolers participate in a science fair, which is known as the Science Expo, and they submit their work to the Lower School literary Arts magazine (Spectrum). Commencement is held every year for graduating eighth graders, as students move on to secondary school.

History

The Peck School originally started in 1893 on Franklin Street, founded as Miss Sutphen's School for Young Ladies, with six initial students. Lorraine T. Peck purchased the school late in 1917. In 1920, the school moved to Elm Street, and then into its current location on South Street, in the Lindenwold Mansion and the surrounding acres.

In 1993, The Peck School completed the Deetjen Kindergarten Building. In 1995, the Caspersen-Tomlinson Academic Building was completed, followed by the F. M. Kirby Lower School in 1998. In 2006, the  Eckhert Huff Building was completed, which was followed by the Athletic Center in 2007. The Peck Commons was completed in 2019 after the old gym in front of Lindenwold mansion was demolished to create a new quad for students. 

Notable headmasters include Mr. Lorraine T. Peck (1917–1944), Mr. Philip S. Hesseltine (1946–1954), Mr. Rudy Deetjen (1977–1994), and Mr. John J. Kowalik (2003-2013).
