Babbs Mill Lake, sometimes called Kingshurst Lake, is a man-made lake in the Kingfisher Country Park in Kingshurst, Solihull in England. The lake was created as a balancing feature in times of flooding from the nearby River Cole.

History
The lake gives its name to Babbs Mill Park, created to commemorate the Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II in 1977. It was designated a Local Nature Reserve in 2002.

In March 2016, Solihull Council's planning committee approved a scheme to build 52 houses on land amounting to approximately seven per cent of the reserve.

Since August 2019, Babbs Mill Lake has hosted a parkrun, a free, weekly timed 5Â km run/walk, every Saturday morning at 9am.

On 11 December 2022, four children fell through ice formed on the surface. On 12 December it was confirmed that three of the children had died, with the fourth child remaining in hospital in critical condition. It was announced on 14 December that the fourth child had died in hospital. An inquest hearing held on the 19 December found that all four deaths were due to drowning; a full inquest is due to take place on 6 July 2023.
