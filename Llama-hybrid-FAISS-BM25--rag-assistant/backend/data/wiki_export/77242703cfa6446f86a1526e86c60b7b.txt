Mile Square Regional Park is an urban park in Fountain Valley, California, United States.

Background
In 1942, the Navy purchased  of agricultural land for Mile Square Naval Outer Landing Field, which used as an auxiliary for Naval Air Station, Los Alamitos. Three landing fields were constructed in a triangular shape in the center of this area, with each field being approximately  in length. It was used for carrier deck qualification practice by Navy aircraft. In March 1967, Orange County entered into a long-term lease with the Navy Department for the perimeter area of the site which allowed the county to develop this area for regional park purposes. Military operations in the center airfield ceased in 1974. It is now operated by OC Parks. 

The park was built in several phases:
Phase I was opened with  of land in 1970
Phase II added the baseball diamond and a children's play area in 1973
Phase III extended the park northward to Edinger Avenue in 1976
Phase IV development commenced in the spring of 1987 and included the construction of an executive golf course.

Del Taco, a fast food chain based in Orange County, filmed a commercial on the south end of the park in early 2007, celebrating its 76th anniversary.
