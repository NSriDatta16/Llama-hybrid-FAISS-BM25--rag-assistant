Unorthodox Behaviour is the first album by British jazz fusion group Brand X. It peaked at 191 on the Billboard 200 in 1976, the same year it was released.

The album combines jazz fusion with progressive rock. It shows extensive use of improvisation in the extended pieces, which is common in both genres of music.

Reception

In a review for AllMusic, Dave Connolly wrote: "Unorthodox Behaviour samples a variety of styles: from melodic to energetic, ethereal to mathematical. Without a standout soloist..., Brand X does run the risk of sounding like a generic fusion jazz outfit, but their compositional skills pick up the slack nicely. Those interested in the band may do well to start with this album."

Markus Scharpey of Genesis News stated: "this is a well-done instrumental debut album. You feel that the musicians are very much in tune with each other. It seems that all tracks were developed from jam sessions and structured later... Phil Collins is on top of his drumming game."
