Auckland International College was an independent coeducational secondary school in Auckland, New Zealand. AIC was established by a Japanese educational for-profit corporation, Oshu Corporation. It adopted the IB Diploma Programme as its sole curriculum plus a preparation year programme for the course (year 11). The school ran with a Northern Hemisphere timetable. AIC also offered a six-month course running from January to June for international students whose English is not at a high enough level to embark on the year 11 preparation year programme. The AIC English course for senior secondary studies covered all curriculum subjects, developing and improving English language skills required for further study in a New Zealand classroom. The Japanese for-profit corporation, Oshu Corporation, that owned the school permanently closed the school in 2023 due to difficulty attracting international students.
