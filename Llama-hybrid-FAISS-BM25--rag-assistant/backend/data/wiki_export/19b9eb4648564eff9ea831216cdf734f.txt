The decision to build the stadium came in 1989. The December of the same year it started to be built. After many wages offered from Salamis fans in Cyprus and abroad, from Cyprus Sports Association and from many workers it was built in a short time.

The stadium hosted the 1992 UEFA European Under-16 Football Championship final on 17 May 1992 between Germany and Spain where Germany won 2–1.

In 1998, the stadium underwent some renovations.
