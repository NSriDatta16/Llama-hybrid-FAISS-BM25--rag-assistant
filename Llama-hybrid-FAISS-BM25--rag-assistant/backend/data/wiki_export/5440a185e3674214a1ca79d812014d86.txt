Toponymy

Origin of the name and various appellations
Piana degli Albanesi has been variously called in history. In the licentia populandi granted on January 13, 1487 to the Albanian exiles, Piana degli Albanesi is called Casale Planicili Archiepiscopatus Montisregalis or Piana dell'Arcivescovo, but since its construction the town was officially known in Latin Nobilis Planae Albanensium Civitas. This Latin denomination changed into Nobilis Planae Graecorum Albanensium Civitas, with the insertion of Graecorum which indicated the Byzantine Rite practice of the Albanian population (as opposed to the Latin liturgical rites of Latin Christianity). In the centuries, in the cadastral and habitual use of the neighboring Sicilian populations, the Italian name of Piana dei Greci remained from 1810, because the Byzantine Rite Catholics and the ancient Greek language used in the liturgical functions.

It was also known and called by the populations of the nearby villages Casale di lu Mercu territorii Montisregalis, Graecorum Oppidum, Badia (transl. Abbey, which indicates the strong religious and monastic communities and in a figurative sense it symbolizes abundance and well-being, because the local church had always been the reference point for the Albanians), La Chiana or Piana delli Greci. Its inhabitants and the Albanians of the other colonies of Sicily, instead, identified it as Sheshi (square, center in Albanian), Kazallot (for a kind of synecdoche: Kazallot, local toponym, equivalent to Hora). After decades of discussion by local Italo-Albanian religious-intellectuals, due to the fact that the Albanian origin was not highlighted in it, following a royal decree and the desire to change the more exact denomination, on 30 August 1941 the Italian name 'Piana dei Greci' was changed to the more historically and ethnographically correct Piana degli Albanesi. A few months later, by decree of the Sacred Dicastery for the Eastern Churches of October 25, 1941, even the name of Planen Graecorum was changed ecclesiastically to Planen Albanensium.

The inhabitants call the town in their Albanian dialect Hora e Arbëreshëvet, literally translatable into the "City of the Albanians". For this reason it is usually said simply from the Arbëreshë people Hora, an Albanian word meaning 'homeland' or 'capital', deriving probably from the Greek homophone Chòra, χώρα, a typical word of Tosk and Arvanite Albanians of Greece., and that has the meaning city in Albanian and stands for the literal Albanian qytet, indicating that it is the main one among the Albanian of Sicily communities. 
Some elders also say Hora e t'Arbëreshëvet, the difference being the addition of të, a plural clitic marker, with the elision of -ë with A- in Arbëreshëvet. Some inhabitants also figuratively say they are Bar i Sheshit (Sheshi grass; born in Sheshi, the center) and call themselves singular arbëresh-i/e, plural arbëreshët.

History
Piana degli Albanesi was founded in the late 15th century by a large group of Albanian refugees coming from the Balkans during the conquest of the latter by the Ottoman Empire. The exodus began after the death of Skanderbeg, who successfully fought Ottoman armies for more than two decades.

The village foundation was officially sanctioned on August 30, 1488, based on an official request sent in 1486–1487 to Cardinal Juan de Borja, archbishop of the Archdiocese of Monreale, demanding the right to remain in the lands of Mercu and Aydingli, located in the mountains in the province of Palermo.

In 1482–85, after several attacks from the Ottomans, the Christian Albanians were forced to the Adriatic coast where they hired ships from Republic of Venice, escaped by sailing and managed to reach the island of Sicily. They apparently were housed in temporary camps somewhere near Palermo until about 1486 or 1487, when they were granted land known initially as the "Plain of the Archbishop", inland areas of Sicily in the mountains above the city of Palermo. Signed the "capitulation" in Albanian and Italian, which were also recognized with followed by the Brief of Pope Sixtus IV, the official concession of land was granted to the settlers in 1488, followed by the construction of what became the largest Albanian center of the island and primarily, religious buildings.

King John II of Spain and Sicily allowed the original refugees to occupy the present place and to preserve their Orthodox Christian rite. These Albanian refugees were at the time referred to by the surrounding population as "Greeks" on account of their Orthodox faith and the settlement became known as Piana dei Greci. For example, in 1673, the local priest Domenico Mamola in a note written in Greek refers to the settlement as Piana dei Greci. In 1941 during Mussolini's invasion of Greece, the name was changed to Piana degli Albanesi so as to gain the locals support for the fascist regime's imperialist intentions toward Albania. The name Piana degli Albanesi or Plain of the Albanians is a literal translation of the local Arbëreshë name: Hora e Arbëreshëvet.

During the 19th century, the Arbëreshë of Piana degli Albanesi played a significant role for the Italian national unity, and participated in the stronger phases of the movement of Fasci Siciliani. The inhabitants of Piana degli Albanesi were known to have a reputation for rebelliousness, but were not organized politically until the arrival of the Fascio in April 1893.

In 1947, the regional Mafia hired the bandit Salvatore Giuliano to shoot down the annual May Day demonstration of the Pianesi, which took place in a remote mountain pass. The bandit and his gang indeed attacked them there, killing fourteen people in what came to be known as the Portella della Ginestra massacre.

Symbols

The coat of arms of the municipality of Piana degli Albanesi is thus described by the municipal statute: 

The gonfalon of the municipality of Piana degli Albanesi is a rectangular drape with a blue background or red with a round in the center adorned with gold embroidery reproducing the Latin inscription Nobilis Planæ Albanensium Civitas and bearing the emblem. The banner is governed by the statutory provisions of the municipality.

Originally the coat of arms consisted of two ears joined by a knot ribbon with an eight-pointed star in the upper part and with the acronym S.P.Q.A. (Senatus Populus Que Albanensis), or N.P.A.C. (Nobilis Planæ Albanensium Civitas). This coat of arms, which symbolizes the agricultural work of the Albanians, can be seen in local stone in the oldest fountains, such as that of the "Fusha and Pontit" (1765), and on the side door of the Church of St. George, the ancient Matrix. Later the Albanian double eagle was always used, with the ears between the claws and the inscription N.P.A.C. In the former Town Hall in Piazza Vitt. Emanuele, now the seat of the Municipal Library "G. Schirò", has a stone coat of arms with the figure of Gjergj Kastrioti Skënderbeu in the center. According to the Statute of the municipality of Piana degli Albanesi, the municipality has its own anthem in Albanian.

Geography

Location

Piana degli Albanesi is  above sea level in a mountainous valley, located in the hinterland of Palermo. The municipal territory, bordered mostly by natural borders and extended in a south-east direction, has an extension of approximately 64.92 km² and is inserted in the "Serre della Pizzuta oriented natural reserve" and in the "Piana degli Albanesi lake" .

It is a mountain resort, whose natural environment and typical mild mediterranean climate create a peaceful and serene oasis. Its natural frame consists of a lake, the mountains and the typical rural quarters.

It is surrounded by four mountains (Pizzuta, Kumeta, Maganoce, Xeravulli), natural sites (Neviere, Cave Garrone, Honi), and the nature reserve Serre della Pizzuta. There are a number of recreational activities available in the area, such as hiking, cycling, horse riding, canoeing, and paragliding.

The territory is crossed by several streams. To the south-east, immersed in the greenness, there is the artificial lake formed in 1923 by damming the Belice Destro river (Lumi Honi), barred in the 1920s to allow for the construction of the Lake of Piana degli Albanesi, since 1999 a natural oasis protected and safeguarded by the World Wildlife Foundation.

Topography
The original inhabited area initially developed on the rocky Mount Pizzuta (mali Picuta), although, a cause of the rigid temperature, the Albanian exiles moved a little further downstream, in the area of the plain below, on the slopes of the Sheshi mound.

Due to its ethnic, cultural, religious, historical and environmental peculiarities it is part of the varied Sicilian landscape as a unique unrepeatable.

Climate
Piana degli Albanesi is located in a plateau surrounded by high mountains and is subject to a particular microclimate. Summers are on average warm and sunny, but more windy than in the rest of the island thanks to the mountain breezes. Winters are generally cold but quite variable depending on the year, with rigid snow periods. Unlike the surrounding areas, humidity is high and rainfall is more abundant.

Demography

Historiographical research has not yet succeeded in specifying the number of Albanian refugees reaching the end of the fifteenth century. The building of the farmhouse was therefore relatively rapid, so much so that this first group was joined, between 1532 and 1534, by other Albanian refugees from Corone and Modone. The demographic and economic growth was constant, due also to the constant arrival of new nuclei of Albanian exiles who settled in the town.

The 1624 epidemic that struck Sicily and the continuing famines raged over demographic development. One of the most critical moments came towards the end of the seventeenth century, when a large group of arbëreshë decided to move with their families to the nearby fiefdom of Santa Cristina, owned by the Archbishopric of Palermo, to build a new farmhouse. The displacement involved more than a hundred Albanians, whose names are indicated in the chapters approved in 1691.

From the eighteenth century to the unification of Italy, a positive demographic increase is evident, up to the peak of the population in the first half of the 20th century, although affected by the emigration phenomenon towards the Americas (United States, Canada, Brazil, Cile, Uruguay and Argentina), European states (Germany) or north Italy. Since the second half of the 20th century the population has remained fairly stable.

Ethnic groups

The ethnic composition of Piana degli Albanesi, whose population is and still feels Albanian, is significantly different from that of the surrounding Sicilian environment. The community is configured as a historically consolidated system with an independent profile in the territory. The different origins, with the strong historical, cultural and value connotations, constitute specific points of the community, on the other hand perfectly integrated.

The Arbëreshe identity, tempered in a foreign land (te dheu i huaj), seals its strong indigenous character. The cornerstones of the community are: the Albanian language, the Byzantine rite, traditional customs and customs, history. The social component was the endogenous force of Piana degli Albanesi: the intelligentsia Arbëreshe, the priests in the first place and exponents of political and cultural life, through institutions and the work of many illustrious men, worked with zeal to defend the peculiarities identity. The maintenance of the Albanian status, as in every identity reality, is confronted daily with the socio-cultural transformism and if once ignoring each other between Albanians and Sicilians was the way to preserve each one's own specificities, the current territorial dynamics not they allow it to the extent that the world-system is expressed through relations from the local to the supra-local.

Identity aspects, such as ritual, language and customs, are still kept alive by the whole community, thanks to a strong and deep-rooted popular tradition in which this people is linked and is recognized, and religious and cultural institutions also contribute validly to the safeguard and to the enhancement of ancestral heritage.

A flourishing Albanian community of Albania of very recent immigration, post-fall of the communist regime of 1990, coexists and is well integrated in the social of Piana degli Albanesi, with the creation of a community of arbëreshë which gathers within it a rooted core of shqiptarë. There is no lack of marriages between Italo-Albanians and Albanians from the Balkans.

Between 1997 and 2002 the municipality and the Eparchy of Piana degli Albanesi welcomed and helped the Albanians from Kosovo affected by the war.

Cityscape

The historic center of the town has a late-medieval style, reflecting the social status and economic conditions of the time when the settlement was built. The city streets are narrow and consist of steps (shkallët) and neighbourhoods (gjitonia), the roads are generally narrow and provide a meeting place in front of the houses, with the exception of the main road (dhromi i madhë) which is wide and straight and divides the town into different sections. There is also a Piazza Grande (Qaca e Madhe) which is the centre of community relationships.

The churches of the town are among the most important architectural structures, the testimony of these two styles, the baroque linked to the Byzantine Empire and Italian. Of particular interest are the works of the architect and painter Pietro Novelli, very active in the Albanian community.

Religious architecture
 

The most notable churches in Piana degli Albanesi are:
 The Cathedral of Shën Mitri Dëshmor i Math (St. Demetrius Megalomartyr), which serves as the principal church of the Eparchy of Piana degli Albanesi, the church dates to 1498/1590. The Cathedral is a building dating from the late fifteenth-century, that preserves some significant frescoes by Pietro Novelli. The most ancient work is the icon of the God Mother with the Christ (1500). The presence of two cultures (Byzantine-baroque) is so evident in the place.
Church of Shën Mëria e Dhitrjës (St. Mary Odigitria), located in the village main square, was built in 1644 in the style of Pietro Novelli. The church, the only architectural work by Novelli, has the nave divided from the two aisles by four pillars to support the octagonal dome with a small lantern. It preserves a Virgin Odigitria icon that is said to have been brought here by the refugees during their voyage from Albania.
 Church of Shën Gjergji Dëshmor i Math''' (St. George), built in 1492, is the most ancient in the town. It preserves some remarkable frescoes.

Evidence of ancient and modern cultural richness of the area, currently subject to archaeological research center.

Religion

 Easter 
The town preserves unique Easter traditions, held every year according to a typical itinerary: first of all is the Divine Liturgy, where the Gospel is read in seven languages, including Arabic. After the religious ceremony, there is a procession through the main street, all the women and several men dress in traditional Arbëresh costume, the procession leads to the square after the blessing the red eggs are distributed as a sign of Christ's resurrection.

 Culture 
 Traditional costume 

The traditional female costume of Piana degli Albanesi, along with language and the Byzantine rite, is one of the most obvious signs of Arbëreshe cultural identity, and is a unique expression of local self-consciousness, which manifests itself in the desire to retain identity and traditions. From the historical point of view Piana degli Albanesi is one of the most notable Arbëresh communities in Arbëria and Sicily.  There are several artistic works on the clothes of Albanians of Piana degli Albanesi, including very valuable Vuillier prints of the eighteenth century, and paintings by Ettore De Maria Bergler, partly preserved at the Art Gallery of the monumental complex of Sant'Anna in Palermo and other private prints, postcards and watercolors by unknown authors. Both the former, together with numerous additional representations portray and demonstrate the incomparability of the costume of Piana degli Albanesi.

The clothes, linked to the various moments of women's lives, from everyday life to marriage, punctuated the rhythms of social tradition of the past. Handed down from mother to daughter, and zealously preserved, they are no longer clothes, but costumes. The progressive loss of this link began in the 1940s, when after the war in Europe there was a need for more practical clothing.
 
The opulent and elegant clothes have preserved intact their special character, and are worn on special occasions such as baptisms, Epiphany, Easter and especially marriage, continuing to be carefully preserved by the women of Piana degli Albanesi. It costs thousands of euros to make and repair these costumes, and the majority of women use them on these occasions. An epitome of beauty is the bridal costume, which makes it particularly valuable and the religious event of the Byzantine rite. The quality of production is due to the great craftsmanship of the Arbëresh embroiderers in gold and silk wheelwork, velvet and gold (in leads, and lenticciole canatiglie).  Embroidery is done using a pillow, a frame or a needle alone.

The traditional female costume of Piana degli Albanesi has been admired through time and consensus. In the competition held in Venice in 1928, in which costume groups from every region of Italy took part, the group from Piana degli Albanesi was awarded first prize, a recognition of their traditional dress as the most sumptuous, rich in design, fabrics and colors out of all the regional competitors.

It is spoken by all, and can be seen in street names, road signs, and shop signs in the village. The Arbëreshë community has preserved its identity as much as possible. The language shares the widespread language variations seen in southern Albania, mixed at times with Greek phonetics.
