Caraz is a town in the Caraz District in the southeastern part of Huaylas Province of the Ancash Region in Peru.

Political Creation

Recent investigations suggest that its political creation happened on 12 February 1821 when General San Martín, while staying in Huaura (village north of Lima), founded four departments including Huaylas, which had Caraz as its capital. In 1857 it was split in two, giving birth to the new province of Huaraz. The District of Caraz was created by the Administration of Liberation of Don Simón Bolivar, legitimized by law on December 29, 1857, and sanctioned a year later. The city of Caraz became the capital of the Province of Huaylas on July 25, 1857.

Etymology
The origin of the name Caraz is uncertain.
One possibility is that it derives from the quechua word QARA-PUNKu, meaning "leather door", as the doors in Caraz were once covered with leather.
Don Celso V. Torres maintains that the name comes from the quechua word KALLASH meaning sterile and without vegetation. 
Another possibility is that it comes from the quechua word QARAS, referring to the magüey plants found in the area.

Geography
The town is located at an elevation of about 2250 m in the Cordillera Blanca mountain range. It keeps the traditional architecture and life style of an Andean village, as the remaining cities in the valley were destroyed after the 1970 Ancash earthquake.
