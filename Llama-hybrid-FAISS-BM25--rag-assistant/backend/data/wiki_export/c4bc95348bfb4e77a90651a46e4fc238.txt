"This Time I Know It's for Real" is a song by American singer-songwriter Donna Summer, released on February 13, 1989, as the first single from her 14th studio album, Another Place and Time (1989), by Atlantic Records and Warner Bros. Records. Like the rest of the album, the song was written and produced by the British Stock Aitken Waterman (SAW) team, though Summer also had a hand in writing this song.

The song became Summer's biggest hit in the United Kingdom since 1979, reaching number three and spending a total of 14 weeks in the UK Singles Chart top 75. It reached number seven in both the United States and Canada, becoming Summer's 14th and final top-10 hit on the US Billboard Hot 100 as well as the last top-40 hit of her career. The song was also successful on the Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary chart, peaking at number two.

Background
Summer became aware of SAW after her husband, Bruce Sudano, drew her attention to their work during a visit to Europe. She was further encouraged by Rick Astley's subsequent success, saying she "loved his production". Hitting it off with the producers immediately, Summer recalled that the song came together on their first day working together, a rare case of "hitting the nail on the head the first time". While she was enthusiastic, her then US label boss David Geffen wanted a rockier sound with more guitars from the SAW sessions, a dictate which was immediately refused by Pete Waterman.

With Geffen Records ending her US deal due to an impasse over the new material, this was Summer's first US single to be released on Atlantic Records. Since 1980 she had been signed to Geffen, but her work across Europe had always been distributed by Warner Bros.' main label. This would continue to be the case following her signing to Atlantic.

Critical reception
Alex Henderson from AllMusic described the song as a "exuberant, club-friendly Euro-dance/Hi-NRG" gem. Jim Arundel from Melody Maker declared it as "gloriously driven, simple, joyous and just a bit sad too." Pan-European magazine Music & Media commented, "Very much a SAW production with Summer's voice adding a touch of class. Her first chance of a major hit since 1983's 'She Works Hard for the Money'." Jerry Smith of Music Week described the song as an "irritatingly catchy, lightly soulful dance tune that is sure of a high chart placing". In its 2016 retrospective review, Pop Rescue also stated that the song "simply oozes S/A/W sound from the very first moment it bursts open with some very Rick Astley/Sonia-esque drums. This is textbook S/A/W and is absolutely flawless." In 2021, British magazine Classic Pop ranked the song number nine in their list of 'Top 40 Stock Aitken Waterman songs', underlining its success on the charts.

Chart performance
"This Time I Know It's for Real" reached the top-ten in the majority of the countries in which it was released. In the US, it charted for 17 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 with a peak at number seven in its tenth week on the chart on June 24, 1989, thus becoming Summer's 14th and last top ten hit in the country, six years after the top three hit "She Works Hard for the Money". It also reached number two on the Billboard Adult Contemporary, number five on the Dance Club Songs, and number one on the Dance Singles Sales chart. In the UK, "This Time I Know It's for Real" charted for 14 weeks and hit number three in its fifth week, on 19 March 1989, thus marking Summer's return in the top ten after ten years of absence, her previous top ten hit being "No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)", released in 1979. In Continental Europe, "This Time I Know It's for Real" achieved its highest position in the Flanders part of Belgium where it reached number two, being blocked from the number one slot by Madonna's "Like a Prayer" which topped the chart then, and featured on the chart for 12 weeks. In France, after a debut at number 43, it reached number six twice and remained in the top 50 for a total of 18 weeks, becoming Summer's highest peak position in the country. It was also a top-three hit in Finland and Norway, attained number four in Ireland, number five in the Netherlands, number six in Denmark and number seven in Canada. In addition, it peaked within the top-20 in Sweden, West Germany, Spain and Italy, and barely made top-40 in Australia where it charted for ten weeks. On the Music & Medias European Hot 100 Singles chart, "This Time I Know It's for Real" spent 26 weeks with two weeks at a peak of number seven, and being much aired on radios, had a 17-week chart run on the European Airplay Top 50 where it reached number eight.
