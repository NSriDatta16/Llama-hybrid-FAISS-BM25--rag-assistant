Spare Snare is a lo-fi band from Dundee, Scotland, who were voted as the 46th best Scottish band of all time.

Founded in the early 1990s, the band have released 12 albums and 2 compilations to date, released on their own Chute Records, or licensed to another label. They have also recorded four John Peel Sessions. In the 1995 John Peel Festive 50, the band were number 32 with "Bugs". 

Spare Snare have been cited as an influence on acts such as Snow Patrol and the Fence Collective. 

Along with Mogwai, The Delgados, Bis, Arab Strap, Urusei Yatsura, Ganger and Long Fin Killie, Spare Snare were part of the mid 1990s 'New Scottish Underground' scene.

In 2008 they had the bizarre privilege to cover Amazing Grace for BBC Radio Two’s Aled Jones Sunday show.  Spare Snare are the only band to have recorded sessions for both John Peel and Aled Jones.

Spare Snare released their 8th studio album, Victor, in June 2010, which was voted the 19th Best Scottish Album of 2010.
