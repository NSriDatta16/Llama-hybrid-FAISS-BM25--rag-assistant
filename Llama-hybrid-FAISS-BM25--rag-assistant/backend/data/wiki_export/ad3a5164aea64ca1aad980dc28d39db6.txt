The hardtop design eliminated the traditional B-pillar found on most cars of the era. Powered by a Cadillac V8 engine with an output of , the Orleans was never put into production. The design innovations on this car would not be put into a production car until the 1956 Sedan de Ville. The car also featured suicide doors, a wrap around windshield, full air conditioning, and several safety improvement attempts, such as a feature which resulted in the doors only being able to be opened if the car was in neutral. Another unique luxury feature was the addition of an AC/DC converter and a normal household outlet to allow electronic devices to be plugged into the car. A compartment in the backrest held a men's electric razor, a vanity case, and a mirror.
