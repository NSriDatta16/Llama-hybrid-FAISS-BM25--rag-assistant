Biography
He was the eldest son of the 6th Baronet and 1st Earl of Stradbroke. He joined the Army at the age of 16, being gazetted as an ensign in the Coldstream Regiment of Foot Guards on 30 June 1810.

Rous returned to the family estate, Henham Park, for 12 months leave, but was ordered to rejoin his regiment in Brussels following Napoleon's escape from Elba in March 1815. While serving in Wellington's campaign in Belgium, Rous was wounded at Quatre Bras and so did not take part in Napoleon's defeat two days later at Waterloo.

On 6 November 1817 he transferred to the 93rd Regiment of Foot with the rank of captain. Rous retired from the Army in 1821.
