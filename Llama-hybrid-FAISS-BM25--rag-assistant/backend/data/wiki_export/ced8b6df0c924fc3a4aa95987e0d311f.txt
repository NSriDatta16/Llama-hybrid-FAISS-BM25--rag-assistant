Spring brings a lot of rain and makes Waterman covered in wildflowers. Summers are hot and dry. The climate here is Highlands/Mediterranean. Partly due to this climate, mixed conifer forests are found on Waterman Mountain, Fauna is greatly influenced because of this climate.

Recreation

The Buckhorn and Cooper Campgrounds are below the peak on the Angeles Crest Highway.

History
Robert B. Waterman was a pioneer mountain man and a ranger in the San Gabriel Forest Reserve. He, with his wife Liz and their friend Perry Switzer, completed a three-week journey from La Ca√±ada to the Antelope Valley and back in May 1889. With this accomplishment, Liz became the first non-indigenous woman known to have crossed the San Gabriel Mountains. It is said that she placed a cairn on this summit and so it was named Lady Waterman's Peak. However, with prevailing attitudes toward the "weaker sex" the name was not accepted and it became known as simply Waterman Mountain.

The area was severely impacted by the Station fire in 2009.
