Denis "Piggy" D'Amour (September 24, 1959 – August 26, 2005) was a Canadian guitarist. He was a member of the heavy metal band Voivod from its inception in 1982 until his death in 2005.

D'Amour's approach to music was anarchic and experimental rather than strict and theoretical. He was trained in classical violin as a child. He was influenced by progressive rock artists such as King Crimson, Pink Floyd and Rush.

Death 
In the summer of 2005, D'Amour was diagnosed with colon cancer. Subsequently, a routine operation was scheduled though several complications led doctors to suspect further problems. The cancer had extensively progressed, rendering any operation non-viable.

D'Amour slipped into a coma in the palliative care unit of a Montreal hospital on August 25, 2005, surrounded in his final hours by family and friends. The guitarist died the next day at approximately 11:45pm.

The documentary Metal: A Headbanger's Journey, featuring an interview with D'Amour, was released on September 7, 2005.

Piggy's final recordings appear on two of Voivod's albums Katorz and Infini, released in 2006 and 2009 respectively.
