In Sikhism, the Five Thieves (, pronunciation: ), also called the five evils or the five vices (Punjabi: ਪੰਜ ਬੁਰਾਈਆਂ paja burā'ī'āṁ), are the five major weaknesses of the human personality at variance with its spiritual essence, and are known as "thieves" because they steal a person's inherent common sense. These five thieves are kaam (lust), krodh (wrath), lobh (greed), moh (attachment) and ahankar (ego or excessive pride).
