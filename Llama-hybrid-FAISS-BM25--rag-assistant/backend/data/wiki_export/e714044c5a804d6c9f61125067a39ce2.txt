Club career

Early career and Norway
Hyka joined local side Dinamo Tirana at the age of 12, where he played for the youth teams for four years, until he made it to the first team at 2004. He was being tracked by a number of European clubs despite never having made a competitive appearance for Dinamo Tirana before joining Norwegian side Rosenborg BK in 2005 on loan. At Rosenborg, Hyka did not manage to break through into the first team, failing to make a single league appearance, only featuring twice as an unused substitute in August and September 2006.

Greece and return to Albania
In 2007, Hyka left Dinamo Tirana to sign with Greek club Olympiacos for a fee of €600,000. At Olympiakos, he found opportunities in the first team limited and so he moved on loan to KF Tirana, the then champions of the 2006–07 Albanian Superliga in time for the 2007–08 season.

Back in Tirana, Hyka played 32 games, scoring two goals and his good form did not go unnoticed. Croatian side Dinamo Zagreb showed interest and Hyka was close to a move.

Mainz
In June 2008, Hyka signed a three-year deal with German side 1. FSV Mainz 05.

Panionios
In 2010, after just 13 appearances with the German team, most of them as a substitute, Hyka was once again on the move, this time back to Greece, transferring to Greek team, Panionios, for a €120,000 fee.

Return to Tirana
After a difficult time in Greece, Hyka returned to Albania, re-signing with former side Tirana where he had previously had a loan spell. The deal was completed on 29 January 2011, while he was still in Greece. Tirana president Refik Halili had previously expressed his desire to sign the young national team winger at the unveiling of new signing Bekim Balaj.

Hyka made his return debut on 20 February 2011 in team's goalless draw against Shkumbini Peqin at home. One month later, in a match against the same opponent, he netted his first season goal via a free-kick from 25 metres, giving his team a minimal 1–0 win. He continued with his solid appearances by scoring twice in Tirana's 4–0 defeat of Laçi in April. Only four days later, he scored his fourth goal of the season in the 6–1 defeat of Elbasani at Selman Stërmasi Stadium. Tirana finished the season in the fifth position with 44 points, failing to secure a spot in European competitions, bringing the departure of Hyka.

Luzern

In the summer of 2011, Hyka was transferred to FC Luzern in the Swiss Super League. He scored his first goal with Luzern on 6 August 2011 in a 1–1 draw against Young Boys after coming on as a substitute in the 62nd minute to score in the 86th minute for the equaliser. Luzern fans named him "the Messi of Albania."

Hyka scored a goal from 20 meters in a 4–1 loss against St. Gallen on 1 September 2013. He scored a goal and provided several assist for Luzern in a 2–4 win against Terre Sainte in the Swiss Cup on 15 September 2013.

He first appeared for the club on 25 February 2017 in the last San Jose Earthquakes preseason friendly against Sacramento Republic, substituting on at halftime and scoring also a goal in the 79th minute. Hyka made his first MLS appearance as a 70th-minute substitute in the season home opener against Montreal Impact on 4 March 2017, finished in the 1–0 victory. His first score-sheet contributions came in his second ever appearance for the club on 11 March 2017, substituting on at halftime and recording two assists to help the Earthquakes make a 3–2 comeback victory over the Vancouver Whitecaps.

On 18 March 2017, Hyka made his first MLS start in a 2–1 loss at Sporting Kansas City. His first goal was scored on 14 April 2017 with ten seconds remaining in stoppage time in what would be a 1–1 home draw against FC Dallas. Hyka opened the scoring against the Portland Timbers in the 3–0 rout on 7 May in the 8th minute of the match. He assisted the first goal scored by San Jose Designated Player Vako on 20 July against the New York Red Bulls, which finished as a 5–1 loss.

International career
On 7 February 2007, Hyka made his debut for Albania in a friendly match against Macedonia. On 20 August 2008, he scored his first goal for Albania against Liechtenstein and his goal came just 46 seconds after the game had begun, making it the quickest goal in Albanian history.

Style of play
A quick, energetic, and agile player, Hyka is capable of playing either as left winger or attacking midfielder. Luzern fans have nicknamed him "the Albanian Messi" due to his short stature, dribbling, and speed. Dominic Kinnear, San Jose's coach at the time of Hyka's signing with the team, praised his skills, saying, "He's really smart on the ball and confident in tight places" and adding that "he has a good first touch." Both Earthquakes general manager Jesse Fioranelli and MLS senior analyst Matt Doyle have emphasized Hyka's unpredictability on the field.

Personal life
Hyka has four siblings, two sisters and two brothers who live in his hometown of Tirane. He practices the faith of Islam, praying five times daily and fasting during the holy month of Ramadan, which he has done so since the age of 12. He attends mosque when possible around his football schedule, and at his former club 1. FSV Mainz 05 he would attend with teammate Chadli Amri.

He is fluent in Albanian, German, and English.
