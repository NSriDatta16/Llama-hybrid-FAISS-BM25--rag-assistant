History
Stuart Country Day School of the Sacred Heart was founded in 1963 and named for Mother Janet Stuart by a group of women who wished to establish a Sacred Heart school for girls in Princeton, New Jersey. With the help of the Society of the Sacred Heart and local friends, a large tract of woodlands was purchased on The Great Road, and Professor Jean Labatut of Princeton University was appointed architect for the project.
