History

The Beginning
Smolyan has had various football clubs in different periods, the most notable of them being Rodopets (since 1957). FC Rodopa was formed by separating from the local sports association in 1985. However, prior to that Smolyan has football team representation in both B and V groups.

Member of the Bulgarian Elite
Rodopa qualified for the top division for the first time in their history by winning the B Group in the 2002–03 season.

In the first ever season in the Bulgarian elite for Rodopa, the team managed to finish in 10th place, which was a success for the club, since they avoided relegation, with that being the main goal. The team achieved 10 wins, 3 draws and 17 losses, which earned them 33 points. They also managed to beat Bulgarian powerhouse Levski Sofia at home, one of the best teams that season and in general.

In their second top-flight season, Rodopa achieved a 12th-place finish, being one point above relegated Vidima Rakovski.

In their third season in A Group, Rodopa Smolyan finished 12th, 2 points above relegated PFC Pirin Blagoevgrad, once more avoiding relegation.

In the 2006-07 season, Rodopa did not perform so well and was relegated to the B Group after finishing 15th, ending the club’s four-year stint in the A Group.

Rapid decline and return to amateur football
After the 2006–07 season, Rodopa played three seasons in the B Group. However, in 2010, the club was relegated from the second tier. The following season, Rodopa finished 15th in the V Group, dropping yet another level. In 2011, the club was dissolved due to growing financial problems. Rodopa was reformed the next year but dissolved once more in 2014. The club was reformed a second time in 2014, and began playing in the A RFG (fourth tier). 

Rodopa managed to return to the Bulgarian third league for the 2019–20 season. The team joined the Southeast Third League, based on the geographic location of their home town, Smolyan. Rodopa finished 12th in the third tier for the 2019–20 season.
