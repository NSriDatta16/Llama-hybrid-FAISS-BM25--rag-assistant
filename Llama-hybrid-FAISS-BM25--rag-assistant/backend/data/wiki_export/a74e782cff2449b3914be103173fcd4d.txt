Mateo de Toro Zambrano y Ureta, I Count of La Conquista (September 20, 1727 - February 26, 1811), was a prominent Spanish military and political figure of Criollo descent. He held the position of a knight in the Order of Santiago and was the lord of the Toro-Zambrano estate.  

Toro Zambrano earned great respect during the final years of colonial Chile, occupying significant roles in both the military and local administration. In 1810, following Francisco Antonio García Carrasco's resignation, he stepped into the role of interim president-governor and captain general of Chile. While in this capacity, he faced persistent pressure to establish a governing junta in the region, a stance he opposed. On September 18, 1810, he assumed the presidency of the First National Government Junta of Chile, becoming the initial leader of the autonomist movement that eventually led to Chile's independence.

Early life 

Born in Santiago, Toro Zambrano came from an aristocratic lineage, being the legitimate son of Carlos José de Toro-Zambrano y Escobar and Jerónima de Ureta y Prado. His parents were prominent individuals in Santiago, known for their social and economic status. Mateo's baptismal name was Matheo de Toro-Zambrano Ureta, sharing the name with an older brother who died before his first birthday.

Toro Zambrano was related to José Miguel Carrera's grandfather through his maternal lineage. His mother was the sister of Francisca de Ureta y Prado, who was the mother of Ignacio de la Carrera y Ureta. This connection tied him to the lineage of Ignacio de la Carrera y Cuevas, a celebrated Chilean national hero. Furthermore, his maternal grandmother's family, the Prado family, could trace their origins back to the Inca emperor Manco Cápac, establishing a direct descent from the Inca lineage.

Civic and military career 

Widely regarded by historians and scholars, Toro Zambrano is considered one of Chile's most esteemed historical figures. José Perfecto de Salas described him succinctly: "Don Mateo Toro, magistrate. Honor of the Creole spirit; few words; great judgment; significant wealth; a truly good man" (1762).

Toro Zambrano served in various civic and military capacities, including as a councilman of the Santiago council, water magistrate (1750), and ordinary mayor of the city (1761). He was appointed magistrate of Santiago, mayor of mines, and lieutenant of the captain general by Manuel de Amat y Juniet in 1761. He reclaimed these roles in 1768.

Toro Zambrano was known for his strict adherence to regulations and a strong sense of duty. When the council lacked funds for the construction of Mapocho River dikes, he personally financed the work. In 1769, during an uprising by the Pehuenche people in the Biobío region, he funded a cavalry company, named "Prince of Asturias," led by his own son José Gregorio. This company guarded the Piuquenes Pass in the Santiago foothills.

On July 16, 1810, following Governor Francisco García Carrasco's resignation, Toro Zambrano became interim governor of the Captaincy General of Chile. On September 18 of the same year, he was elected president of the First National Government Junta, marking the establishment of Chile's inaugural autonomous government.

His death in the subsequent year prevented Toro Zambrano from playing a more extensive role in Chile's journey to independence.

Noble titles 
Due to his honorable achievements, both from local governors and the Spanish Crown, Toro Zambrano pursued a Castilian title for himself and his descendants. His persistence and the commendations that reached the Spanish court led to success. On March 6, 1770, a royal decree granted him the title of Count of Conquista, alluding to the conquest of the Canary Islands, in which his ancestor Juan de Toro played a significant role. Additionally, he was exempted from the service of lances, a privilege granted to him and other aspiring Chilean nobles through a royal decree on May 25, 1779.

Family 
Toro Zambrano married María Nicolasa de Valdés y de la Carrera on May 3, 1751, in Santiago. They had ten children together. Their eldest son died, making the second son, José Gregorio, the heir to the title and family estate. José Gregorio studied Law in Spain and became a lieutenant colonel in the Spanish Army. While in Spain, he met Josefa Dumont de Holdre y Miquel, a woman associated with the Spanish court. They got married and had three children: Manuel María, José, and María Nicolasa Isidora de las Mercedes. They settled on the Compañía Estate in Graneros.

Due to the deaths of her brothers during the War of Independence, the daughter inherited the title and estate. As a result, the rightful heirs to the County of Conquest and the family estate's assets are the current descendants of the Correa de Saa and Toro-Zambrano family.
