Da Storm is the first studio album by American hip hop trio Originoo Gunn Clappaz. It was released on October 29, 1996, through Duck Down/Priority Records. Recording sessions took place at Chung King Studios, at D&D Studios, at Platinum Island Studios and at Unique Studios in New York, and at WPGC FM in Washington. Production was handled by Da Beatminerz, DJ Ogee, E-Swift, Shaleek and Steele. It features guest appearances from Bad Vybes, M.S., Sadat X, Sean Black and the Representativz. The album peaked at number 47 on the Billboard 200 and number 10 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums. Two singles were released from the album: "No Fear" and "Hurricane Starang".

O.G.C. members Starang Wondah, Top Dog and Louieville Sluggah gained fame as members of the hip hop collective Boot Camp Clik, first appearing with Heltah Skeltah as 'The Fab 5' in 1995. The two groups split up to release separate albums in 1996, with Da Storm being the last Boot Camp Clik release after Black Moon's Enta da Stage, Smif-N-Wessun's Dah Shinin' and Heltah Skeltah's Nocturnal. Of these four Boot Camp albums, Da Storm sold the least, reaching just over 200,000 copies in the United States.

Singles 
"No Fear" b/w "Da Storm" was released as the lead single from the album. It peaked at number 15 on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100, number 63 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and number 13 on the Hot Rap Songs. The music video for "No Fear" caused a small dispute between Starang Wondah and The Notorious B.I.G. as it contained a Biggie look-alike when Starang said the lines, "I scare, petty MCs who claim they got gats/frontin wit hoes in videos with pimp hats/but the fact, still remains/that you're just a stain on the bottom of my boots while I'm still Starang". Starang was attacked by Biggie's henchmen at D&D Studios, and later mentions the attack on Heltah Skeltah's 1998 track "I Ain't Havin' That". "No Fear" was also used by Beyoncé Knowles on her 2003 hit "Baby Boy".

"Hurricane Starang" b/w "Gunn Clapp" and "Danjer", released as the album's second single, has a split video made up for "Hurricane Starang" and "Danjer", titled "Hurricane Danjer".
