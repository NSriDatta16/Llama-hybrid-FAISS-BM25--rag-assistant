History

Ancient
Due to its convenient location at the mouth of the Fils into the Neckar, people have been living in the area since the earliest times, which is attested by finds from the Stone Age. Finds of weapons and grave goods from the Bronze Age give evidence of a settlement belonging to the Urnfield culture. Also from the Hallstatt period grave mounds indicate that there might have been a continuous Celtic settlement up to the Roman period. In classical antiquity the Romans and in the early Middle Ages the Alamanni settled in the area.

From the middle ages to the 19th century
In the High Middle Ages, Plochingen was situated in the territory of the Herzogtum Schwaben and formed part of the Neckargau. The place was first mentioned in 1146 as Blochingen in a document of the king Conrad III of Hohenstaufen. There were two castles in Plochingen, but nothing remains of them. From the 12th to the 14th century the seat of a noble family can be proven for Plochingen.  In 1331, the lord of the castle Johann von Plochingen sold some property in Plochingen to the hospital in Esslingen. The Württemberg part of Plochingen, originally with the bailiwick of Nellingen, was already subordinated to the office in Stuttgart at the beginning of the 15th century. Since the 12th century Plochingen had had a market for building materials, salt and agricultural goods, including in particular wine, grain, fishing and livestock. In 1536 Duke Ulrich von Württemberg pushed through the Reformation. In 1545 the first bridge over the Neckar was built, replacing a medieval footbridge. In addition, a bridge over the Fils was built, so that bridge tolls could be charged for it. After the Battle of Nördlingen lost for Württemberg, Plochingen's convenient location had a negative effect on the traffic situation during the Thirty Years' War, as imperial troops plundered the town as early as 1634 and many houses burned down. The population of about 1300 people before the war sank to about 500 inhabitants after the war. In 1698 Plochingen became a post station on the imperial postal line between Antwerp and Venice, operated by the House of Thurn- und Taxis. In 1778 the Hofwerkmeister Johann Christian Adam Etzel (1743-1801; uncle of Gottlieb Christian Eberhard von Etzel) built the covered wooden bridge with a self-supporting span of 70 metres without intermediate pillars across the Neckar, which then became famous in Europe, 1905 it was replaced by the extension of the railway station completely intact. In 1808, the municipality moved from the Amtsoberamt Stuttgart to the newly established Oberamt Esslingen in implementing the new administrative division of Württemberg in the Kingdom of Württemberg. In 1846, the construction of the Filstalbahn as far as Plochingen led to the connection to the emerging network of the Württembergische Staatsbahnen, only one year after a train had run for the first time in Württemberg on the line between Cannstatt and Untertürkheim. In 1888 the Schwäbische Albverein was founded in the Waldhorn Restaurant.

20th century
In 1905 the wooden bridge from 1778 was replaced by an iron bridge over the Neckar. On 1 June 1913 a tornado destroyed numerous buildings in Plochingen. During the district reform during NS period in Württemberg Plochingen came to the district of Esslingen in 1938. After the Second World War, the community fell into the American occupation zone and was located in the state Württemberg-Baden from 1945 to 1952. On April 13, 1948, the municipality of Plochingen was elevated to the status of a town, which became part of the new federal state of Baden-Württemberg in 1952. On 12 July 1968 the Neckarhafen Plochingen was inaugurated. Since the beginning of the S-Bahn operation in the Stuttgart area on October 1, 1978, the vehicles have been technically maintained and cleaned in the Bahnbetriebswerk Plochingen.

In 1998, Plochingen hosted the Landesgartenschau Baden-Württemberg.
