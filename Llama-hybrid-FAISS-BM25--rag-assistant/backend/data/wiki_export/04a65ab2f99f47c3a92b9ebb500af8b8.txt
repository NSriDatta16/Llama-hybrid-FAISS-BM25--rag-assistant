The Juno Awards of 1986, representing Canadian music industry achievements of the previous year, were awarded on 10 November 1986 in Toronto at a ceremony hosted by Howie Mandel at the Harbour Castle Hilton Hotel. CBC Television broadcast the ceremonies nationally.

Labour problems at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation overshadowed plans for the awards broadcast. NABET complained about CBC plans to hire two American technical workers to assist with a special effect during the broadcast. NABET was renegotiating a labour contract with CBC and felt that Canadians should have been hired instead.

Meanwhile, CBC workers with the CUPE stopped work on 7 November. This strike was temporary, but interrupted the work of some Juno stage hands who were members of that union. weekend. CUPE's workers returned to work on the day of the Junos broadcast, as this particular union action was not planned to continue past the weekend.

1600 public tickets were made available, but all were sold late September, approximately one month after the $170 CAD tickets were offered for sale.

Gordon Lightfoot entered Canadian Music Hall of Fame, and was introduced at the ceremonies by Bob Dylan who made a surprise appearance.
