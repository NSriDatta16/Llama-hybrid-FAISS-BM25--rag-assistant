History

Innisdale was founded in 1978. Between 1878 and 1945, the land was home to a farmstead. The maple trees that line the street that is attached to the school's parking lot were planted by the original owners of the farm and have not changed (except for some removals due to safety concerns) since the school was built. In honor of the original owners of the farm, the Kennedy family, the street beside which the trees run was named Kennedy Way in 2005.
