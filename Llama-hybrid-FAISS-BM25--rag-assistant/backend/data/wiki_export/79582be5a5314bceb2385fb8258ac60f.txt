In phonetics and phonology, nonexplosive stops are posited class of non-pulmonic ("non-obstruent") stop consonants that lack the pressure build-up and burst release associated with pulmonic stops, but also the laryngeal lowering of implosive stops. They are reported to occur in Ikwere, an Igboid (Nigerâ€“Congo) language of Nigeria.

Ikwere's two nonexplosive stops, transcribed as voiced  and pre-glottalized , are reflexes of labial-velars  and , respectively, in most other Igboid languages, and to implosives  and  in some varieties of Igbo. Ikwere's stops resemble both, in that they are velarized and have a non-pulmonic airstream mechanism.
