Westbeach is a British television series produced by Witzend Productions for the BBC in 1993.

The series was set in the fictional seaside town of Westbeach (filmed on location in Eastbourne) and dealt with two rival families, the Cromers and the Prestons, who controlled the local businesses. The Preston family owned an upmarket seafront hotel, while the Cromers ran an amusement arcade and a fish-and-chip shop. One series of ten episodes was produced.

The Times described the "dismal performance" of the BBC's three new flagships dramas which included Westbeach, the programme only achieved 6.27 million viewers and was ranked 69th.
