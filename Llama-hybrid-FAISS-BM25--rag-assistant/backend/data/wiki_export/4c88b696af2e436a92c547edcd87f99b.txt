Street Cinema is the first and only album by the American hip hop group Sporty Thievz.

Background
Street Cinema was released on August 18, 1998, through Ruffhouse Records and was co-produced by Ski and Sporty Thievz member King Kirk. The album was one of the final to be released through Ruffhouse, as the label was shut down less than a year later.

Chart-wise, the album did not make much of an impact, only making it to 66 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums and 16 on the Top Heatseekers.  The album's lead single, however, did. "No Pigeons" peaked at #12 on the Billboard Hot 100, giving the group their only top 40 hit during their brief existence, as well as #1 on the Hot Rap Singles. In addition to "No Pigeons", "Cheapskate" and its remix also became minor hits on the Billboard charts.

"No Pigeons" was certified gold by the RIAA on July 9, 1999, for sales of over 500,000 copies.

Reception

Allmusic gave the album a solid three out of a possible five stars, calling it "there's too much junk floating around the album to make the good stuff instantly recognizable. Still, that handful of good cuts makes the entire enterprise worth investigating once, even if you find that you won't return to this Street Cinema that often."
