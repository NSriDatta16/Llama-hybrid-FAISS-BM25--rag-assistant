History 
S Anselm's was founded in 1888 by William Storrs Fox. In the first years it was a boys' boarding preparatory school. Storrs Fox was a graduate of Cambridge and a naturalist. He quickly established the reputation of the school. He took as a motto for the school 'Esse quam videri' (to be, rather than to seem). Already after a year he constructed an aviary in the school garden. In 2023 it was announced that S.Anselm's will join the Birkdale family of schools.
