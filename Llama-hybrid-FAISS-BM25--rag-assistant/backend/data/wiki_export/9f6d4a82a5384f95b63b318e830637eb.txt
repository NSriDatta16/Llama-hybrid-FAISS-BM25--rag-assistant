History

WTSN first signed on in 1956. The call sign was chosen because the original owner was the Twin State Network, which owned radio stations in both New Hampshire and Vermont.

In August 2015 WTSN and its sister station WBYY announced plans to join with Aruba Capital Holdings's WXEX and Port Broadcasting's WNBP and WWSF to form Coastal Media Partners, with Port Broadcasting management assuming immediate oversight of WTSN and WBYY. The merger failed to close, and in April 2016 WTSN and WBYY were sold to Binnie Media for $2.1 million. The sale officially closed on September 29, 2016.

WTSN began a simulcast using an FM translator on 98.1Â MHz (W251CF) in November 2016.
