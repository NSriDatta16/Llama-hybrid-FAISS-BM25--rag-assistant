History 
The MacNeills originate from Scotland. The MacNeill name is linked to the Scottish clan of the same name and is associated with the Outer Hebrides island of Barra, and the Inner Hebrides islands of Colonsay and Gigha. Clan MacNeill has a long and distinguished history. Recent genealogy studies have shown that Clan MacNeill is of Norse-Gael descent, rather than Irish as was once believed.
