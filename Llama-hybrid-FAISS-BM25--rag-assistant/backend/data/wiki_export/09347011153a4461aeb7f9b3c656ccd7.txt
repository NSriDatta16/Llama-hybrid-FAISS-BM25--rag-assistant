Thurman Green (August 12, 1940 â€“ June 19, 1997) was an American jazz trombonist. He was a member of the Horace Tapscott Quintet and the Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra.

Green and Hamiet Bluiett were at the Navy School of Music together in 1962. More than thirty years later, Bluiett produced and performed on Green's only album as a leader, Dance of the Night Creatures on Mapleshade Records. They began recording in 1994, and Green died in 1997 at the age of 57. Mapleshade released the album in 1999.
