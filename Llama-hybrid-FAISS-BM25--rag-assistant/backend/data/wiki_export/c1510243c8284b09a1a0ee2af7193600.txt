Newsham is a village and civil parish in the Richmondshire district of North Yorkshire, England. The village is  north west of Richmond and  south west of Darlington.

History 
The settlement of Newsham predates the Domesday Book, although the name of the village derives from the Old English nēowan hūsum, which means New Houses. At the time of the Norman Conquest, Newsham belonged to Sprot and Ulfkil. After the Domesday Book assessment, the land was in the hands of Count Alan and later passed to Minotts (of Carlton Miniott) in 1285 and then being seized by the Markenfield family by 1497.

During the Stuart and Tudor periods, the village was regarded as quite important due to its market, of which the grade II listed market cross still exists, having been erected in the 16th century. Another grade II listed building in the village is Newsham Hall, now a farmhouse, it once housed a boarding school in the early 19th century.

In 1870-72 John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales described Newsham as:"a township and a sub-district in Richmond district, N. R. Yorkshire. The township lies 8 miles N W of Richmond, and is in Kirkby-Ravensworth and Barningham parishes. Acres, 3, 312. Real property, £3, 974. Pop. in 1851, 434; in 1861, 366. Houses, 84.
