Carp River is a  river in Chippewa and  Mackinac counties in the U.S. state of Michigan.   of the river were added to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System in 1992.

Description
The Carp River is formed by the outflow of Trout Lake (also known as Carp Lake) in southern Trout Lake Township in Chippewa County at  in the eastern Upper Peninsula.  The river flows generally south and east into Mackinac County.

The Carp River flows for much of its length through the eastern region of the Hiawatha National Forest.  A central portion of the river, near M-123, flows through the Mackinac Wilderness, jointly preserved by the U.S. Forest Service and the Great Lakes Indian Fish & Wildlife Commission of the Ojibwa Indians.

In contrast to much of the Upper Peninsula, the Carp River's watershed is relatively flat, and there are only a few small rapids on the river.  It is often used by canoeists.  Fishermen can find brook trout, brown trout, and rainbow trout in the river in summer, with some salmon in fall.

Close to its mouth, the Carp River is spanned by the Mackinac Trail â€“ Carp River Bridge, a 1920 spandrel arch bridge that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in December 1999.  The river then empties into St. Martin Bay of Lake Huron at .
