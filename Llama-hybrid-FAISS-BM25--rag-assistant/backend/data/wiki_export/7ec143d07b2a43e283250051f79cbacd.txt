The Danzan Ryu lists differ in concept from the Kodokan Judo lists in that the techniques are taught in kata form in some applicable context, rather than
simply demonstrating and enumerating a single technique. Deashi Hayanada, for example, is not a single technique, but a combination of Deashi Harai (foot sweep) and Tenada Shime (cross arm bar). Emphasis on randori may vary greatly from one dojo to the next.

There are multiple romanizations, and many arts have more than one name. This article will attempt to represent the commonly used romanization variants. In addition, not all sources agree on the correct kanji (Japanese characters) for each technique or list. The alternative renderings are noted. The romanization was not agreed to until 1957. The earlier spellings are now archaic. Some kanji are also no longer common and not searchable (e.g. Danchu or Bitei).

The rank requirements for Danzan Ryu are not standardized, and may vary from dojo to dojo or even from instructor to instructor. However, the curriculum is divided into three levels: , , and . Many of the techniques are considered Kuden – to be transmitted orally and never written down.

Each of the Okuden scrolls corresponds to a level of teaching license:

 Shinen-no-Maki was commemorated by the award of the Mokuroku, or catalogue scroll, listing the history of the art along with the Shoden and Chuden techniques. This is the basic instructor level and is equivalent to second-degree blackbelt.
 Shin'yō-no-Maki corresponds to the fully licensed instructor (Kyoshi) level and is equivalent to fourth – or fifth-degree blackbelt.
 Shinjin-no-Maki (post Pearl Harbor attack) was commemorated by the award of the Kaiden-no-Sho, or certificate of complete transmission (menkyo kaiden). This corresponds to the master instructor (Shihan / Professor) level of traditional jujutsu.

Curriculum Order

The Yawara list is almost always taught as the first list in a curriculum, given its overall usefulness.
The first seven techniques, consisting of escapes from simple grips, were once referred to as Te Hodoki (untying of hands), and were the first things taught to a prospective student. While learning the Te Hodoki, the individual's character was observed and assessed, and the teacher would decide whether or not to accept him as a student.
Yawara instruction is usually integrated with instruction in breakfalls (sutemi/ukemi), and (once the student can fall safely) with the first techniques of the Nage Te list.
Following this comes the rest of Nage Te, Shime Te, Goshinjutsu (Jokyu Yawara) and Oku-no-Te, by the time a student is roughly brown belt.
The Kiai no Maki Techniques are generally taught as the student approaches the black belt level, in addition to some or all of Shinin-no-Maki.
Shin'yō-no-Maki and Shinjin-no-Maki are not introduced until after the black belt has been attained, in most schools.
Seifukujutsu, Kappo, meditation techniques, Randori, massage, first aid, and nerve strikes may also be integrated into the curriculum at varying levels, depending on the instructor.
