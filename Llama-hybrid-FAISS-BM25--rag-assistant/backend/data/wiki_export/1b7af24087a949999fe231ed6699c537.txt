It was Anil Kapoor's first lead role in a Hindi movie. The film is a remake of the 1981 Tamil film Andha 7 Naatkal directed by K. Bhagyaraj.

Plot 
Maya (played by Padmini Kolhapure) attempts suicide on the day of her nuptial night. Dr. Anand (played by Naseeruddin Shah), Maya's husband, finds out that she attempted suicide. When Maya gains consciousness, she confides in Dr. Anand saying she did not want to get married and was forced.

The story moves to a flashback, where a new singer, Prem (played by Anil Kapoor) and his sidekick Master Raju, come to Maya's house. It is love at first sight for Maya as she falls for the naive, innocent Prem. However, Prem, aspiring to be a true musician, rejects Maya's advances. Although Prem is in love with Maya, he believes that he is not worthy of her. They declare their love for each other, and plan to elope, but destiny has other plans in store for Maya and Prem. On the day of their elopement, the lovers are caught by Maya's parents. As a result, Prem and his sidekick are kicked out of the house and Maya is forced to wed Dr. Anand.

The plot moves to the present, where Dr. Anand confides in her that he only married her due to his ill mother, Savitri (played by Dina Pathak). Dr. Anand promises to unite the two lovers after his mother's death. During the time of her stay, Maya gets attached to Dr. Anand's daughter (played by Suchita Trivedi). Meanwhile, Dr. Anand searches for and finds Prem. When his mother dies, Dr. Anand reunites Prem and Maya. However, his attempts remain fruitless, as Maya refuses to leave Dr. Anand. Maya realizes the strength behind their marriage and does not budge. Prem leaves Dr. Anand and Maya, stating that this is deviance in the eyes of society.
