History

Etymology 
Banjarbaru was previously only a temporary name used by governor Dr. Murdjani to differentiate it from Banjarmasin, as "baru" means "new" in Indonesian. However, the name stuck between people living there and gradually became official name of the city. Banjarbaru previously consisted of a series of hills known as Mount Apam.

Early history 

Diamond mines in Cempaka have existed since the 15th century under the Hindu-Buddhist kingdom Negara Dipa. In the era of the Banjar Sultanate, there was a royal edict stating that diamonds of four carats or higher should be sold only to the sultan. The place was mostly uninhabited except for resting places of diamond mine laborers from Cempaka, now also part of the city. Cempaka diamond mines under the colonial era were regulated under Ordonantie 25 Nopember 1923 Staatblast 1923 No. 174 together with Pelaihari and Martapura.

After independence 

In the 1950s, because of frequent floods that disrupted government activities in Banjarmasin, it was suggested to relocate the capital of then-Kalimantan province to a new city. The construction and city planning was assisted by a Dutch-descendant architect named D.A.W. Van der Pijl based on the European city concept, which explains the abundance of city parks and a city hall in the center of the city. However, the plan to relocate the provincial government was never realized fully.  only the South Kalimantan governor's office has been relocated, while the parliament is still in Banjarmasin.

The city was previously intended by Sukarno to be new center of the steel industry in Kalimantan with assistance from the Soviet Union to develop it. Cooperation between the two was formalized on 11 September 1956. However, the plan to construct steel factories was never realized until after the 30 September Movement and subsequent purge of communism in Indonesia. Traces of Soviet projects can be seen in the city such as with Mess L.

On 20 April 1999, Banjarbaru was separated from Banjar Regency (of which it had previously been a part) and gained its status as a independent city, although it was still recognized as part of the Banjarbakula metropolitan area. The city legally became capital of the South Kalimantan province on 15 February 2022 following updates of laws concerning legal basis of several provinces were passed by People's Representative Council.

Geography
Banjarbaru is located at the foot of the Meratus Mountains, with 80% of the city area elevated between 0 and  above sea level, but it also includes areas up to  high. In the North, East, and West it borders Banjar Regency, while in the South it borders Tanah Laut Regency. Podzol dominates the city soil, with a concentration of as much as 63.82%. However, Landasan Ulin's soil is instead dominated by peat and alluvium.

Compared to other regencies and cities in the province, Banjarbaru is also the second smallest second-level administrative division in the province after Banjarmasin city, covering around 0.88% of province territory.

Banjarbaru receives  of rain annually. Temperatures are uniform in all months due to its equatorial location, with the average annual temperature being .

Around 94% of the city population are Muslim, 4.6% are Christian, 0.21% Hindu, and 0.16% Buddhist. There were 133,558 male and 132,0172 female people in the city as of mid 2022, with a sex ratio of 100:101. North Banjarbaru is the most densely populated district with 2,048 people per square kilometre in mid 2022 and Cempaka is the least dense district with 324 people per square kilometre.

Life expectancy of the city is 71.87 years as of 2019, which is slightly above the national figure and significantly higher than the provincial figure.

Economy

Other big sectors include restaurant & hotel and construction, accounting for 18.70% and 18.33% respectively. In 2013, the service sector alone employed 26,533 people from the city. Other sectors such as processing (12.06%), communication (7.95%) and banking (4.01%) also exist in the city. The creative economy and tourism only employed around 500 people in 2020.

Cempaka district's economy is the only one that relies on mining (mainly diamond) and the agriculture sector. The diamond mining industry is plagued by free riders. According to Media Indonesia, in 2011 there were 200 miner groups, consisting of around 1,000 diamond miners in 4 urban villages (kelurahan), both with modern means of mining diamonds with water pumps or traditional methods. The diamond mining industry in Cempaka occupies around 2,000 hectares of area in the district. The city authority faced difficulty in collecting taxes from the mining industry because of its informal nature and the fact that most diamond transactions happened in secrecy. This, combined with the general decline of mining industry investment, made mining only account for around 8.12% of the city's gross regional product in 2011. The agriculture sector is also shrinking and contributes little to the city's economy, with the figure 4.51% in 2011. The amount of paddy fields in the city is small, only 4,522 hectares cultivated in 2010. The young and educated demographic that are not interested in the mining or agriculture sector combined with city's lack of natural resources compared to neighboring regions made both sectors shrink in size. The unemployment rate is 5.06% as of 2019.
