Dromiskin (historically Druminisklin, from ) is a village and townland in County Louth, Ireland. It is situated 10 km south of Dundalk, about 1 km inland from the Irish coast.

History

The village was home to a monastery for hundreds of years, which was reputedly associated with Saint Patrick. The first bishop of Dromiskin was Lughaidh, son of Aengus mac Nadfraoch the first Christian king of Munster. St Patrick reputedly pierced Aengus's foot with his pastoral staff during the baptism.

Áed Findliath monarch of Ireland, son of Niall Caille, retired to and died at Dromiskin. The Chronicon Scotorum records his death at 879. O'Donovan records his death as 876 and the Annals of Ulster place it at 878.

The next few hundred years were turbulent times for Dromiskin. The constant plundering by both Vikings and Irish destroyed the Abbey and dispersed the monks. Annudh macRuaire rampaged through the territory in 1043 and Dromiskin was destroyed. The ecclesiastical site was abandoned and the monks took refuge in the neighbouring Abbey of Saint Mochta, the possessions of this ancient church being placed in the hands of the Prior of Louth Abbey.

Dromiskin served as the home to the Archbishops of Armagh for a time. The Archbishops of Armagh lived at Dromiskin House. Archbishop Milo Sweetman is buried here.

The old ninth-century round tower and parts of the Abbey still remain. From the tower, there is a view of all of Dundalk Bay and the surrounding countryside.
