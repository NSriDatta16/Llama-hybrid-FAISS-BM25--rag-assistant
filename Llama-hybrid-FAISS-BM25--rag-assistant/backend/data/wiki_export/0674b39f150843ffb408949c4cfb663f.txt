Randy Kenneth MacGregor (born July 9, 1953) is a former professional ice hockey player.  MacGregor played Junior Hockey in Ontario, before going pro with the Broome Dusters (Binghamton, NY) of the North American Hockey League in 1973.  He skated much of his professional career in Binghamton.

MacGregor would make the transition with the Dusters in 1977 into the American Hockey League.  The Dusters became the Whalers in 1980 and MacGregor would spend part of the 1980â€“81 season in Klagenfurt, Austria.  He would return to Binghamton later that season, but would end his career in 1984 in Glens Falls, NY with the Adirondack Red Wings.

Following his playing days, MacGregor returned to his adopted hometown of Binghamton.  He is a contractor and has been a hockey coach with the Southern Tier Hockey Association and Syracuse Stars minor hockey systems.  MacGregor continues to reside in the area; now calling Vestal home.   He has two adult sons Justin and Dillon.
