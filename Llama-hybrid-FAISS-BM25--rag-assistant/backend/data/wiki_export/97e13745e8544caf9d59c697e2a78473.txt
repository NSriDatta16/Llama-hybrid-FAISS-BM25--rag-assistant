Princess Vittoria Cristina Adelaide Chiara Maria di Savoia (born 28 December 2003) is second in line to the headship to the House of Savoy, the former ruling family of the Kingdom of Italy. She is the first-born child of Emanuele Filiberto, Prince of Venice and Piedmont and Clotilde Courau.

Early life and family
Princess Vittoria was born on 28 December 2003 in Geneva, Switzerland. Her father Emanuele Filiberto, Prince of Venice and Piedmont was then the heir apparent to the Italian throne and her mother Clotilde Courau is a French actress. Her younger sister Princess Luisa was born in 2006. She is the granddaughter of Vittorio Emanuele, Prince of Naples, the current head of the House of Savoy, and his wife Marina Doria. Her great-grandfather, King Umberto II was the last King of Italy before the monarchy was abolished in a 1946 referendum. Her great-grandmother was Marie-Jos√© of Belgium, the last Queen of Italy.

Christening
She was christened on 30 May 2004 by Monseigneur Giovanni Cheli at the Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi in Assisi. Her godparents were Ottavio Mazzola and Roberta Fabbri. The baby wore the christening gown that had been worn by her great-great-grandfather King Vittorio Emanuele III at his christening on 31 May 1869. Among the guests were Prince Albert of Monaco, Princess Maria Beatrice of Savoy, Prince Sergius of Yugoslavia and Princess Mafalda of Hesse, granddaughter of Princess Mafalda of Savoy. The parents selected Assisi in light of its symbolism of peace.

Succession

Princess Vittoria's grandfather, Vittorio Emanuele, Prince of Naples changed the rules of succession which previously only allowed males to be the heir to the throne. Under the rule changes, Princess Vittoria, as the first born child of her father will one day succeed him as the Head of the House of Savoy. Her parents had never produced a male heir, but had two daughters. Despite being the heir to the now defunct Italian throne, she lives in Paris in neighboring France. The current line of succession within the House of Savoy is disputed by Prince Aimone, 6th Duke of Aosta. 

In June of 2023, her father Emanuele Filiberto, Prince of Venice announced he would abdicate his claim as heir apparent in favor of Princess Vittoria. This makes Princess Vittoria the heir apparent to the head of the House of Savoy. She will become the first woman to lead the House of Savoy.
