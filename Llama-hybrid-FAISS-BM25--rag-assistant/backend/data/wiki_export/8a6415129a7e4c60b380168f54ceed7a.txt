• Steve Blum - Ben 10 (2005) and Ben 10: Omniverse

In the reboot continuity, Vilgax is Azmuth's former assistant, who stole the Omnitrix from him and used it for universal conquest. However, Azmuth managed to drain half of Vilgax's DNA and put it into the Omnitrix, leaving him powerless until he recovered his full power from Ben years later.
