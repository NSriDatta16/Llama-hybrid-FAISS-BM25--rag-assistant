The Getaway is singer Chris de Burgh's sixth original album, released on A&M Records in 1982. It was the first studio album of de Burgh's to chart in the UK, following the compilation Best Moves a year earlier. The album peaked at number 30 in the UK and spent 16 weeks on the chart. In the week beginning 7 February 1983, the album went to the top of the album charts in the then West Germany. In Canada the album spent 36 weeks in the Top 100.

Background

The album was spearheaded by the U.S. top 40 hit, "Don't Pay the Ferryman", an upbeat, mythology-tinged pop rock song that evokes images of the Grim Reaper, which also became his first UK hit single, reaching number 48.

Another song from the album which has become a de Burgh fan-favourite is "Borderline", the story of a conscientious objector who chooses to flee with his lover than be drafted for military service.  A staple of de Burgh's live act, the song's story was continued in 1986's "Say Goodbye to It All" from the later album Into the Light.

Drums on the album were played by Steve Negus of the Canadian progressive rock band Saga.

Some of the guest vocalists were Anthony Head, Diane Davison (Chris de Burgh's wife) and Miriam Stockley (who also collaborated with Mike Oldfield on the album The Millennium Bell (1999).
