He was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in 1980 and took silk (QC) in 1993. He was admitted to the Bar of England and Wales in 2009 and elected a Bencher of the Middle Temple in 2011.

He represented Andy Coulson in relation to perjury charges.

He has regularly appeared in the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom.

Personal life
Keen is married and has two children. He was reported to be one of the highest earners in Scotland, being featured on a list of the top 100 earners in 2003. In 2017, Keen was charged with contravening section two of the Firearms Act 1968 by failing to safely secure a shotgun, to which he pleaded guilty and was fined the sum of £1,000. A hearing of the Bar Tribunals and Adjudication Service in 2019 found that the offence constituted a breach of standards, but did not amount to professional misconduct.
