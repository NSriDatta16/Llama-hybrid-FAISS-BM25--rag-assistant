Museumsufer (Museum Embankment) is the name of a landscape of museums in Frankfurt, Hesse, Germany, lined up on both banks of the river Main or in close vicinity. The centre is the historic art museum Städel. The other museums were added, partly by transforming historic villas, partly by building new museums, in the 1980s by cultural politician Hilmar Hoffmann. The exhibition hall Portikus was opened on an island at the Alte Brücke in 2006.

, 39 museums belong to the Museumsufer.

History 
The idea for a group of different museums in Frankfurt was proposed in 1977 by Hilmar Hoffmann, who was then as  Kulturdezernent responsible for culture in the city. Before, architect  had proposed a concept  to the forum for development (Frankfurter Forum für Stadtentwicklung). Between 1980 and 1990, existing museums were expanded and many new ones built, often including historic villas. Architects included internationally known Richard Meier, Oswald Mathias Ungers, Josef Paul Kleihues, Günter Behnisch and Hans Hollein.

Beginning in 2008, Frankfurt has restored and expanded some of its museums. The Städel was expanded by an annex, and the Film Museum was renovated.
