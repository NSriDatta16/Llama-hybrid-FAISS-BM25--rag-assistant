The Cuneta Astrodome is an indoor arena that is located in Pasay, Philippines. The arena has hosted Philippine Basketball Association games from 1993 to 1999 and again from 2001 onwards, and also currently serves as the home arena of the Pasay Voyagers of the Maharlika Pilipinas Basketball League. It also became the permanent home of the now-defunct Philippine Super Liga since 2014. It has also hosted a slew of other political, evangelical gatherings and church anniversaries. 

Despite its name, the Cuneta Astrodome is not a dome-shaped indoor arena, since its exterior is rectangular in shape.

History

The Cuneta Astrodome was built to complement the adjacent Pasay City Sports Complex which is in a dilapidated state prior the Cuneta Astrodome's construction. The arena is named after Enrique Cuneta, a prominent Pasay city official in 1816 who is also the ancestor of Pablo Cuneta, who was mayor of Pasay in the 1990s. The indoor arena was built in 1993 from a loan grant from the Philippine National Bank.

Facilities
The Cuneta Astrodome has a 12,000 seating capacity and air-conditioning system is installed to cool its interior.

Basketball

Philippine Basketball Association

Built in 1993, the arena became the PBA's home after the league signed a five-year deal with the Pasay city government, which includes the league's office within the Astrodome's vicinity. The league also manages maintenance and marketing of the Astrodome. During the first two years, the league played all of its games (except those played in provinces) exclusively at the Astrodome before limiting its schedule to Tuesday and Sunday games, as the league played its Friday games at the Araneta Coliseum in 1995.

In 1999, after the agreement expired, the league transferred its offices and most of its games to the PhilSports Arena, the PBA's home from 1985 to 1992. Although the league hosted a few games at the said venue, it was not used for the duration of the 2000 season. Since 2001, the league has hosted a lot of games at the Astrodome, including several recent PBA championship series games.

It has hosted more than 30 PBA championship series, most recently the Game 2 of the 2011 PBA Commissioner's Cup Finals.

It is one of the alternate venues of the league, together with the PhilSports Arena in Pasig and Ynares Center in Antipolo if either the Smart Araneta Coliseum and the SM Mall of Asia Arena are not available.

Amateur/Collegiate leagues
Aside from hosting PBA games, it also held several collegiate leagues such as the UAAP, NCAA, NAASCU, WNCAA and the UCAA. The UAAP held the men's senior basketball championships in 1994 and 1999. The NCAA hosted some championship matchups in the 2003 Finals, 2005 and 2008 with the most recent in 2003, when Letran defeated San Sebastian in the third and final game of the series, the only time it was held at the venue during the series.
