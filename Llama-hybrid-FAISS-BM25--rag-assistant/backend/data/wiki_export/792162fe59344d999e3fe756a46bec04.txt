Raúl González Sánchez (born June 5, 1967) is a boxer from Cuba, who won the silver medal in the Men's Flyweight Division (– 51 kg) at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. In the final he lost to North Korea's Choi Chol-Su. Three years later, at the 1995 World Amateur Boxing Championships in Berlin, he captured the bronze medal in his weight division.

Career
U.S. boxer Rudolph Bradley said his first thought when Raúl González put him down was, "Man, he's strong. I knew the Cubans were strong but I didn't think he could put me down. Yeah, I was in trouble, but I was boxing and moving, trying to get my head back. I've never been stopped, I've been hit hard hundreds of times in Army fights."
