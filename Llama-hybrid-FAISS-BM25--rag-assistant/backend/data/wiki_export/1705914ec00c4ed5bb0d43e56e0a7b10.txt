History
Industry was founded as Industrial Complex in 1978 by Mercury Caronia (drummer, vocalist, keyboard player, composer and studio engineer), Andrew Geyer (guitarist) and Sean Kelly (bass guitarist and backing vocalist). The band's name was later changed to Industry. Caronia and Geyer worked with experimental electronic music, odd time signatures, tape loops, synthesizers and innovative guitar playing into various methods of recording.

In 1981, Geyer and Kelly left the band. Guitarist Brian Unger, new lead singer Jon Carin and Rudy Perrone (who was previously in a progressive rock band called Cathedral, with Mercury Caronia) joined the group which signed to Capitol Records.

The band's best-known single, "State of the Nation", entered the Swedish and Italian charts between 1983 and 1984, earning them a place as the support act for artists such as Billy Idol, Talk Talk and INXS. The second single from the same album, "Still of the Night", was less successful. The band split up in 1984.

Post-split
After the split, Carin started a successful session musician and solo career, becoming a permanent member of the Pink Floyd live band and co-writing Pink Floyd's hit single "Learning to Fly". Unger and Perrone went on to form their own bands.
