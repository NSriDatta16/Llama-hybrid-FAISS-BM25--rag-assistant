Plot 
Hiroki Imanishi and Kanata Tokino are two young guys who have been close friends in all their lives. One dark and stormy night, Hiroki Imanishi leapt in front of a car, saving one young girl's life—and ending his own. The moment he leaves his body, Hiroki is joined by an evil spirit named Fhalei Rue, an evil spirit who takes an interest in Hiroki. Hiroki then realizes that his mortal body is possessed by Fhalei.
One night, Kanata sees the spirit of Hiroki and communicates with him, and the next day he asks who the real Hiroki is, to Fhalei (who is inside of Hiroki's body). In a fit of rage, Fhalei attacks Kanata, using Hiroki's body, but she goes back to see who tries to drown, because she did not want to kill anyone. Then, Hiroki (his fleshly body) falls off a cliff and Kanata also because of trying to save the first one.
Almost drowning, the two parts of Hiroki (the body and the soul) are transported to a fantasy world where they meet Fhalei. There, they discover that Kanata has a special power (a very strong love for Hiroki, which gives light, thanks to its strong friendship). Fhalei understands that is useless to struggle against Kanata, realizing that Hiroki's light belongs to him. Then she pushes back the time, and Hiroki returns to life after the accident. The spirit goes out of the boys' lives.
Their classmates look for them everywhere, until finally they appear safe on the beach. The OVA ends with an embrace between the two main characters, as they used to do when they were little.
