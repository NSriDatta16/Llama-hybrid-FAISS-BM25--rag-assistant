Lê Tuấn Hùng (born 1960 in Vietnam) is an Australian-Vietnamese composer, performer, and musicologist. He is a multi-instrumentalist with a strong background in Vietnamese traditional music and Western classical music. Known as a skilled performer of the đàn tranh, a Vietnamese zither, he plays traditional Vietnamese music as well as cross-cultural and experimental music.  His compositions have been created for a wide range of instruments, ensembles and media. A number of his compositions combine Vietnamese instruments with Indonesian and European Renaissance and Medieval instruments.

He holds a Bachelor of Music degree from the University of Melbourne and a Ph.D. in Music from Monash University. He is married to Dang Kim Hien (Ðặng Kim Hiền).
