The Frasers of Strichen are a branch of the highland Clan Fraser of Lovat, which assumed the chiefship of the clan in the 19th century.

After Archibald Campbell Fraser of Lovat, the third son of Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat, died without descendants in 1815, the chiefship of Clan Fraser was passed to Thomas Alexander Fraser of Strichen. He was a descendant of the 7th Lord Lovat.

In 1854 the title of Lovat was restored, which made him the 12th Lord Lovat. This also entitled him and his descendants to a seat in the House of Lords, until the House of Lords Act 1999 ended the right of hereditary peers to sit in the House of Lords.

The current chief of the Clan, Simon Fraser, 16th Lord Lovat, is a direct descendant of Thomas Alexander Fraser of Strichen.
