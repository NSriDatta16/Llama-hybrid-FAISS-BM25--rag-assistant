History
In 1966, the station signed on as KWMT-FM.  It was the FM counterpart to KWMT (540 AM), simulcasting its country music and farm news programming.  Around 1970, it switched to an automated beautiful music format, later taking the call sign KKEZ.

In 1979, KKEZ changed from beautiful music to contemporary hit radio (Top 40) as "Fort Dodge's Hit Radio 94, KKEZ". The station became branded as "Z94" by veteran Iowa programmer Jim Davis in 1986. In the early 1990s, the station changed its format to adult contemporary as "Mix 94.5" until it went soft adult contemporary in January 2009.

In 2007, the KWMT and KKEZ were acquired by Clear Channel Communications, a forerunner to iHeartMedia.  iHeart later sold to Alpha Media.  On July 31, 2009, the station reverted to its adult contemporary format while keeping the "Mix 94.5" name.
