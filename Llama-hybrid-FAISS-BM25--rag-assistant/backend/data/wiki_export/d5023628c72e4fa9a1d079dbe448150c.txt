He owned a mainly wooded smallholding with house, Abinger Hall in Abinger, Surrey, which was renamed at or before the early 1700s when bought by the Dowager Countess of Donegal. Its predecessor was demolished and rebuilt by Farrer's father and is a non-listed home around a courtyard of its former wings and other houses. In 1882 and 1886, on admission of his brothers to Trinity College, Cambridge University, the family also had their home at 27 Bryanston Square, London.
