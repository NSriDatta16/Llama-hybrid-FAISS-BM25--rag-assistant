Coat of arms

The coat of arms of Archbishop Chia consists of a shield upon an archiepiscopal cross surmounted by a green galero with 10 gold fiocchi (tassels) suspended on each side. These are standard ecclesiastical heraldic devices indicating the coat of arms is that of an archbishop.

The flame and dove on the left half of the shield represents the Holy Spirit. The open book on the right half depicts the Word of God. The fish and wavy blue lines represent Singapore and the Archdiocese. The coat of arms also include Archbishop's motto Omnia Omnibus, which is Latin for all things to all men (1 Corinthians 9:22).

The coat of arms was designed by a team from the Catholic Audio-Visual Centre, Singapore.

Appointment as Archbishop
Prior to his appointment as Archbishop, Archbishop Chia was the Parish Priest to the Church of the Holy Cross. When Archbishop Gregory Yong retired, Pope John Paul II appointed Archbishop Chia to the office, other candidates for the office were current Vicar General Monsignor Eugene Vaz and then Rector of St Francis Xavier Major Seminary, Fr. Anthony Ho who has since retired. (No attribution)

Archbishop Chia reached the retirement age of 75 in 2013 and submitted his resignation to the Holy See. His resignation was accepted by Pope Benedict XVI at Noon (Rome Time), 18 May 2013, 18:00 SGT. He is succeeded by Archbishop William Goh.

In February 2014, the Archbishop Emeritus sustained head injuries in a bad fall and was in a coma for more than a month. As he did not recover fully from his injuries, he continues to be cared for in one of Singapore's Catholic nursing homes.
