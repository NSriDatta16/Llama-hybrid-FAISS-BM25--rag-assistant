The Pueblo Bighorns were a minor league baseball team which played in Pueblo, Colorado.  They were a member of the Texas–Louisiana League, an expansion team owned and organized by the league's investors, and brought professional baseball back to Pueblo.  They played the first half of their inaugural season, until financial difficulty, lack of corporate sponsorship and resulting poor fan attendance (due to the franchise's hasty organization) forced the Bighorns to disband.  Like all TLL clubs, they were unaffiliated with Major League Baseball.  The team played at Rawlings Field on the campus of Colorado State University Pueblo.
