The station is on the stretch of line opened in 1888 between Brockenhurst and Christchurch to provide a direct line from London to Bournemouth, bypassing the original "Castleman's Corkscrew" line via Ringwood and reducing that line to a backwater.

The station was originally named Hinton after the nearby village, but shortly after being opened was renamed Hinton Admiral to share its name with Hinton Admiral House, the residence of Sir George Tapps-Gervis-Meyrick who owned the land on which the station was built.

The station was host to a Southern Railway camping coach from 1938 to 1939. A camping coach was also positioned here by the Southern Region from 1954 to 1960, the coach was replaced from 1961 to 1965 by a Pullman camping coach.
