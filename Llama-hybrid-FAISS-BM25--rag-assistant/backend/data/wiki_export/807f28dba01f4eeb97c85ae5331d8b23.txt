Etymology 
The name Mandurriao was derived from the names of two crocodiles fighting named Mandu and Riao during the exploration of the Spaniards in Iloilo. The names of the crocodiles were originally from two now-defunct lakes also named Mandu and Riao, where the two crocodiles' habitats are, respectively. It later formed in the minds of the people that the place was called Mandurriao. Eventually, the letter "r" in Mandu-Riao was replaced with "rr". For the Spaniards, having an "rr" in a word brought further beauty and character.

History 
Mandurriao was founded in 1726. Originally a municipality in its own right, it became part of Iloilo City on July 16, 1937, along with the former towns of Arevalo, La Paz, and Molo under Act No. 719 of 1903.

Initially, Mandurriao was predominantly a residential and agricultural district, known for its fishponds and salt beds. However, over time, the district underwent significant transformation and evolved into a bustling business district. The former fishponds and salt beds have given way to urban development, paving the way for the emergence of the city's new commercial hub.

Today, Mandurriao stands as a thriving area with a vibrant mix of residential, commercial, and business establishments. It has become an important center of commerce and economic activity within Iloilo City. The district's urban development has attracted various industries, contributing to the growth and prosperity of the city as a whole.

Mandurriao Airport period (1937–2007) 

Mandurriao Airport was built in 1937 and has served as the gateway to Iloilo. The airport was also used as a World War II airfield. In the 1990s, the Philippine aviation industry liberalized and air travel increased in the country, and problems at Mandurriao Airport began to emerge, prompting the national government as well as the city and provincial government's agreement to a proposal to build the current Iloilo Airport outside of the city.

Development period 
In 2007, the new airport in Cabatuan, Iloilo was opened, rendering the old airport in Mandurriao available for privatization. Megaworld Corporation acquired the 72-hectare site of the old airport for ₱1.2 billion (approximately $2.5 million) with plans to develop it into Iloilo City's new central business district (CBD), known as Iloilo Business Park.

The transformation of the former airport site into the Iloilo Business Park has attracted significant investment from prominent companies. Alongside Megaworld Corporation, Ayala Corporation, SM Development Corporation, and Gaisano Group of Companies have also invested in the surrounding area of Mandurriao. This influx of investment has led to the development of commercial and residential projects, including office buildings, shopping centers, hotels, and residential condominiums.

In 2015, the Iloilo Convention Center was constructed on the former site of the airport's passenger terminal, which had been demolished between 2012 and 2013. The Iloilo Convention Center played a pivotal role in hosting the APEC Finance meetings in the same year, showcasing Iloilo's capacity to host international events.

The development of the Iloilo Business Park and the surrounding area in Mandurriao has significantly transformed the landscape and economic profile of the district. It has become a vibrant center for business, commerce, and leisure, attracting both local and foreign investments while contributing to the overall growth and progress of Iloilo City.
