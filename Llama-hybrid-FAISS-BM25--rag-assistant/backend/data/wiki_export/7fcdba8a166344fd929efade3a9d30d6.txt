This is a list of all past winners of the official GAA GPA All Stars Awards in Gaelic football since the first awards in 1971. As an insight to the prominent players of the 1960s, it also includes the unofficial "Cuchulainn" awards presented from 1963 to 1967 under the auspices of Gaelic Weekly magazine.

For each year since 1995, when the official award began, the All Stars Footballer of the Year is highlighted with FOTY. If the footballer of the year did not win an All Star Award, his name is added to the list as FOTY. The unofficial Texaco Footballer of the Year, awarded since 1958, is a guide to the leading players of the past.
