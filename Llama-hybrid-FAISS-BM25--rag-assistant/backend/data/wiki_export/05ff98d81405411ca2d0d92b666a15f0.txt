Teflic acid is the chemical compound with the formula . This strong acid is related to orthotelluric acid, . Teflic acid has a slightly distorted octahedral geometry.

Preparation
Teflic acid was accidentally discovered by Engelbrecht and Sladky. Their synthesis did not yield the anticipated telluryl fluoride , but a mixture of volatile telluric compounds, containing :
 (25%)

Teflic acid can also be prepared from fluorosulfonic acid and barium tellurate:

It is also the first hydrolysis product of tellurium hexafluoride:

Teflates

The conjugate base of teflic acid is called the teflate anion,  (not to be confused with triflate). Many teflates are known, one example being , that can be pyrolysed to give acid anhydride .

The teflate anion is known to resist oxidation. This property has allowed the preparation several highly unusual species such as the hexateflates  (in which M = As, Sb, Bi). Xenon forms the cation .
