History

Martín Carpena arena opened in 1999. It has been the long-time home arena to one of Spain's top basketball teams, Unicaja Málaga, of the Liga ACB.

The arena originally had a seating capacity of 9,743 spectators, and an area of around 22,000 square meters. In 2007, a project was proposed to expand the capacity of the venue to 17,000 spectators, due to the high demand for seats and tickets by fans of Unicaja Málaga. Ultimately, the expansion project was approved, but to a new capacity of 13,000 spectators, rather than the originally planned 17,000. The expansion project was then scheduled to be completed in separate phases. The first expansion phase, which was completed in 2010, increased the seating capacity from 9,743 to 11,300. The next expansion phase will increase it to 13,000.
