California's 3rd congressional district is a U.S. congressional district in California. It includes the northern Sierra Nevada and northeastern suburbs of Sacramento, stretching south to Death Valley. It encompasses Alpine, Inyo, Mono, Nevada, Placer, Plumas, and Sierra counties, as well as parts of El Dorado, Sacramento, and Yuba counties. It includes the Sacramento suburbs of Roseville (the district's largest city), Folsom, Orangevale, Rocklin, and Lincoln, and the mountain towns of Quincy, South Lake Tahoe, Truckee, Mammoth Lakes, and Bishop. The district is represented by Republican Kevin Kiley.

Prior to redistricting in 2020, the 3rd district encompassed most of the Sacramento Valley north and west of Sacramento. It covered all of Colusa, Sutter and Yuba counties, most of Glenn, Lake, Solano and Yolo counties and a portion of Sacramento County. The district was represented by John Garamendi, a Democrat.

Recent history 
The 3rd district once extended up the Sacramento Valley from Sacramento to take in rural territory up to Tehama County. Once a Democratic bastion, the district was pushed into more rural and Republican-leaning territory after the 1990 census, and finally elected a Republican in 1998. The 2001 reapportionment made the district more compact and Republican than its predecessor, though it was far less Republican than the neighboring 4th district. Although there was some movement in registration in favor of the Democrats, it still had a strong GOP flavor as most of the Sacramento area's Democratic voters lived in the neighboring 5th district.

While George W. Bush carried the district in 2004 with 58.2% of the vote, the district swung rapidly in the Democratic column in 2008 with Barack Obama narrowly winning a plurality with 49.28% of the vote over John McCain's 48.81%. However, despite Obama's win, in the congressional election held on the same day the Republicans retained the seat.

After redistricting, this district essentially became the 7th district, while a new 3rd was created with lines similar to what the old 3rd had in the 1990s. This version of the 3rd was considered a swing district, though the bulk of its population lives in Democratic-leaning areas in the outer Bay Area and in the closer-in suburbs of Sacramento.
