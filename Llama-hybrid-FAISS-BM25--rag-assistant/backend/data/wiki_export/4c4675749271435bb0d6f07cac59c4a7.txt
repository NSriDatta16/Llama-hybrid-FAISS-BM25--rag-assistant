Katzen the Tiger Lady is a female performance artist and tattoo artist, whose full body tattoo theme is that of a tiger. (Katzen is the German word for cats.)

Tattooing 
She received extensive tattooing on all parts of her body and wore tiger whiskers attached via piercings on her face. Most of the feline tattooing occurred between the ages of 18 and 28. More than 227 different tattoo artists have inked her up, including 23 at one time. Katzen removed her plastic whiskers after 14 years of wear because she started to feel that they affected her field of vision.

She was at one time married to Paul Lawrence, who performed under the name "The Enigma," with whom she collaborated in a musical show team called The Human Marvels, and with whom she bore one daughter, Caitlin, who was raised by Katzen's mother. After divorcing, Katzen eventually moved on to have a son, Kevin, and married someone of the same gender.
