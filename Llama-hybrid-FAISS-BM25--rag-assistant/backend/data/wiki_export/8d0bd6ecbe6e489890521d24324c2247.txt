Resolve is Lagwagon's seventh studio album, released in 2005. It is inspired by and dedicated to former Lagwagon drummer Derrick Plourde who committed suicide on March 30, 2005. All of the songs were written shortly after that event. Resolve was Lagwagon's last studio album to feature longtime bassist Jesse Buglione, who left the band in 2010.
