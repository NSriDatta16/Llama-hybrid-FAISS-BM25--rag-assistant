History

Ridgefield opened in 1852 as an original station on the Danbury and Norwalk Railroad. The name was changed to Branchville upon the 1870 opening of the Ridgefield Branch. A new station building was built around 1887 and served until the current station house was built in 1905. The building is currently occupied by the Whistle Stop Bakery, which opened in the 1980s. The Ridgefield Branch was used for passenger service until 1925 and for freight service until 1964.

The station has one three-car-long high-level side platform to the west of the single track. A  passing siding extends north from the station.

The station has 168 parking spaces, is owned by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (ConnDOT), and managed by the town. However, Metro-North is responsible for trash removal.
