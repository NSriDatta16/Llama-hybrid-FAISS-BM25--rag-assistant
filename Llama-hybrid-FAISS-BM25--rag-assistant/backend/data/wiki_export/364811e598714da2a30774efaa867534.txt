The Islamabad Policy Research Institute (IPRI), established in 1999, is one of the leading think tanks in Pakistan. It is affiliated with the National Security Division (NSD), a part of the Government of Pakistan. IPRI focuses on datafication, digitalization and analysis of information relevant to policy decisions.  As a result of recent reforms, IPRI is ranked 74th in the University of Pennsylvania’s Think Tanks and Civil Societies Programme. 
The Institute not only conducts multi-disciplinary research, it also promotes civil society-governmental interactions and policy dialogue through national, regional and international conferences which enhances the country’s research capacity and environment by facilitating issue-centric discourse. IPRI’s publications offer current, up-to-date and high-quality research. It disseminates its findings and policy recommendations through its publications (triple-peer-reviewed journals, books and monographs). In order to foster goodwill and North-South and South-South communication of cultures and ideas, IPRI also supports academic exchange programmes between regional and international researchers and think tanks.
IPRI deals with all facets of National Security, including International Relations & International Law, Strategic Studies, Governance & Public Policy, and Economic Security. 
IPRI exemplifies two decades of rigorous and timely analysis of crucial strategic agendas and inter-governmental processes that influence national and regional policy community. The global geopolitical environment remains highly fluid. With each passing day, new situations emerge, creating challenges, shaping new courses of action and influencing public perceptions and state policies. Through independent, rigorous and timely analysis, IPRI provides research inputs to policymakers for making informed decisions.
