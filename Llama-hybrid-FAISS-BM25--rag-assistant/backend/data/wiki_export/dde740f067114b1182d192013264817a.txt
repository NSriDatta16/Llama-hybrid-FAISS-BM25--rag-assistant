Don Bosco Technical College, also referred to by its acronym DBTC, Don Bosco Mandaluyong or informally DB Manda, is a private Catholic basic and higher education institution run by the Salesians of the Society of Saint John Bosco in Mandaluyong, Metro Manila, Philippines. Established in 1953 by the Salesians, it is the first Don Bosco Educational Center in Metro Manila. Don Bosco Mandaluyong offers co-educational primary (elementary) and secondary education (junior high school), co-educational senior high school and college (tertiary education), night school (alternative learning system), and vocational training for out-of-school youth.

The college department was formerly exclusive for males until 2004, when the department started accepting female students. DBTC has been starting to accept female students in SY 2020–2021. Following the nationwide implementation of K-12, DBTC implemented the co-educational senior high school program in 2016.

It is part of the IUS or the Istituzioni Universitarie Salesiane (Salesian University Institutions), the Don Bosco Educational Apostolate of the Philippines and the Don Bosco Philippines North Province (DB-FIN). Don Bosco Mandaluyong was awarded the ISO 9001:2000 certification (Certificate No. 6720) by Moody International Certification (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd. and United Kingdom Accreditation Service.

Don Bosco Mandaluyong was envisaged as one of the "big three" schools in Mandaluyong, together with La Salle Green Hills and Lourdes School of Mandaluyong, which also offer all-boys elementary and secondary education. However, of the three, only Lourdes School of Mandaluyong remained an all-boys school by AY2020-2021. DBTC is deemed the "motherhouse of all Salesian works in the Philippines," making it the premier Salesian institution for higher learning in the country. Its campus is located at 736 General Kalentong Street in Mandaluyong, Metro Manila, Philippines.

History

18th-19th centuries
Don Bosco Technical College stands on historic grounds. The 18th-century Spanish building (1716) at the heart of the campus is a testimony to events that led to the 1896 uprising of the country's patriots, the Katipuneros, against the Spanish colonizers.

The building later became the Asilo de Mandaloya, an orphanage where Mother Consuelo Barcelo y Pages stayed for 16 years (1883–1899). She co-founded the Augustinian Sisters of Our Lady of Consolation.

20th century
Early in the 20th century, the building became the San Carlos Seminary, home for the formation of the local clergy. One of them was Rufino Santos, the first Filipino cardinal of the Church.

Don Bosco Mandaluyong opened as a school aptly named "Don Bosco Technical Institute–Mandaluyong" on 2 June 1953 with 47 first-year high school students.

Present day
Since its foundation, Don Bosco Mandaluyong has grown into a complex setting that serves almost 4,000 students and 40,000 parishioners. Its services include the Basic Education Department, College Department, Industrial Technicians Course, Manpower Skills and Training Center, Center for Research and Training, Information Systems and Technology Center, Don Bosco Youth Center, St. Dominic Savio Parish, and Pinardi Boarding House.

Seal

The seal is bordered on top by the school's motto: Ascende Superius, which means "come up to a higher place".

At the center of the seal is a cross, symbolizing the primacy of Catholic education and formation of the institution. The cross rests on a salakot - a traditional Filipino hat - to signify the distinct Filipino character.

Between the horizontal section of the cross and the salakot is the founding year of the school, 1953, appearing atop three lines. The lines represent the three elements of Don Bosco's Preventive System of Education, namely: Reason (principle-driven life), Religion (spirituality) and Loving Kindness (connectedness and mutuality). The lines which resemble waves, daluyong in the local language, recall the legendary origin of the community of Mandaluyong. Tradition has it that the name of the city where the school is located originated from the abundance of the waves or "mga daluyong".

The half-gear on the left and the laurel leaves on the right that surround the central design are emblematic respectively of technical and academic education. This seal in its current form was first used in 1988–89. The original seal consisted only of the blue-green half-gear and laurel leaves.
