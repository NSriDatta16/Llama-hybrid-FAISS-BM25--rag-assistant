Route description

After the river the road becomes more north–south and enters Henry County and the town of Knightstown. In Knightstown SR 140 follows Jefferson Street, passing through residential properties. SR 140 ends in downtown Knightstown at an intersection between Jefferson Street and Main Street (US 40). Jefferson Street continues north as a city street towards the north side of Knightstown. The highest traffic count is in downtown Knightstown, where 2,536 vehicles travel the highway on average each day. The lowest traffic count is at the southern end of SR 140, where 641 vehicles travel the highway on average each day.

History
SR 140 was first designated by September 1932. The original routing started at the Indiana Soldiers and Sailors Orphans Home, now Hoosier Youth Challenge Academy, and ran north to US 40 much as it does today. Between 1935 and 1937, SR 140 was reconstructed to be a high level of road, with a hard driving surface. Since its paving, the route has not undergone any major changes.
