Route description

NY 249 begins at a junction with NY 5 (the Seaway Trail / Erie Road) and County Route 34 (CR 34; Lotus Point Road) in the village of Farnham, located in the town of Brant. NY 249 proceeds eastward away from NY 5 as a two-lane residential road, crossing east through Farnham as Commercial Street. The route crosses under tracks owned by CSX Transportation. After the tracks, NY 249 darts southeast, then east through Farnham as a two-lane residential roadway, crossing the eastern village line. In Brant, NY 249 drops the Commercial Street moniker in favor of Brant–Farnham Road, crossing an at-grade intersection with US 20 (Southwestern Boulevard).

After US 20, NY 249 continues eastward on Brant–Farnham Road, crossing under the lanes of the New York State Thruway (I-90), however no interchange is present.

The route crosses over Big Sister Creek and becomes residential as it enters the village of North Collins, located in the town of the same name.

At this junction, NY 249 leaves Brant Street for Sherman Avenue, crossing multiple residences and over the former Erie Railroad's Buffalo and Southwestern Railroad. At the junction with High Street, NY 249 runs south for a block on High Street, intersecting with Thiel Road, which NY 249 leaves the village of North Collins on.

Thiel Road and NY 249 wind southeast as a two-lane residential road, soon intersecting with Langford Road, where NY 249 turns off Thiel into the town of North Collins. The route crosses through a rural section of North Collins, intersecting with CR 501 (Ketchum Road). After CR 501, NY 249 continues eastward on Langford Road, intersecting with CR 486 and CR 487 (Jennings Road). The route crosses over a brook and remains going eastward as it enters the hamlet of Langford. In Langford, NY 249 passes several residences before intersecting with NY 75 (Sisson Highway).

History
NY 249 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. It initially began at U.S. Route 20 (now NY 5) in Farnham and ended at NY 18 (now U.S. Route 62) in North Collins even though the portion of modern NY 249 east of North Collins was also state-maintained as well.
