Nottingham Cooperative (or Nottingham as referred to by its residents) is a 21-room housing cooperative located at 146 Langdon St. in Madison, Wisconsin, on the shore of Lake Mendota. Nottingham was incorporated in February, 1971, by a group of lawyers and students from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. The membership is usually composed of a mix of about 20 students and non-students. Unlike eleven other housing cooperatives near the campus area, Nottingham is not part of the Madison Community Cooperative.

The building was built in 1927 in the Mediterranean Revival Style.

Nottingham has hosted musical and dramatic events.

History

The house was originally built in 1927 for the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity by Kansas architect Clarence E. Shepard (1869 - 1949). Shepard was an architect of Frank Lloyd Wright's Prairie School in Kansas City, although 146 was built in the Mediterranean Revival Style. At that time, this Spanish style of architecture was popular on the west coast, especially in Hollywood, but rare in the Midwest. Nottingham's tile roof is one of the building's Mediterranean Revival features. 

Past owners include the fraternities Sigma Phi Epsilon (1927–1939) and Phi Sigma Delta (1940–1942), an all-girls dormitory called Shoreland House (1943–1951), and the fraternity Pi Lambda Phi (1952–1970). Nottingham celebrated its 50th anniversary as a co-op in 2021.

Events
Over the years Nottingham has hosted many events, usually held in the ballroom. Nottingham collects no money for these shows.
