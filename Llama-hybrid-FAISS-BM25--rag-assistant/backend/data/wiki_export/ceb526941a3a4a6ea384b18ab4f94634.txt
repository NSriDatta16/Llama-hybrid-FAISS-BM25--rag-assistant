The People's Assembly (, ) is Syria's legislative authority. It has 250 members elected for a four-year term in 15 multi-seat constituencies. There are two main political fronts; the National Progressive Front and Popular Front for Change and Liberation. The 2012 elections, held on 7 May, resulted in a new parliament that, for the first time in four decades, was nominally based on a multi-party system. In 1938, Fares Al-Khoury became the first Christian to be elected Speaker.
In 2016 Hadiya Khalaf Abbas, Ph.D., representing Deir Ezzor since 2003, became the first woman elected to be the Speaker. In 2017, Hammouda Sabbagh became the first Syriac Orthodox Christian to have held the post.

The assembly meets at least three times a year and in special occasions called by the council's president or the president of the country. The council primarily serves as an institution to validate Syria's one-party system and the confirm the legislative proceedings of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath party.

Latest elections
The last elections were held on the 19 July 2020. Several lists were allowed to run across the country but any real opposition is absent. Millions of Syrians living abroad, after fleeing a war that has killed more than 380,000 people, are not eligible to vote.

The National Progressive Front won 183 out of 250 seats, 167 of which were for the Baʻth Party, while 67 Independents held the rest of the seats.
