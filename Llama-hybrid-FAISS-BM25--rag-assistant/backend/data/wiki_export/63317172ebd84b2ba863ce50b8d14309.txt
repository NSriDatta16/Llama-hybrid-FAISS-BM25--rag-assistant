Windows Live Favorites (codenamed Roaming Favorites) was a part of Microsoft's Windows Live range of services. It allowed users to access and edit their favorites from any computer. Users could import their bookmarks from Internet Explorer and MSN Explorer, add favorites by dragging and dropping, clicking the "Add Favorite" button on Windows Live Toolbar, or using the right-click menu. It also allowed users to find favorites more quickly using name, address, folders or tags. Windows Live Favorites allowed a total of 1000 favorites and folders per user account. Users were required to sign in with their Windows Live ID in order to use this service.

On April 14, 2009, Windows Live Favorites was integrated into Windows Live SkyDrive. All existing favorites were migrated to the "Favorites" and "Shared Favorites" folders on Windows Live SkyDrive.
