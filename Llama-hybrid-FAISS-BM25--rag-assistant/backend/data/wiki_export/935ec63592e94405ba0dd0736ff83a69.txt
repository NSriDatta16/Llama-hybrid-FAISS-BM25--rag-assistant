New York's 12th congressional district is a congressional district for the United States House of Representatives located in New York City. As of 2023, it is represented by Democrat Jerry Nadler, redistricted incumbent of the former 10th congressional district who defeated incumbent Carolyn Maloney in the August 2022 Democratic primary. The redrawn District 12 includes the Upper West Side constituency (former District 10) represented by Nadler since the 1990s, the Upper East Side, and all of Midtown Manhattan. The district is the smallest congressional district by area in the U.S.

Pre-redistricting, the district included several neighborhoods in the East Side of Manhattan, the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn, and western Queens, as well as Roosevelt Island, mostly overlapping the pre-redistricting 14th district. The 12th district's per capita income, in excess of $75,000, is the highest among all congressional districts in the United States.

History
During the Civil War, the 12th District comprised the counties of Dutchess and Columbia. The 12th District eventually became a Brooklyn district in the mid-1960s, as the result of a district realignment due to the Supreme Court's decision in the Cooper v. Power case in 1966. The district was realigned to include majority African American neighborhoods such as Bedford-Stuyvesant in Central Brooklyn. Until 1992, it was the Central Brooklyn district now held by Yvette Clarke (and formerly by Major Owens), and then remapped to include Hispanic neighborhoods in Lower Manhattan and Queens.
