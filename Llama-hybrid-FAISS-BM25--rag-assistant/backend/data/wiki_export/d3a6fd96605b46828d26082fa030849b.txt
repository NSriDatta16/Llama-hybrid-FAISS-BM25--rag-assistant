Niles East High School was a public 4–year school in Skokie, Illinois. Operated by Niles Township High Schools District 219, Niles East was first opened in 1938 and closed after the 1979–1980 school year. Niles East's sister schools Niles West High School and Niles North High School remain open. The school was known as Niles Township High School until Niles West High School opened in 1959.  The school sports teams were named the Trojans. The school's greatest claims to fame are its two Nobel Laureate alumni—perhaps even more notable because the school was open for only 42 years. It ranks high among schools around the world on the list "Nobel Prize laureates by secondary school affiliation." The school buildings were demolished by Oakton College.

History
In 1975 Niles Township High School District 219 announced that Niles East would be closed in 1980 and all students and faculty were moved to Niles West and Niles North. On the evening of November 2, 1978, then President Jimmy Carter attended a "Get out the Vote" Rally at Niles East, where he was given an honorary diploma from the school.

After closure
After Oakton Community College moved from their original Morton Grove campus to Des Plaines, Oakton opened a branch campus in the former Niles East building. District 219 administrative offices were temporarily located in the shuttered Niles East. Centre East for the Performing Arts was located in the former Niles East Auditorium until their current facility opened near Golf Road and Skokie Boulevard. Oakton Community College demolished the original high school buildings in stages as new buildings opened. The only remaining structures of Niles East as of 2017 are the courtyard flagpole and the basement under the gymnasium that is now used for storage.

Pop culture
After its closing in 1980, exterior and interior shots of the school were used in scenes from films such as Risky Business (1983) and the John Hughes films Sixteen Candles (1984), Weird Science (1985), and Pretty in Pink (1986).

Alma Mater
Gold and Blue

Gold and Blue we sing to you
To you we bring our hearts so true
When we go off to College, we will think of you old school
Where we gained lots of knowledge and learned the golden rule
Though years may come and years may go
Deep in our hearts we'll always know
That there's only one real high school
And so we sing anew
We love you Gold and Blue
