Fictional character biography
Little has been revealed. He does know the Eternal Gilgamesh (aka the Forgotten One), and has been fighting the Dragon of the Moon for centuries, both on Saturn's moon Titan and on Earth. Their last battle was during the 6th Century AD.

He lived as a hermit for the following hundreds of years. He was discovered by Manslaughter, and, impressed, the Interloper trained Manslaughter. Later, when the Dragon of the Moon enslaved Moondragon, the Interloper confronted and then joined Moondragon's team, the Defenders, in battling Moondragon and the Dragon of the Moon. In the battle, the Interloper tried to hurl his life force against the Dragon; he was transformed into a statue that crumbled into dust. Due to the intervention of the Vishanti, Interloper's life-force has been merged with the body of Will Fanshawe, a Welsh truck driver; they share possession of this body, which can now transform into an exact duplicate of Interloper's old body, including all of his Eternal powers. No more than 2 years later, he then defeated Moondragron by using his new schema to his advantage.
