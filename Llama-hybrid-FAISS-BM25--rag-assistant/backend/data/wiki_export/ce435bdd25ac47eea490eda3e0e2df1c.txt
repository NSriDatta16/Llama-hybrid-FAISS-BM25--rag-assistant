After spending 3 seasons as a cast member on MADtv, Kilbane appeared with small and supporting roles in films such as Monkeybone, Evolution, and Meet Dave. In 2003, Kilbane was considered for his own sketch comedy show on Comedy Central called The Pat Kilbane Show. A pilot episode was filmed and produced. However, Comedy Central ended up passing on greenlighting the pilot to the series. In late 2004, Kilbane opened Wexford Hill Hobbies on Stroop Road in Kettering, Ohio. The store specialized in gaming hobbies including role-playing, tabletop, and miniature games. In 2007, he sold the store and it was renamed KrystalKeep by new owners.

Despite being a cast member on MADtv, Kilbane did not limit himself and often did side projects.

After three years on the show, Kilbane left MADtv at the end of season five.
