History
One of the first Russian settlements in Siberia, Turukhansk was founded in 1607 as a winter camp () for Cossacks and merchants. After the disastrous fires of Mangazeya in 1619, 1642, and 1662, Turukhansk welcomed a large portion of the older colony's population and became known as New Mangazeya. A timber fort with cannons was built there in 1677. The settlement hosted one of the largest fairs in Siberia and was incorporated as an uyezd town of Turukhansk in 1785. The town declined after 1822.
