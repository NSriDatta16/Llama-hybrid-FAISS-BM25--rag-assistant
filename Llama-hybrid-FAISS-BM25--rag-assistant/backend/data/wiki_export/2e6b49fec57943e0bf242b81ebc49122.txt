Wendell Castle (November 6, 1932 – January 20, 2018) was an American sculptor and furniture maker and an important figure in late 20th century  American craft. He has been referred to as the "father of the art furniture movement" and included in the "Big 4" of modern woodworking with Wharton Esherick, George Nakashima, and Sam Maloof.  

Castle introduced a woodworking technique called stack lamination to the creation of furniture.  Originally used for making duck decoys, this technique allowed "infinite flexibility" and unprecedented control over shape and form. In addition to working in wood, he used plastics and metals.

During his life, Castle received many of awards including a 1994 'Visionaries of the American Craft Movement' award sponsored by the American Craft Museum, a 1997 Gold Medal from the American Craft Council, and a 2001 Award of Distinction from The Furniture Society.

Education 
Castle was born in Emporia, Kansas. He grew up and graduated from Holton High School in Holton, Kansas Class of 1951. In 1958, he received a Bachelor of Fine Arts in industrial design, and in 1961, he received a Master of Fine Arts in sculpture, both from the University of Kansas.

Career
From 1962-1969, Castle taught at Rochester Institute of Technology, School for American Craftsmen, in Rochester, NY, and was an Artist in Residence.  He bought a former soybean mill in  Scottsville, New York in 1967 and converted it into a 15,000-square-foot studio. It stands near the former Baltimore & Ohio railroad station, the studio of Castle's wife, ceramicist and sculptor Nancy Jurs.

From 1969 to 1980 Castle taught on the faculty of The College at Brockport, State University of New York.  
In 1980, he opened the Wendell Castle School in Scottsville. The nonprofit school offered instruction in fine woodworking techniques and in furniture design. As of 1988 the Wendell Castle School became part of the Rochester Institute of Technology's furniture making program.

Castle is famous for his pioneering use of stack-lamination, a woodworking technique he introduced in the 1960s.  It was based on a 19th-century sculptural technique used for making duck decoys. Stack-lamination allowed Castle to create large blocks of wood out a series of planks, which were then carved and molded into the biomorphic shapes for which he is best known. 

Castle died of leukemia in 2018.  He was survived by his wife of fifty years, Nancy Jurs.
