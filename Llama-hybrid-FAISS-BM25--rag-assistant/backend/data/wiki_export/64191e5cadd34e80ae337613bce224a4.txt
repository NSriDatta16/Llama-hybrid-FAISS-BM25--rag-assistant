Centennial High School is one of twelve public high schools in the Frisco Independent School District in Frisco, Texas, United States. It serves grades nine through twelve. In 2022, the school was rated "A" by the Texas Education Agency. It also has 3,132 students in 2023

History 
The school opened in the fall of 2003, initially to serve 9th and 10th graders. It was the second to open in the district, after Frisco High School. At the time, the school served all of the school district's area east of Preston Road as well as portions of north Plano and western McKinney. The first graduating class from the high school graduated in spring 2006.

The school's enrollment grew quickly, fueled by Frisco's record growth. As early as 2006–2007, Centennial had exceeded its capacity of 1800 students, and in the fall of 2006 Liberty High School was opened to help relieve this overcrowding. Despite the addition of several new wings and classrooms during the 2011–2012 school year which brought total capacity to 2,100 students, Centennial became overcrowded once again, peaking at an enrollment of 2,190 in 2013–2014. In compliance with the district's policy of keeping school sizes small, a portion of the school's attendance zone was allocated to that of Independence High School in 2014. In the fall of 2016, the opening of the district's ninth high school, Lebanon Trail High School, further lowered enrollment at Centennial. The school's attendance zone is currently built up.
