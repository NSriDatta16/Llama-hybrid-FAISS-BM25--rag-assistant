Reception

As noted by Robert Christgau in the Village Voice, "Lillian Berlin is Johnny Rotten with politics. His art would be nothing without his rage; he is possessed by the need to get his point across that he grabs his brothers' music by the throat and makes it bellow his tune. But his rage wouldn't be much without his analyst,which however simplistic-and it is, though at this perilous moment no more so than apolitical cynicism or liberal equivocation-gives shape, purpose, and a referent outside his tortured psyche to feelings that emanate from who knows where." (May 10, 2005)

The following is a sampling from other professional reviews of the album:
"One of the most ferocious straight -ahead rock album since "Nevermind" -Brian Rafferty, Spin April 2005
"Living Things are a band of fighters determined to make us all feel like winners" 4 stars review David Fricke Rolling Stone Magazine Oct 2005
"...what rock'n roll should be sounding like" Barry Nicolson, NME
"...an agitprop opus that attacks the apathy, paranoia, and mood-altered gazes of George Bush-era America"- Stephen Mooallem, Interview Magazine
"It's been a long time since rock music felt remotely dangerous. But along come Living Things-three brothers from St.Louis who mash out an archaic collision of power chords and screaming vocals that feel like a bottle breaking your head. With the simplicity of the Ramones and the fury of Nirvana, Living Things would blast of adenoidal angst if it were not for their politics" -Dimitri Ehrlich, Interview Magazine
"...songs that pair AC/DC's aggression with Fugazi's humanistic fervor"- Jenny Williams Spin
"They are the hardest new rock band around"- Chuck Eddy Village Voice
