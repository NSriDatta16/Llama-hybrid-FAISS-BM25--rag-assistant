"Sumahama" is a song by American rock band the Beach Boys from their 1979 album L.A. (Light Album). Written by Mike Love, it was lyrically inspired by his fiancée at the time, a woman named Sumako. The lyrics describe "a young girl who wants to go with her mother to a place called 'Sumahama' in search of her father." Although some of the lyrics are in Japanese, Sumako was of Korean descent.

Background
It was originally written by Mike Love for his unreleased solo album, First Love. When the release of that project fell through, the song was rerecorded by the Beach Boys.

The original United States LP release of the L.A. (Light Album) featured a version of "Sumahama" that faded out early during the final Japanese verse and did not feature the instrumental ending present on the later released 45 or the re-released CD version of the album. The original LP version of the song was approximately four minutes and seven seconds.

Single release
In the U.S., "Sumahama" was released as a B-side to the single "It's a Beautiful Day".

"Sumahama" was released as a single in the UK backed with "Angel Come Home", charting at number 45.
