Hardcore Devo: Volume Two is the last of two collections of demos by American new wave band Devo, released on August 23, 1991, by Rykodisc.

Background
The Hardcore Devo albums are collections of 4-track basement demos recorded by the band between 1974 and 1977. Some tracks are earlier versions of some of Devo's best known tracks that would later be re-recorded and used on subsequent Devo records (e.g. "Jocko Homo," "Mongoloid"), but a majority of the tracks were never re-used and remained unreleased until the Hardcore Devo compilations.

Hardcore Devo: Volume Two was out of print for years; however, it was re-issued by Superior Viaduct in 2013, both as a vinyl release (May 2013) and a CD containing both volumes and bonus tracks (July 2013).
