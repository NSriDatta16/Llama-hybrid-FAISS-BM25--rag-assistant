History

The college is under the management of the Institute of the Franciscan Missionaries of Mary. It was founded on 15 August 1947 with an enrollment of 32 students in the intermediate class. Stella Maris was granted permanent recognition in 1951. The college has the unique credit of having initiated bachelor's degrees in Western Music and History of Fine Arts, as well as master's degrees in Social Work and Indian Music, at the University of Madras.

Additionally, it was the first women's college in Madras to offer M.A. degree courses in English, economics, and fine arts. In 1960, the college moved from Santhome to a more spacious campus, "The Cloisters", Cathedral Road, Chennai. The following few decades saw tremendous growth and development in the college with several firsts and distinctions. The college was one of the few chosen to start the pilot project of the National Service Scheme in 1968. A spacious library was erected on the occasion of the Silver Jubilee of the college in 1972 and occupies a place of pride on the campus as well as in Chennai.

From 1978 onwards there was a shift in the admission policy, keeping in mind the thrust of the college towards social justice. Conscious of the growing need for academic freedom, the college launched into autonomy in 1987; the 1990s saw the college offering several new job-oriented courses as well as additional sections for the departments of B.Com. and mathematics. On the occasion of the Golden Jubilee, the St. Clare's Centre- a four-story building that houses the administrative offices, an audio-visual room, computer laboratories, and several classrooms- was erected. With ten years of experiential learning processes behind it, the college restructured its system of education by introducing a credit-based system in 1997, offering many new academic programmes that encourage interdisciplinary associations.

Coaching for the civil services exams was launched in November 2009. The college also conducts coaching classes for both faculty and students who are preparing to appear for the NET and SLET exams.

Conservation
As of 2014, the college has undertaken around twelve environmental initiatives including light-emitting diode cluster lights, solar-powered streetlights, source segregation, vermi-composting, and waste water recycling plant. In January 2014, the college opted for green energy with the installation of a 50-kilo watt roof-top solar power plant on its campus. The plant, installed by Omega Natural Polarity Private Limited at a cost of  5 million, has 200 solar panels and caters to six percent of the total power requirement on the campus, powering lights and fans in the college.
