Colomesus is a genus of pufferfishes confined to tropical South America. Apart from differences in size, the three species are superficially similar, being green above, white below, and patterned with black transverse bands across the dorsal surface.  C. asellus is commonly found in the aquarium trade, while C. psittacus, due to its size and more specialized requirements, is not found as often.
