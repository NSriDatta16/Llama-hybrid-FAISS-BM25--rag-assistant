Pandorea jasminoides, also known by the common names bower of beauty and bower vine, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bignoniaceae and is endemic to eastern Australia. It is a woody climber with pinnate leaves that have three to nine egg-shaped leaflets, and white or pink trumpet-shaped flowers that are red and hairy inside. It is also grown as an ornamental.

Description
Pandorea jasminoides is a woody climber with dark brown bark and glabrous stems. The leaves are mainly arranged in opposite pairs along the stems or sometimes in whorls of three, and are  long and pinnate with three to nine leaflets. The leaflets are egg-shaped to more or less lance-shaped,  long and  wide. The leaves are on a petiole  long, the lateral leaflets on petiolules  long and the end leaflet on a petiolule  long.

The flowers are borne on the ends of stems or in upper leaf axils in groups  long. The five sepals are fused at the base forming a cup-shaped tube  long with lobes  long. The five petals are fused at the base forming a trumpet shape that is white or pink on the outside and pink to red and hairy inside, the tube  long with lobes  long. The four stamens are enclosed in the petal tube. Flowering occurs from September to March and the fruit is an oblong or oval capsule  long and  wide containing winged seeds.

Taxonomy
Bower of beauty was first formally described in 1837 by George Don, who gave it the name Tecoma jasminoides in his book, A General History of Dichlamydeous Plants. In 1894, Karl Moritz Schumann changed the name to Pandorea jasminoides in Die Nat√ºrlichen Pflanzenfamilien.

Distribution and habitat
Pandorea jasminoides grows in rainforest from central eastern Queensland to the  Hastings River in New South Wales with isolated occurrences further south in Kangaroo Valley and as far north as Mount Lewis National Park in far northern Queensland.

Use in horticulture
This climber can be propagated from seed, stem cuttings or by layering. Its vigorous growth makes it suitable for screening or climbing on pergolas and trellises, however it should not be planted near sewer pipes. The species has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

Pandorea 'Lady Di', a cultivar with snow white, trumpet flowers is also a vigorous climber.
