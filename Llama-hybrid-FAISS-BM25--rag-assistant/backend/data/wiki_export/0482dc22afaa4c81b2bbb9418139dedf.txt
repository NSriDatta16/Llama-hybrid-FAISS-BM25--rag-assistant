The Honglujing Stele () is a tablet 3 meters wide, 1.8 meters tall, & 2 meters thick. It has 29 Chinese characters written on it.

It is the only Tang dynasty stele found in Manchuria. It mentions the founding king of Balhae, King Go.

The stele is currently located in the Tokyo Imperial Palace. It was taken by the Japanese from the Chinese city of LÃ¼shun in circa 1907 after the Russo-Japanese War. Chinese researchers are now studying it for the first time.
