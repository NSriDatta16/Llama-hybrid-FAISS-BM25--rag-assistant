History

Vallendar is first mentioned around 830–840 AD as the property of the Archbishop of Trier; it was probably, however, of Celtic origin and a lot older (700–600 BC). In 1143 Schoenstatt Abbey was founded. In 1232 the Count of Sayn took possession of the land and began building a castle at the northern edge of the town in 1240. Its foundations today support the Marienburg.

From the 14th century the Archbishop of Trier regained more and more power over the land to become proprietor again in 1681 and in 1767 (for good). Today the Lion of Sayn and the Cross of Trier are evidence of this history in Vallendar's coat of arms.
During the Middle Ages a Palatine high court was located in Vallendar. 1802 the proprietorship went to the Count of Nassau-Weilburg; in 1815 it fell to the Kingdom of Prussia. A rich business life is the reason why Frederick William IV of Prussia granted town rights to Vallendar in 1856. In 1939 Mallendar was added to the town. It was the scene of a military action by the 23rd US Infantry. From 1954 to the 1970s numerous new construction areas were established. Since 1973 the skyline has been dominated by the "Humboldthöhe".

Today Vallendar's appearance is influenced mostly by the internationally renowned Schönstatt and the WHU – Otto Beisheim School of Management and its students.

Trivia

A city named "Vallendar" is included in the PC game Call of Duty 2. This fictional city also lies on the river Rhine. The players task is to fight retreating German soldiers during World War II. Other than its location on the river the virtual Vallendar has nothing in common with its real world counterpart.
