History
Carrollton is named for the Carroll family, prominent landowners of the 19th century. The remaining home of the Carroll family is located at the intersection of Reynolds Drive and Norsworthy Drive, and is considered to have been in deteriorating condition for many years. At one time the home also is said to have served as the Carrollton Country Store.

The Carroll home is one of only a handful of truly historic Carrollton homes. It predates the original Carrollton Post Office, which is now occupied by a locally owned heating business. The old post office is located about  east of the Carroll home on Norsworthy Drive near the western end of the current CDP. Its flagpole still stands.
