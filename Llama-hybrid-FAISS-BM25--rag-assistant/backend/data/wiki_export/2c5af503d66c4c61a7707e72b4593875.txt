History
In 1883, the first school in Ocean City was built in 1883 between 8th and 9th Streets on Central Avenue, serving Kindergarten to High School. The first graduating class of six students was in 1904. A separate elementary school was built in 1913, causing the original Central Avenue to become the sole building for the high school. In 1923, a new high school was built between 5th and 6th Streets on Atlantic and Ocean Avenue, and the original facility became the city's police department and municipal court. The high school on Atlantic Avenue expanded in 1967, and again in 1983. By 1995, the Ocean City School Board decided that the 1923 facility was outdated and failed to meet state efficiency standards. After two failed referendums on expanding the school, a referendum in 2001 passed to build a new high school, having secured $11.5 million in state funding (equivalent to $ million in ). The new facility opened in 2004, and the original high school from 1923 was demolished in 2005 apart from the main entrance. The main entrance of the original building can still be seen on Atlantic Avenue.

In September 1959, the three sending districts of Linwood, Northfield and Somers Point  were notified by the Ocean City School District that overcrowding would mean that it would no longer be able to continue accepting students from the communities at Ocean City High School starting in the 1959-60 school year. When Mainland Regional High School opened for the 1961-62 school year, with rising seniors from the communities given the option to complete their schooling at Ocean City High School.

An observatory was built at the school in 2012, with a telescope capable of 700x magnification.

Facility

A new building was constructed at the site that served as the high school until 1924. The second OCHS building was constructed between 5th and 6th Streets and Atlantic and Ocean Avenues, by Vivian B. Smith, an architect and OCHS alumnus, and was expanded in 1963 with north and south wings added. After 1961, students from Somers Point and Linwood no longer attended the high school.
