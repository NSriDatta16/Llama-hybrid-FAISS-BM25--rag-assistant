She has played many lead roles in the West End and has represented Britain in the kayak marathon. She was a gold medallist at the world masters in 1997.

Later in her career, she tore her anterior cruciate ligament, an injury which left her unable to walk. Upon recovery, she responded to an advertisement for volunteer drama and voice specialists in Nigeria, helping women and children find self-empowerment through theatre. This inspired her to retrain as a voice and text coach.

From 2005 to 2008 she worked for the Royal Shakespeare Company as a voice specialist.

In 2008, Gradwell began work as voice and text coach at Sydney Theatre Company, in Sydney Australia, where she is currently employed.
