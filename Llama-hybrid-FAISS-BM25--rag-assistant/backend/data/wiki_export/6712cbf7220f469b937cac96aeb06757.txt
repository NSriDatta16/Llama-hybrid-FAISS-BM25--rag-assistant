Red Stars Theory is an American rock band from Seattle, Washington.

History 
The band was formed in early-1995 when James Bertram was looking for someone to play guitar with and found Tonie Palmasani (guitar/vocals), Jeremiah Green (drums/percussion/vocals) and Jason Talley (bass guitar/vocals). Later in 1995, the group released a 10-inch on Deluxe Records, the "Slow Curve/Castle Rock" seven-inch and the LP/CD But Sleep Came Slowly. The seven-inch and LP were released by the RX Remedy label, a division of Sub Pop. Seth Warren was asked to play violin on But Sleep Came Slowly and has since been a member of the group. The LP/CD Life In A Bubble Can Be Beautiful was the group's debut album for Touch and Go Records. But Sleep Came Slowly and Life In A Bubble Can Be Beautiful both featured Lois Maffeo as a guest vocalist. Sarah May Cates was a guest cellist on Life In A Bubble....

Red Stars Theory took a hiatus for several years following the release of an eponymous EP for Touch and Go Records in 2000. Due to Jeremiah and Jamesâ€™ hectic touring schedules (playing in both Modest Mouse and 764-HERO), the band has had a fairly infrequent touring schedule.

Suicide Squeeze has released a compilation CD combining the band's out-of-print Rx Remedy seven-inch and Deluxe Records 10-inch. In 2000 Suicide Squeeze released the "Naima" seven-inch, a minimalistic cover of a song from John Coltrane's Giant Steps album. The b-side of "Naima" is "North to Next (exit)", a remix by Scientific American featuring prominent samples from the first two tracks of Life in a Bubble.... 

In 2006, the band contributed the track "Evergreen and Ivorbean" to Suicide Squeeze's 10th anniversary compilation, the CD/LP Slaying Since 1996.
