Before becoming a referee, he played football as a forward. He was educated at and played for Kagoshima National College of Technology and Tokai University.

He announced his retirement from the international game in October 2006 partly because of his knee injury although he still had two years before he reached the mandatory retirement age of an international referee. He quit refereeing entirely in January 2007. He now works for the Japan Football Association to help younger referees to develop their skills.
