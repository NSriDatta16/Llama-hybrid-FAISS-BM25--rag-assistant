Track listing
 The Twelve Pains of Christmas (3:36)
 Parody of "The Twelve Days of Christmas". Sung as a normal Christmas carol, with each verse comedically recited by a participant in a painful activity.
 The Chimney Song (2:06)
 Original song, sung by a little girl. The song describes the ensuing months after Santa Claus gets stuck in someone's chimney.
 We Wish You Weren't Living With Us (0:44)
 Parody of "We Wish You a Merry Christmas". Sung as a normal Christmas carol. About relatives who overstay their visit, becoming a nuisance to the host.
 Wreck the Malls (2:02)
 Parody of "Deck the Halls" performed as glam rock. The song is about excessive Christmas shopping.
 A Visit from St. Nicholson (4:30)
 Parody of "A Visit from St. Nicholas" by Clement Clark Moore, with Bob Rivers impersonating actor Jack Nicholson (satirizing his frequent appearances at Los Angeles Lakers games and his movie roles portraying disturbed maniacs) appearing instead of St. Nicholas. Spoken-word piece with no music.
 O Come All Ye Grateful Dead-Heads (1:23)
 Parody of "O Come All Ye Faithful" describing the Deadheads phenomenon. Sung as a normal Christmas carol.
 I'm Dressin' Up Like Santa (When I Get Out on Parole) (3:06)

 The Restroom Door Said, "Gentlemen" (1:33)
 Parody of "God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen." Sung by an all-male a cappella chorus. The subject has apparently been subjected to a prank in which someone flipped the Men's and Ladies signs to the restroom.
