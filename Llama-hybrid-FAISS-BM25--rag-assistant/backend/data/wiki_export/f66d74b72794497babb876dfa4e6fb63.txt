Zella-Mehlis is a town in the Schmalkalden-Meiningen district, located in Thuringia, Germany. It is situated in the scenic Thuringian Forest, approximately 5 km north of Suhl and 20 km east of Meiningen. The town was notably home to Walther and Anschütz, two of Germany's most notable firearm manufacturers, both of which were originally founded in Zella-Mehlis. They operated there until Soviet occupation of eastern Germany at the conclusion of World War II caused both companies to move. 

In January 2019, the former municipality Benshausen was integrated into Zella-Mehlis, expanding the town's jurisdiction.
