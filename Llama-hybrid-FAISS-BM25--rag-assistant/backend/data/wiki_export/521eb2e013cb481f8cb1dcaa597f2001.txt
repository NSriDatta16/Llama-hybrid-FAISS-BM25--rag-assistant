Iaijutsu is a Japanese koryū martial art founded by Tamiya Heibei Narimasa in the late 16th century.

Lineages 

Three main lineages are usually recognized as being from Tamiya-ryū: Ko Tamiya-ryū, Kishū Tamiya-ryū and Shin Tamiya-ryū.
However, while traditionally accepted as accurate, such classification may be subject to some level of criticism, since Shin Tamiya-ryū is a style on its own, founded by Wada Heisuke and both Ko Tamiya-ryū and Kishū Tamiya-ryū refer to the lineage transmitted in the Kishū domain (now Wakayama Prefecture).

Ko Tamiya-ryū (古田宮流)

 Founder: Hayashizaki Jinsuke Shigenobu 林崎甚助重信
 1st generation: Tamiya Heibe Narimasa (Shigemasa) 田宮平兵衛業正
 2nd generation: Tamiya Tsushima-no-kami Nagakatsu 田宮対馬守長勝
 3rd generation: Tamiya Hyōenojō Nagaie 田宮兵衛尉長家
 4th generation: Tamiya Sannosuke Tomonari 田宮三之助朝成
 5th generation: Tamiya Jirōemon Narimichi 田宮次郎右衛門成道

It is accepted that this lineage got extant after Narimichi left no descendants.
However, there is a document stating that Kishū Tamiya-ryū is the legitimate heir to Ko Tamiya-ryū.

Another lineage that branched from Kishū Tamiya-ryū was Kubota-ha Tamiya-ryū, which had Kubota Sugane as its most famous practitioner. Shingai Tadaatsu(真貝忠篤, 1842-1920), one of the forefront leaders of Dai Nippon Butokukai, is from this lineage.

The Tamiya-ryū/Tamiya Shinken-ryū is a lineage that got widespread in Iyo Saijō domain (now city of Saijo in Ehime Prefecture), when Matsudaira Yorizumi (1641-1711), son of Tokugawa Yorinobu (lord of Kishū domain) and nephew of Tokugawa Ieyasu, became the first Iyo Saijō domain lord, taking along with him Eda Gizaemon, a remarkable master of Tamiya-ryū, and Tsumaki Motouemon Mototaka, a master of military strategy.
Tsumaki's son was Tsumaki Junjiro Motoaya, who inherited the style in the 8th month of 1797 (9th year of the Kansei Era). Since then, the Tsumaki family has kept the lineage, generation after generation.
