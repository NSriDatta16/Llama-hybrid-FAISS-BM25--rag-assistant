Only a Woman Like You is an album by Michael Bolton, released in 2002 (see 2002 in music).

The album constituted a comeback for Bolton peaking at #36. Nevertheless, the album's success could by no way be compared to the success of his previous efforts. The album failed to gain any certification, selling about 400,000 copies in the US and less than 1 million globally.
