Svensktoppen () is a weekly record chart airing at Sveriges Radio. Until January 2003, the songs had to be in the Swedish language. Svensktoppen has aired since 1962, except for the years 1982–1985. The last years before the January 2003 change, the programme was strongly dominated by dansband music.

The first number one hit song was "Midnattstango" performed by Swedish crooner Lars Lönndahl.

New rules on 17 January 2016, restricted the maximum length for a song to chart to one year.
