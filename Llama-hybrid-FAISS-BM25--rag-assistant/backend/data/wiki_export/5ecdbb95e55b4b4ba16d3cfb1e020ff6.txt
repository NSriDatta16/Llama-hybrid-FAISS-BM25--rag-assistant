Stone Bridge crosses Bull Run at the eastern entrance of the Manassas National Battlefield Park in Prince William County, Virginia. The original bridge, built in 1825, was destroyed when Confederate forces evacuated Northern Virginia in March, 1862. In 1884, a new bridge, apparently similar to the original design, was built on the site of the old bridge. Modern day U.S. RouteÂ 29 crosses Bull Run on a bridge built in the late 1960s downstream of this one.
