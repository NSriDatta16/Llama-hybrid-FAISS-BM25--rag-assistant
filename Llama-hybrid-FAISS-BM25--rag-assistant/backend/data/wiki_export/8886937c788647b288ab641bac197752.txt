The Ozark School District #14 is a public school district in western Arkansas, based in Ozark, Arkansas, serving most of northern Franklin County and a small portion of western Johnson County.  The district is a member of the Western Arkansas Educational Service Cooperative, which includes districts in western Arkansas. As of 2004, the student population of the district was about 1,600. The above figure was tallied before the Altus-Denning School District merged with this district the same year, making future tallies notably higher.  The district, most notably the high school,  is most famous for its mascot, the Hillbilly.  Patrons claim that Ozark is the only district in the Union with the Hillbilly as its mascot, though both the nickname and comparable likenesses are used by other schools.  However, Ozark is the only district to use the nickname and likeness together.

History

On July 1, 2004 the Altus-Denning School District consolidated into the Ozark School District; the communities of Altus and Denning became parts of the Ozark district.

Mascot and Colors
The school emblem (mascot) and colors have been shared by all schools in the district.  The Hillbilly, which is almost always depicted in purple overalls and armed with a shotgun, was adopted as the school emblem in 1935.  Purple and gold were adopted as the school colors the same year, replacing the red and white that had been used. The mascot and colors were similar to that of what was then the College of the Ozarks, whose mascot was the Mountaineer until the 1980s.

The original mascot was the Bulldogs until the 1930s when the school board voted to change it to the Hillbilly.  In 2008, the high school baseball team tried to revive the original logo and colors, displaying the original "OHS" logo on their baseball hats which symbolizes a large "O" representing a baseball with an "H" in the middle symbolizing the seams on the baseball and then the letter "S".
