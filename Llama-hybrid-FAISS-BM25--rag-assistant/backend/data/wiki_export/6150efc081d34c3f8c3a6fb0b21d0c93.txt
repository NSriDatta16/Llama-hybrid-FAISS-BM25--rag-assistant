History 
Founded on September 10, 1928, as a Catholic school as a result of overcrowding at St. John's School and Bangor Catholic High School for Girls, the school graduated its first class of girls in 1929. The school operated for four decades as a gender-specific educational environment: the school was bifurcated by the auditorium, with the north wing for boys, the south wing for girls. Later, due to fire safety codes, the rear parts of the auditorium were turned into the front hallways on the first and second stories which now connect the two wings of the original building.

In June 1980, the Diocese of Portland, Maine made the decision to close the school. It reopened the following fall as John Bapst Memorial High School, an independent, coeducational, nonreligious, college preparatory institution, for 193 students.  This was championed by a small group of community members led by Joseph W. Sekera, an alumnus and the school's principal until 2002. In 1988, the institution purchased the building from the Diocese of Portland.

The school was named in honor of Johannes Bapst, a Jesuit missionary and educator who among other things built the first Catholic church in Bangor in 1856.

Admission
For John Bapst and other publicly funded private schools, the State of Maine sets secondary tuition annually (in 2009-10, at $9,154.37). Under Maine's school choice program, more than 90% of John Bapst students have their tuition paid for by public funds provided by their sending communities.

While students must apply to be admitted to John Bapst, no formal admission test is administered to determine what students are accepted.  Application is free of charge.

Bapst offers 17 of 20 varsity sports sponsored by the Maine Principals' Association.

Fire 
On February 18, 2015, the Bangor Fire Department responded to a fire at the school. Around 11:00am, school employees were attempting to melt ice on the roof with a blowtorch. The flames from the torch lit a fire underneath the roof of the building. The fire damaged a biology lab, and a chemistry classroom located on the 4th level of the school. Water damage also damaged the historic auditorium, and the gymnasium below. A Bangor firefighter was injured when part of the auditorium roof collapsed on top of him. The fire occurred during school vacation week, so no students were inside of the building. A dozen faculty members were evacuated safely. School re-opened the following Monday.
