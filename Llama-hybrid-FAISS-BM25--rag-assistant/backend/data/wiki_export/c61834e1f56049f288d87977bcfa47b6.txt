Eh Phouthong  (,  ; born 1975), also spelled Ei Phouthang and Eh Phuthong is a retired Cambodian professional kickboxer and coach of Khmer and Chinese ancestry.  He was also a former reality TV host.  Eh Phouthong was known for his powerful right kick which shattered many arms.  He is the most famous kickboxer from Cambodia. The AFP described Eh Phouthong as "Cambodia's Muhammad Ali".  Eh Phouthong is the trainer of Cambodian champion, Thoeun Theara.

At age 11, Eh wanted to start training but his father didn't want him to because he didn't want Eh to get hurt.  Eh went searching for a teacher and learned from people who knew how to fight in his village.  Since his family was struggling financially, his family sent him to live with Governor Yuth Phouthong who was his father's uncle.  Eh Phouthong began training in pradal serey at age 12 with Yuth Phouthong in the 1980s, who then held the position of Prey Veng provincial governor and then, Koh Kong Province governor. Eh Phouthong had his first Khmer traditional kickboxing contest at the age of 17. Eh said the first time he competed he only made between $4-$5.  His uncle started a club in Prey Veng province and Eh started training under a different teacher by the name of Mr. Kung Sroy.

After getting recognition, Eh moved from Prey Veng province to Phnom Penh and started training with coach Chhit Sarim and coach Kat Phun.  His new coach, Chhit Sarim, was an experienced boxer who fought from 1960 to 1975 with 110 fights and only two losses.  Eh initially began fighting at the 48 kg weight class and then moved to the 63 kg weight class. Then he moved up to the weight class of 85 kg. Growing up he did not have access to education because he was either working jobs to support his family or training in his passion of Khmer kickboxing.

Eh Phouthong has explored media opportunities outside the ring. He has starred in two Khmer-language action films and was the co-host of CTN's highly rated reality show, Kun Khmer Champion.  Finalist, Ai Kosal, is a boxer from 7NG, Eh Phouthong Boxing Club.

In 2001, he defeated French opponent Jean Charles for the third time.  Eh Phouthong said, "I am tired, but I tried my best to fight with a strong French rival...My energy is weaker than foreign rivals, but their technique is no better than mine."

In 2003, Eh Phouthong won a kickboxing championship by defeating Sudanese fighter, Faisal Zakaria.

He is also capable of speaking Thai as well as Khmer.  He reached the semifinal in the first S1 championship in Thailand defeating X Rafi from  Spain and losing in the 2nd round up to the eventual tournament champion Suriya Ploenchit.  He has expressed an interest in wanting to fight John Wayne Parr.

By 2006, Eh Phouthong had amassed 150 fights with 120 fights taking places in Cambodia and 30 fights taking places in Thailand.  Of those fights, he had won 140 times.  He had lost 6 times and had 4 draws.

In 2008, Eh Phouthong said he considered retiring after losing to Australian Adam Shahir Kayoom in the 85 kg weight division.  He looked out of shape and sluggish. He said the problem was his diet and that his new home was far from the training club.  Eh Phouthong's coach, Chhit Sarim, said he trained regularly but didn't rest enough afterward and was out with his friends too much. His coach said the best option would be retirement.

He won a bronze medal in western boxing at the 2009 Southeast Asian Games at Laos in the 81 kg weight division.

Coaching 
In 2005, Eh Phouthong started his own gym and boxing club, Eh Phouthong Tonle Bassac Club. Among his boxers were his younger brother, Auth Phouthong.  His coach, Chhit Sarim, felt great satisfaction that his student Eh Phouthong was able to open a kickboxing club.

In 2023, Cambodian singer Okhna Preap Sovath donated $1000 to boxing coach Eh Phouthong.

In 2023, Eh Phouthong won the "Best Coach Award" from the Khmer Boxing World Championship Techo Santepheap. Eh Phouthong said this about winning as best coach, “I'm really happy. This is the first time I have won this award. It’s a great encouragement for me to put my efforts into promoting our Khmer martial arts.”

Eh Phouthong's gym was renamed Galaxy Navatra Eh Phouthong Club after Okhna Leng Navatra announced a partnership.  
On July 7, 2023, the Galaxy Navatra Eh Phouthong Khmer martial arts club was inaugurated.  The ceremony was attended by Okhna Leng Pros who is general director of Galaxy Navatra group.  He said the reason for the partnership with the club was to maintain the achievements and value of Eh Phouthong as the King of boxing in Cambodia.  The partnership is set for five years.

He was born in Mondol Seima district, Koh Kong province, Cambodia. Eh Phouthong currently lives in Phnom Penh. He has a father named Yem Lim and a mother named At Uth. He also has a brother and a sister.  His father and grandmother were also martial artists.  Eh Phouthong's sons, Eh Virak Khamchit Phouthong and Eh Ammarin Phouthong, are both Kun Khmer boxers.

Eh Phouthong is a big believer in traditional tattoos.  He got his tattoos in Battambang by Sorn Sarin.  In his early 20's, Eh got four "magic" designs on his body to ensure success.  He said "It made a huge difference. I increased the number of victories and reduced the number of defeats. Yet you have to believe in the tattoos for them to be effective. Otherwise, it's just a waste of time."
