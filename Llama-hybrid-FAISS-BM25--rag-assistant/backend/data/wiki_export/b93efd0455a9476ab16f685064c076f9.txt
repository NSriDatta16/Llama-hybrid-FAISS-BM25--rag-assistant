Johann Michael Fischer (18 February 1692 – 6 May 1766) was a German architect in the late Baroque period.

Fischer was born in Burglengenfeld, Upper Palatinate.  He is a major representative of south German Baroque architects. He studied in Bohemia and combined Bohemian elements with Bavarian Baroque traditions. He often co-operated with the most gifted Bavarian artists of his time, such as Cosmas Damian Asam and Egid Quirin Asam, Johann Joseph Christian, Johann Michael Feuchtmayer, Matthäus Günther, Ignaz Günther, Franz Joseph Spiegler, Johann Baptist Straub, and Johann Baptist Zimmermann.

Fischer died, aged 74, in Munich, and is buried in the Munich Frauenkirche.
