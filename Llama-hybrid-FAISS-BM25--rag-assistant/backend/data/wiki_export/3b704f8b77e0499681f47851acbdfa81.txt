History
Badalona was founded in 1903 as Football Bétulo Club, being renamed FC Badalona five years later. It played 14 seasons in the second division (1934–36, 1939–41, 1947–52, 1963–68), but this was prior to the creation of the intermediate Segunda División B.

As the club was constantly in economical problems, having to battle for the people's preference with basketball side Joventut Badalona, it nearly disappeared in the early 2000s (as the side was on the verge of celebrating 100 years) but, after another merge, this time with Unió de l'Esport Badaloní, resurfaced and changed names to Club de Fútbol Badalona – with the latter preserving its history – eventually making its debut in the (new) third level in 2004.

In January 2015, its home ground since 1936, the 10,000 seat Camp del Centenari, was demolished and the club was relocated temporarily to Camp de Montigalà, until the completion of the new 4,100 seat Estadi Municipal de Badalona, inaugurated on 29 January 2017. Average attendance for their home games has been 946 in 2018–19 and 947 in 2019–20.

The club finished 7th in Segunda División B, Group 3 in the 2018–19 season. Badalona had a solid performance at home, having lost only 4 of 19 matches at the Estadi Municipal. The club finished 19th in the COVID-19 shortened 2019–20 season, winning only 3 of their 12 home games, but was not relegated to Tercera División as the Royal Spanish Football Federation revoked all relegations due to the incomplete (3/4 of games were played) season.

On 19 July 2022, Badalona absorbed UE Costa Brava. As the club was relegated to Tercera Federación, Costa Brava changed name to Club de Fútbol Badalona Futur, with the original Badalona acting as a reserve team.
