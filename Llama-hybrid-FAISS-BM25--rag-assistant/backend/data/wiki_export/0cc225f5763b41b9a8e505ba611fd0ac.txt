Dark Adapted Eye is a compilation album by Danielle Dax, an English experimental musician, formerly of The Lemon Kittens. Released in 1988 on Sire Records on LP, cassette and CD, it consisted of material from albums and singles released on her own label, Awesome Records, and was the first release of her material in North America. After being out of print for years, the CD was reissued in the U.S. by the Noble Rot label in 2008.  In 2019, the U.S. label Rubellan Remasters remastered the album and reissued it on CD with several bonus tracks different from the original release.  All tracks were produced by Dax and co-written by David Knight.

This compilation album could be considered an expanded international edition of her third album, Inky Bloaters, missing only "Born to Be Bad" from that album.

Cover artwork is by Holly Warburton.
