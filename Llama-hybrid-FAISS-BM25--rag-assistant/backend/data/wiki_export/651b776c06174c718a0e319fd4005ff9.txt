"Battle for our Soviet Ukraine") is a 1943 Soviet documentary war film by Ukrainian director Oleksandr Dovzhenko and Yuliya Solntseva. It is Dovzhenko's second World War II documentary, and dealt with the Battle of Kharkov. The film incorporates German footage of the invasion of Ukraine, which was later captured by the Soviets.

Plot 
The plot tells of the events of autumn 1943 on the southern fronts of the German-Soviet war. The film differs from its peers in that for the first time viewers of the military chronicle heard the "living voices" of soldiers, a huge number of philosophical generalizations written by O. Dovzhenko in the form of lyrical reflections and voiced by Leonid Khmara.

The film includes footage of the trophy German newsreel.
