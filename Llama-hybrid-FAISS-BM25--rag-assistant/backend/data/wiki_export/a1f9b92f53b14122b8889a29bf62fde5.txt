In the 2006 municipal elections in Ontario, voters in the province of Ontario, elected mayors, councillors, school board trustees and all other elected officials in all of Ontario's municipalities.  These elections were regulated by the Municipal Elections Act of Ontario.

Date 
Municipal elections in all Ontario municipalities took place on Monday, November 13, 2006 (notwithstanding advance polling arrangements). Currently municipal elections in Ontario have fixed election dates, and the next round of elections are due to take place in November, 2010.  Prior to the vote in 2006, the period between elections had been 3 years.

Voting Notice and Attention 
Candidates may have withdrawn from the race prior to November 13, 2006, and while their names may still have appeared on the ballot, voting for a withdrawn candidate resulted in a spoiled ballot and was not counted.

Term lengths 

The Legislative Assembly of Ontario legislation (Bill 81, Schedule H), passed in 2006, sets the length of terms in office for all municipal elected officials at four years.

Campaigns in major cities 
In Toronto, their municipal election had incumbent mayor David Miller easily defeating councillor Jane Pitfield and former Liberal Party president Stephen LeDrew.

Ottawa's election race was a heated affair with incumbent mayor Bob Chiarelli finishing third behind victorious businessman Larry O'Brien and popular former councillor Alex Munter.

In London, incumbent mayor Anne Marie DeCicco-Best defeated Liberal MP Joe Fontana. In Mississauga, Hazel McCallion, who has been mayor since 1978 faced little competition en route to victory.
