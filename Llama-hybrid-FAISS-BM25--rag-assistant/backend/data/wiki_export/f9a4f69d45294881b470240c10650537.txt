The Romanian Special Operations Forces Command () is the special forces command of the Romanian Army formed on 01 March 2018 from the former 6th Special Operations Brigade. The Special Forces Command is headquartered in Târgu Mureș, and it is the structure through which the Chief of the General Staff exercises the control over all Special Forces units.

History 

In the late 1990s, the Romanian Armed Forces considered the possibility of creating a unified special operations force. The Romanian Joint Chiefs of Staff had discussions in which they sought to decide whether to keep the existing orders of battle of elite units incorporated into each separate category of forces (ground forces, the air force and the navy), or to create a new, integrated unit. They decided on the latter plan, especially considering the (at that time) future integration of Romania into NATO.

Rapid changes took place soon after the September 11, 2001 attacks, when the decision was made to create this new unit.

Selection started in 2003. Four allied nations—the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel, and Turkey—advised in the selection process, incorporating their experience into the new SOF battalion – Batalionul 1 Operații Speciale "Vulturii". On 1 August 2009, Regimentul 1 Operații Speciale (1st Special Operations Regiment) was established.

In preparation for the creation of the military unit, several elite units were disbanded. These included the 119th Recon Battalion in Oradea, the 56th Para battalion in Caracal–Deveselu, the 64th Para battalion at Titu–Boteni, and the 62nd para battalion in Câmpia Turzii. All but the last were elite units that participated in a large number of international exercises, as well as deployments abroad.

In 2017, it was announced that the Romanian Army was going to form a Special Forces Command in order to expand joint operations across air, land and maritime forces. On 1 March 2018, on the occasion of the Special Operations Forces Day, the Special Operations Forces Command was established in the Târgu Mureș garrison. The 6th Special Operations Brigade was officially transformed into the Special Forces Command on 25 October 2018. On the same day, it received its battle flag.

Batalionul 1 Operații Speciale "Vulturii", nowadays Batalionul 51 Operații Speciale "Vulturii" (51st Special Operations Battalion Vulturii) was created on 1 March 2003. Battalion became operational in late 2005, after several batches of graduates had already been selected. Members of the SOF battalion have benefitted from courses abroad, such as the US Army Special Forces course, the Force Recon course of the United States Marine Corps, as well as other courses. The US Army Special Forces also sent several instructors who were stationed in Romania for periods of up to 6 months at a time. The Turkish Special Forces were also heavily involved in advising on the selection process, due to the high number of exercises previously held in common with various units in Romania. The United Kingdom and Israel also sent instructors, although it is unclear from which units they came.

Special operations battalion became fully operational in 2007, with a company having been already active since 2006. Elements of the battalion were deployed in Afghanistan. A notable casualty of this deployment was Captain (posthumously Major) Tiberius-Marcel Petre, who was killed in a firefight. He was posthumously awarded the Order of the Star of Romania and the U.S. Bronze Star Medal.

Asked if members of the unit will take part in real missions abroad, the former Minister of National Defense Teodor Atanasiu replied "with certainty".
