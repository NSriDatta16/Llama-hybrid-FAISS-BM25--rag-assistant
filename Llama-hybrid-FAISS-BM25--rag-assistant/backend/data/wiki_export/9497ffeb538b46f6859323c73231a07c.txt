This is the timeline of the development of the Eurofighter Typhoon, a multirole fighter aircraft manufactured by a consortium of European aerospace manufacturers, Eurofighter GmbH, formed in 1983.

1970s
 1972
 Royal Air Force (RAF) issues Air Staff Target 396 (AST-396), a requirement for a STOVL aircraft to replace the Harrier and Jaguar fleets.
 AST-403, specification revised for an air superiority fighter. STOVL requirement dropped and AST-409 lead to the development of Harrier GR5.
 Mid-1970s
 France, Germany and the UK initiate the European Combat Aircraft (ECA) programme.
 1979
 Following differing requirements (particularly French requirement for carrier compatibility,) BAe and MBB propose the European Combat Fighter (ECF)

1980s
 1981
 Development of different national prototypes and continued differences over specification lead to cancellation of ECF programme.
 Panavia partners (Germany, Italy and UK) launch Agile Combat Aircraft (ACA) programme. Following failure of Germany and Italy to fund development the UK MoD pays Â£80m prototype, the Experimental Aircraft Programme (EAP).
 1983
 May - contract for production of EAP prototype signed.
 The UK, France, Germany, Italy and Spain launch Future European Fighter Aircraft (F/EFA) programme. Aircraft to have short take off and landing (STOL) and beyond visual range (BVR) capabilities.
 1984
 France reiterates requirement for carrier capable version. The UK, Germany and Italy opt out and establish new EFA programme.
 1985
 France officially withdraws, commences ACX project.
 27 October - EAP demonstrator rolled out at BAe Warton.
 1986
 June - Eurofighter GmbH established.
 8 August - EAP makes its first flight, piloted by David Eagles. Configuration closely matches final Eurofighter design.
 Rolls-Royce, MTU Aero Engines, FiatAvio (now Avio) and ITP form EuroJet Turbo GmbH for development of EJ200.
 1988
 23 November - contracts signed for production of demonstrator engines and airframes.

1990s
 1990
 EuroRADAR formed for development of ECR-90 (CAPTOR) radar.
 1991
 1 May - last flight of EAP demonstrator.
 1992
 EuroDASS formed for development of defensive aids sub system (DASS.) Initially only UK and Italy participate. When Eurofighter enters service only RAF aircraft will exploit all capabilities of DASS.
 July - Germany announces intention to withdraw from the DASS element. Negotiations begin to reduce costs. As a single engine aircraft is ruled out Germany decides to fit cheaper systems, e.g., F/A-18's APG-65 in place of ECR-90, and delay its service entry by two years. Germany eventually participates in all systems.
 December - renamed Eurofighter 2000.
 1994
 27 March - maiden flight of first development aircraft, DA1 from DASA at Manching with Rolls Royce Spey engines.
 6 April - maiden flight of second development aircraft, DA2 from BAe Warton. DA2 also flew with RB199s.
 1995
 4 June - maiden flight of Italian DA3, the first with EJ200 engines.
 1996

 24 February - maiden flight of German DA5, first aircraft to be fitted with ECR-90.
 14 March - maiden flight of UK's DA4, the second two-seater and last of the seven development aircraft.
 1998
 January - first aerial refuelling trials, involving DA2 and an RAF VC10 tanker.
 30 January - NETMA and Eurofighter GmbH sign production and support contracts for 620 aircraft.
 September - "Typhoon" name adopted, announced as strictly for export contracts. There is some controversy as the last aircraft to bear the name was the Hawker Typhoon, a World War II aircraft.
 18 December - Tranche 1 contract signed.
 1999
 Eurofighter International established as single contracting-management company to handle all export sales.

2000s
 2000
 8 March - first export sale, 60 ordered and 30 options by Greece (but delayed, maybe cancelled).
 16 May - UK commits to MBDA Meteor BVRAAM, leading to significant benefits for export prospects.

 2002
 5 April - Instrumented Production Aircraft (IPA2) makes maiden flight from Turin.
 11 April - IPA 3 makes maiden flight from EADS Military Aircraft, Manching, Germany.

 2 July - Austria announces acquisition of 24 Typhoons, later reduced to 18.
 23 July - "Typhoon" name officially adopted as in-service name by four partner nations.
 21 November - DA6, flying out of Getafe, crashes. Twin engine failure is blamed.

 14 February - in the space of just over an hour Italy's IT001 and Britain's BT001 make their maiden flights.
 17 February - Spain's ST001 flies from EADS Military Aircraft, Getafe, Spain.
