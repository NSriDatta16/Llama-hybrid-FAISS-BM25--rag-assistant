Teachers 

Notable teachers at the school include John Howard Amundsen who taught the subjects of manual arts, media and business. Amundsen gained notoriety in May 2006, after a stockpile of explosives and detonators were found in his home which caused the school to be evacuated and searched. On 10 May 2006, the school was closed for most of the morning as police with sniffer dogs checked classrooms, before they declared it safe for students and staff to resume lessons. In a Brisbane court on 11 May 2006, he was charged with fraudulently obtaining 53 kg of the explosive substance Powergel. He was subsequently charged with preparing a terrorist act, as well as two counts of making a threat and making a hoax threat. In February 2007, the charges of terrorism and making a hoax threat were dropped but replaced with new charges of possessing incendiary devices and having dangerous goods in a vehicle.

Grounds and facilities

There are only two buildings that are not single story, and this demonstrates the contrast of Ferny Grove SHS from the typical hospital-style campuses of other Brisbane Secondary Schools such as St Laurence's College and Brisbane State High School.
