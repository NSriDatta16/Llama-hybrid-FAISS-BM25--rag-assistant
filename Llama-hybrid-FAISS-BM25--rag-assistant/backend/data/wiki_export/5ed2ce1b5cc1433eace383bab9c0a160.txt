Course
Wyalusing Creek begins in at the mouths of East Branch Wyalusing Creek and South Branch Wyalusing Creek in Rush Township, Susquehanna County. The creek begins meandering west for a few miles before picking up the tributary North Branch Wyalusing Creek and turning southwest. It almost immediately crosses Pennsylvania Route 706 and soon afterwards, it leaves Rush Township and Susquehanna County.

Upon leaving Susquehanna County, Wyslusing Creek enters Stevens Township, Bradford County. It turns northwest briefly and receives the tributary Ross Creek before turning southwest again. After some distance, it picks up the tributary Rockwell Creek and continues southwest. The creek gradually begins turning west and passes Stevensville. Shortly afterwards, it abruptly turns south and enters Tuscarora Township. It then turns west and reenters Stevens Township for a few hundred feet before bending back into Tuscarora Township. A few tenths of a mile later, the creek leaves Tuscarora Township and enters Wyalusing Township. In this township, the creek turns south-southwest and then turns west, passing the community of Camptown. There, it picks up the tributaries Camps Creek and Billings Creek before turning south and receiving the tributary Patton Creek. The creek continues south for several miles, passing the community of Merryall and crossing Pennsylvania Route 706. It then turns roughly south-southwest and begins to flow parallel to Pennsylvania Route 706. After a few miles, the creek enters the community of Wyalusing. In this community, it crosses U.S. Route 6 and shortly afterwards reaches its confluence with the Susquehanna River.
