Heng is a letter of the Latin alphabet, originating as a typographic ligature of h and ŋ. It is used for a voiceless y-like sound, such as in Dania transcription of the Danish language.

It was used word-finally in early transcriptions of Mayan languages, where it may have represented a uvular fricative.

It is sometimes used to write Judeo-Tat. 

It has been occasionally used by phonologists to represent a hypothetical phoneme in English, which includes both  and  as its allophones, to illustrate the limited usefulness of minimal pairs to distinguish phonemes. Normally  and  are considered separate phonemes in English, even though a minimal pair for them cannot be constructed, due to their complementary distribution.

It is also used in Bantu linguistics to indicate a voiced alveolar lateral fricative ().

Both  and  are encoded in Unicode block Latin Extended-D; they were added with Unicode version 5.1 in April 2008.
