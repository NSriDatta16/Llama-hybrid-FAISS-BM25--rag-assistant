History

Initial foundation
In 1974-75 the University of Sindh with its solitary campus in Jamshoro could not keep pace with the growing need of the Sindh Province for higher education. Another campus was therefore set up at Khairpur Mirs, named after the national poet of Sindh, Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai. The campus was meant to provide higher education facilities in various modern and scientific fields to the people in the northern part of the Province of Sindh, which had a rich tradition of producing highly educated and intelligent people.

Full university status
In 1986, the Sindh provincial assembly passed an act to make the campus a full-fledged and independent university.  The act came into force in 1987, making the university functional, under then-Chief Minister Ghous Ali Shah. Its campus covers an area of  of lush green lawns, playgrounds and trees. The landscape includes three canals nearby which serve as picnic spots for the students and the faculty. The university has over 4,000 students in various programmes.
