Briscoe Group is a New Zealand retail chain. It has 92 stores throughout New Zealand trading under the Briscoes Homeware (48) and Rebel Sport (44) nameplates.

History 

In 1781, the predecessor of the modern company was founded in Wolverhampton, England. Initially a retailer of hardware, over the course of the 19th century it steadily expanded into the British colonies in Australia and New Zealand. The first New Zealand-based Briscoes warehouse and shop was established in 1862 on the corner of Princes and Jetty Streets in Dunedin. Its New Zealand business was initially aimed at supplying prospecting hardware (including shovels, picks, tents and lanterns) during the Otago gold rush. By the beginning of the First World War, Briscoes had offices in London, Sydney, Melbourne and throughout New Zealand. In addition to hardware and building supplies, the company also acted as an agent for skilled tradesmen, such as carpenters and masons, and also sold household items such as crockery and cutlery.

Nameplates

Briscoes 

Briscoes or Briscoes Homeware is a retail store selling a variety of homeware at sometimes heavily discounted prices. It is comparable in size to a medium size discount department store. Many brands are exclusively imported by Briscoes, allowing for such low prices. Briscoes Homeware is the flagship brand of the Group and generates most of the company's revenue. Currently there are 45 stores trading throughout New Zealand. The brand's slogan is "You'll never buy better", referring to Briscoes Homeware's 'Price Promise' that states the store will match and beat by 10% any price found on a stocked item at another retailer.

Tammy Wells, a farmer and former radio journalist from Canterbury, has fronted Briscoes' television advertising campaigns since 1989. She is known to New Zealanders as "The Briscoes Lady".

Rebel Sport 

Rebel Sport is the largest sport equipment and apparel chain in New Zealand, with 38 stores currently trading. It was born out of a franchise agreement between Briscoe Group and Rebel Sport Australia in 1995. After successfully overseeing the expansion of the Briscoes Homeware stores from 12 to 22, then company director, Brian Berry, was given the task of overseeing the design and establishment of the Rebel Sport chain of stores in New Zealand. Briscoe has exclusive rights to the Rebel Sport name in New Zealand.

Like its sister nameplate Briscoes, Rebel Sport is comparable in size to a medium size discount department store. The chain does have a lowest price guarantee, although its unique duopoly position in the market allows it to stock a relatively high-end range while providing wider appeal through a calendar crammed with discount sale promotions.

In 2005, a deal collapsed between Briscoe Group and Lane Walker Rudkin (LWR), owners of Stirling Sports, which would have seen Briscoe buy Stirling Sports. Following this, LWR announced plans to launch several large-format stores across the country, beginning with a store in Christchurch, which it opened in mid-2006.

After Stirling's large-format launch, Rebel dropped their original slogan, "No one's got more sports gear", and replaced it with "Let's Play", beginning a new marketing campaign targeting a wider audience from their traditional club-orientated team sport audience. The company continued their aggressive expansion programme, launching several smaller-format stores such as Napier and Taupo to allow branches to reach further into provincial areas.

Briscoe Group previously owned the New Zealand naming rights to the Super Rugby rugby union competition, which was branded the Rebel Sport Super 14.
