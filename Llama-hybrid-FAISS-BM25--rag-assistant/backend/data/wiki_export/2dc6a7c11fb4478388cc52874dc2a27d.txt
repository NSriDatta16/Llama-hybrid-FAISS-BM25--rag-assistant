Mirages is the third studio album by Canadian electronic music musician Tim Hecker, released on September 21, 2004 on Alien8 Recordings. It is described on the Alien8 website as "an ambient-death-metal classic in waiting." The album is composed primarily of heavily distorted and processed guitar.

The track "The Truth of Accountants" is a reference to the philosophy of director Werner Herzog. In 1999, Herzog made a declaration at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, writing, "By dint of declaration the so-called  is devoid of . It reaches a merely superficial truth, the truth of accountants.". Herzog continues to use this phrase to distance himself from the idea that facts create truth.
