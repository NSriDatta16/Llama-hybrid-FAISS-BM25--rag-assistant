History
Kallen Esperian was born on June 8, 1961 in Waukegan, Illinois. She was named after her Armenian grandfather, Kalouste, who escape Armenia from Turkish invasion. Her birth father died of a heart attack when she was eleven months old. After her mother remarried, she moved to Barrington, Illinois. She began ballet lessons when she was three years old and soon picked up voice and piano lessons.

Esperian received a full scholarship to study opera at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. During her freshman year, she performed her first opera, The Magic Flute.

Before graduating, she entered the Luciano Pavarotti International Voice Competition and won the competition and a scholarship in 1985. In 1986, she made her debut in Philadelphia as Mimi in La bohème opposite Pavarotti and subsequently appeared in the film Distant Harmony while in China with Pavarotti. Since then she has sung at most of the world's important opera houses, specializing in Italian opera, particularly in Verdi roles.

Esperian has appeared with Pavarotti in his annual concert, Pavarotti Plus, in 1991 at Lincoln Center and in 1995 at the Royal Albert Hall in London.
