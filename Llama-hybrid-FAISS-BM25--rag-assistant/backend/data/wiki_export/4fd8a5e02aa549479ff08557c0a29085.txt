Name 
There are many different theories regarding the origination of the name Hwamyeong. The most reliable theory is that Mt. Geumjeong, the mountain surrounding Hwamyeong, was once called Mt. Hwa, or Hwasan. This names derives from the mountain being described as an ideal or bright place, and since the Chinese letter for ideal is pronounced 'myeong' in Korean, the name Hwamyeong thus refers to an "ideal bright place." Another theory is that the district's original name was Hwe-Bulgi, which means 'bright sun' or 'red sun'. The literal translation of Hwamyeong, as it is currently spelled, is 'brightly shining,' and is derived from Chinese characters. This name was first attached to the region in 1914, during the period of Japanese rule.  At that time, it was known as Hwamyeong-ri, a subdivision of Gupo-myeon.  In 1963, it became a dong under the administration of Busanjin-gu.  In 1978, it was transferred to Buk-gu, of which it remained a unitary part until its division in 2003.
