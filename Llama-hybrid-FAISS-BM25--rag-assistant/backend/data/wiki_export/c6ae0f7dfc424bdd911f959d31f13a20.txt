The Stichometry of Nicephorus is a stichometry by Patriarch Nicephorus I of Constantinople (c. 758-828). It is significant in that it counts the number of lines of various Christian texts, many of which have been lost over the course of time. This has enabled modern scholars to determine how much of various fragmentary texts from the New Testament apocrypha and Old Testament apocrypha remain missing.

Notably for the area of canon studies, this ninth-century stichometry contains a categorization of books including the Revelation of John, the Revelation of Peter, the Epistle of Barnabas, and the Gospel of the Hebrews all on the same list of "disputed" New Testament works (antilegomena).
