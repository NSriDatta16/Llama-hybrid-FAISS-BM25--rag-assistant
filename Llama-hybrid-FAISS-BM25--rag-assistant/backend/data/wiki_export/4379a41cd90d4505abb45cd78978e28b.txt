Charles Colyear, 2nd Earl of Portmore, KT (27 August 1700 – 5 July 1785), known as Lord Milsington to 1730, of Portmore House, Weybridge, Surrey, was a British Whig politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1726 and 1730, when he succeeded to the peerage as Earl of Portmore. He subsequently became a Scottish representative peer in the House of Lords. He was a racehorse owner and was known as Beau Colyear for his conspicuous dress.

Early life
Colyear was the son of David Colyear, 1st Earl of Portmore and his wife Catherine Sedley, Countess of Dorchester, daughter of Sir Charles Sedley, 5th Baronet, MP, of Aylesford, Kent, and former mistress of James II. His mother was the owner of Portmore House, Weybridge, which became the seat of the Earls of Portmore. In 1719, he was page to the Princess of Wales.

Career
Milsington was returned as Member of Parliament for Wycombe on the Wharton interest at a by-election on 1 February 1726 but on account of the partiality of the returning officer, the election was declared void on 22 February.

At the 1727 British general election he was returned as MP Andover in a contest. He voted with the Administration on the civil list arrears in 1729.

On 2 January 1730 Milsington succeeded to the peerage on the death of his father and vacated his seat in the House of Commons.
