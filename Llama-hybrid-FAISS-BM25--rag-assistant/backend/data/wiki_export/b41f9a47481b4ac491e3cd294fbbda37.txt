The Obliterati is the third studio album by American post-punk band Mission of Burma, released in May 2006 by record label Matador.

Recording
In September 2005, Mission of Burma began recording their third studio album. The album was produced by Bob Weston.

Release
The Obliterati was released on May 23, 2006 on Matador Records.

In February 2006, 500 fans signed up for a Mission of Burma singles club, which was intended to deliver, on a weekly basis, eight one-sided 12" vinyl singles and CD singles, with the vinyl singles coming out first and their CD counterparts arriving a couple of weeks afterward. Various manufacturing delays, however, forced Matador to release all eight CD singles simultaneously as a set, with the vinyl versions delivered to subscribers around the time The Obliterati arrived in stores. The "blank" sides of the vinyl singles, and the front cover and screenprinted sides of the CDs, feature etched artwork from artist Shepard Fairey (of "André the Giant Has a Posse" infamy).

Reception
The album received a positive response from critics, and was named the 33rd best album of 2006 by Pitchfork.
