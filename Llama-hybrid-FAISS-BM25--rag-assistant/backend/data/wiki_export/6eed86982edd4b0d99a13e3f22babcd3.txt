Kakori was a centre for Urdu poetry, literature and the Qadiriya Qalandari Sufi order. On 9 August 1925,  Indian revolutionaries robbed a train of government funds in Kakori, an incident known as the Kakori Train robbery.

History 
In the last days of the 11th century, Kakori was ruled by Raja Kansa of Kasmandi (Kansamdap) near Malihabad, who was a Rajpasi by caste. At that time there was a colony of Bhars here.

When Syed Salar Masood Ghazi came to Kakori from Delhi, Raja Kansa fought with him. Kansa was defeated in this battle and this town came into the hands of the Muslims.

However, when the dominance of the Muslims decreased, once again the Bhars started living here. Till the 12th century, this place was under the empire of Bharon.

In 1202, Qutbuddin Aibak sent Muhammad Bakhtyar Khilji as Hakim Sardar Lashkar. When he passed through Lakhanpur to take up the governorship of the east, he established Bakhtiyar Nagar near Kakori and left some of his Pathani companions there.

These people started calling Lakhanpur, Lucknow. Sultan Shamsuddin Altamash sent Malik Nasiruddin here to suppress the increasing power of the Bhars, who defeated the Bhars in the war and established the rule of Delhi here.

Then till the last time of Muhammad bin Tughluq, Delhi's suzerainty remained on it. In the 13th century, King Kakor of Bharon built the fort of Kakori around which people started living.
