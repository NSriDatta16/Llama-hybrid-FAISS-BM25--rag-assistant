Commercial performance
The album reached number four on the US Billboard 200 chart, number one on the R&B Albums chart (for four weeks) and number two on the UK Albums Chart, where it was kept off the top spot by the albums Now That's What I Call Music 3 and David Bowie's Tonight. Wonder's albums Songs in the Key of Life and Hotter than July also reached number two in the UK and to date he has failed to achieve a number-one album there. However, the single "I Just Called to Say I Love You", taken from The Woman in Red, was a massive hit in the UK, reaching number one and becoming the second best-selling single of 1984 (only behind Band Aid's "Do They Know It's Christmas?") and the third most successful single of the entire 1980s there.
