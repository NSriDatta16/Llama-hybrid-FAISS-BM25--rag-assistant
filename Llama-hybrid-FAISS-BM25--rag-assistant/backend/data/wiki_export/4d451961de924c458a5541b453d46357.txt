South Africa is a diverse country with 12 official languages, and many citizens will speak two or more languages. It is very common to mix languages in casual conversations, on social media, or in music lyrics.

This is a list of commonly used terms and phases across Southern Africa per the United Nations geoscheme for Africa, including mainly South Africa and the neighbouring countries of Botswana, eSwatini (formerly Swaziland), Lesotho, and Namibia. From a linguistic perspective, the Eastern African countries of Mozambique and Zimbabwe are typically included, as well.

Curse words and slurs 
South Africa is a country formed from centuries of immigrants, settlers, and colonisers. It has a long history of using racial slurs or derogatory phrases when speaking of the other. Some such words have more recently been reclaimed as a mark of pride and defiance (for example, coloured).

"Voetsek", or simply "tsek", is a fun way of telling someone to "fuck off". This is also used to scare unwanted animals away.

"Jou Ma se gat" or "Jou Ma se poes" is a derogatory phrase that literally translates to "Your Mom's hole" or "Your Mom's vagina". This is often seen as more aggressive than the aforementioned phrase "voetsek".

South African Jewish slang 
 chattis, khateis (plural chatteisim, khateisim. Yiddish: "a sinner"): approximately equivalent to "white trash". The word refers particularly to poor, white, Afrikaans-speaking communities with endemic social problems. Sometimes used as an ethnic slur against Afrikaners in general. From Talmudic phrase  Eyn bor yerey khet – a bor – (uncouth ignoramus) is not afraid of sin. The bor-Boer assonance gives a case for quibble: if not afraid of sin must be therefore a sinner.
 kugel: an overly groomed, materialistic woman (from the Yiddish word for a plain pudding garnished as a delicacy). Older-generation Jews coined this usage as a derogatory label for Jewish women who aspired to become part of the privileged English-speaking white community.  usage, often humorously intended, applies the word to any nouveau riche women in South African society who appear overly groomed and materialistic. Bagel and bagel-boy occur as labels for the male counterpart of the kugel. (Compare the American-English term Jewish-American princess which has subtly differing connotations.)
 Peruvian / Peruvnik: a low-class, unmannered and unsophisticated person regardless of wealth, usually Jewish. The etymology is unclear. (Theories: (a) Yiddish corruption of Parvenu; (b) derives from an acronym for "Polish and Russian Union", supposedly a Jewish club founded in Kimberley in the 1870s, according to Bradford's Dictionary of South African English.) The more assimilated and established Jews from Germany and England looked down on this group, and their descendants remain stigmatised.
 Schwarzer: Yiddish / German for "black" – a black person
 shiksa: as in other Jewish communities, this means "non-Jewish girl". Traditionally "slave-girl", from the Yiddish version of the Hebrew word for "dirty, unclean, loathsome" In South Africa, however, it has the additional meaning of a "female domestic worker".
 weisser: Yiddish for "white" – a white person

 bint: from the Lebanese word for "girl"; used in reference to women in general (as in "check out that hot bint over there.")

 khara: from the Lebanese word for "faeces" or "dung"; refers to something that is crap (as in "that guy is talking khara!")
 ghei: literally translated from the Lebanese word for "brother"; in colloquial South African refers to "a tinted-windows, lots-of-jewellery" kinda guy (pronounced like gHAY but with a /x/, like a guttural "g" or the "ch" in Scottish loch)
