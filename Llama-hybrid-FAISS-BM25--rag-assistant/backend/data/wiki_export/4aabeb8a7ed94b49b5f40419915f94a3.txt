Mark Alan Stuart (born April 14, 1968) is an American missionary and former Christian rock musician, singer and songwriter best known as the lead vocalist for the Christian rock band Audio Adrenaline during their original run from 1986 to 2007. Mark has won 2 Grammy Awards and has been nominated for 6.

Audio Adrenaline

Mark Stuart met the original guitarist and bassist for Audio Adrenaline, Barry Blair and Will McGinniss, while attending Kentucky Christian College (now known as Kentucky Christian University). Barry Blair was Mark's roommate for three years. They founded the band in 1986 under the name of A-180. However, they temporarily disbanded the next year when Mark went to Haiti for a semester. When he returned to Kentucky, the band reformed and recruited Bob Herdman, who brought them two songs to record. After they did, they changed their name to Audio Adrenaline and signed a deal with Forefront Records. After more than twenty years of success with the band and eight studio albums, Stuart decided to retire in January 2006. The primary reason cited was Stuart's "ongoing vocal challenges" stemming from vocal cord damage caused by a disorder known as spasmodic dysphonia.

After Audio Adrenaline

Stuart and Will McGinniss of Audio Adrenaline started a project called Know Hope Collective. The project features a changing group of musicians that sing worship songs and present testimonies.

Personal life

Stuart married Kerri McKeehan, sister of TobyMac, in 1995. The two later divorced. He and his second wife, Aegis, have two adopted children originally from Haiti.

Missionary work

Stuart has visited Haiti consistently to help with missionary efforts. Stuart and McGinniss started the Hands and Feet Project, a nonprofit charity that funds orphanages in Haiti, in 2003.

On January 12, 2010, Stuart, his parents, and his wife Aegis were working at the Hands and Feet Project in Jacmel, Haiti when the earthquake struck Port-au-Prince.  None at the Project were injured by the quake, and Stuart was interviewed by media outlets such as CNN, MSNBC and BBC, among others. He assisted with relief efforts in Jacmel until returning to the U.S. on January 22, when he continued to assist by raising funds through continued coordination of relief efforts and organization of benefit concerts.
