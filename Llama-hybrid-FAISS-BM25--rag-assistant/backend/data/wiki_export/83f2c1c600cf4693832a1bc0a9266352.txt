Fame and Wealth is an album by the American musician Loudon Wainwright III, released in 1983.

Critical reception

The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote that Wainwright "attacks the guitar instead of plucking its strings, and while he's capable of crooning warmly, his standard tone of voice is a strangled yowl."
