Haplogroup F is a human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroup. The clade is most common in East Asia and Southeast Asia. It has not been found among Native Americans.

It is a primary branch of haplogroup R9.

Distribution
The F haplogroup is fairly common in East Asia. High frequencies of the clade are found among the Lahu from Yunnan (33% - 77%, average 52%), Nicobar Islands (50%), Shors from Kemerovo Oblast of Siberia (41%), and Arunachal Pradesh, India (31%). There is also an important frequency in Taiwanese aborigines, Khakas, Kets, Han Chinese (and, thus, nearly all of China), Lombok, Sumba, Thailand, and Vietnam. Its distribution extends with low frequency to the Tharu of southern Nepal and the Bashkirs of the southern Urals.

Haplogroup F also occurs at low frequencies on the Comoros Islands (<10%).
It is also found at low frequencies on The Hvar island in Croatia (8.3%).

Subclades

F1a clearly predominates among the representatives of haplogroup F in Southeast Asia, but subclades of this haplogroup have been found in populations as far north as the Buryats and Ulchi of Siberia.

F1b tends to become more frequent as a fraction of total F in populations of the northern parts of East Asia and Central Asia, such as Mongols, Kazakhs, Uyghurs, and Japanese. It also has been found among the Yi people. There are odd exclaves of F1b in Gaininsk Bashkirs of Perm Oblast and Croats of Hvar Island.

F1d is the second most frequent sub-clade in Newar (Nepal). Haplogroup F1d reaches the greatest proportion in Newar (11.97%) of Nepal and Kshatriya (16%) of North India. 
 
F2 has been found mainly in the form of F2a, which has been observed in more than 10% of a couple samples of Nu and Lisu from Gongshan, Yunnan. F2 has been found with frequencies exceeding 5% in several other populations of Southwest China, Guangxi, and Hainan, including the Han majority population. Outside of southwestern China, F2 has been found with frequency greater than 5% in a sample of Oirat Mongols from Xinjiang and a sample of Khakas from Khakassia, with the former population boasting particularly high diversity within this clade.

F3 is especially common among Austronesian peoples of Taiwan and the Malay Archipelago, but it also has been found in many populations of Southwest China and South-Central China, and in a sample of Hans from Xinjiang.

F4 has been found mainly in aboriginal populations of Taiwan and Hainan, with some representatives among samples of Filipinos from Luzon, Indonesians from Sumatra, and Hans and Uzbeks from Xinjiang.
