Marshfield Clinic Health System is an integrated health system serving Wisconsin founded in 1916. The system contains several hospitals and many clinics throughout Wisconsin, as well as a medical research institute and an education division, and employs more than 1,200 doctors and other clinicians.

History
The clinic was founded in 1916 by six local physicians: K.W. Doege, William Hipke, Victor Mason, Walter G. Sexton, H.H. Milbee, and Roy P. Potter, in the community of Marshfield, Wisconsin.  In October 2022, Essentia Health and Marshfield Clinic Health System announced merger discussions. A Memorandum of Understanding was signed to evaluate how the two organizations might combine to form an integrated regional health system.

Organization
Marshfield Clinic Health System's primary operations include facilities in Marshfield, Eau Claire, Wausau/Weston, and Rice Lake. As of 2022, the health system has 10 hospitals (including two in Marshfield) and 50-60 clinics throughout Wisconsin.
