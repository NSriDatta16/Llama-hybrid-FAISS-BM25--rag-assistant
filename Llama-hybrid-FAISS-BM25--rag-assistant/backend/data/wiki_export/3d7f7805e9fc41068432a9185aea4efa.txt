Nuclear power plants operate in 32 countries and generate about a tenth of the world's electricity. 
Most are in Europe, North America, East Asia and South Asia.
The United States is the largest producer of nuclear power, while France has the largest share of electricity generated by nuclear power, at about 70%. 
China has the fastest growing nuclear power programme with 16 new reactors under construction, followed by India, which has 8 under construction.

Some countries operated nuclear reactors in the past but have no operating nuclear plants. 
Among them, Italy closed all of its nuclear stations by 1990 and nuclear power has since been discontinued because of the 1987 referendums.
Kazakhstan is planning to reintroduce nuclear power in the future. Belarus began operating one unit of its first nuclear power plant in June 2021 and was expecting to bring the second unit into operation in 2023.

Germany completed the shut down of its nuclear fleet on April 15, 2023 and any restart has been ruled out on technical grounds. Austria (Zwentendorf Nuclear Power Plant) and the Philippines (Bataan Nuclear Power Plant) never started to use their first nuclear plants that were completely built.

Sweden and Belgium originally had phase-out policies however they have now moved away from their original plans. The Philippines relaunched their nuclear programme on February 28, 2022 and may soon operate the mothballed Bataan Plant.

Due to financial, political and technical reasons, Cuba, Libya and Poland never completed the construction of their first nuclear plants, and Australia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Ghana, Ireland, Kuwait, Oman, Peru and Singapore never built their planned first nuclear plants. Some of these countries are still planning to introduce nuclear power. As of 2020, Poland was in advanced planning phase for 1.5 GW and planned to have up to 9 GW by 2040. 
Hong Kong has no nuclear power plants within its boundary, but imports 80% of the electricity generated from Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station located across the border, in which the power company of the territory holds stake. In 2021, Iraq declared it was planning to build 8 nuclear reactors by 2030 to supply up to 25% electric power in a grid that was suffering from shortages.

Overview 

Of the 32 countries in which nuclear power plants operate, only France, Slovakia, Ukraine and Belgium use them as the source for a majority of the country's electricity supply as of 2021. Other countries have significant amounts of nuclear power generation capacity. By far the largest nuclear electricity producers are the United States with 772,221 GWh of nuclear electricity in 2022, followed by China with 395,354 GWh. As of 2022, 401 reactors with a net capacity of 361,144 MWe were operational, and 57 reactors with net capacity of 59,091 MWe were under construction. Of the reactors under construction, 21 reactors with 21,608 MWe were in China and 8 reactors with a capacity of 6,028 MWe were in India.
