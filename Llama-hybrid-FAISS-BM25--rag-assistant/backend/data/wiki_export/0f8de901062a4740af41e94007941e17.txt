Hillerød station () is a railway station serving the city of Hillerød north of Copenhagen, Denmark. It is the terminus of four railways lines:
 An S-train line (Nordbanen) from Copenhagen, operated by DSB
 Frederiksværkbanen, operated by Lokaltog
 Gribskovbanen, operated by Lokaltog
 Lille Nord towards Helsingør, operated by Lokaltog

Though there are track connections between the four railways, they are seldom used; each has its own dedicated dead-end platform tracks.

The bus terminal in front of the station is a major hub for transportation throughout northeastern Zealand.
