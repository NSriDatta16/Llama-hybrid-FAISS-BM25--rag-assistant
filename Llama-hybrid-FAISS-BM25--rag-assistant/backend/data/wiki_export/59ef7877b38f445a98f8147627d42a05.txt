Carry On Henry is a 1971 British historical comedy film, the 21st release in the series of 31 Carry On films (1958–1992). It tells a fictionalised story involving Sid James as Henry VIII, who chases after Barbara Windsor's character Bettina. James and Windsor feature alongside other regulars Kenneth Williams, Charles Hawtrey, Joan Sims, Terry Scott and Kenneth Connor. This was the first time that Williams and Connor appeared together since Carry On Cleo seven years previously. The original alternative title was to be Anne of a Thousand Lays, a pun on the Richard Burton film Anne of the Thousand Days, and Sid James wears exactly the same cloak that Burton wore in that film. Harry Secombe was considered for Henry VIII when it appeared that Sid James may not be available due to possible stage commitments. James was making a lengthy appearance in South Africa which was cut down when he heard he was wanted for the film and arrived back in time for the second day of shooting.

The promotional tagline, "A Great Guy With His Chopper," was inspired by the rapidly increasing popularity of modified motorcycles for which the slang term chopper was coined.

The opening theme is a version of "Greensleeves", as arranged by Eric Rogers. The film was followed by Carry On At Your Convenience 1971.

Casting and characterisation
Sid James plays Henry VIII as a lovable rogue who is surrounded by scheming courtiers. Peter Rogers originally planned on using Harry Secombe in the title role, and in the first draft of the screenplay Henry was going to be an avid composer of madrigals, but the idea was shelved and Sid James took over the role. Two comedic madrigals written for the film but unused were later performed in the 1972 Carry On Christmas special and the 1973 stage show Carry On London.

Plot
The film opens with a passage, which states:

This film is based on a recently discovered manuscript by one William Cobbler, which reveals that Henry VIII did in fact have two more wives. Although it was first thought that Cromwell originated the story, it is now known to be definitely all Cobbler's... from beginning to end.

Henry VIII has his wife beheaded and quickly marries Marie of Normandy. The union was organised at the behest of bumbling Cardinal Wolsey as Marie is the favourite cousin of King Francis I of France. Before the marriage can be consummated, Marie eats a clove of garlic, claiming it is a Normandy tradition to eat garlic before coitus. Henry is repulsed by the smell and leaves. Marie receives amorous advances from Henry's attaché Sir Roger de Lodgerley, which she accepts.

Henry is keen to be rid of Marie and seizes the opportunity to divorce her when he discovers she is pregnant with Lodgerley's child. He imprisons her in the Tower of London and commands Thomas Cromwell to obtain a confession of paternity from Lodgerley. Marie convinces Wolsey to send for the French ambassador, who tells Henry that Francis I is so thrilled with the successful marriage that he will give England ten thousand gold pieces. This, and the fear that the ambassador will discover Marie's imprisonment, convinces Henry to release Marie; he commands Cromwell to force a retraction of Lodgerley's confession.

Soon afterwards, Henry meets the beautiful Bettina. Bettina is the daughter of the Earl of Bristol, a punning reference to Bristols. Enamoured, Henry renews his attempt to divorce Marie just as Lodgerley signs his retraction, again imprisoning Marie in the Tower. Henry comes so close to achieving the divorce that he sends Bettina to the bridal bedchamber. The handsome King Francis of France arrives on a surprise visit and finds Bettina; finding her to be a suitable wife, he asks Henry if he can marry her. Henry realises that the only way to avoid war with France is to consent. Henry arranges for Cromwell and Wolsey to be executed as a result of their supposed inaction. Charmed by Henry's loyalty, Marie announces that she loves him and goes into labour. Despite not being the biological father, Henry is moved by the birth of the child and promises to serve as a faithful husband and father, though he immediately meets Catherine Howard and resolves to marry her. He rushes to stop the execution of Cromwell and Wolsey, begging for their help in divorcing Marie and ensuring marriage with Howard, but both men cry out 'carry on, executioner!'.
