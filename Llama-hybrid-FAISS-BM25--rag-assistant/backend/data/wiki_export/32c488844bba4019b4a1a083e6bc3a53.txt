Biography 
Vjenceslav Novak grew up in Senj, where he graduated from elementary school and first two grades of gymnasium, from which he would graduate in Gospić. His father was of Czech origin. He moved to Senj before Vjenceslav was born to work as a merchant. He wanted this son to follow his footsteps, but business was of little interest to Vjenceslav.

Vjenceslav moved to Zagreb after graduating where he studied education in order to become a teacher. After finishing his studies, he moved back to Senj where he would spend the next two years working as a teacher. He moved to Prague to study music, graduating in 1897. He returned to Zagreb that same year, where he taught musicology. Soon afterwards, he got the position as the main teacher at a gymnasium in Senj. Around this time, he experienced first symptoms of tuberculosis.

His literary career began in 1881. with a short story titled "Maca" (Translation: "Cat"). He wrote about many subjects, including: musical symposiums, dramas, critiques, poems, short stories and novels. In 1888., he published a Croatian musicology textbook.

Vjenceslav died on 20. September 1905 while preparing his manuscript for printing.
