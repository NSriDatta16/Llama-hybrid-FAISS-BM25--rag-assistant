History
During the Apartheid era, the Southern Suburbs were predominantly "whites only" residential areas.

Geography
Cape Town's Southern Suburbs lie to the Southeast of the slopes of Table Mountain within rich valleys and vast plains reaching from just south of the Table Bay industrial neighbourhoods in the north to the False Bay coastal suburbs and the Cape Peninsula cliffs to the south, and are crossed North-South by the M3 and M5 freeways. In general, this area is identified as being the more affluent of the Cape Town Metropolis' sections and includes some of the city's most expensive residential neighbourhoods.

Commerce
The suburb of Claremont is an important commercial hub in the Southern Suburbs and is the location of several shopping malls. Some of the well-known malls include Cavendish Square and Stadium on Main.

Demographics
The majority of the Southern Suburbs' population are White English-speaking with large minority communities of Black, Indian and Coloured people in some suburbs. Many of the non-Whites are Anglophone and speak English natively. The area has a population of 205,000 people.

Due to the large British descendant population, the area has a bigger pro-Commonwealth and pro-Monarchy (in reference to the British Monarch’s official title as Head of the Commonwealth) sentiment than the rest of the Cape. Because of this, many institutions retained their Royal patronage (such as the Royal Cape Golf Club and the Royal Cape Yacht Club) and there are many institutions related to British heritage in the region (including the Cape Town 1820 Settlers Association, Cape Town Scottish Highlander Pipe Band and Cape Town Scottish Caledonian Pipe Band). The area is also home to the Cecil Rhodes Memorial and is home to many British pubs and tea rooms. 

Due to the region being predominantly White English-South African, it is also home a very large concentration of Anglicans with many Anglican churches and Anglican private schools (most notably the St. George's Grammar School and Bishops Diocesan College).

Education
