No Rest for the Wicked is the second studio album by English rock band New Model Army, released in May 1985. It was the band's first release on major record label EMI, and their last featuring bassist and founding member Stuart Morrow. The album reached #22 in the UK Albums Chart.

A key element on its cover is a quotation from Magna Carta, "To no man will we sell, or deny, or delay right or justice".

Singles
Singles released from the album are "No Rest" and Better Than Them (The Acoustic EP).

Reception

Spin wrote, "Everything they do is full of echo. One can chalk that up to U2-syndrome of mid-80s record production. It's a sock to hear something intelligent and pointed in a release on a major label."

Versions
The album was originally released in the UK in 1985 as an LP. A CD version was subsequently released in 1989.

In 2005 the album was remastered and reissued containing a bonus disc comprising rarities, B-sides and live tracks. Of the live tracks, "Vengeance" was recorded at the Brixton Academy, London on 16 June 1990, "Smalltown England" and "Liberal Education" were recorded during the Impurity Tour in 1990, "Waiting" was recorded at Rock City, Nottingham on 20 April 1987 and "Betcha" was recorded at the Biskuithall, Bonn on 25 October 1988.
