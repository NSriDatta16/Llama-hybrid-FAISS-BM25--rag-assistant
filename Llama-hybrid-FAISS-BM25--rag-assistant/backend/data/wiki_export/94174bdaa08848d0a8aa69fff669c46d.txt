The  Miss Washington USA competition is the pageant that selects the representative for the state of Washington in the Miss USA pageant. It is currently produced by Pageants NW Productions based in Puyallup, Washington since 2002, which also produces Idaho and Oregon state pageants.

Washington has been moderately successful in terms of number of semi-finalists and placements, and has had one Miss USA.  Dorothy Anstett won the crown in 1968 and went on to place 4th runner-up at Miss Universe. The most recent placement was Samantha Gallia in 2023, placing Top 20.

Prior to 2017, no Washington delegate had previously competed at Miss Teen USA, although one has competed at Miss America. Alex Carlson-Helo, Miss Washington Teen USA 2012, became the last state to have made her the first Teen to Miss crossover for the state.

Samantha Gallia of Sacramento, California, residing in Seattle, was crowned Miss Washington USA 2023 on November 13, 2022 at Renton IKEA Performing Arts Center in Renton, Washington. She will represent Washington for the title of Miss USA 2023.
