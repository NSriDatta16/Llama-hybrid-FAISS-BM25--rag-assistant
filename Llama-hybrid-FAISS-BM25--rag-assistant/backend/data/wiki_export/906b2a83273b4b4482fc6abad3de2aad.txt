All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) is a non-governmental organization in India that represents the interests of Muslims in matters of personal law. It was formed in 1973 with the objective of protecting and promoting the application of Islamic personal law among Muslims in India. The AIMPLB is primarily concerned with issues related to marriage, divorce, inheritance, and other personal matters governed by Islamic law, known as Shariah. The AIMPLB has been involved in various significant cases and debates, including those related to the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, the Shah Bano case, and the Triple Talaq issue. It has also played a role in advocating for the preservation of Muslim personal laws and resisting attempts to introduce a uniform civil code in India.

The board consists of members who are scholars, legal experts, and representatives of various Islamic organizations across India. It functions as a consultative body, providing guidance and opinions on matters related to Muslim personal law. The AIMPLB does not have any legal authority or power to enforce its decisions, but it carries significant influence within the Muslim community.

Description
AIMPLB is a private body working to protect Muslim personal laws, liaise with and influence the Government of India and guide the general public about crucial issues.  The board has a working committee of 51 ulama representing various schools of thought. In addition to this, it also has a general body of 201 persons of ulama as well as laymen, including about 25 women.

However, some of the Shias and Muslim feminists have formed their own separate boards, the All India Shia Personal Law Board and the All India Muslim Women's Personal Law Board, respectively but have failed to win any significant support from the Muslims or the government.

Criticism 
The AIMPLB focuses primarily to defend the Sharia laws from any law or legislation that they consider infringes on it. In this role initially it has objected to any change in the Divorce Laws for Muslim women. In this regard it has even published a book â€“ Nikah-O-Talaq (Marriage and Divorce). However, from time to time it has been hinted by the board that it might reconsider its position. It has also objected to gay rights and supports upholding the 1861 Indian law that bans sexual intercourse between persons of the same sex.

The Board has also objected to the Right of Children for Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 as they believe it will infringe on the Madrasa System of Education. It has also supported child marriage and opposes the Child Marriage Restraint Act. It supports marriage age as 15 but says we do not promote it but people should have choice. It has also objected to the High Court of India Judgement on Babri Mosque. For this, it is also willing to threaten political action. The Board was in the headlines for its opposition to the live video conference of author Salman Rushdie to the Jaipur Literature Festival in January 2012. After government considered making yoga compulsory in schools They argued that "there is a serious threat to our religion. There is a sinister design to impose 'Brahmin dharma' through yoga, Surya Namaskara and Vedic culture. They all are against Islamic beliefs. We need to awaken our community for launching a protest on a large scale"

Model Nikahnama
AIMPLB drafted a model 'nikahnama' in 2003 laying down specific guidelines and conditions on which a marriage can be annulled by both husband and wife in large sections of Sunni Muslims in Uttar Pradesh.
