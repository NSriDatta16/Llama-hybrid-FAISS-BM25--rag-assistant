History 
Kingswood was established in 1945 as a formal proposal by the City of Mitcham to "eliminate superfluous subdivisions names" as requested by the Surveyor General of South Australia. At establishment, it consisted of the sub-divisions of Kingswood Estate, Kingswood Park, Mitchamville and a portion of Old Mitcham.  In February 2003, it was enlarged by the addition of portions of the adjoining suburbs of Netherby and Mitcham.
