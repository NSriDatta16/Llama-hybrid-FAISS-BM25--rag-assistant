The 2006 United States Senate election in Hawaii was held November 7, 2006. Incumbent Democrat Daniel Akaka won re-election to his third full term.

Democratic primary

Candidates 
 Daniel Akaka, incumbent U.S. Senator
 Ed Case, U.S. Representative

Campaign 
Case had stated that although he has the deepest respect for Daniel Akaka, Hawaii is in a time of transition with regard to the state's representation in Congress which requires that the state phase in the next generation to provide continuity in that service. He had warned the state would lose all clout in Washington if the state's two US Senators, both of whom are over 80 years old, leave office within a short time of each other. If a Senator were to die, Hawaii election law requires that the governor appoint a replacement of the same party.

Hawaii's other members of Congress, Rep. Neil Abercrombie and Sen. Daniel Inouye, pledged their support to Akaka.
