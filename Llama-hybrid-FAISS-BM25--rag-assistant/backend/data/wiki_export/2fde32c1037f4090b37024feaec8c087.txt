Mildred Fox (born 17 June 1971) is an Irish former  independent politician. She was a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Wicklow constituency from 1995 to 2007.

Private life
She was educated at St. Kilian's Community School in Bray and is a graduate of University College Dublin holding a BA degree. Before becoming a TD, she worked as a hotel manager. She is married to Daryl Tighe, and they have four children.

Political career
During the 1997 to 2002 Dáil she gained some notability as she, and other independent TDs, supported the government which otherwise would not have had an overall majority. Before and after this period she was little known outside Wicklow. She was also a member of Wicklow County Council from 1995 to 2003, when she vacated her seat in favour of her brother, Christopher, when the dual mandate ended.

She was first elected to the 27th Dáil at the Wicklow by-election in June 1995 following the death of her father, sitting independent TD Johnny Fox.  She was re-elected at the 1997 general election and again at the 2002 general election. On both occasions, she was the last candidate to reach the quota. In 2002 she was elected by an extremely narrow margin of 19 votes over the Labour Party candidate Nicky Kelly. She retired at the 2007 general election. Fox wished to spend more time with her children, telling The Irish Times in 2010 that "the family had to come first."

After retiring from politics, Fox started an ice cream business, and has volunteered at a local charity shop. She sings with the country band The Whipperwills and the folk duo Hidden Stills.
