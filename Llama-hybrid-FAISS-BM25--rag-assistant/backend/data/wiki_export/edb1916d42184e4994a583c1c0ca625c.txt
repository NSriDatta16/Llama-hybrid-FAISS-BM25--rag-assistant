History
The suburb of New Hinksey was developed in the 19th century.  Until then the area was covered by water meadows.  New Hinksey was in Berkshire, in the parish of South Hinksey, until 1889, when it was absorbed into the city of Oxford. It remained in the ecclesiastical parish of South Hinksey, which is now called the parish of South with New Hinksey.
