The 17th season of World Cup competition began in December 1982 in Switzerland and concluded in March 1983 in Japan.  For the first time, the overall titles were both won by Americans, Tamara McKinney and Phil Mahre. Mahre won his third consecutive overall World Cup title; McKinney became the first American woman (and third North American, after Mahre and Nancy Greene of Canada) to win the overall title.

A major change in the World Cup series this year was the introduction of a new race, considered to be a combination of downhill and giant slalom, which was named "Super G".  Because there were only five Super G races held during the season (three men's events and two ladies' events), the races were classified with the Giant Slalom discipline for the season awards (as well as for the next two seasons).  Another major change was made to remove the World Cup/Olympics overlap.  The FIS decided not to hold the 1984 World Championships at the 1984 Olympics but instead to move the biennial event to odd-numbered years, starting with 1985. Thus, this was the final odd-numbered year without scheduled World Championships.
