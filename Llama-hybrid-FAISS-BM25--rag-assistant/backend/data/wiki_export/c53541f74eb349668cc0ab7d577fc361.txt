Maker Faire is a convention of do it yourself (DIY) enthusiasts established by Make magazine in 2006. Participants come from a wide variety of interests, such as robotics, 3D printing, computers, arts and crafts, and hacker culture.

History

In 2005, Dale Dougherty founded Make: magazine as a quarterly publication with Tim O’Reilly. The first Make: magazine was published in 2005 and the first Maker Faire took place in 2006 in San Mateo, Over the next 13 years, this inaugural maker faire expanded to more than 200 licensed Maker Faires in more than 40 countries.

Dale Dougherty convened the first Maker Faire in 2006 in San Mateo, Calif., drawing a crowd of 20,000.

Maker Media Inc. went out of business in June 2019, and Dale Dougherty rebranded as Make Community.

Maker Faires in the US

Flagship Maker Faires

Flagship Maker Faires are held in San Mateo, California and New York City.

The last Bay Area Maker Faire was held in 2019. The Maker Faire Bay Area was not held in 2020. This was due to the potential impact of coronavirus as well as the 2019 transition of Maker Media to Make: Community.

A revived Bay Area Maker Faire was held in October 2023 at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard in Vallejo, California.

The New York Maker Faire is also known as the "World Maker Faire". Maker Faire has most recently happened in New York in 2018.

However, the New York City Faire was cancelled in 2019 due to financial difficulties.
