"Maladie d'Amour" (French: Love Sickness) is a popular folk tune of the French West Indies recorded for the first time in 1931 by Léona Gabriel but popularised in the arrangement by Henri Salvador published in 1949. The published lyrics of Marc Lanjean begin: "Maladie d’amour,/ 
Maladie des amoureux / Si tu n’aimes que moi / Reste tout près de moi". However Salvador himself often sang the song in French Creole with the lyrics "Maladi damour, Maladi dé zamoureu, Chacha si’w enmen-mwen, Wa maché dèyè-mwen", a tribute to a chacha, meaning an older woman sweet on a younger man.

The song became a standard among French singers, being sung among others by Jean Sablon, Sacha Distel, Élisabeth Jérôme (fr), La Compagnie créole (fr), Manu Dibango, David Martial (fr) and Jacob Desvarieux (fr).
