Lamotte-Beuvron () is a town and commune of about 5000 inhabitants in the Loir-et-Cher department of Centre-Val de Loire, France.

The French Federal Equestrian Park, one of the largest in Europe, is based in Lamotte-Beuvron. Each July, the Federal Equestrian Park hosts the French Pony Championship, in which more than 15,000 participants compete. It also houses the permanent offices of the French Equestrian Federation and, since 2009, the Bureau of the National Association of the French Riding Pony.

The town is the birthplace of the Tarte Tatin dessert, an upside-down apple pastry named after the Tatin sisters, who created it at their Hôtel Tatin, across the street from the Lamotte-Beuvron railway station.

Lamotte-Beuvron's motto is "Hill yesterday, Mountain tomorrow" (« Motte hier, Mont demain ») which expresses the confidence of the residents in the expansion of the city.

Lamotte-Beuvron is the "sister city" of Paris, Kentucky in the United States.
