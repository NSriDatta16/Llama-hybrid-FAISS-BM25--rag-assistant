Geography
Kobersdorf is located in Middle Burgenland and is divided into the districts of Kobersdorf, Lindgraben, and Oberpetersdorf. The municipality lies at the foot of the Pauliberg, the last extinct volcano in Austria in the middle of the Naturpark Landseer Berge.

History
Like the rest of Burgenland, Kobersdorf belonged to the Kingdom of Hungary until 1920–21. After the end of the First World War, the western border area of Hungary was awarded to Austria by the Treaties of St. Germain and Trianon. Since 1921, the town has belonged to the newly founded State of Burgenland.

Kobersdorf was one of the Jewish Siebengemeinden of Burgenland. Its synagogue, built in 1860, is the only one in the seven communities that still stands. Since its restoration, it has been used for memorial services.

Kobersdorf has been a market town since 1973 (through a recently reissued VO 5).
