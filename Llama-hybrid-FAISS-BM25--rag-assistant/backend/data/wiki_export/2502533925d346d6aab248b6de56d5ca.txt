Worship God is the seventh studio album by Rebecca St. James, released on 26 February 2002. It is her highest charting album to date, peaking at No. 94 on the Billboard 200. The album produced the hit singles "Song of Love" and "Breathe".

Writing and development
Unlike her prior albums, St. James only co-wrote four out of the eleven songs. Because of its worship genre, the other seven songs are standard worship cover songs. These songs are Matt Redman's "Let My Words Be Few" and "Better Is One Day", Marie Barnett's "Breathe", City on a Hill's "God of Wonders", Lenny LeBlanc and Paul Baloche's "Above All", Jeremy Casella's "More Than the Watchmen", and the hymn "It Is Well".

St. James says "Song of Love" was partly inspired by the lorikeets outside her grandparents' home in Australia. "Lamb of God" was written and vocally recorded in just an hour and a half. St. James says of the track, "My favorite moments in songwriting are when God miraculously drops a verse, or a chorus, or even a whole song into my lap. It was definitely that way with this song." The song "You" was written while St. James was on vacation in Australia. "It Is Well" was recorded on 11 September 2001. The album also includes a bonus remix of her 1998 song, "Omega".

The album was solely produced by Matt Bronleewe, except for the "Omega Remix", which was produced by Tedd T. The string arrangements for this album were done by Jeremy Bose.

Music structure and lyrics
St. James describes the entire album as "passionate, edgy pop/rock". Lyrical content is mainly worship songs about God's love.
