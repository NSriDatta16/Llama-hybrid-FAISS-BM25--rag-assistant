Montpellier-Saint-Roch station (French: Gare de Montpellier-Saint-Roch) is the main railway station in Montpellier, France. The station was formerly known as Gare de Montpellier, but since March 2005 it has been named after Saint Roch, a native of the city who was born in the 14th century. Saint-Roch is one of the principal transport hubs of Languedoc-Roussillon, situated between the stations of Nîmes and Sète.

The station building comprises a listed front face and a passenger building laid out on three levels. What was the bus station above the tracks is now a short-stay car park. Since the beginning of the 2000s, the station has been in the middle of an urban regeneration project involving old railway property called the Nouveau Saint-Roch.

Until December 2013, there was a EuroCity service between Montpellier, Barcelona and Cartagena in Spain. This service was cut when high-speed services were extended to Barcelona and Madrid.
