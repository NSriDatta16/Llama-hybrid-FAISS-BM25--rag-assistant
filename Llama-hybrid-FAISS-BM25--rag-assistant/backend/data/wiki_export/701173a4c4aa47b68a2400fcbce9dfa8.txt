William Allison (August 1, 1930 â€“ April 25, 2016) was a former casino owner and actor. Allison had appeared in many cameo roles, such as Ocean's Eleven as an old guard, but his acting experience started when he was hired as a consultant for the production of Martin Scorsese's 1995 film, Casino, due to his casino experiences. In Casino, Allison played the Latter-day Saint (Mormon) Bagman, John Nance, who was based on Jay Vandermark.
