Biography
Born on 18 October 1889 in Westminster, London, the grandson of Joseph Kidd (1824-1918) and son of Percy Marmaduke Kidd (1851-1942), both eminent doctors, E. L. Kidd was educated at Wellington College, and went on to study at Cambridge University where he made his first-class debut, playing for the university team against Essex in May 1910 and gained his blue when he played against Oxford University later in the year. He remained in the University side for four years and also began to play county cricket for Middlesex, making his debut for them in August 1910 against Yorkshire.

He also played for the MCC and in a few Gentlemen v Players matches, and at the outbreak of World War I was considered as someone who could possibly play Test cricket for England. He graduated from Cambridge with a first in Engineering.

After the war, he had moved to Dublin where he worked for Guinness, and his appearances for Middlesex became rather sporadic by the standards of the time, only playing when on vacation from work in Dublin. He made his debut for Ireland in August 1921, playing against Scotland in a first-class match.

He continued with his occasional appearances for Middlesex, occasionally appearing for other first-class teams such as the Free Foresters, and played for Ireland five more times, once against Scotland and four times against the MCC. His last game for Ireland was in August 1930 against the MCC in Dublin, His last game for Middlesex was a County Championship match against Essex in June 1928, while his final first-class match was for the Free Foresters against Cambridge University. He died on 2 July 1984 in Dún Laoghaire, County Dublin, Ireland.
