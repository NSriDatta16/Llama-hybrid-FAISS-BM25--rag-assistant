This is a complete list of golfers who have played against the United States in the Ryder Cup for the following teams:
  Great Britain: 1927 to 1971
  Great Britain and  Ireland: 1973 to 1977
  Europe: 1979 to 2023
159 golfers have been in the final teams. In addition the list below includes Miguel Ángel Martín who qualified for the European 1997 Ryder Cup team but withdrew due to injury. Seven of the golfers in the final teams were never chosen to play in any matches so that only 152 of these golfers have actually played in the Ryder Cup.

In 1973 the official title of the British Team had been changed from "Great Britain" to "Great Britain and Ireland", but this was simply a change of name to reflect the fact that golfers from the Republic of Ireland had been playing in the Great Britain Ryder Cup team since 1953, while Northern Irish players had competed since 1947. In addition, two golfers from Jersey and one from Guernsey (both British Crown Dependencies) played on the Great Britain team in the 1920s.
