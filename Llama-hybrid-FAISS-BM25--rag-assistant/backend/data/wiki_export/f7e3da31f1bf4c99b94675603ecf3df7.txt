Clifton Preparatory School, Nottingham Road is a private, co-educational day and boarding primary school located in the Nottingham Road area of the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands in South Africa.

History
The school was founded in 1942 when a number of Clifton Durban boys moved to the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands over fears of danger during World War II. 

Clifton has added Grade 00 and phased out Grade 8 which traditionally was a boys-only grade.

Boarding
Clifton accepts boy and girl boarders from Grade 1 (age 6) and offers boarding options, from full boarding to weekly and temporary boarding. Clifton is one of the few remaining independent preparatory schools in KwaZulu-Natal that offers full boarding to young children, with boarders coming from around the country and various Southern African countries.

Grounds
The school has 60 hectares of land.
