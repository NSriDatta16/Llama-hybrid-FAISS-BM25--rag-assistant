The Tohoku Mathematical Journal is a mathematical research journal published by Tohoku University in Japan. It was founded in August 1911 by Tsuruichi Hayashi.

History
Due to World War II the publication of the journal stopped in 1943 with volume 49. Publication was resumed in 1949 with the volume numbering starting again at 1. In order to distinguish between the identical numbered volumes, volumes in the first publishing period are referred to as the first series whereas the later volumes are called second series. 

Before volume 51 of the second series the journal was called Tôhoku Mathematical Journal, with a circumflex over the second letter of Tohoku.
