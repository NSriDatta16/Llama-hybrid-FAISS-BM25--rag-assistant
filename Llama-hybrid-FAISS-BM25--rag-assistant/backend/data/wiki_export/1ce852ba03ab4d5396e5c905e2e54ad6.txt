Biography

Early life 
Nomura was born in the coastal fishing village of Amino (now Kyōtango) in Kyoto Prefecture. When he was three years old, his father died of disease while serving in China during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Nomura grew up in poverty with his mother and older brother. With the help of his brother, he was able to attend high school.

Playing career 
After graduating from Mineyama High School, Nomura joined the Nankai Hawks after a tryout in 1954. The team's manager at the time believed he'd at least be useful as a catcher for pitching practice. That year, Nomura played in nine games and went hitless for the season. The Hawks discussed cutting him from the team, however, he was given another chance reportedly after Nomura offered to play for free and even threatened to throw himself in front of a train if he was let go.
 
During a career that spanned four decades from 1954 to 1980, Nomura hit 657 home runs and led the Pacific League in homers eight straight seasons. (However, it should be taken into consideration that his home park, Osaka Stadium, measured only 276 feet down the lines until 1972, and 300 feet from 1972 onward, and 380 feet to straightaway center—tiny dimensions by Major League Baseball standards.) He finished his career with 2901 hits.

In 1965, Nomura won the league's first Triple Crown. He was a player-manager between 1970 and 1977. He played for 26 years, the longest NPB playing career until Kimiyasu Kudo pitched in his 27th season in 2008; Kudo retired in 2010 having played 29 seasons.

Managerial career

While managing the Swallows, Nomura mentored the team's catcher, Atsuya Furuta. Under Nomura, Furuta flourished and became a hall of fame catcher in his own right.

Following his role as Yakult manager, Nomura joined the Hanshin Tigers and managed the team from 1999 to 2001. The team finished last in the Central League all three seasons. On December 5, 2001, his wife, television personality Sachiyo Nomura, was arrested for tax evasion. Nomura resigned from his managerial position the next day.

After the scandal, Nomura managed the amateur corporate league team Shidax from 2003 to 2005. He left after three seasons to return to NPB.

They finished with a 38-97-1 record. Hoping to improve for their second season, the team hired Nomura to manage the club because of his experience. Over the next four season, he helped turn Rakuten around. By his final season with the team, the Eagles finished the regular season in with their best-ever showing up to that point in time, second place, securing them a position in the Climax Series. After losing in the final stage of the 2009 Pacific League Climax Series, Nomura retired from managing at the age of 74.
