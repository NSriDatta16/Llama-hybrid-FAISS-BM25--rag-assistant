Life and career 
Veličković was born on 14 June 1973 in Prokuplje and raised in the nearby village of Žitorađa. She graduated from the high school of agriculture, studying pig farming. Veličković pursued a professional career in music as a child after she had been discovered by Serbian accordion instrumentalist and songwriter Mirko Kodić, who took her to Belgrade where she made her recording debut. Ceca rose to prominence by competing at the Ilidža Folk Music Festival with the song "Cvetak zanovetak", receiving the first award for a debut performance. Her first studio album of the same title was released in 1988 under PGP-RTB. In the following years, Ceca released three more records in succession: Ludo srce (1989), Pustite me da ga vidim (1990) and Babaroga (1991).

In 1993, Ceca released her fifth album, Kukavica, through JV Komerc, on which she began collaborating with the songwriting duo Marina Tucaković and Milan Radulović. The record saw great commercial success, whilst the title track has become one of her signature hits. Following the album's release, Ražnatović held her first solo concert at the Tašmajdan Center in Belgrade. Kukavica was followed by the albums Ja još spavam u tvojoj majici (1994) and Fatalna ljubav (1995), which included stand-out hits like: "Volela sam te", "Nije monotoija", "Idi dok si mlad", "Tražio si sve" and "Beograd". To promote Fatalna ljubav Ceca had a live show at Hala Pionir. In 1996, Ražnatović released Emotivna luda under Komuna. Same year she starred as Koštana in the film adaptation of the Borisav Stanković's novel Impure Blood. However, her scenes were eventually excluded from the movie due to poor critical reception. The scenes were later included to the television series Tajne nečiste krvi, which broadcast in the beginning of 2012. Ceca renewed her collaboration with PGP-RTS to release Maskarada in 1997. Her tenth studio album, Ceca 2000, was subsequently released in December 1999. These two records produced popular songs like "Maskarada", "Nevaljala" and "Crveno".

Following the death of her husband in 2000, Ceca took a break from music. She returned to the scene in 2001 with the album Decenija, released under Grand Production. It saw commercial success, becoming her highest-selling album to date. To promote Decenija she embarked on a European tour, which ended with the concert at the Marakana Stadium in Belgrade on June 15, 2002, where she performed to 70.000 people. The album was followed by Gore od ljubavi and Idealno loša in May 2004 and June 2006, respectively.  On 17 June 2006, Ceca held a solo live show in Ušće, Belgrade.

In June 2011, she released Ljubav živi under Miligram Music, which was sold in 150,000 copies. After she had served her detention for financial fraud and illegal firearm possession between 2011 and 2012, Ceca released her fifteenth studio album, Poziv, through City Records in June 2013. It spawned hit-songs like "Da raskinem sa njom", "Ime i prezime" and "Turbolentno". The album was sold in over 100,000 units. Poziv was promoted with another concert in Ušće Park on the Vidovdan 2013. According to Ceca's management Ušće 2 attracted 150,000 people, making it one of the highest-attended concerts by a solo artist in the world. Same year, Ražnatović also performed at the New Year's Eve concert in front of the House of the National Assembly in Belgrade. In June 2016, she independently released Autogram under Ceca Music. It featured popular songs like the title track, "Trepni" and "Metar odavde". Autogram circulated in 150,000 copies.

She has served as a judge on the televised singing competitions Pinkove Zvezde (2014–2016) and Zvezde Granda (2021–present). In October 2022, Ceca's reality television show, titled Ceca Show: Ceca i deca, also began airing on Blic TV.

Personal life

Marriage and motherhood 
While performing for Serbian soldiers at a military camp in Erdut during the Yugoslav wars in 1993, Ceca was introduced by singer Oliver Mandić to war criminal, paramilitary commander and politician, Željko "Arkan" Ražnatović. They got married on 19 February 1995. Their wedding, which was broadcast internationally, was portrayed as the "Serbian fairytale" by the local media. The wedding video was later also released on a VHS tape. The couple has two children, Veljko Ražnatović (born 1996) and Anastasija (born 1998). Arkan was assassinated on 15 January 2000.

Legal issues 
Following the assassination of Prime Minister Zoran Đinđić in March 2003, Ražnatović was arrested under suspicion of harboring the  leaders of the Zemun Clan in her house, and subsequently spent 121 days in commitment. Due to lack of evidence she was ultimately released of the charge, however, the investigation raised suspicion of Ceca's illegal firearm possession as well as of embezzlement from transfers of her husband's football club, FK Obilić, between 2000 and 2003.

After eight years of investigation, in March 2011, a criminal charge was filled against Ražnatović by Serbian state prosecutors under suspicion of illegal appropriation of 4 million Deutsche Marks and over 3 million US dollars from FK Obilić player transfers, as well as for illegal possession of 11 machine guns. Ceca, who took over the club after Arkan's murder, had argued that the deals were maintained by her late husband, and that the guns also belonged to him. In June 2011, Ražnatović, who had pleaded guilty, was charged for embezzlement and illegal firearm possession, and sentenced with 1,5 million euros in fine and to a year in house arrest. In February the following year, she finished serving her detention, which was eventually reduced to eight months.

Moreover, due to her past legal issues, Ražnatović is officially banned from entering Croatia, being proclaimed persona non grata.

Politics 
Ceca was involved in politics by serving as the honorary president of the Party of Serbian Unity before Arkan was assassinated. Since her husband's passing, Ražnatović has maintained ties with Serbian politicians Ivica Dačić, who was also born in Žitorađa, and Dragan Marković, who was Arkan's former business associate. Ražnatović has publicly endorsed Aleksandar Vučić since the 2017 Serbian presidential election. In January 2019, Ceca, alongside President Vučić, representatives of the Serbian Government and Patriarch Irinej, was at the official welcoming party for Vladimir Putin at the plateau of Church of Saint Sava. Ražnatović has also maintained close ties with Bosnian Serb politician Milorad Dodik and has publicly endorsed him and his party SNSD. In June 2021, according to the reports of Insajder, Ceca was flown in from Belgrade by the Government-owned helicopter to Dodik's hometown of Laktaši in Republika Srpska to attend a private wedding party.

In July 2021, CNN's affiliate in the Southeastern Europe, N1, aired an episode about Ceca as a part of the documentary series Junaci doba zlog (Heroes of the Evil Age), which discussed her involvement in politics throughout the years. Before its premiere, Ražnatović threatened the creators with legal consequences in order to "protect her own reputation and work", unless they fulfil her request to not air the episode. The documentary episode was briefly taken off YouTube on the behalf of Ceca Music for copyright infringement.
