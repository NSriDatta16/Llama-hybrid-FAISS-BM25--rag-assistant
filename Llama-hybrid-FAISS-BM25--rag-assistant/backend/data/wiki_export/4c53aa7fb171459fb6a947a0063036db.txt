History
In 1910, Mrs. Bradley began selling sausage from her kitchen to the local community. The store was constructed in 1927 and served the people of the surrounding area of Felkel and Miccosukee. In 1915 a cane press and syrup furnace was constructed followed a few years later by a syrup house to store the bottled cane syrup. In 1922 a commissary was built, and later on a grist mill, smokehouse, and sausage processing plant were constructed. Bradley's Country Milled Grits were first produced in the 1920s. Today, the small store remains popular.  Customers experience food shopping much as it was in the early part of the 20th century.  In April 1984, Bradley's Country Store was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.
