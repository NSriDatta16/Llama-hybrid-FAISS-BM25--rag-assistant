An external ray is a curve that runs from infinity toward a Julia or Mandelbrot set.
Although this curve is only rarely a half-line (ray) it is called a ray because it is an image of a ray.

External rays are used in complex analysis, particularly in complex dynamics and geometric function theory.

History
External rays were introduced in Douady and Hubbard's study of the Mandelbrot set

Types
Criteria for classification :
 plane : parameter or dynamic
 map
 bifurcation of dynamic rays
 Stretching
 landing

plane 
External rays of (connected) Julia sets on dynamical plane are often called dynamic rays.

External rays of the Mandelbrot set (and similar one-dimensional connectedness loci) on parameter plane  are called parameter rays.

bifurcation
Dynamic ray can be:
 bifurcated = branched  = broken   
 smooth = unbranched =  unbroken

When the filled Julia set is connected, there are no branching external rays. When the Julia set is not connected then some external rays branch.

stretching
Stretching rays were introduced by Branner and Hubbard:

"The notion of stretching rays is a generalization of that of external rays for the Mandelbrot set to higher degree polynomials."

landing

Every rational parameter ray of the Mandelbrot set lands at a single parameter.

Dynamical plane = z-plane 
External rays are associated to a compact, full, connected subset  of the complex plane as :
 the images of radial rays under the Riemann map of the complement of 
 the gradient lines of the Green's function of 
 field lines of Douady-Hubbard potential
 an integral curve of the gradient vector field of the Green's function on neighborhood of infinity

External rays together with equipotential lines of Douady-Hubbard potential ( level sets)  form a new polar coordinate system for exterior ( complement ) of .

In other words the external rays define vertical foliation which is orthogonal to horizontal foliation defined by the level sets of potential.

Uniformization
Let  be the conformal isomorphism from the complement (exterior) of the closed unit disk   to the complement of the filled Julia set  .

where  denotes the extended complex plane.
Let  denote the Boettcher map.
 is a uniformizing map of the basin of attraction of infinity, because it conjugates  on the complement of the filled Julia set  to  on the complement of the unit disk:

and 

A value  is called the Boettcher coordinate for a point .

Formal definition of dynamic ray

The external ray of angle   noted as is:
 the image under  of straight lines 

set of points of exterior of filled-in Julia set with the same external angle

Properties

The external ray for a periodic angle  satisfies:

and its landing point  satisfies:

Parameter plane = c-plane 
"Parameter rays are simply the curves that run perpendicular to the equipotential curves of the M-set."

Uniformization

Let  be the mapping from the complement (exterior) of the closed unit disk   to the complement of the Mandelbrot set  .

and Boettcher map (function) , which is uniformizing map of complement of Mandelbrot set, because it conjugates complement of the Mandelbrot set   and the complement (exterior) of the closed unit disk

it can be normalized so that :

where :
 denotes the extended complex plane

Jungreis function  is the inverse of uniformizing map :

In the case of complex quadratic polynomial one can compute this map using Laurent series about infinity

where

Formal definition of parameter ray

The external ray of angle  is:
the image under  of straight lines 

set of points of exterior of Mandelbrot set with the same external angle

Definition of the Boettcher map 

Douady and Hubbard define:

so external angle of point  of parameter plane is equal to external angle of point  of dynamical plane

External angle

Angle  is named external angle ( argument ).

Principal value of external angles are measured in turns modulo 1

1  turn = 360 degrees = 2 ×  radians

Compare different types of angles :
 external ( point of set's exterior )
 internal ( point of component's interior  )
 plain ( argument of complex number )

Computation of external argument
  argument of Böttcher coordinate as an external argument
 
 
 kneading sequence as a binary expansion of external argument

Transcendental maps

For transcendental maps ( for example exponential ) infinity is not a fixed point but an  essential singularity and there is no Boettcher isomorphism.

Here dynamic ray is defined as a curve :
 connecting a point in an escaping set and infinity 
 lying in an escaping set
