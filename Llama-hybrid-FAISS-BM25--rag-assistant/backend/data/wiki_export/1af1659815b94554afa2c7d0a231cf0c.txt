Back in Business is the fifth studio album by the hip-hop duo EPMD, released on September 16, 1997, through Def Jam Recordings. It was their first album since 1992, when the pair had broken up due to money issues.  The single "Da Joint" became their second Billboard Hot 100 appearance.

The album was certified Gold by the RIAA on November 17, 1997.

Critical reception
Vibe wrote that "Sermon's sluggish production makes the duo's paper-thin and finance-driven subject matter that much more irritating." Rolling Stone declared: "Gone is the Wall of Sound funk that made EPMD famous." The Austin American-Statesman thought that "jams such as 'Richter Scale' and 'Get With This' show true EPMD style as Erick and Parish sound perfect together over guitar funk." The Guardian wrote that Back in Business "returns to the breaks and beats that made [EPMD] great: kooky 1970s funk samples mixed with guitar loops and cool-as-ice vocals."
