History 

The school was chartered in 1859 as Union Female College and became affiliated with the Baptist General Association of Virginia in 1910.

In 2005, the Baptist General Association of Virginia dissolved their ties with Averett after the university abandoned Baptist positions on homosexuality. In November 2011, the Baptist General Association of Virginia voted to restore the association's relationship with Averett University.
