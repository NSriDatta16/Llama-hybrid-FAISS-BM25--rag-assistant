Squeeze Play is an Ultra High Fidelity monaural phonographic album (33 RPM) which was released on the Dot Records label in 1956 (DLP-3024) featuring John Serry Sr. It includes an original composition by Serry, classical works, and popular music of the era. Ben Selvin serves as the musical director/producer for the album. The works were arranged by Serry and performed with his ensemble featuring two accordions, piano, guitar, bass, drum, vibes, and marimba.

The album was cited in a critical review of new popular albums of 1956 in The Billboard magazine and was described as providing beautiful performances which created a soothing mood, in contrast to common entertainment. The album was also reviewed in The Cash Box magazine later that year. Serry's performances were noted for establishing a variety of musical moods with grace while also emphasizing a relaxed performance style. In 1958 selected songs from the album were released in France by Versailles records (#90 M 1788) as Chicago Musette - John Serry et son accordéon. Dot Records also released several songs from the album in Japan as part of a compilation recording including performances of easy listening music by both the John Serry Orchestra and the Billy Vaughn Orchestra (Ballroom in Dreamland, Dot #5006). A copy of the album and the composer's original orchestral score have been donated for archival purposes to the Eastman School of Music's Sibley Music Library within the Ruth T. Watanabe Special Collections Department for the benefit of researchers and students.
