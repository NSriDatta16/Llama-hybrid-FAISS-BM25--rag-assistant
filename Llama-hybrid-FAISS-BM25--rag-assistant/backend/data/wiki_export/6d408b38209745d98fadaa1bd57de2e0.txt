Sainte-Marie-Saint-Raphaël (unofficially Ste-Marie-St-Raphaël) is a former village in Gloucester County, New Brunswick, Canada. It held village status prior to 2023 and is now part of the town of Île-de-Lamèque.

Located on Lamèque Island, the village was formed by the incorporation of most of the local service district (LSD) of St. Raphael sur-Mer and a small part of the neighbouring LSD of Haut-Lamèque. Contrary to frequent citation, it was not formed by an amalgamation involving a village named Sainte-Marie.

History

In May 1971, an anxious Acadian fishing population demanded a public hearing into the safety of the Marc Guylaine, and 400 people met at the Saint-Raphaël community centre where an "action group" was commissioned to study the issue. Ultimately the last of the "cursed" sister ships was found to be unseaworthy.

On 1 January 2023, Sainte-Marie-Saint-Raphaël amalgamated with the town of Lamèque and all or part of ten local service districts to form the new town of Île-de-Lamèque. The community's name remains in official use.
