Ito En (Hawaii) LLC

Ito En (USA) Inc. established local roots when Ito En, Ltd. purchased Shimoko and Sons, Inc. (S&S) in 1987.  As Hawaii’s most popular maker of Saimin noodles and Aloha Maid Tropical Fruit Drinks, the fit was a natural one.  The S&S line of products was sold to Sun Noodle Hawaii, LLC in 2006.  In 2016, the Ito En (USA) Inc. business was dissolved and a new company, Ito En (Hawaii) LLC, was created in its place. Ito En (Hawaii) LLC offers the Hawaii market access to current seasonal Japan teas and beverages.  Affiliate company, Ito En (North America) Inc. markets Asian teas and beverages to the mainland and Hawaii.

The company sells still drinks in Hawaii as Aloha Maid, and is a competitor to local Hawaiian Sun drinks.
