Nastasen was a king of Kush who ruled the Kingdom of Kush from 335 to 315/310 BCE. According to a stela from Dongola, his mother was named Queen Pelkha and his father may have been King Harsiotef. His successor was Aryamani.

Biography
Nastasen is known from three types of objects. There is a stela with a long historical inscription, a silver handle of a mirror, and several shabti-figures. The mirror handle and the shabti were found in a pyramid at Nuri (Nu. 15), which was obviously his burial place. He was the last Kushite king to be buried in the royal cemetery at Napata.

The  granite stela was found at New Dongola and is now in the Egyptian Museum of Berlin (Inv. no. 2268). Originally, it was most likely placed in the Amun temple of Jebel Barkal. In the upper part appear the pictures and name of his mother, Pelkha, and his wife, Sekhmakh, next to the king.

During his reign, Nastasen defeated an invasion of Kush from Upper Egypt. Nastasen's monument calls the leader of this invasion Kambasuten, a likely local variation of Khabbash. Khabbash was a local ruler of Upper Egypt who had campaigned against the Persians around 338 BC. His invasion of Kush was a failure, and Nastasen claimed to have taken many fine boats and other war prizes during his victory.

Tomb excavation

The tomb of Nastasen is among several in Nuri that are slated for excavation by archaeologists using underwater archaeological methods. That is necessary because of rising ground waters in what was the Nubian region. These tombs are under the pyramids and have flooded. Initial excavation reports of his tomb indicate that it may be undisturbed by grave robbers. Artifacts not adversely affected by the water could be found, which could add to what is known about Nastasen, along with evidence already found of artifacts mostly damaged or lost due to the action of the water. 

Explorer Josh Gates participated in a dive at the site, which was featured in a May 2023 episode of Expedition Unknown (season 11, episodes 1 & 2 scheduled to air May 24th & 31st). Among the finds uncovered on the dives were gold leaf, and a bone fragment in a gold toe cap, assumed to be from Nastasen.
