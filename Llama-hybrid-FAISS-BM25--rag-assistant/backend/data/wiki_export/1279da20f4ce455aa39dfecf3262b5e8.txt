Trooperslane railway station serves the hamlet of Trooperslane in County Antrim, Northern Ireland.

There are plans to open a park and ride facility at the station.

The station was opened on 11 April 1848.

For many years it was served only by peak-time services on Mondays to Saturdays.  On a trial basis in the 1990s, one service each way made a request stop on a Sunday, however this was not a success.

When Northern Ireland Railways introduced a new clock-face timetable in the mid-2000s, the station once again saw a regular service seven days a week, with nearly all trains serving the station. Trooperslane also has a level crossing, supervised by closed-circuit television.
