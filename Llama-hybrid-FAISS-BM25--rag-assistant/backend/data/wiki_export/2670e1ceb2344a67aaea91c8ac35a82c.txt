Biography
Hameed Nizami was born in the remote railway junction town of Sangla Hill, District Nankana Sahib. Sangla Hill is few miles from the vintage city Lyallpur (now Faisalabad), Punjab, British Indian Empire, on 3 October 1915.  He hailed from a Punjabi family and initially studied at the local school in Faisalabad at his own expense. He attended the Islamia College where he gained a BA degree in Journalism.  Later, he attended the Punjab University where he attained the MA degree in English Literature.

During his years in college, he was politically active. He founded and served as president of the 'Punjab Muslim Students Federation' wing of the All India Muslim League. His role as student leader and journalist led him to become closer to Muhammad Ali Jinnah. After attaining master's degree in journalism, he joined the press directorate of the Punjab government for a short time before joining the literary staff of the Orient Press.

Nawa-i-Waqt newspaper
In 1940, Nizami left the Orient Press and founded the Nawa-i-Waqt newspaper. He became the newspaper's first editor-in-chief from Lahore on 23 March 1940. The Nawa-i-Waqt was a monthly newspaper but he quickly converted the newspaper into weekly on 15 December 1942. After hiring more staff and gaining more credibility, the Nawa-i-Waqt began publishing as a daily newspaper on 19 July 1944. The first edition of the Nawa-i-Waqt came out on 22 July 1944 with a Muslim prayer and a message of Muhammad Ali Jinnah in it.

Nizami's efforts made Nawa-i-Waqt, with all its resources limitations, a powerful voice of the people for the cause of All India Muslim League and he penned several articles for the support of Pakistan Movement. He was noted as a strong spokesman for democracy in the country, and wrote a harsh column against the first martial law imposed by President Iskander Mirza. Through his newspaper, he took hard stance on communism and supported capitalism during the 1950s.

He began to raise his voice against the martial law despite hardship imposed by the government. He once described the martial law as a "dark night".

Commemorative postage stamp
Pakistan Post Office issued a commemorative postage stamp on 14 August 1991 to honor Hameed Nizami in its 'Pioneers of Freedom' stamp series.

Death and legacy
Hameed Nizami died on 22 February 1962 in Lahore. His death was mourned throughout the country. After his death, the newspaper founded the "Hameed Nizami Memorial Society" (HNMS) dedicated to his style of journalism, and held memorial sessions on his death anniversary every year.
