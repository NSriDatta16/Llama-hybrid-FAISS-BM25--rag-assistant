Meet Ricky Gervais is a British television comedy talk show written and hosted by Ricky Gervais. It was produced by Talkback for Channel 4 in 2000 and ran for one series on Friday nights.

Overview
Guests were supposedly interviewed by Gervais in the original television studio chairs of famous people. Gervais was seated in Michael Aspel's Aspel & Co leather chair and guests seated in Ronnie Corbett's monologue chair, and Grandad from Only Fools and Horses''' armchair. Each episode has two celebrity guests, and following the interview segments Gervais would host his version of a classic television panel game, with the guests as contestants.

The show regularly featured darts assistant Tony Green, who would take his place as the general stooge and gameshow assistant. On the first episode, Gervais joked that Green came free with the original Bullseye dartboard, which he supposedly found himself whilst building the rest of the set.

Also, the show did not have a theme tune so at the end of each show, Gervais asked viewers to record and send in their own mixes. Few were received. Two of the episodes used a theme tune co-written and performed by Stewart Ferris and Emma Burgess.

Episodes

Production notes
The series was produced by Iain Morris and co-written by Jimmy Carr and Robin Ince with additional material provided by Stephen Merchant and Stirling Gallacher (VT clock voiceover).

Reception
Gervais admits that this show was an embarrassment and it has since been mocked even by Gervais himself. He was quoted as saying that there was no second series as Channel 4 wanted to see some changes, "ratings mainly". Commenting on the difficulties of securing guests Gervais stated that "either they'd heard of me or they hadn't. Either way it was a problem".
