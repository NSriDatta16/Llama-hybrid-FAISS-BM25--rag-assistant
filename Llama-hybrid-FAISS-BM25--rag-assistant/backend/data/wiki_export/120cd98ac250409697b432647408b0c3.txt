Conservation
The landscape surrounding Yard Creek Park is part of the Interior wetbelt characterized by cedar and hemlock forest and lush undergrowth. The park contains a variety of bird species including American dippers. These little birds dive into the icy waters of the creek and "fly" along under the water in search of water insects. They can be seen on the rocks along the creek.

Recreation
The park contains 65 quiet shaded tent and RV camping sites, hiking trails, and a popular day-use area with a log picnic shelter.
