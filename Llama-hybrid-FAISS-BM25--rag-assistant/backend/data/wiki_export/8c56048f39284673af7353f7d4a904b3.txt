 Catamarca
The center of the City of Catamarca boasts the imposing cathedral of Our Lady of the Valley, Patron Saint of the city. Throughout the year, thousands of faithful believers from all parts of the country flock to see the image of the virgin.

The spectacular temple of Our Lady of the Valley is the most important in the Province of Catamarca. It was designed by architect and town planner Luis Caravatti and constructed between 1859 and 1875 with a strong Neo-classical style. At that time, Vicario Seguro worked very hard to build this cathedral. In fact, he persuaded Justo Jose de Urquiza to make a donation of a sum of money for its construction. Certainly, many pilgrims also collaborated on the same purpose. The temple is so superb that not only does it attract the pilgrims but also the visitors to Catamarca, who cannot miss this architectural jewel. Its facade has a big entrance hall which extends towards the sidewalk and two side towers almost forty meters high.
