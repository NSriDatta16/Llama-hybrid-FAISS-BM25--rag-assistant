The Spanish futsal league is divided into divisions.  The top teams play in the División de Honor (also called Liga Nacional de Fútbol Sala). In each division, a team plays all other teams twice, once at home and once away.

The Spanish league teams compete in Europe under UEFA, most notably in the UEFA Futsal Cup with great success, being the national league holding more continental titles. The teams also compete in a domestic cup competition each year, called the Copa del Rey. The winner of the División de Honor plays against the winner of the Copa del Rey in the Supercopa de España (Super Cup).
