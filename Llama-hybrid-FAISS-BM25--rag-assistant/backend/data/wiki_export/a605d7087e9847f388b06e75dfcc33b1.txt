Cosmic Gate is a German DJ duo consisting of trance music producers Claus Terhoeven (born 1972) and Stefan Bossems (born 1967). Both hail from Krefeld, Germany.

On October 28, 2009, DJ Magazine announced the results of their annual Top 100 DJ Poll, with Ultra Records artist Cosmic Gate placed #19, 43 spots above the group's ranking the year before. For the 2010 DJ Magazine Top 100 DJ Poll, Cosmic Gate moved to #24.

Career
Cosmic Gate was formed in 1999 when Terhoeven (also known as Nic Chagall) and Bossems (also known as Bossi) decided to assemble a new project in the electronic music field.

Their first single was "The Drums", followed by "Exploration of Space", "Mental Atmosphere" and their "Somewhere over the Rainbow" remix using samples from the film The Wizard of Oz. However, Cosmic Gate did not become well known until their single "Fire Wire" was released in the UK in 2001.

Cosmic Gate have made many remixes for artists such as Tiësto ("Urban Train"), Ferry Corsten ("Punk"), Blank & Jones ("DFF"), Israel Kamakawiwo'ole ("Somewhere Over the Rainbow"), Svenson & Gielen ("Answer the Question") and Vanessa-Mae ("White Bird").

Over the past few years, Cosmic Gate's sound has developed and moved away from the harder edge trance through to their current, more subtle yet still driving energetic music style. Since their third studio album, Earth Mover, they started moving towards the Progressive Trance style.

In 2015, they collaborated with Armin van Buuren on the trance track "Embargo", which was featured on Van Buuren's studio album "Embrace". Two years later, they announced their seventh studio album titled "Materia", which was released on January 20, 2017.

In 2018, Nic & Bossi were nominated for a Grammy Award For Best Remixed Recording for their remix of Gabriel & Dresden feat. Sub Teal "Only Road" on the Anjunabeats Label. They were the first ever trance artists to be nominated in this category.

Touring
The pair have played over 1,000 gigs, typically performing between 100 and 130 nights a year. They have played at clubs such as Ministry of Sound, The Guvernment, and Privilege Ibiza. They have played alongside DJs such as Armin Van Buuren, Ferry Corsten, W&W and Hardwell.
