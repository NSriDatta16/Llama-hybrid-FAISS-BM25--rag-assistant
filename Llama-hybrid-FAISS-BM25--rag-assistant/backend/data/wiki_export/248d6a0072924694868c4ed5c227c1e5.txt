Ryde St John's Road is a railway station on the Island Line, and serves the town of Ryde, Isle of Wight. The station is  south of Ryde Pier Headâ€”the Island Line's northern terminus.

History
When the station opened in 1864, it was known as Ryde railway station, as it was the northern terminus of the Isle of Wight Railway at the time. Rather than a railway, a tramway continued northwards to where the current Ryde Pier Head railway station stands; the railway was extended to Ryde Pier in 1880.

Depot and signalling
Adjacent to the railway station is Ryde Traincare Depot: the Island Line's traction maintenance depot, where the maintenance and storage of the Island Line's Class 484 trains takes place. Since 1989, signalling for the Island Line has been centralised to the station's signal box.

Future developments
It has been suggested that the Isle of Wight Steam Railway might be extended from Smallbrook Junction to Ryde St John's Road in the future, but there are currently no official proposals.
