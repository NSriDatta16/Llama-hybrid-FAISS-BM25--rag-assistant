The Jatoi () are among the main Baloch tribes in the Kacchi Plain in the east of Balochistan. Balochi traditional ballads tell of a leader named Mir Jalal Khan who had four sons, Rind, Lashar, Hot, and Korai, and a daughter Jato, who married his nephew Morad. These five are, according to these ballads, the eponymous founders of the five tribes of the Rinds, Lasharis, Hoths, Korais, and Jatois.
