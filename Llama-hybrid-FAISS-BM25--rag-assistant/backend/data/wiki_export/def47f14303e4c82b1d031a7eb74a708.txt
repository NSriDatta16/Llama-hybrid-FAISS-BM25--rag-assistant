Kathryn Adams (born Kathryn Ethalinda Colson; May 25, 1893 â€“ February 17, 1959), sometimes credited as  Catherine Adams or Katherine Adams, was an American silent film actress.

Early years
Adams was born Kathryn Ethalinda Colson on May 25, 1893, the daughter of actress Kate Colson. She was educated in St. Louis, and had vocal training in New York.

Career 
Early in her career, Adams "played in numerous types of legitimate drama". She entered films in 1915 after a brief and rather unsuccessful stint in musical comedy.

Adams worked for the Thanhouser Company in its early films and had the lead roles in that company's productions The Bird of Prey and The Phantom Witness. After a number of successful leading roles, she drifted into supporting roles in the 1920s, and, except for a brief appearance in the 1931 version of The Squaw Man, Adams disappeared from films after 1925. She retired from the film industry in 1931 and worked as an assembler at Lockheed Corporation making aircraft.

Personal life and death 
Adams married Arthur Witter in 1920; in 1928, the two divorced due to Witter's drinking. She later married Jacques Magnin, a businessman from Los Angeles.

On February 17, 1959, Adams died in Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital of an intestinal hemorrhage at the age of 65. She is buried in section R of Calvary Cemetery, East Los Angeles next to her mother.
