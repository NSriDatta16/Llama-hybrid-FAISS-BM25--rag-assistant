History
The Director of Public Works William Chatham had submitted to the Legislative Council a draft plan for The Extension of the Tai Tam Water Supply System, called the "Tai Tam Tuk Scheme", which will be carried out in two phases on 17 October 1903. The first phase of the construction of 195.5 million gallons (900,000 m3) water storage in Tai Tam Intermediate Reservoir, which was carried out from 1904 to 1907. Therefore, Tai Tam Intermediate Reservoir is geographically lower than the tunnel inlet of Tai Tam Upper Reservoir. Therefore, it is necessary to build a Tai Tam Tuk raw water pumping station on the west bank of Tai Tam Bay to pump the stored water to Tai Tam Valley and deploy it to the water supply system of the Central District through the entrance of the water conveyance tunnel. In 1977, the Water Supplies Department lowered the entire section of the dam's spillway by three metres for safety reasons, and this had left the dam looking slightly indented at its crest.
