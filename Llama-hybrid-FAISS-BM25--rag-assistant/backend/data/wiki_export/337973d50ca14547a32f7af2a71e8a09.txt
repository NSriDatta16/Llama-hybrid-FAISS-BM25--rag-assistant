Route 116 is an east/west highway on the south shore of the St. Lawrence River in Quebec, Canada. It runs between Route 134 in Longueuil and Route 132 in Lévis, connecting the south shore areas of Montreal and Quebec City; it also serves the administrative regions of Montérégie, Centre-du-Québec, Estrie and Chaudière-Appalaches. Until the mid-1970s it was known as Route 9 between Le Moyne (presently part of Longueuil) and Saint-Simon; Route 32 between Saint-Simon and Richmond; and Route 5 between Richmond and Saint-Nicolas (presently part of Lévis).

Route description 
Route 116 begins in Longueuil at the junction of Route 134 (Boulevard Taschereau) in Borough of Le Moyne and called Boulevard Sir Wilfrid-Laurier, and name that it holds until Autoroute 20 east of Saint-Hyacinthe. Route 116 shares a concurrency with Route 112 until Saint-Hubert, just south of the Saint-Hubert Municipal Airport, to the junction of Autoroute 30 in Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville. This section is a controlled-access Autoroute-grade freeway. This portion was once envisioned to be part of Autoroute 16. An unofficial extension of Route 116 as thought of by locals, from the western terminus follows the Route 134 limited access expressway to the Jacques Cartier Bridge.

East of Autoroute 30, Route 116 is a high-volume, divided expressway with at-grade intersections as it passes through the growing South Shore suburbs of Montreal. It overlaps with Autoroute 20 for , then has lighter traffic counts up to Richmond. Between Richmond and Plessisville traffic is heavier as it passes bigger towns as it is located further away from Autoroute 20; however the section from Plessisville and Lévis does not have much traffic due to its proximity to Autoroute 20.
