Unhinged is a 1993 live album by English folk/rock singer-songwriter Roy Harper.

History 
Initially the album, recorded at various concerts in the UK between 1989 and 1991, was intended as an introductory album for the Canadian market, at a time when Harper appeared to be contemplating a move to the North American continent.

The album features 12 of the 14 tracks originally released on 1992s limited edition (2,000) cassette release Born in Captivity II. The tracks 'running order' has been altered from the original cassette version too.

Harper's son Nick Harper, makes guest appearances playing guitar on a number of songs, and English cricketer Graeme Fowler makes an appearance playing drums on the song "Hope".

The CD was reissued with a different cover in 1995 on Harper's label, Science Friction (HUCD020). Again, two tracks (one song, "Short and Sweet" and one poem, "Yet") were omitted from the CD reissue. The album has remained popular with Harper fans due to its sound quality, song selection and the standard of performance recorded. It is very true to the 'live experience'.

The album's title Unhinged, was a play on the title of the popular MTV series, "Unplugged".
