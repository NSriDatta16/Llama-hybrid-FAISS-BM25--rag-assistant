California's 22nd congressional district is a congressional district in the U.S. state of California. It is represented by David Valadao, who formerly represented California's 21st congressional district from 2013 to 2019 and 2021 to 2023. As of , this district, alongside New York's 4th, is the most Democratic-leaning congressional district represented by a Republican, with a partisan lean of D+5. It was also one of 18 districts that would have voted for Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election had they existed in their current configuration while being won or held by a Republican in 2022.

Following redistricting in 2021, the district is still in the San Joaquin Valley. It includes most of Kings County and parts of Tulare and Kern Counties. It includes the east side of Bakersfield; the west and south sides of Tulare, the south side of Hanford; and all of Porterville, Lindsay, Shafter, Wasco, Delano, McFarland, Arvin, Lamont, and Corcoran. The new 22nd is a majority-Latino district.
