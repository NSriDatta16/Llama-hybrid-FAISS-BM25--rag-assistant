The station was destroyed on March 11, 2011 due to damage associated with the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, and services were replaced by provisional bus services. The station reopened on May 30, 2015 on a higher ground where the former community around the station would be reconstructed. Due to the relocation, the distance from Aoba-Dōri was changed from 32.4 kilometers to 32.2 kilometers.
