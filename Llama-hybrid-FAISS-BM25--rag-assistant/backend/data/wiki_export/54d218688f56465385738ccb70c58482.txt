Niya (; ), is a town  in Minfeng County, Hotan Prefecture, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China.

It is the county seat of  Minfeng County, and therefore is commonly referred to as Minfeng, and is labeled so on less detailed maps. An ancient town also called Niya is located 115 km to the north of this modern Niya.

Name 
The former name for the Niya region was Nina. The word seems to be related to the Greek word nimma (), meaning "pure water". During the Han dynasty, the city was known as Jingjue. This word's Chinese characters mean "pure" or "clean", implying a relation between the two names.

History
Niya/Minfeng was known in ancient time as Ronglu () during the Han dynasties (206 BC - 222 AD) and, according to the Hanshu Chapter 96A, was said to have had "240 households, 610 individuals with 300 persons able to bear arms" during the Former Han Dynasty (206 BC - 23 AD). It is situated about 115 km north of the modern town of Minfeng. Numerous Buddhist scriptures, sculptures, mummies and other precious archeological finds have been made in the region. The remains of more than seventy buildings have been discovered scattered over an area of some 45 km2. It was located on the southern branch of the Silk Road.

In the early 20th century, Aurel Stein carried out several expeditions in the area including exploration of the ancient Niya ruins. In 1991, a joint Sino-Japanese expedition dug up the ancient city and established that the original inhabitants of the city may have been members of Alexander the Great's army, settling in the city during Alexander's conquests.  

In 2015, Lanpalu was added as a residential community.

In 2017, Ankang, Xingfu, Tuanjie, Hexie, Guangming and Youyi were established as residential communities.
