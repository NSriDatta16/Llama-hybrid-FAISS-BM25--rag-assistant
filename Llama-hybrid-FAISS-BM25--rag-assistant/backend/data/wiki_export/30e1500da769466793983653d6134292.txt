The Dublin and Belfast Inter-City Cup was an association football competition that ran for eight seasons in Ireland between 1941 and 1949. 

Each season's competition consisted of six teams from each of the two jurisdictions on the island of Ireland (Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland), and their respective governing bodies (the Irish Football Association and the Football Association of Ireland).

Format
Played in knock out format, the matches were played on a two-legged basis. Dalymount Park, Dublin was used as the home venue by all the League of Ireland clubs. For the second round of the competition, the six first round winners were joined by the two best losers. It was an extremely popular competition, adding variety to the restricted war-time football diet and generated much needed and significant revenues to the competing clubs.
