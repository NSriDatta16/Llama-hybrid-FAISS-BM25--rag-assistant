The 9th Georgia Infantry Regiment was an infantry regiment in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War.

History
The 9th Georgia Volunteer Infantry formed in June 1861 and contained men from around the State of Georgia. The regiment fought at Gettysburg, Siege of Knoxville, and participated in the Wilderness Campaign while serving under General James Longstreet. For their actions at Gettysburg, they received the Confederate Roll of Honor. Aside from a brief stint in the Army of Tennessee, the 9th spent most of its time during the war with Longstreet in the Army of Northern Virginia and ended their service with that corps. Future Atlanta mayor, George Hillyer served with the 9th and wrote a book about their action at Gettysburg entitled My Gettysburg Battle Experiences.
