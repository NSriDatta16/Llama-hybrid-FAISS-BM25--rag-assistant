The Road Home, a live album released in 1995, is the fourteenth album overall by the rock group Heart. It chronicles a club performance in the "unplugged" style in their home city of Seattle. The setlist contains acoustic versions of many of the band's hits including "Dreamboat Annie", "Alone", "Barracuda".

The album was produced by John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin, a band to whom Ann and Nancy Wilson paid tribute with their band the Lovemongers. "He was a prince among men," enthused Ann. The cover photograph shows an old picture of a young Ann & Nancy Wilson with a candle.

The album reached number eighty-seven on the U.S. Billboard 200.

In 1995 a VHS was released under the same name and with the same cover containing another concert from the same tour. The video was reissued on DVD in 2003.
