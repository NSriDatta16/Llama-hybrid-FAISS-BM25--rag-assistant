History 
Plans to create a military cemetery in the Portland area started as early as 1941, and Franklin D.

Finally, in 1949 the state of Oregon donated  of land for the establishment of a National Cemetery. Construction was completed in 1950, and Willamette National Cemetery was officially opened on December 14 that year. The first interment did not take place until 1951. In 1952, another  of land were donated to the cemetery.
