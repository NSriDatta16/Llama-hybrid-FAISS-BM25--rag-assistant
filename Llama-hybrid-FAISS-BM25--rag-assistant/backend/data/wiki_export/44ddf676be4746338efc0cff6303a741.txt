Çiğli (Silleon in Greek) is a municipality and district of İzmir Province, Turkey. Its area is 139 km2, and its population is 214,065 (2022). It covers the northwestern part of the agglomeration of İzmir, around the mouth of the river Gediz, across the Gulf of İzmir from the main city. The Gediz delta is an Important Bird Area but is under threat from urbanization. IAOIZ, the Izmir Atatürk Organized Industrial Zone, is a significant economic hub and there is a major air force base.

History 
Çiğ means dew in Turkish, a reference to the delta marshes of the River Gediz which used to cover the entire area. It is a relatively recent settlement created largely by migration from other parts of Turkey, starting with Turkish refugees of the Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878). Turks from the surrounding region took refuge in the marshes during the Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922), and were joined by ethnic Turks from the Greek province of Western Thrace after the war. The population was further increased by survivors of two earthquakes in eastern Anatolia in 1946 and 1966.  Economic migration from eastern Anatolia has continued at a steady pace since then and even the mayor was born in Diyarbakır.

Geography 
Çiğli was built on the delta marshes where the river Gediz flows into the Gulf of İzmir. It lies between Karşıyaka, another metropolitan district, to the south and the west, and İzmir's external dependent district of Menemen to the north. The western boundary is formed by the current delta of the River Gediz where the land is under the constant pressure of further urbanization. The future of the delta is among priority issues in Turkey's agenda of the protection of the environment. Many citizens would like to see full protection for the delta assured to preserve its unique fauna and flora along bird migration routes. The delta is an IBA (Important Bird Area) registered with BirdLife International.

Government 
Çiğli gained village status after the fall of the Ottoman Empire and became a municipality in 1956. It was attached to İzmir's metropolitan area in 1981, first as a dependency of the district of Karşıyaka, and in 1992 it became a distinct entity with its own administrative structures.
