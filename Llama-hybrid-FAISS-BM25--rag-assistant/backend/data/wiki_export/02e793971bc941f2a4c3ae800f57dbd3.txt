Beezy Bailey (born 21 July 1962 in Johannesburg, South Africa) is a South African artist who works in various media, including painting, sculpture, drawing, printmaking and ceramics. He has been a full-time artist for 30 years, with over 20 one-man shows in London, Johannesburg and Cape Town as well as group shows around the world.

Education
He received a fine art degree from Byam Shaw School of Art in London in 1986, after studying two years of life drawing and then a third in printmaking, painting and sculpture.

Artwork
Bailey has worked with musicians, including David Bowie, Brian Eno, Dave Matthews and Arno Carstens, and with photographer Zwelethu Mthethwa.

In 1985, before completing his degree, Bailey worked with Young British Artist Lennie Lee creating sculptures in an empty warehouse in east London, UK.

His work has often been political and attracted controversy.

Bailey's work is represented in several art collections, including the David Bowie Art Collection.

Joyce Ntobe

Frustrated with "increasingly prevalent affirmative action",  in 1991 Bailey submitted two artworks to an exhibition.  One was with the traditional Beezy Bailey signature (rejected), the other signed Joyce Ntobe.  The latter is now in the South African National Gallery as part of its permanent collection.  When the curator of the Gallery wanted to work on a paper about three black women artists, Joyce Ntobe being one, Bailey revealed the truth. He has since exhibited work under the name Joyce Ntobe.

Personal life

Bailey is married with two children and lives in Cape Town and London.
