Triton High School is a public school in Dodge Center, Minnesota, United States.

History
Triton Senior High was established in 1990 when the communities of Dodge Center, West Concord and Claremont consolidated to create one high school and junior high school. The newly created high school was housed in the former Dodge Center High School building and the junior high school was housed in the former West Concord High School building. Each town continued to operate separate elementary schools. The first Triton High School commencement was held in June 1991.

Triton's mascot is the Cobra and colors are maroon and grey. The Cobra mascot and school colors were created when Dodge Center and Claremont High Schools partnered for basketball, baseball and softball during the 1989-1990 school year. Colors were created by combining both schools' main colors: green (Dodge Center) and orange (Claremont), which resulted in maroon; then secondary colors: white (Dodge Center) with black (Claremont), resulting in grey. The Cobra was created by collaboration of two (co). Upon official consolidation of Dodge Center, West Concord and Claremont in 1990, the 6th11th grade students in each town voted to name the school "Triton" and retain the Cobra mascot, as well as colors of maroon and grey. Other options for school names were: Tritown, West Dodgemont, Dodge Westmont, Dodge County West and Tri-Community High School.

A bond referendum was passed in 1996 to build an addition to the high school building in Dodge Center, adding Triton Primary School and additional high school space, which opened in the fall of 1998. Later, Triton relocated its junior high (middle school) from West Concord to Dodge Center and officially opened in the fall of 2009. Additional space was added and renovations were made in 2012 as the Triton community continued to grow.

Triton offers many successful programs. For example, Senior Seminar is a class taken in the final semester of high school. The class reinforces seniors' life skills, such as financial planning and job interviewing techniques. This class must be passed in order for students to graduate.
