Køge station is the principal railway station serving the town of Køge 39 km southwest of Copenhagen on the island of Zealand, Denmark. It is located in central Køge, situated between the historic town centre and the Port of Køge, and immediately adjacent to the Køge bus station.

The station is located on the Little South Line between Roskilde and Næstved via Køge, and is the terminus of an S-train line (Køgebugtbanen) that connects it to Copenhagen, and Østbanen that connects it with the Stevns Peninsula. The station opened in 1870 with the opening of the original Zealand South Line, and was completely rebuilt in 1978–1983 and 2015–2018. It offers S-train services to Copenhagen operated by DSB, local train services to  and Stevns, operated by Lokaltog. In April 2023, DSB started operating regional trains on the Næstved–Køge–Copenhagen route via the high speed Copenhagen–Køge–Ringsted Line.

A fountain, created by the Swedish-born artist Pontus Kjerrman in 1993, located on the small square in front of the station, represents the "catwoman" and the "horseman".
