History
In 1953, radio station KEYJ went on the air. The station's express mission was to serve the Jamestown community (the other local station, KSJB, had developed into a regional station that didn't adequately serve its home city), providing news, sports and market coverage to the city of Jamestown and its immediate environs. For many years, from the mid-1950s until the 1980s, the two competing stations were located directly across the street from each other, each on the second floor of a downtown retail building. In a small market such as Jamestown, without a surplus of radio air talent, it was common for announcers to work different shifts at the two stations, but utilizing a different air name and persona at each one.

KEYJ was originally part of the "KEY" network of radio stations, located throughout the Dakotas, all having "K-E-Y" as the first three letters of their callsign ("KEYZ" in Williston, North Dakota; "KEYA" in Belcort, North Dakota; etc.). The stations were owned by the Ingstad brothers from 1953 until 1969, when KEYJ was sold to its longtime station manager.

KEYJ gained brief fame in 1957, when it was featured in Life Magazine, as the home of the "World's Youngest D-J"; the now world-famous Shadoe Stevens.

KEYJ Incorporated (and its president, Robert L. Richardson) owned and ran the station until 1979, when Richardson sold the operation to Great West Broadcasting. On August 1, 1979, station changed its call letters to KQDJ. Great West was a short-lived operation that lasted only two years. Afterwards, the station went through several owners, eventually winding up back in the Ingstad chain.

In July 2020, KQDJ changed their format from sports to soft adult contemporary, branded as "Jamestown 107.1".

Alumni
Richardson considered part of his original mission to be helping teach young people from the community how to work in broadcasting. To that end, he made a point of hiring students from the local high school and Jamestown College to work at the station.

Among the many broadcasters who started at KEYJ/KQDJ were:
 Shadoe Stevens (real name: Terry Ingstad), world-famous DJ and announcer
 Dick Ingstad (brother of Terry/Shadow), syndicated morning host
 Dan Dean Dewald, KZGF Grand Forks, ND overnights
