In January 2018, Republican incumbent Ed Royce announced his retirement. Royce's retirement created great uncertainty and interest in this election, due to the possibility of two candidates of the same political party winning California's jungle primary.

The primary election resulted in two candidates of different parties, with Republican Assemblywoman Young Kim and Democrat Gil Cisneros coming in first and second place respectively. After the general election, it took several days to gather and tally absentee ballots, but on November 17, Cisneros was the projected winner of the election.

Historical district boundaries
The 39th congressional district was originally one of five reapportioned to California after the 1970 United States census.

From 1993 to 2003, the 39th congressional district was a Republican stronghold. In 2003, this territory was mostly redesignated into the neighboring 40th congressional district and 42nd congressional district. From 2003 to 2013, the 39th district was represented by Linda SÃ¡nchez, who now represents the 38th congressional district.
