Le Kremlin–Bicêtre () is a station of the Paris Métro, serving the Villejuif branch of Line 7.

History 
Le Kremlin–Bicêtre opened on 10 December 1982 following an extension from Maison Blanche and served as the southern terminus of the new branch of line 7 until 28 February 1985 when it was extended to Villejuif Louis Aragon.

This station's noticeable name, often confused with the official residence of the President of the Russian Federation, is actually the name of the commune it is located in. It is derived from a tavern "Au sergent du Kremlin", a meeting place for French war veterans around 1813, and Bicêtre, an alteration of Winchester, England, the bishop who has owned property here.

In 2019, the station was used by 4,062,243 passengers, making it the 112th busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 2,244,686 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 103rd busiest of the Métro network out of 305 stations.
