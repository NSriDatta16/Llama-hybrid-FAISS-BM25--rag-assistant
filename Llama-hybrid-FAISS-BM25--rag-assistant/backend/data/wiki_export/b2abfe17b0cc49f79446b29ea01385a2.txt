Heavy Liquid is a six-CD limited edition boxed set that chronicles the rehearsals and sessions for Raw Power, the third album by rock band The Stooges. Spanning 1972–1974 it also contains live recordings and interviews.

Description
Heavy Liquid was compiled from many tapes, including a recently discovered multi-track master tape that held every note and snippet of studio dialogue from July 1972, plus another recently discovered ¼" tape from March 1973. These two particular tapes were the main reason to get this boxed set since most of the other material had been released in semi-legal releases in various countries.

Three and a fourth partial of the six CDs in the box set hold every note, word, and sound from the sessions. The sessions discs span from Spring of 1972 to July 1973.

Reception
Heavy Liquid was cited as one of the Reissues of the Year for 2005 by The Wire magazine.
