Route description

SR 402 begins at an intersection with SR 420, which heads west as Seminary Road and east as Janneys Lane. Quaker Lane continues south as an unnumbered street past the Clarens mansion to SR 236 (Duke Street). SR 402 heads north as a four-lane undivided highway that passes to the east of the Virginia Theological Seminary and Episcopal High School. The state highway intersects northwest–southeast SR 7 (King Street) and east–west Braddock Road at a triangular six-way intersection; each street intersects the two other streets for a total of three intersections. North of SR 7, SR 402 becomes a divided highway and passes between the Parkfairfax and Fairlington neighborhoods. The state highway's northern terminus is at Shirlington Circle, a roundabout interchange with I-395 (Henry G. Shirley Memorial Highway) on the boundary between the city of Alexandria and Arlington County. The roundabout also includes right-in/right-out intersections with Gunston Road in Alexandria and Campbell Avenue in Arlington, which provides access to The Village at Shirlington commercial area, which includes the Signature Theatre. North of the roundabout interchange, the highway continues north as Shirlington Road through the Shirlington neighborhood of Arlington.
