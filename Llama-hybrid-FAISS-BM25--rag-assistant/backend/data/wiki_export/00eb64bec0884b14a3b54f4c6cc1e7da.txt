I Am Not A Freemdoom is the second album by Masters of the Hemisphere, released in 2000 on Kindercore Records. It is a concept album containing a comic book, for which the songs provide the soundtrack.

Critical reception
Exclaim! called the album a "big bomb," writing that "the music is the lone positive point, and the Masters have a great knack for arranging sounds." The Pitch called it "both an incredibly obtuse and somehow curiously listenable disc, and thatâ€™s doubly true for fans of chamber pop, an admittedly acquired taste."
