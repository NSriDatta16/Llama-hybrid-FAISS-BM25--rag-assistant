Dundee City East (Gaelic: Baile Dhùn Dè an Ear) is a constituency of the Scottish Parliament (Holyrood) covering part of the  Dundee City council area. It elects one Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) by the first past the post method of election. It is one of ten constituencies in the North East Scotland electoral region, which elects seven additional members, in addition to the ten constituency MSPs, to produce a form of proportional representation for the region as a whole.

The constituency was created for the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, and largely replaced the previous seat of Dundee East. Since creation it has been held by Shona Robison of the Scottish National Party; Robison had previously served as the member for Dundee East since the 2003 Scottish Parliament election.

Electoral region

The other nine constituencies of the North East Scotland region are: Aberdeen Central, Aberdeen Donside, Aberdeen South and North Kincardine, Aberdeenshire East, Aberdeenshire West, Angus North and Mearns, Angus South, Banffshire and Buchan Coast and Dundee City West.

The region covers all of Aberdeen City, Aberdeenshire, Angus, Dundee City and part of Moray.

Constituency boundaries and council area 

The Dundee City council area is represented by two constituencies in the Scottish Parliament: Dundee City East and Dundee City West.

A Dundee East constituency was created at the same time as the Scottish Parliament, in 1999, with the name and boundaries of the existing Westminster constituency. In 2005 the boundaries of the Westminster (House of Commons) constituency were subject to some alteration, and no longer correspond to Holyrood constituencies. The current Holyrood boundaries were introduced for the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, with the former Dundee East being renamed and redrawn slightly to exclude the 'Hebrides' neighbourhood at Claverhouse just west of the A90 road and include new housing developments north of the A92 road near Barnhill. The constituency consists of the following electoral wards:

In full: East End, The Ferry
In part: Coldside, Maryfield, North East (shared with Dundee City West)
