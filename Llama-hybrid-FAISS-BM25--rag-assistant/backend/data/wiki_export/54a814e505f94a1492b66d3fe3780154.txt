Los Miserables is a Chilean punk rock band formed in the early 1990s shortly after the demise of the military regime of Augusto Pinochet. The band is known for its songs charged with strong left-wing political ideas and anti-establishment commentary. The band has clearly presented itself as activist in its work with major participation in political events, international charity concerts, human rights events, and volunteer work in impoverished Chilean communities. The band has modeled itself in some ways after the famed Chilean band Los Prisioneros, who left a void after their initial break-up in 1990.

The band achieved major success in Chile in the mid-1990s, and is well known in Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico. They have recorded 8 albums, including three live albums, and received gold records in Chile. The band has also contributed songs to major Chilean movie soundtracks including the main song for the Chilean film El Leyton, a film by famed director Gonzalo Justiniano, of the films B-Happy (2003), Amnesia (1994), and Caluga o Menta (1990). They have also performed in tribute albums to Victor Jara, Violeta Parra, and Los Prisioneros.
