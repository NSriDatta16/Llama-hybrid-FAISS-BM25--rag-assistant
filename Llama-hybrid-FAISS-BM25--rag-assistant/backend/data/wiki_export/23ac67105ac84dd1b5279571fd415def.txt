The Bukit Panjang Single Member Constituency is a Single Member Constituency (SMC) located in the western area of Singapore. The current Member of Parliament for the constituency is from the  People's Action Party (PAP) Liang Eng Hwa.

History
The seat consists the main portion of Bukit Panjang (Blks 101-129, 2xx and 4xx Fajar) and was reformed in the 2006 electoral boundary redraw. Bukit Panjang SMC existed from 1959 to 1991 when it was absorbed into the Sembawang Group Representation Constituency (GRC). In 2001, the seat was moved from Sembawang GRC to Holland–Bukit Panjang GRC. The 2006 redrawn boundaries carved out Bukit Panjang to form the current constituency and the GRC was renamed Holland–Bukit Timah GRC. In the 2020 Singapore general election, PAP's Liang defeated Singapore Democratic Party's Paul Tambyah by a narrow margin of 2,509 votes and it was the closest result in a SMC for that election.
