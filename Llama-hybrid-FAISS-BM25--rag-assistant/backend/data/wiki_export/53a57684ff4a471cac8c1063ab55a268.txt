This is a list of media outlets in the city of Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

Radio

The city of Calgary has 33 terrestrial radio stations in which 8 are on the AM frequency and around 30 on the FM frequency.

On November 9, 2011, a number of applications were filed to the CRTC for new radio stations to serve Calgary.

Television

CTV Two Alberta ceased broadcasting over-the-air in Calgary on August 31, 2011.

The incumbent cable television provider in Calgary is Shaw Cable. Network programming from the United States is received on cable via  affiliates from Spokane, Washington.  While prime time in most of Canada runs from 8 pm to 11 pm, American prime time shows on weekdays run from 9 pm to midnight in Calgary, since Spokane is in the Pacific Time Zone.  Although Calgary is in the Mountain Time Zone, many of the American cities closer to Calgary didn't have full network service until the late 1980s.  Calgary has more than double the population of the Spokane stations' American coverage area.  In particular, Spokane's PBS member station, KSPS-TV, has long relied on viewership in Calgary.  Except for PBS, HDTV network programming is from Seattle, not Spokane.

On digital cable, U.S. network programming (in standard definition) is available from Detroit, Michigan in the Eastern Time Zone.  Prime time shows on weekdays run from 6 to 9 pm. Via digital cable, Calgary customers can also receive broadcasts from other CTV and CBC markets across Canada.
