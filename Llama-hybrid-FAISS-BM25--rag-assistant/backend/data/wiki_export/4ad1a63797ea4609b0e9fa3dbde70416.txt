History
The monastic hermitage of Desertmartin was originally dedicated to Saint Martin of Tours. The remains of the ancient parish church are in the townland of Knocknagin at the east side of the village.

When County Coleraine was created in 1585, its administration was meant to be carried out in the town of Coleraine. However, the jail and courthouse were built in Desertmartin.

On 19 May 1922, during the Irish War of Independence, a mob of unionists and Ulster Special Constables attacked and burned many Catholic homes and businesses in Desertmartin, in revenge for the burning of a unionist-owned mill. Special Constables took four Catholic men from their homes outside the village and summarily executed them by the roadside.
