History
The first documented evidence of "Ehingas" appears in 773 in a deed of donation from the Freising Bishop. Eching has belonged to the closed jurisdiction of Ottenburg for centuries. During an administrative reform in 1818 Eching Bavaria attained its autonomy as a municipality. With the building of the autobahn from 1936 to 1938 the area evolved from an agricultural into a more industrial structure. After the administrative reform of 1978 Günzenhausen, Ottenburg and Deutenhausen were brought into the municipality Eching. The establishment of the business park Eching, which was founded together with the neighboring municipality Neufahrn bei Freising and the link to the Munich International Airport via the Munich S-Bahn developed Eching into a modern suburban municipality.

Coat of arms
