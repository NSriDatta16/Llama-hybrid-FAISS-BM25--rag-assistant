Background and recording 
In 1997, Thalía released her fifth studio album, Amor a la Mexicana, which was certified 2× Platinum in Argentina, Chile, Spain and the United States. Later, she starred the Mexican telenovela Rosalinda, in 1999. During this time, the singer started recording her sixth album, claiming that, "she wanted to prepare a quality product, so it took almost a year to make it. It's true that it took a while but it worth the wait, because it comes as the album title says, 'triumphing' strongly internationally". For the album, Thalía wrote eight tracks, with the help of other songwriters, such as Kike Santander and Roberto Blades, whilst Emilio Estefan Jr. produced the album. EMI Latin's press manager Rosario Valeriano claimed that, "All we know is that Mr. Stefan trusted Thalía, when it comes to writing her own music, and this shows that aside from singing very well, she can also show how good she is on the writing part". In order to promote Arrasando, Thalía visited several countries in the Americas, Europe and Asia.

Composition 
In Arrasando, Thalia experiments with different music genres, besides the traditional latin pop, the album also takes large influence on dance-pop and rap. Lyrically, it is an album that deals with her own life experiences. EMI's press manager claimed that, "This album, which has 12 tracks, will supply everyone's needs, because it has Latin tracks, such as the Brazilian batucada, and others that they will enjoy." He further added, "Something that people will like is a song in the vein of Cher, where Thalia does an excellent job. Actually, this song and the other ones have different styles." Thalia herself commented about the album's multiple styles, saying, "My music has always been Latin pop, but in this record it has a dance vibe, a little bit of rap and R&B, in a way that they blend perfectly."

The album opens with the slow ballad "Entre el mar y una estrella" ("Between the Sea and a Star"), which was praised by critics, who called it a "majestic" song. "Regresa a mí" ("Come Back to Me") follows, with its dance-pop style and Thalia's autotuned vocals, while the third track "Reencarnación" ("Reincarnation"), co-written by Draco Rosa, is a heavily dance-inspired track about reincarnation. The fourth and title track, the techno-infused "Arrasando" ("Razing"), was considered "tailor-made for peak-hour club play". The fifth track is the soothing "No Hay Que Llorar" ("There's no Need to Cry"), while "Tumba la Casa" follows the high-energy style of previous songs. The album also recorded a version of Miriam Makeba's hit "Pata Pata", while the closing track, "Rosalinda", the theme song of Thalía's soap opera of the same name, being the most traditionally Mexican song on the set.

Critical reception 

The album received mainly positive reviews from music critics. Jason Birchmeier of Allmusic gave the album a rating of 3.5. out of 5 stars, claiming that Arrasando, "firmly established her as a full-fledged superstar in 2000," calling the album "a trendy one, very much of its time – that is, right at the turn of the millennium, when high-intensity, trancy dance music was all the rage in fashionable circles." Birchemeier also noted the "abundance of synthesizers and dance beats, as well as its ecstatic choruses, which seem to reach for the stars song after song." He also noted that "it certainly differs from its predecessor (Amor a la Mexicana) and successor (Thalia). All are among her best efforts, with Arrasando being probably the most contrived. It's more adventurous than the streamlined Thalia, yet it's not as free-flowing as Amor a la Mexicana. Of the three, it surely sounds the most dated, and for all these reasons, it's a strangely curious album, very evocative of its time."
 
Joey Guerra wrote for Amazon.com that the album is "the singer's most focused collection to date", where "Thalia and Estefan blend salsa, rap, reggae, cumbia, and aggressive club beats into one irresistible mix." Guerra called the songs "Regresa a Mi", "Pata Pata", and "Siempre Hay Carino" "infectious", claiming that "Thalia proves equally adept at ballads, particularly on the majestic first single, 'Entre el Mar y una Estrella'." "Arrasando" was nominated for two Latin Grammy Awards of 2001, one in Best Female Pop Vocal Album (losing to Christina Aguilera's debut Spanish album Mi Reflejo) and "Best Engineered Album" (which it won). It was also nominated for Pop Album of the Year at the Lo Nuestro Awards of 2001, losing to Paulina by fellow Mexican singer Paulina Rubio.
