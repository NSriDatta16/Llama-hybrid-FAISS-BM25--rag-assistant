Cause for Conflict is the seventh studio album by German thrash metal band Kreator released on 1 August, 1995. 

The record continued the experimentation with industrial music that they started on previous album, Renewal, but brought back more of their thrash metal sound. This was also the only Kreator album to feature Joe Cangelosi as the replacement of original drummer Jürgen "Ventor" Reil, who would return to the band in 1996. This the only Kreator album to not feature Ventor. This was also the band's first album to feature bassist Christian Giesler and the last to feature guitarist Frank "Blackfire" Gosdzik.

Release
In March 2018, German heavy metal record label Noise released a remastered edition of the album and made it available on CD and vinyl and as digital download. The release contains three bonus tracks and liner notes.
