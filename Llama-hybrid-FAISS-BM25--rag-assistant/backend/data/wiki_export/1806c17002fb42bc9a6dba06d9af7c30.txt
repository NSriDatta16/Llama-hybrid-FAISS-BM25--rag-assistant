The 213th Regional Support Group (213th RSG) is a unit of the Pennsylvania Army National Guard (PA ARNG). The 213th RSG mission is to provide command and control of the twenty-two separate Pennsylvania Army National Guard units assigned to the headquarters for operational and administrative control. This force consist of more than 1,000 soldiers from the eastern and central parts of the state. The 213th RSG is one of the two major commands in the Pennsylvania Army National Guard, the other being the 28th Infantry Division (Keystone).

History
The Group traces antecedents to 1849, but the designation '213th Support Group' did not appear until 1975, and the '213th Regional Support Group' until 2011. The 1st and 2nd Battalions, 176th Air Defense Artillery, were part of the 218th Artillery Group (AD) from 1 June 1959 to 1 April 1963, after which the 2-176 joined the 213th Artillery Group (Air Defense) until 17 February 1968, and thereafter until 1974 just with the PA ARNG.

Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 213th Artillery Group was converted and re-designated 1 December 1971 as Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment, 213th Military Police Group, and then, four years later, again converted and re-designated 1 April 1975 as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 213th Support Group.

The units of the 213th Group continually provide support to units and organizations throughout the United States and the world. In 2009, the Group provided abbreviated Reception, Staging, and Onward Integration services for the G-20 Summit in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, processing over 2,500 troops into the Area of Responsibility. In 2007–2008 the Group deployed to Balad, Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. During this mission, it served as one of five sustainment brigades assigned to the 316th Expeditionary Sustainment Command headquartered in Coraopolis, Pennsylvania. In 2005, immediately after Hurricane Katrina made landfall, the Group quickly deployed to Metairie, New Orleans in support of Katrina Relief, acting as a command and control for the Intermediate Staging Base at Zephyr Stadium. A tour in Afghanistan from 2003–2004 found the area support group providing command and control for bases in Bargram, Kandahar, and Kabal, Afghanistan along with an additional command and control cell in Uzbekistan.

In 1996 the group provided combat service support to an active-duty brigade during a field training exercise at the Joint Readiness Training Center, Fort Polk, Louisiana. In 1997, the group Headquarters Company sent 50 members to Hungary to support the Stabilisation Force in Bosnia and Herzegovina (S-FOR). Throughout the past decade, Group subordinate units have performed yeoman's work in fighting the War on Terror. During blizzards, floods and civil emergencies, all the units of the Group stand ready to assist the communities and people of the Commonwealth.
