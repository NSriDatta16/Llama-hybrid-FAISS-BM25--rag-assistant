On November 26, 2021, the MS Hamburg arrived in the Port of Buenos Aires coming from Cape Verde. The port was operating under a new, more restrictive, protocol for ships arriving from Africa, due to the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant. However, according to Argentine newspaper Clar√≠n, the Argentine authorities thought Cape Verde was in Asia and not in Africa, and let the ship enter the port without applying the correct protocol. According to the same report, the authorities took 12 hours to realize their mistake. The Argentine authorities, however, denied the mistake, stating that all the passengers in the ship were tested for Covid and that the results returned negative.
