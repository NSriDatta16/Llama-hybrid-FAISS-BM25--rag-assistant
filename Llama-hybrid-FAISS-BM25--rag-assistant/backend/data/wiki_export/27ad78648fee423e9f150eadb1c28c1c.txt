Wee Papa Girl Rappers were a British female rap duo, that found chart success in the late 1980s. They were sisters Sandra and Samantha Lawrence aka Total S and TY tim born 4 years apart, with Total S being the elder

Overview 
Before being signed to Jive Records, the two sisters were backing singers for Feargal Sharkey. Sandra Lawrence (aka Total S) and Samantha Lawrence (aka TY Tim) are best remembered for the single "Wee Rule" – more inspired by reggae and dancehall than rap/hip hop – which reached number 6 on the UK Singles Chart in October 1988. Another of their singles, "Heat it Up" featuring 2 Men and a Drum Machine, reached number 21 on the UK Singles Chart in June 1988. It also featured an acid house/techno style remix from Inner City's Kevin Saunderson. They released two albums on Jive Records before first splitting up in early 1991. A later reincarnation as The Wee Papas saw limited returns.

The duo got their name "Wee Papa" from the Saint Lucia French Creole expression "Oui Papa", which their father frequently uttered. Their father hailed from the Caribbean island of Saint Lucia.

Wee Papa Girl Rappers also worked with Greek singer, Michalis Rakintzis.
