The Upper Highway Area is a region west of the city of Durban in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. It is the suburban western part of the Greater Durban metropolitan area and extends from Kloof in the east to Botha’s Hill in the west. 

It includes the main towns of Hillcrest, Gillitts and Kloof and the smaller areas of Assagay, Botha’s Hill, Everton and Waterfall.

The Upper Highway Area is named after the M13 highway (King Cetshwayo Highway) that passes through the area as well as its location above Fields Hill and the Kloof escarpment. The M13 connects the area to the Lower Highway Area of Pinetown and Westville as well as the city of Durban.
