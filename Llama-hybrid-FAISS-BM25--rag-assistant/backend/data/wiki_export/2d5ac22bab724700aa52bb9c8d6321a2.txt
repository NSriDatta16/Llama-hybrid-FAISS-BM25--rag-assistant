Burfat () is a Sindhi Sammat clan originally from the Lasbela and Kirthar (Kohistan) mountains of the Sindh province of Pakistan.

Various sub-castes of the Burfats, notably the Hamalanis, Loharanis, Baparanis, Musas, Kanaras, Dudhars, Shanas, Aqilanis, and Lalanis, live in Thana Bulla Khan tehsil. The Burfats are quite prominent; they ruled the area for many centuries and left their imprints in the form of monuments in various villages and towns in Thana Bula Khan.

The famous female ruler of Lasbela was "Mai Chagli" who was wife of Malik Pahar Khan Burfat, the cultural hero of the Burfats After the death of Malik Pahar Khan Burfat, his wife Mai Chagli became the ruler of Lasbela. The Roonjha tribe served as the administrators of Mai Chagli. They feared the rising power of the Jams of Kanrach and in order to crush the Jams of Karachi valley, they killed Jam Digar one of the chiefs of the tribe. In order to avenge the death of his brother, Jam Aali along with his tribesmen invaded the capital of Mai Chaglai and killed those who murdered his brother Jam Digar. Mai Chagli took her infant son Malik Izzat Khan and went to her ancestral place Taung and later on shifted to Kotri where her tomb is located just behind the government degree college.
