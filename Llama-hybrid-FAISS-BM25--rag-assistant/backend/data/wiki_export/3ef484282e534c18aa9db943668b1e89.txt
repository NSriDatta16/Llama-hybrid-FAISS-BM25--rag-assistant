Music video 
The music video for the song "MakeDamnSure" (directed by Marc Klasfeld) switches between scenes of the band playing in a wind tunnel and scenes of violence and destruction (such as a car crashing from a cliff, or bombs exploding in a village).  The wind in the tunnel gradually increases, and when the loud chorus part repeats for the last time, it almost blows them away.  As the song slows down, the violent images are replayed, but this time, they are transformed into a short scene considered to be happy, i.e. the scene of the police officers using fire hoses on protesters turns into a scene of a woman watering her plants, and the Cincinnati Reds' former stadium being demolished turns into a shore view. The video ends as Adam Lazzara, who's viewed singing in profile, slowly turns into a boy, who blows on the microphone, which has turned into a dandelion, whose seeds blow away, and then starts running in an open field, as the camera pans upwards and the video fades away.

The video was premiered on MTV2 on April 3, 2006.
