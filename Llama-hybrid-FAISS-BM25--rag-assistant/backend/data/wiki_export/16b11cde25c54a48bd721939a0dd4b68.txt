History
The road was evolved from a causeway across Causeway Bay (Tung Lo Wan) in the 1880s. Before the construction of the road, another road Tung Lo Wan Road was the only road connecting the two sides of the bay. In 1883, Hong Kong Government reclaimed the bay within the causeway and the causeway was renovated as Causeway along the sea shore. Its Cantonese name  (ko sze wai dou) was after the English pronunciation of the road. Trams run to and from the embankment. In 1951, the north of road was reclaimed for Victoria Park.

When created, the road was the only way to get from the Eastern District to Central. Causeway Road's name comes from "way" meaning "road" in English as well as its being a primitive road made from stone.
