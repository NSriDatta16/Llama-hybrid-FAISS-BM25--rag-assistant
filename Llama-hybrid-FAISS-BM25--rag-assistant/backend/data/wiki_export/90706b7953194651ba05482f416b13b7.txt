Background
In 1963, the Law Building (previously known as the Arts Building) opened, facing onto Museum Avenue and Park Place in Cardiff. The law school attracts students from all over the world. It provides a range of undergraduate law courses, all of which enable students to complete the foundation modules that constitute the academic stage of training necessary to become a solicitor or barrister. It also offers postgraduate LLM courses, criminal law courses and research degrees for those who want to study an aspect of law at a more in-depth level.

Academically, Cardiff Law School offers Bar Professional Training Course and legal practice courses. Both of these courses have received the Bar Standard Board's highest ratings. The law school offers courses for full-time, part-time and distance learning students. Cardiff Law School also provides many extra-curricular opportunities by having a close partnership with lawyers and other law-related organisations. This helps the school to  train their students to develop the skills, knowledge, and experience needed for their career. The school also has law career advisers that organise comprehensive programs, presentations and advisory sessions for students needing employment or career help.
