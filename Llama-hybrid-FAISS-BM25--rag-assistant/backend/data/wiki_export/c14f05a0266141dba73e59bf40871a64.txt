Lung Cheung Road () is a major road in New Kowloon, Hong Kong. It forms part of Route 7 linking Kwun Tong Road at Ngau Chi Wan and Ching Cheung Road near Tai Wo Ping. It is a dual 3-lane carriageway running in the east-west direction for its entire length.

Kwun Tong (connected by Kwun Tong Road) in Eastern Kowloon was the main manufacturing centre of Hong Kong during the 1960s. To provide a more efficient link to the Kwai Tsing Container Terminals and Tsuen Wan, two roads were built along the hills to the north of developed Kowloon. Tai Po Road's New Territories and New Kowloon parts divide between Ching Cheung Road and Lung Cheung Road.

The section of between Wong Tai Sin and Choi Hung of the Kwun Tong line was built under the road.
