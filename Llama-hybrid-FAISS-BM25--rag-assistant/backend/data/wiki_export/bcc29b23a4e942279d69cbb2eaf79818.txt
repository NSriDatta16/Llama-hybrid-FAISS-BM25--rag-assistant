The Commonwealth Water Polo Championships are held in conjunction with the Commonwealth Games, although they are no longer included in the Commonwealth Games programme. They are in a round robin format.

Water polo and the Commonwealth Games 
Although recognised as a Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) sport, water polo has only featured in the Games once at the 1950 British Empire Games in Auckland, New Zealand. Only Australia and New Zealand took part, where Australia won all three matches: 11-4, 13-2, 5-2. Water polo is acknowledged by the CGF as a sport for potential inclusion in future Games with further development in Commonwealth countries.

Malta 2018
Malta were due to host the 2018 Championships from 23-30 September, but in June 2018 decided they were unable to host, leaving too short a time to plan an alternative.  The 2018 Championships therefore did not take place.
