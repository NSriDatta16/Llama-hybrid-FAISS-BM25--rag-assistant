History 
The school was founded in 1878 by a community of nuns from New York, with the objective to educate children of immigrants, primarily German. On March 7, 1942, SDA moved to its present location on Kennedy Boulevard. In 1994, a new wing was open with new computer labs, science and language labs. The school celebrated its 135th birthday on October 23, 2013. In 2015, Saint Dominic Academy received a generous donation of a building located on Fairmount Avenue in Jersey City. This building was once the Jersey City Women's Club and is now known as Siena Hall, which opened in April 2016 and is used for school-related events.

Saint Dominic Academy is a member of the New Jersey Association of Independent Schools.
