Early life
Martin was born as Vincent Markesteijn in the Netherlands about 1955, and raised in Australia from the age of 7.

Career
Martin began as a film editor on police drama series Homicide. His editing career had begun at the age of 16 at Crawford Productions.  He quickly moved on to directing television series for the same company.

Starting in the 1970s, he became a regular face on Australian television, with both guest starring television series roles, and regular roles in several soap operas as well as films with Gerard Kennedy, Judy Morris, Nicole Kidman, and Carmen Duncan amongst others. He played two different characters (who were neither related nor lookalikes), in teen soap Class of '74, then completed stints in soaps Number 96 (as David Palmer), The Restless Years (as Craig Garside), The Young Doctors (as Dr. Richard Quinlan), Sons and Daughters (as Matt Kennedy), E Street (as Steven Richardson, better known as "Mr Bad") and Home and Away (as Phil Bryant).

During the early 1980's he also performed with his band New Toys as lead singer in venues around Sydney.

His over 30-year campaign for Beaurepaires New Zealand has won international advertising awards and places him as one of the most recognised performers in New Zealand. He has a large fan base in New Zealand and is the longest serving retail brand spokesperson in New Zealand television history.

He played Wayne in the 2012 New Zealand family film Kiwi Flyer.
