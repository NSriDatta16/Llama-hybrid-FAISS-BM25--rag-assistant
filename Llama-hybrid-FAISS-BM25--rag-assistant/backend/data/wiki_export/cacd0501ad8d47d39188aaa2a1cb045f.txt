Georgia's 3rd congressional district is a congressional district in the U.S. state of Georgia. The district is currently represented by Republican Drew Ferguson.  The district's boundaries have been redrawn following the 2010 census, which granted an additional congressional seat to Georgia. The first election using the new district boundaries (listed below) were the 2012 congressional elections.

The district is based in west-central Georgia. It includes most of the southern suburbs of Atlanta–where most of its population is located–as well as the wealthier (and more demographically Caucasian) portions of Columbus and its northern suburbs.
