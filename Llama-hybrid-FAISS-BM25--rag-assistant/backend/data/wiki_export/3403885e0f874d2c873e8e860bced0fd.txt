Bowman played just six games in 1996, starting each at centre and scoring two tries.

In 1997, he played 10 games and scored two tries and in 1998, played just the first six games before missing the rest of the season through injury. In 1999, Bowman played 16 games for the club, the majority of those at , and was named the club's Player of the Year.

In 2000, Bowman had a breakout season in which he started 20 games at centre, scoring eight tries, and was named the Cowboys' Player of the Year, an award he shared with Julian O'Neill. In May, he made his State of Origin debut for Queensland, becoming the club's second Queensland representative and their first homegrown Queensland player.
