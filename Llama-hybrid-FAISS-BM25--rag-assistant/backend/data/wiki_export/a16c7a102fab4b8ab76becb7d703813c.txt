Controversies

Coal mining in Australia 

The Adani Group launched in 2014, with the support of a part of the Australian Government and Queensland, a mining and rail project (Carmichael coal mine) in Carmichael in Queensland's Galilee Basin for $21.5 billion over the life of the project, i.e. 60 years. This mine is one of many coal mines in Queensland, Australia. Its annual capacity would be 10 Mt of thermal coal.

This project will occupy an area of . In response to activist pressure some international banks refused to finance it, and in November 2018, Adani Australia announced that the Carmichael project would be 100% financed by Adani Group resources. In July 2019, the project received its final approvals from the Australian Government and construction of the mine commenced.

In 2015, the then-head of Adani's Australian mining division came under scrutiny due to his association with a mining pollution incident in Zambia, sparking renewed concerns about Adani's suitability to manage the Carmichael coal mine. According to a collaborative report from Environmental Justice Australia, Jeyakumar Janakaraj held significant positions at a mining company that faced criminal charges related to the contamination of the Kafue River in Zambia. This occurred before he assumed leadership role of Adani's operations in Australia. Specifically, Janakaraj served as the operations director at Konkola Copper Mines in 2010, when the company faced legal charges concerning the discharge of hazardous wastewater into the river. However, the Australian government characterized Adani's omission of Janakaraj's involvement in the African pollution incident as a "mistake." Although, under section 489 of Australia's Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, presenting inaccurate or deceptive information could potentially constitute an offense, the federal government has opted not to pursue any legal action against Adani.

The Australian Government has been taken to the Federal Court of Australia by the Australian Conservation Foundation twice, once in 2018 and once in March 2020 (still ongoing ), relating to its contravention and alleged contravention of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 with respect to the impact of the Carmichael mine on groundwater and the country's water resources.

In 2020, Adani Mining changed its name to Bravus Mining and Resources.

On 29 December 2021, Bravus announced that the first shipment of high-quality coal from the Carmichael mine had been assembled at the North Queensland Export Terminal (NQXT) in Bowen ready for export as planned.

Cronyism 
Chairman and MD Gautam Adani has been described as being close to former Chief Minister of Gujarat and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). This has led to allegations of cronyism as his firms have won many Indian energy and infrastructure government contracts. In 2012, an Indian government auditor accused Modi of giving low cost fuel from a Gujarat state-run gas company to the Adani group and other companies. In Jharkhand, the BJP-led state government made an exception to its energy policy for Adani's Godda power plant. Both the Adani Group and Modi's government have denied allegations of cronyism.

Leverage 
The company's corporate debt totaled $30 billion in 2022. In August 2022, CreditSights, a unit of Fitch Ratings, warned that Adani's recent aggressive expansion had hurt the group's cash flow and credit metrics. It also stated that a potential "worst-case scenario" could lead the group to end up in a debt trap and a potential default. The CreditSights report garnered significant attention for its dire assessment of Adani's "deeply overleveraged” book; after outreach by Adani, CreditSights softened its language but kept its main conclusion.

Stock market rigging 
In 2007, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) prohibited multiple Adani companies from engaging in the purchase or sale of securities for a period of two years. This action was taken due to their involvement in a manipulation scheme that occurred between 1999 and 2001 to artificially influence stock prices. This manipulation was carried out through entities overseen by Ketan Parekh, the stockbroker who was the main accused in India’s biggest stock market scandal. After paying a fine of $140,000, the companies were eventually permitted to recommence their trading activities.

Tax evasion 
On 27 February 2010, Central Bureau of Investigation arrested Rajesh Adani, managing director of Adani Enterprises Ltd., on charges of custom duty evasion amounting to ₹80 lakh.

In August 2017, Indian customs alleged the Adani Group was diverting millions of funds from the company's books to Adani family tax havens overseas. Adani was accused of using a Dubai shell company to divert the funds. The details of a $235 million diversion were obtained and published by The Guardian. In 2014, the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence mapped out a complex money trail from India through South Korea and Dubai, and eventually to an offshore company in Mauritius allegedly owned by Vinod Shantilal Adani, the older brother of Gautam Adani. Same year, DRI forwarded a letter to the then SEBI chairperson,U. K. Sinha, along with a CD containing evidence suggesting the improper diversion of Rs. 2,323 crore. Additionally, they provided two investigative notes, cautioning that the group might be involved in manipulating the stock market through funds allegedly siphoned off using the strategy of overvaluing power equipment imports. However, SEBI did not publicly acknowledge the receipt of this letter and the accompanying evidence from DRI until September 2023, when it was disclosed before the Supreme Court of India.

Stock manipulation and accounting fraud allegations
In January 2023, Hindenburg Research published the findings of a two-year investigation alleging that Adani had engaged in market manipulation and accounting malpractices. The report accused Adani of pulling "the largest con in corporate history" and "brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades". Hindenburg also disclosed that it was holding short positions on Adani Group companies. Bonds and shares of companies associated with Adani experienced a decline of more than $104 billion in market value after the accusations, representing approximately half of the market value. Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman said Hindenburg's Adani Report was "highly credible and extremely well researched." Adani denied the fraud allegations as without merit.

On 29 January, Adani released a 413 page response to the Hindenburg report, calling Hindenburg’s conduct a "calculated securities fraud" and the report a "calculated attack on India, the independence, integrity and quality of Indian institutions, and the growth story and ambition of India." Hindenburg characterized the response as failing to engage with the issues raised by its initial report, and an exercise in obfuscation under the garb of nationalism. On 1 February, Adani cancelled its planned $2.5 billion (Rs 20,000 crore) Follow-on Public Offer (FPO) citing market volatility, and announced that it would return the FPO money to investors. Reserve Bank of India sought details from banks on exposure to Adani firms. Citigroup's wealth unit stopped extending margin loans to its clients against securities of Adani Group. Credit Suisse Group AG stopped accepting bonds of Adani Group companies as collateral for margin loans to its private banking clients. S&P Dow Jones Indices removed Adani Enterprises from its sustainability index.

Norway's Oil Fund, which had already shed a bulk of its Adani shares pre-Hindenburg report, divested its entire stake following the report.

On 19 May, on prima facie, a committee formed by the Supreme Court of India communicated its inability to conclude regarding the existence of a regulatory failure concerning the accusation of stock price manipulation by the group. This was primarily due to the insufficient information provided in the explanations by the SEBI's investigation. Earlier on 29 April, SEBI requested a six-month extension to conclude its investigation, instead of the initially given two months provided on 2 March. However, the Supreme Court granted a three-month extension and directed SEBI to complete the probe by 14 August 2023.

On 24 June, 2023, Adani Group's share value took a significant dive, following reports that United States Department of Justice and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission were investigating the corporation's communications with its U.S.-based investors, spurred by a report from a short seller.

On 31 August 2023, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project put forth allegations asserting that a substantial amount of funds, in the hundreds of millions of dollars, were directed into publicly traded stocks of the Adani Group. These investments purportedly occurred by means of investment funds situated in Mauritius, which are characterized as possessing a lack of transparency. These funds were reportedly associated with partners connected to the promoter family. Supporting evidence presented in the report indicates that these entities engaged in protracted activities involving the acquisition and divestiture of Adani stock through offshore mechanisms, thereby concealing their active participation. This covert engagement apparently yielded significant financial gains. Additionally, the documentation suggests that the overseeing investment firm compensated a company belonging to Vinod Adani for advisory services pertinent to their investment pursuits.

In October 2023, the National Financial Reporting Authority initiated an investigation, reaching out to several audit firms involved in examining the financial records of the Adani Group's listed companies.

Manipulating Wikipedia entries 
A February 2023 article in The Signpost said that the Adani team has been manipulating Wikipedia entries using sock puppet accounts to insert promotional material and remove or edit criticism.

Sports
In addition to its industrial interests, the Adani group owns several sports teams, such as the Gujarat Giants team in the Pro Kabaddi League. In 2022, Adani Group acquired the Gulf Giants team in UAE's International League T20. In August 2022, It also purchased a franchise in Legends League Cricket. In 2023, it purchased a team in the Women's Premier League based in Ahmedabad.

Teams owned by Adani Group 

Adani also sponsored various other sports initiatives, including a 2016 nationwide programme to prepare athletes for Rio Olympics called Garv Hai (). It was re-launched for a second time to groom athletes for 2020 Tokyo Olympics, 2022 Asian Games and Commonwealth Games. The programme focuses on archery, shooting, athletics, boxing, and wrestling.
