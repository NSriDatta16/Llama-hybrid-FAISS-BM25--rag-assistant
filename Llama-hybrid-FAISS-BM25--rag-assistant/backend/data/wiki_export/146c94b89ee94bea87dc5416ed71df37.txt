After starring at Clarke Central High School in Georgia, where he was a four-time all-area performer, he played college soccer at Duke University. He became a regular starter and an all-ACC performer as a sophomore in 2003, then again in 2004 and 2005. In 2004, he was named to the NCAA Final Four All Tournament team. Camp was named to the Herman Trophy watch list in 2004 and 2005 and earned all-America honors as a junior and senior, finishing his collegiate career with 24 goals and the ACC Tournament MVP award as a senior.
