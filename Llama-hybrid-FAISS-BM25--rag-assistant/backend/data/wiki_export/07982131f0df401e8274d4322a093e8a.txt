Michael John Scriven (; born 1928; d. 2023) was a British-born Australian polymath and academic philosopher, best known for his contributions to the theory and practice of evaluation.

Biography
Scriven was born in the UK and grew up in Melbourne, Australia. He held BSc (1948) and MS (1950) degrees in mathematics from the University of Melbourne, where he was in residence at Trinity College from 1946, winning an entrance scholarship. He then completed a doctorate in philosophy from the University of Oxford (1956).

Scriven was a president of the American Educational Research Association and the American Evaluation Association.  He was also an editor and co-founder of the Journal of MultiDisciplinary Evaluation/. He was latterly a distinguished professor at Claremont Graduate University in California.

He spent most of his career in the United States. He became a full Professor at the age of 32. His major appointments were:
Swarthmore College (Assistant Professor, 1956–60)
Indiana University (Professor of Philosophy, 1960–1966)
University of California, Berkeley (Professor of Philosophy and later of Education 1966–78)
University of San Francisco (Professor, 1978–82)
University of Western Australia (Professor of Education 1982–89)
Pacific Graduate School of Psychology (1989–1992)
Western Michigan University (1994–95, 2004–07)
Claremont Graduate University (1997–2002 and 2007–)
University of Auckland (Professor of Evaluation 2003–4)

Scholarly contributions
Scriven made significant contributions in the fields of philosophy, psychology, critical thinking, mathematics, and, most notably, evaluation theory and the establishment of evaluation as a transdiscipline. In 1971, he called for the replacement of 'goal achievement' in evaluation with the evaluation of whether a programme is able to meet the needs of its intended beneficiaries. "It seemed to me, in short, that consideration and evaluation of goals was an unnecessary but also a possibly contaminating step. I began to work on an alternative approach – simply, the evaluation of actual effects against  (typically) a profile of demonstrated needs in this region of education." (1972, p.1) 

Scriven's work in education influenced the work of many scholars, including that of Robert E. Stake, Ernest R. House, Benjamin Bloom, and Gene V Glass.

He wrote over 400 scholarly publications and served on the editorial review boards of 42 journals.

Scriven number
In 2012, an article published in the Journal of MultiDisciplinary Evaluation posed the necessity of a Scriven number. Similar to an Erdős number, a Scriven number describes a person's degree of separation from Dr. Scriven through published collaborations directly with him or with others who have collaborated with him. Michael Scriven holds the unique Scriven number of 0 while any persons publishing directly with him hold a Scriven number of 1. In addition, those who have published with those individuals who have directly published with Dr. Scriven hold a Scriven number of 2. This algorithmic format continues indefinitely. For those published with multiple papers with paths to Dr. Scriven, the shortest path will serve as the Scriven number. This type of number is hypothesized to help centralize the field of evaluation.
