History

The Panteion University has a long history of a creative development linked to the course of higher education and the development of social sciences in Greece.

It was founded in 1927 under the name School of Political Sciences, due to the envisagement of two persons who had studied at the Free School of Political Sciences in Paris (Sciences Po), Georgios Fragoudis and Alexandros Pantos. Pavlos Kountouriotis, the president of Greece at the time, inaugurated the central building of the university, which functioned for the first time on 18 November 1930, attended by 200 students. Alexandros Pantos bequeathed his fortune to the school, which was republished by the prime minister of Greece, Eleftherios Venizelos, making the institute stable in the academical scene of the country.

In 1931 the school was renamed to Panteios School of Political Sciences.

At the beginning, the contribution of the minister for national education, George Papandreou, was very important for the school, which consisted of two departments, the Political-Historical and the Social-Economical, while the studies were planned for six semesters. In 1936 the school was recognised as a "public utility of higher education" and in 1937 it was turned into a "legal person of public law". In 1951 the two departments were renamed to the Department of Political Science and Department of Public Administration, respectively, while the course of studies expanded to eight semesters in 1963.

After the reorganization of the Greek educational system in 1983, the Panteios School was divided into three departments: Political Science and International Studies, Public Administration, Sociology. In 1989 the School was renamed to its current name, Panteion University of Social and Political Sciences, and five new departments were created, these of: Communication and Mass Media, Psychology, Social Policy and Social Anthropology, Economic and Regional development, General Department of Law.

In the 1990s, two of the previous departments were split into two: Political Science and International Studies into: a) Political Science and History, b) International and European Studies, and Social Policy and Social Anthropology into: a) Social Policy, b) Social Anthropology. During the same period the campus expanded and improved.
