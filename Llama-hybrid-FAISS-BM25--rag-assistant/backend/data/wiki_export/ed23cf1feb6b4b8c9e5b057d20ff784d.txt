History

It was first mentioned in 1414 as a fortress protecting Pskov from the south, when Vytautas of Lithuania sacked it. Prince Ivan Shuysky built a wooden fortress there in 1535. In the 16th century, the fortress defended the Western approaches to the Grand Duchy of Moscow. Lithuanian and Polish troops captured it during the Livonian War and held it until the First Partition of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The fortifications of Sebezh, now dismantled, were reinforced at the behest of Peter the Great during the Great Northern War. The castle hill is still dominated by the Roman Catholic Church, built in 1625-1648 and reconsecrated as a Russian Orthodox Church in 1989.

From 1802 to 1924, Sebezh was the seat of Sebezhskly Uyezd of Vitebsk Governorate. On August 1, 1927, the uyezds and governorates were abolished and Sebezhsky District, with the administrative center in Sebezh, was established as a part of Velikiye Luki Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. It included parts of former Sebezhsky Uyezd. On June 3, 1929, Sebezhsky District was transferred to Western Oblast. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were also abolished and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. On January 29, 1935, Western Oblast was abolished and the district was transferred to Kalinin Oblast, and on February 5 of the same year, Sebezhsky District became a part of Velikiye Luki Okrug of Kalinin Oblast, one of the okrugs abutting the state boundaries of the Soviet Union. On May 4, 1938, the district was transferred to Opochka Okrug. On February 5, 1941, the okrug was abolished. Between July 9, 1941 and July 17, 1944, Sebezh was occupied by German troops. On August 22, 1944, the district was transferred to newly established Velikiye Luki Oblast. On October 2, 1957, Velikiye Luki Oblast was abolished and Sebezhsky District was transferred to Pskov Oblast.

According to the 1939 population census, there were 845 Jews living in Sebezh.
The SS Division “Totenkopf” arrived in the town on July 7, 1941. Many Jews managed to escape during this period, . During the entire occupation, which lasted from July 1941 to July 1944, there was an Ortskommandantur in the town. There was an Ordnungsdienst, too. A ghetto was created in September 1941 and existed until March 1942. After that, it was liquidated. During the liquidation, more than 100 Jews were shot in pits. The perpetrators of the shooting were local Russian policemen.
