The judiciary of Pakistan () is a hierarchical system with two classes of courts: the superior (or higher) judiciary and the subordinate (or lower) judiciary.  The superior judiciary is composed of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, the Federal Shariat Court and five High Courts, with the Supreme Court at the apex. There is a High Court for each of the four provinces as well as a High Court for the Islamabad Capital Territory. The Constitution of Pakistan entrusts the superior judiciary with the obligation to preserve, protect and defend the constitution.  Neither the Supreme Court nor a High Court may exercise jurisdiction in relation to Tribal Areas, except otherwise  provided for. The disputed regions of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit–Baltistan have separate court systems.

The independence of the Pakistani judiciary has changed over time. Whereas the judiciary used to defer to the Pakistani military, which is a dominant actor in Pakistan's politics, the judiciary has increasingly competed with and confronted the military.

Besides Supreme Court of Pakistan, there are areas that are not constitutional parts of Pakistan till now.  They are Gilgit  Baltistan and AJK.  As per the constitution of Pakistan, they are being governed by Government of Pakistan on interim basis.  Though Gilgit Baltistan declared its independence from Dogra/Maharaja Kashmir on 1 November 1948, that is said to be the independence day of Gilgit Baltistan.  Likewise, the authority of Constitution of Pakistan is not held there, though through Presidential ordinances, and PM packages, they are governed and given an interim authority delegated by Federal Government of Pakistan.

As the Supreme Court of Pakistan doesn't have jurisdiction over Gilgit Baltistan, thus another form of APEX Court named Supreme Appellate Court for Gilgit Baltistan has been introduced, with designated powers as that of Supreme Court of Pakistan.

The subordinate judiciary consists of civil and criminal district courts, and numerous specialized courts covering banking, insurance, customs and excise, smuggling, drugs, terrorism, taxation, the environment, consumer protection, and corruption.  The criminal courts were created under the Criminal Procedure Code 1898 and the civil courts were established by the West Pakistan Civil Court Ordinance 1962.  There are also revenue courts that operate under the West Pakistan Land Revenue Act 1967.  The government may also set up administrative courts and tribunals for exercising exclusive jurisdiction in specific matters.

As of 2017, Pakistan's judiciary is suffering from a backlog of two million cases, with lawsuits taking an average of nearly ten years to resolve. According to some estimates, 90% of civil cases involve land disputes, owing to Pakistan's lack of a proper land register.

Superior judiciary

Supreme Court of Pakistan

The Supreme Court (KAS), established in 1956, is the apex court in Pakistan's judicial hierarchy, the final arbiter of legal and constitutional disputes.  The court consists of a Chief Justice and sixteen other judges.  There is also provision for appointment of acting judges as well as ad hoc judges in the court.  It has a permanent seat in Islamabad as well as branch registries in Lahore, Peshawar, Quetta and Karachi.

It has a number of de jure powers which are outlined in the constitution, including appellate and constitutional jurisdiction, and suo moto power to try human rights matters.  Through several periods of military rule and constitutional suspensions, the court has also established itself as a de facto check on military power.
The Supreme Court Judges are supervised by the Supreme Judicial Council.

Federal Shariat Court of Pakistan

The Federal Shariat Court of Pakistan was established in 1980 to scrutinize all Pakistani laws and determine if they conform to Islamic values "as laid down in the Quran and the Sunnah".  If a law is found to be 'repugnant', the Court notifies the relevant government, specifying the reasons for its decision.  The court also has appellate jurisdiction over penalties (hudud) arising under Islamic law, although these decisions can be reviewed by the Shariat Appellate Bench of the Supreme Court.  The decisions of the court are binding on the high courts as well as the subordinate judiciary.  The court appoints its own staff and frames its own rules of procedure.

The court consists of eight Muslim judges, appointed by the President of Pakistan, on the advice of a judicial committee of the chief justices of the Supreme Court and the Federal Shariat Court.  The committee chooses from amongst serving or retired judges of the Supreme Court or the high courts or from amongst persons possessing the qualifications of judges of a high court.  Of the eight judges, three are required to be Islamic Scholars/Ulema well versed in Islamic law.  The judges serve terms of three years, subject to extension by the President.  The current Chief Justice of the Federal Shariat Court is Justice Sheikh Najam ul Hasan.

Appointments of Judges

Supreme Court of Pakistan
Prior to 18th Constitutional Amendments, appointments to the Supreme Court of Pakistan were made by the President of Pakistan, on the recommendation of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. This system bred many allegations of favoritism.  Many judges who were appointed were relatives of other Judges or Government officials.  However, following the Supreme Court's judgement in the Al-Jehad Trust case, the government's role in judicial appointments was curtailed.  Under the terms of this judgement, the Government and the President's office were bound to act on the recommendations of the Chief Justice of Pakistan.

After passage of the 18th and 19th Constitutional Amendments, a new Judicial Commission (named Judicial Commission of Pakistan) and Parliamentary Committee were established for appointments.  The Judicial Commission of Pakistan consists of a total of nine members: the Chief Justice of Pakistan, four senior judges of the Supreme Court, a former Chief Justice or judge of the Supreme Court nominated by the serving Chief Justice in consultation with the four serving judges of the Supreme Court aforementioned, the Attorney General of Pakistan, the Federal Minister for Law and Justice and, one senior advocate nominated by the Pakistan Bar Council.  The Parliamentary Committee confirms or may not confirm the nominee of the Judicial Commission. All power of executive was curtailed by the judicial commission and  president has no discretionary power but only to approve the nominees.  Prime minister has only ministerial power regarding the appointment procedure.

High Courts
In Appointments to the High Courts, the same procedure as in Supreme Courts appointments is adopted  Prior to 18th Constitutional Amendment, High Court appointments suffered much the same criticisms as those to the Supreme Court.  Future appointments will be made in the same manner as those to the Supreme Court.  But instead of 4 supreme court judges, 4 most senior high court judges, provincial law minister and a member of provincial bar councils (such as Punjab Bar Council) will sit the Judicial Commission of Pakistan considering the appointment of high court judges. The age limit for the high court judge is minimum 45 years. 
There is no merit system for selection of Judges to higher Judiciary.  Judges of the Judicial Service are generally ignored during the selection while 
influential Lawyers who have political support from Political Parties and Bars make it to the higher Judiciary.

District & Sessions Judges
Additional District & Sessions Judges are appointed by the Provincial & federal High Courts, from a pool of Lawyers and subordinate judges.  To be eligible for appointment, Lawyers must have ten years' experience as an advocate with good standing in the respective jurisdiction.  They must also pass an examination conducted by the High Courts.  Subordinate judges are also promoted from senior civil judges on a seniority basis.

Civil Judge Cum Judicial Magistrate
Civil Judge Cum Judicial Magistrates are also appointed by the Provincial High Courts, on the recommendation of provincial Public Service Commissions.  These Commissions hold open competitive exams annually, which are advertised in national newspapers.  The basic qualifications required are an LL.B from any recognized university, and two years' experience as an advocate in the jurisdiction in question.  The exams include various compulsory papers.  For example, the Punjab Public Service Commission sets compulsory papers on English Language & Essay, Urdu Language & Essay, Islamic Studies, Pakistan Studies, General Knowledge (objective test), Criminal Law, Civil Law 1 & 2, and General Law.  All candidates who pass the examinations are given a psychological test.  Those who pass both these stages are interviewed by members of Service Commissions, and recommendations are made to the respective High Courts for appointments.  In Sindh province, the appointments are made on the backdrop of a test conducted by National testing service (NTS) which is primarily based on English language and General knowledge.  The candidates who manage to pass the first test then undertake another test by NTS after which the successful candidates are chosen for the interview which is conducted by the five most senior judges of high court including chief justice of Sindh and candidate who manage to pass the interview are recommended for the post of civil judge and judicial magistrate who thereafter are appointed by the government of Sindh.

Controversies

Harassment of female law officers 

In May 2018 some Pakistani Judges  complained of harassment and threats to Judges by  Pakistani 'male' lawyer fraternity and bar associations. Similar complained of more serious nature was made in November 2020 by Dr Sajida Ahmed Chaudhry, Additional District and Sessions Judge Fathejang complained to Chief Justice of Pakistan through open letter against  culture of continued intimidating disrespect, harassment and threats of judges and women judges  by Pakistani 'male' lawyer fraternity and bar associations.  Dr Sajida Ahmed Chaudhry has been quoted saying

"....if the district judges were supposed to be snubbed, abused, mentally and physically tortured by the lawyers during court hours but their honour and dignity could not be protected by the top judiciary, the district judges are ready to surrender their extra perks like cars, laptops, etc...."“When the male as well as the female judges are harassed at our courts, I feel compelled and frustrated either to burn all my educational degrees one by one in front of the LHC or in front of the Supreme Court so that none of the girls among the 230 million population should dare to come and join judiciary,”According to Rubya Mehdi Pakistan Judiciary is quite corrupt to the extent that it is said in Pakistan that even walls of judicial offices seek bribes; in this scenario in spite of Islamic traditions did not favor female judicial officers still popular public opinion was in very much welcoming appointments of female judges since they were less approachable for corruption; and for the same reason Pakistani male advocates behave adversely to Pakistan's women judges since they find them difficult to be approached and bribed.
