Greenfaulds railway station serves the Greenfaulds area of Cumbernauld, North Lanarkshire, Scotland. It is also within walking distance of the Lenziemill industrial estate, the Luggie Water and the Blairlinn industrial estate. The station is managed by ScotRail and is located  north east of Glasgow Queen Street (High Level) on the Cumbernauld Line and is  north of Motherwell railway station on the Motherwell to Cumbernauld Line.

History

The station was opened on 15 May 1989 by British Rail with financial backing from what was then the Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive.  It was on a new site (though the line that serves it is considerably older) and was built as part of the plan to upgrade the Queen Street to Cumbernauld line. The Motherwell service began calling here when it was inaugurated in May 1996.

Open access operator Grand Union Trains plans to use the station on a Stirling to London Euston service to begin in 2025.
