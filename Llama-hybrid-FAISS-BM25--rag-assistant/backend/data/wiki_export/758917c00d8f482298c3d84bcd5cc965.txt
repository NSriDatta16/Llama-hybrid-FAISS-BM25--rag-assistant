The 15th congressional district of Ohio is currently represented by Republican Mike Carey. It was represented by Republican Steve Stivers from 2011 until May 16, 2021, when he resigned to become president and CEO of the Ohio Chamber of Commerce. The district includes all of Franklin County that is not in the 3rd district, including Grove City, Hilliard, and Dublin. It then fans out to grab suburban and exurban territory between the state capital Columbus and Dayton, along with more rural territory south of Columbus.
