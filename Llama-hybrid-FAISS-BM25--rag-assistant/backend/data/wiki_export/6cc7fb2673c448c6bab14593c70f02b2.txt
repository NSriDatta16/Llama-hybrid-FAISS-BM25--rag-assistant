History
Settlement began in 1956 on the Fazenda Salobinha owned by Enemias Lino de Oliveira.  The owner donated the land, which was divided into lots and sold at low prices to new settlers.  The first name was "Salobinha".  In 1958, it became a district of the municipality of  Goiás, passing to the new municipality of  Diorama in the same year.  In 1963, it became an independent municipality with the new name of Montes Claros de Goiás, taken from the existence of small hills nearby and the Rio Claro, which lies 15 kilometers from the municipal seat.
