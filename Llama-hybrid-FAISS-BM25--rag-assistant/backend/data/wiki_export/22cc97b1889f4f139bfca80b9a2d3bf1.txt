Bharatendu Harishchandra (9 September 18506 January 1885) was an Indian poet, writer and playwright. He authored several dramas, life sketches and travel accounts, using new media such as reports, publications, letters to editors of publications, translations, and literary works to shape public opinion. 'Bharatendu Harishchandra' is often considered the father of Hindi literature and Hindi theatre. He has been hailed as a Yug Charan for his writings depicting the exploitative nature of the British Raj.

Writing under the pen name "Rasa", Harishchandra picked themes that demonstrated the agonies of the people. For instance, the country's poverty, dependency, inhuman exploitation, the unrest of the middle class and the urgent need for progression of the country. Referred as a fearless journalist, Harishchandra refuted the prevailing orthodoxy of the time and revealed the machination of the mahants, pandas and priests. He was an influential Hindu "traditionalist", using Vaishnava devotionalism to define a coherent Hindu religion.

Biography 
Born into the Agrawal caste in Benaras, Harishchandra's father Gopal Chandra was a poet. His ancestors were landlords in Bengal. Even though his parents died when he was young, they seemed to have left an influence on him. Acharya Ramchandra Shukla has described Bharatendu's journey to the Jagannath temple in Puri, Orissa with his family in 1865, at the young age of 15. During this trip he was deeply moved by the Bengal Renaissance and decided to translate the genres of social, historical, and Puranic plays and novels into Hindi. This influence reflected in his Hindi translation of the Bengali drama Vidyasundar, three years later, in 1868.

Harishchandra edited the magazines Kavi Vachan Sudha, Harishchandra Magazine, Harishchandra Patrika and Bal Vodhini.

He wrote under the pseudonym Girdhar Das. He was titled "Bharatendu" ("The moon of India") at a public meeting by scholars of Kashi in 1880 in recognition of his services as a writer, patron, and moderniser. Ram Vilas Sharma refers to the "great literary awakening ushered in under Bharatendu's leadership" as the "second storey of the edifice of renascent Hindi", the first being the Indian Rebellion of 1857.

He was married and had one daughter.

Hindu traditionalism 
According to Barbara and Thomas R. Metcalf, Bharatendu Harishchandra was a powerful Hindu "traditionalist" in North India, promoting the continuity of received tradition and self-conscious participation with the modern world. He rejected the authority of those engaged with Western learning and institutions over Hindu religious matters and recommended they be left to traditionally educated Hindu scholars. He used new media, especially publications to shape public opinion. In doing so, he contributed to the development of modern forms of the Hindi language. 

He used Vaishnava devotionalism to define a coherent Hindu religion, using the Kashi Dharma Sabha as his institutional base, started in the 1860s by the Maharaja of Benares as a response to more radical Hindu reformist movements. Harishchandra insisted on the value of image worship and interpreted Bhakti as devotion to a single god; this was in response to Orientalist and Christian critiques of Hinduism.

Although Urdu was used as the lingua franca across North India since the 18th Century, Harishchandra espoused the cause of reviving Hindi as part of his cultural and nationalist activities. He "combined pleas for [the] use of Swadeshi articles with demands for replacement of Urdu by Hindi in courts and a ban on cow slaughter". He continued his campaign for a legal ban on cow slaughter on behalf of Maharaja of Benares, taking it to the Delhi Durbar. His petition on the same, according to Sahay ([1905] 1975: 84), had 60,000 signatories and was submitted to Lord Lytton. Even though no action was taken on the ban, he was given the title "Vir Vaishnava".
