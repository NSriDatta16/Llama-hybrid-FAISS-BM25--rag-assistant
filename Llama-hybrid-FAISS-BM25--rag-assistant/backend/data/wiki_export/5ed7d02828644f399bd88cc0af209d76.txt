Naked Elvis is a late-night British television quiz show on Channel 4 from 10 August to 3 December 1999 hosted by Tania Strecker. Two teams of students would answer general knowledge questions. There was a scoremaster dressed as Elvis Presley played by Marc Fossey, Sam Cullingworth and two others who would remove one item of clothing between each round until he was naked.
