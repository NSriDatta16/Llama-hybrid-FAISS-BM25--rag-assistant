Topsy Turvy was the second album by rock band Young Fresh Fellows.  It was released in 1985 on PopLlama. It was the band's first album to feature longtime member Jim Sangster on bass. 

The album was given a positive review by Rolling Stone Magazine, in their July 17, 1986 issue.  Reviewer David Fricke wrote that the album was “the perfect refresher, a bracing bop cocktail of daffy comic relief, canny pop songwriting, and punk-rock drive.” Band leader Scott McCaughney noted in 2020 that many of the album's songs remain in the band's setlists to the day.    

The album was later re-released as a two-for-one double CD with their first album, The Fabulous Sounds of the Pacific Northwest.
