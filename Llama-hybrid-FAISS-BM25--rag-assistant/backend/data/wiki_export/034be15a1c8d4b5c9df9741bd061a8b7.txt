Stephen T. Badin High School, (commonly known as Badin High School) is a Catholic high school of the Archdiocese of Cincinnati school system, serving grades nine through twelve in Hamilton, Ohio, United States. It is a comprehensive high school which admits students of all levels of ability.

History
Badin High School is named after Father Stephen T. Badin, the first Catholic priest ordained in the United States. Badin High School first opened its doors the fall of 1966. Previously, two high schools served the area from the early 1900s until their closings in 1966: Hamilton Catholic High School for young men and Notre Dame High School for young women. The Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur, the Brothers of St. Mary, archdiocesan priests, other religious orders and committed lay persons laid the foundation of Badin High school at its current location near Potter's golf course on New London Road. Father Frank Miller (Purcell '42) organized the merger and became the first principal of the combined school.
