Laurie Brown (born 7 October 1957 in Toronto, Ontario) is a Canadian television journalist. She grew up in Scarborough, Ontario and graduated from David and Mary Thomson Collegiate Institute. Her parents were originally from Nova Scotia, and when Brown was in her late teens, they and her sister Susan moved back to that province. Brown remained in Toronto, and eventually embarked on a career in television and radio broadcasting.

Brown currently lives in Nova Scotia.
