Reception

The game received above-average reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. IGN gave it favorable reviews, while GameSpot gave it mixed reviews, months before the game was released Stateside. Eric Bratcher of NextGen, however, said of the game, "The engine is fast (though graphically bland), but a trip to a real amusement park would cost about the same and last longer than four hours. Plus, you could buy corn dogs and funnel cake." In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of 28 out of 40 for the first Jet Coaster Dream, 25 out of 40 for the sequel, and 27 out of 40 for the PlayStation 2 version.
