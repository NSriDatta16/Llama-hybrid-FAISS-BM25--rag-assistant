Puchong is a major town and a parliamentary constituency in Petaling District, Selangor, Malaysia.

It is bordered by Subang Jaya in the north, Sepang and Putrajaya in the south, Seri Kembangan in the east and Putra Heights in the west.

History
The first settlers of the area were the Orang Asli community in a village known as Kampung Pulas. In 1900, heron (Malay: burung puchong) were aplenty in the area and were a staple for the Orang Asli.

However, it is believed that the area was explored by immigrants from Sumatra and Java. At first, the people worked as fish mongers, rubber tappers and miners. Due to the booming tin mining industry, immigrants from China and India were also brought in.

During the communist insurgency in 1948, all residents were resettled to an area which is known as Kampung Baru Batu 14.

During the 1980s, Puchong consisted of a single two-lane road running through estates and villages. Puchong development began circa 1985, when the mining licenses expired and infrastructure began to be built.

Since then, urbanization has occurred rapidly with many industrial parks, commercial centres and residential areas mushrooming along Jalan Puchong. Residential areas include Taman Kinrara, Bandar Bukit Puchong 2 and Bandar Kinrara.
