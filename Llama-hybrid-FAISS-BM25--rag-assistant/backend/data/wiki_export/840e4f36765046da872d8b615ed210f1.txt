The East Regional League (currently named the BT East League for sponsorship reasons) is one of three Scottish Regional Leagues operated by the Scottish Rugby Union, which play at a level below that of the Scottish National Leagues structure.  Originally, these divisions were district leagues under the jurisdiction of the Edinburgh & District Union and the Scottish Borders Union.

Winners of the top division progress to Scottish National League Division Three.
