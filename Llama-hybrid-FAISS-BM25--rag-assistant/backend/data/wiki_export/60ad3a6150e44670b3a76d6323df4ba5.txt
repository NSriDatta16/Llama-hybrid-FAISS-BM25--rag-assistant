History 

During the Ramayana period a sage called Pandi Muni was residing here and he was suffering from serious disease. He made penance to be relieved of his suffering. After ten long years of continuous penance, some of which he stood on one leg, Lord Rama appeared before him. Lord Rama guided Pandi Muni to marry and find solace in married life. Following Lord Rama's advice, Pandi Muni married a Brahmin girl called Brinda Muthaayi. They lived together atop a hill. The hill was called Brinda Maala because she made garlands from the flowers in the hill. The name later corrupted to become Parangi Malai which is presently called as St. Thomas Mount.

Knowing that Sri Rama is passing through his place here, Bringi Rishi went and invited Sri Rama to stay with him for few days before proceeding. Sri Rama agreed to be the guest of Bringi Rishi and stayed here. Bringi Rishi created a small Nandavanam (means garden) for the comfort of Sri Rama and the place came to be known as Nandavanam itself, which later changed as Nandambakkam. The neighboring place to Nandambakkam is called Ramapuram, which is said to be named after Sri Rama's stay here. 

Textiles and Garments business clan namely "Nandam" have developed this region and thus name "Nandambakkam" has been established. More than 10,000 people were working for Nandam Handlooms during Vijayanagara dynasty (13th - 16th Century) and they were exporting textiles in South East Asian Region.

The shrine of St Thomas Mount, established in 1523, is located nearby in the locality of Parangimalai.
