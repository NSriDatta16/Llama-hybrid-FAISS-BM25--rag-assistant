ACLU case 2007–09
In October 2007, the ACLU criticized the school's administration for actions in May 2007 when, allegedly, students' cell phones were seized and their messages read and transcribed. ACLU pointed to constitutional rights and to Colorado privacy laws that would make some of the alleged actions a felony. In April 2008, new guidelines to protect students' privacy were put in place, which were commended by the ACLU.
