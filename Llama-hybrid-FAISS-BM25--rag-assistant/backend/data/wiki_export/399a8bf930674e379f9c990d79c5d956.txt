Ordo Sancti Constantini Magni (post-nominals: OCM) () is a  international, ecumenical, and religious Christian Order and knighthood under the auspices of the Patriarch and Pope Theodoros II of Alexandria and all Africa.

The Order was established in 1953 to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the Fall of Constantinople with most original knights hailing from Finland and Greece.  Later, due to growth, the Order began establishing smaller 'exarchates' in various countries.  The first two were established in Finland and Greece in 1978 and held their 40th anniversary conclaves in 2018.

At the beginning of 2018, the Order had 491 full members in many European countries and the United States:
Finland (248 knights)
United States (79 knights)
Sweden (63 knights)
Greece (34 knights)
Austria (29 knights)
Norway (19 knights)
Germany (10 knights)

Additionally, there are 38 honorary members.
