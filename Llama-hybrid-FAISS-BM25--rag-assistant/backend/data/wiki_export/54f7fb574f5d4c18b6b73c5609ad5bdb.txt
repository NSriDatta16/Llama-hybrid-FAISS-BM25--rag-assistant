History
Cochise College was one of the first community colleges in Arizona when it was founded on September 21, 1964. The college was voted on by the citizens of Cochise County in 1961 and a 1962 bond election resulted in the construction of the Douglas Campus. With the increased growth and interest in secondary education, a second campus was opened in Sierra Vista. The new campus was originally housed in a few temporary buildings on the grounds of Buena High School in the early 1970s but opened a full scale college campus in 1978.

Campus
Cochise College is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association. The college holds memberships in the Arizona Community College Association, the Council of North Central Two-Year Colleges, the American Association of Community Colleges, the Council for Higher Education Accreditation, the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities and the Association of Community College Trustees.

The college also holds Federal Aviation Administration certification for its professional pilot and aviation maintenance programs and Arizona Department of Health Services/Emergency Medical Services certification for its paramedicine and emergency medical technology programs. The nursing program is accredited by the Arizona State Board of Nursing and the Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing.

The Cochise College Library system consists of two branches, the Charles Di Peso Library on the Douglas campus and the Andrea Cracchiolo Library on the Sierra Vista campus. The libraries maintain a collection of over 60,000 books and media items, including DVDs and audiobooks, to support Cochise College curriculum and lifelong learning.
