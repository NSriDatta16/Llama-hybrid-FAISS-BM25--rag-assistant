The European Heavyweight Championship is a name used for various top titles competed for throughout the European professional wrestling circuit.

The title was recognised as official by UK national TV network ITV for the purposes of their coverage of the UK wrestling scene and by its listings magazine TVTimes in accompanying magazine feature coverage.

The title was defended in many promotions in Europe, and other versions of this one title also appeared in certain promotions. On August 25, 2001 the European Wrestling Union produced a European Heavyweight Championship tournament in Bochum, Germany, bringing in wrestlers some of whom claimed to already be the champion. This tournament saw these titles merge into one with Britain's Robbie Brookside confirming his claim as champion by defeating American "Five Star" Cory K in a championship decider.

The title history below shows all the holders of the traditional/"old school" title in chronological order plus some major "new school" versions. However, there are instances where another wrestler has taken the role of champion, or claimed the title but no official title change was recorded (these are noted with "unknown title history", or other details.)
