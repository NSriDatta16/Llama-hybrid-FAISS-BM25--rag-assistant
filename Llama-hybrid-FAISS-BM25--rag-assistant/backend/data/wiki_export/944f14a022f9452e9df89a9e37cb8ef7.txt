St. Johns River State College is a public college in Northeast Florida with campuses in Palatka, St. Augustine, and Orange Park. Founded in 1958 (for organizational purposes) as St. Johns River Junior College, it is part of the Florida College System and one of several colleges in the system designated a "state college", meaning they can offer more bachelor degrees than traditional community colleges. It is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Florida School of the Arts, Florida's first state-sponsored arts school, is housed within the Palatka Campus.

History
The first president of the college, Dr. B. R. Tilley, was appointed in 1958 and the college opened its doors that year; however Walter Smith states that Tilley was appointed in 1959 "to plan for the opening". Initial classes were held in a Baptist church, until it could build its Palatka facility; the school later expanded with campuses in Orange Park and St. Augustine in order to serve Putnam, St. Johns, and Clay Counties. It was founded simultaneously with Collier-Blocker Junior College, for negro students, and nominally absorbed the institution in 1964, although none of the faculty and few of the students moved  to St. Johns.

Between 1966 and 2011, when it adopted its current name, it changed its name to St. Johns River Community College. The adoption of its current name coincided with its designation as a state college that can offer a greater number of bachelor's degrees to its academic programs. The current president of the college is Joe Pickens. He took over from Dr Robert L. McLendon Jr., who had served as president of the college from 1972 to 2008. The Thrasher-Horne Center for Performing Arts opened on the Orange Park campus in 2004.

In 2012, a wall was created with portraits and other mementos of Collier-Blocker.
