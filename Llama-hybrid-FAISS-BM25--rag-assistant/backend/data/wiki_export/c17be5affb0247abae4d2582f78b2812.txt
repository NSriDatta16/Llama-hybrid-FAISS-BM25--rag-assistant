Young Communist League of Estonia () was the youth wing of the Communist Party of Estonia during the interbellum period.

Activities and organization 
EKNÜ was working in a clandestine manner. It published Noor Proletaarlane (1921) and Noor Tööline (1922–1923). There are other publications from the EKNÜ that were written by Kalju Tiro. EKNÜ was a section of the Communist Youth International. After the incorporation of Estonia into the Soviet Union on 6 August 1940, EKNÜ merged into the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League (VLKSM). The Estonian branch of VLKSM had the name 'Leninist Young Communist League of Estonia' (Eestimaa Leninlik Kommunistlik Noorsooühing, ELKNÜ).
