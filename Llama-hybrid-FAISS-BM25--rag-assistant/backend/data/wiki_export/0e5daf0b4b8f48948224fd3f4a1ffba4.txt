Her latest recording for Meridian Records, of piano music by Gabriel Faure, was released in 2016 to critical acclaim:

'Her phrases are beautifully shaped without excessive lingering, her voicing is clear, but not exaggerated, and her naturally flowing tempos are perfectly gauged. These readings are comparable in quality to Angela Hewitt's, Jean-Phillipe Collard's.' (Fanfare magazine, USA, June 2016)

In recent years, she has devised and performed in 'Words and Music' concerts featuring some of the UK's most distinguished actors including Edward Fox, Sir Derek Jacobi, Charles Dance, Robert Powell, Prunella Scales and author and raconteur Sir John Mortimer.
