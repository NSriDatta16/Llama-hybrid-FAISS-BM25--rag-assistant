History

Early years
Lisnagarvey Hockey Club was founded in September 1901, following a meeting held at the Temperance Institute on Railway Street, Lisburn. An earlier Lisburn Hockey Club was founded in 1897 so the new club was named after Lisnagarvey, the townland that eventually expanded into Lisburn. In 1903–04 the club joined a league for the first time and in 1904–05 the club won its first trophy, the Mulholland Shield. In 1905–06 Lisnagarvey reached the final of the Irish Junior Cup. After the first game against Monkstown finished 2–2 after extra time, they lost the replay 5–0. In 1922–23 Lisnagarvey won their first senior trophy when they won the Anderson Cup, defeating Antrim in the final. In 1924–25 Lisnagarvey won a quartet of trophies. In addition to winning the Anderson Cup for a second time, they also won the Irish Senior Cup, the Kirk Cup and the Ulster Senior League, all for the first time.

Men's Irish Senior Cup
Lisnagarvey are the Irish Senior Cup's most successful team. They won the cup for the first time in 1924–25, defeating Limerick PMYA over three games. Between 1987–88 and 1993–94 with a team that included Jimmy Kirkwood, Lisnagarvey won the cup for seven successive seasons.

Lisnagarvey in Europe
Lisnagarvey has also represented Ireland in European competitions. After winning both the 1969–70 Irish Senior Cup and the 1969–70 British Club Championship, Lisnagarvey were invited to play in the 1971 EuroHockey Club Champions Cup. After retaining both the Irish Senior Cup and the British Club Championship in 1970–71, Lisnagarvey were invited to play in the 1972 EuroHockey Club Champions Cup.

Women's section
Lisnagarvey first formed a women's section in 1903–04. The original women's section was suspended during the First World War but was reformed in 1920. During the 1920s at least two Lisnagarvey women's players – Sylvia Kirkwood and K. Kirkwood – represented Ireland.

Grounds

Lisnagarvey originally played their home games at two separate pitches in Lisburn – one at Magheralave Road and the other at Antrim Road. Lisnagarvey took over the Magheralave Road pitch from the original Lisburn Hockey Club after it disbanded around 1907–08. They continued to use this pitch until 1933–34. In the early 1950s Lisnagarvey purchased ground in Blaris, near the Lisnagarvey transmitting station. The club members subsequently built their own pitch and pavilion. In the 1980s the club established an artificial pitch complex at a completely new venue nearby. The new home was named New Blaris. 
In 2002 New Blaris was sold and the club temporarily played its home games at Queen's University. Work on a new home at Comber Road, Hillsborough, County Down was started in 2004. This facility featuring a new clubhouse and two water-based artificial turf pitches was completed in time for the start of the 2005–06 season.
