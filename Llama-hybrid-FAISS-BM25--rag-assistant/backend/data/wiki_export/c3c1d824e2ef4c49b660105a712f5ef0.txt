Assumption College (often known as ACK, where the K stands for Kilmore) is an Australian Catholic co-educational secondary day and boarding school. The school is located in the town of Kilmore, Victoria. The College was founded in 1893 by the Marist Brothers and is part of a network of Marist schools in Australia and throughout the world.

Assumption College first took in boarders 1901 to meet the educational needs of Catholic families throughout regional Victoria and southern New South Wales. Established initially as a boys' school primarily accepting boarders, the proportion of day students has progressively grown since the 1970s and boarding numbers have diminished. The school became co-educational in 1971 and girls began boarding in 1995.

Assumption College is governed by Marist Schools Australia and is supported by the Catholic Education Commission of Victoria. Assumption became a member of the Associated Grammar Schools of Victoria (AGSV) in 1958 which provides a broad sporting competition for students. Since 2000, girls sport has been supplemented through membership of the Associated Public Schools of Victoria (APS) competition
 
The current principal is Ms Kate Fogarty, the college's first female principal.

History: The Marist Brothers
The Marist Brothers order was established as a teaching order in France in 1817 by a priest, Father Marcellin Champagnat (1789–1840), with a particular goal of providing elementary education to underprivileged rural children. The Marist Brothers were invited to Australia by the Archbishop of Sydney, arriving in 1872. From the original plan to provide primary education for the underprivileged, both in Sydney and later in other cities, they changed their ideas and also opened elite secondary schools for which significant fees were charged. From this income, monies could be diverted to subsidise the education of the less privileged. 
From humble origins in rural France, the order established by Marcellin Champagnat grew to spread across the globe and there are now Marist schools in 79 countries on five continents (Europe, Africa, the Americas, Asia, and Oceania). This includes 52 Marist schools in Australia. Marcellin Champagnat was declared Venerable in 1920 by Pope Benedict XV, declared Blessed (beatified) by Pope Pius XII in 1955 and canonised by Pope John Paul II in 1999. Thus he is now recognised as Saint Marcellin Champagnat.

History: Assumption College
The Marist Brothers were invited to Kilmore to start a primary school for local boys in 1893.  This they did, but as the new century approached the Catholic educational needs of rural families from northern Victoria and southern New South Wales had to be considered. In 1901 the first boarder was enrolled at the College, as a response to the needs of those families. In 1907 the school was registered and officially known as Assumption College, Kilmore. The College continued to grow as a boys’ boarding school with a smaller day boys component until 1971, when the first two girls were enrolled. These young women paved the way for the introduction of full co-education in the day school in 1985–86 and full co-education in the boarding house in 1995-96.

Curriculum
Year 7 students are exposed to a wide range of subjects including design technologies (wood, food, metal and textiles), digital technologies, English, humanities, the sciences, health and physical education, languages (both French and Italian) and religious education. 
From Years 8-10 students participate in the MyMAP Program. MyMAP is a vertical curriculum seeking to build mastery, autonomy and purpose in student learning. Students and their parents can select subjects from a substantive list of vertical classes, catering to individual choice and learner development.
In Years 11 and 12, students can study for one of two senior certificates: the Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE) or the Victorian Certificate of Applied Learning (VCAL). Within these, students can also complete units in Vocational Educational and Training (VET) or be part of a school-based apprenticeship (SBAT). 
Assumption College is the home of the Marlhes Restaurant, which is a vocational training centre and functioning restaurant. The restaurant caters for special functions and an a la carte seated dining room.

Sport
As the College is built on over 100 acres (40 hectares) there are extensive facilities for outdoor sports. In addition to the Carroll (main) Oval, the College has tennis and netball courts, hockey pitches, soccer fields, softball diamonds, a large indoor stadium, dance studios and a gymnasium.  The following sports are played and teams and representatives participate in the AGS competitions in these sports: AFL & AFLW, basketball, soccer, cricket, tennis, swimming, netball, volleyball, athletics, touch rugby, softball and cross country. Most sports are open to girls and boys. Boys teams at all ages compete in the AGS sports calendar while girls teams now compete in a calendar of events with teams drawn from both the AGS and the Associated Public Schools.  Since joining the AGS in 1959, ACK has won the AGS football premiership on 36 occasions, including every year of its first ten years of entering the competition. The College also maintains an active equestrian program, golfing, lawn bowls and clay-target teams. The College was a founding member of the Associated Catholic Colleges in 1911 until 1975.

Each year a junior or senior drama production is staged.  Students in sessional dance classes and those in dance classes from Years 9 to 12 showcase at an annual dance concert.

Debaters also take part in that exchange, and Assumption is a member of the Debating Association of Victoria’s school competition.

Old Collegians Association (and football team)
The College has an active Old Collegians Association. Its functions include support for the College, arranging social functions and regional reunions, facilitating class reunions and contributing to the College magazine Shandon Calls. 
In 1964, the Old Collegians Association entered a team in the Victorian Amateur Football League (VAFL) with some early success. However, because many old collegians return to live in rural Victoria and NSW, maintaining a stand-alone team has proven difficult. Since 2011 the Old Collegians team has participated in the VAFL as Prahran Football Club. The team has been successful as it won Division 2 in 2018 and is currently playing in Division 1.

The College Song
When Shandon Calls

(The lyrics to the school song were composed by C J Dennis (1876-1938) and relate to the original school bell which had come from a ship, the Shandon, which first sailed from Glasgow in 1883.)

Awake, awake, when Shandon rings into the crisp Australian air.
Be glad or grave the tale it brings, we shall be there, we must be there.
When duty calls, when pleasure waits, the tongue of Shandon, day by day,
Peals out the message of the fates that guide our dear old A.C.K.

Refrain

A.C.K, strive for its high renown, boys,
A.C.K , never let it down, boys,
A.C.K , honour to it come what may,
It shall ever be our aim to battle for the fame,
And the glory of the A.C.K

For friends, for friends, Old Shandon's peal cements a friendship well begun;
And thro' the years, for woe or weal, its note shall guide us everyone.
When wide afar our footsteps roam, mid strangers on a distant day,
Dear mem'ries of our home from home shall bind us still to A.C.K

Refrain

Notable alumni 
Until the 1970s, the total enrolments for nearly half a century averaged only 300 boys so the original ACK was not a large school. In addition, many students left school before Year 12 to return to assist their families on rural properties. 
Religious life. Over 130 Old Collegians have been ordained as priests and bishops. These include Bishops Hugh Ryan, Peter Connors, Noel Daly and Peter De Campo. Many of the priests have become well-known to Australians because of their community service including Mons Jim Hannan, Fr Paul Keenan SJ, Fr John Brosnan and Fr Michael Elligate AM.
Arts, philosophy, politics, law. Prominent Old Collegians in these fields include Professor Bill Aughterson (education), Professor Max Charlesworth (philosophy), Mr Jack Keenan QC (law) and Mr Damian Drum MP and Mr Sam Birrell MP(politics).
