The Otago cricket team, nicknamed the Volts since the 1997–98 season, are a New Zealand first-class cricket team which first played representative cricket in 1864. The team represents the Otago, Southland and North Otago regions of New Zealand's South Island. Their main governing board is the Otago Cricket Association which is one of six major associations that make up New Zealand Cricket.

The team plays most of its home games at the University Oval in Dunedin, but occasionally plays games at the Events Centre in Queenstown, Queen's Park Ground in Invercargill and Molyneux Park in Alexandra. The team plays first-class, List A and Twenty20 matches against other New Zealand provincial sides, although in the past has also played against touring sides.

The team's current coach is Dion Ebrahim.

Contracted players
Ahead of the 2023–24 season, 16 players were awarded contracts with Otago. In addition, Glenn Phillips holds a New Zealand Cricket central contract for the season. Other, non-contracted players may play for the side.

Grounds
University Oval is used in Dunedin, with occasional matches in Invercargill (Queen's Park) and at the Queenstown Events Centre. Many matches have been played at Molyneux Park in Alexandra in recent decades, particularly during the Christmas-New Year holiday season. The warm, dry summer climate of Central Otago can make for better cricketing conditions than the wetter coastal areas. Oamaru (Whitestone Centennial Park) has been used in the past but not recently.

Twenty20 Champions League
A rapid expansion of Twenty20 cricket led to the creation of the Twenty20 Champions League. It was a competition between various teams from the domestic Twenty20 competitions of Australia, South Africa, Pakistan, India, England, Sri Lanka, West Indies and New Zealand.

In the 2008/09 domestic season of the State Twenty20, Otago came out as the champions, and so were eligible to compete in the inaugural Twenty20 Champions League. However, they lost both their opening games in the competition and so weren't able to progress further.

The Volts again qualified for the league in the 2013 season where they were much more successful entering the competition having won a string of Twenty20 matches which eventually ended at fifteen when they lost the Rajasthan Royals in Jaipur.
