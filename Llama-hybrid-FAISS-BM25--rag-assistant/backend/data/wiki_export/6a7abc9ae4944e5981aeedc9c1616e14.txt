Most Lithuanian immigrants arrived in Ireland in the 2000s, when the Irish economy started booming. According to Census 2016, there are 36,552 people of Lithuanian birth resident in the Republic of Ireland, a 0.4% drop from the 2011 figure of 36,683. Approximately one third of these Lithuanians live in County Dublin.

History
In the beginning of the 20th century there was some immigration of  Lithuanian Jews. Robert Briscoe, who served as lord mayor of Dublin in 1956-57 and 1961â€“62, was son of Lithuanian a Jewish immigrants to Ireland. In contrast, the current immigration is of majority Catholic Lithuanians, as Lithuania contained few Jews in 2000.

In 1935, Feliksas Vaitkus, the sixth person who had a successful flight over Atlantic Ocean with a single engine single seat fixed-wing aircraft, landed in Ireland. Vaitkus flew his transatlantic flight with Lituanica II. Vaitkus had to fight the worst possible weather conditions and was helped considerably by hourly broadcasts from an Irish radio station. He learned that Dublin was fogged in, as well as all areas heading east as far as the Baltic Sea. He knew that he could not make it to Kaunas due to his low fuel supply, and being exhausted after a 23-hour struggle fighting the elements, he felt it was best to come down somewhere in Ireland. He spotted an open field in Cloongowla at Ballinrobe, County Mayo and came down, with the aircraft suffering extensive damage. He was lucky to survive and not sustain any significant injuries. Lituanica II was crated for shipment to Lithuania, where it was restored. Vaitkus made his way to Kaunas, by ship and train, where he was given a hero's welcome.
