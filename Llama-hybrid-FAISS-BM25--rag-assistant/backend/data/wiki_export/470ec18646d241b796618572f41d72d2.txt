History
HCAW was established in 1957 as an independent baseball and softball club. Between 1949 and 1957 it operated as the baseball division of the Bussum sporting club Allen Weerbaar. The team played on a football field until 1958 when the city of Bussum agreed to build a baseball field for the club in Bussum Zuid. HCAW added a softball division in 1966.

In the same year HCAW was promoted to the Honkbal Hoofdklasse for the first time. In 1970 the club moved to its current field in the Bussumse Sportvallei. In 1988 HCAW was demoted to the Honkbal Overgangsklasse. Following the degradation financial issues forced the club to fuse with the Amstel Tijgers, a baseball club based in Amsterdam. The fusion team played in the Hoofdklasse under the name HCAW-Tijgers from 1989 to 1994. Since 1995 HCAW has played in the Hoofdklasse under its original name.
