The Minnesota Law Review is a student-run law review published by students at University of Minnesota Law School. The journal is published six times a year in November, December, February, April, May, and June. It was established by Henry J. Fletcher and William Reynolds Vance in 1917.

The journal contains articles, essays, features, and book reviews by legal scholars as well as student-written notes. The journal has an online companion called Headnotes. Additionally, the journal maintains a blog called De Novo.

In 2021, the journal selected its first Black Editor-in-Chief, Brandie Burris.
