Ulceby railway station serves the village of Ulceby in North East Lincolnshire, England. It was built by the Great Grimsby and Sheffield Junction Railway in 1848 and is located at Ulceby Skitter.

It is managed by East Midlands Railway and served by its trains on the Barton line between  and .

The station layout is somewhat unusual in that all passenger trains use a single platform, even though the station is located on a double track line. There are junctions at either end of the station, as the branch line from  to Barton-on-Humber meets and then diverges from the busy freight-only line from  to Immingham Dock.  These junctions, and the adjacent level crossing were controlled from Ulceby Junction signal box at the southern end of the station, however this was demolished in January 2016 when the crossing and signals were automated. The station originally had two platforms, but this was reduced to a single wooden platform when the line was resignalled in the 1980s.

All services at Ulceby are operated by East Midlands Railway using Class 170 DMUs.

The typical Monday-Saturday service is one train every two hours between  and .

There is a Sunday service of four trains per day in each direction during the summer months only. There are no winter Sunday services at the station.
