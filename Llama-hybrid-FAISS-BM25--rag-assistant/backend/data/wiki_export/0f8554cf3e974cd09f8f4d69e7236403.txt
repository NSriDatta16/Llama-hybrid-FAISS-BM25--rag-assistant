History
The area that is now considered to be South West Wales was established as Deheubarth by Hywel Dda in around the year 920. Although not a kingdom per se, it was ruled dynastically and fought over for centuries, until the conquest of Wales by Edward I, completed in 1283, when it was divided into the historic counties that exist today.

Governance

South West Wales is made up of the four principal areas of Carmarthenshire, Neath Port Talbot, Pembrokeshire and Swansea.

The Swansea Bay City Region is a partnership between local authorities, businesses and other organisations.

In April 2021, a South West Wales Corporate Joint Committee was formed to allow the four local councils in the region to collaborate in areas relating to economic well-being, strategic planning and the development of regional transport policies.
