Damansara Heights () is an upscale suburb in western side of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, located five kilometres away from the city centre. The suburb falls under the Segambut district and its parliamentary constituency. It is a sought-after residential and commercial address in Klang Valley.

Background 
Damansara Heights is accessible from Kuala Lumpur and Petaling Jaya. Jalan Maarof, in Bangsar, connects Jalan Damansara. Jalan Duta and Jalan Semantan can be used to enter into Damansara Heights from the North-South Expressway.

The Medan Damansara neighbourhood consisting of two storey link houses were built in 1972. It started as a residential scheme for government servants more than 20 years ago. The enclave hosts colleges, large multinational corporations, restaurants, regulatory bodies, and government departments.

The first office building built in Damansara Heights was Wisma Damansara, built in 1970 by Selangor Properties. This was followed by the Damansara Office Complex on Jalan Dungun, which at the time also housed the local stock exchange, Bursa Malaysia, and the offices of Shell Malaysia.

Damansara Heights is limited by its small amount of available commercial land and redevelopment is on hold. It is indicated by the demolishing of Wisma Socfin on Jalan Semantan for the construction of UOA II Damansara, along with several other buildings nearby. There are redevelopment plans for some office buildings in the area, such as Bangunan SPPK and Wisma Damansara. Wisma Beringin is undergoing refurbishment. Wisma Damansara is now being occupied wholly by HELP University.
