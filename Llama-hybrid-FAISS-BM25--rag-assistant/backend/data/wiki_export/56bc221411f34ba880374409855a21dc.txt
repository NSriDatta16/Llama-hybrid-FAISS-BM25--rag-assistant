Bursaray (sometimes stylized as BursaRay) is a rapid transit system in the city of Bursa, Marmara Region, Turkey, built in 2000 by TÜVASAŞ, and operated by Burulaş. The name Bursaray is a portmanteau of Bursa, and Ray, the Turkish word for "rail". The Bursaray metro opened for passenger service on 24 April 2002. The metro system presently consists of two lines, which share a main line in the east, and branch into two lines at the western end of the system.

After that, Burulas purchased 44 used 'Sneltram' Duewag SG2 (Duewag T-cars) from the city of Rotterdam; 25 of which were placed in service while the other 19 were used to provide spare parts as needed.
All Duewag SG2 cars are discontinued today.
