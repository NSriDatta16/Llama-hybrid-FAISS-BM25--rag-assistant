Liverpool Fútbol Club is a Uruguayan football club based in Montevideo. The team was first promoted to the Primera División in 1919 and plays its home games at Estadio Belvedere.

History
The club has its roots in the student team from the Catholic Capuchin school in Nuevo París, which began playing in 1908. The club took on the name Liverpool as there were many cultural links between the two areas; the majority of coal ships arriving in Montevideo came from the English port. A number of clubs took on Anglicised names, such as league rivals Montevideo Wanderers; in this case, the team paid homage to Liverpool FC.

Liverpool plays home matches in Estadio Belvedere (Belvedere Stadium), formerly owned by the Montevideo Wanderers.

In 2019 Liverpool won the Torneo Intermedio, their first 1st division title. In 2020, they won the Supercopa Uruguaya for the first time and finished a historic year by capturing the Torneo Clausura for the first time in its history.
