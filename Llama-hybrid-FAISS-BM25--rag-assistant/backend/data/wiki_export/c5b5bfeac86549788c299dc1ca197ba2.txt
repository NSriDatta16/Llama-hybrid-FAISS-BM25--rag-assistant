Uroš () is a South Slavic given or last name primarily spread amongst Serbs, and Slovenians. This noun has been interpreted as "lords", because it usually appears in conjunction with velmõžie () "magnates", as in the phrase  "magnates and lords". The noun was probably borrowed from the Hungarian word úr, "master" or "lord". The suffix -oš in uroš is found in a number of Slavic given or last names, particularly those of the Croats, Serbs, Czechs, and Poles.
