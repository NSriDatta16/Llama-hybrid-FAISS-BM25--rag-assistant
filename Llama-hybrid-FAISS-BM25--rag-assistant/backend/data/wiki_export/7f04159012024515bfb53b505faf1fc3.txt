Beverungen () is a town in Höxter district in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.

Geography

Location 
Beverungen lies in the Weser Uplands on the side of the Weser opposite Solling roughly 10 km south of Höxter. In parts of the eastern municipal area near the river, the town has a share of the Weser Valley, and to the west the higher Oberwälder Land natural region. In Beverungen (main town), the river Bever empties into the Weser.

Geopolitically, Beverungen thereby lies in eastern North Rhine-Westphalia at the three-state point shared with Lower Saxony and Hesse. The Weser forms the border with the former.

One peculiarity in the town's location is to be found at the constituent community of Würgassen (, which lies on the Weser's right (here, north) bank, which would actually mean that the community were in Lower Saxony had it not been for the way a long-standing boundary dispute was settled in 1837. Even today, the boundary does not quite put all the community in North Rhine-Westphalia; the local Shooting Brotherhood's shooting range still lies partly in North Rhine-Westphalia and partly in Lower Saxony.

Neighbouring communities

History 
The name "Beverungun" is known from as early as the mid 9th century. This was at first a noble estate with great landholdings, which soon developed into a village. About 1300, Bishop Bernhard of Paderborn began building work on the castle. The village was granted town rights in 1417. For over 500 years thereafter, Beverungen was a farming town.

The town reached both heights and depths through this time, one of the latter being the Plague striking the town in 1626, during the Thirty Years' War. The Hessians and the Swedes saw fit in 1632 to burn the town down, leaving only five houses standing afterwards. Thanks to the town's advantageous location, it soon recovered and quickly had a flourishing trade in grain, iron and glass from the glassworks in the Paderborner Land.

For centuries, Beverungen was the harbour town for the Prince-Bishopric of Paderborn. Even many people who went to the Americas began their journeys to the ocean steamers in Bremen here. Towards the end of the 19th century, a new economic upswing began with the railway's arrival and the building of a bridge across the Weser.

During World War II, a subcamp of Flossenbürg concentration camp was located here.

The current town of Beverungen with its 12 constituent communities was created in 1970.

Würgassen 
Its existence witnessed by documentary proof from the 10th century, Würgassen likely already existed in Charlemagne's time. In 1698, the stately home (Schloss) was completed.

Although the local folklore holds that the village's name came about from the story in which "Charlemagne had the Würgassen dwellers strangled in the lanes for reverting to heathen customs", or in German, "Karl der Große hat die Würgasser wegen eines Rückfalles in heidnische Sitten in den Gassen erwürgen lassen", this is certainly untrue. Rather, the village's original name was Wirrigsen, more closely akin to the terms Wirura (the Weser) and Gisen (bubble up). As late as the early 20th century, the Weser at Würgassen was still underlain by a good many rocks, so that the water was churned up.

The villagers who did not work in agriculture in earlier days hired themselves out foremost as sailors in the shipping on the river Weser. In the 1970s, many people were employed at the newly built Würgassen Nuclear Power Plant, which was abandoned in 1995 and is now being dismantled.

Coat of arms 
Beverungen's civic coat of arms might heraldically be described thus: In azure three fleurs-de-lis argent, two above, one below.

The fleur-de-lis only appeared in the town's official seal in the 17th century. At first, there was only one, but the now familiar design with three came into use in the 18th century. The charge is believed to represent the Bishop of Paderborn. The arms were officially conferred on 12 May 1917, and confirmed in 1970.

The current arms do not bear any likeness to the original town seal, which came into use at the time when Beverungen was granted town rights. This seal showed a town gate and Saint Vitus.
