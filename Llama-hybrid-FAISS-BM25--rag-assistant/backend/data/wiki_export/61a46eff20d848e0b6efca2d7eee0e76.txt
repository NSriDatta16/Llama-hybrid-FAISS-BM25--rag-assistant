The route crosses CR 601 and heads into urban residential areas with a few businesses, where it encounters CR 609. Upon crossing CR 611, CR 543 enters Pennsauken Township and turns east through industry, passing over the River Line near the 36th Street Station. From here, the road turns northeast again and passes through suburban areas of homes, intersecting CR 612 Spur and CR 612. After the CR 616 junction, the route heads into industrial areas and intersects CR 760 before passing under NJ Transit's Atlantic City Line. CR 543 crosses CR 614 and passes homes as it crosses under the Betsy Ross Bridge, which carries Route 90, and comes to the CR 615 junction. After crossing a railroad line, the route runs past more industrial establishments, passing the entrance to the Pennsauken – Route 73 River Line station.

Upon crossing the Pennsauken Creek, CR 543 enters Palmyra in Burlington County and immediately comes to an interchange with Route 73.

The road enters the commercial downtown of Palmyra and crosses CR 607 near the Palmyra Station of the River Line before reaching the CR 602 junction. The route gains a center left-turn lane and enters residential areas again and crosses into Riverton at the Elm Avenue intersection, coming to the CR 603 junction near the Riverton Station. After crossing the Pomeston Creek, CR 543 enters Cinnaminson Township and becomes Saint Mihiel Drive, running through residential and industrial areas, passing the Cinnaminson Station.  The road passes more industry as a four-lane undivided road, continuing into Delran Township, where it passes a marina to the north.
