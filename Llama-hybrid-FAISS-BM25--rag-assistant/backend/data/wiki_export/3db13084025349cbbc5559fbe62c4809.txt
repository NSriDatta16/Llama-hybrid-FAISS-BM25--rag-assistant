History 

The history of the stadium goes back to the 1970s, where the land which had been former farm called Totolco was acquired by the CEL and which would later be transferred to José Gregorio Martínez, the founder of Chalatenango. Martínez was a close friend of General Carlos Humberto Romero, who at that time was the president of El Salvador, and with his assistance a new stadium was built.

The idea was to create a multi sport complex, which included a football stadium, basketball courts and swimming pools, however, the last of these failed to be completed since Romero was ousted from the presidency in October 1979 and funding was lost.

The stadium was built with a capacity of 15,000 fans, with natural grass and which created a unique structure that help give the stadium its first name the 'Sombrero'.

In 1984, The club held a vote to change the name of the club, the options were between the former president Carlos Humberto Romero and the founder of the Chalatenango José Gregorio Martínez. By a large majority the club opted to rename the stadium Estadio José Gregorio Martínez."
