Austin Stacks is a hurling and Gaelic football club based in Tralee in County Kerry, Ireland. Founded in 1917, the club has more All-Ireland Senior Football Championship medals and GAA All-Stars than any other Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) club in Ireland.

History

Origins
Founded in 1917, the club is named after Austin Stack, Irish revolutionary and captain of the All-Ireland winning Kerry Gaelic football team of 1904. They are the only club in Kerry to have won Senior County Championships in both hurling and football, including doubles in 1928 and 1931.

Gaelic football
The club won the 1976–77 All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship.

Notable players with the club have included Joe Barrett, Mikey Sheehy, Ger Power, John O'Keeffe, Cork's Dinny Long, William Kirby, Kieran Donaghy (who won player of the year after leading Kerry to success in 2006) and Daniel Bohane. The club has more All-Ireland Senior Football Championship medals and GAA All-Stars than any other GAA club in Ireland.

One year after winning the competition, following a 3-22 to 1-15 loss to Kenmare Shamrock during the 2022 Kerry Senior Football Championship, Austin Stacks were relegated from the Senior Championship for the first time in their history. They were subsequently relegated to division 2 of the county league following a devastating loss to local rivals Kerins O’Rahillys in 2023.

Hurling
Austin Stacks have won the Kerry Senior Hurling Championship 4 times. They won the Kerry Junior Hurling Championship in 2012, 2015 and 2016. They now play in the Intermediate Championship. They also won Minor County Championships in 1955, 1967 and 1986.
