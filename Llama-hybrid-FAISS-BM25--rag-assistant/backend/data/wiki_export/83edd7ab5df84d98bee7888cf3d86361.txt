Terry Stickels (born May 14, 1948) is the author of numerous puzzle books, calendars, card decks and posters featuring critical thinking skills. Born in Omaha, Nebraska, he is the oldest of three children. Stickels is a lifelong member of Mensa, One In A Thousand Society (now known as Termite) and The International High IQ Society and the Epimetheus Society. He currently resides in Fort Worth, Texas.

Terry Stickels is a graduate of University of Nebraska at Omaha with a BS in Geography and Natural Sciences. He attended on a football scholarship where he played quarterback. While a student, he tutored in math and physics using puzzles as a non-intimidating approach to teaching concepts. After years of creating puzzles, Stickels began his publishing career in 1991 with a Rochester, NY weekly newspaper puzzle column.

Today Stickels is popular with business leaders, teachers and students for his presentations on having fun and success using an individual's mental flexibility. Stickels also pens three nationally syndicated columns. He currently works at KD College Prep in Colleyville.
