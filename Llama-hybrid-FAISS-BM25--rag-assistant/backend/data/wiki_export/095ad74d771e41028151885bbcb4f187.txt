The Artist and Journal of Home Culture, also The Artist, was a monthly art and design journal published in London by Archibald Constable & Co. from 1880 to 1902. From 1881 to 1894 the full title was The Artist and Journal of Home Culture. From 1896 the full title became The Artist: An Illustrated Monthly Record of Arts, Crafts and Industries. An American edition was published in New York by Truslove, Hanson & Comba.

Under the editorship of Charles Kains Jackson, 1888â€“94, The Artist and Journal of Home Culture contained a notable undercurrent of homoeroticism and had some importance in the homosexual subculture without being so overt as to alienate its mainstream readership. Described by scholar Thomas Waugh as a "closet pedophile" publication, it featured Uranian poetry and photographs of boys by Wilhelm von Gloeden.
