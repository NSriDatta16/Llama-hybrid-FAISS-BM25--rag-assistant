Style
His sculpture was mainly that of a so-called "academic style" with a strong influence of the typical facial and anatomical features of Mestizo Colombians with a larger component of Muisca features. This style is easy to recognize in his Mestizo muses in the Monument to Pan-American flags. During his early artistic career his role as professor of industrial and decorative painting for the Ministry of Education was quite important and influential.
He later taught natural painting, modeling workshops, handicrafts, and comparative anatomy for the School of Beaux Arts at the National University of Colombia, and painting and project presentation for the Faculty of Architecture.
