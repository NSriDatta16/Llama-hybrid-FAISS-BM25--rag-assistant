Flávio da Silva Amado (born 30 December 1979), better known as Flávio, is an Angolan former professional footballer who played as striker. He is the assistant of Angolan side Petro Atlético.

Club career
Flávio helped his team Al Ahly to participate in the FIFA Club World Championship two successive times in 2005 and 2006.

In the FIFA Club World Championship 2006 opening match against Auckland City FC of New Zealand on 10 December 2006, he scored the first goal, helping Al-Ahly to a 2–0 win. In the semi-final on 13 December 2006, Al Ahly faced South American champions Internacional, and Flávio played and scored an equaliser with a header in the second half but Al-Ahly eventually lost the match 1–2.

After having a very unsuccessful first season with the team during which he scored only one goal in the league, and being jeered by fans at many times, most notably when he missed a penalty kick against rivals El Zamalek in the African Champions League, Flávio had a very successful second season in 2006–2007, seeing him top the goalscorers chart of the Egyptian Premier League with 17 goals, a single goal ahead of international Egyptian teammate Emad Moteab. He proved to be instrumental in Al Ahly's formation in the next years, scoring many vital goals in critical moments. Generally Flávio kept an extremely low profile and rarely appears in the media or give any press statements. Such attitude is highly appreciated by his club administration, since it agrees with the club's policies.

In his last season with Al Ahly (2008–2009), Flávio managed to score Al Ahly's only goal during the Egyptian Premier League play-off against Ismaily, handing the title to Al Ahly for the fifth time in row and rewarding himself with the second personal title of the Egyptian Premier League Top Goalscorer, for the third time as a foreign player in the Egyptian Premier League history after John Utaka with Ismaily during the 2000–2001 season, then Flávio himself formerly during the 2006–2007 season.

At his time with Al Ahly he was very known in Egypt for his heading accuracy and it was known that Al Ahly played a tactic that Flávio's fellow Angola national football team and Al Ahly teammate Gilberto would play a long ball to him from the sides, and Flávio would score with his head. He did this on multiple occasions, earning Al Ahly multiple titles domestically and continentally.

International career
Flávio was a member of the Angola national team, and was called up to the 2006 FIFA World Cup, in which he scored Angola's only goal of the tournament, with a header against Iran to clinch a 1–1 draw.

He scored three goals for Angola in African Cup of Nations Egypt 2006, although they went out from the second round. His goals were against Cameroon and Togo.
