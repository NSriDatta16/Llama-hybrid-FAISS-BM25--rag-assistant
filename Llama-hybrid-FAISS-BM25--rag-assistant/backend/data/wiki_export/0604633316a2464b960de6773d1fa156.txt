Viscount Montagu was a title in the Peerage of England. It was created on 2 September 1554 for Anthony Browne of the Noble House of Montagu. It became extinct on the death of the ninth Viscount in 1797. The title Viscount Montagu was chosen from line of descent from John Neville, 1st Marquess of Montagu. His daughter, Lucy Neville, was the grandmother of Anthony Browne. He was made a Viscount to correlate to the wealth of the Browne family. Cowdray House became the established seat of the Viscounts Montagu.
