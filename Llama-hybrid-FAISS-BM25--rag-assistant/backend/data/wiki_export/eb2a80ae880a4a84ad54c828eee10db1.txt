Sister Sweetly is the third album by the Colorado rock band Big Head Todd and the Monsters, released in 1993. It was the band's first album with Giant Records. Sister Sweetly sold more than 1,000,000 copies, going platinum.

The album was on the charts for more than a year, but never hit the top half of the Billboard 200, peaking at number 117. The first single was "Broken Hearted Savior". The band supported the album by touring with 4 Non Blondes.

Production
The album was produced by David Z. All of its songs were written by frontman Todd Park Mohr.

Critical reception

Trouser Press called the album "a revelation," writing that "by taking on mostly shorter songs, Mohr forces his writing to be tighter and more economical." The Calgary Herald deemed it "flavorless, emotionless music that`s easy enough to enjoy but just as easy to forget."
