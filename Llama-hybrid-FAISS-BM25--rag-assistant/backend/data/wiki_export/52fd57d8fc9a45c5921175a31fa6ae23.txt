Haplogroup R is a widely distributed human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroup. Haplogroup R 
is associated with the peopling of Eurasia after about 70,000 years ago, and is distributed in modern populations throughout the world outside of sub-Saharan Africa.

Haplogroup R is a descendant of the macro-haplogroup N. Among the R clade's descendant haplogroups are B, U (and thus K), F, R0 (and thus HV, H, and V), and JT (the ancestral haplogroup of J and T).

Origin
Soares et al. (2009) estimate the age of haplogroup R at roughly 50,000 to 70,000 years ago.

This is consistent with an emergence in the course of the Coastal Migration out of East Africa to West, South and Southeast Asia. 
It has been suggested that the early lineage of haplogroups M, N and R along the coastal route during the period of roughly 70,000 to 60,000 years ago. The northern route out of Africa is another possibility, where the expansion of haplogroup R may originate from South East Asia

Haplogroup R has wide diversity and antiquity  in the indigenous population of South Asia. Tribes and castes of Western and Southern India
show higher diversity than the other regions, possibly suggesting their autochthonous status. Larruga et al. (2017) found mtDNA R spread out to Eurasia and Australia from  a core area along the Southeast Asian coast.
The Ust'-Ishim man fossil of Siberia, dated ca. 45,000 years old, belongs to haplogroup R* (formerly classified as U*).

Distribution
Haplogroup R and its descendants are distributed all over Australasia, Americas, Southeast Asia, South Asia, Central Asia, West Asia, East Asia, Europe, North Africa and Horn of Africa.

The basal R* clade is found among the Soqotri (1.2%), as well as in Northeast Africa (1.5%), the Middle East (0.8%), the Near East (0.8%), and the Arabian peninsula (0.3%).

Haplogroup R has also been observed among Egyptian mummies excavated at the Abusir el-Meleq archaeological site in Northern Egypt, which date from the Pre-Ptolemaic/late New Kingdom, Ptolemaic, and Roman periods.

Subclade R2 was observed in the remains of a Neolithic human from western Iran in Tepe Abdul Hosein.
