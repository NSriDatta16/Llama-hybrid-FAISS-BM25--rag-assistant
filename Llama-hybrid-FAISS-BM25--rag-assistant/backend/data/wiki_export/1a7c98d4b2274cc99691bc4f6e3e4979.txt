Club career

Early career
Born in Gliwice, Silesian Voivodeship, Cywka was part of the winning U-19 Gwarek Zabrze team which captured the 2006 Polish U-19 Championship.

Wigan Athletic
Following a successful week-long trial at Wigan Athletic, Cywka signed a three-year contract in July 2006 transferring him from Gwarek Zabrze to the Premier League side. He made his first appearance in September 2006 as a substitute against Crewe Alexandra in the League Cup.

In October 2006 he moved on loan to League One side Oldham Athletic where he made four substitute appearances.

He made his second appearance for Wigan in an FA Cup match against Tottenham in January 2009, coming on as a substitute in the 74th minute. In February 2009 Steve Bruce suggested that Cywka was on the verge of breaking into the first team, however, the following month Cywka suffered torn knee ligaments which would see him out until the following season.

Derby County
On 25 March 2010, Cywka joined Championship side Derby County on loan till the end of the season. He made his debut for Derby as a late sub in a loss against Ipswich before starting the final four matches of the season. In April, Derby manager Nigel Clough began talks to extend his stay at Pride Park Stadium into next season. On 25 May, it was announced that he would sign a two-year contract with Derby on a free transfer on 1 July, after turning down Wigan's extension offer due to his desire for first team football.

Cywka appeared in Derby's opening fixture for the 2010–11 season, an away match against Leeds United, in which the Rams won 2–1. His first goal for the club came on Saturday 14 August 2010 in a match which finished 2–1 to the visiting Cardiff City. Cywka suffered a fractured cheekbone in the same match. He quickly returned to action, however, and grabbed this 2nd and 3rd senior goals with a brace in a 4–1 win over Watford on 30 October 2010, which earned him a place in the Championship Team of the Week. Cywka again started against Portsmouth at Pride Park and won a penalty after being fouled in the box, Robbie Savage scored the opener from the spot and the Rams went on to record a 2–0 victory. His 4th goal came in the 3–2 victory over Scunthorpe United, scoring within the first 5 minutes.

On 5 February 2011, Cywka was openly criticised by Derby boss Nigel Clough after his losing of the ball late in the game led to a late equaliser in a 1–1 draw at Portsmouth. Of Cywka, Clough said "He's an extremely inexperienced and not very bright footballer ... he can go back to Wigan or wherever he came from – I'm not really bothered – until he learns the game." These incidents led PFA Chief Gordon Taylor to criticise Clough, saying "It cannot be appropriate to criticise your team in such a way in public. We'll sort things out ... otherwise it looks an untenable situation.". Despite the criticisms after the Portsmouth game Cywka made a further six appearances for the Rams before being ruled out for the remainder of the season with a knee ligament injury.

Cywka found himself out of the side for the start of the 2011–12 season as Derby made their best start to a season for over 100 years. His first league appearance came in the seventh fixture, away at Nottingham Forest, but he was withdrawn after just four minutes when the dismissal of Frank Fielding led to the need for a tactical reshuffle. Three late substitute appearances followed before he earned his second start of the campaign in the twelfth match of the season, away to Reading, when injuries had left Derby with just Cywka and Theo Robinson to choose from amongst the club's strikers. In the event, Cywka scored his first goal of the season in the 75th minute to give Derby a 2–1 lead in a match they eventually drew 2–2. After a succession of poor performances and losing his place in the first team, Cywka was told by Derby manager Nigel Clough in January 2012 that he was free to leave the club on a free transfer. This followed the news that a move to a Polish club had broken down, which later turned out to be Ekstraklasa leaders Śląsk Wrocław.
