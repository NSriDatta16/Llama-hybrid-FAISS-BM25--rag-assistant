Negro National League final standings
This was the eleventh of twelve seasons of the original Negro National League. For the second time in three years, the St. Louis Stars were champions of the Negro National League, owing to their postseason victory over the Detroit Stars on September 13–22.

East (independent teams) final standings
A loose confederation of teams were gathered in the East to compete with the West, however East teams did not organize a formal league as the West did.

Negro league postseason
By 1930, there had been no organized league for East Coast baseball in the Negro leagues (owing to the dissolution of the Eastern Colored League in 1928 and American Negro League in 1929). The remaining teams from the ANL and ECL played independent ball together, but they also played against teams from the Midwest. As such, the Homestead Grays challenged two teams from the NNL two distinct Series that were held over various stadiums and dates. The Grays challenged the St. Louis Stars in St. Louis on April 19 and April 22 and won twice. They challenged the Detroit Stars to four games held from August 21 to August 28 (two in Akron and two in Detroit), which Homestead won three. On August 30-September 3, they challenged the Stars to five games (all in St. Louis), and the Stars won four of five. At any rate, the independent East teams then had an "East Coast Championship Series", which matched the Grays and the New York Lincoln Giants (in that same month, the Negro National League had their Championship Series), with ten games spread out over Pittsburgh, New York, and Philadelphia.

1930 East Coast Championship Series: Homestead Grays over New York Lincoln Giants, 6–4
