The Briefing was an evangelical Christian magazine published by Matthias Media in partnership with The Good Book Company (UK). It was printed monthly, and was circulated in Australia, North America and the United Kingdom. Although it was contributed by and targeted towards Christians of all denominations, the magazine had a distinctly Sydney Anglican slant. The magazine existed between 1988 and 2014.
