On May 28, 2018, KYSX was rebranded as "105.1 Star FM" and still playing adult contemporary and light rock music.

On January 16, 2019, KYSX returned to the mainstream rock format from adult contemporary branded as "105.1 The Bone". The station went back to the same format it had in 2015 before flipping three times. The Bone enters a crowded rock field as The Bone intends to compete with active rock 96.3 the Zone as well as 103.7 the Hawk as My 105.9 and flanking 99.3 The Mountain. The flip took place in the middle of John Tesh with the first song being Seether "The Remedy".
