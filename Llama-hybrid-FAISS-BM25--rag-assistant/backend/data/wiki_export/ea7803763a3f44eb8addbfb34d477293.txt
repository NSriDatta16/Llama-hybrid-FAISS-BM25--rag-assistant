Established in 2005, Level Comics is a division of Elex Media Komputindo that publishes seinen, shonen with a strong violence, and also josei manga in Indonesia. Elex Media Komputindo has been publishing manga in Indonesia since 1990. As the readers of manga became more mature, Elex Media decided to start a new division that was more suitable and enjoyable for older manga readers. The first releases of Level Comics were Homunculus, by Hideo Yamamoto, Vagabond, by Takehiko Inoue, 20th Century Boys, by Naoki Urasawa and X, by Clamp.
