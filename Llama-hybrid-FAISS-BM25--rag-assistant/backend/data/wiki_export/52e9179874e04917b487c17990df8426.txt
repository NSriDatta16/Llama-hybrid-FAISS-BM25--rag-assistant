Haplogroup P also known as P-F5850  or K2b2 is a Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup in human genetics. P-F5850 is a branch of K2b (previously Haplogroup MPS; P331), which is a branch of Haplogroup K2 (K-M526).

The haplogroup K2b splits into K2b1 (haplogroup MS*) and K2b2 (haplogroup P-F580, Y-DNA P*). Basal P* (P-PF5850*) is found in Southeast Asia. The primary branches (clades) of P-F580 are P-P295 (P1a, formerly P*) which is found among South and Southeast Asians as well as Oceanians, P-FT292000 (P1b, formerly P3) with unknown distribution, and P-M45 (P1c, formerly P1) commonly found among Siberians and Central Asians. P-M45 (P1c) is, in turn, the parent node of Haplogroup Q (Q-M242) and Haplogroup R (R-M207).

The major subclades of Haplogroups P-M45, Q and R now include most males among Europeans, Native Americans, South Asians and Central Asians.

Origin and dispersal 

Karafet et al. 2015 suggests an origin and dispersal of haplogroup P from either South Asia or Southeast Asia as part of the early human dispersal, based on the distribution of subclades now classified as P-P295 (now P1a), and more ancient clades such as K1 and K2. However, Karafet, et al. mentions that this hypothesis is "parsimonius" and it is just as likely that it originated elsewhere in Eurasia and later went extinct there. Hallast, Agdzhoyan, et al. concluded that the ancestral Eurasian haplogroups C, D, and F, either expanded from the Middle East or from Southeast Asia. Based on the modern distribution of basal lineages, the authors propose Southeast Asia as place of dispersal for all Eurasian lineages, before the split between West-Eurasian and East-Eurasian (including Oceanian) populations.

According to a study by geneticist Spencer Wells, haplogroup K, from which haplogroup P descend, originated in the Middle East or Central Asia. It is likely that haplogroup P diverged somewhere in South Asia into P1 (now P1c), which expanded into Siberia and Northern Eurasia, and into P2 (now P1a), which expanded into Oceania and Southeast Asia.

Structure 

The subclades of Haplogroup P with their defining mutation:

P (P-F5850)
P1 (P295/PF5866/S8, 92R7_1, 92R7_2, F91/PF5862/V231)
P1a (B253/Z33760/Z33761/Z33762/Z33763)
P1b (FT292000)
P1c (M45/PF5962)
Q (M242)
R (M207, P224, P227, P229, P232, P280, P285, L248.2, V45)

Distribution

P1(xP1c) 
Because P1a, formerly P2 (P-B253) was discovered relatively recently, it is not always clear if older studies have screened for it. Therefore, cases of basal P1* (also known as P-P295*; K2b2*; PxM45, B253) reported in literature may include P1a (P2).

P1(xP1c) exists at low to moderate levels among various groups in Island South East Asia, the South West Pacific and East Asia.

P1* (perhaps P1a/P2) is found at its highest rate among members of the Aeta (or Agta), a people indigenous to Luzon who formed from various ancient groups, such as Oceanians and Austronesian peoples from Taiwan. P1 is most common among individuals in Siberia and Central Asia, as well as in Southern Asian at lower frequency.

Root P* (P-PF5850*) was found among a Jehai sample in Malaysia. Basal P1* was also found in one historical 19th-century Andaman islander,

P-M45 (P1c) 
Many ethnic groups with high frequencies of P1c, also known as P-M45 and K2b2a, are located in Central Asia and Siberia: 35.4% among Tuvans, 28.3% among Altai-Kizhi (PxQ-M3,R1), and 35% among Nivkh males.

ยง May include members of haplogroup R2.

Q

Near universal in the Kets (95%) of Siberia. Very common in pre-modern Native American populations and Selkups, except for the Na-Dene peoples, where it reaches 50-90%. Also common, at 25-50% in Siberian populations such as the Siberian Tatars, Nivkh, Tuvans, Chukchi, Siberian Eskimos, Northern Altaians, and in 30% of Turkmens.

R
The only discovered case of basal R* (i.e. one that does not belong to R1 or R2) is the Mal'ta Boy in the Upper Paleolithic on the upper Angara River in the area west of Lake Baikal in the Irkutsk Oblast, Siberia, Russian Federation.

R1

R2
Haplogroup R2 is most common in South Asia and south Central Asia, as well as diaspora populations, such as the Romanis.

P1a (P-B253, formerly P2) 
The Aeta (or Agta) people of Luzon in the Philippines have also provided the only known samples of P1a (P-B253).
