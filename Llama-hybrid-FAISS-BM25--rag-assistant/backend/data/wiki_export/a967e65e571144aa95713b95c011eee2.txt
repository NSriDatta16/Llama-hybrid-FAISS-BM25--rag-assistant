KMMA-CD, virtual and digital channel 41, was a low-power, Class A 3ABN Latino-affiliated television station licensed to San Luis Obispo, California, United States. The station was owned by Caballero Television.

History

On May 15, 1996, KMMA-CD signed on as K18FF, and the station was later granted Class A status in 2003.

On September 25, 2006, KMMA-CA switched to the new MTV Tres network (now simply known as Tres since July 2010), which was created as a result of Viacom's acquisition of Mas Musica.

On August 3, 2015, KMMA-CD dropped the MTV Tres affiliation and started broadcasting Spanish religious programming from 3ABN Latino.

On September 30, 2016, KMMA-CD added a digital subchannel with Lifehacks DRTV, which features a near-all paid programming schedule.

On April 13, 2017, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced that KMMA-CD was a successful bidder in the spectrum auction, and would be surrendering its license in exchange for $173,076. Caballero Television surrendered KMMA-CD's license to the FCC for cancellation on July 27, 2017.
