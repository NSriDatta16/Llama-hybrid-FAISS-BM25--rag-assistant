History
FM 1419 was originally designated on July 15, 1949, from the junction with FM 511 to South Point. On October 7 of that year, the northward extension from South Point to SH 4 was approved, replacing a section of FM 511. The eastern addition, to SH 4, was designated on September 21, 1955. On June 27, 1995, the western section of the route, from SH 4 to FM 511, was officially redesignated as Urban Road 1419 (UR 1419), but that section was changed back to FM 1419 on November 15, 2018. On April 29, 2010, the sections from 1.9 miles west of FM 3068 to FM 3068 and from .04 mile north of Dockberry Road to 0.7 miles south of SH 4 were redesignated as SH 32.  The section from FM 3068 to .04 mile north of Dockberry Road was designated as FM 3550. The section from 0.7 miles south of SH 4 to SH 4 was redesignated as FM 3551. Since SH 32 has not been built yet, signage has not changed.
