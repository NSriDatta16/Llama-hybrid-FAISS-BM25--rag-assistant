Career
In Las Vegas, Pardey primarily played seven-card stud. In the late 1970s David Sklansky ranked Pardey the number one seven-card stud player in the world. By the end of the 1970s, Pardey was regularly playing as high as $1,000-$2,000. When hold'em became popular in the 1980s, Pardey expressed his trouble in adjusting. In May 1995, Pardey played regularly in Los Angeles, California.
