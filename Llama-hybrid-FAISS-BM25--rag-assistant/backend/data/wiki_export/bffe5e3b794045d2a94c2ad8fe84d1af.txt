The Journal Editorial Report is a weekly American interview and panel discussion TV program on Fox News Channel, hosted by Paul Gigot, editorial page editor of The Wall Street Journal. Prior to moving to Fox News, the show aired on PBS for 15 months, ending on December 2, 2005.

Opening with a newsmaker of the week, Gigot usually interviews a guest for the first half of the program, asking questions related to the writings of the guest or a current event of interest to the guest.

Following the guest segment, the program becomes a panel discussion of Wall Street Journal editorial writers giving their opinions on the political, economic, and cultural issues of the current week. The final segment labeled Hits and Misses lets the panelists comment on the best and worst stories or events of the week.

The program is broadcast Saturdays at 3:00 p.m. and Sundays at 3:00 p.m.  (Eastern)

The transcript of each show appears on OpinionJournal.com on the following Monday.
