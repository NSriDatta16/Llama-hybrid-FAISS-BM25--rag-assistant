Hebron High School (HHS) is one of five public high schools in the Lewisville Independent School District and is located in Carrollton, Texas. The school opened in 1999 and was the fourth high school to do so in its district. It services communities from far west Plano, southwest Frisco, small portions of far east The Colony, far north Carrollton, and far southeast Lewisville. Hebron serves grades ten through twelve; ninth graders attend the adjacent Hebron High School 9th Grade Campus. In 2015, the school was rated “Met Standard” by the Texas Education Agency. Hebron is currently classified as a 6A school by the University Interscholastic League.

History
On April 10, 1997, ground was broken on the second of two new high schools in the Lewisville Independent School District. Situated on 70 acres of land, the school was intended to allow students from north Carrollton to avoid the commute to The Colony High School and Marcus High School. While the school was intended to be named the "North Carrollton High School," potential confusion between it and another school in construction - Carrollton-Farmers Branch Independent School District's planned "Carrollton North High School" - led to the renaming of both schools. While the names "East Side High School" and "West View High School" were considered by Lewisville ISD as replacements, the name "Hebron High School" was ultimately selected in reference to a school of the same name which was built in the same area during the late 19th century.

Hebron was the fourth high school opened by Lewisville ISD, totaling $23 million in preliminary construction costs alone. Hebron was constructed in five phases, with the first three fulfilling the school's immediate student-enrollment needs; construction of the first three phases was completed in June 1998. The fourth and fifth phases included classroom additions and an 800-seat auditorium and were completed after the school's opening. Hebron High School was originally located in the town of Hebron, but its land has since been incorporated into Carrollton.

When Hebron was being built, Lewisville ISD asked students of Arbor Creek Middle School to submit ideas for the mascot and student body nickname of the future school. Suggestions included the “Hawks,” the “Hippos,” and the “Hurricanes”; ultimately, it was decided that the “Hawks” best fit the school. Although the school's colors are black, silver, and royal blue, the school was constructed before this was decided; as such, the interior of the school follows an unrelated yellow and green color scheme.

The school opened in 1999, originally only serving two grade levels and 498 students; eventually, the school would expand to serve grades nine through twelve. In 2010, the Hebron High School 9th Grade Campus was opened adjacent to the main campus to relieve stress caused by a growing student body.

As of the 2018-2019 school year, HHS serves 133 Bilingual/ESL students, 350 students in the Gifted and Talented (GT) Program, and 240 students through special education services. HHS also participates in the Advanced Placement Program. 46% of students take at least one AP Exam, with a passing rate of 81.8%.

Yearly, dozens of Hebron students are named National Merit commended students - several of whom advance to Semi-Finalist and Finalist status.

Hebron High School students are able to acquire career and technical education (CTE) at two different career centers, Dale Jackson Career Center and Technology, Exploration & Career Center EAST (TECC-E). These two secondary campuses for high school students opened in 2010 to accommodate Lewisville ISD's growing CTE student population.
