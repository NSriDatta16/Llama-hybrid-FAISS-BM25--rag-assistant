More than 800 people were killed during an unsuccessful attempt by rebellious officers in the north African nation of Sudan to overthrow the government of President Jaafar Nimeiry.  At 5:00 in the morning, Nimeiry had arrived at the Khartoum airport after concluding official visits to the United States and France, and was driven back to the presidential palace.  A force of 17 rebels drove up to the airport at 5:10, firing their way into the terminal with plans to kill Nimeiry as he was disembarking from his flight.  Troops from the nearby military camp in Shagara attempted to capture him, even surrounding the presidential palace with tanks, before other troops loyal to Nimeiry suppressed the rebellion. Investigators concluded that Nimeiry's life had been saved because his airplane had arrived 15 minutes ahead of schedule due to tail winds on his flight back to Khartoum, and he had already landed and exited his plane; "He was in a building 100 yards from the main terminal when the shooting began and was whisked away in an unmarked car."  Death sentences were carried out on August 4 and 5 against 98 conspirators who were shot by a firing squad including the coup leader, Brigadier General Mohammed Nur Saeed of Sudan's Army, who had led the effort involving more than 1,000 troops who had been trained in camps in Libya.

Nadia Comăneci of Romania became the first gymnast in Olympic history to receive a perfect score (10.00), after being judged perfect in her performance on the uneven parallel bars as part of the compulsory gymnastics exercises event, and went on to win the first of six gold medals.  The opinion of the judges was protested by the Soviet gymnastics team, without success.  Comaneci had been judged perfect in lower-level competitions prior to appearing in Montreal; a press report noted at the time that her mark was "the first in modern Olympic history but Nadia's 17th."  According to another observer, a perfect score had been given by one of the four judges in Olympic competition in the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo but "at least three of the four judges must score 10.00 before the overall score comes up the same." The 14-year-old prodigy of the gymnastics school of Béla Károlyi would achieve six more perfect scores and gold medals before the games concluded.

The Viking 1 lander successfully landed on Mars at 11:53:06 UTC (7:53 a.m. Eastern time), touching down at Chryse Planitia after a descent from the Viking orbiter more than three hours earlier.  The lander, the first U.S. craft to land on Mars, transmitted the first-ever pictures from the surface.  Chemical analysis of the Martian atmosphere showed "a small component of nitrogen".
U.S. baseball player Hank Aaron, holder of the record for most career home runs in Major League Baseball since breaking the record of Babe Ruth in 1974, hit the 755th and final home run of his career, playing for the Milwaukee Brewers at home against the California Angels. He retired at the end of the 1976 season. Aaron's MLB record of 755 would stand for 31 years until broken on August 7, 2007 by Barry Bonds of the San Francisco Giants.
American criminal Gary Gilmore was arrested after murdering two Brigham Young University students in separate incidents in Utah.  He would later become the first person in the United States to be executed after the restoration of the death penalty.  The day before his arrest, Gilmore had killed Max Jensen, a 25-year-old night attendant at a Sinclair gas station, during a robbery in Orem, Utah.  He followed hours later with the killing of Bennie Bushnell, a night manager at the City Central Motel in Provo.  In both cases, the victims had cooperated with Gilmore's instructions to lie face down, and he shot both in the back of the head anyway.  Gilmore was caught after he accidentally shot himself in the hand while attempting to dispose of the murder weapon, a .22-caliber pistol.  Convicted of Jensen's murder on October 7 and given the death sentence the same day, Gilmore refused to appeal the verdict or the sentence and would be executed by firing squad on January 17, 1977, less than six months after the murders, becoming the first person to be legally executed in the United States since the restoration of the death penalty.

About 250 American military advisers remained as part of military aid agreement between the U.S. and Thailand.  At the height of the American presence in Thailand, 48,000 troops were stationed in 93 installations around the Asian kingdom.

A bomb placed by the Irish Republican Army killed Christopher Ewart-Biggs, the British Ambassador to Ireland, as well as his secretary, Judith Cooke. Ewart-Biggs had been picked up at the British ambassador's official residence on the south outskirts of Dublin and was  from home when the vehicle ran over the mine packed with at least  of explosives at 9:32 in the morning. The Ambassador and Britain's Under Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Brian Cubbon, were on their way to a meeting with Irish Foreign Minister Garret FitzGerald.  The bomb itself had been placed in a culvert beneath the road and was detonated from  away by three men.  Cubban and the chauffeur of the Jaguar limousine, Brian O'Driscoll, were injured.  Ewart-Biggs had become the Ambassador only two weeks earlier and was only 54 years old at the time of his assassination.

The first ever color photographs of Mars (as opposed to the black and white pictures sent the day before) were transmitted from the Viking 1 lander the day after its arrival on the planet, and confirmed that the soil and rocks were a reddish color, similar to rust.  The more surprising discovery was that the sky on Mars was light blue, which American scientists believed was from a high amount of dust and water vapor in the thin Martian atmosphere.

On August 7, two fishermen found his decomposing body in a metal oil barrel that was floating in Biscayne Bay.  Although the barrel had been chopped with holes and weighed down with chains to sink to the bottom of the sea, gases formed by the decomposition process and trapped inside Roselli's body tissue brought him to the surface.
