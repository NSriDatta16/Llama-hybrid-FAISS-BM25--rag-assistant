Cinoxate is an organic compound used as an ingredient in some types of sunscreens.  It is an ester formed from methoxycinnamic acid and 2-ethoxyethanol.  It is a slightly yellow viscous liquid that is insoluble in water, but miscible with alcohols, esters, and vegetable oils.

It was approved as UV filter in the USA by the FDA in 1961, but it is not commonly used in cosmetic formulations anymore.
