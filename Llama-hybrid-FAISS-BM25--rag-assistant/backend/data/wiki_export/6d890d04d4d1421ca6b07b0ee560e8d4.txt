"Nth Degree" is a song by New York City band Morningwood from its debut album Morningwood. "Nth Degree" reached No. 30 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song was used in a Mercury vehicles ad campaign that featured actress Jill Wagner. It was also included on the soundtrack for the video game Thrillville: Off the Rails.

Music video
The video opens with a person browsing through some records. Each record shows the band on sets and in costumes carefully calculated to reference and parody about 16 other famous album covers or music videos from 20th century popular music.  The album Morningwood is selected and begins playing on a record player just as the video ends.
