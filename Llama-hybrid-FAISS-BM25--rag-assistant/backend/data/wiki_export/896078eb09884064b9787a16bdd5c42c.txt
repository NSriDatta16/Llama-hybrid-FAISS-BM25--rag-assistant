Stapenhill is a suburban village and civil parish in Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire in the UK.

History
Stapenhill was a small village owned by Nigel of Stafford as far back as 1086, however, this ancient parish area has long since been surrounded by new housing developments and gradually absorbed into the Burton urban area. Stapenhill was known for its brickyards in the 18th and 19th centuries. The Ratcliff brewery family provided public baths (since demolished) for Stapenhill in the 1870s, and homes for local workers in Balfour Street and Craven Street.

The village is east of the Trent, and thus was administered as part of Derbyshire from at least 1086 until the Local Government Act 1888, when it passed into Staffordshire as a result of boundary changes.  The boundaries of the original ancient village were Rosliston Road, Cumberland Road, Short Street and Norfolk Road.

Cultural life
Several major music festivals take place every summer at Catton Hall, on the outskirts of the village.

Stapenhill Gardens is the epitome of Stapenhill. Its main feature is a giant artificial swan with all flowers planted in it. This represents the swans who have historically inhabited the Gardens, and also the wider immutability of life in general. Similarly, the local football team is Stapenhill F.C. nicknamed "The Swans." Stapenhill Gardens is also the location of the annual "Tulip Festival", an event unrivalled outside The Netherlands, although this has not run for several years.

Amenities
Current and former pubs and bars in the area include The Copper Hearth (now a Tesco supermarket), The New Inn, The Punch Bowl (now a care home), The Barley Mow (new home of the BIS), The Crown, The Grove, The Dart (now closed), The Freehold Tavern (now a Chinese restaurant), The Plough (now demolished for housing), and The Elms. 

Stapenhill is well known for its wide variety of shopping opportunities, ranging from major chain-stores to independent craft butchers.  The primary retail centres are Main Street; Rosliston Road/Brackenwood Road area; and Short Street/Lincoln Road.

Other local features include St Peter's Church of England church and a large cemetery.
The municipal cemetery was opened in 1866 with chapels and a turreted gateway designed by Lucy and Littler of Liverpool.
