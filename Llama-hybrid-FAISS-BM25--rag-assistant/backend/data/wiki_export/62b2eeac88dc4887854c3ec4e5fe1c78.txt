History
The town of Statenville was originally called Troublesome. It grew up at a ford on the Alapaha River in the 1850s. Troublesome was renamed Statenville when the latter was designated county seat in 1858 of the newly-formed Echols County. It is named for James Watson Staten, but was erroneously incorporated as "Statesville" in 1859. In 1965, the state officially amended the city's charter to read "Statenville". In 1995, a new state law revoked the city charter, along with dozens of others in Georgia which had inactive governments. This left Echols and Webster as the only counties in Georgia with no incorporated communities whatsoever.

Columbia County has the unincorporated county seat of Appling, though most court functions take place in Evans.

Knoxville is the unincorporated county seat of Crawford County, with the city of Roberta just to its west that grew with the railroad.
