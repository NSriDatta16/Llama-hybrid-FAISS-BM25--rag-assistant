Kickboxing weight classes are weight classes that pertain to the sport of kickboxing.

Organizations will often adopt their own rules for weight limits, causing ambiguity in the sport regarding how a weight class should be defined. For a variety of reasons (largely historical), weight classes of the same name can be of vastly different weights. For example, a boxing middleweight weighs up to 72 kg (160 lb), an ISKA middleweight upper limit is 75 kg (165 lb), and a K-1 middleweight upper limit is 70 kg (154 lb).
