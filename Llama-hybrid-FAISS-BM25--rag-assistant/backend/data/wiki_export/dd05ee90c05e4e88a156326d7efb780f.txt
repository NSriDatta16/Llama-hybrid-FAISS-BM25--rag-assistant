Arundel was twice a parliamentary constituency in the Kingdom of England, the Kingdom of Great Britain, and the United Kingdom. The first incarnation strictly comprised the town centre of Arundel and was a borough constituency in Sussex first enfranchised in 1332 and disfranchised in 1868 under the Reform Act 1867. Arundel initially elected two members, but this was reduced to one in 1832 by the Great Reform Act.

The second incarnation was broader, reaching to Bognor Regis. It was created by the Boundary Commission in the 1974 boundary changes, and existed until 1997. This Arundel seat elected only one member. The territory previously covered by Arundel was split between Arundel & South Downs and Bognor Regis & Littlehampton constituencies.
