Andrew Jones (born 24 June 1980) is an Australian racing driver who previously competed in the Supercars Championship and Dunlop Super2 Series, driving with family-owned team Brad Jones Racing for majority of his career.

Jones has had success in a number of forms of motorsport in Australia. In 2004 he won the Konica Minolta V8 Supercar Series, the second tier series, and went on to secure a drive with Garry Rogers Motorsport in the 2005 V8 Supercar Championship Series. In 2006, he joined Tasman Motorsport, replacing Jamie Whincup but had a frustrating and disappointing year. It was announced that he was moving back to Albury to re-join his uncle Brad and father Kim's team, Brad Jones Racing, replacing John Bowe at the start of the 2007 season. His cousin Macauley Jones also races.
