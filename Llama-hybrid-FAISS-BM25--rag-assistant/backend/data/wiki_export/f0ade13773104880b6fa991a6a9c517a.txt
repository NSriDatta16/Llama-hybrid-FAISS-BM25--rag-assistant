Michael Therriault is a Canadian actor. He attended Etobicoke School of the Arts in Toronto, Sheridan College in Oakville, and was a member of the inaugural season of the Birmingham Conservatory for Classical Theatre Training in Stratford, Ontario.

Life and career
After spending seven seasons at the Stratford Festival, Therriault left the classical repertoire theatre for musical theatre, starring as Leopold Bloom in the short-lived Toronto production of The Producers. For the performance Therriault won a Dora Award for Principal Actor in a Musical.

In 2006, Therriault portrayed Tommy Douglas in the CBC Television special Prairie Giant: The Tommy Douglas Story. He was subsequently nominated for a Gemini Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Dramatic Program or Mini-Series. The show received a total of nine nominations, including Best Writing in a Dramatic Program or Mini-Series and Best Dramatic Mini-Series.  However, it was also heavily criticised for its historical inaccuracies, leading the CBC to pull it from future broadcasts.

While on Broadway in a revival of Fiddler on the Roof, Therriault got news that he had secured the role of Gollum in the Toronto premiere of The Lord of the Rings: The Musical. He received his second Dora for the performance.

When it closed, he returned to Saskatchewan to film the made-for-television adaptation of Guy Vanderhaeghe's The Englishman's Boy (it aired in two parts on March 2 and 9, 2008, and is now available on DVD).

In May 2007, The Lord of the Rings moved to London, with Therriault reprising the role he originated.  The production closed on July 19, 2008, after 492 performances.

On Monday, October 20, 2008, Therriault took part in a tribute to the late Richard Monette, former artistic director of the Stratford Shakespeare Festival.

Therriault performed in The Sound of Silence, a tribute to Paul Simon at the Bathurst Street Theatre in Toronto on April 20, 2009.

On April 27, 2009, it was announced that Therriault will appear as Irving Berlin, alongside Michael Boatman as Scott Joplin, in The Tin Pan Alley Rag, which centers around the imagined meeting of the two great musicians.  The Tin Pan Alley Rag is presented by Roundabout Theatre Company in New York, June 12 to September 6, 2009.

Therriault has been a recurring actor in the Chucky franchise, having played the main human villain in the 7th film Cult of Chucky and two separate characters on episodes of the TV series  Chucky.

He appeared as Dr. Doheny in the 2023 film Fitting In.
