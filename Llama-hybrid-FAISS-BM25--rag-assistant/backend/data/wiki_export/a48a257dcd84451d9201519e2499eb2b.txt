Tooth, Fang & Claw is the sixth studio album by the Amboy Dukes, credited as "Ted Nugent's Amboy Dukes". The band's second release on DiscReet Records, it was the final album released under the Amboy Dukes name before Ted Nugent launched his solo career the following year.

Composition

AllMusic said that Tooth, Fang & Claw demonstrates "Nugent's further emerging hard rock sound", as well as an intentional shifting away from the blues sound that the Amboy Dukes had displayed on their Polydor recordings and the psychedelia of the band's Mainstream albums; the band does not experiment with their sound on Tooth, Fang & Claw as they had on their previous albums.

Reception

Following this album's release, Ted Nugent moved forward to national and worldwide success. In a retrospective review, AllMusic said that the Amboy Dukes' releases on DiscReet Records "document the forging of a sound and identity", establishing Ted Nugent as "a true rock icon."
