Spruce Mountain ranks twenty-fifth among the most topographically prominent peaks in the state. The summit is at . Spruce Mountain is on a northeastâ€“southwest trending ridge with a parallel Spruce Ridge to the northwest. To the east, a low section of hills connects the mountain to the south end of the Pequop Mountains. US Route 93 passes the southwest end of the mountain. The peak is on public land administered by the Bureau of Land Management and thus has no access restrictions.

The western side of the mountain was the site of copper, silver, and lead mining during the late 19th century. The settlement of Sprucemont on the western slope of the mountain supported the mining activity and existed from 1868 through about 1900 and is now a ghost town. Electronics researcher Ralph Hartley was born at Sprucemont in 1888.
