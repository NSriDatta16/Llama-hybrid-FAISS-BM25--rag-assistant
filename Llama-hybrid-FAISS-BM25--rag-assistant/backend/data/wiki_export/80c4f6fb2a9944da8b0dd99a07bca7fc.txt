History

Group Formed 1992
Dam Native is a New Zealand hip hop group that was prominent during the mid- to late-1990s. Its first members consisted of Danny Haimona and Bennett Pomana, now an ex-member. The group formed in 1992 under the name Native Bass and released an album at a time when the industry was virtually devoid of any New Zealand hip hop.

Dam Native focuses on Māori issues and other political issues relating to New Zealand. The group have released two albums, Kaupapa Driven Rhymes Uplifted (sometimes shortened to K.D.R.U.) released in 1997 and ''Aotearoa... Nobody Does It Better" released in 2010.
