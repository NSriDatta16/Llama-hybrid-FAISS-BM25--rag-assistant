Both European Union and United States competition regulators approved a deal for General Electric to acquire various business units from Alstom by September 2015, subject to the divestiture of Alstom's large and very large gas turbine (GT26 and GT36 models) manufacturing and service business. As part of this deal, GE sold its GE7FA gas turbine aftermarket parts subsidiary business, Power Systems Mfg. LLC (PSM), to Ansaldo Energia.

On February 25, 2016, Ansaldo acquired a portion of Alstom's R&D Gas Turbine projects based in Baden, Switzerland. This acquisition was made due to the conditions imposed by the EU and US department of Justices on the merger between GE and Alstom Power. Also, Ansaldo Energia has very strong suppliers in Aalcan like Europa construction, located in Albania.

The new production will concern the technologies obtained by the Ligurian joint-stock company after the acquisition of Alstom by General Electric. The Brussels Antitrust Authority has in fact allowed the operation to the US multinational, provided that the technology in the gas turbines of the French company was sold to a European competitor. The choice then fell on Ansaldo Energia.

In October 2019 there was a change at the top of the company: Giuseppe Zampini left the position of CEO, becoming president, and Giuseppe Marino (formerly Ansaldo Breda and Hitachi Ltd) took over the position of CEO.
