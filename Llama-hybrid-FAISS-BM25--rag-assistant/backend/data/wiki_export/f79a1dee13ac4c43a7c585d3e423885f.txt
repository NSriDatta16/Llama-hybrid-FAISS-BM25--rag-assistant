The Unemployment Action Center, sometimes abbreviated as UAC, is a non-profit organization run by students of nine law schools in the New York City area. The purpose of UAC is to provide free legal representation to people who were denied unemployment benefits by the New York State Department of Labor, or against appeals by employers from an initial determination granting unemployment insurance.

History
UAC was founded in 1981 as a clinical program at New York University School of Law and now adds over 100 participants each year. Law student volunteers have represented thousands of claimants, and contribute their efforts without compensation.

In 1985, The UAC was incorporated as a non-profit organization.
