KSAO-LD (channel 49) is a low-power television station in Sacramento, California, United States, serving as the outlet of the 24/7 headline news service NewsNet. It is owned and operated by the network's parent company, Bridge Media Networks. KSAO-LD's transmitter is located on Crescent Ridge in El Dorado Hills, California.

History

In August 2012, KSAO-LD became a charter affiliate of the Spanish-language network MundoFox. In July 2015, the network was relaunched as MundoMax after 21st Century Fox sold its stake of the network to RCN Televisión. 

MundoMax ceased operations on November 30, 2016. KSAO-LD affiliated with Azteca América the next day, taking over the affiliation from KSTV-LP (channel 32).

On December 31, 2022, Azteca América ceased operations and the station affiliated with NewsNet the next day on January 1, 2023, while at the same time, KSAO was dropped from local cable providers, such as Comcast's Xfinity. When KSAO was affiliated with Azteca América, its main channel was not carried by DirecTV and instead carried Azteca América owned-and-operated KEMO-TV (subchannel 50.2) in the San Francisco Bay Area due to KEMO’s high-definition signal.

Sale to Bridge Media Networks
On March 30, 2023, Bridge Media Networks, the parent company of NewsNet and Sports News Highlights (SNH), announced it would acquire KSAO-LD from Cocola Broadcasting and the company's six other stations for $3.2 million. The  transaction was completed on May 15, 2023. As a result, KSAO-LD became a NewsNet owned-and-operated station for the Sacramento–Stockton–Modesto DMA.

Subchannels
The station's digital signal is multiplexed:

Former subchannel affiliations
KSAO-LD was affiliated with Bounce TV on digital subchannel 49.2 until March 2013, when Bounce was switched over to KUVS-DT digital subchannel 19.3 as part of a distribution agreement with Univision Communications (now TelevisaUnivision), owner of KUVS.

KSAO was affiliated with TheCoolTV on digital subchannel 49.2 until April 2016 when it was dropped and replaced by Retro TV. As part of an affiliation deal with Retro TV's parent company Luken Communications (now Get After It Media), it also included the addition of Rev'n on digital subchannel 49.5. Both channels were dropped in 2018.

A simulcast of former Azteca América affiliate KSTV-LP (channel 32) aired on digital subchannel 49.3 until the simulcast was dropped in early 2016. The channel remained silent for a short time until May 11, 2016, when it was affiliated with Buzzr, a broadcast television network airing classic game shows.

On October 28, 2019, KSAO-LD became the third station in the Sacramento television market to affiliate with This TV on digital subchannel 49.2, after having previous subchannel affiliations with KQCA (subchannel 58.2) and KTXL (subchannel 40.3).

Shortly after KSAO-LD took on the NewsNet affiliation, NewsNet's sister network, Sports News Highlights, was added on digital subchannel 49.6 (previously occupied by SonLife Broadcasting Network). It was moved to digital subchannel 49.2 in September 2023 when the station dropped This TV. Buzzr on 49.3 and Shop LC on 49.5 were also dropped, removing the last remaining subchannels from the station's tenure under Cocola Broadcasting ownership. This TV and Buzzr currently have no replacement affiliates in the Sacramento television market.
