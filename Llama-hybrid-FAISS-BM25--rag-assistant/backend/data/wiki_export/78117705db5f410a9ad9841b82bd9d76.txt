Early life
Ebubennem Megalyn Ann Echikunwoke was born in Spokane, Washington to Mark Onigwe Versato Echikunwoke, an Igbo Nigerian father, and Anita Laurie.

When Echikunwoke was four years old, her father, then attending law school in Spokane, died of liver cancer, stemming from his war-related medical problems. Her mother moved the family to the Navajo Nation, where she raised Echikunwoke and her siblings in the unincorporated community of Chinle, Arizona. At age 14, Echikunwoke was discovered while performing in a theater production at an arts academy summer camp.
