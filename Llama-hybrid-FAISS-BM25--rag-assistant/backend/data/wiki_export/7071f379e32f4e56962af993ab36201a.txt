Early life
Sherrard was born in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan to Bob and Pauline Russell and raised in various parts of Canada.  She has two brothers, Danny and Andrew.  When living in Lahr, West Germany, in the sixth-grade, her homeroom teacher, Alf Lower, inspired her to become a writer.

Sherrard's novel in free verse, Counting Back from Nine, was nominated for a 2013 Governor General's Award in the Children's Text category.

Sherrard's picture books include There's a Cow Under my Bed that was illustrated by Canadian Illustrator David Jardine and Miss Wondergem's Dreadfully Dreadful Pie that was illustrated by Canadian Illustrator Wendy J. Whittingham.

Sherrard's 2007 historical novel, Three Million Acres of Flame, is about the 1825 Miramichi Fire, the largest recorded land fire in North American history.

Personal life
Sherrard currently lives in Miramichi, New Brunswick, with her husband, Brent, who is also an author. Sherrard previously was the executive director of a group home for adolescents.
