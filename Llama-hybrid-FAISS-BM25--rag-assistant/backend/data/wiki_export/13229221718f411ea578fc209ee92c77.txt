Indirana is a genus of frogs in the family Ranixalidae. These frogs are endemic to the Western Ghats of India. They are sometimes known under the common name Indian frogs, whereas members of their parent family are named "leaping frogs".

Indirana represent an ancient radiation of frogs that diverged from all other frogs almost 50 million years ago. This has credited Indirana gundia as a status of one of the "Top 100 Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered Amphibians".

Description
Indirana species are small and slender-bodied frogs. They are typically found in leaf litter or near streams. The tadpoles have hind limbs and finless tails, and are able to leap away to escape threats.

Taxonomy
Traditional classifications place the genus within the subfamily Ranixalinae of the family Ranidae, along with the genera Nannophrys and Nyctibatrachus. The Ranixalinae have also been placed under the family Nyctibatrachidae. Darrel R. Frost et al. (2006) placed them within the family Petropedetidae.
