History
Sunnyside School District was established in 1921. Around 1927, Sunny Side School (now Sunnyside), a two-story brick building was constructed on the southwest corner of Valencia Road and Nogales Highway. The school held first through eighth grades in it and consisted of four classrooms and an auditorium. The school served the children of neighboring areas such as Emery Park, which was a poultry colony, just to the north of the educational facility.

In 1951, the Sunnyside School District chose to desegregate its elementary schools to allow African American children to attend.
