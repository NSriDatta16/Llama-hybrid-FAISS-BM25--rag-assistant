Coomkeen () is a townland located near Durrus in West Cork, Province of Munster, Ireland. It is a small valley home to approximately 14 families, it is also the home of the world-famous Durrus Cheese.

History
Home to Reverend Timothy Crowley, Parish Priest, Coomkeen Upper, 1776.

Prior to purchase under the Land Acts of the early 1900s, the lands were owned by Lord Bandon and rented by tenant farmers.
In the late 1920s a new road to Bantry was built from Coomkeen and was celebrated by local poet Charles Dennis:
Oh! Durrus, you were often fleeced,
In the good old days gone by
And only for Mr. MacManaway
You should lie down and die
He's out to help industry
Give every man fair play,
His enterprising capitalist
Will surely win the day
His latest stunt is to build a road
Through the fair valley of Coomkeen
It starts at Crocawadra
An ends in Gearameen
We'll make of him a Bishop
And that without a doubt,
And he'll remove the Border,
Between North and South.

Present population
By 2006 most of the original families who lived in the 19th and early 20th centuries were no longer resident. Around 10 of the current dwellings are pre-famine, according to the early OS maps. This townland has had most of its field names preserved by the Cork and Kerry Place Names Survey in 2008.

There is a burial ground; mass rock site and on the Crottees boundary, a stone circle overlooking Durrus village. There was reputedly some mining exploration carried out on the south side of Knockboolteeangh in the 1840s and ore was extracted but not dressed.
