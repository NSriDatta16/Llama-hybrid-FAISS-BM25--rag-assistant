Oistins Bay is located southeast of Carlisle Bay, close to the southernmost point of Barbados, South Point.
It's the largest town in the Christ Church Parish, and has been (and still is) the center of a vibrant fishing community for hundreds of years. In the market place there, you can still buy a variety of cleaned or cooked Seafood year round. There's a regular fish fry going on Fridays and Saturdays, along with a great many pop-up shops with artists and crafts offered.
Its also a place to get a 'Bajean' (Barbadian) treat, the islands take-a-way or fast food: Flying Fish sandwich. That's something available during the weekly fish fry for the young folks, but available Island wide. 
But if your preference is more upscale, there are several restaurants throughout the Oistins Bay, and St Lawrence Gap area's. This  area is the place for night life, much of the festive and vibrant clubs and dance halls range from Oistins Bay to Sandy Bay, just north of Bridgetown.
