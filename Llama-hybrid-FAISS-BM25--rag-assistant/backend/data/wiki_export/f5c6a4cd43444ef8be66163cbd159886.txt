Alberdi is a primarily residential barrio (traditional neighborhood) of Rosario, Argentina. It is located in the north-east of the city, between Rondeau Boulevard and the Paran√° River. In the current administrative division system employed by the municipality, it belongs in the North District.

This barrio was initially an independent town (Pueblo Alberdi) and was then annexed to Rosario. It is an upper-middle-class neighborhood and has a number of mansions built at the beginning of the 20th century, including Villa Hortensia (refurbished to serve as a Municipal District Center).
