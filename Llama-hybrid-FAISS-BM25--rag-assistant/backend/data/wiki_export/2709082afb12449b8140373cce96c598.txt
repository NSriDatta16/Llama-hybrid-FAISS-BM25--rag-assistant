Kim Adler (née Couture) is an American Ten-pin bowling professional who was a member of the Professional Women's Bowling Association (PWBA). The right-hander is considered one of the top female bowling players of all time, competing professionally from 1991–2003 and collecting 15 national PWBA titles (tied for 17th most all-time), including major tournament wins at the 1996 Hammer LPBT Players Championship, 1997 Sam's Town Invitational and the 1999 U.S. Women's Open. In addition to her PWBA accomplishments, Adler placed first in Classic All-Events at the 2004 USBC Women's Open Championships.

Personal
Adler was born September 1967 in Springfield, Massachusetts, and grew up in neighboring town, East Longmeadow. She moved to Florida in 1992. She retired from the PWBA in 2003, after the organization folded. She returned to college in 2004, first becoming an Emergency Medical Technician-Paramedic, then a Registered Nurse, then finally a certified Nurse Practitioner. She obtained her Master's degree in Nursing as a hospitalist nurse practitioner from the University of South Florida in 2011. She now lives in Viera, Florida with her family where she works full time.

Bowling career
Adler made her PWBA debut in 1991 at age 23. She started slowly, making only two cash cuts that season, and another two cuts in 1992. In 1993, her career took off. She made fifteen Top 10 finishes that season, won her first PWBA title at the Alexandria Open in Alexandria, Louisiana, and finished runner-up for PWBA Player of the Year. She won a second title in 1994 at the AMF Ninja Challenge in Corpus Christi, Texas.

1995 was Adler's first PWBA season with multiple titles, as she won the Storm Doubles-Sam's Town with partner Nancy Fehr, then won a singles title at the Hammer Eastern Open. She won two titles in each of the next five seasons (1996 through 2000), including major championships at the Hammer Players Championship (1996), Sam's Town Invitational (1997) and U.S. Women's Open (1999).

After a down year in 2001, she rebounded with her 15th and final title in 2002. Adler made 56 career championship round appearances and advanced to the final match of a PWBA tournament 26 times, going 15–11 in those matches.
