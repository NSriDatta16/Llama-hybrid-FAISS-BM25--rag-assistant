History
Cuyamaca College is located in the San Diego County community of Rancho San Diego on 165 acres that at one time was a part of the Old Monte Vista Ranch. Along with its sister campus, Grossmont College, it is part of the Grossmont-Cuyamaca Community College District.

The college's name comes from the Kumeyaay phrase "Ekwiiyemak," which has been translated to mean "behind the clouds," "above the rains," and "the place where the rain comes from the heavens." The name for the college was selected by the Board of Trustees, as a reflection of the Native American history and heritage of this area of San Diego County. One historian notes that "The very old Indian name 'Cuyamaca' has persisted through Spanish, Mexican and American times", and has, at various times, been "applied to mountains, lakes, valleys and ranches." Writers have interpreted the Indian meaning of the name in various ways, including "above rain" and "place where the rain comes from heavens".

The campus site was acquired by the district's board of trustees in September 1972 and the college officially opened six years later. Today, Cuyamaca College offers more than 140 degrees and certificates, serves nearly 10,000 students, and is a significant contributor to the regional workforce and economy.
