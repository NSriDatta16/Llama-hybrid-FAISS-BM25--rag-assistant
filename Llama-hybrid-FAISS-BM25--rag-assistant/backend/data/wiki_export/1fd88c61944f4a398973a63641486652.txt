History
In 1950, following the enactment of the Radio Law, Mainichi Shimbun wanted to establish three radio stations (Tokyo, Osaka and Fukuoka). The Fukuoka station was named Radio Kyushu. A license for JOFR was issued on April 21, 1951 and the company was formally established on June 29. On December 1, Radio Kyushu begins its operations.

RKB started television broadcasts on March 1, 1958. At the same time, the station had to merge with Mainichi Seibu Television (tentative calls JOGX-TV, later reassigned in 2013 after CBC TV spun-off). Consequently the planned JOGX was opened as the Kitakyushu satellite station (JOFO-TV).
