St Ives High School is a coeducational government high school located in St Ives, New South Wales on the Upper North Shore of Sydney, Australia. Approximately 1300 students are enrolled at the school each year.  The school has spacious grounds with 1 sports field and 1 Multi-purpose Sports Centre. Apart from the immediate local area of St Ives, the school's intake area extends through Hornsby to north of Mount Colah. In 2024 these drawing boundaries will change to become smaller and more local by adding the area of Pymble, New South Wales and taking away the Northern Draw area.

History 
The building development of the school began in 1963. Prior to the development, the school had an enrolment of 150 students. Due to the incomplete construction, these students were transferred to Asquith Boys High School, Hornsby Girls' High School and Asquith Girls High School. They were segregated from the other students at their respective foster schools as they had their own uniform and classes. When the construction finally finished in 1964, students were able to start classes at their own school. However, the infrastructure of the school was still unfinished. The students and staff had neither electricity nor gas and the windows were unglazed.
