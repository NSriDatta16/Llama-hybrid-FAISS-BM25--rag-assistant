Fallston High School is a public high school Fallston, Maryland, United States. It serves a thousand students of Harford County.

History
With increasing population growth in this area of once-rural Harford County during the 1970s, the Board of Education determined the need for a secondary school to serve the youth of Fallston. Fallston High School was designed by architect Richard Ayres and built by Cam Construction Company at a cost of $10 million. The ground on which the school is built was formerly a dairy farm.  The land was acquired from local Real Estate developer Mr. Joseph Deigert, with an adjacent four acres set aside as a new home for the Fallston Volunteer Fire Company.  Fallston High School opened in November 1977 with a staff of 73 and a student population of 1400 in grades 6 through 10, with grades 11 and 12 added in subsequent years. The majority of the original Fallston students transferred from Bel Air schools.  Initially the school was a combined Middle/High School but was converted solely to a High School (9-12) with the opening of Fallston Middle School (6th-8th grades) on an adjacent piece of property in 1993. Fallston High School was visited by President Reagan during his time as president on December 4, 1985. The school has a conference room named the Reagan Room to commemorate his visit.

Extracurricular activities

There are many after school programs available to students, including competitive and non-competitive activities. To keep students' focus on academic achievement, the school has an Eligibility Committee to review student academic progress. If a student enrolled in an extracurricular activity is failing in one or more subject, he or she will be declared ineligible to participate in extracurricular activities.
