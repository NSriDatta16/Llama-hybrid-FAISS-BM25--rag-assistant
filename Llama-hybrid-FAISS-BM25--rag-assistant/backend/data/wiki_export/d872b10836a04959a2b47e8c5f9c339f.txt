The Phynx is a 1970 American comedy film directed by Lee H. Katzin about a rock and roll band named The Phynx and their mission in foreign affairs. The group is sent to Albania to locate celebrity hostages taken prisoner by Communists. The last part of the film, supposedly set in Albania, was filmed in the Spanish city of Ávila, recognizable by its medieval walls.

This turned out to be the final film appearance for several of the veteran performers in the cast, including Leo Gorcey, George Tobias and Marilyn Maxwell.

History
The Phynx received an extremely limited release, and has since become something of an obscure, rarely seen cult film; bootleg copies for many years turned up on auction websites before Warner Archive officially released the film on DVD in October 2012.

Plot
Four young men, the members of the Phynx rock group, are assigned to recover a number of famous American citizens that have been lured to Albania and then trapped behind a tall wall, threatened by the country’s solitary tank, and cannot leave. The Phynx must find the secret map to infiltrate the castle. It is printed in parts on three different women’s stomachs in three different European countries. To discover the girls marked with the maps, the Phynx must have sex with hundreds of girls. Their labors are lessened when in Rome they are given X-ray glasses, which visually strip the girls down to their underwear.
Finally, the four get into the castle and hatch a plot to hide the celebrities in wagons of radishes, topple the enclosing wall with hundreds of electric guitars, and escape.
