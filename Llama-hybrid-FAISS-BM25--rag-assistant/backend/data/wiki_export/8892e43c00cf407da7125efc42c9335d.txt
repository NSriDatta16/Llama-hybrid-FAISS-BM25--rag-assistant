History 
The Central Railroad of New Jersey, a conglomerate of the Somerville and Easton Railroad and the Elizabeth and Somerville Railroad, constructed tracks through Clinton Township in 1852. The railroad constructed the railroad through here as a temporary terminus. As a result, they built a new turntable in town so they could turn trains around back to Jersey City. The tracks through Clinton were completed on June 20, 1852. When the railroad was completed, the agent at White House station, George Frech, picked up and moved to Clinton Station. Along with merchant Jacob Young, N.N. Boeman, a local tavern keeper, and railroad employees James Kenna and Thomas Kinney, Frech helped move and settle the area around Clinton Station. The station depot was completed in 1852 while passenger service began on July 4, 1852 to Easton. Frech, serving as station agent, moved into the depot. The station built at Annandale was of a wooden design, two stories with a long overhang roof. The structure also had 2 chimneys for warming the structure.

When the railroad was completed, the village around Clinton Station began to expand. Boeman added a local tavern to the area on the first village lot, controlling it until 1879. Jacob Young constructed a local trading store around Clinton Station and soon added a grain house to the area. Kinney and Kenna became residents and began working for the railroad through town. In 1873, John T. Johnston, the president of the Central Railroad of New Jersey, requested the name of Clinton Station be changed to Annandale when prodded about the name. He chose the name based on his home town of Annandale in Scotland.

Annandale during this time had an abundance of limestone and lime mines through the area that benefitted from the construction of the railroad. During the 1800s, the lime and limestones were mined through the railroad, along with nearby lumber yards that prospered due to their locations near the rail line.
