Ilmala railway station (, ) is a railway station on the VR commuter rail network located in northern Helsinki, Finland. It is approximately  north of Helsinki Central railway station. The VR Group maintains a depot north of the station.

The station was opened in 1967 to serve the newly built television studios of the Finnish public broadcaster Yle and commercial broadcaster MTV3.

Ilmala depot
North of the Ilmala station, in Pohjois-Pasila between the two branches of the railway which go respectively to Huopalahti and Tikkurila, a large space is used for the VR train and bus depot (Ilmalan varikko) and for Posti sorting centre (Postinkeskus or Posti lajittelukeskus) and related offices.

Near the tracks, VR has built a 100,000 m³ depot to accumulate excess snow which cannot be eliminated by the snow-melting field in Pasila. The depot can also melt snow with heat from the return water of the buildings' heating which uses district heating provided by Helen.
