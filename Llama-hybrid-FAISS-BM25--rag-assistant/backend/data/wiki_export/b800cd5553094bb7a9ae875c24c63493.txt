Club Basket Bilbao Berri S.A.D., commonly known as Bilbao Basket (), also known as Surne Bilbao Basket for sponsorship reasons, is a professional basketball club based in Bilbao, Spain. The team plays in the Liga ACB. Their home arena is the Bilbao Arena, Spain.

History 
The club was founded in 2000 after replacing the former city clubs: Cajabilbao and SD Patronato. After four seasons between LEB and LEB 2, Bilbao promoted to Liga ACB in 2004 by winning by 3–1 to Baloncesto León in the LEB semifinals.

Bilbao spent ten seasons in the top tier of the Spanish basketball becoming finalist of the league in the 2010–11 season, where it lost in the finals to FC Barcelona by 3–0. In 2012, Bilbao played the EuroLeague and it was eliminated in the quarterfinals by CSKA Moscow, who won the series by 3–1.

The best era of the club finished in 2013, when it lost the 2013 Eurocup Final at Charleroi against Lokomotiv Kuban.

On 17 July 2014, the ACB excluded Bilbao Basket from the Liga ACB due to its financial trouble, but on 8 August, the Association was forced to retire the exclusion and finally Bilbao Basket remained in the Spanish top league.

The club played four more seasons in Liga ACB until their relegation on 13 May 2018, after losing against Baskonia the Basque derby by 74–78.
