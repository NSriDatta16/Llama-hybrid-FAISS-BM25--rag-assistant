"Say Somethin" is the debut single by American singer Austin Mahone, released from his first EP, Extended Play. It was released June 5, 2012 and was his first big charting success. It combines modern teen pop of the 2010s with vintage pop of the 1950s and 1960s.

Background and composition
"Say Somethin'" was written by Austin Mahone, Brandon Green, Mike Posner and Bruce Robinson. Speaking about the song's meaning, Mahone stated, "It's about a girl that I like who is shy. I'm asking her to just come out of her shell and 'Say Somethin' to me, to let me know she's interested." The song was released after he signed with Chase and Republic Records.

Critical reception
Taylor Weatherby of Billboard stated, "Between a bopping beat and super innocent lyrics — not to mention his adorable pre-puberty vocals — this is one heck of a hook-'em track for a debut."

Chart performance
In 2012, Mahone released the promotional single "11:11" that reached number 19 on the US Billboard Heatseekers Songs chart. The follow-up "Say Somethin'" did even better charting at number 34 on the US Billboard Pop Songs chart.

Music video
The music video for "Say Somethin'" premiered via VEVO on September 11, 2012. The video was filmed in a school setting and was heavily played on teen-oriented music channels, giving him great media exposure. The video was directed by Evan Dennis.
