History
The University of Sistan and Baluchestan was founded in 1974 originally named University of Sistan and Baluchestan in Zahedan with initial opening of the Faculty of Engineering and enrolments in Road and Construction Engineering. It did not take long for the university to become a higher education hub in the region. The next expansions were the Faculty of Nautical Science in Chabahar in 1978, the faculty of Agriculture in Zahedan in 1978 (later moved to Zabol), and the Faculty of Basic Science in Zahedan in 1989.

In 1991, Zahedan Teacher Training University was merged with the University of Sistan and Baluchestan, followed by the establishment of several other faculties, including Economics and Management, Fine Arts, Iranshahr Teacher Training, Earth Science and Geography, Educational Science and Psychology, and Computer and Information Technology.

One of the success stories of the University of Sistan and Baluchestan, due to its high achievements and potentials, is the birth of two independent universities from it â€” Zabol University in 1998 and University of Chabahar in 2002.
