Background

In 1940, Iran's then Prime Minister Mohammad-Ali Foroughi visited Shiraz and proposed a project for Shiraz to make a bid for holding the 1976 AFC Asian Cup with Shiraz as second host city. The operation of the venue was officially begun on 1 March 1945 and after near ten months, the stadium was opened in January 1946. The opening match was between Bargh Shiraz and CD Castellón in a friendly match, held on 20 January 1946 which Bargh won 1-0. 

Hafezieh stadium has been renovated twice, firstly in 1972 to make venue ready for the Asian Cup, which later was cancelled when Tabriz's Bagh Shomal Stadium was made second host because of its greater capacity. The second renovation began in 2009 and the capacity of the venue was upgraded from 20,000 to 22,000 seated.
