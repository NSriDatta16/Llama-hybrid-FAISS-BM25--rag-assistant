History
The earliest history of Jodhpur Park, recorded in current land deeds start when William Graham in his own name and in the name of his clerk named Ramasasi Choudhury purchased various plots of land in Mouza Dhakuria, Gobindapur, and Salimpur, Police Station Tollygunge, District 24 Parganas and became owner of the lands that we currently call Jodhpur Park.

Demise of the Grahams 
On 17 January 1931, William Graham died, leaving his will dated 3 May 1909.  After probate on 31 March 1931, Mrs. Kate Emily Graham became absolute owner of these lands after probate was granted in the Testamentary and Intestate Jurisdiction of the High Court of Judicature at Fort William in Bengal.  Kate Emily Graham died on 2 October 1931 and left her will dated 2 April 1931 where she directed the Official Trustee of Bengal to administer her estate and she also appointed the Official Trustee of Bengal as the executor of Kate's will.  On 15 December 1931, the probate of Kate's Will was granted to the Official Trustee of Bengal and the Official Trustee of Bengal seized and possessed the lands that currently constitute Jodhpur Park.

Jodhpur Park Club 
On 29 November 1935, by an indenture of Lease, (Calcutta Registration Office, Book No. 1, Volume No. 103, Pages 280-296, No. 4467 for the year 1935), the Official Trustee of Bengal granted and demised the lands to Jodhpur Club Limited for a term of 19 years commencing from 1 January 1931.

Bengal Secretariat Co-operative Land Mortgage Bank and Housing Society Limited 
On 21 February 1944, the Official Trustee of Bengal sold a portion to Kishenlal Poddar and Anandilal Poddar and Jodhpur Club Limited confirmed such sale.  By a Memorandum of Agreement dated 12 November 1945, the Official Trustee of Bengal agreed to sale to Messieurs Bengal Secretariat Co-operative Society Limited an area measuring approximately 80.93 acres -- this area is what is currently known as Jodhpur Park.  The address of these lands was No. 1, Gariahat Road and this was sold for a Rs. 10,10,000 and Bengal Secretariat Co-operative Society Limited paid this amount entirely to the Official trustee of Bengal.

During the Independence movement, the officers of the Government of Bengal, wanted that land to make their own housing colony and so they formed a registered co-operative housing society named "Bengal Secretariat Co-operative Land Mortgage Bank & Housing Society Limited" hereinafter named as the "Society". The Society was registered on 9 October 1945 and its registration number is 4/Cal/1945 and it is still existing. On 18 July 1947, the Society bought the said golf club land from the Official Trustee of Bengal at a price of about Rs. 10,10,000/- only to make their housing colony named Tollygunge Scheme (Jodhpur Club Lands). 

On 23 May 1948, the Society held a Special General Meeting and prepared detail plan of the Housing Scheme. The object of the scheme was to provide homes for the members by establishing a model garden colony with all amenities of city life for the attainment of better living conditions and promotion of economic interest of the residents thereof through co-operative efforts. As per the scheme, the Society sub-divided the big plot into about 450 residential plots, about 5 cottas each, for allotment to its members for constructing their own houses either by themselves or by the Society and also provided the members with housing loans upon mortgage of their residential plots to the Society. The Society decided to make the colony self-sufficient by providing the amenities of one secondary school for boys and one secondary school for girls, one market, a hospital with maternity block, post & telegraph office, two parks, a lake, a community and civic centre for cultural developments of the colony, administrative building, community kitchens, banks and others. The Society constructed roads for inter-connecting the plots and amenities and is supposed to maintain it through co-operative principles. The society is called The Bengal Secretariat Co-operative Land Mortgage Bank and Housing Society Limited.
