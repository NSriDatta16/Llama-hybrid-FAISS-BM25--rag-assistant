An industrialist of the town, Seth Shri Kudilaji Seksaria, responded by donating an initial amount for starting the institute in the name of his late father Seth Shri Govindram Seksaria, who is famously known as the Cotton King of India.

In 1956 it was converted to a degree college with a course in Civil Engineering and its name was changed to Govindram Seksaria Technological Institute (GSTI).
