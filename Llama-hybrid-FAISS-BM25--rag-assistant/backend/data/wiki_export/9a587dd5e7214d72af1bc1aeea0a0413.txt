Live at the Fillmore East is a posthumous live album by Jimi Hendrix released on February 23, 1999. The album documents Hendrix's performances with the Band of Gypsys at the Fillmore East on December 31, 1969, and January 1, 1970. It is drawn from the same performances as, and can be seen as an extended complement to, the album Band of Gypsys, consisting mostly of songs not on the original album.

Since its original release, additional recordings from the Fillmore East performances have been issued on West Coast Seattle Boy: The Jimi Hendrix Anthology (2010), Machine Gun: The Fillmore East First Show (2013), and Songs for Groovy Children: The Fillmore East Concerts (2019).
