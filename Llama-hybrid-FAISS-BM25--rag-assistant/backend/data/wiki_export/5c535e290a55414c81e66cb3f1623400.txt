The Star of Christmas is a 2002 American computer-animated film and is the eighteenth episode of the VeggieTales animated series and the second holiday special. It was released on October 26, 2002 and re-released on October 5, 2004, in Holiday Double Feature with its earlier episode The Toy that Saved Christmas. Like the other holiday episodes, it has no usual ”A Lesson in...” subtitle and the countertops. The film's message is that the true Star of Christmas is Jesus Christ. The movie emphasizes that the tale of Jesus Christ's birth is the epitome of real love and should, therefore, serve as society's model for how to love others.

The Star of Christmas centers on two would-be operatic composers who are based on W. S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan. VeggieTales has spoofed Gilbert and Sullivan's work in Lyle the Kindly Viking and (specifically The Mikado) in Sumo of the Opera. In this episode however they spoof the people, Gilbert, Sullivan and themselves.

The film was nominated for an Annie Award in 2002 in the category of Outstanding Achievement in an Animated Home Video Production, but lost to Rolie Polie Olie: The Great Defender of Fun.

Plot 

The cast of VeggieTales plan a play entitled "The Princess and the Plumber". Faced with the prospect of losing their audience to the pageant, Cavis vows to make their own production greater and flashier. But they cannot compete with the Star of Christmas, and in desperation Cavis and Millward go to the church to steal the Star.With the Star and flashy lights, Cavis is certain "The Princess and the Plumber" is now a guaranteed success, but during dress rehearsal, the excessive amount of lights ignite the curtains. Edmund and his father,Reverend, arrive at the jail to release Cavis and Millward. Cavis is moved, and he expresses his desire to attend the pageant, but the pageant starts in ten minutes and there is not enough time to get there.Just then, Seymour shows up in the rocket car, trusting Millward to drive the vehicle and get them all to the church on time. It is a harrowing ride fraught with collisions and near-misses, but they do arrive just as the pageant is about to start. The pageant goes on with the Prince and Miss Pickering in attendance.

Production 

The studio was on a tight schedule in early Christmas 2001 to get the film done. Most people slept in their offices trying to get The Star of Christmas finished. Towards the end/before it wrapped, Mike Nawrocki was said he would be on his Sunday drive around the time of New Year's Eve. They were at a café, the same café they used for the premiere of "Larryboy and the Rumor Weed". There was Lisa Vischer singing "O Come, O Come Emmanuel" during the "Star of Christmas" premiere.
