Professor of Divinity is an academic position at the University of Glasgow.

Although divinity was taught from the foundations of the University in 1451, it was in 1577, as part of James VI's Nova Erectio, that a Chair was established, to be held by the Principal of the University of Glasgow. The last Principal to hold the Chair of Divinity was Herbert Story, from 1898 to 1907.

In 1640, a second Chair of Divinity was established, with the holder considered the Professor of Divinity.

Note, there is also a Professor of Divinity and Biblical Criticism.
