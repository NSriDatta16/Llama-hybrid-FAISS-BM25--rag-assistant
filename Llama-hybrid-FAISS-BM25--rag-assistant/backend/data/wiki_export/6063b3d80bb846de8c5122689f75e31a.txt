Career

Acting 
Bullmore was part of a cabaret group named Red Stockings, along with Helen Edmundson. While performing at the Contact Theatre in Manchester, a casting director for Coronation Street saw her performance. Bullmore played Steph Barnes in Coronation Street, and was a regular on the show from February 1990 to September 1991. She made brief returns in April 1992 and September 1995. She worked and lived in Manchester for 10 years, moving to London in 1995.

Bullmore appeared in the first series of the BBC comedy series Big Train broadcast in 1998.

Bullmore appeared opposite Steve Coogan as Sonja, the Ukrainian girlfriend of Alan Partridge in the series two of the BBC2 comedy series I'm Alan Partridge. She also appeared on BBC Radio 4's phone-in spoof Down the Line.

From 2011 to 2014, Bullmore co-starred in the crime drama Scott & Bailey. She also wrote seven episodes of the show.

In 2016, she starred in the second series of Happy Valley, playing jealous mistress Vicky Fleming.

Writing 
In 2005, Bullmore wrote her first play, Mammals, which was staged at Bush Theatre and went on to tour the UK regionally.

In 2013, Bullmore wrote a second play, Di and Viv and Rose, which was staged at Hampstead Theatre. Di and Viv and Rose is about the friendship of three women over the course of 30 years, from 1983 when they are in university to 2013. The play eventually transferred to the West End in early 2015, where it ran at the Vaudeville Theatre before closing in March.

Personal life 
In 1993, Bullmore married Scottish actor Paul Higgins. They met in Manchester in 1992 while they were performing A View from the Bridge. The couple have two daughters, Mary and Flora.
