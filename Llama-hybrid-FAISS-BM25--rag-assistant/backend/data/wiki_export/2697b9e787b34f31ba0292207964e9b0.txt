Ketubot () is a tractate of the Mishnah and the Talmud in the order of Nashim. It deals with a variety of marital responsibilities, especially those intended for the marital contract, also named the ketubah. Due to the wide breadth of subjects discussed in this tractate, Ketubot is often referred to as the Shas katan (the miniature Talmud).

A ketubah (plural: ketubot) (in Hebrew: כְּתוּבָּה; plural: כְּתוּבּוׂת) is a special type of Jewish prenuptial agreement. It is considered an integral part of a traditional Jewish marriage, and describes the groom's rights and responsibilities towards the bride. Currently, the ketubah does not have a monetary value, however, it has legal value in Israel.
