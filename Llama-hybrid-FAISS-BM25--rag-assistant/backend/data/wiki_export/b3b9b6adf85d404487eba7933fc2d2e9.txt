The Future Is Inter-Disciplinary or Not at All is an EP by Frog Eyes, released by Acuarela Discos in Spain in 2006.

The EP was not as well received as previous releases. Cokemachineglow claimed the EP "isn't good", and the level to which it can frustrate longtime Frog Eyes fans is "staggering". Pitchfork Media calls the album "disappointing".
