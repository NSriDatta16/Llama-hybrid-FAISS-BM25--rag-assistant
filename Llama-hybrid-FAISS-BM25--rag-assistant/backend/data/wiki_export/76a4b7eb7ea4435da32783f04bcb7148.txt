The Joint Policy Board for Mathematics (JPBM) consists of the American Mathematical Society, the American Statistical Association, the Mathematical Association of America, and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics. 

The Board has nearly 55,000 mathematicians and scientists who are members of the four organizations. 

Each April, the JPBM celebrates Mathematics and Statistics Awareness Month (previously, the month was called Mathematics Awareness Month) to increase public understanding of and appreciation for mathematics and statistics. The event was renamed by the JPBM in 2017. To simplify coordination efforts, the JPBM also decided in 2017 that there will no longer be an annual assigned theme for the month. This celebration of mathematics, and now mathematics and statistics, began as Mathematics Awareness Week in 1986.

JPBM Communications Award
Each January at the Joint Mathematics Meeting the JPBM gives its Communications Award to a journalist or other communicator for bringing accurate mathematical information to non-mathematical audiences.
