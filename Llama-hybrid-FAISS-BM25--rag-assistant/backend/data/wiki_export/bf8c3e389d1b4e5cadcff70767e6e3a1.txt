Album information
Iparhi Logos was released on 12 April 2006 as a follow-up to Paparizou's successful debut album Protereotita. The album comprises 29 songs on two discs: 14 new songs, three from the "Mambo!" CD-single, a remix of the title track, and 11 live songs from her MAD Secret Concert. The album also includes a number of covers and translations such as "Oti Axizi Einai I Stigmes" (Le bonheur) written by Manos Hadjidakis, which was a big hit in France in 1962. Six of the songs from the album were later re-recorded in English and appeared on Paparizou's international album The Game of Love released in November 2006. The album achieved mild success in Greece and Cyprus managing to top both countries' charts, while it charted in the Ifpi's Top50 Greek Albums for a whole 81 weeks. The album received platinum certifications in Greece and Cyprus. Iparhi Logos reached fourth place in the Greece Annual Top 50 Greek Albums 2006.

The album was repackaged and re-released in Greece and Cyprus in May 2007, as Iparhi Logos: Platinum Edition.

The album contains the two original CDs from the original Iparhi Logos, and the CD-single "Fos" as a bonus with seven new songs. One of the songs included a Greek cover of Celine Dion's "Pour que tu m'aimes encore", titled "An Esy M'agapas" in Greek, with lyrics by Giannis Doxas. The song "Fos" was also the title track of the Greek version of Barbie in the 12 Dancing Princesses, while "Mi Fevgeis" is a re-make of an old Greek folk song, rendered for the first time by Aloula Georgouti and covered in the 1990s by Paides en Taxi. The song "Le temps des fleurs" is by Dalida, and to date is Paparizou's first and only French-language song recorded. "Fos" had been released as a separate CD-single titled without the tracks "Pou Pige Tosi Agapi (Summer Moonlight Mix)" and "I Agapi Sou Den Meni Pia Edo".
