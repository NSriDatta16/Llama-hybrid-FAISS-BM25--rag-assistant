Timothy Daniel Herron (born February 6, 1970) is an American professional golfer. He currently plays on the PGA Tour Champions. He was previously a member of the PGA Tour, where he was a four-time winner.

Early life
Herron was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota. His father and grandfather, both named Carson Herron, were professional golfers who played in the U.S. Open.

Amateur career 
Herron was a 1992-1993 first team All-American at the University of New Mexico. He won the 1992 Minnesota State Amateur. Herron played on the 1993 United States Walker Cup team.

Professional career 
In 1993, Herron turned professional. He played on the Nationwide Tour in 1995, and the following season he won for the first time on the PGA Tour at the Honda Classic. He won three times in his first four seasons at the top level. Herron continued to play consistently after that, but there was a seven-year gap before he claimed his fourth PGA Tour title at the 2006 Bank of America Colonial. His best finish in a major championship is a solo 6th-place finish in the 1999 U.S. Open. In 2000, Herron was as high as 29th in the Official World Golf Rankings.

Personal life 
Herron resides in Wayzata, Minnesota with his three children: Carson, Mick, and Patrick.

Herron has a genetic condition called Dupuytren's contracture, which affected his father and sister.
