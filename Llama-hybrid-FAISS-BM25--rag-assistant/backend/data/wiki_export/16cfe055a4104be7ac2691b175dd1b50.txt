Park declared that "Foreign words are too excessive in our life, such as in advertisements, signboards, radio and TV broadcasting... and even in broadcasting sports," and assigned the Education Minister the role of coordinating the government's changeover to Korean substitute words.  Park's previous decrees had been against long hair for men or short skirts for women, as well as putting limits on the amount of money to be spent on weddings and funerals.

Former Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter, who had been the front-runner in the Democratic Party nomination for President of the United States, said in a campaign speech that the federal government should not interfere with the "ethnic purity" of American neighborhoods, raising questions of whether he was a bigot or white supremacist.

Carter apologized two days later for using the phrases "ethnic purity", "black intrusion" and "alien groups" in discussing established neighborhoods but said that his intent was to say that he "would not arbitrarily use federal force to move people of different ethnic background into a neighborhood just to change its character," though acknowledging that no plans for moving people had actually been proposed in Congress.

At the same time, Deng Xiaoping (Teng Hsiao-ping), once viewed as Mao's successor prior to the death of Premier Zhou Enlai, was removed by the CCP from his posts as Deputy Chairman of the Party, Deputy Prime Minister, and Chief of Staff of the Chinese Armed Forces.  The government announced that the decision to elevate Hua to power and to dismiss Deng had both been made "on the proposal of our great leader, Chairman Mao"; the reason given for Deng's demotion was that "Having discussed the counterrevolutionary incident which took place at Tien An Men Square and Teng Hsiao-ping's latest behaviors," the Party declared that "the nature of the Teng Hsiao-peng problem had turned into one of antagonistic contradiction."

Baseball pitcher Joe Niekro of the Houston Astros was credited with five strikeouts (rather than the normal limit of three for three outs that end an inning) in the first inning of an unusual game in New Orleans against the Minnesota Twins.  Because catcher Cliff Johnson dropped five of Niekro's pitches, the "passed ball" rule allowed five batters to advance to first base, including two who advanced after the third strike was called.

After more than 50 years, the "Russell baby case" in the United Kingdom was resolved with a unanimous decision by the nine members of the House of Lords Committee for Privileges and Conduct that Geoffrey Russell was the rightful holder of the hereditary peerage of Baron Ampthill, despite claims in 1921 by the late John Russell, 3rd Baron Ampthill and by his wife Christabel Hulme Hart (Geoffrey Russell's mother) that John Russell was not the father.
