Mytishchi Arena was opened on October 15, 2005. Along with the Khodynka Arena, it hosted the 2007 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships. The arena has been used as the home arena of the Russian Kontinental Hockey League club, Atlant Moscow Oblast. In 2017, the basketball club Khimki, started using the arena for their 2017–18 EuroLeague games.

Due to the on-going travel restrictions against COVID-19 pandemic, ice hockey team Kunlun Red Star determined that they would be unable to play in Beijing, China for the 2020-21 KHL season. In August, the club signed a contract to play out of Arena Mytishchi.
