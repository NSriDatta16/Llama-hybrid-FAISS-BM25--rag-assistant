History
The Brass Mill Center opened on Wednesday September 17th, 1997. It comprises two floors, as well as a now closed partial third floor belonging to a 12-screen Regal Cinemas.

Before construction began, 118,000 tons of contaminated soil and 63 vacant and deteriorated buildings were removed from the site.  The construction of Brass Mill Center essentially replaced the older Naugatuck Valley Mall, built in 1969 and located on the city's northeast suburban side.  In the process, the Filene's (originally a G. Fox & Co. store) and the Sears stores relocated to Brass Mill Center.  Naugautuck Valley Mall was demolished in spring 1999.
Lechmere was originally planned as the fourth anchor, but it never opened due to parent company Montgomery Ward closing the chain in 1997, the same year the mall opened.

Numerous former tenants include Shawâ€™s Supermarket, Steve & Barry's, Hometown Buffet and OfficeMax, which closed in 2007, 2009, 2011, and 2014 respectively.

IHOP opened at the mall in December 2010.

On January 12, 2011, Save-A-Lot would open in the former Shaw's.

During the summer of 2017, Five Below and Ulta Beauty opened in the space formerly occupied by OfficeMax.

The dawn of the 2020's saw several storied traditional department store retailers update their brick-and-mortar formats after being encroached upon to a degree by several digital retailers in recent years.

On June 7, 2018, it was announced Sears would shutter as part of an ongoing decision to eliminate its brick-and-mortar format.

On January 6, 2021, Macy's announced after a strategy had been implemented by them to solely focus on their highest achieving outposts that they had selected against staying on at the shopping center.

On April 19, 2022, Kohan Retail Investment Group acquired Brass Mill Center for $44.9 million.

On September 26, 2022, it was announced that Regal Cinemas would be ending its lease as a result of restructuring its established long-term debt due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Numerous theater chain operators are in the midst of early on discussions.
