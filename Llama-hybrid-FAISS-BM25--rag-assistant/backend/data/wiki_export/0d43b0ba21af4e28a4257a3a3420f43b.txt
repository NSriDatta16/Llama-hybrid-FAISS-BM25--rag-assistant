West Palm Beach Christian Convention Center (originally known as West Palm Beach Auditorium) is a 5,000-seat multi-purpose arena in West Palm Beach, Florida, at the intersection of North Congress Avenue and Palm Beach Lakes Boulevard. It was built in 1965 as the West Palm Beach Auditorium and was designed by famed architect Bertrand Goldberg. It was home to the West Palm Beach Blaze ice hockey team, Florida Bobcats arena football team and Florida Hammerheads roller hockey team. It hosted the twelfth WWF In Your House pay-per-view in 1996.  The Fort Lauderdale Strikers played their indoor soccer games here in the early 1980s. It was also host to innumerable concerts from different rock acts.

The facility was sold in the late 1990s to the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Inc., the main legal entity used by Jehovah's Witnesses. The building and grounds were renovated and the name was changed to West Palm Beach Christian Convention Center and is now used only for their assemblies and conventions.
