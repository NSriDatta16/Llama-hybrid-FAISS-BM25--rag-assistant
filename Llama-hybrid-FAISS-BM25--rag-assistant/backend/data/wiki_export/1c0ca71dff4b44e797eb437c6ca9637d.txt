Our Lips Are Sealed is a 2000 direct-to-video film starring Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. The film was partly set and filmed in Sydney, Australia.

Plot
The Parker Sisters are placed in the FBI's Witness Protection Program after they witness a robbery at the local museum, in which the priceless Kneel Diamond is stolen. Unfortunately, the sisters have a problem with being blabbermouths; as a result, everywhere the Parkers are sent to live, the girls inadvertently end up revealing their witness status. The gang is led by a crime lord with the rather unfortunate surname of Hatchew ("Bless you!"), who will do anything to get his hands on the diamond, which the thieves slipped into one of the girls' shoulder bag during their escape from the crime scene; the gem ultimately ends up being set into her necklace.

The family travels everywhere in the United States, from Texas to a prairie town, and eventually has been moved to every geographic location around the world possible, with the single exception of Australia â€“ thus the FBI (who by this time are getting absolutely fed up of having to constantly relocate the Parkers, and all because the sisters can't keep their mouths shut) send them to live in Sydney, where they are given the aliases Maddie and Abby. The girls have much trouble at first, especially fitting in with their peers. Two assassins named Mac and Sidney are sent after them after discovering their location by breaking into the FBI office.  Maddie and Abby defeat Mac and Sidney by knocking them out, tying them to surfboards, putting clips in Sidney's hair, painting Mac's toenails, and threatening to put pink and blue bikinis on them. After the twins manage to convince them to change sides; they leave after the girls lure Hatchew to Australia. He comes after them, manages to get the diamond, and sets his thug on them. It looks like they are about to die, until Mac and Sidney return and defeat the thug, saving the girls. Hatchew nearly gets away on a seaplane, but Maddie and Abby stop him using a boomerang, and he is arrested by Katie, an undercover FBI agent posing as a lifeguard. The Parkers are finally able to return home to the United States with half the reward money for capturing the thieves.
