History

The newspaper emerged from a mixture of publications circulating in Temple between 1881 and 1907. In 1907, E. K. Williams and J. F. Crouch crafted the Temple Times into the Temple Daily Telegram, the city's first daily newspaper.

On Oct. 29, 1929, Ward C. Mayborn and his three sons, Frank, Don and Ted, bought the Telegram. When Ward left in late 1930 to become the general manager of the Baltimore News-American, Frank W. Mayborn became publisher of the newspaper , a position he held until his death in 1987. Sue Mayborn, his third wife who had worked with him for many years, beginning as his secretary, has run the paper since that time.

Norman L. Richardson, an award-winning journalist originally from Louisiana who was known for his coverage of hurricanes, was the executive editor of the Daily Telegram from 1974 to 1979.
