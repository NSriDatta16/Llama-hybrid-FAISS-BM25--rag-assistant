The Pavilion (originally known as the Montage Mountain Performing Arts Center) is an outdoor amphitheater located in Scranton, Pennsylvania, within the Montage Mountain Ski Resort. A temporary fixture was originally built in 1992, known as the Montage Mountain Amphitheater. Due to the venue's popularity, a permanent venue opened in 2000.

History
In 1990, the Montage Mountain Ski Area began to host music festivals to bring in additional revenue during the resort's off season. A temporary stage with open lawn seating was opened on July 3, 1992, with a concert by Chubby Checker. Known as Montage Mountain Amphitheater, the popularity of the venue placed Scranton as a secondary market within the concert industry. In 1994, the resort teamed up with Metropolitan Entertainment further expand its concert season. The temporary staging remained, and bleacher-style seating was added in addition to the lawn . The capacity grew from 5,000 to 16,000 along with a name change, the Montage Mountain Performing Arts Center.

Beginning July 1994, the venue hosted an annual summer concert series. It was the success of the 1999 season that persuaded the owners to build a permanent facility. The $6 million project began construction in November 1999. The venue takes up 70 acres of the ski resort, with a wooded area separating the venue and parking spaces. Construction was completed in June 2000, just in time for the newly sponsored Coors Light Silver Bullet Concert Series. The new venue was opened on June 24, 2000 with a concert by Harry Connick Jr. The following day featured a concert by Britney Spears. The venue proved to be a financial success for the resort and the county. The first two seasons saw a revenue of $10 million.

In 2002, Clear Channel Communications took over operations and management from MEG. Along with the new management came the first sponsor for the venue, Ford Motor Company. When Clear Channel became Live Nation, Toyota Motor Corporation became a new sponsor.  In 2007, the roof collapsed on Valentine's Day during the Blizzard of 2007. With the roof needing to be rebuilt, the owners also replaced the seating and updated the lighting, sound and video equipment. This was all completed in time for the 2007 summer season. In 2013, Toyota's sponsorship contract was up for renewal. The car company chose not to renew the contract. The venue became The Pavilion at Montage Mountain beginning January 1, 2014.
