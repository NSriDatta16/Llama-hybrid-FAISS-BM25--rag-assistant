Golders Green is the second posthumous CD release of demo material recorded by Badfinger frontman Pete Ham. The recordings are taken from various eras, beginning with compositions he wrote during his years with The Iveys in 1968 and 1969, and running throughout his tenure with Badfinger, ending with his death in 1975.

Most or all of the original recordings were made on Ham's home Revox two-track tape machine, with some remainders apparently recorded in professional studios and transferred to his home machine. Most or all of the original recordings highlight Ham playing all of the instruments. In cases where the instrumentation was sparse, session musicians were utilised to enhance the recordings. Notably, Badfinger member Bob Jackson later added keyboards to some tracks, and Iveys member Ron Griffiths added some bass guitar.

Due to decades of neglect and improper storage, the original tapes were greatly deteriorated and had to be digitally transferred before the disc was made. An earlier collection of Ham demo material, 7 Park Avenue, was released two years prior to this release.

7 Park Avenue was the address of Badfinger's band residence in Golders Green.  Golders Green is a community within London, England probably most known for the Golders Green Crematorium which is the final resting place for many famous Britons including The Who drummer Keith Moon, famed psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, and comedic actor Peter Sellers, star of the 1960s Pink Panther (film) movies.
