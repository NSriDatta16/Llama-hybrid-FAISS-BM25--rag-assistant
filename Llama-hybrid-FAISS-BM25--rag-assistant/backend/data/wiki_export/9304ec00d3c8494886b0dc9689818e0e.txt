History
In the late 19th and early 20th century, Ayancık was part of the Kastamonu Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire. Being the most ideal hilltop in Sinop, Ayancık was the site of a US military radar station from 1951 to 1992 during the Cold War. The radar was finally shut down in 1999 due to its technological obsolescence.
