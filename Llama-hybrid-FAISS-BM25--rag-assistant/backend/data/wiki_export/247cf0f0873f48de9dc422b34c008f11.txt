It is the second largest fitness chain in the United States based on revenue after LA Fitness, and the fourth in number of clubs (behind LA Fitness, Anytime Fitness & Gold's Gym), operating 287 clubs across 11 U.S. states. The company was originally founded by Mark S. Mastrov and was sold to Forstmann Little & Co in 2005, and then to AEA investors and Ontario Teachers Pension Plan in 2014.

Despite the chain's name, many of the gyms are not open 24 hours a day.

Early history and founding

The company was originally named "24 Hour Nautilus", but merged with southern California based company "Family Fitness" in 1996, which resulted in both brands emerging as "24 Hour Fitness"
