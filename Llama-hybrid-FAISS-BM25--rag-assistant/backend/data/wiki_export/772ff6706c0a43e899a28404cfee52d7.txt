is a series of six bishōjo-centered manga booklets that were released weekly for a short time in Japan. The manga would come packaged with a limited edition plastic-figure assembly kit, designed by Ohshima Yuki, of the featured character of the week. These figures of small-breasted prepubescent girls helped to expand the niche market of lolicon and also placed Ohshima in high esteem among figure collectors in Japan due to the high level of detail and clever portrayals. Some of Ohshima's figurines are reproduced by Takashi Murakami (Murakami, 2005).

Featured artists included Ohshima, YUG, Barasui, Kunihiko Tanaka, Shinichi Yūki, Hanaharu Naruko, Yuuno, Izumi Kazuto, Humikane Shimada, Hiro Kanzaki, Tony, and Kashmir.
