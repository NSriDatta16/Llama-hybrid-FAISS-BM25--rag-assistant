Soraya () is a feminine Persian name. It is derived from the Arabic name for the Pleiades star cluster, Thurayya (). The name is also popular in Europe due to its association with Soraya Esfandiary-Bakhtiari, the second wife of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi of Iran, who became a European socialite.

For phonological reasons, it is usually transcribed as Suraya in Afghanistan and Surayo in Tajikistan.
