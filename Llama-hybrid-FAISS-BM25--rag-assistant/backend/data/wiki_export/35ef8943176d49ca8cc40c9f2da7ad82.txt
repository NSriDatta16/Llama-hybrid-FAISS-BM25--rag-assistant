Farewell to Paradise (1973) is the fourth album by Emitt Rhodes. An eclectic mixture of rock, pop, jazz-funk and soul. Due to the pressure of his record label suing him for his failure to complete his contract for 6 albums in 3 years, many of the songs exhibit more somber, gloomy tones than Rhodes' previous albums.

"Those That Die" is derived from "Tame The Lion", a furious anti-war song that was issued as a single in July 1972.  "Tame the Lion" has a fast tempo, and "Those That Die" uses part of the lyrics from the bridge of "Tame the Lion", but at a slow tempo and chords from a minor key.

The initial pressings of this album were mispressed and featured the audio from the unreleased album by Toronto band Dixie Rumproast - Well Done.  Many of them are still in circulation.
