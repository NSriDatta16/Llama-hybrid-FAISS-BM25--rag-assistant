Johnny Golden (April 2, 1896 – January 27, 1936) was an American professional golfer.

Early life
Golden was born in Tuxedo, New York.

Professional career 
Golden turned professional in 1915 and was an assistant pro and later head pro at the Tuxedo Club until 1929 when he took the head job at North Jersey Country Club in Wayne, New Jersey. During his time at the Tuxedo Club, he was a three-time semifinalist in the PGA Championship. In 1922, he lost to Emmet French. In 1926, he dropped a semifinal match to Leo Diegel, and the following year he lost in the semis to Joe Turnesa. Golden remained in Wayne for just a year, leaving for the head professional job at Wee Burn Country Club near Darien, Connecticut. While serving as the pro at Wee Burn, Golden won four consecutive Connecticut Open titles (1932–35), with the 1932, 1933 and 1935 events retroactively garnering PGA Tour-level status. His most lucrative win came in 1931, at the Agua Caliente Open in Mexico. Golden finished regulation tied with George Von Elm at 293. The duo agreed prior to the playoff to split first- and second-prize money, a common practice, with each player pocketing $6,750. Golden went on to win the playoff. Without the agreement, he would have won $10,000.

Golden played on the first two Ryder Cup teams in 1927 and 1929, compiling a perfect 3-0-0 record, with an 8 & 7 rout of Herbert Jolly in singles in 1927 at Worcester Country Club. His two other Ryder Cup match wins came with Walter Hagen as his teammate, winning foursomes in 1927 and in 1929, at Moortown Golf Club near Leeds, England.

Death
In January 1936, Golden died at age 39 in Stamford, Connecticut from pneumonia.

Honors and awards
Golden was elected to the Connecticut Golf Hall of Fame in 2000.
