Loco is a 1984 computer game developed by Antony Crowther and released by Alligata for the Commodore 64.  Loco is a clone of the 1982 Sega arcade game Super Locomotive. Ports for the ZX Spectrum and Atari 8-bit family were released in 1986. The ZX Spectrum port was developed by Richard Stevenson, David Wright and Nigel Speight.. The music for the game is a C64 remake of Jean-Michel Jarre's Equinoxe 5 and 6 by Ben Daglish.

Crowther's subsequent Suicide Express is related to Loco, though not an official sequel.
