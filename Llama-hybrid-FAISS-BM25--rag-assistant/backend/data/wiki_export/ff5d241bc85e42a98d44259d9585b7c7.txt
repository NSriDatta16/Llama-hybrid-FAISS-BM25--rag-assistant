History

Grammar school
Saltburn High School for Girls opened on Marske Road in Saltburn-by-the-Sea. Cleveland Grammar School, its successor, was on Warwick Road, which opened in September 1953 for 500 girls, run by the Teesside Education Committee, based in Middlesbrough. By the early 1960s there were 600 girls, and 900 by 1969. It was sometimes known as Cleveland Grammar School for Girls. The male equivalent was Sir William Turner's Grammar School.

Comprehensive
Cleveland Grammar School, a girls' school, and Redcar Lane Secondary Modern (always referred to as "Warwick Road"), two nearby schools, merged to form the institution when it first opened in 1975. The new first year pupils of 1975/6 were the first intake under the comprehensive system. The school lost its sixth form.

The first headmistress was Patricia Rutherford, the first deputy head was Geoff Curtis. The current headmistress is Caroline Waugh.

In March 1995, a 14-year-old boy died after having a heart defect and collapsing during a PE session.

The school was demolished and rebuilt on the same site in 2001. The £7.7 million new building was opened by Tony Blair in November 2001.

In April 2001, it was announced that along with 114 other schools, Rye Hills was accepted onto the government's trust school programme and they will work towards that status.

Academy
Previously a foundation school administered by Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council, in March 2017 Rye Hills School converted to academy status and was renamed Rye Hills Academy. The school being sponsored by the Nunthorpe Multi Academy Trust.

In June 2021, Rye Hills Academy moved from Nunthorpe Multi Academy Trust to North East Learning Trust.
