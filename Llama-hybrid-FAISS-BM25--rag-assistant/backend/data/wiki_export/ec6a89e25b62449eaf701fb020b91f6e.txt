Plot
Kunjunni's parents separate soon after his birth, and he's left to be cared by his mother, void of paternal care and affection. He is brought up by his mother with the help of his grandmother, an estate manager and his friend Meenakshi, the daughter of a maid servant working in Kunjunni's house. Inspired by his Uncle, who was initially a Gandhian, and eventually  a Marxist, Kunjunni finds himself drawn to left-wing ideologies during his studies at college, believing that communism is the answer to heal all social hardships and inequalities. Eventually he joins an extremist Marxist group, and his affairs land him in trouble. After an attack at a police station, Kunjunni is arrested and taken to court, but later acquitted of all charges.

Kunjunni finds himself maturing with experience, yet he feels lonely and disillusioned. Kunjunni tries to turn his life around, and sets off on a quest to find his childhood friend Meenakshi and he does so and marries her. Later he sells all his properties to a new rich man, whose father was once a servant in Kunjuni's house.
