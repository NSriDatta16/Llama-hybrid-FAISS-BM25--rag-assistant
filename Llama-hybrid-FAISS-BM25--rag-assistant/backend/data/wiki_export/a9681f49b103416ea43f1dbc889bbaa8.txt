The Pech River () is located in eastern Afghanistan.

Course
The Pech River system is fed from glaciers and snow from the Hindu Kush range to its north. The river rises in central Nuristan Province and flows south and southeasterly through the center of Kunar Province, joining the Kunar River (Asmar River, Loy Seend) at the provincial capital of Asadabad. The Kunar River is a tributary of the Kabul River, part of the Indus River basin.

The river has numerous tributaries forming valleys on both sides. These include the Chapa Dara, Waygal, Korangal Valley (site of the film Restrepo), Watapur, and Sharyak valleys.

Culture
In the Pech Valley, Pashto as well as Askunu language is spoken. The Safi tribe of Pashtuns are the majority population in the Pech Valley.

The river's largest settlement is Nangalam, at the confluence of the Waygal River with the Pech River.
