The bank is about 16 km in diameter as defined by the 200 m isobath, which corresponds to an area of more than 200 km2. There are no islets, cays or above-water rocks. The bank has a minimum depth of , with coral bottom, at its eastern edge. Depths over the greater part of the bank are less than . The bottom is fine white sand. Rip currents mark the edges of the bank.
