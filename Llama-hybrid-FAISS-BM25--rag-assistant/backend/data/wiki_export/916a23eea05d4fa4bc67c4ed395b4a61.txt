Professional career

Pope was originally drafted by the Miami Dolphins in the seventh-round (222nd overall) in the 2004 NFL Draft. He was selected with a pick obtained from the Baltimore Ravens in a draft trade-down. On July 30, 2004 Pope was signed to a four-year deal worth around $2.4 million. The deal included a signing bonus of about $43,000, along with incentives that could increase the contract's value.

Pope impressed the Dolphins' coaching staff early in his professional career and went on to appear in all 16 games, including three starts, in his rookie season. He posted 44 tackles, two sacks, a forced fumble and a fumble recovery which he returned for a touchdown. He also ranked fifth on the squad with nine special teams tackles. He saw action in each of the first 11 games of the season in a reserve role.

Although he did not start, Pope saw extended action at San Francisco on November 28 after Zach Thomas left the game in the first quarter with a hamstring injury. Pope responded with seventeen tackles, his first career sack and a fumble recovery. With 3:10 to play in the game, Pope picked up a Tim Rattay fumble that was forced by Jason Taylor and took it in one yard for a touchdown. The score gave the Dolphins a 24-10 lead in a game they went on to win, 24-17. He became the first defensive rookie to score a touchdown for the Dolphins since Zach Thomas returned an interception 26 yards for a score on November 17, 1996 against the Houston Oilers. Pope's first career start came the following week against the Buffalo Bills, and he kept that spot for three straight weeks before Thomas returned to the lineup. In the Bills game, Pope recorded eight tackles and his second sack in as many weeks. On December 12 against the Denver Broncos, he tallied a season-high 14 tackles and a forced fumble, with the tackle figure leading the team that day.

In the game, Pope stripped the ball from running back Cedric Houston with defensive end Matt Roth recovering at the Dolphins’ 39. That led to a Ricky Williams 23-yard touchdown run six plays later.
