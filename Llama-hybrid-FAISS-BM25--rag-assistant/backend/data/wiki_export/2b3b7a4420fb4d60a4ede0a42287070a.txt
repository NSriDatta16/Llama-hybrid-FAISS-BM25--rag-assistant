Glover School is a public elementary school on Maple Street in Marblehead, Massachusetts, US. It educates around 250 students in grades K-3. The school consists of two buildings situated on a hilly  site.

History

The school was designed by architect Walter S. Brodie. It consists of two buildings. The 'lower building' was built in 1916 and the 'upper building' in 1948.

In May 1999 the community debated the cost of repairs to Glover School.

In mid-2012 both buildings were demolished so that a new Glover School could be built in their place. School officials said the original buildings were antiquated and hard to maintain. The new building will have modern utilities and will add a kindergarten, increasing total enrollment to 425 students.
