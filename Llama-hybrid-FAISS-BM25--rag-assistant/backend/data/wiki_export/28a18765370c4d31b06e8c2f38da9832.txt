In the time from 1891 and 1901, some houses were either knocked down or the parish's boundary lines changed as there were only 96 houses in the village in 1901, dropping from 101 in 1891. This number again rose and fell, during wartime Britain, ranging from a low in 1931 with only 80 houses, and raising back up to 97 in 1961.
