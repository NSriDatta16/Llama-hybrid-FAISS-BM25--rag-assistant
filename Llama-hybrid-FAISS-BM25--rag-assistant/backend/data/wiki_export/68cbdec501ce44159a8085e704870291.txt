Lower Kingswood is a village located in Surrey, just within the M25 motorway. It is between Kingswood and Reigate, and is bisected by the A217 dual carriageway. Neighbouring settlements include Tadworth and Reigate also Redhill.

History 
The village was situated around the Brighton Road (now the A217) and the crossroads with Buckland Road/Smithy Lane, the centre being where the Fox On The Hill pub, now an Indian restaurant and takeaway, and the Church of the Wisdom of God are located. Before the upgrading of the A217 Brighton Road to a dual carriageway, there was a pond outside the pub, where horses would frequently stop to drink after climbing the hill and before progressing on to Reigate.
The name “Lower Kingswood” dates back to the reign of King Henry VIII. Kingswood and lower Kingswood were the royal hunting woods. The Sportsman public house in Mogador was originally Henry’s hunting lodge. Henry had a palace on Nonsuch park “Nonsuch Palace” and the surrounding royal land stretched from Merton Abbey to Reigate.
