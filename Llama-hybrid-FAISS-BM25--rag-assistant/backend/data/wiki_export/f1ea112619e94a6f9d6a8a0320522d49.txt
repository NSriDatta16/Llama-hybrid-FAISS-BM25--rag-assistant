Only a portion of it has been developed for use, but the rest is intended to service the interment needs of veterans and their families well into the future.  The name Ohio Western Reserve refers part of the Northwest Territory, formerly known as the Connecticut Western Reserve, a tract of land in northeastern Ohio reserved by the state of Connecticut when it ceded its claims to western lands to the federal government in 1786.

In October 2022, the cemetery purchased Rawiga Country Club just to the south adding roughly 150 acres to the cemetery for a total of approximately 423 acres.  Official annexation will not begin for another 10-15 years or when the land becomes needed.
