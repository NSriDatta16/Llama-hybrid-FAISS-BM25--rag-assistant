History
NC 104 appears on the 1924 North Carolina State Map running from NC 10 in Garden City to NC 69 in Micaville. In 1925 NC 104 was truncated to the current US 70-NC 80 junction. In 1930 the road was extended along US 19E then was routed to Loafers Glory. In 1940 NC 104 was renumbered as NC 80.

In 1940 NC 104 was re-introduced as a renumbering of NC 800. The route ran from US 52 to Virginia State Route 104 (now secondary SR 773) at the state border. Between 1954 and 1957 NC 104 was rerouted to its current southern terminus at NC 103.
