Derek Oldbury (1924 - July, 1994) (often known as DEO) was a British draughts champion from Devon.  He was a rival of Marion Tinsley and, after Tinsley, "probably the second best player of all time."  Oldbury was interested in Go As You Please (GAYP) draughts, a variant where players have the liberty to select their own opening moves.

He competed in 7 world championship matches, winning in 1976, 1976 (GAYP) and 1991 (3-move).

Oldbury was born paraplegic.  He wrote the 6-volume The Complete Encyclopaedia of Draughts.
