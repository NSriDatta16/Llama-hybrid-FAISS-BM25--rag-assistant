Francis Alan Jackson  (2 October 1917 – 10 January 2022) was a British organist and composer who served as Director of Music at York Minster for 36 years, from 1946 to 1982.

Personal life and family
Born in Malton, North Yorkshire, Jackson was the son of William Altham Jackson (1888-1944), an engineer and sanitary inspector, and Eveline May Suddaby (1889-1974), who both sang in the local church choir. He was a first cousin once removed of the lyric soprano Elsie Suddaby who, like him, studied with Sir Edward Bairstow.

Jackson married Priscilla Procter, who died in 2013 at the age of 95. They had three children: Alice, William and Edward.

He turned 100 in October 2017, and the occasion was marked by a special concert during that year's Ryedale Festival. He died on 10 January 2022 at the age of 104. His last visit to York Minster was in 2021, to see the newly-restored organ following its £2 million refurbishment.

Career and legacy

Jackson had been a chorister at St Michael's Church, Malton, along with his brother Paul, until he joined the choir of York Minster in 1929, where he sang under Sir Edward Bairstow for four years, after which he returned to Malton to serve as organist at St Michael's from 1933 to 1940. He studied at Durham University and became a Fellow of the Royal College of Organists (FRCO) in 1937, winning the Limpus Prize. After active service during the Second World War he returned to York Minster in 1946 to become Organist and Director of Music, succeeding Bairstow. He held this post for 36 years. After his retirement in 1982, he was appointed Organist Emeritus.

In 1961 Jackson played for the wedding of Elizabeth II's cousin, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, to Katherine Worsley. The final voluntary was the Toccata from Widor's Symphony for Organ No. 5, which set the fashion for the use of this piece for weddings.

From 1972 to 1974 he served as President of the Royal College of Organists. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to music in 1978 and a Commander (CBE) in 2007. He was also recognised with many academic degrees and awards throughout his lifetime.

After his retirement, Jackson and his wife retired to the Ryedale village of Acklam, where they had bought a house in 1954, and for many years he gave recitals in the surrounding area.

Jackson was the mentor of Oscar-winning film composer John Barry.

Compositions and recordings
Jackson gave recitals and concerts all over the world and made numerous recordings of solo organ music and of choral music with the choir of York Minster. His extensive output of sacred and secular music includes canticles, anthems, hymn tunes (including the widely sung "East Acklam"), organ sonatas and other organ pieces such as "Diversion for Mixtures", but his 164 opus numbers range well beyond choral and solo organ music. There are two acclaimed monodramas – Daniel in Babylon and A Time of Fire - as well as the overture Brigantia, an organ concerto (1985), a symphony (1957), chamber music and solo songs. 

Jackson's creative output continued after his retirement. He recorded four CDs of his own organ music for Priory Records, and the organ concerto in 1999. Two CDs of his choral works have also be published.

Writing
Jackson was the author of a biography of his teacher, mentor and predecessor, Sir Edward Bairstow, entitled Blessed City: The Life and Works of Sir Edward C. Bairstow. His autobiography, Music For A Long While, was published in 2013.
