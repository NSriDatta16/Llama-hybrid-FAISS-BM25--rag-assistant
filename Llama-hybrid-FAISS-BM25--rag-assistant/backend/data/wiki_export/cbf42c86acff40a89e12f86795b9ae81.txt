Hvidovre station is a station on the Taastrup radial of the S-train network in Copenhagen, Denmark. It is located about 1 km north of the old village of Hvidovre, in the far northwestern corner in Hvidovre municipality. The station thus also serves areas in the neighbouring Rødovre and Copenhagen municipalities, whereas the larger part of Hvidovre municipality is actually better served by stations on the Køge radial.

Hvidovre station is seen at 1:20:36 in the 1975 Olsen-banden film The Olsen Gang on the Track.
