The Nuclear Safety and Control Act () is Canada's federal legislation on the regulation of the Canadian nuclear industry.

The Act was developed to be more effective and explicit legislation than the one it replaced, the Atomic Energy Control Act of 1946. The Act also provided for the establishment of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC), which replaced the Atomic Energy Control Board (AECB).
