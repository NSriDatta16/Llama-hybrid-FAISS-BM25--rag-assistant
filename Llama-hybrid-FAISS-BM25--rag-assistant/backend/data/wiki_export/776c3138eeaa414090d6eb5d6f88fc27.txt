The House of Assembly Channel is a cable television channel broadcast throughout much of Newfoundland and Labrador, exclusively on cable. The channel first signed on the air on November 17, 2001.

Programming
The House of Assembly Channel broadcasts daily legislative proceedings from Newfoundland and Labrador whenever the House is sitting, as well as Saturday night Memorial University of Newfoundland Sea-Hawks men's and women's basketball home games, and any special programming produced by Memorial University of Newfoundland or Rogers TV and EastLink Television.

First broadcast
Because the fall sitting of the House of Assembly did not take place until November 19, the first program to be broadcast was on November 17 when the Memorial University Sea-Hawks basketball teams played their first home game of the season against the Dalhousie Tigers.
