What art critics say 
Vasile Hutopila's paintings are a serene representation, a victory of the aesthetic truth, equivalent to the humanist love of the universe. Trembling of chromatic intensities, sensitively reduced in tonalities of grey colour in a trajectory of spirituality, of contemporary art. (Ion Vulcan, Bucharest 1987)
Vasile Hutopila is an abstemious who tends unto the chromatic asceticism and the essence of the purified structures. Situated at the junction between sketch and watercolour, his art is organically unitary and it has an attentively watched colour distribution. (Aurel Leon, Cronica, Iași 21 July 1989, after one of the rare watercolour exhibitions of Hutopilǎ, who usually uses oil on canvas technique)
