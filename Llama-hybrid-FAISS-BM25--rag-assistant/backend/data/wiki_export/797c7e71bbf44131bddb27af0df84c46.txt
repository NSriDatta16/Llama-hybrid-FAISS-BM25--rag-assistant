History

The school's original campus, on Glenwood Road, opened in 1929. Named after Herbert Hoover and they claim to be the only high school named after a president while they were in office, the school was built to serve the northern Foothill area of Glendale, which had experienced rapid development in the 1920s. The first issue of the school yearbook, Scroll, included copies of letters written by Hoover and his wife, Lou. The school dedicated that issue to Hoover.

The school has been the setting for several television programs and movies, most notably Because They're Young, which was filmed at the campus during the summer recess in 1959.  The original campus, with the exception of the auditorium and physical education facilities, was demolished in 1966 and replaced with a new facility, which was completed in 1969. In 1990, due to continual and anticipated growth in the number of students entering Hoover High, a 33-classroom facility was built and completed in 1992.

In 2001, Hoover High School met its school wide Academic Performance Index (API) and has received over $150,000 in Governor's Incentive Award money.  For the past two years, 40% of the graduating seniors planned to attend a four-year college. Some 44.4% of graduating seniors meet the University of California A-G requirements.  Hoover High School offers 22 different Advanced Placement (AP) classes which span a wide variety of disciplines including history, English language and literature, science, foreign language, math, economics, art, psychology, and computer programming.

In 2010, Hoover High School met its school wide API target with an overall API of 772; an eleven-point gain over 2009. Hoover High's API has grown 158 points in the last 10 years. Fifty students earned recognition from the College Board as "AP Scholars". Another 15 earned the "AP Scholar with Honor" designation and 20 students earned the honor of "AP Scholar with Distinction."  In 2013, Hoover started offering one AP class for 9th graders for human geography, being one of the first high schools to do so.

Demographics
As of the 2022-2023 school year, 65% of all students are Non-Hispanic Whites (mostly being Armenians), 22% are Hispanics/Latinos, 5% are Asians, with the remaining 8% includes Filipinos, African Americans, American Indians, or Alaska Natives, and Pacific Islanders. Glendale, California has the largest population of Armenians not in Armenia or Russia.

Academics

In fall 2015, the school's automotive program was re-established with support from car dealerships on Brand Boulevard of Cars.

Student discipline and culture
In 2010, outgoing principal Kevin Welsh stated that there were frequent racial tensions between Armenian and Hispanic/Latino students. In 2000 Jefferey Gettleman and Lee Condon of the Los Angeles Times reported that in the event of disputes between Armenians and Latinos, people take racial lines, and that the groups do not often socially mingle. According to Gettleman and Condon, recent graduates and current students of the school characterized it as "polarized" between Latinos and Armenians. Tensions between Armenians and Latinos had occurred in other parts of the Los Angeles area.

At least three violent incidents involving Hoover students have occurred, including the 1995 stabbing death of Tony Petrossian, who had intervened in a fight between two teens over a broken car stereo; the 1998 shooting of Avetis “Avo” Demirchyan, involving in a dispute between Armenians; and the 2000 stabbing of 12th grade student Raul Aguirre, who attempted to intervene between Armenian and Hispanic gangs but who was not a gang member himself. The three incidents did not occur on campus directly, but Welsh stated that they damaged the school's reputation. The Aguirre incident was the first death related to Latino-Armenian tensions.

On October 3, 2018, a brawl broke out in the school's upper quad during lunch break, believed to have been caused by racial tensions between the two groups. Due to the scale of the fight, police was called to break it up and the school was put under lockdown.

Athletics

Hoover High School provides a wide variety of sports to students including boys' water polo (3rd place, 2008-2009 season and again 2009-2010 season and reached CIF division VI quarterfinals) and girls' water polo, boys' and girls' volleyball, boys' and girls' soccer (2006-2007 league champions), boys' and girls' basketball, boys' American football (girls are also welcome), baseball, softball, track, cross country, golf, pep squad, swimming and wrestling.

The 1975 baseball team won the CIF 4A Championship defeating Lakewood High 2-1 at Dodger Stadium.

A significant aspect of the school's history is the long running cross-town rivalry with Glendale High School. "BGD" known as "Big Game Day" or "Beat Glendale Day" is the biggest social/athletic event of the school year. Even though every sport has its own "BGD" game, American football is the biggest of them all. On the day of the big football game, the school provides events such as "The Poster Drop", which is a competition for every grade (9-12) taking place on the Friday morning of the game,  and spirit assemblies. The game usually takes place at Glendale High School because Hoover High School does not have a "proper" field. The BGD game did not take place in 2018 due to security concerns regarding the large scale brawl that occurred weeks prior to the game, breaking the 89 year tradition, while the 2020 game did not take place as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The school's mascot, "The Tornadoes", was temporarily changed in the past to the "Wind Gusts" when a Kansas team whose town had just been ravaged by tornadoes came to visit.

Vic Francy, who had coached the Hoover track teams for 27 years, had previously assisted the 1924-1925 Glendale High School football team while he was a University of Southern California student.

The school also includes a wrestling team. The number of participants declined in 2014, but coach Dave Beard stated that the students who remained were more committed.

In 2015 the school marching band won its first California State Band Championship.
