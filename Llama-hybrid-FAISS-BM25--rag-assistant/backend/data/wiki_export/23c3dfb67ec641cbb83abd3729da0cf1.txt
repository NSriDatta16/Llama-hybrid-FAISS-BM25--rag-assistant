Playing career

Early years & Toronto Lynx 
Dodds played college soccer for Robert Morris University in Pittsburgh, where he earned First Team All-Northeast Conference honours from 2001–2003. In 2004, he was drafted by the Toronto Lynx of the USL A-League. His signing was announced in a press conference which revealed the team roster for the upcoming season. He made his debut for the club on April 17, 2004, in a match against Puerto Rico Islanders coming on as a substitute for Tyler Hughes. In his rookie season, he played 25 games while missing only two matches and scored two goals, and recorded two assists. At the end of the season, Dodds finished in the top five for the Lynx in games and minutes played.

On March 17, 2005, the Lynx announced the re-signing of Dodds for the 2005 season. He had a productive season despite Toronto finishing the season last in the standings; where he recorded 6 goals and recorded 3 assists making him the top team goal scorer and co-leader in assists. When the season came to a conclusion Dodds was named the Lynx Most Valuable Player.

In April 2006, Dodds signed a new contract with the club and entered his third season. In his third season, Dodds was a key member in the Lynx midfield, scoring 6 goals and recording 7 assists.
