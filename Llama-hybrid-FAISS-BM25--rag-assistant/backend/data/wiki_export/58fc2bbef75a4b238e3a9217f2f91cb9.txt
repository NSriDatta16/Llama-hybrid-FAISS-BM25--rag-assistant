Plot

In the fictional and peaceful town of Goshikichō, there lives a strange family named the Yoshinagas.

One day, the eldest daughter Futaba wins the third prize in a lottery held in the shopping district. It turns out to be a talking dog-shaped statue whose appearance changes the lives of the Yoshinaga family. He positions himself at the entrance of the Yoshinaga residence, challenging anyone who approaches. The increasing notoriety of the statue, and by extension her family, angers Futaba, leading her to wanting him gone. But after some time being with the Yoshinaga family, Gar-kun corrects his ways and people begin to consider him as the guardian of the town.

For the sake of protecting his newfound family, along with the help of eldest brother Kazumi and his creator Iyo, Gar-kun must contend with the various foes and hardships that befall the town of Goshikichō.

Gargoyle Alternative

In the fairly peaceful city of Inosaki, in an unsafe business district, there is a multi-tenant building called Isshiki Building. On the third floor, there lives a runaway apprentice alchemist called Hikaru. She works as a detective from her home-turned-office called the Henhouse with her living mithril statue nicknamed "Gar-suke."

One day, Hikaru receives a case from a recently established flower shop on the first floor of Isshiki Building. However, this only begins an intense battle with a group of old scientists called Mizuchi who are after the Balance of Rā that Hikaru created using her alchemy.

Hikaru, with fellow residents of the same building, stand together to crush Mizuchi's ambitions before they get what they want.
