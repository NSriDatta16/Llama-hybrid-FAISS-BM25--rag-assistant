Dine Alone Records is a Canadian and American independent record label, founded in St. Catharines and Toronto by Joel Carriere. The label is now based in Toronto, Nashville and Los Angeles.

History 
Dine Alone was born out of founder Joel Carriere's home in St. Catharines, Ontario. After years working various positions in the Canadian music industry and building his own cultural website and promotional company, Carriere launched Dine Alone Records in 2005. With a name drawn from the songs "Dine Alone" by the post-hardcore band Quicksand, and a set of founders who had ties to the North American heavy music scene, Dine Alone worked with artists such as The Fullblast, Johnny Truant, City and Colour and Attack in Black.

Dine Alone quickly expanded its roster from the early days of City and Colour, Arkells, and Bedouin Soundclash to over 50 national and international artists. Dine Alone Records was named the number one independent label and the number four label overall in Canada in Nielsen Soundscan's 2013 year-end report. In 2013, the label expanded into Nashville and furthermore, to Los Angeles in 2014.

In 2015, Dine Alone Records launched a series of events and projects to celebrate their tenth anniversary, including 'Wax on Wheels' – the label's official mobile record shop. Dine Alone Records was named Canadian Independent of the Year at The Canadian Music Industry Awards for the second year in a row in May 2015.
