Mid Cheshire is a former two-member United Kingdom parliamentary constituency which existed in the 19th century. 

Further to the completion of the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, it will be re-established as a single-member seat to be first contested at the next general election.

Contents of re-established seat 
The re-established seat will comprise the following Mid Cheshire towns, together with surrounding villages and rural areas:

 Middlewich, transferred from Congleton;
 Northwich, transferred from Weaver Vale (to be abolished, with majority of electorate being included in the new constituency of Runcorn and Helsby); and
 Winsford, transferred from Eddisbury (to be renamed Chester South and Eddisbury).

History 
Under the Reform Act 1867, the Parliamentary County of Cheshire was divided into three 2-member constituencies. This was achieved by the creation of Mid Cheshire which comprised the Hundred of Bucklow from North Cheshire and the Hundred of Northwich from South Cheshire.

Under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885, the three 2-member seats were abolished and re-divided into eight single-member constituencies: Altrincham, Crewe, Eddisbury, Hyde, Knutsford, Macclesfield, Northwich and Wirral.

Boundaries
1868â€“1885: The Hundreds of Bucklow and Northwich.
