Saturday Night Special is an American comedy-variety show that aired weekly Saturday nights on Fox.

Overview
This show was a competitor to Saturday Night Live, with a similar format of comedy skits and musicians. It debuted on April 1, 1996, through May 18, 1996, airing in the same timeslot as the temporarily displaced MADtv.

The theme song to the show was War's "Low Rider".  Two memorable skits involved Demi Moore (Roseanne) talking about her involvement in the movie "Striptease", and Zira (the chimpanzee woman from "Planet of the Apes") hosting a radio advice program.  There was also a skit in which Lauren Hutton (Jennifer Coolidge) pleasured herself while interviewing two black actors.
