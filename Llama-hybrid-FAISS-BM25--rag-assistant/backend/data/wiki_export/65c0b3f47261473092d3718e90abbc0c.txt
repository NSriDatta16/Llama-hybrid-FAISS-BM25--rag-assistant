Holytown railway station is a railway station serving both Holytown and New Stevenston in North Lanarkshire, Scotland. It is located on the Shotts Line,  south east of  towards  and is also on the Argyle Line.  It was opened in 1880 (as 'Carfin') at the same time as the Wishaw Deviation Line from Law Junction, though the line on which it actually stands (the Wishaw and Coltness Railway) is considerably older.

Despite its name, the station is some  from the edge of Holytown; instead it is in New Stevenston.

The station was opened to assist the coal mining industry; the mines are now long gone.

Around 2003, some services to  on the Argyle Line began running via Holytown (by means of the Mossend South to East curve) then down to Wishaw, creating two routes (one via Holytown and the other via the already existing Shieldmuir). This created a twice-hourly service at Holytown to/from Glasgow and a regular link to/from Motherwell.
