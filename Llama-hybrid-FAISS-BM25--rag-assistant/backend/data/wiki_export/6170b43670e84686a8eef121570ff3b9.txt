DJ Tonka (born Thomas-René Gerlach on June 24, 1973 in Mainz, West Germany) is a German electronic dance musician.  He is also known as Tonka, Chip Tunes, and Thomastic.

Musical career
In his early career, Thomas-René Gerlach worked with fellow producer Ian Pooley in the groups Outrage, Space Cube, and T'N'I. Together they produced several records in techno, progressive house and breakbeat. In 1996, the partnership was dissolved (an EP with unreleased tracks was still released in 1997), and coincidentally, both started producing a more mainstream-friendly sound.

As a solo artist, Gerlach took on the name DJ Tonka and began producing house music, with influences from synthpop and the American garage house scene. He achieved some notoriety as a remixer, reworking tunes such as "Trapped" for disco artist Colonel Abrams, "Love Shack" for The B-52's and "Push It" for Salt-N-Pepa.

Tonka cites Grandmaster Flash and Depeche Mode among his influences. He has also founded two record labels: Uplifting Records in 1997 and Vivienne Records in 2000.
