"(If You're Not in It for Love) I'm Outta Here!" is a song co-written and recorded by Canadian country music singer Shania Twain. It was released on November 15, 1995, as the fourth single from her second studio album, The Woman in Me. Written by Twain and then husband and producer Robert John "Mutt" Lange, the song lyrically speaks about Twain wanting real love and if they're not in it for love, she's "outta here".

The song topped the US Billboard Hot Country Songs chart and Canadian RPM Country Tracks chart for two and six weeks respectively. An alternate remix was released to Australia in November 1996, peaking at number five on the ARIA Singles Chart. "I'm Outta Here!" was later included on Twain's 2004 Greatest Hits package, and has been performed on all of her tours. In 1997, the Eurodance group Real McCoy covered "I'm Outta Here!".

Chart performance

It spent 20 weeks on the chart and peaked at number one on February 3, 1996, where it remained for two weeks; it marked her second number one country hit after "Any Man of Mine". The song also topped the Country Singles Sales chart for one week. Released as a double a-side single with the title track, "I'm Outta Here!" debuted on the all-genre Billboard Hot 100 on November 28, 1995, at number 90. The song later reached a peak of number 74 on the January 6, 1996, issue; "I'm Outta Here!" marked Twain's second Hot 100 entry after the double a-side single "Any Man Of Mine/Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under?".

The song also made an appearance on the RPM Adult Contemporary Chart, peaking at number 49 on March 4, 1996.

Whilst previous singles like "You Lay a Whole Lot of Love on Me" and "The Woman in Me (Needs the Man in You)" were released internationally, "I'm Outta Here was Twain's first successful single outside North America. The song became a particular hit in Australia, where an alternate version remixed by Mutt Lange was released instead.

It spent a total of 22 weeks on the chart.

Music video
The music video for "I'm Outta Here!" was shot in New York City and directed by Steven Goldmann. It was filmed on November 4, 1995, and released 11 days later. The video is radically different from Twain's previous videos, and its pop rock feel and sex appeal engendered into most of Twain's subsequent videos.

The video begins with a shot of Twain standing behind a blue light in front of a man sitting on a chair. She walks up to the man, who stands up and flips over his chair, meanwhile, the video cuts to a slow-motion shot of people dancing in a club and a shot of Twain walking up to a microphone in front of her and surrounded by many people playing drums. It cuts back to Twain trying to sit on the chair, when the man kicks it away for her to fall on the floor. But the next shot of them is them laughing and pushing away as people start to come over. In the subsequent shots, intercut with shots of Twain performing alone without the drums, Twain and several others drumming near a window, and Twain on a balcony, friends grab the microphone off of Twain and engage in a karaoke session with her, male stereotypes try to turn on Twain near the microphone, Twain teaches people a dance routine, people play air guitar with fake guitars, and Twain plays along to the drummers. In the final shot, Twain walks out of the building alone.

Three versions of the video were released; the 'Album Version' for country music video channels, the 'Mutt Lange Remix' for Australia and the 'Dance Remix' for Canadian pop channels. The 'Album Version' video is available on Twain's DVD The Platinum Collection, while the 'Mutt Lange Mix' video is available on iTunes, VEVO and YouTube. The video won the Video of the Year Award at the 1996 Canadian Country Music Awards.

On video-sharing website YouTube, the video is one of Twain's least-viewed videos on the platform, with only 2.8 million views as of February 2021.

Live performances
During Twain's Come On Over Tour and Up! Tour, the song was performed as the last main song of the setlist before returning to the stage for her encores. Each of the cities Twain visited on both tours, she would invite a local school Marching Band drum line to join her on stage. Twain would also play the drums along as well on stage. At the end of the song on the Come On Over Tour, Twain leads the drummers into a drum roll, which leads into a grand finale, including Twain standing on top of a big drum, while an electric lap steel guitar solo plays, before disappearing into it as fireworks and confetti erupt from the stage. On the Up! Tour, she again leads the drummers in joining in a big drum roll which lets off the fireworks with Twain disappearing after the song ends. The song has also been performed during her Vegas residency and her Rock This Country tour as the last song before the encore.
