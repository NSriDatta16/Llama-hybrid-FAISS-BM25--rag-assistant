The Dodge Attitude is a badge-engineered subcompact sedan sold by Stellantis North America (previously Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, Chrysler Group LLC, and Dodge Chrysler LLC) in Mexico over three generations since 2006.

Overview 
The Attitude was commercialised exclusively in the Mexican market, when the local subsidiary of Chrysler rebadged the Hyundai Accent (MC) for the original version using the "Dodge" brand. The model line was updated in 2011 with the Accent RB series.

From January 2015, the Mitsubishi Attrage/Mirage G4 was rebadged as the third generation model.
