Yakir Yerushalayim (; ) is an annual citizenship prize in Jerusalem, inaugurated in 1967.

The prize is awarded annually by the municipality of the City of Jerusalem to one or more residents of the city who have contributed to the cultural and educational life of the city in some outstanding way. Prize recipients must be over 65 years old. They are selected by a five-panel committee appointed by the mayor, which reviews the candidates and selects a long-time resident of Jerusalem whose work on behalf of the city or life story is an inspiration to others. The award ceremony is held on Yom Yerushalayim.

Recommendations for the award are submitted by city council members. The final selection among the nominees takes place in the spring.
