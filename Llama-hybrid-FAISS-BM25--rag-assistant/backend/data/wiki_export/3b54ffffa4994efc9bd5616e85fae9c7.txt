Huevos is the fifth studio album by the Arizona alternative rock band the Meat Puppets. It was released October 27, 1987 on SST Records. The album title is literally the Spanish word for "eggs," although it carries a slang meaning associated with testicular fortitude. Most of the songs were recorded in one take. The cover art is done by guitarist/vocalist Curt Kirkwood.

The 1999 Rykodisc re-release features five unreleased bonus tracks (early demos of "Sexy Music", "Paradise", "Fruit" and "Automatic Mojo" and a cover of Jimmy Reed's "Baby What You Want Me to Do") as well as live footage of "Automatic Mojo" filmed at the band's January 22, 1988 concert at the Variety Arts Center in Los Angeles.
