History
The name Atoll Bellinghausen or more rarely Bellingshausen was given to this small atoll by Otto von Kotzebue, an officer and navigator of Baltic German descent in the Imperial Russian Navy, in honour of Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen.

The atoll was visited by the US Exploring Expedition in Sept. 1839.
