History

19th century
In 1872, Martha Mitchell began teaching her children and their neighbors children inside the Mitchell Family Adobe in what is now the Vista Canyon neighborhood of Canyon Country. In 1874, the group moved from their single room adobe classroom to a room within the Lang family's Sulphur Springs Hotel. By 1879, there were enough school children enrolled to form a school district, which was named after the mineral hot springs the hotel was built beside.

A purpose-built single room classroom was constructed in 1886, which became known as Sulphur Springs Community School.

20th century
In 1982, Valley View Elementary School was transferred from the Saugus Union School District to Sulphur Springs School District and renamed Valley View Community School.

In 1991, Honby Elementary School, opened in 1963 as a part of Saugus Union School District, was transferred to Sulphur Springs School District and renamed Canyon Springs Community School.
