The Catholic Church in Syria is part of the worldwide Catholic Church, under the spiritual leadership of the Pope in Rome.

In 2020, there were 192,000 Catholics in Syria, approximately 1% of the total population. The Catholics of Syria are members of several different Rite/language-specific Churches; mainly the Melkite, but also including Armenian, Chaldean, Syriac, Maronite and in addition to the Latin Church - there are separate but overlapping jurisdictions for the faithful of each Church.

All these bishops are members of the 'national' Assembly of Catholic Ordinaries in Syria and of the (vast) regional Episcopal Conference for Arab countries. The Eastern Catholic bishops also belong to the (international) synod of their patriarchate or other specific church.
