With its highest peak being Krottenkopf (2,086 m), the highest part of the range just exceeds 2,000 m. The range is of composed of limestone. The treeline is around 1,700 m.

Peaks

Most important summits 
The most important summits in the Ester range are the Krottenkopf (2,086 m), the Bischof (2,033 m), the Hohe Kisten (1,922 m), the Hoher Fricken (1,940 m) and the Simetsberg (1,836 m). The climbs both from the Loisach valley as well as from Kr√ºn or Wallgau in the southeast are relatively long. As a result the Ester Mountains are relatively quiet with the exception of the Wank mountain (1,780 m) which is  accessible by cable car (the Wankbahn). Most tourists and mountaineers are attracted to the nearby higher ranges Wetterstein, Karwendel and to the highest peak of Germany, the Zugspitze.
