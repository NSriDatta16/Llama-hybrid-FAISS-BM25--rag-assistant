is a kata (a set of prearranged techniques) in Judo. It is also known as Kito-ryu no Kata (起倒流の形). It consists of 21 techniques originally belonging to the Takenaka-ha  Kito School of jujutsu. Jigoro Kano revised the techniques and incorporated them into a kata in order to preserve the historical source of judo. The set of forms is antique and were intended for "Kumiuchi", the grappling of armored warriors in the feudal ages. As such, the kata is to be performed with both partners imagining that they are clad in armor.
The Koshiki-no-kata, together with Nage-no-kata, Katame-no-kata, Ju-no-kata, Kime-no-kata and Goshin-Jitsu, is recognised by the International Judo Federation (IJF.)
Although koshiki-no-kata is not often seen in the United States, it is still taught and practiced in Japan.  Some striking demonstrations of it from the 1950s can be seen in the film "Classic Judo Kata," by Harold Sharp.
If the description of the kata in that film is correct, it would be the only judo kata that involves attacking the cervical spine.
