Try for the Sun: The Journey of Donovan is the second CD boxed set from Scottish singer-songwriter Donovan. It was released on 13 September 2005 (Epic/Legacy E2K 46986).

History
Thirteen years after the release of Troubadour: The Definitive Collection 1964-1976, Donovan released a second CD box set titled Try for the Sun: The Journey of Donovan after one of Donovan's early songs "To Try for the Sun".  The box set consists of four discs, three compact discs and one DVD.

The compact discs cover highlights of Donovan's career from his 1964 recording of "Co'dine" (released on Sixty Four in 2004) to a re-recording of "Happiness Runs" from 2005.  The DVD contains a 1970 film titled "There Is an Ocean" from Donovan's band Open Road, that had been previously unreleased.  In addition to the film, many of the songs from Try for the Sun: The Journey of Donovan were previously unreleased on any Donovan album.
