Legend and history
Perşembe is on the Vona Peninsula on the Black Sea coast and is held to be the point where the legendary Jason and the Argonauts were forced to land during their struggle with the storms and currents of the Black Sea.

For a long time Vona was part of the Roman Empire and its successors the Byzantine Empire and Empire of Trebizond. This era ended in 1461 when Trebizond was overturned by Sultan Mehmet II and Vona was brought into the Ottoman Empire, although there was a Turkish (Chepni Tribes) community in the town before this date. By 1520 the port of Vona was a predominantly Muslim town.

The name of the town derives from the Persian word پنج‌شنبه (penc-şenbe) for Thursday.
