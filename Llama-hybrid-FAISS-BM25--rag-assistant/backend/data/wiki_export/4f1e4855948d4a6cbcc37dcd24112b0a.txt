Exocarpos is a genus of flowering shrubs and small trees in the sandalwood family, Santalaceae. They are found throughout Southeast Asia, Australia and the Pacific Islands.

They are semi-parasitic, requiring the roots of a host tree, a trait they share with many other members of the Santalaceae.

In Australia, they are known as ballarts, and several species are known as cherries.

Within Australia, an identification key is available for New South Wales species, and for Victorian species.
