'Karnata Bharata Kathamanjari () is the Kannada version of the Indian epic Mahabharata, written by Kumara Vyasa. It encompasses the first 10 chapters of the original epic.

The poetic style employed in this work is Bhamini Shatpadi, which is prominent in Kannada literature.  While the poet relies on the original storyline for most of the work, there are notable deviations, particularly in the portrayal of Karna. The work is famous for the abundance of metaphors, and the poet has been aptly called the king of metaphors.

The remaining eight chapters that were left incomplete by Kumara Vyasa were completed by Shri M S Ananthapadmanabha Rao. These additional chapters, totaling over eight thousand poems, maintain the Bhamini Shatpadi style and were compiled as Karnata Bharata Kathamanjari. The compilation was released in 2002. Rao was honored with the Kannada Sahitya Academy award in 1977â€“78 for his contribution to the Kannada literature.
