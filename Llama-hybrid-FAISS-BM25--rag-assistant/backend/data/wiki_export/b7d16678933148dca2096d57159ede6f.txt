David Cerda (born June 13, 1961, Hammond, Indiana) is an American performer and playwright based in Chicago, Illinois. He is currently the Artistic Director for Hell In A Handbag Productions, which he co-founded in 2002. His campy, highly theatrical plays have made him an infamous icon within the Chicago theater scene. He has written and appeared in many of his works including a transgressive adaptation of Rudolph, the Red-Hosed Reindeer, How ‘What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?’ Happened and POSEIDON! An Upside-Down Musical which won the New York International Fringe Festival Best Ensemble Award and was the most attended show of the festival that year.

Cerda’s theatre group has also raised money for Chicago LGBT non-profits such as: Season of Concern, AIDS Legal Council, Howard Brown, the Legacy Project, Windy City Alliance for the Deaf, and Groceryland.
