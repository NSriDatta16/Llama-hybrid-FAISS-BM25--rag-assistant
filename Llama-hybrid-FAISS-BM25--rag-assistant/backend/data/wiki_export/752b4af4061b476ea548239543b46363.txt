Phillipsburg High School is a comprehensive, four-year public high school located in Phillipsburg, in Warren County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The school was first established in 1871. For this reason, the school's nickname is the "Stateliners." The school has been accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Elementary and Secondary Schools since 2000.

The school is part of the Phillipsburg School District, one of 31 former Abbott districts statewide that were established pursuant to the decision by the New Jersey Supreme Court in Abbott v. Burke which are now referred to as "SDA Districts" based on the requirement for the state to cover all costs for school building and renovation projects in these districts under the supervision of the New Jersey Schools Development Authority. The district serves students from Phillipsburg and from five other municipalities: Alpha, Bloomsbury (in Hunterdon County), Greenwich Township, Lopatcong Township and Pohatcong Township, who attend as part of sending/receiving relationships.

The site of the new Phillipsburg High School, which began construction in January 2014, is in Lopatcong Township. The three-story,  building, with more than double the floor space of the existing high school and a capacity to accommodate more than 2,100 students, was completed for the 2016–17 school year and was dedicated in September 2016 at ceremonies attended by Governor of New Jersey Chris Christie. Phillipsburg High School's enrollment had been in excess of the school's capacity. To compensate for this, the Phillipsburg School District purchased or leased 31 trailers.

As of the 2021–22 school year, the school had an enrollment of 1,809 students and 133.5 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 13.6:1. There were 429 students (23.7% of enrollment) eligible for free lunch and 36 (2.0% of students) eligible for reduced-cost lunch.

Awards, recognition and rankings
The school was the 183rd-ranked public high school in New Jersey out of 339 schools statewide in New Jersey Monthly magazine's September 2014 cover story on the state's "Top Public High Schools", using a new ranking methodology. The school had been ranked 215th in the state of 328 schools in 2012, after being ranked 276th in 2010 out of 322 schools listed. The magazine ranked the school 275th in 2008 out of 316 schools. The school was ranked 234th in the magazine's September 2006 issue, which surveyed 316 schools across the state.

New high school
Original plans for a new high school campus had stalled due to lack of funds by the New Jersey Schools Construction Corporation. In July 2008, new state funding was secured and on October 5, 2009, a groundbreaking ceremony was held at the site of the new high school located on Belvidere Road in Lopatcong Township. Then-Governor Jon Corzine was in attendance as well as former Governor James Florio, Phillipsburg School District Superintendent Mark B. Miller and then-State Education Commissioner Lucille Davy.

The new campus had been expected to cost $174.4 million and was planned to hold a  school and seven athletic fields. After the initial plans had been put on hold, Governor Chris Christie announced in February 2012 that the plan was back online, with a revised estimate of $675 million for the project. Initial contracts were awarded in 2013, with a projected open date for the 2016–17 school year. After many delays, construction started in January 2014 and the new school opened on September 12, 2016. The class of 2020 will be the first to have never attended the old high school building.

Easton Area High School rivalry
The Stateliners have an athletic rivalry with neighboring Easton Area High School in Easton, Pennsylvania, which celebrated its 100th annual football game on Thanksgiving 2006, making it one of the oldest rivalries in the nation. The 100th meeting between the two schools, which Easton won 21–7, was broadcast nationally on ESPN2 on Thanksgiving Day 2006. The game, which typically draws some 15,000 - 20,000 fans before Thanksgiving dinner is served, was broadcast nationally on ESPN in 1988, with games played on Lafayette College's Fisher Field in Easton. In 2009, the 1993 teams from the Easton / Phillipsburg game met again for the Gatorade REPLAY Game to resolve the game, which ended in a 7–7 tie, with more than 13,000 fans watching as Phillipsburg won by a score of 27–12. The two schools have participated in an annual rivalry since 1905, which Easton leads 68-42-5 through the 2021 season with Easton winning having won the last 6 meetings. NJ.com listed the rivalry in the second spot on their 2017 list "Ranking the 31 fiercest rivalries in N.J.
