Peter Gunn is a 1989 American made-for-television crime drama film directed by Blake Edwards. It was intended as a pilot to relaunch the Peter Gunn franchise starring Peter Strauss in the role of private detective Peter Gunn.

The pilot was aired on ABC on April 23, 1989, but a TV series was not commissioned. The idea of a revival began in 1977 when E. Jack Neuman was approached to write a made-for-TV movie to bring back the original Peter Gunn, Craig Stevens to the role. The project ended because of Blake Edwards' film shooting schedule. Edwards once again announced a TV movie version in 1984 which was intended to star Robert Wagner as Gunn. This eventually became the 1989 TV movie starring Peter Strauss.

Plot

Detective Peter Gunn is asked by a mob boss to find the murderer of a friend's brother. Although he is working outside from the mob, Gunn is nonetheless pursued by mobsters, the cops and interested women. The story heats up when Gunn finds information that suggests the cops are being framed.
