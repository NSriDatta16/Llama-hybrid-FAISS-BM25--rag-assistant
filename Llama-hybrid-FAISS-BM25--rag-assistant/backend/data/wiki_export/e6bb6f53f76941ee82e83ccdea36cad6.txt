Caustic Eye Productions is a small Charleston, West Virginia based record label and promotions company that was started in August of 2001 by Rod Lanham.  The focus of the label is to give local WV artists the means to essentially self-release their works without having to know how to do it.  Caustic Eye functions as the liaison between the artist and the production facility, or in the case of limited edition titles, assembles the product in house.  All rights of the works are retained by the artists themselves.  In addition to the catalogued releases, Caustic Eye has assisted bands with promotional CDs and other co-released projects.  The genres featured can vary from Heavy Metal (Byzantine) to Alt-Country (Jeff Ellis) to Psychedelic Rock (Mind Garage) and Doom/Drone (Hyatari).
