History
The first Mormon missionaries arrived in Brazil in the 1920s. Most of the early converts in Brazil were German immigrants coming to Brazil after World War I. In 1931, the 80 members of the small branch near São Paulo built the first LDS meetinghouse in Brazil. During World War II Mormon missionaries were removed from Brazil, but when missionaries returned after the war Brazilian natives began joining the church by the hundreds. Church membership in Brazil continues to grow quickly. The Campinas Temple serves more than 117,000 members from 36 stakes in the area. Brazil is home to more Latter-day Saints than any other country in the world, except the United States and Mexico. Plans to build the Campinas Brazil Temple were announced on April 3, 1997.

The temple has a total area of , which includes four ordinance rooms and three sealing rooms. Hundreds of people came for the groundbreaking ceremony and site dedication.

The temple was open to the public April 20, 2002 through May 11, 2002. Tens of thousands of people were able to take a tour through the temple and learn more about its sacred importance. LDS Church president Gordon B. Hinckley dedicated the Campinas Brazil Temple on May 17, 2002. Four sessions were held which allowed thousands to attend the dedication. Before the dedication, Hinckley met with a large group outside and the final cornerstone was placed in the temple. The construction was then officially completed.

In 2020, the Campinas Brazil Temple was closed temporarily during the year in response to the coronavirus pandemic.
