The Richmond County School System is an American public school system based in Augusta, Georgia. It is run by the Richmond County Board of Education which, under Article VIII, ยง V, Paragraph 2, requires that each school system be under the management and control of an elected board of education. As elected Constitutional officials of Georgia, the school board members are responsible for setting educational policies, employing school personnel, providing buildings and equipment, operating a transportation system, and disbursing school funds. The board of education meets in the Richmond County Board of Education building at 864 Broad Street in Augusta, Georgia. It serves consolidated Augusta-Richmond County, Georgia and the south Richmond County cities of Hephzibah and Blythe. The system has an enrollment of around 32,000 students, attending 36 elementary schools, ten middle schools, eight high schools, four magnet schools, and three other schools. The school board  
has its own police department which provides law enforcement services to all the district's schools.

The Richmond County School System is in the third phase of a construction program that will renovate older schools and add new schools, particularly for its magnet program. This will include a fine arts elementary magnet school, a vocational magnet school, and second magnet traditional elementary school.

On the most recent state-mandated testing of the academic achievement as well as college- and career-readiness of its students (2019 Georgia Milestones Assessment System-GMAS), the Richmond County School System was ranked among the bottom-ten of the 180 public school systems  in Georgia.
