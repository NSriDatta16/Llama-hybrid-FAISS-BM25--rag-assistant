"I Believe in You and Me" is a song written by Sandy Linzer and David Wolfert in 1982. The song was first recorded and released by the R&B group The Four Tops, who released it as a single from their album One More Mountain (1982). While it failed to reach the US Top 40, it became a moderate hit for the group on the US Billboard R&B chart, peaking at number 40 in early 1983.

In 1996, R&B/pop singer Whitney Houston recorded a cover of the song for her film The Preacher's Wife and released it as a single. Following its release, the song became a top 5 pop and R&B hit in the US, also peaking on music charts worldwide.

History and composition
The original version recorded by The Four Tops was a moderate success, charting at number 40 on the US Billboard's Hot Black Singles chart.

Due to the bigger success of the Whitney Houston version, "I Believe in You and Me" is most popularly known as a Whitney Houston song. 

Shortly before the death of Four Tops lead singer Levi Stubbs in 2008, who was sidelined from the group due to complications of a stroke, and confined to a wheelchair, appeared with the other members of The Four Tops, and Aretha Franklin, and sang "I Believe In You and Me" live onstage in Detroit, in his final television appearance on From The Heart: The Four Tops 50th Anniversary Special (2004) on PBS.

Critical response
J. D. Considine of The Baltimore Sun called the song "the Designated Hit Ballad" and added "[it] is pretty much what we've come to expect from Houston ― a slow, Streisand-esque build-up, a subtle sense of drama and a big, full-voiced payoff in the final chorus." Also American magazine Billboard gave the song a positive review, saying "As she did with Dolly Parton's 'I Will Always Love You,' Houston redefines the composition with a soaring, glass-shattering performance that will leave her legions of fans breathless." While reviewing the soundtrack, Elysa Gardner of Los Angeles Times wrote described it as "a cheesy classic in the tradition of 'I Will Always Love You,' with an instantly familiar melody and a poignant, bolero-like arrangement." A reviewer from Music Week commented, "More serious schmaltz from The Preacher's Wife sountrack. Clearly destined for the Top 20 and anyone with a chocolate box heart." In his review for the soundtrack, Neil Strauss from The New York Times praised the song as one of "the year's most virtuosic pop ballads."
