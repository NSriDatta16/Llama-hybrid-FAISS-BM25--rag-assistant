Critical reception
MusicHound Rock: The Essential Album Guide wrote that "the album, devoid of the occasional rawness that makes [Zumpano's] debut sound unfinished, is a masterpiece." Trouser Press called the album "another absolute delight," writing that it displays "more ambition, confidence and intuitive skill." Portland Mercury called it "a melancholy masterpiece that cemented Carl Newman's entrenchment in the mid-'60s piano pop cocktail lounge of the mind."
