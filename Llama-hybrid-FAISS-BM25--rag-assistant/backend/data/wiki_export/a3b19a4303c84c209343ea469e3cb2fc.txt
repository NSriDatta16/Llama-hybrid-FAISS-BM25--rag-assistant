Juklavatnet is a lake on the border of the municipalities of Kvinnherad and Ullensvang in Vestland county, Norway.  The  lake lies just outside Folgefonna National Park and immediately to the west of the Nordre Folgefonna glacier.  The only road access comes from the small village of Nordrepollen in the Mauranger area of Kvinnherad municipality, about  south of the lake.  There is a dam on the western end of the lake which regulates the depth of the water so that it can be used for hydroelectric power generation.  The lake is the largest reservoir that feeds into the Mauranger power station.
