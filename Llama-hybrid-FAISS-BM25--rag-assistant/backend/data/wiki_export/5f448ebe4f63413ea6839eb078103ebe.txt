The Slovak Cup (), currently named Slovnaft Cup due to sponsorship agreement with Slovnaft, is the only nationwide knockout competition in Slovak football. The winner qualifies for the UEFA Europa Conference League qualification rounds.

History

The competition was first contested in 1969. Until 1993, the winner of the Slovak Cup would face the winner of the Czech Cup in the Czechoslovak Cup final, the winner of which would be Czechoslovakia's representative in the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup (Slovan Bratislava won the tournament in 1968/1969).
