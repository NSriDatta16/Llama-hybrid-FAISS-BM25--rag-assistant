Yoko Utsumi is a Japanese musical artist.  Her solo music is a blend of punk, rock and ska influences, with some blues and jazz thrown in.  During her long career, she has also played Japanese traditional music.

Utsumi has been a member of a few important Japanese underground bands, including Mescaline Drive, Soul Flower Union and Soul Flower Mononoke Summit.
