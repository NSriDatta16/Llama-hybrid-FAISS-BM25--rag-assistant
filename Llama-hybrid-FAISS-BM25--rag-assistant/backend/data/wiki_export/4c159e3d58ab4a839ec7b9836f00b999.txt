History
In the 1910s, a railway between Sonkovo and Mga was built. The railway station which is now located in the town of Pestovo was named after the village of Russkoye Pestovo, located  from the station. The first train arrived to the station in 1915. The name of Russkoye Pestovo, and subsequently the name of Pestovo, originates from the personal Novgorodian name Pest. At the time, the area was a part of Ustyuzhensky Uyezd in Cherepovets Governorate.

In 1924, a sawmill was constructed on the bank of the Mologa close to the station. The sawmill was built by a German company and given to it as a concession. In 1925, a settlement of Pestovo, serving the sawmill, was founded.

On August 1, 1927, Cherepovets Governorate was abolished, and its territory was merged into Cherepovets Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. The uyezds were abolished as well and, effective October 1, 1927, Pestovsky District was established, with the administrative center in Pestovo. On September 19, 1927, Pestovo was granted work settlement status. On July 23, 1930 the okrugs were abolished and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. On July 5, 1944, Pestovsky District was transferred to newly established Novgorod Oblast. On January 12, 1965, Pestovo was granted the town status.
