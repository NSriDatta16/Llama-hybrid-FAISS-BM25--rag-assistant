Raymond Russell (born 26 July 1972) is a Scottish professional golfer.

Russell turned professional in 1993 and won a European Tour card at the 1995 qualifying school. His only European Tour win came in his 1996 rookie season at the Air France Cannes Open. 1996 and 1997 were his two best seasons, with 14th and 16th place seasons on the Order of Merit. He did not build on this early success, but stayed in the top 100 of the Order of Merit every season until 2004. In 2005 he finished 119 and lost full membership of the tour. His best finish in a major championship is tied fourth at the 1998 Open Championship at Royal Birkdale.

Russell represented Great Britain & Ireland in the 1993 Walker Cup and Scotland in the Alfred Dunhill Cup (1996 and 1997) and the 1997 World Cup.
