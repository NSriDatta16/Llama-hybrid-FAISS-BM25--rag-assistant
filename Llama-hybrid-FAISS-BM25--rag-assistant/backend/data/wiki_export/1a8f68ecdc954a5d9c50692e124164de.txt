"When It's Over" is a song by the Canadian rock band Loverboy from their album Get Lucky released in 1981.  Written by band members Paul Dean and Mike Reno, it features Nancy Nash on background vocals.  Relying heavily on synthesizers, the song became a Top 40 hit for the band when released as a single the following year, peaking at number 17 on Canada's RPM Top Singles in May and number 26 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart for two weeks in June 1982.

Billboard calls the song a "catchy midtempo rocker", while AllMusic's Donald A. Guarisco considers it a "moody power ballad" with Reno's "show-stoppingly emotional vocal performance".
