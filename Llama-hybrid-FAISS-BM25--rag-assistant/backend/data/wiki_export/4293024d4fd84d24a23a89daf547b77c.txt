Ligovsky Prospekt () is a major street in Saint Petersburg. Before the establishment of the city, it was a street leading to Novgorod, used by the people living in the villages around the Neva delta. 

Between 1718-25, when Saint Petersburg was the capital of Russia, construction began on the Ligovsky Canal. The canal was used to transfer water from the river to fountains of the Summer Garden, hence the name of the street and the canal. After the flood of 1777 all the fountains were demolished, and later the canal was as well.
