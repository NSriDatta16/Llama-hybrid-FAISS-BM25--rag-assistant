Econometric Theory is an economics journal specialising in econometrics, published by Cambridge Journals. Its current editor is Peter Phillips. It is one of the main econometrics journals.

The journal was founded against a backdrop of strong growth in econometrics research in 1985. At the time of its foundation, a main goal was to support theoretical developments in econometrics. Whereas many early articles focused exclusively on theory, disregarding practical applications, it became standard practice to include empirical illustrations or simulations in recent decades.
