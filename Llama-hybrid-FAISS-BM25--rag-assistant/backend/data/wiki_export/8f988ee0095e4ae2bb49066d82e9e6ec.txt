Early life
Tolib-khon Shakhidi began his musical career at the age of fourteen. He graduated from the Musical College in Dushanbe in 1965 from the Composition Class of Uri Ter-Osipov.

Career
From 1972 to this day, Tolib Shakhidi has participated in a number of music festivals.

"Taste, intellect, professionalism are the three main values of contemporary music" (). This aphorism, expressed by the composer fully complies with his own creative work. Tolib Shahidi represents a very rare type of Universal master-composer, who possesses the whole arsenal of contemporary musical language, yet uses the richest resources of traditional Eastern music of his region.
This twin pillar is not an obstacle, but the most important source of his artistic power and originality.

He won the 2008 Georges Delerue Award for his score of the film Two-Legged Horse.

Personal life
Tolibkhon Shakhidi is married to Gulsifat Shakhidi.
