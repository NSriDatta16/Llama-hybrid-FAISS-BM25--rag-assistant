Critical reception

The review published by Billboard in the March 18, 1972 issue said, "Miss Parton is currently enjoying a highly successful career and this LP will take her higher up the ladder as both a fine stylist and a superb songwriter. Produced by Bob
Ferguson, this terrific package is a showcase for the beautiful voice and writing talent of the lovely country girl. "Second Best", "Will He Be Waiting", "A Little at a Time", and the title tune, all penned by Miss Parton are highlights."

Cashbox published a review in the March 11, 1972 issue, which said, "Dolly Parton has a unique voice, partly because of its tone and partly because of the emotion she places behind her singing. On this LP of ten new cuts, she reaches new heights of emotion in both her singing and songwriting. Sticking to pure country music roots as far as song structure goes, Dolly however, shows a very progressive attitude when it comes to writing lyrics in tunes such as "The Greatest Days of All", "Second Best", "Will He Be Waiting", and "Mission Chapel Memories", the latter which was co-written with Porter Wagoner."
