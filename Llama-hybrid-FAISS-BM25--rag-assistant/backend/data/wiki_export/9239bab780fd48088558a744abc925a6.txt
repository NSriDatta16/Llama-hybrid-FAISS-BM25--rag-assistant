The zygomaticofacial nerve (or zygomaticofacial branch of zygomatic nerve or malar branch of zygomatic nerve) is a cutaneous (sensory) branch of the maxillary nerve (CN V2) that arises within the orbit. The zygomaticofacial nerve penetrates the inferolateral angle of the orbit, emerging into the face through the zygomaticofacial foramen, then penetrates the orbicularis oculi muscle to reach and innervate the skin of the prominence of the cheek.

Anatomy

Communications 
The zygomaticofacial nerve forms a nerve plexus with the zygomatic branches of facial nerve (CN VII), and the inferior palpebral branches of maxillary nerve (V2).

Variation 
The nerve may sometimes be absent.
