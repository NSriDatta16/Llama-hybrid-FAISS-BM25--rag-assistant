Through the rest of the week there was a heavy police presence at the school.
The Broward School District said more officers than usual were at the school Wednesday "as an extra precaution and deterrent to potential disruptions," spokeswoman Nadine Drew said. "The school operated its normal schedule of classes and activities today, without incident."

2017
On March 6, 2017, a violent fight broke out between students in the school's parking lot behind the cafeteria. A video shows a female student being dragged across a parking lot  by her hair, then being beaten by the other student, who punches her and kicks her in the head.

During the week of May 14 – May 20 during the 2016–2017 school year, the school received a series of gun threats and lock-downs.

2018
During the 2017–2018 school year, student Tyler Ahrens was arrested on Tuesday, April 4 for threatening to "shoot up" JP Taravella. Ahrens made posts on social media which read “I want to be a professional school shooter (no sarcasm, Broward County Florida) JP Taravella HS is my target tomorrow. I’M LEGIT NOT JOKING AROUND! SPREAD MY MESSAGE!!!!” and “For who ever is reading this, I will be shooting up my high school in Broward County FL. Tomorrow afternoon at 12:00 when school starts. Round 2.  JP Travels HS! (I am legit, make my presence known).” under the screen name "Sharp Shooter." This comes just two months after the deadly shooting at Taravella's sister school Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Ahrens pleaded not guilty on May 11, 2018, and remains on house arrest.

On October 2, 2018 during the 2018–2019 school year, JP Taravella's wrestling coach, Dustin Roy Garvin, was arrested for soliciting sexual acts with a minor online. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement conducted an undercover operation targeting J.P. Taravella High School assistant wrestling coach 32-year-old Dustin Roy Garvin on Aug. 30, 2017. Coral Springs Police, FBI and Broward Sheriff's Office officials took Garvin into custody at the school, Tuesday, after authorities said he had sexual conversations with an undercover agent who posed as the father of a 13-year-old boy. Officials said Garvin created a Craigslist ad under the username “Dirty Dusty” that solicited sexual favors from children. An undercover agent exchanged multiple conversations with Garvin in which, police said, he requested photos of the alleged boy. On October 3, 2018, Garvin was released on a $35,000 bond.
