Westmoor is a school which goes through preschool to 5th grade it located on cherry lane. It recently went under construction starting in 2014. The school first started resorting the 4-5th grade hall ways. In the summer of 2014 they repainted all the walls and removed all of the carpet. The reason for this is that the carpets were moldy and were going to cause a problem later on. Late 2014 westmoor's principal Dr. Finch announced that the school was going to remake the playground. The back of the school was still under construction. In result the school had to put fences for safety reasons. Middle of 2015 they removed half of the playground to make room for a spider web and spin top. Construction was finally finished the last week before the school year ended on June 5, 2015. A big edition to the school is the new preschool rooms on the east side of the school it used to be a kindergarten class's playground and classrooms. The kindergartens now have 2 rooms on another side of the building.
