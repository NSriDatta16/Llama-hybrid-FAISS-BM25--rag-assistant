Critical reception 
Robbert Tilli from Music & Media wrote, "Very reminiscent of one-time winner Bucks Fizz, the song is a typical example of a happy and cheerful first-prize tune."

Eurovision Song Contest 
Carola earned the right to represent Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest 1991 after convincingly winning Melodifestivalen 1991. Her entry received 78 points, 32 points more than the runner-up song "Ett liv med dej" by Towe Jaarnek.

At the Eurovision Song Contest 1991, which was held in Rome, Italy, Carola performed eighth, following 's Sarah Bray with "Un baiser volé", and preceding 's Amina with "C'est le dernier qui a parlé qui a raison". At the end of the voting procedure, Sweden and France had 146 points each, and had received the same number of twelve-point sets. However, Sweden was given the victory as it had received more ten-point votes than France, as that was the procedure at the time. That rule had been introduced in order to avoid a split victory, as it had happened at the Eurovision Song Contest 1969. The 1991 contest was the first and the last time that procedure was used.

Carola gave Sweden its third victory in the Eurovision Song Contest, following ABBA with "Waterloo" in  and Herreys with "Diggi-Loo Diggi-Ley" in . It was also the second time Carola represented Sweden in Eurovision: she had taken part in the 1983 contest with the song "Främling", which had finished third. She once again represented  in the Eurovision Song Contest 2006 with the song "Invincible", placing fifth.

Other versions 
In addition to the original Swedish-language version, Carola also recorded an English-language version of the song, "Captured by a Lovestorm", with the lyrics written by Richard Hampton. The remix of both versions, called "Hurricane Remix", was done by Emil Hellman.
