Ranni or Ranny is a town in the Pathanamthitta district of Kerala, India, and the 16th largest taluk (administrative division) in Kerala, located on both sides of the Pamba River. It Is located 27 km from Chengannur railway station & NH 183 in Chengannur.

Etymology 

The name Ranni is derived from a word in Malayalam which means "Queen", or Rani. The town is known as "The Queen of the Eastern Hill Lands" (മലനാടിന്റെ റാണി).

History 

The history of Ranni can be traced back 5000 years to the early settlement of Adi Dravidans around Sabarimala and Nilakkal. The temple at Sabarimala dates back 2000 years. The deity's sitting posture and resemblance of the prayer 'Sharanam vili' to "Buddham Sharanam / Sangam Sharanam" points to the area's Buddhist past. The word 'Ayya' is a Buddhist Pali word that means Lord/God. An ancient trade route used to pass through Nilackal between Kerala and the Pandian kingdom.

The former rulers of Ranni were known as the Ranni Karthas or the Karthkal of Ranni, the "Samanthas" and blood-related family of Thekkamamkoor Raja. In the 18th century, Anizham Thirunal Marthandavarma of Vennad annexed the Thekkamkoor kingdom and confiscated all the lands that belonged to the former rulers.

Ranni Karthas Kioyikal (the Ranni Karth palace) was located in Areekkal. The Ranni Karthas also built Ranni Manjor Ramapuram temple. The temple is the same architecturally as the Aranmula Sreeparthasaradhy temple but the darshan of the former faces south.

Ranni was a part of the Central Travancore region before the unification of India. Until the formation of Pathanamthitta district in 1982, Ranni was a part of the Kollam district.

Geography 

Ranni is located in southwestern India at . It has an average elevation of 131 m (433 ft) above sea level. However, towards the east, the elevation is much higher. The river Pamba flows through Ranni township. According to the 2001 Census of India, Ranni spans a total of . Out of the total area,  or 70% are forest.

Climate 

Like the rest of Kerala, Ranni has a wet and maritime tropical climate. The region receives most of the rain from the  southwest monsoon from June to August and the northeast monsoon during October and November. With river Pamba overflowing, Ranni is always under a threat of floods during Monsoons. Although the summer is from March to May, the area receives locally developed thundershowers in May. Due to the higher elevation, the climate is cooler in the east.

Demographics 

 Ranni taluk had a census population of 198,194, of which 94,773 were males and 103,421 were females. The female-to-male ratio is 1091:1000, higher than the state average and significantly higher than the national average. There were 53,172 households within the taluk's limits. A very low housing density is owed to a large reserved forest area. Ranni's literacy rate is 95%.

Although most of the residents are Malayalis there are some Tamil, Sikh, Bihari, and Bengali settlers. Much of the population are temporary workers who are employed in the construction sector. The population of migrant workers from the northern parts of India has increased over the last few years because of the shortage of local unskilled manpower. A few settlements of aborigines known as 'adivasis' are deep in the forest area.

Ranni's major religions are Hinduism and Christianity.
