Ten Bloody Marys & Ten How's Your Fathers is a compilation album by the English singer-songwriter Elvis Costello and his backing band the Attractions, comprising tracks not previously released on albums. It is largely made up of B-sides, but features three previously unreleased recordings. It was released only in the United Kingdom, initially only on cassette, though later in other formats.

Its track listing is very similar to that of the North America-released album Taking Liberties; the differences are that on the latter, the tracks "Watching The Detectives", "Radio, Radio" and "(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love and Understanding" are replaced by "Night Rally", "(I Don't Want to Go to) Chelsea" and "Sunday's Best".
