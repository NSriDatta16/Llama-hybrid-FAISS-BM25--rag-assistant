Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences 

The Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences (MCGSBS), established in 1989, offers Master's, Ph.D., and M.D.-Ph.D. (jointly with MCASOM) degrees in biomedical sciences.

Interschool programs 
The collegiate structure of the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science allows students to combine advanced training within the Mayo Clinic.

Medical Scientist Training Program (M.D.-Ph.D.) 
The Mayo Clinic M.D.-Ph.D. Program was established in 1986 and has been continuously funded by an NIH/NIGMS Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) T32 grant since 2003. It is a partnership between Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine and Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences that operates on a 2-4-2 model, where students earn their Ph.D. between medical school Years 2 and 3. MSTP students are able to take or test out of several graduate school classes during medical school Years 1 and 2. They also have the flexibility to complete medical school Year 3 clinical clerkships during their graduate school years if it works with their research schedule. For students who choose to focus exclusively on research during the graduate phase, a robust re-entry curriculum is provided to students as they transition back to medical school Year 3. The Mayo Clinic MSTP fully supports students through a guaranteed internal fellowship for up to four research years, eliminating the need for students to identify a faculty member to provide financial support.

Center for Clinical and Translational Science M.D.-M.S. Program 
The Mayo Clinic Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCaTS) offers the M.D.-M.S. dual degree through MCASOM and MCGSBS. The CCaTS program is open to medical students at MCASOM and the University of Puerto Rico School of Medicine. Competitive awards are available to cover program fees while also providing a stipend and support for research expenses.

Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Residency (M.D.-O.M.S.) 
The Mayo Clinic Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery residency (M.D.-O.M.S.) is a 6-year joint offering of MCASOM and Mayo Clinic School of Graduate Medical Education in which dentists earn their M.D. degrees during surgical training.

History 
The Mayo Clinic has a long history of medical education, and was a pioneer in postgraduate education for physicians.

The first medical educational programs at the Mayo Clinic were developed in 1915 with the assistance of the University of Minnesota. The two institutions held close relationships in the early 20th century. William James Mayo was a Regent of the University of Minnesota and his brother Charles Horace Mayo was a professor of surgery at the University of Minnesota Medical School. In its early years, the Mayo Clinic was operated as a for-profit hospital and could not affiliate with the university.

This led to the creation of the Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER) in 1915. MFMER was established as a department of the University of Minnesota with a $1.5 million donation to offer graduate programs at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester. During the same time period, the Mayo brothers created the Mayo Properties Association which converted the Mayo Clinic into a non-profit association practice. Mayo Properties Association later became the Mayo Foundation. These steps led to the university and Mayo Clinic to enter into an affiliation and teaching agreement. The curriculum during this period focused on the development of medical specialists during a time when the medical field was becoming further professionalized.

Location 
The Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science is based in Rochester, Minnesota, with additional campuses in Phoenix and Scottsdale, Arizona, and Jacksonville, Florida.
