Reception
According to David Jason's biographers, Edgar Briggs  was not a ratings success in Britain but proved popular in overseas markets. Nevertheless, Jason reportedly vetoed repeat screenings of the series for many years on the grounds that he "[knew] how raw he looked in those days" and was "not at all anxious to share that with his public."

DVD release
The complete series was eventually released on DVD in March 2015.
