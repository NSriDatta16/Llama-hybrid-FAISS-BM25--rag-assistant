The masseteric nerve is a nerve of the face. It is a branch of the mandibular nerve (CN V3). It passes through the mandibular notch to reach masseter muscle. It provides motor innervation the masseter muscle, and sensory innervation to the temporomandibular joint.

Structure

Origin 
The masseteric nerve is a branch of (the anterior division of) the mandibular nerve (CN V3) (itself a branch of the trigeminal nerve (CN V)).

Course 
It passes laterally superior to the lateral pterygoid muscle, anterior to the temporomandibular joint, and posterior to the tendon of the temporalis muscle. It crosses (the posterior portion of) the mandibular notch alongside the masseteric artery before branching out upon the surface of the masseter muscle, then entering the muscle.

Distribution 
The masseteric nerve provides motor innervation the masseter muscle. It additionally sends articular (sensory) branches to the temporomandibular joint.

Clinical significance 
The masseteric nerve may be harvested and used to repair paralysis of the facial nerve (CN VII).
