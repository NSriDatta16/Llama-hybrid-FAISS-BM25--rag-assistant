The pilot was not picked up for series by The CW network, a result of The WB and UPN network merger, which occurred while the pilot was being filmed. She appeared as Kara/Lindsay Harrison in the season 3 finale of Smallville. Palicki appeared in Supernatural as Jessica Moore, Sam Winchester's doomed girlfriend who is killed by a demon in its pilot episode.
