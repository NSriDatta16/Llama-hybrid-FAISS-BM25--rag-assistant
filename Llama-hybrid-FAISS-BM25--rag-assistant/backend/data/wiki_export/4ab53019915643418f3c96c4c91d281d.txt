Iowa Highway 136 (Iowa 136) is a state highway maintained by the Iowa Department of Transportation. It runs for  in eastern Iowa. It begins at the Mississippi River in Clinton on the Mark Morris Memorial Bridge, where it continues as Illinois Route 136. It ends at an interchange with U.S. Highway 20 (US 20) and US 52 in Dyersville. Although signed as a north–south highway throughout, the highway runs east to west between Clinton and Oxford Junction, while turning north at Oxford Junction to complete its run to Dyersville. For most of its existence, Iowa 136 connected Clinton and Luxemburg. During the 1950s-1960s, the northern and southern ends of the route shifted slightly because nearby United States highways changed their alignments. The northern end of Iowa 136 shifted again in early 2022.

History
In 1926, when Primary Road No. 20 (PR 20) was renamed U.S. Highway 61, Primary Road No. 61, which connected Clinton to US 61 west of Delmar, was renumbered Primary Road No. 136. In 1930, Iowa Iowa 136 had been extended west and north to what is now Iowa 64, replacing Iowa 153. Iowa 136 extended north to Onslow in 1931, and to Cascade in 1935. In 1938, Iowa 136 had been extended to Luxemburg, replacing Iowa 188. By 1947, only the PR 61 section of road and another section between Wyoming and Oxford Junction had been paved. In Clinton, Iowa 136 originally began at the N. Third Street intersection with U.S. Highway 67. After U.S. Highway 30 was rerouted over the Gateway Bridge in 1955, Iowa 136 was extended to cross the Mississippi River over the Lyons-Fulton Bridge. A year later, an Alternate U.S. Route 30 was designated over the old alignment of US 30 through Clinton, and Iowa 136 was pulled back to its old end. In 1967, the Alternate US 30 designation was dropped and Iowa 136 again crossed the river.

From 1963 to 1967, U.S. Highway 52 was realigned from Dubuque to Luxemburg to follow U.S. Highway 20 to Dyersville and Iowa 136 to Luxemburg while its original alignment was rebuilt. During this time, Iowa 136 was truncated back to US 20 at Dyersville, but it was redesignated along this segment after US 52 returned to its old alignment. In December 2021, the Iowa Department of Transportation notified Dubuque county that it was removing the Iowa 136 designation from U.S. 52 between Iowa 3 in Luxemburg and U.S. 20 in Dyersville.
