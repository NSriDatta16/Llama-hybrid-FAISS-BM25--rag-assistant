Coquitlam Central station is an intermodal rapid transit station in Metro Vancouver served by both the Millennium Line—part of the SkyTrain system—and the region's West Coast Express commuter rail system. The station is located on the north side of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) tracks in Coquitlam, just west of the Lougheed Highway rail overpass, near the Coquitlam Centre shopping mall. 601 parking spaces are available on site. All services are operated by TransLink.

On December 2, 2016, the Millennium Line's Evergreen Extension entered revenue service at the station, providing service to VCC–Clark in Vancouver and Lafarge Lake–Douglas in Coquitlam.

History
The Canadian Pacific Railway brought the first passenger train service to the area in the 1880s, with the first permanent station built at Fraser Mills in 1910, on the branch line to New Westminster. The train was a vital factor in bringing new settlement, including loggers and their families, into the Coquitlam area.

The area around Coquitlam Central station has been an important focal point for bus services since August 15, 1979, when bus services were rerouted to serve Coquitlam Centre shopping mall. During this period, buses converged along Pinetree Way north of the intersection of Lougheed and Barnet Highway. On September 2, 1991, a new bus exchange known as "Coquitlam Centre Transit Exchange" opened on the southwest corner of the intersection, in roughly the same location as the current exchange, which was rebuilt during construction of the adjacent West Coast Express station. Before the Evergreen Extension was opened, the bus exchange was known as "Coquitlam Station".

The train station opened in 1995, when the West Coast Express began operating, connecting Vancouver with Mission. The West Coast Express platform is located on the south side of the CPR tracks, accessed via a pedestrian tunnel.
