Montclair Kimberley Academy (MKA) is a co-educational private school for students in pre-kindergarten through twelfth grade located in Montclair in Essex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. One of New Jersey's largest independent day schools, Montclair Kimberley Academy  celebrated the 125th anniversary of the establishment of its earliest component school in 2012. The current school, established in 1974, is the result of the merger of three separate schools: Montclair Academy, a boys' school founded in 1887; The Kimberley School, a girls' school founded in 1906; and Brookside, a coed school founded in 1925.

As of the 2019–20 school year, the school had an enrollment of 1,012 students (plus 36 in PreK) and 168.5 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 6:1.
