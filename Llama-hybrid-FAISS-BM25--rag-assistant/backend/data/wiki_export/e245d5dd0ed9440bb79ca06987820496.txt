is a Japanese actor, singer, and model from Nagoya, Japan. When he was still in high school, he was discovered by a talent agent while out shopping with friends. He made his debut in the drama Am I Weird? (私ってへん？ Watashitte Hen?) in 1998. Tamaki became better known with his appearance in the 2001 film Waterboys.

His singing career started with the single "Seasons" in the summer of 2004.

He was cast as Shinichi Chiaki in the drama Nodame Cantabile, which aired in Japan on Fuji TV on 16 October 2006. The drama was a hit, and he became most known for this role.

He starred in the revival of the Iron Chef Japanese cooking show on Fuji TV in October 2012, portraying the chairman of the Kitchen Stadium.

He also lent his voice to dub Western productions; for example he voiced Owen Grady (played by Chris Pratt) in the Jurassic World film series and Alex the Lion (original voice: Ben Stiller) in the Madagascar animated film series.
