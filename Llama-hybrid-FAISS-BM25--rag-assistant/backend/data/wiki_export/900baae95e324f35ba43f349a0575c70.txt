Over the course of several years, the school district has infused Common Core into their curriculum. Whether or not a student is in a Common Core class or must take a Common Core standardized test mostly depends on which exam it is and the student's grade level. Students may even be required to take both the Common Core and the original version of an exam. The reason for this is because the integration is not yet completed. A NewsDay survey found that 40% of students in the William Floyd School District have opted out of the English and Mathematics common core exams.
