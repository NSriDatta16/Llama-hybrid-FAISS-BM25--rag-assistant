History

The settlement began in the early 1940s along the road linking Jaraguá to the Colônia Nacional Agrícola de Goiás, present-day Ceres near an airstrip.  The first houses served as a resting place for travelers between the two towns.  Soon there was a store and a small hotel.  The settlement was first called "Campo de Aviação", after the landing strip.  In 1958 it became a municipality taking the name of Rianápols, because of its location between the towns of Rialma and Anápolis
