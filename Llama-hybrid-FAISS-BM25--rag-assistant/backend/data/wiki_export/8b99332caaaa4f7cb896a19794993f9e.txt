Death
Brown died on July 2, 2014. In February 2011, he was diagnosed with liposarcoma and had a ten-pound tumor removed from his abdomen. Brown resumed his poker career despite having the rare cancer, only slowing down when he was no longer physically able to compete. Just prior to his death, the World Series of Poker honored him by awarding him an honorary bracelet for his achievements in poker, but Brown was unable to make the ceremony due to his condition. He died in hospice care at Calvary Hospital in his native New York at the age of 52 with his fiancée Stephanie Donahue by his side.
