History

The De La Salle Medical and Health Sciences Institute was started by a group of doctors from the College of Medicine of the University of the Philippines and the Philippine General Hospital who, in 1976, decided to establish a medical school to support the need for a well-trained staff for the newly inaugurated Medical Center Manila. Following the national government's policy of dispersing educational facilities outside the capital city and encouraging the establishment of medical schools in various regions of the country, they decided to establish a medical school in Dasmariñas, Cavite. Originally named Emilio Aguinaldo College of Medicine, the school opened in 1979 under the management of the University Physician’s Foundation, Inc. with the Jose P. Rizal National Medical Research Center as its initial teaching hospital. Then on July 31, 1982, the Foundation inaugurated a 4-story 180-bed teaching hospital, the University Medical Center.

In June 1987, ownership and management were acquired by De La Salle University Inc. In 1992, the college was renamed the De La Salle University College of Medicine, and the hospital, the De La Salle University Medical Center. In June 1994, the management of the College of Physical Therapy which was then part of DLSU-Aguinaldo (now DLSU-D) was turned over to the De La Salle University College of Medicine. By June 1995, the complex consisting of the College of Medicine, University Medical Center, College of Physical Therapy, and Research Services was named De La Salle University – Health Sciences Campus or DLSU-HSC under the ownership and administration of the Saint Br. Miguel Febres Cordero Medical Education Foundation.

In May 2000, the colleges under the administration of the DLSU-Health Sciences Campus increased with the transfer of the Colleges of Medical Radiation Technology and Nursing & Midwifery (formerly under DLSU-D). Eventually, the institution’s name became De La Salle Health Sciences Institute upon approval of the board of trustees in September 2007.

In 2014, the institute started to admit students in its pharmacy and medical laboratory science programs.

In January 2018, the term “Medical” was included in the institution's name as granted by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

In October 2019, DLSMHSI became an official member of the ASEAN University Network-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) as confirmed by Banjong Ujjin, the Senior Programme Officer of the AUN Secretariat Team. During this month, institute also broke ground on its new grandstand to be located in its newly-acquired Annexed Property. 

On October 25, 2019, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED), granted autonomous status to DLSMHSI through the CHED Memorandum Order No. 12, series of 2019. This means that the institution can enjoy a lot of benefits including being allowed to launch new courses/programs in the undergraduate and/or graduate levels including doctoral programs in areas of expertise without securing a permit/authority from CHED; only informing them of the programs to be offered. 

On August 11, 2020, DLSMHSI announced the offering of a master's degree in public health for the school year 2020–2021. In 2022, the College of Dentistry opened.
