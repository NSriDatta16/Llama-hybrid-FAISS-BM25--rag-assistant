The All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (ACFIC; ), also called the All-China Chamber of Industry and Commerce (ACCIC; ) is a people's organization and chamber of commerce, established in 1953 as a successor to the chambers of commerce that were first founded during the Qing dynasty.

Today, it consists of Chinese industrialists and business people under the leadership of the United Front Work Department of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), as well as being a constituent organization of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and the holder of a number of seats in the National People's Congress. The organization assists the government in managing China's private sector economy and acts as a bridge between the private sector entities and the government.

History 

From November 2002 to 2012, the ACFIC had been led by Chairman Huang Mengfu (), who, like his predecessors, was also a vice chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee, ranking as a national leader of China. His predecessor was Jing Shuping, founder of the first private bank in modern China and the son of a well-known entrepreneur of the late Qing Dynasty.

The first vice-chairman of the ACFIC is Quan Zhezhu (), a deputy minister of the United Front Department originally from Jilin. The ACFIC has another 23 vice-chairpersons, most of them private entrepreneurs.

Organization
The ACFIC is led by a ministerial-level CCP secretary and chairman. The chairman has usually been a member of the China National Democratic Construction Association, also serving as a vice chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. The ACFIC is a constituent of the CPPCC and is allocated seats to the NPC.

More than 3,000 regional federations of industry and commerce (FIC) have been established in all provinces and prefectures and most counties of China. The relationship between ACFIC and the regional FIC is described as a role of guidance, but the statute of ACFIC is also valid for the regional federations.

In September 2020, the CCP announced that it would establish more party committees in regional FICs, and would arrange a special liaison between them and the CCP.
