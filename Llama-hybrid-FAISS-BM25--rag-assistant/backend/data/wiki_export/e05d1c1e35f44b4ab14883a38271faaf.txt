The Amphibious Corps (, Amf) is the maritime land force arm of the Swedish Navy, with an emphasis on coastal defence. Until 2000 it was known as the Coastal Artillery (), but the name was changed to reflect its different role in a post-Cold War world, where its amphibious special operations arm, Kustjägarna, has grown in significance while its coastal batteries have been decommissioned.
