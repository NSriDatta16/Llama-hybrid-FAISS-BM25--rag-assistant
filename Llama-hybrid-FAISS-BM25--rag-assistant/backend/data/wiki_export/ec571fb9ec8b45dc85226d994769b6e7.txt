History
The State of Miraj, the predecessor state, was founded before 1750 and within its limits was the former capital of the State of Sangli before the British Raj.
Raja Govind Rao Patwardhan, 1st Ruler of Miraj, began as a cavalry commander. He distinguished himself in several expeditions against the Nizam of Hyderabad and Hyder Ali of Mysore, established the Maratha ascendancy in southern India and pushed the Maratha conquests to the frontier of Mysore.

In 1820, the state of Miraj was divided between a Senior and Junior branch. The territory of both branches was widely scattered among other native states and also British districts.

Miraj Junior acceded to the Dominion of India on 8 March 1948 and is currently a part of Maharashtra state.
