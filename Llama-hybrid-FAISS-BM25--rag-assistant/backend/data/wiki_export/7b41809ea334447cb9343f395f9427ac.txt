Bitch Magnet was an American post-hardcore band who formed in 1986 at Oberlin College in Ohio and later moved to North Carolina, United States. They released their first record in 1988. All of the band's albums were released on Communion Records in the US; they were also signed to the European labels Shigaku/What Goes On and Glitterhouse. The band disbanded in 1991.

On March 31, 2011, Bitch Magnet announced that the line-up of Fine, Morfin and Park - the band's original recorded line-up - would reunite to perform at the All Tomorrow's Parties festival "Nightmare Before Christmas," held in the UK in December 2011. In addition to performing at ATP, the band also played shows in London, Brussels, Cologne and in the Netherlands at Groningen's Vera club. The band played its first reunion shows in Asia in November 2011, in Seoul and Tokyo. In the spring of 2012 Bitch Magnet played additional shows in Tokyo, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Manila. It concluded its reunion with a tour of America in autumn, 2012, performing in Seattle, San Francisco, two shows in New York, and its final show in Chicago, at the Empty Bottle.

Bitch Magnet's three albums were reissued on December 6, 2011 by Temporary Residence Limited, as a deluxe limited-edition triple-LP set and as a triple CD. The reissues include non-LP tracks and previously unreleased recordings that were remixed with John Congleton in late 2010.
