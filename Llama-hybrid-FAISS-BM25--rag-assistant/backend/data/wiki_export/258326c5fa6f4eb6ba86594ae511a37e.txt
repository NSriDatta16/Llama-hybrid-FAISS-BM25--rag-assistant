Professional career

Philadelphia Eagles
Jean-Gilles was chosen in the fourth round with the 99th overall pick by the Philadelphia Eagles. Many people did expect him to go higher because of his athleticism and playing ability, but his inability to control his weight might have played into that decision. He and offensive tackle Winston Justice, who was drafted in the second round also by the Eagles, were supposed to have helped with the rebuilding process of the offensive line. On July 10, 2006, Jean-Gilles signed a four-year contract with the Eagles.

On September 23, 2007, Jean-Gilles made his regular season debut for the Eagles, subbing in for an injured Shawn Andrews.

Jean-Gilles' 2008 season was cut short on Thanksgiving night against the Arizona Cardinals when he fractured his ankle and was placed on injured reserve.

During the 2009 season, after a knee injury to starting center Jamaal Jackson in Week 16 against the Denver Broncos, starting right guard Nick Cole shifted over to center, while Jean-Gilles came in at right guard for the rest of the game. With Jackson out for the year with a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), Jean-Gilles would continue to start at right guard for the rest of the year.

He was re-signed to a one-year contract on April 15, 2010. Due to the Eagles not making the roster deadline during final cuts because of a trade, Jean-Gilles had to be released in order to meet the roster requirement on September 4. He was re-signed on September 5.

Cincinnati Bengals
On August 2, 2011, Jean-Gilles signed a one-year contract with the Cincinnati Bengals, but was released on September 3.

Personal life
Jean-Gilles' parents immigrated to the United States from Haiti in the  early 1980s. He has a son, Marcus.  Jean-Gilles underwent lap-band surgery in May 2010 in order to lose weight. It was reported that he weighed about  during the offseason. He had hoped to get down to about  by the start of the 2010 season.
