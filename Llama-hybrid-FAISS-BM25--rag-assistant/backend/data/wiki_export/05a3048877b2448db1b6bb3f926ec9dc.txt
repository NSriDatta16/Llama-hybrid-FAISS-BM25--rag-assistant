Ossau-Iraty is an Occitan-Basque cheese made from sheep milk.

Origin
Ossau-Iraty or Esquirrou is produced in south-western France, in the Northern Basque Country and in Béarn. Its name reflects its geographical location, the Ossau Valley in Béarn and the Irati Forest in the Basque Country.

AOC status
It has been recognized as an appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) product since 1980. It is one of three sheep's milk cheeses granted AOC status in France (the others are  Roquefort and Brocciu). It is of ancient origin, traditionally made by the shepherds in the region.

Production
Production techniques are very much in the essence of old world methods whereby the sheep still graze mountain pastures. The milk must come from the breeds Basco-béarnaise, Red-face Manech, or Black-face Manech. This is an uncooked cheese made through pressing. When offered as a farm-produced cheese (known as fromage fermier, fromage de ferme or produit fermier) the AOC regulations stipulate that only raw, unpasteurized milk be used.

 3,067 tonnes (in 2003)
