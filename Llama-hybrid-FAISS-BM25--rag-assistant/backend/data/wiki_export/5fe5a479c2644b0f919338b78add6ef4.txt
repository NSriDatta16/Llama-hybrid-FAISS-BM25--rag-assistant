Global International Airways (also known as GIA) was an American charter airline company based in Kansas City, Missouri.

History
Global International began seasonal flights to Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London and Paris using the Boeing 707 in 1981. Global also used Boeing 727s for charters to the Caribbean as well as a leased Boeing 747-100. It was financed by a number of unsecured loans totaling $600,000 from the Indian Springs State Bank, at the instigation of Farhad Azima. Global International filed for bankruptcy in 1983, its bad loans being a major factor in the closing of Indian Springs a year later in 1984.
