History 
The Escuela Naval del Perú has its precedents in the Escuela Náutica (Nautical School) established at Lima by Viceroy Luis Enríquez de Guzmán, Count of Alba de Liste in 1657. This institution closed in 1709 and was superseded by the Academia Real Náutica de Lima (Royal Nautical Academy of Lima) which opened its doors in 1794 under the sponsorship of Viceroy Francisco Gil de Taboada y Lemos. The Academy was closed by the War of Independence in July, 1821 but it was reopened in November 1821 as Escuela Central de Marina (Central Naval School). During the 19th century the School changed locations several times until its closure at the outbreak of the War of the Pacific (1879–1883). Labors resumed in 1888 as Escuela Naval but a permanent location was not obtained until 1915 when the construction of the current campus at La Punta ended. In 1921 the school received its actual name "Escuela Naval del Perú" Installations were destroyed by an earthquake in 1974, the rebuilding process lasted up to 1981. Admission for women at the school has been allowed since 1998.
