In category theory, a branch of mathematics, the diagonal functor  is given by , which maps objects as well as morphisms.  This functor can be employed to give a succinct alternate description of the product of objects within the category : a product  is a universal arrow from  to .  The arrow comprises the projection maps.

More generally, given a  small index category , one may construct the functor category , the objects of which are called diagrams. For each object  in , there is a constant diagram  that maps every object in  to  and every morphism in  to . The diagonal functor  assigns to each object  of  the diagram , and to each morphism  in  the natural transformation  in  (given for every object  of  by ).  Thus, for example, in the case that  is a discrete category with two objects, the diagonal functor  is recovered.

Diagonal functors provide a way to define limits and colimits of diagrams. Given a diagram , a natural transformation  (for some object  of ) is called a cone for . These cones and their factorizations correspond precisely to the objects and morphisms of the comma category , and a limit of  is a terminal object in , i.e., a universal arrow . Dually, a colimit of  is an initial object in the comma category , i.e., a universal arrow .

If every functor from  to  has a limit (which will be the case if  is complete), then the operation of taking limits is itself a functor from  to .  The limit functor is the right-adjoint of the diagonal functor.  Similarly, the colimit functor (which exists if the category is cocomplete) is the left-adjoint of the diagonal functor. For example, the diagonal functor  described above is the left-adjoint of the binary product functor and the right-adjoint of the binary coproduct functor.
