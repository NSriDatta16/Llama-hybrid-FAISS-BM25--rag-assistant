Shields is the coauthor (with Jerry A. Shields, her husband) of a number of texts including: Atlas of Orbital Tumors, Atlas of Intraocular Tumors, and Atlas of Eyelid and Conjunctival Tumors.  She is also co- editor of a comprehensive book entitled, "Retinoblastoma", published recently.

Currently, Shields and her husband Dr. Jerry A. Shields head up the oncology department at the Wills Eye Hospital.  Located in Philadelphia, the Wills Eye Hospital sees at least 50% of the 300 children diagnosed with retinoblastoma each year and at least 1/3 of the adults diagnosed with ocular melanoma in the USA.

There have been only two "Top 100" Power Lists – she was on both. She is also the recipient of the Donders Award (2003) given by the Netherlands Ophthalmological Society every 5 years to an ophthalmologist worldwide who has contributed extensively to the field of ophthalmology.
