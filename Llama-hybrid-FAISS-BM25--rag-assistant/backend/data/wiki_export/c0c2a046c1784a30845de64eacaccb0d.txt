She was featured in such Thanhouser Film Corporation's films as The World and the Woman (1916) with Jeanne Eagels; and Always in the Way (1915) with Mary Miles Minter and Charlotte Shelby. In 1917 Oakland appeared with Jack Pickford in The Dummy produced by Famous Players–Lasky. In 1917, Oakland played the leading role in The Little Rebel.
