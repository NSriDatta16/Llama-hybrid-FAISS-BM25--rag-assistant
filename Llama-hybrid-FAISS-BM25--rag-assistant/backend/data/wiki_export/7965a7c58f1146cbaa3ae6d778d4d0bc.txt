The Fayetteville-Manlius Central School District (F-M) is a K-12 public school district located in the Town of Manlius in Central New York, enrolling approximately 4,800 students. F-M serves a large portion of the Town of Manlius, including the villages of Manlius and Fayetteville, as well as portions of Jamesville and Pompey. The district is partially funded by and governed under the authority of the New York State Education Department, whose standardized examinations are designed and administered by the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York.

The district has been recognized statewide and nationally for academic and athletic excellence. In 2015, the high school was ranked #79 in the nation in Newsweek's list of "America's Top High Schools". As of 2019, Fayetteville-Manlius Senior High School was ranked #86 within New York State.

District history

Establishing the district
The F-M School District was established in 1951, when the then independent Fayetteville, Manlius and 11 other smaller districts united. Fayetteville High School and Manlius High School remained separate until 1954, when the Manlius School became the Jr. High (7–8) for the whole district and the Fayetteville school became the Fayetteville-Manlius High School (9–12). The new Fayetteville–Manlius High School was constructed in Manlius and first opened in 1960. The former Fayetteville-Manlius High School was renamed to the current Wellwood Middle School in 1965. Manlius High School became Pleasant Street Elementary, which was closed in 1975, sold and is currently a church and daycare. From the time it was formed until the present, the district has been led by only five superintendents.

The Oak Tree and the Hornet

The oak tree is the symbol of the F-M School District and its heritage. A 200-year-old oak stood in front of what is now Wellwood Middle School until it was removed in the 1970s. The characteristics of the tree are reflected in the values, vision, and ambition of Fayetteville-Manlius. The tree is a steadfast, well-grounded, robust, and distinguished entity on the natural landscape. The hornet is the school mascot, and also came from the hornets who nested in the great oak tree. A historical narrative is given by former teacher and assistant principal at F-M High School, Mr. Platt Wheeler:

Many teams also have modified, freshman and junior varsity components.

In recent years, F-M has made a significant statement on the national stage in boys' tennis, running, girls' lacrosse, and boys' soccer. The district is home to the boys' tennis team, which is undefeated for over 20 years, with over 200 consecutive wins. The girls' cross-country team finished first eleven times and runner-up once at the Nike Cross Nationals between 2006-2017. Additionally, the boys' cross-country team finished first once (2014) and runner-up three times (2004, 2010, and 2017) at the same event. The 2020 boys' soccer team finished with a record of 11–0 and was ranked 3rd in the nation by the United Soccer Coaches, but sectional and state playoffs were cancelled due to Covid. A wide variety of teams claim OHSL and NYSPHSAA Section III championships every year, and most teams are honored with NYS Scholar Athlete Awards.

Alma mater
