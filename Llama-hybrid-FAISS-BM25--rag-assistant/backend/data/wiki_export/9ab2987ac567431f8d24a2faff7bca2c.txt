Lyle Neff (born 1969) is a Canadian poet and journalist in Vancouver, British Columbia.

Born in Prince George, British Columbia, he is the author of three books of poetry published by Anvil Press. He has also written scattered essays, cultural journalism and literary criticism for various Canadian publications, ranging from the national newspaper The Globe and Mail to such obscure literary journals as Sub-Terrain.

Notorious for his hotheaded nationalism and elaborate use of profanity, Neff elaborated in 2003 his controversial Three Laws of Honest Dominion Belletrism, a sort of code for Canadian writers. The Laws, as published in Monarchist magazine, went as follows: 
1. Don't ask for subsidies from the Canadian people. 
2. Don't teach. 
3. Don't work for Americans.
