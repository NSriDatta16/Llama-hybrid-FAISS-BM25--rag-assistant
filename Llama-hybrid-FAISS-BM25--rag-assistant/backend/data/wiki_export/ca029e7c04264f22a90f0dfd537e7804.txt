The Tampere Film Festival () is a short film festival held every March, mostly at the Finnkino Plevna movie theatre, in Tampere, Finland. It is accredited by the film producers' society FIAPF, and together with the short film festivals in Oberhausen and Clermont-Ferrand, it is among the most important European short film festivals.

The first festival was held in 1969. Since 1970, it has been held in its current form, which makes it the oldest short film festival in Northern Europe. Approximately 500 short films are screened during the five days of the festival each year.

On December 15, 2020, it was announced that the Tampere Film Festival will open a new international short film competition called Generation XYZ for 2021, which has been developed in cooperation with an American film production company XYZ Films. Selected films will be showcased at the 2021 Tampere Film Festival and judged by an independent jury, and the winning film will be given a prize in the amount of €2,000.
