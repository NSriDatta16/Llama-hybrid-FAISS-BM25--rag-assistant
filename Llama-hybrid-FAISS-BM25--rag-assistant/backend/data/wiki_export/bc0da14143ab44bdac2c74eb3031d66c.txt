History
The Cégep régional de Lanaudière was founded in 1998 to provide accessible college-level education as well as continuing education opportunities to the  Lanaudière region's youth and adult population as well as its business communities.

The Cégep is unique in that the constituent colleges in Joliette, L'Assomption, and Terrebonne each have their own offices and they also share resources and services offered by the administration centre at Repentigny.

Each college has its own mission. Academic and student life reflect the values, the culture, and the traditions of those who built it and who continue its development.

Programs
The CEGEP offers two types of programs: pre-university and technical. The pre-university programs, which take two years to complete, cover the subject matters which roughly correspond to the additional year of high school given elsewhere in Canada in preparation for a chosen field in university. The technical programs, which take three years to complete, applies to students who wish to pursue a skill trade. Continuing education and services to business are provided.

Governance model
The mission of the regional Cégep is to organize the college-level general and vocational instruction offered through its constituent colleges, in a way that allows them to cooperate with one another. As stated by the General and Vocational Colleges Act, these constituent colleges are responsible for implementing programs of college study assigned to them by the regional college, while contributing to the social and cultural development of the region they serve.

Since their establishment, the three constituent colleges have developed their own educational vision and assessment and evaluation policies. Each constituent college also has its own board of governors, academic departments, and programme committees that focus on the needs of their students and respective communities. In other words, even though they're part of a regional college, the constituent colleges have their own educational autonomy.

On a local scale, each constituent college has its own programs of study as well as cultural and sporting activities for students. The facilities of each constituent college address the needs of the regional community.
