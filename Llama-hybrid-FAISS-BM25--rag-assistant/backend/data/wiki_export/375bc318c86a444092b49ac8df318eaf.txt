The Hillsborough District Brigade of militia was an administrative division of the North Carolina militia established on May 4, 1776.  Brigadier General Thomas Person was the first commander.  Companies from the eight regiments of the brigade were engaged in 55 known battles and skirmishes in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia during the American Revolutionary War. It was active until the end of the war.

Background
In 1766, the Province of North Carolina House of Burgess, at the direction of Province of North Carolina Governor William Tryon, divided the state into six judicial districts.  The districts did not do away with the county divisions of the state, which continued.

Within the Hillsborough District in 1775 were the counties of Caswell, Chatham, Granville, Orange, Randolph (added in 1779), and Wake.

At the outbreak of the Revolutionary War, the newly formed North Carolina government converted the state's six existing judicial districts into military districts.  These districts each comprised a number of counties surrounding a significant town. The six districts, which corresponded with old judicial organizations, were: Edenton, New Bern, Wilmington, Halifax, Salisbury, and Hillsborough.  Each district was to supply a brigade of militia regiments under the command of a brigadier general.

After the Third North Carolina Provincial Congress held at Hillsborough (August 20 â€“ September 10, 1775), the districts became known as "military" vice "judicial" districts. These districts were used to organize the North Carolina Minutemen battalions for a six-month trial as state troops, beginning on September 1, 1775. By April 10, 1776, the Provincial Congress decided in favor of district brigades of militia with county militia regiments.  Each brigade was led by a brigadier general. The county militia regiments were subordinated to the brigade.  At that time, two additional districts were added, further dividing the western part of the state (Washington District Regiment in 1776 and Morgan District in 1784). Also, district representatives were chosen and sent to the North Carolina Provincial Congress. These representatives were instrumental in the passage of the Halifax Resolves, in April 1776, during the Fourth Provincial Congress, which is now often referred to as the "Halifax Congress".

Brigade history
The Hillsborough District Brigade was established on May 4, 1776.

As the militia had a poor reputation for turning out, bounties to induce volunteerism were common during the war. For men who chose not to serve when drafted, there were two options: pay for a substitute to take their place or pay a fine. These options, with some modifications, remained throughout the war.

Brigadier General Thomas Person was appointed the first commander of the Hillsborough District Brigade in 1776.  During the 1781 Battle of Guilford Court House, the Hillsborough District was commanded by John Butler.

Each county supplied a regiment (Orange County supplied two regiments), which in turn was composed of various companies. Each company consisted of no less than 50 men and was further divided into five "divisions." One of the five divisions was reserved for "the more aged and infirm men." The other four divisions, of each company, drew lots to determine the rotation they would follow for their tour of service, which usually lasted for three months. Eventually the "fifth division" of "aged and infirm men" was dropped, as was the maximum age limit from 60 to 50. In order to provide a greater pool of available manpower, the old colonial militia exemption list was revised.

Commanders of the Hillsborough District Brigade and their length of service are as follows:
 Brigadier General Thomas Person (1776-1777)
 Brigadier General John Butler (1777-1783)
 Brigadier General Ambrose Ramsey (Pro Tempore) (March 15, 1781)

Regiments
