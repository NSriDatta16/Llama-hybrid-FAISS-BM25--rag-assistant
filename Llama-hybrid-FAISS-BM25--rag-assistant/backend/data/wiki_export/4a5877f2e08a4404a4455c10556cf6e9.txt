Synopsis
Tony is on the Asbury Park boardwalk, where he is going to meet Paulie. While waiting, he remembers another meeting there five years ago, in 1995, with Pussy and Jackie Aprile, Sr. At the time there was a dispute between Jackie and Junior, and Pussy had been in Boca Raton, Florida arranging a sitdown. However, Pussy did not go to the sitdown, and Tony thinks that was when the FBI flipped him; he believes they had him wear a wire when he dressed up as Santa. Now they need a new Santa and Bobby is compelled to play the part. He is shy, unhappy, and gauche.

When Tony is visiting Janice she starts complaining about a pain in her wrist, which might need an operation, caused by the Russian thug who came to take back Svetlana's prosthetic leg. Tony obtains his name and place of work, and he and Furio beat him up and throw him through the glass window of a store's Christmas display. Though badly shaken at first when she sees on TV what Tony has done, Janice is also grateful, and immediately wants to write a song about brotherhood.

Charmaine, newly separated from Artie, looks glamorous at Nuovo Vesuvio. Tony compliments her, but she responds by blaming him for changes in Artie's character. He angrily walks out, along with Christopher and Silvio. They go to a strip club. Jackie Jr. is there, getting a lap dance.  Enraged, Tony takes him to the bathroom and beats him up. He confiscates the gun Ralphie gave him, and knees him in the groin, leaving him on the floor.

On Christmas morning, the Sopranos are opening their gifts when Jackie arrives with presents from his mother, and his own present for  Meadow, an engraved necklace. She ostentatiously embraces and kisses him, while he glances at Tony. Alone with Tony, Jackie tells him he has flunked out of Rutgers but believes he can be a serious student of men's fashion. He says, "I'm sorry," again and again. Tony says, "I haven't decided what to do with you."  After Jackie leaves, Tony has to fake amusement when Meadow gives him her present, a Big Mouth Billy Bass.
