Aside from a few guitar instrumentals written in the early days of the band and collective co-writing credits, the song is  Wilson's first solo composition, and he plays all of the instruments himself.

Release
The song was first released as a single in May 1971, and did not chart. It was then included on Surf's Up, and was re-released as a single, with a different b-side, "'Til I Die", in October of the same year. This time it made it to No. 89 on the Billboard Hot 100.

Brian Wilson, who has included the song in his solo concerts, described it as "an incredible tune."
