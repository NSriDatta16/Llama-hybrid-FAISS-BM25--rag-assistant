Strathcarron railway station is a remote railway station on the Kyle of Lochalsh Line, serving the small village of Strathcarron and the larger village of Lochcarron in the Highlands, northern Scotland. The station is  from , between Achnashellach and Attadale. ScotRail, who manage the station, operate all services.

History

The station was built by Murdoch Paterson between 1869 and 1870. The station was opened to passengers on 19 August 1870 by the Dingwall and Skye Railway. The lattice-girder footbridge was built by the Rose Street Foundry in 1900.

In the early 1900s, cars were occasionally carried between Strathcarron and Kyle of Lochalsh to prevent accidents on the hazardous roads and a ferry journey.

Facilities 
Both platforms have waiting rooms and benches, and platform one - which is adjacent to the car park - also has a help point. Both platforms have step-free access, although the footbridge does not. As there are no facilities to purchase tickets, passengers must buy one in advance, or from the guard on the train.

Platform layout
The station has a passing loop  long, flanked by two platforms which can each accommodate a three-coach train. One of the Kyle line's three passing loops is located at the station (and trains are sometimes scheduled to cross here).

Services 
Four trains per day each way call at the station Mon-Sat, with two each way on summer Sundays and a single service each way on Sundays in winter.
