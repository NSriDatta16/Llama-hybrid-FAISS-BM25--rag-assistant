Max Norman is a British record producer and recording engineer active since 1973. He produced many acclaimed heavy metal releases. 

While Norman was resident engineer at Ridge Farm Studios in London, Ozzy Osbourne was recording his debut solo album Blizzard of Ozz with producer/engineer Chris Tsangarides. After Osbourne and Tsangarides parted ways, Norman was asked to carry on. 

Norman appears in the Megadeth home video Evolver, a documentary about the making of Youthanasia.

In early 2017, Norman completed projects with artists Ethan Brosh at Carriage House Studios, Machinage, and Mean Streak.
