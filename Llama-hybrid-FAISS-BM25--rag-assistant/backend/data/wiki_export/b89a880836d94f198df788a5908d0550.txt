Game summary
In this World Bowl, two back-up quarterbacks were given the starting job for NFL Europe's biggest stage. For the Rhein Fire, it was Jim Arellanes and for the Frankfurt Galaxy it was Chris Dittoe. Even in the thrashing rain, the Fire managed to light first with a 29-yard field goal by German kicker Manfred Burgsmüller. Near the end of the first quarter, Arellanes led his Fire on a 10-play, 67-yard drive that was capped off with a 15-yard pass to wide receiver Dialleo Burks. In the second quarter, the Galaxy finally managed to score, thanks to a 13-play, 80-yard drive that concluded with a three-yard run by running back Jermaine Chaney. However, near the end of the first half, the Fire didn't want Frankfurt closing in on them, as Arellanes lead a four-play, 40-yard drive that ended with a 20-yard touchdown pass to Burks, to make the score 17–7 at halftime. In the third quarter, the Galaxy struggled offensively to get points. In the end, all they could muster up was a 41-yard field goal by Ralf Kleinmann. For the remainder of the game, it was all Rhein. After Frankfurt's field goal, the Fire wrapped up the third period with a 74-yard touchdown pass from Arellanes to wide receiver Marcus Robinson. In the fourth quarter, the Fire managed to put the game away with Burgsmüller's 20-yard field goal and Jon Vaughn's 15-yard run. When the game clock reached zero, the Fire celebrated its first-ever World Bowl title.
