The Archdiocese of Vaduz (), which was erected in 1997, is a Latin Church diocese of the Catholic Church which encompasses the entire territory of the Principality of Liechtenstein.

History
The Archdiocese of Vaduz was erected by Pope John Paul II in the apostolic constitution Ad satius consulendum on 2 December 1997. Its territory, taken from the Diocese of Chur, was the entire Principality of Liechtenstein. Before then it had been the Liechtenstein Deanery, a part of the Swiss Diocese of Chur. The Archdiocese of Vaduz does not belong to any conference of bishops and reports directly to the Holy See.

Wolfgang Haas, who had been a controversial bishop of Chur since 1988, was appointed to head the new archdiocese. He took possession on his see on 21 December 1997 in Vaduz Cathedral, which had been the parish church of St. Florian.

Patrons
The principal patron of the Archdiocese is the Holy Virgin Mary, Mother of God, under the title of her Nativity (September 8). Additional patrons are the martyr St. Lucius (St. Luzi), also a patron of the diocese of Chur, and St. Florin.

Composition
The Archdiocese consists of twelve parishes.

Ordinaries
 Wolfgang Haas (2 December 1997 â€“ 20 September 2023)
