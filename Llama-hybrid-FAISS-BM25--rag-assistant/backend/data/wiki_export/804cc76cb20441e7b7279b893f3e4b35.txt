Career

Stand-up comedy 
Kavanagh presented his first stand-up comedy show, "Kavanagh!" across Quebec in 1995. The one-man show was a success and garnered rave reviews. That same year, he received the Outstanding New Talent award at the Montreux Comedy Festival in Switzerland. In December, Kavanagh once again opened for Celine Dion in Paris at the Paris-Bercy and Zenith arenas.

In 1998, after taking a year to adapt and prepare his show "Kavanagh!"  for France with famous French comedian Pascal Légitimus, Kavanagh debuted in Lyon right in the middle of the  FIFA World Cup. Nevertheless, the show drew sold-out crowds, even turning away more than 150 people a day. In the fall, he took up residence at Theâtre Trévise in Paris for seven months to sold-out audiences. After less than one year in France, Kavanagh was asked to do four shows at the Olympia, the most prestigious theater in France. After 5 years, in 2003, his Kavanagh! Tour ended after 500 shows in 7 countries and 250,000 DVDs sold.

In 2006, Kavanagh hosted numerous primetime French TV shows on France 2 television network – "The Dancing Show", "Fête de la Musique" and the "Symphonic Show" and the renowned «Night of Proms» orchestra.
