History 
Sant Quirze was constituted as a municipality in 1848, as a segregation of Terrassa. Therefore, in the 13th century it was known as Sant Quirze de Terrassa (Sant Quirze of Terrassa) and in the 15th century it was denominated as Sant Quirze de Galliners, named after the mountain range called Galliners. In 1857, it was baptized with the name of San Quirico de Tarrasa, in a Spanish way, which was changed to Sant Quirze de la Serra and changed back again to the Spanish way after the war. In 1976 the name changed to Sant Quirze del Vallès, which was officiated in 1983 with the disagreement of some of the population.
