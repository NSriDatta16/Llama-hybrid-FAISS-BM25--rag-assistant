Memorial High School, which served as the high school for Victoria Independent School District, was formed in 2000 as a result of the consolidation of Victoria High School (VHS) and Stroman High School. The Senior Campus was warned by the state due to a high dropout rate in 2004. The warning was removed the following year when the attendance leveled. The school closed after the 2009–10 school year, when it was split into two new campuses known as Victoria East and Victoria West.

Campus
Memorial HS was a Class 5A school that served the needs of 3,500+ students. The old Stroman campus housed the freshmen and sophomores while the old VHS campus housed the juniors and seniors. The school mascot was the Vipers and school colors were black, blue, silver, and white.

In 2007, Victoria ISD announced plans to purchase four pieces of land around Victoria for new campuses. Construction of two new high school campuses, one serving the east side of the district, the other serving the west side of the district, was completed in 2009. As a result, Memorial High School was split into two separate campuses, Victoria East and Victoria West. Memorial High School closed it doors at the end of the 2009–10 school year.
