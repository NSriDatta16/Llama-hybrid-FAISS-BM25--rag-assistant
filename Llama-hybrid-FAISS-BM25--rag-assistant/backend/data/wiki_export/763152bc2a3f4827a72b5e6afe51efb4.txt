History

The municipality began in 1949 with the settlement of Rio do Peixe.  Manuel Ribeiro Campos arrived with his family, bought lands and built his house along the banks of this river.  The first roads were opened by Campos himself using an axe and machete.  Campos and his workers built a landing strip in the jungle and the first plane landed in 1951.  In 1958 Dovercindo Borges arrived becoming the local political leader.  At this time Rio do Peixe belonged to the municipality of Caiapônia.  In 1964 the first bulldozer arrived and the dense vegetation began to be opened up for farmland and cattle pastures.  In 1969 Rio do Peixe was elevated to district status and the name was changed to Doverlândia, in homage to its founder Dovercindo Borges.  In 1982 it became an independent municipality.
