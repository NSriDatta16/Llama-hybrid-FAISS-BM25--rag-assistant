Carmen Sings Monk is a 1990 studio album by the American jazz singer Carmen McRae, focusing exclusively  on the songs composed by Thelonious Monk. It was one of the last recordings released in her lifetime. McRae was accompanied by Clifford Jordan on soprano and tenor saxophone, and a rhythm section with pianist Eric Gunnison, bassist George Mraz and Al Foster on drums. Two songs, namely "Get It Straight" and "Suddenly" (i.e. "In Walked Bud"), were recorded earlier that year live at the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco with tenor saxophonist Charlie Rouse, who played the longest time with Monk. The rhythm section was almost the same, then with Larry Willis on piano.

McRae was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Jazz Vocal Performance, Female at the 33rd Annual Grammy Awards for her performance on this album.

Release history
The album was originally released in 1990 on Novus Records (on CD, LP and MC), the first of four subsequent recordings by McRae released on the BMG sublabel, before Novus got defunct in the mid-1990s. McRae herself only saw the release of the following Sarah: Dedicated to You, she died in 1994. The recording was reissued three years later on Jazz Heritage, and re-released in 2001 on Bluebird in their First Editions series, another BMG subsidiary, with three additional alternate takes of the studion session (the recording dates could also finally be specified). After BMG and Sony America merged (as Sony BMG) and split again, Carmen Sings Monk was reissued in 2017, this time by Sony/Legacy.
