Hans is a Germanic male given name in Afrikaans, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, Faroese, German,  Norwegian, Icelandic and Swedish-speaking populations.  It was originally short for Johannes (John), but is now also recognized as a name in its own right for official purposes.  The earliest documented usage was in 1356 in Sweden, 1360 in Norway, and the 14th century in Denmark.

The name "Hansel" (; IPA: /ˈhɛn.zəl/, [ˈhɛnzl̩]) is a diminutive, meaning "little Hans". Another diminutive with the same meaning is  (IPA: /ˈhɛns.çən/), found in the German proverb "", which translates roughly as: "What Hansel doesn't learn, Hans will never learn".
