The Mercedes-Benz C-Class (W204) is the third generation of the Mercedes-Benz C-Class. It was manufactured and marketed by Mercedes-Benz in sedan/saloon (2007–2014), station wagon/estate (2008–2014) and coupé (2011–2015) bodystyles, with styling by Karlheinz Bauer and Peter Pfeiffer.

The C-Class was available in rear- or all-wheel drive, the latter marketed as 4MATIC. The W204 platform was also used for the E-Class Coupé (C207).

Sub-models included the C 200 Kompressor, the C 230, the C 280, the C 350, the C 220 CDI, and the C 320 CDI. The C 180 Kompressor, C 230, and C 200 CDI were available in the beginning of August 2007. The W204 station wagon was not marketed in North America.

Production reached over 2.4 million worldwide, and the W204 was the brand's best selling vehicle at the time.

Development 
In the summer of 2003, the development of the W204 C-Class used a "digital prototype", a 2.1 terabyte digital replica of the car, over a virtual distance of 15 million miles. An industry first, the digital testing allowed for crash testing before a physical prototype existed. The design of W204 was finalized in 2003 and a German design patent application was first filed on 9 September 2004, demonstrating a W204 fiberglass design model.

DaimlerChrysler introduced the W204 C-Class on 18 January 2007 at the 2007 Geneva Auto Show. Deliveries began in late March 2007 in almost all European countries.

Trim levels 

Typically, Mercedes offered the W204 in three trim and equipment levels, marketed as Classic, Elegance and Avantgarde. The base trim, marketed as Classic, was offered with smaller four-cylinder engines and cloth seats or optional leatherette, marketed as ARTICO. Elegance trim featured standard leatherette upholstery with optional leather. The Avantgarde offered Liverpool fabric/leatherette seats or optional leather. Classic and Elegance retained a traditional Mercedes-Benz grille, with horizontal chrome bars and standing hood emblem. Avantgarde trim featured a 'sport' grille with three wide matt-finish horizontal bars and a large, central emblem as well as an optional AMG bodykit, sport seats, three-spoke sport steering wheel, lower and stiffer sports suspension, upgraded brake piston calipers, and larger alloy wheels. W204s advertising predominantly featured the sport grille and AMG bodykit, especially in Canada and the United States.

The W204 line offered a range of four-cylinder petrol and diesel engines, a 3.5-litre V6 petrol and a 3.0-litre V6 diesel engine are also available. The AMG variant, marketed as the C 63 AMG used the 6.2-litre V8 petrol engine.

In the United Kingdom, the Classic trim level was marketed as the SE, and the Avantgarde trim with the AMG Sport Package was marketed as the Sport.

In the United States, the C250, made in South Africa, in Avantgarde trim with the AMG Sport Package was available on the C-250 with a four-cylinder turbocharged 1.8L engine, 7 speed automatic gearbox and RWD and the C-300 (the only US market C-Class with a standard manual transmission (manual transmission was only available with RWD), with 4MATIC system available as an option) and the C 350 Sport (RWD only).The Elegance trim was only available on the C 300 Luxury with an option for the 4MATIC all-wheel-drive system, There were no Classic/SE trim models, no models with diesel engine, and no station wagon models available in the US market.

The Canadian market offered only the AMG Line trim level; four-cylinder models and station wagon models were not offered. The base C 230 model (renamed the C 250 from the 2010 model year) was exclusive to the Canadian market and was the only model that has amenities similar to the Elegance/Luxury trim with the traditional grille and three-point star hood ornament. The other C-Class models (C 300, C 350 and C 63 respectively) offered the AMG body kit and sport grille as standard. These amenities were available as an CAD800 option for the C 230 model as the Sport Package (which rose to CAD1200 for the 2011 model year due to the new LED fog lights).

All models except the C 63 AMG and C350 were available in both rear-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive (4Matic).

Equipment 
For the 2008–2011 model year, the dashtop features a deployable central sliding cover panel over an LCD colour screen for entertainment and information functions. The optional navigation system, marketed as COMAND APS integrates a larger, 7-inch TFT screen into the deployable panel. Post MY2012 models feature a fixed screen similar to E-Class and GLK-Class models.

2010 W204s received revised turn signals integrated into the side mirrors. From the 2011 model year on, the bumper fog lamps in the AMG bodykit were replaced by LED lights, except for the C 63 AMG which retained its unique bumper.

The C-class offered a system marketed as the agility control package, which provided revised agility and ride quality via hydro-mechanics, which analysed road conditions and driving habits, and adjusted damper and suspension settings to provide a balance between ride comfort and agility. An optional advanced agility control package offered a sport mode button to enable a stiffer suspension setting and more precise handling.

The C 63 AMG has a revised front suspension that is shared with the CLK 63 AMG Black Series. The ESP features a full defeat mode, interfering only under heavy braking. The C 63 AMG also has the quickest, most responsive steering of any Mercedes automobile to date.

The Mercedes-Benz M156 engine, despite being detuned compared to other AMG offerings using the same powerplant, still provides the C 63 AMG with more horsepower and torque over its direct rivals such as the Audi RS4 and BMW M3. The 7G-Tronic 7-speed automatic transmission has AMG SpeedShift with four shift modes – Comfort, Sport, Sport + and Manual – with the last one running with the converter locked allowing the driver to hold the engine at the rev limit.

Marketing 
As part of the 2011 model year launch campaign, Two 45 and 30-second TV advertisements were made, which take a humorous and cinematographic approach to the C-Class Saloon and Estate models, focusing in particular on the innovative ATTENTION ASSIST system, which detects and provides early warning of the onset of driver drowsiness. The 20-second pre-roll titled 'Souvenir' takes an enjoyable approach to the C-Class Estate's 1,500-litre load capacity. Printed ad features C-Class photographed against an urban backdrop, with the 'living city look' highlights the sportiness and dynamic qualities of the vehicles.

As part of the C-Class Coupé campaign, an interactive web video titled 'Drive & Seek' was released in March 2011, featuring the theft of a work of art, a car chase starring the new C-Class Coupé and the hero agents, who rely on the help of the user, who must stay focused and make split-second decisions in order to capture the thieves and return the painting to its rightful owner. Four short films highlight the C-Class Coupé's top features in terms of agility, design, safety and comfort. The web special was accompanied by cinema-poster-style ads and posters. Print ad campaign started on 11 May, designed to show off the sporty and dynamic qualities and sleek design of the new C-Class Coupé. Three different ad images show the vehicle with a high-gloss finish in palladium silver on a disused air field in Jerez de la Frontera, Spain, where parts of the web thriller were also shot. In the bright midday sun, the Coupé comes across as a shining jewel. Messages such as "More style per hour, "Awe. Inspiring" or "Adrenaline accelerator included" accentuate the vehicle's modern image. The two 45- and 30-second cinema ads also take a humorous approach to the campaign slogan "More glances per hour", which was released on 19 May 2011 serving as sequel to the Drive & Seek, linking back to the bank robbery featured in the film.

A behind the scene video titled Making of C 63 AMG Coupe Fotoshooting was released by Mercedes AMG, featuring C 63 AMG Coupe and a Ducati 848 in matching white.

AMG "Black Series" 50' Marauder Cigarette Boat, a powerboat inspired by C 63 AMG Coupé Black Series and built by Cigarette Racing, was unveiled at the 2012 Miami Boat Show.
