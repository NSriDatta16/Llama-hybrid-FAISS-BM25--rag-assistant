The Camion Équipé d'un Système d'Artillerie (English: "Truck equipped with an artillery system") or CAESAR is a French 155 mm, 52-caliber self-propelled howitzer that can fire 39/52 caliber NATO-standard shells. It is installed on a 6x6 or 8x8 truck chassis. Equipped with an autonomous weapon network incorporating an inertial navigation system and ballistic computer, the CAESAR can accurately strike targets more than  away using "Extended Range, Full Bore" (ERFB) ammunition with base bleed, or targets over  away using rocket assisted or smart ammunition.

Units manufactured for the French Army use a 6x6 Renault Sherpa 5 chassis, while exported versions use the 6x6 Unimog U2450L chassis or the 8x8 Tatra 817 chassis. The CAESAR platform was developed by French defense contractor GIAT Industries (now Nexter Systems) and has been exported to various countries including Belgium, Denmark, the Czech Republic, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Thailand and Ukraine.

Development
CAESAR was developed in the 1990s as a technology demonstrator by the French state-owned company GIAT Industries, in cooperation with Lohr Industrie. It was first publicly unveiled in 1994. Four years later, a pre-production model underwent trials with the French Army.

In peacetime the production rate at Nexter was understood to be 10 CAESARs per year. The 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine boosted demand. By early 2023 Nexter's factory in Bourges was producing between two and four units per month in continuous operation. The next milestone expected is to produce eight CAESARs a month by December 2023.

The gun uses a special kind of shell, the LU 211, which is produced at Les Forges de Tarbes, within the confines of the town arsenal. The forge was privatized in November 2021 by a French firm which had recently been recapitalized by 100M€. In 2020, the Minister of the Armed Forces signed a contract worth 25M€ for the plant to supply shells to the French Army for the decade. The privatization furnished 9M€ each year for the 2021–2024 period. In autumn 2021, the firm supplied an extra 2M€ to modernize the plant, which also produces 120mm ammunition for the Leclerc MBT. The production rate was 1,500 CAESAR shells per month in March 2023, which is planned to rise to 3,000 per month in January 2024.

Design

The CAESAR is a wheeled, 155mm 52-caliber self-propelled howitzer. It embarks 18 rounds and is typically operated by a crew of five, though if necessary the CAESAR can be operated by a crew as few as three. It can be transported by a C-130 or an A400M aircraft.  It has a firing range of approximately  using an Extended Range, Full Bore (ERFB) shell, and more than  using rocket assisted shells. The CAESAR integrates an autonomous weapon system featuring an inertial navigation system (the SIGMA 30), a ballistic computer and an optional muzzle velocity radar; the system is adaptable to any C4l system (fully integrated with the ATLAS FCS). At Eurosatory 2016, the CAESAR was exhibited with an automated laying system based on the SIGMA 30.

Tailored for shoot-and-scoot tactics, the CAESAR is fast to set up, taking around 60 seconds for the crew to be ready to fire and 40 seconds to leave after the shots. It sustains a rate of fire of six rounds per minute.

Variants

CAESAR 8x8

The CAESAR 8x8 uses a modified Tatra 817 8x8 chassis, allowing a higher degree of mobility. It is fitted with an unarmoured forward control four-person cabin as standard, with an optional fully-armoured cabin. Gross vehicle weight would depend on the level of armour protection, but is about 30 tonnes. It is powered by a 410 hp diesel engine and can embark 36 rounds. It was unveiled by Nexter at DSEI 2015.

CAESAR NG

In February 2022, Nexter was awarded a contract by the French Direction générale de l'armement (DGA) for the development of the CAESAR 6x6 Mark II new generation (NG) artillery system. The Mark II features a new chassis with a more powerful 460 hp engine and new automatic gearbox, new fire control software, and a Level 2 mine and ballistic armored cabin raising the vehicle's weight to 25 tonnes (27.56 tons). The contract begins a four-year development phase, after which the Mark II will enter production. In 2024, the DGA will choose whether to start production of 109 newly built Mark IIs or to procure 33 new vehicles while retrofitting the 76 CAESARs already in service.

Operational deployment
Eight CAESARs were sent to Afghanistan during the summer of 2009 to support French operations. They were deployed on 1 August 2009 by the 3rd Marine Artillery Regiment (3è RAMa), followed by five others, deployed as a firebase in FOB Tora, Tagab and Nijrab. They are fitted with cabin armor add-ons, with fireports.

The French Army deployed this system in southern Lebanon as part of the UNIFIL peace keeping force.

During Operation Serval in Mali, four CAESAR were deployed by the 68e régiment d'artillerie d'Afrique (68th African Artillery Regiment).

In April 2011, the Royal Thai Army used the CAESAR against Cambodia's BM-21. The Thai Army claimed that they destroyed two or more BM-21 systems.

Several CAESAR were deployed in Mali by France during Operation Serval, in which they saw action in the Battle of Ifoghas, amongst others. France also deployed four CAESAR to Iraq for the Battle of Mosul, where French forces supported the Iraqi Army's operation to reclaim Mosul from ISIL from October 2016 to July 2017. Multiple CAESAR were deployed to Iraq on the border with Syria from 8 November 2018 to April 2019 to support the Syrian Democratic Forces in the Battle of Baghuz Fawqani, the ultimately successful operation to capture the final town held by the Islamic State group. They deployed to Firebase Saham, a base freshly constructed by the United States Army to provide fire support during the battle, especially during cloudy days when U.S. aircraft could not see to conduct airstrikes.

CAESAR howitzers may have been used by Saudi Arabia National Guard during the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen along the Saudi-Yemeni frontier, conduct defensive shelling of Houthi forces as well as back up Yemeni government troops and Saudi armed forces in their progression into Yemeni territory.

France provided CAESAR 6x6 howitzers to Ukraine from May 2022 onwards in the context of the Russo-Ukrainian War, having pledged a total of 30 units; Denmark also announced it had delivered all its 19 CAESAR 8x8 to Ukraine in April 2023 onwards. 3 CAESARs were confirmed to have been destroyed by photos and videos in the war as of September 2023 (two 6x6 models and one 8x8).

Operators

The Danish Army didn't use the CAESAR operationally before its transfer to Ukraine

Current operators
 - French Army: The first order (for 5 howitzers) was placed on 20 September 2000. The first five units were delivered in 2003. Following the evaluation, the main order of 72 CAESAR 6x6 howitzers was made in late 2004. In July 2008, the first cannon of the first batch of eight units was delivered to the French Army. It is expected to field a total of 109 CAESAR NG by 2030.
 - Indonesian Army: The Indonesian Army acquired 37 CAESAR units for $240 million, the first two arriving in mid September 2012. Another 18 were purchased in a follow-up order signed in February 2017.
 - Royal Moroccan Army: In early 2020, Morocco inked the purchase of 36 CAESAR 6x6 howitzers. The contract included €170 million for the artillery pieces, €30 million for the ammunition. The delivery started in September 2022. According to the "Rapport au Parlement sur les exportations d’armement de la France 2023" by the Defence Ministry the 36 CAESAr systems were delivered in 2022 .
 - Saudi Arabian National Guard: In 2006, GIAT announced a 76-unit sale plus a 4-unit option to an unspecified foreign customer, later confirmed to be Saudi Arabia. The 4 optional units became firm sales in January 2007, with the first two units to be assembled in France and the other 78 in Saudi Arabia. In March 2010, the Saudi Arabian National Guard (SANG) was delivered its first four units. All 80 units were delivered by 2018.
 - Royal Thai Army: The 6 CAESAR is operated by the Royal Thai Army (RTA) from 2010, ordered in 2006, mounted on the Sherpa 6x6 truck chassis.
 - Ukrainian Ground Forces: 18 howitzers as of October 2022, with another 31 to be delivered. Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, France sent 12 CAESARs to Ukraine. On 22 April 2022, 40 Ukrainian soldiers arrived in France for training on the system. Now operated by the 55th Artillery Brigade. The provision of 6 more CAESAR howitzers was announced by President Macron on 16 June 2022, bringing the total number donated to 18 6x6 variants. On 19 January 2023, the Danish defense minister announced that 19 8x8 variants that were to be delivered in the first half of 2023 to the Danish army would instead be donated to Ukraine. On 31 January 2023, France pledged an additional 12 Caesar howitzer for Ukraine. On the 28th of April 2023, it is announced that the 19 CAESAr 8x8 given by Denmark have been delivered to the Ukrainian Army.

Future operators
 - Belgian Land Component: Following the acquisition of the Griffon and Jaguar within the CaMo-program, Belgium decided in 2021 to order 9 CAESAR NG 6x6 howitzers in a contract of approximately €48 million. In June 2022 a €62 million contract was signed for an additional 19 CAESAR NG to be delivered between 2025 and 2027.
 - Czech Land Forces: In June 2020, CAESAR 8x8 won a €200 million contract for the Czech Army. The Army decided to buy 52 howitzers that will be installed on the Czech Tatra 815–7T3RC1 8×8. 10 additional units ordered in December 2022.
 - Lithuanian Land Forces: In June 2022 Lithuania joined the CAESAR NG (Mk2) program with an order for 18 units, with first deliveries expected in 2026.

Potential operators 

  - Brazilian Army: The CAESAR was offered to the Brazilian Army as part of the "VBCOAP 155mm SR" program for the acquisition of 36 self-propelled howitzers.  Among the competitors are the Brazilian project "Sistema de Artillería 155mm/52 AP SR Tupã" by Avibras Aeroespacial, potentially the Artillery Gun Module by KMW (derived from the PzH2000) The other, and main competitor is the ATMOS 2000 presented by Elbit Systems. Elbit is a strong competitor as it has subsidiaries in Brazil (ARES Aerospacial e Defesa and AEL Sistemas) which would guarantee the logistical support and a technology transfer.
  - British Army: The army is looking for a replacement of the AS-90 tracked self-propelled gun-howitzer by 2032 (under project named Mobile Fire Platform). All types of self-propelled howitzer are being considered. 116 guns are to be acquired: It has already acquired 14 Archer Artillery Systems as an interim replacement for the 30 AS-90 transferred to Ukraine. The 8x8 Archer variant is offered as part of the MFP program K9 Thunder offered by Hanwha Aerospace and KNDS (Nexter and KMW)  8x8 Caesar have been promoted for the MFP program.
  - Iraqi Ground Forces: The Iraqi Army has shown some interest for the Caesar system in 2022.
 - The Bulgarian Armed Forces want CEASARs and nexter has expressed interest in making CEASARs for Bulgaria.

Former operators 
 - Royal Danish Army: On 14 March 2017 the CAESAR 8x8 was chosen to become the new artillery system of the Royal Danish Army. 15 howitzers were ordered in May 2017 and an additional 4 in October 2019 for a total of 19 CAESAR units. Delivery of the first 15 units was expected to take place by summer 2020 but the COVID pandemic led to the delivery of a first batch being delayed to spring 2021, with delivery of all 19 units expected in 2023. However, following discussions with France, Denmark decided on 19 January 2023 to donate all systems to Ukraine in the context of the 2022 Russian invasion. The capability gap that arose from this decision led to a new bid for which Nexter, once again, and Israel's Elbit Systems competed. Denmark opted for the ATMOS 2000 system over the CAESAR, with the production backlog of the CAESAR and Soltam's ability to quickly deliver the howitzers being cited among the reasons for said choice. Denmark's interest in purchasing 8 PULS rocket artillery systems  as well as the fact that it already operated the Cardom 120mm self-propelled mortar, which are produced by Elbit as well, had reportedly also favored the acquisition of the ATMOS as it meant having a sole supplier for the artillery segment.

Failed bids 
 - National Army of Colombia: The Caesar was one of the competitors of the program "Soberana", intended to provide the future 155mm artillery system. The other competitors were the ATMOS 2000 and the Turkish Yavuz SPh 6x6 by MKE. On 1 January 2023, Indodefensa announced that the Colombian Army favored the French system and that the government was about to notify the contract for the Caesar 6x6 to Nexter for US$101.7 million. However, on 3 January 2023, Colombia announced the order of 18 ATMOS 2000 for US$101.7 million. It was reported the value of the CAESAR contract notified by Nexter exceeded the budget allocated to the program, leading to the negotiations falling through and Colombia choosing the ATMOS instead.
  - Indian Army: The army is looking to modernize its artillery. The Field Artillery Rationalisation Plan defined in 2021 the way to be followed, focusing on the made in India. The Indian Army is expecting 814 truck mounted guns (MGS program = multi-terrain gun system). A RFI was issued on 3 April 2021, with the intent to acquire a truck mounted howitzer capable to be deployed in deserts, high altitude and mountainous terrains. CAESAR was offered in 2014 as part of a collaboration between Nexter Systems & Larsen & Toubro. The system is mounted on a Ashok Leyland Super Stallion 6x6. India was initially interested in an MGS, 200 that would be ordered off shelf, and later 614 manufactured locally. As part as the "Make in India" initiative, this program was modified to favor local designs. Therefore, the Caesar will not be used by India.
  - Norwegian Army: In January 2016, Norway had shortlisted CAESAR, the K9 Thunder, the PzH 2000 and a modernized version of the M109 Paladin proposed by Switzerland's RUAG to replace the 18 M109A3GN self-propelled guns in service with the Norwegian Armed forces. The K9 was selected for purchase in December 2017.
  - United States Army & United States Marine Corps: The Army was interested in a mobile platform. Some "Mobile Howitzer Trials and Shoot-Off" had been occurring in 2021. The systems tested were the CAESAR, the BRUTUS the ATMOS 2000, the Archer and the Nora B-52. The Army was very positive with the Caesar, but ultimately did not move forward with acquiring a wheeled howitzer system.
