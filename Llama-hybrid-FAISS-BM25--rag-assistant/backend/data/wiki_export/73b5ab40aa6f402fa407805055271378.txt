Niaqornaarsuk () is a village in the Qeqertalik municipality in western Greenland, along the northern entrance to Arfersiorfik Fjord. Its population was 249 in 2020.

Transport 
Air Greenland serves the village as part of government contract, with winter-only helicopter flights from Niaqornaarsuk Heliport to Aasiaat Airport and Kangaatsiaq Heliport. Settlement flights in the Aasiaat Archipelago are unique in that they are operated only during winter and spring.

Population 
The population of Niaqornaarsuk has fluctuated over the last two decades, decreasing in the 2000s.
