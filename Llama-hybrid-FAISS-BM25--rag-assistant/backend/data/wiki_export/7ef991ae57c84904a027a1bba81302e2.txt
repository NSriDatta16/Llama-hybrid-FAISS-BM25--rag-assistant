Legal Significance

On someone dying intestate (i.e. without having made a valid will), the property of the deceased formerly legally vested in the President of the Family Division until the Probate Registry made a grant of grant of administration to the deceased's personal representatives. The property now vests in the Public Trustee until a grant is made.
