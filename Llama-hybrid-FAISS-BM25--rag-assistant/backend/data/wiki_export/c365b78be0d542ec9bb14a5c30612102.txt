Stewarton railway station is a railway station in the town of Stewarton, East Ayrshire, Scotland. The station is managed by ScotRail and is on the Glasgow South Western Line.

History 
The station was opened on 27 March 1871 by the Glasgow, Barrhead and Kilmarnock Joint Railway. The station closed on 7 November 1966, however it reopened on 5 June 1967. In April 2007 a 'Ticket Issuing Machine' was installed in recognition of the relatively high passenger levels.

Operations to reinstate a second line between Lochridge Junction near Stewarton and Lugton started in 2008.  During the upgrade work (on 27 January 2009), a bridge crossing the A735 road south of the station collapsed as an oil train was passing over it, resulting in several tank wagons in the consist derailing and catching fire.  No-one was hurt in the accident; the line was closed between Barrhead and Kilmarnock for three weeks whilst the tankers were recovered and the damaged bridge rebuilt (the structure had already been scheduled for replacement as part of the re-doubling project prior to the accident).

When the work was completed in September 2009, the second platform was reinstated, the pedestrian underpass re-opened and full disabled access provided. An overspill car park opened on 31 January 2012, accessed from platform 2.

Stewarton opened for goods traffic on 23 March 1871 and closed on 5 October 1964. It handled general goods as well as livestock and horseboxes.

The station lay 19.02 miles south of the old terminus, Glasgow Saint Enoch.

The station has been adopted (2015) by the staff and clients of Hansel Village near Symington and they also maintain the displays of planted flowers on the platforms.
