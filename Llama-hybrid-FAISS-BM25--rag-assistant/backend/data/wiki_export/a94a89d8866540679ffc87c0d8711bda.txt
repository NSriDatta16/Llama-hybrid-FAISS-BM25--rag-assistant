Şalom is a Jewish weekly newspaper published in Turkey. Its name is the Turkish spelling of the Hebrew word  (Shalom). It was established on 29 October 1947 by the Turkish Jewish journalist Avram Leyon. It is printed in Istanbul and is published every Wednesday. Apart from one Ladino (Judaeo-Spanish) page, it is published in Turkish. From 1947 to 1984, the newspaper was published exclusively in Ladino. However, due to the massive decline of Ladino and the language shift to Turkish in the Turkish Jewish community over the decades, the newspaper switched to Turkish and the Ladino content was reduced to one page in 1984. İvo Molinas is its publisher, and Yakup Barokas is its editor in chief. Its circulation is about 5,000.
