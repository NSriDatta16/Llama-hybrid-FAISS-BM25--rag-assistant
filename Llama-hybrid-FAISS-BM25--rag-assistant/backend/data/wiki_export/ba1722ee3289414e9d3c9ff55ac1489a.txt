Etymology

Geography

History
The first written mention of Nové Hrady is from 1293. At that time, the village belonged to the Litomyšl estate and shared its owner. A late Gothic castle was built on the site of an old castle in 1442–1468 by the then-owner of Litomyšl, Zdeněk Kostka of Postupice, and the Nové Hrady estate was established. The Gothic castle was rebuilt into a Renaissance residence in the 15th century, but during the Thirty Years' War, it was looted and destroyed by Swedish army.

Nové Hrady saw its rise in the 18th century. In 1750, the French aristocratic Harbuval de Chamarè family bought the estate and had built the Nové Hrady Castle. The family gradually became poorer, so at the beginning of the 20th century, they sold the estate.
