Reception
The Press called The Lost Children "a high-spirited adventure for young viewers and their parents". The Sunday Herald praised the television series, writing, "The Lost Children is set in 1867, but don't think this is just another boring historical drama.  This is the fascinating story of a young English brother and sister, Ethan and Amy, and their unlikely friends, Meg and Tama."

Frances Grant of the The New Zealand Herald penned a negative review of the television series. She wrote, "the kids' wildly fluctuating accents and their spruce appearance after supposedly being washed up on a wild foreign coast were distracting" and said "the acting, too, is stilted and seems to hark back to a more self-conscious era". Grant criticised the series for having an "eerie whistling soundtrack every time a Maori appears on the screen" and for "suffering from a Rip Van Winkle effect".
