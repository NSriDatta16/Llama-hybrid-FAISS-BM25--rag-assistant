Bei'an () is a county-level city in west-central Heilongjiang province in the People's Republic of China. It is under the jurisdiction of Heihe.
Bei'an was the provincial capital of Bei'an province of Manchukuo, a puppet state set up by Japan during the Second World War. Bei'an received the unofficial moniker of "Gun City" because it was the location of Factory #626; Factory #626 mainly manufactured Chinese clones of WW2 firearms and Type 56 rifles. Eventually, it was privatized in the 1980s as the Shougang Kingho Plant until it went bankrupt in 2006. Six years later, a museum detailing the history of Factory #626 opened.
