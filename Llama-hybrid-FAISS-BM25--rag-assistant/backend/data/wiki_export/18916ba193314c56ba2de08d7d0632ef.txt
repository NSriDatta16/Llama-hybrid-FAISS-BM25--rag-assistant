Akulliq () was a territorial electoral district (riding) for the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut, Canada.

The riding consisted of the communities of Kugaaruk and Repulse Bay. Kugaaruk is now a part of the Netsilik riding and Repulse Bay (which has since been renamed to Naujaat) is a part of the Aivilik riding.

Election results

1999 election

2004 election

2008 election
The 2008 election was delayed in Akulliq due to a legal challenge brought by former Member of Parliament Jack Anawak, who filed as a candidate but was rejected by Elections Nunavut because he had not lived in Nunavut for twelve consecutive months prior to the election. After Anawak's challenge was dismissed by the courts, a by-election was held on December 15, 2008, but only two votes separated incumbent MLA Steve Mapsalak and his main challenger, former Northwest Territories MLA John Ningark.

A judicial recount was conducted, but resulted in Ningark and Mapsalak each receiving exactly 157 votes, thus forcing a second election on March 2, 2009.
