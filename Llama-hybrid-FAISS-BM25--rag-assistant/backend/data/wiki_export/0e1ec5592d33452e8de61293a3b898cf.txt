Homstølvatnet or Eptevatn is a lake in the far western part of the municipality of Froland in Agder county, Norway.  It is located about  east of the village of Byglandsfjord (in Bygland municipality) and about  northwest of the village of Mykland in Froland.  The lake was expanded in 1973 when a dam was built at the south end of the lake Eptevatn for the purposes of hydroelectric power generation.  The dam made the lake larger so that it now includes the formerly separate lake Homstølvatnet as one large lake.  The lake is now  large and it holds about  as a reservoir for the power station.
