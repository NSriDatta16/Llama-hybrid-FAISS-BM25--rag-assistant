Svetlana Khorkina won her second title, only the fifth female gymnast to achieve this feat. At age 22, she became the oldest women's all-around champion since Nellie Kim in 1979, the last time the event had been won by a gymnast in her 20s. Daniele Hypólito became the first Latin American gymnast to ever place in the top five.

As of 2023, this is the most recent Women's All Around final where none of the medals were won by an American gymnast.
