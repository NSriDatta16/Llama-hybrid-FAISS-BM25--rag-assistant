Plot
Prof. Takeshi Aikawa is researching the location of an ancient Indian princess, Princess Surya of Gupta Empire. Prof. Aikawa's grandson, Ryu, becomes involved when the group of gangster attack Ryu and his spoiled girlfriend Yukari and ransacks his grandfather's apartment in search of information about the princess until Ryu witnesses as he discovered the manuscript which was an ancient Indian sex manual called Kamasutra. Ryu goes to India to help his grandfather. There, he finds his grandfather's assistant, Shakti, who introduces him to learn the techniques found in Kamasutra.

During a trip to Prof. Aikawa's locations, Ryu and Shakti are kidnapped by the same gangsters who are working for an ancient Indian cult, the Naga Tribe, and soon takes them into the Palace of Naga. Ryu is sexually drained and physically debilitated while in captivity, but his grandfather and adventurous Indy Yakko manage to rescue them. Afterward, Prof. Aikawa's group goes to Khajuraho Temple to find a golden cup-like artifact called the Sex Grail, which is sealed inside of Rama's sculpture, and with it, they can locate and retrieve the frozen princess Surya, who was resting at Himalayas, with using the grail to revive Surya from the suspended animated state.

Meanwhile, having failed at obtaining the grail, the person behind the attacks, the Old Master, dies and his son, Prince Rudra assumes the leadership of the tribe, and rapes Jody, the Old Master's doctor in the process. He then personally kidnaps Surya to obtain her love juice to be used with the grail. Rudra then tries to obtain the grail and succeeds by deceiving Ryu into an exchange of the princess for the grail. After obtaining the grail (and kidnapping Ryu in the process), he sends his henchman, Hige Godzilla to trick Yukari into raping Surya for them. Yukari does so and is also captured and jailed along with Ryu before they are crushed and stuck by a wall trap. Yakko, however, can track them down and rescues them. While trying to escape, they're confronted by Rudra, who uses his mystical power to attack them, but they still escape.

Prince Rudra, now in possession of the Sex Grail and forced to marry princess Surya, as they proceed with the wedding ceremony, however, they're interrupted by the attack of Captain Austin, an American soldier, and Jody's father, who came to avenge his daughter. He manages to escape by the Boat of Garuda along with Surya and the grail but is soon followed by Austin, Prof. Aikawa, Yakko, and Ryu. With help of the Sex Grail, Rudra opens a portal to enter them into the earthly paradise of Shambhala which is hidden inside the waterfall, he is soon followed by Ryu and Yakko with help of Captain Austin. As they entering to Shambhala, Ryu, and Yakko find a giant golden egg-shaped vessel, the Sacred Egg, floating like a sun, they continued to rescue Surya.

In the meantime, Prof. Aikawa goes to Khajuraho once again to find another way of entering Shambhala along with Shakti, Yukari, and Hige, by using the grail counterpart, the Cup of Death, and joining them in a foursome position which is similar to Khajuraho's erotic sculpture. As prince Rudra and princess Surya enter the Sacred Egg, Prof. Aikawa and his allies (who are shown naked in a foursome position) appear before him. Soon after, Ryu and Yakko also arrive and Ryu manages to catch Rudra just as he enters the egg with Surya, in which the grail falls outside the egg, just as the Sacred Egg elevates itself and flies towards space.

As Rudra and Ryu engage in the fight, they're interrupted by the group of celestial angels who reside in the egg, they give Ryu and Rudra a final task to perform in group sex based on the Kamasutra, as only one can be together with Surya. Ryu decides that he wants to do it with her, and so Rudra takes out from the egg by a Nāga-like creature, killing him. As angels disappear, leave only Surya and Ryu and they both have sex in eternal pleasure. Having fulfilled its purpose, the Sacred Egg is now split in two, one takes Ryu and the other Surya, and then falls to Earth.

By this time, Prof. Aikawa, Yakko, Shakti, Yukari, and Hige manage to get all of them back from Shambhala to Earth using the Boat of Garuda with the help of the Sex Grail. As they return, Prof. Aikawa's group saw the two Sacred Eggs, one falling into a river, and Ryu released while Surya was still inside the other, floating in the sky. Surya fulfilling his promise to him as the Sacred Egg gets smaller and attaches itself to the grail. Afterward, the next day, the Sex Grail and the Sacred Egg now is then returned to their original place, and sealed into the sculpture, while Ryu and his group leave India and returned to Japan safely.
