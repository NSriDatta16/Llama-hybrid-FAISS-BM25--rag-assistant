Oleksandr Yevhenovych Rybka (; born 10 April 1987) is a Ukrainian professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Obolon Kyiv.

Career
He was a goalkeeper for the Ukrainian national under-21 football team along with Bohdan Shust becoming the vice-champion at the 2006 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship.

In the 2007–2008 season, due to injury, he made four appearances for FC Dynamo Kyiv conceding 3 goals. He then made his UEFA Champions League debut against Real Madrid C.F. in 2006/2007 season's group stage. Dynamo lost the game 5–1 in Madrid and Rybka made a memorable performance, even though he conceded a 5th and final goal of the match from a penalty kick.

In 2011, Rybka had signed for FC Shakhtar. In Shakhtar, he would put up some great performances, and would eventually become the starting goalkeeper. However, this momentum stopped. Rybka received a two-year ban after testing positive for a prohibited substance diuretic in a league game against Karpaty Lviv in November 2011 lasting until January 10, 2014, meaning he would miss the 2012 UEFA European Championship which were being co-hosted by Ukraine alongside Poland.

On 1 November 2013, Rybka re-signed for Dynamo Kyiv. The 3-year contract he signed began in January 2014, when his ban was terminated.

In March 2022, he moved on loan to Boluspor.

In January 2023 he moved to Lviv.
