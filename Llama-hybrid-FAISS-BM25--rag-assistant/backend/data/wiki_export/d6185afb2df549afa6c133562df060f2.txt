The Catherine Park () is the large landscaped area to the south of the Catherine Palace, located in the town of Tsarskoye Selo (Pushkin), 25Â km south-east of St. Petersburg, Russia.

The park has two parts: a formal 18th century Dutch-style garden and a natural English garden.

At the same time, a  reflecting pool was constructed on the third parterre, and two ponds were made on the Vangazi creek flowing from the hill: the Upper (Large) and Mill ponds (later included in the cascade of Lower ponds).

The main features in this garden are the Upper bath, Lower bath, Hermitage, Cave, Hermitage Kitchen, Moreyskaya column, Vorota gate, and Orlov gate.
