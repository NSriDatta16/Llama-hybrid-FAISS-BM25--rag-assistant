The Violet Hour is a play by Richard Greenberg which premiered at the  South Coast Repertory in 2002 and ran on Broadway in 2003.

Synopsis 
The play takes place in New York in 1919. A young publisher named John Pace Seavering has enough money to publish one book. He is torn between publishing the gargantuan novel of his former college roommate, Denis McCleary, who hopes that he and his fianc√©e, Rosamund Plinth, can win the blessing of her wealthy father. John's other option is to publish the memoirs of his lover Jessie Brewster, a famous singer. Then a mysterious, paper spewing machine appears in the office. John and his assistant Gidger discover that the papers are from books published far in the future, chronicling the history of the publishing house after it achieves success and prestige.  Gidger, John's assistant, learns that he is forgotten by time (while even his dog merits a mention). John learns that while he becomes a well-to-do publisher, the success has disastrous results for both his Denis and Jessie. He tries to avert these fates by refusing to publish either manuscript, but realizes that their paths are unavoidable. Finally, he agrees to publish both, knowing that what happens afterwards is out of his hands.
