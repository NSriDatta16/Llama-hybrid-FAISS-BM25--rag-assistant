Tracy Wilson,  (born September 25, 1961) is a Canadian former competitive ice dancer. With partner Rob McCall, she won the Canadian national championship seven times (1982–1988), is a three-time World bronze medallist, and the 1988 Olympic bronze medallist.

Personal life
Wilson was born on September 25, 1961, in Lachine, Quebec, Canada. She grew up in Port Moody, British Columbia. As child she did swimming and diving, competing at provincials three times. She first swam with the Coquitlam Sharks in 1967 before moving, in 1970, to Port Moody Aquarians. She attended college for one semester before her partnership with Rob McCall began.

In 1987, Wilson married Brad Kinsella. Though she did not change her name at the time, her name is sometimes printed as Tracy Wilson-Kinsella or Tracy Wilson Kinsella. Together they have three children – two sons who play hockey and a daughter who competes as an equestrian. They live in Toronto, Ontario.

Skating career
Wilson started skating when she was six years old in Coquitlam. After moving she became a member of Port Moody's Inlet Skating Club. She competed in ice dancing for the first time when she was fifteen. On the junior level, Wilson competed with Mark Stokes. They were the 1980 Canadian junior national champions.

In the summer of 1981, Wilson teamed up with Rob McCall. Their partnership started at the Elgin Barrow Arena in Richmond Hill, Ontario, and they trained in Richmond Hill throughout their competitive careers. Together they won the Canadian national championship seven times, from 1982 to 1988. They won the Skate Canada International competition in 1983 and 1987. The 1983 gold was the first time a Canadian team won the event. The pair were three-time World bronze medallists (1986-1988). They competed at the 1984 Winter Olympic and the 1988 Winter Olympic, winning a bronze medal in the 1988 Games. That medal was Canada's first Olympic medal in ice dancing.

After the 1988 Worlds, they decided to go pro. They competed in professional competition, including winning the World Professional Championships in 1989. The team also performed with Stars on Ice for two years and other shows. In March/April 1990, McCall was diagnosed with AIDS and his health was deteriorating. Disregarding the mass public fear of AIDS at the time, Wilson continued to skate with McCall. The pair did some shows and skated at the 1990 World Professional Championships. Wilson had to stop skating with the birth of her first child in 1991. Soon after McCall deteriorated further and he died November 15, 1991. Wilson retired from ice dancing, but she did skate a solo, while pregnant with her second child, at the tribute show for McCall on November 21, 1992.
