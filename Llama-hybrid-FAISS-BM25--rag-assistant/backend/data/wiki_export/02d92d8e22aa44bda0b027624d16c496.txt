Since the Revolution, Freemasonry has been banned in Iran; a "Grand Lodge of Iran in Exile" is currently established in Los Angeles, where the local Grand Lodge approved its practice in 1985.

Japan
Freemasonry in Japan first began with the opening of trade with foreign countries occasioned by Commodore Perry's Black Ships in 1866.  Prior to World War II, several Grand Lodges had subordinate Lodges there, including those of England, Ireland, and Scotland.  Most went dark as the war loomed.  After World War II, the Grand Lodge of the Philippines charted new Lodges throughout the country.

General MacArthur, commander of US forces occupying Japan, a mason himself, supported the creation of several Lodges.

Korea
In late 1907 and early 1908 a number of Freemasons then residing in Korea undertook to establish the first Masonic Lodge on the Peninsula. A Charter was issued by the Grand Lodge of Scotland on November 5, 1908, and the name Han Yang, one of the ancient names for the capital city, was chosen to designate the new Lodge. The members were initially merchants, miners, and missionaries from Lodge Hyogo and Osaka 498 in Japan; occupations that represented most of the foreign population in what was then known as Chosun. In addition to Lodge Han Yang, there are  two other Scottish lodges on the Korean Peninsula: Lodge Pusan and Lodge Harry S. Truman #1727  in Pyeongtaek (on the roll of the Grand Lodge of Scotland).  In December 1978 a letter was sent to facilitate Truman Lodge, and began as such, "Sixteen Master Masons, all members of the US Uniformed services or US civilian component thereof, have petitioned Lodge Han Yang 1048 and Pusan Lodge 1675, for support for the formation of a lodge in or in the immediate vicinity of (US) Osan Air Base located in the city of Songtan Up some 45 miles south of Seoul. There are reportedly some 30 Brn. additionally, who have indicated a keen interest in the formation of the lodge and who will lend their support."  Similarly, MacArthur Lodge (under the jurisdiction of the Most Worshipful Grand Lodge of the Philippines). MacArthur Lodge currently holds meetings on the United States military base located within Seoul. Furthermore, numerous Prince Hall Freemasonry Lodges from the MWPHGL of Washington and Jurisdiction (and other PHA Grand Lodges) meet on various United States military bases throughout the country, including II Corinthians #96 at USAG Yongsan in Seoul, Sprig of Acacia #93 at Camp Casey, and Billy G.

The Sindh Wildlife Conservation building in Saddar, Karachi, served as a Masonic hall until it was taken over by the government. The Masonic Temple in Lahore, built in 1860, has been renamed to Mason Hall and is today used as a multi-purpose government building by the Government of Punjab.

Brief History of Gran Logia Soberana del Archipielago Filipino

On January 12, 1889, the Hispanico-Filipino Association was inaugurated in Madrid. The association was headed by the illustrious Grand Master Miguel Morayta and was composed of distinguished Spanish and Filipino Masons. The primary objective of the association was to fight for reforms in the Philippines, inspired by the Masonic principles of liberty, equality, and fraternity.
According to pages 215-216 of the Master Mason's ritual, 1906 Edition, of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, Ohras Masonicas Oficiales, Volume III, the Grande Oriente Español established several lodges in the Philippines in 1889. However, these lodges were forced to operate in secrecy due to the power of the friars. In 1892, the Nilad Lodge in Manila was issued a charter by the Grande Oriente Español and several other workshops were established shortly thereafter. By the end of 1895, the Philippines had twenty-four lodges, a triangle, and a chamber of Knights of Kadosh.
Unfortunately, the revolution that began in 1896 and ended with the United States taking control of the islands led to the dissolution of nearly all the lodges due to persecution and suffering. Despite this, the Modestia Lodge was able to survive and continue the Spanish Masonic tradition in the Philippines. Three lodges, one triangle, and a Rose Croix Chapter operate in the Philippines under the Grande Oriente Español. The Grand Orient of France and the Grand Lodge of California also have lodges in Manila, but the work of the lodges of the Grande Oriente Español soon lead to the development of Masonic doctrines throughout the country.

Organization of the First Grand Logia Regional of the Philippines

As per the esteemed Constitution of the Gran Logia Soberana del Archipelago Filipino, it is stated that the first Regional Grand Lodge of the Philippines was organized in June 1887. Ill.:. and Pot.:. Bro.:. Miguel Morayta, 33°, was the Assistant Grand Master and Acting Grand Master of the Spanish Symbolic Masonry of the Sovereign Grand Symbolic Lodges, under the auspices of the Gran Oriente de España. Later, on January 9, 1889, the organization took the title of Grande Oriente Español.

(2) Grand Lodge of the Philippines

(3) Gran Logia Nacional de Filipinas (Supremo Consejo del Grado 33 para Filipinas). https://glnf.ph/historia/

The latter is solely practicing the original landmarks of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rites (AASR); comprising with a none-ladderized 33 degrees.

The Grand Lodge of the Philippines was founded in 1912, it has 360 lodges with 16 500 members and is recognised by the United Grand Lodge of England. It had a pivotal role in the reestablishment of Freemasonry in Japan after World War II.

The Filipino Masons
Gran Logia Nacional de Filipinas (National Grand Lodge of the Philippines) under the Supremo Consejo del Grado  33°  para Filipinas is a member of International Confederation of United Grand Lodges (https://www.acaciamagazine.org/html/icucgl) founded by Timoteo Paez.  The Supremo Consejo del Grado 33 para Filipinas (first in the far east) was incorporated on July 4, 1924, and proclaimed on December 30 with Timoteo Paez as Soverano Gran Commendador.   It claimed jurisdiction over 27 Blue Lodges, one Lodge of Perfection, one Chapter Rosa Cruz, one Council of Kadosh and the corresponding Grand Consistory. 

It cannot be doubted that Filipino Masons are always united in any patriotic move. In many instances, they have shown their common interest for nationalism, they have worked harmoniously for the betterment and aggrandizement of their country, which our national hero Jose P. Rizal, called "The Pearl of the Orient". In thirty seven revolutions against the foreign yoke, Filipinos fought as one single person. In our last struggle for freedom which the benevolent Americans had generously returned to us on July 4, 1946, we were united as ever.

Masonically, Filipino Masons whether belonging to Gran Logia Nacional de Filipinas or to the Grand Lodge of Philippines have common aspirations;  ideal and spiritual love for their country not found nor may be expected from any alien who camr to the Philippines for fortune's sake. <ref; History of Freemasonry in the Philippines, Logia Magdalo-General Emilio Aguinaldo, Gran Logia Nacional de Filipinas, Supremo Consejo del Grado  33°  Para Filipinas (undated pamphlet)

Chula Lodge 9745 E.C was the first UGLE. English Lodge consecrated in Thailand. Chula Lodge meets in Bangkok four times per year and as of 2014 there were two additional English lodges meeting regularly in Phuket and Pattaya. Chula Lodge’s workings place great emphasis on the three Great Principles of Freemasonry; Brotherly Love, Relief and Truth and their meaning in the search for the missing secrets of a Master Mason.

Turkey 

In Turkey Freemasonry was introduced by foreign merchants in the eighteenth century (1721) and was outlawed by Mahmud I in 1748, although it slowly came back and Freemasons were exiled as part of a crackdown on the Bektashis in 1826.

A Grand Orient was formed in 1909.  Freemasonry was suppressed from 1935 to 1948.

A schism occurred in 1964, with a small group of freemasons creating the Grand Lodge of Liberal Freemasons of Turkey, which later attached itself to the Grand Orient de France
