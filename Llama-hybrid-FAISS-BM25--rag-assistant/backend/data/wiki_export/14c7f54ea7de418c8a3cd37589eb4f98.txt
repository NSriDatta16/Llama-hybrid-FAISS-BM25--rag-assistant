Academics

The private four-year college has evolved with an open admissions policy and enrolls approximately 1,991 students.

While the college offers a variety of traditional academic programs, many of its popular majors are centered on vocations, such as law enforcement, culinary arts, and accounting. Lackawanna has invested in several Health Sciences programs including Cardiac Sonography, Diagnostic Medical Sonography, Vascular Technology, Physical Therapist Assistant, Occupational Therapy Assistant, and Surgical Technology. Lackawanna has established transfer agreements with a number of colleges in Pennsylvania and is part of the state's academic passport system.

Industry-specific degrees were created at the School of Petroleum and Natural Gas to fill the demand of the Marcellus Shale career opportunities in the work force. According to "Petroleum-schools.com", Lackawanna College ranks seventh in Pennsylvania among top academic petroleum programs. Those programs were moved to the college's new Tunkhannock Center upon its opening in the Fall 2021 semester.

Lackawanna College also operates police academies at its Scranton campus and Hazleton Center. The academy was originally certified by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania through the Municipal Police Officersâ€™ Education and Training Commission in Harrisburg, on April 21, 1977. Lackawanna is the first and continues to be the only private college in Northeastern Pennsylvania authorized to provide police education and training.

As of July 1, 2020, Lackawanna's president is Dr. Jill Murray, who succeeded former Lackawanna College president Colonel Mark Volk. The college is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.
