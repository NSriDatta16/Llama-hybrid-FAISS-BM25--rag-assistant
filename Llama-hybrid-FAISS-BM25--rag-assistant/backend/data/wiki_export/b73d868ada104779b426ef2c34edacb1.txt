The World Horror Convention Grand Master Award is a yearly distinction given to an author who has contributed greatly to the field of horror literature.  Nominees must be alive at the time of voting and can not have previously won the award. The award is given at the annual World Horror Convention.

After 2016, there were no World Horror Conventions organized, and no World Horror Convention Grand Master Awards were given since. The Bram Stoker Awards are still presented annually to horror writers by the Horror Writers Association.
