He is part of the Torrance family of Scottish theologians. His uncle was the famous theologian Thomas F.

Torrance was professor at Aberdeen and wrote the influential Worship, Community and the Triune God of Grace. His uncle David W. Torrance was a Church of Scotland minister and author, until his retirement in 1991. His cousin is Iain Torrance, former president of Princeton Theological Seminary, Pro-Chancellor of the University of Aberdeen and Dean of the Chapel Royal in Scotland, and another former Moderator of the General Assembly. His uncle, Ronald Wallace, was Professor of Biblical Theology at Columbia Theological Seminary. Alan Torrance's sons have continued in the theological and academic line.

His teaching interests are primarily in the areas of philosophical and systematic theology, theological anthropology, person and work of Christ and theological ethics.  He researches actively in the fields of Christology, the social implications of the doctrine of reconciliation, theological epistemology and theories of time.  He is widely published and respected in his field and now closely associated with the Logos Institute for Analytic and Exegetical Theology at the University of St Andrews.
