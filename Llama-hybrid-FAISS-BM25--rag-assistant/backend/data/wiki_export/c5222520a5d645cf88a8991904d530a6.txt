The Peugeot 308 is a small family car (C-segment car; compact car in North America) produced by French automobile manufacturer Peugeot. It was unveiled in June 2007, and launched in September 2007. The 308 replaced the 307, and positioned below the 508 and above the smallest 208.

The 308 is followed by a coupé cabriolet (the 308 CC) for the 2009 model year, a station wagon (the 308 SW) in March 2008, and a sedan version (the 408) in China for the 2012 model year.

The first generation was largely based on its predecessor, the 307, and utilized modified versions of that car's drivetrain and chassis. The second-generation model was unveiled in 2013, and it was awarded as the 2014 European Car of the Year. The third-generation model was unveiled in 2021 and introduced a hybrid powertrain.



First generation (T7; 2007)

Design
Launched as the replacement for the Peugeot 307 in most international markets, the new vehicle was based upon the old 307's chassis, but has new bodywork and is slightly longer and wider. Developed under the project code "Project T7", ts coefficient of drag is 0.29, and it has a five-star rating on Euro NCAP. Following the facelift of March 2011, the drag factor was reduced to 0.28.

The 308 HDi holds the Guinness world record of the most fuel efficient mainstream car currently in production, having averaged  over a distance of , but Peugeot ran foul of British advertising rules by referencing a fuel consumption of  in an advert for the car.

The 308 is manufactured in France at the Mulhouse and Sochaux factories. It is also manufactured in Kaluga, Russia, for the local market, since 2010, and El Palomar, Argentina, for the South American market since 2011. 

The car attracted minor criticism in right-hand drive markets as the windscreen wiper mechanism was unchanged from the design for left-hand drive vehicles, meaning a large unwiped area was present at the top of the windscreen on the driver's side, but was absent on the passenger side, as the driver's side wiper was shorter, and the passenger wiper "went up" first.

Body styles

Hatchback
The 308 was available as a five-door hatchback, with a three-door limited to a few markets. In May 2010, Peugeot announced the return of a  GTi model (known as the GT in the United Kingdom), featuring a turbocharged 1.6 L engine with .

Estate
A station wagon concept version of the 308, the Peugeot 308 SW Prologue, was also unveiled at the 2007 Frankfurt Motor Show. The production version was shown at the 78th International Geneva Motor Show in March 2008 and went on sale that summer. The 308 SW (or 308 Touring in Australia) was available in a five or seven-seat versions.

A further variation of the X08 chassis used by the 308 is an SUV or an MPV, named 3008.

Cabriolet
A cabriolet with a retractable hardtop known as the 308 CC replaced the Peugeot 307 CC in February 2009. The roof folds into the boot in twenty seconds, and at up to speeds of . With the roof up the boot space capacity is 465 litres but this reduces to 266 litres with the roof down.

Saloon
In September 2011, Peugeot presented, for the market in China, a four-door saloon (sedan) version of the 308. This version produced for the market in China by Dongfeng is based on 308 facelift, but differs from the model in Europe, with large front grille, more chrome on the hips and different shape of the LED tail lights. The interior is identical to the European model.

The engine range includes a petrol 1.6 16V 110 hp and 143 hp 2.0 16V. The trunk has a volume of 502 litres. The Peugeot 308 sedan, sold at 160.000 units in three years, joins the Peugeot 408 in China, a C segment car with a slightly higher price.

Facelift

A facelifted 308 was released in May 2011, following the public launch at the 2011 Geneva Motor Show, with a new front end and minor changes to the rear of the vehicle. Peugeot also launched the 308 e-HDI micro-hybrid model with stop-start technology, a system to recover energy during deceleration and a hybrid battery that delivers additional energy on startup.

A full hybrid 3008 was also announced at the same time. The version produced in South America is assembled with this facelift. The facelift was also given to the 308 SW and 308 CC.

Second facelift

As the EMP2 platform was not industrialized in South America, the first generation 308 continued to be marketed there and received a second facelift in 2015.
The front bumper is inspired by the 308 II (reduced front lights, Peugeot logo, and text, anti-fog lights, less contoured hood ...).

The interior undergoes some modifications to accommodate some elements of the 308 II. There is a touch screen perfectly integrated with the centre console, instead of the traditional CD / MP3 and empty pockets.

For some years, the 308 I was sold in Argentina alongside the European-built 308 II, locally named 308 S.

As it counterpart the first generation 408, the first generation 308 stayed manufactured in Argentina until 2021, when it was discontinued without any local or imported direct replacement.

Concepts

308 Hybrid
Bosch announced in June 2007 that it was supplying hybrid diesel-electric technology to Peugeot for the 308. A prototype 308 equipped with this technology was displayed in the Frankfurt Motor Show of 2007, and a further 'Prologue' concept car was shown at the 2008 Paris Motor Show, featuring a 1.6 litre HDi engine to turn the front wheels, and an electric motor to turn the rears.
