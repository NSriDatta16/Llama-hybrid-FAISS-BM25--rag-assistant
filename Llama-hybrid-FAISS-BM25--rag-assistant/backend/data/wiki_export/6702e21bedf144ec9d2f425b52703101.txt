"Marconi Award" links here. Note that in the Netherlands, the radio academy awards are also called Marconi Awards.

The Marconi Radio Awards are presented annually by the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) to the top radio stations and on-air personalities in the United States. The awards are named in honor of Guglielmo Marconi, the man generally credited as the "father of wireless telegraphy". NAB member stations submit nominations.  A task force determines the finalists and the Marconi Radio Award Selection Academy votes on the winners, who receive their awards in the fall.
