She trained in Melbourne at the Chisholm Institute of Technology, and the Victorian College of the Arts. She became the Studio Head of Painting and Drawing at the South Australian School of Art, University of South Australia.

Her drawings have been frequently selected to hang in the Dobell Prize for Drawing at the Art Gallery of NSW. Her entry in 2001, Linen dress, was subsequently purchased by Margaret Olley and donated to the gallery.
