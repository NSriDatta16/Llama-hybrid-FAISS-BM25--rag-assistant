Filmmaking
Pressman began his filmmaking career by producing short videos for the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco, California. In 2013, he directed and produced the documentary film 50 Children: The Rescue Mission of Mr. and Mrs. Kraus, which premiered on HBO and tells the story of Gilbert and Eleanor Kraus, a Jewish couple from Philadelphia who traveled to Nazi Germany in 1939 and, with the help of the B'rith Sholom fraternal organization, saved Jewish children in Vienna from likely death in the Holocaust by finding them new homes in Philadelphia. The heroic Krauses were the grandparents of Pressman's wife, and the film is, in part, based on the manuscript of a memoir left behind by Eleanor Kraus when she died in 1989.  50 Children was nominated for a News & Documentary Emmy award in the category of Outstanding Historical Programming in 2014.

In 2020, Pressman directed and produced the documentary film Holy Silence, which tells the story of the Vatican's actions, and inactions, during the Holocaust and in the years leading up to it. The film was shown at several film festivals and had its television premiere on PBS in November 2020. The film features actor David Strathairn, who is heard as the voice of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and actor Marco Barricelli, who is heard as the voice of Pope Pius XII.

In 2022, Pressman directed and produced the documentary film The Levys of Monticello, which tells the story of a Jewish family that owned and preserved Thomas Jefferson's home for nearly 90 years in the decades that followed Jefferson's death in 1826. The film premiered at the Atlanta Jewish Film Festival in February 2022, where it received the Building Bridges Jury Prize award. The film also received the Audience Award for Best Documentary at the Washington DC Jewish Film Festival in May 2022.
