San Francisco is an American monthly magazine devoted to the people, culture, food, politics, and arts of the San Francisco Bay Area. It is published monthly by Modern Luxury publications.

History
There have been two separate San Francisco magazines published in San Francisco. One was started in the 1970s and published for many years, under a series of different publishers, until it went out of business around 1985.

The magazine known as San Francisco has its roots starting in 1955, when San Francisco public broadcasting station KQED-TV began publishing a programming guide called KQED in Focus. The program guide began to add more articles and took on the character of a regular magazine. The name was later changed to Focus Magazine and then to San Francisco Focus. In 1984, a new programming guide, Fine Tuning was separated off from Focus, with Focus carrying on as a self-contained magazine.

San Francisco Focus was the recipient of a National Headliner Award for feature writing in 1993.  In 1996, KQED sold San Francisco Focus to Diablo Publications in order to pay off debts.  The magazine was spun off into an independent entity in January 1997. In October 1997, the magazine re-branded itself as simply San Francisco. In 1999, new management took over and Editor-In-Chief Bruce Kelley arrived in June 2000. Under Kelley's leadership, San Francisco has won two of the magazine publishing industry's most prestigious award, National Magazine awards for General Excellence (2010, 2018), and it has garnered three Maggies as Best City and Regional Magazine from the Western Publications Association (2006, 2007 and 2009). In 2005, San Francisco was sold to Modern Luxury Media (a nationwide conglomerate of city and lifestyle magazines).

Steven Dinkelspiel stepped to the head of San Francisco magazine as the publisher in March 1999 after working as both circulation director and general counsel for the magazine. After the merge of the magazine with Modern Luxury, he became its president. Jon Steinberg became editor-in-chief of the magazine in February 2012, before which he was a Senior Editor at New York magazine.

In April 2019, Modern Luxury announced that Walter J. Kupiec, a media and marketing veteran, was hired as Market President and Publisher.

Michael McCarthy is the current editor-in-chief.
