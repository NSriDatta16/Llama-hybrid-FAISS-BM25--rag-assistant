Tom Forman (February 22, 1893 â€“ November 7, 1926) was an American motion picture actor, director, writer, and producer of the early 1920s.

Life and career 
Texas-born Forman made his first film for Jesse L. Lasky's production company in 1914. With the exception of service at the front during World War I, he had a successful career as both an actor and director. Forman directed Lon Chaney's Shadows (1922), but his biggest achievement was realised directing the second screen version of Owen Wister's The Virginian (1923).  After his career faltered, he was reduced to working on cheap Poverty Row melodramas.  Forman is also known for his work with Edith Taliaferro in Young Romance.

Forman was set to direct the Columbia film The Wreck, which was to start shooting on November 8, 1926; however on the evening of November 7, Forman died by suicide by shooting himself through the heart at his parents' home in Venice, California.

Adela Rogers St. Johns based the character of Maximillan Carey in her original story for What Price Hollywood? (1932) on Forman.

Family 
He was a cousin of silent screen star Madge Bellamy.
