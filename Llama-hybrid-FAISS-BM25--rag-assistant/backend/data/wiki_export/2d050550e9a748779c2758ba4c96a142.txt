Club Deportivo Coronel Bolognesi is a Peruvian football club located in the city of Tacna. Originally founded on 18 October 1929, It was named after Francisco Bolognesi. Years later, a second branch of the club called Club Sport Bolito, was founded on 27 May 1998. 

The club quickly surpassed its older counterpart's achievements and, following its success in 2001 Copa Perú, the president's club Elena Martorell (Fernando Martorell's sister, then president of CD Coronel Bolognesi), decided to change the club's name to Coronel Bolognesi Fútbol Club, in order to further identify both clubs's identities and share their successes. The identity confusion escalated since Coronel Bolognesi FC's international performances in the 2000s and 2010s, and hence generated much controversy about whether they're the same club or not.
