Jodi Leigh Miller is an American female bodybuilder and figure competitor.

Biography
Miller, a bodybuilder and figure competitor, was born in Chicago, Illinois on November 8, 1972, and currently resides in Dallas, Texas.  She graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a BA in English and a Secondary Teaching Certification, and earned certification as a personal trainer from the Cooper Institute in Dallas.  In the mid-1990s, her interest in powerlifting led her to try her hand in competition. She won first place in her first two powerlifting appearances, and began to consider competing in other fields. She is also an accomplished kickboxer. By the early 2000s she had been successful in sporting challenges and turned to bodybuilding, along with fitness and figure competition.

In 2001, Miller began competing in events for the NPC, an affiliate of the IFBB and the largest amateur bodybuilding organization in the United States.  She won her division and the overall champion title in her first event, and since then has gradually gained repute on the national level.  Miller actively markets herself through the Internet, and has attracted sponsorship from several national sporting equipment and apparel companies.  She has also written as a guest columnist for Oxygen magazine.  Miller is a former public school teacher as well.

In 2006, Miller transitioned back to bodybuilding.  She won the lightweight class in the amateur bodybuilding division of the Europa Supershow.  That qualified her to compete in the bodybuilding Nationals, where she placed eighth in the lightweight class.

Miller's transition into bodybuilding has been a successful one.  She won the lightweight division of the 2007 Team Universe, the only drug-tested NPC event at the national level.  This qualified her for the IFBB Women's Amateur Bodybuilding World Championships, held in Santa Susana, Spain, on September 21.  She placed 13th in a field of 16 women in the <55 kg category.
