Pasir Ris Bus Interchange is a bus interchange located at Pasir Ris in the eastern part of Singapore. It is located off Pasir Ris Drive 3, adjacent to Pasir Ris MRT station and near White Sands Shopping Centre. This bus interchange also serves as a pick-up/drop-off point for shuttle buses ferrying NSF men heading to the SAF Ferry Terminal for their shuttle ferry to Pulau Tekong.

History
The interchange was built at a cost of S$2.7 million and opened on 10 December 1989, along with the Eunos Bus Interchange. The interchange provides bus connections around the Pasir Ris estate. Bus Service 403 was the first bus route in Pasir Ris from 1979, which previously terminated at Tampines Road terminus before being amended to the current route of looping at Pasir Ris Road.
