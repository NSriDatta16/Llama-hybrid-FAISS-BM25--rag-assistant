Thomas Balch (Leesburg, Virginia, July 23, 1821 — Philadelphia, March 29, 1877) was an American historian, best known for his work on the American Revolutionary War, originally written in French and later translated into English as The French in America during the War of Independence of the United States, 1777-1783.

He was married to Emily Swift Balch (1832-1917) of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Mrs. Balch was a member of the Acorn Club of Philadelphia, and the Colonial Dames of America.

Thomas Balch has been called the "father of international arbitration" for his work in popularizing this peaceful mechanism of international dispute resolution (see Thomas Balch Library).

Thomas Balch died March 29, 1877, in Philadelphia, and was buried at the Old Trinity Church.

Thomas Balch Library
In 1922, a library was constructed in Leesburg, Virginia, as a memorial to Thomas Balch, a Leesburg native, and was named "The Thomas Balch Library." Thomas Willing Balch (1866-1927) and Edwin Swift Balch (1856-1927), sons of Thomas Balch, originally endowed the subscription library.
