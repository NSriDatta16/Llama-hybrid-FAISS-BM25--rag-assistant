Polly and the Pirates is an independent comic book series written and illustrated by Ted Naifeh (with volume 2 being illustrated by Robbi Rodriguez) and released through Oni Press.

This is a miniseries of comic books (also available as a graphic novel) from Ted Naifeh. Polly Pringle is a sheltered young girl who lives at a boarding school and has no desire to go on any adventuresâ€”unlike her friend Anastasia, who describes Polly as "the dullest girl I've ever met". But one night Polly gets swept up in an adventure when she is captured by the former crew of the famous Pirate Queen Meg Malloy.

The setting is an alternate-history version of San Francisco in the second half of the 19th century. Polly's boarding school is a house boat that looks like a huge Victorian-style home. The Golden Age of Piracy is now over, but Claudio, the son of the pirate king, is trying to follow in his father's footsteps.
