The AAA Commonwealth District is a high school conference in the state of Virginia that includes schools from Stafford and Spotsylvania counties. AAA is the largest enrollment class of the Virginia High School League and also typically the most competitive level in Virginia high school sports.

The Commonwealth District schools competed in the AAA Northwest Region with the schools from the AAA Cardinal District, the AAA Cedar Run District, and the AAA Western Valley District until the 2013 VHSL District Reclassification.
