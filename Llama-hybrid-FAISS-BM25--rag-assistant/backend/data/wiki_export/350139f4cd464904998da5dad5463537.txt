Thorntree is a housing estate in east Middlesbrough, North Yorkshire, England. The former Thorntree Ward's population was 6,290, at the 2011 census. Since 2015, the estate shares a ward with Brambles Farm.

The housing estate was built in the late 1940s, in the lands of the former Thorntree Farm, after people started to move away from the terraced housing of Middlesbrough town centre and North Ormesby. It has a public park called Thorntree Park. The main roads of the estate are College Road and The Greenway.

Thorntree Ward had a population of 5,000 and was identified as the 3rd most deprived (out of 8,414) housing ward in England, in 2000. Since the Index of Multiple Deprivation started measuring smaller output areas with a mean population of 1,500, the three areas of Thorntree later ranked 192nd, 205th and 378th most deprived (out of 34,412) in England respectively.

Along with the Brambles Farm area, Thorntree was identified as the ward with the highest proportion of votes to Leave in the Brexit referendum of 2016. 82.5% of local residents voted to leave the EU while 17.5% supported remaining.

History
Much of Thorntree stands on what used to be a farmland. In all,  of Thorntree Farm and  of Low Bottoms Farm were purchased as land on which to site the estate.
