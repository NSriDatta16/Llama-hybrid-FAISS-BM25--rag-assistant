This followed an incident involving the club captain Paul Wotton.

Three weeks after leaving Plymouth Argyle, he was signed for Millwall by manager Nigel Spackman. On 21 March 2007, Zebroski joined Oxford United on a month's loan.

He was transferred to Wycombe Wanderers for £20,000 in June 2008. Zebroski finished the 2008–09 season with seven goals from 33 league matches, mostly from the wing, helping the team win promotion to League One. The start of the 2009–10 season saw Zebroski score two goals in a 3–2 defeat at Charlton Athletic.On 20 November 2009, Zebroski returned to Torquay United on loan with a view to permanent transfer in January.

He scored twice in a 5–0 home win against Darlington on 12 December and the move later became permanent.

After helping the club avoid relegation from League Two during the 2009–10 campaign, Zebroski scored 16 league goals to help the club finish seventh and reach the play-offs the following season. In the semi-final first leg versus Shrewsbury at Plainmoor, Zebroski scored the first goal to set up a 2–0 victory. The second leg finished 0–0, leaving Torquay to play Stevenage in the play-off final at Old Trafford. Stevenage won the match 1–0. In July 2011 he followed former Torquay manager Paul Buckle to his new club, Bristol Rovers.

In August 2012 Zebroski joined Cheltenham Town. His contract with Cheltenham was cancelled by mutual consent on 4 January 2013 after Zebroski withdrew from the matchday squad at short notice on a number of occasions.
