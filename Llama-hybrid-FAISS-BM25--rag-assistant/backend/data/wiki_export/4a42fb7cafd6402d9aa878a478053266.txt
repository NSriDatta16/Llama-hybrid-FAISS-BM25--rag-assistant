World Bowl XIV, officially known as Yello Strom World Bowl XIV, was the 2006 championship game of the NFL Europe League. It was held at the LTU arena in Düsseldorf, Germany on Saturday, May 27, 2006. The game was between the defending World Bowl champion Amsterdam Admirals, who finished the season in first place with a record of 7–3, and the second-placed Frankfurt Galaxy, who finished with a record of 7–3 as well. 36,286 people were in attendance, as the Galaxy stripped the Admirals of their title in a 22–7 victory. Frankfurt running back Butchie Wallace was named MVP of World Bowl XIV, by running 18 times for 143 yards (with his longest rush being 63 yards) and 1 touchdown.

This was the first World Bowl that wasn't played in June, as the league wanted to avoid a clash with the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Also, it marked the third-straight year that a team would fall in a World Bowl after winning the title in the previous year.
