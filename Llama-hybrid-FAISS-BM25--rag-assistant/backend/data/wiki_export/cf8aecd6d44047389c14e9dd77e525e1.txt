Motocross Madness is a motocross racing video game developed by Rainbow Studios and published by Microsoft.

A sequel, Motocross Madness 2, was released in 2000. In 2013, a sequel for Xbox 360 was released, titled Motocross Madness. In the game, one can earn money by utilizing "career mode", but play for fun in Baja, Stunts, Enduro, Supercross, and National levels as well.

Gameplay

The game is known for its realism, including terrain, audio, and "bone-chilling" motorcycle wrecks. If the player is in Stunt mode and goes out of bounds after climbing a large cliff, an "invisible slingshot" will cause the player and the bike fly across the map while a funny sound plays until both objects hit the ground. The "invisible slingshot" effect was also used in the game ATV Offroad Fury, also created by Rainbow Studios.

Development
The game went gold on July 24, 1998.

Reception

The game received favorable reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings.

The game sold 35,922 units during 1998. These sales accounted for $1.54 million in revenue that year.
