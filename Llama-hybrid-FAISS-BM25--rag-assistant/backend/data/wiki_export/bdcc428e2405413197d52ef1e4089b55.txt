Crucible is the second studio album by the heavy metal band Halford released in 2002. A remixed and remastered edition was released in 2010.  In contrast with the retrospective approach of the previous Halford album, Resurrection, Crucible was an intentional effort to depart from the traditional metal themes. The album has been described as "harder, darker, and more moody than Resurrection".
