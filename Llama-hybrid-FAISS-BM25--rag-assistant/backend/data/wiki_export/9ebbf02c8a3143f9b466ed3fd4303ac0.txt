History 
Historically, many local printing presses and old beef-brisket noodle shops were located on Gough Street. Kau Kee Restaurant, is a notable noodle shop that specialises in beef brisket noodles in clear soup (清湯牛腩) located there. In the last several years, a lot of the printing presses moved to other areas and new restaurants and bars began to move into the premises vacated by the printing presses. Now, the street has many international fashion brands and high-end home furnishings.
