The Mosque of Omar Ibn Al-Khattab (Spanish transcription Omar Iban Al-Jattab) is a mosque in Maicao, La Guajira, Colombia. It is the third largest mosque in Latin America.

Along with the Dar Alarkan School, they are the centers for the Islamic faith and culture in the region. The mosque was constructed on 17 September 1997, and named after the second caliph Omar Ibn Al-Khattab. It was designed by the Iranian architect Ali Namazi and built by the civil engineer Oswaldo Vizcaino Fontalvo who used Italian marble for its construction. It can easily accommodate over 1,000 people.
