The North York Rangers are a Junior "A" ice hockey team located in the North York district of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. They are a part of the South Division of the Ontario Junior Hockey League (OJHL) and were previously a part of the Metro Junior A Hockey League.

History
The Metro Junior "B" level Woodbridge Rangers moved to North York in 1967, renaming the team the North York Rangers. They advanced to the "A" league until 1972, winning several league titles before folding in 1985. When the Richmond Hill Rams Metro Junior "A" team moved to North York in 1992, they brought back the North York Rangers name. Seven seasons later, the league folded, and the North York Rangers were brought into the OJHL, where they continue to play as of 2017.
