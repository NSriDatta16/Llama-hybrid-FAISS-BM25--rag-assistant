The International Fritz Kreisler Competition is a violin competition dedicated to the memory of violinist and composer Fritz Kreisler.

Founded in 1979, it is carried out every four years in Vienna, Austria. It is limited to violinists of or under 30 years of age.  To avoid favoritism, the members of the jury may not enter their own students in the contest.
