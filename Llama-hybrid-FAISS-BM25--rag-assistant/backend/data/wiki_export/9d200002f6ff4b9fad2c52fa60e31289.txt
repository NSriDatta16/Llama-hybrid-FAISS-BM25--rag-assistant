Personal life
He married Vasiliki Panagiotopoulou and had three children.

In 2014, he decided to move his family from Athens to Zurich after his political fights with Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and many previous governments in order to protect his family. His numerous scandals and political power required him to be accompanied by bodyguards and bulletproof cars daily in order to ensure his safety in Athens. 

He died on 22 January 2019 in Zurich after fighting with cancer for 1.5 years.

Involvement with justice
In January 2009, he was sentenced to 19 months in prison with a suspended sentence for exchanging Christos Zahopoulos's sex tape as well for publishing photos in "Thema" that presented Christos Zahopoulos in private moments. Finally, in April 2013, the three-member Court of Appeal unanimously acquitted Anastasiadis and the others involved for breach of personal data, judging that the DVD was never processed and classified by him.

On December 4, 2012, criminal prosecution was brought against him for tax evasion and money laundering in the amount of 5.5 million euros. The case started in 2007 when Themos Anastasiadis walked into a bank in Zurich with tens of millions of euros stuffed in garbage bags accompanied by bodyguards. He was initially acquitted, but in 2017 his personal belongings were seized and he was fined, paying approximately €15 million in public debt for laundering money derived from criminal activities in 2007. Anastasiadis argued that the SYRIZA government had targeted him and the decision to fine him was political.
