From 1947, Severin worked in Flight Research Institute in Zhukovsky, where he was occupied with research and flight test of the aircraft crew rescue and in-flight refuelling systems. A collective of engineers led by Severin worked out some major principles and working prototypes of landing systems and rocket emergency escape slides for Vostok spacecraft.

From 1964, Severin served as Chief Designer, General Designer and, eventually, General Director of the joint-stock company NPP Zvezda, located in Tomilino.

Under his direction, the company developed ejection seats (including well-known K-36), space-suits, life support systems and rocket emergency escape slides for USSR/Russia aircraft, spacecraft and orbiting space stations (starting from Vostok 1 and the special inflatable EVA airlock of the Voskhod 2), an open space manoeuvring unit, etc.

He participated in preparations for Yuri Gagarin's and other Soviet cosmonauts space flights on Vostok, Voskhod and Soyuz spacecraft.
