Amen. is the third studio album by Paula Cole. It is officially credited to "The Paula Cole Band." The album was stylistically a major departure from Cole's previous album, This Fire, and was met with mixed reviews. Commercially, the album failed to match the success of This Fire, peaking at #92 on the Billboard 200 chart, and selling 116,000 copies to date.

The album did, however, score a moderate Adult Top 40 radio format hit with "I Believe In Love", which peaked at #22. A remix made for dance clubs and rhythmic radio format peaked at #18 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play, and also attained moderate airplay.
