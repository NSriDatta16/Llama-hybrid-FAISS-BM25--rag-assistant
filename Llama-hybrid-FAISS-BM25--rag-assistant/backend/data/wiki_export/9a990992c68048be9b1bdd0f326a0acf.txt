Tooke is an Old English name originally found predominantly in the East Anglia region of the United Kingdom.Tooke is said to be derived "from the Old Swedish (pre 7th century Old Scandinavian origin)  personal name "Toki". Toki remained a personal name from the Old Scandinavian, through the Anglo-Norman, and Middle English periods.

Etymology

Tooke is said to be derived "from the Old Swedish (pre 7th century Old Scandinavian origin)  personal name "Toki", itself claimed to be short form (in Latin a diminutive or in Greek a hypocoristicon) of "Thorkettill" translating as "Thors cauldron", although some sources suggest the derivation is from "Tiodgeir", meaning "people-spear".". Toki remained a personal name from the Old Scandinavian, through the Anglo-Norman, and Middle English periods.
Two runestone inscriptions contain the personal name Toki: the Gunderup Runestone and the Sjörup Runestone. The personal name Thorkell is mentioned in two sagas: Hrafnkel's Saga and the Laxdale Saga.

"Thorkettill"  translating as "Thors cauldron" is a reference to the Norse myth that thunder was made by Thor riding around in a chariot full of kettles.

"According to Helene Adeline Guerber, "in Southern Germany the people, fancying a brazen chariot alone inadequate to furnish all the noise they heard, declared it was loaded with copper kettles, which rattled and clashed, and therefore often called him, with disrespectful familiarity, the kettle-vendor."".

Also in the Norse sagas there is a story in which Thor is looking for a "kettle large
enough to brew ale for all the Æsir at one time.".

Distribution 

Tooke in 1881 census (in individuals)

Tuck in 1881 census (in individuals)

The Old-Swedish source of Tooke seems to be confirmed by its distribution in England. Tooke is overwhelmingly prevalent in Norfolk, then Suffolk; areas that were part of the Viking Danelaw. References to Thor hit a "high popularity during the Viking Age". Compared with their Anglo- Saxon neighbours, the Vikings favoured Thor, instead of Woden. Also, Tooke is derived from "Old Swedish" (pre-7th-century Old Scandinavian origin) rather than the related "Old English".

Tuck is far less localized; its largest concentration is also in Norfolk, but it is found throughout England. It is also far more common a surname than Tooke.

There are few records in the Norman period of English history. However we do have the Domesday Book of 1086. The book was a survey of the land, and land ownership before and after the Norman conquest. In the database provided  by PASE Domesday there are twenty three people of the name Toki and its variants to be found in the Domesday records. These are only men who held land, which was only a small segment of the population.

History

Tuck and Tooke, of East Anglia: Norfolk, and Suffolk

The Tookes from Norwich appear to associate themselves (using their arms) with the landed Toke family of Godinton Kent, which claims descent from Robert de Toke, who was present with Henry III at the Battle of Northampton (1264).

Most Norfolk Tookes would be more of local origin. Dr. Robert Liddiard in his thesis Landscapes of Lordship: Norman Castles and the Countryside in Medieval Norfolk, 1066-1200  suggests there were "a maximum of five and a minimum of three individuals called Toki who held land in Norfolk on the eve of the [Norman] conquest".

One Toki (in particular) was rather prominent Toki 11 antecessor of William de Warenne. "Toki was one of England's wealthiest lords, ranking fortieth in terms of wealth as recorded in Domesday Book TRE."
Toki and his family lost their position, after the fall of the Anglo-Saxons at the Battle of Hastings.

Lords and Communities in Early Medieval East Anglia describes that he was a King's Thane A Thane was "a rank of nobility in pre-Norman England, roughly equivalent to baron.". "The thanes in England were formerly persons of some dignity; there were two orders, the king's thanes, who attended the kings in their courts and held lands immediately of them, and the ordinary thanes, who were lords of manors and who had particular jurisdiction within their limits. After the [Norman] Conquest, this title was disused, and baron took its place.".

Toka of Norfolk 

The Ketts of Norfolk, a yeoman family suggests that the Ketts are descended from a Toka/i "francigena" and his family who held numerous lordships of the manor in Norfolk in the reign of Edward the Confessor, as mentioned above.

More on Toka: Deep ancestral history 
"The Danish origin of the Ketts is indicated in the name of Godwin, and the pedigree goes back to him. Having regard to the date 1225, it would make 1140 a probable date for Godwin's birth. It seems unlikely that any documentary evidence now exists that will prove an earlier generation. We have Domesday compiled 1086. From the scarcity of surnames in that record no clear reference to the Ketts of East Anglia is forthcoming, but christian names similar to those of the earliest recorded members of the Kett family have been found. They have been abstracted from the Norfolk Domesday and closely analysed. It is worth noting that the association of one group of Godwins, Hughs, and Huberts indicates a probable derivation from Toka, a " francigena " or foreigner (another word is used for Frank or Frenchman). This Toka was born about 960 A.D. These men were tenants of the de Morleys and the previous holders of de Morley lands. The following pedigree is appended, for what it is worth, as being reasonably probable...".
