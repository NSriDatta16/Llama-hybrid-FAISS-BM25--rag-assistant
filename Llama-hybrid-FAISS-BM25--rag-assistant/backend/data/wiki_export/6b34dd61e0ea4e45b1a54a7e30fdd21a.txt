History
For a long time, the Herre river was an important source of jobs for the people of the village. In the late 1600s, with the opening of the Bolvik ironworks, Herre was established as one of Telemark's oldest industrial areas. In the 1850s, a coal mill was established just outside Herre, at Hellestvedt. In the early twentieth century, Compagnie Française de Mines de Bamble (later known as Norwegian Bamble A/S) was established in Herre to mine the large apatite deposits. Compagnie Française de Mines de Bamble was at the time one of Norway's biggest industrial companies. In 1907, Bamble's first power station was opened at Kongens Dam. Bamble Cellulosefabrikk was also an important workplace for the people of Herre from 1888 to 1978.
