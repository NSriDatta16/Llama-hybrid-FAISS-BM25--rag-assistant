Marianne is a female name. It is the French version of the Greek Mariamne, which is a variant of Mary, ultimately from the Hebrew Miriam (מִרְיָם Miryám), Mirjam (Aramaic: Mariam). In late Greek Marianna (Μαριάννα) was used.

In 18th century France Marianne became a popular name as a variant of Marian, Marie. It can also be seen as a combination of Marie and Anne. It gave inspiration to several double names such as Marie-Anne, Anne-Marie as well as other variants such as Anna Maria, Ana-Maria and Marianna and alternate spellings Mary Ann and Mary Anne. The combination of the two names has also been popular with Christians because Saint Anne is traditionally the name of the mother of the Virgin Mary.
