Wenyukela is an album by the South African isicathamiya group Ladysmith Black Mambazo. The album was expected to have (and it did have) a solemn touch; it was the first album release after the murder of leader Joseph Shabalala's wife Nellie, in May 2002. It was released on 5 March 2003. A British version with four extra tracks was released under the title Raise Your Spirit Higher: Wenyukela. An American version titled Raise Your Spirit Higher was released in January 2004.
