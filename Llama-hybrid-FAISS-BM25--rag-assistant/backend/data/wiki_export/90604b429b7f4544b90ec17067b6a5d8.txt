The Jug Bay Wetlands Sanctuary is located along the tidal Patuxent River in southern Maryland, United States.  It was established in 1985 and is operated by the Anne Arundel County Department of Recreation and Parks.  It includes more than  of tidal freshwater wetlands, forests, meadows and fields.  The wetlands, with large stands of aquatic plants including wild rice, are home to many birds, fish, reptiles, amphibians, and mammals. Miles of trails and boardwalks traverse a variety of habitats and provide glimpses into the rich history of the region. Notably, archaeologists have uncovered evidence of a large Native American settlement at Jug Bay which spanned 2 miles along the Patuxent, with the oldest arrowhead-like artifact dated between 8,000 to 8,900 years old.

In 1990, the Sanctuary became a component of the Chesapeake Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve System. The sanctuary is also recognized as a Nationally Important Bird Area by the American Bird Conservancy and the National Audubon Society. Jug Bay is located within the Atlantic Flyway and is a haven for more than 100 species of birds, including native and migratory waterfowl, songbirds, and raptors.

The goals of the sanctuary are to provide environmental education opportunities to the public, to conduct ecological research, and to conserve Jug Bay's unique ecosystem. Several hundred volunteers act as docents and guides to the public and assist with long-term ecological studies.

The sanctuary is located in Bristol, Maryland,  from the mouth of the  long river.  The Wetlands Center is at , three miles (5 km) southeast of Upper Marlboro and six miles (10 km) west of Lothian, with a mailing address of 1361 Wrighton Road, Lothian, MD 20711.  It is  southwest of Annapolis and  southeast of Washington, DC.
