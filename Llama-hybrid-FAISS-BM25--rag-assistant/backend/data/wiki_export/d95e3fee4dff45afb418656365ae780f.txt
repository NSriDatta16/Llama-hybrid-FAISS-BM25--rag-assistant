The Eastern Football Netball League (known previously as the Eastern Districts Football League and later the Eastern Football League) is an Australian rules football league, based in the eastern suburbs of metropolitan Melbourne.

History 
The Eastern Districts Football League was established on 15 February 1962, but its origins can be traced back to the Reporter District Football League established in 1903.

From 1927 until World War 2, the league was known as the Ringwood District Football League. It was known as the Croydon District Football League and the Croydon Mail Football League between World War 2 and 1949. In 1950 the league became known as the Croydon-Ferntree Gully League.

In 1997, the Eastern District Football League and the Knox Junior Football Association united to create the Eastern Football League.

Following a restructure during 2018, the league now consists of five divisions, and 2019 had 45 clubs. Premier and First Division had 10 clubs each, Second and Third Divisions have eight clubs each, and Fourth Division has nine with the admission of Croydon North-MLOC for 2019. After the conclusion of the 2019 season, on 15 October the league announced a re-branding to the Eastern Football Netball League, recognising netball as a key part of the league structure.

On 3 June 2020, the EFNL cancelled its 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

With the admission of Beaconsfield and Oakleigh District for 2022, there are now 48 clubs, including 12 in the Premier Division.
