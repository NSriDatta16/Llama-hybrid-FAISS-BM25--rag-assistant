Live Hardcore Worldwide is a live album released by Boogie Down Productions. It is a career-spanning collection that was recorded in the US, Paris and London. The release features KRS-One prominently. 

In his review for The Source Chris Wild wrote "BDP fans should buy this album. So should anyone who is interested in what a real hip-hop show sounds like."  Mark Cooper of Q Magazine noted that the release "features KRS-1 (sic) at his hectoring, militant best in front of audiences who are too often rather subdued in the mix".
