X Vietnam or Por Vietnam is an album by Quilapayún released in 1968. This was among the first albums to be released under the DICAP label and was a success upon its release in Chile. The music and subject matter of the recording is very internationalist and was the first recording success of the Nueva Canción Chilena.

The album opens with a song denouncing the war in Vietnam, has songs from the Spanish Revolution, Afro-Cuban rhythms, an Italian folk song, a Soviet youth anthem and a song by Juan Capra that mourns the death of Che Guevara. Songs by Violeta Parra and Sergio Ortega inter alia with the local folkloric rhythms and social themes complete the album. The song "Los Pueblos Americanos" by Violeta Parra denounces disputes over national boundaries and calls on Latin America to unite. Sergio Ortega’s "Cueca de Joaquín Murieta" is based on the mythological character of Joaquín Murieta. One version of his legend states that he travels to California during the gold rush from Chile; finds wealth and love then loses everything and embarks on a vindictive vendetta against those who ruined him. Ultimately the Chilean outlaw, Murieta,is apprehended and is decapitated by what could be the KKK. The song "Canto a la pampa" depicts the poverty and bleak existence of mining communities of the north of Chile.
