Geography

Location  
Namborn is located in a low wooded mountain range between the rivers Nahe and Blies in the Saar-Hunsrück Nature Park. The highest elevation is the Friedenberg in Hirstein at 509 m; the lowest point is 298 m in Urweiler, where the Todbach leaves Namborn for St. Wendel. Recognized natural monuments are the Wendalinushöhle (Wendelin's cave) in Baltersweiler, a historic Linden tree in Furschweiler, the Allerbach rock wall in Namborn, and 3 Oaks in Roschberg.

Political organization
Namborn is composed of the following ten districts: Baltersweiler, Eisweiler, Furschweiler, Gehweiler, Heisterberg, Hirstein, Hofeld-Mauschbach, Namborn, Pinsweiler, and Roschberg.

Natural conservancy
The Schlossberg, an approximately 10 hectare area in the Eisweiler district, has been protected since February 1937 because of the occurrence of several rare plant species, and since November 1957 as a nature reserve (Naturschutzgebiet ), making it the oldest nature reserve in Saarland. Since November 1983 there is a second reserve of 19.68 ha, Weiherbruch und Rohrbachwiesen , in the Namborn district and the neighboring community of Oberthal. 
Additionally, parts of the districts of Heisterberg, Hirstein, Hofeld-Mauschbach, Namborn and Pinsweiler belong to the landscape protection area of the St. Wendel district. The entire municipality of Namborn is located in the Saar-Hunsrück Nature Park.
Ordinances demarcating the flood plain of the Todbach and the Rohrbacher Wiesen water conservation area protect additional areas.

History
Numerous finds from the Celtic and Roman times, which were discovered or partially exposed in the communities of Baltersweiler, Eisweiler, Furschweiler, Bornerhof, Heisterberg, Hirstein, Namborn, and Roschberg, testify to an early settlement of the area. Liebenburg Castle, probably built around 1200 and first documented in 1220, is another indication of the importance of the area.

Over time the different parts of the district belonged to various regional authorities, and changed hands several times between French and German control. The district assumed its present composition following the administrative restructuring concluding in 1975.

Sister city
Since 1987 there has been a partnership between Namborn and the French town of Langeac in the Haute-Loire department of Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, some 800 km away.
