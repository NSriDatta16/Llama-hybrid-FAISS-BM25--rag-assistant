She was commissioned by John McCaw, Jr., an American businessman, who sold her to Russian businessman Roman Abramovich in 2002. Abramovich had her refitted to his own preferences by HDW in Kiel, Germany. This included an internal refit and the addition of a  swim platform.

In June 2006, Abramovich lost Le Grand Bleu in a bet to Eugene Shvidler. A mini refit in Port Canaveral, Florida in 2008 included a "green" wastewater treatment system.

In 2016, the boat underwent a refit at Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.

In March of 2022, Forbes reported that the yacht Le Grand Bleu was still owned by Shvidler. At 354 feet and registered in Bermuda, it had a value of $109 million. That March it was sanctioned by the UK and Australia, and on June 6, 2022, was recorded in Ponce, Puerto Rico.
