The Caledon Canadians are a defunct Junior "A" ice hockey team from Caledon, Ontario, Canada.  They were a part of the Metro Junior A Hockey League and were the only team in the "Metro" to win an Ontario Hockey Association Junior "A" Championship.

History
The Canadians took the place of the old Caledon Flyers.  The Flyers played in Caledon from 1976 until 1990 in the Mid-Ontario Junior C Hockey League.  In 1990, the team folded but after two seasons the Central Junior B Hockey League granted the town a new team.

The Canadians spent one season in the Central Junior "B" Hockey League before joining the Metro and one season after with the Ontario Provincial Junior A Hockey League.  The Canadians were owned by a creator of Trivial Pursuit, but folded the very successful team after a long feud with the Caledon City Council who controlled the local arena. 

In the 1994-95 season, the Canadians were ranked "Number 1" by the Canadian Junior A Hockey League as the top Tier II Junior "A" hockey team in all of Canada.  After winning the Metro Junior "A" title, they lost out to the Brampton Capitals of the Ontario Provincial Junior A Hockey League in a Round Robin for the Ontario Hockey Association title.  The other competitor in the championship was the Timmins Golden Bears of the Northern Ontario Junior Hockey League.

1994 OHA Champions
In the 1993-94 Playoffs, the Canadians made it all the way to the Metro finals but were swept by the Wexford Raiders 4-games-straight.  The ace in the hole was that the Canadians had already been granted hosting duties for the OHA Championship.  Up against the Orillia Terriers, Powassan Hawks, and Wexford, the Canadians made the final and defeated the Terriers 3-1 to win a birth into the Dudley Hewitt Cup.  At the Central Canadian in Timmins, Ontario, the Canadians bowed out in the Semi-final with a 4-3 overtime loss to the Thunder Bay Flyers.  The Flyers were defeated by the Chateauguay Elites of the Quebec Junior AAA Hockey League in the Dudley Hewitt Cup Final.
