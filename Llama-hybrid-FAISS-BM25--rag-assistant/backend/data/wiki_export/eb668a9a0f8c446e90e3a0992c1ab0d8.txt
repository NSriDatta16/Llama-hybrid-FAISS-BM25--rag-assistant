The Autumn Effect is the third studio album and major label debut by American alternative metal band 10 Years. It was released on July 22, 2005, by Republic and Universal Records. Featured on the album is the popular modern rock track "Wasteland" and two other singles: "Through the Iris" and "Waking Up".

Due to the success of "Wasteland", The Autumn Effect broke 10 Years into the mainstream and as of December 6, 2017, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

Album information
The album peaked at number 72 on the Billboard 200, and made a re-entry into the top 100 of the chart, based on the growing mainstream success of the single "Wasteland". The album as a whole has been frequently compared to the work of Tool, Deftones, and, to a lesser extent, Incubus.

Slightly different versions of the songs "Wasteland", "Through the Iris", and "Insects" all appeared on the 2004 album Killing All That Holds You.

The hidden track "Slowly Falling Awake" is after "The Autumn Effect", however not as a separate track.

There are two instrumental pieces in negative time prior to "Wasteland" and "Empires". They will automatically be played if the tracks prior to Wasteland and Empires ("Cast It Out" and "Through the Iris", respectively) are played. If played from an MP3 device or computer, these instrumental pieces will be on the same track as "Cast It Out" and "Through the Iris" and play after the songs are over.

Track listing

Note
 The Compact Disc release has the songs "Cast It Out" and "Through the Iris" with instrumentals at the end of each song, plus "Slowly Falling Awake" at the end of "The Autumn Effect". The digital download versions of the album (including the iTunes version) do not include these instrumentals or "Slowly Falling Awake".
