"The Circus" is a song by English synth-pop duo Erasure, released on 21 September 1987 as the band's seventh single overall. It is also the title track on their second studio album, The Circus (1987). Written by Erasure members Vince Clarke and Andy Bell, the song was a departure from the shiny pop of their six previous singles, creating a more down-tempo and melancholy mood. Essentially a synth-pop track, the music is accentuated by acoustic guitar and a continuous circus-like accordion. The lyrics touch on social issues, rare for the duo, and centre on the lament of "working men", whose bright futures and job securities are left shattered in the modern world of greedy corporations and technology. The song's distinctive and unusual sound is said to have been inspired by Bell hearing a record being played backwards. The album version clocks at 5.30 minutes, so it was remixed for single release to a much more radio-friendly 3:50 minutes. Mute Records issued it as the fourth and final single from the album. Despite its haunting quality and dark lyrical content, "The Circus" became Erasure's third UK Top 10 hit, peaking at number six.
