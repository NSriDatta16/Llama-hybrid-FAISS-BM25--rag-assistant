Stadion Miejski im. gen. Kazimierza Sosnkowskiego (English: General Kazimierz Sosnkowski Municipal Stadium) or Stadion Polonii Warszawa (English: Polonia Warsaw Stadium), known colloquially as K6, is a multi-purpose stadium in Warsaw, Poland.

It is currently used mostly for football matches, and is the home ground of Polonia Warsaw. The stadium was originally built in 1928. The East stand was thoroughly modernized in 2004.

The stadium was used as a training ground for UEFA Euro 2012, and is being upgraded to hold a larger audience. It currently holds 7,152 seats, subdivided as follows.

Stadium stands
 The main stand (capacity: 4,889 seats) is the best seating for any sports event held at the stadium, fully covered and considerably high.
 The east stand (concrete; capacity: 1,911 seats), popularly called trybuna kamienna (the "stone stand"), is the historic stand with steps made of stone, originally with standing room only. In 2004, the stand was fully reconstructed with overhead cover and the symbolic 1,911 seats, commemorating the date of the founding of the club.
