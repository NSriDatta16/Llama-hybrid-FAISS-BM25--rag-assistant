Eagle Air (Icelandic name: Flugfélagið Ernir) is an Icelandic airline. It is based at Reykjavík Airport and offers domestic flights, charter services, and adventure tours in Iceland.

History
Eagle Air was founded in 1970 by Hörður Guðmundsson and his family as a transportation and security link in the Westfjords, one of the most remote parts of Iceland. The airline's initial focus was on ambulance and mail services. Propeller-driven aircraft operated by Eagle Air included the Helio Courier, Britten-Norman Islander, Piper Aztec, Piper Chieftain, Cessna Titan, de Havilland Canada DHC-6-300 Twin Otter, Cessna 206 and Cessna 185. Eagle Air also had a domestic charter flight component, which moved into the international arena in the early 1980s. Eagle Air flew charters to airports in Iceland, Greenland, Scandinavia and Europe.

In the early 1990s, Eagle Air accepted key assignments from the International Red Cross to operate in Kenya, Sudan, Mozambique and Angola, delivering aid supplies to civil war stricken regions.

In 1995, Eagle Air moved its headquarters from Ísafjörður to Reykjavík after most of its airmail contracts were discontinued due to the opening of the Vestfjarðagöng tunnel. It later sold off most of its airplanes and turned in its air operator's certificate (AOC) but kept one plane along with other assets. The company was restarted in Reykjavík in 2003. In 2006 it reapplied for an AOC took over service to destinations where Air Iceland stopped flying. It began scheduled services to Árneshreppur, Bíldudalur, Höfn, and Sauðárkrókur, and in August 2010 to Heimaey in the Westman Islands. It now flies to Höfn and Húsavík.

On 27 February 2018, Birna Borg Gunnarsdóttir, the granddaughter of founder Hörður Guðmundsson, became the first female pilot in the airlines history.
