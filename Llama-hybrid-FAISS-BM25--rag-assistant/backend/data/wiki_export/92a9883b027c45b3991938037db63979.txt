He married former Miss America, Laura Kaeppeler, in April 2014. The couple's son, Benjamin, was born in May 2015. On July 10, 2019, Fleiss filed for divorce from Kaeppeler, citing irreconcilable differences.

Legal issues
In November 2014, Fleiss was criminally charged for harassing Baywatch star David Charvet and his wife, actress Brooke Burke; the case was eventually dismissed.
In July 2019, Fleiss' then-wife Laura Kaeppeler alleged that he physically assaulted her while she was pregnant after he "demanded she get an abortion", prompting the Kauai Police Department to lead a criminal investigation. Two weeks later, Kaeppeler dropped the assault charges and received a $10-million settlement.
