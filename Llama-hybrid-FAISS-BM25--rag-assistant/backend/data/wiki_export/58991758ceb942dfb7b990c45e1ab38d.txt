The Nanjing Metro is a rapid transit system serving the urban and suburban districts of Nanjing, the capital city of Jiangsu Province in the People's Republic of China.

Proposals for a metro system serving Nanjing first began in 1984, with approval by the State Planning Commission granted in 1994. Construction began on the initial 16-station Line 1 in 1999, and opened in 2005. The system has 13 lines and 218 stations running on  of track. It is operated and maintained by the Nanjing Metro Group Company. Future expansion plans include 30 lines set to open within the next few years, with several more awaiting approval to begin construction.

History

Early proposals
In 1984 the first serious proposal for construction of a subway appeared in the Municipal People's Congress. In April 1986, the Nanjing Integrated Transport Planning group was established to research on how to implement a subway system in Nanjing. In December 1986 the team published the "Nanjing Metro Initial Phase". The phase consists of a north–south line, east–west line and a diagonal Northwest to Southeast line. The three lines meet in the city center forming a triangle. A revision of the "Nanjing City Master Plan" in 1993 added another line through the urban core, and three light metro lines connecting Nanjing's suburbs in Pukou and the at time proposed new airport. In addition a suburban railway to Longtan was proposed. A 1999 report on "Nanjing city rapid rail transit network planning" further proposed six subway lines, two subway extensions and three light metro lines.

In 1994, the State Planning Commission approved the preparatory work for the subway only to have the entire metro project postponed in 1995 amid a national freeze on new metro projects.

Major changes were made to "Nanjing Urban Rail Transit Network Planning" in 2003. The new master plan consisted of 13 lines, of which nine are subway lines and four are light metro lines. The new Line 6 will be a loop line connecting all the urban radial lines. The plan retained the original lines 1, 2 and 3 from the previous plan. According to the new plan, the initial phase would consist of the completion of Metro Line 1 and 2 by 2010. Together the two lines will form a basic "cross" network. By 2020 the completion of Lines 1, 2, 3, and 4 was to form a more robust "pound" shaped (#) network. Longer-term plans include the construction of a loop line connecting all existing lines. The plan also identified four subway lines crossing the Yangtze river.

First line
The initial section of Line 1 from Maigaoqiao to Xiaohang received final official approval in 1999. In May 2000, the Experimental Station resumed construction with the entire Line 1 project in full construction in December.

A western extension of Line 1 from Xiaohang to a newly built stadium was fast tracked after Nanjing won hosting the National Games. Line 1's initial section and the western extension started trial operations on September 3, 2005, running from Maigaoqiao to Olympic Stadium with 16 stations and a total length of . The opening of the Nanjing Metro Line 1 gave Nanjing the sixth metro system in the Chinese mainland after Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen.

In the southern extension of Phase 2, Line 9 is expected to be extended all the way to Banqiao in the far south west of Nanjing.

Ticket system
Fares on the Nanjing Subway are distance-based. Fares range from 2 yuan (approx US$0.30) for journeys under 8 stations, to 4 yuan for longer journeys. There is a 5% discount for users of the Nanjing Public Utility IC Card. Fares can also be paid using Alipay.

Single tickets

Single journey tickets can be purchased from the ticket vending machine or at a ticket window. The ticket vending machine accepts both coins and bills (¥5 and ¥10).

Transit card

Apart from one-way tickets, fares can be paid with the Nanjing Public Utility IC Card, or Jinlingtong (). It can be purchased for a refundable fee of 25 yuan (about 3.8 dollars) and refilled at ticket booths inside the metro stations as well as many collaborative convenience stores throughout the city. The card can be used to pay for other means of public transportation, such as the city taxi and the city bus.

This transit card is similar to Beijing's Yikatong, and the Octopus card of Hong Kong's MTR.
