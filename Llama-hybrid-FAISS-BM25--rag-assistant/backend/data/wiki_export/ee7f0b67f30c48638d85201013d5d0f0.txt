History
Ebersbach an der Fils was first mentioned in 1170. In 1299, it became a possession of the County of Württemberg, which already owned property nearby.

Under the Kingdom of Württemberg, Göppingen's district was reorganized as , which became Landkreis Göppingen, its contemporary incarnation, in 1938. Ebersbach developed considerably after World War II, first spreading to the west of the city. The city expanded eastward, northeastward, and then westward in the 1980s. Ebersbach grew politically in the 1970s with the incorporation of the municipalities of Roßwälden in 1972 and Bünzwangen and Weiler ob der Fils in 1975.

Bünzwangen

Roßwälden was assigned to the district of Kirchheim unter Teck until 1938, when it was reassigned to the district of Göppingen.
