Foyleside Shopping Centre is a shopping centre in Derry, County Londonderry, Northern Ireland. Construction started in the early 1990s and the centre opened on 25 September 1995. As of April 2023 the centre is 98% let across 50 units. The centre is spread over a 6.99 acre site in the city centre of Derry. The centre is anchored by Marks & Spencer, Frasers & Dunnes Stores. 

The shopping centre is built into the centre of the city and although it is not on the bank, it does overlook the River Foyle.

History
The project to build a shopping centre in the North West of Northern Ireland which would become Foyleside was envisioned in 1988 as part of a powerful regeneration campaign for the City of Derry. It was the result of campaigning by local politicians to attract the attention and investment of private firms. According to a local newspaper article in 1995 Norther Ireland Minister Richard Needham had convinced Marks & Spencer to co-anchor the centre project alongside Dunnes Stores. MP John Hume in the same article also voices praise on the economic benefits such as the employment that the new centre would bring and its effort in improving the image of the city and the North Wests image of a regional shopping destination. The centre opened on 25 September 1995 at 11 am.

Design and construction
The centre is a four level building constructed over numerous former streets made possible by the steep geography of the banks of the River Foyle which is characteristic of Derry. The centre is over 33,500 square metres in size. A glass dome above the central atrium of the mall serves as a focal point. A custom built Kone glass elevator is the centrepiece and originally overlooked a water fountain which was removed in 2016.

Contractors 
The main contractors for Foyleside were Brampton O’Hare Ltd. Classic Ceilings were contracted for the suspended ceilings and drywall partitions. J. Young & Son were the primary electrical engineer contractors on the project.

Mall Levels

Ground Floor / Level 0 
The ground floor of Foyleside consists of a basement service area for incoming stock deliveries by lorry and a security office. An Iceland supermarket is the sole ground floor unit along Foyle Street. There is an entrance on Foyle street and access to toilets, disabled shopper services, an escalator and an elevator to Level 1. Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 are the main shopping levels.

Level 1 
Level 1 has an entrance leading to Orchard Street and is a primary walking point to the nearby Richmond Centre shopping centre. This level is used for events and promotions in the centre atrium of the centre. A water fountain feature was removed in 2016. The water fountain had previously been used as a temporary elevated stage platform for events until its removal. There are various centre amenities such as lottery kiosk, open plan Costa Coffee shop, two ATMs and various other pop ups. The original two floor Marks & Spencer anchor unit was reduced in size in 2007 only occupying a Level 1 presence after refurbishment.

Level 2 
Level 2 features a glass tunnel ceiling creating a pleasant, bright and airy atmosphere common in most shopping centres from the 1990s. In late 1990s the Level 2 mall was extended to accommodate a new Virgin Megastores (now DV8) unit and a glass tunnel walkway which led to the top floor of the West car park. Level 2 is also where the Food Quarter is located which was added as an extension on top of the West Car Park in 2008. 
There is a glazed walkway bridge which leads to a Frasers & Sports Direct department store which was added in 2004 and originally for the Debenhams extension. 
Located close to the Food Quarter is an open barber shop and hair salon as well as a photo printing service stall. 
In 2011 a new H&M store was opened, merging the former Argos, D2 and Burton units into one large unit at a cost of £5 million.

Level 3 
Level 3 is the top shopping level of the centre. It was originally intended to act as a food court level as evident by the original tenants: McDonald's, Café Kylemore and a sweet cart - later to be joined by Thornton's and Joe Jackson's ice cream shop. The 2008 Food Quarter marked a departure from this and over time a mix of retail and food outlets now occupy this level.
A a glazed roof tunnel spans from the centre atrium and dome above this floor maintaining the same bright and open mall atmosphere as other levels. There are often concessions in the centre of this level such as new car placements and pop-up stalls. Level 3 has an entrance leading to Carlisle Road and Bridge Street. This entrance is the site where many local city tours congregate. There are toilet facilities on this level and a family baby change room.

Significant Changes

Debenhams Extension 
In 2004 a significant extension to the centre was added to accommodate a new Debenhams’ department store. The four story building was owned and operated by Debenhams Plc from 2004 until 2020.

Frasers Takeover 
In 2021 following the cessation of Debenhams the extension building was put up for sale and purchased by Sports Direct Fraser's Group. After renovation in 2021 a new Frasers department store opened on the ground level and first floor, retaining most of the Debenhams beauty hall independently operated concession tenants. A two floor Sports Direct store was opened on levels two and three, replacing the former Richmond Centre store nearby.  
The nearby GAME retail store also formerly located in the Richmond Centre moved to be on the top floor of the Sports Direct and includes a gaming arena. The former Debenhams Café area is now converted into further retail space and was not re-opened by Frasers.

Food Quarter Extension 
In 2008 the Food Quarter was opened. This featured a number of eateries including O’Briens sandwich bar, Supermacs fast-food, Yangtze express, Paulo's Pizza, a bagel store and Flippers a sweet treats outlet. This also introduced a new toilet facility. The Food Quarter features a local radio station broadcast studio which is used part time. A large panoramic window with views of the Waterside and a tall ceiling height makes the Food Quarter feel open and bright for customers to dine in. There is a kids play area at the farthest end and the recent addition of a sensory room.

2023 Sale

The West Car Park is adjoined and integrated into the main shopping centre although is an independent reinforced concrete structure. Foyleside East Car Park was opened later and is joint to the main shopping centre by a glazed walkway bridge. The total parking capacity of the centre is 1,520 car parking spaces in a multi-storey format.

Incidents
During the construction of the Debenhams extension in 2003 a construction worker was killed by a falling staircase. 

In 2006 during renovation work at the former Kylemore Café on Level 3 to add an additional mezzanine floor for a new River Island store considerable noise and disruption upset nearby residents. Similar concerns were shared in 2008 when the Food Quarter expansion was built. The centre responded by offering to meet with concerned residents and assured the public that it was carrying out the work according to Road Service and noise regulations. 

On 11 September 2016 a nearby lorry which was servicing a Poundland retail location was left unattended early in the morning. A local man had climbed into the lorry and released the handbrake, causing it to roll back unattended along Newmarket Street and crash into Foyleside Shopping Centre damaging the Debenhams glass tunnel bridge and the corner of a fire exit stairwell. This was repaired and no major damage or injuries occurred. The person responsible was later prosecuted. 

There have been various reports of sexual activity happening in the Foyle Street toilet facilities of the centre. In 2016 wooden panels were installed at these facilities in an attempt to curb this activity. Centre management have increased cleaning and monitoring activity across the centre in response to this issue and actively welcome any report of issues from visitors. There have been numerous prosecutions of people engaging in this activity with Foyleside cited as the location of the incident.

Proposals for Future Development
In 2014, it was announced that developers had approached Derry City Council with the intention of developing a new Foyleside block which would include an extra 235,000 square footage of retail space, as well as a nine screen cinema and  of office space. This has the potential to create 500 construction jobs and 300 permanent jobs if allowed to proceed. This development would cost in the region of £100 million. Further to this Minister for Regional Development, Conor Murphy has hinted that he would welcome any plans for the relocation of the current railway station to the east bank of the Peace Bridge, which officially opened on Saturday 25 June 2011
