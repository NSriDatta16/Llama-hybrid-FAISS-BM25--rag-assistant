Miles Ian Tunnicliff (born 30 July 1968) is an English professional golfer.

Tunnicliff was born in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire. He turned professional in 1989 and after six years playing on the second tier Challenge Tour and several unsuccessful visits to the European Tour's qualifying school, he finally gained his European Tour card in 1995. He had a moderately successful rookie season, and maintained his playing privileges until 1999, when he had to go back to qualifying school.

Tunnicliff was unable to regain his tour card at qualifying school and after two more years playing on the Challenge Tour and in minor European Tour events, made his breakthrough with victory in the 2002 Great North Open just two weeks after the death of his mother from cancer. That win secured his place on the European Tour. Two years later he won his second tournament, the Diageo Championship at Gleneagles, and that season went on to record his best year-end ranking on the European Tour Order of Merit, 34th place. He also won the Mauritius Open in both 2004 and 2005. After losing his European Tour card in 2010 he played on the Asian Tour. After an injury in 2014, Tunnicliff started playing on the MENA Golf Tour.
