Psalter Lane was the location of a former campus of Sheffield Hallam University in Sheffield, England. One of the former polytechnic's three bases, the campus officially closed on 31 August 2008 and work to demolish all but the old Bluecoat School building began in March 2010. Demolition work was scheduled to be completed by September 2010. It was situated further out of central Sheffield than the City campus on Pond Street and the Collegiate Crescent campus. Psalter Lane was mainly concerned with ACES (Faculties of Arts, Computing, Engineering and Sciences) courses, although a number of courses within the Faculty of Development and Society were also taught on site, such as film studies.

Facilities 
The library at Psalter Lane specialised in the arts and media. The Special Collections included an original of Stubbs' The Anatomy of the Horse (1766) and a collection of photographs from the miners strike. All Special Collections have moved to the main City Campus site.

Notable events in Psalter Lane history 
 1911: Brincliffe Quarry closed, filled in and the present building was opened as the Bluecoat School for Boys.
