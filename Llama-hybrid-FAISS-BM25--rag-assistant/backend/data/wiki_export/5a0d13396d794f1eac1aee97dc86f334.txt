Cheongdam Bridge () is a bridge over the Han River in Seoul, South Korea. It is the 18th bridge to be constructed over the river. The bridge links the Gwangjin and Gangnam districts. It carries a section of Line 7 of the Seoul Subway, between Cheongdam Station and Ttukseom Resort Station, on its underside, making it the first "duplex bridge" in South Korea. The road portion is a part of the Dongbu Expressway, which limits the bridge to motor traffic only.
