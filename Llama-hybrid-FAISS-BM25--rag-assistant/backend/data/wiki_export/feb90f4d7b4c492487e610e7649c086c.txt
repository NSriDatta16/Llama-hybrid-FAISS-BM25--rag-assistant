Professional career
Ruddy was the second-round draft choice (65th overall) of Miami in 1994.  Ruddy started 140 games of his 156 games played, in which all 16 of those non-starts were his rookie year, but he saw time in all of them. He missed only 4 regular season games during his 10 year career. During most of his career, he was the center for Dan Marino, who has held almost every meaningful NFL passing record and is widely recognized as one of the greatest quarterbacks in football history.  He also anchored the line in 2002 for Ricky Williams's NFL rushing title, which included two 200+ yard rushing games. During Ruddy's 10 years with the Dolphins(1994-2003), the team made the playoffs 7 times, and never posted a losing record for the season.

In 2001, Ruddy was named to his first and only Pro Bowl.  Ruddy was the first Miami center to be selected to the Pro Bowl since Hall of Fame center Dwight Stephenson in 1987. The last year of Ruddy's career was plagued by injury and his playing time was limited. Ruddy was released by Miami following the 2003 season. It was rumored he talked to a few teams after his departure from Miami, but did not sign with any team.

Ruddy was elected team captain 3 times and was selected as one of the top 40 Miami Dolphin players of all time. He was named as a second team offensive line selection to the Pennsylvania Football News All-Century Team.  In 2020, he was elected into the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame
