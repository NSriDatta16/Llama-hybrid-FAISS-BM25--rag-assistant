In Greek mythology, Perses (; Ancient Greek: Πέρσης) is the son of Andromeda and Perseus. Perses is left in Cossaei and with the Oceanid, fathers descendants.

Greek mythology identifies Perses as the ancestor of the Persians. Apparently, the Persians knew the story since Xerxes tried to use it to bribe the Argives during his invasion of Greece, but he ultimately failed to do so. The (Pseudo-)Platonic dialogue First Alcibiades (120e), written in the late 4th century BC, identifies him with Achaemenes as the hero founder of the Persái, stating that both Achaemenes and Heracles were sons of Perseus.
