World War 2
Near the Lompoc Airport the US Navy built the Naval Auxiliary Air Facility Lompoc base for US Navy lighter than air airships during World War II. The bases construction started in December 1942 and opened with 500 x 1000 foot asphalt landing mat, two blimp mooring masts, and housing for 25 officers and 72 enlisted men. The blimps patrolled the coast for enemy ships.
On August 13, 1943, five days after opening, while ground crews manoeuvred ship K-29 in fog in the morning on Circle #2, the blimp's tail pendants hit a high-voltage power line and 11,000 volts arcs through the ship. Four men holding the metal handling bars on the control car were electrocuted and a fifth crew member was seriously burned. The power company was supposed to have moved this power line hazard but had not. These were the only fatalities at the base.
