History 
MSK-IX was founded in 1995 pursuant to the treaty signed by 6 Russian ISPs willing to reduce IP-traffic latency and international backhaul costs. The treaty assigned the Russian Institute for Public Networks (RIPN) as the administrator of the forthcoming IP-traffic exchange and defined technical requirements for connecting ISPs. The first MSK-IX PoP was established by RIPN at M9 facility on Butlerova st., 7. In 2001, MSK-IX became an autonomous organization.  In 2002, MSK-IX joined Euro-IX, an international association of IXPs. State-run telecommunications company Rostelecom have acquired the majority of MSK-IX stock in 2015.

MSK-IX maintains a dedicated public peering VLAN at each of 9 metro areas and supports arbitrary private VLANs. Inter-city connections are provided on-net by MSK-IX and via partner ISPs. Common interface speeds are 1, 10 and 100G. The route-servers provided at each of MSK-IX public peering VLANs allow for routing policy control and DDoS blackholing by use of BGP communities.
