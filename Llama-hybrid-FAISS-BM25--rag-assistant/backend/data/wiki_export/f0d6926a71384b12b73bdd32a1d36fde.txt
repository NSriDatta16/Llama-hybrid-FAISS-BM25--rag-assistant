The Kinshasa Declaration on Great Apes was a high-level political statement on the future of (non-human) great apes. It was signed during the Intergovernmental Meeting on Great Apes and the first council meeting of the Great Apes Survival Partnership (GRASP) in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo on September 9, 2005. By signing this declaration, more than 70 representatives - including 18 range states, six donor countries, 25 non-governmental organization partners, two Multilateral Environmental Agreement partnerships, and two intergovernmental organizations - affirmed a commitment to protect great apes.

Detailed statements

 reaffirming their commitment to ensure GRASP has the capacity to realize its full potential;
 resolving to set the target of securing a constant and significant reduction in the current loss of great ape populations by 2010 and to secure the future of all species and subspecies of great apes in the wild by 2015; and
