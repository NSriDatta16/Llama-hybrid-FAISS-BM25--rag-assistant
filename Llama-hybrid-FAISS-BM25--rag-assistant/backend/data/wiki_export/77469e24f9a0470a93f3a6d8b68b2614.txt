Loveholics (Hangul: 러브홀릭스; previously known as Loveholic (Hangul: 러브홀릭)) was a South Korean modern rock group founded in April 2002 who released their first album in 2003.
The band successfully released six albums, including a short compilation album and a reissue of the original album with additional tracks before separating. The band is well known for their success, beginning with their first album and the success of its pop song, "놀러와 (Come On)", and the cover of member Kang Hyun-min's song, "인형의 꿈 (Doll's Dream)" as well as having its songs featured in many films. The band's song "신기루 (Mirage)" also was used as the ending theme to the Japanese anime, Black Blood Brothers soon after the song's album release. They have participated in many soundtracks for MBC and KBS.

After Ji-sun's departure, the remaining duo renamed the band Loveholics and featured guest vocals to supplement the band's sound up until disbandment.
