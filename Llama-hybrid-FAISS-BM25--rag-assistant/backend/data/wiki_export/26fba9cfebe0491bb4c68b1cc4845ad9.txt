History
"We can find the name of jagaddal as a village as long as 460 years ago in written records but the place is thought to be more 100 to 150 years older or maybe even much more than that. Bipradas Pipalai (1545 AD) in his work "Manasha Mangal" tells us through his protagonist character "Chand Sadagar" about Jagatdal.
Chand Saudagar mentions in his "Kabi Kankan Chandi", Jagaddal as one of the places passed by him in his voyage down the Bhagirathi (the Hooghly) and where he saw many palatial buildings built by Brahmins and Kayasthas. Haldars were the most prominent Brahmins the others being Chakrabarties and Pakrasis. Deys were the most renowned Kayastha family while Sarkars was the same amongst Mahisyas."

Pratapaditya (1561–1611 CE), The kayastha king and zamindar of Jessore made a couple of trenches and a fort at Jagatdal along with Mulajore, present day Shyamnagar as his military establishment against Muslim invaders.

According to Bengal District Gazetteers: 24-Parganas, circa 1914 "In Jagatdal the lines of two moats and two large tanks are reputed to be the remains of a fort erected by Pratapaditya in the sixteenth century".
