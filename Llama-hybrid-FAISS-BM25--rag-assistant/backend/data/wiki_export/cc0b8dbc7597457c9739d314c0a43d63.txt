History
Star Junction was founded in 1893, when the Washington No. 2 Mine was opened by the Washington Coal and Coke Company. It is so-named because it was once the site of a railroad depot, the end of the line for the Washington Run Railroad. Star Junction was once a coal mining center, with beehive ovens for coke manufacture and a foundry. It was the site of labor unrest, including the walkout of 4,500 miners in 1922. Although the company store and mines are long gone, the "patch" (the groups of company houses) still remains and houses many residents. This area was added to the "Determined Eligible List" of the Bureau of Historic Preservation, as an example of a typical coal town, and has been added to the National Register of Historic Places.
