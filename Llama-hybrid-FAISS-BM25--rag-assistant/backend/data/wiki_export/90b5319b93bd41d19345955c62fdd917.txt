History

Establishment
The idea of founding a higher school in Craiova was proposed in the 18th century by Nicolae Bălcescu,  the leader of the Wallachian Revolution of 1848. The establishment of the University of Craiova put in a proposal by Ion Heliade Rădulescu in 1848. However, the failure of the Wallachian Revolution of 1848 did not allow an immediate implementation of this plan. Almost a century later, its establishment was approved based on Act 138/25 April 1947 in the Official Bulletin of the Kingdom of Romania.

The Faculty of Agriculture and the Agricultural Institute were established in 1947 and 1948, respectively. The Technical Institute and the Pedagogical Institute were also established in 1951 and 1959, respectively. The Pedagogical Institute of Craiova included four teaching faculties: Philosophy, Mathematics, Physics & Chemistry, and Natural Sciences.

Status as a university
According to the Act No.894/27 August 1965 approved by the Ministerial Council of the Socialist Republic of Romania, the University of Craiova was officially established with seven faculties: Mathematics, Philology, Electrotechnics, Agriculture, Horticulture, Chemistry and Economics. The agreement dissolved the Agricultural Institute, and its facilities were transferred to the Faculty of Agriculture and the Faculty of Horticulture. The Pedagogical Institute of Craiova was divided into the Faculty of Letters, the Faculty of Theology, the Faculty of Social Sciences, and the Faculty of Natural Sciences.

In 1970, the Faculty of Medicine was established. In 1998, it seceded to become the University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Craiova. This has been ranked as one of the best universities for medicine in Romania, and has gained in popularity among students due to its six-year program and no entrance exam.

In 1974, the Faculty of Natural Sciences was divided into the Faculty of Mathematics, the Faculty of Chemistry and the Faculty of Physics. The Faculty of Mathematics later became the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences in 1991.

By 1989 it consisted of the following faculties:
 Faculty of Science: programs in Mathematics, Informatics and Physics
 Faculty of Letters: programs in Literature and Foreign Languages (Romanian, English, French, Russian)
 Faculty of Economy and Business Administration: programs in Economy, Finance, Accounting, and Agricultural Economy
 Faculty of Medicine: programs in General Medicine
 Faculty of  Electrical Engineering: programs in Electrical Engineering, Automation Technology, Computer Science, and Electromechanics
 Faculty of Mechanical Engineering: programs in Mechanical Engineering, Industrial Engineering, and Agricultural Engineering

In 1990, its development was characterized by restructuring administrative offices, introducing new faculties, computerizing administrative process and improving faculties, in order to become a member of the European University Association.

Since 1991, the University of Craiova has had two campuses: Craiova and Drobeta-Turnu Severin. The Craiova campus includes technology, economics, informatics and secretarial work, while the Drobeta-Turnu Severin campus has administration and informatics.
