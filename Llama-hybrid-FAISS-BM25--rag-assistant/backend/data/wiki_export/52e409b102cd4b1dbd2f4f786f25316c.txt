Wigred (or Wilgred) (died c. 942) was appointed Bishop of Chester-le-Street around 925. He was also known as the Bishop of the Church of St Cuthbert. He attested charters of King Ã†thelstan between 928 and 934, and the bishopric in his time was probably the greatest landholder between the Tees and the Tyne.
