Rangpur is an ancient archaeological site in Surendranagar district near Vanala on Saurashtra peninsula in Gujarat, western India. Lying on the tip between the Gulf of Khambhat and Gulf of Kutch, it belongs to the period of the Indus Valley civilization, and lies to the northwest of the larger site of Lothal. It is the type site for the Rangpur culture, a regional form of the late phase of the Indus Valley Civilization that existed in Gujarat during the 2nd millennium BCE.

Excavation 

Rangpur culture: Based on the distinct pottery excavated here, it was identified as a separate culture or subculture.

Trail Diggings were conducted by the Archeological Survey of India (ASI) during 1931 led by M.S.Vats. Later, Ghurye (1939), Dikshit (1947) and S. R. Rao (1953–56) excavated the site under ASI projects.

S.R.Rao has classified the deposits into four periods with three sub periods in Harappan Culture, Period II with an earlier Period, Microlithic and a Middle Paleolithic State (River sections) with points, scrapers and blades of jasper.
The dates given by S.R.Rao are:
 Period I - Microlithis unassociated with Pottery : 3000 BC
 Period II - Harappan : 2000–1500 BC
 Period II B - Late Harappan : 1500–1100 BC
 Period II C - Transition Phase of Harappa : 1100–1000 BC
 Period III - Lustrous Red Ware Period : 1000-800 BC.
