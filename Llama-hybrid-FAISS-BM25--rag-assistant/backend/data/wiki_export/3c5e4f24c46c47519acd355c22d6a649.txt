Loved Up is a BBC drama, first shown on TV on 23 September 1995 on the BBC 2 Originally this was a school information film for teenagers to show the risks of taking ecstasy, first shown to schoolchildren in the UK in 1992 and part of the Love Bites series. The film was directed by Peter Cattaneo, and starred Lena Headey, Ian Hart and Charlie Creed-Miles, plus appearances by Jason Isaacs and Danny Dyer.

Story
The story revolves around Tom, age 21, played by Ian Hart, who meets Sarah, aged 18, played by Lena Headey, in the cafe in which she works as a waitress. It quickly blossoms into romance, and she becomes involved in Tom's way of life, drug use and raves, where she finds solace from the chaos of her own family life. The plot follows her introduction to clubbing and the taking of ecstasy, the story includes her relationship with Tom, and her escape from family problems, leaving her teenage sister at home to deal with their mother's impending breakdown.

The film culminates with Sarah's mother's drinking problem leading to an attempted suicide, and Sarah asking Tom for help by leaving him a vague answerphone message he does not actually receive in time to be able to do anything. Sarah ends her relationship with Tom, and the film finishes with Tom dropping another pill, and dancing his troubles away.
