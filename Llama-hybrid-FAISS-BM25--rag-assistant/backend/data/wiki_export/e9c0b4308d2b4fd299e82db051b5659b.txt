History

Active years (1999–2011)
Sugarfree were a pop-alternative group formed in 1999. Their sound was heavily influenced by the likes of Popsicle, Eraserheads, Oasis, and Radiohead. The initial line up had The Pin-Ups' and Ciudad's Mitch Singson on drums. Singson left the band in August 2006 for personal reasons. Quisumbing immediately took over.

They were signed to Viva Records but their album was shelved. By 2003, with the help of Tracks Studio's Angee Rozul, their first offering was picked up and released by EMI Philippines (now known as PolyEast Records).

Sugarfree have worked with a some of the Philippines' premier record producers such as Angee Rozul and Rico Blanco for Sa Wakas (2003), Buddy Zabala and Raimund Marasigan (members of the  Eraserheads) for Dramachine (2004), Robin Rivera (also an album producer of the Eraserheads) for Tala-Arawan (2006), and Buddy Zabala and "Sancho" Sanchez for "Mornings and Airports" (2009). These albums have produced hit songs. "Hari ng Sablay" and "Makita Kang Muli", in particular, are the songs that brought Sugarfree into mainstream.

In 2007, Sugarfree held their first major concert at Music Museum. They shared the stage with the Manila Symphony Orchestra.

In 2008, Sugarfree created and released the song "Pugad" as endorser of Dencio's, a local restaurant chain. In the same year, Sugarfree revived the song "Bawa't Bata", an APO Hiking Society original, as endorser of the milk brand Alactagrow. The band continue to endorse San Miguel Beer and Converse.

In August 2009, Sugarfree returned to the Music Museum with "Dekada: Sugarfree with the Manila Symphony Orchestra" which was a two-night concert in celebration of the band's 10th anniversary.

In 2010, Sugarfree together with other young musical artists sang ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs MTV for the 2010 Presidential Elections entitled as "Ako ang Simula". At the same time they also sang "Panata Sa Bayan" for the theme of GMA-7 Presidential Elections MTV, 50th Anniversary & its theme song of the GMA News & Public Affairs.

Ebe Dancel also sang the OST for TV5's "8 Kingdom", entitled "Hanggang Sa Dulo".

Post Sugarfree (2011–2020)
After Sugarfree disbanded in 2011, former frontman Ebe Dancel became a solo artist. Dancel sang the song Purihin Ka, as a finalist in the UNTV's 1st Gospel Talent Show, ASOP: A Song Of Praise in 2012. He launched his album "Bawat Daan". Other former members of Sugarfree moved to another band after they disbanded in 2011.

Sudden return (2020–present)
On February 25, 2020 the band made a surprise return as a duo of Taguibao and Quisumbing. The band released a new single "Nagkita Muli" on radio station Jam 88.3. In an interview with GMA News Online, Taguibao said they decided to resurrect it because "they missed it".
