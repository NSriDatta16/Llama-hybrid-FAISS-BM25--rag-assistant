Seamus Liam Davey-Fitzpatrick (born December 29, 1998) is an American former child actor. His first film role was as Damien Thorn in the 2006 remake of the thriller The Omen.

Personal life
Davey-Fitzpatrick was born in New York City, and moved with his family to East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, where he was raised. He is of Irish descent. His parents are James Hugh Fitzpatrick, an actor and model, and Marty Davey, an actress. He began acting in commercials for Marriott and Flintstone vitamins, and briefly appeared in an episode of the television series Sex and the City.

Career
During the filming of The Omen, Davey-Fitzpatrick was never told that his character was supposed to be the son of the Devil; co-star Julia Stiles has commented that it was because the filmmakers thought "he was too young to understand it".

Davey-Fitzpatrick once acted, along with his parents, in a local short film The Lottery, an eleven-minute adaptation of Shirley Jackson's short story. He played Will Winslow on Guiding Light before the series' cancellation, and worked with Robert De Niro in Everybody's Fine, a film released in 2009. He has appeared in such television series as Law & Order, Sex and the City, Damages, The Black Donnellys, and Person of Interest. He played the 14-year-old son of Jesse (played by Ethan Hawke) in the feature film Before Midnight (2013).
