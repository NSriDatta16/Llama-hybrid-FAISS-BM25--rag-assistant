The Manifesto of Czech writers (Czech, Manifest českých spisovatelů) was the first public declaration in favour of the self-determination of the Czech nation during the First World War. It was published in May 1917. The declaration was directed at the Czech deputies at the Imperial Council in Vienna, the Parliament of the Austrian parts of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. 

The principal author was Jaroslav Kvapil (1868–1950), director of the Czech National Theatre in Prague, and the manifesto was signed by over two hundred Czech writers, journalists and scientists. It proposed that Czech members of the Imperial Council should either declare their support for the concept of Czech autonomy or else should resign their seats.
