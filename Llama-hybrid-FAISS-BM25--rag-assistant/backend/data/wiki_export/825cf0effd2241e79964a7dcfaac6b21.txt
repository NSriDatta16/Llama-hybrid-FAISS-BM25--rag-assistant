Reception 
DVD Talk reviewed the film, writing that "There's a lot of promise to be found in Hatred of a Minute, but despite the tears and years that went into bringing the project to fruition, the end result didn't completely gel for me." Ain't It Cool News was critical, as they felt that "the blood and gore in this film barely qualifies as graphic or shocking."
