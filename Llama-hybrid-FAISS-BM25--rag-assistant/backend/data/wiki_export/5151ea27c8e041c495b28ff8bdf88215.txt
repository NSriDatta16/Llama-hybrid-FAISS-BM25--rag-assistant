The Chinese FA Cup (, abbreviated as CFA Cup) is the national knockout cup competition in China organized by the Chinese Football Association. Its current holders are Shandong Taishan, having beaten Zhejiang in 2022 for a record eighth title.

History
The competition started as the Chinese National Football Championship () in 1956. It was reorganized after the Cultural Revolution and used the name Chinese FA Cup for the first time in 1984. It was scrapped for the 6th National Games of China in 1987, and was reorganized again as the Chinese National Cup Winners' Cup () between 1990 and 1992 as the qualifiers for the Asian Cup Winners' Cup.

The current format of the FA Cup began in the 1995 season following the establishment of the professional football league in China. The cup was temporary scrapped in 2007 due to the Chinese Football Association's strategy for the 2008 Summer Olympics, and returned in 2011.
