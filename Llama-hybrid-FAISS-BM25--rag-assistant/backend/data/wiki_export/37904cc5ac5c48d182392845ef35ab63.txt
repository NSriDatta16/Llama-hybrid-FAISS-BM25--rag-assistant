Roger James Edward Pratt, BSC (born 27 February 1947) is a British cinematographer.

Biography
The son of an Anglican priest, Pratt attended Loughborough Grammar School and then undertook a gap year with Voluntary Service Overseas in Mali. He enrolled at Durham University in 1966, where he graduated from the General Arts programme in 1969. After Durham, Pratt returned down south to study at the London Film School.

Pratt first met Terry Gilliam, one of his most frequent collaborators, while he was working on the set of Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975) as a clapper loader. Pratt has been the director of photography for more than 35 films, including Batman (1989), Frankenstein (1994), 102 Dalmatians (2000), Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002), Troy (2004), Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005), Inkheart (2008) and The Karate Kid (2010). Other than Gilliam, his most recurring partnerships were with Roger Christian and Richard Attenborough.

He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Cinematography for his work in The End of the Affair.
