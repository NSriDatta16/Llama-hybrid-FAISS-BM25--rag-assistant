Etymology

History 

The history of Kondotty is connected with that of the 18th century Kondotty Thangals, the Sufi exponents. Tipu Sultan of Mysore brought the first Thangal Muhammad Shah, to make the Mappilas allies. The Thangal first resided at Areekode and later settled in Kondotty. When the British arrived, putting an end to the reign of Tipu Sultan, the Thangal realigned with the British. During the 1921 upsurge, the Mappila mob attacked the house of the seventh Thangal, Nasiruddin Shah.

Nediyiruppu is 2 km from Kondotty. It is from where the Zamorin kingdom was expanded. During the ancient times, Zamorins were known as Nediyiruppu Swaroopams.
