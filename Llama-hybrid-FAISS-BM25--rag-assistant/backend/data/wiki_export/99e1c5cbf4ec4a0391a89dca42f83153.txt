The school was founded in 1873 and it was established as a university in 1949, at which time the following institutions were subsumed into it; Nagano Normal School (established in 1873), Ueda Textile College (1910), Nagano Youths Normal School (1918), Matsumoto High School (1919), Nagano Technical College (1943), Matsumoto Medical College (1944), and Nagano Prefectural College of Agriculture and Forestry (1945).

History 
Shinshu University traces its roots back to 1873 when it was a temporary normal school.
The university was chartered by the Showa government in 1949 under a new Japanese education system reforming older system, merging seven institutions of higher education within Nagano Prefecture which includes Nagano Normal School (, Nagano shihan gakkō) established in 1873, Ueda Textile College (, Ueda senni semmon gakkō) established in 1910, Nagano Youths Normal School (, Nagano seinen shihan gakkō) established in 1918, Matsumoto Higher School (, Matsumoto kōtō gakkō) established in 1919, Nagano Technical College (, Nagano kōgyō semmon gakkō) established in 1943, Matsumoto Medical College (, Matsumoto ika daigaku) established in 1944, and Nagano Prefectural College of Agriculture and Forestry (, Nagano kenritsu nōrin semmon gakkō) established in 1945. In 2004 Shinshu University became a National University Corporation under the National University Corporation Act.

Academics

Shinshu University is a comprehensive national university having 8 faculties and 8 graduate schools. A wide range of education and research is carried out on the campuses at Matsumoto, Nagano, Ueda and Minami-Minowa with a total number of staff of 1,179 and a total number of students of about 10,970 (including about 329 foreign students).
Organic collaboration between the various departments is carried out utilizing the advantages of a comprehensive university, to achieve world level advanced and innovative education and research.

Rankings

In September 2005, the university chair decided not to participate in national or international rankings in the foreseeable future, stating the administrative expenditures needed as a main reason. The small sample size used by many rankings and their methodology have also been criticised. However, Shinshu University is still being featured in international rankings.

Administrative structure

The School of General Education
The mission of the School of General Education, is to cooperate closely with the five faculties concerned with teaching (Faculty of Arts, Faculty of Science, Faculty of Engineering, Faculty of Agriculture, and Faculty of Textile Science and Technology) to make individuals acquire high professional skills based on the basic university policies for education. Furthermore, it aims to promote the educational research development and manage its plan comprehensively based on the university wide common perspective.

The Faculty of Textile Science and Technology

The Faculty of Textile Science and Technology is the only faculty in Japan with "Textile" in its name. It is recognized as an international research center in fiber engineering, and in 2010 celebrated the centenary of its establishment. It is ranked 35th in the sub-category "Textiles" in the international Science Citations Index . It is also ranked 50th in the "composites" sub-category. In 2012 they joined the Association of Universities for Textiles (AUTEX) based in Europe, to vitalize international exchange and collaboration.

List of facilities and associated institutes

Interdisciplinary Cluster for Cutting Edge Research(ICCER), a World-class International Research Center
has been established bringing together research resources in 5 research areas:

Institute of Carbon Science and Technology
Center for Energy and Environmental Science 
To propose new dimensional solutions for environmental and energy materials research

Institute for Fiber Engineering 
research continues to innovate textiles

Institute of Mountain Science 
Research into Mountain Science in Japan, Asia, and on a Global Scale

Institute for Biomedical Sciences 
To contribute to the ultra-aged society by original research in biological sciences and medical research, with the aim of sustainable development

In these research institutes, the education and research areas that need to be continued into the future and that can be undertaken as fusion and collaborative education and research have been selected in accordance with the characteristics of Shinshu University. In these research clusters, by developing the environment with an emphasis on research, inviting prominent external researchers, and introducing new human resource development systems to cultivate young researchers into prominent researchers, it is considered that the next generation of outstanding researchers will be nurtured, while maintaining our position as a center of excellence.

University Library
consists of the libraries found in each of the five campuses within Nagano Prefecture as follows: Central Library, Medical Library (Matsumoto Campus), Educational Library (Nagano-Education Campus), Engineering Library (Nagano-Engineering Campus), Agricultural Library (Ina Campus), Textile Science and Technology Library (Ueda Campus). Each library has its unique specialty and having mutual linkage. User can ask materials in a library in other campus to be sent
to his nearest campus for use. Also, the libraries are open to the citizens, showing that the university is open to the regional community. Referencing, copying, and inquiry services are accepted. Also, it is possible to borrow the materials on the open shelves that are for check-out.
