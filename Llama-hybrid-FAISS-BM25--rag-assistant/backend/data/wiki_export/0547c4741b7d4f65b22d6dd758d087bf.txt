During the reign of the Kelantan Sultanate between 1859 and 1900, the mosque became an important meeting point for the sultans and religious leaders. The mosque was also used as a trading post. During this period, the mosque was expanded and upgraded with 20 pillars, a three-tiered roof, a tower (for muezzin to call for prayers), an attic, and a water tank while the flooring was made of well quality timber. The mosque was handed over to the Kelantan Government under Menteri Besar Datuk Asri Muda's administration in May 1970.
