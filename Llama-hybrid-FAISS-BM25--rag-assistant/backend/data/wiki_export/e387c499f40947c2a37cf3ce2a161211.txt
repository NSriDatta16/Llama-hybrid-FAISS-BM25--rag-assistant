The Volkswagen Microbus/Bulli concept vehicles are a series of concept cars that are styled to recall the original Volkswagen Microbus built by Volkswagen AG. The first of these was the Volkswagen Microbus Concept Car (also known as the New Microbus and Microbus Concept), first presented at the 2001 North American International Auto Show (NAIAS).

Later concepts included the Bulli (2011), BUDD-e (2016), and ID BUZZ (2017), all battery electric vehicle concepts, and the ID BUZZ has now gone into production after its launch in 2022.

Design
The new Microbus Concept was completely modern compared to the Type 2, featuring a 7-inch screen in the center console and a second ceiling-located 7-inch screen that allowed the driver to see behind the vehicle. Passengers had 8-inch screens mounted in the seatbacks for video entertainment. The Microbus Concept was approximately the same size as the contemporary Volkswagen Eurovan, and was powered by a newly developed 3.2L V-6 engine with stated output of  and .

Styling of the Microbus Concept was handled by Volkswagen's California Design Studio in Simi Valley.

History
The Microbus Concept debuted at the 2001 NAIAS in Detroit. In June 2002 Volkswagen announced the Microbus Concept, using the platform of the forthcoming T5 light van, was slated for production commencing during 2003 at the company's Hannover plant, ramping up to 80,000 units annually by 2005.  The launch was deferred, however, and the project was canceled in spring 2004.

In 2005, VW instead announced that Chrysler would build minivans for Volkswagen in the United States, while in Europe the VW Transporter Multivan would fill the niche previously intended for the reborn Microbus.
The Chrysler built Volkswagen Routan was released to the North American market in September 2008. Unrelated to the new Microbus, the Routan is a seven-seat minivan and is a rebadged variant of the Chrysler RT platform, fifth-generation Dodge Grand Caravan and Chrysler Town & Country.
