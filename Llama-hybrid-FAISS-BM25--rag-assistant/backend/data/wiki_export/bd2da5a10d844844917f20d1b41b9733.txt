Patrick M. Rose (born October 10, 1978) is a former Texas Democratic politician, who from 2002 to 2010 served as a member of the Texas House of Representatives from House District 45, which then consisted of Blanco, Caldwell, and Hays counties in Central Texas.

Early life and education
Rose was born and grew up in Dripping Springs, Texas. He graduated with High Honors in 2001 with an A.B. in Public Policy from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University; his senior thesis was titled "The Realities of School Reform: Educational Leadership Patterns in Trenton's Public Schools". He then earned a J.D. from the University of Texas School of Law, and practiced law with the Ratliff firm in Austin before opening his own law firm in San Marcos.

Political career

Texas House of Representatives
In November 2002, after campaigning while still in law school, Rose defeated the Republican incumbent, Rick Green, to win election to the Texas House of Representatives from District 45; his margin of victory was less than 1 percent of all votes cast. Paul Stekler's 2004 PBS film Last Man Standing: Politics Texas Style for the POV series chronicles Rose's campaign and contrasts it with that year's Texas governor's race. At the time of his election, Rose was the youngest member of the Texas House at 24.

In his freshman term, Rose supported the tort reform bill pursued by Governor Rick Perry and other Republicans, putting forward an amendment requiring a reduction in the price of malpractice insurance for physicians, but also participated in the Democratic withdrawal to Ardmore, Oklahoma to prevent legislative approval of the Republicans' plan for 2003 Texas redistricting. After his freshman Session, Rose received the distinguished "Rookie of the Year" designation from Texas Monthly Magazine.

Rose was re-elected for three further terms, in 2004, 2006, and 2008. He was named to the chairmanship of the House Human Services Committee for the 2007-2008 biennium after supporting Republican Tom Craddick for election to a third term as Speaker, and was reappointed as chair of the Human Services Committee for the 2009-2010 session by Speaker Joe Straus.

In 2010, he was defeated for re-election by Republican Jason Isaac.
