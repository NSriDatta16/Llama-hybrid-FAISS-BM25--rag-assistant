Campus location

The school moved to Bukit Bintang, Kuala Lumpur in 1955 due to a rapidly expanding roll and, after several moves to locations around the Klang Valley, moved to the present location in Mont Kiara in 1996.

International examinations
In 1966, Garden School was selected as the first school in Malaysia for the University of London's General Certificate of Education examination. It is fully accredited to offer both IGCSE and A Level examinations. Candidates sit examinations in the May/June series of each academic year.
