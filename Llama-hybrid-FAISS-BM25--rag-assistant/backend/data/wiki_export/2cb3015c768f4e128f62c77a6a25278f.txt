Hani Miletski (born 1962) is a sexologist, and sex therapist living in Bethesda, Maryland. She specializes as a trainer and supervisor in the field, in sex addiction, and also works within the criminal justice system.

Early life
Miletski was born in Israel, and according to her website, moved to the United States as part of the Israeli embassy staff as Assistant Senior Representative of the Defense Mission to the U.S. for Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) Programs.

She worked within the Fogel Foundation from 1994 until 2003 before leaving to focus on her own private practice.

Published academic work
Miletski published the first brief overview of mother-son incest research. She claims that mother-son incest is more common than is thought and that most mothers who commit incest are sane.

Miletski is notable for her self-published 1999 book on zoophilia. Miletski's study has never been published in any peer-reviewed journal. She once published a two-page abstract of her findings in the Scandinavian Journal of Sexology.
