"Border Song" is a song by Elton John with music by John and lyrics by Bernie Taupin. The song initially appeared on the 1970 album Elton John, and was released in the spring of 1970 as the LP's first single. After failing to chart in the UK, it was released in North America a few months later. It met with more success there, especially in Canada, where it peaked at No. 34. The appearance of "Border Song" on the Canadian charts was John's first chart appearance in any country.

"Border Song" was also John's first song to chart in the United States, peaking at No. 92 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 69 in the Cash Box Top 100 in October 1970. A cover by soul icon Aretha Franklin (with "Holy Moses" following the title in parentheses to reflect the repeated phrase in the song) fared better reaching No. 37 in the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 23 in the Cash Box Top 100 in December 1970. It was included as the closing track of Aretha's 1972 Young, Gifted and Black album as well.

In the Netherlands it peaked at No. 29 in the Dutch Top 40 in January 1971.

Music and lyrics

The song's melody is similar to that of a spiritual. A choir sings during an instrumental break led by John's piano.

John determined the song was too short and added the final verse himself. According to Taupin, "The sentiments in that song, in fact, didn't mean anything. The great thing about Elton's last verse was he tried to put it all into perspective. That song is probably two totally separate songs."

Reception
Record World said that "it is nothing short of fantastic." Record World also praised the "fantastic piano." Cash Box said that "The surface simplicity and material depth of a Randy Newman are reflected in this tremendous top forty/underground shot from Elton John. The artist’s power should give him his first taste of American recognition through this scintillating masterwork." Billboard said that it was "more potent message material with a driving and equally potent vocal workout."
