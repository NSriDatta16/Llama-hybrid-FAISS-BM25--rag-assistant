Cape Wrath Trail is a hiking route that runs through the Scottish Highlands and along the west coast of Scotland.

It is approximately 200 miles (321 km) in length and is considered to be one of the most challenging long distance walks in the UK. Despite not being an officially recognised National Trail it has grown to be one of the most highly regarded backpacking routes, attracting hikers from around the world.

The trek was pioneered in the early 1990s by David Paterson who published a detailed guidebook for the trail.  

The trail begins in Fort William and ends at Cape Wrath lighthouse on the northwest tip of the Scottish mainland. It connects with the West Highland Way, North Highland Way and part of an alternative route suggested by Cameron McNeish which follows the Great Glen Way out of Fort William before joining the main route in Glen Shiel.

An experienced walker should be able to traverse the entire route in less than 20 days. However there are slightly different routes and stages for walkers to follow. There are other alternatives on various segments of the route, thus there is yet to be an "official" established route. Many walkers see this variety as a quintessential part of the trail's appeal. The alternatives allow differing access to bothies, provisions, stream crossings and scenery.

Officially the trail is not endorsed by Scottish Natural Heritage and it is not waymarked or signposted. Facilities along the trail are also minimal and it covers some of the remotest parts of mainland Britain.

The Fastest Known Time (FKT) for the Cape Wrath Trail (following Iain Harper's Cicerone guidebook route) is four days, nine hours and 43 minutes, set by ultra runner Beth Pascall and Damian Hall (self-supported) in December 2018. 

In April 2023, Pawel Cymbalista, an endurance runner from Poland, set a new record for the Cape Wrath Trail (folowing Glenfinnan Variant). He completed the trail, unassisted in three days, 14 hours and 49 minutes - about nine hours quicker than the previous FKT for the trail.
