History
Founded as a railway center in 1897, it was granted town status in 1925. The territory used to be a part of Porkhovsky Uyezd of Pskov Governorate, and Dno was the seat of Dnovskaya Volost.

On August 1, 1927, the uyezds and governorates were abolished and Dnovsky District, with the administrative center in Dno, was established as a part of Pskov Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. It included parts of former Porkhovsky Uyezd. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were also abolished and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. During World War II, Dno was under German occupation from 18 July 1941 until 24 February 1944. On August 23, 1944, the district was transferred to newly established Pskov Oblast.

As a municipal division, the town of Dno, together with three rural localities, is incorporated within Dnovsky Municipal District as Dno Urban Settlement.

Economy
The town remains to a large degree economically dependent upon rail-related activities. It was home to the Dno air base prior and during World War II.
