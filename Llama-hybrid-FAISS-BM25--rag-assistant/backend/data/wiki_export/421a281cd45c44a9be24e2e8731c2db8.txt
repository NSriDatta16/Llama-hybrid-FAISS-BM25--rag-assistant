Analysis
In  Jesus used the term 'teacher' and 'lord' as synonyms, but here 'my Lord' is designated to the risen Christ, and 'my God' resumes Jesus' description in the Prologue as 'God' (John 1:1, 18). This is the only time in the four canonical gospels that Jesus is addressed as God.

Suetonius records that the Roman emperor Domitian (AD 81–96) wished to be addressed as dominus et deus noster, "our Lord and God", so the statement in this verse 'may on a secondary level be designed to counter Roman emperor worship'.
