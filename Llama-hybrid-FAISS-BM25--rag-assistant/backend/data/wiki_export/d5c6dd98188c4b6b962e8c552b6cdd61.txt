History

In 1957, the Malayan Agri-Horticultural Association (MAHA) opened a miniature zoo. After the creation of the mini-zoo, the idea of a proper zoo gradually gained momentum, and the federal government chose a spot in Ulu Klang, Selangor, next to the border of Kuala Lumpur. In the 1960s, Ulu Klang was an undeveloped green area. In 1963, the first prime minister of Malaya (now Malaysia) YTM Tunku Abdul Rahman opened the zoo to the public. Zoo Negara was known as the "Zoo in the Jungle" due to the lush vegetation that dominated the region.

The zoo welcomed its millionth visitor on 14 November 1966, just three years after opening, and by 1986, the zoo was attracting over 1 million visitors per year.

The zoo remained surrounded by dense tropical forest until the late 1970s when Kuala Lumpur experienced rapid population growth fueled by an economic boom.  Nearby Ulu Klang was targeted for large scale residential development to accommodate the expanding urban population, resulting in habitat loss in formerly wild areas surrounding the zoo.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, there were plans to move the zoo to other locations in Selangor. However, the plans were largely unpopular among the public as they were seen as an effort by some developers to capitalise on the value of the zoo's large land. But with the support from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment and the [Selangor] State Government, it was decided not to relocate the zoo.
