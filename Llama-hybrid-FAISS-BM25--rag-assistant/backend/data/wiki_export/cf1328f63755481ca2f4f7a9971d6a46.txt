Olga Valeryevna Medvedtseva (), former Pyleva (), née Zamorozova (), (born 7 July 1975) is a former Russian biathlete.

At the 2002 Winter Olympics, she won an individual gold medal in the 10 km pursuit, as well as the bronze medal in the team relay. She won her second gold at the 2010 Winter Olympics in a relay.

Pyleva also won twice at the Holmenkollen ski festival biathlon competition during the 2004–05 season in the sprint and pursuit events.

She retired after the 2009–10 season.

Doping offense and disqualification in 2006 
At the 2006 Winter Olympics she won the silver in the women's 15 km individual race, but on February 16, 2006, she was disqualified from further competition for failing a drug test  when she tested positive for the stimulant carphedon. The International Olympic Committee panel found her guilty, and she was expelled from the games and stripped of her medal. She was then banned for two years from competition, and the authorities in Turin started a criminal investigation into the matter.  The head of the Russian Anti-Doping Committee claimed that Pyleva took an over-the-counter medication for an ankle injury prescribed by her personal doctor who is not a team doctor, which contained carphedon.
