History

Massachusetts Bay Community College was chartered in February 1961 by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as one of the first community colleges in Massachusetts. MassBay opened with temporary campuses in Watertown, in a property leased from Raytheon Company, and Boston, and at the time served just several hundred students. In 1975, the college moved to its permanent location in Wellesley Hills, on the campus of the former Elizabeth Seton High School. In 1990, MassBay opened a second campus in Framingham, which currently houses its health sciences and human services programs. In 2001, MassBay opened its Automotive Technology Center in Ashland.
