History

Salem High School was opened for the 1977-1978 school year by Roanoke County public schools to consolidate the student bodies of Andrew Lewis High School in Salem and Glenvar High School in western Roanoke County.  Beginning with the 1983-1984 school year, the city of Salem established a separate school district.  Glenvar High School was reopened.
