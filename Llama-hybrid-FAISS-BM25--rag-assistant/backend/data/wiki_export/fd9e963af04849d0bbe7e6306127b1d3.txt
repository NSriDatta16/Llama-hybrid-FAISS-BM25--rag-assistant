Genoa salami in the United States is a variety of dry, cured, unsmoked salami. It is normally made from coarsely ground pork, but may also contain a small amount of beef and has a natural casing. Under US regulations, it must have a moisture to protein ration of no more than 2.3:1, as contrasted with dry or hard salami, which are limited to 1.9:1.

The name Genoa Salami denotes the style of preparation rather than geographical origin.

It is seasoned with garlic, salt, black and white peppercorns, and red or white wine.
