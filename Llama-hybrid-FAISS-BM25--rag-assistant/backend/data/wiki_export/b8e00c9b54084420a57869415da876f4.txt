One Day in Europe is a 2005 comedy anthology film written and directed by Hannes Stöhr. It is an international co-production between Germany and Spain. The film had its world premiere at the 55th Berlin International Film Festival, where it was nominated for the Golden Bear award. It was released theatrically in Germany on 7 April 2005 by Piffl Medien and in Spain on 2 June 2006 by Notro Films.

Plot
One Day in Europe consists of four stories about communication misunderstanding which take place on a single day in four cities (Berlin, Istanbul, Moscow and Santiago de Compostela). The Champions League match between Galatasaray and Deportivo La Coruña which takes place in Moscow on that particular day only worsens the problem.

The film shows how four tourists in four places interact with the local police after being robbed or staging a robbery with the intent to collect a police report to be used to claim insurance. The football match actually plays a silent role in the film showing how the policemen are engrossed in the game and care little for the loss of the tourist.
