Frenching the Bully is the debut studio album by Seattle punk rock band The Gits.  It was originally released as a 12-track album on C/Z Records in 1992 but was later reissued in 2003 with bonus tracks and different cover art on the Broken Rekids label. "A stunning document of the talent ... [of] singer Mia Zapata ... She sings with such conviction, ferocity, and expressiveness that the lyrics become irrelevant. The band becomes irrelevant." –River Cities' Reader

It was selected by Russ Rankin as a top 10 favorite album.
