The Complete Collection of Russian Chronicles (, abbr. PSRL) is a series of published volumes aimed at collecting all medieval East Slavic chronicles, with various editions published in Imperial Russia, the Soviet Union, and Russian Federation. The project is ongoing and far from finished.

The chronicles were assembled by the Archaeographical Expedition of the Russian Academy of Sciences (starting in 1828). They were prepared for publication by the Archaeographical Commission, established in 1834 as part of the Ministry of National Enlightenment. The first volumes were published by a publisher "Typography of Edward Prats". The commission was charged to publish the collection on February 18, 1837.

The first ten volumes appeared between 1841 and 1863. New volumes have been brought forth piecemeal throughout the 20th and early 21st centuries. Some of the older volumes have also been reprinted, especially after 1997.

In 1977, Ludolf Müller discovered that thousands of textual variants in the Radziwiłł Chronicle and Academic Chronicle were not reported, or reported incorrectly, in Volume 1 of the PSRL.
