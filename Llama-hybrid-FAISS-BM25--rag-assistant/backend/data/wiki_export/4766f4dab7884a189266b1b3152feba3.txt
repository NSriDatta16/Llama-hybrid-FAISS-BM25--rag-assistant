Craig Thomas Walsh (born April 11, 1971, in Somerville, New Jersey) is an American composer of acoustic and electronic music.

Dr. Walsh studied at the Mannes School of Music (B.Mus.) and Brandeis University (M.F.A./ Ph.D.).

Walsh's awards for his original compositions include grants from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, Meet the Composer, Concorso Internazionale Luigi Russolo, Lee Ettelson Award for Chamber Music, Siday Musical Creativity Award from the International Computer Music Association (ICMA), Music Teachers National Association (MTNA), and the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP), among others. He previously taught at Brandeis University, the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Bridgewater State University, and the University of Arizona.

Walsh's music can be heard on Albany Records, Centaur Records and the Society for Electro-Acoustic Music in the United States CD series.

His work has been described as “bright and snappy music rooted in modernism, but also referencing the carefree attitude of American pop culture...having brightly contrasting, sharply spliced sections, funkily angular rhythmic loops, motives that are disjunct and dissonant, but function a bit like pop hooks, and harmonies that aren’t tonal, but also tend to accept the idea that a '[tonal] center' isn’t a bad thing” (Fanfare Magazine, March/April 2009). In 2008 Albany Records released Walsh's first solo CD, Bugaboo, with the New York New Music Ensemble.
