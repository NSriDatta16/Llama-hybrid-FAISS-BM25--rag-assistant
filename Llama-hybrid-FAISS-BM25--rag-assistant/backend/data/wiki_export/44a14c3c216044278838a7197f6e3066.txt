Culture events

Julia Thomas Memorial Concert 
In July 2008, a Jubilee Events Committee organised a "Proms in the Park" for Tharston. All profits made went to the Priscilla Bacon Lodge at Colman Hospital in Norwich. Newton Flotman ARTS Choir, South Norfolk Youth Symphonic Orchestra conducted by Mike Booty and many other soloists performed. A Mustang and Spitfire flew over; a flight in the mustang was a prize auctioned.

The concert was broadcast live on British Atlantic Radio, an internet station (now defunct) by certain villagers.
