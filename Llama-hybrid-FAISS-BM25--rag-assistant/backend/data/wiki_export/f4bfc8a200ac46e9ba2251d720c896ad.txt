History
The Akkar region was first inhabited by the Phoenicians but the original settlers of the Mish Mish village built mud brick homes around the mosque to stay close for prayers and also safety as there were plentiful dangerous wild animals such as hyenas that roamed the surrounding valleys and mountains. A few of the original mud brick homes are still standing near the village mosque. The village has seen many foreign occupiers pass through its lands such as the Crusaders, Ottoman Turks and the French colonial forces. Reminders of the area's past still exist in ruins around Mish Mish including road directions carved into rock, dirt roads used by invading forces and small castles or homes used by rulers. The most notable located 15 km away near the village of Old Akkar built in the late 10th century A.D. by Mouhriz Ibn Akkar, the castle was taken by the Crusaders in the 12th century and reconquered in 1271 by the Mamluk Sultan Baibars. During the Ottoman period, it belonged to the Kurdish feudal family the Banu Sayfa, then around 1620 it was partially destroyed by Emir Fakhreddine II. Husseins originated in this place.

In 1838, Eli Smith noted  Mushmish  as a Sunni Muslim village, located  south of esh-Sheikh Muhammed.

Springs used to water the lands are Ghasam, Hachem, Abour Richa, and the Deleb source. Mish Mish soil is arable and rocky which makes it more suited for tree growing.
