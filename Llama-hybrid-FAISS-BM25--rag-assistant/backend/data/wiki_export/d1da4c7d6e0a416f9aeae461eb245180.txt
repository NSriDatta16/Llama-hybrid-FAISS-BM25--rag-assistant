Peter Doherty is a British comic book artist and colourist.

Biography
Doherty's work over a 15-year career has mainly been concentrated on the classic 2000 AD character Judge Dredd.  He has illustrated several significant episodes of the strip. These include the story that has been acclaimed by fans as the best single episode story in the history of the strip, "Bury My Knee At Wounded Heart"; the classic origins story "Judge Death: Boyhood of a Superfiend"; and the swansong story of long-running support cast member Chief Judge McGruder, "Death of a Legend."

Outside 2000 AD, Doherty's work includes Grendel Tales and Shaolin Cowboy.

Doherty is currently working on Devlin Waugh.
