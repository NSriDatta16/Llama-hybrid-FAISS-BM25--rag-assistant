Nights Like These is an American metal band from Memphis, Tennessee, United States, heavily influenced by death metal and sludge metal.

Biography 
In 2006, Nights Like These released their debut, The Faithless, to overall positive reviews on Victory Records.  They released their most recent album Sunlight at Secondhand on October 16, 2007, again on Victory Records.
 
In 2008, the band went on hiatus for the first part of the year. It was later announced (via the band's Myspace) that drummer Patrick Leatherwood had left the band due to other commitments. The band announced that they were planning to scale back on touring and albums, as opposed to taking on a full-time touring schedule with yearly albums. The Victory Records website has taken off Nights Like These from their "Artist" page, this has since started a fire storm of rumors that the band and Victory have separated. On July 15, 2008, Nights Like These posted a Myspace blog confirming their split with Victory and their new drummer Todd Pasterniak. It was announced on October 5, 2009 on Myspace that members of Nights Like These were working on a new musical endeavor under the name Panther Piss. 
A release party for their 7" was held on March 6. As of 2013 the band is back together, playing a variety of shows in their hometown of Memphis.
