In 1854 the District Council of Nairne was established to govern local affairs of the town and its surrounds extending past Callington to the east.

Chapman's Bacon Factory was founded in Nairne in 1899 by the Chapman family and was closed in 2002 and has since been developed into a successful and thriving complex including a supermarket, post office and several variety shops.

In the late 1920s, the route of the Princes Highway, part of the main road route between Adelaide and Melbourne was changed to pass through Nairne, with road improvements from Mount Barker through Nairne to Kanmantoo.

In 2003, the main street was transformed for a section of the movie The Honourable Wally Norman, which was filmed using various areas of the Adelaide Hills, including Mount Barker, Nairne and Lobethal.
