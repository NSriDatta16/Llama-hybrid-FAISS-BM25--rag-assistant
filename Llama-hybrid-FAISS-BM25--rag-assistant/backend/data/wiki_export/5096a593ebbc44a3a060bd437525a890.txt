The Tuxtla Gutiérrez Mexico Temple is the 75th operating temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Tuxtla Gutiérrez is the capital of Chiapas, Mexico's southernmost state and is an area famous for its many archaeological ruins. The city itself lies in a valley among the mountains. In April 1998, LDS Church president Gordon B. Hinckley announced the church would build thirty-two smaller temples around the world before the end of 2000. The Tuxtla Gutiérrez Mexico Temple is one of these small temples and was welcomed by the many local church members. Because of the mountainous terrain, travel in and out of the area is difficult and the closest LDS temple for members was in Mexico City — a 20-hour drive. The temple in Tuxtla Gutiérrez serves more than 18,000 members in southeastern Mexico.
