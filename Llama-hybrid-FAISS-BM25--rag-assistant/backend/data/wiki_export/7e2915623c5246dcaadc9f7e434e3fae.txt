List of members representing the district 
Prior to 1992 the 5th District was centered on the south shore of Nassau County including towns mostly now in the 3rd and 4th District. The Queens portions of the 5th had been previously primarily in the 8th District of the 1980s. In general, the present 5th District greatly mirrors the 6th District from 1972 to 1982. The 1990s version of this district included northeast Nassau and northwest Suffolk counties; these areas were placed in the 2nd and 3rd District in 2002 and the 5th District gained areas in Queens formerly in the 18th District.

Election results

Note that in New York State electoral politics there are numerous minor parties at various points on the political spectrum. Certain parties normally endorse either the Republican or Democratic candidate for every office, hence the state electoral results contain both the party votes, and the final candidate votes (Listed as "Recap").
