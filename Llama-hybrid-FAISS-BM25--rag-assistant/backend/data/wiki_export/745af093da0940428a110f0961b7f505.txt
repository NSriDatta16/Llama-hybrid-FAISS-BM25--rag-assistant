Bashir Nashir Ali Al-Marwalah is a Yemeni, who was captured in Pakistan, on September 11, 2002, and transferred to extrajudicial detention in the United States Guantanamo Bay detention camps, in Cuba.
His Guantanamo Internment Serial Number is 837.
Joint Task Force Guantanamo counter-terrorism analysts reports that Al-Marwalah was born on December 1, 1979, in Al-Haymah, Yemen.

Bashir Al-Marwalah was apprehended by a combined force of Pakistani security officials and a CIA black site team, on 11 September 2002â€”the anniversary of al Qaeda's attack within the USA.
He and five other individuals spent slightly more than a month in CIA custody at the Salt Pit, prior to being transferred to Guantanamo.  Guantanamo analysts maintained the narrative that these six were an al Qaeda sleeper cell they called the "Karachi Six".  However, that claim had been dropped by his 2016 Periodic Review Board hearing.

As of December 3, 2009, Bashir Nasir Ali Al-Marwalah had been held at Guantanamo for seven years two months.

Al-Marwalah was transferred to the United Arab Emirates on August 13, 2016.

Official status reviews

Originally the Bush Presidency asserted that captives apprehended in the "war on terror" were not covered by the Geneva Conventions, and could be held indefinitely, without charge, and without an open and transparent review of the justifications for their detention.
In 2004 the United States Supreme Court ruled, in Rasul v. Bush, that Guantanamo captives were entitled to being informed of the allegations justifying their detention, and were entitled to try to refute them.

Office for the Administrative Review of Detained Enemy Combatants

Following the Supreme Court's ruling the Department of Defense set up the Office for the Administrative Review of Detained Enemy Combatants.
