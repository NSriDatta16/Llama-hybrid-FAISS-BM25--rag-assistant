Live, Loud and Loose (1982â€“1986) is an album released by the rock band Loverboy in 2001. After the death of their original bassist Scott Smith, the band decided to release a live album. This album contains refurbished recorded live tracks from the band's intense touring from 1982 to 1986. It became quite popular with fans, but failed to break into the mainstream.
