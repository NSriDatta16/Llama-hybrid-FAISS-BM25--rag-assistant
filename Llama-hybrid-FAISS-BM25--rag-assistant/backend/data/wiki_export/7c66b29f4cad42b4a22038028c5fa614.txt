The title of Lord Balmerino (or Balmerinoch) was a title in the Peerage of Scotland; it was created in 1606 and forfeited in 1746 on the attainder and execution of the 6th Lord Balmerino in the Tower of London.

The title of Lord Coupar or Cupar was a title in the Peerage of Scotland; it was created on 20 December 1607 for James Elphinstone, second son of the 1st Lord Balmerino. The 3rd Lord Balmerino succeeded his uncle in the lordship of Coupar in 1669. From his succession to the lordship of Coupar in 1669 to the attainder and forfeiture in 1746, both lordships were merged.
