The Dominican Order (Order of Preachers) has been present in Ireland since 1224 when the first foundation was established in Dublin, a monastic settlement north of the River Liffey, where the Four Courts is located today. This was quickly followed by Drogheda (also 1224), Kilkenny (1225), Waterford (1226), Limerick (1227) and Cork (city) (1229). The order was reestablished in the 19th century after having been driven out in the 17th century by laws against Catholic religious orders. During the Penal Laws, as other Irish Colleges were established on the continent, in 1633 the Irish Dominicans established, the College of Corpo Santo, Lisbon and College of the Holy Cross, Louvain (1624-1797) to train clergy for ministering in Ireland. San Clemente al Laterano in Rome, was entrusted to the Irish Dominicans in 1677. In 1855, St. Mary's Priory, Tallaght, was established to train members of the order, who would complete their clerical studies in Rome and be ordained in the Basilica San Clemente.

Dominican convents, retreat houses, and houses of study

There are currently communities of Dominican friars in the following places in Ireland:

 Convent and seminary in Cork city
 Convent, house of study and retreat house in Tallaght
 Community in Athy
 Others

There are also communities of Dominican nuns in a number of places.

Dominican colleges
The Dominican orders have made a significant contribution to Irish education. In 1900 the Dominican Sisters established St. Mary's Teacher Training College, in Belfast, which has evolved into St Mary's University College, Belfast. The order delivered the first teacher training diploma course in Ireland at St Dominic’s Training College, Eccles Street, which was established in 1908, allowing aspiring teachers to gain a Teaching Diploma from Cambridge University. From 1902 the Dominicans on Eccles street prepared girls for University exams with the Royal University of Ireland, as they also did at Sion Hill.

Irish Dominicans have been active outside Ireland, taking up a number of roles and responsibilities. From 1863 many Irish Dominican priests, brothers, and nuns, served the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, as the Irish Dominican Order were given responsibility for the dioceses, with a number serving as Bishops. In 1962 the Irish Dominicans were asked by the Vatican to take over the church mission in Tehran, Iran, building and maintaining  Saint Abraham's Church, Tehran. Irish Dominicans have owned the Basilica of San Clemente and the surrounding building complex since 1667 when Pope Urban VIII gave them refuge, it has become a house of study and residence for Dominicans when studying in Rome. The Irish Dominican College, Louvain, (Collège des Dominicains Irlandais, Louvain), founded in 1659, was also following the French revolution in 1795. Irish Dominican presence in Lisbon goes back to when they sought refuge and clerical training setting up a college, during penal times, a Convent, Convento De Nossa Senhora Do Bom Sucesso, was also established in 1633 which closed in 2006. Today the order maintains one friar in Lisbon who serves the Irish and the English speaking communities there, the convents mission continues under Fundação Obra Social das Religiosas Dominicanas Irlandesas, (FOSRDI).
