The Roosevelt Park Zoo is a zoo in Minot, North Dakota. It is the oldest zoo in North Dakota.

The zoo is open year-round with limited hours during the winter. New big cat habitats for lions, Amur Tigers, and Amur Leopards respectively have been built recently to replace the outdated feline house built after the flood of 1969.

History

Early years 
Roosevelt Park Zoo opened in 1921 and the first animal exhibition featured the American Bison.

Management 
In 1970, the zoo was separated from the city-owned Roosevelt Park and the Greater Minot Zoological Society was created to operate the zoo. Today, the zoo is part of the Minot Park District and the GMZS still exists as a 501-c charity to support the zoo.

Floods 
The flood of 1969 caused every bird and animal to be moved from the zoo, which led to the redesign of the zoo grounds. A foot bridge, a feline house, and a new bear den were constructed.  The 2011 Souris River Flood caused the animals once again to be relocated from the zoo.  Due to cleanup efforts on the grounds and buildings, the zoo did not open for the 2012 season. The Zoo re-opened on May 4 of 2013.
