They were named "England's Most Dominant Tag Team" by Total Wrestling Magazine. After Big Dave's injury and a sustained period of rehab over many years the pair are wrestling again as the UK Pitbulls and have featured in Fightmare Norwich 2019.

Professional wrestling career
Dave was originally trained by Andre Baker at NWA UK Hammerlock. Dave and Mike completed their training in late 1997 at World Association of Wrestling (WAW) of Norwich under Sweet Saraya.

The UK Pitbulls name is actually a play on the World Wrestling Federation's British Bulldogs tag team name; Bulk and Big Dave were asked to wrestle as the British Bulldogs on a holiday camp but declined and suggested the name UK Pitbulls instead.

The UK Pitbulls opened a professional wrestling and powerlifting gym "Pitbull Powerhouse" in Cromer, Norfolk. Here they ran a wrestling training school and also concentrated on weightlifting, strongman training, fitness weight loss, and any routine to personal requirements. Dave and Mike were directly involved in the wrestling training as well as having regular guest trainers. They also ran their own promotion, DAM Promotions (Dave and Mike Promotions), holding several shows in Holt, Norfolk.

In 2008, Dave's knee collapsed during a strongman competition, and he was forced to retire. At the time of Dave's injury, The UK Pitbulls were Premier Wrestling Federation's Tag Team Champions. Subsequently, Mike wrestled in singles matches for three years. In 2011, he won Falling Starr Wrestling's Championship from Jimmy Starr. Mike considered retiring, but instead formed a tag team a second incarnation of the team with Big Joe. In late 2016, they teamed up with Hornswoggle to take on Sid Scala, Adam Maxted, and Lord Gideon Grey for XWA's Winter Supershow.

Mike also wrestles in a team called The Unnatural Disasters with Karn. They appeared on Total Nonstop Action Wrestling's British Boot Camp 2.
The UkPitbulls are now back together and won the WAW tag titles in June 2019 at Fightmare 3, Carrow Road football stadium, Norwich, in front of approximately 5000 fans. as of 2021 they are the current Falling Starr wrestling tag champions and the Big Top Wrestling tag champions.
