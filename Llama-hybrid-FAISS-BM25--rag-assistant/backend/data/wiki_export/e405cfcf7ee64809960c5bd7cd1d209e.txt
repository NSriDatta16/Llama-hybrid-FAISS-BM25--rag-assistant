Terrenceville is a small town located on the Burin Peninsula of Newfoundland, Canada, south west of Swift Current.

History

Terrenceville is located on the island of Newfoundland, approximately  north of Marystown on Route 211. It was known as Head of Fortune Bay until 1905, when it was renamed in honor of former Newfoundland governor Terence O'Brien.

The town was serviced by the C.N. coastal boats until early 1995. It was a main port for many isolated communities on the south coast that needed to get to places such as Marystown, Clarenville, and St. John's.

The population was 300 in 1944, 424 in 1951 and 521 in 1956. Like many other towns in rural NL, Terrenceville, has seen its population decline due to many families having to leave for full-time employment, as well as an aging population which requires medical facilities.

Geography
Terrenceville is located in a valley at the head of Fortune Bay which is separated into two bits. The barsway, which is fresh water, and the miles barsway, which is saltwater. This separation is caused by a sand bar dividing the two bodies of water.
