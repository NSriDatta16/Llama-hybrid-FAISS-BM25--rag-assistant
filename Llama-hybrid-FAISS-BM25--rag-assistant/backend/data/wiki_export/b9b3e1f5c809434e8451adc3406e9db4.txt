Golden Oak Ranch is an  movie ranch owned by the Walt Disney Studios subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company that serves as a filming location and backlot. The ranch is off of Placerita Canyon Road outside of Newhall, Santa Clarita, California, less than an hour north of Los Angeles; its entrance is not far from Placerita Canyon Road's intersection with California State Route 14.

The ranch is on land that was part of the Rancho San Francisco land grant. Its name honors the first discovery of gold in California at the site by Francisco Lopez, years before the discovery that precipitated the California Gold Rush. The ranch has a heliport, grassy meadows, two creeks, a waterfall, and various Western sets.

A business district set and residential street set were built on the ranch by 2012. The district set has 42 stores, while the residential set has 23 houses all with separate architectural style.
