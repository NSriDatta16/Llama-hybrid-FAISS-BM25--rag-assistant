History 
The Manhattan Construction Company was founded in 1896 by Laurence H. Rooney, and primary ownership remains in the Rooney family, today by Francis Rooney.

As the first company to incorporate (1907) in the State of Oklahoma, Manhattan played an important part in building the Southwest. Among the dozens of schools and courthouses, Manhattan also built the first State Capitol in Guthrie and worked on the relocated Oklahoma State Capitol building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Another major historical landmark constructed was the First National Bank building in Oklahoma City, which at the time was the tallest structure west of the Mississippi River.

During World War II, Manhattan completed over one billion dollars in military base, hangar, apron, barrack and other defense mobilization projects for the United States Defense Department. For such achievements during World War II, Manhattan was awarded two of the coveted Army-Navy “E” awards for excellence.

Since its founding, Manhattan expanded south to Texas, east to Washington, D.C., Georgia and Florida, and internationally to Mexico and now performs work throughout the United States, Mexico and the Caribbean.

Notable projects 
Manhattan Construction built the Manhattan Building, Oklahoma State Capitol Dome, NRG Stadium, the George Bush Presidential Library, Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, the Cato Institute headquarters, the Prayer Tower at the Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Oklahoma, United States Capitol Visitor Center, and many more.  The most notable project completed is the Dallas Cowboys home stadium, AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas.

Manhattan Construction also built the George Mason University Founders Hall in Arlington, Virginia and George Washington University Hospital in Washington D.C. In 2013, Manhattan Construction finished building the George W. Bush Presidential Library, making it the only construction company to have built two presidential libraries.

A number of its works are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
