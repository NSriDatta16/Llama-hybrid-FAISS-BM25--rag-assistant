History
Before the district opened its own secondary school in 1952, students from Wayne had attended Pompton Lakes High School. The school was called "Wayne High School" until Wayne Hills High School opened in September 1966, at which time the word "Valley" was added to the original school's name in order to differentiate between the two.

Awards and recognition
John F. Kennedy School was recognized by Governor Jim McGreevey in 2003 as one of 25 schools selected statewide for the First Annual Governor's School of Excellence award.
