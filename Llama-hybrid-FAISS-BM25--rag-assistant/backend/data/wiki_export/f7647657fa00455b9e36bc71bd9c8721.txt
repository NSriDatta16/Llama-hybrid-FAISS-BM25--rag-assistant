An extra-parliamentary opposition is a political movement opposed to a ruling government or political party that chooses not to engage in elections. Many social movements could be categorized as an extra-parliamentary opposition.

The Italian Far Left movement Lotta Continua (LC - Continuous Struggle) is one of the best known examples of this phenomenon in Italy.
