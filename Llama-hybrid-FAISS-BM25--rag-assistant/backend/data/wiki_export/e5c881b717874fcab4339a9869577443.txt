Heritage sites of national significance

The Swiss Reformed Church of San Gian is listed as a Swiss heritage site of national significance.  The church is located on a hill above the Inn River.  It was built in 1478 on the site of a chapel that was about 500 years older.  The church is a single apse construction with a painted wood roof and notable frescoes.  In 1682 the large bell tower was struck by lightning and the burned-out roof was never replaced.

Tourism

As Celerina/Schlarigna is located at the edge of the plain where the Flaz river (coming from the Bernina Pass) meets the Inn, this is the widest part of the Engadin valley, making Celerina the sunniest spot in the upper Engadin valley. Unlike St. Moritz, its more famous neighbouring town to the south-west, Celerina has retained many historic buildings in its town centre, many dating back to the 17th century. The town has three historic churches: the small Romanesque church in Cresta, the gothic church of San Gian (current structure dating to 1478, but based on a chapel at least 400 years older than that) in the middle of the plain, and the baroque-style, 1669 Bel Taimpel'' in the heart of the village.

Formerly a farming village, over the last few decades the importance of tourism has increased dramatically in Celerina/Schlarigna. There are no really big hotels, but a handful of medium and small hotels and inns. The core tourism, however, stems from vacation apartments, both owner-occupied second homes and temporary rentals. There is both summer and winter tourism. The winter season is more important. Summer guests enjoy hiking and mountaineering; mountain biking has also become popular. Nearby there are also opportunities for golf, glider flying, swimming and hang-gliding. Winter sports include both Nordic and alpine skiing, bobsleigh, and skeleton (the famous Cresta Run ends in Celerina). There is a direct skiers gondola from Celerina into the heart of the St.Moritz ski area of Corviglia/Marguns, a major portion of which lies in the municipality of Celerina/Schlarigna.
