Agamudayar (otherwise Agamudaiyar, Akamudayar, Agamudayan) are a Tamil community found in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. In Southern parts of Tamil Nadu, they are considered as one of the three castes which make up the Thevar or Mukkulathor community. Agamudayars were warrior class of people and held high ranks in the South Indian Kingdoms.

Agamudayars are listed in the national commission of backward caste lists for Tamil Nadu. Agamudayars are dominant landlords and hold numerous wealth. They organise many businesses.
