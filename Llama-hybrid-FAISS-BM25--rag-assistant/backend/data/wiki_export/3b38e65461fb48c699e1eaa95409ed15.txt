Gruffydd Maelor (died 1191) was Prince of Powys Fadog in Wales.

He is known as Gruffydd Maelor I to distinguish him from his grandson, Gruffydd Maelor II, Lord of Dinas Bran. He married into the House of Stanley later Earls of Derby.

Lineage 
He was a son of Prince Madog ap Maredudd by Susanna, daughter of King Gruffudd ap Cynan of the House of Aberffraw. He was to be the founder of the principal ruling family of northern Powys during the 13th century.

Inheritance 
On his father's death in 1160 Powys was divided between his three sons (Gruffydd, Owain Brogyntyn and Owain Fychan), a nephew (Prince Owain Cyfeiliog) and a half-brother (Prince Iorwerth Goch ap Maredudd).

Gruffydd received the Lordship of Maelor (also known as Bromfield) and the Lordship of IÃ¢l (also known as Yale), as his allotted portion of Powys. These lordships later merged and became the Lordship of Bromfield and Yale, belonging to John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey, who was later defeated at the Battle of Stirling Bridge by William Wallace.

Gruffydd later added Nanheudwy, Cynllaith Owain and Mochnant Is Rhaeadr after the death of his half-brother Owain Fychan in 1187.

Unification of northern Powys
His inherited and acquired lands in effect unified and reunited most of northern Powys forming what became known as Powys Fadog after it was inherited by his son.

Marriage 
He married Princess Angharad, his cousin and daughter of Owain Gwynedd, King of Gwynedd.

Death and issue 
He died in 1191, leaving issue:

 Madog, who succeeded his father.
 Owen, joint ruler with his brother, died 1197.
