History 

Choctawhatchee originally opened its doors in Shalimar, Florida, on September 22, 1952. It was filled over its capacity of 500 students, enrolling 625 students in grades 7 through 12. The local news held a contest to name the school, and thus Choctawhatchee, or "coming together," was picked. Later it was relocated to its current location in Fort Walton Beach, Florida with the old site becoming what is now Meigs Middle School.

Traditions 

At the beginning of each home football game, the school Indian, or student mascot, rides a horse across the field and throws a spear midfield. Although many think that the idea was borrowed from Florida State University, in fact it is opposite that, as accounted for by the former football coach and athletic director, Wyman Townsel. Ann Bowden, wife of Florida State University football coach, Bobby Bowden, attended a Choctaw football game in the 1970s, saw the horse run, and told her husband that it would be a good idea for FSU.

In front of the school stands three totem poles just outside the front office. They are a symbol of school pride and represents various aspects of student life and have withstood hurricanes, attacks by rivals, and continue to serve as an emblem of the Choctaw High School family.

Also in front of the school are engraved bricks, purchased by students and then engraved so that they may forever be a part of the school.

The Alma Mater was written during the school's first year by the band director, Jim Leonard. The tune is a World War I song, "Long, Long Trail Awinding." In 1956, Bryan Lindsey came to Choctaw as choral director, and began writing words to "Big Green Indian." Lindsey collaborated with Leonard to compose the song. It became the school's fight song.

Choctaw is home to many school-spirited students, none more so than the Teepee Crew and the Warchiefs. The Teepee Crew consists of upperclassmen males who send smoke through the teepee, which is located just past the endzone, whenever the football team scores  a touchdown. The Warchiefs is a group of highly motivated, spirited students who attend all of the football and basketball games and cheer along with the cheerleaders.
