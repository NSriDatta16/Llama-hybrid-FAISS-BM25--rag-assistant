History

World War II
The 23rd Marine Regiment was activated on 20 July 1942 at New River, North Carolina; was assigned to the 4th Marine Division in February 1943 and relocated during July 1943 to Camp Pendleton, California. Regiment's first commanding officer was Colonel Louis R. Jones.

During World War II, the 23rd Marines participated in the following campaigns: Kwajalein, Saipan, Tinian, and the Battle of Iwo Jima. During the fierce fighting which occurred in the Pacific Theater, four Marines of the 23rd Marine Regiment were awarded the Medal of Honor for valor:
 Richard B. Anderson, 2/23, Kwajalein
 Joseph W. Ozbourn, 1/23, Tinian
 Darrell S. Cole, 1/23, Iwo Jima
 Douglas T. Jacobson, 3/23, Iwo Jima

Starting at Kwajalein, the 23rd Marines was assigned to land on beaches red 2 & 3 at Roi. That island was taken in a day.   Saipan came next with the 23d Marines assigned to blue beaches 1 & 2 with third Battalion 20th Marines as their Shore Party (121st Seabees).  Across the strait at Tinian the 23rd Marines was the assault reserve landing on beach white 2.  The 121st CB was still assigned to them.
For the assault on Iwo Jima the 23rd Marines was assigned to yellow beaches with 1/23 the left assault Battalion on yellow beach 1.  The right assault Battalion 2/23 was on yellow beach 2 and 3/23 was the assault reserve.  The 23rd Marines did not have a Pioneer Battalion for the assault Shore Party so the Seabees of Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 133 were task assigned that duty until relieved D-plus 18.
The 23d Marines made four assaults during WWII with Seabees as their beach support each time.

In October 1945, the regiment was again relocated to Camp Pendleton and was subsequently inactivated on 15 November 1945.
