Career

Television

Commercial spokesperson
Shaw became best known to Australian TV audiences as "The Demtel Man" between 1992-1995 as he presented as the face of an infomercial "As Seen On TV" sales company TV commercials and infomercials for Demtel International. He popularised the expression "But wait, there's more" in Australia. He was well known for offering a free set of steak knives to anyone who placed an order within a set timeframe, even when the main product for sale had nothing to do with steak knives, so much so that "steak knives" has remained a common Australian slang term for a small or irrelevant sweetener within a larger deal long after Demtel's demise.
