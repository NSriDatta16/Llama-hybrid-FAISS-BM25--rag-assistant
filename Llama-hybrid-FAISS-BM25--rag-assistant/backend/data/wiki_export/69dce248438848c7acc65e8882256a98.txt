The Great Basin redband trout is native to drainages in south central Oregon east of the Cascade range, extreme north east California and extreme north west Nevada.  They occur in seven isolated drainagesâ€”the Upper Klamath Lake basin, Fort Rock basin, Harney-Malheur basin, Catlow basin, Warner Lakes basin, Goose Lake basin, and the Chewaucan basin.
