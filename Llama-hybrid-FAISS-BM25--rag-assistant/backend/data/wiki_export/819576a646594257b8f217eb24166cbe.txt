History 
Founded in 1919 as a maker of digitalis drugs, Upsher-Smith has traditionally focused on the manufacture of generic medications.
In 2017, after owning and operating Upsher-Smith for 47 years, the Evenstad family made the decision to sell the largest part of their company, the generics business, to Sawai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., a large publicly traded generics company in Japan that had been seeking entry into the U.S. market.

Upsher-Smith's non-generic pharmaceuticals businesses Proximagen, Pairnomix and MOBÄ’ remained with ACOVA, a holding company owned by the Evenstads.
