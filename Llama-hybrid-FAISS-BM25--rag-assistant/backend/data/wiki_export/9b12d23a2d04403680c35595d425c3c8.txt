Joe Cornish (born 4 March 1958) is a British photographer noted for his large format landscapes.

Born in Exeter, Devon, England in 1958, he graduated with a degree in Fine Art from University of Reading in 1980 and then went to America to train as a photographer's assistant. From 1982 he moved to London working first as a freelance assistant before starting out as a general purpose commercial photographer.

In 1986 his early travel and landscape photography was accepted into Charlie Waite's photolibrary, Landscape Only. From 1986 to 1995 Cornish was responsible for either all or the majority of the photography in more than thirty travel books.

His first job for the National Trust was the 1990 book In Search of Neptune and he has worked freelance on assignments for them ever since.  Since 1993 Cornish has lived and worked close to the North York Moors and has photographed the North Yorkshire landscape for over 20 years, while still continuing to photograph around the British Isles and overseas.

He co-owns the Joe Cornish Gallery in Northallerton North Yorkshire from where he displays a permanent collection of his prints and hosts photographic and printing workshops throughout the year.

In 2006 Amateur Photographer honoured him with their annual Power of Photography award, and in 2008 he was made an honorary Fellow of the Royal Photographic Society.

Cornish has been involved in the Distinction panels of the RPS, the judging team of Wildlife Photographer of the Year, and as host of the Natural History Museum's annual Understanding Photography events. He frequently lectures throughout the UK and abroad and his written work often appears in the online photography magazine On Landscape (of which he is a co-founder).
