Production Issues
In a 2020 Instagram livestream with J. Alexander, Jay Manuel admitted that the rumours that the contestants were detained in Japan upon arriving in Tokyo were “100% true”. He revealed that the judges had already arrived in Tokyo because they fly ahead of the contestants, but upon arriving in Tokyo, customs “thought they were hookers” and didn’t let them in the country.

Luckily, before they could be detained, production “put them back on a plane, flew them to Guam ... for two days ... and from there the girls got proper visas to enter the country”. J. Alexander also revealed that he was meant to meet the girls at the airport and was left waiting for them for hours because he hadn’t been told what was happening. This left him “mad, angry ... furious” because production “completely forgot” about him and he had travelled for “two hours” from Tokyo to the airport to meet them.

Jay also revealed that the show’s stylist was traveling with the contestants but that in Tokyo, they “don’t have showrooms like in a lot of ... European cities, so she traveled with trunks with the clothes for the photo shoots. But she was also “turned away” at customs, got a “black stamp” in her passport and was sent “back to New York”. However she took her trunks with her and production told Jay “guess what now, you’re styling”. They gave him money and him and J. Alexander had to buy all the clothes for the photo shoots in Harajuku whenever they had a free moment. He joked that after that experience “he never wants to style shoots again”.

Manuel has also admitted that the girls being turned away at customs was the “big disaster of Cycle 3” and “did mess up production”. Due to CoverGirl's partnership with ANTM as of Cycle 3, they had a bigger budget and so Manuel was able to produce a “really elaborate commercial which was what the girls were supposed to shoot when they landed in Tokyo”. He described how he built a “huge set” that took a “week to build” and a got a “famous director to shoot it” but once the girls were sent to Guam, production “tore it all down”. When the girls “finally showed up” in Tokyo, production said they couldn’t give Manuel any more money for a new commercial. Manuel says he was extremely angry and production told him it was his problem, which he claims is “very America’s Next Top Model production”.

Eventually they did the commercial, but the robes that the girls were wearing were actually the robes from Manuel’s and Alexander’s hotel, and they shot it on a “patio” with a “reality cam” and no proper lighting. The commercials ended up being judged “an hour later” and Manuel was “mortified”, saying it “looked horrible” and that he was “embarrassed to even say what happened”.

Trivia

 Jay Manuel and J. Alexander agreed on a May 2020 Instagram livestream that Cycle 3 “put ANTM on the map” with Manuel explaining that “Even with the Tokyo disasters, which ... drove me crazy ... it was still one of the most fun cycles, in a weird way, just because of everything that was going down.”

 Manuel also revealed that the real reason why Tiffany didn’t get into the house was because she didn’t pass the psychological evaluation at casting week, not because Tyra didn’t want her. He admitted that off-camera, Tyra told Tiffany that “can you get help?” and the network “paid for her to get counselling and allowed her to come back and audition for Cycle 4”.

 J Alexander admits that if that Cycle 3 was aired today, Yaya would have received a “lot of support“ after she was criticised for being overbearing in regards to being proud of being African.

 Jay Manuel has confirmed that he is still is in touch with the contestants, including Ann and Eva, saying he is “really good friends” with Ann. He also confirmed that he still is in contact with Eva “via text and dm now and then” and was actually “invited to her wedding”.

 Jay Manuel described Toccara’s elimination as “emotional”, describing at as “hard for anyone”, saying even Janice Dickinson cried. J. Alexander also admitted that Toccara should have gone further.

 Jay has revealed that the photoshoot with winner Eva Marcille and Tyra Banks actually happened 3 days before the Cycle 3 premiere party in Los Angeles before the airing of the final episode, with Manuel doing both their make-up. Miss J. said that Tyra actually shot with all three girls, including Yaya and Amanda, because they didn’t know who was going to win.

 Jay revealed that during one panel, Janice Dickinson “kinda passed out” but they just continued filming judging with the other four judges and just edited Janice in later.

 Manuel denied rumours than Ann only made it to the top 4 because Ford Models wanted her, explaining that agencies “for a fact ... could never put that type of pressure“ on the judges. However he did admit that model agencies would “float who they’d like” because they’d sit on the judging panels but they never controlled the judging.
