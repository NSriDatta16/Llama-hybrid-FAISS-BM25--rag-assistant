The 2nd World Cup season began in January in West Germany and concluded in April in the US Jean-Claude Killy of France repeated as the overall champion, and announced his retirement from World Cup competition.  Nancy Greene of Canada repeated as the women's World Cup overall champion, and announced her retirement from World Cup competition.

For the only time, the results of the Winter Olympics were included in the season standings.  Future Olympic results were not included as World Cup races, nor were World Championship results after 1970.  However, the inclusion of the Olympics was irrelevant to the final outcome, as both Killy and Greene would have won the season titles had the Olympics been excluded.
