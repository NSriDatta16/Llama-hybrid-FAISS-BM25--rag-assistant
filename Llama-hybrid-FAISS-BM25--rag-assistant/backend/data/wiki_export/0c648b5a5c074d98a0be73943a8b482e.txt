Early life and education

He attended first St Peter's School, Seaford, and from 1975 to 1980 Milton Abbey School. He studied a BMus in music at the University of Toronto and then studied a Masters of Philosophy at Christ Church, Oxford.

Career
He served as vice-principal and director of studies at the Royal Academy of Music from 1995 to 2008 under his predecessor, Sir Curtis Price.

Holding senior posts at the academy for over 30 years, Freeman-Attwood assisted in developing new programmes, major international relationships – nurturing a twenty-year collaboration with the academy's sister conservatoire in the US, The Juilliard School – including three Promenade concerts, commercial recordings and a co-commission of Sir Peter Maxwell's Kommilitonen!.

In celebration of the Bicentenary, Freeman-Attwood commissioned the academy's 200 PIECES series which launched in December 2022. 200 composers, including Brett Dean, Helen Grime, Eleanor Alberga, Sir George Benjamin, and Hans Abrahamsen, were invited to write 200 new works for solo instruments or voice, with all 34 principle-study instruments being represented.
