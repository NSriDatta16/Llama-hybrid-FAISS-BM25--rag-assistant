Blue is a 1994 album by American guitarist Phil Keaggy, released on Epic Records. Blue was released in the mainstream market simultaneously with Keaggy's album, Crimson and Blue, which was geared to the Christian market. The most significant differences are the inclusion of three different songs (Keaggy's cover of the Badfinger song, "Baby Blue"; "All Our Wishes"; and "The Further Adventures of..." from the Revelator EP) and the exclusion of five songs from Crimson and Blue ("Love Divine," "Reunion Of Friends," "Stone Eyes," "I Will Be There," and "Nothing But The Blood.") In addition, several of the tracks on Blue are reworked.
