Bryan Johanson (born 1951) is an American classical guitarist and composer.

Johanson was born in Portland, Oregon.

Johanson has performed, recorded and published works internationally. Johanson's works have won major awards from the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra, Aspen Music Festival and School, The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, UCLA and The Esztergom International Guitar Festival. Johanson studied composition with Charles Jones and Pulitzer Prize-winning composer William Bolcom. Johanson's compositions feature three symphonies, concertos for violin, cello and piano, numerous chamber works, song cycles and choral works, as well as compositions for solo instruments including the classical guitar.

Johanson directed the guitar studies program at Portland State University from 1977 to 2015. During that time, he managed a successful concert series and later the Portland International Guitar Festival and Competition, a festival that earned worldwide recognition and attracted some of the finest players.

Johanson studied with the likes of Christopher Parkening, Alirio Diaz, and Michael Lorimer. He has performed with orchestras, chamber music groups, choirs, and in solo recitals throughout the United States and Canada.

In 2010, Johanson became a member of the Oregon Guitar Quartet, a group for which he has created numerous original compositions and arrangements.

Johanson currently lives in Portland, Oregon with his wife and daughter.
