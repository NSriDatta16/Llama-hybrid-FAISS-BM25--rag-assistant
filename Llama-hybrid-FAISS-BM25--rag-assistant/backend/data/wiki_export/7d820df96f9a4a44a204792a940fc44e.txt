Amdavad Municipal Corporation (AMC) was established in July 1950 under the Bombay Provincial Corporation Act (1949), is responsible for the civic infrastructure and administration of the city of Ahmedabad.

History

On 21 April 1831, the collector of the city, Mr. Bordel formed 'Town Wall Fund Committee' comprising the citizens of Ahmedabad with aim of raising fund to repair and renovate the fort of Ahmedabad damaged in floods. The committee levied 1% tax on the sale of various commodities such as ghee. It raised 2 lakh rupees and repaired the fort.

The Ahmedabad Municipality was founded in 1873. The British Government nominated Ranchhodlal Chhotalal as the first president of the municipality on 15 September 1885. The republic municipality was formed on 1 April 1915. Bhaishankar Nanabhai was the first elected president of the municipality.

Ahmedabad Borough Municipality came into existence in 1925–26. In 1935, the city celebrated the centenary of Ahmedabad municipality.
