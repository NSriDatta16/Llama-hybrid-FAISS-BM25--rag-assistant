The term Gharqad () is used in some Islamic hadith segments to describe a tree which according to Sunni Islamic eschatology, will protect the Jews fighting against Muslims on the time of a great war at the end times, specifically after the second coming of Jesus according to Islam.

The actual tree is identified with either the genus Nitraria or the genus Lycium.

Sunni Islamic interpretation
Within Sunni Islam, these narrations are understood as part of Sunni eschatology's description of a great war at the end times against the forces of Dajjal which should occur after the second coming Jesus according to Islam. Then, according to this eschatology, Jesus will lead an army of Muslims, some of whom are righteous Christians and righteous Jews converting to Islam in the eve of the battle, to fight the army of Dajjal consisted of Jews beleving Dajjal is a god, and if a Jew of Dajjal's army hides behind a stone or a tree, this stone or tree will miraculously talk to a Muslims to expose him unless it's a Gharqad tree, because its "their tree".

Sunni moderate writers debate the subject in pedantic eschatological terms, emphasizing that this should happen only in the end times after the second coming of Jesus in accordance to Sunni thought and should not damage current Islamic-Jewish relations.

According to one Sunni interpretation, Dajjal's army will not be consisted only of evil Jews but also of evil Christians and evil Muslims believing Dajjal is a god, fighting as soldiers and not as civilians. This specific interpretation was criticized for not referring to Jews alone, while the author noted that "No one disputes that this relates to future events and not to our time".

The general message of the text is often alleged as a prophecy but it does not appear in the Quran, which is considered by Muslims to be the godly revelation to Muhammad.
According to Memri TV, Qadhi described this text as referring to an end times war which is "a fight between good and evil" and that the text is "predictive and not prescriptive".

Non-Sunni Islam
Not all Muslims accept all hadith as reliable and may conclude somewhat different eschatology; most Shia Muslims reject Sunni hadith as unreliable and have their own hadith such as The Four Books. While according to Karimov, Zaydi Shia may hold Sunni hadiths with high esteem, Zaydis have their own main Hadith traditions. While some Ibadi Muslims do not consider Sunni Hadith as reliable and rely on Tartib al-Musnad, Hoffman noted that contemporary Ibadis often approve of the standard Sunni collections.

Dajani Daoudi concluded that by comprehensive review of the Quran, no such hadith would exist since it openly contradicts Islamic faith and that Muslims believe a hadith is the word of man while the Quran is the word of God. Dajani Daoudi added that "this hadith" (that which he quoted) was collected 150 years after the death of Muhammad, that the authenticity of such a hadith is disputed and that this particular hadith has become controversial for promoting anti-Jewish sentiments among Muslims.

Critical assessment

Insignificance of the tree in Judaism
Neither Nitraria nor Lycium have any sanctity in Judaism; they are not one of the four species of Sukkot, they are not one of the Seven Species of the Land of Israel and they are not one of the incense plants of the Torah; they are also not being used for Havdalah and there is no Jewish tradition of eating their fruits in Tu BiShvat.

Fundamentalism around the concept
According to Freyer Stowasser, modernist, deconstructionist approach to the apocalyptic hadith remains largely unacceptable to the traditionalists among the Sunni clerical establishment.

Possible use in incitement
The Gharqad narrations are often quoted alongside faulty generalizations to cause incitement against Jews such as that all Jews anywhere, anytime are "Killers of prophets", "greedy", "arrogant" or "Enemies of god" and alike ("Enemies of humanity before they are enemies of Muslims"), without considering that people of Jewish ancestry have free will to choose a religion or irreligion, may not practice Judaism (rather, another religion or no religion, without self definition as "enemies" of anything), or without an accuser's attempt to understand various different and conflicting Israelite or Jewish perspectives (Pharisees, Sadducees, Rabbanites, Karaites, Reforms and others) on religious issues, or without considering peaceful interpretations of scripture or tolerance, as common in cases of incitement caused by extremist radicals, most often fueled by political conflicts.

The claim that Israelis plant Gharqad trees
Some Sunni extremist radicals who strongly oppose the State of Israel have sprung a myth according to which Israeli Jews are planting millions of Gharqad trees all over Palestine in preparation for a dire war, although this is evidently false as Forests planted by Israeli authorities are typically made of Pine and Cypress with around 240 million Pine and Cypress trees planted. Olive is planted to a lesser extent and anything named "Gharqad" isn't planted at all.
