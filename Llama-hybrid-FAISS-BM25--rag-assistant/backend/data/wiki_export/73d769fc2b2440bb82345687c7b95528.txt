George Abercromby, 2nd Baron Abercromby (14 October 1770 – 15 February 1843) was a Scottish lawyer, politician and peer. The eldest son of Lt.-Gen. Sir Ralph Abercromby and Mary Abercromby, 1st Baroness Abercromby, he became, like his grandfather, a lawyer, and was called to the Bar in 1794. On his death in 1843 he was succeeded in the barony by his son.

Career
He was a Whig Member of Parliament for Edinburgh, 1805–1806; and for Clackmannanshire, 1806–1807 and 1812–1815. On the death of his mother on 11 February 1821 he succeeded to the title of 2nd Baron Abercromby. He also inherited the estate of Airthrey from his uncle, Robert Abercromby of Airthrey, in 1827. He was Lord Lieutenant of Stirlingshire, 1837–1843 and, despite his age and illness, greeted Queen Victoria on her progress through Scotland in 1842. Upon his death, he was buried at Tullibody.
