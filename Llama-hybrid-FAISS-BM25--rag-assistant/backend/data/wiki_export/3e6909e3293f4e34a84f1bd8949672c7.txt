The Hyundai Terracan is a mid-size SUV produced by the South Korean manufacturer Hyundai Motor Company from 2001 to 2007.

Overview
The design of the Hyundai Terracan was originally previewed by the Hyundai Highland concept and featured a chassis derived from the second generation Mitsubishi Pajero. It was powered by one of three engines: a 2.9 liter diesel inline-four Hyundai J engine, a 2.5 liter diesel inline-four licensed from Mitsubishi (4D56), and a 3.5 liter petrol V6 Hyundai Sigma engine. The car's name derives from Tarascan, a Mesoamerican empire state was located in west central Mexico. The Terracan was replaced by the Hyundai Veracruz.
