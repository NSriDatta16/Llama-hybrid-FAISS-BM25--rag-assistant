Main sights

Roman mosaic floor
The Roman mosaic in Nennig is the second largest mosaic north of the Alps, with a size of 160m². It was rebuilt in 1874 and restored in 1960. The mosaic has a 15.65 m × 10.30 m large, ornamental decorated surface, which is a gem that exceeds all mosaics that have been found in the Moselle region in Roman palaces and mansions.

Roman Villa Borg
The Roman Villa Borg has been reconstructed faithfully with lobbies, public baths, gardens and Roman tavern and also displays archaeological finds. Original recipes of the Roman gourmet Apicius are used for cooking.

Palace von Nell and parc von Nell
In 1733 the hereditary tenant of the Trier Cathedral Chapter constructed a stately house (palace), which later fell into the possession of a family from Nell. The residential building is a nine-axle, two-storey building with a front length of 24.30 m and a high kerb roof. Opposite the palace is a garden portal with a double-barreled external staircase that leads to the "Parc of Nell", which was transformed to a Baroque garden as part of the project "Gärten ohne Grenzen".

Besch military cemetery
The military cemetery commemorates the fallen of the Second World War. Three large stone crosses stand atop a blown up bunker. The cemetery is the last resting place of 1279 German dead and also 950 war victims of other nations.

Schloss Berg
Schloss Berg in Nennig consists of a lower and upper castle. The lower castle is private property and the upper castle has been rebuilt as the Renaissance-Schloss. Today it is a luxury hotel, a gourmet restaurant and a modern casino.
