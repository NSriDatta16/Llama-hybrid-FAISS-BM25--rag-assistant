The Regime (stylized as The ReGime) is an American hip hop collective created by Yukmouth in 1997, and originally included fellow rappers Tech N9ne, Phats Bossi, Madmax, Poppa LQ, Dizzle Don and Govnormatic. Not long after the original formation, Gonzoe of rap group Kausion and Lil Ke also joined. The group is signed to Yukmouth's Smoke-A-Lot Records, and share that label's dragon logo.

The Regime is unique when it comes to rap groups in that the members are from different states and cities around the U.S.. Besides guest appearances on numerous Yukmouth related projects, the group has released three mixtapes in the All Out War series and have plans for their debut album to be titled Regime Dragon Gang.
