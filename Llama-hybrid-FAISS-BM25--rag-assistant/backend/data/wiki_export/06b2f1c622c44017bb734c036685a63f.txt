History
Israel confiscated land from several Palestinian villages in order to construct Talmon, including:

taking land from private Palestinians citizens of Al-Janiya, 
land confiscated from the town of Al-Ittihad, 
in addition to 289 dunams confiscated from Al-Zaitounah.

Talmon was founded in 1989, with the name taken from the family name of the family of gatekeepers of the Temple in Jerusalem who returned to rebuild Jerusalem during the time of Nehemiah.

The settlement of Neria was originally built on land designated for Talmon, but it is now independent.
