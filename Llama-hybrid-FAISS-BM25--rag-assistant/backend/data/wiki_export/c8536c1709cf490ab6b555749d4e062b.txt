Lawrence Edward Moten (born March 25, 1972) is an American former professional basketball player.

Moten attended Archbishop Carroll High School in Washington, D.C., and the New Hampton School in New Hampton, New Hampshire before playing his college ball at Syracuse University. Playing as a guard/forward, he is the career scoring leader for that school with 2,334 points and graduated as the Big East Conference's all-time leading scorer with 1,405 points, ahead of Troy Bell (BC – 1,388 pts), Terry Dehere (SHU – 1,320 pts), and Chris Mullin (SJU – 1,290 pts). Moten averaged 19.3 ppg, 4.9 rpg and 2.4 apg over his four-year collegiate career – scoring in double figures in 118 of 121 games. He is the only player to score 500 or more points in four consecutive seasons in Syracuse history and was the first player since Hall of Famer Dave Bing to lead Syracuse in scoring for three straight seasons.

He was selected by the Vancouver Grizzlies in the 2nd round (36th overall pick) of the 1995 NBA draft. He played for the Grizzlies for two seasons from 1995–1997 and for the Washington Wizards during the 1997–98 season. After his NBA career, he played in the CBA and ABA, and in Spain and Venezuela. Moten later became the vice president of player development for the Maryland Nighthawks of the ABA.  He was the head coach of the Rochester Razorsharks in 2014 and led them to their 4th PBL title.

Moten, as of 2019, works with middle school youth in central New York.
