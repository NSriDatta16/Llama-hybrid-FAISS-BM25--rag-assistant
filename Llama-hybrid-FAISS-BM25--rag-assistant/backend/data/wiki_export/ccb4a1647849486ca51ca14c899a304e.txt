England, Wales and Northern Ireland
General Studies is a GCSE and former A-level examination offered to 16- to 18-year-olds in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It overlaps with PSHE and citizenship.

The GCSE syllabus covered arts and culture, politics and the economy, society and ethics, science and technology, and the relationships between these topics.

The A-Level syllabus was introduced in the 1950s, and intended to "â€œbroaden minds by encouraging students to develop their thinking skills, capacity to construct arguments and ability to draw conclusions", according to the AQA examination board. The syllabus covered " Culture and Society" (including culture, religion, philosophy, politics and the media); and "Science and Society" (including scientific research, technology and mathematics). It was withdrawn as an A-Level subject from 2017, with final examination in 2020.
