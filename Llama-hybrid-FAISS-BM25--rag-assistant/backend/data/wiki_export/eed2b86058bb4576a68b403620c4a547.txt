is a kata (a set of prearranged techniques) in Judo. It consists in five techniques, known only by their number. Although popular media generally claim that it was developed by Jigoro Kano, recent scientific research has conclusively shown that the kata predates the foundation of Kodokan judo and that Jigoro Kano took it from Tenjin Shinyō-ryū jujutsu and merely imported it into judo after he made minor amendments to it. The kata is generally considered unfinished. However, an unofficial completed performance version of the kata, expanded to ten techniques (by a European judoka as part of a Master’s level academic programme in judo coaching) was presented in 2012 under the name . The techniques of Itsutsu-no-kata are composed of gentle movements evocative of natural forces.
