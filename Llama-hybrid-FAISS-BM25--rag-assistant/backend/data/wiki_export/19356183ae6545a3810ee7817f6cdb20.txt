Renziehausen Park Rose Garden and Arboretum (258 acres) is a city park with rose garden and arboretum located on Eden Park Boulevard off Walnut Street, in the Pittsburgh suburb of McKeesport, Pennsylvania. It is open to the public daily without charge.

The rose garden contains some 1,200 rose bushes in 28 beds, plus an additional 3 raised beds containing 300 miniature rose bushes. The park also includes a bandshell, baseball fields, exercise trails, a fishing pond, picnic pavilions, tennis courts, and restrooms.

Renziehausen Park is named for siblings Henry and Emilie Renziehausen.  When they died, they left their money to the city of Pittsburgh after a family dispute over religion.  It was believed that the Renziehausens earned their money as haberdashers.  In reality, they made their money as bootleggers.  The park features a lake named after Emilie Renziehausen.
