Samuel Lee Gash Jr. (born March 7, 1969) is an American former football fullback in the National Football League (NFL).

Professional career

Gash was drafted in the eighth round of the 1992 NFL Draft by the New England Patriots. A two time Pro Bowler in his twelve-year career, Gash played for the Patriots (1992–1997), Buffalo Bills (1998–1999, 2003), and the Baltimore Ravens (2000–2002).
In 1999, Gash earned the unique distinction of being the first back in NFL history to be selected to the Pro Bowl without carrying the ball at all during the regular season.
He won a Super Bowl in 2000 with the Baltimore Ravens. Gash was cut by the New Orleans Saints one day before the 2004 training camp began.
