Crum: The Novel 
Written by former Crum resident Lee Maynard, it is a fictionalized account of life in Crum in the 1950s. When it was released in 1988, the book stirred up hostility in the town as many Crum residents took offense to Maynard's portrayal of Crum, despite the inclusion of a disclaimer at the beginning of the book explaining that the work is fictional except for the town name of "Crum." Still, a few Crum residents claim that characters and incidents in the book are clearly inspired by real-life people and events. Considered a "cult classic" by some, original copies were selling for large amounts on eBay before the book was re-released in 2001 by West Virginia University Press.

In 2006, actor/producer Ross Ballard and MountainWhispers.com audiobooks produced an audio version of Maynard's classic to a receptive national audience.
