Geography
Ferny Grove is a residential suburb  north-west of the Brisbane CBD. It has 8 parks covering nearly 13% of the total area. There are three schools and two childcare centres.

History
The district was originally known as Ferny Flats due to the presence of ferns.

Kedron Upper Provisional School opened on 16 August 1875. On 1 October 1909 it became Kedron Upper State School. In 1940 it was renamed Ferny Grove State School.

The construction of the railway line to Dayboro through the district led to the decision on 22 June 1916 to call the railway station in the area Ferny Grove to avoid confusion with a place called Ferny Flats in New South Wales. The suburb takes its name from the railway station.

The Dayboro railway line opened to Mitchelton railway station (the last station for a suburban passenger service) on 2 March 1918 and to Samford on 1 July 1918, so Ferny Grove railway station would have opened within that period.

Before the Second World War, Ferny Grove was mainly known for its pleasant picnic grounds along the banks of Kedron Brook and large areas of forest and fern filled valleys, one of which gives the suburb its name.

Before large-scale residential development, Ferny Grove was primarily industrial, containing a large claypit and tile factory operating south of the railway station.  When this factory ceased operation in the 1960s, Ferny Grove was redeveloped for housing.

After the war, while the area was still largely residentially undeveloped, the Brisbane City Council operated a nightsoil sanitation depot beside Cedar Creek.  The depot closed in the late 1960s as more of Brisbane was laid with sewerage infrastructure and the need for nightsoil treatment ended.

The Brisbane Tramway Museum Society was established in 1968, when it became apparent that the Brisbane City Council was preparing to close Brisbane's tram system. In 1972, the former nightsoil site at Ferny Grove was leased to the society to establish the Brisbane Tramway Museum () which opened in June 1980.

Ferny Grove State High School opened on 29 January 1980.

St Andrews Catholic Primary School opened on 21 July 1985.

Brisbane City Council continued to use the area south of the former nightsoil depot as a large refuse tip until the late 1980s. The ferny grove from which the suburb took its name is no longer there; for, situated at the present site of rubbish dump 40 years old, the grove was buried under a large hill, upon which the City Council operates a waste transfer station (resource recovery centre) and sports playing fields ().
