Notes

 The Location of Officials matters for precedence; an official enjoys different precedence within and without his or her state.
 Each State and Territory also has its own Table of Precedence.
 The recipients of Decorations or Honours gain precedence in the order of Seniority or Superiority of the Orders themselves; the Orders of Knighthood in Australia have the same seniority as in the United Kingdom, with a few insertions or promotions of entirely Australian, non-British honours; see Australian Honours Order of Wearing.
 Until 2022, no reference was made to the Chief Minister, the Leader of the Opposition or the Speaker of the Australian Capital Territory. This appeared to be an oversight after the ACT was granted self government. A new Table of Precedence was gazetted on 1 September 2022 which included the ACT.
