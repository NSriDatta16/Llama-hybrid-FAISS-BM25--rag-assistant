History
Aquinas High School, a Diocesan Catholic Secondary School, opened in 1957 following the merger of Boy's Catholic High School, operated by the Marist Brothers under the Roman Catholic Diocese of Savannah, and Mt. St. Joseph's Academy, owned and operated by the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet. Aquinas, one of the first co-institutional high schools in the nation, became co-educational in 1969, as recommended by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.

On October 5, 2007, Aquinas celebrated its 50th anniversary. During the festivities, a groundbreaking ceremony was held for an expansion of the school which included new classrooms, an improved dining hall, and new kitchen facilities. This new Grand Dining Hall opened in October 2008.
