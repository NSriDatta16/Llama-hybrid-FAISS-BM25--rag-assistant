Early life
Ikram was born in Lahore, Pakistan in 1965. She developed an interest in archaeology at the age of eight upon receiving copies of Nathaniel Hawthorne's Tanglewood Tales and Ancient Egypt by Time Life Books Editors. A visit to Egypt when she was nine heightened her interest in Egyptology.

Continuing her studies at the University of Cambridge, she earned her M.Phil. and PhD in Egyptology and Museum Studies. Her PhD thesis was entitled 'Choice cuts: meat production in Ancient Egypt'.

Ikram lives in Cairo and teaches Egyptology and Archaeology at the American University in Cairo, where she is a Professor of Egyptology. In 2017, Ikram was a visiting professor at Yale University for the fall term. There she taught the courses Death and Burial, and Food and Drink in Ancient Egypt. She was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2017 as an international honorary member.

She has also worked with André Veldmeijer of the Netherlands-Flemish Institute in Cairo on the Ancient Egypt Leatherwork Project (AELP). She co-directed the Predynastic Gallery Project.

During this congress there was an exhibition of mummies from different parts of the world, including the Guanche mummies of the ancient inhabitants of the island of Tenerife, with a technique similar to the Egyptian mummies.
