Basic Math is an educational cartridge for the Atari Video Computer System (later called the Atari 2600) developed by Gary Palmer of Atari, Inc. It was one of the nine launch titles offered when the console went on sale in September 1977. In 1980, Basic Math was renamed Fun with Numbers.

Gameplay

The player's objective is to solve basic arithmetic problems. Game variations determine whether the player solves addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division problems, and whether he/she could select the top number (the console randomly selects the lower number).

The player uses the joystick to enter an answer to the math problem. The game uses sound effects to signal whether the answer is right or wrong. If the player's answer is incorrect the game will then show the correct answer.

Reception
Basic Math was reviewed in Video magazine as part of a general review of the Atari VCS. It was described as "very basic" with reviewers drolly noting that "the controls of this game may be a little more complicated than the actual problems", and the game was scored a 5 out of 10.

In a retrospective look, Kevin Bunch wrote:

Legacy
On April 1, 2022, Atari announced Basic Math: Recharged, a web-based re-imagining of the original title.
