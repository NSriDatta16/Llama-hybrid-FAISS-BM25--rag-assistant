Name
The name Maewo is thought to have come from Mota or Raga as an attempt to transcribe the pronunciation . In the local languages it is spelled as N̄waewo . Other names for the island include Mwerlap N̄wēw  and Mwotlap Am̄ew  (with the locative prefix a-). All of these terms are thought to have come from Proto-North-Central Vanuatu (and Proto-Torres–Banks) *mʷaewo.

History
First recorded sighting of Maewo Island by Europeans was by the Spanish expedition of Pedro Fernández de Quirós at the end of April 1606. It was sighted again in 1768 by Louis Antoine de Bougainville who named it Aurora from the Latin word for "dawn", the time of day at which it was sighted.
