Critical reception

The album received generally positive reviews.

RPM reviewer David Spodek called it "an LP full of enough hard driving rock and roll and power chords to please any AOR MD" and named "Forget Me Not" as the best cut. Rock Hard gave an extremely positive review, and called it the "best AOR album of the past six months".

AllMusic's Dan Heilman gave the album four stars, saying, "[A]mid some tailor-made power ballads lurks some decent hard rock." 

LouderSound writer Dave Everley gave the album four stars, explaining the rating with "Bad English marked the end of an era, but what a last hurrah it was". Nonetheless, in 2016, "When I See You Smile" was ranked by LouderSound as the 10th-worst power ballad ever written.

Musician reviewer J. D. Considine wrote simply: "Grammar is the least of their problems."
