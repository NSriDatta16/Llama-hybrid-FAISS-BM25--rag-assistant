Football: FIFA World Cup, Quarter final
 1 – 1  (a.e.t.) A 49th-minute header by Roberto Ayala shocks the huge German crowd, but competition top scorer Miroslav Klose scores his 5th in the 80th minute. No further goals, and so to penalties: both teams have previously been in three World Cup penalty shoot-outs and never lost. Germany win 4–2 on penalties.
 3 – 0  A 6th-minute goal by Gianluca Zambrotta gives Italy the lead. Luca Toni scores a header after 59 minutes following poor Ukrainian defending, and he scores a second ten minutes later.
2006 Tour de France: On the day before the prologue in Strasbourg, Jan Ullrich and Óscar Sevilla are suspended by their T-Mobile Team following an anti-doping investigation in Spain and Team CSC rider Ivan Basso has been excluded from the tour. Ullrich and Basso were considered the favorites to claim the overall yellow jersey following the retirement of Lance Armstrong following his seven straight championships. Also excluded from the tour is Francisco Mancebo (Ag2r). Astana-Würth has decided to withdraw its team, on the basis of five of their  riders, including Joseba Beloki, appearing on the investigation list, which also removes Alexander Vinokourov from the tour.

Football: FIFA World Cup, Round of 16 (final day)
 3 – 0  Ronaldo scores within 5 minutes to become the all-time highest-scoring player in World Cup finals (15). Adriano scores from an offside position just before half time, despite Ghana having the bulk of possession.

Asamoah Gyan gets red carded late in the game for an attempted dive.
 1 – 3  Two evenly matched enterprising teams produce a fine advert for the beautiful game. A 28th-minute penalty by David Villa gives Spain the lead, while a 42nd-minute goal by Franck Ribéry following a beautiful run makes things all-square at half time. With seven minutes to full-time Patrick Vieira gives France the lead for the first time.

Cricket: Indian cricket team in West Indies in 2006:
Third Test at St Kitts: Match drawn. Winning the toss and electing to bat, the West Indies compiled 581 in two-and-a-half days. Daren Ganga (135) and Ramnaresh Sarwan (116) scored centuries, while Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh claimed five wickets. India responded with 362 (VVS Laxman 100), short of the follow-on target, but Brian Lara opted to bat again. In the second innings, West Indies declared its innings closed at 172/6, giving India a victory target of 392 with under a day's play remaining. The visitors were unable to achieve the target in the time remaining, the Test ending in a draw. The four-Test series remains tied at 0–0. (Complete scorecard)
Football: FIFA World Cup, Round of 16
 1 – 0  A fairly even match with Australia having most possession, conducted in a sporting manner despite Marco Materazzi's 50th minute dismissal for a scything tackle. Francesco Totti scores a penalty with the last kick of the match.
 0 – 0  A profoundly tedious match between two teams both afraid of losing – there was not a single offside decision in the whole first 90 minutes, the match goes into extra time, and ends up in a penalty shootout, which Ukraine wins 3–0.
Baseball: NCAA College World Series Championship Series, Game 3 (best-of-three):
Oregon State 3, North Carolina 2. The Beavers, who won the series 2–1 over the Tar Heels, became the first northern-based CWS champions since Ohio State won in 1966, and the first to lose two CWS games since the introduction of the current format in 2002 thanks to Bill Rowe scoring on Tar Heels second baseman Bryan Steed's throwing error.

The game gets off to a scintillating start with two goals in  the first nine minutes – Rafael Márquez puts Mexico ahead, then a goal by Hernán Crespo puts Argentina back on level terms.

Group F:  2 – 2  A pulsating match between two closely related teams (seven of the Australian squad have Croatian antecedents, and three of the Croatian team are Australian-born), which Croatia needed to win and Australia only to draw. Croatia score in the second minute, Australia score a penalty, a goalkeeping howler gifts Croatia a second goal, Harry Kewell puts Australia back on level terms; both sides are reduced to 10 men in the last 10 minutes, and referee Graham Poll forgets to red-card Josip Simunic for a second bookable offence, but does for a third. A third Australian goal is disallowed as the full-time whistle is blown as it is going in. Brazil and Australia progress from the group. (FIFA)
