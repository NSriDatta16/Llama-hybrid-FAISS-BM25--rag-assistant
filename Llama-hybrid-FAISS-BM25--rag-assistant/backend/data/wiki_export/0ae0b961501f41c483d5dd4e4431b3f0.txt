History
Mount Olivet was consecrated in 1885, and was the first Catholic cemetery to be established in the south side of Chicago.  There are over 142,200 people buried at the cemetery, with over 150 annual interments.  The cemetery is  in size.  It became one of the first major area cemeteries to become full, until the purchase and development of additional lands along what had been the eastern border of the cemetery.

Mount Olivet was the original burial location of Al Capone, who was laid to rest between the graves of his father and brother.  A few years after his death, the remains of all three men were moved to Mount Carmel Cemetery in Hillside, Illinois upon the death of Capone's mother.
