In Rape Fantasy and Terror Sex We Trust is the sixth full-length album by Joan of Arc, released in 2003 on Perishable Records. The songs were recorded in the same sessions as So Much Staying Alive and Lovelessness, and the album is thought to be something of a companion album to that record. The title track was created as an attempt by Tim Kinsella to capture the effect Bauhaus' The Sky's Gone Out had on him "when he was 10yrs old and accidentally bought it before he was ready to hear it". This is one of the few Joan of Arc albums not to receive a vinyl release.
