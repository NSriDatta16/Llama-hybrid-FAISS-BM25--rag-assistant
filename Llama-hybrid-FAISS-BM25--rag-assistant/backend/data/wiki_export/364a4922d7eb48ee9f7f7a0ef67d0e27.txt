Elworth is a village in the county of Cheshire, located in the North West of England, and is a suburb of the town of Sandbach, located approximately one mile eastward.

Elworth is known for its industrial past, having historically been the home of Foden's HGV manufacturers. The village also features two churches, Mount Pleasant Methodist Church and St Peter's Church of England, the latter of which was designed by George Gilbert Scott, noted for having also designed St Pancras railway station in London; Elworth also features Sandbach railway station, which serves the line between Sandbach, Crewe and Manchester.

History
In February 2010, St. Peter's Church Hall – the village's former school, and adjacent to St. Peter's church itself – was significantly damaged by a fire, the cause of which was, though never determined, thought to be electrical. The church hall had previously been used as a community centre, hosting a pre-school nursery, an after-school club, and many other community groups. Following a consultation, it was decided to demolish the original building, which had been deemed too badly damaged to be reparable, and to rebuild a new, purpose built hall in its place.

Work began in early 2011 with clearing the site, and building work began in May of the same year. The church hall officially re-opened in March 2012. The Methodist Church, nearby to St Peter's, continues to host the Boys' Brigade, Brownies, Under 4s, a painting group, badminton, pilates, Zumba, Tuesday coffee and light lunches, Thursday evening all-sorts and line dancing.
