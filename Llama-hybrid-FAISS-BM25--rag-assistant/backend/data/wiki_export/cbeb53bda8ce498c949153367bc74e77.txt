Munseong of Silla (died 857) (reigned 839–857) was the 46th ruler of the Korean kingdom of Silla.  He was the eldest son of King Sinmu and Lady Jeonggye.

Munseong's reign was typical of late Unified Silla, with rampant strife and uprisings.  Examples include the 841 rebellion of Hong Pil, the 846 rebellion of Jang Bogo (after he failed to marry his daughter into the royal line), as well as the treason of Kim Sik in 849.

The earlier part of his reign was marked by relatively  active trade and commerce with both Japan and Tang China.  This was due to Jang Bogo's role in securing the major shipping routes.

Upon his death in 857, King Munseong was buried in the Gongjakji tomb precinct in Gyeongju.  He was succeeded by his uncle Heonan.
