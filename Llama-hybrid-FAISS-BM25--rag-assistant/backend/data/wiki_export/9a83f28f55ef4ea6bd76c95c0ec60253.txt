Rude Dog is a fictional animated white dog originally created by artist Brad McMahon while under contract to Sun Sportswear in the 1980s as part of a line of surfing- and skateboarding-related clothing. As of 30 August 2015, Rude Dog was once again trademarked, this time in the name of original series/character creator Brad McMahon. McMahon also created Rude Dog's gang of canine misfits known as "the Dweebs", as well as Seymour, Rude Dog's nemesis.
