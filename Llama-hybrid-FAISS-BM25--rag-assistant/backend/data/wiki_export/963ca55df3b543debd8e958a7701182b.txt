Barbara Everett (born 1932) is a Canadian-born British academic and literary critic, whose work has appeared frequently in the London Review of Books and The Independent. In addition to her own publications, she is recognised as a leading Shakespeare scholar.

Everett was born in Montreal, Canada. A graduate of St Hilda's College, Oxford, she is a retired Fellow of Somerville College. She was married to the late Oxford scholar of English literature, Emrys Jones, with whom she appeared in the 1996 documentary Looking for Richard.

Frank Kermode described her as "a connoisseur of styles" with "a distinctive style of her own", and her 1986 book, Poets in their time as "one of the finest collections of criticism for years".
