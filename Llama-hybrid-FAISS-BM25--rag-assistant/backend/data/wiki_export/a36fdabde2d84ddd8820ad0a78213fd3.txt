History
Pakistan Marine Academy was established in erstwhile East Pakistan Chittagong, in 1962.  It was located on the east bank of the Karnafuli River, facing the Bay of Bengal. It was established under Colombo Plan and began functioning from 3 September 1962. It was the first institution of its kind ever established in Pakistan to train merchant marine officers. Officers and staff from Pakistan Navy and known merchant mariners, trained from the private workshops took hold of the administration of this institution. Originally, the academy provided pre-sea training for the cadets of Nautical and Engineering Branches. First batch of 41 cadets successfully passed out from the academy in 1964.

In 1971 the academy was shifted to Karachi and was housed temporarily in the two blocks of Haji Camp; thereafter, 1976, the academy was relocated at purpose built huge infrastructure at its current location.

 
Prime Minister of Pakistan Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto inaugurated the institution in a stone laying ceremony. This campus occupied an area of 136 acres and is loaded with all the desired facilities. Commodore S.M. Anwar was the first Commandant of this renewed institution. Under his tenure the Auditorium (Anwar Hall), Computer lab and mosque was inaugurated. He embraced the academy with all the lacking facilities which included 8-bedded hospital; Engineering and Nautical model rooms. In 1979, Seamen Training Centre(STC) was also shifted inside the academy from Haji Camp which worked under Ministry of Communications.

In 1986, Pakistan Marine Academy was affiliated with Karachi University and became a degree awarding institution. BSc. Maritime Studies in Marine Engineering and Nautical Sciences were awarded to all the graduates of this institution. In 1997, Seamen Training Centre(STC) was renamed as Seamen Training Wing(STW) and became a subordinate body of Pakistan Marine Academy. In 2002 the marking system was changed from percentage system to GPA system as per the standards. Today, Pakistan Marine Academy houses 340 undergraduates and produces 170 graduates each year. The Seamen Training Wing houses 70 General Purpose trainees and produces 140 General Purpose Crew each year and is also conducting post-sea courses for the seafarers.

In 2012, NED University of Engineering and Technology affiliated Pakistan Marine Academy. As per the revised regulations of Higher Education Commission Pakistan, the two years BSc degree program was replaced by two years associate degree program (Equivalent to Higher National Diploma) in all the universities offering bachelor's degree after two years of higher studies. Hence forth NED University of Engineering and Technology was approved for the award of this associate degree in Ship Management or Marine Engineering to the academy's Nautical and Engineering cadets respectively on successful completion of their two years training.

Pre-sea courses
There are three pre-sea courses conducted by the academy. 
 Two years associate degree program in marine engineering.
