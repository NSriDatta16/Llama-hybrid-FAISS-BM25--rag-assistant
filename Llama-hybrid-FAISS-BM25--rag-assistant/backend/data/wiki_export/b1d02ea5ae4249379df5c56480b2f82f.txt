History
The original Port Moody High School, which was located on the grounds of the current Moody Middle School, burned to the ground in 1969. A site was chosen for the new Port Moody Senior Secondary School, which opened in 1973. A mythological bird that rises from the ashes, "The Phoenix", was appropriately chosen as the school's new mascot. The team name selected was the Port Moody Blues. Built to accommodate 900 students, Port Moody Secondary has grown to a population of well over 1 300 and a staff of about 100. From 2000-2002, the school underwent renovation; the new three-story tower and gymnasium addition was completed. Enrollment at the school has dropped in recent years, due in part to the changing demographics of the neighbourhood it is located in. Port Moody also used to offer the Cambridge Latin Course.

Extracurricular activities

Port Moody is home to numerous extracurricular clubs. The Student Council hosts events to benefit the school in many ways, including the annual Spring Fling and school dance. The school is also home to the PMSS Leadership Committee which hosts the annual Talent Show and has a comprehensive leadership program called SOAR. Humanitarian groups include Red Cross, UNICEF, Community Leadership Force, and MSF (Doctors Without Borders). The Debate Team has competed at the regional, provincial and national levels, winning the regional championship in 2012 and 2013, later coming 3rd overall in the country. Their debate team has also produced three national team members, who have gone on to win several international competitions. The school also has an Improv Team which takes yearly involvement in the Canadian Improv Games.
