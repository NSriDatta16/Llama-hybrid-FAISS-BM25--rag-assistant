The Ionian University () is a university located in the Ionian Islands, Greece. It is one of the newest institutions of Higher Education in Greece, created in 1984 pursuant to presidential order 83/84 ΦΕΚ 31 Α/20-3-84, along with the University of the Aegean and the University of Thessaly. In 2018, TEI of Ionian islands merged into the Ionian University.

The university opened its doors to students in Corfu in 1985. Until 2018 it consisted of six departments (History, Foreign Languages and Translation, Music Studies, Library, Archival and Museum Studies, Audiovisual Arts, and Informatics). By incorporating and restructuring the Ionian Technological Education Institute, in the academic year 2019-2020 the Ionian University expanded to comprise a total of twelve departments on four islands of the Ionian Sea (Corfu, Lefkada, Kefalonia, Zakynthos), offering undergraduate and postgraduate degree programmes and summer schools.

History
The Ionian Academy was the first Greek University of modern times, established in 1824 by Frederick North, 5th Earl of Guilford. It was in operation in Corfu for forty years, until 1864, up to the Union of the Ionian Islands with the Greek State.

The Ionian University was established in 1984 by the Greek government under the Prime Ministership of Andreas Papandreou in recognition of Corfu's contribution to education in Greece as the seat of the first University of Greece, the Ionian Academy, that was established in 1824, forty years before the cession of the Ionian islands to Greece and just three years after Greece's Revolution of 1821. The Prime Ministership thus kept an election promise to the people of Corfu, satisfying their long held demand that a successor university to the Ionian Academy be built. On 21 May 1985, the founding of the Ionian University was announced in a speech at City-Hall square in Corfu city.

Faculties and Departments
The university includes five Faculties (Schools), consisting of twelve Departments.

Research
The Special Account for Research Grants (S.A.R.G.) of the Ionian University was established in 1988 in order to meet the need to manage research grants from various sources that are to be invested in research, educational, training, and developmental projects, as well as other related services or activities which contribute to the establishment of linkages between education, research and the production market.

Up to this day, the Ionian University S.A.R.G. has developed over 160 research projects and educational programmes financed by the European Committee, International Organisations, the General Secretariat for Research and Technology, ministries, banks, other state organisations, as well as private institutions.

According to the Senate's decision, the Ionian University S.A.R.G.’s proceeds are used for the students’ education, to finance other research projects and serve different purposes, such as the award of scholarships to postgraduate students.
