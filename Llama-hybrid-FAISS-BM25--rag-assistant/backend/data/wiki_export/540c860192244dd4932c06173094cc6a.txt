Professional career

NBA
Boone was picked 23rd overall in the 2006 NBA draft by the New Jersey Nets. He was picked right behind former UConn teammate, Marcus Williams who was also selected by the Nets. During the 2006 Pepsi Pro Summer League in Orlando he led the league in rebounding (9 rpg) and was 2nd in blocked shots (1.67 bpg).

After the summer league he underwent surgery to repair a torn labrum in his left shoulder and was expected to be out for 4–6 months, however he returned much earlier. Boone made his NBA debut December 2, 2006, against the Philadelphia 76ers, playing 2 minutes. Suffering the effects of the injury and missing the pre-season training, Boone had an inconsistent but promising rookie season.

Boone averaged 4.2 points per game, 2.80 rebounds per game and 0.3 blocks per game during his rookie season. On December 26, 2006, he had a season-high of 12 rebounds against the Detroit Pistons, a game in which he played 30 minutes, the most he had played hitherto. Boone had a then career-high 21 points on 10-for-10 shooting, while grabbing six rebounds on March 24, 2007, against the Charlotte Bobcats in Charlotte. The following game, on March 28 against the Indiana Pacers, Josh eclipsed his previous career-high by scoring 22 points on 11-for-13 shooting. He also posted his first double-double by grabbing 10 rebounds.

In late December 2007, Boone earned a spot in the starting lineup. He replaced Jason Collins as the starting center and contributed immediately, putting up a double-double almost every night. During the month of January, Boone was the target of a "Hack-a-Shaq" by Golden State Warriors coach Don Nelson, in which a player is intentionally fouled repeatedly to take advantage of his poor foul shooting. That season, Boone was second-worst in the NBA in free-throw percentage among players with at least one hundred attempts, at 45.6%

Boone would see fewer minutes with the Nets, in part due to his free throw shooting. His accuracy at the line continued to deteriorate, as he hit 37.6% in 2008–09 and 32.8% in 2009–10. Only one player in the league with at least ten attempts had a lower percentage, Andris Biedrins, who made four of twenty-five attempts.
