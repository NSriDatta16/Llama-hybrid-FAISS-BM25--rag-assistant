Vincent Fella Rune Møller Hendricks (born 6 March 1970) is a Danish philosopher and logician. He holds a doctoral degree (PhD) and a habilitation (dr.phil) in philosophy and is Professor of Formal Philosophy and Director of the Center for Information and Bubble Studies (CIBS) at University of Copenhagen, Denmark. He was previously Professor of Formal Philosophy at Roskilde University, Denmark. He is member of IIP, the Institut International de Philosophie in Paris.

Work
Hendricks's work deals with modern mathematical and philosophical logic and concentrates primarily on bringing mainstream and formal approaches to epistemology together — from epistemic reliabilism, counterfactual epistemology and contextualism to epistemic logic, formal learning theory and what is called 'modal operator epistemology'. Modal operator epistemology, developed first by Hendricks in The Convergence of Scientific Knowledge (Dordrecht: Springer, 2001), since developed further in a number of papers and books – see in particular Mainstream and Formal Epistemology (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2006, winner of CHOICE Outstanding Academic Title 2006) – is the cocktail obtained by mixing alethic, tense and epistemic logic with elements from formal learning theory in order to study the limiting validity of convergent knowledge.

Vincent F. Hendricks is editor-in-chief of Synthese Library and New Waves in Philosophy,  he is also the first founder of ΦLOG – The Network for Philosophical Logic and Its Applications  and chief editor of ΦNEWS – The Newsletter for Philosophical Logic and Its Applications.

In 2008, Vincent F. Hendricks was awarded the Elite Research Prize by the Danish Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation and HRH Crown Princess Mary. In 2008 he was awarded the Roskilde Festival Elite Research Prize.

Controversies

In 2012, Hendricks attracted criticism from some philosophers for doing a photo shoot that depicts young women dressed in sexy school uniforms in a classroom setting and presenting it on his web site. Hendricks later withdrew the pictures from his web site and apologized. The photos were taken as part of a charity drive arranged by a Danish-language charity "Youmeshopping".
