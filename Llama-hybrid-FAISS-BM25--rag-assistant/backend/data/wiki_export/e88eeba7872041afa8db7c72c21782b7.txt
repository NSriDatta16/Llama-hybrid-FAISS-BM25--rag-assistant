Grant Miehm is a Canadian illustrator who has worked for a number of different American comics publishers.

Career
Miehm's work began appearing in the mid-1980s, in various titles produced by independent publishers, beginning with Elementals #15 (July 1987) from Comico: The Comic Company. Miehm cites various artists as influences but notes that: "I also think any creative person is influenced by everything around them --- so aside from artists whose work I admire, life itself imprints upon the psyche of the artist".

After drawing The American for Dark Horse Comics, Miehm worked for DC Comics from approximately 1988 to 1993, drawing for numerous titles including The Flash, Justice Society, Green Arrow, and Suicide Squad. He was both artist and plotter on Impact Comics' Legend of the Shield with dialogue by Mark Waid. Miehm has also worked on several Marvel Comics characters (Quasar, Namor: The Sub-Mariner and others) and The Avengers. He has drawn for television-related titles such as Disney's Gargoyles and Saban Entertainment's Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers.

In 1999, Miehm began packaging the long-running "Scouts in Action" feature – writing, drawing, ink, color, typography, logo designs – as well as a variety of assignments for Boys' Life (now Scout Life) magazine. The feature was expanded to a second page – "More S.I.A" – with the September 2007 issue, with Miehm providing all art and writing for this page as well. The "Scouts in Action" franchise was expanded yet again – with Miehm at the helm on all creative duties – when "Scouters In Action" made its debut in the January–February 2015 issue of Scouting magazine, a sister publication to Boys’ Life. This feature is devoted to recounting true stories of adult Scout leaders involved in acts of heroism similar to those seen in "Scouts in Action" and "More S.I.A.".

Miehm's other freelance work includes assignments in the advertising and commercial illustration fields.
