Fiestas and Fiascos is the final Lifter Puller LP composed of new material and the only album of theirs not included on Soft Rock. The record is much tighter than previous songs, as where the band plays hook-centrically and vocalist Craig Finn sings with more vocal force (shouting at times) than melodicism. The almost exclusively mythological focus of "Fiestas and Fiascos" in many ways foreshadows the approach Finn would take with The Hold Steady, as does the less melodic vocal approach. In addition, the record ends with the burning of the "Nice Nice", bringing the Lifter Puller folklore back to its start.
