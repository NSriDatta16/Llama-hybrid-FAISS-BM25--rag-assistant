Soseong of Silla (died 800) (r. 798–800) was the 39th to rule  the Korean kingdom of Silla.  He was the grandson of King Wonseong, his father Kim In-gyeom having died before he could take the throne.  He married Lady Gyehwa, the daughter of the daeachan Suk-myeong.

Soseong died only nineteen months after taking the throne. This brought on a renewal of the succession strife which typified later Unified Silla.

Soseong of Silla, who was raised in the royal court before he ascended the throne, was given a royal rite in 789, and went to the Tang dynasty in 790. He was appointed to the Si-jung in October 791, but retired due to illness in August the following year. When Uncle Uiyoung died early in 794, he was proclaimed Crown Prince in the year 795.
