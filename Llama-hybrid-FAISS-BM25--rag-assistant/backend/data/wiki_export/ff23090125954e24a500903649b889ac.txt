Pietro Crinito (22 May 1474 â€“ 5 July 1507), known as Crinitus, or Pietro Del Riccio Baldi (derived from Riccio, 'curly', translated into Latin as crinitus), was a Florentine humanist scholar and poet who was a disciple  of Poliziano. 

He is best known for his 1504 commonplace book, De honesta disciplina. This has been taken to be a source for the work of Nostradamus.
