WEON-LP (channel 60) was a low-power television station in Frederiksted, Saint Croix, serving as the Fox affiliate for the United States Virgin Islands. Owned by Caribbean Broadcasting Network, it was a sister station to WVGN-LD (channel 19), WVXF (channel 17), and WVGN.

WEON-LP had a construction permit for its digital signal on channel 42.

The station's license was canceled by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on February 20, 2013, as it had not broadcast since December 31, 2011. Fox programming has since shifted to LKK's WVXF-DT2, where it is carried in high definition.
