The Miss Norway (formerly known as "Frøken Norge") is a national beauty pageant in Norway The pageant was founded in 1950, where the winners were sent to Miss Universe.

History
The Miss Norway was held for first time in 1950 by Dagbladet Magazine. There were no official Frøken Norge or Miss Norway titleholders from 1975 to 1982 during which Norwegian model agencies sent girls to international pageants. Since 1983 the pageant was run by Frøken Norge Corporation. In 2000 - 2010, the pageant was sponsored by TV2 Network.

Traditionally, the winner will get a chance to compete at Miss World pageant. Meanwhile, the runners-up will compete at Miss Universe, Miss International and Miss Europe. Sometimes the winner will be able to compete at the other pageants. 
In May 2012, a new concept called "Miss Universe Norway" was established by the company "Motivaction AS" after the application for the license for Miss Universe in Norway was approved.

From 1985 to 2011, "Frøken Norge" (registered trademark) with supervisor Geir Hamnes, sent candidates to Miss World and Miss Universe. From 1983 to 2008, "Miss Norway" (registered trademark) run by Geir Killingland, sent representatives to other beauty pageants such as Miss International, Miss Earth and others. After mr. Killingland died in 2009, his friends and family recovered "Miss Norway" in 2010, as a tribute to Killingland, and sent representatives to Miss Earth and Miss International that year.

In 2017 the Miss Norway selects representatives to compete in Miss Universe, Miss World, Miss International.
