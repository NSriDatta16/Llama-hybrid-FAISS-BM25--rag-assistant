U.S. Route 6 (US 6) travels east–west near the north edge of the U.S. state of Pennsylvania from the Ohio state line near Pymatuning Reservoir east to the Mid-Delaware Bridge over the Delaware River into Port Jervis, New York. It is the longest highway segment in the commonwealth. Most of it is a two-lane rural highway, with some freeway bypasses around larger towns. Except east of Dunmore, where it is paralleled by Interstate 84 (I-84), it is the main route in its corridor. What is now I-80—the Keystone Shortway—was once planned along the US 6 corridor as a western extension of I-84. The corridor was originally the Roosevelt Highway from Erie, Pennsylvania, to Port Jervis, New York, designated Pennsylvania Route 7 (PA 7) in 1924. The PA 7 designation soon disappeared, but, as US 6 was extended and relocated, the Roosevelt Highway followed it. The Pennsylvania section of US 6 was renamed the Grand Army of the Republic Highway in 1946; this name was applied to its full transcontinental length by 1953.

US 6 meets with US 19 near Meadville, where it turns north with US 19 to a point east of Edinboro. There it turns east (while US 6N heads west to US 20 at West Springfield) and passes through the Northern Tier. At Towanda, it turns more southeasterly to reach Dunmore, then turning back northeast out of Dunmore to Carbondale and generally east and southeast to New York. US 6 fully encompasses two Pennsylvania Scenic Byways: the Gateway to the Endless Mountains Scenic Byway along the bypass of Tunkhannock and the Governor Casey Scenic Byway along the freeway portion in Lackawanna County between I-81 in Dunmore and PA 247 in Jessup.

At  in length, US 6 is the longest numbered highway in Pennsylvania.

Route description

Ohio to Warren

US 6 enters Pennsylvania from Ohio in Crawford County, heading southeast as a two-lane undivided road through farmland and woodland to the north of Pymatuning State Park, which is home to Pymatuning Reservoir. The route heads into the borough of Linesville, where it heads southeast through developed areas of the borough on Penn Street before turning east onto East Erie Street, passing north of Conneaut Area Senior High School. The road continues southeast through more rural areas as it heads away from the state park, passing over the Canadian National Railway's Bessemer Subdivision railroad line. US 6 intersects the southern terminus of PA 618 before it reaches a junction with PA 285 on the western edge of the borough of Conneaut Lake. Here, US 6 heads east for a concurrency with PA 285 and the two routes head east through the borough on Water Street. The road intersects US 322/PA 18 in the center of Conneaut Lake, where the two routes join US 6 and PA 285. A block later, PA 285 splits to the south. US 6/US 322/PA 18 become a five-lane road with a center left-turn lane and head east out of the borough, passing to the south of Conneaut Lake. PA 18 splits from US 6/US 322 by turning to the north, with US 6/US 322 continuing east-northeast on Conneaut Lake Road through farms and woods with some development. The road heads into a business area to the west of the city of Meadville and comes to a roundabout with US 19 and the southern terminus of PA 98, at which point US 19 becomes concurrent with US 6 and US 322. The roadway becomes a four-lane divided highway and comes to a cloverleaf interchange with I-79. Past this interchange, the three routes reach an intersection with the southern terminus of PA 102 before curving north and entering Meadville upon crossing French Creek and a Western New York and Pennsylvania Railroad line. The road becomes French Creek Parkway and US 322 splits to the east, with US 6/US 19 continuing north through developed areas to the east of the railroad line. The two routes leave Meadville and narrow to a two-lane undivided road, passing through wooded areas with some fields and development as it follows the French Creek and the Western New York and Pennsylvania Railroad. In the borough of Saegertown, US 6/US 19 head north along Main Street and form a concurrency with PA 198, intersecting PA 198 at roundabouts on either end of the borough. The road continues northeast through more rural areas alongside the creek and railroad, reaching the borough of Venango.

Mile markers

The PA Route 6 Tourist Association and the PA Route 6 Task Force developed the DO 6 Mile Marker Program, which installed "Do 6" mile markers along the entire length of US 6 in Pennsylvania, in addition to US 6N. The mile markers begin at mile marker 1 near the Ohio border and increase east to mile marker 400 near the New York border, while US 6N has mile markers 1N to 27N. They are intended to help motorists calculate distances between towns and points of interest along the highway and for businesses to use in their directions. The mile markers were funded by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources and were installed in 2008.

History
As approved by the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) on November 11, 1926, the west end of US 6 was at Kane, where US 120 continued west to Erie. (US 6 ended concurrent with US 219, which ran east to Mount Jewett along US 6 before turning north to New York.) US 6 also used present PA 706, US 11, and PA 106 between Wyalusing and Carbondale, while US 106 took the southerly route via Scranton.

By the end of 1927, US 6 had replaced US 120 in running west from Kane to Erie (making US 120 no longer connect to its "parent" US 20) and had swapped places with US 106 via Scranton; this took it along the Jefferson Highway. It was defined by AASHO to serve the following places in Pennsylvania: Erie, Waterford, Corry, Warren, Kane, Farmers Valley, Coudersport, Wellsboro, Canoe Camp, Mansfield, Towanda, Wyalusing, Tunkhannock, Clarks Summit, Scranton, Carbondale, Honesdale, Milford, and Matamoras. By 1930, its west end was at 26th Street (US 20) and State Street (US 6; now PA 505) in Erie. (By then, US 19 ended a block to the west on Peach Street, where it still ends today.)

This original routing deviates majorly from present US 6 in the following places, roughly using the following current routes:
PA 505 and PA 97, from Erie to Union City
PA 46, PA 446, and PA 155, from Smethport to Port Allegany
PA 660 and US 15 Bus. west of Mansfield

PA 92 and PA 307, from Tunkhannock to Clarks Summit

In 1931, US 6 was extended west to Greeley, Colorado. It left its old route—which then became US 6N—at Waterford and headed south on former PA 5 and US 19 and west on US 322 and former PA 77 into Ohio. This whole section from Waterford to Cleveland, Ohio, was regarded as temporary, but the only change was a relocation by 1936 along PA 79 from Union City west to US 19 south of Waterford. (Former US 6 from Mount Union to Waterford became PA 97. At the same time, US 6N was moved to the rest of former PA 79 from US 19 west to US 20—its current route.)

Since then, only minor realignments and bypasses have been made to the route of US 6.
