Jassa Singh Ramgarhia (1723–1803) was a prominent Sikh leader during the period of the Sikh Confederacy. He was the founder of the Ramgarhia Misl.

Early life

Jassa Singh Ramgarhia was born into a Sikh family in 1723. According to W. H. McLeod, his birthplace was the village of Ichogil, near Lahore, whilst H. S. Singha refers only to Lahore and Purnima Dhavan mentions origins in either Guga or Sur Singh, both near Amritsar. His father was named Bhagwan Singh, who himself was the son of Hardas Singh. There is agreement among the sources that he was of Tarkhan origin and was originally named Jassa Singh Thoka (Jassa Singh the Carpenter). He had four brothers - Jai Singh, Khushal Singh, Mali Singh, and Tara Singh - and became head of the family when his father, Giani Bhagwan Singh, died.

Jassa Singh rose to command the Sikh Misl that became later known as the Ramgarhia Misl and built a fort called Ram Rauni in honor of Guru Ram Das in Amritsar. He began his career as working for Adina Beg, who appointed him a risaldar (commander) and in 1752, rebuilt the damaged fort. The edifice was renamed Ramgarh, from which he took his new name.

Mir Mannu (Mu'in ul-Mulk), the Governor of Lahore, was worried about the increasing power of the Sikhs so he broke the peace. Mir Mannu also ordered Adina Beg, the Faujdar (garrison commander) of the Jalandhar region, to begin killing the Sikhs. Adina Beg was a very smart politician and wanted the Sikhs to remain involved helping them. In order to develop good relations with the Sikhs, he sent secret messages to them who were living in different places. Jassa Singh Ramgarhia responded and agreed to cooperate with the Faujdar and was made a Commander. This position helped him develop good relations with Divan Kaura Mal at Lahore and assign important posts to the Sikhs in the Jalandhar division.

The Governor of Lahore ordered an attack on Ram Rauni to kill the Sikhs staying in that fort. Adina Beg was required to send his army as well and Jassa Singh, being the commander of the Jalandhar forces, had to join the army to kill the Sikhs in the fort. After about four months of siege, Sikhs ran short of food and supplies in the fort.  He contacted the Sikhs inside the fort and joined them.  Jassa Singh used the offices of Divan Kaura Mal and had the siege lifted. The fort was strengthened and named Ramgarh; Jassa Singh Ramgarhia, having been designated the Jathedar of the fort, became popular as Ramgarhia.

Mir Mannu intensified his violence and oppression against the Sikhs. There were only 900 Sikhs when he surrounded the Ramgarh fort again. The Sikhs fought their way out bravely through thousands of army soldiers. The army demolished the fort. The hunt for and torture of the Sikhs continued until Mannu died in 1753. Mannu's death left Punjab without any effective Governor. It was again an opportune period for the Sikhs to organise themselves and gain strength. Jassa Singh Ramgarhia rebuilt the fort and took possession of some areas around Amritsar. The Sikhs took upon themselves the task of protecting the people in the villages from the invaders.In 1758, Adina Beg became the Governor of Punjab. Sikhs rebuilt their fort Ramgarh and repaired the Harmandir Sahib. Beg was well acquainted with the strength of the Sikhs and he feared they would oust him if he allowed them to grow stronger, Adina Beg send a strong army under Mir Aziz Bakshi, the Sikhs took up refuge in the Ram Rauni fort, Jassa Singh Ramgarhia, Jai Singh Kanhaiya and other Sikh chief's  were in the fort, Jassa Singh and Jai Singh Kanhaiya made several sallies and sorties and killed numbers of besiegers, but they had to evacuate the fort in the end,
