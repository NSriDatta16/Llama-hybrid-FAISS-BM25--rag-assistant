Stephen Lynn Bridges (May 22, 1963 – March 3, 2012) was an American comedian, impressionist, and actor who was known for his impressions of politicians, television characters and broadcasters including Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Barney Fife, Homer Simpson, Tom Brokaw, Paul Harvey, and Rush Limbaugh.

Early life
Bridges graduated from Biola University in 1986.

Career
His accurate portrayal of George W. Bush led to Bridges being cast as the president in episodes of both JAG and its spin-off, NCIS.

In 2006, he appeared alongside then-President Bush at the White House Correspondents' Association dinner, humorously mimicking the president by voicing the president's "inner thoughts" during Bush's speech.

Death
On March 3, 2012, Bridges was found dead by his maid in his Los Angeles home after he failed to return a call the day before. According to his agent, Bridges had just returned from performing in Hong Kong and went to bed complaining that he felt "super-jetlagged". His death was ruled an accident, with the probable cause "upper airway anaphylaxis" from a severe allergic reaction.
