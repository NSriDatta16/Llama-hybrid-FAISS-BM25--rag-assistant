Western Sydney Two Blues Rugby, formerly Parramatta Two Blues Rugby, is a rugby union club based in Parramatta, the second CBD of Sydney, Australia. The club was formed in 1879 and competes in the Shute Shield run by the New South Wales Rugby Union. One of the oldest clubs in the Sydney Premier Rugby competition the club has produced nineteen Wallabies over the years, starting with the great Bill Cerutti in 1936 through to the club's current, Tatafu Polota-Nau. To date Parramatta has played in eight First grade grand finals.

History
Western Sydney Two Blues Rugby Club has enjoyed 130 years of top grade rugby in Sydney's premier competition and is one of only five clubs (Manly, Randwick, Parramatta, Gordon and Warringah) to have never been relegated from the Top Grade.

Founded in 1879 as Cumberland, the club played in a senior Competition with University, Wallaroos, Waratah, Redfern and Pirates until 1899 when the existing system was disbanded.

The Club changed its name to Parramatta and was admitted to the Sydney First Grade competition in 1934 contesting its first Grand Final in 1945, a 9–3 defeat to Sydney University. The 1950s and 1960s were lean years but the development of a strong junior competition assured a sharp improvement in standards.

Former Wallaby Rod Phelps took over as captain-coach in 1971 and for three years he improved Parramatta‘s standing in the rugby fraternity. Grand Final appearances in 1974 and 1975 showed that the club was well on its way to becoming a force to be reckoned with.

Finally with the influx of young players in this period Parramatta won its initial First Grade premiership in 1977, a 17–9 victory against Randwick under coach Peter Fenton. The Two Blues had waited 44 years to sample the sweet taste of victory but the wait was worthwhile.

The Club then played in the 1979 and 1984 grand finals going down to Randwick on both occasions but revenge would be sweet in 1985 and 1986 when the underdogs from Sydney’s west succeeded in beating the Galloping Greens to win consecutive premierships under coach Paul Dalton.

In 2018 the club identified the need to evolve and deliver greater opportunity for the game of rugby in Greater Western Sydney. The clubs members originate from all across the West with the club making the strategic decision to re-brand from Parramatta Rugby Club to the Western Sydney Two Blues to better reflect our presence in the competition, our members and playing group and to take lead for the game of rugby in Western Sydney

Four of Parramatta’s favourite sons switched to League with success. Ken Kearney (a Wallaby in 1947 and 1948), Ray Price (a Wallaby between 1974 and 1976), Tony Melrose who played for the Wallabies in 1978 and 1979, and Andrew Leeds who played for his country between 1986 and 1988 all wore the Two Blues with pride and then switched to the Parramatta Eels. Leeds and Peter Kay, capped against England in 1988, were the club’s most recent Wallabies until Tatafu Polota-Nau played two Tests on the Wallabies 2005 Tour against England and Ireland.
