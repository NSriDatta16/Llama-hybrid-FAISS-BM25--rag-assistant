Leabhar Cloinne Aodha Buidhe, or Book of the Clandeboy O'Neill's, is the title accorded to a dunaire or poem-book of the Clandeboye branch of the O'Neill dynasty. It was written at the request of Cormac Ó Neill by the scribe Ruairí Ó hUiginn of Sligo in 1680.

It contains some late medieval content, such as the "Ceart Uí Néill" which includes a list of tributes claimed by the clan throughout Ulster. Poems include those authored by members of the bardic families of Ó Gnímh, Mac an Bhaird, Ó Maolconaire and Mac Muireadhaigh.

David Sellar, who was the Lord Lyon King of Arms in Scotland, stated that it dates from 1680.
