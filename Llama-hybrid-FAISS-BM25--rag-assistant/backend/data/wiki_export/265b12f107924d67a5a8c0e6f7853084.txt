Bernard Widrow (born December 24, 1929) is a U.S. professor of electrical engineering at Stanford University.  He is the co-inventor of the Widrow–Hoff least mean squares filter (LMS) adaptive algorithm with his then doctoral student Ted Hoff.  The LMS algorithm led to the ADALINE and MADALINE artificial neural networks and to the backpropagation technique. He made other fundamental contributions to the development of  signal processing in the fields of geophysics, adaptive antennas, and adaptive filtering.
