Goran Sudžuka (born 1969, Zagreb, Croatia) is a Croatian comic book artist, known for his work on books such as Y: The Last Man, Hellblazer: Lady Constantine and Ghosted.

Early life
Goran Sudžuka was born in 1969 in Zagreb, Croatia, in former Yugoslavia. He graduated from the School of Applied Arts and Design, Zagreb in 1988.

Career
Sudžuka began his work in animation at Zagreb Film. In 1990 he started collaborating with fellow Croatian Darko Macan on Albert the Butler, a series of short horror stories published in Croatia and Germany. Macan was the writer on most of the comics Sudžuka did in Croatia (some of those were later collected in a single volume called Sudžukice), including Svebor & Plamena, a teenage soap-opera which won him the award for Best Realistic Comic in Croatia in 1997.

In 1999 he began working for Vertigo, co-creating Outlaw Nation with writer Jamie Delano which won him the Russ Manning Best Newcomer Award at the Eisner Awards in 2001. In 2002 he illustrated the four-part series Hellblazer: Lady Constantine, written by Andy Diggle, and in 2005 he completed an album from the series L'Histoire Secrete for the French publisher Delcourt. From 2004 to 2007 Sudžuka was a regular fill-in artist on Brian K. Vaughan and Pia Guerra's Y: The Last Man. In 2007/08 he worked on another Hellblazer spin-off, Chas – The Knowledge written by Simon Oliver; in 2009 Sudžuka did two issues of the regular Hellblazer series written by Peter Milligan. In 2011 he completed A.D.D., a graphic novel for Vertigo written by Douglas Rushkoff and published in January 2012. Around the same time he also collaborated with writer Jason Aaron on issues 15 and 16 of Wolverine series. In 2013 he worked on the series Ghosted with Joshua Williamson for Skybound, and as fill-in artist on Brian Azzarello and Cliff Chiang's Wonder Woman.

Personal life
Sudžuka currently lives in Zagreb, Croatia. Among his artistic influences Sudžuka cites fellow Croatians Andrija Maurović, Ivica Bednjanec, Igor Kordey, Darko Macan and Edvin Biuković, as well as many other international artists.
