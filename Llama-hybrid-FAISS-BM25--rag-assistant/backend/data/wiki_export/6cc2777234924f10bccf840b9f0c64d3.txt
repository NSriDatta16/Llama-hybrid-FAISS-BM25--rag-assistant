"Thunderbirds / 3AM" (titled "Thunderbirds Are Go" on some editions of the single and album) is a double A-side single by English pop punk band Busted. It was released on 26 July 2004 as the fourth single from their second studio album, A Present for Everyone (2003). "Thunderbirds" was not originally included on the album, having been written specifically for the 2004 film Thunderbirds, although it later appeared on a re-issue of the album in Europe. "Thunderbirds" was not released on an album in the United Kingdom until the release of the group's live album A Ticket for Everyone: Busted Live in 2005.

"Thunderbirds / 3AM" was Busted's last single to enter the UK Singles Chart until the release of "On What You're On" in 2016, reaching number one. It was the 19th best-selling single of 2004 in the UK and also won the title of 2004 Record of the Year, and received an 8/10 rating from Stylus Magazine. "3AM" was later performed by Matt Willis during his 2007 solo tour, and by James Bourne on his 2012 acoustic solo tour.
