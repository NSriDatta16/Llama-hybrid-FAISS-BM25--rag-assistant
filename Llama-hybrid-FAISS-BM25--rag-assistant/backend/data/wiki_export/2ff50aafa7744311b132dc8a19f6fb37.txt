Master of Professional Studies (MPS) is a type of master's degree concentrated in an applied field of study. MPS degrees are often interdisciplinary. While Master of Arts and Master of Science degree programs tend to focus on theory and research, Master of Professional Studies degrees tend to emphasize practical skills designed for current and aspiring professionals, including post-bachelor and post-graduate students, and often require some amount of fieldwork or internship to complement classroom learning.

Admission to the MPS program typically requires documentation of professional experience and competencies, in addition to an earned undergraduate degree or postgraduate education and satisfactory standardized test scores such as the Graduate Record Examination.
