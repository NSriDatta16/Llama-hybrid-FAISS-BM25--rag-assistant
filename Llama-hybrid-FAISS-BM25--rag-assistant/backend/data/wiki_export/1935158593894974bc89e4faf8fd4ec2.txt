History 

On 17 June 2017, a landslide measuring  fell about  into Karrat Fjord, generating a megatsunami that hit Nuugaatsiaq. Initially it was unclear if the landslide was caused by a small earthquake (magnitude 4), but later it was confirmed that the landslide had caused the tremors. The tsunami had an initial height of , but it was significantly lower once it hit Nuugaatsiaq, where it had a run-up height of . Four people were killed and nine were injured at Nuugaatsiaq, and eleven buildings were washed into the water. Illorsuit also suffered tsunami damage. An evacuation of 170 residents of Illorsuit and Nuugaatsiaq followed because of a danger of additional landslides and waves. Illorsuit was abandoned in 2018, and as of March 2023, both llorsuit and Nuugaatsiaq remained uninhabited due to the continuing threat of landslide-generated tsunamis.

Transport 

Prior to Illorsuit′s abandonment, Air Greenland served the village as part of government contract, with mostly cargo helicopter flights from Illorsuit Heliport to Nuugaatsiaq and Uummannaq.
