Trivia

Prakash Mehra was originally considering Rajesh Khanna for the role of "Raja Singh", because Amitabh Bachchan and Khanna had made Namak_Haraam 10 years earlier, and it would be poetic justice to reverse roles in Namak Halal. But complications led Mehra to next consider Raj Babbar for the role, which eventually went to Shashi Kapoor.

Bachchan portrays the protagonist Arjun Singh, who was influenced by the character Hrundi Bakshi, the protagonist of the 1968 Hollywood film The Party; Hrundi Bakshi is an Indian character who was portrayed by British comedian Peter Sellers.

Bappi Lahiri scored music for the first time for a Prakash Mehra film, after Kalyanji-Anandji association with Prakash Mehra.

Smita Patil was initially less confident to film an intimate song (Aaj rapat jaye) in rain as she was supposed to be overdramatic in it. But after a lot of personal persuasion from co-actor Amitabh, she finally filmed the song with ease.
