History
Faujdarhat Cadet College boards up to 300 boys for grades 7 to 12. Every year, 50 students are admitted to the college at grade 7 through a nationwide admission test composed of written (Bangla, English, Mathematics, General Knowledge), Viva and Medical Examinations.

It was the first cadet college to be established by Field Marshall Muhammad Ayub Khan in erstwhile East Pakistan facing the Bay of Bengal. It was established on 28 April 1958. Until 1965, it was known as the East Pakistan Cadet College. The school has an area of 185 acres making it the largest high school in Bangladesh. The school was designed by the most prominent artist of Bangladesh, Joynul Abedin.

The principal of the school is usually ranked Colonel or Lieutenant Colonel, and is appointed by the Adjutant General's branch of the Bangladesh Army.

From 2003, the cadet colleges in Bangladesh were converted to the English version of the National Curriculum.

Academic system
Cadets are enrolled in class 7 of the Bangladesh National Curriculum and continue their study for six years up to the end of higher secondary or college level (high school in international standard). They follow the English version syllabus of the National Curriculum and Textbook Board. Three national exams are taken by cadets, once in class 8, named Junior School Certificate (JSC), another in class 10, named Secondary School Certificate (SSC) and the high school leaving examination in class 12 known as the Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC).

Each class generally has fifty students, divided into two sections which are known as forms. The Junior School Certificate (JSC), Secondary School Certificate (SSC) and the Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) examinations are administered under the direct control of the Board of Education of Chattogram Division. Cadets have shown a clear trend of securing top positions in the merit lists of board examinations every year.
