Anatoly Aleksandrovich Bulgakov (; born 14 September 1979) is a former Russian footballer. He was a defender.

Club career
Having played heavily during TP-47's adequate 2004 season, he was dropped to the sidelines in 2005, playing just one game. However, in this fixture, he scored a goal for the first time in the Finnish Premier League.

His efforts during this season, however, were not sufficient to avoid TP-47's drop into the Ykk√∂nen for the start of 2006.
