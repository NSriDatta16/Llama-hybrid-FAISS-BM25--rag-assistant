History
On 25 July 1911 a Propaganda Committee was formed to promote the sport of rugby union in Italy. In 1928 this body became the Federazione Italiana Rugby (FIR). In 1934 the FIR was a founder member of the Fédération Internationale de Rugby Amateur, now known as Rugby Europe.

The FIR joined the International Rugby Football Board, later known as the International Rugby Board and now as World Rugby, in 1987 when Italy took part in the inaugural World Cup.  The Italy national rugby union team has played in the Six Nations Championship since 2000.

Italy bid to host the 2015 Rugby World Cup came close to winning but lost to England by just three votes.
