Schick is an American brand of personal care products and safety razors which was founded in 1926 by Jacob Schick. It is currently owned by Edgewell Personal Care.

In the 2000s, Schick was second in sales to Gillette globally and was the top-selling brand of safety razors and blades in Japan. The Schick brand name is used in North America, Australia, Asia and Russia. In Europe, Edgewell sells the same items under the Wilkinson Sword brand name.

Schick also markets shaving gels.

History
Schick was founded in 1926 by Jacob Schick as the Magazine Repeating Razor Company. In the same year, Schick introduced its highly successful single-blade safety razor system, which stored twenty blades in a steel injector. Jacob Schick sold the company in 1928 and founded another company bearing his name, in order to market his newly invented electric shavers.

Patrick Frawley purchased controlling shares in Schick in 1955 and held onto the company until 1970, when the company became a division of Warner–Lambert. In February 2000, Pfizer bought Warner—Lambert along with all of its subsidiary companies. 

Schick was purchased by Energizer in 2003 from Pfizer. On July 1, 2015, Energizer split into two companies and Schick is now a subsidiary of Edgewell Personal Care.
