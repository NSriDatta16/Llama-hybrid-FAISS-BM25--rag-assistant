"I Could Be the One" is the fourth and final mainstream single from American singer-songwriter Stacie Orrico's self-titled second album. It was a limited release, being issued in the United Kingdom and Europe. It did not fare as well as the first three singles but nonetheless became her fourth top-40 hit in the UK.

Music video
The video for the song was done in the same vein as the "Stuck" video, which was also directed by Diane Martel and also features Orrico's cousin, actor Trevor Wright. The version of the song in the video is slightly longer than that appeared on the album, with an extra chorus between the breakdown and third verse. This version has never been commercially available.
