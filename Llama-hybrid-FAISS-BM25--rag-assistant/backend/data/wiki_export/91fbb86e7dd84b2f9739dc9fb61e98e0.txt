Lautertal is a municipality in the Vogelsbergkreis in Hesse, Germany.

Geography

Location
Lautertal lies from 400 to 700 m above sea level in the High Vogelsberg Nature Park (Naturpark Hoher Vogelsberg). Lautertal is famous for the spectacular natural monument Felsenmeer. It is the product of geological processes that began about 340 million years ago. At that time two continents drifted towards each other and collided in the area of today's Odenwald. At this "junction" a huge mountain range was formed. At great depth the rock melted and rose as liquid magma. About 330 million years ago it cooled in the "core" of the piled up mountains to a rock similar to granite, the melaquarz diorite.
