Humanitas () is an independent Romanian publishing house, located at Piața Presei Libere 1 (House of the Free Press), Bucharest. It was founded on February 1, 1990 (after the Romanian Revolution) by the philosopher Gabriel Liiceanu, based on a  state-owned publishing house, Editura Politică. Its slogan is Humanitas, bunul gust al libertății ("Humanitas, the good taste of freedom").

During its first years, Humanitas mainly published authors from the Romanian diaspora, whose works had been subject to censorship or banning in Communist Romania; they include Emil Cioran, Mircea Eliade, and Eugène Ionesco.

Currently, Humanitas publishes literature, books on philosophy, religion, social and political sciences, history, memoirs, popular science, children's literature, and self-help books.
