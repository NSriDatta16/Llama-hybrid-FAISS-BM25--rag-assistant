William A. Tiller (Toronto, Canada, September 18, 1929 – Scottsdale, Arizona, February 7, 2022) was a professor of materials science and engineering at Stanford University.
He wrote Science and Human Transformation, a book about concepts such as subtle energies beyond the four fundamental forces, which he believes act in concert with human consciousness. Tiller appeared in the 2004 film What the Bleep Do We Know!?.

Education and career 
Tiller gained his academic reputation for his scientific work in the field of crystallization. He studied at the University of Toronto and obtained his B.A.Sc. in 1952 with a degree in Engineering Physics. He also obtained M.A.Sc. and a Ph.D. degrees from the same university. Altogether, he worked nine years as an advisory physicist with the Westinghouse Research Laboratories and 34 years in academia. From 1964 to 1992 William A. Tiller was a professor in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Stanford University, and during this time he held the position of department chairman from 1966 to 1971. In 1970, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship grant in Natural Sciences – Engineering. In 1992 he became professor emeritus.
 Tiller was a Physics Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Pigasus Award 
In his 1982 book, James Randi identified Tiller as the 1979 "scientist who had said the silliest thing" relating to parapsychology in that year; for this Tiller was awarded the Pigasus Award for 1979.

Psychoenergetics 
After his retirement in 1998, he pursued esoteric concepts in psychoenergetics.

Selected publications
He has published several books, over 250 conventional scientific papers and further 100 topics on psychoenergetics.
