History
The Gressenhall Farm and Workhouse museum is located here, and a watermill dating from 1847.
The main buildings of the Gressenhall workhouse were built in 1777 when it was a house of industry. Here paupers would work under quite a strict regime in return for accommodation.

This changed after the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834: as a result the building underwent numerous changes to comply with the Act. The workhouse was a poor law institution. Its purpose was to provide a home and work for the poor local people who had nowhere to live. Gressenhall was constructed in 1776 and took one year to open.

Gressenhall has a post office, a pub (The Swan) and a church (St Mary's).
