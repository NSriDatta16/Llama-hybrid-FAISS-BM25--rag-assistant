Early life

She grew up in a family tradition dedicated to the occult sciences. During World War II she left with her family to live on the Wirral Peninsula in the northwest of England. She spent her spare time visiting the Roma who used to camp there. There, she learned  about the natural world, tarot cards and fortune telling. After the war, the family returned to Jersey and her parents formed a clandestine occult discussion group due to restrictions imposed by Jersey's law.

There it was where she became associated with Walter Ernest Butler, and with Gareth Knight and the Helios Course in Practical Qabalah which, in 1971, became the foundation of Servants of the Light. In 1976, when Butler retired, Ashcroft-Nowicki became the Director of Studies of the SOL, a position she handed on in June 2018 to Steven Critchley.
