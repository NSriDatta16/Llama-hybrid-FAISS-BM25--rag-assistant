Junior league
Unhappy with his limited play at the Latvian club team Vilki Rīga, Karsums elected to transfer to the Moncton Wildcats of the QMJHL. He enjoyed a very good rookie season for the Moncton Wildcats, finishing in the top five of both team and league rookie, scoring 53 points (30 goals, 23 assists), and accumulating 76 PIM. Karsums also dominated the 2004 World Junior Ice Hockey Championship Division I tournament, scoring seven goals and adding six assists for 13 points in five games.

During the 2005–06 season, which was his most successful season so far, Karsums scored 65 points (34 goals, 31 assists) and helped his Moncton Wildcats to win the Jean Rougeau Trophy and the President's Cup. He also received the Guy Lafleur Trophy as playoff most valuable player, scoring 27 points (16 goals, 11 assists) in 22 games and was the first European-born player to do so. Eight of his 16 post-season goals have proven game-winning goals, including three of the four game-winners in the championships series vs the Quebec Remparts.

He played in the 2006 Memorial Cup, scored one goal, and had three assists in five games.

On May 22, 2006, Karsums signed a three-year contract with Boston Bruins.

On January 14, 2010, after playing the first half of the season with affiliate, the Norfolk Admirals of the AHL, Karsums was reassigned by the Lightning to HC MVD of the Kontinental Hockey League. However, he didn't join the team and was instead loaned to Dinamo Riga.

After struggling in the first season, he became a major contributor and one of the scoring and on-ice leaders in his next three seasons with Dinamo Riga. He played at least 50 games in all three seasons finishing above 30 points. Mid-through 2012–13 season Karsums was named as captain of the team.

After four seasons with Dinamo Rīga, Karsums signed a contract with HC Dynamo Moscow.
