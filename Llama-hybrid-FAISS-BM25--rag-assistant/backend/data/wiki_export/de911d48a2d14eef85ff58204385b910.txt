In the United States, a Class II railroad, sometimes referred to as a regional railroad, is a railroad company that is not Class I, but still has a substantial amount of traffic or trackage (and is thus not a short line). The Association of American Railroads (AAR) has defined the lower bound as  of track or $40 million in annual operating revenue. (The Class I threshold is $250 million, adjusted for inflation since 1991.). , a Class II railroad in the United States has an operating revenue greater than $39.2 million but less than $489.9 million.
