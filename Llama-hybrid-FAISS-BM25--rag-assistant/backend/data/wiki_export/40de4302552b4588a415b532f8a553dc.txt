California's 23rd congressional district is a congressional district in the U.S. state of California. The district is represented in the 118th United States Congress by Jay Obernolte.

Following the 2020 United States redistricting cycle, the district is anchored in San Bernardino County, and also includes parts of Kern and Los Angeles counties. It is mostly within the Mojave Desert. Cities in the new 23rd district include Victorville, Hesperia, Adelanto, Apple Valley, Barstow, Twentynine Palms, Big Bear Lake, California City, Loma Linda, Yucaipa, southern Redlands, and small portions of Highland and San Bernardino.

History

From 2003 to 2013 the district ran along the Pacific coasts of Ventura, Santa Barbara, and San Luis Obispo counties. Major cities in the district included Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Ventura, and Oxnard.
Before redistricting by the California Citizens Redistricting Commission in 2011, California's 23rd congressional district was one of the narrowest districts in the United States, stretching along the Pacific coast from Oxnard to the Monterey County line. It was often referred to as "the district that disappears at high tide" or the "ribbon of shame". This area is now divided between the 24th and 26th districts, while the current 23rd covers much of the territory that was previously in the 22nd district.
