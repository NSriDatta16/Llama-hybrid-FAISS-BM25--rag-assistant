The Type 364 radar was developed by the Yangzhou Marine Electronic Instruments Research Institute (扬州船用电子仪器研究所) / No. 723 Research Institute. It is typically enclosed in a dome on new PLA-N's frigates and destroyers.

An improved version of the earlier Type 360, it replaces the Yagi IFF antenna with a planar IFF configuration and moves to higher frequencies in order to achieve better target discrimination. The dome is also expected to improve azimuth resolution. 

It is expected to be used primarily for CIWS (Type 730, Type 630, HQ-10) targeting with secondary air search and SSM targeting abilities.

It is offered for sale through the China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation (CSIC).
