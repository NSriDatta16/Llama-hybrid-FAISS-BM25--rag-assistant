Dragon Lee (born 1940) is an actor and practitioner of Taekwondo and Hapkido. He made a name for himself as a martial arts film star in the 1970s and 80s. His birth name is Moon Kyung-seok, but he has also been called Keo Ryong (literally "giant dragon") in South Korea.

According to his IMDb biography, Dragon Lee was born in what is now North Korea.

Lee eventually studied taekwondo with friend and actor Kim Tai-chung, who served as Bruce Lee's double in the final scenes of "Game of Death." It was at this stage of his life that Lee began studying also the Korean martial art of hapkido under Hwang In-shik, who appeared with Bruce Lee in Way of the Dragon.

When Dragon Lee was at a theater, a man told him that he resembled Bruce Lee. That was a big compliment because Bruce Lee was popular at the time, and the man knew film directors in Hong Kong and helped Dragon Lee advance his career.

In his early 20s, Dragon Lee moved to Hong Kong and starred in numerous martial arts films, often credited as Bruce Lei because he bore a striking resemblance to Bruce Lee. Among Dragon Lee's many film credits is the semi-documentary The Real Bruce Lee (1977).

Dragon Lee moved back to Seoul, and is a television actor and producer. He also heads a South Korean actors' association.
