Massachusetts is currently divided into 9 congressional districts, each represented by a member of the United States House of Representatives. After the 2010 census, the number of Massachusetts's seats was decreased from 10 to 9, due to the State's low growth in population since the year 2000. This mandatory redistricting after the 2010 census eliminated Massachusetts's 10th congressional district, and also caused a major shift in how the state's congressional districts are currently drawn.

Enumeration trends
After the 1890 census, and starting with the 53rd United States Congress in 1893, Massachusetts's congressional districts were numbered west to east, with the  in the west (Berkshire County) and the highest numbered district at Cape Cod. Before then, the district numeration was not as consistent; sometimes running east to west, other times going counter-clockwise around Boston.
