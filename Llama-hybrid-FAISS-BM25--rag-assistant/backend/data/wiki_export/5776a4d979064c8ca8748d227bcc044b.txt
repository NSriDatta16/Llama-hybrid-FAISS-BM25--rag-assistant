Programming 
The phone can be programmed over the air with one step by calling Verizon's programming service at *228, and then by calling any number. Same Code Also works when activating an Alltel branded E815 to activate to Alltel's Network.

Criticism 
Unlike the V710, which inherently had no Bluetooth OBEX profile, the E815 includes OBEX compatibility. However, this feature was disabled by Verizon, as were (like the v710) the options to copy and move files between the TransFlash memory card and the phone's internal memory. However, several enthusiast groups dedicated to hacking Motorola phones exist, and despite Verizon's attempts to limit the phone's native features, several tutorials have surfaced providing detailed instructions on how to re-enable crippled features.

One of the most criticised restrictions imposed on the Verizon version of the E815 is the obscurity and deliberate lack of any documented explanation of how to upload one's own custom ringtones to the handset. Verizon Wireless has stated the reason for the restriction on uploads is a precaution against a subscriber uploading malware to their phone. A more cynical view might be that Verizon wishes subscribers to purchase ringtones from their "Get It Now" service. Owners of the E815 have found that it is possible to upload ringtones using Verizon's VZWPIX website. For those who do not have an unlimited picture messaging plan, there is a small fee for the upload, but it's considerably less than purchasing a ringtone. Phone owners have also found a way to put ringtones on the phone using a transflash card.

Another restriction applied to this phone (by all carriers) is the inability to use QNC data, which was still (and may still be) the only data service available in some areas of the country and this is usually not brought up when people purchase this handset. Bell Mobility (Canada) has also been known to disable EV-DO functionality of the phone on their network, and there is currently no way to circumvent this block. EV-DO data does work if the phone is activated on another carrier such as Verizon or Alltel.

The E815 as well as the E816 variant used on the ill-fated Amp'd Mobile network both suffered from flawed internal battery charger software causing difficulties in charging the phone's battery. As a result, users had to resort to external battery chargers in order to continue to use the phone due to the internal charger's growing inability to function over time.
