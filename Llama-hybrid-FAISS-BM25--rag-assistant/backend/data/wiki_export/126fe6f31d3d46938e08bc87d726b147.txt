Stadium station is a St. Louis MetroLink station. This station serves Busch Stadium, home of the St. Louis Cardinals, Cupples Station, and Ballpark Village in Downtown St. Louis, Missouri.

The Stadium station sits at the west portal of the historic St. Louis Freight Tunnel. Constructed in 1874 to carry trains between the Eads Bridge and the Mill Creek Valley rail yards, it saw its last train (Amtrak) in 1974. Refurbishment of the tunnels began in 1991 in preparation for the opening of MetroLink, which uses the original route to connect Illinois and Missouri via downtown St. Louis.

Station layout 
Both platforms are connected to Clark Avenue with accessible ramps or stairs. There are also stairs connecting the platforms to Spruce Street.

Public artwork 
In 2013, Metro's Arts in Transit program commissioned the work Out of the Park by Andrews/LeFevre Studios for this station. The anodized aluminum sculpture is a dynamic abstraction of a baseball being hit “out of the park” and echoes the shape and proportions of the Gateway Arch.
