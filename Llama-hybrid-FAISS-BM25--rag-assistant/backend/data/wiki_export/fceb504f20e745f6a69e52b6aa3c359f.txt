Gameplay

Racer Revenge is a high-speed racing game utilizing podracers, multi-engine chariot-like craft driven by a single pilot. The story takes place eight years after the events of Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace. Famous racer Sebulba seeks revenge on Anakin Skywalker, who eight years prior defeated him on the Boonta Eve Classic.

Players can select one of many characters of varying species, each with their own unique podracer. Attributes for each podracer vary, and include things such as acceleration, top speed, and durability. Races are held throughout the Star Wars universe on many different planets. The player can choose from three different modes to compete with their character.  Revenge also departs from its predecessor by employing a form of permadeath by preventing podracers from respawning, meaning that any podracers destroyed in a race are thus eliminated for the rest of the race.

Single Play allows the player race in one of three ways: Single Event, Practice, or Time Trial. Single Event lets the player race on any unlocked track. They can choose between 1 and 25 laps. Practice lets the player determine how many pods they go up against (from 1 to 8), and Time Trial is just the player against the clock for the best lap time. Tournaments feature races across 13 tracks. The player character must attempt to finish first while destroying as many rival pods as possible. Each race has a total prize for getting first, as well as Watto’s Bribes, which multiplies winnings by a percent, depending on how many pods were destroyed. Each race has a par number of kills, usually 2 or 3, which must be completed in order to completely max out the player's pod's stats. Lastly, two placers can compete in a Vs. Race on any unlocked track with any of the unlocked characters.
