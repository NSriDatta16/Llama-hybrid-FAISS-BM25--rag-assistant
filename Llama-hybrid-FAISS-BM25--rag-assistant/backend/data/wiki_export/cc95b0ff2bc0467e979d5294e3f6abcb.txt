The Central Control Commission (, Tsentral'naya Kontrol'naya Komissiya) was a supreme disciplinary body (since 1934 within the Central Committee) of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Its members were elected at plenary sessions of the Central Committee.

History and function 
At first there was a single Control Commission, which in 1921 was divided into the Central Auditing Commission, responsible for financial control, and the Central Control Commission, responsible for controlling party discipline. The Party Control Committee oversaw the party discipline of the Party members and candidate Party members in terms of their observance of the programme and regulations of the Party, state discipline and Party ethics. It administered punishments, including expulsions from the Party. The Party Control Committee also considered the appeals of Party members punished by their local Party organizations.

According to the Charter, the composition of the Central Control Commission was elected by the Party Congress; members of the Central Control Commission could not be simultaneously members of the Central Committee. The local control bodies of the RCP (b) were regional control commissions, district control commissions, city control commissions, etc.

The activities of the party control bodies largely helped not only to reduce the number of violators of party and ethical norms in the party, but also to somewhat improve the poor quality of the management system. An important element of party control was the lack of public control over the Soviet political system from below.
