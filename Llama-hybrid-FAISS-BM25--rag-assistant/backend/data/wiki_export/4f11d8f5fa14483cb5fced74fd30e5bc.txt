During the 1997 United States Basketball League season, the ownership group, Sports Management Professionals, (SMP) lead by Richard J. Donovan and James I. Williamson, assumed ownership of the Tampa Bay Windjammers. In response to this effort by SMP, the United States Basketball League awarded a franchise for the 1998 season to SMP. That franchise would become known as the Columbus Cagerz. The team would play for one year in Columbus, Ohio. Following that inaugural season, the franchise was moved to Salina, Kansas. The Kansas Cagerz were a United States Basketball League team based in Salina, Kansas beginning in 1999. SMP would manage the Kansas Cagerz franchise for two years (1999 and 2000) in Kansas. The last head coach was Francis Flax. The Kansas Cagerz won the USBL Championship in 2007 after defeating the Brooklyn Kings 95â€“92 in Enid, Oklahoma. The USBL's last season was in 2007.
