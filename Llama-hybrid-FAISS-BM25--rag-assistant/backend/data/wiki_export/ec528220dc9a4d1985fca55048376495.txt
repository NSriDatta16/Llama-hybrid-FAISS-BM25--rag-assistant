History
Mineral water of Mlječanica was first described by Austrian chemist  in 1888, but remained in use only by local residents. In the 1970s, more thorough hydro-geological studies were conducted, as well as a detailed physical and chemical analysis of the water. Construction of the spa began in the early 1980s, including a stationary with 105 beds, restaurant and accompanying facilities. The spa officially opened on 4 July 1987.

Patients come to Mlječanica for treatment of brain strokes and hemiplegia; rheumatic diseases (inflammation and degenerative, knuckle or out-knuckle rheumatism); gastrointestinal diseases; gynecological diseases, and post-traumatic and post-surgery conditions.

The natural mineral water is classified as a magnesium-calcium-sodium-sulfide water. The temperature at the source is 15 °C. The same water is used for treatment.
