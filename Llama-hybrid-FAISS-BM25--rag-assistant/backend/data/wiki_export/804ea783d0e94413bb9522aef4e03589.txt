The Ofin River is an easterly-flowing waterway in Ghana. It flows through the Tano Ofin Reserve in Ghana's Atwima Mponua District.

The Ofin and the Pra rivers form the boundary between Ghana's Ashanti region and Central region. Dunkwa-on-Offin is a major town on the river.

Gold is mined from the river's sediment.
