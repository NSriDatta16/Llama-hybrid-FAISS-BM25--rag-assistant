History

The school was founded as the Baptist Bible Seminary in 1932 in Johnson City, New York.

For its first 36 years, the college used the facilities of First Baptist Church in Johnson City. Additional buildings were purchased or built to accommodate the growing student body.

Steady growth of enrollment by the 1960s prompted school leaders to search for a new location. In 1968, a site in Clarks Summit was found with the help of Gov. William Scranton.

The school received its accreditation from the Association for Biblical Higher Education in 1968 and received approval to grant degrees from the Pennsylvania Department of Education in 1969. These developments, along with the offering of associates of arts degrees, led the school to change its name again in 1971, becoming the Baptist Bible College of Pennsylvania.

The separate Baptist Bible Seminary was spun off in 1972, taking on the original name of the college from its foundation in 1934. Graduate studies began in 1989.
 
The name was changed to the current Clarks Summit University in 2016.
