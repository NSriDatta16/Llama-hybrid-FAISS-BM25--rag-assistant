Raritan was acquired by Legrand in September 2015.

History 
Raritan was established in 1985, when the founder, Ching-I Hsu, and his wife, created a business reselling PC components out of their house. This later changed from reselling to manufacturing PCs. To make the manufacturing more efficient, Hsu developed the first KVM switch, a tool that provides a way to control numerous PCs from a single product. The KVM switch advanced Raritan as an international company and led to other company advancements.

Raritan entered the intelligent power business in 2007. Intelligent power management provides companies with an accurate measurement of the amount of energy devices use. This kind of power management is much more energy efficient because it consumes less energy/produces less heat, improves environmental conditions with sensors that adjust things like temperature and humidity levels, and overall decrease costs.

In 2008, Raritan's Data Center Infrastructure Management (DCIM) business began. This software provides the ability to better manage assets, change and capacity through monitoring of power, the environment, and energy use.

In June 2015, Legrand, North America announced an agreement to acquire Raritan. The scope of the acquisition would include Raritan's intelligent power and KVM businesses, while its Data Center Infrastructure Management (DCIM) software business would spin off into Sunbird Software, a new company and strategic partner of Raritan to be chaired by Ching-I Hsu, CEO and founder of Raritan. The acquisition was complete on September 28, 2015.
