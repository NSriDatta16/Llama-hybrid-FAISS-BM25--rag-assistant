The ships had two Parsons geared steam turbines,, each driving one shaft, using steam provided by two Admiralty three-drum boilers. The engines produced a total of  and gave a maximum speed of . They carried a maximum of  of fuel oil that gave them a range of  at .

The Algerine class was armed with a QF  Mk V anti-aircraft gun and four twin-gun mounts for Oerlikon 20 mm cannon. The latter guns were in short supply when the first ships were being completed and they often got a proportion of single mounts. By 1944, single-barrel Bofors 40 mm mounts began replacing the twin 20Â mm mounts on a one for one basis. All of the ships were fitted for four throwers and two rails for depth charges.

Construction
The ship was launched from the Harland and Wolff yard in Belfast on 25 November 1943 and  commissioned on 11 February 1944.

History

World War II
From June to August 1944 Rifleman was engaged in minesweeping and escort duties for Operation Neptune, the Allied invasion of Normandy.  In September she was nominated for Air Sea Rescue duties during the Arnhem airborne assault, and in October she carried out mine clearance operations in the Scheldt estuary and escorted a military convoy to Antwerp.

She was transferred to the South West Approaches with the rest of her Flotilla and was employed in anti-submarine patrols out of Falmouth until December, when she was refitted for service in the Far East.

In February 1945 Rifleman rejoined her Flotilla and together they formed the escort for a convoy of Landing Ships (Tank) from Falmouth to Gibraltar.  On 22 February she rescued some of the 41 survivors from the  which had been attacked by sister ship . Rifleman arrived at Colombo on 14 April and on 1 May she began minesweeping the approaches to Rangoon for the assault ships.  In June she was at Trincomalee to prepare for planned minesweeping off Phuket Island and during July she and her sisters came under sustained air attack, with  and  being sunk. This operation was named Livery.

At the end of August Rifleman carried out minesweeping operations to clear the approaches to Penang for the entry of the battleship , and the cruisers  and . In September, the minesweeper performed the same task in the Malacca Straits prior to the entry into Singapore.

In 1953 the vessel took part in the Fleet Review to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. At the end of 1954 she returned to the UK and was again reduced to Reserve and laid up. During 1958 and 1959 she was refitted. In 1970 the ship was sent to Barrow and used to provide accommodation, including for personnel standing by submarines under construction by Vickers-Armstrong.
