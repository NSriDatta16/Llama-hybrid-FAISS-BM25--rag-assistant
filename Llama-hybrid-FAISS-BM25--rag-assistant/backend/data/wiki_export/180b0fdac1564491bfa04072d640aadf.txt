The Moderate Labour Party was a minor political party in the United Kingdom.  It was founded in about 1985 by former members of the Labour Party who were opposed to the miners' strike.

It was particularly active in Nottinghamshire. It fielded 26 candidates in local elections, including five sitting councillors, none of whom won their seats. They fielded two candidates in the 1987 general election against left-wing Labour candidates, with its chairman, Brian Marshall, standing in Mansfield against Alan Meale. Another candidate, Allan Harrison, stood in Batley and Spen. Benefiting from the endorsement of retiring Labour MP Don Concannon, Marshall won 1,580 votes in Mansfield. The Conservative Party nearly took the seat, but Meale held it for the main Labour Party with a majority of only 56 votes versus Concannon's 2,216-vote majority from 1983.

The party again stood in the European Parliament election, 1994, winning 12,113 votes but not coming close to winning a seat.
