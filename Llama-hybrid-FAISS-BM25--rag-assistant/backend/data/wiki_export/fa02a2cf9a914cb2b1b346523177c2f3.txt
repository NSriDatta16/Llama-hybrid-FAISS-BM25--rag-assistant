Inshes (, , ) is a small residential area in the east of Inverness, Scotland. Inverness is the capital of the Highlands and is one of the fastest-growing cities in Europe. Some parts of Inshes were built a few decades ago, but most of it was built after 2003. A few houses are still being constructed and not yet finished. The houses are made by Barrat and Tulloch Homes, which are quite popular and expensive in Britain. A majority of the houses are semi-detached but some are detached. There are also a few flats in Inshes.
