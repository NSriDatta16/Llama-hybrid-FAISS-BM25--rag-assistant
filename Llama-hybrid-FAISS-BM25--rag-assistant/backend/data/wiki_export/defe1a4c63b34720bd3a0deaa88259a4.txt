Knitting abbreviations are often used for brevity in describing knitting patterns.

Each knitting pattern typically provides its own abbreviations or refers to a standard. There is no single authoritative source for knitting abbreviations, so multiple standards exist.

Types of knitting abbreviations
Knitting abbreviations can be grouped by what they describe:

 side of work
RS and WS signify the "right side" and "wrong side" of the work.

 type of stitch
k means a knit stitch (passing through the previous loop from below) and p means a  purl stitch (passing through the previous loop from above).  Thus, "k2, p2", means "knit two stitches, purl two stitches". Similarly, sl st describes a slip stitch, whereas yarn-overs are denoted with yo.

 scope of stitch
The modifier tog indicates that the stitches should be knitted together, e.g., "k2tog" indicates that two stitches should be knitted together as though they were one stitch.  psso means "pass the slipped stitch over".  pnso means "pass the next stitch over".

 orientation of stitch
The modifier tbl indicates that stitches should be knitted through the back loop.  For example, "p2tog tbl" indicates that two stitches should be purled together through the back loop.  kwise and pwise connote "knitwise" and "purlwise", usually referring to a slip stitch.

 insertion point of stitch
k-b and k1b mean "knit into the row below".  Similarly, p-b and p1b mean "purl into the row below".
p tbl; P1 tbl; or P1b: Purl through the back loop.

 short combinations of stitches
MB means "make bobble".  ssk means "slip, slip, knit", i.e., the decrease "slip two stitches knitwise individually, then knit them together through the back loop".  skp is another decrease, meaning "slip, knit, pass the slipped stitch over the just knitted stitch".  (Both of these decreases are similar to the simpler "k2tog tbl", however this does result in both stitches being twisted to the left).

 repetition of stitches
Patterns of stitches that should be repeated for as many stitches as possible are enclosed in asterisks *...*.  For example, "*k2,p2*" means "repeatedly knit two stitches, purl two stitches as long as possible, i.e., until there are fewer than four stitches left in the row".  alt stands for "alternately".

 position of yarn
 wyib and wyif mean "with yarn in back" and "with yarn in front", respectively.  Used primarily with slipped stitches.

 beginnings and endings
CO and BO mean "cast on" and "bind off", respectively.

 overall pattern
St st, rev St st and g st signify "stockinette stitch", "reverse stockinette stitch" and " garter stitch", respectively.

 cable instructions
LT and RT signify "left twist" and "right twist", respectively. FC and LC indicate "front cross" or "left cross" (the same thing), whereas BC and RC indicate "back cross" or "right cross" (again the same thing).

 color changes
 MC means "main color"; CC means "contrasting color".

 decreases
k2tog indicates two stitches should be knitted together as one, used for making decreases in a row.

 increases
m1 means "make one stitch".  kfb or pfb means "knit or purl into the front and back of a stitch".

 positional abbreviations
rem means "remaining".  foll means "following".  beg means "beginning".  cont means "continue".  incl means "including".
