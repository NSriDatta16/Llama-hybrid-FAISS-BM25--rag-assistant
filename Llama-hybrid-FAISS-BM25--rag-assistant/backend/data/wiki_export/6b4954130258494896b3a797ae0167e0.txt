"Leningrad" is a 1989 song written and performed by American singer and songwriter Billy Joel. The song was originally released on his album Storm Front on the Columbia Records label, and went on to be released as a single in Europe only. It was also released on his Greatest Hits, Vol. 3 compilation. The song title is derived from the contemporary name of St. Petersburg, Russia.

Synopsis
The song was written by Joel about a Russian clown named Viktor Razinov, whom he met while touring the Soviet Union in 1987. Throughout the song, major items of Viktor's and Billy's lives are compared to show the cultural differences and similarities of the United States and the Soviet Union.

In the song, Billy describes Viktor's life as one of many Soviet children who lost fathers during World WarÂ II, specifically during the siege of Leningrad. He enlisted in the Red Army, drank vodka to fight the pain, and then became a circus clown, bringing joy to Russian children.

Billy described his childhood life as being "born in '49, a Cold War kid in McCarthy time". He briefly describes his life living in Levittown, and the fear of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Billy also makes a reference to the Korean War, a proxy war to the Cold War, as well as the Vietnam War.

In the end, the two meet after Billy's Leningrad concert (Viktor had journeyed across Russia to see all six of the Russian concerts), where Viktor draws a laugh from Billy's daughter Alexa. Billy and Viktor embrace afterwards. In the song's last line, Billy sings: "We never knew what friends we had, until we came to Leningrad."

The quote is printed on the single cover, but not on the cover of the 4-track CD, which instead features the titles of the extra songs: "Goodnight Saigon", "Vienna", and "Scandinavian Skies".

In 2015, Razinov traveled to New York to see Billy Joel's concert in Madison Square Garden. For this reunion, Joel played "Leningrad", which he rarely plays live.

The backup vocals for this song were sung by members of the Hicksville High School Choir. It was a group of students selected by Hicksville High School choir director, Charles "Chuck" Arnold, who wrote the harmonies. Mr. Arnold was retiring in 1989 and had remained in touch with Billy Joel, since Billy had gone to high school in Hicksville before quitting to start his music career. He offered this opportunity to Mr. Arnold's students as a tribute to him and his influence on Billy in his early years. Mr. Arnold was later singled out at a sold out Denver CO show on Thursday, Aug. 8, 2019.
