Point Grey stəywəte:n̓ Secondary School, previously called Point Grey Secondary School, is a public secondary school located in the Kerrisdale and Shaughnessy neighbourhoods of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

History
Designed by Fred Townley and Matheson, the main building was built in 1929 in a Collegiate Gothic style. Construction of the school was commissioned by the Municipality of Point Grey prior to amalgamation with the City of Vancouver. Point Grey Secondary was built originally as a junior high school. The first students began classes in September 1929 and the building served as a junior high school until 1965 when it became a full secondary school. In 1965, a new wing was added with a gym, laboratories and a library. In 2006, Point Grey, in conjunction with the Parks Board, completed a new artificial turf field, and have upgraded the track surrounding it to a rubber surface.
Point Grey also offers Advanced Placement courses in Biology, Calculus, Chemistry, Computer Science, English, Physics, and Psychology.

In 1962 Point Grey was designated a comprehensive secondary school from grade 8 to 12, as it is today. Although the school offered a full range of courses, its focus was essentially academic. Today eighty-five per cent of Point Grey's grade 12's continue on with post-secondary education.
