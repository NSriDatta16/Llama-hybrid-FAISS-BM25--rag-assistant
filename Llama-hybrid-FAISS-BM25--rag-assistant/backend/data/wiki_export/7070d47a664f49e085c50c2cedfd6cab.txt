Dog Chow refers to the name brand of dog food marketed and manufactured by Nestlé Purina PetCare. Dog Chow was first introduced in 1926, and has since expanded its brand offerings to include a wider selection products for dogs with addition of food for puppies, elderly dogs, and dogs needing a weight maintenance formula as well as offering other types of pet food, including Puppy Chow, Cat Chow, and Kitten Chow.

Due to the brand's growing popularity, a string of commercials were aired in Canada in 1962. The commercials introduced Jim Henson's brainchild, Rowlf the Dog.
