"Manhattan Serenade" was composed by Louis Alter in 1928, with lyrics by Howard Johnson. Alternate lyrics were written ca. 1942 by Harold Adamson. It was a hit record for swing era bandleaders Harry James (vocals by Helen Forrest) and Tommy Dorsey (vocals by Jo Stafford).

Films
The song may be most familiar as the title theme of My Man Godfrey (1936), and as the music orchestrating Corleone family consigliere Tom Hagen's flight to Los Angeles in the 1972 classic The Godfather. Scott Bradley based his score for Mouse in Manhattan, a Tom and Jerry cartoon released in 1945, on this composition. Manhattan Serenade was also featured in Vertigo, the scene in which John 'Scottie' Ferguson is dancing with Judy; and it was featured in the 1940 musical Broadway Rhythm to back a routine by the dancers/contortionists The Ross Sisters.

Radio
"Manhattan Serenade" was used as the theme for the 1930-1945 radio comedy Easy Aces in a transcription performed by an in-studio theatre organist. Later, it was transcribed for a quartet of organ, celeste, and two stringed instruments. A fully-orchestrated arrangement of the Serenade was used in the short-lived Easy Aces remake Mr. Ace and Jane.
