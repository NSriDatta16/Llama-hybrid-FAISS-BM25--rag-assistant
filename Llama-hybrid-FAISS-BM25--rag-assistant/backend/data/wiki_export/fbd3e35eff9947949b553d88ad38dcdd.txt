She has taught constitutional law (with special emphasis on First Amendment issues), intellectual property (trademark, copyright), real property, and torts. She was the first woman to become a full professor at the Law School. In May 2010, BeVier retired after 40 years as a law professor, 37 of which were spent at the University of Virginia.

Failed nomination to the Fourth Circuit 

On October 22, 1991, President George Herbert Walker Bush nominated BeVier to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.  However, her nomination was never processed by the Democrat-controlled U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, and was returned to Bush at the end of his presidency.

Possible nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court 

BeVier was mentioned as a potential replacement for Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. President George W. Bush ultimately selected Samuel Alito.
