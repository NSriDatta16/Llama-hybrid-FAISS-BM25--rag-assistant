CFCR-FM, is the community radio station in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan which broadcasts at 90.5 FM. The station also streams live from their web site and airs on SaskTel Max, channel 820. CFCR-FM is a member of the National Campus and Community Radio Association (NCRA).

History
When the University of Saskatchewan's campus radio station CHSK-FM (formerly CJUS) signed off the air in September 1985, a small group of concerned individuals decided to form a community radio station in Saskatoon.

Following the incorporation of the Community Radio Society of Saskatoon (CRSS) the following year, the founding members set out to convince the city that a non-profit community-run station was a feasible concept.

After attracting an impressive number of members, many of whom were former CJUS/CHSK on-air hosts, work was begun in earnest on creating a program schedule, training volunteers and arranging fundraising events.

It was at this time that a "White Knight" appeared in the form of Saskatoon Telecable, who offered the CRSS the opportunity to immediately begin broadcasting out of the Telecable studios on cable FM and the audio portion of channel 10, at no charge. This arrangement allowed the fledgling radio station to fine-tune its program schedule and provide on-air training to volunteers while preparing its license application with the CRTC. The CRSS then moved to its new home in the lower level of 103 3rd Avenue North in downtown Saskatoon. In 1991, the CRTC granted CFCR its first license to broadcast. On July 14, 1991 at about 5pm, CFCR made its first test broadcast. The first album spun was A Proud Canadian by Stompin' Tom Connors, followed shortly by the first complaint that there was too much Stompin' Tom Connors being played. September 7, 1991 at 3:19pm marked the official sign-on of CFCR as a full-powered FM radio station, broadcasting at 90.5FM. The first official program to air was Sounds of Scotland.

On March 22, 2006, CFCR increased its output power to 1630 watts, greatly improving the signal and coverage for Saskatoon's outer-lying areas.

In 2007, CFCR moved to its present location on the 3rd Floor of the beautiful heritage building at 267, 3rd Avenue South.  Then in 2008, CFCR began broadcasting their live content online.

Today, CFCR boasts a membership of over 500, with approximately one-fifth of the members volunteering as on-air hosts. Programming continues to include an eclectic mix of non-commercial music of all genres, 100% locally produced spoken word shows like "Collective Voice" produced by grade 9 students at Aden Bowman, multicultural programs and specialty programming such as the "Fringe Fest Flyer," "Around The World in 800 Watts" (Folkfest coverage), and the Shakespeare on the Saskatchewan "Bardcast." CFCR often records live music performances on their interviews show The Buzz, and posts them to their website.
