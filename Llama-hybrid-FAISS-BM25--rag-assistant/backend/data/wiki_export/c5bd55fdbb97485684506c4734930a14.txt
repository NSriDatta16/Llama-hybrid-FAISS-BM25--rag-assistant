RedeTV! () is a Brazilian television network owned by Amilcare Dallevo and Marcelo de Carvalho. It is the newest television network, among the five major networks in Brazil, being a relaunch of Rede Manchete in 1999.

RedeTV! has modern production plants, located in São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte, Recife and Fortaleza. RedeTV! is headquartered in the CTD - Centro de Televisão Digital (Digital Television Center, in English), located in Osasco, a suburb of São Paulo, where its news division is based. It was the first network worldwide to be broadcast in 3D.

With a market share of 0.7 points in 2018, it has the smallest market share out of the top five Brazilian TV networks.

History
On May 8, 1999, two days before Rede Manchete ceased operations, its license was sold to TeleTV Group. RedeTV! would begin test broadcasts later that month as TV!, and temporarily aired several of Rede Manchete's programs and a modified version of its daily newscast. On November 12, 1999, the network's test broadcasts were replaced with a countdown clock to its official launch. RedeTV! officially commenced broadcasting at 7:00 am on November 15, 1999.

RedeTV!'s principal shows are Encrenca, the program of greater audience of the transmitter, A Tarde é Sua, an afternoon variety show hosted by Sônia Abrão, Superpop, an entertainment program and TV Fama, a program about celebrities. It was responsible for the Brazilian version of Desperate Housewives, Donas de Casa Desesperadas, series exhibited in 2007. The TV programming is directed mostly to the entertainment, with comedy, talk shows, soap operas, audience shows, journalism, sports, TV series and feminine showbiz.

RedeTV! was the first Brazilian network to produce all of its original programming in high definition.

In September 2009, RedeTV! changed its facilities Barueri for the Centro de Televisão Digital (CTD) in Osasco (São Paulo). Despite having changed its headquarters to the Centro de Televisão Digital (CTD) in September, the official inauguration of the center was on the 13th of November, being celebrated with a big party and with the participation of politicians, businessmen and artists such as Luciana Gimenez, Iris Stefanelli and Supla, in addition to President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.

In May 2010, Pânico na TV became the first show in the world to do a live 3D transmission in a free-to-pay channel.

In 2011, when the TeleTV Group was closed, the management and ownership of RedeTV! was transferred to Amilcare Dallevo Jr. and Marcelo de Carvalho, which is now owned by their own groups.
