Keansburg High School is a four-year comprehensive community public high school serving students in ninth through twelfth grades from Keansburg, in Monmouth County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, operating as the lone secondary school of the Keansburg School District. The school is a candidate for accreditation by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Elementary and Secondary Schools.

As of the 2021–22 school year, the school had an enrollment of 382 students and 32.9 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 11.6:1. There were 154 students (40.3% of enrollment) eligible for free lunch and 12 (3.1% of students) eligible for reduced-cost lunch.

KHS is located at 140 Port Monmouth Road. However, the school itself cannot be seen from Port Monmouth Road. The school is accessed via Titan Trail (the entrance road) into the parking lot. It is adjacent to Port Monmouth Road Elementary School (which should not be confused with Port Monmouth Elementary School in Port Monmouth), which was built well after the high school. One part of Port Monmouth Road Elementary School, once referred to as the "C-Wing," is slated to be returned for use for the high school following reconstruction. The reconstruction plans also plan to change the existing structure of the school district.

History
Prior to the opening of the high school, students from Keansburg had attended Middletown High School, with the Middletown district seeing a drop of more than 400 Keansburg students based on the high school's opening. The building was constructed at a cost of $2 million (equivalent to $ million in ) opened in September 1968. After the new school opened, the Middletown Township Public School District agreed that those Keansburg students who had previously been attending Middletown High School would be allowed to complete their education there on a tuition basis.
