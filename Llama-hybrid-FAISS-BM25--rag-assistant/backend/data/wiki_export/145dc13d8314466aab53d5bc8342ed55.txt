History
GatesAir traces its origins to 1922 when the Gates Radio Company was founded by Parker Gates, with the help of his parents, in Quincy, Illinois. The company was sold in 1957 to Harris Intertype Corporation (now Harris Corporation). The Gates brand was initially retained. In celebrating Gates' 50th anniversary in 1972, it was announced that the company was expanding to add television broadcast equipment with the acquisition of General Electric's TV equipment line that year. The company's name was changed to Harris in 1975. Harris Corporation sold its broadcast equipment operations to the Gores Group in 2012 with the sale completed in 2013.

In March 2014, Harris Broadcast was split into two companies,  (the Internet software and networking company) and GatesAir (the broadcast equipment company). The GatesAir name restores the company's historic name.

In 2016, GatesAir played a crucial role in the deployment of the world's first ATSC 3.0 digital TV broadcasts in South Korea, marking a significant milestone in the transition to Next-Gen TV that are used for showing latest news,vedio etc on the web.

In February 2017, GatesAir sold its radio studio consoles, studio networking, and studio furniture business (collectively known by its brand "Pacific Research & Engineering" or "PR&E") to Wheatstone Corporation. Harris Corporation had acquired PR&E in 1999 and incorporated it into its Broadcast Division.

In May 2019, GatesAir announced its acquisition of ONEtastic, a television transmitter manufacturer based in Brescia, Italy. Using the same staff and facilities, the entity continues operations as GatesAir S.r.l., adding its products to GatesAir's portfolio of offerings.

In April 2022, Thomson Broadcast announced the acquisition of GatesAir. The acquisition was completed in August 2022.
