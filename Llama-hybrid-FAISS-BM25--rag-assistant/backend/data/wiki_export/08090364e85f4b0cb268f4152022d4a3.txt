The Bernam River () is located between the Malaysian states of Perak and Selangor, demarcating the border of the two states. The Bernam River flows from Mount Liang Timur (Mount Liang East) in the east on the Titiwangsa Mountains to the Straits of Malacca in the west. The peak of Mount Liang Timur itself marks the tripoint where Pahang, Perak and Selangor meet.

The eastern part of the river is suitable for palm oil and rubber tree plantation, while swamps fill the western areas. A percentage of the swampy areas have been reclaimed and dried up by a drainage system. Some has been converted into paddy fields.

Archeologists have discovered several archaeological sites along the river, where ancient artifacts were found. Excavation works had been carried out by experts from various local universities and Muzium Sultan Alam Shah.
