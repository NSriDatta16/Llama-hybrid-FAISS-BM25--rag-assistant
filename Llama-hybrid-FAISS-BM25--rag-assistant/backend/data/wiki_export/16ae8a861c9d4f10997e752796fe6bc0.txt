Career
As a child, Núñez was with Humberto Nelson in his city of birth, then he joined Santiago Wanderers youth system.

Tigres had just been privatized after a crisis that ended with the team's relegation to Primera División A. In 1998, he played on loan at Universidad Católica.  

His incredible number of goals in Tigres quickly made him a team hero. He was instrumental in returning Tigres to the First Division.

He played many Clásico Regiomontano matches, against Tigres arch-rival Rayados de Monterrey. He became the maximum scorer in the history of Tigres for matches of this kind, with eight goals. His record was tied by Walter Gaitán in January 2007.

An injury separated him from the fields, and Tigres consequently separated him from the team in 2001. In 2002, he moved to play with Puebla F.C., a team that has been relegated to Primera División A.

He used to wear the number 16 on his back for every match he played.
