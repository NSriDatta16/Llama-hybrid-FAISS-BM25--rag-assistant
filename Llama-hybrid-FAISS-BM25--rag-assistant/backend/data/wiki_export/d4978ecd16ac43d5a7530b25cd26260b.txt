Ivan Gladstone "Mike" Mitchell (July 9, 1893 — May 8, 1942) was a Canadian professional ice hockey goaltender who played three seasons in the National Hockey League for the Toronto St. Patricks. Prior to playing in the NHL Mitchell played the 1914–15 season with the Portland Rosebuds of the PCHA. In 1922, Mitchell was injured during the second game of the season and missed the rest of the season. He is still credited with winning the Stanley Cup that season.

Military duty
Between 1915 and 1919 Mitchell was on military duty, fighting with the Canadian forces in World War 1. A notice in the Vancouver Daily World on November 19, 1917, claimed Mitchell had succumbed to his wounds in a London hospital, but the information turned out to be inaccurate as he was still alive.

Mitchell died on May 8, 1942, in his hometown of Winnipeg.
