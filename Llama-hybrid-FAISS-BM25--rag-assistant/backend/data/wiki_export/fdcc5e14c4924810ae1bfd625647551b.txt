Gadmen is a small village and a former municipality in the Interlaken-Oberhasli administrative district in the canton of Bern in Switzerland.

On 1 January 2014, the former municipality of Gadmen merged into the municipality of Innertkirchen.

The name Gadmen comes from the Old High German "gadum," meaning barn or small house, and was first mentioned in 1382.

The municipality is in a municipal partnership with Volketswil in the Canton of Zürich.

History

Gadmen is first mentioned in 1382 as im Gadmen.

During the Middle Ages, the Gadmen area was part of the Vogtei of Hasli and part of the Meiringen parish.  In 1334 the entire Vogtei was acquired by Bern.  During the Middle Ages a chapel was built in the village.  In 1713 Gadmen became part of the parish of Innertkirchen and in 1722 the chapel expanded into a filial church.  In 1816 the church became a parish church and Gadmen became an independent parish.

The residents of the village generally lived on farming, seasonal alpine herding and from traffic over the Susten Pass.  During the 19th century, the farms became increasingly mechanized and many residents were forced to emigrate to North America for jobs.  The construction of the Susten Road in 1939-45 opened up the village to tourism and provided additional jobs.  During construction and after its completion, the Oberhasli AG power plant became the largest employer in the municipality.
