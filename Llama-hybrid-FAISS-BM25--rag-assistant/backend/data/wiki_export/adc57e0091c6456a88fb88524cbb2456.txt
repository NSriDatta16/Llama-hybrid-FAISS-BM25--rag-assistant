Atikaki Provincial Park is north of Nopiming Provincial Park and borders the Woodland Caribou Provincial Park in Ontario.

Geography
Most of the water of the park flows west to Lake Winnipeg. Although the vast majority of the park's land is located east of 95Â° 46' W, there are three very long thin corridors of parkland along streams that flow westward toward Lake Winnipeg. These streams are the Pigeon River, the Leyond River, and the Bloodvein River. The lakes and rivers are warmer than most rivers that are fed by cold mountain streams.  The majority of the population north and east of the park are First Nations and the closest town is Bloodvein at the mouth of the Bloodvein River.

Atikaki is home to wildlife such as moose, elk, black bears, loons, bald eagles, woodland caribou, and other creatures of the boreal forest. It is known mostly for its beautiful waterways, and is a popular destination for more adventurous canoe trippers.  Most popular are the Bloodvein River, Gammon River, and the Sasaginnigak River.  
There are several fly in fishing lodges in the area.

Atikaki Park was initially to become a National Park but ended up as a Provincial Park. The park was partially mapped out by Marc Wermager.
No logging roads, logging areas, or major developments are allowed in the park.
