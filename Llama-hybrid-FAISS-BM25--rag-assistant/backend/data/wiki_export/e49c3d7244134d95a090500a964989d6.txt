The Austrian Rugby Federation () is the governing body for rugby union in Austria.

The first documented game of rugby played in Austria occurred on April 14, 1912. The sport was being brought to Austria by two Englishmen hoping to expand the sports base. It was over sixty years, however, before rugby union took hold in Austria.

Vienna Celtic RFC was founded in 1978 and was the first rugby union club founded in Austria. The ÖRV was founded in 1990 and joined the International Rugby Board in 1992.
