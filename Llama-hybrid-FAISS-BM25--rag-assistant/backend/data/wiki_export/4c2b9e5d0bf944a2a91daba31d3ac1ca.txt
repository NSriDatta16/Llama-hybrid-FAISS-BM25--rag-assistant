Grieg Hall () is a 1,500 seat concert hall located on Edvard Griegs' square in Bergen, Norway.

Grieghallen was named in honor of Bergen-born composer Edvard Grieg, who served as music director of the Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra from 1880 until 1882. It serves as the home of the Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra. The building was designed in modernist architecture style by the Danish architect Knud Munk. Construction began in 1967 and was finished by May 1978.
