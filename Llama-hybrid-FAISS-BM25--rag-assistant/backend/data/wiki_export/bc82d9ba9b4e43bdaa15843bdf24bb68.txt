West 25th–Ohio City station is a station on the RTA Red Line in the Ohio City neighborhood of Cleveland, Ohio. It is located at the intersection of West 24th Street, Abbey Avenue and Lorain Avenue (Ohio State Route 10), diagonally across Lorain Avenue from the West Side Market.

History 
The station opened on August 14, 1955, when the west side portion of the CTS Rapid Transit began operation.

When RTA began a program of rebuilding stations, including making them accessible compliant, West 25th Station was the first station renovated. The new $2.6 million station opened September 1992. The old utilitarian station was replaced with a station featuring a glass canopy with a bright red head house.

The Red Line Greenway opened alongside the station in 2021. This  paved trail, part of the Cleveland Metroparks system, connects the Centennial Lake Link Trail, West 25th–Ohio City station and West 65th–Lorain station.
