In 2003, Hill sent a tape to Total Nonstop Action Wrestling and was later given a tryout match with the company. According to Hill, after management said that he looked similar to André 3000, he and Christopher Daniels came up with the ring name D-Ray 3000. After signing with TNA, he debuted in 2004 and after was paired with Shark Boy, the team soon began to take on a comedic aspect, and periodically filmed humorous vignettes outside the Impact! Zone until D-Ray left TNA in the summer of 2005. D-Ray 3000 returned to TNA in October 2006 at TNA's flagship pay-per-view Bound for Glory, where he took part in the "Kevin Nash Open Invitational X Division Gauntlet Battle Royal" and even reunited briefly with Shark Boy.
