Episodes
The show consisted of Famous Studios-produced cartoons from 1950 to 1964. There were 223 theatrical cartoons released during that period, and only 165 cartoons were included in their full format, although the original theatrical titles were changed when Harvey assumed ownership from Famous. The remainder of the 58 cartoons were either only included as fragments or not included. Jerry Beck later explained that the trimming of some cartoons was only done to help each episode fit the half-hour format, and some were excluded from the show either from oversight or because the content of those cartoons could be considered un-PC.

All original television-produced shorts on the show were either from later TV cartoons featuring Casper and the Film Roman version of Richie Rich, and those were mostly featured in the final season of The Harveytoons Show.

Each episode included three full cartoons and one "ToonTake" segment.

Home releases
In January 2005, a single DVD release titled "Hooky Spooky" containing three episodes of this series (the Casper and Friends version) was released by Right Entertainment/Universal Pictures Video in the United Kingdom.

In 2006, Classic Media released 52 of the show's 78 episodes on a four-disc DVD set titled Harvey Toons – The Complete Collection. The set received mixed reviews from animation fans, and the show's consultant, Jerry Beck, said Classic Media did not consult with him on making this DVD release. He stated that he would not have included the show's formatting of those cartoons, but did applaud Classic Media for the very good picture quality of the included shorts and for the set's low price tag, considering the high number of cartoons in the set. In 2011, Vivendi Entertainment and Classic Media released all Herman and Katnip cartoons on a single disc DVD set titled Herman and Katnip: The Complete Collection. In the same year, Shout! Factory released 61 of 78 Casper cartoons from The Harveytoons Show on a three-disc DVD set titled Casper the Friendly Ghost: The Complete Collection.
