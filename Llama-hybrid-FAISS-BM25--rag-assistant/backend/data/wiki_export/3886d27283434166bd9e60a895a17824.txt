Prince George's County Public Schools (PGCPS) is a public school district that serves Prince George's County, Maryland. During the 2023-2024 academic year, the district enrolls 133,000 students and operates over 200 schools. PGCPS is the second-largest school district in Maryland, the third-largest district in the Washington-Baltimore metropolitan area, the 18th-largest in the United States, and the nation's largest school district with a majority-black student population.

Headquartered in Upper Marlboro, PGCPS is the county's sole school district. The Prince George's County Board of Education (BoE) comprises 14 members who oversee the Superintendent.

The current Superintendent is Millard House II.

History

Early years of PGCPS (1899–1974) 
In 1899, Laurel High was founded as the first high school in Prince George's County. Situated at Montgomery and Eighth Streets in Downtown Laurel, it began with nine teachers and 59 students, with the 1900 graduating class being all women. The school's roof served as a Civil Defense Aircraft Spotting Station during World War II. By 1965, the school relocated to a more expansive campus. The original building, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, now functions as a community center.

In 1952, the school district permitted black students to attend grades 1-12. Before this, black students in the county were limited to the 11th grade, while only white students could progress to the 12th grade.

PGCPS ran three high schools exclusively for black students before desegregation: Marlboro Colored High (now Frederick Douglass High School) in Upper Marlboro, Lakeland High School in College Park and Fairmont Heights High School.

Desegregation (1974–2009) 

In 1974, Prince George's County became the nation's largest school district mandated to implement a busing plan to address segregation. Despite the county's over 80% white demographic at the time, specific communities near Washington, D.C. had denser black populations. Although school boundaries were based on communities, the NAACP contended they mirrored segregated housing patterns. Consequently, a federal court mandated a school busing plan. A 1974 Gallup poll indicated that 75% of the county opposed forced busing, with just 32% of black respondents in favor.

The court-mandated busing commenced abruptly mid-school year, excluding final-year high school students. This swift transition disturbed regular school activities and affected family life due to altered schedules, transportation challenges, and disrupted extracurriculars.

By 2001, the court concluded that segregation had been sufficiently addressed. The busing order ended, and neighborhood-centric school boundaries were reinstated.

School mergers and consolidation (2009–2019)
In 2009, the Prince George's County Public Schools Board voted to merge eight under-enrolled schools and bolster its magnet program offerings. This decision was informed by community consultations, public hearings, and over 2,500 survey responses.

Key aspects of the 2009 consolidation:

 Eight schools, including Berkshire, John Carroll, and John E. Howard Elementaries, were permanently closed for the 2009-2010 academic year.
 Five schools, like Andrew Jackson Middle and Samuel P. Massie Elementary, transitioned to K-8 programs.
 Benjamin D. Foulois Elementary was converted into a K-8 Creative & Performing Arts magnet center.
 Concord, Dodge Park, District Heights, and Oakcrest elementary schools remained open despite potential closure considerations.

By 2016, additional school consolidations occurred due to changing student populations, particularly in the southern parts of the county. Conversely, northern regions, including Beltsville and Hyattsville, saw increased enrollment and overcrowding.

Data Breachs and COVID-19 impact (2020-present)
Because of The COVID-19 impact, PGCPS schools went through lockdown after March 13, 2020. The 2020-2021 school year was online during the year until April 2021 with hybrid learning. The 2021-2022 was virtual for some and in-person for some. Because of COVID-19 cases increasing during Late 2021. PGCPS went through online school mode again until January 18, 2022 for in-person students and January 31, 2022 for virtual students to go to in-person school.

In August 14, PGCPS encountered a data breach which caused all students and staff to be locked out. Students had to reset their password during The week of August 28, while staff had to reset it right now. PGCPS were able to regain control of their systems within the first 12 hours. PGCPS sent a message to every student in the district about the cyber attack.

Starting from the 2023-2024 school year, clear backpacks are required for high school students and Non Traditional Program North, South and Middle and optional for middle school students to combat shooting in the district.

Demographics 
For the 2023-2024 academic year, PGCPS boasts an enrollment of over 133,000 students. In the DC area, only neighboring Montgomery County Public Schools in Maryland and Fairfax County Public Schools in Virginia surpass this number.

Based on September 2022 demographic data, the racial and ethnic composition of PGCPS students is as follows:

Further, 60.4% of students participate in the federal Free and Reduced Lunch program, 10.4% are enrolled in special education courses, and nearly 25% of PGCPS students are English language learners.

Superintendent/CEO
In 2013, a governance reorganization led by then-County Executive Rushern Baker renamed the superintendent position to Chief Executive Officer of PGCPS. Dubbed a 'takeover' of the county's school system, this shift increased the operational control for the CEO while limiting the school board's powers. Dr. Kevin Maxwell was the inaugural CEO of Prince George's County Public Schools, serving until 2018. He was succeeded by Dr. Monica Goldson, who remained in the position through the 2022-2023 school year.

After a rigorous 6-month nationwide search, the district shortlisted three candidates. Following an interview with County Executive Angela Alsobrooks, Millard House II, former Superintendent of the Houston Independent School District, was chosen to succeed Dr. Goldson. With House's appointment as Superintendent in June 2023, the district ceased referring to its head as CEO.

Transportation

Prince George's County Public Schools operates its bus system, providing student transportation. The fleet comprises various school bus models from Blue Bird Corporation, IC Bus, and Thomas Built Buses, all running on diesel. Accessible buses are available for special-needs children. All buses bear the Prince George's County Public Schools inscription.

With 12 bus lots, the transportation department dispatches over 1,900 drivers and 1,200 buses on more than 5,000 routes. Annually, at least 83,000 students utilize these services. Routes are labeled with three-digit numbers like 615 or a combination of letters and numbers such as B12.

Besides daily commuting, buses also serve school field trips, athletic events, and other sanctioned activities within Maryland and the region. Bus ridership is contingent on the student's distance from school, generally around two miles for intermediate/secondary schools and one and a half miles for primary institutions.

Notably, the district offers students in magnet programs bus service throughout the county, with ridership not contingent on the student's proximity to school.

List of schools

High schools 

All high schools in Prince George's County operate with a "comprehensive" model as their base, with the exception of the new Academy of Health Sciences at Prince George's Community College, which is a middle college program. All students are assigned to a high school based on an attendance area.

Magnet Programs operate as a "School-Within-A-School" model, where the magnet serves as an alternative program---in addition to the main comprehensive program---and students from outside the regular attendance area of the high school are enrolled and accepted into the magnet, either through continuity (automatic continuation from a middle school magnet program to the high school level equivalent) or more commonly, through a Magnet Lottery, in which students apply for a magnet program and are granted acceptance through a random drawing. Enrollment into the Center for the Visual and Performing Arts is through audition only.

Several high schools have also implemented a Smaller Learning Community model, where they offer anywhere from two or more Academy Programs, which effectively breaks a school down into several smaller schools within the school, by allowing students to essentially declare a major (such as a student attending a college or university) through career academies such as "Arts, Media, and Communication" or the "National Academy of Finance," for example.

All high schools within PGCPS operate on a staggered school day schedule, where some high schools start as early as 7:45am and end as early as 2:25pm, and other high schools start as late as 9:30am and end as late as 4:10pm. All high schools operate on an alternating A/B-day block scheduling system, where one group of classes are taken on "A-Days" and a different group of classes are taken on "B-Days," and the cycle repeats. Most high schools have between three and four lunch shifts, depending on enrollment and eating accommodations. The only exceptions are Eleanor Roosevelt High School — which has adopted a modified hybrid block schedule in which both traditional single period courses and double period (block schedule) courses are integrated — and the Academy of Health Science at Prince George's Community College.

 Middle schools 

Intermediate schools are referred to as "middle schools" in the PGCPS system, and operate as grades 6–8 middle schools. Grades 7–9 junior high school were phased out in the mid-1980s. Recent efforts have been made to convert most middle schools to the more popular grades 6–8 model. Issues in the past such as over-enrollment, lack of classroom space, and funding, had made it hard to convert all middle schools to a grades 6–8 configuration, but with increased funding and the addition of new middle schools, the transition is slowly being made, to be completed by the beginning of SY2024-2025.

Most middle schools in Prince George's County operate with a "comprehensive" model, as their base. Most students are assigned to a middle school based on an "attendance area." Most magnet programs operate as a "School-Within-A-School" model, where the magnet serves as an alternative program, in addition to the main comprehensive program, and students from outside the regular attendance area of the middle school are enrolled and accepted into the magnet, either through "continuity" (automatic continuation from an elementary school magnet program to the middle school level equivalent) or more commonly, through a magnet lottery, where students apply for a magnet program and are granted acceptance through a random drawing. Almost all middle schools have a whole-school "Signature Program" that includes a specialized program of instruction which is the foundation of the school's comprehensive program.

All middle schools in the PGCPS operate on a staggered school day schedule, where some middle schools start as early as 7:30 am and the end as early as 2:50 pm, and other middle schools start as late as 9:00 am and end as late as 4:20 pm. All middle schools operate on a modified block scheduling system, where some classes meet for as long as 70-minutes, daily. For the 2012-13 school year and beyond, an additional 40-minutes of instruction time has been added to the school day for all middle schools and their students, within the school district.

In a cooperative effort of the county government, Board of Education, and the Maryland-National Capital Park & Planning Commission (M-NCPPC) some M-NCPPC community centers are physically connected to middle schools, throughout the district. The unique community park/school centers features shared use areas which include a gymnasium, multi-purpose room, exercise/fitness room, dance room, arts and crafts room, computer lab, offices; storage areas, patio area, and restrooms. There are tennis courts and unlighted fields located on-site at select centers.

Dedicated magnet schools
Dedicated magnet schools are offered in the PGCPS system at the PreK-8th grade, elementary and middle school level only. As of 2012-13, Glenarden Woods and Heather Hills are the only full elementary-level dedicated magnet schools in the system. Dedicated magnet schools are "whole school" programs and differ from traditional comprehensive schools, as (1) all students at the school are enrolled and receive instruction in the magnet program and (2) traditional attendance areas for assigning students to a school are replaced by much larger geographical attendance zones, usually split between north county (areas north of Central Avenue) and south county (areas south of Central Avenue). Whole school, dedicated magnet programs are offered through the Creative and Performing Arts, French Immersion, Montessori, and Talented & Gifted Center magnet programs. Students receive specialized instruction that varies from the typical comprehensive program, offered at most other schools. Students are selected for the magnet programs through a magnet lottery for the French Immersion and Montessori programs and also for the Creative and Performing Arts program at the elementary school level. Acceptance into the Creative and Performing Arts program is through audition only at the middle school level. Acceptance into the TAG Centers at Glenarden Woods and Heather Hills Elementary Schools is through specialized TAG testing only.

 Combined elementary and middle schools 
Pre-kindergarten through grade 8 schools are essentially combined elementary and middle schools, facilitated in one building. Most of these schools are referred to as "academies" in the school district. The elementary school usually starts at pre-kindergarten and ends at grade 5 and the middle school starts at grade 6 and ends at grade 8. These schools usually offer a slightly enhanced standard of learning and studies have suggested that students have benefited from being in one continuous facility from kindergarten through 8th grade, without having the disruption having to attend a brand new school, for the middle school years. Cora L. Rice Elementary School and G. James Gholson Middle School are not true academies. Both schools are housed in one facility but they operate as two completely separate schools for all intents and purposes.

 Elementary schools 

Elementary schools in Prince George's County operate in several configurations, ranging from Pre-K (Head Start) through grade 6. Most elementary schools operate under a kindergarten through grade 6 configuration, and lack a pre-kindergarten/Head Start program. More recently, with boundary realignments to ease overcrowding and with the opening of newer and larger schools and increased funding, several schools have changed to a PreK-6th grade configuration while others have added a Pre-kindergarten, but dropped the sixth grade, to change to a Pre-K through grade 5 school. The sixth grades from those schools were added to the elementary schools' feeder middle schools.

In a cooperative effort of the county government, board of education, and the Maryland National Capital Park & Planning Commission (M-NCPPC), several M-NCPPC community centers are physically connected to elementary schools, throughout the district. The unique community park/school centers features shared use areas which include a gymnasium, multi-purpose room, exercise/fitness room, dance room, arts and crafts room, computer lab, offices, storage areas, patio area, and restrooms. Tennis courts and unlighted fields are located on-site at select centers.

Accolades and achievements
Newsweeks America's Best High Schools
In June 2010, seven PGCPS high school were listed in Newsweeks annual list of the top 1600 high schools in the nation. This was up from five county high schools which made the list from the previous year. The 2010 list included Eleanor Roosevelt High School in Greenbelt (#409), Oxon Hill High School in Oxon Hill (#957), Bowie High School in Bowie (#1,173), Laurel High School in Laurel (#1,343), High Point High School in Beltsville (#1,361), Central High School in Capitol Heights (#1,429), and Parkdale High School in Riverdale (#1,481).

The schools are ranked on the number of Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate and/or Cambridge tests taken by all students in a school in 2009, divided by the number of graduating seniors, called the "Challenge Index".  The schools represent the top six percent of all public high schools in America. In June 2009, five PGCPS high schools were named in the best high schools list. It included Bowie High School in Bowie, Charles Herbert Flowers High School in Springdale, High Point High School in Beltsville, Oxon Hill High School in Oxon Hill, and Eleanor Roosevelt High School in Greenbelt.

Magnet programs and centers
Magnet programs were first implemented in PGCPS in 1985, to fulfill a court-ordered desegregation mandate. Up until as late as the late 80s, Prince George's County had been predominantly white in terms of racial demographics. In order to desegregate mostly all-White schools in the school system, PGCPS created several magnet programs that eventually were instituted in over fifty schools, spread throughout the county.

By the late 1990s, the population demographics of the county had shifted towards a mostly African American majority. Magnet programs (as they were set up) were costing PGCPS approximately $14 million per year, to operate. The programs were costly and this was exacerbated by the fact that the school system's operating budget was greater than the final budget the school system had traditionally been allotted, an issue that had plagued the school system for years. Since the county's population now primarily consisted of African Americans, and due to the expense of operating the Magnet Schools Program, courts began to investigate the justification of PGCPS's magnet program. In 2004, a court ruled to discontinue court-ordered busing which had existed in the county, for over 30 years, based primarily on the fact that desegregation was no longer an issue in the predominantly Black Prince George's County.

With the ending of the court-ordered busing, also came changes to the school system's Magnet Schools Program. The program had gained national attention, as it was one of the largest in the country. It served as a model for school systems across the nation. Dr. Iris T. Metts, the superintendent of schools at the time, formulated an ambitious plan to actually expand the magnet programs in PGCPS, as well as reassign magnet programs that weren't performing well at one location, to other schools. Due to long and highly publicized in-house issues between Metts and the board of education, Metts was replaced by Dr. Andre Hornsby at the end of her contract with PGCPS. When Hornsby arrived, he essentially reversed the decision that Metts had made, in regards to the future of the county's magnet programs, and he decided to instead eliminate most of the school system's magnet programs, most of which had been identified as under-performing for several years. Ten magnet programs were identified for elimination, which proved extremely controversial because some of the proposed eliminated programs were located at sites in which the program in question had been extremely successful, such as the Academic Center magnet program at Martin Luther King, Jr. Academic Center, which had been the highest performing middle school in the system for several years and also was a blue ribbon school.

Despite the opposition by parents, in 2006 the magnet programs in PGCPS underwent an overhaul, and most of the magnets were eliminated. A few programs that were determined to be "successful" were either expanded and replicated at other locations, or consolidated and relocated to a dedicated magnet school that would serve large geographic areas of the county.

French Immersion
The French Immersion Magnet Program is designed for kindergarten through twelfth grade. It is referred to as a "full immersion program" as all academic subjects are taught through French, in grades K-5. In grades 6-8, the students have two periods per day of French, one period for French Language Arts and one period of world studies in French. In high school, students have two courses in grades 9 and 10 with a focus on literature and the francophone world, which are part of the Pre-International Baccalaureate (IB) Program. At the elementary level, students are immerse totally in French by their bilingual teachers, as they learn math, science, social studies and language arts.

At the middle school level, students also study Italian. In addition, Algebra and Geometry are possible options in mathematics. The interdisciplinary approach for English, Art and World Studies includes special themes, seminars, field trips, and a strong focus on essay writing. International travel is an enrichment part of the French Immersion Program.

At the high school level, students may take one of the immersion courses and the continuation of the second foreign language started at the middle school level. Other options are IB preparation courses for English, history, science, and access to Chemistry and Calculus. Higher level IB or Advanced Placement (AP) courses, are available. There is an Exchange Program with a school in France and other exchanges are being explored for high school students.

Montessori
Prince George's County Public Schools has implemented two facilities dedicated to the Montessori instructional program — the Robert Goddard Montessori School and the John Hanson Montessori School. As dedicated facilities, these schools do not have a neighborhood attendance area. Entry into the program is through the random lottery application process only.

The Montessori Primary Program for children ages 3 to 6 years old is based on the Montessori educational philosophy. Taught by Montessori accredited teachers, young children are guided in developing an inner discipline, strengthening their coordination, and extending their concentration span. These accomplishments result with their readily learning to read, write and grasp mathematics. The program consists of a half-day morning for preschoolers (ages 3 ). Children older than four must be enrolled in a certified Montessori program to be accepted into the program.

The Montessori Lower Elementary Program is designed for students ages 6 to 9 years old with prior Montessori experience. Rapid growth and learning is observed in classrooms filled with appropriate educational materials. The Montessori Upper Elementary Program continues for the next age grouping of students ages 9–12 with prior Montessori experience. Taught by Montessori accredited teachers, these elementary program students study an integrated curriculum that includes: mathematics, geometry, language, cultural studies, astronomy, biology, chemistry, geography, history, geology, philosophy, art, music and physical education.

The Montessori Middle School Program completes the Montessori studies for students progressing to the seventh and eighth grades. An interdisciplinary teaching team provides the Montessori Program for multidisciplinary learning to include English Language Arts, mathematics, science and social studies. At the high school level, the student can apply for entry to Biotechnology, Biomedical, Military Academy, Center for the Visual & Performing Arts and/or the Science & Technology Center.Locations:Robert Goddard Montessori School

Science and Technology Center
The Science and Technology Center (S/T) is a highly challenging four-year curriculum which provides college-level academic experiences in science, mathematics, and technology. The program is not a true magnet program, as students are admitted into the S/T program based on competitive examination only, as opposed to the standard magnet lottery process. Of twenty-eight possible credits, a student is required to obtain a minimum of thirteen credits in specific mathematics, pre-engineering technology, research and science courses. In grades nine and ten, the program consists of common experiences courses for all student. In grades eleven and twelve, each student must choose course work from at least one of four major study areas. Students are expected to be enrolled in a full schedule of classes during the entire four-year program. External experiences are possible and encouraged, but must be a direct extension or enrichment of the Science and Technology Program, and have the recommendation of the Science and Technology Center Coordinator prior to approval by the principal.

The program is offered at three centers — Eleanor Roosevelt High School in northern Prince George's County, Oxon Hill High School in southern Prince George's County, and Charles Herbert Flowers High School in central Prince George’s County. Students attend the center that serves their legal residence. Transportation is provided for all students. Each school is a four-year comprehensive high school, as well as a Science and Technology Center. Each school is an active member of the National Consortium for Specialized Secondary Schools of Mathematics, Science and Technology (NCSSSMST).

Admission into the Science and Technology Center is highly competitive and contingent upon three criterion, with all criterion weighed equally. The criterion are:

Grades from four quarters of 7th grade and the first quarter of 8th grade (or four quarters of 8th grade and first quarter of 9th grade) in math, science, English, and social studies
A standardized reading comprehension test
A standardized numerical test

All of these are factored into a final score. The number of students admitted into the S/T program vary from each school, but as an example, 225-250 students with the top scores are admitted to Roosevelt's Science and Technology Program. The next 60 students are placed on a waiting list. All interested 8th and 9th grade students who are residents of Prince George's County are eligible to apply for admission to the Science and Technology Center.

Spanish Dual Language Program
The Spanish Dual Language Program gives equal emphasis to English and non-English language speakers. Students learn Spanish and English through content based instruction in selected core subjects with a cross cultural understanding for both native and non-native speakers. Students read, write, listen and speak in both languages, becoming bilingual, biliterate and bicultural.

Locations
Cesar Chavez Elementary School

Spanish Immersion
Language Immersion is an educational approach in which students are taught the curriculum content through the medium of a second language, Spanish. Children learn their entire core subjects (reading, writing, mathematics, social studies, and science) in Spanish. Spanish speaking teachers immerse student completely in Spanish as they learn. In this way, immersion students not only learn the content, but also gain knowledge of the language in which it is taught.
