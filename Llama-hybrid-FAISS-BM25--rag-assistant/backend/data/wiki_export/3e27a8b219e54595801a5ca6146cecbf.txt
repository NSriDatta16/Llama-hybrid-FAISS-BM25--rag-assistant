The Toyota Vios is a nameplate used for subcompact cars produced by the Japanese manufacturer Toyota, primarily for markets in Southeast Asia, China and Taiwan since 2002. Slotted below the compact Corolla, the Vios serves as the replacement to the Tercel (marketed as Soluna in Thailand since 1997 and Indonesia since 2000), which filled the subcompact or B-segment sedan class in the region. It is also successor to the entry-level variants of the E110 series Corolla in some markets such as the Philippines and Vietnam.

From 2005, the Vios was also marketed alongside its hatchback complement known as the Yaris in many countries globally. The second-generation Vios was released in 2007, which was marketed as the Belta in Japan and Toyota Yaris sedan in the Americas, the Middle East and Australia. The second-generation model shares its platform with the XP90 series Vitz/Yaris.

The third-generation Vios was released in 2013, which shares the platform with the XP150 series Yaris hatchback. It is marketed in regions outside Southeast Asia, China and Taiwan as the Yaris sedan. Through a major refresh in 2017, the Vios shares the same styling as the refreshed XP150 series Yaris hatchback. The heavily facelifted model also gained more global presence by local production in Brazil, India and Pakistan as the Yaris sedan. A separate, less major refresh was introduced for the Chinese market Vios in 2016 alongside a hatchback model marketed as the Toyota Vios FS.

In Thailand, the 2017 facelifted model was marketed as the Toyota Yaris Ativ, which shares the smaller 1.2-litre engine with the Yaris hatchback. The 1.5-litre Vios continued to be sold alongside the Yaris Ativ until 2022, using the Chinese market facelift styling.

The fourth-generation model was released in 2022 in Thailand as the Yaris Ativ. It was designed and engineered by Daihatsu using its DNGA platform.

The "Vios" name is derived from the Latin word "vio", meaning "go or travel (forward)", while Toyota marketed the car in Indonesia in 2007 with the backronym "Very Intelligent, Outstanding Sedan". In Indonesia, downgraded models of the Vios to cater for taxi fleet was marketed as the Toyota Limo through three generations.

First generation (XP40; 2002) 

The first-generation Vios, codenamed XP40, was first previewed as a prototype model called the Toyota T-1, which was showcased in Beijing during Auto China 2002 in June. It is based on the Echo, which was sold in China as the Xiali 2000. Toyota mentioned that the T-1 has a .

In October 2002, the XP40 series Vios was started to be assembled in China by Tianjin FAW Toyota. It was also produced at Thailand's Toyota Gateway Plant in Gateway City, Amphoe Plaeng Yao, Chachoengsao Province, as part of a cooperative project between Thai engineers and Toyota's Japanese designers.

The Vios was adapted from the Platz with modified body panels and portions of the car feature design cues from the E120 series Corolla. Like the Vitz and Platz, the Vios features instrument panel mounted on the top center of the dashboard.

In Thailand, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Singapore, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan, the Vios is equipped with a 1.5 L 1NZ-FE engine with VVT-i. The smaller 1.3 L 2NZ-FE engine is offered in the Philippines. In China, the Vios () comes with the 1.3 L 8A-FE and 1.5 L 5A-FE. Trim levels for Southeast Asian markets include J, E, G and S, while the DLX, GL, GLX and GLXi are offered in China.

In September 2005, the Vios received minor cosmetic changes to its exterior and interior for the 2006 model year. Updates included the front bumper, headlights and tail lights, redesigned alloy rims, speedometer dial design, and added a console box in the interior.

The Vios was campaigned in the Touring Car Championships in Indonesia and One Make Races in Thailand.

Taxicab versions marketed in Indonesia have less equipment and is rebadged as the Limo. This is not to be confused with certain taxis with the same name in Thailand, which use Corollas.

Third generation (XP150; 2013) 

The third-generation Vios (designated XP150) for the Asian market was unveiled on 25 March 2013 at the 34th Bangkok International Motor Show in Thailand. Its design was previewed by the Dear Qin sedan concept that was first displayed at the April 2012 Auto China. Toyota aimed to designate the third-generation Vios as a global model, for markets outside of Asia. The car was sold in Thailand shortly after, and from the second quarter in Asia. The exterior was enlarged over the front and rear sections and its styling outline was later followed by the XP150 series Yaris hatchback for the Southeast Asian market. The instrument cluster position is no longer mounted on the centre of the dashboard.

In regions such as Africa, South America, the Caribbean and the Middle East, it is marketed as the Yaris Sedan.

In Mexico and certain South American countries, the XP150 series Vios (for global markets) was sold as the Yaris Sedán. It was sold alongside the Mazda2-based Yaris R.

In 2017, a major facelift model was released, which introduced newer sheet metal, interior design, while sharing the same front styling with the Yaris hatchback. The platform was revised with additional weldings for more rigidity and also with additional emphasis on noise, vibration, and harshness. Based on Toyota's internal estimates, it saw an 11 percent improvement in this sector, with the dashboard alone received 40 percent more sound insulation than before. The facelifted model was marketed in Thailand with the 1.2-litre as the Yaris Ativ to be eligible with the Eco Car program, while the Vios continued to be sold with the Chinese facelift styling and a 1.5-litre engine as a more powerful alternative. However, the Yaris Ativ-based styling was used for most markets instead of the facelifted Vios sold exclusively in China and Thailand.

The XP150 series Vios/Yaris sedan, is not offered in the United States, Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. The second-generation (XP90 model) sedan was sold in these countries as the Yaris, but it was dropped in late 2011 due to lacklustre sales, with only the XP130 model being offered from the 2012 model year.

Side collision test manipulation 
On 28 April 2023, Daihatsu confirmed that the company had committed "wrongdoings" in approval application for side collision tests under UN-R95 requirements for four vehicles, including the AC100 series Yaris Ativ / Vios which was developed by the company. According to Daihatsu, the inside lining of the front seat door was improperly modified with a "notch"  to prevent the part from breaking into pieces with sharp edges that could injure occupants during a side airbag deployment. These modifications are not present in production vehicles. 76,289 units of the model are affected, which are already sold in Thailand, GCC, Mexico, and others. In response, Toyota chairman Akio Toyoda and Toyota president Koji Sato publicly apologized.

According to Toyota, Daihatsu conducted an internal retest without the modification, and the car passed the test. Another retest was conducted on 28 April 2023. The car also passed this test, and was verified by an independent testing agency that was present during the test. However, Toyota suspended deliveries to Thailand until the vehicles are retested for the third time to satisfy a specific "witness testing" requirement in that market.
