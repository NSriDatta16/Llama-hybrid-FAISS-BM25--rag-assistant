Tefillin controversy
In 2013, SAR High School made news by allowing female students to put on tefillin during morning prayers, becoming the first Modern Orthodox school to do so. This decision was generally supported by most; however it did cause the school to receive significant backlash from the more traditional community.

COVID-19 related shutdown 
On Tuesday, March 3rd, 2020, an email was sent out to the SAR Academy and High School announcing that school would be closed due to a parent in the community having contracting COVID-19, becoming the first school in the United States to close for the pandemic . The parents of students were asked to remain calm while no other cases were reported. The sister schools responded rapidly to the closing of classes. Within 24 hours, the schools had set up a plan for remote learning for their students, using the platform Zoom.
