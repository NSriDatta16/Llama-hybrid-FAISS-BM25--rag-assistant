Lairg railway station is a railway station just south of the village of Lairg in the Highland council area of Scotland. The station is on the Far North Line,  from , between Invershin and Rogart. ScotRail, who manage the station, operate all services.

History 
The station opened on 28 July 1874, as part of the Sutherland Railway, later becoming part of the Highland Railway and later the London, Midland and Scottish Railway.

Until April 2009 the station provided an interchange point for postbus services to the remote communities of Durness, Kinlochbervie and Tongue, Highland. Following considerable local opposition to the cancellation of the services they have now been replaced by temporary services operated, under contract from the Highland Council, by Stagecoach plc. The future of the services has yet to be determined.

Facilities 

Both platforms have waiting areas and benches, whilst there are also bike racks and a help point adjacent to platform 2. Platform 2 has step-free access from the car park, whilst platform 1 can only be accessed from the footbridge. As there are no facilities to purchase tickets, passengers must buy one in advance, or from the guard on the train.

Services 

Four Inverness to  via Thurso trains call here each way on weekdays and Saturdays (along with a fifth Inverness departure southbound in the early morning) and a single departure each way on Sundays.
