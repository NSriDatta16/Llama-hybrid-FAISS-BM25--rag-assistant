Richard Francis Donnelly (born August 3, 1946) is an American professional baseball coach. On March 7, 2014, he was named third-base coach of the Seattle Mariners, replacing John Stearns. He served in the post for two seasons, through , before his release on October 9, 2015. Donnelly was a Major League Baseball (MLB) coach for over 25 years, and was a catcher during his active career in minor league baseball.

Donnelly had been slated to spend  as manager of the Tacoma Rainiers of the Pacific Coast League, the Mariners' Triple-A affiliate. However, Stearns underwent hiatal hernia surgery prior to spring training on February 24, and his slower-than-expected recovery caused him to step down to a professional scouting post with the Mariners. Donnelly was then named to take his place on the staff of manager Lloyd McClendon, whose playing tenure with the Pittsburgh Pirates (1990–1994) coincided with Donnelly's service on Jim Leyland's coaching staff.

Prior to joining the Mariners' organization in 2014, Donnelly spent three seasons (2011–2013) as manager of the Brooklyn Cyclones of the New York–Penn League, Short Season-A farm club of the New York Mets.

Personal life 
Donnelly is on the Board of Directors for the International Racquetball Tour and is an avid racquetball player. When asked which sport he favors between baseball and racquetball, he answered racquetball without hesitating.

Perhaps the best known story of Donnelly is his experience coaching the Florida Marlins in the 1997 World Series. His 18-year-old daughter, Amy, died of a brain tumor in 1993. Amy attended a 1992 playoff game in which Rich was coaching. She noticed that he would cup his hands over his mouth while yelling out instructions to runners on second base. After the game, she asked, "Dad, what are you telling them? That the chicken runs at midnight, or what?" After her death, "The Chicken Runs at Midnight" was engraved on her tombstone and it became the family motto.

In 1997, as a member of the Florida Marlins, he met Craig Counsell, a player his son Tim nicknamed "Chicken" because of his unique batting stance. In the 11th inning of Game 7, Counsell reached base and was able to advance to third base as the inning progressed. Edgar Rentería then hit a single on which Counsell scored, winning the World Series for the Marlins. Rich's sons Tim and Mike, who were honorary bat boys that evening, rushed to their father in celebration. Tim pointed out to the stadium clock which read 12:00 midnight, telling his father, "The Chicken ran at midnight, Dad." Donnelly believes that Amy was sending him a message from Heaven, and this experience has strengthened his faith in God. 

Donnelly's son, Michael, was killed at age 38 in a car accident on January 7, 2018. Michael and a few others had stopped to help a motorist push their disabled car off the highway when a car struck Michael and a woman. The mother-of-two was saved by Michael, who grabbed her shirt and pulled her into his body, shielding her from the brunt of the impact. Lyndsee Longoria, the woman that Michael saved, keeps in contact with Donnelly, who comforted her in the difficult months after the accident. In November 2018, she gave birth to her third child, whom she named Michael Donnelly Longoria.

Rich Donnelly has six living children.

The Chicken Runs at Midnight by Tom Friend is a book about Donnelly's story, released on October 2, 2018. The book was featured on the documentary Champions of Faith, highlighting the stories of Catholic MLB players.
