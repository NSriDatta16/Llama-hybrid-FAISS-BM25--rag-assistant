The 2007 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships (2007 WJHC) was the 2007 edition of the Ice Hockey World Junior Championship and was held in Mora and Leksand, Sweden between December 26, 2006 and January 5, 2007. The venues were FM Mattsson Arena in Mora, and Ejendals Arena in Leksand.  The total attendance was a significant drop off from the 325,000-plus visitors at the previous World Juniors in British Columbia, Canada.

For 2007, the tournament round-robin format was changed from previous years to resemble more closely the format used in the National Hockey League. Teams would receive three points for a win in regulation, while teams winning in overtime would receive two points.  Teams losing in overtime would receive one point.  During the round-robin portion of the tournament, a five-minute, four-on-four sudden-victory overtime would be played, while the knockout games and the gold medal game would use full-strength, ten- and twenty-minute sudden-victory overtimes, respectively.  If the game remained tied after overtime, an NHL-style shootout (with three skaters instead of five, as per other international competitions) would be held.

Canada won its third consecutive gold medal, capping an undefeated tournament with a 4–2 victory over Russia in the gold medal game. The world championship for Canada was also their first on European ice in a decade; the Canadians had not won a World Junior gold medal in Europe since 1997 in Geneva, Switzerland, when they defeated the United States in the gold medal game.

Canadian goaltender Carey Price was named tournament MVP, garnering a 1.14 goals against average (GAA).
