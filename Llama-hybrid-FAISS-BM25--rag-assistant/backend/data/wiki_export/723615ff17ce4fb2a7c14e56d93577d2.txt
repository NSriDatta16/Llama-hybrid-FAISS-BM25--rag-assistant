Chester Williams Rice (December 16, 1888 â€“ March 8, 1951) was an American electrical engineer who was the joint inventor in 1925 of the moving coil loudspeaker along with Edward W. Kellogg.

Career

Rice was born in Lynn, Massachusetts in 1888 and educated at The Albany Academy and Harvard College, from which he received an S.B. and an M.E.E. in 1911. He was later employed by General Electric in Schenectady, New York.
