8th & Pine station is a St. Louis MetroLink subway station.  This station is located in Downtown St. Louis and primarily serves the Central Business District, its residents, and commuters.  The historic U.S. Customhouse and Post Office and Citygarden are nearby.  Gateway Arch National Park recommends visitors accessing the park via public transportation use this station or the Laclede's Landing station.

The station was built within the historic St. Louis Freight Tunnel that originally opened in 1874. Built to carry train traffic between the Eads Bridge and the Mill Creek Valley rail yards, it saw its last train (Amtrak) in 1974. Renovation of the tunnels began in 1991 to prepare them for the opening of MetroLink in 1993.

On January 20, 2023, Metro Transit announced that 8th & Pine would undergo a full rehabilitation. These improvements include updating elevator, escalator and stair access, lighting upgrades, improved signage and way-finding, a deep cleaning, and general infrastructure upgrades like new walls and flooring.
