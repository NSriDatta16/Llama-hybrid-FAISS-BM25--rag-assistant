Kraut was a New York City punk rock/hardcore punk band formed in 1981. The original members were Davy Gunner (vocals), Doug Holland (guitar/vocals) Don Cowan (bass/vocals), and Johnny Feedback (drums/vocals).

History 
Kraut's first performance was opening for The Clash at Bonds International Casino in New York on June 11, 1981.

Their debut single, "Kill for Cash", and second single, "Unemployed", were both released in 1981 on the band's own Cabbage Records label.

While recording their debut album, An Adjustment to Society (produced by Ryk Oakley), they opened for the Professionals at The Channel in Boston. Former Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones became friends with Kraut and recorded extra guitar tracks for three tracks on the album: "Kill for Cash", "Sell Out" and "Onward". The album was again self-released, distributed by Faulty Products. A video clip for "All Twisted" appeared in rotation on MTV, making Kraut the first independent band to be played on the station.

The band released a mini-album, Whetting the Scythe, in 1984, and toured the U.S.

By the mid-1980s, Kraut had added second guitarist Christopher Smith from Battalion of Saints, and developed a more hard rock/metal sound.

Guitarist Holland went on to play for New York hardcore band the Cro-Mags.

A Kraut reunion show with all four original members took place in 2002 at CBGB during the New York Thrash reunion, yielding the Live at CBGB's album.
