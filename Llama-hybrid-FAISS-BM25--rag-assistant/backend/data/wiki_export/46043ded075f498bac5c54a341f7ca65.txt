Route description
SH 98 begins at an intersection with U.S. Route 67 at the community of Simms.  The route then travels to the north through ranchlands and forested areas in central Bowie County.  Noteworthy sights along this route include the Telford Unit, a 2,832-bed Texas Department of Criminal Justice prison site named for state congressman and De Kalb resident Barry Telford.  The route crosses Interstate 30 before reaching its northern terminus about a mile further north at U.S. Route 82.  The road continues further north as Farm to Market Road 3378.

History
The route is one of few routes that has changed its path very little since it was designated. The route was initially designated on July 18, 1924 between Simms and New Boston. On October 3, 1966, the route was redirected northward away from entering New Boston and to instead connect with Interstate 30, replacing Farm to Market Road 2552, which had just been paved at the time. The road into New Boston was re-designated as an eastward extension of Farm to Market Road 1840.
