Playing career

In his senior season, Green averaged 23.2 points, 5.2 rebound and 1.7 steals, leading to a First Team All-MAAC selection.

Green was selected 41st overall by the Indiana Pacers in the 1991 NBA draft, and became the last Gael to have played in an NBA game until Scott Machado had a short stint with the Houston Rockets in 2012. After playing two years with Indiana, Green opted to be traded to the Philadelphia 76ers. At the midpoint of his third year Green was traded to the Utah Jazz (with Jeff Hornacek), where he finished the 1994 season, and his NBA venture.

Green went on to play eight more years professionally in Europe, Asia, and South America: Venezuela (Puerto La Cruz 1994 and 1997 and Guanare 2002), Israel (Maccabi Jerusalem 1995), Italy (Milano 1996 and Napoli 1997), Philippines (Manila 1997 and 2000), Turkey (Istanbul 1998–2000) and France (Dijon 2001).

In just two years, the Tigers improved from a 4–14 record, to 18–7 in 2012, capturing their first Fairchester Athletic Association league and tournament championship in 23 years. After a successful 4 years of coaching at Convent of the Sacred Heart (57–28) from 2010–2014, Green coached and trained athletes throughout the NYC Metro area.
