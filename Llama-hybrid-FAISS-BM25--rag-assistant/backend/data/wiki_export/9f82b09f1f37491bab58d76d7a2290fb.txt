Administration 
The District is run by one board of education which is elected based on the High School District boundaries.  There are seven trustees, each elected for four-year terms.  Some are elected on the presidential election cycle and some are elected on the off-year cycle.  The trustee areas were created in late 2018 at which time the at-large election process was abandoned.

Elementary School Administration 

The Elementary School District is administered by the same board of education.  Two of the trustees are prohibited from residing in the Elementary District.  The other trustees may or may not live in the Elementary District.  The 2020-2022 Board has four trustees who do not live in the Elementary District and three trustees who live in the District.
