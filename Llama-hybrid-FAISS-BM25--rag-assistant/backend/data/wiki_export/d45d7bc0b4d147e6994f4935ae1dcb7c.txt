At the end of each school year (beginning of the year for the incoming-Freshman class), elections are held to determine the following year's class officers.  The entire class votes, and a simple majority is required to win a position.

Each council consists of elected officials, including the President, Vice President, Secretary, and Treasurer.  The President is responsible for organizing fundraisers and activities to be conducted by the student council.  The Vice President is responsible for assisting the President in fulfilling any and all of their responsibilities, and verifying that class officers stay on task.  The Secretary is responsible for logistics, record keeping, and internal affairs.  The Treasurer is responsible for monitoring all financial activities by the council, and working with the Secretary to keep accurate and available records.

There are two general advisers of the overarching Student Council, and typically two advisers for each individual class government.  There are also a number of student individuals appointed to the council, known as "Liaisons".  These Liaisons are usually evenly distributed throughout academies and majors, and are responsible for delivering information to each of their assigned homerooms and helping execute successful council events and fundraisers.
