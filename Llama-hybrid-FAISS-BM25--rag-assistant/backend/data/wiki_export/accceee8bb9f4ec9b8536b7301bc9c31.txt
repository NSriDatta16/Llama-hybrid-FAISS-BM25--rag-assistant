History 
West High School first opened its doors in 1972. Also in 1972, Sioux City's North High School opened, and a new building for Sioux City  East High School opened. North High School and West High School replaced Sioux City's first high school, Central High (named Sioux City High School until the opening of East High School in 1918) which opened in 1892.

In 2000, West High's feeder middle school, West Middle School began construction of a new building directly west of West High School, which opened in January 2002. Unlike West High School, West Middle School opened in its original building in 1918. Due to construction of West Middle School, the track, baseball, and softball fields had to be  moved and replaced, in order to make room for the new West Middle School.

On October 25, 2008, Sarah Palin (Vice-Presidential candidate for John McCain) held a rally in the school gym for the 2008 United States presidential election.

In October 2009. construction began on an expansion to the school building for 10 new brand new science classrooms. The expansion is directly integrating into the main academic classroom on the south side, towards the east end of the building.  Similar to the original construction, Sioux City's East and North High schools also had new science wings, and are nearly identical in function and size. West High's science classes began on March 7, 2011 in the new addition.

West High was named the 2010 School of Character by Character Counts of Iowa.

In September 2011 the school's lunchroom "The Den" was opened.

In 2011, West High became a recipient of Iowa's Safe and Supportive Schools grant.  Funds from this were used to improve the school.
