History 
Originally called Sham Shui Po Technical School, the school was founded on 11 September 1961. In 1964, it merged with Fuk Wah Secondary Modern School (福華街實用中學) and was renamed as Kowloon Technical School. As a result of the merger, the school became the largest secondary school in Hong Kong at the time. In the late 1960s and 1970s, Kowloon Technical School had more than 1900 students with 51 classes. However, due to rapid development of other areas in Kowloon, families have started to move to new areas away from Sham Shui Po. The student population has gradually reduced to around 1100.

In 1997, the Review of Prevocational and Secondary Technical Education proposed that technical schools change their name by removing the labelling terms. Kowloon Technical School was invited to change their name to Kowloon Government Secondary School (九龍官立中學). However, due to the strong objections from the school administration, the original name of the school was preserved.

In 1998, the teaching language was changed from English to Chinese. In 1999, the School Management Committee of Government Schools was founded.
