Jeonju International Film Festival (JIFF, Korean: 전주국제영화제, Hanja: 全州國際映畵祭) is an Asian film festival. It was launched in 2000 as a non-competitive film festival with partial competition. It introduces independent and experimental films to focus on the alternative course of contemporary film art.

In the first edition of JIFF, debut films of Darren Aronofsky were introduced to South Korea. For the first time in Asia, Jiff highlighted early works of Béla Tarr as well. The winners of Jeonju IFF's International Competition Section include Ying Liang, John Akomfrah and Miike Takashi.

Jeonju also produces movies. Directors that were once invited to Jeonju IFF were later invited again to Jeonju Digital Project (JDP), a set of three digital shorts. JDP granted financial support to masters for their short films and world-premiered those pieces in Jeonju.

Celebrating its 15th edition, JDP has boosted scale up to feature-length with GYÖRGY Pálfi (Hungary) and PARK Jung bum/SHIN Yeon-shick (Republic of Korea).

JIFF also features an experimental section called Expanded Cinema (formerly called Stranger than Cinema).

Jeonju Digital Project and Jeonju Cinema Project
From 2000 to 2013, JIFF's Jeonju Digital Project (JDP) bestowed KW50m each year to three directors to fund their short films. In 2014, JDP increased its total budget to KW180m to produce three feature films. In 2015, JDP was renamed to Jeonju Cinema Project (JCP), and the budget was further increased to KW300m.

Jeonju Digital Project 2000
The Jeonju International Film Festival presents Short Digital Films by Three Filmmakers (PARK Kwang-Su, ZHANG Yuan, and KIM Yun-Tae) in conversation with each other about their various interpretations of the digital film medium.

The filmmakers were given three conditions: to make a film in digital format, no longer than 30 minutes, and using a limited production budget. The three films construct one feature-length film entitled N, representing Next Generation, New Technology and Networking which are the common themes. Projects like Short Digital Films by Three Filmmakers, which focus on film production, creativity, and interactive technology, reflect the spirit of JIFF as they explore the zeitgeist of contemporary film.
