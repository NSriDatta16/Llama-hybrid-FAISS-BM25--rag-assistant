That Nashville Music (originally titled That Good Ole Nashville Music) was an American television program featuring country music artists performing their biggest hits of the day. The series aired in syndication from 1970–85.

Early in the series' run it was hosted by country artist Dave Dudley, and featured two or three artists per episode, from the legends to current superstars to up-and-coming acts. In later years each episode was hosted by a different artist, with two other artists featured. Each episode also featured a clogging routine, most often performed by  The Rutherford County Square Dancers or the Melvin Sloan Dancers or Ralph Sloan and the Tennessee Travelers.

The series was distributed by Show Biz Inc. and produced at Opryland USA in Nashville, Tennessee.  Purina Dog Chow was the show's sponsor.
