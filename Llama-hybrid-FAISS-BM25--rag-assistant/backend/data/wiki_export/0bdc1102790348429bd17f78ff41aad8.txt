California's 20th congressional district is a congressional district in California. Serving much of the southern and southeastern part of the state's Central Valley, the district is currently represented by Republican Kevin McCarthy, the former Speaker of the House.

Redistricting in 2022 returned the district to the San Joaquin Valley. The new 20th district includes parts of Kern, Tulare, Kings, and Fresno counties. It includes the southern Sierra Nevada and western Mojave Desert, with three "fingers" extending west into the valley. Cities in the district include Clovis, Tehachapi, Ridgecrest, Taft, Lemoore, the west and northeast sides of Bakersfield, the south side of Visalia, the northeast side of Tulare, the north side of Hanford, and a sliver of northeastern Fresno including California State University, Fresno. The new 20th district is the most Republican district in California, with a Cook Partisan Voting Index rating of R+16.

Before 2022, it encompassed much of the Central Coast region. The district included Monterey and San Benito counties, most of Santa Cruz County, and portions of Santa Clara County.

Before redistricting in 2011, the 20th district was located in the San Joaquin Valley. It covered Kings County and portions of Fresno and Kern counties, including most of the city of Fresno. That area is now largely divided between the 21st and 16th districts, while most of the current 20th was within the former 17th.
