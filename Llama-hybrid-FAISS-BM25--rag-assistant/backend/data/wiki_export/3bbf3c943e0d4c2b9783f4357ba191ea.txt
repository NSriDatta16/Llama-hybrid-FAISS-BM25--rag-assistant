Sequels
Sukiya was going to be a sequel of Maupiti Island and the adventures of Jérôme Lange started in Mortville Manor. The plot was to take place in Japan and was meant to feature a playing interface similar to Maupiti Island's. The game was supposed to be released in early 1993 but however, the game was never released due to financial difficulties within the company and low sales of their latest adventure game Black Sect. Sukiya was seemingly in an advanced stage when the decision to interrupt development was made. In 2019, a crowdfunding project tried to finance a remake but did not find sufficient financial support.
