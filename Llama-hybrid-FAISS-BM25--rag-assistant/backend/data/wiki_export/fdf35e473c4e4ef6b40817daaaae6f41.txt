Truxton Circle, sometimes known as East Shaw, is a neighborhood of Washington, D.C., located in Northwest D.C.

History

Truxton Circle is named for the former Thomas Truxtun traffic circle, which was constructed at the intersection of Florida Avenue and North Capitol Street around 1900. The circle was named after US Navy Commodore Thomas Truxtun. It was part of the Shaw School Urban Renewal Area, later known as the Shaw neighborhood.

A fountain was moved from the intersection of Pennsylvania Avenue and M Street NW to Truxton Circle in 1901.

A police officer conducted traffic at the traffic circle until a traffic light was installed in 1925.

Because the traffic circle was a site of traffic jams and accidents, it was demolished in 1947 at a cost of $500,000. The adjacent fountain was removed at the same time.

The neighborhood of Truxton Circle contains late 19th-century houses and historical schools, including Armstrong Manual Training School (where Duke Ellington graduated) and the original Dunbar High School, the first public high school for black students in the United States. Along with Armstrong, the former John Mercer Langston School, John Fox Slater Elementary School, and the Margaret Murray Washington School buildings are all listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
