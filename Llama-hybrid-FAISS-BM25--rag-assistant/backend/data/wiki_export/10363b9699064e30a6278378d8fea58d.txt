History

Calgary College opened the first Faculty of Law in Calgary in 1913. However, the college permanently disbanded at the outbreak of World War I in 1914 . The only law school in Alberta for the next 62 years was the Faculty of Law at the University of Alberta in Edmonton.

In 1971 an ad hoc committee with representation from the Bench and the Bar strongly recommended creating the Faculty of Law at the U of C.  In 1973, a government committee made the same recommendation to the Alberta Minister of Advanced Education.

Both the Calgary Bar and the City of Calgary sought ways to make significant financial contributions for the development of a law library. In September 1974, the Ministry of Advanced Education gave its final approval to the proposal for the establishment of the Faculty of Law.

The  Faculty of Law opened in 1976 with a first-year class of sixty students and nine faculty members. In 2017, the Faculty of Law launched its new five-year strategic plan, Energy-Innovation-Impact.

Deans

The first Dean of the Faculty of Law, John McLaren (U of C honorary degree recipient, 1997), started his five-year appointment in July 1975.  In September 1975, Professor Gail Starr was appointed as the Faculty's first librarian.

JD program
The Faculty of Law's Juris Doctor (JD) program is designed to prepare students for a variety of roles within the legal system.  The JD program may be completed in three years of full-time study or six years of part-time study.

The academic year is divided into three semesters:

 Fall semester: 13 weeks (3 + 10 for first-year students)
 January semester: 3 weeks
 Winter semester: 10 weeks (late January to March)

The program satisfies the requirements of the Law Societies of common law Canada for admission to the practice of law.

In 2015, the Faculty of Law launched its new Calgary Curriculum, designed to meet a changing legal marketplace.

Admissions for the JD program are based on a variety of factors include GPA, LSAT score (offered through the Law School Admission Council), and personal interest statement. Letters of reference are no longer needed to apply to the JD program as a first-year student, but are still required for other categories of applicants such as upper-year students.

LL.M program
The U of C Faculty of Law offers a thesis-based and a course-based LL.M program, and a Post-baccalaureate Certificate. These programs are focused on Natural Resources, Energy and Environmental Law.  The related topics within the focus area, including renewable energy law, water law, administrative law, adapting to climate change and regulating GHG emissions, regulatory theory, taxation, corporate law, economics, contract law, international trade and investment law, Aboriginal law, tort law, environmental ethics, pollution control, waste management, environmental impact law, intellectual property, human rights law and legal theory.

Graduate studies at the law school contribute to general academic research, produce legal scholarship, and develop specialized expertise in focus areas of the legal profession. With permission, graduate law students may also take graduate courses in outside faculties as part of the program.

A general thesis-based LL.M was introduced in 2017.

Admissions for the graduate law programs are granted on a competitive basis by the Faculty of Law in conjunction with the University of Calgary's Faculty of Graduate Studies. In addition to meeting the minimum requirements for the Faculty of Graduate Studies, the Faculty of Law requires a recognized first law degree with a minimum 3.0 average or upper-second class standing. Minimum standards alone are generally not sufficient for successful applicants to this school's' graduate program as the annual LL.M. admissions are capped at a small number, thereby further increasing selectivity.

Master of Science in Sustainable Energy Development 
The U of C’s Master of Science in Sustainable Energy Development (SEDV) is an interdisciplinary graduate program providing a balanced education related to energy and environmental management. A combined offering through the Haskayne School of Business, Schulich School of Engineering and the Faculties of Law and Environmental Design, SEDV is  designed for professionals and students who are seeking a broad-based and comprehensive education in sustainable energy.

International Energy Lawyers Program
In 2012, the Faculty of Law launched a joint degree program with the University of Houston Law Center - the International Energy Lawyers Program (IELP). The program allows students to earn both Canadian and American law degrees in just four years, and enables them to apply for admission to bars in both the US and Canada.
