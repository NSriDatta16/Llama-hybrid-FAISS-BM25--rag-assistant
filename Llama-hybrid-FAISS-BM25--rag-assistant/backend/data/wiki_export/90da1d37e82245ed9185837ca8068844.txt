The Singapore Symphony Chorus (SSC) is the performing choir of the Singapore Symphony Orchestra (SSO). The SSC performs solely with the SSO, presenting an average of three programmes a year.

The SSC's present chorus master is Eudenice Palaruan, who took over from Lim Yau. Most concerts are performed at Singapore's Esplanade Concert Hall and the Victoria Concert Hall.

The associated youth choirs are the Singapore Symphony Children's Choir (SSCC) and the Symphony Youth Choir (SSYC).
