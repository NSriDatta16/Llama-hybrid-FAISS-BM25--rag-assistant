History 
The first owner of the land now known as Castelar was Mateo Sanchez, who received a squared portion of land laid upon Moron Creek ―the zone previously known as Cañada de Ruiz― according to the orders of the governor Juan Ramirez de Velasco. Surprisingly, the limits of that land were almost double the size of the current city. In 1610 the land suffered its first change of owner, since Mateo Sanchez had sold it to captain Francisco Romero from Santa Cruz. The lot continued to be in the hands of Romero's descendants until 1673, the year that Sebastian de Gilles acquired it, which led to a slow fragmenting of the land.
