Lawra Municipal is one of the eleven districts in the Upper West Region of Ghana. Originally, it was formerly part of the then-larger Lawra District in 1988, until the northern part of the district was later split off to create Nandom District on June 28, 2012; thus, the remaining part has remained as Lawra District, which was later elevated to municipal assembly status on March 15, 2018 to become Lawra Municipal Assembly. The municipality is located in the northwest part of the Upper West Region and has Lawra as its capital town.
