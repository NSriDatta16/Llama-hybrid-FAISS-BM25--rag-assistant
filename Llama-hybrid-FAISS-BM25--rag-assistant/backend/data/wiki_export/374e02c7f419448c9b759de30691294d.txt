Fargo South High School, more commonly known as Fargo South , South High, or South is a public high school located in Fargo, North Dakota. The campus serves about 1,000 students in grades 9-12. The school is a part of the Fargo Public Schools system. The official school colors are brown and gold and the athletic teams are known as the Bruins.

History
Fargo South High School was built when the previous school, Fargo Central High School, burned down in 1966. Students from Central High finished the ‘66 school year at Fargo North High School and spent the 1966-67 school year at North High during the construction of a new school. The new facility in South Fargo became South High and the “Bruins” christened their new high school 
with the beginning of the ‘67-68 school year.

In 1999, the school completed a massive expansion and renovation project. Until 2011, Fargo South High School served the entire Fargo Public School district south of Main Avenue and once had a student population of over 2,000. Freshmen were served by Discovery Junior High School from 1994-2006 and then housed in the former Agassiz Middle School building (termed "South Campus II") from 2006 - 2011. Beginning with the 2011–2012 school year, the school population split with the new Fargo Davies High School.

Students 
The student-body in South High is very diverse with many students coming in from Nepal, Vietnam, and Several African countries.
