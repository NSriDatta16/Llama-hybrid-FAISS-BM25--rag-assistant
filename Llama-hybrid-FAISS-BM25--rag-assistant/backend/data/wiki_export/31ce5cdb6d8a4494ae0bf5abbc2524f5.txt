It's Only Right and Natural is the second album by the band The Frogs and was released in 1989 by Homestead Records. Gerard Cosloy, who was in charge of Homestead at the time, came into possession of some of the Flemion Brothers' improvised homemade tapes and signed them to the label. The Flemions were originally hoping that Homestead would release their debut album The Frogs, but Cosloy convinced them to release a gay-themed album instead. The album was recorded on 4-Track reel-to-reel in Dennis's living room and was originally meant to be for the Flemion brothers and their friends' own amusement, and was not originally considered for release.

Most of the songs on the album deal with stereotypes associated with homosexuality, especially negative ones used by social conservatives. The lyrics are highly satirical and portray stereotypes in an absurdly over-the-top manner. Shortly before the album's release, the Flemions went forward with a gay-themed live act, with Dennis wearing a trademark pink sailor suit. Audiences who knew the Frogs from their earlier material were often confused by this change of direction. The album has since become an underground classic. The album's cover depicts a very young Dennis Flemion wearing a gay pride button. The album was a frequent target of conservative Christians at the time of its release, and was featured in the video series "Hell's Bells: The Dangers of Rock 'N' Roll" (as chronicled on Toy Porno).

The band were chosen by Animal Collective to perform the album in its entirety at the All Tomorrow's Parties festival that they curated in May 2011.
