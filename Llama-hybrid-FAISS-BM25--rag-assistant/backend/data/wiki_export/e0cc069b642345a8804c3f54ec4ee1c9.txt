The Mansfield Hawks were an International Basketball Association (IBA) professional basketball team located in Mansfield, Ohio for one season, in 1998-99. The Hawks won the IBA championship in their lone season. They were guided by local, but infamous, coach Kevin Mackey. One of the Hawks' notable players was 7 ft 2 in, 315 pound center Garth Joseph, a dominating presence with a physical appearance resembling Shaquille O'Neal. The team played its home games in the gymnasium of Malabar Middle School.

Before the 1999â€“00 season, the team was relocated to Youngstown and became the Youngstown Hawks. In 2005, Mansfield was again targeted as the home for another possible professional basketball team.
