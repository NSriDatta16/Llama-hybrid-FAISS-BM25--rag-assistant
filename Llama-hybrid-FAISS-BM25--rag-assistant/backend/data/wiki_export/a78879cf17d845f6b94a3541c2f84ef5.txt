The Third Album is the third solo studio album by American singer Barbra Streisand, released in February 1964. By 1966, the album sold over one million copies worldwide.

Artwork 
The photograph on the album cover was taken by actor Roddy McDowall when Streisand was performing on The Judy Garland Show in October 1963.

Critical reception 

AllMusic gave the album a retrospective three (out of five) stars, and called it "another demonstration of the beauty of Barbra Streisand's voice, also suggested that her interpretive abilities remained limited."

Commercial performance 
After the success of Streisand's previous two albums, The Barbra Streisand Album and The Second Barbra Streisand Album, it was expected that The Third Album would do as well. The album turned out to be very successful; it reached #5 on Billboard's Pop Albums Chart and was certified Gold by the RIAA. It stayed on the Billboard 200 for 74 weeks.
