Arjen Gerald Teeuwissen (born March 29, 1971) is an equestrian from the Netherlands, who won the silver medal in the Team Dressage event at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. He did so alongside Anky van Grunsven, Ellen Bontje, and Coby van Baalen.

Teeuwissen was one of eight LGBT Olympians, who were also equestrians at the 2000 Olympic Games. At the medal ceremony of the team dressage, the three men of the twelve who were awarded medals were all gay men, Robert Dover and Guenter Seidel (both USA, bronze) and Teeuwissen.
