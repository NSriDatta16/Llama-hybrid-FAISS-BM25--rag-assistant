The University of the Assumption (U.A.) is a private archdiocesan Catholic university in the City of San Fernando, Pampanga, Philippines. The University of the Assumption is the first Catholic archdiocesan university in the Philippines and in Asia. It is among the top schools in the region, based on its accredited programs, and licensure and professional examination results.

History
U.A. was founded on January 12, 1963, when the bishop of San Fernando, Most Reverend Emilio A. Cinense, D.D., assisted by Msgr. Pedro D. Puno, the Vicar General, concretized his dream of providing Christian education to the poor young men and women of Pampanga.

Beginnings
The university was originally called Assumption Junior College and was on the third floor of the Assumpta Building in downtown San Fernando. The school was under the watchful eyes of Sr. Gunfrida Schneyer, O.S.B., who was at the time the Superior of the Community of Missionary Benedictine Sisters of Tutzing (Germany).

The college began with an enrollment of 275 students. The degrees offered were Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science in Commerce, Bachelor of Science in Education, and Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education.

In 1965 the campus was transferred to its present site at the Unisite Subdivision, in Barangay Del Pilar. The Puno Building was then the only edifice on the campus. In the same year, the institution was granted government recognition as "Assumption College of Pampanga".

In 1966, Rev. Fr. Aniceto M. Franco became the dean and rector Sr. Mary Philip Ryan, O.P. and the Dominican Sisters of Our Lady of Remedies assisted in the supervision of the grade school and high school. Sr. Mary Philip Ryan was also the superior of the Dominican community whose members performed active roles in the institution's affairs as faculty members and administrators.

In 1969, the Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering was added to the roster of degrees offered. To accommodate the increase in number of enrollees, the Ryan Building and Benedictine Building were constructed.  During the term of Fr. Franco the Archbishop Emilio Cinense Gymnasium was built.

In 1974, Rev. Fr. Octavio M. Ramos was appointed as the first president of the institution. Fr. Ramos worked for the government recognition of new degrees: Bachelor of Science in Nursing, Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics, Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering, and Bachelor of Science in Architecture. The Graduate School was organized with Master in Business Administration as its first program.

From college to university
The college was granted University status on March 29, 1980, by the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports and was named University of the Assumption.

Consequently, enrollment soared and the following buildings were built to accommodate the growing number of students:
The Nutrition building
The Grade School building, named after Rev. Msgr. Octavio  M. Ramos
The Msgr. Guerrero building which houses the University Chapel and the Archbishop Oscar V. Cruz Museum and Archives
The Multi-Purpose Hall
The Ryan Hall extension
The Puno Hall extension
The Alumni building
The Post Office
The Waiting Shed

Under Fr. Ramos, the university was chosen as a site for the Regional Staff Development Center, the Nutrition Center, the Decentralized Learning Resource Center, and the Educational Development Implementation Task Force for Region III. Under his term the Outreach Ministry was launched.

Further expansion
In 1986, Rev. Fr. Cenovio M. Lumanog, Ph.D. was appointed president of the university. On June 13, 1988 the Department of Education, Culture and Sports granted U.A. the recognition to offer a Doctorate degree in Education.

In 1990, the Most Rev. Jesus C. Galang, D.D., then the Auxiliary Bishop of San Fernando, was installed as the president. During his incumbency, the Archbishop V. Cruz building and the Library building (now Most Rev. Jesus C. Galang Building) were constructed. During his term the Bachelor of Science in Accountancy was added to the courses offerings.

Modernization
Rev. Msgr. Ricardo Jesus T. Serrano, S.L.D. assumed the role as university president in 1992. The following programs were added to the curriculum under his leadership: Master's degree in Public Administration; Bachelor of Science in Hotel and Restaurant Management; Bachelor of Science in Commerce with a major in computer science; and a Master of Education with majors in Early Childhood, Mathematics, Filipino and English.

In 1998, Mass Communication and Interior Design were added as among the majors in Liberal Arts. In the same year, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) granted the university the permission to convert AB major in Social Work to Bachelor of Science in Social Work.
Msgr. Serrano was responsible in implementing anti-lahar and anti-flood interventions. The Grade School building and the Archbishop Cinense Gymnasium underwent major renovations. It was expanded to include three wings: the Msgr. Lumanog Building, the Msgr. Ramos Building, and the Franco Building. To meet the needs of the growing student populace, rooms at the Archdiocese of San Fernando building (ASF) and the Diocese of San Fernando building (DSF) were occupied to house the computer laboratories, and modern typing, and lecture rooms. Modernization of the campus included two additional audio-visual rooms, an Internet Center, computer rooms, and multimedia classrooms.

A tennis court with a mini club house were added to enhance the sports and athletic facilities on campus. The newest buildings on campus are the Hotel and Restaurant Management building, presently known as the Domus Mariae International Center (the UA Hotel); and the new High School Building (Phases 1 and 2). Other enhancements include the UA Facade; the UA Radio Studio; the UA TV Studio, the Speech Laboratory and the Archbishop Aniceto Student Center Building.

In 2007, His Excellency Most Reverend Roberto C. Mallari, D.D., Auxiliary Bishop of San Fernando, Pampanga, was installed as the fifth president. He is ably assisted by Rev. Fr. Winifredo Santos who was later replaced by Dr. Mediatriz D. MArtin for Academic Affairs, Rev. Fr. Manuel Sta. Maria for Administration, and Rev. Fr. Deogracias Kerr S. Galang for Finance.

After serving the university for almost five years, Bishop Roberto Mallari, D.D. was appointed by Pope Benedict XVI to head the Diocese of San Jose in Nueva Ecija. Thus, on August 22, 2012, Rev. Fr. Joselito C. Henson, S.Th.D. was installed as the sixth president of the university.  
On May 28, 2013. Rev. Fr. Victor S. Nicdao and Mrs. Belina Katigbak were installed as VP for Administration and VP for Finance, respectively. They took over from Rev. Fr. Manuel C. Sta. Maria and Rev. Fr. Deogracias Kerr S. Galang.

Recently
At present, the university is offering new programs, namely, Bachelor of Science in Tourism Management, Bachelor of Science in Information Technology and Bachelor of Science in Electronics and Communications Engineering.

Aside from the new course offerings, the new administration has concluded its first Collective Bargaining Agreement with the union without hassles. Salaries of employees were adjusted to a level most acceptable to all parties.

With the convenience of the students as the main driving force, the Execom under the leadership of Bishop Bobet initiated the construction of the St. Thomas Aquinas Students Courtyard (STACY) which serves as the student center and the remodeling of the main entrance which is now called as the "Gates of Excellence".

Golden Jubilee
The university celebrated its 50th founding anniversary on January 13, 2013. In unity with the victims of the recent calamity, the administration decided to have a simple celebration starting with the launching of the year-long celebration on September 7, 2012. The highlight of the celebration was in January 2013 during the foundation week.

Accreditation
In the new millennia, the University of the Assumption became a member of the Philippine Association of Accredited Schools, Colleges and Universities (PAASCU). In 2002, the Liberal Arts, Education, Commerce, Accountancy and Nursing programs, as well as the Grade School and High School curricula, were granted Level 2 Accreditation.

The Graduate School was ranked among the top graduate education centers in the region based on the results of the Evaluation of Graduate Education in the Philippines (EGEP) jointly conducted by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) and the Fund for Assistance to Private Education (FAPE) from July 2003 to September 2004.

In August 2005, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) approved the university's application to offer Bachelor of Science in Biology (Pre-Med), and Bachelor of Science in Mathematics effective school year 2006-2007.
