Brennan joined Cumann na nGaedheal in 1932, but lost his seat at the 1932 general election. He was returned at the 1933 general election, and re-elected at the 1937 and 1938 general elections. He lost his seat at the 1943 general election, and stood again unsuccessfully as a Fine Gael candidate at the 1944 general election.

He stood as an independent candidate at the 1948 general election, and for Fine Gael at the 1951 general election, but was unsuccessful on both occasions.
