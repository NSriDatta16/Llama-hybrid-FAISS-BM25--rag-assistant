The Gris Gris were an American four-piece psychedelic rock band from Oakland, California via Houston, Texas originally.

History
The Gris Gris first signed with Birdman Records in 2003 after Garret Goddard of the band The Cuts, gave a burned CD of Greg Ashley's first solo record Medicine Fuck Dream to the owner of Birdman Records, David Katznelson. Birdman then published Ashley's solo album, Medicine Fuck Dream, in 2003 and Gris Gris' debut self-titled album the following year.

The band released three albums together to reasonably positive reviews.

Lead-singer Greg Ashley also released eight solo albums, Medicine Fuck Dream, Painted Garden, Requiem Mass and Other Experiments, Another Generation Of Slaves, Greg Ashley & The Western Playboys, Death Of A Ladies' Man, Pictures Of Saint Paul Street and, Fiction Is Non-Fiction.

Ashley also wrote a book entitled Anecdotes.
