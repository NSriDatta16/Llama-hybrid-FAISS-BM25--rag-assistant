They were not related. Walt Disney's actor Fess Parker noted in his Archive of American Television interview that  two actresses were named Crowley whom everyone was always mixing up, one tall (Pat) and one short (Kathleen), and that he was paired with the shorter Crowley for one project, despite being 6 feet 6 inches tall.

Crowley, a Republican, endorsed Dwight Eisenhower for re-election in the 1956 presidential election.
