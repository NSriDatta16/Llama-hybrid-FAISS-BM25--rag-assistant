History
Secondary education in Tauranga began in 1900, with the establishment of a district high school joined with Tauranga School. By the mid-1930s, the buildings were inadequate for use, and a push for a separate secondary school began. In 1937, the education board purchased the motor camp "Hillsdene", originally one of the  blocks laid out after the Battle of Gate Pā. However, World War II delayed building on the site until 1944. After two years of building, Tauranga College was opened on 5 February 1946. The college ran until 1958 – due to overcrowding, female students moved to a newly built campus, which was named Tauranga Girls' College. Male students remained in Tauranga College, which became known as Tauranga Boys' College.

The college seeks to honour the past in creating the future. This includes honours boards recognising top scholars and New Zealand representative sportsmen, the naming of buildings after former principals and assorted trees and memorials for World War II victims and students who died whilst enrolled.

The College is the holder of the NZSS Boys' First XI Football title, won with a 1-0 victory in the final in Napier on September 2, 2022.
