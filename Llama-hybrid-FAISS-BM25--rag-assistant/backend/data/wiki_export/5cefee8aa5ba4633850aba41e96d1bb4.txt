History
The area around Niedenstein has been settled in early years. Therefore, archeological excavations have found relics from the Neolithic area. Niedenstein Castle had its first documentary mentioned in 1254 as Konrad II. von Elben held the castle for Duchess Sophie von Brabant against the troops of archbishop Gerhard von Dhaun from Mainz. The castle had been pillaged and destroyed in 1387 by the troops of archbishop Adolf I. from Mainz. The castle had been rebuilt only partially and been given up and destroyed completely in 1631. There are no remains of the original castle left to be seen.

It was Konrad von Elben, ordered by Duchess Sophie, who had built the new city in 1259 on his own land in the area of Wichdorf. This newly founded settlement was called Niedenstein ("Nydensteyne").

In 1584, the city counted 87 households with approx. 400 inhabitants. In 1578 Duke Wilhelm IV. gave the right to hold market twice a year to Niedenstein.

The thirty-year war nearly brought total destruction to Niedenstein. In 1631, Croatian riding troops under general Tilly conquered the city, pillaged it and burned it down. More than a third of all buildings burned down and the castle was completely destroyed. At the end of the war in 1648, only four people were left, living in Niedenstein. 14 of the buildings were still standing.

In the short living Napoleonic kingdom of Westphalen (1807 - 1813), Niedenstein was the smallest city. The city experienced a very late growth in population. Until 1939, there were only 630 people living there, by the end of 2020 there were 5392 people living in Niedenestein.
