Punta Galea Challenge
During the 2014-5 World Surf League's (WSL) inaugural Big Wave World Tour (BWWT), the Punta Galea Challenge was one of the three possible northern hemisphere surfing locations.  The others were the Pe'ahi Challenge in Maui, Hawaii, and the Todos Santos Challenge near Ensenada, Mexico. 30-foot-and-larger waves were needed for the Northern Hemisphere window which ran from October 15, 2014, to February 28, 2015.  Punta Galea was the only Northern Hemisphere location to host a BWWT event that season with Nic Lamb, USA, winning the event and Makua Rothman, Hawaii, taking second place on December 11, 2014.  Perfect 10 rides were scored by Natxo Gonzalez in the first heat of the semifinals and by Nic Lamb in the finals.
