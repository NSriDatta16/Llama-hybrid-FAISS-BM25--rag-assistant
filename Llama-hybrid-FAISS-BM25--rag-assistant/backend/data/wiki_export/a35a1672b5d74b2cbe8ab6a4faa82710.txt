Fall of Saigon
On 30 April 1975, when South Vietnam collapsed to the advancing forces of North Vietnam and the Viet Cong, Lộc like other high-ranking government and military officials of the Saigon government that stayed behind were sent to re-education camp operated by the new Communist Vietnamese government. In an interview with the New York Times, Lộc describes in the re-education camps he and other inmates were forced to perform hard labor such as clearing the jungles, swamps, and minefields to building dams and farming. He mentions the conditions of the camps were so brutal that two or three people within the camps would die every week from malnutrition or illnesses 
In 1980, after spending five brutal years in the re-education camp, the Communist government decided to let Lộc return to Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City). Lộc explains, 

I nearly died in the labor camp, where I was kept with about 1,500 others on a near starvation diet, they let me return to Saigon in 1980 only after they felt that I was dying. 

Lộc attempted to leave Vietnam 14 times before successfully making it to Singapore in May 1983 as a refugee. He died in Yvelines, France in May 1992 at the age of 69.
