Midland Provincial Park is a provincial park located in Alberta, Canada.

Once the site of the Midland Coal Mine, it was designated as a provincial park on June 5, 1979. It now hosts the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology. The Midland Coal Mine was the site of a large mining disaster in the mid-1920s; many men died in a mine explosion.

It is located 6Â km west of Drumheller on Highway 838 (North Dinosaur Trail).

Activities in the park include canoeing, kayaking, fishing, wildlife viewing and hiking through willows and cottonwoods along the Red Deer River. Points of interest are fossil beds, a mine site and the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
