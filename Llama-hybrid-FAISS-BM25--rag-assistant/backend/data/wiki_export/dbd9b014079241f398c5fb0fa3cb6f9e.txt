Reception
Steve Faragher reviewed Superman/Doomsday â€“ Hunter/Prey for Arcane magazine, rating it a 4 out of 10 overall. Faragher comments that "writer Jurgens and artist Breeding do their best to inject some angst into the well-chronicled cape-wearer's philosophy, but they're up against a wall of steel and their well-intentioned attempts fail to add anything new to the myth of Superman".
