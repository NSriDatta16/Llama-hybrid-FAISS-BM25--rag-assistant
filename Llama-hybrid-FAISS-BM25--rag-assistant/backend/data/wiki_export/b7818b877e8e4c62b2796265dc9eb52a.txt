Sandia High School (SHS) is a Public High School located in the northeast heights of Albuquerque, New Mexico. It is a member of the Albuquerque Public Schools district. The current enrollment is 1,776.



History
The school opened in 1958 and was originally constructed to hold between 1,800-2,000 students at a cost of $1.3 million dollars. The smaller Yucca school, located east of the main building, was completed in 1959 to house elementary students. The Yucca school was phased out as an elementary school in 1974 due to low enrollment, and was used as an annex to Sandia. 

The originally proposed mascot name was the Sandia Satans, which prompted negative reactions from the community.  Thereafter, the mascot name was changed to Matadors, after a vote which included Thunderbirds and Road Runners.  A Matador sculpture was placed in the student commons area in 1979.

In the late 1970s, the school reached a record student population for the state of New Mexico.
This led to the approval and construction of a newer facility, La Cueva High School, in the early 1980s. 

As of 2013, Sandia High School is home to the International Baccalaureate program. 

Sandia's current principal is Camille Gonzales as of September 2021.

Athletics 
The first athletic win in school history was a 26-0 football victory over Espa√±ola Valley High School on September 20, 1958. At this time, Sandia still had the Satan as the mascot. It was a week later that Sandia officially changed the mascot to the Matador.

SHS competes in the New Mexico Activities Association (NMAA). For 2022/2023-2023/2024, the NMAA realigned the state's districts and classifications. Sandia competes in 5A in every sport except football. Football is still a 6A classification.
