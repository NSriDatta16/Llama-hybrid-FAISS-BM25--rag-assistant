In 2005, he started the season playing with Ak Bars Kazan of the Russian Superleague (RSL), but left after playing only eight games. He was then re-signed by the Islanders and sent back to the Sound Tigers.  Jeff scored his first NHL goal on December 17, 2005 against David Aebischer and the Colorado Avalanche during an Islanders 5-4 win.  It was his second career game.
