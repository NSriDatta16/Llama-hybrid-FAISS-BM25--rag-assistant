Gut is a German grindcore band, often credited as the "fathers of pornogrind". The group was founded in 1991 and is known for their over-the-top vocals and morbid, pornographic imagery. The band is also noted for its members performing in masked outfits, which became something of a staple in the pornogrind genre thereafter.

On Gut's 2006 release, The Cumback 2006, the band began combining grindcore with elements of hip hop, hardcore punk, and electronic music. In 2020, after a long period of inactivity, Gut returned once again with a third album Disciples of Smut released on Splatter Zombie Records.
