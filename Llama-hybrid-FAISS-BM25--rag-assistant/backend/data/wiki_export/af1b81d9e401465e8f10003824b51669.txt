The , or belt race, is a traditional sport often played during the patronal festival in Spain and Latin America.  In the , short belts with loops on one end are hung from a wire suspended between two posts.  Contestants, who may be on either horses or bicycles, ride towards the wire and attempt to capture a belt by putting a peg through the loop.
