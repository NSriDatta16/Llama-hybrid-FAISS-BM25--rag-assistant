Amaro is well known and rich by yearly overflowing rivers.  Bewaye, Sarmale (Segen), Duano, Kondilcho are some of them. with the time now, due to the number of the people are increasing in alarming rate and the societies facing many challenges that arise from mal-administration from so-called segen zone, peoples are demanding the demolition of the zone and strongly claiming the assurance of their own right to self-administration under the status of independent Amaro Koore zone.
