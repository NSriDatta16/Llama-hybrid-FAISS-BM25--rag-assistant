Most Faithful Majesty () was the title used by the Portuguese monarchs, from 1748 to 1910.

The sobriquet Most Faithful King (, ) was a title awarded by the Pope Benedict XIV – as spiritual head of the Catholic Church – in 1748, to the King John V of Portugal and to his heirs.

The title  remains attached to monarchs descended from whoever received the original sobriquet. The sobriquet can be awarded to either a king or a queen. The only European monarchy that has received the sobriquet was the now-defunct monarchy of Portugal.
