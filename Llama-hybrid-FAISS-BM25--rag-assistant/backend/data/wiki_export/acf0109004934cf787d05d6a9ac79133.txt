The Jenny Jones Show is an American first-run syndicated talk show hosted by television presenter Jenny Jones. Taped in Chicago, Illinois, the show ran for twelve seasons from September 16, 1991, to May 21, 2003. The show's first season followed a traditional talk show format, in which it focused on celebrity interviews and lifestyle segments. After it received mild ratings, the show shifted to a new format for its second season; it centered on everyday people who shared their own personal stories. The show typically featured a discussion among a panel of guests who had varying experiences and viewpoints over the episode's pertinent topic. The discussions were moderated by Jones, who gave members of the studio audience an opportunity to ask questions and give advice to the guests. In addition to these discussions, The Jenny Jones Show frequently featured live musical performances from artists of various genres.

The Jenny Jones Show was conceived as an alternative to the sensational tabloid talk shows of the early nineties. It was produced by Telepictures Productions and distributed by Warner Bros. Television Studios. A former stand-up comedian, Jones was approached by Warner Bros. Television Studios with an offer to host a talk show after producers watched her "Girl's Night Out" comedy show. The show debuted on 178 television stations nationwide, which was the largest launch in syndicated talk show history. The Jenny Jones Show was one of the highest-rated talk shows of the nineties. It received the Excellence in Mediaâ€™s Silver Angel Award and two SHINE Awards. However, the show also received criticism from media commentators and audiences over claims that it exploited its guests. Common topics discussed on the show included makeovers and out-of-control teenagers.

In 1995, The Jenny Jones Show experienced controversy after a former guest murdered another three days after they were featured in a taping of the show. Titled "Revealing Same Sex Secret Crush", the episode depicted self-proclaimed secret admirers revealing their crushes to guests. Jones was required to testify at the ensuing criminal trial, which received wide coverage by the news media. In 1996, the victim's family filed a negligence lawsuit against The Jenny Jones Show. The litigation resulted in a national media frenzy, with criticism directed at the use of "ambush" tactics by tabloid talk shows. It additionally resulted in a national debate over shock value and tabloid television in the United States. The Jenny Jones Show ultimately prevailed in the suit, in which the court held that the guest's actions following their appearance on the program were unforeseeable.

Format
The Jenny Jones Show premiered in September 1991, in which it debuted on 178 television stations nationwide; this debut was the biggest launch in syndicated talk show history.

When the series began, a traditional talk show format reminiscent of Oprah was used. However, ratings were low during the first two seasons, and by 1993 it began to move away from serious subjects and began to take on more unusual subjects and theme shows such as paternity tests, out-of-control teens (including shows in which they are sent to boot camp), confronting former bullies (something Jones dealt with when she was young), makeovers for people who had no sense of fashion or style, celebrity impersonators, talent contests (and at times, people who made it an obsession to enter them, especially parents of the children who enter the pageants/contests/shows), feuding neighbors, strippers and secret crushes. The show is noted for its eclectic and controversial episodes, including "I Don't Want My Daughter to Date Interracially", "I Hate My Own Race", "My Teen's Too Hot", and "Teen By Day, Vampire By Night".

The show would also feature regular live performances by bands of varying genres (notably pop, punk, rock, hip-hop, and R&B), ranging from lesser known bands from the local Chicago area to more well known bands from around the U.S. and Canada. Many well-known artists first appeared on Jenny Jones including Usher, Ludacris, Tamar Braxton, Nelly, Lil Wayne and Three Six Mafia, who made their first national TV appearance on the show. The final live performance of alternative rock band Dinosaur Jr. before their initial 1997 disbandment was a performance of "Out There" on the show earlier that year.

Cast of characters
The show also had an in-house cast of regulars, some of whom were originally guests:

 Rude Jude, a DJ who became a fan favorite for his appearance on his past being a bully. He made frequent appearances as an advisor.
 Raymond Moses, a drill sergeant for troubled young children recognized for his intimidating presence and booming voice. According to his brother, Moses closed his boot camp business in 2013, ten years after the show ended.
 Tornado "Big Daddy WooWoo" (Comedian)
 Chela Thomas
 Valerie Mikita
CJ Belle, fetish model, performance artist

Production

Jones was approached by Warner Bros. Television Studios about a talk show after producers watched her Girl's Night Out comedy show. Jones was excited about the prospect of a talk show, in which she commented: "I've always considered myself a talk show junkie. All my car buttons are on talk radio stations. I always wanted to do a talk show, but I just figured no one would let me have one." The Jenny Jones Show was conceived as an alternative to the "harder-edged" tabloid talk shows that aired at the time. The first two seasons focused on human-interest stories, including sex, divorce, and dieting. Jones wanted the show's atmosphere to be an extension of her Girl's Night Out comedy routine.

By its final two seasons, the show had dropped heavily in the ratings. It was nearly cancelled at the conclusion of season 11, but was saved by a last-minute deal with the Tribune Broadcasting station group, although the subsequent station shuffle necessitated in such key markets as New York City, Chicago and Los Angeles didn't help the ratings erosion.

In the 2002-2003 TV season, Jones' program became the lowest-rated daytime talk show , and after the last episode aired that spring, Jenny Jones was canceled in the summer of 2003. Reruns continued to air until September 12 of that year.

Reception
Howard Rosenberg of the Los Angeles Times praised the show as the best new daytime talk program of 1991. He commented: "There is no one funnier or fresher in daytime [than Jones]."

The Jenny Jones Show won three Excellence in Media Awards.

Litigation
On March 6, 1995, The Jenny Jones Show taped an episode titled "Revealing Same Sex Secret Crush", in which a group of guests were invited to meet their self-proclaimed secret admirers. Three days after the episode was taped, one of the guests, Jonathan Schmitz, killed his secret admirer, Scott Amedure. The episode was shelved and Schmitz was charged with first-degree murder.

In August 1995, Amedure's family filed a civil lawsuit against The Jenny Jones Show, Warner Bros., and Telepictures Productions.
