The Red Hot Chili Peppers released their first three studio albums—1984's The Red Hot Chili Peppers, 1985's Freaky Styley, and 1987's The Uplift Mofo Party Plan—to virtually no commercial success during the mid to late 1980s.  However, after future success with fans visiting their early work, The Uplift Mofo Party Plan would eventually become their earliest album to be certified by the RIAA by going Gold.  It was the only album to feature all 4 founding members and featured the single 'Fight Like A Brave'. Hillel Slovak died and Jack Irons departed.  They were eventually replaced by John Frusciante and Chad Smith. 

It was not until their fourth studio album, 1989's Mother's Milk, that the band received critical attention when the album peaked at no.52 on the Billboard 200.  It became their first album to go Gold and would eventually go onto reach Platinum status.  'Knock Me Down' would be the first single and it became their first ever entry on the Alternative Rock Songs chart reaching no.6.  The follow-up single was a cover of Stevie Wonder's 'Higher Ground' it only managed to peak at no.11 on the Alternative Rock Songs chart but was the song that started to get Chili Peppers more attention.  'Taste the Pain' was also released as a single.  Although not on Mother's Milk but recorded around the same time and featured on the 'Pretty Women' soundtrack,  the Chili Peppers released the single 'Show Me Your Soul' which reached no.10.

 After releasing their fifth studio album Blood Sugar Sex Magik in September 1991, the Red Hot Chili Peppers broke into the mainstream. They had switched their record label from EMI to Warner Brothers and now had producer Rick Rubin on board.  The first single 'Give It Away' became a big success and gave them their first no.1 on the Alternative Rock Charts and went Platinum.   But it was the second single "Under the Bridge" which made them household names.  Although it only reached no.6 on the Alternative Rock Charts it peaked at no.2 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and has gone 6xPlatinum.  Other singles released were 'Suck  My Kiss'  reaching no.15 and going Gold and 'Breaking the Girl' reaching no.19 and also going Gold.  The album went on to reach 7xPlatinum in the United States reaching no.3 on the Billboard 200 album chart and gave them a no.1 album in Canada, Australia and New Zealand.  BSSM became a foundation for alternative rock in the 1990s. Guitarist John Frusciante quit the band shortly thereafter in 1992 and was replaced by Arik Marshall who was fired in 1993 being briefly replaced by Jesse Tobias before he too departed.  Recorded in the Blood Sugar Sex  Magik sessions but didn't appear on the album, the Chili Peppers released 'Soul To Squeeze' from the 'Coneheads' soundtrack.  The single reached no.1 on the Alternative Rock Charts.

They promoted it with the single 'Behind The Sun' a track from 1987s Uplift Mofo Party Plan album.  It reached no.7 on the Alternative Rock Charts.  The album reached no.22 on the Billboard 200 and went Platinum.

The Chili Peppers search for a new guitarist ended when they recruited Dave Navarro from fellow L.A. Alternative band Jane's Addiction.   The Chili Peppers would release their sixth studio album, One Hot Minute, in September 1995.  The album was a sizable hit, peaking at no.4 on the US Billboard 200 and going 2xPlatinum.

Although it was popular it failed to match the success of its predecessor Blood Sugar Sex Magik.  In 1997 the Chili Peppers released the single 'Love Rollercoaster' from the Beavis and Butthead Do America' soundtrack, reaching no.14.  Navarro was fired in 1998 as the band was starting to work on their follow-up to One Hot Minute.
