The Berks & Bucks FA County Senior Cup is the Senior County Cup competition of the Berks & Bucks FA, which first took place in 1878–79 – a time when the FA Cup had only been going for seven years, there was no Football League, and most countries in the world did not have any football competitions at all.

Originally known as the Berks & Bucks Challenge Cup, the competition started in the first season of the Association's existence. Reading was the inaugural winner, defeating Marlow 1–0 in the final held at the Reading Cricket Ground.

The competition mainly consists of non-league teams. However, Wycombe Wanderers, Milton Keynes Dons and Reading are three Football League teams who have recently competed, often fielding reserve and youth team players. With 29 wins, Wycombe is the most successful club in the competition. The Chairboys have also finished as runners-up more times (24) than any other club.

In 2023, Bracknell Town defeated Marlow 1–0 in the final at the Racecourse Ground, Ascot, becoming the 28th different club to claim the trophy.
