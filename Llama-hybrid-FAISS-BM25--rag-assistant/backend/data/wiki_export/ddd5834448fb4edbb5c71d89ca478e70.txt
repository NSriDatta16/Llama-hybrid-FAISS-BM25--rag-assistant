Deputy of the State Duma

Election

In December 2011, Arshinova, as a representative of the All-Russian Popular Front, ran for the Duma on the lists of United Russia from the Penza Oblast, but to no avail.

On 28 March 2012, the Central Election Commission, having considered the decision of the Presidium of the General Council of United Russia, transferred the mandate of the deputy of the State Duma of Russia of the sixth convocation from Chuvashia, which became vacant due to the appointment of Konstantin Kosachev to the post of head of Rossotrudnichestvo, to Arshinova.

On 17 April 2012, Arshinova visited Chuvashia for the first time, from which she became a deputy of the State Duma. The region's opposition reacted negatively to the mandate transfer to Arshinova. The head of the Communist Party faction in the State Council of Chuvashia, Dmitry Yevseyev, called the loss of the United Russia mandate a "shame" for the republic. He was supported by the leader of the regional branch of the party Patriots of Russia, Vladislav Soldatov. As deputy of the State Duma of the Russian Federation from Chuvashia, Arshinova spoke about the benefits of the voluntary study of the Chuvash language and, simultaneously, against being forced to do so in the schools of Chuvashia.

Activity
On 16 May 2012, Arshinova was appointed Deputy Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Education.

Letter against Anatoly Karpov
On 21 January 2013, it became known that nine United Russia members (including Alena Arshinova and Frants Klintsevich) wrote a letter to the Ministry of Justice with a request to check the Peace and Harmony Foundation, founded by the International Association of Peace Foundations, chaired by their colleague from the United Russia party Anatoly Karpov. The signatories wanted the ministry to determine if the foundation was a "foreign agent." Arshinova said, "We want to know the answer – does it receive funding from abroad and does it participate in the political life of the country?"

The letter followed after Anatoly Karpov proposed to exclude from the "anti-tobacco law" the article "Prevention of illegal trade in tobacco products and tobacco products includes ...", which, in particular, provides for control over the production of cigarettes. Karpov himself explained his proposal by the fact that such an article is already provided for by international law.
