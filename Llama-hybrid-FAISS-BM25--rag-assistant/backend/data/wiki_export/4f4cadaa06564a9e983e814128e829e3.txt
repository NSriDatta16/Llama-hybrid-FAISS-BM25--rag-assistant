Background and release
"When You're Gone" was written by Bryan Adams and Eliot Kennedy during production of the former's eighth studio album On a Day Like Today (1998). Adams initially sought American musician Sheryl Crow to perform the song as a duet, but did not receive a response from her. He unexpectedly encountered Melanie C inside a hotel elevator in Los Angeles, where he asked her to appear on "When You're Gone". Adams first met Melanie C on British music chart television show Top of the Pops (TOTP), during the Spice Girls' performance of their 1996 song "Wannabe". The song was recorded at the Warehouse Studio in Vancouver, Canada, from June to August 1998, with Adams and Bob Rock handling production. Kennedy recorded Melanie C's vocals and sent them to the  Canadian studio where Adams worked from, to be inserted into the song.

"When You're Gone" was first released on radio airplay in Europe before being distributed as a single on November 30, 1998. The following month, on December 23, a CD single was issued in Japan. In the United States, A&M Records serviced the song to contemporary hit radio on March 2, 1999. "When You're Gone" is Melanie C's debut single since becoming the first member of the Spice Girls to begin a solo career, and is Adams' second single from On a Day Like Today. In 2005, Adams recorded a duet of "When You're Gone" with Canadian-American actress Pamela Anderson for his compilation album titled Anthology (2005). He phoned Anderson five times to convince her to record the song, as the latter initially thought she was being Punk'd. In July 2022, Adams and Melanie C released a new version of "When You're Gone" from Classic Pt II, the former's album containing re-recorded songs.

Dave Simpson of The Guardian wrote that "When You're Gone" is Adams' best written song, while NME writer Alexandra Haddow opined in a 2021 article that it is "one of the best pop songs of the last twenty years". JC Villamere of Entertainment Tonight Canada regarded the song to be an "absolute banger", and the Daily Record stated that it is a "catchy tune". Writing for Billboard, Chuck Taylor praised the natural melody, radiant hook, and infectious energy of the song, which he compared to Adams' 1985 song "Summer of '69", but critiqued that Melanie C's "rousing background vocals" is a gimmick to give the song exposure in the United Kingdom. However, Sam Taylor of The Observer considered the song to be "jarring" and described Melanie C's vocals as "wailing atonally". Writing about the rendition performed by Adams and Anderson, Keith Caulfield of Billboard criticized the latter's "featherweight background vocals", which were buried in the song and considered "novelty" for radio stations.
