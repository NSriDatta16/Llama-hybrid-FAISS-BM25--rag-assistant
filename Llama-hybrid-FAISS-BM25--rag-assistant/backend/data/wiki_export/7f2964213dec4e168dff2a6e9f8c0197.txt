Karin Evers-Meyer (born 10 September 1949) is a German politician of the Social Democratic Party (SPD).

Political career 
A former journalist and author, Evers-Meyer was first elected member of the German Bundestag in the 2002 federal elections.

Between 2005 and 2009, Evers-Meyer – herself a mother of a child with disabilities – served as the Federal Government Commissioner for Matters relating to Disabled Persons (at the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs) in the second cabinet of Chancellor Angela Merkel. Ahead of the 2009 elections, German foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier included her in his shadow cabinet of 10 women and eight men for the Social Democrats' campaign to unseat Merkel as chancellor.

Following the 2009 federal elections, Evers-Meyer was appointed the SPD parliamentary group's deputy spokesperson on defense policy. A member of the Budget Committee since the 2013 elections, she served as the group's rapporteur on the budget of the Federal Ministry of Defense (BMVg). In addition, she was a member of the German delegation to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, led by Karl A. Lamers.

In the negotiations to form a coalition government following the 2013 federal elections, Evers-Meyer was part of the SPD delegation in the working group on foreign affairs, defense policy and development cooperation, led by Thomas de Maizière and Frank-Walter Steinmeier.

In late 2014, Evers-Meyer was considered as successor of  as Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces but withdrew her candidacy when Hans-Peter Bartels emerged as her parliamentary group's nominee; she would have been the first woman to hold that office.

In July 2016, Evers-Meyer announced that she would not stand in the 2017 federal elections but instead resign from active politics by the end of the parliamentary term.
