History
Before a school was built in the Kern River Valley, students were bussed to Bakersfield where they stayed in dormitories during the week, and returned home on the week-ends. Kernville High School opened its doors to 20 students in 1941. In 1951 when the Lake Isabella Dam was constructed and the resulting reservoir would have covered the school, it was moved to the town of Lake Isabella and renamed Kern Valley High School. As the student population continued to grow, additional classrooms and a gymnasium were constructed. A new school cafeteria was added, an industrial arts complex was constructed, and permanent "portable" classrooms were installed. The school was named a California Distinguished school in 2006â€“2007 school year.
