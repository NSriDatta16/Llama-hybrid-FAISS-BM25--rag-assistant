Liberal Democrat Councillor 

Kennedy now lives in Somerset where he was elected as a Liberal Democrat District Councillor in July 2010 for the Shepton West Ward of Mendip District Council.. The vacancy arose due to the non-attendance of a Conservative Party councillor, who was removed from office.  Kennedy's election removed the Conservatives majority on Mendip Council.
