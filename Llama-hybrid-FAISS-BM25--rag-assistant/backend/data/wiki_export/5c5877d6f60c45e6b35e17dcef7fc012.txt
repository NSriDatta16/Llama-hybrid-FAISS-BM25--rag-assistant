Background
New York is one of the most successful states at Miss USA, and is ranked third in terms of number and value of placement across all years of competition. New York's strongest run was an unbroken string of placements from 1957 to 1966. New York also had a streak of 3 consecutive 1st runner-up placements from 1972 to 1974. In 1954, Karin Huitman was 2nd runner-up. She later moved up to be 1st runner-up, as the original 1st runner-up, Miss Virginia USA was dethroned due to underage (she was 16). As there was no rule in 1954 that if Miss USA won Miss Universe, first runner-up became Miss USA, Karin was only 1st runner-up. Huitman went on to become Miss World USA 1954 and 1st runner-up at Miss World 1954.

New York has the third (equal) highest number of Miss USA victories. They also have the third highest number of semi-finalist (or better) placings (33).

Four Miss New York USAs have competed at Miss Teen USA, including one who went on to win the Miss USA crown: Kimberly Pressler and the other inherited the Miss USA title: Shanna Moakler. Of these, only three held the title Miss New York Teen USA; one represented Rhode Island (Moakler) and one New Hampshire (Maureen Murray).  Only one Miss New York USA has competed at Miss America.
