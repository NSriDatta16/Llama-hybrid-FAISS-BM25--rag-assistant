Brass Monkey is a 1948 British comedy thriller with musical asides, directed by Thornton Freeland. It stars Carroll Levis, a radio variety show host and talent scout (known as "Britain's favourite Canadian") and American actress Carole Landis in her last film. Also known as The Lucky Mascot, the film features an early appearance by comic actor Terry-Thomas, playing himself.

Though made in 1948, Brass Monkey wasn't released in the US until 1951.

Plot
Popular radio presenter Carroll Levis (playing himself), and Kay Sheldon (Carole Landis) find themselves entangled in a web of smuggling and murder. When a priceless "brass monkey" is stolen from a Japanese temple and smuggled into England, Levis encounters the eccentric Mr. Ryder-Harris (Ernest Thesiger), a Buddhist art connoisseur who's chasing the artefact, and will apparently stop at nothing to get it. The monkey is missing and suspicious murders are being committed in the hunt for its retrieval. With the help of the Discoveries radio talent, Levis attempts to avoid murderous henchman Herbert Lom, and foil Mr. Ryder-Harris's plans. Amongst all the mayhem, an array of musical and comedy performers audition for and appear on The Levis Hour, the hero's weekly radio programme.

Critical reception
 Time Out called the film a "ramshackle support feature", and concluded it was "a curio, but not really a collectible."
In a contemporary review, The Geraldton Guardian called The Brass Monkey, a "well told story."
 Sky Movies wrote, "a rough (very rough) and tumble British comedy-thriller spun round the then popular shows featuring Carroll Levis. ... Not much as a film ... But of undoubted interest for its extraordinary cast."
