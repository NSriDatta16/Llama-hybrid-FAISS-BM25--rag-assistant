Route 105 is a north-south highway in Quebec, Canada. It runs from Hull (now part of Gatineau), where it is known as Boulevard Saint-Joseph (until the limits with Chelsea), to Grand-Remous where it ends at Route 117.

Route 105 runs mostly in the Gatineau River valley, where it is characterized by twisty and hilly sections. Besides Hull, the only other significant town along the route is Maniwaki.

Originally part of the former Route 11, it was renumbered to 105 in the 1970s, and runs parallel to Autoroute 5 in the Gatineau area.
