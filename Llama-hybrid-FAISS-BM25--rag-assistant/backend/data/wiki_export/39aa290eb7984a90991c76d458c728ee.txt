Career

Elbagir began her journalism career with Reuters in December 2002 reporting for them from Sudan, covering the simmering conflict in the country's Darfur region. She moved into broadcast journalism in 2005 joining the launch of More4 News, where her exclusives included exposing rape allegations against the African Union in Darfur, gaining the first interview with the Aegis security company whistleblower on the Iraq "Trophy Videos", interviewing Jacob Zuma in the run-up to his 2006 rape trial and reported from Mogadishu during the US bombing of Somalia in January 2007 

In her first documentary with Unreported World "Meet the Janjaweed" she gained access to Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, aka "Hemeti", one of the main Arab Janjaweed Commanders at the heart of the fighting in Darfur. Elbagir and her director Andrew Carter filmed the fighters' Sudanese Army ID cards and Chinese manufactured weaponry - broadcasting the first documentary evidence* of the Sudanese government's direct involvement with the Janjaweed and the role China's arms sales to Darfur are playing in the conflict.

(*The BBC's Newsnight broadcast the first Janjaweed admission of Sudanese Government involvement - an interview with a defector on 17 October 2006 . The defector in that instance did not offer Sudanese Army ID however.)
