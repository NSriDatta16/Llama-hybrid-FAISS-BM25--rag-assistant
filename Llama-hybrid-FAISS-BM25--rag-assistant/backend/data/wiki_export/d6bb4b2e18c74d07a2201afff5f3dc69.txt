History 

ILAM was founded by ethnomusicologist Hugh Tracey in 1954, made possible through grants received from the Nuffield Foundation and the South African Department of Education.

ILAM published the African Music Society Journal, now known as the African Music. ILAM was initially located in Msaho (near Roodepoort, Gauteng). When Hugh Tracey died in 1977, his son Andrew took over as director.  Private funding had dried up, but Rhodes University agreed to host ILAM, and both ILAM and AMI moved to Grahamstown in 1978.
Andrew Tracey served as director until 2005, after which Diane Thram served as the director. The current director is Dr. Lee Watkins.
