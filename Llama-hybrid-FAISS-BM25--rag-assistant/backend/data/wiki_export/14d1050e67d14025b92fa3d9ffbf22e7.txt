The local trains are run by TER Hauts-de-France which covers the region. The station is served by regional trains to Calais, Boulogne, Arras, Amiens and Lille.

Eurostar
Calais-Fréthun is the first station on the continental side of the Eurostar route and passengers can alight here to connect onto the SNCF or LGV Nord services.  three services a day called in each direction travelling between London and Brussels via Lille-Europe. However, these were suspended in 2020 as a result of the Coronavirus pandemic, and as of Summer 2023 there is as yet no date for their resumption.

After the 'Additional Protocol to the Sangatte Protocol' was signed by France and the United Kingdom on 29 May 2000, juxtaposed controls were set up in the station. Eurostar passengers travelling to the UK clear exit checks from the Schengen Area (carried out by the French Border Police) as well as UK entry checks (conducted by the UK Border Force) in the station before boarding their train.
