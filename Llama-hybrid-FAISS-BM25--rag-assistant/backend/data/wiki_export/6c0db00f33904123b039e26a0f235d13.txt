Early life and education
Lewis was born in 1936 in Little Rock, Arkansas to a middle-class African-American family. His father John Henry Lewis Sr. graduated from Morris Brown College in Atlanta, and Yale Divinity School, becoming its first African-American graduate. Lewis Sr. also earned an M.A. in sociology from the University of Chicago and became principal of Dunbar Junior and Senior High School and Junior College in Little Rock and President of Morris Brown College from 1920 to 1928 and again from 1951 to 1958.  Lewis' mother, Alice U. Bell Lewis, taught high school math.

While the family lived in Little Rock, David Lewis attended parochial school and attended Wilberforce Preparatory School and Xenia High School after his father became Dean of the Theological School at Wilberforce University in Wilberforce, Ohio.

The family moved to Atlanta after his father became President of Morris Brown College and Lewis attended Booker T. Washington High School in his junior year. He gained early admission at age fifteen to Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee and  graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1956.

Lewis briefly attended the University of Michigan Law School but left to attend Columbia University, where he earned his M.A. in history in 1959. He went to the London School of Economics for his doctorate, earning his Ph.D. in 1962 in modern European and French history.

In 1961â€“1962, Lewis served in the United States Army as a psychiatric technician and private first class in Landstuhl, Germany.

After returning to the United States, Lewis taught at Morgan State University, the University of Notre Dame, Howard University, and the University of the District of Columbia from 1970 to 1980 as associate and full professor. Lewis was professor of history at University of California at San Diego from 1980 to 1984.

In 1985, Lewis joined Rutgers University as the Martin Luther King Jr. Professor of History, where he wrote his Pulitzer Prize-winning two volume-biography of W. E. B. Du Bois and finished writing The Race to Fashoda: European Colonialism and African Resistance in the Scramble for Africa during his 18-year tenure.

In spring semester 2001, Lewis served as distinguished visiting professor in Harvard's history department.

His Prisoners of Honor: The Dreyfus Affair was published in 1974; The Bicentennial History of the District of Columbia was published in 1976; and When Harlem Was in Vogue in 1980. Lewis wrote his Pulitzer Prize-winning two volume-biography of W. E. B. Du Bois during his 18-year tenure at Rutgers.

In addition to the two Pulitzer Prizes for his volumes on W. E. B. Du Bois, published in 1994 and 2001, Lewis won the Bancroft Prize and the Francis Parkman Prize in 1994 for his first volume. In 2001 he won the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award for his second volume on Du Bois, published that year.

He is a former trustee of the National Humanities Center, former commissioner of the National Portrait Gallery, and a former senator of Phi Beta Kappa.
