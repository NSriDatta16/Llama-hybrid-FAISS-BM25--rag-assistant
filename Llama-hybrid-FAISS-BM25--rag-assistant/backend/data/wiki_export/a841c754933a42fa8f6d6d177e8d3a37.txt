The Eula Independent School District is located at the intersection of Farm to Market Road 603 and County Road 244.  The boundaries of the school reach west to the Abilene city limits, east to FM 604, south to the Dudley Hwy, and North to FM 351. The original school building burnt to the ground in 1943, and was rebuilt at the same location. In 1976 a new elementary wing was added, and in 1993 a Middle school wing was added. In 2000 the School opened the doors to a new state-of-the-art facility that would house Eula High School. Currently this building is the home of 7-12 grades. The Eula Pirates have made an appearance at the State Cross Country meet since 1997, placing as high as 2nd.
