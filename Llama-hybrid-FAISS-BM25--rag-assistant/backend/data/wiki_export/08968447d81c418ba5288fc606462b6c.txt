Geography

Sezimovo Ústí is urbanistically fused with the neighbouring towns Tábor in the north and Planá nad Lužnicí in the south. It is located about  north of České Budějovice and  south of Prague.

Sezimovo Ústí lies in the Tábor Uplands. It is situated at the confluence of the Lužnice river (which makes the border of the municipal territory) and Chotovinský Stream (also called Kozský in the length where it flows through the town). One of the tributaries of the Chotovinský Stream supplies a fish pond called Jezero.

History

According to legend, Sezimovo Ústí was founded by Sezima, an illegitimate son of Witiko of Prčice. The town was established in the first half of the 13th century. The first mention of Ústí is from 1250, when the general chapter of the Dominican Order agreed to the consecration of the monastery church to Saint Dominic. The town prospered, which resulted from a convenient place on the way from Austria to Prague. Only six years after the church was consecrated, the monastery was expanded so the town must have already be prosperous enough to allow investment like that. The town was later fortified and had three suburbs, one of them on the other bank of the Lužnice river. From 1388, the independent parish church had its own hospital and school.

In 1414, Jan Hus was invited to Sezimovo Ústí to preach in Kozí hrádek Castle, which led the radicalization of many people and establishment of Hussite movement. In 1420, Hussites burned down the town and left to the nearby newly established town of Tábor. Some parts of the abandoned town were still used in the time of King George of Poděbrady and the Dominican friars returned to the damaged monastery after 1420 for some time. Water mill and one farm was also on the grounds of the old town for most of the time after the town was abandoned.

In 1828, a new village was founded and was named Starý Tábor ("Old Tábor"). About 80 houses were built or under construction in 1832. Construction of the new church started in 1835 and it was consecrated in 1841. In 1920, the village was promoted to a town and returned to its historical name of Sezimovo Ústí. In 1939, the entrepreneur Jan Antonín Baťa built a factory and began to build a new district of Sezimovo Ústí, nowadays called Sezimovo Ústí 2. During World War II, Sezimovo Ústí was incorporated into Tábor, which lasted until 30 June 1945.
