Treasure Island is a reality competition television franchise. The programme originated in New Zealand in 1997, where it was originally produced by Touchdown Television and broadcast by TVNZ, with later editions produced for broadcasters in Australia and Ireland. In the programme, contestants are isolated on a remote Fijian island (early shows were filmed in Tonga) and compete for a cash prize of NZ$25,000. From the 2019 edition, the winner of the Celebrity Treasure Island will receive NZ$100,000 and NZ$50,000 for the regular season their chosen charity.

Concept history
The Treasure Island concept was created by former Touchdown producer Darryl McEwen after searching in the local library for a story on which he could base a reality gameshow before the successful Swedish programme Expedition Robinson – the original version of the Survivor format.

Challenges
1997–2001: Contestants are required to complete a quiz on a computer about Treasure Island and about their teammates during an elimination challenge. Once both teams finished the quiz, the computer would generate the two lowest-scoring members (one from each tribe) as to who will be leaving the island.
2002–2007: In 2002, the winning team eliminated one person from their own tribe. The eliminated person will eliminate one of their opposition team members. In 2003, Terminator/Elimination challenge was introduced. One selected member of the team would compete with one selected member of the opposing team in a 'terminator' challenge. The winner would become the terminator and would eliminate one member from both teams at the end of each day.
2019–present: Tribes competed for various challenges including Rewards, face-offs and Captain's Test. Charity Challenges were introduced as individual challenges and rotated between teams daily. $170,000 was raised in the 2019 edition while 2021 season raised $215,000 across various charities across Aotearoa.
