Close Enough for Rock 'n' Roll is the seventh studio album by the Scottish hard rock band Nazareth, released in 1976.

The lead track, "Telegram", describes the band's experience while touring of hangovers, travel by aeroplane and limousine, customs, FM radio, girls, breakfast, press reception, soundcheck and finally the show over a guitar riff that bursts into a short version of the Byrds hit before returning to the riff and the story.  It includes the album title in the lyrics. This references a saying among guitar players: "It doesn't matter if your guitar isn't fully in tune, as long as it's 'close enough for rock 'n' roll.'"  "Telegram" (parts 1–3 only) was Nazareth's concert opener for many years, including the 1981 shows recorded for the Snaz album.
