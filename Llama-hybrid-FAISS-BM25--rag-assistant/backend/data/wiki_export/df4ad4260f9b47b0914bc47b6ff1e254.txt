The National Trade Union Centre of Trinidad and Tobago (NATUC) is a trade union federation in Trinidad and Tobago. It was created in 1991 by the merger of the Trinidad and Tobago Labour Congress (TTLC) and the Council of Progressive Trade Unions (CPTU). It has a membership of 100,000.

The NATUC is affiliated to the International Trade Union Confederation and the Caribbean Congress of Labour.
