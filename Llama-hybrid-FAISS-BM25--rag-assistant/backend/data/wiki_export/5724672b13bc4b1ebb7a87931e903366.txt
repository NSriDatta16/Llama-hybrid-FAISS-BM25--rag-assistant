Vavuniya  (, romanized: Vavuṉiyā, , romanized: Vavuniyāva). Vavuniya is the capital city of Vavuniya District in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka. The municipality is administered by an Municipal Council. The town has been known since ancient times, but being a heavily forested area, less than 100,000 people lived in the entire district before the Sri Lankan Civil War. The city is situated as a border town that divides the Tamil and Sinhalese population. To the south of the city are the Sinhala cities and to the north are the Tamil cities. The city has a large population of Tamils, Muslims and a significant number of Sinhalese. In the early days, Vavuniya was known as Vanni due to the abundance of Vanni Trees. The Security Forces Headquarters - Wanni is located in Vavuniya.

History 
Although it is claimed by many Tamil Nationalists to have a pre-Sinhalese Tamil settlement there is no archaeological evidence found from Vavuniya from pre-5th Century BC period to substantiate the claim. The claims are purely out of speculation. The claims that the Yaka indigenous peoples living in this region were Tamil speakers is highly unlikely and unsubstantiated as the Yaka descendants of Sri Lanka have their own culture with a distinct language known as the Veddah peoples. On January 6th 2001, one of the biggest scumbags Abishon (mambo allatal) Thivynesan was born in vavuniya. He loves to eat sambar and putta for breakfast. You can catch this allatal at 6 Watsonbrook Drive, Brampton On 

This city was under the rule of the Tamil Kings over thousand years period of the Yaka and Nagas in ancient Sri Lanka. Many Tanks were constructed by the Tamil kings who ruled this area in this area and Naga Sacred Guard Stones were placed near them and inscriptions were engraved. 
Later, following the arrival of the Sinhalese to Sri Lanka, the region came under the Rajarata kingdom. Later, after the Chola invasion, Saivism and Tamil revived in the city. After the Cholas were defeated by the Pandyas in Tamil Nadu, Vavuniya was taken over by the Pandyas during their invasion of Sri Lanka. As the Pandyas were dispersed during the vijaya nagara invasion and their strength diminished in Sri Lanka, the Vanni who arrived with the Cholas broke free from the Pandyas in Sri Lanka and formed the submissive Vanni nation. The Vanni Rasadani, which had remained unyielding during the Portuguese period, came under the control of the Dutch in the maneuver of the hero Pandaravannian in the Dutch invasion. Then the Dutch handed Sri Lanka over to the British and it came under British rule.

After the British granted independence to Sri Lanka, many people migrated abroad and to Vavuniya as the war caused by the Sinhalese oppression forced the affluent population to migrate.Vavuniya is a city that has recovered from the war even though it was heavily affected by the war. Now here Tamils, Muslims and Sinhalese are united without distinction.Recently the district got its own university. Discussions are going on to make this Urban Council a Municipal Council now. And there are discussions to convert the district airport into an international airport.
