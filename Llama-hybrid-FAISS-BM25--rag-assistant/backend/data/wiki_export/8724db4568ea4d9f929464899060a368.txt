History

Founding and Ultimate Circus (2000–2003)
Nightmare started on January 1, 2000 by Sakito and Hitsugi while most of the members were still in high school. The band name was suggested by Hitsugi, saying he wanted a band name that would scare people to match their visual styles. Soon, Ni~ya was invited by Sakito, Yomi by Hitsugi, and Zannin joined after he heard his classmates were forming a band. They were all influenced by either X Japan or Luna Sea, therefore they started out as a cover band, before they began to write their own material.

Just as the band began getting more recognition at live houses and small concerts in the Sendai region, Zannin left the band for unknown reasons. Eventually, Ruka (formerly of Luinspear) joined the band as a support member at first, but became the permanent drummer after a short time. Since Ruka joined Nightmare officially, their line-up hasn't changed. Shortly after, the band began short tours around the region with other supporting bands.

In 2003, Nightmare signed with Nippon Crown and released their first single "Believe". Three months after their debut, they released a triple A-side single, "Akane/Hate/Over", a first time for any band to release any single with three A-side tracks.  Nightmare's song "Over" was used as the ending theme for the anime television series Croket!. Later that year, they released their first studio album, Ultimate Circus and went on their first tour.

Livid and Anima (2004–2006)
In 2004 Nightmare released three singles; "Varuna", "Tokyo Shounen", and "Cyan", as well as another full album, Livid. Nightmare once more toured around Japan under the name Tour CPU 2004. From 2005 to 2006, Nightmare continued working, releasing more singles and their third full-length album in 2006, Anima, for which the support tour, [Anima]lism, completely sold out. In 2006 they recorded a live record at NHK Hall titled Gianism Tsu. With three albums and several tours under their belt, Nightmare released a series of "greatest hits" albums.

The World Ruler and Killer Show (2007–2008)
In October 2006, Nightmare released "The World/Alumina", the first single to be released under their new label, VAP. These two songs were used as the first opening and ending themes respectively of the first nineteen episodes of the Death Note anime adaptation. On 27 February 2007, they released their fourth album, "The World Ruler" and toured for three months around Japan. They released their next single, "Raison d'Etre", barely a month after finishing their tour (which was used as the opening theme song for the anime Claymore).

Musical style and Influences
Nightmare's band concept is Gianizm and this word occurs in many of their song titles. Gianizm is derived from the Doraemon character Gian. Gian's motto is . Incidentally, this also forms the name of the two 'best of' albums on which Nightmare re-released their indie songs. The band has often ventured into new genres or styles, such as on their 2013 album "Scums" where they experiment with electronica and dubstep or "Masquerade" and "Konoha" where they experiment with ska and reggae also in their album To Be or Not to Be they experimented with elements from metalcore like breakdowns. They usually combine these styles with gothic/hard rock and often pop or jazz.

X Japan's album "Dahlia" and Luna Sea's album "Style" got Yomi into music, and Yomi covered Luna Sea, X Japan, Laputa, Rouage and La'cryma Christi in his high school days. Sakito cited Sugizo and Steve Vai as his main influences.
