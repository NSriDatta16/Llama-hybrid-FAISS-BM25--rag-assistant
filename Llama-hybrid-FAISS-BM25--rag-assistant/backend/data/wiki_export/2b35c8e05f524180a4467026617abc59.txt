Anaïs, Anaís, or Anais () is a female given name. It is widely thought to be a French Provençal and Catalan version of Anna. Some suggest it is derived from Anahita, the name of the Persian goddess of fertility and healing.

Since about 1980, the name Anaïs has been especially popular in France, perhaps due to the popularity of the Cacharel perfume "Anaïs Anaïs".  There is no account of the name in France before the late eighteenth century, when it is traceable in Provence and Catalonia.  The diminutive form Naïs was the title of a film by Marcel Pagnol.
