Area code 530 is a telephone area code in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) in northeastern and Northern California. It was created in 1997 in an area code split of 916.

The numbering plan area (NPA) includes the Sacramento Valley (including some outer suburbs of Sacramento), Shasta Cascade, and the northern Sierra Nevada. It comprises all or sections of the following counties: Alpine, Butte, Colusa, El Dorado, Glenn, Humboldt, Lassen, Modoc, Mono, Nevada, Placer, Plumas, Shasta, Sierra, Siskiyou, Sutter, Tehama, Trinity, Yolo, and Yuba.

History
Area code 530 was created in a split of numbering plan area 916 on November 1, 1997. Simultaneously, the Dixon exchange was reassigned from area code 916 to area code 707, and from the Sacramento Local access and transport area (LATA) to the San Francisco LATA.

Prior to October 2021, area code 530 had telephone numbers assigned for the central office code 988. In 2020, 988 was designated nationwide as a dialing code for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which created a conflict for exchanges that permit seven-digit dialing. This area code was therefore scheduled to transition to ten-digit dialing by October 24, 2021.

On June 8, 2023, the California Public Utilities Commission assigned Area code 837 as the overlay area code for 530, effective January 31, 2025. 837 will serve as California's 40th area code. As ten-digit dialing is already in effect, no permissive dialing period will be necessary.

Service area
Major cities in the numbering plan area include Auburn, Chico, Colfax, Davis, Grass Valley, Corning, Marysville, Oroville, Paradise, Placerville, Redding, Red Bluff, Susanville, Truckee, Woodland, Yuba City, and South Lake Tahoe.
