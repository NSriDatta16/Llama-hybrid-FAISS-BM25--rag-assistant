George W. Kanyeihamba is a Ugandan author, a retired supreme court Judge, former cabinet minister, member of parliament and was a chair of the Legal Committee of the Constituent Assembly that made the 1995 Constitution. He was appointed a member of the Supreme Court of Uganda in 1997 and retired in November 2009.  Previously, he served as minister of commerce, minister of justice, and attorney-general, all in President Yoweri Museveni's administration. He holds a Ph.D. in law from the University of Warwick. In 2008, Warwick awarded him an honorary LLD.

Kanyeihamba was one of the three supreme court justices who ruled that the re-election of President Museveni in 2006 was fraudulent enough to be nullified. He has since lost his post as judge of the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights and commentators believe that his stand in that election petition cost him his job.

He has also been critical of the Government of Uganda when armed men invaded the premises of the High Court of Uganda to rearrest treason suspects that had been released on bail by the court. The Constitutional Court has since ruled that the invasion of the court premises was unconstitutional.
