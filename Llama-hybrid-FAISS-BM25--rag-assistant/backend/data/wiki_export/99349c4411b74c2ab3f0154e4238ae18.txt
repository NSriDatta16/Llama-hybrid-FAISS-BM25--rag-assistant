Makanin graduated from the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics at Moscow State University and worked as a teacher in the Military Academy until the early 1960s. In 1963 he took the High Courses for Scriptwriters and Film Directors at the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography, then worked for the publishing house Sovietskiy Pisatel (The Soviet Writer).

He published his first book in 1965. In 1985, he became a board member at the Union of Soviet Writers and, two years later, joined the editorial staff at Znamya.
