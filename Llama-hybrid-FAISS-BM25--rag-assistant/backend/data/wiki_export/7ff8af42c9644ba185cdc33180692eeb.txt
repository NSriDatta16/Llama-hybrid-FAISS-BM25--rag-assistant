Etymology
In the past, some researchers stated that the name "Thu Dau Mot" had originated from Cambodian language, but most of people claimed that the name "Thu Dau Mot" was a Vietnamese phrase, which combines two phrases that are Thu (means keep) and Dau Mot, whose the first word is a tree called dipterocarpaceae and the second one is a number. According to rumors, in a defense base (literally means "Thu") in Bình An, there was a tree on the hill (tree here is a kind of species in dipterocarpaceae, and it is called "Dau" in Vietnamese language), "Mot" is number one in Vietnamese language, so the name "Thu Dau Mot" was born, which means "one-tree-defense" literally.
