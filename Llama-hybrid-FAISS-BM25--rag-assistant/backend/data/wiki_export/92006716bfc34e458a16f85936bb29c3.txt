Georgia's 4th congressional district is a congressional district in the U.S. state of Georgia. The district is currently represented by Democrat Hank Johnson, though the district's boundaries have been redrawn following the 2010 census, which granted an additional congressional seat to Georgia.  The first election using the new district boundaries (listed below) were the 2012 congressional elections.

The newly drawn district retains its majority African American status and includes many of Atlanta's inner eastern suburbs, such as Conyers, Covington, Decatur, Lilburn, Stone Mountain, and Lithonia.
