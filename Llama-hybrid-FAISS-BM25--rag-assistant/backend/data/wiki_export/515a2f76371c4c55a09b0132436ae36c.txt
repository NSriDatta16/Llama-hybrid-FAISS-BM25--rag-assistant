Armoured Carrier, Wheeled, Indian Pattern (ACV-IP), known also as Indian Pattern Carrier or other similar names, was an armoured car produced in India during the Second World War. It was typically armed with a Bren light machine gun. Those produced by Tata Locomotives were called "Tatanagars" after the location of the works. 4,655 were produced, used by Indian units in the Far East and Mediterranean and Middle East Theatre, typically in divisional reconnaissance regiments.

History
At the outbreak of the Second World War, the United Kingdom was unable to meet the needs of the Commonwealth for armoured fighting vehicles. It led many Commonwealth countries to develop their own vehicles. As production of heavy armoured vehicles, such as tanks, required advanced industry which those countries lacked, most of the developed fighting vehicles were armoured cars, often based on imported chassis.

In India a series of armoured vehicles was developed, known as Armoured Carrier, Wheeled, Indian Pattern or ACV-IP. These vehicles used Ford or GMC CMP truck chassis imported from Canada. Armoured hulls were constructed mainly by the Indian Railways. The armament typically consisted of Bren light machine gun, in some variants mounted in a small turret and Boys anti-tank rifle. The No. 19 radio set was carried. The vehicle was in production from 1940 until 1944, 4,655 being built.

The ACV-IP was used by Indian units in the Far East and Mediterranean and Middle East Theatre, typically in divisional reconnaissance regiments, as reconnaissance vehicle, personnel carrier, AA weapons carrier or Forward Observation Officer vehicle.
