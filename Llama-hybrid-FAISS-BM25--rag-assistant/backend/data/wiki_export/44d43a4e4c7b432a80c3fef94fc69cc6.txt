Trails

Sussex Branch Trail

The  Sussex Branch Trail passes through swamps, lakes, fields and several communities. Many features from its previous existence as a railroad can be exhibited. Among those features are graded fill areas, cuts through bedrock, underpasses that allowed the passage of farm equipment and dairy cattle from one side of the tracks to the other, and bridges crossing the Pequest River or Paulins Kill. The flat cinder base of the trail permits multiple uses including hiking, horseback riding, biking, cross-country skiing and dog sledding. The trail provides access for fishing and for wheelchairs in certain areas. The Sussex Branch Trail also crosses through Allamuchy Mountain State Park.
