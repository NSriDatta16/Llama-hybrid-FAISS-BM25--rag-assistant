Galton Blackiston is an English chef, born in Norfolk. The restaurant of his hotel, Morston Hall, Holt in Morston, is Michelin starred and has 4 AA Rosettes. It is on the north Norfolk coast, two miles from Blakeney. His unusual first name is a tribute to his relative Sir Francis Galton.

Blackiston has never trained formally as a chef. After leaving school at 16 to play cricket, he was encouraged by his mother to set up a market stall selling homemade baked goods, "Galton's Goodies". His first job in a restaurant was at John Tovey's Miller Howe country hotel in Windermere, the Lake District.

In 2013, Blackiston started No 1 Cromer, a fish and chip shop in Cromer.

Blackiston represented the Midlands and East of England in the BBC's Great British Menu, knocking out celebrity chef Antony Worrall Thompson to gain a place in the final. In 2007, he appeared on the television programme Food Poker.
