Cupar railway station is a railway station that serves the town of Cupar in Fife, Scotland. The station has two platforms, of which the southbound one (for trains to Edinburgh) is now wheelchair accessible. Services are provided by ScotRail and CrossCountry.

History
The station was opened by the Edinburgh and Northern Railway in 1847 as the temporary northern terminus of the Tayport branch of their route along the Fife Coast.  The line northwards to Tayport (for the ferry link to Dundee) was completed in 1850 and through running to Dundee over the first Tay Bridge began in 1878.

On 4 July 1988 a Class 47 cement train derailed, demolishing a section of the bridge which carries the B940 over the railway. This was caused by excessive speed and a  fault with the rail line.
