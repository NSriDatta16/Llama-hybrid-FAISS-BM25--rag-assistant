The BMW N45 is a naturally aspirated four-cylinder petrol engine which replaced the BMW N40 and was produced from 2004-2011. It was produced alongside the BMW N46 engine and only sold in several countries, where vehicle taxes favoured small-displacement engines.

The N45 is based on the N46, however it does not have balance shafts or Valvetronic (variable valve lift). As per the N42 and N46, the N45 has double-VANOS (variable valve timing). In 2007, the N45 was updated, which was called the N45N.

In 2007, the N45's successor - the BMW N43 - was introduced. However, the direct-injected N43 was not sold in countries with high-sulfur fuel, so the N45 continued to be produced alongside the N43. The N45 was phased out as new generation vehicles were released with the turbocharged BMW N13 four-cylinder engine.

The N45 was enlarged to , to homologate the E90 320si for the World Touring Car Championship. The N45 was chosen over the N46, because its lack of variable valve lift allows higher engine speeds. Instead, the engine used dual overhead camshafts and 16 valves. The main visual difference is the carbon fiber valve cover.
