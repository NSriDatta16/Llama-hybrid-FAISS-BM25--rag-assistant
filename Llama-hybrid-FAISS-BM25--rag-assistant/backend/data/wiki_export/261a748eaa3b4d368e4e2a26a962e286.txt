Early life 
Manish Malhotra was born to a Punjabi family in Mumbai, India. He studied at the Sacred Heart Boys High School, Mumbai.

Growing up, he was heavily influenced by Bollywood films  – the songs, the storytelling, the colors, the costumes, the actors who adorned them and made it a point to watch every film which released in cinemas. As he had a knack for sketching, he joined a painting class in the tenth grade as per his brother's suggestion.

From watching films, painting, being surrounded by mother's clothes, recreating her sarees, being strongly opinionated about his family's sartorial choices, his love for fashion, styling, and cinema grew. 

While studying Arts at Elphinstone College in Mumbai, Manish was 19 when he forayed into modeling ad campaigns for brands like Fu's, Weekender, Frooti, and Goldspot. He managed to save Rs 90,000 through his modeling gigs and flew to Bangkok and Singapore in a quest to explore the world. 

On his return at the onset, he joined a boutique in Bandra called Equinox, where he spent his time sketching and draping the mannequins for a year, which paid him lower than 500 Indian rupees per month. 

In 1987, he decided to hire two tailors and started taking customized couture orders from his house. He wished to showcase his collection at Ensemble but didn't have the monetary means to create them at that point in time.

In 1989, he was offered a chance to style the celebrated actress Divya Bharti in a song sequence for a film by David Dhawan. However, the film was later shelved.

Though he did not have a formal education in fashion design, Malhotra's love for sketching, painting, and his passion for cinema and clothes saw him veer towards the world of films and styling. He debuted in the Hindi Film Industry as a costume stylist in 1990. Since then, Malhotra has dressed an entire generation of Bollywood actors and their progeny on-screen while also extending his aesthetics with his private label.

He describes his Bollywood forte as "an entire, integrated look for a character throughout a film."

Career

Stylist and designer 
Malhotra made his costume designing debut with the film Swarg (1990), starring Rajesh Khanna, Govinda and Juhi Chawla.

The same year, his gateway to the fashion industry opened when Rakesh Sreshtha, a photographer, introduced him to the late Sridevi to style her photoshoot looks.

His creative process as a costume stylist began with script readings – an unheard-of practice in Hindi films then. He believed that costumes were an integral part of visual storytelling to make the characters more relatable to the audience. 

Malhotra was known to be the first costume stylist and designer to view the film as a whole. He advised the actresses and filmmakers on aspects where the character's look would just be a subset of the overall creative input, lending the costume looks their due credit. 

In 1993, he designed a complete look for the late Sridevi's character in Mahesh Bhatt's Gumrah.

The designer said it was during the shooting of the Telugu thriller Govinda Govinda (1994) when Ram Gopal Varma first noticed his designs for Sridevi and reached out to him for Rangeela (1995). The film proved a career-changing experience for him as the success of the film and the popularity of the fashion trends the film established led Filmfare to introduce a new category for costume designing, the Filmfare Award for Best Costume Design, with Malhotra being its first recipient. 

Malhotra was credited for his modern and minimal yet impactful costume styling - be it the chiffon sarees in "Hai Rama”, the tangerine skater dress and the printed dress on a white base in "Tanha Tanha", the pleated skirts and boyfriend shorts in "Rangeela Re", or the Chaplinesque look in "Kya Kare Kya Na Kare". The casual style of Urmila Matondkar, who played the film's central protagonist - from co-ords, skater dresses, leotards with scarves to oversized shirts, high-waist jeans with figure-hugging tees, and wool berets - were noted to be one of the main talking points of the film.

In 1997, Malhotra was offered a styling and designing project for Yash Raj Chopra's Dil To Pagal Hai. The film depicts the love lives of the cast and crew in a musical dance troupe while introducing stylish athleisure wear, sheer traditional outfits, and minimal styling to Hindi Cinema. From bicycle shorts, sports bras, wrist bands on Karisma Kapoor to Madhuri Dixit's sheer salwar suit sets in lace and chiffon symbolic of her coy nature; made most Indian women line up at the shops for copies. 

The costumes, looks and styling of Karan Johar's Kuch Kuch Hota Hai created an absolute frenzy back in 1998, courtesy of the man behind the fashion department, Malhotra, for which he won 7 individual category awards. The DKNY tracksuits, activewear, uber-casual sweatshirts, logo tees, and denim adorned by Kajol or the minimal dress to co-ords layered with oversized outerwear and the high-octane mini dress worn by Rani Mukerji, In the latter half of the film, Kajol was seen draped in sheer sarees with a hint of lace, or solid versions with an emphasis on the blouse; pastel hues and layering kurtas with sleek trousers which came to the forefront, bringing with them a timeless appeal. The off-route orange and beige lehenga as opposed to the go-to bridal red iteration. From athleisure, casual to bridal looks, Malhotra garnered recognition to create an array of fashion-forward looks now omnipresent and trendsetting.

In 1999, Johar hired Malhotra to design for his multi-starrer family drama Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001). Malhotra styled Kareena Kapoor's look in the film, which helped cement her position as a true style icon of Bollywood and set the entire tone for the film. The styling of the film earned Malhotra high acclaim - right from the red coordinated set of sequin top with bell-bottom pants from "You Are My Soniya", the pastel pink choli-pants paired with an asymmetrical cut bodice from "Bole Chudiyaan", to the yellow strapless top with the sunflower choker and ombre sunglasses, shimmer crop tops, mini-skirts, leather pants, jackets, scarves and fur collars. Malhotra's styling in the film is perceived to be timeless, relevant and inspirational for every generation.

In 2001, Malhotra won his first IIFA Award for Best Costume Design for his work in Aditya Chopra's Mohabbatein.

In 2003, Malhotra styled Johar's Kal Ho Naa Ho, a romantic comedy-drama based on NRI's living in New York City. Preity Zinta's statement pieces included scarves, trench coats, halter dresses (including the now-iconic red one from "Kuch Toh Hua Hai"), sweaters, slip dresses, flared pants, and one-shoulder dresses - all relevant to the era and character. Shah Rukh Khan and Saif Ali Khan's embroidered kurtas and Zinta's blue "Maahi Ve" lehenga, and Jaya Bachchan's makeover look, which including jeans, sweaters, sweatshirts and long trench and overcoats also received acclaim.

The same year, he designed the wedding outfits for Karishma Kapoor subsequently leading to inquiries from high-profile clientele like the Raheja Builders and many more. 

In 2004, Malhotra generated quite a buzz after styling Sushmita Sen in Farah Khan's Main Hoon Na, in flowy chiffon sarees, vibrant colors, and prints 

Malhotra is known for making women feel sultry in sarees. 

In 2006, Johar once again reached out to Malhotra to style the entire cast of his ensemble musical romantic drama Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna. Malhotra received universal acclaim for his styling in the film - right from Shah Rukh Khan's preppy athleisure wear, Rani Mukherji's chiffon sarees, halter blouses and trench coats, Abhishek Bachchan's working guy formal wear, Preity Zinta's chic fashionista skirts, scarves, tops and dresses, Amitabh Bachchan's classic suits to Kirron Kher's homely long skirts, sweaters, stoles and kurtas - all of which received widespread praise from critics and the audience. 

In 2007, Malhotra styled Kareena Kapoor's character, Geet in the film Jab We Met. The film saw the rise of harem pants paired with long t-shirts, phulkari scarves, corset tops (with the popular red skirt), and hoop earrings with short kurtas.

It saw her in the iconic shimmering golden swimsuit, and her classic silver saree with a sensuous blouse from the song "Desi Girl" launched many versions of the same.

Entrepreneur 
His label "Manish Malhotra" is synonymous with opulent, contemporary, and larger-than-life glamour Indian wear.

In 1999, he collaborated with his friends, the industrialist Kajal Anand, Avanti, and Yash Birla for a brief period to design collections for their store, Reverie.

Manish Malhotra tied up with Sheetal Design Studio and set up a workshop there. He virtually became a face of the Sheetal Design Studio, and exclusively retailed out of their store at Bombay's Grant Road for 4 years.

In 2017, Manish launched the Hyderabad store, which spreads over 15,000 sq. ft. It is located in the city's posh Jubilee Hills locality to meet the designer's grand visionary identity. 

Over the years, the label's aesthetic has aimed to bring together traditional Indian craftsmanship with contemporary silhouettes like gowns with intricate gold embroidery, cigarette pants paired with long jackets for women, voluminous lehengas worn with cropped blouses, or the use of non-traditional colors like royal blue, soft pink, maroon, etc., in bridal ensembles. The label's design language is claimed to exhibit glamour and is a reflection of modern India. 

In 2019, many actresses wore the signature "Manish Malhotra saree" that the designer introduced in a variety of colours.

He launched his first-ever haute-couture make-up line, 'Manish Malhotra Beauty', in collaboration with My Glamm in December 2018.

Reliance Brands Limited (RBL) - part of the retail arm of billionaire Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries acquired a 40 percent stake in brand 'Manish Malhotra' (within the lifestyle space domain) to accelerate the 16-year old couture house's growth in India and across the globe.

The brand will continue to be led by Manish Malhotra, as Managing and Creative Director after the partnership with Reliance.

Digital venture 

On January 14, 2021, Manish Malhotra was the first in the Indian design space to launch the first-ever virtual store.

The virtual tour's design house is built with online navigation systems and custom configurations, and customers can walk through the aisles, zoom in on the products, and get the item's details.

To conclude India Couture Week (ICW) 2020, Malhotra was the first in the Indian fashion space to stage the grand finale in a virtual format with ‘Ruhaniyat’ —a medium that gave him the chance to sit in the director’s chair and visualize clothes as characters. The couture film conjured a mood of mysticism laced by the Sufi notes of singer Abi Sampa and musician Rushil Ranjan. Malhotra’s inspiration is pivoted on the princely histories of Punjab and Awadh, with styling, music and the overall old-word opulence borrowed from the Mughal era bringing forth the real fraction of the Awadhi-Punjabi repertoire with voluminous silhouettes, deft embroidery, and layerings. Janhvi Kapoor, the young film star and daughter of the late Bollywood actor Sridevi, became the revered muse, invoking bridal emotions at different points in the fashion film. 

The multi-faceted designer introduced his timeless and seasonless 'Nooraniyat' collection through a couture film in April 2021, featuring the millennial actress Sara Ali Khan and Kriti Sanon for the bridal collection. The couture video hallmarks his three decades of designing for film and the runway.
