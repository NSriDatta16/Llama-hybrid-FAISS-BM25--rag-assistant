Professional career

Miami Dolphins
Vickerson was drafted by former Miami Dolphins head coach Nick Saban with a seventh-round pick (216th overall) in the 2005 NFL Draft. After being late for numerous team meetings the Dolphins considered pulling their contract offer from the table, however he was signed on July 24. After spending two days on the Active/Non-Football Injury list, Vickerson was cleared to practice.

After compiling five tackles and a sack in preseason, Vickerson appeared likely to make the team. However, he was placed on Injured Reserve after suffering an ACL injury in a preseason game against the Atlanta Falcons on September 1.

Vickerson was on the bubble to make the team in 2006 and was rumored to be a candidate for the trading block, but in the end did make the final roster. He was inactive for all 16 contests in 2006, and after two seasons had never appeared in a regular season game for the Dolphins.

Vickerson became an unrestricted free agent on March 2, 2007 after the Dolphins declined to offer him a contract as an exclusive rights free agent. He was re-signed by the team and allocated to NFL Europa on March 9. In 10 starts for the Cologne Centurions, Vickerson recorded 31 tackles, 3.5 sacks and two passes defensed.
