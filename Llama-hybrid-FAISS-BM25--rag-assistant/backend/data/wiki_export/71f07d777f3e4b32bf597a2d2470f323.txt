It was wider and longer than the Firedome and it came equipped with a hemispherical cylinder head, 291 cubic inch displacement (4.8L) V8 engine producing 200 hp when equipped with the 4 barrel carburetor (149 kW) and PowerFlite automatic transmission.

The 1956 model car was best known for its long, tapering tail fins, often accentuated by a two-tone exterior finish. The interior offered bench seating that could accommodate six passengers. The Fireflite had a 0 to 60 mph (97 km/h) acceleration time of 11 seconds and a top speed of 110 mph (175 km/h).

Sales

The Fireflite’s bold design increased sales for DeSoto. In 1955, DeSotos sold well with over 114,765 examples produced, making 1955 the best year for the company since 1946. By 1956, DeSoto placed eleventh in U.S. production with an annual production of 110,418 cars.
