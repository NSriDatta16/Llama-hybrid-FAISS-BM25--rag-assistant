A sugar acid or acidic sugar is a monosaccharide with a carboxyl group at one end or both ends of its chain.

Main classes of sugar acids include:
 Aldonic acids, in which the aldehyde group (−CHO) located at the initial end (position 1) of an aldose is oxidized.
 Ulosonic acids, in which the −CH2(OH) group at the initial end of a 2-ketose is oxidized creating an α-ketoacid.
 Uronic acids, in which the −CH2(OH) group at the terminal end of an aldose or ketose is oxidized.
 Aldaric acids, in which both ends (−CHO and −CH2(OH)) of an aldose are oxidized.
