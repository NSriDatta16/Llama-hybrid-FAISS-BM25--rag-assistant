Bay City Central High School (BCC) is a high school located at 1624 Columbus Avenue, Bay City, Michigan, United States, and a part of Bay City Public Schools.  Its mascot is the wolf, and its colors are purple and gold.

Building history
The building that is now known as Bay City Central opened March 27, 1922.
The original architectural plans called for two floors, but a third was added to provide room for Bay City Junior College (which now exists as Delta College, and is now located in University Center, Michigan).  The "New Gymnasium" was constructed in 1957, and the cafeteria/commons received major renovations in 1995.  The school's bell tower (which contains two classrooms), as well as a copper-domed observatory on the roof was closed in 1983 due to fire code restrictions and remains unopened to this day.
