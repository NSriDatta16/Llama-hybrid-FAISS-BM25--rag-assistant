On Thursday, February 27, 2021, McDermott used an "insensitive and racist" analogy ("Guys, we need to stick together....We need both feet in. I need everybody to stay on the plantation. I can't have anybody leave the plantation.") while speaking to his team in the locker room after a 77–69 loss to the Xavier Musketeers. McDermott apologized for his actions, and was suspended by the university from all team activities for four days.

During the 2021–22 regular season, largely regarded as a rebuilding year after the departure of star point guard Marcus Zegarowski and three other starters from the 2020–2021 roster, as well as two assistant coaches, McDermott nevertheless guided the Bluejays to a 20–10 regular season record (12–7 in Big East play), good enough for 4th place.
