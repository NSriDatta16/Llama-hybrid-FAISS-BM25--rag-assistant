Train running details are supplied via timetable posters, digital information screens, customer help points and automatic announcements.  Step-free access is available to both platforms via ramps.

Three trains per day only go as far as Dumfries. Saturday services are mostly the same except there are only two trains that terminate at Dumfries and only eight trains to Glasgow Central. On a Sunday a limited service of just two trains per day each way operate.
