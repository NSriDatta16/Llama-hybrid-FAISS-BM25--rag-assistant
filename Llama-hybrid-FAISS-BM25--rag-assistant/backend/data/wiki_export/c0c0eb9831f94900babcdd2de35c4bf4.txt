is a video game developed by Positron and published by Square and released in 1999.

Gameplay 
iS: internal section is a tube shooter, in the same vein of gameplay as Tempest 2000 and N2O: Nitrous Oxide.

A tube shooter is a type of shoot 'em up where the player controls a ship "looking down" a long tunnel or tube, and the player can move around inside the cylinder, shooting enemies that it runs into while moving. It is an experimental project that responds to its 16 built-in tracks, or even your own music from a CD.

The game featured twelve weapons, all of which have names that derive from the Chinese Zodiac.

The graphics in the game feature flat shaded models, and the players ship and enemies are simple polygon shapes.

The game has a default techno soundtrack, but music from a compact disk can be added to the game.

Release 
iS: Internal section was released on January 28, 1999, for the Sony PlayStation and was published by Square. The game was ultimately never released outside of Japan. It has also never been re-released for the PlayStation Network's Game Archives in Japan as well. Later, a track from the game was later released in the compilation CD SQUARE ENIX BATTLE TRACKS Vol.3 SQUARE 1999 - 2000.
