Torneos y Competencias S.A. (abbreviated TyC, also referred as Torneos) is an Argentine sports communications firm created by businessman Carlos Ávila, associated with Jose Santoro, and Héctor Dayan. It is an important force in the world of Argentine sports, with interests in publications and radio and TV broadcasting. Its headquarters are in Buenos Aires.

History
Torneos started its activities in the Argentine media in 1982, with a golf program. Since then it produced and aired successful programs in network television such as El deporte y el hombre, Tenis de Primera, Fútbol de Primera and La Magia de la NBA; the most successful of them being the weekly Fútbol de Primera, which summarizes each day of competition in the Argentine first division. 

In 1994, Torneos launched the channel TyC Sports to broadcast the Argentine Primera Division.

Removal of first division television rights
In 1992, the company Televisión Satelital Codificada (TSC, a joint venture between TyC and the Clarín group) signed an agreement with the Argentine Football Association (AFA) for the broadcasters exclusive live of Argentine football matches. All the official matches were available on the "TyC Sports" and "TyC Max" cable & satellite channels. This agreement expired in 2014.

In July 2009, due to an economic crisis that affected several Primera División clubs, the AFA tried new ways of financing. The President of the AFA, Julio Grondona, requested TSC authorities to modify the contract for television rights in order for the AFA to receive 720 million Argentine pesos. However, in the last season, TSC paid the AFA 230 million pesos, and the request was rejected by TSC.

Later, Grondona received an offer from the Argentine government in order for the National System of Public Media – the state-owned Channel 7 – to replace TSC for broadcasting the games on TV. Cristina Fernández de Kirchner's government has a public confrontation against the Clarín group, a member of TSC.

On August 11, 2009, the AFA broke the contract with TSC, accusing it of not fulfilling the agreement. Then, the AFA sued TSC, but TyC also tried an unsuccessful lawsuit against the AFA for cancelling the contract.
