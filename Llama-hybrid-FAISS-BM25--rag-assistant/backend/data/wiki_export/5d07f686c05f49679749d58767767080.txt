Dutchflyer is an integrated passenger service between the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Formerly known as Amsterdam Express, Dutchflyer is a rail/sea/rail service operated jointly by Stena Line, the Dutch state railway operator Nederlandse Spoorwegen and its UK subsidiary Greater Anglia, and the Rotterdam metro and bus company Rotterdamse Elektrische Tram.

History
The Dutchflyer service is a successor to former boat trains such as the London & North Eastern Railway (LNER) Hook Continental service, which operated between London and the Netherlands from 1927 to 1987.

Originally, the Dutchflyer brand was only used to market the service to passengers starting in the UK, while in the Netherlands the service was advertised as "GoLondon". Nowadays the Dutchflyer brand is not used as prominently and the service is sold through the Dutch Stena Line website.

Booking
The Dutchflyer service lets passengers travel from any UK railway station served by Greater Anglia to  (formerly Parkeston Quay), cross the North Sea by Stena Line ferry. As of March 2022, the ticket no longer includes the journey after arrival at  to any station in the Netherlands (or in the reverse direction): the ticket for the Dutch rail portion has to be purchased separately. Trains to and from London and  are timed to meet the ferry.

Train services

After arriving in Hook of Holland (Hoek van Holland), passengers disembark right into the railway station, which is now part of the Rotterdam Metro. In Rotterdam passengers may change trains to go anywhere in the Netherlands. An example is shown in this table for a connection by rail from Hook of Holland to Rotterdam and then to The Hague or Amsterdam, or stations in between.
