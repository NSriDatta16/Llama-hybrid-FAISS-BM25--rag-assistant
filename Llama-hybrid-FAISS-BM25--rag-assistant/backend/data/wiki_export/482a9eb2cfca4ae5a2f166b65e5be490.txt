Sallaans (; Low Saxon: Sallaands) is a collective term for the Westphalian dialects of the region Salland, in the province of Overijssel, as well as in minor parts of Gelderland and Drenthe in the Eastern Netherlands. In the Kop van Overijssel, the Stellingwarfs dialect is spoken.

A common term used by native speakers for their dialect, which is also used by Low Saxon speakers from other regions for their respective dialects, is plat or simply dialect. Yet another common usage is to refer to the language by the name of the local variety, where for instance Dal(f)sens would be the name for the Sallaans variety spoken in the village of Dalfsen. Sallands is more influenced by the Hollandic dialects than Twents or Achterhoeks. This influence is known as the Hollandse expansie. For example, the word 'house' (Standard Dutch huis ) is hoes  in Twents but huus  in Sallaans. The Hollandic dialects of the 17th century still had not diphthongized  to , and due to their prestigious status they triggered the shift from  to .

Phonology

Consonants

  appears only as an allophone of  before voiced consonants.
 // occurring before and after back-rounded vowels is pronounced as a labio-velar approximant [].
 After long close and close-mid vowels,  surfaces as a diphthongization of the vowel, as in zoer . This also happens in compounds: veurkämer . It is also often dropped preconsonantally after .

Vowels

 Unlike in Standard Dutch, the long close-mid monophthongs  are actual monophthongs and not narrow closing diphthongs . They do not appear before  whenever that consonant occurs before a vowel or at the end of a word, where the open-mid series  occurs instead.
 The schwa  is often dropped before , resulting in a syllabic nasal homorganic with the preceding consonant. This occurs after most consonants, including nasals themselves: piepen , slóffen , gieten , kieken , esprungen , lachen . The sequences  and  are treated the same, except for the fact that they do not assimilate to the place of articulation of the preceding consonant.

  is realized as  before vowels and in the word-final position.
