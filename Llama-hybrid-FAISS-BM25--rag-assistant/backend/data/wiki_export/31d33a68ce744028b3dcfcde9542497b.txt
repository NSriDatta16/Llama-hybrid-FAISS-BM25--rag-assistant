The Power Macintosh 5260 is a personal computer designed, manufactured and sold by Apple Computer, Inc. from April 1996 to March 1997. It is a replacement for the Power Macintosh 5200 LC, retaining its all-in-one form factor while replacing its PowerPC 603 CPU with the newer and faster PowerPC 603e, and dropping the "LC" brand.  As was standard practice at the time for Apple, the 5260 was re-branded as a number of Performa models and sold to consumer markets, while the 5260 itself was primarily sold to the North American education market as a Power Macintosh.

The Power Macintosh 5400, also an all-in-one model, was introduced at the same time but had a significantly different logic board that retired NuBus support in favour of PCI.

The 5260 was discontinued when the Power Macintosh 5500 was introduced in early 1997.

Hardware 
The 5260 has an LC-style Processor Direct Slot, and a slot into which an L2 cache card can be added.

Models

Common to all models are a 14" Shadow Mask RGB display at 640x480 at 16 bit, a single LC PDS slot, 2 RAM slots, and 1 MB of VRAM that cannot be upgraded.  There are two serial ports on the back, but they do not support hardware handshaking, precluding the use of an external modem with speeds above 9600 bit/s.
