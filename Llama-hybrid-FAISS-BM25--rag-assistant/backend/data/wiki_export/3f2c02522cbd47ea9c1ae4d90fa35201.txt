Reception

Critical response
In a television review the Sacramento Bee wrote, "How country music came so far is at the heart of the ambitious and marvelous America's Music: The Roots of Country, which was in production for four years...America's Music begins with country's 1800s birth in the Appalachian Mountains and winds down with young singer-songwriter Tracy Lawrence summarizing it today: 'Country music is where everything has been poured into, and what's coming out is Young Country. It's hip and it's hot, and it's what's happening, and it's fresh and it's exciting.'"

The Los Angeles Times wrote of the series, "To a new generation of country-music fans who consider Randy Travis a grizzled veteran, it offers an eye-opening introduction to such towering figures from country's past as Jimmie Rodgers, the Carter Family, Hank Williams, Bob Wills, Kitty Wells, Lefty Frizzell, Johnny Cash, Merle Haggard, George Jones, Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton and so many others who paved the way for today's superstars...The show also reminds those who may have forgotten, or perhaps never knew, that Elvis Presley was just a humble country singer from Tupelo, Miss., before he became the King of Rock 'n' Roll."

The Detroit Free Press also lauded the film, and wrote, "It makes sense that a country music documentary would know how to tell a good story. America's Music: The Roots of Country,  a rich three-part retrospective that kicks off tonight on TBS, tells a dandy one. And though Kris Kristofferson is credited as narrator on the six-hour documentary, you won't hear his voice a whole bunch. Instead, the show's producers -- including Oscar-nominated filmmaker Tom Neff -- let the music and its makers do the talking. And that's a good thing, because country musicians just may be the world's  best storytellers. Starting with country's earthy roots in the hills of Ireland and Scotland and landing in today's billion-dollar Nashville industry, their tale unfolds at the same easygoing pace  that has long marked the music itself."

In their review, the Los Angeles Daily News wrote about one the film themes, "The only real constant in the very American world of rhinestones, cowboy boots and guitars has been its reverence and respect for its hallowed history. This is the tale told with loving care, humor and even poignancy in America's Music: The Roots of Country, a three-part, six-hour documentary that airs on TBS beginning today. Before George Strait, Vince Gill and Suzy Bogguss, there were Johnny Cash, Hank Williams and Patsy Cline. And before them, there were Bill Monroe and Jimmie Rogers and Patsy Montana. There are very strong lines that run through the lineage of country, and these are clarified and reinforced during the length of the film through interviews, wonderful old movie reels and vintage photographs. Everybody who was anybody in country music - living or dead - makes an appearance in a film that pays much more attention to the history makers and those who learned and benefited from them, than historians or academics. It gives the series a low-key, living-room quality that makes it especially appealing. After all, the one thing country music isn't is high brow."
