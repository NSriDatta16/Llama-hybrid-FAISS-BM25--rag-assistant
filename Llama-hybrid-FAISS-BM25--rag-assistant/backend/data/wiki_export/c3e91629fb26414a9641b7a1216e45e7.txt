Critical reception

The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote: "So unremittingly annoying, so ostentatiously pretentious, so utterly lacking in anything approaching a sense of humor, this album exerts a certain fascination." The Washington Post called the album "heavy-handed, uneven, feverishly melodramatic and occasionally overwrought."
