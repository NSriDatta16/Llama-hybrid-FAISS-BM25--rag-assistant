John Walker (15 September 1826 – 14 August 1885) was an English cricketer.

Walker was born in Palmers Green, the eldest of seven cricket playing brothers and four sisters - known historically as The Walkers of Southgate. He was educated in Stanmore and at Trinity College, Cambridge. He played as a right-handed batsman and an underarm right-arm slow bowler for Cambridge University (1846–1849), Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) (1847–1863), a Middlesex XI (1850–1863) and Middlesex County Cricket Club (1864–1866).

His family owned a large estate at Arnos Grove and he founded the John Walker Cricket Ground, in Waterfall Road, Southgate. It is run today by the Walker Trust.

William Buttress, a fellow cricketer, was financially supported by Walker at certain times (due to the former's precarious career).

Walker died at Arnos Grove in 1885, aged 58.
