Prequel (2006)
This 44/46-minute two-part special was produced and aired as part of the third season; set roughly a year before "Teddygozilla"
Jeremy discovers the Supercomputer, turns it on and finds Aelita inside. Having no memory of who she is, Jeremy gives her the name "Maya"

Aelita's very first use of her only power of "creativity" was when she instinctively made a wall of solid ice to defend Yumi
Yumi and Odd never discover their abilities of telekinesis and "future flash" nor Ulrich his "super sprint", triplication, and triangulation.

Season 3 (2006) 
Team Lyoko discover the very Heart/Core of Lyoko itself; a huge white sphere with a holographic image of Lyoko in its center, protected by two cube-shaped shields. XANA seeks to destroy the Core, provoking the complete destruction of Lyoko and leaving the heroes with no way to fight the evil multi-agent system 
Having become fully human since regaining the memories of her past life on Earth, Aelita can now be rematerialized normally via the scanners. She can fight monsters all on her own by emitting small, pink orbs of energy called "energy fields" from her hands which are capable of destroying a single monster from a distance
To prevent the Lyoko Warriors from reaching Sector 5, XANA has his Scyphozoa possess Aelita and uses her to erase the four main Sectors one by one by entering "Code XANA" in a way tower
William Dunbar is chosen to be the sixth member of the Lyoko Warriors; strengthening their efforts in finishing XANA once and for all. Shortly after he is possessed and used to destroy the Heart, wiping out Lyoko
Aelita's long-lost father, Franz Hopper, is revealed to be alive somewhere in the internet, having managed to escape the disintegration of Lyoko

Season 4 (2007) 
The quintet all don new attire on Earth since "Maiden Voyage"
Yumi, Aelita, Odd, and Ulrich don new attire on Lyoko. In addition, their weaponry is slightly upgraded/modified, and respective abilities are somewhat boosted:
Yumi's only ability of telekinesis now enables her to mentally move and hurl several objects all at once, and feels much less exhausted by placing her fingers on the horse pill-shaped things above her eyebrows, now able to use it for longer periods without tiring out. She continues to rarely use it, not even as a specter on Earth, despite the fact that it has gotten a lot stronger. 
Ulrich gets an additional katana, but his "triangulate" ability is never used; his triplicate is only used in "Double Take". Neither are used when he is a specter on Earth.
Odd's purple energy shield has expanded to the point that it covers his legs. As a specter on Earth, it has a pinkish hue as seen in its only use in "Down to Earth."
Aelita has white-pink angel wings, which are activated by waving her hand over a star-shaped bracelet, allowing her to fly and carry one other person. Her "creativity" power has strengthened to the point that she can deactivate a sealed door, which Jeremy calls "her digital powers." Her psychic ability of "second sight" is used only in "Kadic Bombshell" to detect XANA's pulsations.  
Having been under XANA's power for quite some time, William is given an ability called "Supersmoke" which is similar to Ulrich's "Supersprint." His larger sword "Zeilwander" can generate an energy discus and he can also levitate, and see what is happening from great distances away.
Additional supercomputers are discovered to be hidden across the globe, each generating a replica of a single sector of Lyoko. Jeremy devises a teleportation method to materialize his friends at the site of these supercomputers on Earth.
Aelita's long-lost mother is revealed to have been abducted by the ominous Men in Black and has not been seen or heard from in four years; her first name is also revealed to be Anthea in "Wrong Exposure."
Franz Hopper himself (whose full name is revealed to be Waldo Franz Schaeffer) finally debuts but as a white energy sphere, as he is incapable of virtualizing himself onto Lyoko in his human form like his daughter. Unfortunately, he ultimately sacrifices himself to enable Jeremy to obliterate XANA once and for all.
A replica for the Mountain Region is never shown. 
Sissi Delmas learns of their virtual adventures as heroes, prompting a final return to the past, after which the team welcomes her as a friend.
