The Starlet is a reality television program on The WB that premiered on March 6, 2005.

Ten young actresses lived together in a home formerly owned by Marilyn Monroe, while competing in a series of acting challenges for the chance to win a role on the WB drama One Tree Hill and a management contract with 3 Arts Entertainment.

Hosted by Katie Wagner, the girls were judged by a panel composed of actresses Faye Dunaway, and Vivica A. Fox, along with casting director Joseph Middleton. The show was a creation of Jamie Kennedy.  Jaime Pressly, Days of Our Lives Matt Cede√±o, David Gallagher and Adam LaVorgna from The WB's 7th Heaven also made guest appearances. The eventual winner was 18-year-old Michelynne McGuire, with Mercedes Connor as the runner up.

The Starlet was cancelled on April 5, 2005, after the single season of six episodes.
