Wiseman made his Boston United debut the next day, where he made his first start, in a 1–1 draw against Bristol Rovers. He also made another appearance for the club against Northampton Town on 26 February 2005 before returning to his parent club.

He made an increased number of appearances for Hull City in 2005–06, but then spent the first half of the 2006–07 season on loan to Rotherham United. Wiseman made his Rotherham United debut, in the opening game of the season, coming on as a substitute in the second half, in a 1–0 loss against Brighton & Hove Albion. Wiseman scored his first senior goal, in a match against Leyton Orient on 23 September 2006. After making eighteen appearances for the club, where Wiseman was featured in the first team regularly, his loan spell at Rotherham United came to an end in February 2007.

Darlington
On 9 March 2007, Wiseman joined Darlington on loan until the end of the season. Wiseman made his Darlington debut the next day, making his first start and played 90 minutes, in a 0–0 draw against Rochdale. While on loan at Darlington, Wiseman made ten appearances for them before returning to his parent club, with Manager Dave Penney's chance of keeping him is unlikely.

He joined Darlington permanently on 24 May 2007. However, Wiseman suffered a setback when he suffered an achilles injury that kept him out for the start of the season. After appearing two times as an unused substitute on 2 October 2007 and 6 October 2007, Wiseman, once again, suffered an injury that kept him throughout 2007.

Wiseman made his Rochdale debut, where he made his first start and played for 75 minutes, in a 0–0 draw against Grimsby Town in the opening game of the season. In a match against Luton Town on 22 November 2008, he set up a goal for Lee Thorpe to score the opener, in a 2–0 win. With seventeen appearances made so far, Wiseman was rewarded with a contract extension, keeping until the end of the season. After missing a game, due to an injury, Wiseman made his return, only to be sent-off, just 31 minutes to the game, in a 4–1 loss against Exeter City on 20 December 2008. Despite suffering an injury as the season came to an end, he finished his first season at the club, making thirty-four appearances in all competition. At the end of the 2008–09 season, Wiseman was released by the club.

However, in the unexpected turn of an event, Wiseman re-joined the club on 9 June 2009 after Simon Ramsden left Rochdale for Bradford City. Following his return, Wiseman continued to established himself in the first team despite suffering injuries. Wiseman scored his first goal for Rochdale on 5 December 2009 against Macclesfield Town, which saw them win 3-0 and for his performance, Wiseman was named Team of the Week, alongside Jason Taylor. As the 2009–10 season progressed, Wiseman made thirty-six appearances and scoring once for the club and helping the club reach promotion to League One next season. For his performance, Wiseman signed a two-year contract with the club.

In the 2010–11 season, Wiseman started the season well, where he helped the club made a good start with eight points and his performance were among singled out by Manager Keith Hill. After a month out, due to a stomach muscle problem, he made his return to the first team on 16 October 2010, in a 2–1 loss against Bristol Rovers.

Barnsley
On 21 June 2011, Wiseman left Rochdale to join Barnsley for an undisclosed fee, joining alongside his teammate Matt Done and Manager Hill. Upon joining the club, newly Manager Steve Eyre stated he allowed the pair to leave, refusing to intervene into staying at Rochdale.

Wiseman made his Barnsley debut, in the opening game of the season, making his first start as a right-back and played the whole minutes, in a 0–0 draw against Nottingham Forest. Wiseman then scored his first goal for Barnsley, in a 3–2 win against Derby County on 31 January 2012. As the 2011–12 season progressed, Wiseman played out in different position, mostly in the full-back. Wiseman went on to finish his first season at the club, making forty-five appearances and scoring once.

The 2012–13 season saw Wiseman captained his first match following the absence of Jimmy McNulty and played the whole game as captain, as they lost 5–1 against Brighton & Hove Albion on 25 August 2012. 
Following this, Wiseman captained for most of Barnsley matches for almost throughout 2012 and played a centre-back until he was dropped to the substitute for the match against Burnley on 27 November 2012. Wiseman returned to the squad as captain after spending two weeks as an unused substitute, in a 2–2 draw against Leicester City on 8 December 2012. In the January transfer window, Barnsley accepted a bid from Blackpool for Wiseman. However, the deal fell through. Though he rejected the move, Wiseman has increasingly become very unpopular among Barnsley supporters over his performance. Despite this, Wiseman continued to retain their place following newly appointed manager David Flitcroft used Wiseman as a right wing back due to the £3 million sale of youngster John Stones to Everton. In comparison to his somewhat average performances as a centre half under the Hill regime, Wiseman made the right wing back position his own and became an integral part of the 2013 Reds side that narrowly avoided relegation to League One. At the end of the 2012–13 season, Wiseman finished the season, making forty-one appearances in all competition.

In the 2013–14 season, Wiseman continued to be in a first team regular at the club, mostly in the right-back position. In a 2–1 loss against Leicester City on 28 September 2013, Wiseman had his wrongly goal disallowed following an offside blunder. Wiseman was a fault when he scored an own goal, in a 1–0 loss against Millwall on 25 November 2013. Following the match, Manager Flitcroft was quick to defend Wiseman for his performance against Millwall. Despite being a first team regular at Barnsley in the first half of the season, Wiseman was released by the club.

In a match against Tranmere Rovers on 8 February 2014, Wiseman set up one of the Joe Garner's goals, in a 2–1 win. Despite suffering from an injury, Wiseman made fifteen in the second half of the season.

In the 2014–15 season, Wiseman found himself competing with a right-back role with Calum Woods, which resulted him on the substitute in number of matches. Wiseman scored his first goal of the season, in a 4–2 win over Colchester United on 4 October 2014. Wiseman then scored his second goal of the season, in a 1–1 draw against MK Dons on 13 December 2014.

Wiseman went on to finish the 2015–16 season, making twenty-nine appearances in all competition.

In the 2016–17 season, Wiseman continued to compete with Clark over a right-back position in the first team and made his return to training in the pre-season. Wiseman made his first appearance since returning from injury, coming on as a late substitute, in a 3–1 win against Bristol Rovers in the opening game of the season. Wiseman then provided an assist for Josh Morris, who scored a hat-trick, in a 4–1 win over Walsall on 27 September 2016, followed up by scoring his first goal for the club in the next game and set up a winning goal for Morris, in a 2–1 win over Bury.
