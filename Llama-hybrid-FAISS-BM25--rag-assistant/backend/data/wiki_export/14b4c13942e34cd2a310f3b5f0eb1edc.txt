Episode list

Season 1
In the original 2006 broadcast of the first season, which aired in Japan between April 2 and July 2, 2006, the episodes were aired in a nonlinear order, with the six episodes making up the first novel's storyline intermixed with episodes based on chapters from various points in the light novels. In the next episode previews, two different numbers for the following episode are given: one number from Haruhi, who numbers the episodes according to where they fit chronologically in the plot, and one number from Kyon, who numbers the episodes in the order in which they aired. The sole exception is episode twelve, which is both the twelfth episode aired and the twelfth episode chronologically, a fact Kyon mentions in the preview. For the DVD releases, "The Adventures of Mikuru Asahina Episode 00" is used as the first episode, but otherwise the episodes follow the chronological order. In the 2009 re-airing, the series was aired in full chronological order, with episodes from the second season mixed in with the first season's episodes based on their chronology. In this airing, the first season's episodes were taken from the DVD editions, featuring visual edits and dialogue changes not featured in the original broadcast.
