History 
The area of Bogatić was inhabited in the early Neolithic, with evidence of finds from the Starčevo culture present throughout the area, dated to around 5000 B.C. Finds from the Vinča culture dated around 3800 B.C. to 3000 B.C. were found in the area as well.

The area was settled by the Scordisci, who were responsible for founding the city of Singidon (present-day Belgrade). During Roman rule, many settlements have been founded in the area, as evidenced by fragments of bricks and roof tiles found dating from that era.

The name of the town, Bogatić, was first mentioned during the Habsburg rule in Serbia from 1718 to 1739, with 44 families living in the town. Among the 75 settlements recorded in the Mačva at that time, Bogatić had the largest population. During the first Serbian uprising, Bogatić was the administrative center in Mačva. In 1818, the census recorded 201 houses in the village.

During the rule of Prince Miloš, administrative reforms were enacted throughout Mačva. An urban road complex and significant urban planning were implemented.

Bogatić suffered significant population decline as a result of the Balkan Wars. In 1914, during World War I, Austro-Hungarian soldiers entered the village, committing massacres against the civilian population. The village and its surroundings were stages of fierce battles. The city was liberated several times during the war. In 1924, it was declared a municipality. The building of the Municipal Hall, which originally served as the building of the Srez Administration, was constructed from 1929 to 1934.

During World War II, the village was occupied by Nazi Germany. In mid-July 1941, a partisan detachment sought to liberate the village and nearby cities and towns was formed. On August 7 of the same year, which was market day, the detachment attacked and occupied the village. Three peasant wagons loaded with weapons and ammunition were sent into the village accompanied by partisans disguised as peasants. When they arrived, the partisans immediately seized the hidden weapons and shocked the local patrol, who surrendered without resistance. Bogatić was soon liberated and all political prisoners were released from prison. Immediately after the liberation, an assembly was held in the town center wherein the detachment commander spoke. After the assembly, many villagers volunteered as partisans.

The liberation constituted a major political success for the partisans, as news of the liberation emboldened the partisans in Mačva and in occupied Serbia, and it made the village one of the centers of the revolution. A monument was erected downtown, signifying the liberation of the town from Nazi control and in honor of the partisans who participated in the liberation.
