Now That I've Found You: A Collection is an album by Alison Krauss, released in 1995.  It is a retrospective of the early part of Krauss' recording career.  It includes songs that appeared on her solo albums, albums by Alison Krauss & Union Station, and some that appeared on an album by Alison Krauss & the Cox Family.  It also contains some new material, including a cover version of "Oh, Atlanta," originally recorded by Bad Company in 1979.

The album features the hit country single "When You Say Nothing at All" and sold over two million copies, earning double platinum RIAA certification. The title single "Baby, Now That I've Found You" won the Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance and "When You Say Nothing at All" was named Single of the Year by the Country Music Association. The latter organization had originally nominated it in the category of Best Country Album, but withdrew the nomination in favor of Patty Loveless' When Fallen Angels Fly. This was because the Country Music Association determined that Now That I've Found You: A Collection did not meet the nomination's criterion for consisting of at least 60 percent original material.
