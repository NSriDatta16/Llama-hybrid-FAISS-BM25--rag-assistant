White Plains were a British pop music group that existed from 1969 to 1976. They had an ever-changing line-up of musicians and five UK hit singles, all on the Deram Records label, in the early 1970s.

The spinoff of the one hit wonder group The Flower Pot Men, White Plains’ first hit came in 1970 with “My Baby Loves Lovin'”. Their later successful songs include “I’ve Got You on My Mind”, “Lovin’ You Baby”, “Julie, Do Ya Love Me”, “When You Are a King” and “Step Into a Dream”. After “When You Are a King” peaked at number four in Northern Ireland, the group would not release a chart-worthy song for another two years, until they released “Step Into a Dream”. 

White Plains disbanded in 1976, but was reformed on three occasions: briefly in 1978, again for a two year run from 2004 to 2006, and finally for a summer tour in 2013. White Plains is also known for being one of the groups Tony Burrows recorded a series of one-hit wonder songs with.

History

1969–1970: Transition from The Flower Pot Men to White Plains
White Plains evolved from the late 1960s pop/psychedelic band the Flower Pot Men, composed of Tony Burrows, Pete Nelson, and Robin Shaw together with Neil Landon (who went to Fat Mattress). The band was primarily a studio project led by John Carter. 

The last single of the Flower Pot Men for Deram Records was composed by Roger Greenaway and Roger Cook and was an attempt at a hit single in the style of the then popular Love Affair called "In a Moment of Madness", that featured Pete Nelson on lead vocals.  The single did not chart and for the next single the band's name was changed to White Plains.  The band's songs were mainly produced and written by Greenaway and Roger Cook. With idea of having White Plains be a professional band, all but Landon were on board to do so, as he would leave to form Fat Mattress.

1970: My Baby Loves Lovin’ fame 
White Plains released several hit songs, starting off with 1970's "My Baby Loves Lovin'" (number 13 on the US charts and number 4 in Canada). The group's top-selling song "My Baby Loves Lovin'", was recorded on 26 October 1969, and was released on 2 January 1970 on the Decca Records imprint, Deram Records. The song has been featured on many CDs, including a White Plains compilation. The full-length album version of "My Baby Loves Lovin'" has never been featured on any CD. During early 1970, Ricky Wolff was unable to attend concerts or television appearances, meaning Roger Greenaway would usually step in as lead singer. Of the groups many appearances on Top of the Pops, only one, a performance of My Baby Loves Lovin’ on 26 February 1970, is known to have survived the BBC’s Wiping process; in this performance, and their first appearance on the show two weeks prior, Greenaway can be seen in Wolff’s place as lead singer.

"My Baby Loves Lovin'" vocals controversy 
There is some debate over who sang lead vocals on the song. It was believed for many years that session singer Tony Burrows was the lead vocalist on the track; however, various sources have claimed that band member Ricky Wolff was the lead. When the tune was released, an article appeared in which the band were keen to announce that the lead vocals were performed by Wolff; but it has also been stated that Wolff and Burrows sang dual lead. According to the liner notes of the group's compilation album The Deram Records Singles Collection: "Contrary to popular myth, we are assured that the lead vocals were performed by Ricky Wolff, with Tony Burrows doubling him on the chorus". 

Roger Greenaway has also confirmed that Ricky Wolff was lead vocals on "My Baby Loves Lovin'", in an official letter, written and signed by him.

A promotional film of "My Baby Loves Lovin'" features bassist Robin Shaw as lead singer, miming over Wolff’s vocals.

1970–1973: New personnel changes and minor hits 
White Plains' second single, "I've Got You on My Mind", which featured Nelson on lead vocals, was a UK hit, reaching number 17.

In mid 1970, backing band members Roger Hills and Robin Box were added to the line-up. This new personnel of Wolff, Nelson, Box, Shaw, and Hills would become their most recognisable line-up, as well as the line-up that preceded Wolff's departure in late 1971, that included newcomer Ron Reynolds on organ and keyboard. From the spring to the autumn of 1970, Scottish musician Brian Johnston (born 3 March 1945, Bathgate, Scotland) (not to be confused with the AC/DC singer), was a keyboardist for the group.

"Lovin' You Baby" reached number 35 in Canada in mid to late 1970. White Plains kept changing their line-up during a relatively short existence.

The White Plains line-up of Wolff, Nelson, Box, Shaw, Hills, and Johnston, as well as Burrows’ new group Brotherhood of Man, performed at the NME Poll Winners concert on 3 May 1970.

One of their next big charting songs was 1971's "When You Are a King" (number 13 on the UK Singles Chart) that was translated to Hebrew and covered by the Israeli singer, Shlomo Artzi. When You Are A King has been covered by a large numbers of acts in the following years.

1973–1976: Step into a Dream and disbandment 
The 1973 hit "Step into a Dream" was used in the British television commercials for Butlins' holiday camps. Step into a Dream peaked at number 21 in the United Kingdom, and was a top 10 in Ireland, landing at number 9. Their sudden burst into the limelight again gave the group new appearances on television, including Top of the Pops, their first appearance on the show in nearly two years. In late 1973, Shaw left the group and was subsequently replaced by Edison Lighthouse member David Kerr-Clemenson (born 1951).

With a line-up of Pete Nelson (vocals), Ron Reynolds (keyboard), Robin Box (guitar), Roger Hills (drums), Tex Marsh (percussions), Dave Fulford (guitar) and Tony Sullivan (bass), White Plains disbanded in 1976.

Reunions 
In 1978, Pete Nelson and Robin Box briefly reformed the group to record two more singles for PVK records.

A reformed version containing Roger Hills, Shaw and Box was active from 2004 to 2006. In the Spring of 2013, another reunion took place with Tony Burrows, Robin Shaw, and Roger Hills.

Former members later lives 

Burrows and Shaw met again in 1974 in First Class, another John Carter project that scored worldwide with their single, "Beach Baby". As of 2023, Burrows remains active as a solo artist.

David Kerr-Clemenson joined rock group Fast Buck in 1975, and toured with them for another thirty-nine years. 

Ricky Wolff would work as a session musician and produce a few albums in his own groups, he returned to his country of origin, South Africa, some time in the late 1970s and produced a few solo singles in 1981. Wolff would go on to work as a record producer and in 2013, released the single “Goodbye Nelson Mandela”, in tribute to the South African president Nelson Mandela who had passed away at the time. On 1 October 2023, Wolff died in South Africa, at the age of 78. A speaker at Wolff’s funeral gave his cause of death as septicaemia.

From 1988 to 2002, Robin Shaw and Robin Box were members of Cliff Bennett and the Rebel Rousers.

Julian Bailey died in July 2001, aged 58. Pete Nelson retired from the music industry in the late 1970s. He died on 23 October 2005 aged 62 from cancer. Neil Landon moves to Germany and sang as a solo artist. He died on 26 March 2020 aged 78, also from cancer.

Crucible 
In 1971, a music project began production in London. The project contained many members of White Plains; those being Ricky Wolff, Robin Shaw, and Robin Box, and later Julian Bailey. Several tracks were recorded at AIR Studios in London under the production of Roger Cook. The songs were shelved after being deemed not commercial enough by the production company and an album was never released. In late 1971, filmmakers Tony Klinger and Michael Lytton, searching for music for an upcoming documentary, visited several publishing companies and overall publishers on Denmark Street, one of them being Dick James, who had recently acquired Cookaway Music. Three of Ricky Wolff’s tracks were included on the documentaries soundtrack, along with one by Robin Shaw.

A few additional songs were recorded at Morgan Studios and involved former White Plains drummer, Julian Bailey. At some point, the decision was made to combine the recording at AIR, with the ones recorded at Morgan Studios into one and was given the name Crucible. The soundtrack, was originally released on LP in 1972. On 7 April 2017, the soundtrack was released for the first time on Compact Disc.

Members

Member history 
The first line-up of White Plains consisted of Ricky Wolff, Tony Burrows, Pete Nelson, and Robin Shaw. Burrows left in early 1970 to focus more on his works with Brotherhood of Man and Edison Lighthouse. In mid 1970, Brian Johnston, Robin Box and Roger Hills joined on keyboard, guitar and drums respectively. Johnston left after a few months, and Ron Reynolds joined in 1971, giving the group their most well known line-up. Wolff left the group in late 1971, and lead vocals were now split between members. The following two years would contain the stable member line-up of Shaw, Nelson, Box, Reynolds, and Hills. When Shaw left in late 1973, he was briefly replaced by Derek Burgess (later member of Vanity Fare), before he was succeeded by David Kerr-Clemenson, and then Tony Sullivan. Also in 1973, Dave Fulford, Tex Marsh were added into the band. With Pete Nelson and Robin Box the longest serving and original member, the group ended in 1976. 

In 1978, Nelson and Box recreated White Plains to release a few new singles under, although it is not known if any other musicians were in this brief line-up, and if so, were likely left uncredited. The two revivals of the group in the 2000s contained Burrows, Shaw, Box, and Hills.
