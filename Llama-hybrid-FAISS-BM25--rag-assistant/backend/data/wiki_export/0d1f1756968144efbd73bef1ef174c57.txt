After fighting his way back from injury, Tom picked up where he left off in the 2009–10 season enjoying his best run in the team in central midfield under Lee Clark during the 2009–10 campaign.

His first start of the season came in the club's 2–2 draw away at Notts County on 2 January 2012. Clarke became the club's starting left back during the third quarter of the season due to injured Gary Naysmith March and April 2012 until he was himself pushed out of the team by Calum Woods. Clarke was though used during the latter stages of the season in his more familiar role in the midfield mostly being used as a substitute. He played in both legs of Huddersfield's play-off semi final against MK Dons coming on as a 51st-minute substitute for left back Callum Woods in the first leg way at Stadium MK which Huddersfield won 2–0, and was an 88th-minute sub for winger Kallum Higginbotham in the second leg at home as Huddersfield progressed to the final.
