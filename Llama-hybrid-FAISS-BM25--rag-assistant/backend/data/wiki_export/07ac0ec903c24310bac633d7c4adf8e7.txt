History

The municipality of Nordli was established on 1 July 1915 when the old municipality of Lierne was split in two parts: Nordli (population: 863) in the north and Sørli (population: 739) in the south. The old municipality of Lierne had been created on 1 January 1874 when it was separated from the large municipality of Snåsa. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the neighboring municipalities of Sørli (population: 898) and Nordli (population: 1,147) were reunited to once again form the municipality of Lierne.

Name
The municipal name is named after the old name for the region () which means "mountainside" (similar to the Norwegian word ). Historically, the prefix Finna- was often added to the name: . This prefix is the plural genitive case of  which means "Sami person" (or Finn) because the district was historically populated by Sami people prior to the arrival of ethnic Norwegians. Later, the prefix was dropped and the definite plural form of li was used, Lierne. In 1915, the old municipality was divided into two parts: Nordli and Sørli. The names of these new municipalities came from the older name. The definite singular form of the name was used, , and the prefix  was added to show that this was the northern part of Li.
