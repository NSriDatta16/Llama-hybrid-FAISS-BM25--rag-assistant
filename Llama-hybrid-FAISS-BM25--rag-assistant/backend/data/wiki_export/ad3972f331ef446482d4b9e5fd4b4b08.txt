Corinne Cole (born Corinne Elaine Kegley; April 13, 1937, Brentwood, California) is an American model and actress. She was briefly known as Lari Laine early in her career.

Biography
Cole was born and raised in Brentwood, California, the daughter of Alice Polk Kegley, a descendant of President James Knox Polk and former Ziegfeld Girl, and Carl S. Kegley, a criminal-trial attorney. She studied journalism at the University of California at Berkeley. She was Playboy magazine's Playmate of the Month for the May 1958 issue, with her centerfold photographed by Ron Vogel.  According to The Playmate Book, Corinne Cole used a pseudonym for her Playboy appearance because her father was considering running for Congress and she didn't want to disrupt those plans.

In 1968, Cole married her first husband, Sands Hotel boss Jack Entratter; they divorced a few years later. In 1972, she married Roger Heffron; they had a child and divorced in 1980. In 1990, she married her third husband, director George Sidney, with whom she worked on the 1966 film The Swinger. He died in 2002 after 12 years of marriage to Cole.
