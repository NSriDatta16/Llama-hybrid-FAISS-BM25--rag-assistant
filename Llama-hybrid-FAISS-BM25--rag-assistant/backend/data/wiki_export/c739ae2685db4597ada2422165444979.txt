The black marlin (Istiompax indica) is a species of marlin found in tropical and subtropical areas of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Reaching lengths of over , it is one of the largest marlins and also one of the largest bony fish. Marlin are among the fastest fish, but speeds may be exaggerated in popular media, such as reports of . One recent research based on muscle contraction time and stride length suggests a burst speed of  is near the maximum rate.(this study does not measure actual swim speed) Black marlin are fished commercially and are also a highly prized game fish. Black marlins have been known to drag Maldivian fishing boats of the ancient times for very long distances until it got tired; and then it would take many hours for the fishermen to row or sail back home.

Taxonomy
French naturalist Georges Cuvier described the black marlin in 1832 as Tetrapturus indicus.

Description
Compared to striped or white marlins and sailfish, black marlins are more solid than their blue counterparts. They have a shorter bill and a rounder and lower dorsal fin. Black marlin may be distinguished from all other marlin species by their rigid pectoral fins, which, especially from a weight of around , are unable to be pressed flat against their sides but can be tilted further backwards for reduced drag.  The maximum published length is , and the maximum weight is , possibly up to .

Distribution
The species occurs in the tropical and subtropical Indo-Pacific, with uncommon movements into temperate waters, and rare reports from the Atlantic.

Diet 
Diet mostly consists of various fish and cephalopods. They may eat tuna, mackerel, snake mackerel, flying fish, squid, crustaceans, octopus, etc.
