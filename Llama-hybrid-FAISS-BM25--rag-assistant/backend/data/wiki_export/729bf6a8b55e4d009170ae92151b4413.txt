Reshteh (), from the Persian word for thread or string, refers to a very fine noodle similar to capellini (angel hair pasta).  However, it generally means a fresh (as opposed to dry) ribbon shaped egg noodle.  It was passed from China to Persia through the Silk Road travels throughout Asia. Traditionally the noodle would be a homemade and cut item. Noodles are used for special occasion dishes in giving thanks and for journeys especially to Mecca. Typical preparation is for the noodles to broken into parts, fried or grilled brown and then added to rice. 

The reshteh used currently in the Iranian cuisine is actually a thicker type of noodle, used in reshteh polow and also a type of ash, called Ash Reshteh.
