Leung Hin-ming took up his role as the 2nd Editor-in-chief of the Editorial Board, introducing more life elements in the publication and developing "Freshman Special Edition". The amount and quality of the later publications varied. The operational transparency and exposure were relatively low. In Year 2015 to 2016, the Editorial Board granted the statutory authority of independence. However, the designate cabinet came to dismissal at that time.

The programmes feature a wide spectrum of topics including arts, science, social sciences, business administration, education, information technology, child development and psychology as well as Chinese history and culture. They are either produced by the OUHK or purchased from the Open University of the UK or the China Central Radio and TV University.

In October 2015, the OUHK and Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB) once again made a joint effort to launch Open for Learning, the educational TV programme airing on TVB Pearl from 9 am to 1 pm every Sunday morning. The programme has been continuously brought to the public, enlightening not only students, but everyone in Hong Kong.
