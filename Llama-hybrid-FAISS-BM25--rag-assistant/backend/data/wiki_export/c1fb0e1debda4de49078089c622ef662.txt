Church
The parish church is dedicated to St Hermes and has a very unusual tower which was originally  high and was built in the 14th/15th centuries. The upper part was brought down by explosives in the 1880s, but it was not properly capped until 1956 and now stands  high. The church is in the Lann Pydar joint benefice with: St Eval Church, St Mawgan Church and St Columba's Church, St Columb Major.  The church was supported by the Arundell family who lived at the manor of Trembleath as early as 1240.

The English poet, Sir John Betjeman mentioned the church in his poem "Summoned by Bells" (1960), chapter VIII.
