The 2006 Copa Sudamericana de Clubes, officially the 2006 Copa Nissan Sudamericana de Clubes for sponsorship reasons, was an international football championship competition that was played by 34 teams in total, including 31 CONMEBOL teams and also three invited teams from CONCACAF.

Pachuca won their first title in history after defeating Colo-Colo tying 1–1 in the first leg in Mexico, and winning 2–1 in Chile. Pachuca only lost one game in the tournament, against Colombian Deportes Tolima 2–1 in their debut.

This was the second time a Mexican club reached the final, after UNAM lost the 2005 edition to Boca Juniors. Meanwhile, this was also the first time a Chilean club arrived to a final since the tournament's inauguration in 2002.

Also, this was the first time a Mexican (or CONCACAF) representative won the Copa Sudamericana or any CONMEBOL-sanctioned tournament.
