The station continues to be staffed entirely by volunteers.

In November 2021 the Federal Communications Commission granted a construction permit to KOSW for a power and license class upgrade. After several modifications to the original application, the station currently has a construction permit to upgrade from 76 watts ERP @ 35 meters on 91.3 to full service status and an ERP of 1.2 kW @ 120 meters on 88.9 with a directional antenna. When completed, this upgrade should improve KOSW's coverage dramatically.
