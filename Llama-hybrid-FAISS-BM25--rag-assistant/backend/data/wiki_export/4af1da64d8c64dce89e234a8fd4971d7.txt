The Irish Mail was a named train in the United Kingdom that operated from London Euston via the West Coast and North Wales Coast lines to Holyhead from 1848 until 2002, connecting with ferry services to Dublin.

History

The first Irish Mail was operated by the London & North Western Railway on 1 August 1848. It was subsequently operated by the London, Midland & Scottish Railway, British Rail, InterCity and Virgin Trains. As the Britannia Bridge had yet to be completed, the first services terminated at Bangor and recommenced at Llanfairpwllgwyngyll. It operated twice daily in each direction, although this was reduced to daily during World War II.

Although notionally an express service, with the electrification of the West Coast Main Line, from the 1960s, the service stopped for a locomotive change at Crewe.

Although the service continued to operate, the name was dropped in June 2002 as part of a policy by Virgin Trains not to operate named trains.
