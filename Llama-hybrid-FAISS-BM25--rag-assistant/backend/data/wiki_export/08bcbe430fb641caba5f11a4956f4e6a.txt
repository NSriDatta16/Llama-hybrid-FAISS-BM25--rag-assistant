Vampirates: Demons of the Ocean is a children's novel by British author Justin Somper about two young siblings who get separated at sea and are picked up by two very different ships.

Background
Justin Somper first had the idea for the book "five years before and gave up [his] full-time job to pursue it". He notes that "Vampirates is set in the future, although it feels rather like the past."
Somper states that in the novel, the character of Grace discovers that the notion of who is the enemy is often defined by one's perspective or by "lack of information, or misinformation".

Synopsis
The year is 2505. The oceans have risen. A new era of piracy is dawning.
After their father dies, Connor and Grace Tempest find that there is no place for them to go, so they set out into the sea. A vicious storm separates them, destroying their boat and leaving them fighting for their lives in the cold water.
Picked up by one of the more notorious pirate ships, the Diablo, Connor soon finds himself wielding a cutlass. But does he have the stomach to be a pirate?
Grace ends up aboard a more mysterious ship of vampire pirates, the Nocturne. As it turns out, most of the vampires are quite nice... except for Sidorio.
