The Bristol Boat Race (also called The Varsity Boat Race) is an annual event between the University of the West of England (UWE) and the University of Bristol, held on the historic Bristol Harbour, Bristol, England. It is usually held in the summer term after the Easter break, often the week before, or the week after British Universities and Colleges Regatta, although in the first years of the event was often held in February. Founded in 1995, it has been claimed to be the second oldest university Boat Race in the United Kingdom, after The Boat Race between Oxford and Cambridge, although the Scottish Boat Race between Glasgow and Edinburgh universities dates back to 1877.

In the early years of the event the University of Bristol dominated, but in recent years UWE has become a much greater force and the event has become hotly contested. It has become instrumental in improving the calibre of both boat clubs, of which are now regarded as two highly competitive university rowing institutions in the United Kingdom.

The Course 

The course runs from the Cumberland Basin towards the Bristol City Centre and finishes  later at Canon's Wharf Amphitheatre. Several course changes have been proposed in recent years, due to the nature of the bends providing each side with significant advantages at different stages of the course.

The Race 

The Coin toss/Presidents Slap is a tradition by which the winning university from the previous year challenge the losing university to the years race, it also decides the banks each crew will race on.

-All competing crews are required to attend the weigh in, usually held the day before or on the day of Varsity. This gives the opportunity for the crews to face off against their opposite number before the race.

-Depending on the university intake each year, Each University will field the following crews
 Men's 1st VIII
 Men's 2nd VIII/IV
 Women's 1st VIII
 Women's 2nd VIII/IV
 Men's Novice 1&2nd VIII's
 Women's Novice 1&2nd VIII's
 Men's & Women's Allumni VIII's
However this is subject to change, in accordance to both universities requirements.
