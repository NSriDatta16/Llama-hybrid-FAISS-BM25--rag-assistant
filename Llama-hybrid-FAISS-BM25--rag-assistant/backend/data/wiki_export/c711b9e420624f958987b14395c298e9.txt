History

The Monte Ahuja College of Business was first formed as the Nance College of Business, named for James J. Nance, a Cleveland industrialist who served as the university's first chairman of the board of trustees. At the onset, it was an applied vocational school, and was housed in World War II-era Quonset huts, without any permanent building on campus.

In 1970, the college was renamed to the James J. Nance College of Business Administration. In 2011, it was again renamed, to the Monte Ahuja College of Business, after former CSU Board of Trustees Chair, Monte Ahuja. Ahuja had donated $10 million to the school, the largest donation in the Universityâ€™s 47-year history.
