Despite Leicester being relegated straight back to the Football League Championship, Nalis stayed with the team.  His only goal in the Premiership for City was one of his best, scoring against Leeds United with a smashing 25 yard volley in 2003.

Nalis was voted the fans player of the year for the 2006–7 season and signed a one-year extension to his contract.

It was announced in April 2008 that Nalis, would be released by Plymouth Argyle, when his contract expires in June.

On 31 July 2008, Nalis signed for Swindon following a brief trial.

After his final season in England, Nalis returned to France, by signing for the Corsica-based side of CA Bastia.

Coaching career
