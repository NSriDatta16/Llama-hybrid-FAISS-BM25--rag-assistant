Franciszek Żmurko (18 July 1859, Lviv – 9 October 1910, Warsaw) was a Polish realist painter. Żmurko began drawing lessons as a young boy in his hometown with the painter Franciszek Tepa. As an adolescent he relocated to Kraków to study at the Academy of Fine Arts where he took lessons from Professor Jan Matejko. In 1877 Żmurko moved to Vienna, Austria where he was accepted at the Vienna Academy, but left soon thereafter to study under Alexander von Wagner in Munich. Żmurko returned to Kraków in 1880 and then moved to Warsaw in 1882 where he remained until his death in 1910.
