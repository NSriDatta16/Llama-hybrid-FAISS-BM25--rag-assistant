The Catholic Church in Algeria is part of the worldwide Catholic Church, under the spiritual leadership of the Pope in Rome.

Prior to independence, Algeria was home to a million Catholic settlers (10%). Some Moroccans of Berber (mostly Kabyle) or Arab descent converted to Christianity during the French colonialism. Since independence in 1962, the European Catholic population has decreased substantially, and many Catholics left to France or Spain. Prior to independence, the European Catholic settlers had historic legacy and powerful presence. Independence prompted a mass exodus of the European Catholic settlers; after series of violence events over 1962 more than 80% of Catholic settlers left the country.

21st century
In 2020, Catholics made up 0.01-0.02% of the country's population;  there were 62 priests and 116 nuns serving across 30 parishes.

In 2022, the Catholic Church noted that they were able to carry out religious services and prison visits without interference from the authorities.

The country is divided into four Latin dioceses, including one archdiocese with two suffragan dioceses and one exempt diocese (ie immediately subject to the Holy See.)

During French colonial rule, the Catholic population of Algeria peaked at over one million, but most of these left following Algeria's independence in 1962. There were about 45,000 Catholics residing in the country in the 1980's.
