Charles Gifford (February 24, 1821 â€“ 20 April 1896) was an Ontario political figure. He represented Northumberland West in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario as a Conservative member from 1872 to 1874.

Gifford was born in Exmouth, Devon, England in 1821. He was educated at Mount Radford School in Exeter, University College School in London and the University of London. He studied law and was called to the English bar in 1846. He served as captain in the local militia, later becoming colonel. He was elected to the provincial legislature in a by-election called in 1872 after the resignation of Alexander Fraser, the sitting member. He was defeated in the general election held in 1875. That same year, Gifford sponsored the building of a sailing ship built in Cobourg, the Countess of Dufferin, that raced in the America's Cup in 1876.

He died at Hamilton Township, Northumberland in 1896.
