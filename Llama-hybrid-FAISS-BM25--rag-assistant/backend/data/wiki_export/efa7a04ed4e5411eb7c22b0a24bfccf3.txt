The Bishop of Brechin is a title held successively, since  c. 1150:  (firstly) by bishops of the Catholic church until the Reformation of 1560;  (secondly) by bishops of the Church of Scotland until that church declared itself presbyterian in 1689;  and (thirdly) by bishops of the Scottish Episcopal Church since then.
The seat of the bishops of Brechin until 1689 was Brechin Cathedral which then became the High Kirk of Brechin in the (now presbyterian) Church of Scotland (although still often referred to as Brechin Cathedral). That building ceased to function as a place of worship in November 2021.
The current bishop of Brechin leads the Diocese of Brechin in the Scottish Episcopal Church, with its cathedral in Dundee.
