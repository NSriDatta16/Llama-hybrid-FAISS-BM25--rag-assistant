Parasites are an American pop-punk band.  They were formed in the late 1980s by guitarist / singer Dave Parasite and bassist Ron Nole in New Jersey. Dave later relocated to Berkeley, California, and continued with a new lineup during the heyday of Lookout! Records and the Bay Area pop-punk revival.

Parasites have been releasing records since 1987 and toured the US, Europe and Japan extensively. They have played with Green Day, Rancid, NOFX, Bad Religion, Buzzcocks, Jawbreaker, The Queers, Lunachicks, Fear, The Adicts, Channel 3, Dayglo Abortions, JFA, Good Riddance, Street Dogs, Teenage Bottlerocket, The Mr. T Experience, The Smoking Popes, Dillinger 4, The Ataris, Swingin' Utters, Weston, Ben Weasel, The Ergs, The Methadones, The Lillingtons, Squirtgun, D.O.A., The Vibrators, Los Crudos, Sloppy Seconds, Dan Vapid and the Cheats, Voodoo Glow Skulls, Down By Law, Avail, J Church, Travoltas, The Apers, Sonic Dolls, Banner Pilot, Iron Chic, Boris The Sprinkler, FYP, Lemuria, Masked Intruder, and thousands of other bands.

After taking a break in 2003, the band reunited in 2006 to release Retro-Pop Remasters , a "Best Of" compilation, on Go Kart Records. It was promoted with a US tour in November 2006 with the Ergs!. They appeared at Insubordination Fest in 2008. They have seen released new albums: "Solitary" in 2009, and "Non Stop Power Pop" in 2012, both on Kid Tested Records, Dave Parasite's imprint label of Go Kart Records, as well as many other releases.
