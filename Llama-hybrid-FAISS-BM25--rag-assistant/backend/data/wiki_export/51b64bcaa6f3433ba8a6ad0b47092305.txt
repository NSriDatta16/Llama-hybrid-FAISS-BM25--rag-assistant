Career
Piller Cottrer's first relevant success in the cross-country skiing world cup came in 1997, when he won the 50 km race at the Holmenkollen Ski Festival. In the same year he won the bronze medal with the Italian relay at the 1997 World Championships in Trondheim. Thanks to Piller Cottrer's presence, the Italian relay confirmed as one of the best in the world winning silver medal in the 2002 Winter Olympics and, better, to gold medal in the home Olympics of Turin. He also won an Olympic bronze medal in the 15 + 15 km pursuit.

His successes include a World Championship gold medal in the 15 km freestyle pursuit at the 2005 World Championships, and a total of seven victories in the World Cup. The latest in Vancouver 2009.

Piller Cottrer won a bronze medal in the 15 km + 15 km double pursuit at the 2007 World Championships in Sapporo.

At the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver Piller Cottrer skied a 34:00.9 in the 15 km freestyle event and won the silver medal. In February 2013, Piller Cottrer announced his retirement.
