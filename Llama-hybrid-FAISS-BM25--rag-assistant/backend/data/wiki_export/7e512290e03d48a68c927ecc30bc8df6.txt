History
Al Wakrah was founded in 1959, and was officially legitimized in 1965 under the name of Al Wakrah Youth Club. From that time, its football and handball sections were formed, with both participating in local competitions. It later changed its name to Al Wakrah Sports Club in 1967. Over the years, it branched out to many sports, including chess, basketball, and bowling.

The original club headquarters at Al Wakrah Stadium was constructed in 1984, and tennis and squash teams were also formed during this time in addition to its previously formed sports teams. They won the Qatari league twice, once in 1999 and again in 2001.

The new club headquarters is Al Janoub Stadium, inaugurated in 2019 as one of the FIFA World Cup 2022 Qatar sites and was designed by Zaha Hadid.

Fanbase

A fan group instagram account dedicated for the club's supporters was created in 2022 and was popularised during the world cup period as Argentinian fans shared the club's colors and decided to support the club during its matches before the break.

Al Wakrah fans are mainly people who grew up supporting the club due to their love for the city of Al Wakrah.
With a small but loyal fanbase Al Wakrah continues to dominate games and cause huge upsets in the league.
