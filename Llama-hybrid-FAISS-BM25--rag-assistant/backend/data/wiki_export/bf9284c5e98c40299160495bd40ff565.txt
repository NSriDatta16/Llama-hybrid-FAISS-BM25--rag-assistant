NASCAR career

Sprint Cup Series
Hubert made his first Winston Cup race in his first attempt with Jim Wilson's #78 team at Sears Point during the 1997 season. He would bring the #78 Hanes / Diamond Rio Ford home in the 28th position, one lap down. His next start would come in 1998 with the #19 team owned by Kurt Roehrig. He qualified an impressive 10th in his second race at Sears Point, however the #19 Bradford White Ford would finish 41st after a transmission failure 78 laps into the race. His second start during the 1998 season would come at Watkins Glen with Dan Marino and Bill Elliott's #13 team. Hubert drove the #13 FirstPlus Financial Ford to a 36th-place finish. He would return to Roehrig's team in 1999 for three races. His first start would come at Las Vegas where he qualified fourth, finishing in the 28th position. Again, Hubert raced at Sears Point where he would finish in the 33rd position, one lap down. He also attempted the Pepsi 400 at Michigan, however he was unable to qualify. In 2000, he would make one start with Penske Racing and the #12 Mobil 1 Ford. He would finish the Global Crossing @ The Glen in 33rd place after starting 16th. In 2001, Hubert qualified Buckshot Jones' #44 Georgia Pacific Dodge for the Dodge/Save Mart 350. In 2002, he would race the Sirius Satellite Radio at the Glen for Bill Davis Racing. Hubert finished the #23 Hills Brothers Coffee Dodge in the 24th position after starting 40th. He would return to the series in 2004 with Kirk Shelmerdine Racing, driving each of the road courses. At the newly renamed Infineon Raceway (formerly Sears Point Raceway) he would finish 43rd in the #72 Freddie B's Ford after running five laps at too slow of a pace for NASCAR. The Watkins Glen would be much better for Hubert as he would finish in the 29th position just one lap down. He would return to Shelmerdine's team for 2005 and attempt each of the road courses. He would make the race at Infineon, however he finished 43rd after oil pressure problems. Hubert would not make the Sirius at The Glen after qualifying was rained out. Hubert again raced for Shelmerdine in 2006 for the Dodge/Save Mart 350, but was swept up in a crash on the opening lap and once more finished last.

Busch Series
Hubert made his first Busch Series start in 1999 with Bill Davis Racing at South Boston Speedway in the #93 Amoco Pontiac. He would start the race in the 28th position and finish in 18th place. He would attempt his second race that year with Andy Petree Racing in the #15 Chevy for the Dura Lube 200 at Darlington, however he was unable to break into the field. In 2000, Hubert would attempt ten races for BDR and make nine of them. His best finish in the #20 AT&T Pontiac would be a 21st at Myrtle Beach. He would also lead 15 laps at Watkins Glen, but would finish that race in the 37th position, many laps down. He would return to the Busch Series in 2001 with #00 team owned by Buckshot Jones' family. Hubert would drive the #00 Georgia Pacific Pontiac to a 28th-place finish at Watkins Glen. He would also make one start for Team Bristol Motorsports at Charlotte. He drove the #54 General Creations Toys Chevrolet until the car had overheating problems around lap 138, leaving him with a finish of 35th.

Craftsman Truck Series
Hubert has had the most success in the Craftsman Truck Series, scoring two top fives in fifteen races. He would make his first start in 1997 with Dana Racing at Colorado where he would finish 23rd. Hubert would race an additional four races in the #18 Dana Dodge. He dominated the 1997 Kragen / Exide 151 at Infineon Raceway only to finish second to Joe Ruttman. In 1998 he would drive five races for Phelon Motorsports in the #66 Carlin Burners & Controls Ford. His best finish was a 5th at Gateway and he was able to get a pole at Sears Point. Hubert would also drive one race for Engineered Victories Inc and finish 24th in the #89 Cyberdyne Tech Chevrolet. In 1999, he would compete in three races for Conley Racing and one race for Marty Walsh's #81 team. He had a wild ride during the 100th race in Craftsman Truck series history at Evergreen when he spun after contact from behind by David Starr through an opening in the inside wall and went into the infield. Amazingly, he didn't hit anything, but when he brought it into the pits seconds later, his brakes failed and his truck caught fire, sending him out. His best finish during the season, 17th, would come in the #7 Conely Racing Engines Chevrolet at Phoenix. He has yet to return to the Craftsman Truck Series since the 1999 season.
