The Prince of Tver () was the title of the ruler of the Principality of Tver. The princes of Tver descended from the first prince, Yaroslav Yaroslavich (). In 1485, Tver was formally annexed by Moscow and became an appanage.

History
Following the Mongol invasions, Tver became an independent principality in 1247 with Yaroslav Yaroslavich, the son of Yaroslav II of Vladimir, becoming the first prince of Tver.  During the 14th century, Tver competed with Moscow for dominance until it declined and was finally annexed by Moscow in 1485 under Ivan III. Tver was given to his son Ivan the Young as an appanage.
