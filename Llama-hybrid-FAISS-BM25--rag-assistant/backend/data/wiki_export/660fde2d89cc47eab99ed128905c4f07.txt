Pasco High School is a 9â€“12 public high school in Pasco, Washington. It was the only high school in Pasco until 2009, when Chiawana High School was opened.

In 2006, the Pasco voters approved a $90 million+ bond to construct a new high school on Argent and Road 84 to ease the overcrowding of Pasco High. The new Chiawana High School opened its doors in the fall of 2009 along Argent Road. During the time of construction, Pasco High turned Captain Gray STEM Elementary School, located at 1102 N.10th Avenue into an annex, where a majority of freshman classes were held. Once Chiawana High opened, the building once again became Captain Gray Elementary. Additionally, the school makes use of over 50 portable classrooms.

Pasco High is one of Washington state's largest high schools; it is classified as a 4A school (the classification for the largest schools in that state) with an enrollment of more than 1,800 students.

Academics 
Pasco High School has programs to train students in various occupational areas. One of these is the "Bulldog House" where students help build a house in the community and sell it, with the proceeds going towards next year's house and various scholarships. The Running Start program is offered by the school with the chance for dual enrollment open for students at Columbia Basin College, Washington State University Tri-Cities, and technical training offered at the Tri-Tech Skill Center.

The school also manages a Hispanic Academic Achievers Program (HAAP), where students and families are recognized annually for the student maintaining a 3.0 or greater GPA. Senior HAAP members also apply for substantial scholarships to college and act as role models to younger siblings making it possible for the next generation to be even more competitive in the United States.

Pasco made the Newsweek annual "Best American High Schools" list many times. This list includes the top 6% of schools in the nation. The schools are ranked according to the Challenge Index. Pasco High School placed in 2004, 2005, 2007, and 2009.

The Bulldogs were ranked 27th in the nation and had a twenty-seven game win streak during this period before losing in 2001 in the state championship versus cross-state rival Kentwood High School. Football in Pasco has been a sport of unity in the community. Games at Edgar Brown Memorial Stadium are viewed as social and community building events.

The Pasco High School Boys Soccer Team has also been extremely successful, having won two state championships in 1999 and 2007. The team has been ranked as high as third in the nation (1999) and fourth in 2007. They have made the playoffs for 14 straight years. In 2009 they were set to be first in the nation but lost the State Championship game 1-2 and dropped to 15th in the nation. The boys' basketball team won a state title in 1947.

The dance team's hip hop squad has been district champions for every year since the team was established. The team has placed third in state for hip hop for six years straight.
