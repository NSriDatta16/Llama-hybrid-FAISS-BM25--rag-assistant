Dirty data, also known as rogue data, are inaccurate, incomplete or inconsistent data, especially in a computer system or database.

Dirty data can contain such mistakes as spelling or punctuation errors, incorrect data associated with a field, incomplete or outdated data, or even data that has been duplicated in the database. They can be cleaned through a process known as data cleansing.
