Facilities
 The Media Centre is available to all students to use during breaks and after school. Besides books, there are computers connected to the Internet, printers and photocopy facilities. The school employs a full-time librarian.
 The swimming pool is 25m long and is used extensively by the school swimming and water polo teams.
 The Information Technology Centre is divided into two sections so that two classes can be accommodated at the same time. One section has 32 computers and the other 34. In 2006 a third computer room was added with 34 computers. The computers in the centre are networked, linked to high speed printers and the Internet. All students do ICDL or Computer Literacy classes in grades 8 and 9 where they learn about the parts, construction and development of the computer, the Internet, and programs.

In Grade 10 learners have the choice of doing either IT, where they learn programming, such as Java, or CAT (Computer Applications Technology) where they learn computer applications such as databases, word processors and webpage design. These subjects are done through to grade 12.

The school is a registered ICDL (International Computer Driving Licence) centre where learners and staff can be trained and tested to obtain an ICDL, an internationally recognised computer qualification.

Electrical Technology Centre
The Electrical Technology Centre is a meticulously equipped institution capable of accommodating a diverse range of disciplines as outlined in its curriculum, including Electrical (Heavy Current), Electronics (Light Current), Digital Systems, and Communication Systems. Notably, the Electrical Department places significant emphasis on the practical component, recognizing its essential role in reinforcing theoretical knowledge.

Civil Technology Centre
The institute offers dedicated facilities tailored to the distinct Civil Technology domains encompassed within its campus curriculum, encompassing Woodworking, Plumbing, and Construction.

This educational framework enables students to delve into the intricacies of architectural design and construction, facilitating an exploration of the diverse materials integral to the construction of various structures.

Mechanical Technology Centre
The introduction of the NCS document brought about a significant addition to the syllabus, in the form of a novel subject known as Mechanical Technology. This subject centered on technological processes, encompassing design, systematic problem-solving, and the practical application of scientific principles. Notably, Mechanical Technology consolidated the previously distinct subjects of Motor Mechanics, Fitting and Turning, and Technica Mechanica into a unified curriculum.

In a more recent development, the school has undertaken a diversification of its Mechanical Technology discipline. This evolution is evidenced by the reintegration of innovative and hands-on technical subjects within the Mechanical Technology framework, including Automotive Technology, Welding, and Fitting and Machining.
