University building

The university main offices are in one of the most representative city structures, an edifice built in the late 19th century, which was formally recognized as a cultural treasure of major significance in 1979.

The building was constructed in 1887, in the city center, on the right bank of the river Nisava. The building is in the neo-Renaissance style, designed by an unknown Viennese architect. It first housed the District Court, the District Government and the military headquarters and then, from July 26, 1914 to October 16, 1915, when Niš was the Serbian war capital, the building was the seat of the Serbian government and its Ministry of the Interior. The formal declaration of war was directed from Austria-Hungary on July 28, 1914 to the building.

In 1930, the building became the administrative seat of the Morava County,  after the World War II it housed the District Administration, while in 1967 it  was assigned to the permanent use to the university.

In 2008, marking the 120th anniversary of its building, the university completed construction work to enable access for persons with disabilities to all university facilities.
