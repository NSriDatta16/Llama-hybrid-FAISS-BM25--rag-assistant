Domino is an American home magazine which was in circulation between April 2005 and March 2009, and then relaunched as a print and digital magazine and ecommerce platform in October 2013.

History
Launched by Condé Nast in 2004, domino is a style magazine centered on the home. Its first issue appeared in Spring of 2005. In its first year, domino was honored by The Hot List Startup of the Year by Adweek, Top Launch of the Year by Media Industry Newsletter and The A-List 10 under 50 by Advertising Age. The magazine grew to a rate base of 800,000 by its third year, and received two National Magazine Award nominations from the American Society of Magazine Editors (ASME). In October 2008, domino released its first book, domino: the Book of Decorating, published by Simon & Schuster.

On January 28, 2009, Condé Nast announced that it would cease publication of domino and its website.  In its closing web comments, the editors reported that in a down economy advertising revenues could not keep up with expenses. In that same year Condé Nast also shuttered Modern Bride, Elegant Bride, Gourmet and Cookie.

After a hiatus of four years, domino was relaunched in 2013 by the Domino Media Group. The return of the magazine was accompanied by a new website, domino.com with the stated purpose of "bringing content, community and commerce together."

Domino Media Group was initially owned by its three founders — Andy Appelbaum, Cliff Sirlin, and Aaron Wallace, with Condé Nast retaining an interest in the brand as a minority investor. It was acquired by St. Louis–based digital media company Multiply in June 2018. Domino was sold to private equity firm North Equity in February 2021. North Equity then spun out Domino and their other digital media holdings- including Dwell and Lonny- to Recurrent Ventures in June 2021. The magazine transitioned to a fully digital publication after the acquisition, with their first digital issue released in November 2021.
