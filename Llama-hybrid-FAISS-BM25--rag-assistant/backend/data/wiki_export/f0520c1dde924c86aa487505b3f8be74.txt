Ismael Gómez Falcón (born 24 April 1984) is a Spanish former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper.

He appeared in 232 Segunda División games over ten seasons, with Hércules (two spells), Celta, Alcorcón, Córdoba and Tenerife. He added five matches in La Liga for Atlético Madrid.

Club career
Falcón was born in Cádiz, Andalusia. After beginning his football career at Cádiz CF he was signed by Atlético Madrid aged 20 to finish his development, and he eventually battled for second-choice status for two seasons with another club graduate, Iván Cuéllar, appearing in five La Liga matches in 2005–06, the first being a 1–1 away draw against Athletic Bilbao on 3 December 2005 where he replaced the injured Leo Franco; he also represented the reserves during his tenure.

After a small loan stint in the Segunda División with Hércules CF, Falcón was released (as Cuéllar) in July 2008 and joined another side at that level, RC Celta de Vigo. He continued playing in the same league afterwards, with Hércules, AD Alcorcón, Córdoba CF and CD Tenerife.

In June 2021, Falcón agreed to a one-year contract at Atlético Sanluqueño CF. A year later he moved to San Fernando CD also in the Primera Federación, retiring shortly after at 38 to become the latter's goalkeepers coach.
