Plot
The film stars Summer Phoenix as the title character, in the role of a young Jewish woman living in London with a sister who is about to marry a young Jewish man. Breaking with her secularized yet traditionally-inclined family, Suzie falls in love with the non-Jewish Darren (Leo Gregory). She fears introducing him to her family because of their opposition to intermarriage.

Cast

Reception
The BBC rated the film 3 out of 5 stars. The reviewer compared it to My Big Fat Greek Wedding and noted the influence of Woody Allen in the humour. Time Out praised Phoenix's "versatility" yet felt the central romantic union of the film lacked "conviction". The magazine continued; "More amusement derives from the old stagers of the Jewish community (including Townsend, Front and Barber) and their attitudes to sex, marriage and culture, their gossipy antics spawning some neat one liners and farcical set pieces."Total Film gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, praising Phoenix' performance and the "acutely observed local detail".

Soundtrack
The soundtrack, created by James Hyman, features an original song called "Want You More" by Sophie Ellis-Bextor.
