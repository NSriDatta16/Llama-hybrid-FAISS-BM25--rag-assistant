Route 148 is an east-west highway in Quebec, Canada. It runs from junction of Autoroute 13 and Autoroute 440 in Laval in the Montreal region to the Ontario-Quebec border in L'Isle-aux-Allumettes in western Quebec. For most of its length, Route 148 follows the north shore of the Ottawa River where it acted as the principal route between communities in the Outaouais region until the completion of Autoroute 50 in 2012. At the Ontario-Quebec border in L'Isle-aux-Allumettes Route 148 continues into Ontario as Highway 148.

In Gatineau, Route 148 is concurrent with Autoroute 50 from Maloney Boulevard until the terminus of Autoroute 50 at des Allumettières Boulevard. Route 148 then continues west on des Allumettières Boulevard towards Aylmer. Prior to the opening of des Allumettières Boulevard in 2007, Route 148 was concurrent with Autoroute 5 between the Autoroute 50 junction and Saint-Raymond Boulevard.

The section of Route 148 between Lachute and Buckingham was the only major route on the north shore of the Ottawa River between communities in the eastern Outaouais region and Gatineau and Montreal.  This section, especially the section between Masson-Angers and  Montebello, has been the site of numerous fatal accidents over the last few years. Construction of Autoroute 50 to the north of Route 148 was completed on November 26, 2012, and now provides a faster and safer route between communities in the eastern Outaouais region and Gatineau and Mirabel.

For many years Route 148 included a section of Rue Principale west of A-13 and most of Boulevard Saint-Martin in Laval.
