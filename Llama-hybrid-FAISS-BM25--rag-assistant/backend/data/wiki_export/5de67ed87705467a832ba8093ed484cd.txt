Kokborok (Tiprakok/Tripuri) is the native language of Tripuri people in present Tripura state in North East of India. During the 20th century many of Royal family and its officials contributes to develop the Kokborok language in many ways.

Historical record 

A significant hint for the antiquity of the Kokborok language can be found in the following lines in the "Rajmala", the chronicle written now in Bengali of the Kings of Tripura, which mentions that "Rajmala" was first written in Kokborok(Tiprakok):
Purbe Rajmala chhilo Tripur bhashate,
Payar Gathilo sob sokole bhujhite,
Su-bhashate Dharmaraje Rajmala Koilo,
Rajmala boliya lockete hoilo."
- Rajmala - 2nd part, Dharma Manikya Chapter, page 6.

The meaning of the quotation is - the Rajmala had been in Tripur language earlier. As ordered by the king Dharma Manikya, the chronicle was translated or written afresh in elegant language, i.e., in Bengali in the 14th century AD.

Written period 

Since the Rajmala was written there has been little written material in Kokborok and only since the end of the 19th century there has been some effort of writing the language in the written form. And from the second half of the 20th century only there has been a vigorous development process and activities for creating literature in Kokborok. The Tripura state Government had recognised Kokborok as a state language in 1979 only and since then important Govt. notifications are being published in Kokborok along with Bengali.

On 27 December 1945 AD the "Tripura Janasiksha Samiti" came into being and it established many schools in different areas of Tripura. The first Kokborok magazine "Kwtal Kothoma" was first edited and published in 1954 by Sudhanwa Debbarma, who was a founder of the Samiti.
