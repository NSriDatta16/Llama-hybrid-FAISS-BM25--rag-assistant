The Anvik River() (Yup'ik: Tuilnguq) is a  tributary of the Yukon River in the U.S. state of Alaska. It 
flows southeast from the Nulato Hills to its mouth on the larger river  north of Anvik.

The annual production of summer chum salmon along the Anvik River is thought to be the largest in the Yukon River basin. The river has excellent fishing for four species of salmon as well as northern pike, sheefish, Arctic char, rainbow trout, and grayling.

Rated Class 1 (easy) on the International Scale of River Difficulty, about  of the Anvik is suitable for floating by open canoes, folding boats and kayaks, and inflatable canoes, kayaks, and rafts. Floatplanes, riverboats, and wheeled airplanes that can land on gravel bars can transport boaters as far as McDonald Creek, near the headwaters.
