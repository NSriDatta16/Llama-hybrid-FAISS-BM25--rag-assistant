"Monday, Monday" is a 1966 song written by John Phillips and recorded by the Mamas & the Papas, using background instruments played by members of the Wrecking Crew for their 1966 album If You Can Believe Your Eyes and Ears. Denny Doherty was the lead vocalist.  It was the group's only #1 hit on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.

Background
 
Phillips said that he wrote the song quickly, in about 20 minutes. The song includes a pregnant pause before the coda, which modulates up a semitone. Succeeding "Good Lovin'" by the Young Rascals in the number one position, the event marked the first time in the history of the Billboard Hot 100 two songs with pregnant pauses were consecutive number one hits. 

On March 2, 1967, the Mamas & the Papas won a Grammy Award for this song, in the category Best Contemporary (R&R) Group Performance, Vocal Or Instrumental. In 2008 the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

The song was performed at the Monterey Pop Festival (California) in 1967. The performance was filmed for the movie of the festival, but not included in the final print.
