Ole Stenen (29 August 1903 in Øyer, Gudbrandsdal – 23 April 1975) was a Norwegian Nordic skier who competed in nordic combined and cross-country skiing in the 1920s and early 1930s.

He was born in Øyer and represented the club Øyer IL. He died in April 1975 in Oslo.

He won a Nordic combined silver at the 1932 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York. In addition, he won the 50 km cross-country event at both the 1931 World Ski Championships and the 1931 Holmenkollen ski festival. He also won silver in the Nordic combined at the 1929 World Ski Championships and finished fourth at the 1934 World Ski Championships. Because of those wins, Stenen shared the Holmenkollen medal in 1931 with fellow Norwegian Hans Vinjarengen, a fellow Nordic combined athlete.

He participated in the demonstration event, military patrol (precursor to biathlon), in the 1928 Winter Olympics.
