"Little Egypt" and Southeastern 
Southeastern Illinois College is located in an area of Southern Illinois called "Little Egypt". The name may derive from settlers seeing a similarity between their wagon trains and the ancient Israelites, or from the similarity of the Egyptian pyramids and the Mississippian mounds in the area. The college's original 1960 seal had a sphinx on it, and a later logo featured a pyramid. The college's mascot, the falcon, is related to the Egyptian god, Horus. There are many more small things that reflect "Little Egypt" on Southeastern's campus.
