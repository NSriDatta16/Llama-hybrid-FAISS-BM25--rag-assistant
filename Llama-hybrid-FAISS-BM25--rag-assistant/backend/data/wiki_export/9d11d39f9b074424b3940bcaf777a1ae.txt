History
The school opened in September 1971 as the result of the amalgamation of two of Calgary's oldest independent schools: Strathcona School for Boys (founded in 1929) and Tweedsmuir: An Academic School for Girls (founded in 1959). St. Hilda's School (1889–1949) preceded Tweedsmuir School for Girls.

In 2003, seven students from the school were killed in an avalanche in British Columbia while on a skiing trip. The students were on a school ski trip on Mount Cheops near Revelstoke when the avalanche occurred. Out of the seventeen skiers involved in the avalanche, ten were rescued. Despite the incident, Strathcona Tweedsmuir School has not abandoned its outdoor education program, which is mandatory for students in grades 4–9 and optional for grade 10-12 students.
