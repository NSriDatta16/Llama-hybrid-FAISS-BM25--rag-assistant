Thumbs! is a collective term for the O Entertainment short films created by Steve Oedekerk using "Thumbation" technology, a process which combines live-action thumbs and superimposition of the voice actors' faces. The first short, Thumb Wars, was created as a television special and spawned the rest of the series.

Each filmette is available on DVD, with exclusive extra footage on the Thumb Wars/Thumbtanic Thumb Double Feature. The entire series is available in a box set called All Thumbs, which does not include the Double Feature or The Thumbersons short.

Most of the shorts have aired on Cartoon Network, before the show or film being parodied air, such as Thumb Wars (for Star Wars: The Clone Wars) and Bat Thumb (for airings of Batman and Robin). Frankenthumb aired around Halloween 2008.

Collections
 "Thumb Wars/ Thumbtanic Thumb Double Feature" is the only double feature of Thumbs! available. It includes "Thumb Wars" and "Thumbtanic". It also comes with the exclusive short "The Thumbersons". In 2005, it was released for the PlayStation Portable's UMD Video.
 "All Thumbs!" is a boxed set containing "Thumb Wars", "Thumbtanic", "The Godthumb", "Bat Thumb", "Frankenthumb", and "Blair Thumb" on DVD. The short "The Thumbersons" was omitted. This is because the "Thumb Wars/ Thumbtanic Thumb Double Feature" wasn't included, rather two separate DVDs for the two filmettes.
