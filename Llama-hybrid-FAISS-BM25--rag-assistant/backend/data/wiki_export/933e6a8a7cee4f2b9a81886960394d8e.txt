Kid Stuff Records, also known originally as The Kid Stuff Repertory Company, was a record label founded in 1975 by Bob McAllister, Artie Kaplin, and Dick Mullen, as a children's music label. It was headquartered and located in Hollywood, Florida, United States, in the Washington Federal Building across from the Hollywood Mall.

The label's albums (including both read-along records and full-length LPs) were mostly tie-ins for franchises such as the DC Super Powers Collection, Care Bears, The Pink Panther, Strawberry Shortcake, Fat Albert, Garfield, E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial, and Masters of the Universe, along with video games such as Pac-Man, Missile Command, and Yars' Revenge. It also had a home video division called Kid Vid (not to be confused with NBC's Kidd Video).
