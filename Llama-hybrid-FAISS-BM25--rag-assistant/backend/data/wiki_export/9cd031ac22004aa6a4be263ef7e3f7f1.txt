Changes
Mayor David Crombie resigned on August 31, 1978 to contest a Federal by-election for Rosedale on October 16, 1978. On September 1, 1978 City Council met to appoint a new Mayor. The right-wingers stood Ward 8 Alderman Fred Beavis while the left-wingers stood Ward 11 Alderman Anne Johnston. When the vote was held the two candidates were tied with 11 votes each so in accordance with the Municipal Act put both names into a hat, and the name picked out of the hat would officially be pronounced interim mayor. Fred Beavis was the name chosen and he became mayor. Thomas Clifford now became Ward 8's sole Alderman and was appointed Metro Councillor on September 11.
