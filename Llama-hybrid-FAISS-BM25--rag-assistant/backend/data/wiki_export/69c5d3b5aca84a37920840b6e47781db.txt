The Iron Ladies ( or Satree lek) is a 2000 Thai comedy film directed by Youngyooth Thongkonthun and written by Visuttchai Boonyakarnjawa and Jira Maligool. It was Thongkonthun's directorial debut. The film follows the true events of a men's volleyball team, composed mainly of gay and kathoey (transgender) athletes.

In 2003, the combined sequel and prequel called The Iron Ladies 2 (Satree Lek 2) was released. The film is based upon how the characters of The Iron Ladies met, and how they would later reunite for another volleyball tournament.

Plot 

The film was released in 2000 and is set in 1996, when the real team competed and won the national championships in Thailand. The two main characters, Mon and Jung, play two gay transgender women, who had been constantly overlooked by volleyball coaches because of their appearance. However, when a local team changes coaches, the new coach holds tryouts for a new team. When Mon and Jung are selected, most of the old players resign, leaving the new coach, Coach Bee, in a sticky predicament.

Mon and Jung are then forced to enlist the help of other gay and transgender friends who they used to play volleyball with in university. These new players include Wit, who hasn't told his fiancée he is gay, Pia, a transgender dancer and Nong, a gay army conscript. When the competition begins, all but one player in the team are gay or transgender. 

Because of their appearance on court, many of the match officials intend to ban the team, soon dubbed "The Iron Ladies", from the tournament. However, seeing how much the team is liked by the crowd soon changes many of their opinions.

At the end credits of the film, the real "Iron Ladies" are shown as they were at the time of making the film.
