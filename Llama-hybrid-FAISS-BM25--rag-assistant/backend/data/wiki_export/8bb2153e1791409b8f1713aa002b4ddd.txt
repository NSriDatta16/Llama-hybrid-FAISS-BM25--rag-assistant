UK Music Week was a nationwide music vote held in the UK, which compiled a list of the top 40 greatest musicians of all time.

Many commercial radio stations took part in the week-long event from 24 April to 1 May 2006, consisting of special programming and a results show, which was broadcast on the last day of the week and counted down the chosen artists from number 40 to number 1.

Public voting was conducted online on the UK Music Week website, and also by texting nominations to a dedicated number.
