History 

Dubarry of Ireland was established in 1937 by the Cullen Family Trust,  to provide local employment. Dubarry began trade by manufacturing quality shoes and named itself after Madame du Barry, a famous French courtesan to differentiate the brand from its Irish counterparts and give the brand a continental, European flavour. Information on the establishment of Dubarry by papers of the first Chairman and Managing Director of Dubarry submitted by H.L.Cullen.

In November 2004, Dubarry ceased its manufacturing facility in Ballinasloe, transferring operations to Portugal where it has contract manufacturing partners. Dubarry justified its decision to relocate its entire production line to Portugal on high labour costs in Ireland. The company headquarters, however, as well as its product development, marketing and distribution departments, remain in Ballinasloe.
