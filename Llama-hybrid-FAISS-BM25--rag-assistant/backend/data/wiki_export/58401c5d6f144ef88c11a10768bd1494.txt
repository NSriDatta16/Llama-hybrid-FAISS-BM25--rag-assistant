Flesh Of My Flesh, Blood Of My Blood is the second album by American rapper DMX. The album was released on December 22, 1998, by Def Jam Recordings and Ruff Ryders Entertainment, over seven months after his debut album, It's Dark and Hell Is Hot.

Commercial performance 
It debuted on the Billboard 200 at number one (and stayed there for three consecutive weeks) with over 670,000 units shipped in the first week. In January 1999, the album was ousted from the top spot by Britney Spears' debut, ...Baby One More Time. The album eventually went 3Ã— platinum in the US.

DMX became the second artist to have two albums released in the same calendar year debut at number one on the Billboard 200. The latter album to have done so was released posthumously by Tupac Shakur under the alias Makaveli (his first was All Eyez on Me, while the second was The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory).

This record would later be surpassed by YoungBoy Never Broke Again, who debuted atop the Billboard 200 in October 2019, May and October 2020 respectively, with AI YoungBoy 2, 38 Baby 2, and Top. YoungBoy would be the first rapper in the chart's history to score three number one albums within a ten month period (the former two debuted in five months, while the latter were number one in six months; one to two months behind DMX's record by proxy, making it the fastest).
