The Auburn Gallipoli Mosque is an Ottoman-style mosque in Auburn, a suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. More than 500 worshippers attend every day and around 2,000 worshippers attend the weekly special Friday prayer at the Auburn Gallipoli Mosque.

Significance and history
The mosque's name invokes the legacy of the Gallipoli Campaign during World War I, which played a pivotal role in the history of both Australia and the Republic of Turkey. According to mosque officials, the name is meant to signify "the shared legacy of the Australian society and the main community behind the construction of the mosque, the Australian Turkish Muslim Community." The Auburn Gallipoli Mosque is based on the design of the Marmara University Faculty of Theology mosque in Istanbul, Turkey.

The first mosque on the present mosque site was opened for worship on 3 November 1979. It was a house with internal walls removed to generate open space. The construction of the present mosque structure began in 1986. Its construction and external finishes were completed and officially opened on 28 November 1999, twenty years after the first opening.

On the 10th of December 2005, during an official visit to Australia, Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan, the then Turkish Prime Minister, attended the Auburn Gallipoli Mosque's Friday sermon and prayed among worshippers.
