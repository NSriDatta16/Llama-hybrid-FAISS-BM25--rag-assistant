Rusagonis-Waasis (2001 population: 748) was Canadian local service district in Lincoln Parish, Sunbury County, New Brunswick, which bore the name of two communities within the local service district, Rusagonis and Waasis. Early references use an alternative spelling, Rusagornis, for the community today known as Rusagonis. Some residents advocated changing the governing structure from a local service district into a rural community. It is now mainly part of the incorporated rural community of Sunbury-York South, with the remainder belonging to the city of Fredericton and the Capital region rural district.

It is located 15 kilometres southeast of Fredericton, and is near Tracy. It is west-southwest of Oromocto. It formerly had at least two railway stations (flag stops) served by the Canadian Pacific Railway.
