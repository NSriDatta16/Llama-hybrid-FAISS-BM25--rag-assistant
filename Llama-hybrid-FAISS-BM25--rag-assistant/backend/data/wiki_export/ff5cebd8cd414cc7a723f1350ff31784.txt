The National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR) is a United States governmental agency that provides leadership and support for a comprehensive program of research related to the rehabilitation of individuals with disabilities. It was previously The National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research, a subordinate of the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS) — part of United States Department of Education.

In 2015, as a result of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, the organization became part of the Administration for Community Living (ACL), within the Department of Health and Human Services, and changed to its current name. NIDILRR's mission is to generate new knowledge and promote its effective use to improve the abilities of people with disabilities to perform activities of their choice in the community, and also to expand society's capacity to provide full opportunities and accommodations for its citizens with disabilities.
