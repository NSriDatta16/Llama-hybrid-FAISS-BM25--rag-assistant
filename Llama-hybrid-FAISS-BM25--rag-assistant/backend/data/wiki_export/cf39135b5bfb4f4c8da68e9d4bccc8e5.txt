Westfalenhallen (English: Halls of Westphalia) is a commercial complex composed of conference (Kongresszentrum Dortmund) and exhibition centers (Messe Dortmund) with an indoor arena (Westfalenhalle), located in Dortmund, Germany. It is surrounded by the Eissportzentrum Westfalenhallen, Stadion Rote Erde, Westfalenstadion and Helmut-Körnig-Halle.

The original building was opened in 1925, but was destroyed during World War II. Reopening on 2 February 1952, new halls were built, the "Große Westfalenhalle". The "Kleine Westfalenhalle" served also for balls, exhibitions and concerts, such as the Dortmunder Philharmoniker, until the Opernhaus Dortmund was opened in 1966. The Bundesliga was founded at the Westfalenhallen in 1962.
