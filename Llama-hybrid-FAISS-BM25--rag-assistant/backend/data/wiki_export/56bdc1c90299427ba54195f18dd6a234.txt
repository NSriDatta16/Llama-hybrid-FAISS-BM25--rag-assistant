As Transport Minister, Batchelor oversaw the $750 million Regional Fast Rail project. In 2000, the State Government approved funding to upgrade rail lines to provide fast rail passenger services between Melbourne and Ballarat, Bendigo, Geelong and Traralgon.

As Minister for Energy and Resources, Batchelor initiated the roll-out of smart meters to 2.5 million homes and businesses. The roll-out of smart meters was reportedly to assist with consumer choice on electricity providers and to help manage climate change. However, the roll-out was stopped when the budget blew-out from $800 million to $2 billion. The roll-out was completed under the Andrews Government in 2015.

According to Melbourne public transport academic Paul Mees, Batchelor "was staunchly against privatisation when in opposition and then continued with privatisation and reprivatisation in government.

On 7 October 2010 Batchelor announced, he would not re-contest his seat at the 2010 state election. He retired at that election. Dorothy, his partner, was also reported to be retiring from work.

Other roles

Prior to entering politics, Batchelor was a union official at Furnishing Trades Union, 1972-1982. From 1983 to 1990, he was ALP Victorian branch state secretary.

In February, 2012, Batchelor was appointed President of the Community Broadcasting Foundation. The Foundation, based in Melbourne, is the independent funding body annually distributing over $15m of federal grants to 220 Australian community based media organisations.

Campaign disputes
Reportedly, Batchelor "helped organise and distribute bogus how-to-vote cards for the Nuclear Disarmament Party" (sic) during the 1985 Nunawading by-election. which appeared to represent the recommended voting preferences of the Nuclear Disarmament Party. Campaigning for nuclear disarmament was popular in left-wing politics during the 1980s. Police investigated the matter and Batchelor was not charged with any criminal offence.

In 2016, Batchelor was filmed removing a Greens election banner and replacing it with ALP election material in the seat of Batman. It was claimed that Greens election campaigners had blanketed polling booths with their material leaving no space for other campaigners.
