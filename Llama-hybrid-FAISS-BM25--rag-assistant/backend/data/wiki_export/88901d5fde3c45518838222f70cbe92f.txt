This Is the Way is the second and final studio album by the Rossington Collins Band.

Reception

Robin Smith of Record Mirror panned the album in a 1/5 star review, calling it "the biggest load of hackneyed bollocks I've heard for a good six months." Michael B. Smith, in a retrospective review for AllMusic, wrote that the band "pay due homage to Ronnie Van Zandt [sic] with the songs 'Tashauna' and 'Pine Box', and rock with the best of 'em on 'Gotta Get It Straight' and "Gonna Miss It When It's Gone'."
