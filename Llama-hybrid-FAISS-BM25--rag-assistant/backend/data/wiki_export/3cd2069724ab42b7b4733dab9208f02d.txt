History
Settlement of Goose Lake Valley at Davis Creek began with a single log cabin in 1869. The Davis Creek post office opened in 1877, and changed its name to Davis Creek in 1879.

During Goose Lake's high-water years, at least from 1908 to 1912, Davis Creek served as the southern port on the lake to and from which the ferry, Lakeview carried passengers and cargo for the town of Lakeview, Oregon at the north end of the lake. The Nevada-California-Oregon Railway from Reno reached Davis Creek in 1911. The port fell into disuse as lake waters receded and the railroad was completed to Lakeview.

A 1913 book described Davis Creek as being on Goose Lake and having a population of 150.

In the early 1960s, U.S. Route 395 was realigned, bypassing Davis Creek's business section, leading to the closure of most businesses there, and the construction of a newer general store on the new highway.
