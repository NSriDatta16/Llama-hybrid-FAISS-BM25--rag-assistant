Teaser is the 1975 debut solo album from American guitarist Tommy Bolin.

Background
Teaser was released in conjunction with the album Come Taste the Band by Deep Purple, on which Bolin also played guitar.

This album is cherished by fans for the broad range of styles in Bolin's playing. The material spans hard rock, blues rock, jazz, reggae and Latin music, often blending these styles together within a single song. It is also considered by many to be some of Bolin's greatest recordings in his short career.

The song "Teaser" was covered by American hard rock band Mötley Crüe on the charity album Stairway to Heaven/Highway to Hell.

Van Halen would often cover "The Grind" live in its early club days.

Reception
Upon its release on November 17, 1975, Teaser received considerable praise from critics. However, due to Bolin's obligations with Deep Purple, he was unable to promote the album with a solo tour. Despite Nemperor adding a "Guitarist for Deep Purple" sticker to the wrapping, sales were not as good as hoped. Per an agreement with Bolin, Deep Purple had performed the songs "Homeward Strut" and "Wild Dogs" off the Teaser album during their Come Taste the Band world tour in 1975–76.
