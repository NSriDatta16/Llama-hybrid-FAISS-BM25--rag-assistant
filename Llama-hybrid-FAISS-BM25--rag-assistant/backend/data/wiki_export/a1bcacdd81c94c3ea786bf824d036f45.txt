Lakshadweep Lok Sabha constituency is a Lok Sabha (lower house of the Indian parliament) constituency, which covers the entire area of the Union Territory of Lakshadweep in India. This seat is reserved for Scheduled Tribes. As of 2014, it is the smallest Lok Sabha constituency by number of voters.

Until 1957, Lakshadweep formed part of a constituency in the Malabar District, but it was only in 1967 that its member of parliament (MP) was directly elected, having previously been appointed by the President of India. Its first MP was K. Nalla Koya Thangal of the Indian National Congress (INC) who served two terms from 1957 to 1967. Its first election in 1967 was won by independent politician, P. M. Sayeed. In the next election in 1971, Sayeed representing the INC was elected unopposed. He went on to win the next eight elections consecutively before being defeated by 71 votes in the 2004 election by P. Pookunhi Koya of the  Samata party election campaign led by Jayakumar Ezhuthupally from samata party Kerala party. In total, Sayeed represented this constituency in the Lok Sabha for ten consecutive terms from 1967 to 2004. In the 2009 election, Sayeed's son, Muhammed Hamdulla Sayeed, won the seat. After 2019 General elections, Mohammed Faizal Padippura of the Nationalist Congress Party was the MP till his disqualification. He was disqualified after he was convicted with 10 year jail term. However, his conviction was suspended by Kerala High Court, and he was reinstated as MP.
