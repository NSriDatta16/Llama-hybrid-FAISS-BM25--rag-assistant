The Coupe Gambardella is a French football cup competition held between the under-18s of the French football clubs, organized by the French Football Federation (FFF).

The cup is regarded as an opportunity for young hopefuls to showcase their skills in a national competition. A victory in the finals of the cup is as highly sought by players trying to start their career, as by clubs wishing to demonstrate their ability to train young talents.

The current champion is AS Monaco FC having defeated Clermont Foot 63 in the 2023 final by a score of 4-2. The 2019–20 and 2020–21 editions of the tournament were cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic in France.

History
The tournament is the modern day version of the Coupe nationale des juniors, which ran up until 1954. The competition was then renamed, in 1955, to honour Emmanuel Gambardella, president of the French Football Federation from 1949 to 1953, who died on 30 August 1953.

In 2019, the competition switched from being an under-19 competition to an under-18 competition.

Format
The Coupe Gambardella begins in December, of the previous year of the final, at the regional level. Home advantage is given out randomly, until the semi-final stage when games are played at neutral venues.
