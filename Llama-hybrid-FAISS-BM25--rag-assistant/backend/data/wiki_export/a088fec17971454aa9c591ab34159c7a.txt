Rosalind Bank, also called Rosalinda or Rosa Linda Bank (), is a large, completely submerged bank or atoll in the western Caribbean Sea. It is the culmination of an area of coral reef, some  long, that extends eastward from Cabo Gracias a Dios. The bank area is part of an extensive structure, known as Nicaragua Rise, that continues further east through Pedro Bank towards Jamaica.

Geography
Rosalind is  long in a north–south direction and  wide, as defined by the  isobath, which corresponds to an area of roughly . General depths range from , an almost immediate transition from the  depth of surrounding waters. The bottom is of coarse sand and coral.

Several patches of depths from  lie on a  long coral ledge located  within the southeast edge of the bank. A detached  patch lies near the southwest edge of the bank,  west of the southern end of this ledge. A depth of  lies close to the northern edge of the bank.

An extensive bank  long and  wide, with an area of , lies  west of Rosalind Bank. Depths over this bank range from . The shallowest detached patches are found along the eastern edge of the bank. A detached  patch lies on the northern part of the bank.  further west lies Thunder Knoll.

 southeast of Rosalind Bank is Serranilla Bank. The cays on it are the closest pieces of dry land.

Until a 1986 treaty between Honduras and Colombia determined the two nations' maritime boundary in the area, Colombia claimed Rosalinda Bank as part of the San Andrés archipelago, along with Serranilla Bank. Under the treaty, however, Colombia accepted a boundary that placed Rosalind within Honduras's exclusive economic zone. Nicaragua objected to the 1986 maritime decision as it ignored Nicaraguan claims to the area.
