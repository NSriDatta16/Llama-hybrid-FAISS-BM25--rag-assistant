Abracadabra is the twelfth studio album by American rock band Steve Miller Band. The album was released on June 15, 1982, by Capitol Records.

Abracadabra charted in nine countries, including Germany where the record reached No. 1 for a week. Four singles were released from the album: the title track, "Cool Magic", "Keeps Me Wondering Why", and "Give It Up", with the title song charting the highest.

Unlike most of the band's previous efforts, most of the album was not composed by lead singer/guitarist Steve Miller. Drummer Gary Mallaber had brought in a handful of demos from another band he was in called Tracker (of which other Steve Miller Band members John Massaro and Byron Allred were also in, along with ex-members Lonnie Turner and Greg Douglass) in hopes that one of them would be used for the album. Miller ultimately opted to use all of the demos, resulting in Mallaber receiving an impressive eight co-writing credits. Miller, meanwhile, produced two of his own songs; the title track and the "Heart Like a Wheel"-soundalike "Give It Up".

Critical reception

Billboard said of "Cool Magic" that it's a "catchy midtempo pop tune that takes dead aim at car radios everywhere."  Billboard also described it as being "harder rocking" than the title track.  Cash Box called it "a light, straightahead pop/rocker that, in places, brings to mind the Beach Boys or the Beatles."
