The 1997 Memorial Cup occurred May 10–18 at the Robert Guertin Centre in Hull, Quebec.  It was the 79th annual Memorial Cup competition and determined the major junior ice hockey champion of the Canadian Hockey League (CHL).  Participating teams were the host Hull Olympiques, who were also the champions of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, as well as the QMJHL runner-up Chicoutimi Saguenéens, and the winners of the Ontario Hockey League and Western Hockey League, which were the Oshawa Generals and the Lethbridge Hurricanes respectively.  The round-robin portion of the tournament also featured one of the greatest games in Memorial Cup history, in which Lethbridge trailed Hull 6-1 to start the third period of their game and stormed back to win 7-6 in overtime.  The Olympiques won their first Memorial Cup, over Lethbridge.
