Germ√°n Garrido (born 15 June 1948) is a member of one of Spain's most successful golfing families. His brother Antonio and nephew Ignacio were only the second father-son combination to have played in the Ryder Cup.

German Garrido turned professional in 1963. He played on the European circuit both before and after the establishment of the formal European Tour in 1972, winning the Madrid Open in 1968 and 1973 and the Portuguese Open in 1972. With his win in the 1973 Madrid Open, Garrido and his brother became the first pair of brothers to win on the European Tour. They were later followed by Manuel and Seve Ballesteros and Francesco and Edoardo Molinari.
