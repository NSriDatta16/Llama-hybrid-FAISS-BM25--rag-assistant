This is a complete list of women's alpine skiing World Cup champions in the overall and each discipline.  Multiple World Cups in the overall and in each discipline are marked with (#).

History
Combined events (calculated using results from selected downhill and slalom races) were included starting with the 1974–75 season, but a discipline trophy was only awarded during the next season (1975–76) and then once again starting with the 1979–80 season. Prior to the 2006–7 season, no trophy had been officially awarded for the combined since the late 1980s.  Note that no women's combined events were completed during the 2003–4 season.  The table below lists the leader of the combined standings each season even if no trophy was awarded.  

The super-G was added for the 1982–83 season, but from 1983 to 1985, super-G results were included with giant slalom, and a single trophy was awarded for giant slalom.
