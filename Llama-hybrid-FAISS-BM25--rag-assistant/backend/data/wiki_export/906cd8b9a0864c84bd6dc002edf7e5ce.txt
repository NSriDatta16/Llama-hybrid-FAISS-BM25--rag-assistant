Professional career

Oakland Raiders
In 1974, Van Eeghen took over as fullback of the Oakland Raiders from Marv Hubbard, also a Colgate alumnus.

In the 1980 season, Van Eeghen was part of the Raiders team that advanced to Super Bowl XV, in which they defeated the Philadelphia Eagles 27 to 10. He was the game's leading rusher with 75 yards on 18 carries.
He also won a Super Bowl ring with the Raiders in Super Bowl XI, in which he was the team's second leading rusher with 73 yards. He left the Raiders in 1982 as the team's all-time leading rusher with 5,907 yards at the time.

New England Patriots
He then joined the New England Patriots, where he appeared in the infamous Snowplow Game.

Van Eeghen rushed the ball 22 times for 100 yards in the 3-0 Patriots win.

Van Eeghen finished his ten NFL seasons with 6,651 career rushing yards, 174 career receptions for 1,583 receiving yards, and 41 career touchdowns (37 rushing and four receiving).
