The Mortdale maintenance depot is a Sydney Trains train depot in the southern Sydney suburb of Mortdale.

Description
The depot features nine roads under the main shed (numbered 1-3 and 5â€“10), two elevated outdoor roads (numbered 11 and 12), a train washing facility and several short outdoor storage sidings. The depot is responsible for the stabling and maintenance of all Tangara (T set) trains on the T4 Eastern Suburbs & Illawarra Line and South Coast Line local services.

Shunters control and authorise train movements within this facility. They are responsible for the amalgamation and division of the Tangara sets to facilitate maintenance and repairs. The shunters are also responsible for the safe passage of trains, staff and other equipment within the facility.

History
The depot opened in 1925 and was one of four electric train depots built under the Bradfield electrification plan, the other depots being at Hornsby, Flemington, and Punchbowl.

Following the opening of the Eastern Suburbs line in 1979, Mortdale became the first all double deck depot, only having S sets allocated to it. The last S set was withdrawn from Mortdale in April 2013. The depot now only has T sets allocated to it.

In 2020 plans are being prepared to upgrade the depot to increase its maintenance capacity, in preparation for increased services on the Illawara line as part of the Transport for NSW's More Trains, More Services program.
