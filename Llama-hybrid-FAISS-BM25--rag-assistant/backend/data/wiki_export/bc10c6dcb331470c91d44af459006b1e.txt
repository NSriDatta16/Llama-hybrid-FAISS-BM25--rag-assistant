Biography
Barbadillo started playing in 1972 with Sport Boys. In 1974, he moved to play for Defensor Lima. In 1975, he arrived in Monterrey, Mexico to play for Tigres UANL. With Tigres he conquered a domestic cup or Copa México against Club América in 1976 and two Mexican League championships, first against Pumas UNAM in 1978 and against Atlante in 1982. He scored over 60 goals in six years and formed a special association in the pitch with Mexican historical creative midfielder Tomás Boy. Aside from his goalscoring, Barbadillo also played 17 Clásico Regiomontano derby matches against Monterrey, Tigres' main rival. Because he is considered one of the best players the team has ever had, his number, #7, has been retired and immortalized.

Barbadillo then moved in 1982 to Italy to play for Avellino, after his magnificent performance in the FIFA World Cup. He played later for Udinese in 1985–86. He has retired as a player and lives in Italy. He has been in charge of Udinese's youth team since 2005.
