The Two Steves are British collaborative writers of children's books Steve Barlow (real name Steven Lowe) and Steve Skidmore (born 7 December 1960). They have written more than 70 books together. Their books are published as by Steve Barlow and Steve Skidmore except two Dragonriders of Bresal novels (2007 and 2008) as by Salamanda Drake.

Background

Skidmore wrote the text for at least two non-fiction picture books published in 1990.

The Two Steves began collaborating in 1987 after meeting while working at Fairham Comprehensive School in Nottingham, and have produced a large body of work together. They operate on a freelance basis, and have produced work for several publishers including Scholastic (Outernet series), and Collins (The Dark Forest series). Their first published work was a book of three short plays, "Paper Tigers" (1991) in the Oxford Playscripts series, while their first novel was "I fell in Love with a Leather Jacket" (1993). They have also written a large body of work for educational publishers, and have been series editors for Impact and High Impact (materials for struggling readers) for Heinemann, as well as series editors for Heinemann Plays and Oxford Playscripts.  They have also written parody books such as "Star Bores" (2000), to coincide with the releases of popular and anticipated films. However, the bulk of their work still remains in the field of children's and teenage literature. A number of their books have been translated into other languages, and The Mad Myths, Vernon Bright, The Dark Forest and Erik Bloodaxe books have been released as spoken word tapes. They have recently made some of their older books available on the iPhone and iPod touch via Sleepydog.

The 2 Steves are currently working on new books for various publishers, including Usborne and Hachette.

School visits
As former teachers, the Two Steves have toured schools both around Britain, and in other countries including Brazil, China, Qatar, Venezuela, Oman, and Malaysia. They have also been involved with the library services in Britain, and events such as the Northern Children's Book Festivals in 2006 and 2009.
