Facilities
At its founding, the Manhattan Theatre Club staged off-off-Broadway productions at Stage 73, located at 321 East 73rd Street.

In 1984, MTC moved to its ongoing Off-Broadway productions to New York City Center's lower level. Its performance space comprises a 299-seat theatre with fixed seating (Stage I) and a 150-seat studio theatre with variable seating configurations (Stage II).

The MTC added a venue for Broadway productions when it purchased the Biltmore Theatre in 2001; the theatre was renamed the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre on September 4, 2008, in honor of Broadway publicist Samuel Friedman. After the 2001 purchase, the MTC commenced renovations, re-opening in October 2003. With 650 seats the Friedman has about two-thirds of the capacity of the old Biltmore Theatre.
