Professional career
Bell was drafted by the Buffalo Bills in the first round of the 1984 NFL Draft. He was a one-time Pro Bowler after his rookie year in 1984 with the Bills after having a 1,100 rushing yards and a seven touchdown season. Bell had his best year after the 1988 NFL season with the Rams, in which he had 1,212 rushing yards and led the league with sixteen touchdowns. He had a similar season the year after in which Bell had 1137 rushing yards and fifteen touchdowns, again leading the league. To that point, no other running back had ever led the league in rushing touchdowns in consecutive seasons without entering the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and Bell attempted to hold out for a better contract. The Rams instead traded him to the Raiders, who had a loaded backfield consisting of Marcus Allen, Bo Jackson, and Napoleon McCallum; Bell barely saw the field and was out of the NFL after that season.
