The Knesset Guard (; Mishmar HaKnesset) is an Israeli protective security unit. The Knesset Guard is responsible for the security of the Knesset building and protection of Knesset members (MKs).

Guards are stationed outside the building, with ushers on duty inside. The commander of the force is called the Sergeant-at-Arms (K'tzin HaKnesset, literally, "officer of the Knesset"). In addition to security duties, the Knesset Guard conducts ceremonial roles, such as greeting dignitaries and taking part in the annual ceremony on Mount Herzl on the eve of Israeli Independence Day.

History
On October 29, 1957 Moshe Dwek threw a grenade during a plenary session of the Knesset. Minister Haim Moshe Shapiro, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion and Minister of Foreign Affairs Golda Meir were injured. Following the events the Israeli Police decided to establish the Knesset Guard in 1958.

Duties
The Knesset Guard has primary responsibility for protecting the Knesset building and grounds. It is also responsible for the personal security of Knesset members. The guard operates under the authority of the Speaker of the Knesset.

The Status and Authority were regulated as part of Knesset Guard Law from 1968. First Knesset Officer was Yerachmiel Belkin.

Weapons
Knesset Guards are armed with IMI Tavor TAR-21 and IMI Galil rifles.
