Production

Development 
As a fan of Indira Parthasarathy's stories, Malayalam filmmaker K. S. Sethumadhavan approached him with a desire to adapt his novel Vendhu Tanindha Kaadugal for the screen; Parthasarathy however suggested the novella Uchi Veyil, and Sethumadhavan, who had read the story before, read it again and agreed to make it into a film. The title Uchi Veyil could not be retained due to a different film with the same name already having released in 1990, so Marupakkam was chosen. The film was produced by the National Film Development Corporation of India and Doordarshan, Sethumadhavan, in addition to directing, also wrote the screenplay. Cinematography was handled by D. Vasanth Kumar, and editing by G. Venkitaraman, while the background music was composed by L. Vaidyanathan.

Casting and filming 
When offered the role of Vembu Iyer by Sethumadhavan, Sivakumar, who had read the source material, readily accepted as he thought it would be a challenging role. He consulted dentists in deciding for his make-up. Though the story is primarily set in Kumbakonam, the film was shot in Madras. Made on a shoestring budget of ₹12 lakh (worth ₹2.7 crore in 2021 prices),  filming was completed in 14 days.

Accolades 
Marupakkam won three awards at the 38th National Film Awards which took place in 1991: Golden Lotus Award for Best Film, Silver Lotus Award for Best Screenplay (Sethumadhavan), and Silver Lotus Award for Special Jury Award / Special Mention (Jayabharathi). It was the first Tamil film to win the Best Film award. Sivakumar was a strong contender for the National Film Award for Best Actor, but lost to Amitabh Bachchan for Agneepath. Sethumadhavan won the Film Fans Association Award for Best Director, and Sivakumar won for Best Character Actor. The film was featured at the International Film Festival of India in 2003 as part of a retrospective tribute to Sethumadhavan.

Reception 
Marupakkam was theatrically released on 6 March 1992. N. Krishnaswamy of The Indian Express wrote the following week, "Sethumadhavan's narration is designed to be impressive. Based on Indira Parthasarathy's novella, the script of Marupakkam tries to be offbeat by withholding information and by cutting back and forth time." The Tamil magazine Ananda Vikatan, in a review dated 15 March 1992, applauded Marupakkam as a sharply focused film on the subject without any diversion with good editing, superb acting, re-recording at the right places and nice presentation. The reviewer said only Sethumadhavan could translate a simple but meaningful story by Indira Parthasarathy into an amazing film like this, and felt more such films like this must come in Tamil cinema. Another Tamil magazine, Kumudam, called it a "masterpiece" from Sivakumar, and said his career could be divided into two eras: "pre-Marupakkan and post-Marupakkam".
