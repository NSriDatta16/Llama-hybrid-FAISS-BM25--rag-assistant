Live in Chicago, 1999 is an album by Joan of Arc, released in 1999. It is not an album of live material, but is rather named after the fact that the band members lived in Chicago in the year 1999.

Production
Live in Chicago, 1999 was recorded mainly at Classsicks, with some recording being done at Truckstop West and Sherry and Lenora's house. Casey Rice served as producer and handled recording, while additional recording was done by Elliot Dicks on half of the songs. Scott Adamson did additional recording and editing on tracks 1 and 6. Rice mixed the recordings, before the album was mastered by Alan Douches at West West Side Music in New Jersey.

Critical reception
The Chicago Tribune wrote that the album is "full of the kind of music that requires headphones to be completely appreciated, sound collages that envelop the listener in their arty, dreamy textures." Washington City Paper thought that "these are overcast songs of lovelorn gloom: tone poems that spread out, rumble a bit, but mostly just loom over the listener in one big gray mood." Spin wrote that it "goes beyond emo to a freestyle, experimental, randomly discordant place."
