History 

The name Yerrinbool is an Aboriginal word for the Wood Duck — a species which is quite common around the ponds in Yerrinbool. The area where Yerrinbool was prior to settlement was known as "Little Forest".

On 13 July 1919, Yerrinbool railway station along with now closed Aylmerton Station was officially open for use on the Main South Line. It was built on the new train line that was built between Mittagong and Picton to replace what is known today as the disused Picton Loop Railway Line. This line was built to ease steep grades as the original line left Picton Station train traffic "bottlenecked".

With the line and station now operating, the village was laid out, with two early land sales of Yerrinbool Station Estate on 6 October 1919  and 1 January 1920.

Yerrinbool Post Office opened on 1 December 1919 on the arrival of the railway and closed in 1977.
The Yerrinbool General Store was built and opened in 1921 along with a saw-mill which has now been demolished. 
On 20 August 1922, a school was opened with 30 students enrolled. However, the school building was burnt down in a fire in the 1970s and not rebuilt. 
The community hall was built in March 1938 by local voluntary labour.

The Yerrinbool Baháʼí School was first opened in May 1937 as a Baháʼí Summer School, providing a reading room and retreat for practitioners of the Baháʼí Faith. It is known as the Yerrinbool Baháʼí Centre of Learning.
