Menno is a Dutch language given name of Old Frisian origin. It was made popular by the influential Frisian religious reformer Menno Simons (West Frisian: Minne Simens), and the name was spread by his followers, the Mennonites.

Menno is the Dutch version of Frisian Meine. Like other Germanic names with mein-, it stems from megin- "power, strength".
