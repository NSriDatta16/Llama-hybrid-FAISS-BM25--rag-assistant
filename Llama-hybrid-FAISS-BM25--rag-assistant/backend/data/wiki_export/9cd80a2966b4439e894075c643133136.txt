The Senate () was the upper house legislative chamber in Imperial State of Iran from 1949 to 1979. A bicameral legislature had been established in the 1906 Persian Constitutional Revolution but the Senate was not actually formed until after the 1949 Constituent Assembly election, as an expression of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's desire for better distribution of power (similar to many democratic countries). Half of the sixty seats in the senate were directly appointed by the Shah, and the other half were directly elected, fifteen represented Tehran, and the rest were elected from other regions.

The Senate was disbanded after the Iranian Revolution in 1979, when the new constitution established a unicameral legislature. , the former Senate building was used by the Assembly of Experts.
