Dogs of War! is a 1923 silent short subject, the fourteenth entry in Hal Roach's Our Gang (Little Rascals) series. Directed by Robert F. McGowan, the two-reel short was released to theaters in July 1923 by Pathé Exchange. The short was filmed alongside Why Worry?, a feature comedy produced by Roach and starring Harold Lloyd, who makes a cameo appearance in Dogs of War as himself.

Plot
Near West Coast Studios in Hollywood, the gang is waging a street war against a rival group of kids; their ammunition primarily consisting of old vegetables. The battle is halted when Mary is called to act in one of the West Coast films. The rest of the gang tries to crash the studio gates and get a role in the picture, but the casting director throws them out. Farina manages to sneak into the studio, however, prompting the other kids to sneak in after her. Several chases throughout the property then ensue and the gang eventually escapes - with a little help from Harold Lloyd.

Notes
 When the television rights for the original silent Pathé Our Gang comedies were sold to National Telepix and other distributors, several episodes were retitled. Footage from the first half of this film was released into television syndication in 1960 under the title Battleground.
 Footage from the second half of this film was released to the series in the hybrid episode "Hollywood U.S.A.".
 Later, MGM Our Gang used a similar rotten vegetable war theme in the 1941 short Fightin Fools.
