Dzhankoi Raion (, , ) is one of the 25 regions of Crimea, currently subject to a territorial dispute between the Russian Federation and Ukraine. Population: 

It is located in the northern part of the Crimean steppe near the Syvash Bay. The city of Dzhankoi is the raion's administrative centre, but it is excluded from the region and forms a separate municipality. The North-Crimean canal (the main waterway of northern Crimea supplying the republic with water from the Dnieper river) runs through the district.

History 
On 16 August 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a large temporary ammunition store of the Russian forces in the villages of Maiske and Azovske was attacked causing secondary explosions and fires that burned into the next day.  Russian government officials plan to offer amounts of "10, 50 and 100 thousand rubles" to local villagers whose houses were damaged, depending on the magnitude of damage to each structure.

2020 Ukrainian Administrative Reform 

In July 2020, Ukraine conducted an administrative reform throughout its de jure territory. This included Crimea, which was at the time occupied by Russia, and is still ongoing as of October 2023. Crimea was reorganized from 14 raions and 11 municipalities into 10 raions, with municipalities abolished altogether. The territory of Dzhankoi Raion was expanded to also include the territories of the Municipality of Dzhankoi, but has not yet been implemented due to the ongoing Russian occupation.
