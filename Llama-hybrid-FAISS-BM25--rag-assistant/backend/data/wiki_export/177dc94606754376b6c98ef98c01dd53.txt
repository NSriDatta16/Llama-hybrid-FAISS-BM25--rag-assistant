lspci is a command on Unix-like operating systems that prints ("lists") detailed information about all PCI buses and devices in the system. It is based on a common portable library libpci which offers access to the PCI configuration space on a variety of operating systems.

Using lspci -v, lspci -vv, or lspci -vvv will display increasingly verbose details for all devices. -d [<vendor>]:[<device>] option specifies the vendor and device ID of the devices to display. Note that ":" can not be omitted, while the omitted <vendor> or <device> indicates "any value".

If many devices are shown as unknown (e.g. "Unknown device 2830 (rev 02)"), issuing the command update-pciids will usually correct this.

lsusb 
lsusb is a similar command for USB buses and devices. To make use of all the features of this program, a system needs to use Linux kernel which supports the /proc/bus/usb interface (e.g., Linux kernel 2.3.15 or newer).

Example output on a Linux system:
# lsusb

Bus 003 Device 004: ID 06cb:0081 Synaptics, Inc.

Bus 003 Device 002: ID 05e3:0608 Genesys Logic, Inc. Hub
Bus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
Bus 001 Device 003: ID 0bda:b023 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. RTL8822BE Bluetooth 4.2 Adapter
Bus 001 Device 002: ID 045e:07fd Microsoft Corp. Nano Transceiver 1.1
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub

hwinfo 
hwinfo is for all the hardware. Hwinfo output reports for various computer models are collected in a public GitHub repository.

lshw 
lshw is a subset of what hwinfo presents.

Other platforms 
The equivalent command for FreeBSD is pciconf -l. pciconf can also perform other functions such as reading and writing PCI registers. For more information, see the man page.

The HWiNFO tool, which is not related to the hwinfo tool mentioned above, can be downloaded in binary form at no cost. It is claimed to be a "system information and diagnostics comprehensive hardware analysis, monitoring and reporting for Windows and DOS".

Similar commands
 dmesg — prints the message buffer of the kernel.
 uname — prints the name, version and other details about the current machine and the operating system.
 lsscsi — prints information about mass storage devices.
