Cypress Springs High School, CSHS, or more commonly as Cy-Springs  is located at 7909 Fry Road, in Cypress, an unincorporated community in Harris County, Texas.

Cypress Springs High School was established in 1997, making it the sixth high school within Cypress Fairbanks Independent School District to open its doors to students in the Cypress and Katy areas. Since 2015, the school's principal has been Dr. Cheryl T. Henry. From 2012-2015, the school's principal was Travis Fanning and from 2008-2012, the school's principal was Barbara Weiman, one of the former Associate Principals before her promotion. Prior to Mrs. Weiman becoming principal, Sarah Harty was principal, until she was chosen to be the first principal of nearby Cypress Lakes High School which opened in 2008. The first principal to serve was Alan Meek, who helped establish the school in 1997.

Cypress Springs has many school clubs held before and after school for its students to participate in, such as Creative Writing Club, Chess Club, Key Club, Tech Club, Art Club, French Club, Spanish Club, Photography Club, Science Olympiad, Sociedad Honoraria Hispanica (Spanish National Honorary Society), InvenTeam, Drama Club, and Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) Club.

History
The school first opened in 1997, becoming the sixth school in CFISD. The graduating class of 2008 was Cypress Springs' largest senior class with more than 1,000 students walking the stage at the Richard E. Berry Educational Support Center to receive their diplomas.

In the 2005-2006 school year, attendance at this high school reached more than 4,000 students due to the building boom taking place in the local area, making for a crowded school and crowded hallways.

In 2016 a wave of CFISD high school rezoning occurred. Cypress Park High School opened, taking a portion of the Cypress Springs zone. In addition another portion of the Cypress Springs zone was given to Cypress Lakes High School. In turn, a section of the Langham Creek High School attendance zone was reassigned to Cypress Springs High School.
