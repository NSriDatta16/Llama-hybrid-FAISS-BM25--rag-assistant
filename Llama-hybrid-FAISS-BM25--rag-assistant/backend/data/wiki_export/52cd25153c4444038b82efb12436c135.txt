Tabor Academy is a Secondary school with Academy status located in Braintree, Essex, England.

Its executive headteacher is Anita Johnson, the CEO of the Loxford School Trust and the Headteacher of Loxford School, and Tabor's headteacher is Sarah Speller, who took over from Elizabeth Robinson in 2018.

History

The school started life in the early part of the twentieth century on Panfield Lane. Nominally co-educational, girls and boys were separated; the school effectively was split into two parts. Later with the introduction of the 1944 Education Act the school opened as a newly established secondary modern school and eventually became a fully coeducational school. It was eventually renamed the Margaret Tabor Secondary Modern School. The Tabor part of the name derived from the then local and prominent Tabor family who were major woollen merchants in the 16th century. The family shield was used as the badge of the school, and can still be seen today decorating Bocking bridge near the Old Convent, and on many old buildings in Braintree and Bocking. In September 1971 with the introduction of comprehensive education, the school was merged with the local grammar school to form The Tabor High School.

The school replaced the Tabor High School as the secondary school for west Braintree and surrounding villages and the old Senior section site was knocked down in 2004.

In 2007 it had science speciality status and was branded as Tabor Science College.

The school converted to Academy status in January 2013. It first joined the Lilac Sky Trust. It refactored the Loxford School Trust based in Ilford. As of 2015, Tabor Academy is also a partner in the Braintree Sixth Form which opened on the Notley High School site in September 2009.
