Mass hysteria

In May 2006, an outbreak of the so-dubbed "Morangos com Açúcar Virus" was reported in Portuguese schools. 300 or more students at 14 schools reported similar symptoms to those experienced by the characters in a then recent episode where a life-threatening virus affected the school depicted in the show. Symptoms of the "virus" included rashes, difficulty breathing, and dizziness. The perceived outbreak forced some schools to temporarily close. The Portuguese National Institute for Medical Emergency eventually dismissed the illness as mass hysteria.

This outbreak raised the concern of some parents regarding the major influence this series has on children who watch it. The story was reported internationally in newspapers, magazines and online.

Cast

Notable cast deaths 
Bernardino Esteves (popularly known as Dino) was portrayed by Francisco Adam. The character was retired from the series after Francisco Adam died in a car accident in April 2006. In the last episode featuring Dino, the character was seen leaving in a hot-air balloon, and threw his favourite orange-coloured hat onto the ground, where his lover, Susana, took it and kept it as a memento. The entire cast of the telenovela appeared and waved goodbye to the character, and the actor who portrayed him.
