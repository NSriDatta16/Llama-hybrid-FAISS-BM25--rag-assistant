Locals refer to the school as "Ike".

History
Eisenhower opened in September 1969, although construction of the building was not complete until the spring of 1970. The school opened with 400 9th and 10th grade students from New Berlin West.

On Thursday, April 29, 1999 approximately 800 students from Eisenhower High School and Eisenhower Middle School staged a walkout, protesting the New Berlin Public School Board's $1.6 billion proposed budget cuts. The cuts included eliminating elective course options such as home economics and eliminating several teaching positions. Although students skipped class for the walkout from 9:30 am until early in the afternoon, many Eisenhower teachers supported the protest, and administration did not punish students for truancy.

Athletics
Eisenhower High School was a member of the Parkland Conference from 1970 to 1997. It has been a member of the Woodland Conference since 1997.
