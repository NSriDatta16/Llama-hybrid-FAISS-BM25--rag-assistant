Elektronik Türküler (, "Electronic Folk Songs [of Turkey]") is the second album by Turkish rock musician Erkin Koray, originally released by Doğan Plakcılık in 1974. This is his first work to be recorded for the LP format, save a previous compilation of 45 rpm singles which his output had been restricted to until the mid-1970s.

Stylistically, it combines psychedelic and progressive rock influences with traditional Turkish elements. This album is one of the more internationally acknowledged examples of Anatolian rock.

The album was rereleased on CD by World Psychedelia Ltd. in 1999 (WPC6-8461).
