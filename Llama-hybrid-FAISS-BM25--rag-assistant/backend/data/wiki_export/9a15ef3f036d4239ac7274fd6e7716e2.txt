Brontoscorpio is an extinct genus of scorpion. Remains of the only known species, Brontoscorpio anglicus, were discovered in the St. Maughan's Formation, Lochkovian-aged sandstone from Trimpley, Worcestershire. The species was described on the basis of an incomplete single free finger of a right pedipalp (In31405), almost  long. The complete animal is estimated to have been  long for females and  long for males, making Brontoscorpio one of the largest known scorpions. The species is characterized by the presence of single condyle and row of thick tubercles on the pedipalp free finger.

Ecology 
The remains were found in terrestrial sediments, showing evidence of Brontoscorpio being terrestrial. Brontoscorpio may have gone ashore to escape predation, but due to its size, it would have had difficulty supporting its weight on land and likely lived a primarily aquatic life.

Popular culture 
Brontoscorpio was featured in the first episode of the 2005 BBC television series Walking with Monsters. It is shown hunting Cephalaspis and being eaten by Pterygotus.
