Usage at the time of independence

Salute states 
The gun salutes enjoyed by the states that acceded to the Dominion of India on 14 August 1947, included the following Maharanas:

Hereditary salute of 19-guns (21-guns local): the Maharana of Udaipur State (Mewar)
Hereditary salute of 13-guns the Maharana of Rajpipla
Hereditary salute of 11-guns: the Maharana of Barwani
 
Hereditary salutes of 9-guns:
The Maharana of Danta
The Maharana of Wadhwan
The Maharana of Sant
Some of the rulers were granted increased gun salutes after the independence, e.g. the above-listed Maharana of Mewar (Hindu; at Udaipur, Maharajpramukh in Rajasthan) was raised to first place in the Order of Precedence, displacing the Nizam of Hyderabad and Berar (Muslim), and all 9-gun states were permitted the use of the style of Highness.
