History
 The establishment of Zahira College, a school mainly for Muslims, in Sri Lanka in 1892 was a significant event in the history of education in the country. The idea of creating such a school was conceived by prominent individuals, including M. C. Siddi Lebbe, during a time when English education was viewed with suspicion due to its association with proselytism

At the time, almost all schools in Sri Lanka were run by Christian missionaries, and English education was seen as a tool for converting non-Christians to Christianity. This posed a challenge for Muslims who wanted to provide their children with a modern education but were wary of exposing them to religious conversion. 
During a public speech made by M. C. Siddhi Lebbe in 1891 at the Maradana Mosque Hall (which later became the college mosque), he appealed to the Muslim community to unite and promote the educational advancement of the community. This led to the formation of the Colombo Muslim Educational Society. The first secretary was I. L. M. Abdul Aziz and Arasi Marikar Wapchie Marikar was the first treasurer and headmaster, with the help of Ahamed Orabi Pasha, an Egyptian exile in Ceylon and freedom fighter. On Monday, 22 August 1892, Zahira College officially opened its doors to students. The school started with just 37 students, but it quickly grew in popularity, and by the end of the first year, the student population had increased to 125.
