Awards

Post-military career
Since his retirement from the Marine Corps, Brahms has been in private practice of law in Carlsbad California.  Brahms is also on the board of directors of the Judge Advocates Association.

Brahms served as a technical consultant for the Hollywood movie A Few Good Men.

Open letter to President Bush of September 7, 2004
On September 7, 2004 Brahms and seven other retired officers wrote an open letter to President Bush expressing their concern over the number of allegations of abuse of prisoners in U.S. military custody.  In it they wrote:
''"We urge you to commit – immediately and publicly – to support the creation of a comprehensive, independent commission to investigate and report on the truth about all of these allegations, and to chart a course for how practices that violate the law should be addressed."

Scalia recusal
On March 28, 2006 Brahms, and five other retired officers, called on US Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia to recuse himself from considering Hamdan v. Rumsfeld.
On March 27, 2006 comments Scalia had made on the Guantanamo detainees and whether they were entitled to the protections of the Geneva Conventions were widely republished.
The officers felt that Scalia's comments showed he had already prejudged the merits of Hamdan's case before hearing the arguments in court.

The Washington Post observed that, while a Justice was required to recuse himself or herself when they had a conflict of interest, the decision as to whether recusal was necessary was left to the discretion of the Justice in question.

Representation in Haditha Incident
Mr. Brahms is currently representing one of the seven Marines accused of a war crime in the Iraqi city of Haditha, known as the "Haditha killings".  Brahms has argued that the conditions his client has been held in are subpar to even Saddam Hussein's prison conditions in Iraq, and likened the situation to that of a federal Supermax prison facility.

"Urinating on Corpses" Video
Brahms was one of 27 retired military lawyers to sign a letter calling for congressional inquiry into potential unlawful command influence by Commandant of the Marine Corps James F. Amos in relation to a video of U.S. Marines urinating on Taliban fighters.
