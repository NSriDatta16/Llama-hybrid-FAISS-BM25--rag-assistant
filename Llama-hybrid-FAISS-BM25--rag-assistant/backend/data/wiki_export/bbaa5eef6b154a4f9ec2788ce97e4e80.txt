He was replaced on bass guitar by Andrew Corey Dedman. "Crank the System", which appeared in November 2000, was their first single with Dedman and also their first for the new Shock Records subsidiary label, Pivotal Records. The release included "Bullet for You" as a B-side which was co-written by Richard William "DW" Norton on lead guitar, backing vocals; Roderick "Burger" McLeod on lead vocals; and Fetah Sabawi on synthesisers and samplers. This version was reworked and issued as the album's second single, "Bullet". It peaked at No. 45 on the ARIA Singles Chart. The album and single were produced by Kalju Tonuma.
