Brescia University College is a Catholic liberal arts women's college located in London, Ontario, Canada.  Affiliated with the University of Western Ontario, Brescia is the only university-level women's college in Canada. It has approximately 1,500 undergraduate students and a 14:1 student/faculty ratio. Although Brescia is a Catholic institution, it accepts students of all faiths and backgrounds.

History
Brescia was founded in 1919 as Ursuline College by the Ursulines, an organization of women of Catholic faith. It was originally located in an old converted house at 556 Wellington Street in downtown London, Ontario. It was founded as a Roman Catholic affiliate of the University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario, and the graduates received University of Western Ontario degrees. The first class was of seven young women who each paid $50 for tuition.

The Ursuline Superior General, Mother Clare Gaukler, bought a piece of land at 1285 Western Road in London, and construction began on a permanent building in 1923.  The building was built by contractor Joseph Michael Piggot, opened for classes and residence in 1925, and was named Brescia Hall.  Brescia Hall was later renamed "Ursuline Hall".

Brescia was known as a liberal arts school and the courses taught were: English, French, Spanish, Philosophy, History, Classics, and Religious Knowledge. Brescia students took other courses such as Science, Mathematics, Political Economy at Western. Over time, Brescia adapted some of the courses (e.g., Philosophy) to be appropriate for Catholic women. In 1936, a Home Economics program was begun, it evolved into what is known today as the Department of Food and Nutritional Sciences.

Ursuline College was renamed "Brescia College" in 1963, after the Italian city of Brescia where the Ursuline religious institute was founded. In 2001 it was again renamed to "Brescia University College".

In September 2007, Brescia started the first graduate program.  In 2017, the college began offering a degree in non-profit management.

On September 21, 2023, Western University announced it would begin fully integrating Brescia into Western. The process will last until May 2024, whereby Brescia will fully wind down and cease operations. Western will assume all of Brescia's assets and liabilites, and will introduce a $25-million Brescia Legacy fund to support existing students who will complete their degrees under Western University. This news has drawn criticism from many students and faculty. On September 27, Brescia students held a rally with about 300 participants to voice their discontent with this desicion.

Buildings
James Carlisle Pennington designed Brescia Hall (1924â€“25) for the Ursuline Sisters, near Western Road at Sarnia Road, on the campus of the University of Western Ontario. The Mother St. James memorial building (completed in 1963) is the main building on campus; it houses classrooms, offices, student services, the business office, the Beryl Ivey Library and computer lab, the Mother St. James Memorial Auditorium and The Hive. Ursuline Hall was Brescia's original building and residence, but now houses classrooms, food laboratories and administrative offices. In September 2013, Brescia opened its new residence building and dining pavilion, Clare Hall, which houses just over 300 students and includes an eatery called the Mercato.
