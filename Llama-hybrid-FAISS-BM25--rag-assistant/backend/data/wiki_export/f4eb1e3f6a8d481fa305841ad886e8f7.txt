Steakknife are a German punk rock band established in 1991.

Band history 
Originally the band played under the name "Ankry Simons" doing some cover-songs of the American band "Angry Samoans", but later they started to do their own kind of music and recorded the 7" "Gotcha!", which was released in 1990 on X-Mist Records (SIS). The members played (or still play) in Bands like "Spermbirds", "2Bad" and "Challenger Crew". 
Some years later they changed their name into "Steakknife" (which is a song title from the "Angry Samoans") and recorded their debut album named "Godpill", which was also released on X-Mist Records in 1995.

Actual line-up 
Lee Hollis - Vocals
