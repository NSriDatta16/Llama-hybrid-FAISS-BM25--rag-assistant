Charles Edward Phelps was born in Guilford, Vermont, on May 1, 1833. His father was John Phelps, a lawyer and Senator in the Vermont State government. At the age of 5, he moved with his parents to Pennsylvania, and at the age of 8 to Maryland, when his mother, Almira Hart Lincoln Phelps,(sister of Emma Willard), became principal of the Patapsco Female Seminary in Ellicott City.

In 1860, Phelps was elected and served on the Baltimore City Council.

Civil War military service
In 1861, Phelpswas commissioned a major of the Maryland Guard, and, in 1862, he was raised to lieutenant colonel of the 7th Maryland Infantry Regiment, fighting for the Union. He became colonel in 1863.

During the Battle of the Wilderness in 1864 his horse was killed from under him. While leading a charge at Laurel Hill during the Battle of Spotsylvania, Phelps was wounded and taken prisoner. However, he was later rescued by General Phillip Sheridan's cavalry under the immediate command of Brigadier General George Armstrong Custer. Phelps received the Medal of Honor for valor at the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House on May 8, 1864.

He was honorably discharged on account of wounds on September 9, 1864. Shortly thereafter Phelps was elected as congressman from the 3rd district of Maryland to the Thirty-Ninth Congress as an Unconditional Unionist, and was reelected to the Fortieth Congress as a member of the Conservative Party (as the Democratic Party was being referred to in some states). On May 4, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Phelps for appointment to the brevet grade of brigadier general of volunteers to rank from March 13, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on May 18, 1866.

United States House of Representatives
Phelps served in the United States House of Representatives from 1865 through 1869. At this time, his party affiliation was "Conservative".

In February 1868, he voted against the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson.In his remarks to the House on the day of the impeachment vote, Phelps questioned whether Johnson's attempted at removing Edwin Stanton as secretary of war (which triggered the impeachment) had been indeed constituted a violation of the Tenure of Office Act. He cast doubt that it could be considered have yet been a removal, since Stanton was still fighting it, and also argued that no appointment of a successor to Stanton had actually been made, since Johnson had instead only acted to empower an officer to act in an ad interim capacity. He also questioned whether Stanton would be eligible for protection under the law, as he had been appointed by Abraham Lincoln, not Johnson. Phelps also questioned the constitutionality of the Tenure of Office Act, as he argued it interfered with the presidents' constitutional power to remove officers. Phelps further argued,
