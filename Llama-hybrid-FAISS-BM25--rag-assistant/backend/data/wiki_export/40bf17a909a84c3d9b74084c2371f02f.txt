Shag Times is a UK compilation and remix double album released in 1989 by The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu (The JAMs). The album also introduced Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty's new incarnation – and one which would become considerably more famous – The KLF.

Context
The title of the album relates to the slogan "Shag Shag Shag", a lyric from The JAMs' 1987 debut single "All You Need Is Love" that also appeared as promotional billboard graffiti at the time of the single's release. The gatefold sleeve of the Shag Times vinyl double LP alludes to a newspaper, whose columns recount The JAMs' actions as reported in the music press, alongside reviews of their musical output.

Released in January 1989 (see 1989 in music), Shag Times includes a selection of The JAMs' singles and album tracks, followed by The Timelords' "Doctorin' the Tardis". The remainder of the album consists of tracks originally by The JAMs, The Timelords and Disco 2000, remixed by and credited to The KLF. These KLF remixes were produced in 1988 by Drummond and Cauty, with engineering by Ian Richardson and programming by Nick Coler. The compilation showcases The JAMs' characteristic sample-driven hip hop and bastard pop, and in equal measure it introduces the minimalistic house sound of The KLF that characterised their subsequent "Pure Trance" releases "What Time Is Love" and "3 a.m. Eternal".

Following Shag Times, The KLF became Drummond and Cauty's main vehicle; the only future release by The JAMs was the industrial techno single "It's Grim Up North".

Reviews

In a contemporary review for The Village Voice, music critic Robert Christgau said that the JAMs' music was "more interesting than compelling", but "the drum-machine cut-and-paste of these white rappers cum dance-music guerrillas definitely deserves its footnote in the annals of sampling ... Of enduring artistic originality and importance for sure". Q magazine said, in reference to Shag Times, that The JAMs had "...helped re-open the whole debate [about the laws of creative ownership] and, what often seems neglected in the furore, made a sequence of very amusing juxtapositions, of which The Timelords 'Doctorin' the Tardis' (included here) is the tamest. A great party album."

In a retrospective review, AllMusic claimed that Shag Times was "one of the many deliberate cash-ins released in the wake of the Timelords" but that it "confirmed Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty's supremacy over every last imitator and pop stunt plagiarist".

Track listing
The following track listing is for the vinyl double LP UK release of Shag Times; the UK CD release featured the same tracks and running order but on one disc. Another CD of JAMSCD3 was issued in Switzerland, at some point between 1989 and 1992, and is identical to the UK release apart from "Made in Switzerland" written on the back sleeve above the barcode. This disc seems to be official, and is much sought-after as it is the only copy of the CD not to be manufactured by P.D.O., and is therefore immune to the "bronzing" that has damaged so many early and rare KLF CDs.

Elsewhere in Europe, Shag Times was released on vinyl through Rough Trade, without the remix contributions of The KLF, and in the US, a similar compilation entitled The History of The JAMs (a.k.a. The Timelords) was released, also without the remixes, the CD version containing "Gary in the Tardis" as a bonus track. A final edition of The History of the JAMs was issued by the Possum Label in Australia, on cassette, CD and vinyl, and features a unique mix of "Burn the Bastards" (called Burn the Beat) as well as the only CD appearance of the track "Disaster Fund Collection" and an edit of "All You Need is Love".
