Professional career

Miami Dolphins
Despite his great career at ASU, Hagan had a poor showing during the Senior Bowl practices by dropping passes, which many predicted would damage his stock in the upcoming draft. He ran a 4.45 40-yard dash at the NFL Combine. He was drafted in the third round (82nd overall) of the 2006 NFL Draft by the Miami Dolphins. His draft preparation with IMG was chronicled in the film Two Days in April.

Hagan spent the majority of his rookie season in 2006 as the Dolphins' fourth receiver behind starters Chris Chambers and Marty Booker and slot receiver Wes Welker. His problems with dropped passes continued throughout much of the season, and he failed to distinguish himself as a legitimate receiving threat. These drops, combined with the struggles of the Dolphins offense as a whole, resulted in a largely uneventful rookie campaign for Hagan. He finished the season with 21 catches for 221 yards and one touchdown in 14 games. The lone score came in an October 22 loss to the Green Bay Packers on a pass from Joey Harrington.

Hagan looked to get back on track in 2007 under new head coach Cam Cameron. He was given the chance to compete for playing time with the trade of Wes Welker to the New England Patriots. Hagan finished the year with 373 yards and two touchdowns in the 2007 season.

Nine weeks into the 2008 regular season, Hagan was released by the Dolphins on November 4. He had three receptions for 51 yards on the season.
