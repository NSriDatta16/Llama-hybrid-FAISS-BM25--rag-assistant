The 36th Artistic Gymnastics World Championships were held in Debrecen, Hungary, in 2002 at FÅ‘nix Hall.

The team and all-around events were not contested at the 2002 Worlds. The format was similar to that of the 1992 and 1996 Worlds, with medals being awarded for the individual WAG and MAG apparatus. There were three rounds of competition: the preliminary round open to everyone; the semi-finals open to the top sixteen qualifiers; and the finals for the top eight gymnasts.
