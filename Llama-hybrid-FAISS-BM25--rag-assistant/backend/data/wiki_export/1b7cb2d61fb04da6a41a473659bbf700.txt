Plants For A Future (PFAF) is an online not for profit resource for those interested in edible and useful plants, with a focus on temperate regions. Named after the phrase "plans for a future" as wordplay, the organization's emphasis is on perennial plants.

PFAF is a registered educational charity with the following objectives:

The website contains an online database of over 8000 plants: 7000 that can be grown in temperate regions including in the UK, and 1000 plants for tropical situations.

The database was originally set up by Ken Fern to include 1,500 plants which he had grown on his 28 acre research site in the South West of England.

Since 2008, the database  has been maintained by the database administrator employed by the Plants For A Future Charity.

The organization participates in public discussion by publishing books. Members have participated in various conferences and are also participants in the International Permaculture Research Project.
