Attractions
Starlight is best known for two large farms which are open to the public year-round as tourist attractions. The farms offer customers the chance to pick their own fruits and vegetables, primarily apples and strawberries, or already-harvested produce. The two farms — Huber's Orchard & Winery and Joe Huber Family Farm & Restaurant  — have expanded over the years from simple "you-pick" operations to full-fledged attractions, with restaurants, petting zoos, winery and live entertainment. The farms offer visitors from nearby Louisville, Kentucky, and surrounding areas a chance to experience "a day in the country." The two farms are separate business however the owners are distantly related.

Starlight hosts a popular annual Starlight Strawberry Festival, held on Memorial Day weekend and sponsored by the local Roman Catholic parish.
