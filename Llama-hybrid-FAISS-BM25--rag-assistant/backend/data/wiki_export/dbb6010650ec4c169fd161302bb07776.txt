The Wrong Guy is a 1997 Canadian black comedy film directed by David Steinberg, and starring Dave Foley, along with David Anthony Higgins, Jennifer Tilly, Colm Feore and Joe Flaherty. It was written by Foley, Higgins and Jay Kogen.

The script was inspired by a sketch Foley wrote during his days with The Kids in the Hall.

Synopsis
Dorky executive Nelson Hibbert (Foley) gets passed over for a promotion after spending years angling for the job (including marrying one of his boss's daughters). Upon hearing the decision, he ends up shouting "I swear I will kill you!" as security drags him from the board room. Later, when he goes to confront his boss (Kenneth Welsh), he finds that the man has already been murdered, and, due to the scene he made earlier, assumes that he will be mistaken for the murderer.  Nelson flees, unaware that security cameras have already revealed the identity of the true killer to the authorities. Nelson tries to escape to Mexico, but along the way he meets both the real killer (Feore) and the murder's investigator, Detective Arlen (Higgins), who Nelson believes is trailing him. It turns out that Ken Daly, who acquired the promotion, had the company president killed in order to gain the spot quickly. Chaotic events transpire and Nelson meets a narcoleptic farm girl (Tilly). What follows is a bizarre series of misadventures marked with slapstick routines and constant one-liners.
