Constituency boundaries and council area 
The Galloway and Upper Nithsdale constituency was created at the same time as the Scottish Parliament, in 1999, with the name and boundaries of an  existing Westminster constituency. In 2005, however, Scottish Westminster (House of Commons) constituencies were mostly replaced with new constituencies.

Member of the Scottish Parliament 
Alex Fergusson represented the constituency from the 2003 election until its abolition in 2011, having previously been an MSP for the South of Scotland regional list from 1999 to 2003. Originally elected as a Conservative, he was the Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament from 2007 to 2011, a post which required him to relinquish party allegiance.
