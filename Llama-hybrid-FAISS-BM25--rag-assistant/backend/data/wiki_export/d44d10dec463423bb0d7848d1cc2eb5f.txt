History

The station was known as Leda station during planning, named after the nearby suburb of Leda. In March 1999, the Government of Western Australia released the South West Metropolitan Railway Master Plan. It laid out the route of and stations along the proposed railway between Perth and Mandurah. Leda station was one of the stations included in the plan. The station had a projected number of daily boardings of 1,030.

In August 2002, the government released a new master plan, after a change in the railway's route south from Perth, and through Rockingham. Leda station was removed from the list of stations proposed to be built initially, relegated to being a future prospect. At some point after that plan was released, it was decided to build Leda station along with the rest of the line initially.

For the construction of the railway to Mandurah, among other rail projects in Perth, New MetroRail was set up as a division of the Public Transport Authority. The design and construction of the Mandurah railway line was split up into eight "packages". Among the things that were part of Package A was the bulk earthworks for several stations on the line, including Wellard station. The $310 million contract for Package A was awarded to a joint venture between John Holland, MacMahon Contractors, and Multiplex Constructions Pty Ltd on 23 May 2004.

The actual construction of Wellard station, along with Cockburn Central station and Kwinana station, was part of Package B. The designer for Package B was Woodhead International Architects and MPS Architects. The design contract was awarded to them in April 2002, at a cost of $2.1 million. Expressions of interest for the construction of Package B opened in September 2003. The contract for the construction of Package B was awarded to the consortium of Doric Constructions and Brierty Contractors in March 2005, at a cost of $32 million. Construction on the station began in late 2005. By January 2007, the station was complete and handed over to the Public Transport Authority. Wellard station opened along with the rest of the Mandurah line on 23 December 2007.

Its design that incorporates parks, walkability, and rail proximity has earned it awards from the Urban Development Institute of Western Australia, Planning Institute Australia, Landscape Industries Association, and HIA Land-Corp. The development contains low- and medium-density residential development, as well as over  of parkland and conservation areas.
