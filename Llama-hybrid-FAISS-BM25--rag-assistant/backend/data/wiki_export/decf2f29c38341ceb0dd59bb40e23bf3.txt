Franz Hohler (born 1 March 1943) is a Swiss author and cabaret performer based in Zürich.

Life 

Hohler is the author of one-man programs and satirical programs for television and radio. He has written theater pieces, children's books, stories and novels. In 2002, he received the Kassel Literary Prize for Grotesque Humor, in 2005 the Art Prize of Zurich, in 2014 the Johann-Peter-Hebel-Preis.

One of Hohler's most famous works is the "Totemügerli". It's a Swiss-German story based upon a fabulous creature, written to make fun of the particular dialect spoken in the Canton of Bern by using words sounding like the Bernese dialect but which aren't real words. His collection of witty short stories Der Stein (2011) features border-crossing between the realistic and the fantastic. It is humorous and thought-provoking.
