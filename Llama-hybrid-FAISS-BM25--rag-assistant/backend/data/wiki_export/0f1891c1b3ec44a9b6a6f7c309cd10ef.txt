Abraham Laboriel López Sr. (born July 17, 1947) is a Mexican-American bassist who has played on over 4,000 recordings and soundtracks. Guitar Player magazine called him "the most widely used session bassist of our time". Laboriel is the father of drummer Abe Laboriel Jr. and of producer, songwriter, and film composer Mateo Laboriel. He is ranked No. 42 on Bass Player magazine's list of "The 100 Greatest Bass Players of All Time".

Biography 
Laboriel was born in Mexico City. His brother was Mexican rock singer Johnny Laboriel, and his sister is Mexican singer, film and television actress Ella Laboriel. Their parents were Garifuna immigrants from Honduras. The family was devoutly Catholic.

His father Juan José Laboriel started as a cab driver but in the 1920's became an integral part of the entertainment business in Mexico as a founding member of the actor's, musician's, composer's and film worker's associations, eventually becoming involved in over 200 films in various capacities. A classically trained guitarist, he switched to bass guitar while studying at the Berklee College of Music, graduating in 1972. It was during this time that Laboriel learned the importance of versatility as a musician. Henry Mancini encouraged Laboriel to move to Los Angeles, California, to pursue a recording career, which he did in 1976. He struggled to find work for two years, before finding his first gig on a road tour with Olivia Newton-John. After a consequent European tour with Al Jarreau, Laboriel settled into a full-time studio career in Los Angeles.

Laboriel has worked with Al Jarreau, Alan Silvestri, Alvaro Lopez and Res-Q Band, Alvin Slaughter, Andraé Crouch, Andy Pratt, Andy Summers,  Barbra Streisand, Billy Cobham, Chris Isaak, Christopher Cross, Crystal Lewis, Dave Grusin, DeBarge, Djavan, Dolly Parton, Don Felder, Don Moen, Donald Fagen, Dori Caymmi, Elton John, Engelbert Humperdinck, Freddie Hubbard, George Benson, Hanson, Herb Alpert, Herbie Hancock, Johnny Hallyday, Keith Green, Kelly Willard, Lalo Schifrin, Larry Carlton, Lee Ritenour, Leo Sayer, Lisa Loeb, Luis Miguel, Madonna, Michael Jackson, Nathan Davis, Paul Jackson Jr., Paul Simon, Phil Driscoll, Quincy Jones, Randy Crawford, Ray Charles, Ron Kenoly, Russ Taff, Stevie Wonder, and Umberto Tozzi, 

Laboriel was a founding member of the bands Friendship and Koinonia. With the latter he recorded four albums.

In addition Laboriel recorded several solo albums on which he recruited a cast of musicians that included Alex Acuña, Al Jarreau, Jim Keltner, Phillip Bailey, Ron Kenoly, and others. His son Abe Laboriel Jr. played drums.

In 2005, Abraham was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music by the Berklee College of Music.

Laboriel is now in the band Open Hands with Justo Almario, Greg Mathieson, and Bill Maxwell.
