History

In September 1992, the network went live under the name Europolitan, owned by Nordic Tel. Europolitan was the first mobile phone network company in Sweden to launch SMS and voice mail. During the late 1990s, Vodafone Group went on an acquisition spree that led to the acquisition of Nordic Tel. In the early-2000s various operating companies in the Vodafone Group changed their names to Vodafone.

After several years of under-performance, Vodafone Sweden was sold on 31 October 2005 to Telenor, the largest telecommunications company in Norway, for approximately €1 billion. It took the Telenor name on 20 April 2006.

In 2014, Telenor Sverige launched the discount prepaid phone flanker brand Vimla, meant to compete against Comviq, Halebop and Hallon, discount prepaid brands owned by Tele2, Telia and 3 Sverige respectively.

On 15 May 2018 the daughter company Bredbandsbolaget merged into Telenor Sweden.
