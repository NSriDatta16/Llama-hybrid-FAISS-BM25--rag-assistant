This region is located in an area of environmental preservation, in the Serra da Mantiqueira mountain range, at 1200 meters of altitude.

History

The name Visconde de Mauá bears homage to Irineu Evangelista de Sousa, baron and later viscount (in Portuguese = visconde), who received lands in the region in 1870, as a concession of the imperial government for wood exploration, that would be transformed into vegetal coal. In 1889, still in the Empire, his son, Enrique Irineu de Souza, installed in lands a colonial nucleus, formed for families of European immigrants. The initiative failed and most of the colonists returned to the native countries. In 1908 the federal government purchased the lands of Enrique and creates the Colonial Nucleus Visconde de Mauá, second attempt to receive European colonists. This nucleus finished in 1916.

Some German families had remained in Visconde de Mauá and, from the decade of 1930, they started to receive relatives and friends from Europe, initiating the tourist activity in the region. In the decade of 1970, the village of Maromba was discovered by hippies and, from the 1980s, became one of the preferred mountain destinations of tourists of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo.

Curiosity: Irineu Evangelista, viscount of Mauá, never was in the region that today takes its name.
