Kelenföld () is a neighborhood in Budapest, Hungary. It belongs to Újbuda, and located in the southern part of Buda. The large Kelenföld housing estate was built between 1967 and 1983 from pre-fabricated concrete blocks. The older streets around Bocskai út were mainly built in the first half of the 20th century. The Kelenföld railway station is an important transport hub of Buda, especially since 2014, when it gained convenient access to the city center thanks to the newly opened Metro Line M4. Kelenföld Power Station, the largest electrical generation plant in the world after its construction in 1912, is now a tourist attraction and has received coverage in the English-speaking world in recent years thanks in part to its Art Deco control room.
