Common elements

Gameplay 
The series is an early example of open-ended, non-linear gameplay. They lack a predetermined story path, but the player is instead given the choice of what missions to follow in whichever order while being able to visit almost any place in the game world at any time from the beginning. The ending can be determined by the player, who can alter the ending through their actions, can complete the game at almost any time, and continue playing the game even after the ending. Some of the games give the player the freedom to complete the game almost immediately after starting it, particularly Metal Saga, which could be completed with a full ending scenario just minutes into the game, making it the shortest possible RPG.

The character classes, such as a mechanic or soldier, could be chosen for the player characters, who would fight in turn-based battles either on foot or using tanks and other vehicles such as motors. The player could create tanks, customize and make a variety of modifications to them, remodel and enhance each part, strengthen the defence, repair damaged parts, and give them more shells.

Vehicle system 
One feature of Metal Max series is vehicle system. In games, player can seek and collect various kinds of vehicles, then change their equips and transform them.

Each human characters can drive vehicles. In early games, each playable character only can use one tank; in recent games, one tanks can accommodate multiple characters.

Vehicles contain six kinds of assembly unit: three for maintain operation and three for attacking enemies. Chassis is the outer casing that holds everything together. Each vehicles have their own unique chassis and can't be changed. Engine determines the maximum loadout for the vehicle. C Unit enables vehicles to be handled by a single crew member; without it, the vehicle cannot function. Main gun has grand power, but limited by ammunition along with smaller attack range. Sub gun has large fire range without ammunition, but low attack. Special equipment comes with large and high fire power, but heavy and/or expensive is high.

Vehicles are protected by mass-possessed armors. When vehicle is attacked, armors will be lost until zero. Without armor, the vehicle parts can become broken, and vehicle stops functioning when damaged seriously. Damaged vehicles can be repaired in towns or by mechanics.

Characters 
The Metal Max series features several recurring characters, like Dr. Minchi, and several wanted like Kamikaze King. These characters were designed by Atsuji Yamamoto.

Dr. Minchi is an electric shock expert, who is very into resurrection. When the player dies in a battle, the corpse(s) will be sent to － usually by his cyborg assistant Igor － him in every game. Dr. Minchi appears with a cheerful theme "Let's meet Dr. Minchi" ().

Since Metal Max 2, dogs can take part in player's team; dogs can join the battle, but have self-determined actions. Dogs can equip certain weapons and armours, use special items, but cannot drive vehicles. Dogs are usually named Pochi.

Some enemies also appear in multiple games. Kamikaze King is a bomb-like enemy with a single eye who has high defense, and very likely to escape. It attacks the player by self-destruction. It also appear in other forms, like Kamikaze Queen in Metal Max 3.

Development and release 

All Metal Max games and some Metal Saga titles were created by Hiroshi Miyaoka. Miyaoka is a friend of Yuji Horii － who created the Dragon Quest series － and joined the first three Dragon Quest games' development as a scenario assister and dungeon designer. He launched company Crea-Tech in 1988. Atsuji Yamamoto, Hiroshi Miyaoka's secondary schoolmate, designed for characters; and Satoshi Kadokura contributed musics. Tomoki Tauchi, known as "key man" of the series, directed several Metal Max games, also as a programmer of original Metal Max.

Data East era 
The first two games with a remake of the original game were released by video game company Data East.

The first Metal Max was originally planned to be released before next-generation console Super Famicom's arrival, but it was prolonged. It was finally released in end of Famicom era, 24 May 1991, while Super Famicom has been released in November 1990 yet. In television commercial message, the slogan "We've had enough of dragon-slaying" () was used. Compared with Dragon Quest and such games focused on story, Metal Max featured an open world similar as Square's Romancing SaGa.

The first sequel Metal Max 2 was released in 1993 on Super Famicom, which improved in accessible aspect.

Metal Max was remade on Super Famicom by Kuusoukagaku under the title Metal Max Returns.

Long break 
From 1996 to 2005, no new Metal Max games were added to the series.  After Metal Max 2 was released, Data East was asked about the third title but no answer was given by the company. Later the company went through troubles brought by management issues. Some companies also provided offers for developing a Game Boy title. During this period, the Japanese magazine Super Logo Design rumoured that Crea-Tech would publish Metal Max 3: Heart of Gold for the PlayStation. In a 2010 developer meeting, it was said that a PlayStation Metal Max 3 was conceived, but was given up due to development budget shortage.

In 1999, Care-Tech announced that the sequel would be published for the Dreamcast, and tentatively named it Metal Max Overdrive, and planned to be published by ASCII Entertainment, then later renamed it Metal Max: Wild Eyes and announced to be released in winter 2000. Wild Eyes was significantly influenced by MMORPG EverQuest in many aspects, which included a full 3D seamless map. This proposal was called as "the greatest love story in Metal Max history". However, due to ASCII management goind badly and withdrawing from video game market, and other reasons, the game was cancelled.

In the late 1990s, Data East ran into financial trouble and sold the games' remake rights to help them survive. Now Production received the rights to remake SNES title Metal Max 2 and Metal Max Returns for Game Boy Advance. Metal Max 2's remake version was published in June 20, 2003 and named Metal Max 2 Kai; "Kai" is literally translated as "modified", referred to add some wanted and rent tanks. Due to bugs in the game 2 Kai, Now Production recalled all of the cartridges, and the publishing of version 1.1. Just 5 days after 2 Kai was released, Data East declared bankruptcy, then the trademark was registered by Shinjuku Express, and insolvency representative of Data East court failed. Shinjuku Express was terminated from Data East's bankruptcy trustee and Metal Max Returns Kai was cancelled.

Success company era 
In 2005, Metal Saga was developed and published by Success for the PlayStation 2. The development team is a new team, while some staffs are fan of Metal Max. Hiroshi Miyaoka didn't join the project at the beginning, and new character designer instead of Atsuji Yamamoto. The game producer originally planned to port predecessors, but was declined because Success didn't hold licenses about old titles. Due to underestimation, the development period extended to two years and a half. The game was originally planned to feature 3D background with 2D characters, but for plenty of characters and overseas market release, the 3D effect was determined; this is the first 3D title of the series. A cheaper edition Metal Saga was released in March 2006 in Japan with minor changes. The game was released for North America in 2006 by Atlus, being the first time series released in English market.

Also in 2006, a sequel titled Metal Saga: Season of Steel was released in Japan for the Nintendo DS, which followed the story of Metal Max protagonist's son. Hiroshi Miyaoka designed the game again. The game featured 2D screen, and control with touch screen as a new attempt. Metal Saga Mobile, aka Metal Saga: the Melody of Linkage, was released for Japanese cellphone with 2 MByte capacity in July 2007; and then released for another cellphone brand. The fourth Metal Saga, Metal Saga: New Frontier, is a web MMORPG. The game is similar as online management simulation game. In the game, players control a "hunter company", manage hunters and vehicles, defeat wanted, and ally with other companies. The game was officially serviced in 2010 in Japan, and is operated in some other East Asia countries.

Kadokawa era 
In 2008, Enterbrain approached producer with a new title, but trademark problem was found after six months. In April 2009, Enterbrain registered the trademark "Metal Max", and Metal Max 3 was released in July 2010 by Kadokawa Games for the Nintendo DS, 17 years since predecessor numbered title Metal Max 2 was released. Considered that there were many light new users, and grinding might be boring, the protagonist have a high statistics with game starting. Based on Metal Max 3 engine, Nintendo DS remake of Metal Max 2 was released in 2011 and named Metal Max 2: Reloaded.

In June 2013, Metal Max 4: Gekkō no Diva was officially announced in Famitsu for the Nintendo 3DS. Like Metal Max 3, it is published by Kadokawa Shoten, and was released in November.
