Charities 
All proceeds made at Secret Garden are donated each year to various charities. Over the past seven years Secret Garden has raised more than $200,000 for charities including Oxfam, The Sarah Hilt Foundation and The Girls & Boys Brigade.

Reception 
Since its conception in 2009, Secret Garden has grown incredibly. In 2015 Australian radio station Triple J named it "One of Australia's much-loved boutique festivals ... providing two days worth of ace artists at a secret dairy farm". Time Out Sydney also praised the festival, telling punters "This is a good one, though, and worth the mystery. They keep the crowds at a limited capacity, the vibe is loved-up and the site teems with secret pathways and hidden pop-ups housing food, art and entertainment."

Other reviews include:

"A magical, wild and completely creative festival of music and art." - The AU Review

"Pillow forts, giant jellyfish and kissing booths — this independent festival has and always will be built by and for the people." - Concrete Playground

"The most magical of festivals to grace the Australian music scene" - Pedestrian TV
