Wide Prairie is a posthumous compilation album by Linda McCartney, compiled by her husband Paul McCartney and released in October 1998, roughly six months after her death due to breast cancer. The idea for the album was inspired by a fan who wrote Paul McCartney inquiring about "Seaside Woman", a song Wings released under the name Suzy and the Red Stripes featuring Linda on lead vocals.

Promotion and reception
To promote the album Paul McCartney held an 80 minutes webcast on 17 December 1998. During the show McCartney answered questions submitted by the fans about Linda and the recording of the album, played promo videos and cooked mashed potatoes.
The album reached #127 in the UK charts with two singles released in support. The title track made the top 75, at #74, while "The Light Comes from Within" charted at #56.
