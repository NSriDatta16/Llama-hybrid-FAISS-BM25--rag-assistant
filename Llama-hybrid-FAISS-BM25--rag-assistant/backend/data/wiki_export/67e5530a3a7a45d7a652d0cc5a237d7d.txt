The Boeing B-52 Stratofortress has been operational with the United States Air Force since 5 June 1955.  This list is of the units its assigned to, and bases stationed at.

In addition to the USAF, A single RB-52B (52-008) was flown by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) until it was retired on 17 December 2004.  It now is on static display at the west gate of Edwards AFB, California. One other B-52H (61-0025) was flown for many years by the Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards, and was transferred to NASA on 30 July 2001 as a replacement for the RB-52B. On 9 May 2008, that aircraft was flown for the last time to Sheppard AFB, Texas where it became a GB-52H maintenance trainer, never to fly again.

Historical Strategic Air Command MAJCOM B-52 units
Strategic Wings were established by Strategic Air Command in the late 1950s to disburse its B-52 bombers over a larger number of bases, thus making it more difficult for the Soviet Union to knock out the entire fleet with a surprise first strike.  A 4-Digit MAJCOM wing, they were considered as temporary, provisional units.

Beginning in 1962, in order to retain the lineage of the Strategic Wings as combat units and to perpetuate the lineage of many currently inactive bombardment units with illustrious World War II records, Headquarters SAC received authority from Headquarters USAF to discontinue its MAJCOM strategic wings that were equipped with combat aircraft and to activate AFCON units, most of which were inactive at the time which could carry a lineage and history.  Component units were also redesignated to historically linked units of the newly established wing.  Therefore, the history, lineage and honors of the World War II historical units were bestowed upon the newly established wing upon activation.
