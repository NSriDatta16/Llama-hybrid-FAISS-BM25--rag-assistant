History

Origins
The University of Agriculture, Faisalabad (Urdu: ), (formerly: Punjab Agricultural College and Research Institute), is a university in the city of Faisalabad, Punjab, Pakistan. It was established in 1906 as the first major institution of higher agricultural education in the undivided Punjab.

In 2009, the Vice Chancellor of the university said:
 
"Ours is the first agriculture university of the subcontinent so we are the trendsetters in this regard and have a specialised mandate. Faisalabad was chosen by our colonial rulers to set up an agriculture university as it was sandwiched between two canals".

At independence in 1947, Pakistan was a predominantly agricultural country. In spite of subsequent industrialisation and development, agriculture remains central to its economy. After independence, the Government of Pakistan appointed the National Commissions on Food and Education to reform the existing agrarian system and to formulate measures for developing better agricultural potential. The commissions made a plea for the establishment of an agricultural university for research and education. This resulted in the upgrade of the former Punjab Agricultural College and Research Institute in 1961. This had been the first university established by the British Empire. Plans were approved in 1906, and the foundation stone laying ceremony was carried out by Sir Louis Dane, the then lieutenant and governor of the Punjab. The college opened in 1909. The principal between 1923 and 1931 was Thomas Brownlie. By 1989, the university was reported to have 345 academic staff, 3,400 undergraduates and 600 postgraduates, and to be the country's "largest academic institution in agriculture".

The new campus is green with a conglomeration of monolithic blocks built in a modern style, and the old campus is reminiscent of traditional Muslim architecture. The main campus is situated in the centre of the city (12 km northeast of the Faisalabad International Airport), about 2 km away from the city centre and clock tower.

The university has a Zoology Museum, Art Gallery and University Library.

The university has hostels for men and women, including Jinnah Hostel (named after the founder of Pakistan Muhammad Ali Jinnah), Iqbal Hall, Fatima Jinnah Hostel and Hailey Hall. It accommodates over 15,000 students and approximately 12,000 day scholars.
