Mineirinho Arena (officially Estádio Jornalista Felipe Drummond), sometimes called just Mineirinho, is the biggest indoor sporting arena in Brazil. Located in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, the arena holds 25,000 people.

Mineirinho is located in the Sports Complex of Mineirão Stadium in the Pampulha, which was one of the headquarters of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2014 FIFA World Cup. The nickname (small Mineiro) is due to being located close to the larger Mineirão (big Mineiro), the stadium.

At the time of its construction, the now extinct ADEMG (Administração de Estádios do Estado de Minas Gerais), the organization responsible for building the arena, was administered by sportswriters, who decided to honor Felipe Drummond, one of the most important sportswriters in the history of Minas Gerais, for his work as a journalist.
