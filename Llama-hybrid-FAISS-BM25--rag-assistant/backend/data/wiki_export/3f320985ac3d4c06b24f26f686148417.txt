Butzbach () is a town in the Wetteraukreis district in Hessen, Germany. It is located approximately 16 km south of Gießen and 35 km north of Frankfurt am Main.

In 2007, the town hosted the 47th Hessentag state festival from 1 to 10 June.

The "Landgrafenschloss" ("landgraves' castle"), used by the United States Army until 1990, is now utilized by the city council. The so-called "Roman Way Housing" of the United States Army with more than 1000 apartments was returned to the German Government in October 2007 and since has been renovated and rented out to the public. The town's market place is enclosed by timber framing. The "Schrenzer" hill (or Heidelbeerberg, 385 m) overlooks the town and the country north of Frankfurt, called Wetterau. Another much higher mountain nearby is the Hausberg which features a look-out tower.
