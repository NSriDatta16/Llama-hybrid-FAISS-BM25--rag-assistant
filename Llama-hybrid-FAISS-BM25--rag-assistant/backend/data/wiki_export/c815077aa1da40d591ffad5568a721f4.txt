The Education of Max Bickford is an American drama television series that aired Sundays at 8:00 pm (EST) on CBS from September 23, 2001, to June 2, 2002, during the 2001–02 television season. After a strong initial launch, the show's audience 'dropped sharply afterward' despite its prime time slot following 60 Minutes. Within a month, two of its three executive producers were removed and reports claimed the show was being 'overhauled', though CBS denied this, preferring the term 'creative adjustments'. In May 2002, Touched by an Angel was returned to its Sunday 8 pm slot, bumping the second-to-last episode of The Education of Max Bickford to Monday. In June 2002, the final episode aired and the show was not renewed.

Overview
The series starred Richard Dreyfuss as the title character, a college professor of American Studies at Chadwick College, an all-women's school in Massachusetts. The series follows Max, a recovering alcoholic trying to rebuild his life, as he tries to prove that his teachings still carry relevance to a generation far different from his own. Often Max finds himself challenged by the faculty over his unorthodox style and his often cantankerous personality. Also starring was child actor Eric Ian Goldberg, who portrayed the young Lester Bickford, Max's son. Max's colleagues included Marcia Gay Harden as Andrea Haskell, his former student (and lover) who had recently joined the faculty, and Helen Shaver as his best friend, Erica, previously known as Steve before her transition. Max's daughter, Nell, played by Katee Sackhoff, attended the college.
