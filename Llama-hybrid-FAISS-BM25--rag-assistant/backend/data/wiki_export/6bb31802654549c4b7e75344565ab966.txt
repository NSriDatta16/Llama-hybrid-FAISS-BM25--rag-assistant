Ethel Marie Armes (1876 – 1945) was an American journalist, author and historian.

Biography
Born in Washington, D.C., to Col. George Augustus Armes and Lucy Hamilton Kerr (daughter of John Bozman Kerr), Armes was raised in Washington, D.C. where she attended private schools. She worked as a reporter for the Chicago Chronicle in 1899 and then The Washington Post during 1900–1903.

During the period from 1905–06 she was on the staff of the Birmingham Age-Herald and performed syndicated work for magazines and newspapers. She authored a number of important historical works.

In 1904 she became engaged to the Japanese poet Yone Noguchi and planned to join him in Japan, but broke off the engagement after learning that, during their engagement, he had been sexually involved with another woman, Léonie Gilmour, who had borne his child (future artist Isamu Noguchi).

She never married, but in 1925 she adopted a ten year old girl, Catherine, to whom she had been a foster parent. Her daughter married Richard W. Millar, and had two children.

Her burial site is at Oak Hill Cemetery, with her mother, Lucy Hamilton Kerr Armes, in Washington, D.C.
