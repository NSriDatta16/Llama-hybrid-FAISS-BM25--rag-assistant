Historical district boundaries
From 2003 through 2013, the district consisted of parts of downtown Los Angeles, including Downey, Bellflower and Maywood. Due to redistricting after the 2010 United States Census, the district pivoted north east within Los Angeles County and still includes downtown Los Angeles and areas north east.
