History
Cadet College, Hasan Abdal was the first Cadet college in Pakistan in 1952. It was established by the Punjab government and initiated by General Muhammad Ayub Khan (then Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army) to serve as a feeder institution to the Services Academies. For this purpose, military wings were started in 1952 at Government College, Sahiwal, and Islamia College, Peshawar. When the present buildings were completed in April 1954, these military wings were transferred to Hasan Abdal and the new college opened as Punjab Cadet College, with Hugh Catchpole as the founding Principal. In 1960, the government created a Board of Governors to exercise administrative control over the college. The members of the board include the Honorable Governor of Punjab — Chairman Board of Governors, Chairman POF’s Board — Vice Chairman, Commissioner, Rawalpindi Division (Member), Secretary, Finance Dept, Govt of Punjab - Member, Secretary School, Education Dept, Govt of Punjab — Member and
Principal, Cadet College Hasanabdal — Member. Since then, it has been known as Cadet College Hasanabdal.
