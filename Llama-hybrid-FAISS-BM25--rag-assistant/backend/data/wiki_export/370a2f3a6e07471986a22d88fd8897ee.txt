The road was first paved in the late-19th century.  Modernistic buildings were added in the 1950s to the north and later, street lights and traffic lights were posted at the used intersections including Ermou, Evrypidou, Sofokleous and Lykourgos.  In the 1990s, smaller lampposts were posted and the northern section along with Omonoia was under reconstruction and a section became a walkway, pedestrian traffic lights were added with full access to the Omonia metro station.
