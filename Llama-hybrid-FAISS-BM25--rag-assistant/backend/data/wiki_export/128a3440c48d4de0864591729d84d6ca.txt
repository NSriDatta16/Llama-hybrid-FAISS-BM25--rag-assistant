Two singles were released to promote the album—"Dillinger & Young Gotti", which composed of fours songs: "Dipp With Me", "Gangsta Like" (without Xzibit's verse), "Party At My House" and "You Justa Bitch", and "Coastin" with accompanying music video.

Background
Both Tha Dogg Pound members, Daz Dillinger and Kurupt, have been signed with Death Row Records since the label's inception in 1992. In 1995, they released their debut studio album Dogg Food, which became a success. Kurupt left Death Row in 1997 and opened his Antra Records imprint in 1998. He went on releasing two solo albums, Kuruption! in 1998 and Tha Streetz Iz a Mutha in 1999, where Daz appeared as one of guest rappers and producers on both projects.

Daz released his first solo studio album, Retaliation, Revenge and Get Back, in 1998 on Death Row. In late 1999 he parted ways with the label and started release music via his own independent record label D.P.G. Recordz. Year 2000 saw the release of his second solo studio album R.A.W. through his own label, where Kurupt also took part. In early 2001, Daz released two albums, Long Beach 2 Fillmoe and Game for Sale, in collaboration with JT the Bigga Figga, a fellow rapper and record producer from San Francisco. In the latter, Kurupt recorded a verse to one of the songs.

Due to Death Row Records owned the rights to the 'Tha Dogg Pound' name, Kurupt and Daz released Dillinger & Young Gotti under the name 'DPG' (which stands for the 'Dogg Pound Gangstaz'). A few months after the release of their second studio album and Kurupt's third solo album Space Boogie: Smoke Oddessey, Death Row released Death Row Presents... Tha Dogg Pound 2002, a collection of previously unreleased material recorded and produced by the duo while they were signed to the label, under 'Tha Dogg Pound' moniker, touting it as the group's sophomore studio album.

Aftermath
In early 2002, Kurupt re-signed with Death Row Records (rebranded as Tha Row Records) as a solo artist in exchange for the position of Vice President of the label, which sparked a feud between himself and the rest of the DPGC, including Daz and Snoop Dogg, and led to the disintegration of Tha Dogg Pound. The duo verbally attacked each other off the reel recording subsequently multiple diss tracks from 2002 to 2004. Daz took aim at Kurupt, Death Row, Ja Rule and Benzino on his 2003 fourth solo studio album DPGC: U Know What I'm Throwin' Up, while Kurupt heavily responded on his 2004 Originals project.

Kurupt's fourth solo album Against the Grain was being prepared for release in 2004 for Tha Row. After multiple delays, the album was finally dropped in 2005, when Kurupt had already left the label due to label CEO Suge Knight's incarceration.

Daz had six solo projects released, including a collaborative album with Houston rapper Nuwine between his solo albums. In April 2005, at a The Western Conference meeting hosted by Snoop Dogg, the two ended their feud, and on November 1 of that year, a sequel and third studio album, Dillinger & Young Gotti II: Tha Saga Continuez... was released.
