Ichabod and I is the debut album by British indie rock band The Boo Radleys, released in 1990 on the indie label Action Records. It has never been released on CD. Steve Hewitt, the drummer for this album, would later join Placebo.

Background
The Boo Radleys formed in Liverpool in 1988 between childhood friends Simon "Sice" Rowbottom, who sung and played guitar, and Martin Carr, a guitarist. School friend Tim Brown joined on bass; after various other individuals, Steve Hewitt appeared on drums. They made their live debut at the Victoria bar in New Brighton, Merseyside, and in the following year, made a five-track demo. Friend of the band, Mark Wareing, was in Dandelion Adventure, who had signed to the Preston-based label Action Records. Waring subsequently gave a tape of the Boo Radleys' demo to the label.

Author Dave Thompson, in his book Alternative Rock (2000), wrote that its title was "steeped in American literary lore, but otherwise [its music was] echoing the distinctly English sounds of My Blood Valentine and Ride," both prominent acts of the British shoegaze scene.
