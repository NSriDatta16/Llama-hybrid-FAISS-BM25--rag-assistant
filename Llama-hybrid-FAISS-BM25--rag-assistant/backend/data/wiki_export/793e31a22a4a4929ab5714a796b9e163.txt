Route 109 is a Quebec provincial highway that runs through the western regions of Abitibi-Témiscamingue and Nord-du-Québec. It begins at Route 117 in Rivière-Héva, proceeding north approximately  to Amos. From there, the highway extends  to Matagami, where the road continues northwards as James Bay Road (French: Route de la Baie James). While now classified as a municipal road, the James Bay Road was part of provincial Route 109 until 2002. Consequently, some maps may still identify it as such.

The 182 km section of Route 109 between Saint-Dominique-du-Rosaire and Matagami winds through complete wilderness and no services exist at all here. There is however extensive logging taking place along this section.
