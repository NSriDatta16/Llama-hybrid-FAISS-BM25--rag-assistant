The Californian Stakes is an American Thoroughbred horse race run annually in late April at Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, California (relocated from the now closed Hollywood Park Racetrack in Inglewood, California). The Grade II event is open to horses age three and up willing to race one and one-eighth miles (9 furlongs) on the dirt.  This race serves as a key prep to the Hollywood Gold Cup.

Inaugurated in 1954, winner Imbros set a new track record of 1:41.00 which also equaled the then world record for a mile and sixteenth on dirt.

Since inception the race has been contested at three different distances:
  miles (8.5 furlongs) : 1954-1979
  miles (9 furlongs)1980-1984, 1987â€“present
 1 mile (8 furlongs) : 1985-1986
