Augsburg Hochzoll is one of the seventeen highest level civic divisions, or Planungsräume (planning district), of the city of Augsburg, Bavaria, Germany. It is located in the east of the city, and is bordered on its west by the Lech river, whose waters also feed the artificial Kuhsee (Cow lake) to the south of Hochzoll. To the east, Hochzoll shares its city border with a district of the town of Friedberg (Friedberg West). As of December 31, 2022 the population of Hochzoll was 20,872.

History
The history of Hochzoll began with a bridging over the Lech river in 980. As the Lech is the historical border between Oberbayern (Upper Bavaria) and Schwaben (Swabia), and as the construction of bridges was very expensive at the time, a bridge toll was raised (HochZoll - High Tariff). Since the town charter for the Friedberg municipality in 1264, the Lech has also served as the border between Augsburg and Friedberg. Today's Hochzoll district then belonged to Friedberg and was referred to as Friedberger Au.

Timeline

The history of the district has always been strongly shaped by the construction of bridges.
 1639 the Lech bridge goes up in flames as a result of war and can only be rebuilt through subsidies from the realm of the city of Augsburg.
 1646 during the siege of Augsburg by French and Swedish armies, the bridge again goes up in flames.

Road and rail links
The main road through Augsburg Hochzoll is the Bundesstrasse 300, also designated as the Bundesstrasse 2 for the section which goes through Hochzoll. The latter turns to the south in the east of Hochzoll, and forms part of the border between Hochzoll and Friedberg West.

Approximately 200 meters south of the road bridge, a bridge on the Augsburg-Munich railway line also crosses the Lech. East of the railway bridge is the Hochzoll station, at which the Paartalbahn railway line branches off the main route to Ingolstadt. This light-rail route runs roughly parallel to the B 300, while the main route of the Augsburg–Munich line turns south towards Munich.
