Angelic Pretty (formerly Pretty from 1979–2001) is a Japanese apparel brand specializing in lolita fashion. The brand was established as Pretty in 1979 by Hiroko Honda, with its flagship store opened at Laforet in the Harajuku region of Tokyo, Japan, selling apparel from amateur designers. After Honda decided to focus on original apparel, the store was rebranded as "Angelic Pretty" in 2001.

Brand concept
Angelic Pretty's concept is centered on fantasy and described as "princesses in picture books" that were dreamed of as a child. The store and clothing all use the color pink, with different shades and arrangements corresponding to the season and fashion trends.

History

In 1979, Hiroko Honda opened Pretty at Laforet in Harajuku, Tokyo, selling lolita and gothic style dresses from amateur designers. Honda curated her selection based on cuteness. She stated that, at the time, Pretty was one of the only retailers in Tokyo that sold lolita clothing. Around 2000, Honda decided to focus on creating original apparel based on her aesthetics after customer feedback. The store's brand and image received a rehaul and was then rebranded into Angelic Pretty. Afterwards, Asuka joined as a designer, and Maki joined shortly after in 2004.

Products

Angelic Pretty sells petticoat dresses, blouses, jewelry, and other fashion accessories. The dresses are described as having bows, ruffles, prints, and waist ties, while most blouses have pastel lace and removable collars. The original print fabric and lace are produced in Japan. The prints use "delicate motifs" and "subtle colors." The dresses are produced in one size, but they are designed to fit a variety of body shapes. In addition, despite the "outlandish" and "formal" designs, the dresses are meant for everyday wear and include pockets.

Angelic Pretty has created collaboration dresses with Creamy Mami, the Magic Angel, Macross Frontier, Final Fantasy, and Miffy. They have also collaborated with other fashion brands such as Jenny Fax.
