Soulton Hall is a Tudor country house near Wem, England. It was a 16th century architectural project of Sir Rowland Hill, publisher of the Geneva Bible. Hill was a statesman, polymath and philanthropist, later styled the "First Protestant Lord Mayor of London" because of his senior role in the Tudor statecraft that was needed to bring stability to England in the fall out of the Reformation. The building of the current Soulton Hall, undertaken during the tumult of the Reformation,  is therefore associated with the political and social work required to incubate the subsequent English Renaissance.

Soulton Hall is understood to be constructed in an elaborate set of humanist codes drawing together concepts from classical antiquity, geometry, philosophy and scripture.  It is further understood that the building influenced the architecture of many later buildings of similar style.

With a hidden chapel in its basement, a priesthole, and bookcases hidden within its thick walls to hide heretical documents, Soulton Hall is likely to have served as a base for the conspiracy which led to the publication of the Geneva Bible, which bears the name of Rowland Hill on its frontispiece as publisher. 

The grounds of the hall contain archaeology of a lost theatre. Emerging scholarship links the manor to Shakespeare, and in particular the play As You Like It which concerns the estate of a character called "Old Sir Rowland".

Mentioned in the Norman Domesday Book, Soulton has housed a manor since late Anglo Saxon times, and a "lost castle" rediscovered in 2021 undergoing a multi-season archaeological investigation by DigVentures. 

The modern manor incorporates a working farm pioneering various sustainable agriculture approaches, and also houses a series of contemporary monuments including standing stones and long barrow burial site.

Sir Rowland Hill's renaissance hall

The present hall building was constructed between 1556 and 1560 by Sir Rowland Hill, but is only the corps de logis (private block) of a much bigger palace complex subsequently muted and lost in intervening stages of development. It is constructed of brick, produced at the site, with Grinshill stone dressings.

Hill was the first Protestant Lord Mayor of London in 1549, and, as Sheriff of London. Hill was the coordinator of the Geneva Bible project and an enthusiastic patron of the arts, in particular drama. He has been linked with the character of Old Sir Rowland in Shakespeare's As You Like It. He was also involved in the case which established Parliamentary Privilege.

House of state, literary connections and inspiration 
Soulton was acquired by Hill and his protégé Thomas Leigh in 1556 from Thomas Lodge.  Lodge's son, also called Thomas Lodge, would have been familiar with the woods at Soulton.  Lodge Jr was the writer and dramatist, who wrote prose tale of Rosalynde, Euphues Golden Legacie, which, printed in 1590, from which William Shakespeare took inspiration when writing his pastoral comedy 'As you like it'.

Hill was a close associate of Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton (whose grandson Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton was the dedicatee of Shakespeare's sonnets) to the point of attending the private burial with the family on his death.

The third Earl's wife Elizabeth Vernon is associated with Hill via her grandfather, who shared his childhood with Rowland Hill with them both being baptised at Hodnet within a couple of years of each other, and both families having stationed links to the area.  Another Vernon, Margaret Vernon, a daughter of George Vernon, was the wife of Sir Thomas Stanley, whose family reputedly patronised Shakespeare, and is and is also associated with the writer to whom their epitaphs have been attributed to the writer in St Bartholomew's Church in Tong, Shropshire.

Within the building are traces of older Tudor or medieval building phases on the site, with timber materials re-used from predecessors of the manor's various halls. Examples of simple pargeting can be seen within the building.

To the east of the hall is what is now a walled garden, accessed by steps from the terrace on the north, or by a Tudor gate to the north.

At the front of the hall is a Pillared forecourt, again part of the 1550s design concept.

Clandestine features

Geometric code

Cosmati pavement and Rombic dodecahedrons 
The Tudor hall's unusual quoining relate to Anglo-Saxon architecture, while incorporating other features at that time only seen in the architecture of Corpus Christi College Cambridge. This together with its unusual strict geometry and the mathematical relationship between the hall and walled garden, represent a geometric philosophical allegory seen in stately architecture as diverse as the Anglo-Saxon Mercian royal crypt at Repton, and the Coronation Theatre of Henry III at Westminster Abbey with the Cosmati Pavement at its centre. 

The geometry is understood, as stated by James D. Wenn include commentary on sacred geometry:

Soulton’s sermon in stones concerns the geometry of the rhombic dodecahedron — a solid that has certain ‘perfect’ characteristics, including that it can fill space (as cubes can), and is the 3D projection of a 4D Platonic Solid called the hyperdiamond. The former characteristic lends it an allegorical quality, because the concept of a civilised person fitting into a society, often represented by cubes, is made a little more complex and nuanced. Everybody can fit into a harmony, but it may take some patience — indeed, tolerance — to find the right fit. The connection to the fourth spatial dimension invokes ideas of God’s power beyond the constraints of time, as discussed by ancient theologians such as Boethius.

Even before Boethius, these ideas were discussed in ancient Greek philosophy. Plato’s book Timaeus sought to reflect the harmony of the natural world, and by the invention of the Atlantis story (which later inspired Bacon), attempted to encourage civic harmony, too.

Representation of Holy Amandal

Soulton is thought to have been copied by Francis Bacon when he built Verulam House. It is further thought that the construction of Soulton Hall (with its lost pyramidal roof) is done to represent a Holy Almandal.

Ellusis 

The whole precinct of the hall and linked courts to the north, east and south is matched to the geometry of the Telesterion at Ellusis, giving a compound of 55 yards square. This shows conscious engagement with those Greek mysteries. At Soulton a nine grid is laid over the precinct to give compartments of 55 foot squares.  The current hall itself if 55 foot cubed: a number which recurs at the Washington Monument, amongst other places. These observations were first made in modern times by James D. Wenn.

Parker connection 
These features of the hall's design may have been influenced by the scholarship of Hill's contemporary, historian and protestant theologian Matthew Parker of Cambridge.

Concealed chapel 

The basement of the house contains a room called the 'Ædicule'; a concealed chapel in the east front (which is the only truly symmetrical face of the 1550s design and is intended to conjure Solomon's Temple).

The central position of this room was prioritised so strongly that its doorway interrupts a load-bearing wall supporting the hall above, thus requiring that other walls had to be reinforced. It is the only room in the building to have a central window.

The house's alignment is taken from this room which addresses the range of dates possible for the celebration of Easter.

Dancing pavement 

To the south of the current hall is a cobbled yard of Victorian date (1847). It is based on similar patterns seen at the preserved Tudor Hall at Plas Mawr it is likely the design was taken from Tudor features within the hall lost during subsequent renovations. Scholars have interpreted this as a dancing pavement linked to some of the ideas of harmony explored by Ptolemy.

Priest hide 

There is a priest hide on the principle floor of the house in the south west corner of the building in a turret containing several chimneys, in the interior of the room (believed to be Sir Rowland Hill's studiolo). It is not known whether this hiding place was ever used but provides evidence of early intent to use the building as a safehouse, from the time of its construction. More associated with the hiding of Catholics during the reign of Elizabeth I of England, the early date of the priest hole's inclusion in the architecture at Soulton combined with Rowland Hill's position suggests they were more likely intended for use to hide prominent protestants such as Matthew Parker from the inquisitions of Mary I. Uniquely among protestant leaders Parker did not flee England yet somehow survived. His whereabouts, and that of his library during this time have always been a matter of speculation. It has thus been inferred that Parker may have been sheltered at Soulton by Rowland Hill, with whom he was later associated, not least by both being Commissioners for Ecclesiastical Causes at the dawn of Elizabeth I's reign.

The history of the priest-hole has been memorialised by the addition of a modern plaque which says:  Behind this tablet lies a space believed to have been intended to be used to hide scholars and priests from the authorities during the turmoil of the sixteenth century.
This memorial honours all who have suffered persecution for their beliefs.

On the beams in this room there are also quotations from Michel de Montaigne.

Epidaurus Court, a Tudor theatre space 

A theatre court, modelled on the Ancient Theatre of Epidaurus, was built by Hill in the precinct of the house to the east of the current hall: the hall itself forms the theatre screen.

This was completed by 1560 and therefore predates Teatro Olimpico and the Elizabethan Theatres such as The Globe and The Rose.

Parlours in the basement and Rithmomachia Floor 

Some of the basement rooms retain their original Tudor treatment, including flooring, indicating that these were 'polite' rooms, rather than service spaces.

One of these rooms (The Rithmomachia Room) contains in the tiles a games board for Rithmomachia, which is an early European bard game also known as The Philosopher's Game, an account of which Sir Rowland Hill printed with the title The most ancient and learned Playe, called the Philosopher's Game invented for the honest recreation of Students and other sober persons, in passing the tedious of tyme to the release of their labours, and the exercise of their Wittes.

Other features

Curtilage buildings 
The broader precinct incorporates a number of 18th-century farm buildings constituting a 'model farm' from the Regency Era Age of Improvement. Most intact among these is a linear range now known as Soulton Court bearing a 1783 datestone relating to later work, but incorporating an earlier manorial hall or courtroom of unknown date prior to the mid-1600s.

This courtroom is traditionally associated with an aborted witch trial of the 17th century.

Restoration door case 
In 1668 a semi-circular door case bearing the marital coat of arms of Thomas Hill, a descendant of Sir Rowland's and a friend of Samuel Pepys was added above the front door.

Lost buildings 
A dovecot once existed to the south west of the garden wall which was dismantled by the end of the 1800s.

An octagonal horse engine existed in the 1780s buildings just outside the base court to the north west.

Landscape gardens 
The landscape across the current farm and beyond to Hawkstone was recruited by Hill to make allegorical references to scripture.

Symbols

Coat of arms 
The arms of Thomas Hill, sometime high sheriff of Shropshire were added above the senior door in 1668.

Flag and badge 
The house flag is a square teal banner with an eight-pointed star inside a circle, with looping garlands between the points of the star: three of these garlands are shaded and five are not. This symbol is taken from the preserved Dancing Pavement on the site and found in documents in the hall's archive.

Linked buildings

In the region 

The house of Bachegraig/Bach-y-Graig is understood to be 'the first brick house in Wales', built by Sir Rowland Hill's associate Richard Clough has been argued to have been based on Soulton Hall. That house is acknowledged to the be in an Antwerp style by Flemish craftsmen and were the first brick houses in Wales. While Clough's house has been demolished it shows important features in the Soulton design that were altered in later phases.

The architectural and political project that Sir Rowland Hill instigated is understood to have continued to yield fruits in the immediate area, Hawkstone Abbey Farm and Hawkstone Hall are both buildings taking stylistic cues from the building. Attingham Park, also a Hill house, is also thought to be within the wider cultural project. 

The house is historically associated with St Mary's Church, Edstaston: the name of the house and family is carved into the church porch in the 1600s signifying their patronage.

In London 
The historian James D. Wenn has noted a close connection with Sir Christopher Wren's St Mary Abchurch, which is the same size and shape.

In the United States 

Some affinity both architectural, and by family connections has been attributed to Soulton with various early colonial American buildings, in particular Rosewell (plantation) in Virginia.

History

Saxon and earlier

Within the manor is evidence of Bronze Age habitation, and some signs of Neolithic activity.

The name of the manor is Saxon and means either 'settlement with a plough' or 'settlement with reeds' or possibly 'settlement in/near a gully' .

The manor of Soulton existed at the time of the Domesday Book in 1086 (see: PASE Domesday) and is recorded as "Svltune". The Domesday Book records the manor as having previously been freely held by Brihtric — most likely the same Brihtric who was the brother of Eadric Streona the Ealdorman of Mercia from 1007 to 1017. Both Brihtric and Eadric were slain by King Cnut on Christmas Day, 1017.

Based on its Domesday Book entry there are likely to have been buildings on or near to the site of the extant hall prior to the Norman Conquest, but these have yet to be identified archaeologically.

Post-Norman

A Norman (possibly Adulterine) castle was constructed approximately 300 meters to the north-east of the extant hall either during the Anarchy of the early 1100s, or later, certainly by the 1250s. 

The location is marked by a mound which can still be seen. This site is located around the point at which the roadway crosses a narrow gap in some wet terrain which would likely have had a strategic reason for establishing a fortification in that location. This building is believed to have burnt down at some point in the late 14th century.

A grant of the manor in 1299 indicates that some of the ancient marker posts marking the boundary with Wales formed part of the boundary of the manor.

The manor supported the clergy of the King's Chapel of St Michael in Shrewsbury Castle.

Post-1556

Civil War 

In September 1642, Charles I passed within sight of Soulton Hall, and subsequently set up a temporary capital at Shrewsbury. 

In 1643, the first Parliamentary garrison in Shropshire was declared at nearby Wem. On 17-18 October, the Royalists responded by sending a large force to the district, described as follows:3 cannon, 2 drakes, one great mortarpiece that carried a 30ln. bullet, had 120 odd wagons and carriages laden with bread, biskett, bare and other provisions and theire armye being formydable as consistynge of neer 5,000.The Royalist attackers only formed up on one side, approaching Wem only from Soulton Road. The engagement does not seem to have been seriously interested in taking Wem with the commander, Lord Capel, light-heartedly smoking his pipe half a mile from the town on that road. The town was not taken and the manoeuvre lasted less than a day resulting in this couplet.The women of Wem and a few musketeers.

Beat the Lord Capel and all his Cavaliers. 

Immediately after the engagements around Soulton, Charles I disbanded his temporary headquarters in Shropshire and made for Oxford.

The Battle of Edge Hill, followed a few days later on 23 October 1642. After this incident it is further recorded the houses of the family "[were] pillaged, and ransacked by the rebel [parliamentarians]", and after this that family had to go into hiding in the Hawkstone landscape and caves.

The following February of 1643, Price Rupert is recorded as being repeatedly in the district.

Restoration 
In the late 17th century Soulton had passed to Thomas Hill, who attended Oriel College, Oxford matriculating in 1662, and went on to be made High Sheriff of Shropshire in 1680. He was later made a commissioner in an act of Parliament in 1698. He was buried in Wem Church with his wife Elizabeth, a member of the Corbet family.

Another member of the family, Richard Hill was admitted to Grays Inn in 1657. 

Soulton Hall became the venue of an abortive witch trial some time around 1660. The suspected witch under accusation by local townsfolk of Wem was brought before Thomas Hill of Soulton, as justice of the district. The accused was spared any judicial processing as a witch and that allegation was dismissed, in contrast to the harsh persecutions of the time.

Eighteenth century and later 

There are records that Benjamin Franklin was in communication with the family and was aware of the place. 

There is an 1801 bridge on which Thomas Telford worked on the B5065, known as Soulton Bridge.

There are also the remains of a water mill active from at least the 1300s until the mid-to-late 1800s near Soulton Wood.

The manor is still owned by the wider family of the original family of Sir Rowland Hill via female descent.

Culture 

In 1483, Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham was arrested on the edge of the manor following the failure of Buckingham's rebellion. This incident is referred to by William Shakespeare in the play Richard III, in ACT IV, scene iv.

Filming 
There is periodic filming at the manor, including recently of BBC Countryfile .

Contemporary drama and live performance 

In 2020, during the crisis in live performance and theatre resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, outdoor performance was reintroduced to Soulton. The National Youth Theatre (NYT) gave their first live in person performance since the restrictions following the lockdown that was brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. The play was a new, specially devised work called The Last Harvest In 2021, the NYT returned with a performance of Animal Farm.

In October 2021 Soulton Hall hosted an immersive performance of the Old English epic poem Beowulf, together with a selection of shorter pieces of Old English and Old Welsh poetry, by early medieval living history/reconstructive archaeology group Thegns of Mercia, titled Beowulf at the Barrow. The performance took place around the site, with the historic Moot Hall representing the great hall Heorot, and the Soulton Long Barrow representing the dragon's lair and Beowulf's own burial mound, serving as venue for the final sections of the poem.

Public affairs 
Michela Gove visited as Secretary of State for DEFRA in 2017.

In 2021, during the North Shropshire by-election, the various candidates and media were headquartered at the manor.

Dance 
An eighteenth century dance, the Soulton Jigg, is linked to the manor and published in John Walsh's 1740 "The Second Book of the Compleat Country Dancing-Master".

Material from the Soulton collection concerning its dancing pavement was loaned to the inaugural John Weaver Festival of Dance, (marking the 350th anniversary of the birth of the Shropshire-born "Father of English ballet").

Literaturary and other publishing 
The manor is referenced in the following books:

 Regenesis: Feeding the World Without Devouring the Planet by George Monbiot
 Wilderland and Hill and Dale, both by Andrew Fusek Peters
 Riding Out by Simon Parker
 How to Love Animals by Henry Mance
 Stones of the Magi by James D. Wenn (forthcoming)

Poetry

Merlin Fuhcher is the poet in residence.

Archaeology 
The manor includes various protected archaeology.

An official excavation with DigVentures took place in June 2019. The excavation of a mound (a scheduled ancient monument) revealed the existence of a structure which might be a castle from the 13th to 15th centuries, according to an archaeologist. As the dig continued, medieval artifacts were also unearthed, including an ampulla, a necklace, cups, bowls, and jug handles. These have been dated to circa 1250.

Heritage status 
Soulton Hall is a listed building, along with its walled gardens, pillared forecourt and carved stone work. Soulton Bridge, crossing Soulton Brook is a Grade I listed structure, built in 1801 by Thomas Telford.

An ongoing project to improve the presentation of the hall and its history was begun in 2022 by the Ashton family with advice and guidance from architectural history consultant James Wenn of Byrga Geniht, involving re-furnishing rooms to a state more representative and sensitive to their Tudor heritage. 

As part of this inscriptions have been added to the entry-way which encourage visitors toward consideration of the building's themes.

A plaque at the entrance to the hall reads:Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile,Hath not old custom made this life more sweetThan that of painted pomp? Are not these woodsMore free from peril than the envious court?'Here feel we not the penalty of Adam...And this our life, exempt from public haunt,Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,Sermons in stones, and good in everything.

- William Shakespeare, 'As You Like It', Act II, Scene 1. The Forest of Arden

It is believed that affairs of state that took place at Soulton in the time of Sir Rowland Hill, in the sixteenth century, inspired Shakespeare to write this play and shaped several others.

Gold lettering above the door reads:
UT ROSA FLOS FLORUM, SIC EST ISTA DOMUS DOMORUM

[As the rose if the flower of flowers, so this is the house of houses]Similar inscriptions can be found in the Chapter House of York Minster. and Westminster Abbey.
The connections of the building to the Classical philosophy and geometry of Ancient Greece are represented with an insctription from Isocrates echoing a 1600s carving on what is now Shrewsbury Library.
ἐὰν ᾖς φιλομαθής, ἔσει πολυμαθής,[If you loving learning you will become wise]

There is a banner for St Erkenwald in the studiolo.

Contemporary monuments

Long Barrow 
A modern long barrow, Soulton Long Barrow, has been constructed on farmland north of Soulton Hall. Begun in 2017, the site became operational in 2019. The new monument was covered on an episode of BBC Countryfile, being visited by Matt Baker and Ellie Harrison in April 2019.

Standing stones 

 

Three megalithic limestone standing stones are located on the access route to the barrow. These were added to the approach route to the barrow in autumn 2017. The stone for these monoliths, as with the barrow itself came from Churchfield Quarry, Oundle, near Peterborough. There is no deliberate alignment beyond way-marking for these standing stones. In 2020, a standing stone, with an alignment to the setting sun on the winter solstice, was added to the ritual landscape to acknowledge the suffering of the families impacted by the Coronavirus pandemic.

Farm

There is a farm at the manor, including Soulton Wood.

The farm practices no-till farming. This was covered in an episode of BBC Countryfile in April 2019 with Matt Baker.

Research cooperation between Harper Adams University and Oxford University looking at the results of cultivation on Soil ecology, which used DNA sequencing of the soil biome has been hosted on the farm.

The woodland is largely oak with some cherry and ash. In total the woodland covers about 50 acres and it is designated ancient woodland. Material from the wood was supplied for repair of the House of Commons after bomb damage in the Second World War.
