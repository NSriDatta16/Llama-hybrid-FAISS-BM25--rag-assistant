Flosta (historic: Flougstad) is a former municipality in the old Aust-Agder county in Norway. The  municipality existed from 1902 until its dissolution in 1962. It is currently part of the municipality of Arendal in Agder county.  The administrative center of Flosta was at Staubø in the village of Kilsund. The municipality primarily encompassed the two islands of Flostaøya and Tverrdalsøya and about  on the mainland just north of the islands including the villages of Eikeland, Borås, and Vatnebu.

History
The municipality of Dybvaag was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law), and this municipality included all of what would later become Flosta municipality. On 1 January 1902, the new municipality of Flosta was established when the islands of Flostaøya and Tverrdalsøya and some of the mainland north of those islands (population: 1,892) separated from the municipality of Dybvaag.

During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1962, the municipalities of Stokken (population: 2,783), Austre Moland (population: 1,607), and Flosta (population: 1,205) as well as Strengereid area in neighboring Tvedestrand (population: 375) were all merged to create the new municipality of Moland. Later, on 1 January 1992, Moland (including the area of Flosta) was merged into the municipality of Arendal.

Name
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the island of Flostaøya () since the historic Flosta Church was built there. The meaning of the name is unknown, but one theory is that it comes from the word  which means "high tide" or "flood".

Government
During its existence, this municipality was governed by a municipal council of directly elected representatives. The mayor was indirectly elected by a vote of the municipal council.

Municipal council
The municipal council  of Flosta was made up of 13 representatives that were elected to four year terms. The tables below show the historical composition of the council by political party.
