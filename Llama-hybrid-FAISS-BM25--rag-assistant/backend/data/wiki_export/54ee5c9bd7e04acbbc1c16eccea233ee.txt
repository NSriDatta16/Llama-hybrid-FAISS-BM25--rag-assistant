Frederick Corbet "Fred" Davison (September 3, 1929 – April 28, 2004) was the President of the University of Georgia (UGA) in Athens.  He served in that capacity from 1967 until his resignation in 1986.

Early life and education
Davison attended Oxford College of Emory University before transferring to UGA in 1948 to earn his veterinary degree (D.V.M.) from UGA in 1952. Dr. Davison met his wife, Dianne Castle, while in vet school. She also obtained her D.V.M from UGA in 1952.

After receiving their veterinary degrees, Dianne and Fred Davison opened a veterinary practice in Fred Davison's hometown of Marietta, Georgia. In 1958, the Davisons went to Iowa State University where Fred earned his doctorate (Ph.D.) in Biochemistry and Pathology, and Dianne worked as a researcher.

He then taught veterinary science at Iowa State University while also leading a U.S. Atomic Energy Commission research project on stable rare earth compounds.

Academic and professional career
Davison worked for the American Veterinary Medical Association as the assistant director of the Scientific Activities Division for a year before being named dean of the UGA College of Veterinary Medicine in 1964. In 1966, he became vice chancellor of the University System of Georgia and the following year was named president of UGA.

Davison served as president until his resignation in 1986 following a successful lawsuit against the University by UGA English teacher Jan Kemp. Kemp claimed that University administrators fired her in retaliation for protesting preferential treatment for athletes in UGA's developmental studies program.

Following his retirement as president, Dr. Davison remained on the UGA veterinary faculty for two years. From 1988-2002, he served as president and chief executive officer of the National Science Center Foundation, Inc., in Augusta until his retirement in 2002. Dr. Davison also chaired the board of directors of Citizens for Nuclear Technology Awareness (CTNA).

Death and legacy
On April 28, 2004, Fred Davison died from esophageal cancer in Augusta, Georgia and was buried in Oconee Hill Cemetery in Athens.
