Yep Roc Records is an American independent record label based in Hillsborough, North Carolina, and owned by Redeye Distribution. Since 1997, the label has released albums from North Carolina and international artists, including Fountains of Wayne, Nick Lowe, Paul Weller, Mandolin Orange, Steep Canyon Rangers, Jim Lauderdale, Dave Alvin, Tift Merritt, Chuck Prophet, Robyn Hitchcock, Alejandro Escovedo, Aoife O'Donovan, Chatham County Line, Los Straitjackets, Amy Helm, Gang of Four, The Apples in Stereo, and Ian McLagan.

History
Tor Hansen started the label in 1997, two years after moving to North Carolina to help manage a chain of record stores in the South. He recruited his friend and former bandmate Glenn Dicker, with whom he had worked at Rounder Records. They made the decision to also start a distribution wing, Redeye.

The first releases were local compilations, followed in subsequent years by records by Hüsker Dü's Bob Mould, Marah, Dolorean, The Legendary Shack Shakers, Cities, Dave Alvin, and Los Straitjackets.

The success of Los Straitjackets and the experience of working with Dicker on the Rounder-distributed Upstart convinced Nick Lowe to join Yep Roc. Scott McCaughey (The Minus 5, Young Fresh Fellows, The Baseball Project, The No Ones) joined the label because of Nick Lowe's presence, and has remained for almost a decade.

In 2016, Dicker was elected to the American Association of Independent Music Board of Directors.

Philosophy
Yep Roc calls itself "the artist-driven label that refuses to be labeled."  Glenn Dicker said, "It’s a little challenging when we do a singer-songwriter, some blues guy, some garage-rock guy, some indie thing. It’s a little bit all over the place. It presents fun challenges, but the marketing of this brand is difficult."
