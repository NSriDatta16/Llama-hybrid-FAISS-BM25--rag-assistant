The University Athletic Association of the Philippines football championships are usually held during the second semester of the school year (December–April).

Tournament format
The tournament has three divisions: men, women and boys. As of Season 77 (2014–15), eight member universities field a team in the men's division and five in the women's division. The number of participating schools increased to eight from seven in the men's division. Adamson University fielded a men's team in Season 77 (2014–15). Adamson made its return in men's football after more than a decade of absence. While in the boys division, five member universities field a team: the Ateneo de Manila University, the De La Salle University, the Far Eastern University, the University of Santo Tomas and the National University. The number of participating schools increased to five from the four teams of Season 79. NU fielded a team starting Season 80. 

In the men's division, the top four teams by the end of the double round-robin elimination will advance to the semi-final round. The number one seeded team will face the fourth-seeded team, while the second and third seeded teams will face each other in a one-game match. The winners in the semi-final round face each other in a one-game final match. In the event that a team sweeps all the games during the eliminations, it will automatically qualify for the final. The second, third and fourth seeded teams will face each other in a step-ladder format. The winner will face the number one seeded team in the final.

In the women's and boys' divisions, the top two teams at the end of the second round will face each other in a one-game final. In the event that a team sweeps all the games during the eliminations, that team will have a twice-to-beat advantage in the final.

List of champions
Boys' football was introduced as a demonstration sport in UAAP Season 70 (2007–08) and elevated to a regular sport in UAAP Season 72 (2009–10).

Notes:
