It is an elevated station with two side platforms, located at 3410 North Lincoln Avenue (3400 N; 1700 W), in Chicago's Lakeview neighborhood, close to Roscoe Village. The stations that are adjacent to Paulina are Addison, about  to the northwest and Southport, about  to the east.

History
Paulina Station opened in 1907 as part of the Northwestern Elevated Railroad's Ravenswood branch. The station closed on September 2, 1973, but reopened on October 17 of the same year. Upon reopening, the station was only open on weekdays from 6:30 AM to 6:30 PM. On November 29, 1987, the station returned to full operational status and was open at all times the Ravenswood Line operated.

Brown Line Capacity Expansion Project

The Brown Line Capacity Expansion Project aims to allow eight car trains on the Brown Line by the extension of the platforms at all stations. This was due to the fact that there was not enough physical space in the smaller car trains for people to fit in them during the morning rush hour, causing people to wait for another train, sometimes two. At the same time all Brown Line stations are being rebuilt to be accessible to passengers with disabilities. As part of this project, Paulina station closed on March 30, 2008, for demolition and replacement with a new station. The new station opened on April 3, 2009.
