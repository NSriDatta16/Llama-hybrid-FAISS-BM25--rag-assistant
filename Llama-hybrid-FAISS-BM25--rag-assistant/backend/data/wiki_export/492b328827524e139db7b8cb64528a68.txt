Coronel (Crnl.) FAP Francisco Secada Vignetta International Airport  is an airport serving Iquitos, capital of Loreto Region and Peru's fifth largest city. It is also known as Iquitos International Airport, and is one of the main airports in Peru.

It is located 7 km (4 miles) to the southeast of the center of Iquitos. It has a single runway 2,500 m (8,202 ft) in length. It is administered by Aeropuertos del Perú, who were given the concession in 2006; and serves more than 1 million passengers per year, making it the fourth busiest airport in Peru, after those of Lima, Cusco and Arequipa. It is the only airport in Amazonia with the ISO9001 stamp. It is served by airlines such as JetSmart Perú, LATAM Perú, Sky Airline, Star Perú and SAETA Perú, receiving commercial flights daily from Lima, as well as flights to and from Pucallpa and Tarapoto. There are also various connections to smaller towns and communities in the jungle.

The airport plays a particularly important logistical and economic role because the city of Iquitos is only accessible by air or by river. Iquitos and Pucallpa are the main air hubs in the Peruvian Amazon.

History 
In 1973, Iquitos Airport changed its name in commemoration of a pilot of the Peruvian Air Force, Francisco Secada Vignetta, who was born in Iquitos and made his name in the war with Colombia that took place between 1932 and 1933.
