Poetry for the Beat Generation is the debut album of American novelist and poet Jack Kerouac and was originally released in 1959. Initial performances of these poems were poorly received by an audience at the Village Vangard in 1957. However, Kerouac was so impressed with how the poems sounded when accompanied by Steve Allen's piano that it became the first record Kerouac committed to audio.

History
