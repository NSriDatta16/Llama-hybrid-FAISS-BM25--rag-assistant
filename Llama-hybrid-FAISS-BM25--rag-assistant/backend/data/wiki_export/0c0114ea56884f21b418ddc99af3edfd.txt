The Aljunied Group Representation Constituency is a five-member group representation constituency (GRC) in the north-eastern and eastern region of Singapore. 
It consists of a large part of Hougang (excluding Hougang SMC), Paya Lebar, Serangoon Gardens, the southern half of Serangoon North as well as a portion of Bedok and a very small section of Tampines. The GRC consists of five divisions: Eunos, Bedok Reservoir-Punggol, Kaki Bukit, Serangoon and Paya Lebar. The current members of parliament are Gerald Giam, Pritam Singh,  Muhamad Faisal Manap and Sylvia Lim from the Worker's Party (WP).

History
Aljunied GRC was formed in 1988 and was won by the People's Action Party (PAP). The WP team, led by WP leader Low Thia Khiang, made a historic breakthrough when the WP team won the election for the GRC with 54.72% of the votes during the 2011 general election, making it the first GRC to be won by the opposition since the introduction of the GRC in 1988.

In the following general election in 2015, WP managed to retain the GRC with 50.96% of the votes. Between 2011 and 2020, Aljunied GRC was led by Low. 

In the 2020 general election, Low and Chen Show Mao declined to run for re-election; the 2020 election saw the WP team, led by WP leader Pritam Singh, retained the GRC with 59.95% of the vote, a 9% swing from the previous election.

In July 2023, a video surfaced that allegedly showed Leon Perera holding hands intimately with fellow WP member Nicole Seah. On 19 July, WP secretary-general Pritam Singh revealed that Leon Perera and Nicole Seah began an affair some time after the 2020 general elections, which had ended before the video surfaced. Leon Perera resigned as a Member of Parliament on 19 July 2023.

After Leon Perera resignation, the workload for the Serangoon division was distributed among the other MPs in Aljuined GRC.

Members of Parliament

Leon Perera resigned his post from the Worker's Party on 19 July 2023 due to an extramarital affair with Nicole Seah.  However, no by-election was called on the ground since it was a Group Representation Constituency and the workload for the Serangoon division was distributed among the other MPs in Aljuined GRC.
