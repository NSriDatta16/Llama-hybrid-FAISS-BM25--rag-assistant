Water Feature

Since 2021, A-Tech has had a small pond on campus that has been affectionally named "Lake A-Tech" by the students. This has given rise to a nickname of the school being "Lake-Tech" playing on A and Lake sounding similar. The pond is a result of major water leakage from the air conditioning units located between the main school building and the gymnasium. The water congregates in the dirt area between the gymnasium and the portable classrooms and often makes the entire area very muddy. The pond is home to many different types of semi-aquatic plants, which have not been identified. The pond does often cause problems for students try to enter the two southern most portables as the standing water creates large puddles at the entrances to these classrooms. The water level of the lake varies from day to day, but is usually about 1 to 2 inches deep.
