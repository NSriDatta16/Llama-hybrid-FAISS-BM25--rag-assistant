Eduard Munk (14 January 1803 – 3 May 1871) was a German philologist. He was a cousin of Salomon Munk.

Munk was born in Gross Glogau. He studied from 1822 to 1825 at Breslau and Berlin, and was a favorite disciple of August Böckh. Munk was active as teacher, officiating from 1827 to 1848 at the Royal Wilhelmsschule at Breslau, and from 1850 to 1857 intermittently at the gymnasium of Glogau, and afterward as a private tutor. In 1862 he received the title of professor.

Munk was a profound student of classical literature. Though, without any prospects of a university professorship, on account of his Jewish religion, he nevertheless devoted all his life exclusively to study, the result of which he gave to the world in numerous works.

Munk was an earnest student of Judaism and a faithful Jew.
