History

Though, people first living in the town of Çarşıbaşı are unknown, legend has it that the “Miletus” tribe were the first group of people to settle in the town of Çarşıbaşı. Miletus moved to Black Sea because of economic purposes, hoping to explore new monetary resources. The Miletus tribe, first settled in on cities on the coast such as Sinop and established colonies, and then advanced to the East of Black Sea. The Miletus then enhanced their authority in Çarşıbaşı by taking control of the surrounding regions and continued their jurisdiction for over 700 years. In the meantime, they controlled Trabzon and territories in the Black Sea by sending missionaries.

After the reign of the Miletus, the Persians ruled Çarşıbaşı and held their power until the Hellenistic period. After the rule of the Persians, the Romans took over Çarşıbaşı and ruled until year 395. During this time, the Roman Empire divided into two and Çarşıbaşı, along with Trabzon went under the control of the East Roman Empire. Latins, then took over the Romans. Then, the Romans with the help of the Bulgarians, came to Trabzon and established the Portus Roman Empire.

The rule of the Portus Roman Empire came to an end as Fatih Sultan Mehmet conquered Trabzon in 1461. Following the victory of Fatih Sultan Mehmet, Çarşıbaşı followed strict policies and became a Turkish and Muslim district, along with many other towns in the Black Sea.
