Iona College is an independent Roman Catholic single-sex day school for boys, located in the Brisbane suburb of Lindum Queensland, Australia. Iona is operated by the Oblates of Mary Immaculate, a religious order that was founded in 1816 by Saint Eugene de Mazenod.

Founded in 1958, the College caters for approximately 1,740 students from years 5 to 12 on a  campus approximately  east of the Brisbane central business district.

History
On 1 October 1957, Father Tim Long and Father Denis McCarthy arrived on the hill at Lindum in an old second-hand Vauxhall, with only five pounds in cash, a gift of blankets, sheets and towels from the Oblate parish of Eagle Junction and a 'Mass Kit' from the Mercy Sisters at All Hallows School. The site, of , had been given to the Oblates by Archbishop James Duhig to begin a school for boys. With the help of local residents providing resources to help establish the College, it commenced on 28 January 1958 with 58 students and four staff members.

Iona College's name is taken from the Scottish island of Iona, the birthplace of Celtic Christianity in Scotland.

In 1961, Father Tim Long suffered a heart attack in London while making his way back to Ireland at the age of 65.

In 2015, Michael Twigg O.M.I. was appointed rector of the College.

In 2019, the Board and Oblates appointed Trevor Goodwin as the first principal of Iona.

There are two other schools run by the OMI in Australia: Mazenod College, Victoria and Mazenod College, Western Australia.
