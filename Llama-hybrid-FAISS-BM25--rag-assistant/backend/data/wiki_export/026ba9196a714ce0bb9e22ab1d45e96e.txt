History

When the New Zealand Rugby Union (NZRU) reviewed the domestic competitions in 2005, a new 14 team premier division of competition was created, as the Air New Zealand Cup, taking the place of the National Provincial Championship (NPC).

The restructured domestic competition opened the door for the Nelson Bays and Marlborough Rugby Unions to form a relationship, forming one organisation in an attempt to be awarded a position in the new competition.

Early years: 2006 to 2010 

A Tasman 15 played Canada 'A' on April 26, 2006 at Trafalgar Park. The Tasman side won by 40 points, the final score being 48 points to 8. The Mako were grouped in Pool A of the 2006 Air New Zealand Cup.

In their first ever match in the Air New Zealand Cup, the Mako earned a bonus point in a loss to the North Harbour team, losing 33 points to 27. They were defeated by Auckland the following week by 40 points. However, the Mako won their first match in round three, defeating Manawatu by 43 points to 0.
Their only other win of the season came at home against , with an impressive 56–15 win.
Despite the season record of just 2 wins and 7 losses, the Mako showed the ability to compete and provided a platform to build for the future.
Ti'i Paulo captained the side.

The 2007 season was disappointing for the Mako, finishing the season with a record of 2 wins and 8 losses. Wins came against  and , with close losses against  and .

Early on in the 2008 season, the NZRU announced that Tasman and  would be relegated from the competition at the end of the season, due to failing to meet a set of criteria including financial stability. With the axe hovering over them, the Mako produced their best season yet, silencing their critics.

In round 2 against , Tasman first five Miah Nikora nailed a stunning last minute drop goal to snatch a 14–16 victory and claim the Mako first scalp over a major union. This was followed with wins over , ,  and a draw against  to see the Mako finish the season 7th on the ladder. Facing a strong  side in the quarter-finals, the Mako lost 48–10. However, their strong season coupled with public pressure forced the NZRU to reverse its decision and announce that Tasman and  would remain in the competition.

There were doubts as to whether Tasman would contest the 2009 Air New Zealand Cup, with funding issues and disagreement amongst its stakeholders on its future. However, these disputes were resolved and Tasman finished the 2009 season in 9th place with 6 wins and 7 losses, with their most memorable performance coming in round 9 against .

However, the Mako managed to upset eventual champions and neighbours  in round 4, with a famous 27–25 victory at Trafalgar Park.

The Tasman Mako played in the Championship for 2011. Despite taking just 2 wins and finishing in last spot for the season, the Mako were well received by their fans by playing a positive attacking brand of rugby that included 4 losses by 4 points or less. Upset victories were achieved against  21–19 in Napier, and  (again) 30–28 in Nelson. Shane Christie and James Marshall were selected for the New Zealand sevens team that year.
