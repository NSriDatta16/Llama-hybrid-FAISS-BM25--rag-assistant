Odd Thomas is a fictional character who first appeared in Dean Koontz's 2003 novel of the same name, Odd Thomas. He is a twenty-year-old man who lives in the fictional desert town of Pico Mundo, California, and is able to see the spirits of the dead. He is able to make himself heard to them but they cannot speak to him, although they may make signs or mouth words. This fact complicates much of the books.

The ghost of Elvis Presley was once a constant companion to him, until the end of Brother Odd, at which time Elvis moved on and the ghost of Frank Sinatra became Odd's new companion. Sinatra similarly left at the end of Odd Hours, shortly after an impressive display of poltergeist activity. In the fifth novel Odd Apocalypse he is visited by the ghost of Alfred Hitchcock, although he explains that he wishes to help him, but does not have enough time at the moment while trying to discover the secrets of the estate of Roseland. Mr. Hitchcock appears again in the sixth novel, Deeply Odd.

Fictional character biography
Odd was told his name was originally intended to be "Todd", (or possibly "Dobb", after his uncle whom he has never met and may not exist) and his actual name stems from this error on his birth certificate. Odd lived at home with his mother until he was 16. His mother is a psychotic who refuses medical treatment. The mere thought of responsibility, love, or any adult emotions drives her into suicidal rage. Odd's father, another emotional cripple, divorced her when Odd was one year old. He never remarried but has become a serial philanderer with women that are barely/questionably legal. Odd was severely neglected and emotionally abused by his mother after his father left. If his mother couldn't hide from him, she would threaten to kill herself or Odd if he created "stressful" events.  For example, when he was very sick as a child and wanted her to comfort him, she told him if he didn't stop crying she was going to shoot herself. During this same incident she also made him (Odd) look into the barrel of her loaded handgun and "look for the bright point of the bullet".

Odd's unique ability to see the dead (among other paranormal gifts) complicates his life and forms the basis of the novels. When the first novel begins he is a 20-year-old fry cook, with a particular proficiency for pancakes, living in the fictional California town of Pico Mundo. He uses his abilities to aid the lingering spirits who seek him out. The plot of the first novel centers on Odd and his girlfriend Stormy Llewellyn's attempt to prevent a mass murder in his hometown. Odd successfully minimizes the casualties of the scheme but Stormy is killed, changing the course of Odd's life.

The second novel, Forever Odd focuses on a battle of wits between Odd and an occult-obsessed seductress who has kidnapped Odd's childhood friend, hoping to attract Odd and steal his gift. In Brother Odd, Odd has retreated to a quiet life in St. Bartholomew's Abbey, where children are being stalked by paranormal creatures outside of Odd's experience. In the fourth novel, Odd Hours, Odd is drawn to Magic Beach where he experiences an apocalyptic dream and investigates a plot of cataclysmic proportions. During this novel he meets Annamaria, a mysterious woman who dubs Odd during their first conversation as her protector. At the end of the novel Annamaria accompanies Odd as the two depart Magic Beach, and Annamaria comforts Odd by mimicking a favorite pastime of Odd's and Stormy's. In the fifth book, Odd Apocalypse, Odd and Annamaria stay as guests at Roseland Manor where everything is not as it seems.

Odd's primary power is the ability to see ghosts and other departed spirits, primarily humans and dogs, though Odd has made allusions to others. The spirits never speak, though Odd does not know if this is due to inability or by choice until Odd Hours, when the spirit of a recently killed criminal attempts to speak to Odd and is surprised to find that it cannot be heard. Odd's second ability is a form of psychic magnetism, an ability to be drawn to places or people of import by allowing his instincts to take over. Another, less beneficial aspect of this ability is that if Odd is consciously trying avoid a particular someone or something, he will inevitably find or be found by that very person or thing. Despite the danger and misfortune this ability causes, Odd usually finds humor in the irony and speaks of it in an anecdotal fashion.

Additionally, Odd is able to foresee events due to his ability to see Bodachs, a term identified by a child he met who shortly after voicing the word, and in the presence of Bodachs, was killed in a somewhat mysterious accident by a truck driver.
