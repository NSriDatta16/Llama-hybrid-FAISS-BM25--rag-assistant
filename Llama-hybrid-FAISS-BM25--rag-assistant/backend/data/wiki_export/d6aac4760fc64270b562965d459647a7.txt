Forreston is a locality near Adelaide, South Australia. It is located in the Adelaide Hills Council local government area 3 km northeast of Gumeracha.

History
The town was named in honour of its founder, Alexander Forrest (not to be confused with the Western Australian explorer and surveyor of the same name).

Forreston is curious in that, being only 3 km from Gumeracha, it did so well. Alexander Forrest, a blacksmith by trade, arrived in South Australia in 1848, settling in the Forreston area in 1850 and laying out the village in 1858. The Gumeracha North School opened in 1860 and closed in 1967. At one stage, it had a post office, store, wine shop, wheelwright, blacksmith, butcher, school and more. In 1884, gold was found at nearby Watts Gully in 1884, yielding nuggets as large as 14 ounces, and the town peaked. However, the town is no more, with only reminders in its historical buildings, including Forrest's original home, of its vibrant commercial past.

The region relies heavily on grazing, dairying and market gardening.
