Synopsis
It is 10 years from when last we learned of Joe's life in Room At The Top. He now has everything he thought he wanted â€“ the upper-class wife, an executive job, two cars and two children for his new house. Yet, Joe is still a dissatisfied man; his job had not moved significantly forward in the last 10 years. This dissatisfaction leads him back to his old philandering ways, spurred by the knowledge of his wife's own infidelity. Joe and Susan separate temporarily, but toward the novel's close, Joe is drawn back to his life in Warley in response to trouble with his children and his knowledge of what his life needs.
