History

Bronze Age
A 4,000-year-old cemetery and many Canaanite artifacts were discovered in an archeological dig at the edge of Bayit Vagan.  The cemetery covers an area of more than half an acre (0.2 hectare), and burials are believed to have taken place there mainly in the Bronze Age, in 2200-2000 BCE and 1700-1600 BCE. Excavations began in 1995 but the most interesting finds were discovered in 2005.

Crusader period
The Orthodox monastery of Mar Saba owned a farmstead in this area in the 12th century, during the existence of the Catholic Kingdom of Jerusalem established by Crusaders.

British Mandate period
During the British Mandate, the army built one of its radar stations in Bayit Vagan. A synagogue, Beit Knesset Migdal ("The Tower"), now stands on the spot.

Bayit Vagan was the third neighborhood built in West Jerusalem in modern times.

State of Israel
A scale-model of the Second Temple designed by Prof. Michael Avi-Yonah based on the writings of the Roman Jewish historian Josephus, was located for many years on the grounds of the Holyland Hotel in Bayit Vagan. In 2007, it was moved to the Israel Museum.
