Newsome is a village situated approximately 1 mile south of Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, England. It is in the Metropolitan Borough of Kirklees. The village lies at the centre of Newsome Ward  to which it gives its name.

Geography
Newsome stands on a shoulder of land below Castle Hill and above the valley where the River Holme meets the River Colne. The village lies between Berry Brow, Hall Bower and Taylor Hill.

Facilities
The village has both housing and industrial units, the latter mostly within the site of the former Newsome Mill, which used to produce woollen textiles.

Newsome used to have a large bakehouse, (which made award-winning pork pies), but these industrial units, (across from, now damaged, Newsome Mill), now hold businesses. The Huddersfield Examiner announced in February 2013 the closure to the Huddersfield shops, as well as the bakehouse.

Schools
There is a secondary school, Newsome Academy to the south west of the village centre. The school's assistant head teacher was named West Yorkshire Teacher of the Year 2006 for an award sponsored by Pulse Radio. The Victorian infant and nursery school 'Stile Common Infant and Nursery School', close to the village centre, was closed down and replaced by newly built Hillside Primary School. A specialist school, Castle Hill school, for children aged 3â€“19, with Severe Learning Difficulties and Profound and Multiple Learning Disabilities, is located to the south west of the village, by Berry Brow, to support children from within the Huddersfield catchment area. The Huddersfield Examiner announced on 11 July 2009 that the specialist school in Newsome had one confirmed case of swine flu.
