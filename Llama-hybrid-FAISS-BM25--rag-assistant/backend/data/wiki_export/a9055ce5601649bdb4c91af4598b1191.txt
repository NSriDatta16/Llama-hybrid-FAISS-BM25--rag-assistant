History 
Initial plans for an airfield in Fergus Falls began in 1927. In 1928, a tract of land west of the city of Fergus Falls was leased for use as a municipal airport.  When the farmer who owned that land decided to grow wheat there in 1934, the city was forced to relocate the airport.

After World War II, plans were developed for construction of a new airport dedicated in honor of Flying Tiger Einar Mickelson and, "all the other Fergus Falls airmen who lost their lives in the Second World War."  The airport and airfield were formally dedicated on September 19, 1948. The first airliner landed there in 1953. It was a DC-3 from North Central Airlines.

A new 4,800 foot runway was added in 1980. A new arrival-departure building at the airport opened up in 1983.
