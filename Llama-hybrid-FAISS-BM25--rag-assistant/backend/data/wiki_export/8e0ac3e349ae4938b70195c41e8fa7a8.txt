The National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame, located in Kansas City, Missouri, is a hall of fame and museum dedicated to men's college basketball.   The museum is an integral portion of the College Basketball Experience created by the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC), located at the T-Mobile Center. The hall is meant as a complement to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, with a focus strictly on those who have contributed greatly to college basketball.

On November 17, 2006, the NABC honored around 180 players, coaches and other notable contributors to college basketball by inducting them into the founding class of the Hall of Fame.  Oscar Robertson, Bill Russell, Dean Smith, John Wooden, and the family of James Naismith, were selected to represent the inaugural class.

The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts has indicated it will help with the exhibits.  The other interactive portions of the College Basketball Experience are called 'The Entry Experience,' 'The Fan Experience,' and 'The Game.' The NABC recently renamed the Guardians Classic college tournament the CBE Classic to help promote it.
