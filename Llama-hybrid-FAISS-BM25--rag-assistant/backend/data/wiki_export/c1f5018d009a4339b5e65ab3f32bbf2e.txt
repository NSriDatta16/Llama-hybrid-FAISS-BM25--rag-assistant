Voll-Damm Doble Malta is a lager and Märzen or Märzenbier-style beer manufactured by S.A. Damm, a brewery in Barcelona, Spain. This robust, full-bodied beer emulates a German-style "Vollbier" and contains 7.2% alcohol by volume. Its dark-green colored labels display writing in the Gothic script.

The name of this Pale Lager comes from the word “voll”, which means full or complete in German, referring to the intense body and flavour of a beer with an original wort extract of 17%.
