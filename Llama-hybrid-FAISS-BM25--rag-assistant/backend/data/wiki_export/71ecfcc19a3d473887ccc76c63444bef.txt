"Brothers in Arms" is a song by British rock band Dire Straits, the closing track on their fifth studio album of the same name, released on 18 October 1985. It was written in 1982, the year of Britain's involvement in the Falklands War.

In 2007, the 25th anniversary of the war, Mark Knopfler recorded a new version of the song at Abbey Road Studios to raise funds for British veterans who he said "are still suffering from the effects of that conflict." "Brothers in Arms" has become a favourite at military funerals.

Background
This song was written during the Falklands War and is described by some as an anti-war song.

History
"Brothers in Arms" was first released as a single on 14 October 1985. The song is reported to be the first CD single ever released; it was released in the United Kingdom in 1986.

The song's lyrics, influence, and impact were discussed from a variety of musical and personal perspectives in the BBC radio programme and podcast Soul Music first broadcast in September 2012.

Reception
Classic Rock critic Paul Rees rated "Brothers in Arms" to be Dire Straits' 5th greatest song, citing its "dignified but lasting power" and a "stunning guitar solo."

Spin noted the, "political theme with outstanding craftsmanship in the words and music. The singing is quiet but authoritative, and Knopfler's Strat cuts a dark swath across the battle-scarred landscape conjured up by the lyrics."

Music video

The music video, directed and animated by Bill Mather, produced by Simon Fields through Limelight Films and cinematographed by Francis Kenny, uses rotoscoping and shows the band performing, overlaid with images of the First World War. In contrast with the at-that-time very modern clip in "Money for Nothing", the video clip has a very classic appearance in noisy black and white images.

"Brothers in Arms" won Grammy Award for Best Music Video at the 29th Annual Grammy Awards on 24 February 1987.

Use as soundtrack for films and TV series

The song appeared in several television programmes including the second season finale of The West Wing: "Two Cathedrals".
