Jaime is a common Spanish and Portuguese male given name for Jacob (name), James (name), Jamie, or Jacques. In Occitania Jacobus became Jacome and later Jacme. In east Spain, Jacme became Jaime, in Aragon it became Chaime, and in Catalonia it became Jaume. In western Spain Jacobus became Iago; in Portugal it became Tiago. The name Saint James developed in Spanish to Santiago, in Portuguese to São Tiago. The names Diego (Spanish) and Diogo (Portuguese) are also Iberian versions of Jaime.

In the United States, Jaime is used as an independent masculine given name, along with given name James.

For females, it remains less popular, not appearing on the top 1,000 U.S. female names for the past 5 years.

Characters 
 Jaime Lannister, known as "Kingslayer", a fictional character in the fantasy epic novel series A Song of Ice and Fire and its derived works such as TV series Game of Thrones. However, this is likely not derived from the Spanish name "Jaime" but is instead a corrupted spelling of "Jamie", which is how the name in the series is pronounced. It is common in the book series for characters' names to be slight misspellings of real-life English names.

 Jaime Rosales, a character in Cassandra Clare's Lady Midnight
