"(We Want) The Same Thing" is a song by American singer Belinda Carlisle. Written by Rick Nowels and Ellen Shipley, it was produced by Nowels for Carlisle's third album, Runaway Horses (1989). In Japan, it was released simultaneously with "Leave a Light On" as the album's lead single on October 21, 1989, while in the United Kingdom, it was issued as the album's fifth single in October 1990. To help promote the single in the UK, Virgin Records released a deluxe 12-inch vinyl box set with free stickers and a picture disc single on CD, in addition to standard formats. The single peaked at number six on the UK Singles Chart and spent 10 weeks in the top 75.

Single remix
The single version of "(We Want) The Same Thing" is different than the original version found on Runaway Horses. The intro of the single version includes chants of 'Hey!' repeated four times before a drum piece introduces the song. In the Runaway Horses album booklet, the lyrics listed for "(We Want) The Same Thing" vary from the actual version on the album but match the lyrics for the single version.
