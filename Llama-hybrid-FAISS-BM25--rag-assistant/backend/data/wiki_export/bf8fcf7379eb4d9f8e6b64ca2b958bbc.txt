Concord-Padgett Regional Airport  is a city-owned, public-use airport located seven nautical miles (13 km) west of the central business district of Concord, a city in Cabarrus County, North Carolina, United States.  According to the FAA's National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2009–2013, it is classified as a reliever airport for Charlotte Douglas International Airport.

Although many U.S. airports use the same three-letter location identifier for the FAA and IATA, this airport is assigned JQF by the FAA but had no designation from the IATA until August 22, 2013 when it was assigned the IATA code USA.

Because of the multiple race teams that base aircraft fleets at JQF and its proximity to Charlotte Motor Speedway, the airport is sometimes referred to as "NASCAR's Airport."

In April 2018, the airport was renamed to honor longtime Mayor of Concord Scott Padgett. An official ceremony was held on November 18, 2019, for the airport's 25th anniversary.

NASCAR
Since the airport's expansion of its runway to accommodate mid-size commercial aircraft in the early 2000s, the airport has been quite popular among local NASCAR teams. Teams charter flights out of Concord-Padgett instead of Charlotte Douglas because of its affordability and proximity to their headquarters.

Commercial passenger service
On August 20, 2013, Allegiant Air announced it would begin nonstop jet service between Concord and Orlando Sanford International Airport in December 2013. Since then the airline has expanded its nonstop service to several other vacation destinations in Florida as well as announcing new nonstop service to New Orleans. An existing hangar to the left of the main terminal was converted to a separate temporary terminal for this new commercial service. A larger permanent commercial service terminal opened in October 2016.  According to FlightAware, Allegiant serves the airport with Airbus A320 jetliners. On March 4, 2020, Allegiant announced Concord would be the airline's 21st operating base, housing two Airbus planes beginning October 7, 2020.
