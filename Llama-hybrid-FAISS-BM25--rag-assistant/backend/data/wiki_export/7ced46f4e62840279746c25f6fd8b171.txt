It therefore contains four versions sung in Spanish of the following songs Little Wing by Jimi Hendrix titled here Mariposa Libre, We'll Be Together whose title becomes Si estamos juntos, They Dance Alone translates to Ellas danzan solas (Cueca solas) and finally Fragile retitled Fragilidad, this same song performed also in Portuguese becomes Frágil. The same musicians as on the original English versions can be found on this EP.
