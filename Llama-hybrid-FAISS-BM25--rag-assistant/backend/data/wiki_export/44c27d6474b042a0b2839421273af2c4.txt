History
Elgin Academy is the biggest school in Moray, with a history going back to the Middle Ages. The first school was built on the adjacent corners of Academy Street and Francis Place, now the site of the local youth cafe. The second academy was built in 1801, on the site that is now Moray College.

The third Elgin Academy building, on Morriston Road, was built in the late 1960s and opened in 1969.

In 2006 plans to merge the academy with Elgin High School were rejected after a public consultation. Instead a new £30million building was constructed under private finance initiative, and opened in 2012.
