The Cars of the Stars Motor Museum was in the English town of Keswick, Cumbria, and owned a collection of celebrity television and film vehicles. The museum opened in  and closed in . The sister site The Bond Museum  in Keswick, with its over 30 original screen cars from the James Bond films, also closed at the same time.

Nearly all of the vehicles were sold to the American collector Michael Dezer. He relocated the collection to America, where he used it to establish a permanent Cars of the Stars exhibition at his Miami Auto Museum.

History 
In 1982 the museum's founder, Peter Nelson, was approached for use of his MG TC in "The Spoils of War" television production. As a result, he formulated the idea of starting a motor museum with a focus on television and film-based vehicles. The Royal Oak Garage in central Keswick was purchased and refurbished to house the collection.

The museum opened to the public on 1 May 1989 and closed in May 2011. The museum's collection was relocated to the United States.
