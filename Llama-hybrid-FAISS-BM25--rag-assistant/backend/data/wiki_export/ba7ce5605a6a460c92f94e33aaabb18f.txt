Angelos Epithemiou
Skinner appeared as Angelos Epithemiou on series 6 of Shooting Stars as a permanent member of Team B, replacing Johnny Vegas. In series 7 and 8, he replaced George Dawes as the score keeper. The character's signature tune is "Drop the Pressure (Jack Beats 'Rinsed Out Rave' Remix)" by Project Bassline. He is (apparently) of Greek origin and resides in Neasden.

Epithemiou is on the dole. He was originally introduced by Bob Mortimer as a competition winner, as well as a burger van owner from 'somewhere in the North East', although this aspect of his character was gradually sidelined. As the character developed, Epithemiou showed an ongoing obsession with Ulrika Jonsson, and revealed that his burger van had been destroyed by his brother Agathius. He also appeared in a series of YouTube clips alongside David Earl whose character Brian Gittins employed him at his cafe, and who was increasingly envious of the fame Epithemiou was gaining on Shooting Stars.

Skinner appeared on BBC Three show World Cup 2010's Most Shocking Moments with other celebrities, reviewing and making jokes about incidents in the 2010 FIFA World Cup. This was one of the first appearances on TV since performing as the character Epithemiou on Shooting Stars.

In 2010, Skinner took the Epithemiou character on a UK tour titled Angelos Epithemiou & Friends Christmas Show; due to popular demand, venues introduced additional dates throughout December 2010.

In August 2011, Skinner appeared as Epithemiou in BBC Radio 1's Fun & Filth Cabaret, part of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. He ended each of the shows with a HARDtalk-style interview.

In December 2011, Skinner won the Best Comedy Breakthrough Artist at The British Comedy Awards for his work as Epithemiou over the previous year. In the same month, he appeared as Epithemiou on the Christmas special of The Rob Brydon Show.

In 2012, he starred in his own show, The Angelos Epithemiou Show, on Channel 4. He also appeared as John Meringue in the Reeves and Mortimer quiz show Vic & Bob's Lucky Sexy Winners.

Epithemiou took part in Channel 4's Come Dine with Me on 4 January 2013. He served tinned mushroom soup with white sliced bread for the starter and employed a burger van to cook his main dish. The only dish he cooked was a swiss roll for dessert: however his guests were told to go home halfway through their desserts and had to finish their food in their taxis on the way home. 

Epithemiou appeared alongside Debbie McGee on Pointless Celebrities in December 2018, raising money for motor neurone disease.

On 1 December 2019, Epithemiou appeared on Channel 4's Sunday Brunch but only for the start of the show when guests are introduced followed by the first cooking item which he interrupted part-way through by walking into shot to announce that he was leaving.

Angelos Epithemiou’s character and its place in English comedy history is analysed in Guy Mankowski's book Albion's Secret History: Snapshots of England's Pop Rebels and Outsiders.
