Shin-Lamedh-Mem is a triconsonantal root of many Semitic words (many of which are used as names). The root meaning translates to "whole, safe, intact, unharmed, to go free, without blemish". Its earliest known form is in the name of Shalim, the ancient god of dusk of Ugarit. Derived from this are meanings of "to be safe, secure, at peace", hence "well-being, health"  and passively "to be secured, pacified, submitted".

Šalām (shalamu) is also used in letter introductions to express the authors' health. An example letter EA19, from Tushratta to Pharaoh, states:

Arabic Islām

The word   is a verbal noun derived from s-l-m, meaning "submission" (i.e. entrusting one's wholeness to a higher force), which may be interpreted as humility.  "One who submits" is signified by the participle ,  (fem. , ).

The word is given a number of meanings in the Qur'an. In some verses (), the quality of Islam as an internal conviction is stressed: "Whomsoever God desires to guide, He expands his breast to Islam." Other verses connect islām and dīn (usually translated as "religion"): "Today, I have perfected your religion () for you; I have completed My blessing upon you; I have approved Islam for your religion." Still others describe Islam as an action of returning to God—more than just a verbal affirmation of faith.

Northwest Semitic

The Koine Greek New Testament text uses eirēnē () for 'peace', which perhaps represents Jesus saying šlama; this Greek form became the northern feminine name Irene. In the Epistles, it often occurs alongside the usual Greek greeting chairein () in the phrase 'grace and peace'. However, comparison of the Greek Septuagint and Hebrew Masoretic Old Testament texts shows some instances where shalom was translated instead as soteria (, meaning 'salvation').

In Hebrew:

 Shalom
 Mushlam () – perfect
 Shalem () – whole, complete
 Lehashlim () – to complete, fill in
 Leshallem () – to pay
 Tashlum () – payment
 Shillumim () – reparations
 Lehishtallem () – to be worth it, to "pay"
 Absalom () – a personal name, literally means 'Father [of] Peace'.

In Aramaic:
 Shlama – 'peace'
 Shalmuta
