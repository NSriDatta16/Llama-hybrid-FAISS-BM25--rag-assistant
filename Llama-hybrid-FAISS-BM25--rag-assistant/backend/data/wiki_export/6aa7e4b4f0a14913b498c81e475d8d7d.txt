Karl Kennedy is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera Neighbours, played by Alan Fletcher. The actor previously appeared in the soap in 1987 as mechanic Greg Cooper. He made his first screen appearance as Karl during the episode broadcast on 20 September 1994. Karl and his family were created by Neighbours storyliners in an attempt to bring the show back to its roots. Karl was given the job of local GP to provide him with immediate links to other characters. Debuting shortly before his wife, Susan Kennedy, he is the longest running continuously appearing character in the series' history.

Creation and casting
In 1994, the Neighbours''' storyliners decided to introduce the "solid" Kennedy family. They felt that they needed to take the show back to its roots when it seemed that all the houses on Ramsay Street were populated with misfits and distant relatives. Susan (Jackie Woodburne) was given the job of teacher at the local school and Karl was made the local GP, giving the family immediate links with other characters.

Fletcher had previously starred in Neighbours as Greg Cooper for a three-week guest role in 1987. When the character of Karl Kennedy came up, Fletcher auditioned for the role in the same way as he had for the role of Greg. He was subsequently cast in the show again seven years after his first appearance. Fletcher admitted that when he joined the show again he thought he would be there for a year.

In 2009, Fletcher celebrated the 15th anniversary of his character's arrival on Ramsay Street. In 2014, Fletcher celebrated 20 years on the show. He commented "I am planning to hang around for quite a while longer because I do love it too much, we're talking at the moment about a continuation."

Development
Marriage to Susan Kennedy
Susan and Karl were childhood sweethearts who married in 1978, before they both graduated from university. Karl has cheated on Susan and the couple have broken up and divorced, but they later reunited and have remarried. Karl and Susan are best friends who enjoy each other's company, share a deep connection and take joy in each other's quirks and ways. Woodburne described them as having a "really solid foundation for a marriage" and she has said that she does not want to see Susan and Karl's relationship break up again.

A writer for Holy Soap has called Susan and Karl "contenders for the friskiest couple on Ramsay Street". Following their "passionate arguments", the couple enjoy making up together as they have a healthy attraction for each other. Fletcher says he and Woodburne find the scenes "funny". Fletcher said "Karl and Susan every now and again do go through a phase where they become slightly more amorous than in their tougher times and tougher storylines – suffice to say it's not bawdy, but I think the audience will enjoy the fun aspect". Karl and Susan have been caught in the nude together on three occasions; at the beach, in Lou Carpenter's (Tom Oliver) spa and when they went skinny-dipping in the bush.

Character reflection
Upon the news that Neighbours would be concluding on 28 July 2022, Fletcher said that the finale would be a "huge celebration of the show, but a celebration that goes back 37 years. It'll be quite memorable." He described Channel 5's decision to cancel the show a "harsh reality", but understood why the decision had been made. When asked of his favourite storyline, Fletcher said, "Well, it's hard to get past the Izzy/Karl/Susan triangle, because unlike the Sarah affair, which was very much an affair, the Izzy storyline was a lot more complex. Karl left Susan mentally for Izzy, before he left her physically. Izzy actually had no interest in Karl. It was only when Izzy found out she was pregnant with another man's child, and that man had died in the Lassiters fire, that she said: 'I'll take you Karl, so you can be the father to my child'. Of course, she faked the date of her pregnancy at the hospital. It was an incredible story. Susan's reaction to Karl having a baby with another woman was spectacular. She really gave it to me in the street. It had many twists and turns and finished beautifully."

Fletcher also stated that he enjoyed comedic storylines, especially the serial's 7000th episode, where Karl shares a nude lunch. Fletcher explained that his least favourite storyline as Karl was when "he got himself a job as a pharmaceutical rep. He discovered that the company that he was working for were selling expired medicines in third world countries", and he thought the storyline unrealistic for Neighbours. Fletcher added that he and Woodburne were "very excited" for Izzy and Malcolm's returns in the final episodes. Upon the idea of Karl and Susan leaving the street at the end of the serial, Fletcher responded, "For me to fulfil my fantasy that Karl and Susan go on holiday on the last episode and turn up over the next year in every UK soap as tourists – for that to happen, I guess we'd have to leave!"

In 2007, Australian newspaper the Herald Sun placed Karl's affair with Sarah at number eight on their list of Neighbours Top Ten moments. They said "In one of the most shocking storylines, no one could believe that the perfect Dr Karl, played by Alan Fletcher, could cheat on his wife of many years, Susan, played by Jackie Woodburne.

In 2009, Karl came tenth in a poll by British men's magazine Loaded for "Top Soap Bloke". The following year, he was voted the third "Most Popular Doctor".

In a feature profiling the "top 12 iconic Neighbours characters", critic Sheena McGinley of the Irish Independent placed Karl as her eighth choice. She stated that Karl has "pinballed from upstanding pillar of the community to alcohol dependent, to veg patch enthusiast, and back to being a conscientious doctor." Lorna White from Yours profiled the magazine's "favourite Neighbours characters of all time". Karl was included in the list and was hailed a "Neighbours icon". Sam Strutt  of The Guardian compiled a feature counting down the top ten most memorable moments from Neighbours. Strutt listed Karl and Izzy's affair in sixth place and scathed "Dr Karl just couldn’t keep it in his pants." He concluded that the countless stories the affair birthed was "classic soap fodder".

In 2010, to celebrate Neighbours' 25th anniversary Sky, a British satellite broadcasting company profiled 25 characters of which they believed were the most memorable in the series history. Karl is in the list and describing him they state: "Karl and Susan became a truly legendary soap couple in an age when they have become thin on the ground. On paper, it's not quite clear why – they're just a pleasant, middle-class couple, and Karl can be a bit moany sometimes. But the important thing is it works, and watching the writers break them up and put them back together several times has made for great telly. And you know it's only a matter of time before Karl adds another unexpectedly sexy neighbour to his cheatin' list..." Nicky Branagh from Studentbeans.com included Karl in her list of the "Top ten hottest Aussie soap guys" and she stated "It's not worth thinking about a Ramsay Street without Dr Karl Kennedy in it. Now in his 18th year in the role, Alan Fletcher has charmed Neighbours viewers with his medical skills, smooth moves and his tendency to parent anyone who walks through the Kennedy door. Now a smooth crooner and frequenter of student nights in the UK to boot, Fletch has made it to the top of our ultimate Aussie soap heart-throbs list."

Michael Cregan for Inside Soap enjoyed the pottery pig storyline, saying "Never let it be said that life is dull on Ramsay Street. Now that Karl Kennedy has got a massive pottery pig called Elvis, what could possibly go wrong? Apart from a few filthy looks from Susan of course..." Ben Pobjie of The Sydney Morning Herald thought Karl's "peculiar childlike enthusiasm that makes him such great comic relief" was "his most endearing feature apart from his tendency to periodically have affairs with younger women."
