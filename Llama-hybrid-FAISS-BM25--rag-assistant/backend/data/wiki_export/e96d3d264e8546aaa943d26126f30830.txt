, also known as , are a Japanese rock band from Onomichi (formerly Innoshima), Hiroshima Prefecture. The band got their name from the album Pornograffitti by the band Extreme. They currently record under the SME Records label and their agency is Amuse, Inc.

Haruichi Shindō originally formed the band with his cousin during high school and named it "No Score." After the band started, Haruichi asked Akihito Okano and Tama to join. The band was so named because none of them could actually read a score when they first started. When they first started the band Haruichi was the vocalist, but he found out that Akihito could sing better and gave the vocalist position to Akihito, taking over as guitarist instead. This was the foundation of Porno Graffitti. They debuted with the song Apollo in 1999. Their two subsequent CD singles, Saudade and Agehachō, both sold over a million copies in Japan.

The band is well known for their work in creating music for anime series and movies. They are particularly well known for the song "Melissa," which was used as the opening theme of the anime series Fullmetal Alchemist in 2003. In addition, they have created the songs "Hitori no Yoru" for the second opening theme of the anime series GTO (2000), "Winding Road" for the ending theme of the anime series Ayakashi Ayashi (2006), "The Day" for the first opening theme of the anime series My Hero Academia (2015), "Montage" for an opening theme of the anime Puzzle & Dragons X and most recently "Hikari Are", the first opening theme of The Seven Deadly Sins: Dragon's Judgement, the final season of The Seven Deadly Sins (manga).

Their song "Koyoi, Tsuki ga, Miezu Tomo" was featured in the third Bleach film, and their single "Anima Rossa" was featured as the eleventh opening to Bleach. Their single "2012Spark" was featured as the main theme song of the movie Gyakuten Saiban and their single "Matataku Hoshi no Shita de" was the second opening theme for the anime Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic. Their single "Oh! Rival" is part of the soundtrack for the 2019 Detective Conan film.

They are also featured in video game music, with a cover of their 2000 single "Music Hour" used for a stage of the Nintendo DS rhythm game Moero! Nekketsu Rhythm Damashii Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan 2.
