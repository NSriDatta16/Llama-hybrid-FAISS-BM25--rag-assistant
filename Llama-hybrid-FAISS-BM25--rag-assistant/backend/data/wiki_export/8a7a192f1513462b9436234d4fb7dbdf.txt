Mokjong of Goryeo (5 July 980 – 2 March 1009) (r. 997–1009) was the seventh ruler of the Goryeo dynasty of Korea.

Reign 
Born as Wang Song, Mokjong was the only son of King Gyeongjong; however, when his father died, he was too young to become king, so it was his uncle, prince Gaeryeong Wang Chi, who succeeded to the throne as King Seongjong. Mokjong eventually became king after his uncle's death in 997 and chose his mother, Queen Honae, as regent.

Mokjong is known for his reform of the Jeonsigwa (land-allotment system), and for a plot by his mother, Queen Honae and Kim Chi-yang to overthrow him. In the course of the turbulent events surrounding the plot, Mokjong was dethroned by general Gang Jo and sent into exile in Chungju. However, he was slain before he arrived there.

Mokjong's tomb was known as Gongneung, but its present location is not known.
