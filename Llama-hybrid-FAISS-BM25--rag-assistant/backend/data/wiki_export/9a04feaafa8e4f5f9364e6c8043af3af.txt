A sponge grenade is a riot control weapon, intended to be non-lethal, which is fired from a 40Â mm grenade launcher to cause confusion, or otherwise temporarily disable its target. As a single blunt force object, it is best used when aimed at a particular individual.

The projectile weighs about . It is bullet-shaped, with a foam rubber nose and a high-density, plastic projectile body.

Potential for injury or death
Proper use of the weapons involves firing it from a medium distance, and aiming for the legs or lower torso. Firing it too close, or firing it too far away which decreases the ability to accurately aim for the legs or lower torso, can cause serious injury.

Improper use of sponge grenades can cause broken bones, head wounds, or permanent damage to eyes. Sponge grenades impacting the upper body or head might have killed targeted individuals.
