After a successful period at Barnsley, he entered the Premier League when he moved to Wolverhampton Wanderers in 2011, with whom he remained until 2013.

In 2015, Hammill returned to Barnsley on a short-term contract but remained until 2018.

Club career

Liverpool
Hammill was born in Liverpool and was a member of the Youth Academy at Liverpool since he joined the club at age nine. After appearing for the youth and reserves teams, he was promoted to Melwood on a full-time basis. He was part of the Liverpool team that defeated Manchester City in the 2006 FA Youth Cup final. While at the academy, Hammill initially played as an attacking midfielder and striker. But he turned "around 14 or 15", Hammill converted to a winger after being convinced by Academy Manager Steve Heighway, a position both he and Heighway, himself, played today.

In January 2007, he got his first taste of senior football when he was loaned to Scottish side Dunfermline Athletic until the end of the season. He played eighteen games for Dunfermline, including the Scottish Cup final, and scored once against Celtic. After his loan spell at Dunfermline Athletic came to an end, Hammill stated playing in Scotland benefited him, due to playing in the final and more first team opportunity.

He spent the 2007–08 season on loan at Championship side Southampton. Hammill hoped joining Southampton could benefit him for first team experience, as well as making a breakthrough. While in his first two months at Southampton, Hammill signed a three-year contract with his parent club, Liverpool, keeping him until 2011. Hammill made his Southampton debut, where he came on as a substitute for Jhon Viáfara, in the 63rd minute, in a 4–1 loss against Crystal Palace. By November, Hammill made two starts and came on from the substitute bench six times, and as a result he was sent to the reserves or remained on the substitute bench. Having regained his first team place, Hammill then provided two assists for the club, as Southampton beat Hull City 4– 0 on 8 December 2007. Throughout the season, Hammill remained in the first team spotlight at Southampton, as he made 28 appearances in total.

Returning to Anfield, he signed a new five-year contract with Liverpool in July 2008, before being sent out on loan for a sixth time; joining Blackpool in a six-month deal. He made his debut for the Seasiders on 9 August 2008, where he played 90 minutes in a 1–0 home defeat to Bristol City. In the next game against Norwich City on 16 August 2008, Hammill won a penalty in the 55th minute, which Ben Burgess successfully converted, in a 1–1 draw. He scored his first goal in English football for the Seasiders on 16 November in the West Lancashire derby 3–1 home defeat to Preston. After a successful loan spell he returned to Liverpool on 30 December, where Rafael Benítez would decide whether or not Hammill would return to Bloomfield Road despite keen on using him in the Liverpool first team.

Barnsley

He did have a second loan deal during the 2008–09 season, but it was instead with Barnsley, whom he joined in February 2009 for the remainder of the campaign. Hammill made his Barnsley debut in his first spell on 17 February 2009, where he came on as a substitute for Andranik Teymourian in the 80th minute, in a 1–0 win over Sheffield Wednesday. Having become a first team regular throughout the season, Hammill scored his first Barnsley goal whilst on loan, in the last game of the season, in a 2–1 win over Plymouth Argyle. After the match, Hammill returned to his parent club.

Following his loan spell at Oakwell in Spring 2009, Barnsley launched a bid which was turned down as Liverpool wanted to see what Hammill could offer during pre-season. However, Hammill remained out of the Liverpool first team after yet being given a squad number despite playing in a friendly match, which he scored. Barnsley then made a second bid, which Liverpool, this time, accepted and Hammill signed a three-year contract on 10 August 2009. Though he has no regrets leaving Liverpool for Barnsley, Hammill, however, said Liverpool will forever be in his blood.

Hammill's first game after signing for the club on a permanent basis came on 11 August 2009 in a League Cup first round tie, with a 1–0 win at Lincoln City. He scored his first goal of the 2009 season for Barnsley, away at Derby County, as the Reds recorded their first win of the season under new manager Mark Robins. Hammill's goal was a curling effort from the edge of the box that won him the club's Goal of the Year Award for 2009. Two weeks later on 29 September 2009, Hammill scored his second Barnsley goal, in a 3–1 win over West Brom Albion, followed up by the third and fourth goal against Doncaster Rovers on 17 October 2009 and Bristol City on 24 October 2009 Four days later on 28 October 2009, Hammill was fouled by Manchester United's Gary Neville, which saw him sent-off, as Barnsley lose 2–0 in the last-16 of League Cup. Throughout the 2009–10 season, Hammill remained in the first team, which he made forty–three appearances and scoring four times in all competitions.

At the start of the 2010–11 season, Hammill started the season well he scored four goals in the first nine matches against Bristol City, Middlesbrough, Leeds United (which he also has a hat-trick assist during the match) and Derby County. Hammill then provided a double assist on 16 October 2010, in a 3–1 win over Nottingham Forest. Hammill added four more goals against Hull City, Preston North End, Portsmouth and Burnley. By the first half of the season, Hammill scored eight times in twenty–five appearances for the club, which he describe the 2010–11 season as a best season as professional.

Wolverhampton Wanderers
Eventually, on 20 January 2011, Hammill signed for Premier League side Wolverhampton Wanderers on a three-and-a-half-year contract after Wolves triggered a £500,000 buy-out clause in his contract. Hammill was previously linked with a move to Premier League's rival and his former club, Blackpool, before joining Wolverhampton Wanderers.

He made his Wolves debut as a substitute against boyhood and former club Liverpool two days later. He made ten appearances in total for the club during the remainder of the season, but found himself on the sidelines towards the end of the campaign as manager Mick McCarthy recalled the more experienced Stephen Hunt.

Ahead of the 2011–12 season, Hammill expressed determination to fight for his first team place at Wolverhampton Wanderers. The 2011–12 season saw Hammill making his first appearance of the season, playing 89th minutes, in a 4–0 win over Northampton in the first round of League Cup. Hammill then scored his first – and only goal – for Wolves, when he netted a free-kick in a League Cup tie against Millwall. However, although he made a series of substitute appearances in the Premier League during the first half of the season he was unable to establish himself in the team.

On 1 March 2012, he was sent on loan to Championship side Middlesbrough on an emergency loan deal until the end of the season. He made his debut two days later in a 3–1 away victory against Portsmouth, but he finished the campaign mostly on the substitutes bench before returning to Wolves.

Wolves had suffered relegation to the Championship at the end of the season, and now appointed Ståle Solbakken as their new manager. However this change of manager did not improve Hammill's involvement in Wolves' first team and he was again made available for loan. As a result, Hammill was placed on a transfer list.

Following his loan spell at Huddersfield Town came to an end, Hammill made four final appearances for Wolves, appearing as a substitute in a series of matches in the final months of the 2012–13 season as the club battled unsuccessfully under new manager Dean Saunders to avoid a second relegation. In total he made 27 appearances for Wolves, scoring once, before his time at Molineux ended as Kenny Jackett arrived as manager.

His impressive performance then earned him October Player of the Month. Hammill later scored three more goals later in the season against Barnsley, Blackburn Rovers and Middlesbrough. In an aftermath 2–1 loss against Wigan Athletic, Hammill was fined by the club after expressing frustrating when he was substituted.

Despite suffering ankle injury, Hammill went on to make forty–nine appearances and scoring five times and assisting twelve times in all competitions.

In the 2014–15 season, Hammill played four times at the start of the season. However, Hammill felt out of favour with Huddersfield Town manager Chris Powell, and subsequently was dropped from the team's match-day squad, as well as, his own injury concern.
