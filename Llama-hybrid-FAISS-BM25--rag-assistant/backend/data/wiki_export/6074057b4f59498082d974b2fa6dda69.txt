Paphinia dunstervillei is an orchid species native to Venezuela.

Taxonomy 
The classification of this orchid species was published by Calaway H. Dodson & Tilman Neudecker with their description based on two drawings in 1991. The name was invalid until a specimen could be obtained for proper identification under article 9.1 of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. A holotype of the species was collected on 31 May 1993 in Venezuela by G.A. Romero, Keeper of the Oakes Ames Orchid Herbarium at Harvard University. The pressed specimen is now part of the collection at Gray Herbarium at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts - USA. Etymology: Named after G.C.K. Dunsterville, who first collected and illustrated the species. Distribution is known from two sites in the Atabapo-Siapo shrublands of Venezuela.
