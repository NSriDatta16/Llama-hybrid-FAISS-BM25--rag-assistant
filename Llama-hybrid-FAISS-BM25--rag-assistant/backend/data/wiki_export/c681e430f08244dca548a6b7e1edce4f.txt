History
According to the legends of the Tahltan and Tlingit First Nations, Great Glacier once spanned the entire width of the Stikine River to meet the toe of Choquette Glacier on the eastern side of the valley. The glacier was also the site of the last major battle between the Tahltan and Tlingit First Nations many generations ago.

Geography
Great Glacier Park is located in the Boundary Ranges of British Columbia between the lower Stikine River and the Canadaâ€“United States border with Alaska. Immediately across the river from Great Glacier Park is Choquette Hot Springs Provincial Park, which protects a collection of hot springs and associated wetlands.
