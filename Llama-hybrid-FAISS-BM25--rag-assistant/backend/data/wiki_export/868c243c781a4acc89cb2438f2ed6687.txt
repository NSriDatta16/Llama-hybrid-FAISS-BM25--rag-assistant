Mabell Frances Elizabeth Ogilvy, Countess of Airlie,  (née Gore; 10 March 1866 – 7 April 1956) was a British courtier and author.

Early life
She was born the eldest daughter of Arthur Gore, Viscount Sudley, and his wife, Edith, daughter of Robert Jocelyn, Viscount Jocelyn. Her mother died in 1871 and she and her sisters, Cicely and Esther, were raised by their maternal grandmother, Lady Jocelyn. The sisters were educated by governesses and made visits to the Duchess of Teck at White Lodge, where Mabell Gore met and befriended the Duchess's daughter, Princess May (later Queen Mary). When her paternal grandfather, Philip Gore, 4th Earl of Arran, died in 1884 and her father inherited the former's titles, she and her sisters were entitled to the nominal prefix of Lady.

Life
On the outbreak of the Second Boer War in 1899, Lord Airlie went with his regiment, the 12th Royal Lancers, to South Africa, where he was killed in action at the Battle of Diamond Hill in 1900. After the end of the war in 1902, Lady Airlie paid a visit to South Africa.

Following her husband's death, Lady Airlie began to manage Cortachy Castle in Angus on behalf of her eldest son, David, the new earl, who was then only six years old. After opening the Dundee Sanatorium for Consumptives (i.e. for the treatment of tuberculosis), which had been built on a site gifted by her late husband shortly before his death on 1900, she was on 26 September 1902 presented with the Freedom of the City of Dundee.

In December 1901, she became a Lady of the Bedchamber to her old friend, the Princess of Wales (as Princess May had become). On the accession of King George V in 1910, Lady Airlie was retained at court as a Lady of the Bedchamber to the-now Queen Mary.

World War I
During World War I she supported the Red Cross and was appointed a Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE) in the 1920 civilian war honours list for her services as president of Queen Alexandra's Army Nursing Board.

However, she suffered losses in her family during the war: her son-in-law, Clement (the eldest son of Algernon Freeman-Mitford, 1st Baron Redesdale), was killed in action in 1915, her youngest son, Patrick, was also killed in action in 1917 and her daughter, Mabell, was killed whilst exercising army horses in 1918.

Later life
In 1953, the countess's employer and lifelong friend, Queen Mary, died, and Elizabeth II appointed her a Dame Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO) for her many years of service. She later moved from Airlie Castle to Bayswater Road, London in 1955. She died there a few weeks after her ninetieth birthday in 1956.

Works
When Lady Airlie's eldest son married in 1917, she moved from Cortachy Castle to Airlie Castle and embarked on a career as an author. She published family letters, titled In Whig Society, 1775–1818 (1921) and Lady Palmerston and her Times (1922). The works were based on the papers of her great-grandmother, born Emily Lamb, a leading figure of the Almack's social set, sister to Prime Minister Lord Melbourne, wife to the 5th Earl Cowper, and subsequently wife to another Prime Minister Lord Palmerston.  A later book, With the Guards We Shall Go (1933), detailed her great-uncle, John Jocelyn, 5th Earl of Roden, through the Crimean War.

As a confidante to Queen Mary, Lady Airlie was a close observer of the fluctuating relationships within the British Royal Family, and detailed her reminiscences about them in her memoirs. The unfinished manuscript was discovered after her death, and was published as Thatched with Gold: The Memoirs of Mabell, Countess of Airlie in 1962.
