Holles became an author often writing on military life but not limited to this alone.
Holles was prolific in the 1960s and '70s, he wrote with wry humour in such works as Religion and Davey Peach, and experimented with the horror genre in Spawn amongst his non-fiction books he wrote on his experiences with Soldiering (The Guide to Real Subversive Soldiering).
Holles lived for many years in the Essex village of Stebbing and was a keen village cricketer there which was reflected in his book The Guide to Real Village Cricket.

As well as published works he was a successful TV writer with credits for Coronation Street and Hine, as well as one-offs for the prestigious Play for Today slot on the BBC's main TV channel (Michael Regan and The Vanishing Army), two episodes for The Man Outside (Drama series, BBC 1972) and several plays in Thames TV's Armchair Theatre series.
