St Keyne Wishing Well Halt railway station () is an intermediate station on the scenic Looe Valley Line in Cornwall, England. It serves the village of St Keyne, and is adjacent to the Magnificent Music Machines museum of fairground organs and similar instruments.

St Keyne's Well is a holy well dedicated to Saint Keyne, located about  south of the station.

History
The Liskeard and Looe Railway was opened on 27 December 1860 to carry goods traffic; passenger trains started on 11 September 1879.  The railway in those days connected only with the Liskeard and Caradon Railway at Moorswater. The link from Coombe Junction to Liskeard railway station opened on 25 February 1901 and St Keyne station opened in October 1902.

Naming

It is one of only two stations on the network to have the suffix "halt": the other is Coombe Junction on the same line. The term "halt" was removed from British Rail timetables and station signs and other official documents by 1974: the return of the term came in 1978 for the opening of IBM Halt in Scotland and in the renaming of these two stations in 2008.

The station name is rendered on tickets as merely 'St Keyne'.

Facilities
The only facilities are a small waiting shelter and information boards, including timetable posters. There are no ticket buying facilities, so passengers have to buy a ticket in advance or from the guard on the train.

Services

All trains on the  to  "Looe Valley Line" that are scheduled to call at St Keyne do so only on request. This means that passengers alighting here must tell the conductor that they wish to do so, and those waiting to join must signal clearly to the driver as the train approaches.  There is no Sunday service in the winter.

Community rail
The railway between Liskeard and Looe is designated as community rail and is supported by marketing provided by the Devon and Cornwall Rail Partnership.

The line is promoted as the "Looe Valley Line".
