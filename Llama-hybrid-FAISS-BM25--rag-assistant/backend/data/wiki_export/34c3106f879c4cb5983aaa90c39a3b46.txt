The Ivor Novello Awards, named after the entertainer Ivor Novello, are awards for songwriting and composing. They have been presented annually in London by the Ivors Academy, formerly called the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors, since 1956.

Awards
The awards are presented at two annual ceremonies known as The Ivors and The Ivors Composer Awards.

The Ivors take place each May and, as of 2020, are sponsored by Apple Music. They are recognized worldwide as the major platform for recognising and rewarding Britain and Ireland's songwriting and composing talents. The Ivors remain the only award ceremony in the musical calendar that is not influenced by publishers and record companies, but judged and presented by the writing community. 

The Ivors Composer Awards take place each December and are sponsored by PRS for Music. They are broadcast by BBC Radio 3.

The award itself is a solid bronze sculpture of Euterpe, the muse of lyric poetry. It was designed in 1955 by Hazel Underwood.
