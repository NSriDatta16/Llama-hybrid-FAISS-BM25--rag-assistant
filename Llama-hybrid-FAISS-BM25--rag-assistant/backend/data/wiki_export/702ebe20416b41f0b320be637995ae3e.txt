Wichita Falls Independent School District (WFISD) is a public school district based in Wichita Falls, Texas, United States and is accredited by the Texas Education Agency.

Wichita Falls ISD serves most of Wichita Falls (including portions of Sheppard Air Force Base). Varying parts of north Wichita Falls are included in the City View Independent School District and the Burkburnett Independent School District.

The Wichita Falls ISD was one of the few Texas school districts to offer a choice program that gives parents the choice of what secondary school they would like their child to attend. Wichita Falls ISD ended the choice program for all schools beginning with the 2015-2016 year.

Secondary schools in the WFISD offer Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate courses to students wishing to pursue a more challenging academic curriculum. The WFISD currently operates two schools with the International Baccalaureate program, covering two segments of the program:
G.H. Kirby Math/ Science Junior High and Hirschi High School partner in offering the Middle Years Programme
Hirschi High School, an IB World School, offers the IB Diploma Programme to juniors and seniors

The school district has continuously been recognized for its overall academic success from the Texas Education Agency and the Magnet Schools of America Association. In 1999 and 2001 respectively, Washington/ Jackson Math/Science Center and G.H. Kirby Junior High were awarded the Ronald P. Simpson award, giving them the title of "Best Magnet School in America" for a year. The district also boasts that many of its schools have received the Texas Blue Ribbon award or have attained "Exemplary" status from the TEA.

In 2005, Hirschi High School IB World Topics teacher Sherry Lindemann was named Texas Teacher of the Year where she represented the WFISD and thousands of Texas teachers at a formal ceremony held by President George W. Bush and First Lady Laura Bush in the White House Rose Garden.

In 2009, the school district was rated "academically acceptable" by the Texas Education Agency.
