The Broughton, later Broughton-Delves, later Broughton Baronetcy, of Broughton in the County of Stafford, is a title in the Baronetage of England. It was created on 10 March 1661 for Sir Brian Broughton, of Broughton Hall, near Eccleshall, Staffordshire, High Sheriff of Staffordshire from 1660 to 1661 and the member of an ancient Staffordshire family.

History
The Broughtons are descended from the ancient Vernon family and in particular from Richard Vernon, fourth son of the 3rd medieval Baron Vernon of Shipbrook, Cheshire. Adam, his son, was of Napton, Warwickshire. Adams's grandson Roger acquired the estate at Broughton, Staffordshire, from which the surname derives, in the 13th century. The first Baronet was the son of Thomas Broughton (died 1648) who was an ardent Royalist and supporter of Charles I and who was obliged to compound at a cost of £3200, for the return of his estates following sequestration by the Parliament at the conclusion of the Civil War. His son was honoured with the baronetcy at the Restoration of Charles II.

The baronetcy was dormant between 1993 and 2022. 
In 2022, Geoffrey Delves Broughton proved his right of succession. He is the great-great-grandson of Reverend Sir Thomas Delves Broughton, second son of the eighth Baronet.

The family seat is Doddington Hall, near Nantwich, Cheshire. It remains in the family of Sir Evelyn Delves Broughton, 12th Baronet. In the past, the family had also Broughton Hall, an estate in Staffordshire, but this property was sold to John Hall in 1914.

Other members of the family

Several other members of the family have also gained distinction. William Robert Broughton (1762–1821), great-grandson of Charles Broughton, younger son of the first Baronet, was a captain in the Royal Navy. Theodore Delves Broughton (1872–1944), grandson of Reverend Thomas Delves Broughton, eldest son of Thomas Delves Broughton, third son of the sixth Baronet, was a Colonel and temporary brigadier in the Royal Engineers. 

William Edward Delves Broughton (1802–1880), second son of the aforementioned Thomas Delves Broughton, third son of the sixth Baronet, was a General in the Royal Engineers. His second son William Edward Delves Broughton (1837–1895) was a major-general in the Bengal Army. Rhoda Broughton (1840–1920), daughter of the Rev Delves Broughton (1812–1863) and granddaughter of the 8th Baronet, the Rev Sir Henry Delves Broughton, was a noted author.

Isabella Blow (née Delves Broughton) (1958–2007) was raised on the Doddington Park estate, a daughter of Sir Evelyn Delves Broughton, 12th Baronet. She was an influential late 20th-century figure in fashion and art.

The journalist and author Philip Delves Broughton is descended from the Delves Broughton family.
