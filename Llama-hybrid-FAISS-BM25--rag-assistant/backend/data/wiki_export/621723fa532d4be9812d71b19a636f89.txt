The Multi-State Collaborative to Advance Quality Student Learning
The Multi-State Collaborative to Advance Quality Student Learning is a collaboration led by the AAC&U and the state higher education executive officers. As of October 2016, the project involved 900 faculty members at 80 public two- and four-year institutions in 13 states. The project aims to produce a cross-institutional method of evaluating student learning by getting faculty from different institutions to agree on a set of general education outcomes by using a common rubric, the AAC&U Value Rubrics, for evaluating student work. The leaders of this collaboration hope that results of the project will "paint an accurate picture of learning nationwide and, in turn, spark continuing improvement. The notability of the project is its "subject of analysis: the authentic stuff of college â€“ the homework, problem sets, and papers that students regularly produce."
