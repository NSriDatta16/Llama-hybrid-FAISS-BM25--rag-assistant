The Westchester County Center is a 5,000-seat multi-purpose arena in White Plains, New York. It hosts various local concerts and sporting events for the area.

The County Center was conceived by the Westchester Recreation Commission in 1924 as a multi-purpose indoor recreational facility to host community programs and income-producing commercial events.  It was designed by the architectural firm of Walker & Gillette, and built and decorated in the Art Deco style. The construction project cost approximately $785,000; a $16-million rehabilitation was completed in 1988.

The Streets folded after one season.
 During March 2020, it was announced that the Westchester County Center would be used to hold COVID-19 patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. During a March 30, 2020 press conference in the White House Rose Garden, President Donald Trump discussed the conversion of the Westchester County Center to a makeshift hospital, although he referred to it as the "Westchester Community Center."
