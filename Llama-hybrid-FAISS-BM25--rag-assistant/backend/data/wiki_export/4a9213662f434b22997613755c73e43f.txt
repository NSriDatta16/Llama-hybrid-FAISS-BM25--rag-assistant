Gideon Emery (born September 12, 1972) is an English actor and singer. He is best known for his role as Deucalion in Teen Wolf and for providing voice-over work in video games, television series and films.

Early life and education
Emery was born to Pauline, a competitive horse rider and Ashton, a management consultant. He has two half brothers, Matthew and Paul. Gideon also has three nieces, Chloe Emery, Rebecca Emery and Kate Emery. At the age of 4, his father moved the family to Johannesburg, South Africa. Emery kept himself amused by imitating characters from film and television. Early impersonations included Michael Jackson and Max from Hart to Hart. He returned to England during high school, briefly attending Reading Blue Coat School. But it was back in South Africa at St John's College where he cemented his love for acting, playing Dick Deadeye in the Gilbert & Sullivan musical H.M.S. Pinafore and winning Best Actor for the role of Mr. Glum in The Glums comedy sketch, "L'Engagement". After briefly considering a career in graphic art, he went on to study acting at the University of the Witwatersrand. Student roles included Salieri in Amadeus and Gregor in Steven Berkoff's adaption of Kafka's The Metamorphosis.

Personal life
On October 19, 2014, Emery married his wife, actress Autumn Withers at Santa Barbara, California. Emery currently lives in Los Angeles with his wife and their dog. In 2017, Emery and his wife revealed that they were expecting their first child together. On April 7, 2018, they welcomed their daughter, Mia Monroe Emery.

Career
In his third year of drama school, friend Ashley Callie was going to audition for Johannesburg's annual Christmas pantomime, directed by the award-winning Janice Honeyman. Emery was persuaded to go along and ended up being cast. He played a couple of characters, but impressed with his stand-up routine during a set change. As a result, fellow cast member, veteran actor Bill Flynn introduced him to his agent and his career was started. Around this time, he also began what was to become a prolific voice career. (He would later win a Gold Craft Award at the 2003 Loerie Advertising Awards) He played in a number of stand-up venues and established himself as character actor, often performing multiple roles within a single play, such as all the male roles in Mark Ravenhill's Sleeping Around and Tom, Leslie and Phyllis in A.R. Gurney's Sylvia.

He performed standup comedy on television and was a series regular on the sketch comedy show Not Quite Friday Night. He received the National Vita Award for Comedy for the role of Maloom in the play Heel Against the Head, once again alongside Bill Flynn and actor/playwright Paul Slabolepszy. Emery has also performed his own one-man plays, Thin Man Talking and The Great Glendini. For the latter, he recorded a jazz standards album, Standard Ease. He acted alongside the late Bill Flynn for a third and final time, playing Bernard to Flynn's Willy Loman in the award-winning Baxter Theatre production of Death of a Salesman.

 Thanks to his keen ear for accents, Emery found himself playing various roles in visiting British and American film and television productions. He soon decided that the screen was where he wanted to focus his attention. With most major projects casting their lead roles overseas, he decided it was time to explore more diverse opportunities. In late 2003, he moved to Los Angeles, where he has played memorable characters both on screen (Last Resort, Takers, Moonlight, Burn Notice) and for video games such as Final Fantasy XII, Vanquish, Dragon Age II and Tekken series (starting from Tekken 6 - present). He is an in-demand motion capture performer and can be seen and heard in the games Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, Battlefield 3 and Halo Wars 2, all of which also use his likeness. He has also narrated over 50 audiobooks.

Emery had a recurring role on the hit MTV series Teen Wolf as season three's main antagonist Deucalion, a blind but powerful Alpha werewolf who leads a pack consisting entirely of Alphas. Emery reprised the role in season five: "To prove not only to others, but also to himself, that Deucalion is capable of being true and noble." He would return once again for the final season of the show. He won multiple best actor awards for his role as Richard Pine in Bill Hanson's adaptation of Stephen King's Survivor Type. On the lighter side, Emery is the creator, director and star of E&N with Ed Neusbit, a comedic news parody show offering "all the news you never knew you needed". Other recurring roles include Daredevil, Shameless, Last Resort, Good Behavior and Scream: Resurrection. In 2020, Emery joined the cast of Netflix series Dash & Lily as Lily's father.
