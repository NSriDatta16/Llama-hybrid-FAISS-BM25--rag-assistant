The video was directed by Jonas Ã…kerlund, and featured Everlast walking around the streets of London and the London Underground, passing very strange people, makes it to the top, and walks past clowns and little people. The video later ends when Everlast has made it to the top of a building. Two parts of the video were cut for TV, mainly the part where he is walking along the road and gets hit by car, and at the end of video where Everlast jumps off the top of the building.
