Landmarks 
In the center of the town is the medieval St. Jürgen Church (de). The construction began before 1250 and was completed with the 64 m high church tower around 1494.

In the pedestrian zone at Alexanderplatz, a small statue of the devil recalls an old legend, according to which the devil threw a rock, the devil's stone (de), at the church tower, which was diverted by God and thus only grazed the tower, leaving it slightly crooked. This stone can be found outside Gettorf in the municipality of Lindau on the road between Revensdorf and Großkönigsförde. 

Also, very popular for the town is its zoo with more than 850 animals that is very popular for both children and adults and was opened more than 50 years ago.
