History
In 1910, the Glasgow School of Navigation was founded. The school would be later renamed the Glasgow College of Nautical Studies.

The marine facility at the college was primarily housed in a purpose-built boat shed built in 1968 beside the Clyde. In 1969, the facility was officially opened by Lord Mountbatten. In May 2009, the college secured Â£5.6 million to replace the shed and construct a new marine college campus. Much of the funding came from the Scottish Funding Council.

In September 2009, the college was partially evacuated due to a chemical incident. In 2010, the college became part of the City of Glasgow College.
