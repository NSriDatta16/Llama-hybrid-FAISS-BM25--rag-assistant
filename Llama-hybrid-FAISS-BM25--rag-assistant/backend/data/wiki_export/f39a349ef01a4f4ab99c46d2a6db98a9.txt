"Whoops Now" and "What'll I Do" are two songs by American singer-songwriter Janet Jackson from her fifth studio album, Janet (1993). They were released as a double A-side single on March 6, 1995, as the album's final single. The songs reached number one in New Zealand and peaked within the top 20 in several countries.

Background
"Whoops Now" and "What'll I Do" were released as a double A-side in Europe, Japan, and Oceania, whereas the latter was released on its own in Oceania as well as certain European markets. Both releases included janet.s "The Body That Loves You" as a B-side. "Whoops Now" was added as a hidden track on the regular edition of janet. after the interlude "Sweet Dreams", while the UK and Japanese pressings of the album list the tracks separately. An edited version of the song also appears on the international version of Jackson's first greatest hits package, Design of a Decade: 1986–1996. The shorter version omits the risqué coda about activities in Anguilla. A remix of "What'll I Do" by Dave Navarro appears on Jackson's second remix album janet. Remixed.

"What'll I Do" is a cover of a Johnny Daye song called "What'll I Do for Satisfaction", which was released in 1967 and written by Joe Shamwell and Steve Cropper.

Jackson performed both songs on the janet. Tour, while she only performed "Whoops Now" on The Velvet Rope Tour.

Critical reception
British magazine Music Week gave "Whoops Now" three out of five, adding that "this single has an uncharacteristic Motown feel to it and could zoom up the charts, helped by a cute accompanying video."

Music video
