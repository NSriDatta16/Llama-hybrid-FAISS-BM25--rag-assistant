Nu Caeli (ν Caeli) is a yellow-white hued star in the constellation Caelum. It has an apparent visual magnitude of 6.07, which indicates it is near the lower limit on brightness that is visible to the naked eye. According to the Bortle scale, the star can be viewed from dark suburban skies. Based upon an annual parallax shift of  as seen from Earth, this star is located  from the Sun.

Houk (1978) listed a stellar classification of F2/3 V for Nu Caeli, which would indicate this is an F-type main-sequence star. In contrast, Malaroda (1975) assigned it to class F1 III-IV, which would suggest it is a more evolved F-type subgiant/giant transitional object. It is an estimated 880 million years old with 1.34 times the mass of the Sun. The star is radiating eight times the Sun's luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of .

A companion is listed in multiple star catalogues.  It is a 10th-magnitude star about  away, much further away than ν Caeli and unrelated.
