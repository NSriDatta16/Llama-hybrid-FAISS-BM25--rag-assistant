Titanium(III) fluoride is the inorganic compound with the formula TiF3.   A violet, paramagnetic solid, it is one of two titanium fluorides, the other being titanium tetrafluoride.  It adopts a defect perovskite-like structure such that each Ti center has octahedral coordination geometry, and each fluoride ligand is doubly bridging.

Titanium(III) fluoride can be prepared by dissolution of titanium metal in hydrogen fluoride.
