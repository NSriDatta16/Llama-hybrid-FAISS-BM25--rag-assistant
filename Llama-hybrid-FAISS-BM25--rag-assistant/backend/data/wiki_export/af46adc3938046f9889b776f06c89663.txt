Innoko Wilderness is a  wilderness area in the U.S. state of Alaska.  It was designated by the United States Congress in 1980. It lies within the southeastern part of Innoko National Wildlife Refuge.  Innoko Wilderness is a transition zone between the boreal forestland of interior Alaska and the open tundra of western Alaska.  More than half of the Wilderness is wetlands of muskeg and marsh, lakes, rivers, and streams dotted with islands of black spruce and an understory of mosses, lichens, and shrubs.  Along the Yukon and Innoko Rivers are numerous privately owned subsistence camps used periodically for hunting and fishing by Alaska Natives.
