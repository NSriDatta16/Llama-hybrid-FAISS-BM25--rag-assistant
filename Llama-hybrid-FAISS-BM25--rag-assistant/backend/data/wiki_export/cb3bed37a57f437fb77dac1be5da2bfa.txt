Leptospermum recurvum is a species of shrub or tree that is native to Mount Kinabalu in Malaysian Borneo and to Sulawesi. It has pale, flaky bark, broadly elliptical to almost round leaves, white flowers about  wide and fruit that tend to remain on the plant for a year or two.

Description
Leptospermum recurvum is sometimes a prostrate shrub, sometimes a tree to  or more in height. It has thin, pale, flaky bark and young stems that have a broad flange near the leaf bases. The leaves are broadly elliptical to egg-shaped or almost round with their edges strongly curved downwards, mostly  long and  wide, and lack a petiole. The upper surface of the leaves is mostly glossy and the lower surface usually silky-hairy at first. The flowers are white, about  wide and arranged singly on short side shoots. There are broad reddish brown bracts at the base of the flower buds that mostly remain at the base of the open flowers. The floral cup is  long, tapering to a short pedicel. The sepals are  long and almost hemispherical, the petals are about  long and the stamens about  long. Flowering probably occurs in most months. The fruit is a capsule  wide and that tends to remain on the plant for a few years.
