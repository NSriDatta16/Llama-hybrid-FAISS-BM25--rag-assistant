"Café del Mar" is a song first released in 1993 by the trance project Energy 52. It is named after the famous bar located in Ibiza, Balearic Islands, Spain. Almost instantly recognisable by its distinct melody, its popularity is reflected in the countless remixes that have since been created as well as its being featured on hundreds of CD compilations. The main melody of "Café del Mar" is based on "Struggle for Pleasure" by Belgian composer Wim Mertens.

The song has charted two times on the UK Singles Chart, with both releases featuring remixes by Three 'N One. It first made number 24 in March 1997, and a second release ("Café del Mar '98") featuring a Nalin & Kane remix reached number 12 in July 1998.

The song was included on the soundtrack to the 1999 film Human Traffic. In 2001, it was voted number one in Mixmag'''s "100 Best Tunes Ever" list. In 2011, it was voted number one out of fifty nominated tracks in the 'Top 20 Dance Tracks of Last 20 Years' users poll by listeners of BBC Radio 1.
