Bloom was the fourth album released by Jeff Coffin, and was issued in 2005. This album was the second album recorded and released with the Mu'tet, a constantly changing group of guest musicians that play with Coffin.

Reception

In a review for AllMusic, Jonathan Widran wrote: "All over the place? Sure. Self-indulgent? Maybe. But take away a track or two and the open-minded listener has probably never had this much crazy fun on one collection. So get over it."

Matt Merewitz of All About Jazz stated: "With Bloom Coffin and the Mu'tet successfully take the listener on a sonic journey through such an abundance of styles, colors, and textures that any attempt to box Coffin or the Mu'tet into one singular style would be an exercise in futility. Check out this record. You'll be glad you did."

Writing for Jambands.com, Karl Kukta noted that, with the album, "Coffin has decided to pretty much stick with the recipe," and drew comparisons with the music of Béla Fleck and the Flecktones, commenting: "The perpetually buoyant vibe — the frequent use of complex time signatures — the benign infusion of Eastern and Western music that teeters ever so closely to the still waters of New Age and smooth jazz... am I missing anything?"
