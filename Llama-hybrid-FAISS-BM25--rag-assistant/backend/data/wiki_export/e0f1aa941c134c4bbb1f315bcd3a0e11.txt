American singer and songwriter Janet Jackson has released fifty-two music videos, in addition to eight video albums and two concert tour videos. Upon the debut of Control, she became a dominant figure in entertainment, establishing herself as one of the pioneers of the video era. Her videography is considered among the most influential in popular culture by critics, who have lauded their elaborate sets, intricate dance routines, fashion, and meticulous detail. Her story-telling videos display various concepts, ranging from large production pieces to socially conscious themes and controversial depictions of intimacy. Throughout her work, Jackson was a preeminent influence in establishing the art of performance and choreography within music video. Her videos have been described as the entertainment industry's highest standard, which Rolling Stone observed to create templates for numerous artists. VH1 ranked her
among the greatest women in music video, while MTV honored her with the Video Vanguard Award and inaugural Icon tribute for her impact within entertainment.

Jackson's music videos have collectively won numerous accolades, such as Grammy Awards for Best Long and Short Form videos, MTV Japan's "Inspiration Award", and Billboard Awards' "Music Video Award for Artistic Achievement". Her early videos, such as "Nasty", "The Pleasure Principle", and "Alright", became iconic for their intense choreography and locale. "Rhythm Nation" has been thought to portray the most influential choreography and setting in a music video by multiple critics, achieving legendary status. "Love Will Never Do (Without You)" unveiled Jackson's physical evolution to adulthood, while "If" showcased its famous dance routine, interracial lust, and futuristic technology. Other notable videos include the spiritual theme of "Together Again" and aquatic scenery in "Every Time". Videos such as "All for You" and "Feedback" have also influenced a diverse array of artists. Jackson has multiple videos ranked among the most expensive of all-time, which include "Doesn't Really Matter" and "Scream", the most expensive in history.

Background 

The video for Jackson's song "What Have You Done For Me Lately" catapulted her into "megastar status", while "Nasty" was declared "a feminist film theorist's programmatic deconstruction of the male gaze". "Control" depicted a stage performance, as she portrayed what would later become her signature moves. "Let's Wait Awhile" marked the directorial debut of Dominic Sena, whose collaborations with Jackson lead him to direct films starring Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. "Miss You Much" became notorious for its industrial setting and iconic chair routine, which Glenn Gamboa considered to have "changed the way radio sounded and MTV looked". "The Pleasure Principle" depicts a lengthy freestyle dance performance and chair sequence, which Entertainment Tonight observed to be "ripped off wholesale by pop acts ever since". Aspects of the video have been emulated by Robyn, Britney Spears, Lady Gaga, The Pussycat Dolls, Cassie  Ciara, and Jennifer Lopez, inspiring her to pursue a career in entertainment.

"Rhythm Nation" depicts militant choreography in an industrial warehouse setting. Rolling Stone declared it "the gold standard for dystopian dance-pop music videos", featuring "the most memorable choreography in pop video history". The publication also regarded it to "set the template for hundreds of videos to come". Entertainment Weekly considered it "legendary" and "groundbreaking", in addition to "striking, timeless and instantly recognizable". Aylin Zatar remarked, "She also basically pioneered the dancing in a warehouse, post-apocalyptic, industrial setting video. So, Britney (“Till the World Ends”), Rihanna (“Hard”), Lady Gaga (“Alejandro”), and even the Spice Girls (“Spice Up Your Life”) – you all have Ms. Jackson to thank." Its long-form version, depicting several performances and drug abuse, won a Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video. The carnival theme and setting of "Escapade" was later recreated in Lady Gaga's "Judas". "Alright" revisits classic Hollywood musicals, with Jackson starring as the leading protagonist. It was thought to inspire Chris Brown's "Yeah 3x", Ne-Yo's "One in a Million", and Cheyenne Jackson's "Don't Wanna Know". It was also the first pop video to feature a guest rapper, setting the trend for later collaborations.

"Love Will Never Do (Without You)" unveiled Jackson's physique using classic lighting and imagery. It also explored the aesthetic of the male body from both the heterosexual female and gay male perspective. Its setting and theme influenced Britney Spears' "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know", Jennifer Lopez's "First Love", and Nicole Scherzinger's "Your Love", and was also compared with Lopez's "I'm Into You". It was voted MTV's favorite female video in history during the next decade. "That's the Way Love Goes" used an intimate and "lo-fi" loft setting, later emulated by Nelly Furtado, 'N Sync, and Prince in "Breakfast Can Wait". It also introduced a then-unknown Jennifer Lopez. Jackson's "If" video became iconic for its modern club setting and complex dance routine, which Slant Magazine called among the greatest in history. Its portrayal of interracial lust and voyeurism had also been controversial, later inspiring Britney Spears' "I'm a Slave 4 U". It displayed technology such as touch screens and web cameras, which were not invented at the time. "You Want This" used a desert locale, as Jackson portrayed a female gang leader.

"Got 'til It's Gone" displayed a stark contrast from Jackson's mainstream image; portraying a pre-Apartheid celebration upon the freedom of slavery. It won a Grammy Award for "Best Short Form Music Video". "Together Again" incorporated a savanna atmosphere, tribal attire, and spiritual theme; inspiring Rihanna's "Where Have You Been". The premise of "Go Deep" depicts a teenage fan who dreams she arrives at his house for a party. "Every Time" gained controversy for nudity within its bath tub scenes, and was later compared with Britney Spears' "Everytime" and Rihanna's "Stay". "Doesn't Really Matter" became the first of director Joseph Kahn's videos to incorporate futuristic Japanese imagery; also being among the ten most expensive videos in history. Elements of its "high-tech" Japanese city, mobile architecture, and choreography would influence various artists, including videos from Britney Spears, Mariah Carey, and Jessica Simpson.

Jackson's attire in "All for You" was considered to inspire fashion trends, while Variety observed the imagery of "Someone to Call My Lover" to be influential. "Son of a Gun" displayed a "dark, brooding revenge tale" using voodoo and telekenesis, thought to inspire Justin Timberlake's "Cry Me a River". Jackson filmed herself on DVD in "Just a Little While"; its plot later applied via Skype in Kelela's "Melba's Call". "All Nite (Don't Stop)" took place in an abandoned warehouse during a power outage, using a car battery to restore electricity. "So Excited" became the first music video to use Panavision Genesis x-ray technology. The galactic theme and visuals of "Feedback" were observed to be incorporated in multiple videos, from artists including Namie Amuro, David Guetta, Misha B, and Robin Thicke.
