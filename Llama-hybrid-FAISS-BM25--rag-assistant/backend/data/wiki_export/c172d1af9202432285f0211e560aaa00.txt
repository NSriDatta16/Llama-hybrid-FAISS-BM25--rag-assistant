Galway was a parliamentary constituency represented in Dáil Éireann, the lower house of the Irish parliament or Oireachtas from 1921 to 1937. The method of election was proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote (PR-STV).

History 
It was the largest constituency in Ireland, electing 7 deputies (Teachtaí Dála, commonly known as TDs) to the Dáil in 1921 and 1922, and 9 from 1923 to 1937. The constituency was created in 1921 as a 7-seat constituency, under the Government of Ireland Act 1920, for the 1921 elections to the House of Commons of Southern Ireland. That House had only a brief existence, as only four members took their seats, the remainder forming the Second Dáil.

Under the Electoral Act 1923, it became a 9-seat constituency for the 1923 general election to the 4th Dáil. Its representation remained at 9 seats until its abolition at the 1937 general election, under the Electoral (Revision of Constituencies) Act 1935.
