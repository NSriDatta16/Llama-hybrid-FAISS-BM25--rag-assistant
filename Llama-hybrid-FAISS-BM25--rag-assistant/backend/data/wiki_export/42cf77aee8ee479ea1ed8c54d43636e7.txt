Pronoian Made was an alternative rock/gothic metal band from Luxembourg which gained notoriety for being the first to play gothic influenced rock in the country, and also for being the first to succeed beyond national borders.

History
Founded in 1989 by Oliver Made (vocals and guitar) initially under the name The Escape and later Hegemonikon, before finally settling on Pronoian Made. The name changes reflected the natural evolution from punk music in the early days to a more mature and modern rock and metal sound with melancholic melodies and ethereal guitars, often compared to Sister of Mercy. The band released three official albums, earning them positive reviews from gothic music magazines (like Zillo, Orkus and Sonic Seducer) and putting "the new hope of the gothic-metal scene" on the radar of several European tour promoters.

Pronoian Made had already earned a solid reputation as live musicians  by playing numerous concerts throughout Luxembourg and across the nearby borders, before the positive reviews of both "Welcome in Pronoia" and "EP1613" gave them the opportunity to play to larger, international audiences in France and Germany, including several major music festivals. In the wake of the EP1613 release, the band played Emergenza Festival, Rock um Knuedler and Eurorock Festival, opened for bigger bands, like HIM, The Crüxshadows, Clan of Xymox, and Zeraphine, which finally culminated in playing the legendary Wave-Gotik-Treffen in Leipzig - twice - as well as being featured on the official festival sampler (again, twice), achieving something no other rock band from Luxembourg has ever managed before them.

The first Wave Gotik Treffen performance of Pronoian Made marked the band's apex; in the following year, bassist Dan Gerous departed the band in the middle of recording of "Circus Made", the follow-up album to EP1613, citing personal reasons. While he retired from playing, his new projects are still music related, working as a concert photographer and launching The Black Angel online shop, which provides many musicians and artists with stage apparel (including Nathan "Joey" Jordison, Nik Page, November-7, Chris Angel & Cirque du Soleil and Universal Studios).

After a short hiatus, the band line-up was complemented by a new bassist (ex-Pale Obsession) Joe May and the return of Hegemonikon drummer Luc Hoffman. The songs from "Circus Made" were overhauled with a different sound and re-recorded, and the album later released under the name "Cherubim". Pronoian Made toured Europe for another year, leading to the second Wave Gotik Performance, but in the end the band could not regain the same momentum, and ultimately split. Neal Lisé and Luc Hoffmann retired from music, while Oliver Made and Joe May went on to form a new band together in 2009, Luceed, playing ethnic influenced keyboard and guitars music the band calls "Voodoo-Pop".

"Cherubim" was the last official output of the band, whose discography spans three official albums ("Welcome in Pronoia", "EP1613" and "Cherubim") and numerous samplers ("Künstler zum WGT vol.11 & 13", "Dark Awakenings vol.3", "Dark Horizons", "Zillo-Scope 06/2004", and more).
