This is a list of the administrative and municipal divisions of Moscow Oblast, a federal subject of Russia.

Moscow Oblast is located in the Central Federal District of Russia, and surrounds Moscow, the capital of Russia.  While Moscow hosts the majority of the government bodies of the oblast, it does not officially serve as the oblast's administrative center and is not otherwise associated with the oblast either administratively or municipally.

The oblast is, like other Russian federal subjects, subdivided for the purposes of the state administration and for the purposes of the local self-government, the rights to which are guaranteed by the Constitution of Russia.  While the administrative and municipal divisions are not required by law to be identical, the system of municipal divisions in Moscow Oblast, having been created on the basis of existing administrative divisions, has only minor differences from the system of administrative divisions.

History
The oblast was established within the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic on January 14, 1929, as Central Industrial Oblast () from abolished Moscow, Ryazan, Tula, and Tver Governorates, as well as from parts of Kaluga and Vladimir Governorates.  On June 3, 1929, the oblast was given its present name.

In September 1937, the oblast was split into Moscow, Ryazan, and Tula Oblasts, thus establishing itself in its present borders.

A part of Moscow Oblast's territory, including the towns of Troitsk, Shcherbinka, and Moskovsky, urban-type settlements of Kokoshkino and Kiyevsky, as well as parts of territories of Leninsky, Naro-Fominsky, and Podolsky Districts, was transferred to the federal city of Moscow on JulyÂ 1, 2012.
