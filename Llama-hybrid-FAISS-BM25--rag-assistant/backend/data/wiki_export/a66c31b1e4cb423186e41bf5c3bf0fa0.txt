James H. Allen (May 15, 1928 – July 28, 2015) was an American actor who portrayed the clown character Rusty Nails and was the host of various children's television shows in the Portland, Oregon television market from 1957–1972. His program on  KPTV was the second-longest running children's program in Portland, second only to Ramblin' Rod Anders. He partly inspired the character of Krusty the Clown on The Simpsons.

He hosted shows on KOIN, KPTV, and KATU as Rusty Nails. In 1998 he wrote an autobiographical book called "Send in the clowns".

Allen died on July 28, 2015, of congestive heart failure at the age of 87 after a month of hospice care in Portland.
