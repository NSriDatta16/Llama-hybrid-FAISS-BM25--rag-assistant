Fort Hill High School is a four-year public high school in Cumberland, Maryland, United States, serving 780 students in grades 9 through 12. Fort Hill  is part of Allegany County Public Schools.

History

Fort Hill High School was one of three local New Deal projects.  Fort Hill High school was a Public Works Administration project.  Nearby Constitution Park and Greeway Avenue Stadium were Works Progress Administration projects

New Deal funding relating to Fort Hill was initiated in November 1934 and September 1935, when the PWA committed federal funds not to exceed $230,000. The project was labeled PWA Docket #7323.  Other sources brought the total amount pledged for the school to $600,000. Bids were submitted to local officials.

On April 5, 1936, it was announced that George Hazelwood, local contractor, had the lowest bid at $557,809. The initial contract did not provide funding for the auditorium, so the superintendent of schools was authorized to investigate the possibilities of requesting an increase in the grant from the PWA. Subcontractors were William M. Clark of New Castle, Pennsylvania, and Sterling Electric Company of Cumberland, Maryland.

A discussion ensued concerning the naming of the new school - suggested names were Queen City High School, Potomac High School, Fort and Hill High School and Fort Hill High School. The Board of Education of Allegany County unanimously decided upon the name Fort Hill High School on August 12, 1936. The "Fort" reference was derived from a Civil War skirmish at Nave's Crossroad often referred to as the Battle of Folck's Mill. The high ground above the mill was fortified by Union troops against Confederate forces.

When Fort Hill opened, it had 1763 students and 88 teachers. Mr. Heisey was the first principal. Subjects included English, Mathematics, French, Latin, History, Home Economics, Physical Education, Industrial Arts, and Journalism. Music was taught to seventh and eighth graders, who were also located here. Assemblies were held every week, with the junior high and senior high alternating weeks.

Margaret Smith, part of the first group of students, suggested "Res, Non Verba" as the school motto. The Latin phrase translates into "Deeds, Not Words" and is still the school motto.

The school has undergone renovations and additions. In 1980 a gymnasium was built adjacent to the original facility. The entire building underwent a major renovation in 1991–92 with the additions of a music wing, greenhouse, and art rooms. Part of the renovation was a courtyard with its multiple features including classrooms, a playground, and patio with picnic tables.
