Tennessee Legislature 
Herron was first elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives in 1986 to fill Governor Ned McWherter's seat.

Herron did not seek re-election in 2012.

2010 U.S. Congressional campaign 

In April 2009, Herron announced that he would be running for Governor of Tennessee in the Democratic primary, but in December 2009, he declared as a candidate for  when Congressman John S. Tanner announced his retirement. Herron quickly became the frontrunner and other strong contenders did not challenge him.  He was easily victorious in the August 2010 primary.

Herron faced Republican nominee Stephen Fincher, Tea Party candidate Donn Janes, who earlier dropped out of the Republican primary, and Independent Mark J. Rawles.  Despite raising over $2 million, a record amount for a Tennessee Democratic congressional candidate, Herron lost to Fincher in November in the massive Republican wave that swept through Tennessee and the nation.

Herron did not have to give up his state senate seat to run in the congressional race; Tennessee state senators serve staggered four-year terms.

Endorsements
In the congressional race, Herron was endorsed by the state's two largest newspapers, the Memphis Commercial Appeal and the Nashville Tennessean, as well as every other endorsing newspaper, a total of at least eight newspapers.

Chairmanship of the Tennessee Democratic Party
Herron was elected in 2013 as Tennessee Democratic Party Chairman.

His work as chairman was categorized as successful, despite challenging times with a divided State Executive Committee and Democratic superminorities in the Tennessee General Assembly.

Herron set records in Jackson Day fundraising and spoke out with unprecedented numbers of op-ed essays in major newspapers in the state. In the summer of 2014, he led a quiet but effective effort to save the Democratic justices on the Tennessee Supreme Court, successfully raising unprecedented funds for retaining the court. In the fall, he also led the party to victories in five of their seven targeted races in 2014 despite Republican advantages in numbers of office holders, funding, and outside groups weighing in heavily in state races.

In January 2015, Democratic activist and former candidate for State Senate Mary Mancini was elected to succeed Herron.

Personal life
Herron and his wife have three sons: John, Rick, and Ben. The couple lived in Dresden, Tennessee.

On July 1, 2023, Herron was injured in a jet ski accident on Kentucky Lake. He died at Vanderbilt University Medical Center on July 9, at the age of 69.
