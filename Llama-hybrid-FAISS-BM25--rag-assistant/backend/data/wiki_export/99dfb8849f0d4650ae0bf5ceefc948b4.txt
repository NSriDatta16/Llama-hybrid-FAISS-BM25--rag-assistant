Iswarati Center for Badminton Learning (ICBL) is a school of Badminton, opened by famous former three-times Indian National Badminton Champion and two-times Olympian, Mr. Dipankar Bhattacharjee in Guwahati, Assam, India. The training center is specially created to train the youths of Assam and North-Eastern India. ICBL is a private non-profit association and created by Dipankar himself in 2004.

It is started as an association in 2004 at Guwahati with the support of few interested people morally backing Dipankar in his efforts.

Dipankar has unsuccessfully approached many sponsors like the big businesses in the area. But he is pursuing support from sponsors in the future to make this effort successful.

Dipankar takes care of coaching the students at a regular basis. The players are promised with bright future in the national and international badminton arena.

Dipankar feels that this Academy for Badminton learning is a very important step for the future of Badminton in Assam, North-East India, and India as a whole. There are ongoing efforts by authorities of Badminton like International Badminton Federation (IBF) to popularize badminton and draw more sponsors and fans into it. Dipankar also believes in these efforts and he is doing his part to contribute to the future success of making Badminton a much more entertaining and popular sports. He is constantly approaching potential sponsors in Assam and N.E. India as well as from other neighbouring states. He is optimistic that there will be growing attention towards Badminton and more interest from the big companies who already advertise their brand through other sports like Cricket and Tennis in India.

He has been one of the first member at BPL Prakash Padukone Academy in Bangalore and had
the fortune of training with Prakash. His association with Prakash has given him more hopes in venturing out in popularising Badminton and training talented youths of the oft-neglected region of Assam and the North-East India.
