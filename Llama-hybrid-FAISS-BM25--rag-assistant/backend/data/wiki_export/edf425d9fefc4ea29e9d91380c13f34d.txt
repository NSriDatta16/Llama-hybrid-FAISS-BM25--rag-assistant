Route description 

VT 155 begins at an intersection with VT 100 in the Windsor County town of Weston. Running along the eastern edge of Green Mountain National Forest, VT 155 runs northwest along the West River. A two-lane mountain road, the route runs straight into the forest, making a junction with the dead-ending Forest Highway 299 (FFH 299). At FFH–299, VT 155 turns northeast and crosses into Rutland County. Now in the town of Mount Holly, the route continues along the forest border, turning northwest as Weston Road.

VT 155 winds along the border northwestward for several miles, paralleling the nearby Mill River. Bypassing the hamlet of Belmont, the route runs up the forest line, turning more towards the north. Before the junction with Fowler Brook Road, VT 155 turns northwest again, crossing railroad tracks and into the town of Wallingford. Now in the hamlet of East Wallingford, VT 155 reaches the Hubbardton River and a junction with VT 140. At this junction, VT 155 and VT 140 become concurrent for  through East Wallingford.  

At the junction with Village Street, VT 155 turns off of VT 140, running north for one block into a junction with VT 103. This junction marks the northern terminus of VT 155.
