Ezzaki Badou (; born 2 April 1959), nicknamed Zaki, is a Moroccan football coach and former professional player who played as a goalkeeper. He manages Sudan.

Playing career
Born in Sidi Kacem, Zaki represented AS Salé, Wydad AC, RCD Mallorca and Fath Union Sport during a 17-year professional career. With Mallorca, for which he signed in 1986 after being named by France Football as African Footballer of the Year, he won promotion to La Liga in 1989 while winning the Ricardo Zamora Trophy.

Zaki played for the Morocco national team in the 1986 FIFA World Cup and four Africa Cup of Nations. In the former tournament, held in Mexico, he helped his country to the round-of-16; additionally, the recipient of 76 full caps competed in the 1984 Summer Olympics.

In 2006, Zaki was selected by the Confederation of African Football as one of the best 200 African footballers of the last 50 years.

Coaching career
Zaki retired in 1993 at the age of 34, immediately becoming a manager. In 2002, after coaching a host of clubs, including former sides FUS and WAC, he was appointed at the helm of Morocco, leaving his post after three years and returning in May 2014. He managed to create a young group and qualify the national team for the African Cup then organized in Tunisia in 2004 without the slightest defeat. During this CAN, Morocco was far from favorite, however, from the first match, the Atlas Lions gave a hunch that the team will go far in the competition. Zaki's protégés reach the final by losing to Tunisia 2 goals to 1. He left by mutual consent in February 2016.

Zaki subsequently returned to club duties, going on to be in charge of several sides.

On 9 July 2017, Zaki was named as the coach of IR Tanger.

On 12 March 2023, he was named as coach of Sudan, with his salary being paid by the Saudi Arabian FA as part of a co-operation agreement. In managing his first game for Sudan, he managed to claim a 1-0 victory against Gabon in the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualification.
