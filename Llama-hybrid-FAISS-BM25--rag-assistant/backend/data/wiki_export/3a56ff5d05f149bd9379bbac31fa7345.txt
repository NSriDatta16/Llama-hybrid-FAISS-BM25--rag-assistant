Early life and education 
James P. O'Shaughnessy was born and raised in Saint Paul, Minnesota, where he attended Saint Thomas Academy as a youth. His fascination with the stock market began at an early age when he started to manually track characteristics common to the 30 companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average stock index. After studying international economics and business diplomacy at the School of Foreign Service of Georgetown University, O'Shaughnessy graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in economics from the University of Minnesota in 1986.

O'Shaughnessy continued to apply his research of the stock market, and in 1994, his first book, Invest Like the Best, was published, followed by the first edition of What Works on Wall Street in 1997, How to Retire Rich in 1998, and Predicting the Markets of Tomorrow in 2006.

Career

Mutual Funds 
O'Shaughnessy started his own mutual funds under the names Cornerstone Growth and Cornerstone Value in 1996.

In 1997, the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) launched the RBC O'Shaughnessy mutual funds for Canadian investors. Currently, there are seven mutual funds in the RBC O'Shaughnessy funds family.

O'Shaughnessy Capital Management 
After graduating, O'Shaughnessy worked for a family-owned venture capital firm. During this time, his interest in quantitative research was recognized by a colleague who was on the board of directors with O'Shaughnessy at the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra. The colleague suggested that O'Shaughnessy's research might be well suited for pension plan management. In 1988, O'Shaughnessy started O'Shaughnessy Capital Management, Inc. and began consulting large pension funds and foundations.

Netfolio 
In 1999, O'Shaughnessy started Netfolio, The Personal Fund Company, to offer individual investors the ability to build their own diversified portfolio over the internet. The company was closed in 2001. As part of Netfolio's concentration on "personal funds", O'Shaughnessy Capital Management sold its mutual fund family to Hennessy Advisors in June 2000.

Bear Stearns Asset Management 
In 2001, O'Shaughnessy and his team from O'Shaughnessy Capital Management moved to Bear Stearns Asset Management (BSAM), where O'Shaughnessy served as a Senior Managing Director and the executive director of Systematic Equity.

O'Shaughnessy Asset Management 
In 2007, O'Shaughnessy reached an agreement with Bear Stearns to spin his Systematic team out of BSAM to form O'Shaughnessy Asset Management, LLC.  O'Shaughnessy Asset Management was acquired by Franklin Templeton in 2021. O'Shaughnessy later announced that he'd retire at the end of 2022.
