Arniston Rangers Football Club are a Scottish football club, based in the town of Gorebridge. They play in the East of Scotland Football League (Second Division), having moved from the SJFA East Region Premier League in 2018. Nicknamed "Arni", they were formed in 1878 and presently play their home games at Newbyres Park, which has room for 1,000 spectators. They wear maroon strips (uniforms). Towards the end of the 2022/23 season Arni got young ultras providing a great atmosphere at Newbyres Park. They also achieved promotion to the EOSFL First Division in the 2022/23 Season. Ground problems at Newbyres meant that some home games during the 2008–09 season were played at Musselburgh.
