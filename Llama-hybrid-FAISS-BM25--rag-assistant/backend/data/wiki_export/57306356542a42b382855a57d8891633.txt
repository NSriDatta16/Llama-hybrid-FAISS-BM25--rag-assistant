Ingleside Plantation was a forced-labor farm of  located in extreme northeast Leon County, Florida and established by Robert W. Alston and his family. Eventually, the property was acquired by Joel C. Blake. In 1860, Blake was enslaving 116 people to work his land, which was mostly devoted to producing cotton as a cash crop.

Blake, who was 29 years old in 1860, married Laura Parish, some relation to his mother. He founded Ingleside Plantation by purchasing land to the east of Blakely Plantation. Blake later joined the Confederate States Army and was killed on July 2, 1863, at the Battle of Gettysburg.

Ingleside would later become Ring Oak Plantation, a private hunting plantation co-owned by David Sinton Ingalls and Robert Livingston Ireland, Jr.

Location
Ingleside was bounded on the east by the shores of Lake Miccosukee and would have been bound on the west by Blake's mother's Blakely Plantation. Today, the land is County Road 59 (Veterans Memorial Drive). Ingleside's northern boundary would now be Cypress Landing Road and to the south it would have bounded by the streets of Leland Circle and Indigo Lane.
