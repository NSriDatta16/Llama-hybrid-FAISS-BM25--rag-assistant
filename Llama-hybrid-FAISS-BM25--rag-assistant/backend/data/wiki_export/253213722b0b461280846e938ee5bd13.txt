Construction of new school building in 2012

The school was placed on warning status by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC) in 2006. In 2010 the town voted to build a new high school next to the old one to address structural issues leading to the institution of this warning status.

The new school cost $68 million, a majority funding athletic facilities, and opened in August 2012. The gymnasium seats 1,225 fans, featuring one main basketball court and three intermediate courts that can be separated for tournament or recreational league use. The gym is used for all future TMHS graduations. The auditorium/theater features seating for 690 and the stage has a backstage area for work on theatrical productions. Some of the more distinguishing characteristics of the complex include airport style restrooms for students, shared prep areas behind science and art classrooms, a TV studio, and two large rooms that can accommodate three or four classes meeting together.  The entire complex features copious amounts of glass for maximum natural lighting.  This ties in with numerous green features that add to the energy efficiency of the school and guarantee an additional reimbursement from the state.  Freshman Orientation was on August 27, 2012, and the first official day of school in the new building was on August 28, 2012.  As of September 2012, the new high school was finally complete, though the exterior features including the parking lot and track and field were delayed for a while longer.  Demolition for the old high school began in mid-August 2012 and finished well into 2013.
