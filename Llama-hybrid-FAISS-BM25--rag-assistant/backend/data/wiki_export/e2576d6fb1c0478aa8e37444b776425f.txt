It was established in 1996, with the preamble stating:

Seafarers' Hours of Work and the Manning of Ships Convention and COVID-19 
Following the outbreak of COVID-19, the International Labor Organization (ILO), in conjunction with the Seafarers' Hours of Work and the Manning of Ships Convention, called on governments to take all possible measures to protect seafarers and to take steps to reduce the risk of COVID-19 virus infection. The ILO Memorandum was intended to coordinate the vision of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
A joint statement issued by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the International Labor Organization (ILO) on May 22, 2020, emphasized the call for key worker status for seafarers. It relieves crews of travel restrictions and make it easier for them to join or leave the ships.
