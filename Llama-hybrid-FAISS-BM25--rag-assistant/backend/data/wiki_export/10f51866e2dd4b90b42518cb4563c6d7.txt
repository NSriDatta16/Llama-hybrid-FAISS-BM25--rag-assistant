Katama Airpark  is a public airport in the Katama section of Edgartown, Massachusetts, in Dukes County on the island of Martha's Vineyard. The airport, owned by the Town of Edgartown, has three runways, averages 22 takeoffs and landings per day, and has one aircraft based on its field.

Katama is one of three airports on the island. The main airport Martha's Vineyard Airport (MVY) is the only airport with commercial service, and handles the majority of the island's general aviation traffic as well. The third airport is the smaller Trade Wind Airport, a grass airfield in Oak Bluffs.

History
During World War II, Martha's Vineyard Airport functioned both as an outer defense and a training facility for gunnery and pilots. In addition to the main airport there was a small airfield at Katama near a gunnery practice area at the beach. Following World War II this airport was purchased by Steven Gentle, who ran the Katama Airpark until the 1980s when it was purchased with state conservation funds (as this airfield has five endangered plant or animal species).

Facilities
The airport is managed by the town of Edgartown. During the season (roughly May 31 to Labor Day), there are biplane and glider rides available, as well as flight instruction in four different aircraft.

There is a restaurant located adjacent to the airfield, currently named "Katama Kitchen." 

The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute has a small data monitoring building adjacent to the hangar. It monitors wave action, beach erosion, and offshore wave action. It is not open to the public.

Accidents 
On June 22, 2005, a Cessna Skyhawk stalled and crashed during a landing attempt, injuring the pilot and two passengers. This crash was the subject of a lengthy trial which concluded in 2012 with Cessna awarding a settlement of $1.7 million (2012 USD) to the injured party. The plaintiffs alleged that faulty cockpit seat rails had caused the pilot to unexpectedly slide backward and loose control of the plane while attempting to abort a landing.

On August 3, 2015, a Piper Cherokee was damaged when it rotated forward onto its nose during a rough landing. No passengers were harmed during this incident.
