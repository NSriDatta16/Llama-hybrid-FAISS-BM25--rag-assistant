Parnasree Pally is an upscale locality of Behala in southern Kolkata (Calcutta), India. It was included in the Kolkata Municipal Corporation in 1985. Translated to English, the name means "beauty of the leaves." It was earlier known as Halderbagan (The Halders were probably the priests of the Sabarna Roy Chowdhury family). The name Parnasree (Beauty of the Leaves) was coined by Late Asoke Ratan Mazumder when he became a member of the co-operative society formed for the rehabilitation of Refugees during the Partition of India in 1947.

Formation of Parnasree Palli

In 1941 as war preparation began in India for a Japanese invasion, a land locally known as Halder Bagan was acquired by the then government for building an air strip. One "Anti Air Craft" Gun was also installed  there. After the war was over, this land was taken over by Central Government and handed over partly to Calcutta Port Trust and partly to the local government. 
After Independence, Dr. B.C.Roy (Bidhan Chandra Roy - the first Chief Minister of West Bengal) ordered Land and Land Revenue to disburse the land usefully by the side of present Taratola Road there was a low marshy land which was filled by a company who were  entrusted to fill Salt Lake later. As a work sample, they filled up that low-lying area. 
Now coming back to the Parnasree episode â€“ For East Bengal refugees, the Bengal Government announced a cooperative society to be set up so as to develop a habitable planned township under guidance of municipal norms of South Suburban Municipality . Land and Land Revenue department set up a steering committee headed by Mr. Amal Home of Hindusthan Insurance Company (later  L I C I )as Chairman, Mr. Kshitindra  Mohan Sen, Ex-Director of Customs, Mr. Mahendra Kumar De, Dr. Rukmini Dutta Roy, Educationist, Mr. M. L. Dhar, Lawyer, Mr. Nikhil Adhikari of United Bank of India. The chamber of Mr. M.L.Dhar at Dover Lane was the first office of this cooperative society in September 1948. The scenario was- New Alipore township with large plots having modern facilities like sewerage, water connection, metal road, electrified streets etc. were  being promoted by Hindusthan. Many employees of Hindusthan missed the chance of getting a plot in New Alipore for its high price . 
Now many Hindusthan employees along with their friends, rushed to the office of the new project office and enquired about the modus operandi of the project. At that point, the name of the co-operative was suggested by  Mr. Asoke Ratan Mazumder as PARNASREE PALLY SAMABAY  SAMITI and suggestion was accepted by voice vote. Immediately Mr. Dhar arranged for the registration with that name. 
In October 1948 share selling of co-operative started. It was decided that the share holding  pattern will be Rs.100/- per person, with a sub clause that a person can pay Rs.50/- and balance Rs. 50/- within six calendar months. 
The survey was conducted by Mr. Robin Routh and site plan was planned . Low-lying areas were filled up by digging ponds. The developed lands were gradually handed over to PARNASREE PALLY SAMABAY SAMITI and distributed to the share holders with Rs. 500/-for municipal mutation. Many deed of conveyance with Govt of West Bengal were done at stipulated price later.
