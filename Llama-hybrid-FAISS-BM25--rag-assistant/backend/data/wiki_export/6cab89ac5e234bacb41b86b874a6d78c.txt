Marco Werner (born April 27, 1966 in Dortmund) is a professional racer from Germany. He was the eighth driver to complete the informal triple crown in endurance racing.

In his early career, Werner finished runner-up in the Formula Opel Euroseries in 1989 and runner-up in the German F3 series in 1991 behind Tom Kristensen.

Having failed to graduate to Formula One, Werner switched to sports car racing and touring car racing. Werner was a regular driver in the STW and Porsche Supercup during the 1990s, but he found more success in the 24 Hours of Daytona, which he won in 1995 in a Kremer-Porsche.

In 2001 he joined Audi Sport Team Joest, becoming a regular driver in the American Le Mans Series. Werner won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 2005 with an Audi R8, and in 2006 and 2007 with an Audi R10.

In 2008, he co-drove the Audi R10 in the American Le Mans Series with Lucas Luhr to six overall victories and eight class wins, taking the LMP1 drivers title.

After his last 24 Hours of Le Mans participation in 2010, Werner became a regular participant in historic racing, winning the 2022 Historic Grand Prix of Monaco Série G race(for 3-litre Formula One cars from 1981 to 1985), in a Lotus 87B.
