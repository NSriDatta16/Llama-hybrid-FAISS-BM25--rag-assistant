An archival document established a "Chlorydormes" in the Jersey Islands, near the village of St-John. In addition, the research of Georges Le Feuvre demonstrates the contribution of the Jersyais in the primary population of the Gaspé area, including Cloridorme. This research indicates in particular that Lewis Gibaut, friend of Georges Godfray of Grand-Étang, a neighboring village of Cloridorme, and who worked for William Hyman and Sons, returned to die in Chlorydormes, St-John, in Jersey. A map of 1755 shows the plural form "Les Cloridormes", which had changed to "Les Chlorydormes" by the 19th century and remained in use until the early 20th century.  Cloridorme was created by a community of fishermen from Jersey Islands.  The chlorydormes were part of the city of St-John on Jersey Islands as mentioned in this archival document.
