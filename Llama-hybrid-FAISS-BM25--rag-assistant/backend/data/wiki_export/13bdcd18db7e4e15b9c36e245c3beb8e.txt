Swaythling railway station is on the South West Main Line on the northern edge of Southampton in Hampshire, England, serving the area of Swaythling. It is  down the line from .

History
  
Swaythling station was initially constructed in 1883 in an elaborate Neo-Flemish style and is a grade II listed building.   The left side has a Flemish gable with central pediment and ball finials and includes a date tablet. The station building was set back to the east of the down platform - and connected to the platform canopy structure by a passageway - so that it would not have to be rebuilt in the event of the double track being widened to quadruple tracking, which was envisaged in 1883 but has never taken place.

On 19 January 1941, during the Second World War, a  bomb fell on the station, through both the roof and floor of the booking office. The bomb did not explode, but the impact killed the leading porter's dog (who was asleep in a cupboard) and scattered burning coals from the hearth, causing a fire. The fire led officials to believe the bomb had exploded and the station was declared safe for reoccupation the next day, until the landlord of the nearby Mason's Arms pub raised the alarm since he had not heard the bomb explode. The bomb was then dug up and made safe.

Train services
Currently operated by South Western Railway, it is served by the hourly Salisbury to Romsey via Southampton and Eastleigh service.  There are additional services at peak times to Basingstoke, Winchester, London Waterloo, Southampton and Brockenhurst.

Facilities
Step-free access is available only to the down platform (usually for trains to Salisbury via Southampton Central and Romsey). This platform has the ticket office (open weekday mornings only), a ticket vending machine and step-free access to a footbridge crossing the railway. The up platform contains steps to the footbridge and steps down to Stoneham Way.
