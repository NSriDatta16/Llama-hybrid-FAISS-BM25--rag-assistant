340 on the Park is a residential tower in the Lakeshore East development of the neighborhood of New Eastside/ East Loop Chicago  completed in 2007. The building was   the tallest all-residential building in Chicago until the completion of One Museum Park.

The architectural firm Solomon Cordwell Buenz designed the tower and it was built by Magellan Development. The structural engineering firm Magnusson Klemencic Associates designed the building using prestressed concrete in order increase the floor-to-ceiling heights.  James McHugh Construction Co installed post-tensioning tendons supplied by Amsysco Inc.

340 on the Park is set flush next to Randolph Street, allowing unobstructed views of Millennium Park, Grant Park, The Park at Lakeshore East and Lake Michigan. The tower's design also allows for nearby buildings to maintain some views of the park.

340 on the Park was the first residential tower in the Midwestern United States to achieve Silver LEED certification for its "green" design, including a large winter garden for residents. Additional benefits include a connection to the Chicago Pedway system, low-flow water fixtures for both residential and public spaces, and energy-efficient fixtures such as lights and mechanical equipment.

The north side of the building is contoured so that views from The Buckingham next to the building are not interfered with.
