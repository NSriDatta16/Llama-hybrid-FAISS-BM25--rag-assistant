Paul Schneider (August 4, 1923 – October 13, 2008) was an American screenwriter who worked in television and film between the 1950s and the 1980s.

Star Trek

Schneider is probably best remembered for two episodes of the original Star Trek series: "Balance of Terror" and "The Squire of Gothos". The first of these introduced the Romulans – which became one of the main alien races in the Star Trek universe. The second episode introduces a "Q"-like lifeform which terrorizes the crew.  He also wrote the episode "The Terratin Incident" for the animated Star Trek series.

Filmography 

Schneider wrote for several other films and television series, including Mr. Magoo, Bonanza, Ironside, The Six Million Dollar Man and Buck Rogers in the 25th Century.
