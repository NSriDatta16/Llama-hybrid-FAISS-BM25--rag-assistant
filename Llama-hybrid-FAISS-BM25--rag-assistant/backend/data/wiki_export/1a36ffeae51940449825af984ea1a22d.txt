Max Taut (15 May 1884 – 26 February 1967) was a German architect of Prussian Lithuanian heritage.

Biography 
Max Taut was born in Königsberg, the younger brother of Bruno Taut. He, his brother and Franz Hoffman formed Taut & Hoffman, an architecture firm in Berlin, In the 1920s, Max Taut was particularly known for his office buildings for trade unions. Between 1922 and 1925, he built one house a year on Hiddensee island, each one very different from the others.

The Deutscher Buchdrucker building (1924–1926) on Dudenstraße in Berlin and the consumer cooperatives' department store (1930–1933) on Oranienplatz are two of his most important buildings and are on the Berlin list of heritage sites.

He was a member of the Glass Chain and the Novembergruppe. He was also a member of the avant garde architectural society, Zehnerring, which included Mies van der Rohe, Walter Gropius and Erich Mendelsohn. His primary importance exists in the development of framed buildings, which showed the construction of the building and symbolized a new, democratic openness in architecture.

After the Second World War, he and Wilhelm Büning founded a new architecture school at the Berlin University of the Arts. His postwar work includes the Reutersiedlung (1948–1952) in Bonn and Ludwig Georgs Gymnasium (1951–1955) in Darmstadt.
 
Taut was buried at the Choriner monastery cemetery.
