Everytime We Touch is the first album by German Eurodance trio Cascada (consisting of DJ Manian, Natalie Horler and Yanou). It was released on 21 February 2006. Recording sessions for the album took place from Autumn 2004 through January 2006, most of which was recorded after the third single from the album "Everytime We Touch" rose to popularity; the final recording session was completed in three weeks. The entire album was produced by Yanou and DJ Manian, containing heavily of up-tempo Eurodance tracks, many of which are covers of hit songs from the 1980s and 1990s of the synthpop, Eurodance, and rock genres. Musically, the album is composed of dance tracks with thick Euro synths, trance beats that clock in at over 140 beats per minute and Europop lyrics. Lyrically, the album is composed of songs about love and dance floor euphoria.

Critical reception of the album has been mixed, with many critics disliking the repetitive beats and what they saw as filler. Most critics did admire, however, its chart success for a dance album in the tough US music market. The album has sold about 2 million copies worldwide. There was a total of seven singles released from the album. "Miracle" and "Everytime We Touch" were released in America and were the only singles that received gold and platinum certifications. Along with "Truly, Madly, Deeply", these singles attained notable chart success internationally, peaking in the top ten in countries like the United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden. "A Neverending Dream" and "How Do You Do!" achieved minor chart success in Ireland, the United Kingdom and Austria respectively.

Critical reception 

Sharon Mawer from Allmusic gave the album a mixed review and said the album's songs were for "dancing to" in a "club with lights flashing and people all around" but said that "after an hour of the same repetitive beat, one's senses can become a little jaded." Dom Passantino from Stylus Magazine gave the album a C+ and said the album had "a lot of filler" and called "Everytime We Touch" unoriginal. Ken Barnes of USA Today, however, awarded the album 3 out of 4 stars and said that "you couldn't ask for a more insanely infectious concoction."

Chart performance 
The album was accidentally released on iTunes for digital download on 11 February 2006, ten days before its scheduled release, in what was said to be a computer error. The album entered the Billboard 200 at number 67, selling over 17,000 copies in its first week. It has gone on to sell over 100,000 copies in the US.

In the United Kingdom, the album entered the charts at #6. It then went on to peak at #2. It spent 28 weeks in the UK Albums Top 75, and 35 weeks in the Ireland Albums Top 75 (where it peaked at #1). The album went on to sell over 600,000 copies in the UK, achieving Platinum Certification.
