History of KNUS
KNUS came on the air as KMYR in May 1941 on 1340 kHz. It moved to 710 kHz in April 1956. When it was KBTR, it had a news partnership with KBTV (now KUSA-TV); this ended sometime in the mid-1980s. From the 1970s to the late 1980s, it was owned by Mullins Broadcasting. In the late 1980s, the station changed its name to KBXG when it was bought by a Boulder coal company. In the 1990s, the station was the home of Ken Hamblin, Gary Tessler, Alan Dumas, Carol McKinley, Nia Bender, Pierre Wolfe, Mason Lewis, Warren Byrne, Gabby Gourmet, Ron Krieter, and many others.  At one point in 1991, it had Peter Boyles 5:00 am till 9:00 am, Gary Tessler 9:00 till 1:00. Ken Hamblin 1:00 till 4:00, Jim Turner 4:00 till 8:00 and Jann Scott 8:00 till Midnight. It broadcast from the 23rd floor studios of the Tabor Center.

710 AM would simulcast then-sister KBPI from 1988 to 1989.

In 1993, KNUS was Denver's first station to carry The Rush Limbaugh Show.  When Limbaugh came to Fort Collins for an appearance, thousands of people showed up. Jann Scott also did a live show from Fort Collins where some negative comments were made about Rush. Limbaugh heard the show from his hotel room and came over. Limbaugh and Scott bantered back and forth and then ended up telling jokes and talking to the crowd for two hours.

Chuck and Julie Show controversy

On December 18, 2019 the Chuck & Julie show was cancelled after co-host Chuck Bonniwell stated, when introducing a segment discussing the impeachment of Donald Trump, "You know, you wish for a nice school shooting to interrupt the nonstop impeachment coverage.  " This happened one week after another KNUS host, Kirk Widlund denied allegations that he had posted white-supremacist memes online.
