History
In 1888, nurserymen George Ellwanger and Patrick Barry endowed the Rochester community with  of gently rolling hills that are now known as Highland Park. It was noted as one of the nation's first municipal arboretums. Renowned park designer Frederick Law Olmsted was responsible for final development of Highland Park. The park's lilac collection was started by horticulturist John Dunbar in 1892 with 20 varieties, some of which were descendants of slips of native Balkan Mountain flowers that were carried to the new world by early colonists. Today, over 500 varieties of lilacs cover 22 of Highland Park's .

The inspiration for the festival dates to 1898 when 3,000 people came to the park one Sunday in May to see the lilacs. Ten years later, 25,000 people came to the first organized lilac festival. Since then the number of viewers has grown to over 500,000 and the festival is held over the course of ten days.

With the 2020 edition cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 123rd was deferred to 2021. The schedule was adjusted from the ten day format to three weekends in 2021 and 2022, and is planned to return to its original format in 2023, running May 12 to May 21st.
