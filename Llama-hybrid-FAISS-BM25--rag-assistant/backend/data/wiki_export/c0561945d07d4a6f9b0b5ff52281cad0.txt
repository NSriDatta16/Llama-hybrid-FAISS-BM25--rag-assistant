If I Could Be... is the fifth and most recent album by Meredith Brooks, released in 2007. It is an album of children's music which Brooks states she was inspired to write and record after the birth of her son.

Background
Brooks gave birth to her son in 2004, which inspired her to produce a children's music album. She commented: "It's funny how trying to be the best mom I can be and feeling so happy about it has produced the most inspired music of my whole career". Brooks began writing for the album on the night of her son's birth and she gauged his reactions to get approval for the songs.

Promotion
On March 25, 2006, Brooks debuted songs from the album at the Wisteria Music Festival, an event which promotes music and sound for children and adults. In December 2007, Brooks performed several songs from the album at Still Thankful, Still Giving, a fundraising event in promotion of adoption.
