Baffins is an administrative district of Portsmouth, England, located on the eastern side of Portsea Island. The district is mainly composed of 1930s housing. The population of the Baffins ward at the 2011 Census was 15,121.

Before the area became developed for housing, it had been occupied by a farm of the same name. This farm (known as Bavins Farm) had a history stretching back to the 12th century. The only surviving remnant of the rural past is Baffins Pond and the adjoining Tangier Field - a large open space between Baffins Pond and Portsmouth College at the eastern end of the field.

Local attractions: Baffins Pond and Tangier Field
Baffins Pond and Tangier Field is 182,000 square metres (18.2 hectares). The large natural pond is a habitat for  ducks, geese, swans and other wild fowl. It is managed as a wildlife refuge and is popular with people of all ages. In 2014 Baffins Pond again received a Green Flag award.

There is also a play area at Baffins Pond with equipment for children of all ages as well as a ball-court with basketball and 5-a-side goals.

To the east of the pond area is Tangier Field, a large grassed open space that also serves as a valuable habitat for the brent goose or brant goose, an internationally important protected species, which visits the Solent area in the winter months.  There is no public access to the fenced enclosure between 1 October to 31 March for the time the birds are resident, although most of the area is open to the public at all times.
