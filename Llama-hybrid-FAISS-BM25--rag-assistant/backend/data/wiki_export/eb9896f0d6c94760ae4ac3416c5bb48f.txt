Rød pølse (, "red sausage") is a type of brightly red, boiled pork sausage very common in Denmark. Since hot dog stands are ubiquitous in Denmark, some people regard røde pølser as one of the national dishes. They are made of the Vienna type and the skin is colored with a traditional red dye (carmine).

Traditional preparation 
Rød pølse are to be heated in hot water and are commonly served with remoulade, mustard or ketchup, fried onions and pickled sliced cucumber (gherkin). A common legend says that it was once ordered that day-old sausages be dyed as a means of warning. Another interpretation is that starting in the 1920s, vendors used red dye to disguise the diminished quality of older sausages.

Other Scandinavian sausages 
Scandinavian sausages are usually made of 60–80% finely ground pork, spiced with pepper, nutmeg, allspice or similar sweet spices (ground mustard seed, onions and sugar may also be added). Water, lard, pork rind, potato starch flour and soybean or milk protein are often added as fillers. Nearly all commercially available sausages are industrially precooked to be subsequently fried or heated in boiling water.

In Norway, sausages are most often served in white buns, or in a traditional flat bread. The sausages are grilled or warmed in hot water, and they are normally served with ketchup or mustard. An alternative condiment to the sausages may be mashed potatoes.

In Iceland, the sausages may contain mutton, giving them a distinct taste.
