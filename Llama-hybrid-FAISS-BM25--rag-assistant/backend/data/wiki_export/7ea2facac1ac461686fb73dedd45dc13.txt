Danzey is a railway station which serves the small village of Danzey Green, and the larger but slightly more distant village of Tanworth-in-Arden in Warwickshire, England.

Situated on the North Warwickshire Line, the station was opened by the Great Western Railway in 1908 along with the line, and was originally known as Danzey for Tanworth. It is a few minutes walk from Danzey Green, and around one mile from Tanworth-in-Arden.

Until the May 2023 timetable change Danzey was a request stop, meaning passengers wishing to board a train here needed to signal to the driver their intent to board; those wishing to alight needing to inform the train conductor.
