Velvet Empire was a Canadian pop music group that was formed through the second edition of the Global TV show Popstars, entitled "Boy Meets Girl". The group was formed in Spring 2002. They recorded their first and only album in Toronto at Metalworks Recording Studio.

The group were winners of a 10-month competition, intended to form a pop group comprising both males and females. Its members were Alex Price, Justin Humes, Janelle Belgrave, Lacey Block and Ryan Hamilton. The new group called itself Velvet Empire and released an album, Velvet Empire, and single, "Frontin' On Me", in 2002. Despite the single receiving much radio and video play, the album's sales were not as expected. As a result, the group disbanded by 2003.
