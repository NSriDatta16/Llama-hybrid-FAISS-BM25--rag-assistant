Kam Tong (December 18, 1906 – November 8, 1969) was a Chinese-American actor. He was best known for his role as Hey Boy on the CBS television series Have Gun – Will Travel and as Dr. Li in the film version of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical Flower Drum Song. Curiously, though appearing as a series regular on Have Gun – Will Travel, Kam was also a regular on the short run CBS-TV series Mr. Garlund in 1960. He appeared in many movies, often as an uncredited Chinese, Japanese, or Filipino character. He appeared in many television shows, including The Man from U.N.C.L.E., The Big Valley, The Time Tunnel, The Final War of Olly Winter, and I Spy.

After serving in World War II in an OSS intelligence unit, he became involved in efforts to raise awareness over gun violence. He also owned and operated a restaurant called Shanghai Lil's in San Francisco.
