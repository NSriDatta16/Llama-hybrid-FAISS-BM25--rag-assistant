Peekskill High School, established in 1929, is located at 1072 Elm Street in Peekskill, New York, United States. It educates most of the district's ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth graders. The school's current principal is Dr. Jenna Ferris. Peekskill students prepare for the New York State Regents Exams in science, language, mathematics, history and English. In addition to the Regents curriculum, the high school also offers Advanced Placement courses, which prepare students to take the AP Exams offered by the College Board in early May. A new course at the school as of the 2007–2008 school year is the three-year Authentic Science Research program.  Several college courses are also offered.

The school replaced the Peekskill High School at 212 Ringgold Street (1929–1972). Prior to 1929, Drum Hill School served as the high school, and is now a senior living community. The current school is located on the former grounds of the original Peekskill Military Academy, which closed in 1968.

Scandal
In January 2013, a scandal was discovered in the guidance department of Peekskill High School.  Four counselors were reassigned as an investigation into the falsifying of transcripts took place.  It was reported that 34 students had been given credits they didn't deserve.  Most were given credit for a "co-op" work experience program that the district had discontinued years earlier.  Superintendent James Willis said in a letter to parents, "The Board of Education and I, along with my administrative team, are absolutely appalled by what we have discovered. This won't be tolerated. Moving forward, I am organizing an internal protocols team to assess the current transcript review processes and to make 
recommendations to ensure something like this can never happen again."  Some students might have to take summer classes or an extra semester in order to graduate on time.

School song
The words of the school song were written in 1932 by Edwin Steckel, music teacher and bandmaster.
