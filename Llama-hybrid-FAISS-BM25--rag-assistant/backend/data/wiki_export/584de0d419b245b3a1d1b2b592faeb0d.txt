Daya Singh ( ; born Daya Ram; 1661–1708) was one of the Panj Pyare, the first five Sikhs to be initiated into the Khalsa order in 17th-century India.

Biography 
Daya Singh reunited with and accompanied the Guru in the Malwa region in the aftermath of the Second Battle of Chamkaur. He, alongside Bhai Dharam Singh, were the two Sikhs entrusted with delivering the Guru's Zafarnama letter to Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. They were dispatched from either Kangar village, Bathinda or Dina village, Moga, for this purpose. Daya Singh prepared a copy of the original Zafarnama letter, which is still extant.

He was part of a Panj Piare quintet commanded, by Guru Gobind Singh, to accompany Banda Singh Bahadur and provide him counsel on his northwards conquest of Sirhind.
