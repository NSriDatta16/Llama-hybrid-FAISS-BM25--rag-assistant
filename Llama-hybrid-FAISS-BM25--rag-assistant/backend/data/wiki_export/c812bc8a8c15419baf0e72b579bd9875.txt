This island is a hunting and fishing community. It has numerous duck hunting blinds located in the bay as well as on land and is home to the Swan Island Hunting Club, a guided duck hunting club located across the bay on Swan Island. It is a favorite winter travel destination of artist/painter Bob Timberlake, among others.

Over the years, many residents of the former Outer Banks community of Wash Woods, Virginia moved across the sound to settle on Knotts Island.  Eventually, Wash Woods became a ghost town, but descendants continue to live on Knotts Island to this day.

The island supports an elementary school, two churches, a post office, and a community park. 

There are several businesses located on the island. Knotts Island Market is the original general store on the island. Next to the market now there is a Dollar General store.  The only restaurant and bar on the island is Pearl's Bay Villa, commonly referred to as "Pearl's" in reference to the former owner. There are no lodgings except for a single Airbnb on Knotts Island Bay.

There is also a winery on the Island: Martin Farm and Winery which offers waterfront views with a wine tasting room and ‘pick-your-own’ peaches, apples, and muscadine grapes.

Knotts Island hosts a Peach Festival every year in June.
