It was part of Bishopric of Speyer till 1262, when Otto von Bruchsal gave it to Ludwig II, Electoral Palatin. It was part of Oberamt Heidelberg in 1351. It was sacked by Baden and Württemberg troops in the Mainz Diocesan Feud in 1462.

It was again sacked by Spanish troops during the Thirty Years' War in 1622 and by French troops during the Nine Years' War in 1688. French troops remained in Sandhausen until 1697. After the death of Maximilian III, Elector of Bavaria, head of the Bavarian branch of the House of Wittelsbach, Charles Theodore, County Palatine of Rhine, inherited Bavaria in 1777 and the territories of the House of Wittelsbach were united under its Palatinate branch.
