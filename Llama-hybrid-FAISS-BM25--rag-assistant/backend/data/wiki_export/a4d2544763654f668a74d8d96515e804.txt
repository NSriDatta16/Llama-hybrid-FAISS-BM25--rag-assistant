Syagrus () is a legendary ancient Greek oral poet. He is said in a traditional list to have been a rival of Homer; elsewhere it is said that he followed Orpheus and Musaeus in chronological sequence and was the first maker of an epic on the Trojan War. This would have been a forerunner of the later poems in the Epic Cycle.
