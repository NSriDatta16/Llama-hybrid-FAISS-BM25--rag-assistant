Abu 'l-Asakir Jaysh ibn Khumarawayh (; born c. 882) was the third Emir of the Tulunids in Egypt, ruling briefly in 896.

Life
His father, Khumarawayh was killed on 18 January 896 by one of his servants, who had been conducting an affair with Khumarawayh's favourite wife. When Khumarawayh learned of this, the servant feared for his life, and organized a conspiracy which claimed the Tulunid ruler's life. After Khumarawayh's death, the Tulunid territory entered a period of instability under his under-age heirs, with his son Abu 'l-Asakir Jaysh.

The eldest son of Khumarawayh, he succeeded him early in 896 at the age of fourteen. Soon afterwards he ordered the execution of his uncle Mudar ibn Ahmad ibn Tulun. After ruling for only a few months, the faqihs and qadis declared him deposed and he was killed in November 896, along with his vizier Ali ibn Ahmad al-Madhara'i. He was replaced by his younger brother Harun.
