The Porky Pig Show is an American television anthology series hosted by Porky Pig, that was composed of Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies theatrical cartoons made between 1948 and 1964. The series aired on ABC Saturday mornings from 1964 to 1967, with 26 half-hour episodes created. In rare times in the early 2000s, the show aired as part of Cartoon Network's Boomerang 1964 block (on both channels), as well rerunning on Canal 5 in Mexico in the 2010s.

Format 
Each show began with a newly animated title sequence featuring a theme song by Barbara Cameron, in which Porky welcomes his friends into a barn to dance and watch his show. Following the three cartoons featured on the program (the first one always featuring Porky, and few of which would be featured on any incarnation of The Bugs Bunny Show until the 1990s), a closing sequence played in which Porky's friends say goodbye and promise to return the following week. The opening and closing were produced by Hal Seeger Productions. Warner Bros. had shut down their own cartoon studio in the previous year.
