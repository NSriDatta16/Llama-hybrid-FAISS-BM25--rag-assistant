Work
Kamil Salman Al-Juburi writes that “in his poetry, there is a mystical flow through important experiences of homeland, prison, sea, and imprisonment, and he is rich in material and generous in phrase.” First publishing his poetry in 1968, he has seen his work featured in local and Arab newspapers and magazines and translated into other languages (including English, German, Bulgarian, Russian, Kurdish, and French). He has also translated British, Canadian, and Hindi poetry in addition to writing plays for children and adults.
