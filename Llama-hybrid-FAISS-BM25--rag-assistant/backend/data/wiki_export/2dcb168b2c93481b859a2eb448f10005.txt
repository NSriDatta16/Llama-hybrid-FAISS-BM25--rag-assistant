The Outgames are a set of series of multi-event sporting competitions for the LGBT community, which is open to all competitors regardless of sexual orientation, or qualification standard. They are sanctioned by GLISA, the Gay and Lesbian International Sport Association. They derived from the original 2006 World Outgames, when the Montreal organizing committee split with the  FGG (Federation of Gay Games) over the organization of the 2006 Gay Games, and created their own sanctioning body and series of Games, with the cooperation of the EGLSF (European Gay and Lesbian Sport Federation), the sanctioning body of the EuroGames. After the creation of the World Outgames, regional Games were created to complement the EuroGames, being the North American Outgames and the AsiaPacific Outgames. Outgames editions are accompanied by OutFest cultural festivals and OutRights LGBT rights conventions. The first convention at the 2006 World Outgames developed the Declaration of Montreal.

The Outgames are not to be confused with the Gay Games.

Gay Games and Outgames Will Not Merge 

From late in 2009 – February 28, 2016, The Federation of Gay Games (FGG) host to the Gay Games and the Gay & Lesbian International Sports Association (GLISA) host to the Outgames have held joint meetings to discuss the feasibility of unifying efforts and hosting a single athletic, cultural and human rights event for the LBGT community.  On February 28, 2016 the FGG Board of Directors voted to end further negotiations and discussions with the GLISA. The FGG official statement  regarding the decision gave hope that the two organizations could work together but stated the organizations would continue to have separate events. The organizations will not be hosting a unified event in 2022 and both organizations will sponsor separate events as originally scheduled. In the near future, the next competitions are the World Outgames which are being held in Miami in 2017. The 2016 North America Outgames will be held locally in St. Louis  and in 2018 The Gay Games will be held in Paris

The two organizations had another failed attempt to merge.  The prior attempt to hold a One Quadrennial Event (1QE) in 2018 also failed. The most recent attempt to merge the games for 2022 was formalized in May 2015 with a signed Memo of Understanding.  The FGG and GLISA created the Joint Working Group and tried to create a framework for a combined quadrennial event that would bring together the LGBT community.  Each organization has its own strengths as Cyd Zeigler   has stated. The Gay Games are more competitive and attract more athletes and the Outgames have a positive idea of unity within the community. The failure to unify the games in 2018 and 2022 was due to financial differences. The failure to fully disclose financial information created a lack of trust and increased the risk of combining the events. The event organizers know that the number of athletes and spectators needs to be significantly higher than it is currently projected in order to make the profit they desire. The Outgames have consistently lost money while a study of the Gay Games shows they had a positive financial impact on the host city in 2014.
