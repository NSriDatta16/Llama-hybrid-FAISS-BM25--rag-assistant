Grant Shelby Hubley Jr., known as Whip Hubley, is an American actor.

Early life and education
Hubley was born in New York City, the son of Julia Kaul (n√©e Paine) and Grant Shelby Hubley, an entrepreneur, oil investor, and writer. He attended the Buckley School for Boys in Upper East Side, Manhattan. As a resident of Montclair, New Jersey he attended Montclair Academy which then became part of Montclair Kimberley Academy, graduating in 1975. He is the brother of actress Season Hubley, also the former brother-in-law of Kurt Russell, and uncle of Season and Kurt's son, Boston Russell.

Career
He played the role of Mischa in the 1987 film Russkies, and Hollywood in the 1986 film Top Gun. Hubley said when he first read the script for Top Gun, he thought it would be an ensemble film but producers focused the story around Maverick when they "realized what they had with Tom." 

He later played Brian Hawkins in the Showtime miniseries More Tales of the City (1998) and its follow-up Further Tales of the City (2001). These miniseries were sequels to the PBS miniseries Tales of the City (1994), which starred Paul Gross in the role of Brian. From 1996 to 1999, Hubley had the lead role of Sheriff Tom Hampton on the revival of Flipper.

According to a 2022 interview with the Portland Press Herald, Hubley works as a manager for a construction firm in Southern Maine and acts in local theater productions.

Personal life
Hubley currently resides in South Portland, Maine, after spending over thirty years in Santa Monica, California. He is married to Dinah Minot, a former producer for Saturday Night Live and has three children, Molly, Ella and Ben. He met his wife while they were students at the University of Vermont. His wife is the sister of writer Susan Minot.
