Critics
The film was controversial because the setting closely matched that of Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum, where the Khmer Rouge in Thailand's neighbor, Cambodia, tortured prisoners.

In the film, the prison was called S-11, which closely resembles the name the Khmer Rouge used for Tuol Sleng, S-21. It also depicts piles of skulls and bones, similar to many war memorials around Cambodia.

Production
The producers of the film had in fact wanted to film inside Tuol Sleng, but were refused by the Cambodian government. The film was then made on location in Thailand.

The film outraged Cambodians and calls were made to ban all Thai products. Cambodian genocide researcher Youk Chhang has denounced the film as insensitive and a distortion of history for commercial purposes. It was another low point for Thai-Cambodian relations, which turned violent with the 2003 Phnom Penh riots.

The film's producers apologized and said they had not given the subject enough serious thought.

Release
Though it was banned in Cambodia, the film was given a wide theatrical release in Thailand and later in Singapore.
