Nkwanta South Municipal Assembly () is one of the eight districts in Oti Region, Ghana. Originally it was formerly part of the then-larger Nkwanta District on 10 March 1989, which was established by Legislative Instrument (L.I.) 1496, until the northern part of the district was split off to create Nkwanta North District on 29 February 2008, which was established by Legislative Instrument (L.I.) 1892; thus the remaining part has been renamed to become Nkwanta South District. However, on 14 November 2017 (effectively 15 March 2018), it was later elevated to municipal district assembly status to become Nkwanta South Municipal District; which was established by Legislative Instrument (L.I.) 2283. The municipality is located in the northern part of Oti Region and has Nkwanta as its capital town.
