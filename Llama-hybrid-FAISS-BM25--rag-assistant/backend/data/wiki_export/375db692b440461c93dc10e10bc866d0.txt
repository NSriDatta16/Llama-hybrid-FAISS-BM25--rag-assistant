Nene Park is a country park in the city of Peterborough, Cambridgeshire in the United Kingdom. Opened in 1978, it occupies a site approximately three and a half miles long, from slightly west of Castor to the centre of Peterborough.

The park has three lakes, one of which has a watersports centre which provides sailing, kayaking and windsurfing classes. Another lake has a pedalo and rowing boat for hire shop, and the third lake contains moorings for boats and has access to the River Nene. Nene Park also has three children's play areas, located in different points of the park and a small miniature railway. The main entrance to the park is served by the Nene Valley Railway station at Ferry Meadows, from which all the park's main attractions can be accessed. The eastern end of the park is also served by Orton Mere and Peterborough Nene Valley stations.

The park was conceived as part of the town's 1968 expansion masterplan. Originally within the control of the Peterborough Development Corporation, the management of the park was transferred to the Nene Park Trust, a company limited by guarantee with charitable status in 1988 under the auspices of the New Town Community Related Assets transfer arrangements. An endowment of properties provides sufficient income to cover running costs, along with that generated by the Park's tenancies and operations.

The Nene Park Trust is tasked, "to provide for the recreation of the public by the provision of a park for the benefit of the inhabitants of Peterborough and visitors with the object of improving the conditions of life for such persons." The park combines a balance of commercial attractions and informal and formal recreational pursuits appropriate to the quiet enjoyment of the countryside in addition to farmed land and nature areas.

In addition local schools make extensive use of the park for educational field study, students also can gain hands on landscape management experience. Within this area there is also a visitor centre, public house, two hotels, sculpture collection, plant nursery and garden centre which add to the broad appeal of the park and its inclusion in the life of the city. There is also a major steam railway run by enthusiasts that is some  long.
