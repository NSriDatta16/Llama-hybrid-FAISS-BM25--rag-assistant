"I Love Saturday" is a song by English synth-pop duo Erasure, released as the third single from their sixth studio album, I Say I Say I Say (1994), on 18 November 1994 in Japan. The track was written by Vince Clarke and Andy Bell, and produced by Martyn Ware. In the United Kingdom, Mute credited the first CD single as the I Love Saturday EP, which contains several new tracks; it was released on 21 November 1994.

"I Love Saturday" was issued via Mute Records in the UK and Elektra Records in the US. The single peaked at number 20 on both the UK Singles Chart and the US Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. The song also reached number 34 in Sweden and number 69 in Germany.

Critical reception
AllMusic editor Ned Raggett wrote that "I Love Saturday" "neatly balances pepped up energy on Clarke's part with a lower-key delivery from Bell", and called it a "striking combination". Larry Flick from Billboard described it as a "bouncy foray into trance-colored hi-NRG waters." He complimented Bell's "always striking voice". Ross Jones from The Guardian commented, "Every melancholic pop hook from the last 10 years lovingly stitched together with asphyxiating grace." Chris Gerard from Metro Weekly said the song is "great" and "infectious", adding that it "features Bell showing off his falsetto in the verses." 

Mario Tarradell for The Miami Herald called it "bouncy fun" and "ideal summer fare â€“ light, bubbly and innocuous." A reviewer from Music & Media wrote, "Saturday night fever is ruling again. Only the musical format has changed from disco to camp electro pop with, as ever, a high sing-along quotient." John Kilgo from The Network Forty declared it "another fun pop hit". Dejan Kovacevic from Pittsburgh Post-Gazette praised it as "an instant Erasure classic", while David Sinclair from The Times named it the best number of the album.

Music video
A music video was produced to promote the single. It was directed by Caz Gorham and Francis Dickenson and was released on November 21, 1994. The video is made as a jaunty holiday clip shot in Andy Bell's Majorcan home.
