Lord Byng Secondary School is a public secondary school located in the West Point Grey neighbourhood on the west side of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It opened in 1925 and was named in honour of the then Governor General of Canada, Julian Byng, 1st Viscount Byng of Vimy. In 2003, the school expanded with the addition of a library, a gymnasium, and multiple studios and classrooms.

Mini school program 

The Byng Arts Mini School is a program for students that places artistic development at the core of the high school experience through enrichment in the fine arts as well as academics. Traditionally, students have specialized in Visual Arts, Band, Strings, or Theatre, but options have expanded to include Literary Arts, Media Arts, and Choir.

The school offers a program that is designed for students who wish to direct their energies and passions towards the arts, to work within a community of students who share their interests, and to maintain strong academic achievement. 

The program promotes academic and artistic excellence through curricular and extracurricular activities in the fine arts, literary arts and applied fine arts.
