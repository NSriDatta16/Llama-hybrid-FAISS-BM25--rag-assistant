International career
Replacing the injured Richard Hadlee Webb's first ODI was the second match in the best-of-three final of the Benson & Hedges World Series Cup against Australia, played on 13 February 1983 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG).

Webb also played in the 1st and 2nd ODIs against England in 1983. In the 1st ODI, played at Eden Park on 19 February 1983, England won the toss and batted first. Again, Webb opened the bowled, taking 0/30 in his 10 overs. England were dismissed for only 184. New Zealand reached their target comfortably, winning by 6 wickets, so Webb did not bat.

In the 2nd ODI, England again won the toss, but put New Zealand in to bat first. New Zealand reached 295–6, so again Wedd did not bat. In his third and final ODI, he bowled at first change, taking 2–28 in 7.5 overs.
