The Cog Factory, formerly located at 2224 Leavenworth Street in Omaha, Nebraska, was a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that provided a punk rock music performance space for the area. The facility opened in 1994 with bands Ritual Device, Sideshow and Mousetrap. Musician Conor Oberst began making public performances there in the 1990s. Cog Factory closed permanently in January 2002.

About
Serving as the foothold for the Omaha punk rock, hardcore, ska, and indie scene for many years, the Cog Factory was an all-ages venue located in Omaha's downtown core near the historic Old Market. Founded by self described "DIY-Punk" Robb Rathe, the Cog Factory served as the launching pad for the careers of many Saddle Creek Records bands, as well as being a tour stop for national acts. Cog Factory also promoted shows at Sokol Auditorium when the draw was too large for its own club.

Structure
The Cog Factory was a non-profit 501(c)3 organization run strictly by volunteers. All the proceeds from shows were used to cover the building expenses and payment of artists. Numerous volunteers tried keeping the club going until 2002, when Cog Factory ceased to operate. With all the original founding volunteers no longer operating Cog Factory after 2001, its original goal of providing an all-ages venue for every type of independent music free of discrimination started to erode.  The club's organizational structure broke down, sufficient funds were no longer being earned, and the location was closed.

Legacy
Footage of the venue is shown in the Spend an Evening with Saddle Creek documentary.
