The Richmond Renegades was a SPHL ice hockey team in Richmond, Virginia. The team, owned by Allan B. Harvie Jr., the founder of the former ECHL Renegades franchise, began play in October 2006 at the Richmond Coliseum. The team's first head coach was John Brophy. After the Renegades loss in the first round of the 2007 playoffs, Brian Goudie replaced Brophy as head coach.

The new Renegades replaced the United Hockey League Richmond RiverDogs, who relocated to suburban Chicago for the 2006–07 season to become the Chicago Hounds. The most recent Renegades were the second team with that name; the first was an ECHL team that played from 1990 to 2003.

The Richmond Renegades ceased operations at the end of the 2008–09 SPHL season.
