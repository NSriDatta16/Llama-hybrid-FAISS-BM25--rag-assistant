Plot 
In a Manhattan studio, Emanuelle shoots a nude photo shoot. Afterwards, Janet, one of the models, talks about her relationship with Tony, a virgin philosopher who thinks sex is the root of all of modern society's evils. She complains that they do nothing but talk. In her car, Emanuelle gets hijacked by Tony, who threatens to kill her because of her sexual immorality. Emanuelle finds out about his sexual childhood trauma, argues for the cleanliness of sex, and starts to perform fellatio on him. Panic-stricken, Tony runs away.

At her apartment, Emanuelle's boyfriend Bill plays with Tony's gun while she prepares to leave for a meeting. Craving sex, he playfully threatens to demonstrate his love by committing suicide, putting the gun against his head, and gets Emanuelle to postpone and have sex with him.

Planning to investigate billionaire Van Darren, Emanuelle visits a downtown boxing gymnasium to meet Joe, a former fighter turned trainer after being replaced as Van Darren's bodyguard. Van Darren's harem consists of twelve zodiacal women, the only current opening being for a Virgo. Joe provides her with false papers.

At Van Darren's villa, Emanuelle infiltrates the harem. At the pool, she joins two of the women for a lesbian underwater game. Investigating the stables, she finds a weapons stash labeled "horse shoes". Guest at Van Darren's is Alfredo Elvize, the Duke of Elba, who, unlike his host, has a monogamous attitude. In the evening, everyone watches a woman giving a hand job to Pedro, her favorite horse. Alone with Van Darren, Emanuelle ridicules him for his power- and money-centered approach to sex. In the game room, she beats him at poker dice, taking a lot of money from him. She flees in Elvize's car and is invited to his Venetian palazzo.

Arriving at the palazzo, Emanuelle witnesses a marital crisis: The duke catches his wife with another man, and in turn, sleeps with Emanuelle. When his wife joins them, Emanuelle leaves, happily reuniting the couple. When Emanuelle's boyfriend Bill arrives for a two-hour stay, the couple have sex in a palazzo during a rehearsal of the Spring concerto. At a party in the duke's mansion, Emanuelle learns of a Caribbean island resort which offers beautiful men to sex-starved women. She also discovers the duke's hidden stash of forged paintings. When a pop out cake is opened, the party turns into an orgy, and Emanuelle takes pictures.

Back at the Manhattan studio, Janet tells her that sex is all that Tony thinks of now. Alone again, Emanuelle has phone sex with Bill.

Emanuelle poses as a client to infiltrate the Caribbean island resort. She takes pictures of the various couples and their sexual role plays. One of the women watches an 8 mm snuff film during sex, which shocks Emanuelle. Her cover is blown when one of the male sex workers recognizes her from one of her journals. She escapes by seducing, drugging and raping the resort's lesbian director and getting into the cab of the chauffeur with whom she came. They have sex in the car.

The trail of the snuff film leads her to a shady US senator. In Washington, Emanuelle seduces him. Taking her for a walk, the senator presents himself as a conservative patriot and invites her to his studio. There, she convinces him of showing her his snuff film collection. Enamored, the senator has sex with her and drugs her drink. Emanuelle goes into a drug trip in which she travels with the senator to South America and witnesses the torture and rape with her own eyes. In the morning, she promises the senator to visit him again.

Back at the newspaper, Emanuelle is uncertain if what she saw was real until her editor shows her the pictures she took. Emanuelle sees it as the scoop of the century, but the editor tells her he has received orders from the top not to publish them. Angered, Emanuelle decides to take a break from her job indefinitely.

On vacation in an island paradise with Bill, Emanuelle gets caught by a native tribe and is to become the local chieftain's twelfth wife. Bill confesses he has sold her for a shell necklace and some local beer. After the ceremony, a US film crew suddenly appears. The tribe are used as actors. Not wanting to take part in a film, Bill and Emanuelle elope, running along the beach in the sunset.
