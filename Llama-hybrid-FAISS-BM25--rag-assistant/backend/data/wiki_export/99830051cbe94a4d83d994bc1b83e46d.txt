Lambley is an English village and civil parish near Nottingham, England, hardly touched by urbanisation, as it lies in a green belt. The population recorded in the 2011 census was 1,247. Its proximity to Nottingham () has tended to raise the price of its real estate.

Governance and environment
Lambley comes under the Lambley Parish Council and Gedling Borough Council.

Lambley Dumbles are secluded places noted for their geology and ancient woodland rich in flowers and ferns. They are accessed along three marked village trails.

Wicketwood Hill was a wood in medieval times south of Lambley village, then a hamlet on the downhill part of Spring Lane. Newer maps show it as a wider residential area west of Wood Farm.
