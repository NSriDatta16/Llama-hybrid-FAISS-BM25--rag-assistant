Playing career

Huddersfield Town
A product of the Huddersfield Town academy, Holdsworth made his professional debut in the 2003–04 season aged 19. He was a substitute in the 2–1 victory over Bristol Rovers at the Galpharm Stadium and quickly went on to establish himself in the first team. During the season, playing at right-back, he made 39 league appearances (five as a substitute).

He scored his first professional goal against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light in a League Cup tie which Huddersfield won 4–2, a goal which was aided by referee Mark Cooper's decision to play-on following a handball by Ben Clark.

In late 2006, he was named on Alisdair Straughan's list of Huddersfield Town's Fans' Favourites, one of 6 members of the then current squad to be named.

In April 2007, Holdsworth signed an extension to his contract, which would see him stay at the Galpharm until 2009. After a move from full back into midfield, he scored his first two goals of the season in the final league match of 2006–07 at home to Leyton Orient where Huddersfield won 3–1.

On 26 April 2008, Holdsworth was named Town's Player of the Year, with 40% of the votes. Second was goalkeeper Matt Glennon and third was Andy Booth.

Oldham Athletic
On 26 May 2009, after failing to agree a new contract, he left Huddersfield Town. After playing 2 friendlies for Bradford City, he was offered a two-year deal at Oldham Athletic, which he accepted. He played fifteen games for the club before being released on 28 January 2011.

He now plays right-back after the absence of Jamie Clarke. In the season of 2014–15 with the introduction of right-back Ryan Toulson, Mark Bower moved Holdsworth back into midfield where he is a great threat in front of goal. He was named club captain for the season, leading Guiseley to promotion to National league. Soon after Guiseley released Holdsworth.
