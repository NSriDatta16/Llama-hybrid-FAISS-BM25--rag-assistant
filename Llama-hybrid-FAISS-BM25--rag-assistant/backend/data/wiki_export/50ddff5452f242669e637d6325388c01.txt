History

BlueCross was founded in 1945 when Roy McDonald saw the need to establish a payment system that would benefit Erlanger Hospital, now the Erlanger Health System.

On October 2, 2009, 57 computer hard drives were stolen from Blue Cross, some containing Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and medical information. Some of them contain Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and medical information. In 2012, the company was fined $1.5 million over the data breach.
