History 
The Indigenous name for the area was Boykambil.

The area was named after colonial aristocrat Captain Louis Hope, who in 1867 was granted the island then known as Boykambil near the mouth of the Coomera River in recognition of his contribution in developing the sugar industry in Queensland.

After arriving in Moreton Bay in 1848, Hope spent the next 20 years building sugar plantations on the edge of Moreton Bay. The development of a sugar plantation called ‘Rockholm’ on the Island was largely undertaken by the Grimes Family. By the twentieth century, the sugar and arrowroot plantation had passed into the hands of the Sheehan and Davidson families. Hope himself never actually lived in the suburb of Hope Island, preferring to live in Ormiston on the edge of Moreton Bay.
