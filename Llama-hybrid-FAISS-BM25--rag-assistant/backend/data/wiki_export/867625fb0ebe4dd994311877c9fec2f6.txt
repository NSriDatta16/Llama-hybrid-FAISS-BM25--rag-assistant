About

History 
The Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth was first granted a Charter from the State of Texas in 1892 as the "Fort Worth Public Library and Art Gallery", evolving through several name changes and different facilities in Fort Worth. The mission of the museum is "collecting, presenting and interpreting international developments in post-World War II art in all media."

Architecture 
The museum's current building was designed by Japanese architect Tadao Ando and opened to the public on Saturday, December 14, 2002. Michael Auping, (chief curator at the museum from 1993 - 2017), worked closely with Ando during the five-year design process to ensure that the interior spaces would also meet the display needs of the curators and artists.  The building features three long pavilions set into a reflecting pond and provides  of gallery space for exhibitions.  In 2019, the building was selected as the Best Designed Building in Texas by Architectural Digest.  Ando's structure is located within the city's Cultural District, home to the adjacent Kimbell Art Museum and the Amon Carter Museum.
