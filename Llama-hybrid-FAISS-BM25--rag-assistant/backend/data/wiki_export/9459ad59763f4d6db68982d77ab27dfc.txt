History

Formation and debut album (2003–2007)
Drummer Ryan O'Connor and bassist Joe Lussa along with former guitarist/songwriter Bob Morris formed the core of the band in their hometown of Elmhurst, Illinois in 2003, working with a revolving cast of musicians in their early years. Their first EP, titled "Every Scar Tells A Story," had 6 songs, including a song called 'A Lifetime In Six Months' which would later be called 'Fashion Hour'. They recorded their second EP, "All in Your Head", at The Gallery of Carpet before Danny Stevens, Seth Johnson and Timmy Klepek joined the group, and played some gigs with other local Chicago acts like The Academy Is.... Stevens, who became the singer, was originally brought in to play guitar for the band.  The Audition then signed to Victory Records; national touring followed, and Controversy Loves Company, their debut LP for the label, was released in September 2005 to mixed reviews.<ref>The Audition - Controversy Loves Company Review of Controversy Loves Company.

Touring with Silverstein and Spitalfield ensued in February 2006; more touring with Mae and Lovedrug followed later in 2006.

In 2006, The Audition joined 30 Seconds to Mars for their Summer tour. In early 2007 the band joined Head Automatica and Jack's Mannequin on The West Coast Winter Tour, including dates in Canada.

Coming off an appearance at Austin's SXSW festival, the band went on a full US tour with Hit The Lights, with sets scheduled at both east and west coast Bamboozle events. Following some festival appearances throughout the UK, such as the Reading and Leeds Festivals, in May they took part on the entire 2008 edition of Van's Warped Tour and a visit back to Australia in May/June supporting Story of the Year.

Subsequent activity (2008–present)

Before release, the band released a preview to three songs off of the upcoming album on their MySpace page. On January 28 it was announced on their official blog that original bassist and founding member Joe Lussa would be leaving the band.  Bass duties were handled by Klepek and the band continued for this period as a four-piece. The Audition replaced Kill Hannah on the Madina Lake 2009 British tour. They also toured with All Time Low in September and October 2009 and joined Cobra Starship on their "Hot Mess Across the U.S." Tour in late August 2009 with The Friday Night Boys and Skeet Skeet, replacing Plastiscines.

The Audition toured in Australia in September 2010 with You Me At Six.

The band announced they would be writing and recording after the tour and released a fifteen-second clip of a new song on their Facebook page in November. The clip was unavailable shortly after being posted, but in February, the band announced on their Twitter that they would be releasing new music in the spring.  It was announced on 21 September 2011 that original bass player Joe Lussa had rejoined the band and that original guitarist Seth Johnson had left, to be replaced by Jimmy Lopez.
