Hammer og Hosanger was an administrative entity in Hordaland county, Norway.

It was an electoral district up to and including the Norwegian parliamentary election, 1882, whence electors were sent to a countywide electoral college. Ahead of the Norwegian parliamentary election, 1885 Alversund was demerged as its own electoral district.

Correspondingly, Alversund was demerged as its own bailiff district on 1 January 1887.

It has also been claimed that Hammer og Hosanger was a municipality from 1837 to January 1, 1885. Hosanger and Hammer were actually different municipalities; from Hosanger, Modalen was split in 1910, and from Hammer, Alversund was split in 1885 (and from it Meland in 1923) and Ã…sane in 1904.
