History

1800 to 1983 
Until the Mexican-American War (1846 to 1849), the Colorado Springs area was controlled by Mexico, with all Catholic missions under the jurisdiction of the Archdiocese of Durango. After the war, the United States assumed control of the region. In 1851, Pope Pius IX created the Apostolic Vicariate of New Mexico, including Colorado.  The Vatican converted the vicariate into the Diocese of Santa Fe in 1853.

In 1868, Pope Pius IX removed territory from the Diocese of Santa Fe and the Diocese of Grass Valley to form the Vicariate Apostolic of Colorado and Utah. In 1870, the pope erected the Vicariate Apostolic of Colorado, covering only the state of Colorado. On August 16, 1887, Pope Leo XIII converted the vicariate into the Diocese of Denver. On November 15, 1941, Pope Pius XII separated territory from the Archdiocese of Denver to form the Diocese of Pueblo.

1983 to present 
Pope John Paul II created the Diocese of Colorado Springs from territory separated from the Archdiocese of Denver and Diocese of Pueblo in 1983. He named Auxiliary Bishop Richard Hanifen of the Archdiocese of Denver as the first bishop of Colorado Springs.

in September 1984, Hanifen designated St. Mary's Church in Colorado Springs as the diocesan cathedral and launched The Catholic Herald, the monthly diocesan newspaper. He emphasized collaboration with the laity, appointing them to leadership positions within the diocese to ease the burden of the clergy. Hanifen also supported ecumenism and interfaith dialogue, co-founding the Center for Christian-Jewish Dialogue in Colorado Springs with Rabbi Howard Hirsch. During Hanifen's nearly two decades as bishop, the number of Catholics and parishes in the diocese nearly doubled. On December 4, 2001, John Paul II appointed Auxiliary Bishop Michael Sheridan of the Archdiocese of St. Louis as coadjutor bishop of the Diocese of Colorado Springs.

When Hanifan retired in 2003 as bishop of Colorado Springs, Sheridan automatically succeeded him. Sheridan retired in 2021; Pope Francis appointed James R. Golka of the Diocese of Grand Island to replace him. Golka is the current bishop of Colorado Springs
