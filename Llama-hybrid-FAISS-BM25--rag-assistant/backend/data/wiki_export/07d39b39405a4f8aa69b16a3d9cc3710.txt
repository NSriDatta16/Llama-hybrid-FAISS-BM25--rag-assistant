Beatrix "Trixi" Worrack (born 28 September 1981) is a German former professional road racing cyclist, who rode professionally between 2000 and 2021. The winner of the 2003 German National Road Race Championships, Worrack's career highlights included winning the 2005 Primavera Rosa (the women's Milan–San Remo), capturing the overall title at the 2004 Tour de l'Aude Cycliste Féminin and competing in the women's road race at five Summer Olympic Games between 2004 and 2020.

Prior to announcing her retirement in 2021, Worrack took a total of 47 wins during her career, including the general classification at the Tour of California, and the Tour of Qatar, stages of the Giro d'Italia Femminile and the Holland Ladies Tour, and she also placed second in the inaugural Tour of Flanders for Women in 2004. In addition she was part of five women's team time trial world championship winning squads. She spent the earlier part of her career as a team leader before shifting towards a role as a domestique and road captain in later years.

Career
Born in Cottbus, Worrack took up the sport as a teenager, and after a couple of years with her first club competed at the 1998 UCI Road World Championships in Valkenburg aan de Geul, where she won the gold in the junior time trial. In 2006, Worrack was selected as the German women's cyclist of the year.

In November 2015 she was announced as part of the  team's inaugural squad for the 2016 season. In the 2016 edition of the Trofeo Alfredo Binda-Comune di Cittiglio, she suffered a ruptured kidney in a crash, leading to the kidney being removed. However she was able to return to competition and won the German National Time Trial Championships in June. She went on to compete for Germany at the 2016 Summer Olympics where she finished 43rd in the women's road race.

Worrack competed in her final professional race in October 2021 at The Women's Tour, having initially planned to leave the women's peloton after the inaugural running of the Paris–Roubaix Femmes a few days earlier. She had to postpone her final race by a few days due to injuries sustained by several of her  team-mates.
