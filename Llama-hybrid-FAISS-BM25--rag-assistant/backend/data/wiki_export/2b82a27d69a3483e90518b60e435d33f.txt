Saint-Pierre Airport ()  is a regional airport located  south of Saint-Pierre, in the French overseas collectivity of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, off the east coast of Canada near Newfoundland.

Overview
The airport was completed in August 1999 and consists of four buildings and a control tower. The old airport, opened in 1965 and located on the south side of the inner harbour, was re-located due to the lack of room for expansion (The current runway is  when compared to the old 11/29 at ). The main terminal building is a two storey structure. The old airport is located in city centre of St. Pierre and is being redeveloped for housing complexes. The control tower, terminal building, hangar, and part of the old runway (mark number 29) are intact. The airport project cost 370 million French francs.

Unusually, the airport's ICAO airport code, LFVP, begins with an L, representative of the codes used in France (and nearly all of southern Europe), despite the geographical proximity to Canada's codes which begin with C. While not entirely unheard of elsewhere, it is rarely seen in airports of other overseas territories or possessions of European nations, including France, which tend to hew to the most geographically relevant letter code, as opposed to the most politically relevant. Airports in French Guiana, for example, use South America's S prefix, despite French Guiana's being an overseas department of France.
