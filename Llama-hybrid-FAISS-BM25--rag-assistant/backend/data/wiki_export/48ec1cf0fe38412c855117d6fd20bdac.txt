In 1652, he took degrees in civil law, that of doctor being completed in 1663, being then and before accounted an excellent Grecian, and a good Greek and Latin poet, as appears by this book, which he composed when a young man: Musae sacrae seu Jonas, Jeremiae Threni, & Daniel Graeco redditi Carmine (Oxon. 1652. oct.), and also by diverse Greek and Latin verses, dispersed in various books. He died at Petersfield on Good Friday, 5 April 1672, and was buried in the church at Havant in Hampshire.
