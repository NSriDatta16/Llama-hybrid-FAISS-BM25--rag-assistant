History

1973 launch
The mall opened in phases starting in Spring 1973 with a  Sears as the first anchor open, followed by a  two-level Buffums on September 5, 1973. The Broadway followed, opening in August 1975, and J.C. Penney in 1976. Up to that point, the mall had cost an estimated $50Â million to build and contained  of retail space in Phase I with 55 stores and  of retail space with 83 stores in Phase II.

1990s
In May 1991, Buffums closed due to the chain being liquidated and three years later, the store's second level was converted into an upstairs food court. The food court, which operated from 1994 to 2011, was the only part of the general mall on the second level. The Broadway converted into Macy's in May 1996.

2010s
In May 2013, Merlone Geier Partners purchased the property from Simon Property Group. A year later, Merlone Geier purchased the Sears anchor store. Sears (the mall's original anchor store) closed in July 2014. Renovations started in 2016.

Re-branding

The Laguna Hills Mall is scheduled to be renamed "Five Lagunas". According to Laguna Hills' city documents, the renovations include pedestrian plazas, new retail sections, a 988-unit apartment complex, a multi-screen movie theater, new signage, and a 1,500-space parking structure.

Macy's closed in March 2018 as part of a plan to close 11 stores nationwide, which halted construction on its end of the mall and left JCPenney as the only remaining anchor.

JCPenney closed in October 2018 which left the mall with no anchors.

The mall closed on December 31, 2018. The exterior stores remained open.
