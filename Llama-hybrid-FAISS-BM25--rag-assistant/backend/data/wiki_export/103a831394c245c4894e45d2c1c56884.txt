Music video 
The video depicts M.  Shadows and then girlfriend (now wife) Valary laughing and shooting footage of each other- they are expecting a child. The rest of the band come to his house and pick him up so they can rob a liquor store. In the process, Shadows gets caught by the police while the others drive off, leaving him behind. He goes to jail, where after his wife comes to visit him. They get into a fight; while driving home his wife is hit by a van. A funeral scene follows, and her casket is lowered into the ground; Synyster Gates is shown playing the song's guitar solo on top of her casket. At the end of the video, Shadows  is at her grave, with their son, who had survived the crash/ The rest of the band come over to him, Shadows picks up his son, and the group walk away. 

The video was inspired by the video for Guns N' Roses' "November Rain". M. Shadows said, "It's not us driving around in cool cars and just chilling, you know? It has a story and Guns N' Roses did those videos the best. It wasn't about looking cool and being flashy, it was about being real and showing the scenario and being true to the video." The video was directed by Wayne Isham. 

In 2007, the video won a Metal Hammer Golden Gods Award for Best Video.
