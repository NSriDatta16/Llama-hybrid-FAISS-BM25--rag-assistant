"Get into You" is a song written by Mike Percy and Tim Lever for Australian singer, songwriter and actress Dannii Minogue's second album, Get into You (1993). It was produced by Lever & Percy and received a mixed reception from music critics. Released as the fifth single in the second quarter of 1994, it reached the top forty in the United Kingdom. Along with the single "This Is It", the song was chosen to be released in Canada and the US.

Critical reception
In his weekly UK chart commentary, James Masterton wrote, "The new single is more of the kind of record she turns out as standard and has little prospect of reaching the heights of earlier releases." Alan Jones from Music Week said, "The title track from Minogue's last MCA album makes a belated appearance. And should radio warm to the Hustler's Convention's housed-up transformations of the track, already big in the clubs, Minogue could net another medium-sized hit." James Hamilton from the RM Dance Update described the remix as a "plaintive remorselessly powerful jiggly throbbing" track.

Music video
A music video was made to promote the single. It was later published on YouTube in 2013.
