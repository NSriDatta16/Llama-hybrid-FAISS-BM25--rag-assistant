History
During the Kandyan Wars, the British government house in Mullaitivu was attacked by forces of Pandara Vanniyan and Dissava of Nuwara Kalawiya and lay siege to the fort. Captain Drieberg with his force of Malays escaped from the fort in boats and reached Jaffna.

During the Sri Lankan Civil War, Mullaitivu became an isolated base for the Sri Lankan armed forces. In a pitched battle the LTTE succeeded in over running the base in 1996. Following this the Sri Lankan armed forces withdrew from Mullaitivu which allowed the LTTE to gain control of the area. It was damaged by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami with a large loss of life. The Sri Lankan Army took control of the town on January 25, 2009, in the Battle of Mullaitivu in its offensive against the LTTE. Security Forces Headquarters â€“ Mullaitivu was established on June 5, 2009 in the town.
