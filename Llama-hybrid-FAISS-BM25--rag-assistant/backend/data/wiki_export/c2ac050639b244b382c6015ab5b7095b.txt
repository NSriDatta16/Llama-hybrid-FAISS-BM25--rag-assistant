Career Moves is the second live album by Loudon Wainwright III, released on July 1, 1993, on Virgin Records. The album predominantly features material culled from Wainwright's 1980s output, alongside six new songs, and one track from his then-recent album, History (1992). In the album's liner notes, Wainwright states: "To celebrate my silver jubilee, twenty-five years of earning a damn good living on the periphery of the music business, I give you this live record done in one night at The Bottom Line in New York City, my home town."

Wainwright is joined by musicians David Mansfield and Chaim Tannenbaum during the performance.
