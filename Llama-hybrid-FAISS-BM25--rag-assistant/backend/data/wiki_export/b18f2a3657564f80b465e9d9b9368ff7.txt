Denver Technological Center, better known as The Denver Tech Center or DTC, is a business and economic trading center located in Colorado in the southeastern portion of the Denver Metropolitan Area, within portions of the cities of Denver and Greenwood Village. It is home to several major businesses and corporations. The DTC roughly corresponds to the area surrounding the I-25 corridor between I-225 and SH 88 (Arapahoe Road) and has a similar business community reputation to Irvine, California.

History

The DTC was established in the early 1970s.  Cable companies United Cablevision, United Artists Cable, and later AT&T Broadband, all had their start in - and still have major infrastructure around - the Denver Tech Center. In the Colorado area, Bill Daniels and John C. Malone were early adopters who shepherded many standards in cable technology still used today.

The Denver Tech Center was designed by architect/planner Carl A. Worthington.  In the early 1970s, investors asked Worthington to complete a conceptual master plan along a new fiber optic line south of downtown Denver.  The master plan started with forty acres, with potential for an additional 800 acres.  The plan has since grown to 850 acres, and over 25 million square feet of buildings have been completed.
The area's progress was a major reason for Denver Regional Council of Governments's T-REX expansion into the Denver Tech Center, which built new light rail lines connecting the Denver Tech Center to downtown Denver.

The Denver Tech Center is symbolized by the DTC Identity Monument, which sits immediately between I-25 and DTC Parkway in Greenwood Village. The monument was designed by Barber Architecture and is meant to resemble the framework of a skyscraper.
