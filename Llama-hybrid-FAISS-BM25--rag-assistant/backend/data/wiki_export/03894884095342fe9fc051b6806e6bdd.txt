Martin Pederson (December 5, 1921 â€“ September 1, 2001) was a Canadian farmer, business owner and politician, who was leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Saskatchewan from 1958 to 1968.

He was born on the family farm near Hawarden, Saskatchewan. Pederson served in the Royal Air Force during World War II. He was provincial president and national vice-president of the Young Conservative Association and president of the Saskatchewan Progressive Conservative Association before becoming provincial party leader.
