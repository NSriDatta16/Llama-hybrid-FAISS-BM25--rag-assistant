In a 17-10 win against Wake Forest, Williams intercepted a Matt Mauk pass in Hokie territory and returned it to midfield to set up a Tech scoring drive.  On Wake's final drive of the game, Williams broke up a pass in the endzone on third down that would have tied the game and potentially sent it into overtime.  Against North Carolina, Williams intercepted a pass from Darian Durant just before halftime that set up a Hokies field goal.
