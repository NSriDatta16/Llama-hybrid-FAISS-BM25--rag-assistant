The Pauline Family refers to a number of institutes of consecrated life (religious and aggregated institutes) and an association of lay collaborators established between 1914 and 1959, which all share the same founder, Blessed James Alberione and the same spirituality. Their mission is to evangelize with the modern tools of communications.
