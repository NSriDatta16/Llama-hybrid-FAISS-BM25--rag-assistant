The Tasmanian tree frog (Litoria burrowsae), also known as king tree frog, is a species of tree frog that is found on the west coast of Tasmania, Australia. It was first found by Myrtle Burrows in 1941, at Cradle Mountain and handed over to Oswald Scott, who is attributed with the discovery.

Description
This is a moderate-sized tree frog, up to about 60 mm in length. It can be light green or dark brown on the dorsal surface. The brown form normally has some light brown patches and green flecks, while the green form often has light or dark brown patches. A thin stripe runs from the nostril down the side; this line often expands and becomes marbled along the flanks. The belly is pinkish-white and the thighs are light brown.

Ecology and behaviour
This frog is associated with dams, ponds, and roadside ditches in rainforest, sedgeland, alpine country, and moorland in the west and south of Tasmania. It is often found at higher altitudes. The Tasmanian tree frog often mates after heavy rain, or in the autumn, winter or spring.
Males make a goose-like call from vegetation around a water body or while floating in the water during autumn, winter & spring, often after rain.
In more coastal regions the males begin calling as early as May with egg-masses having been observed late in May. This is one of three species of frogs, along with the Tasmanian froglet and the moss froglet, endemic to Tasmania.

Diet
The Tasmanian tree frog eats various grasses and occasionally insects. Despite sightings being common, the species' diet is poorly documented; as a result, not much is known about it.

Breeding
Breeding occurs mainly in autumn & winter at lower altitudes and spring and perhaps summer at high altitudes.  The species may breed opportunistically at any time of the year after heavy rain. From 70–200 eggs are laid in loose or more compact clusters attached to submerged vegetation. Tadpoles occur in stationary or slowly flowing water. The larval stage can last for 7–8 months, much less at low altitudes and with warmer environmental conditions.
