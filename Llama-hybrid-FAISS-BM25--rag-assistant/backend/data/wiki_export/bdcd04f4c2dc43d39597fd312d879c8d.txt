Babu Brajalal Chakrobarti (Shastri), a patron of education, established it first as Hindu Academy in July 1902, replicating the Hindu College that was established in Calcutta in 1816. Like the Hindu College, the Hindu Academy of Daulatpur had two branches, the Chatushpathi and the college or academy. Expenses of the Chatushpathi students including food, lodging and tuition, were borne by the institution. Only residential students were admitted at the beginning.

Later, the Mohsin Fund donated  of land from the Saidpur estate. The estate regularly disbursed a monthly donation of Rs 50 to the academy. The academy was given affiliation by Calcutta University in 1907.

A hostel for Muslim students was built in the college campus in 1910â€“11. At that time, Muslim students had to attend Arabic and the Persian classes in the Muslim Hostel outside the main building of the college. Later, education minister Sher-e-Bangla A. K. Fazlul Huq issued an order to appoint a Muslim teacher for the college. The first Muslim teacher appointed on a part-time basis was Mr. Musaddar Ali.

Babu Brajalal died on 8 August 1944. The institution was named Hindu Academy after him. Later, the academy was upgraded into a college and it received the shortened name of B L College.
