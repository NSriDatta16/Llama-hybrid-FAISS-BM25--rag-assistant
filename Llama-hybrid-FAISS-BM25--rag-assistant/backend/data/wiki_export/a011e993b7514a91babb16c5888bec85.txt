The route between US 27, north of Waterloo, and the Ohio state line was authorized in 1934. The state highway commission removed the authorization on the section between US 27 and the town of Hamilton in 1935. In 1937 the section of road heading east from Hamilton officially becomes a state road. In 1941 the road between US 27 and Hamilton becomes a state road. East of the Hamilton two sharp curves were removed between 1956 and 1957. The southern end of SR 427 was moved from SR 1 near Fort Wayne to US 27 north of Waterloo in 1965. In 1968 the southern terminus was extended south to US 6 in Waterloo.
