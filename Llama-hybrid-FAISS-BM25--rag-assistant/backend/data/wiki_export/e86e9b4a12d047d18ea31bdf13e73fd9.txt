History

First World War
The 56th Brigade was raised soon after the outbreak of the First World War in September 1914 from men, mainly from Lancashire and Northern England, volunteering for Kitchener's New Armies. The 56th Brigade was assigned to the 19th (Western) Division and served on the Western Front from 1915 and was disbanded after the war. The brigade saw service at the Battle of Loos in late 1915, and at during the Somme offensive, at Albert and Pozi√®res and later at Messines in June 1917, Third Ypres and, in 1918, at Sambre, part of the Hundred Days Offensive.

Second World War
During the Second World War the 56th Independent Infantry Brigade was reformed in the United Kingdom on 15 February 1944. The brigade consisted of three Regular Army infantry battalions that had all seen service overseas: the 2nd Battalion, South Wales Borderers (SWB), which had fought in the Norwegian Campaign in 1940, 2nd Battalion, Essex Regiment and 2nd Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment, which both fought at the Battle of Dunkirk in 1940.

The 56th Brigade took part in the D-Day landings on 6 June 1944, as part of the Allied invasion of Normandy, where it formed the right flank of the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division on Gold Beach. It remained attached to the 50th Division until 10 June, after which it was attached to the 7th Armoured Division until 12 June, then reverting to the 50th Division and came under command of the 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division in early August 1944. On 20 August the brigade was permanently attached to the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division, then commanded by Major General Evelyn Barker, a decorated veteran of the Great War. Serving alongside the 56th Brigade in the division were the 146th and 147th Infantry Brigades, along with supporting divisional units. The brigade replaced the 70th Brigade, which was disbanded due to heavy losses.

The 56th Brigade took part in the Normandy landings, liberated Bayeux on 7 June leaving the town mainly intact. All its battalions were involved in the taking of Tilly-sur-Seulles with the 2nd Essex finally investing the town. Later actions were north of St Germain d'Ectot and the liberation of Thury-Harcourt in the Suisse Normande. It was prominent in the drive towards Le Havre and the 49th was one of the assault divisions taking the city in Operation Astonia in September 1944. Continuing to fight in Belgium at Poppel and then the Netherlands it was the assault brigade for the final assault on Arnhem in April 1945. The 56th served well, and ended the war in Germany. The division came mainly under command of First Canadian Army throughout the campaign.

Post War
In 1986, in accordance with the latest policy of having all units in the UK under a Brigade headquarters, 56 (London) Brigade was formed with its headquarters in Horse Guards. (The Brigade was named in memory and recognition of 56 Division of Second World War fame.) The Foot Guards Lieutenant Colonels therefore ceased to command their Regiments. The Brigade Headquarters, commanded first by Brigadier DH B-H Blundell, was made responsible for administration and training of all London District units.

The Gulabin sources gave the Deputy Commander London District and Brigade Commander, March 1985-May 1988 as Dermot H. Blundell-Hollinshead-Blundell.

Antony Beevor's book Inside the British Army gave the formation date of the brigade as January 1987. Brigadier A G Ross, Scots Guards, was in command of the brigade when the 1992/93 training directive was issued. The brigade was disbanded in 1993.
