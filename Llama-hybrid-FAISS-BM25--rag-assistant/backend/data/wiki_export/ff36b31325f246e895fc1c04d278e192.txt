The 19th World Cup season began in December 1984 in Italy and concluded in March 1985 in the United States.  The overall champions were Marc Girardelli of Luxembourg and Michela Figini of Switzerland; both were first-time champions.

A break in the schedule was for the 1985 World Championships, held in Bormio, northern Italy between January 31 and February 10, 1985.  These were the first world championships held in an odd-numbered year.  This was also the last year that super-G was included as part of the giant slalom discipline; beginning with the next season, super-G was treated as a separate discipline.
