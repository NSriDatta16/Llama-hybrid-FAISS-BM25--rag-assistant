Administrative Zone 2 was one of the three zones of the Ethiopian Region of Gambela. This zone was bordered by South Sudan and the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples Region on the south, Administrative Zone 3 on the west, Administrative Zone 1 on the north, and the Godere special woreda on the east. It was added to Anuak Zone. Towns in this zone included Abobo and Fugnido.

Rivers in this Zone include the Alwero and the Gilo; major bodies of water include Lakes Alwero and Tata. A notable landmark is the Gambela National Park, which occupies the land west of the Fugnido - Gambela road and north of the Gilo.

Woredas 
This list of the woredas, or districts, is compiled from material on the CSA website. However, the Ethiopian Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Agency map of the Gambela Region disagrees with the information from the CSA and the map prepared by UN-OCHA for Gambela: although all have Abobo woreda, where the UN-OCHA map (copyright 2003) shows Gog and Jor the DPPA map (copyright 2006) instead shows Gilo and Dimma woredas. The CSA only provides statistics for Gog and Jor in their latest population estimates.
