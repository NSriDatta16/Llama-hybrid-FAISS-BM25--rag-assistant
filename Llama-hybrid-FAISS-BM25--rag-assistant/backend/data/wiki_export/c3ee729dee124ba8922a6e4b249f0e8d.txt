Paul Claiborne Park (born October 1, 1954, in North Adams, Massachusetts) is an American science fiction author and fantasy author. He taught literature and writing in the  Williams College English Department and the Graduate Program in Art History, retiring as a senior lecturer in 2022. He also taught at the Clarion West writing workshop and the Clarion workshop and was an instructor at Clarion West in 2011.

Career
Park appeared on the American science fiction scene in 1987 and quickly established himself as a writer of polished, if often grim, literary science fiction. His first work was the Starbridge Chronicles trilogy, set on a world with generations-long seasons much like Brian Aldiss' Helliconia trilogy. His critically acclaimed novels have since dealt with colonialism on alien worlds (Coelestis), Biblical (Three Marys) and Theosophical (The Gospel of Corax) legends, a parallel world where magic works (A Princess of Roumania and its sequels, The Tourmaline, The White Tyger and The Hidden World), and other topics. He has published short stories in Omni Magazine, Interzone and other magazines, along with anthology series including Postscripts and Exotic Gothic.  In 2010 his short story "The Persistence of Memory, or This Space for Sale" was nominated for a World Fantasy Award; and his novella "Ghosts Doing the Orange Dance" was nominated for a 2010 Nebula Award.
