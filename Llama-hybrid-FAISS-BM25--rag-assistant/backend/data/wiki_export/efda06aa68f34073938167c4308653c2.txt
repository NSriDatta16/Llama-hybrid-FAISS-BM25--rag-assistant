Pulse (stylised as P•U•L•S•E) is a concert video by Pink Floyd of their 20 October 1994 concert at Earls Court, London, England during The Division Bell Tour. It was originally released on VHS and Laserdisc in June 1995, with a DVD release coming in July 2006, with the latter release containing numerous bonus features. 

In 2019, a newly restored and re-edited version was released on Blu-ray and DVD as part of The Later Years box-set; this version was given a standalone release on 18 February 2022. The Blu-ray version is the first release of Pulse in HD, although it is upconverted from the original SD video recording and remains in its 4:3 aspect ratio. A separate 90-minute edit of the film, intended for TV and streaming, was also released in 2019.

Editing out the Publius Enigma
	
The 2006 DVD release saw some re-edited footage of the original 1995 release. During The Division Bell Tour the word(s) "Enigma" or "Publius Enigma" would be visible on part of the stage (sometimes it would be written in lights, or on the back screen). These were connected to the Enigma competition surrounding the album and tour. On 20 October 1994, during "Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)" the screen displayed the word "Enigma" instead of "E=MC2" which is what was shown at all other shows, as seen on the original 1995 release. The DVD, however, has an altered back-drop displaying "E=MC2", although if the DVD is paused at the correct moment the word "Enigma" is still visible. This portion has been replaced with band members shots on the 2019 Blu-ray version.
