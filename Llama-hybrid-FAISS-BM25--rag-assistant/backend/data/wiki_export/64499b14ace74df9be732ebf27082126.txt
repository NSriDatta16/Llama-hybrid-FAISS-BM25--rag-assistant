Woven & Spun is the third studio album by CCM artist Nichole Nordeman, released in 2002.

Critical reception

Woven & Spun received generally positive reception from five music critics. At Christianity Today, Russ Breimeier writing that lyrically the album is a winner but musically the album does not succeed, but he "cannot in good conscience call the total project her best work to date, but there are still a handful of songs on Woven & Spun that firmly establish Nichole Nordeman as one of Christian music's strongest songwriters." Founder Tony Cummings at Cross Rhythms noting "Nichole's poignant and haunting songs a pristine pop sheen" on an album that he calls "Wonderful stuff." At Jesus Freak Hideout, founder John DiBiase saying that "Woven & Spun is a solid album and shows abundant growth in this artist's budding career." The Phantom Tollbooth's Josh Hurst stating that the album features a "cliche sound", yet notes Nordeman as being "one of the most inventive, honest, and profound lyricists writing today, and her remarkable pen has created an uplifting and worshipful testament to God's goodness with Woven and Spun." Allmusic contains a "mix of worship music and pop smarts."
