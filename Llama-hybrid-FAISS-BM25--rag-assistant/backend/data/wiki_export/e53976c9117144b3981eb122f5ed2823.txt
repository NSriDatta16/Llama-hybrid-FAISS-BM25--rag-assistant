Lower Earley is the southern portion of Earley civil parish and a large  suburb of Reading, within the English county of Berkshire. It forms part of (along with neighbouring Earley, Winnersh, Woodley and Shinfield) a large suburban conurbation of over 85,000 inhabitants adjoining east and south-east Reading. Lower Earley and Earley have a combined  population of around 32,000 and Lower Earley itself has developed since the late 1970s. By the mid 1980s it was considered to be the largest private housing development in the United Kingdom. Lower Earley forms a major part of Wokingham Borough. In 2014, the RG6 postcode area (which is nearly coterminous with the area of the civil parish) was rated one of the most desirable postcode areas to live in England.

History
Lower Earley was the part of Earley liberty in Sonning parish beside the River Loddon. It mostly consisted of Earley Upper Common and Lower Wood Common and a number of farms.  From 1977, the Lower Earley private estate was constructed. Three new primary schools were built (Hawkedon, Hillside Primary School and Radstock Primary School), together with a large supermarket complex, which opened in 1979, and a sports centre. In 1988, a second shopping area, Maiden Place, opened.

Facilities

Schools
There are three primary schools in Lower Earley, Hawkedon Primary School, Hillside Primary School and Radstock Primary School. An additional secondary school was planned roughly opposite the sports centre next to Rushey Way, possibly on the site next to the police station. However the school never materialised, and the land was built on. The main secondary schools that students from the area attend are The Bulmershe School, Maiden Erlegh School, The Forest School , The Emmbrook School and The Holt School, as well as some students attending the local single-sex grammar schools, Reading School and Kendrick School. There is also a pre-school next to Chalfont Park.

District Centre
There is a District Centre in the middle of Lower Earley.

Retail facilities
The Maiden Place Shopping Precinct was opened in 1988 on Kilnsea Drive.  Separate from this is a large Asda superstore, with several associated shops.

Local Nature Reserve
There is a local nature reserve called Pearman's Copse within the borders of Lower Earley.
