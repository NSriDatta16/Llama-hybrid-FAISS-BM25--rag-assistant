History
Lochaber High School was founded in 1960. It also served the fishing communities near Mallaig prior to the opening of its high school. As the only high school in the area, it is affiliated with primary schools and takes in pupils from villages and settlements around Fort William. Lochaber High is owned and operated by The Highland Council.

In September 2001 pupils appeared as extras in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets for scenes on a train (GWR 4900 Class 5972 Olton Hall with six coaches from The Jacobite on the Glenfinnan Viaduct).

In May and June 2003 90 pupils were extras in the film Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, the third Harry Potter film, but any fees paid to them on a school day went into Lochaber High School's account. This was around £2,500 in total. Filming took place in Glencoe.
