History
In the place was the Roman castle Aliso, abandoned some time after the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. Nowadays the LWL-Römermuseum Haltern am See informs about the Roman living here.

Former Halteren was founded on February 3 in 1289. They received the town charter by the prince-bishop of Münster, Everhard von Dienstag.

During Kristallnacht (1938), the town's synagogue, Jewish cemetery and the houses and shops belonging to the town's Jews were vandalised. Jews were deported to concentration camps, the last five of whom were deported in January 1942. Only one of the town's Jews survived the Holocaust: Alexander Lebenstein, after whom a school is named.

In March 2015, the town received international attention when 16 students and two teachers from the Joseph-König-Gymnasium in Haltern, were killed in the Germanwings Flight 9525 crash in the French Alps. They were on their way home from a student exchange with the Giola Institute in Llinars del Vallès, Catalonia, Spain. Haltern's then mayor, Bodo Klimpel, described it as "the darkest day in the history of our city."
