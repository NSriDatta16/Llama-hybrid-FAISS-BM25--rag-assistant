Eric Fish (born Erik-Uwe Hecht; 28 May 1969), is the singer of German medieval metal band Subway to Sally. He performs also as a solo musical artist.

History

Eric's first musical merit was that of reaching the finale of a DDR singer/songwriter competition in 1988. The same year he founded Catriona, a folk band based in Königs Wusterhausen, together with Jan Klemm ("Herr Jeh") and Marek Kalbus. The band released one album, the Rightfull King, in 1990, before it broke up. Jan Klemm went on to form the Inchtabokatables, and Eric joined Subway to Sally in 1992, where he initially played the bagpipes, pennywhistles and shared the position of singer with Simon and Bodenski. With the second release of the band, MCMXCV, Eric took over as main vocalist.

His solo project saw the light of day ("the darkness of pubs") in 1999, with Eric playing up to 6-hour-long gigs in small pubs. He was joined by Rainer Michalek in 2000, and Uwe Nordwig (Grenztanz) shortly thereafter. The program of the concerts consisted of rock cover songs, Irish folk and German singer/songwriter songs, as well as Subway to Sally songs.

His first solo album was released in 2004; a live album called Live: Auge in Auge (Live: eye to eye). Quite a few cover songs were on the record, but also original works, penned by Eric or Bodenski. The years of touring start to pay off, with the first sold-out concerts and coverage in the German music press. A new man joins in: Gerit Hecht, at first as backliner/sound engineer, but soon also onstage, as keyboarder. A second solo album, Zwilling (Twin) was released in 2005.

Eric also participated in "Weiß", a project by Rainer Michalek and Gerit Hecht, as a vocalist on several tracks. He has also guest-featured on a few releases in Germany and England (see discography).
