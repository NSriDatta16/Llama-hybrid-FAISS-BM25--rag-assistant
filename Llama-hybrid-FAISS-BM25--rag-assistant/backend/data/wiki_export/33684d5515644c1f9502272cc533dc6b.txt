Formation (1946–1962)

The Mouloudia Club Oranais began on May 14, 1946, when nationalists activists formed the team of Mouloudia Club Oranais, a Muslim club in the district of El Hamri (former Lamur) in Oran to compete with European clubs at a time when Algeria was a French district (French Algeria).

After independence (1962–1977)

The Mouloudia Club Oranais start in the first competition of Algeria independent in 1962–63 season on high level, it qualified for the final tournament of the championship of the first two seasons, 1962–63 and 1963–64 which were composed of three groups (Algiers, Oran and Constantine). It finished second in the group of Oran in both seasons, unfortunately not a qualifying place for the semi-finals, but this place already earned the team a status of a great club. In the following seasons, it will be runner-up twice consecutively in 1968 and 1969 were the legendary striker Abdelkader Fréha was Algerian championship top scorer in both seasons.

In the 1970s and with more experienced players such as Abdelkader Fréha, Abdellah Kechra, Lahouari Beddiar and Miloud Hadefi, the Mouloudia d'Oran will bring back for the season 1970–71 the famous Portuguese coach Carlos Gomes who will say a phrase that will remain famous in the annals of the national football "Give me the MCO and Fréha and I will be champion of Algeria". The Mouloudia will win its first title of its history, the supreme title of champion of Algeria for the season 1970–71.

Sport reform and the era of the great MP Oran (1977–1989)

In 1977, Algerian government decided to reform national sports, it was applied throughout the country, the sports clubs are supported by the national societies and become semi-professionals. Naftal (National Society of Marketing and Distribution of Petroleum Products) sponsors the club. Mouloudia changed its name and became Mouloudia Pétroliers d'Oran (MP Oran). Under the leadership of coach Saïd Amara, and in addition to grandiose players like Sid Ahmed Belkedrouci (top scorer in the championship in 1975), the team is reinforced by talented players like Lakhdar Belloumi or Tedj Bensaoula and finished third in 1979. She is also semi-finalist of the Algerian Cup in 1978 and 1979 and Lakhdar Belloumi was elected top scorer of the championship in 1979.

During the 1980s, and particularly from 1983 onwards, a new generation of players such as Benyagoub Sebbah, Habib Benmimoun, Mourad Meziane, Bachir Mecheri, Tahar Chérif El-Ouazzani, wins the Algerian Cup on two consecutive occasions in 1984 and 1985, which will open the doors to the African Cup Winners' Cup in 1985 and 1986. And with the reinforcement of the team by Nacerdine Drid (1986), Karim Maroc (1987) and the return of Lakhdar Belloumi in 1987, the team becomes more stronger and become semi-finalist of Algerian Cup in 1986, 1988 and 1989 and Algerian Championship runners-up in 1987 but in 1988, the team wins the supreme title of champion of Algeria.

Favour to this title, the Mouloudia takes part in the African Cup of champions clubs in 1989 and loses a final on penalties well-deserved after a total domination of the competition to the return match at the Stade Ahmed Zabana against Raja Casablanca in front of 40,000 spectators.

National domination (1990–2000)
The early 1990s marked the end of the sport reform. Consequently, Naftal ceases to sponsor the club which takes its former name of Mouloudia Club Oranais. The club has always played the leading roles at national and international level since 1962, but in the 1990s he dominated national football with a new generation, Abdelhafid Tasfaout, Sid Ahmed Zerrouki, Ali Meçabih supported by experienced players such as Tahar Chérif El-Ouazzani or Omar Belatoui. The decade begins with the two championships won consecutively in 1992 and 1993 with Abdelhafid Tasfaout best scorer in both seasons. The Mouloudia will be four times Algerian championship runners-up in 1995, 1996, 1997 and 2000 and will win in 1996 an historic double Algerian Cup and League Cup. It will also be a finalist in the Algerian Supercup in 1992, the Algeria Cup in 1998 and the League Cup in 2000.

The decade of the 2000s will be the worst in the history of MC Oran. In addition a lot of conflicts especially in administration and management when the club has not won any title and he often plays the maintenance against relegation, this decade will be marked by two major milestones.

First fact is the Conflict of Elimam-Djebbari of 9 October 2003 in Sidi Bel Abbès during a match of the 2002-2003 Algeria Championship between MC Oran and NA Hussein Dey. The Mouloudia arrived at the stadium with two teams, two technical staff and two coaches, presided by two presidents Kacem Elimam and Youcef Djebbari, the match was canceled and the victory was returned to NA Hussein Dey.

The second fact was the Relegation in D2 in 2008. The club relegated for the first time in its history in Division 2 during the 2007–2008 season. This relegation was a shock to the entire population of Oran, and riots broke out in the city for three days, causing considerable material damage estimated at 7.5 billion centimes of DA, hundreds of arrests and hospitalizations that forced the authorities to use the great means to stop this tragedy. But the club accedes after only one year in D1 at the 2008–09 season. The Mouloudia still holds the national record of presence in the first division.

Professionalism with failure in managements (2010–2023)

The year 2010 will be marked by the launch of the first professional championship encompassing the first and second divisions.
