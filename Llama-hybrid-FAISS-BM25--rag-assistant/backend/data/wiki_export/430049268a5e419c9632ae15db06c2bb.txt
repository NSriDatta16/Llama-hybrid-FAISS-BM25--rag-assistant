Tancheon () is a stream in Gyeonggi Province and Seoul, South Korea. The stream is a tributary of the Han River. It begins in Yongin, Gyeonggi Province, flows through Seongnam, and eventually into the Han. It has a total length of 35.6 kilometres.

The area also serves as a large park, and there are paths for both walkers and cyclists on each bank with occasional foot bridges joining the two sides in addition to the bridges built for vehicle traffic. Along the paths there are many benches as well as exercise equipment. The whole area is extremely popular among local residents.

The stream empties into the Han River by the Olympic Stadium in Seoul.

Names
The stream has been known by many other names, such as Geomcheon (검천, 儉川), Heomcheon (험천, 險川), Meonae (머내), Cheonhocheon (천호천, 穿呼川), and Jancheon (잔천, 鵲川). The word Tancheon (탄천, 炭川) itself is composed of the Chinese characters for charcoal and stream, so a direct translation would be Charcoal Stream. In pure Korean it would be pronounced Sunnae (숯내 or 순내).

Water parks
Along the approximately 25-kilometre stretch of the Tancheon that passes through Seongnam, there are five water parks open to the public. They are free of charge and popular with families with young children. The Tancheon water parks (탄천 물놀이장) are open every year from July 1 to August 31, from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. At the parks there are changing rooms available as well as many chairs and picnic tables. They can be found at:
