Tocorimé Pamatojari is a Brazilian tall ship. Her name means 'The Adventurous Spirit of the number Fourteen', in the native tongue of the Kulina people of the Brazilian Amazon. The name is a tribute to the number 14 and a famous footballer Johan Cruijff.

Tocorimé Pamatojari was built in Santarém, Pará, Brazil. She was constructed using mainly age-old traditional & local Amazonian shipbuilding hand craft techniques. The hull is predominantly made from the Mezilaurus itauba wood.

The founders of the project were René Gerardus de Bruijn, Markus Lehmann (also known as Canoa), Christopher (Kit) & Markus Smit. Jaap Zondervan (logistics) and Will Hamm (music) completed the team.

Crafted with the greatest care and attention to detail and utilizing only the most traditional of hand tools, Tocorimé Pamatojari boldly exhibits its solid Itaúba ribs and planking. The massive and dense  ipê keel and keelson secure the vessel and the  Muiricatiara masts stand tall in the sky. Overall, there is a great diversity of tropical woods used in the construction because Tocorimé Pamatojari was built on the beachside of the Tapajós River. Tocorimé Pamatojari contains  of planking, 40,000 nails and screws, 40 tonnes of ballast, and  of rope.

After 6 years in construction, Tocorimé Pamatojari made her maiden voyage down the Amazon in March 2000.
