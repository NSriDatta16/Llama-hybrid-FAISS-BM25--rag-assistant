He was selected to play in the 1992 NHL All-Star Game and still holds many offensive records for the St. Louis Blues.

Playing career

Junior hockey
Brown joined the Sudbury Wolves of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) when he was selected in the first round, second overall, in the 1982 OHL Priority Draft. In his first season with Sudbury in 1982–83, Brown appeared in 65 games, scoring nine goals and 46 points, leading the Wolves defense in scoring, and finishing fifth in overall team scoring. However, the rebuilding club failed to qualify for the post-season. In 1983–84, Brown saw a big increase in his offensive numbers, as he scored 17 goals and 77 points in 68 games, finishing second in team scoring. However, the club failed to qualify for the post-season. Brown led the Wolves in scoring during the 1984–85 season with 64 points, scoring 16 goals and 48 assists in 56 games. Sudbury missed the playoffs once again. In 1985–86, Brown missed 21 games, but he scored 22 goals, a career high in the OHL, and had 50 points, helping Sudbury reach the playoffs for the first and only time in his junior career. In four playoff games, Brown had two assists, as the Wolves were swept by the Guelph Platers in the first round.  Brown was awarded the Max Kaminsky Trophy, awarded to the most outstanding defenseman in the OHL, and was named to the OHL First All-Star team.

Professional career

Quebec Nordiques
Brown was drafted by the Quebec Nordiques in the second round, 36th overall, at the 1984 NHL Entry Draft held at the Montreal Forum. Brown saw limited action with the Nordiques during the 1985–86 season, appearing in eight games, scoring three goals and five points. In one playoff game, Brown was held off the scoresheet. Brown also appeared in one post-season game with the Nordiques AHL affiliate, the Fredericton Express, getting no points.

He began the 1986–87 season with the Express, appearing in 26 games, scoring two goals and 16 points, before being promoted to Quebec. Brown finished the 1986–87 season with the Nordiques, scoring seven goals and 29 points in 44 games, providing the club with some much needed offense. In 11 playoff games, Brown scored three goals and six points in 13 games, as the Nordiques lost to their provincial rivals, the Montreal Canadiens in seven games in the Adams Division final. Brown spent the entire 1987–88 season with the Nordiques, appearing in 78 games, scoring 16 goals and 53 points, the most among Nordiques defensemen, and fifth on the team; however, the club failed to reach the post-season.

In 1988–89, Brown continued to put up very high offensive numbers, scoring 21 goals and 68 points in 78 games, again leading Nordiques defensemen in scoring, and had the third highest total on the club. The rebuilding Nordiques, however, missed the playoffs for the second consecutive season. Brown began the 1989–90 season with Quebec, as in 29 games, he scored six goals and 16 points. On December 13, 1989, the Nordiques traded Brown to the St. Louis Blues for Tony Hrkac and Greg Millen.

St. Louis Blues
Brown finished the 1989-90 season with the St. Louis Blues, as he continued to put up very solid offensive numbers, scoring 10 goals and 38 points in 48 games, helping the Blues reach the post-season. In the playoffs, Brown scored two goals and 12 points in 12 games, as the Blues lost to the Chicago Blackhawks in seven games in the Norris Division final. In 1990–91, Brown led the Blues defense in scoring, as he had 12 goals and 59 points in 67 games, as he missed nearly a month of the season due to broken left ankle, and was third in overall team scoring, only behind Brett Hull and Adam Oates, as the Blues finished with the second best record in the league, getting 105 points. In the playoffs, Brown continued to be very productive, scoring three goals and 12 points in 13 games, but the Blues were upset by the Minnesota North Stars in the Norris Division final, losing in six games.

Brown scored at least 20 goals for the second time of his career in 1991–92, as in 80 games, he had 20 goals and 59 points, again leading the Blues defense in scoring, and tied for fourth for team scoring, as St. Louis reached the post-season once again. The 20 goals tied Larry Sacharuk's team record. In the playoffs, Brown had two goals and three points in six games, as the Blues lost to the Chicago Blackhawks in the first round of the playoffs. In 1992–93, Brown had the best season of his career, setting a career high with 25 goals and 78 points in 71 games, leading the Blues defense in scoring again, and fourth on the team, despite missing 13 games due to a broken foot. The 25 goals establish a new single-season team record for defencemen that still holds. In the playoffs, Brown had three goals and 11 points in 11 games, tied for second in overall team scoring, as the club swept the heavily favoured Chicago Blackhawks in the first round of the playoffs, before losing to the Toronto Maple Leafs in seven games in the Norris Division final.

Brown began the 1993–94 season with St. Louis, appearing in 68 games, scoring 13 goals and 60 points, leading the defense in scoring for the fourth straight season. On March 21, 1994, the Blues traded Brown, Bret Hedican and Nathan LaFayette to the Vancouver Canucks for Craig Janney.

Vancouver Canucks
Brown finished 1993–94 with the Canucks after his late season trade, appearing in 11 games with the team, scoring a goal and six points. In the playoffs, Brown had a memorable performance, as he scored six goals and 15 points in 24 games, leading the Canucks defense in scoring, as Vancouver lost to the New York Rangers in seven games in the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals.

In the lockout shortened 1994–95 season, Brown appeared in 33 games with Vancouver, scoring eight goals and 31 points, finishing fourth in overall team scoring, despite missing 15 games due to a cracked bone in his wrist after being slashed by Kris Draper of the Detroit Red Wings, and a separated shoulder late in the season. Brown appeared in only five of eleven playoff games for Vancouver due to a thigh injury, scoring a goal and four points, as the Canucks were swept by the Blackhawks in the second round of the playoffs. Brown started the 1995–96 season with Vancouver, appearing in 28 games, as he scored only one goal, and 17 points. On December 19, 1995, the Canucks traded Brown and their third round draft pick in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft to the Hartford Whalers for Jim Dowd, Frantisek Kucera and the Whalers second round pick in the 1997 NHL Entry Draft.

Hartford Whalers/Carolina Hurricanes
Brown finished the 1995–96 season with the Hartford Whalers, appearing in 48 games, scoring seven goals and 38 points to lead the team defense in scoring, but the Whalers failed to reach the post-season. During the season opener of the 1996–97 season against the Pittsburgh Penguins, Brown suffered from a back injury, which required season-ending disc fusion surgery, causing him to miss the entire season. In his only game, he was held off the scoresheet.

During the summer of 1997, the Whalers franchise relocated and became the Carolina Hurricanes for the 1997–98 season. In 32 games with the Hurricanes, Brown struggled offensively, scoring three goals and 13 points. On December 20, 1997, Brown suffered a deep gash in his shin from a Washington Capitals players skate, resulting the injury be stitched up, as Brown was able to return to action. On January 2, 1998, the Hurricanes traded Brown to the Toronto Maple Leafs for the Maple Leafs fourth round draft pick in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft. This trade was made the day before Kirk McLean was acquired from the Vancouver Canucks. (Brown's son Logan, later to become a first-round pick in the 2016 NHL Entry Draft, was born in Raleigh two months later as Brown's family stayed behind following the mid-season trade.)

Toronto Maple Leafs
After playing three games with the Toronto Maple Leafs following his trade from the Carolina Hurricanes, the shin injury that Brown suffered while playing with the Hurricanes was not healing very well, and Brown began experiencing severe chills and became very ill. He asked Toronto trainers if he could go home, but trainers Chris Broadhurst and Brent Smith spotted something wrong with the scar on his leg. Its inflammation appeared to be spreading to other parts of the body. Broadhurst and Smith insisted that Brown see a doctor, but by the time he got there, he was already in shock. Unsure what was wrong, the trainers then rushed him to the hospital, where doctors performed emergency surgery. They found a potentially deadly virus related to the flesh-eating bacteria, had entered the infected area of Brown's leg. The surgery saved Brown's life, and he returned to action for Toronto's February 4, 1998, game against the St. Louis Blues. Brown would appear in 19 games with the Maple Leafs during the 1997–98 season, scoring a goal and nine points. His time in Toronto would be short, as the Leafs traded Brown to the Washington Capitals for Sylvain Cote on March 24, 1998.

Washington Capitals
Brown finished the 1997–98 season with the Capitals, earning six assists in nine games with the club, as Washington reached the playoffs. In the post-season, Brown was limited to two games due to headaches, as he earned two assists. The Capitals reached the 1998 Stanley Cup Finals, losing to the Detroit Red Wings.

After the season, Brown became a free agent but retired from playing after he was unable to find a new team to sign with.

Brown coached the Missouri River Otters of the United Hockey League (UHL) during the 2005–06 season, replacing head coach Kevin Kaminski, who was fired after the team began the season with an 11-27-3 record. Under Brown, the River Otters improved, going 13-18-4; however, the club failed to make the playoffs. After the season, the River Otters folded.
