Benorilate (INN), or benorylate, is an ester-linked codrug of aspirin with paracetamol. It is used as an anti-inflammatory and antipyretic medication. In the treatment of childhood fever, it has been shown to be inferior to paracetamol and aspirin taken separately. In addition, because it is converted to aspirin, benorylate is not recommended in children due to concerns about Reye syndrome.

Synthesis
Acetyl salicoyl chloride (1) is reacted with paracetamol (2) to give benorilate (3).

Partial saponification of benorilate  leads to acetaminosalol (phenetsal).
