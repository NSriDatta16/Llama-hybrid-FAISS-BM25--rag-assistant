Hitler's teeth

On the south side of Brusand, just across the highway, one can still see the anti-tank obstacles erected along the coastline during World War II. These are called Hitler's teeth ( or Hitlers tenner), and they were erected by prisoners of war and other forced laborers, in order to stop an allied invasion of Norway during the Nazi occupation from 1940 to 1945.

The Germans found it likely that an allied assault would happen on the beaches of Jæren, both for its close proximity to United Kingdom and because of the topography. They are made of stone and concrete and run for several kilometers with up to 4 rows of obstacles. The Norwegian prisoners sabotaged several "teeth" by mixing more sand into the concrete in order to make them weaker.
