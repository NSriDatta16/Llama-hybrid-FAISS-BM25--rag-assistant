The Robbinsville Public School District is a comprehensive community public school district serving students in pre-kindergarten through twelfth grade in Robbinsville Township (known as Washington Township until 2007), in Mercer County, New Jersey, United States. A new high school was established in the district, which started admitting its first students in 2004-05 as part of ending a sending/receiving relationship with the Lawrence Township Public Schools under which students had attended Lawrence High School.

As of the 2018–19 school year, the district, comprised of three schools, had an enrollment of 3,164 students and 237.4 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 13.3:1.

The district is classified by the New Jersey Department of Education as being in District Factor Group "I", the second-highest of eight groupings. District Factor Groups organize districts statewide to allow comparison by common socioeconomic characteristics of the local districts. From lowest socioeconomic status to highest, the categories are A, B, CD, DE, FG, GH, I and J.

History
In 1981, the-then Washington Township district filed a petition with the New Jersey State Board of Education seeking to terminate their sending/receiving relationship with the Upper Freehold Regional School District, noting that the departure of students from Washington Township would not adversely impact the racial balance at Allentown High School. After receiving approval, starting in the 1990-91 school year, students from Washington Township, began attending Lawrence High School, under which all of the township's students would leave Allentown High School by the end of the 1993-94 school year.

There was a great struggle in the community to get the high school approved, with a referendum passing in 2001 by a 51-49% margin to approve the construction of a $50 million high school building, while a separate ballot for a pool price at $4.4 million was rejected. The school was first opened in 2004 as a wing in the middle school housing ninth graders. The plan was to start with only freshmen and each year fill in an additional grade. In 2005, the new high school building opened.

The sending relationship with the Lawrence Township Public Schools ended with the final group of seniors who graduated in the 2006-07 school year. As of the 2007-08 school year, all four high school grades were housed on campus and the school graduated its first class of approximately 150 students.
