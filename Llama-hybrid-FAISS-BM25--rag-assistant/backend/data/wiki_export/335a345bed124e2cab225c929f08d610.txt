Sugar Babies are bite-sized, pan-coated, chewy milk caramel sweets which are relatively soft to chew. They are a confection originally developed in 1935 for the James O. Welch Co. by Charles Vaughan (1901-1995), a veteran food chemist and one of the pioneers of pan chocolate, who invented both Junior Mints and Sugar Babies for the James O. Welch Company. Sugar Babies were named after a song called "Let Me Be Your Sugar Baby".

The company was purchased by Nabisco in 1963. The Welch family of products changed hands a few more times, going from Nabisco to Warner-Lambert (in 1988) then to Tootsie Roll in 1993. Presently, packages of Sugar Babies name Charms LLC of Covington, TN, a subsidiary of Tootsie Roll, as manufacturer. Welch produced them along with the rest of the Sugar Family (Sugar Daddy and Sugar Mama).
