John Talbot (21 September 1797 â€“ 22 September 1874) was a schoolmaster, journalist, and merchant.

Born in Cloughjordan, County Tipperary, Ireland, he arrived in Upper Canada in 1818. He was part of a group brought out by his father, Richard Talbot. in order to obtain a large land grant. This did not occur and John, after a number of years of wandering, became a schoolmaster in London Township in 1830.

It is believed that Talbot became a Reformer because of the failed land grant which he considered to be his right.
