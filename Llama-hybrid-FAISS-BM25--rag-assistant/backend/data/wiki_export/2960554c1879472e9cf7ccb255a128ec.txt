Music video
The video for "Switch It On" was directed by Vaughan Arnell and filmed at Thunder City in Cape Town, South Africa. It is based on the 1986 American action drama Top Gun. The video opens with the titles "Will Young in Hot Gun", and features Young in the Tom Cruise fighter pilot role, playing beach volleyball and serenading a woman in a bar. In a 2005 interview with The Guardian, Young commented: "The video was the director Vaughan Arnell's idea – I'd had something different, a performance video, in mind. But he convinced me it was such a universal idea that covered so many areas – blokes love it, women like it. It's not in-your-face homoerotic. Homoeroticism should be subtle. It's not about dancing in leather pants. Mixed with humour, homoeroticism is fantastic."
