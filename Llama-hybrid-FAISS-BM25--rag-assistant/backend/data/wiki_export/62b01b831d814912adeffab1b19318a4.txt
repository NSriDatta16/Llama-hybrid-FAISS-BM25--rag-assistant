Peter Robert Bosustow (born 27 October 1957) is a former Australian rules footballer with the Perth Football Club in the West Australian Football League (WAFL) and the Carlton Football Club in the Victorian Football League (VFL).

Career
Bosustow commenced his footballing career with Perth in 1975 and played in two premiership sides in 1976 and 1977.  After six seasons, Bosustow was recruited to Carlton where he played in the 1981, 1982 and 1983 VFL seasons.  After being suspended for four matches at the end of the 1983 season, Bosustow left Carlton to return to the Demons where he played in the WAFL from 1984 until his retirement from the game in 1987.

Bosustow played a total of 141 games with Perth, kicking 378 goals, and was named on a half-forward flank in Perth's 'Team of the Century' (1899 to 1999).  Bosustow also played eight state games for Western Australia, kicking 17 goals.

Character and legacy
Known as 'The Buzz', Bosustow was a flamboyant character who regularly took big marks.  Despite only playing 65 games over three seasons in the VFL, he kicked 146 goals and played in two premiership sides in 1981 and 1982.  He is best remembered in the VFL for winning both Mark and Goal of the Year in 1981. At Princes Park, Bosustow flew high above a pack at full forward to take a screamer on his chest to claim the Mark of the Year.  Goal of the Year came at VFL Park: Bosustow smothered a clearing kick from a defender 15 metres around from the behind post, regathered the ball, and swung around on one step to kick a high goal over his shoulder.

Family
Bosustow's father, Bob Bosustow, played with Carlton in the mid-1950s. 

His son, Brent Bosustow, played 15 games for South Fremantle in the WAFL between 2003 and 2006 and one game for Swan Districts in 2007. He was named the best and fairest player in South Fremantle Colt's 2003 premiership season and turned down a position on Carlton's rookie list to pursue a career in business. He has 3 grandchildren from his other child, Brooke Warren.
