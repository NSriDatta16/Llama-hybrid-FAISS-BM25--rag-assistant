Dave M. Johnson (born November 16, 1970) is an American former professional basketball player who had a brief career in the National Basketball Association (NBA) in the early 1990s.

Born in Morgan City, Louisiana, Johnson attended Syracuse University, where, as a junior and senior, he developed into a high scoring small forward. Following his senior year, he participated in the now defunct Orlando Classic pre-draft camp/tournament and made the all-tourney team. He had the highest measured vertical leap of all the camp participants (34 inches), was the leading scorer in the tournament (19 points per game) and also won the Slam Dunk Contest. He was selected by the Portland Trail Blazers as the 26th pick in the 1992 NBA draft. He played one season for Portland before moving on to the Chicago Bulls in his second and final NBA season, for whom he played 17 games in 1993â€“94.
