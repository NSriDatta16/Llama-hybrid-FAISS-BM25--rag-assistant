Master of Champions is a show which began airing June 22, 2006 on ABC. The show format was based on a Nippon Television (NTV) original series entitled World Records. The show was reformatted and produced in the United States by Y27 Entertainment for ABC. The show was hosted by Chris Leary and the co-host was ex-Playboy Playmate Lisa Dergan. The panel of Champions was made of up of baseball legend Steve Garvey, Olympic Gold Medalist for ice skating Oksana Baiul, and Olympic Gold Medalist for skiing Jonny Moseley.

Each week the six contestants compete in unusual skills two at a time.  If they compete in the same skill, the one that performed the best is the winner; if they have different skills, the studio audience decides the winner.  At the end of the show, the three celebrity judges decide which of the three winners is given the title of Master of Champions and a trophy that is added to the "Wall of Masters".

The show was cancelled on July 20, 2006.
