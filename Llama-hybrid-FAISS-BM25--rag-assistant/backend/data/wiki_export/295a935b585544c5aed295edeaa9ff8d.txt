is a 3D fighting game developed by Arika and published by Namco. It was released in December 1998 and has never been ported to any home consoles. A spiritual sequel, Fighting EX Layer, was released in 2018.

Gameplay
The gameplay system is similar to that of the Street Fighter EX series (also developed by Arika), such as canceling supers into other supers, and universal guard-break attacks. Unlike in the Street Fighter EX series, fighters can now dash forward or backward by tapping the directions twice and fighters can now also side step with a specific button combination. This game also introduces two new mechanics. One where players can perform safe falls to keep from hitting the ground and the other making their fighter dodge and charge up their super gauge to its maximum.

Characters
Two of the game's characters, Allen Snider and Blair Dame, previously appeared in Street Fighter EX.

Reception 
In Japan, Game Machine listed Fighting Layer on their February 1, 1999 issue as being the eleventh most-successful arcade game of the month.
