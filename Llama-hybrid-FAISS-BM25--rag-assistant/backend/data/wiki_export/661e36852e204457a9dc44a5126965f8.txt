Curses! is a 1925 American silent comedy film directed by Roscoe Arbuckle as William Goodrich and Grover Jones. Although Arbuckle was acquitted in the third trial for the death of Virginia Rappe, he could not obtain work in Hollywood under his own name, so he adopted the pseudonym William Goodrich for directing the comedy shorts he made under his contract with Educational Film Exchanges.
