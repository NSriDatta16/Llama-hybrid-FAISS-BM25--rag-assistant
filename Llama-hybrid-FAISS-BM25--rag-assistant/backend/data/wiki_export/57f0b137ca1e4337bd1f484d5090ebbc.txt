The Hyderabad cricket team is a domestic cricket team based in the city of Hyderabad, Telangana, run by the Hyderabad Cricket Association. It is part of the Ranji Trophy Elite Group and has seen scattered success over its many years in the Ranji Trophy circuit. Over its long history in the Ranji Trophy it has won twice and come runner up three times and has made one appearance in the Irani Trophy.

Competition history
Hyderabad was the third team in the history of the Ranji Trophy to win the tournament, when it did so in the 1937/38 tournament, beating defending champions Nawanagar in a nailbiting one wicket victory. However, it would not be until 1943 that it would appear in another final and this time, it was thrashed comprehensively by a strong Baroda. In 1965 it lost to the Mumbai cricket team and in doing so, failed to break the famous Mumbai winning streak in the 1960s (Mumbai won every year in the 1960s). Its next taste of success was in 1987, where it beat Delhi through first innings lead. It also appeared in the 2000 final but, once again, was unable to beat Mumbai.

This made up for one appearance in the Irani Trophy, in which it faced up against a 1987 Rest of India side. The match was drawn and Hyderabad won based on its 27-run first innings lead. This was after it was awarded 16 penalty runs for slow over rate on behalf of the Rest of India team.
