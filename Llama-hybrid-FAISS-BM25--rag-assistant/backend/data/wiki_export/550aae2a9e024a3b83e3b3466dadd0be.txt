Stories

"Family" is about a woman who is sleeping with a married man. She stays as a visitor in his house while he and his wife are away, and goes through their things. While the primary theme of the story is sex, Choose Me has surprised readers with its "unflattering, often harsh, depictions of old men's bodies from the perspective of their young female lovers." The other themes of the story are lust, loneliness, age, and the Electra complex.
