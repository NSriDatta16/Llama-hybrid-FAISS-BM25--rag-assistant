History
Known in the late 19th century as Irish Corners, the name of the town was changed to Woodville after the completion of the post office under postmaster John Morrison.

Woodville had a town hall, lock-up, grist-mill, two foundries, a cheese factory, planing mill and sash and door factory, a number of dry goods stores, mechanics' shops, and three hotels.

Woodville now is home to two restaurants, one variety store, a post office, a curling rink and arena, two baseball diamonds and a newer school, first built in 1923.
