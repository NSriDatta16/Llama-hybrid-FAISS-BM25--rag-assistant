The Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama () is a conservatoire located in Cardiff, Wales. It includes three theatres: the Richard Burton Theatre, the Bute Theatre, and the Caird Studio. It also includes one concert hall, the Dora Stoutzker Hall. Its alumni include Anthony Hopkins, Aneurin Barnard and Rob Brydon.

History and description
  
The college was established in 1949 as Cardiff College of Music at Cardiff Castle, but in 1973 moved to purpose-built accommodation within the castle grounds of Bute Park near Cardiff University. In 1970 it changed its name to the Welsh College of Music & Drama before being awarded its royal title during Queen Elizabeth II's golden jubilee in 2002, making it the fifth conservatoire to be awarded this title.

From 1973, the college's degrees BA, BEd, MA, were awarded by the University of Wales and in 2004 the college became part of the federal university. In 2007, however, it left the university and agreed to a merger (referred to as a "strategic alliance") with the University of Glamorgan. The University of Glamorgan merged with the University of Wales, Newport, in 2013 to form the University of South Wales, so RWCMD is now part of the University of South Wales Group.

The college provides education and training in the performing arts and technical theatre, including music, acting, design, stage management and arts management. It was the first, and is one of only two All-Steinway conservatoires in the UK, along with Leeds College of Music. The College has approximately 800 students.

A Â£22.5m expansion of the college was opened in 2011, including two new performance venues (Richard Burton Theatre and Dora Stoutzker Hall), a new front of house area and rehearsal studios.

In 2010, as part of the college's 60th anniversary celebrations, students from the college performed in a gala concert at Buckingham Palace, attended by the college's patron, the Prince of Wales. A second gala evening was presented at Buckingham Palace in 2016 to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the college's new facilities.

It is a member of the Federation of Drama Schools.
