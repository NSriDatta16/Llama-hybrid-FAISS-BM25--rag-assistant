History
In October 2017, Holly Glen Elementary School was closed for extensive decontamination for a minimum of three weeks, after high levels of mold -- including aspergillus / penicillium and cladosporium -- were discovered in the building. Days later, the district announced that all of its schools would be closed for a minimum of a week to allow for testing in all of the district's facilities of what was described as a "possible mold infestation." Whitehall Elementary School was closed slightly after Holly Glen Elementary School. The former was remediated and students resumed classes on January 2, 2018.

Awards and recognition
Radix Elementary School was honored by the National Blue Ribbon Schools Program in 2019, one of nine schools in the state recognized as Exemplary High Performing Schools.
