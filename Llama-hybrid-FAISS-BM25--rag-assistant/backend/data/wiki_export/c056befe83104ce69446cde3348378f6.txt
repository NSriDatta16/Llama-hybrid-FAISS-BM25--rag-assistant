History

In 1900, the first school, in Gilbert, was built on the southwest corner of Baseline and Cooper Roads. This school was moved, in 1909, to the northeast corner of Guadalupe and Cooper Roads. It was named Highland because it was the highest land south of the Salt River. These schools were part of the Mesa Unified School District#4.

In 1913, with the completion of its first elementary school, the Gilbert School District #41 was formed. The new school was located on the corner of Elliot and Gilbert roads, and consisted of four classrooms, two offices, an auditorium and a full basement below the auditorium. In 1977, the building closed for classroom use and in 1982 it became the Gilbert Historical Museum.

In 1917, an election was held "for the purpose of establishing and maintaining a high school" in the recently formed Gilbert School District #41. Gilbert's first high school, Gilbert High School, opened in 1917 on the southwest corner of Gilbert and Elliot roads. The first graduating class, consisting of 4 graduates, was in 1918. Gilbert High School has since been relocated, and the original site is now the Gilbert Public Schools district administration building.

Since opening its first school in 1913, Gilbert Public Schools has grown to serve over 35,000 students at 40 schools across Gilbert, Chandler and Mesa, Arizona.
