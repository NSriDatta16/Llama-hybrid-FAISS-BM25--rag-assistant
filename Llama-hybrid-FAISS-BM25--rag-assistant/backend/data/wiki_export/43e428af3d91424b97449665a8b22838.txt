Cub Scouts is the Cub Scout section of Scouts Canada for children aged from 8 to 10. Originally the "Wolf Cubs," the program offers badges to youth members as a mark of achievement in an interest area. The badges are grouped into six activity areas as described in The Cub Book (Scouts Canada, 2005). While youth experience fun and excitement presented by the program, each activity area focuses on a specific purpose and goal, intended to be relevant to modern children while meeting developmental needs. Originally the requirement entry  was age 7 until 2001. Each activity area offers a variety of badges that youth may earn and sew onto their uniform sash:
 A uniquely coloured "Star", awarded for completing a set of introductory requirements in the area. The requirements for a star are flexible, allowing youth to select tasks that are easier than full-blown badge requirements, align with their personal interests, or present an exciting challenge to them.
 A number of "Activity Badges", which focus on a variety of challenging activities in the activity area. Requirements for activity badges vary, and many may be tailored for youths' interests and talents. These activities may be completed individually or with others.
 One or two advanced badges known as "Awards". Typically, youth may only aspire to acquire the awards after first earning the star and a number of badges in the activity area.

The six activity areas are outlined in separate sections below.

Uniform
Recently, the full uniform consists of a grey Cub Scout shirt, khaki shorts or pants, and a neckerchief indicating the youth's group membership. The old uniform was a sandstone Cub Scout shirt which required jeans or black long pants. 

The activity badges described here are generally worn on the uniform shirt sleeve, with additional badges being held on campfire blankets or display books. 

A diagram of the uniform, including placement of awards and crests, is provided on the Scouts Canada Website.

There is active interest in collecting Canadian Scouting memorabilia, even after youth have completed their years in the program. In addition to merit badges and awards that are worn on the uniform, youth often collect souvenir patches that may be displayed off the uniform; for example, they are often sewn onto campfire blankets or ponchos. Uniform badges will frequently find their way onto these items as well, as youth progress through the program, and are popular conversation pieces at Jamborees and campfires.

Symbols

Cub Scout Promise 
The Cub Scouts division has evolved since the 1950s and 1960s when it was extremely large in numbers. The original Cub Scout Promise, written by Scouting's founder Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell, is, "I promise to do my best, to do my duty to God and the Queen, to keep the law of the Wolf Cub Pack, and do a good turn every day."

In recent years, this Promise has been changed to, "I promise to do my best, to love and serve God, to do my duty to the Queen; to keep the law of the Wolf Cub Pack, and to do a good turn for somebody every day." The alternative promise, "I promise to do my best, to be true to myself, to do my duty to my country; to keep the law of the Wolf Cub Pack, and to do a good turn for somebody every day," is available beginning in summer 2020.

The Jungle Book 
Numerous symbols and references from Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book are used in Cub Scouts. These include the use of the term Akala as the leader of the Cub Scout Pack, encouragement of use of nicknames of characters in the book for Scouters (the pack's adult leaders), and others.

Structure 
Cub scout groups in Scouts Canada are known as Packs. These are typically divided into smaller sections, Lairs.
