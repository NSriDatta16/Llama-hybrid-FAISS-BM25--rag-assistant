World Classic Rockers (or WCR) is a rock supergroup band that was founded based from Las Vegas  in 1995 by Nick St. Nicholas of Steppenwolf. St. Nicholas has toured with the band since its inception, which, in similar fashion to Ringo Starr's All-Starr Band, rotates its lineup depending on the contributing musicians' projects at a given time.

WCR performed for the first time in Fort Lauderdale, Florida on December 10, 1995, with St. Nicholas, Bobby Kimball of Toto, and Joey Molland of Badfinger with Richard Ward (keys), Rosilee (vocals), Mike Younce (drums), and Kurt Griffey (guitar) in the backing band. The three joined Mike Pinera and his Classic Rock All-Stars in putting together a live show for the Harley-Davidson Toys for Tots Run.
