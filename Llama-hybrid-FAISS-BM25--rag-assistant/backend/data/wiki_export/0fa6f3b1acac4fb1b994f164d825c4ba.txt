Chromomycin A3 (CMA3) or Toyomycin is an anthraquinone antibiotic glycoside produced by the fermentation of a certain strain of Streptomyces griseus (No. 7).



Fluorescence properties 
In the presence of Mg2+ ions, Chromomycin A3 binds reversibly to DNA, preferentially to contiguous G/C base pairs.

When bound to DNA, Chromomycin A3 has a maximum excitation wavelength of 445 nm (blue), and a maximum emission wavelength of 575Â nm (yellow).

Uses 
 in-vitro membrane-impermeant G/C-specific fluorescent DNA-binding dye.
 in-vitro antibiotic of gram-positive bacteria, through inhibition of the incorporation of Pi in the RNA.
 in-vitro anticancer drug that inhibits RNA synthesis.
 Evaluation of male fertility: Chromomycin A3 and protamines compete for the same binding sites in the DNA, so CMA3 positivity in spermatozoa reflects protamine deficiency (affecting sperm morphology and decreasing fertility).
