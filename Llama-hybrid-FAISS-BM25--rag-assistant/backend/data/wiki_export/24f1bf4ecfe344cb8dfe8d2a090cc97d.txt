"Hurry Up England – The People's Anthem" is a charity single by English punk rock band Sham 69, featuring Graham Coxon on guitar. The single – a somewhat opportunistic re-working of Sham 69's earlier hit "Hurry Up Harry", was recorded as an alternative football anthem for England's entry in the 2006 FIFA World Cup. It was released 12 June 2006 as "The People's Anthem," after being voted on by fans of Virgin Radio DJ Christian O'Connell's morning show (see 2006 in British music). On 18 June, the single debuted at #10 in the UK Singles Chart, two places below the official song of the England squad, "World at Your Feet" by Embrace. The single fell to #31 during its second week in the chart, and then to #50 in its third week.
