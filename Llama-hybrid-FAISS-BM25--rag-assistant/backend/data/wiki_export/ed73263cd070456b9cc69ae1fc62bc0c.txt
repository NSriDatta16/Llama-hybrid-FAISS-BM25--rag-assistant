"Lola's Theme" is the debut single of British house duo the Shapeshifters, featuring soul singer Cookie on vocals. It was released on 12 July 2004 as the lead single from the Shapeshifters' debut album, Sound Advice (2004). The song became the duo's biggest hit, peaking atop the UK Singles Chart and charting highly in Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, and New Zealand. In Australia, it was the most successful club hit of 2004.

Background
The name "Lola's Theme" was originally a working title for this record; Lola was Simon Marlin's wife, and it was while listening to her record collection that the initial idea for the track was conceived. She appears handing out candy floss in the music video.

"Lola's Theme" features a sample from the introduction of Johnnie Taylor's R&B hit of 1982, "What About My Love", and it was originally released at the end of 2003 on their own Nocturnal Groove label as a mostly instrumental track featuring a vocal sample taken from Anthony White's 1994 song "Love Me Tonight". "I basically took one phrase from Anthony White's ‘Love Me Tonight’ track from 1994 on Stress Records, twisted that phrase, cut it up, and made a completely new phrase out of it," Marlin told DJ Mag in 2023. "This was the bit that goes, 'I'm a different person / Turn my world around'. If you listen to the original Anthony White, you'll hear exactly the same words in a completely different way."

Due to its immense popularity, "Lola's Theme" was licensed from Nocturnal Groove to Positiva Records. At the same time, the sample of "What About My Love" was then completely replayed by Mark Summers at Scorccio Sample Replays, recreating all elements of the sample (strings, brass sections, piano, etc.). The duo then set about finding a vocalist. After a long search they met Cookie, a gospel singer from the London Community Gospel Choir, who recorded the vocals for the full release, as well as adding verses.

Composition
The song is a dance-pop song, utilising elements of "What About My Love" by Johnnie Taylor and lyrics from "Love Me Tonight" by Anthony White. Lyrically, the song is written from the perspective of someone who for most of their life felt disillusioned and alienated. It is addressed to an unnamed other, presumably a love interest, who helped the singer to develop a more positive outlook on life.

Release and chart performance
In the United Kingdom, "Lola's Theme" was released on 12 July 2004, and upon its release, it topped the UK Singles Chart. "Lola's Theme" also topped the American Dance Charts, peaking at number one on the Hot Dance Airplay chart in October 2004. The duo went on to have a further two Top 20 hits in the United Kingdom ("Back to Basics" and "Incredible") and now have a recording contract with Defected Records. "Lola's Theme" was nominated for "Best British Single" at the 2005 Brit Awards.

Music video
The music video for "Lola's Theme" was filmed at George Irvin's Funfair in Kingsbury, London; some of the video was filmed at the Irvin's Hellraiser (or Waltzer), the Top Buzz and other rides. The Shapeshifters and Cookie appear in the video, as does remixer Norman Jay.
