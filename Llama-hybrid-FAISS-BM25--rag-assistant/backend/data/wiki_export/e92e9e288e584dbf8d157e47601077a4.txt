The men's double-shot 100 meter running deer competition was one of 15 shooting sports events on the Shooting at the 1908 Summer Olympics programme.  A deer-shaped target made 10 runs of , with the shooter firing two shots during each run. The runs lasted about 4 seconds each and took place  distant from the shooter. There were three concentric circles on the target, with the smallest counting for 4 points, the middle for 3, and the outermost for 2. A hit outside the circles but still on the target (except on the haunch) counted for 1 point. The maximum possible score was thus 80 points. Each nation could enter up to 12 shooters.
