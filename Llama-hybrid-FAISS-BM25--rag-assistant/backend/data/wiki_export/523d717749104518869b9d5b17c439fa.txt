In the region there are three known "Castros". The castro is a fortified village that began to be inhabited from the 6th century BC, lacking streets with right angles and characterised by construction which is almost always circular. One of the Castros in São Pedro do Sul is Castro da Cárcoda.

Roman Era
In the region there are several Roman bridges and Roman Thermal Spas.
