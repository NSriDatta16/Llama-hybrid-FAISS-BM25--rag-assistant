History

The first inhabitants of what is present-day the municipality of Los Robles La Paz were the indigenous peoples known as Chimila, which populated the plains of the valley of the Cesar River. On the Serranía del Perijá mountains the Yukpas were also part of the Chimila confederation of tribes.

The Spanish arrived in the area in 1531 but the region of Los Robles La Paz remained dominated by the Chimila. In 1700 Spanish Captain Salvador Felix de Arias was sent to "pacify" the indigenous tribes. Arias founded Los Robles La Paz this same year.

FARC encampment
An encampment for decommissioned FARC fighters was established in 2016 near La Paz as a part of the Colombian peace process.
