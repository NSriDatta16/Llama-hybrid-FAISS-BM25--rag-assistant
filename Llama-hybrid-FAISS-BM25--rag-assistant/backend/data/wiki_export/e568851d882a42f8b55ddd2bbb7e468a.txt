Victoria National Golf Course (officially Victoria National Golf Club) is located northeast of Newburgh, Indiana, in the southwestern corner of the state, roughly seven miles east of Evansville, Indiana. Victoria is a private 18-hole golf course that was designed by golf course architect Tom Fazio and constructed in 1996 on land that had been used for strip mines from the 1950s until 1977. Developed and initially owned by Terry Friedman and family, the course was sold to Victoria Partners LLC in 2010. As of 2018 it was purchased by the Dormie Network. 

As of August 2019, Victoria National is ranked as the 43rd best golf course in America, according to Golf Digest. Victoria is certified in Audubon International's Cooperative Sanctuary Program for Golf Courses.

Tournaments hosted
Victoria National hosted its first high profile tournament beginning in 2012; the  Korn Ferry Tour's United Leasing Championship was held for seven seasons (2012â€“18). The tournament purse was over a half-million dollars, and the event was televised by the Golf Channel.

Following the 2018 season, Victoria National signed a 10 year deal to become home of the  Korn Ferry Tour Championship. 

Previously, Victoria hosted Legends Tour (the official senior tour of the LPGA) tournaments in 2003 and 2004, as well as the U.S. Senior Amateur in 2006.
