Instinct is the eighth studio album by American rock singer Iggy Pop. It was released in June 1988 by A&M Records.

Style 

After the relative commercial success of Blah Blah Blah, A&M expected another hit record from Pop; however, he instead recorded the heavy, hard-rocking Instinct. The album features Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones and was produced by Bill Laswell.

Release 

The album performed poorly in the US, peaking at number 110 on the Billboard 200 chart. The first single from the album, "Cold Metal," charted at number 37 on mainstream rock charts{{Citation needed|date={{subst:CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{subst:CURRENTYEAR}}}} and earned Pop a Grammy Award nomination for Best Hard Rock/Metal performance in 1989. Except for a few plays of "Cold Metal" the album was largely ignored by commercial rock radio. A&M released videos for "Cold Metal" and "High on You."

Legacy 

The album was ranked number 69 on Kerrang!s "100 Greatest Heavy Metal Albums of All Time" list.

The song "Cold Metal" was briefly played in the 1990 science fiction-horror film Hardware, which also featured Iggy Pop as the voice of Angry Bob, a radio DJ.
