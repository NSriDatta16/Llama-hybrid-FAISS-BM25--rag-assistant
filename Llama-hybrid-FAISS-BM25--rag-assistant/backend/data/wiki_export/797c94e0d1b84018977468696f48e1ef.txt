Russian candy (; from  tyanuchki (for stretchy, "pull-y", kinds of toffee)) is a very sweet toffee-like dessert made by carefully heating equal amounts of milk or cream and sugar. It is a traditional dessert sauce in Nordic countries. Karl Fazer brought the first Russian candy recipe to Finland from St. Petersburg.
