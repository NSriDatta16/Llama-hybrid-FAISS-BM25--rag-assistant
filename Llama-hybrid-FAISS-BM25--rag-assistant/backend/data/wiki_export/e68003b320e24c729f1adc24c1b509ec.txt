Synopsis

Paulie's mother Nucci moves into a retirement home and is looking forward to being with old friends, including Cookie Cirillo. But Cookie has her own group and Nucci is ostracized. Paulie visits Cookie's son, Chuckie, who he used to know at school; he is now a school principal. He presents him with a suitcase and firmly asks him to persuade his mother to be more friendly. Nothing changes. Chuckie is then visited by Benny and Little Paulie who chase him through the school and break his right arm. Chuckie's wife threatens to take Cookie out of the nursing home if she does not make peace with Nucci.

Carmela is thinking about Furio who is back in Naples, where his father has died. He confides to his uncle that he is in love with the boss's wife. His uncle tells him that the only way to have her is to kill the man. Furio says he knows.

Tony starts giving directions to his underlings through payphone calls to Christopher, but he is bored and keeps micro-managing. At the stables, he meets Ralphie's new girlfriend, the Cuban-Italian Valentina La Paz. She works in a picture-framing company and arranges for Tony to commission a portrait of himself with Pie-O-My. They start an affair. She wants to keep seeing him but Tony will not share her with Ralphie. To persuade him, she tells him that Ralphie is only interested in masochistic fantasies and never has (as Tony puts it to Dr. Melfi) "penissary contact with her volvo." But he continues to rebuff her until she breaks up with Ralphie, and her claims about his fetishes are confirmed (in return for payment) by Janice.

Carmela is infuriated when she discovers a false fingernail—it was Valentina's—in Tony's clothes. She takes two packets, totaling $50,000, of the money Tony has hidden in the duckfeed, and invests it with stockbrokers. She ensures that Tony finds the fingernail, and realizes what she has done. At breakfast, while she makes coffee, they ask each other if they have anything to talk about, and both say no. Silence ensues.
