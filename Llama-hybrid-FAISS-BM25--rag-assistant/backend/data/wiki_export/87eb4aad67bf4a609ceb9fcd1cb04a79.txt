Changdeo Temple

The main temple in Puntamba is that of Changdev, a famous saint said to have lived for 1,400 years. It is stated that the saint used to absorb himself in devout contemplation after every hundred years at different places, Puntamba being the last place where he had his fourteenth meditation. There is a legend about Changdeo who, it is said, was very proud of his supernatural powers. He went to visit Dnyaneshwar, the noted saint-poet, by riding on a tiger, and using a poisonous cobra as a whip. The saint decided to humiliate Changdev by deriding his supernatural powers and made the inanimate masonry wall on which he was sitting with his brothers and sister move to meet the approaching Changdev. On seeing this strange spectacle Changdev lost all his pride, bowed in submission to Dnyaneshvar and asked for his forgiveness.

The main temple of Changdev was built in the mid-1600s. Though very old, the temple of Changdev Maharaj is a simple structure with a mandap of 50'x30', open on all sides and covered with a roof of corrugated iron sheets having slope on four sides supported by a wooden frame and ten uncarved wooden pillars about eight feet in height. There is a small quadrangular gabhara wherein small idols of Vitthal and Rakhumai of black stone, facing east are placed. One can enter the gabhara (Inner sanctum) through a small door. However, one cannot see the samadhi (tomb) of Changdev which is just behind the backwall of the inner sanctum. The samadhi is built in well-dressed black stone in a quadrangular form of 6'x4' and paved with marbles, at the centre of which two foot-prints of marble are placed on a little raised platform under a small dome of about 4 feet in height. One has to ascend a flight of steps to see the foot-prints. The temple including the samadhi is surrounded by a wall 100'X70' built in mud and stone at a distance of about 10' on all the sides of the temple. The Godavari river which flows to the west of the temple provides a delightful scenic background during the monsoon season (June–October) but is reduced to a trickle by January. The temple holds its annual fair in Kartik (October–November). It is attended by about twenty-five thousand people from all over the district.

Farmers’ strike
In 2017, the idea of a farmers’ strike was born in Puntamba. In April 3, 2017, the village panchayat assembly passed the resolution to strike on 1 June 2017. Farmers had decided to cut off food and milk supplies to cities or sow the Kharif crops. The main demands of the farmers were implementation of the MS Swaminathan committee's recommendation, a loan waiver, better prices for milk, and pensions for farmers. The strike achieved immediate impact through the use of social media, which led to statewide agitation and further triggered agitation in several other states. After meeting with farmers’ representatives, the Government of Maharashtra  announced a loan waiver scheme.
