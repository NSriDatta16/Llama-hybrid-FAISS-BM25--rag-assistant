Le Bataclan '72 is a sixteen-track live album by Lou Reed, John Cale and Nico. It was recorded from the soundboard and heavily bootlegged over the years, before it gained an official release in 2004.

Background and production 

The album was recorded during a live show at the Bataclan club in Paris, on January 29, 1972, and was originally broadcast on French TV. The concert marked the first time since the breakup of The Velvet Underground that Reed, Cale and Nico were on stage together.

Release 

Though the recording had been bootlegged for years, Le Bataclan '72 was officially released on October 19, 2004, featuring two exclusive bonus tracks (both rehearsals—"Pale Blue Eyes" and "Candy Says"). Due to a problem with tape transfers, the speed is slow compared to the original concert. A speed-corrected version is on iTunes.
