Phlegethontia is an extinct genus of a√Østopod stegocephalians from the Carboniferous and Permian periods of Europe and North America.

It was about  long, and possessed a lightly built skull with many openings, unlike some earlier relatives.

"Dolichosoma" longissima, named by Antonin Fritsch in 1875, has been reassigned to the genus Phlegethontia and is now considered to be P. longissima. "Dolichosoma" has been considered to be a nomen nudum because the holotype was inadequately described through a layer of matrix by Thomas Henry Huxley in 1867.
