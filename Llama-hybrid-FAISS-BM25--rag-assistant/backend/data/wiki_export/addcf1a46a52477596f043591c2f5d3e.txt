Conrich is a hamlet in southern Alberta under the jurisdiction of Rocky View County.

Conrich is located  east of the City of Calgary's eastern limits and approximately  northeast of Downtown Calgary on McKnight Boulevard. It has been anticipated that the hamlet will eventually be annexed by Calgary. However, Calgary's 2007 annexation did not move its eastern limits closer to the hamlet.

Conrich got its start as a flag station for the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway. A flag station was exactly that: passengers wanting to board had to flag the train down. The land for the site was obtained from W.F. Birch. The railroad reached here in 1913, and the name comes from the surnames of two real estate developers, Connacher and Richardson . The Canadian National Railway took over the line in 1918. That year, a 30,000 bushel grain elevator was also built. A post office operated at this site from August 15, 1925, to December 12, 1960.
