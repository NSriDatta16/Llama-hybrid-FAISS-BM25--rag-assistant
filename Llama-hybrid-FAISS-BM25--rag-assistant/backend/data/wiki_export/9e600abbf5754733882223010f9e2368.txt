The GW Hatchet is the student newspaper of the George Washington University. Founded in 1904, The Hatchet is the second-oldest continuously running newspaper in Washington, D.C., only behind The Washington Post. The Hatchet is often ranked as one of the best college newspapers in the United States and has consistently won awards from the Society of Professional Journalists and from the Associated Collegiate Press. Alumni of the GW Hatchet include numerous Pulitzer Prize winners, Emmy Award winners, politicians, news anchors, and editors of major publications.

History
The paper derives its name from the story of U.S. President George Washington (founding father of the university) involving his chopping down a cherry tree with a hatchet.

The first edition of the GW Hatchet was published on 5 October 1904.

In 1993, The GW Hatchet was incorporated as an independent 501(c)(3) non-profit, and the paper has been editorially and financially independent of the university since then.  It is run by a board of directors composed of Hatchet editors, former staff members, a GW student, a GW professor and professionals in the media industry. Daily operations are overseen by the Editor-in-Chief.  All business and editorial positions are filled by current GW students and the Editor-in-Chief serves as the corporation's president.

In 1998, The Hatchet launched its website, which has won many awards including a National Pacemaker Award in 2006 and 2010.

For many years, the university only charged the paper $1 in rent for their fully controlled townhouse in Washington, D.C., but began charging monthly rent at reduced rates as of 2006. In 2012, The Hatchet moved out of the university owned townhouse at 2140 G St. NW and into their own building at 2148 F St. NW. In 2017, The Hatchet sold the building on F St. and began renting from the university again at 609 21st St. NW, known as Davis-Hodgkins House.

In March 2015, the nonprofit real estate arm of The Hatchet sued the city of Washington, D.C., in D.C. Superior Court over a disputed property tax bill of $17,000, arguing that a request for a property tax exemption had been wrongfully denied (under D.C. law, schools, colleges and universities are exempt from property taxes). The city itself took the stance that neither The Hatchet nor its real estate arm qualify as educational organizations under D.C. law. As of December 2016 the lawsuit is still ongoing.

Organization
The newspaper is produced by Hatchet Publications, Inc., an independent, 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation. The publication's mission statement is "to follow, educate, and inform members of The George Washington University and Foggy Bottom communities."  It also serves as the newspaper of record for the university's archives.

The GW Hatchet publishes 2,500 copies every Monday throughout the school semesters and a special freshman orientation issue during the summer recess.

All issues of The Hatchet are accessible through the Special Collections Research Center at the Estelle and Melvin Gelman Library, located at 2130 H Street NW, Washington, D.C.
