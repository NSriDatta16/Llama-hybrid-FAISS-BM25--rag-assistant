Sour Punch is a brand of sour candy, manufactured by American Licorice Company. It was one of the first brands to enter the sour candy market in the 1990s. The product is sold in five forms: Straws, Bites, Bits, Ropes, and Twists. Like many other sour candies, they are coated with sour sugar. One serving size of Sour Punch twists contains 150 calories. The candy is suitable for the lactose intolerant, as it does not contain any milk products.
