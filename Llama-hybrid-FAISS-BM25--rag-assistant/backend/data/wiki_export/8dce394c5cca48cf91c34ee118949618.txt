Blackfriars Priory School is a private Roman Catholic school for boys situated in Prospect, an inner-northern suburb of Adelaide, South Australia. It is conducted by the Dominican Friars of the Province of the Assumption.

History
The school opened in 1953 in its current location which was then a property called "St Catharine's". The house, which is now part of the school, was built for James Angas Johnson (1841–1909), a grandson of George Fife Angas.

Statue

In November 2017, Blackfriars covered up and eventually removed an outdoor statue of St. Martin de Porres after its "unintentionally provocative design . . . created a flurry of activity on social media, prompting the school to take quick action," according to a news report.

The statue depicted the figure of St. Martin "handing a young boy a loaf of bread, which appears to have emerged from his cloak." The boy's head is waist-high with the body of the priest. Students posted photos of it on social media, and the next week it was "cordoned off." A photo shows it covered with a black drape.

Principal Simon Cobiac said in a statement that another sculptor would refashion the statue.
