Bakersfield P.D. is an American television sitcom that aired on Fox from September 14, 1993 until August 18, 1994.

The show was based in the police department of the city of Bakersfield, California. It was shot with naturalistic lighting and without a laugh track. The show's theme song, "Busy Office Rhumba," was written by Mark Mothersbaugh and performed by Brave Combo.
