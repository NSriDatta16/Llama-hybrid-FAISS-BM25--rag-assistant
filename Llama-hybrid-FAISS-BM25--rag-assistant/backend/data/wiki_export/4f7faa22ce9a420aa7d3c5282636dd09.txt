Carlo Pagulayan (born June 24, 1978) is a Filipino freelance comic book artist.

Early life
He graduated with a bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering from the Santo Tomas branch campus of the Polytechnic University of the Philippines in Santo Tomas, Batangas.

Career
Pagulayan began his career with a 3-page sequential for Dark Horse Comics, written by Doug Petrie, to aid the victims of the 9-11 attacks, and as a tribute to the fallen World Trade Center Twin Towers (2001). He has since had assignments with both Marvel and DC, including runs on Elektra, Emma Frost, The Incredible Hulk, and Deathstroke.

He was a penciler on Marvel's popular Planet Hulk storyline, which was adapted into an 
animated feature film in 2010. Elements from the story were also incorporated into the Marvel Studios film Thor: Ragnarok (2017). Pagulayan co-created the Sakaaran race which have appeared in Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) and Avengers: Endgame (2019).
