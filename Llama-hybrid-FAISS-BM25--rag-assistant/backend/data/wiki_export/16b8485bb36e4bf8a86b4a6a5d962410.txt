Indian reserves 
In addition to 7,700 aboriginal persons listed in the regional district's community profile at Statistics Canada, there are four separate Indian reserve communities within the regional district whose populations are not included within the regional district's figures, and which are governed separately by their respective band governments. These Indian reserves are:
Old Massett (Masset Indian Reserve No. 1);
Skidegate (Skidegate Indian Reserve No. 1);
Metlakatla; and 
Lax Kw'alaams (Port Simpson Indian Reserve No. 1).

Past naming 
The Regional District had historically been called the Skeena-Queen Charlotte Regional District, referring to its location on the Skeena River and the Queen Charlotte archipelago. Once the Queen Charlottes were renamed Haidi Gwaii to reflect their Indigenous heritage, discussions began about renaming the Regional District to reflect the update. In September 2016, letters patent were granted renaming it to the North Coast Regional District
