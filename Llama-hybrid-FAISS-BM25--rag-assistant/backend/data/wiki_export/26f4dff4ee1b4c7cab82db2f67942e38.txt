You Can't Tell the People
Bruni wrote one book called You Can't Tell the People, a study of Britain's most famous UFO case, the Rendlesham Forest incident of December 1980. It was published in hardback by Sidgwick & Jackson in November 2000, and in paperback by Pan Macmillan in November 2001. The title comes from a quotation Bruni claims to have been spoken by Margaret Thatcher, Prime Minister at the time of the events in 1980: "UFOs! You must get your facts right and you can't tell the people".

The hardback edition was launched at media event held at the Ministry of Defence, alongside fellow UFO researcher Nick Pope.
