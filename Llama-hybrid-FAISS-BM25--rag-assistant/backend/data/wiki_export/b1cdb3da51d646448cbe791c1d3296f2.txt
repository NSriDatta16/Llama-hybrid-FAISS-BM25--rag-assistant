National teams

The association governs and controls the Zambian national men's and women's teams which represents the country in international association football. The men's national team was commonly known during the 1980s as the "KK 11" after Dr. Kenneth Kaunda ("KK"), the founder of Zambia who was its president from independence in 1964 until the shift to a democratic multiparty state in 1991 when it changed nicknames to the Chipolopolo or the "Copper Bullets".

The team has appeared in the final of the Africa Cup of Nations thrice, winning it once against Ivory Coast.
