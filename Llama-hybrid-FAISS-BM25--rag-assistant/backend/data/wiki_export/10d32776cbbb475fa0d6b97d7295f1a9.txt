School mission

Osceola Fundamental High School’s mission is "to sustain an environment where staff, students, parents and community work collaboratively to support all students in meeting or exceeding graduation requirements".

Fundamental status

Osceola describes itself as the first "fundamental" high school in Florida, meaning, according to the school website, that it is "like schools used to be". Parents and students must adhere to a set of guidelines for student conduct, homework submission, and parental involvement. Parents are required to attend monthly meetings, and sign all of their children's homework assignments.

Parents and students who do not comply with school policies are first given warnings, and if noncompliance continues, required to meet with the school-based Intervention and Appeal Committee (IAC), which may recommend alternatives and interventions for improvement, probation with stipulations, or removal from the school.
