In 1954, the United States FBI, under Director J. Edgar Hoover, continued for a fifth year to maintain a public list of the people it regarded as the Ten Most Wanted Fugitives.

1954 was again a very productive year for the FBI, as the Bureau listed and then also soon caught many fugitive top ten, often with help from citizens.  The Saturday Evening Post featured weekly articles about the top ten fugitives and was one of the key media outlets used by the FBI, often leading to recognition and capture of top ten fugitives.
