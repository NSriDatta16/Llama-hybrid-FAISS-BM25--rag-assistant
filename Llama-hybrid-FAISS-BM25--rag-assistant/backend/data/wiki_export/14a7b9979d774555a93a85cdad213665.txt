De La Salle University–Dasmariñas (), also referred to by its acronym DLSU-D or La Salle–Dasma, is a private Roman Catholic, Lasallian co-educational secondary and higher education institution run by the De La Salle Brothers of the Philippine District of the Christian Brothers in Dasmariñas, Philippines. It is a member of De La Salle Philippines, a network of 16 Lasallian educational institutions.

DLSU-D, despite its name, is an autonomous university separate from the De La Salle University in Manila. Both universities are members of the De La Salle Philippines System. Also, approximately  from it is the De La Salle Medical and Health Sciences Institute, a separate De La Salle campus that specializes in medicine and allied health education which is often mistaken as part of DLSU-D due to the proximity of both campuses.

History
The university was established on July 18, 1977, as a private, nonsectarian tertiary school named General Emilio Aguinaldo College-Cavite and managed by the Yaman Lahi Foundation. In 1987, ownership and management were transferred to Frère (St.) Bénilde Romançon Educational Foundation Inc., a sister corporation of De La Salle University-Manila. It became a Catholic institution under the name De La Salle University-Emilio Aguinaldo College. In 1992, the name DLSU-EAC was changed to De La Salle University-Aguinaldo. In 1997, the institution's name was changed again. It is presently known as De La Salle University–Dasmariñas to avoid confusion with the Emilio Aguinaldo College Cavite campus.

Human Lasallian Star
The Lasallian "Signum Fidei" Sign of Faith Star is a 350-year-old international symbol of the Christian Brothers of the De La Salle Schools that represents their religious vocation of quality God-centered, Christian-values-based education in 1,500 Lasallian institutions with 70 Universities and Colleges that are globally established by Saint La Salle's Christian Brothers in 82 countries.  The Signum Fidei Lasallian was inspired by the Nativity Christmas Star from Bethlehem that symbolized Saint La Salle's mission of Teaching Minds, Touching Hearts, and Transforming Lives of the very poor. The Lasallian mission was to give hope to the Last, Least, and the Lost of the most venerable youth in our society.

The Human Lasallian Signum Fidei Star first came to life on February 11, 2009, during the Lasallian Days Festival as a means to encourage all Lasallians to show their school spirit in an environment of camaraderie and shared ideals. Attended by over 10,000 administrators, students, and faculty, the first attempt to form the largest human star in the world was held at the DLSU-D oval and was witnessed by spectators from the top of the CBA building and the DLSU-D grandstand. The star spanned approximately 71  meters, and occupied a total area of 2,145 square meters.

DLSU-D attempted the feat again on January 26, 2010, this time at night. The event drew in 13,000 participants: students, faculty, administrators, and parents. Participants were given the glow sticks of green and white, the school colors of De La Salle. As night fell, the crowd assembled into a huge star twinkling brightly against the darkness. This moment of history was further heightened by the singing of the school hymn.

Another attempt was made on June 17, 2012 at DLSU-D Grandstand. Around 25,000 Lasallians and supporters of La Salle became part of the star and contributed to reaching the target of raising P2.5 million for the scholarship fund. The star formation was part of the closing ceremonies of the centennial celebration of the Lasallian presence in the Philippines. It also signalled the opening of the upcoming Jubilee celebration of DLSU-D’s 25th year as a Lasallian institution.

La Estrella Verde
La Estrella Verde (LEV) is the official Senior High School (SHS) student publication of De La Salle University–Dasmariñas. Founded and established in 2016, the publication serves as a medium (through print, online, and radio) for students to be aware of all current events and latest updates happening around the senior high school community.
Its name translates to "The Green Star."

ANIMOSAIC 2: Humans of St. La Salle
De La Salle University-Dasmariñas (DLSU-D) had broken records with its human formation of the Lasallian Signum Fidei Star and a coin mural of the school logo. To commemorate the 300th feast day of its founder, thousands of people held color-coded umbrellas to form the largest image of Saint Jean-Baptiste de La Salle at the DLSU-D Track Oval on Sunday, April 7, 2019. About 6,000 students, employees, and stakeholders of DLSU-D participated in the fundraising event dubbed "Animosaic 2: Humans of St La Salle." The fundraising event is dedicated to all the scholars and aspiring scholars of DLSU-D. Seeking to beat the record set by China after it formed a giant human smiley with 3,099 participants in 2016, Lasallians made their own bid for the record with some 6,000 Lasallians forming the image of Saint Jean-Baptiste de La Salle, the university name as well as the #300LaSalle which signifies the 300th death anniversary of the Father Founder. The event is made more significant as it was celebrated with the Feast Day of St. La Salle. The event is also consistent with Lasallian institutions all around the world making their own human formations of the image of Saint Jean-Baptiste de La Salle as part of the Humans of St. La Salle initiative.
