The Sergeant John F. Baker Jr. Bridge, also known as the Baker Bridge or  Interstate 280 Bridge, carries InterstateÂ 280 (I-280) across the Mississippi River between Davenport, Iowa, and Rock Island, Illinois. The bridge opened in 1973 with a blue and yellow color scheme, thought to be unique in the state.  In 2007, it was repainted all blue.  On July 30, 2010, the bridge was officially named the  Sergeant John F. Baker Jr. Bridge.

On May 2, 2019, the bridge, along with several other bridges in the Quad Cities area, were temporarily closed to all traffic due to severe flooding of the Mississippi River and the Rock River, and a subsequent levee breach in Davenport.
