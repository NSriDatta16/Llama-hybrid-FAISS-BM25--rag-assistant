Howard George Hendricks (April 5, 1924 â€“ February 20, 2013) was a longtime professor at Dallas Theological Seminary and speaker for Promise Keepers. Upon his graduation from Dallas, Hendricks accepted the pastorate at Calvary Independent Presbyterian Church (now Calvary Bible Church) in Fort Worth, Texas. An opening on the seminary staff led Hendricks to begin teaching twice per week in the fall of 1951.  After one year on staff, Hendricks resigned his post to pursue a doctorate at Yale University.  However, the founder and president of Dallas Theological Seminary, Lewis Sperry Chafer, died and the new president, John Walvoord, asked Hendricks to delay his doctorate and return to Dallas as a teacher.

For over fifty years, Howard G. Hendricks was a professor at Dallas Theological Seminary, where he taught "Bible Exposition and Hermeneutics" to freshmen.  He mentored many Christian leaders, including Chuck Swindoll, Tony Evans, Joseph Stowell, Robert Jeffress, Chip Ingram and David Jeremiah.

He was a keynote speaker for Promise Keepers and authored sixteen books. He  ministered in over 80 countries, and he also served as chaplain for the Dallas Cowboys football team from 1976 to 1984.

In 1986, the Howard G. Hendricks Center for Christian Leadership opened on the Dallas Theological Seminary campus. This ministry attempts to develop Christian leaders and future church curricula through a process of mentoring.
