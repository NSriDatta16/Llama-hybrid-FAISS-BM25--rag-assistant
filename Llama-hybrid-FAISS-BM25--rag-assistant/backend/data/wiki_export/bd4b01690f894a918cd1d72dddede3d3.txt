The Metropolitan, or The Met as it is commonly called, is the school newspaper of Metropolitan State University of Denver. It has a weekly press run of 700 copies, which are distributed every Wednesday to more than 60 locations across the Auraria Campus and select locations in downtown Denver. The paper is a tabloid style publication with sections for news, sports, opinions, features and music. It focuses on issues of interest and concern to students at Metro and the other colleges located on the Auraria Campus.

The editorial direction and content of The Metropolitan are entirely student-run. The staff of The Metropolitan comprises MSU Denver students, most of whom work on a strictly volunteer basis. An editorial staff of about 10 students, including section editors, copy editors, photo editors and an editor-in-chief direct a larger staff of about 10-15 reporters, photographers, columnists and artists. The Metropolitan is supported through advertising revenue, although it does receive funding through student fees.

The Metropolitan is produced in the Office of Student Media, which also produces a literary and arts magazine, a news broadcast, a radio station and websites. The publications and broadcasts produced in the Office of Student media have won hundreds of awards from organizations such as the Society of Professional Journalists, Rocky Mountain Collegiate Press Association, and the Associated Collegiate Press. The Office of Student Media is run by a director and assistant director.

History

In 1979, staff from previous student publications, The Paper, Cherry Creek Pioneer and The Auraria Times joined together and started The Metropolitan. Emerson Schwartzkopf, and Steve Werges are credited for launching The Metropolitan, they were assisted by Frank X Mullen, Sal Ruibal, and S. Peter Duray-Bito, Metropolitan State University of Denver’s current student newspaper.

The original newspaper offices were located in the Plaza Building. After the renovations on the Tivoli Student Union were completed in 1994, The Metropolitan moved to its current office at the Tivoli for a larger working and production space.

Since 1982, Kate Lutrey, Carson Reed, Doug Conarroe, Doug Bell, Kenn Bisio, Dianne Harrison-Miller, Steve Haigh, Alfonzo Porter and Chris DeRozier have all at one time held the Director of Student Media position.

A major point in history for The Metropolitan occurred in 1992 when Editor Shawn Christopher Cox requested the names of the candidates running for the Dean of Letters, Arts and Sciences position. A six-week battle ensued between The Metropolitan staff who wanted to release those names to the public and members of the search committee, including Jodi Wetzel, who would not give up the information.  Finally, in December 1992, Cox obtained the names of the three candidates and printed them in the Dec. 4 issue of The Metropolitan.  This remains an important time in The Metropolitan’s history since the requested information was and still is public record, but there continues to be debate over whether names of Metro candidates should be released on the basis for the candidate’s privacy.

Awards

In 2006, The Metropolitan won the award for Best All-Around Non-Daily Student Newspaper from the Society of Professional Journalists. The staff that year also received two winning photography awards from SPJ.
