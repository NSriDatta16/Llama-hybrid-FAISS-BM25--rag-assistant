2015 season
The Kitchener Panthers had a great start to the 2015 season, first defeating the Toronto Maple Leafs, followed by a great pitching performance the following week in Barrie, Ontario, defeating the Barrie Baycats. They then went on to defeat the Guelph Royals and Brantford Red Sox. They were in 2nd place after 4 games, going 4-0 only behind the London Majors, who started 7–0.

The Panthers' field was being reconstructed so even though their season started in early May, their home opener wasn't until May 28, 2015. In the home opener they played the Burlington Bandits and lost 8–7. Coach Tebo was ejected from the game for arguing a bad call by the umpire. The next Panthers game was on Friday, May 29, against the Hamilton Cardinals in Hamilton. The Panthers clinched the playoffs 2nd, and they faced the Hamilton Cardinals in the first round in 5 games. The second round went to 7 games against the London Majors. The Panthers won that, so they will play the Barrie Baycats in the finals with game 1 beginning Tuesday, August 25. The Panthers lost the series 4 games to 1 and Barrie won its 2nd straight IBL Championship.
