Lostock is a residential district of Bolton, Greater Manchester, England,  west of Bolton town centre and  northwest of Manchester. Historically part of Lancashire, Lostock is bounded by Deane to the southeast, Markland Hill to the northeast, and Middlebrook to the west. Bolton Wanderers' football ground, the University of Bolton Stadium, is in nearby Horwich.

After a railway station was built to serve the area in 1852, the area around the station – some  east of Lostock Hall – became known as Lostock Junction. This name is still in use, although the station's name has changed to Lostock.

History
The name derives from Old English hlose a pig and stoc meaning a farm, usually 'stock' or 'Stoke' in place-names, but here referring to a pigsty. Another source suggested that the name is derived from Celtic, llostog meaning beaver, inferring the site of a stream where beavers were found, the reasoning due to the proliferation of Brythonic and Celtic place-names in Lancashire. It has been variously recorded as Lostoc in 1212; Lastok in 1279; Lostok in 1292; Lostoke in 1301 and Lostock and Lostocke in the 16th century.

In the Middle Ages Lostock was part of the barony of Manchester. It was subsequently held by Richard de Hulton and passed to the Andertons and the Blundells of Ince. Lostock Hall was an Elizabethan manor house built for the Anderton family in 1563. The hall was demolished in 1824, but the gatehouse remains and is a Grade II* listed building.

During World War II, De Havilland aircraft propellers were produced at Lostock.

Local government
Lostock was a township in the ancient Parish of Bolton le Moors, in the hundred of Salford, in the historic county of Lancashire. In 1837 Lostock joined with other townships (or civil parishes) in the area to form the Bolton Poor Law Union and took joint responsibility for the administration and funding of the Poor Law in that area. In 1866, Lostock became a civil parish, and in 1894 it became part of the Bolton Rural District, which was dissolved in 1898. Under the Bolton, Turton and Westhoughton Extension Act of 1898, Lostock ceased to be a civil parish and became part of the County Borough of Bolton.

Lostock is part of the Heaton and Lostock Ward, one of twenty wards in the Metropolitan Borough of Bolton. The population of the ward at the 2011 Census was 13,564. The ward has three councillors who are elected for up to four years and represent the Lostock and Heaton areas.

Geography
Lostock was a hamlet covering 1,364 acres of land 4½ miles west of Bolton. Chew Moor in the southwest was the principal settlement of the township, it was a cluster of cottages housing the landless labourers and tenant farmers.

In 1974, Lostock became part of the Deane-cum-Heaton Ward of the Metropolitan Borough of Bolton. In the 2001 Census the ward had a population of 16,987. In 2004, electoral ward changes took place which saw the creation of the present Heaton and Lostock Ward.
