Munich massacre

Kehat was among the Israelis  taken hostage and murdered by Black September terrorists at the 1972 Summer Olympics. The Israeli team was sleeping in their quarters in the early morning hours of 5 September 1972, when the terrorists raided the compound, murdered two of the Israeli athletes and took the others hostage. Kehat Shorr was photographed standing next to fellow coach Andre Spitzer at the second-floor window of their besieged building while terrorists trained guns on the pair. The German authorities failed to rescue 9 hostages, including Kehat Shorr, resulting in their deaths. Shorr's team members, Henry Hershkowitz and Zelig Stroch, survived the attack.
