"You Wear It Well" is a song written by Rod Stewart and Martin Quittenton, performed by Stewart. It uses an arrangement markedly similar to that of "Maggie May", one of Stewart's hits from the previous year.

Stewart recorded "You Wear It Well" for the 1972 album Never a Dull Moment, and released it as a single on 12 August. The song became an international hit, reaching number one on the UK Singles Chart. In the US, "You Wear It Well" peaked at number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.

Upon the release of the single, Record World felt that it "could equal ['Maggie May's] phenomenal success."

Stewart performed the song live on BBC's Top of the Pops with the full lineup of Faces, along with Quittenton on classical guitar and Dick "Tricky Dicky" Powell on fiddle joining them. A live version of the song from his 2013 performance at the Troubadour, West Hollywood was included on the deluxe edition of the album Time.
