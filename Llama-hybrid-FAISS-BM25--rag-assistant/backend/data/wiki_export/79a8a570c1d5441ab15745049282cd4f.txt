Publication history

Original series 
In response to the restrictions imposed by the Comics Code Authority, DC began a new science-fiction series in 1956. The series featured artwork by Murphy Anderson, Gil Kane, and many others, with stories by John Broome, Gardner Fox, and additional writers. It was an anthology comic for many years, publishing a variety of science fiction stories. The series featured Space Ranger as of issue #40 and running through #82 (April–May 1964). Other features included the "Green Glob" (issues #83–98, 100, 102, 103) and "Automan" (issues #91, 94, 97).  The series' last issue as Tales of the Unexpected was #104 (December 1967–January 1968). As of issue #105 (February–March 1968), the title was shortened to The Unexpected.

2006 limited series 
DC revived the title for an eight-issue miniseries in 2006, focusing on the Crispus Allen incarnation of the Spectre, with a back-up series featuring Doctor Thirteen.

The back-up feature starred a team made up of Thirteen and his daughter Traci, I…Vampire, Genius Jones, Captain Fear, Infectious Lass, Anthro, the Primate Patrol, and the Haunted Tank. It was written by Brian Azzarello and drawn by Cliff Chiang.
