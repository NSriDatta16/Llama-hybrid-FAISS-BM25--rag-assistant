Origins
The idea of a standardized test was discussed in the 1960s by the Ministry of Education. In the 1970s, the exam became a reality following approval by the government and ruling party. It was intended to reduce the exam stress encountered by high school seniors battling for a place in their choice of college.

A decision was made in 1988 to change the name of the exam, and this was implemented in 1990.
