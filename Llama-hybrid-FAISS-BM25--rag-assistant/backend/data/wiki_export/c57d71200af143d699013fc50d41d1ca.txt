Early life
Branum was born and raised in Yuba City, California to a Protestant father and Jewish mother. He attended the University of California, Berkeley from 1994-1998 where he was a history and political science major. He wrote a column for the Daily Californian, one of which brought the United States Secret Service to his apartment in November 1997 before the Big Game between Berkeley and Stanford University, in which the Associated Press misquoted parts of his article, suggesting that he made suggestions that Berkeley students murder Stanford freshman Chelsea Clinton.

He then moved to Minnesota, where he attended the University of Minnesota Law School, and was on the school's Quiz Bowl team that placed third at CBI nationals in 1999. During his time in law school, he publicly came out as gay. After graduating, he returned to California.

Career 
After being recommended by co-hostess Laura Swisher, Branum was hired as a writer for Unscrewed with Martin Sargent while it was still on TechTV in San Francisco. On Unscrewed, he regularly appeared as a sweater model and as The Ambassador of Gay. He was also a writer and producer on G4tv.com, and head writer on the G4 channel program X-Play. He also contributed to the comedy podcast Weezy and the Swish. In December 2007, Branum became a writer and an onscreen comedy performer on Chelsea Lately. He made his feature film debut in January 2011 in No Strings Attached. In 2012 Branum became a writer for the show Totally Biased with W. Kamau Bell, performing a recurring segment "No More Mr. Nice Gay." He appeared in the eighth season of Last Comic Standing. In 2017, Branum performed at the inaugural Portland Queer Comedy Festival.

He was the host and executive producer of Talk Show The Game Show on TruTV, which was canceled in November 2018.

He was the regular host of Pop Rocket, a podcast that dissects popular culture, on the Maximum Fun network, which was cancelled in May 2019.

His book My Life As A Goddess: A Memoir Through (Un)Popular Culture was published in 2018 with a foreword by Mindy Kaling.

He is a frequent guest on the podcasts Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! and Doug Loves Movies with Doug Benson.

Branum released his first comedy album, Effable, in 2015 on ASpecialThing Records.
