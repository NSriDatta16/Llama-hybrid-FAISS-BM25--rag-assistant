The Pick, the Sickle and the Shovel is the second studio album by hip hop supergroup Gravediggaz. Released on September 16, 1997, via Gee Street, V2 and BMG Records, the album has a more socially conscious sound and is considerably calmer than its predecessor; it features heavy production input by the RZA and his production team the Wu Elements.

In contrast to the group's debut album, Prince Paul had less involvement in the production of this album. He did produce the outro and the skit preceding "Hidden Emotions." He was still billed as an official member of the group, however, and appeared on the cover and inserts of the album.

Two singles were released from the album, "Dangerous Mindz" and "The Night the Earth Cried," though neither made it to the Billboard charts.

Critical reception
Spin called the album a "fanciful dystopia," writing that "each rap suggests a creative act of desperation."

Rolling Stone (9/18/97, p. 104) – 3 stars (out of 5) – "...an exotic, multilayered soundscape that is often melancholic, but also melodic....the Gravediggaz deliver plenty to sink your pick into."

Entertainment Weekly (10/31/97, p. 108) – "...guest rappers Killah Priest, Omen, and Hell Razor spin oblique horror stories from ghetto hell over bruising beats by RZA and Prince Paul." – Rating: B

Vibe (11/97, p. 149) – "This second offering from Gravediggaz...finds the Wu-Tang boardsman moving away from production and immersing himself fully in the power of words....RZA is a master MC."

Option (11-12/97, p. 100) – "Individually, it seems the Gravediggaz are trying to outdo each other (and every other MC) by writing and rapping denser, more complex rhymes than anybody....they maintain remarkable flow."

Melody Maker (09/13/97, p. 50) – "...machetes injustice, decapitates the real criminals, and burys the lot of 'em in a festering, snake-filled pit."

Rap Pages (11/97, p. 110) – "There's a lifetime supply of meta-force wordplay for the heads, enough braggadocio for the hard-core and plenty of hooks for the pop quadrant."
