History
The school was founded in 1786 by members of the Religious Society of Friends to offer education in a setting that would honor Quaker values. A one-room brick building on Haddon Avenue, adjacent to the Meeting burial ground, housed the school. Haddonfield Free School, as they named it, served the children of both Friends and non-Friends, and was the only "public" school in Haddonfield for about 25 years.

Additional classroom space is used at the Meeting House, located on Friends Avenue directly behind the school. The Early Childhood Center is home to the school's youngest students ages two and a half years to five years. The remainder of the students, Kindergarten through Eighth grade, along with the special subject area classrooms, are located in the main school building at 47 N. Haddon Avenue.
