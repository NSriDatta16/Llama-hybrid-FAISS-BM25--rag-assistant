I Love Toys is a miniseries on VH1 and the eighth installment of the I Love the... series that premiered on March 6, 2006.  It is a countdown of the 100 greatest toys, chosen partially through public voting on vh1.com and also consideration of "sales, historical significance and longevity," according to VH1.

Each day for 5 days, they would count down from 100 to 1, which is 20 toys per episode. Parts 1-4 were each one hour long, while Part 5 was a special 90-minute edition aired on March 10, 2006. As with the other nostalgia series, the program included commentary by various entertainers, including several who had appeared in most or all of the other shows, such as actor Michael Ian Black, comedian/actress Rachael Harris, Scientologist comedian Evan Wecksell and writer/satirist Mo Rocca.

Hasbro, Inc., turned the selection of a large number of its toys into a press release promoting the company.
