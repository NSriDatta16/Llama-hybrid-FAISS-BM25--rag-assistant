Come and Get These Memories is the debut album by the American girl group Martha and the Vandellas, released in 1963. Put out by Gordy after the success of the trio's hit of the same name, the album also contains the group's debut single, "I'll Have to Let Him Go", which was originally intended for Mary Wells, and "A Love Like Yours (Don't Come Knocking Everyday)". Most of the album was produced by Holland–Dozier–Holland and William "Mickey" Stevenson.

Former member Gloria Williams originally sang lead on the song "There He Is (At My Door)" and Martha Reeves later revealed in her autobiography that the song was re-recorded after Williams left with her on lead vocals. Williams backing vocals on "I'll Have to Let Him Go" is her only album appearance. This album also includes a cover version of "Tears on My Pillow" by Little Anthony and the Imperials, and standards like "Moments to Remember".
