Middlesbrough Council, formerly known as Middlesbrough Borough Council, is the unitary authority for the Borough of Middlesbrough, North Yorkshire, England. The authority has combined some duties with nearby councils to form the Tees Valley Combined Authority. Middlesbrough Council's area had a resident population in 2001 of 134,855. The borough has two parishes, which are entitled to an additional lower-tier council, Nunthorpe and Stainton and Thornton.

History
Middlesbrough Borough Council was formed on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, from part of the former County Borough of Teesside, along with the parish of Nunthorpe from the Stokesley Rural District.  It was a district, and the county town of the new county of Cleveland from 1 April 1974, until 1996. As a district, it was one of the four constituent districts of Cleveland: Cleveland being the upper tier in the two-tier system. 

When Cleveland was abolished following the Banham Review in 1996, Middlesbrough became a unitary authority and as such took on all local government powers and responsibilities. It was once again part of North Yorkshire, but only ceremonially, and not locally administered and governed by the North Yorkshire Council.

Coat of arms

The motto  ("We shall be" in Latin) was adopted, it reflects  ("We have been") of the Bruce clan which were Cleveland's mediaeval lords.

The original arms was granted to the Middlesbrough Rural District in 1911 by William Hylton Dyer Longstaffe. The town's coat of arms were three ships representing shipbuilding and maritime trade and an azure (blue) lion, the latter also from the Bruce clan. It was regranted in 1996 with slight modifications after the dissolution of Cleveland  county: a star replaced the middle ship, this is from Captain James Cook's coat of arms.
