Under the production of Organized Noize (TLC's "Waterfalls"), the group released their self-titled debut album, which produced the hit single "Blackberry Molasses". However, the album did not follow in the same success and despite a second album being produced by Tim & Bob, it was never released. Due to management issues the group split in 1997.
