Sweat is the eighteenth studio album by the band Kool & the Gang, released in 1989 following a three-year gap between albums. James "J.T." Taylor, Khalis Bayyan and Robert "Spike" Mickens had departed, and this album showed a refocused band.

Singles
Both "Raindrops" (peak #27) and "Never Give Up" (peak #74) on the Billboard Hot Soul Songs chart.

Critical reception

Ron Wynn of AllMusic called the album "a completely faceless, aimless record ... probably the worst album of their career". Hugh Wyatt of the New York Daily News called Sweat "one of the year's best recordings".
