The National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP), formerly the National Committee on Radiation Protection and Measurements, and before that the Advisory Committee on X-Ray and Radium Protection (ACXRP), is a U.S. organization.  It has a congressional charter under Title 36 of the United States Code, but this does not imply any sort of oversight by Congress; NCRP is not a government entity.

History
The Advisory Committee on X-Ray and Radium Protection was established in 1929. Initially, the organization was an informal collective of scientists seeking to proffer accurate information and appropriate recommendations for radiation protection. In 1946, the organization changed its name to the National Committee on Radiation Protection and Measurements.

In 1964, the U.S. Congress reorganized and chartered the organization as the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements.
