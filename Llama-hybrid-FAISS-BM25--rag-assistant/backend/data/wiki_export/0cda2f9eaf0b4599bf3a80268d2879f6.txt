Louhans-Cuiseaux Football Club is a football club located in Louhans, France.

History
The club was founded in 1970 as Club Sportif Louhans Cuiseaux 71 after the merger of Club Sportif Louhannais (founded in 1916) and Club de Cuiseaux (founded in 1930), based in the villages of Louhans and Cuiseaux. It took the current name after a further merger with FC Louhans in 2013.  The club currently competes in the Championnat National 3, the fifthlevel of the French football league system, following relegation in 2023, and plays at the Stade du Bram.
