History
The original station opened on 15 February 1849 as Dundalk Junction (being located at the Junction of the Dublin-Belfast line and the Dundalk and Enniskillen line), the current Dundalk Station, 350m to the north, opened in June 1894. It was given the name Clarke on Sunday 10 April 1966 in commemoration of Tom Clarke, one of the executed leaders of the Easter Rising of 1916.

Architecture
The ticket office and modern waiting area are located at road level, whereas the station proper is beneath this at track level. The two sections are connected by a Victorian covered walkway, and by a 21st-century lift for disabled access. The station is noted for its fine iron, glass, and polychromic brickwork. It has been said to be the finest station on the Dublin-Belfast line.
