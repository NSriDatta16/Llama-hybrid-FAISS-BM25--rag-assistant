All Jacked Up is the second studio album by American country music artist Gretchen Wilson, released on September 27, 2005, by Epic Nashville. It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with 264,000 copies sold in its initial week. The album's title track served as its lead-off single. Debuting at No. 21 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts, it set what was then the record for the highest-debuting single by a female country artist. "All Jacked Up" went on to peak at No. 8 on the country charts, and was followed by three more singles: "I Don't Feel Like Loving You Today" (No. 22), "Politically Uncorrect" (No. 23), and "California Girls" (No. 25). Overall, All Jacked Up was certified platinum by the RIAA for shipments of one million copies in the U.S.

Also featured on this album are "He Ain't Even Cold Yet" (which was originally recorded by Ken Mellons on his 1995 album Where Forever Begins) and a remake of Billie Holiday's pop standard "Good Morning Heartache".
