Pedro VI or Mbemba was King of Kongo from 1896 to 1910. When he succeeded in 1896, he was too young so his uncle Henrique IV was regent until 1901. He died in 1910. It is rumoured that he may have been a grandfather of Jos√© Eduardo dos Santos. His oldest son, Nkomba, was there to succeed him in 1910 (and then he died a year later).
