Rock and Roll Heart is the seventh solo studio album by American musician Lou Reed, released in October 1976. It was his first album for Arista Records after record mogul Clive Davis reportedly rescued him from bankruptcy. "A Sheltered Life" dates back to 1967, when the Velvet Underground recorded a demo of it (available on Peel Slowly and See).  The Velvet Underground also performed "Follow the Leader", and a live recording of it was released on The Quine Tapes (2001).

The cover art is credited to Mick Rock.
