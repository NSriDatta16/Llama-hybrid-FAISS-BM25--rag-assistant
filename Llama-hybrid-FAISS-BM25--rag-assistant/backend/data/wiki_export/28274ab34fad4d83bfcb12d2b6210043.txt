Godhead was Lowlife's third album, released in 1990 in Scotland on Nightshift Records, an independent music record label.  The LP had been recorded at Pet Sounds Studios in Glasgow, Scotland. Prior to the recording of the album, original guitarist Stuart Everest had been asked to leave the group by the other band members, and was replaced by Hamish McIntosh.  LTM Recordings reissued much of the band's entire back catalogue on CD, and released Godhead in August 2006, with five bonus tracks taken from the band's unreleased "Black Sessions" demo album.

The album received critical acclaim, but not a significant amount of mainstream attention. Martin Aston, of Music Week  said of the album: "Lowlife's Godhead takes us back to that classic case of a band who never reap enough acclaim because they won't play the game, but they deserve serious attention" The Catalogue gave the album 4 stars, stating: "Lowlife cast aside past references and perceptions with the most evocatively impressive music. It would be unforgivable if this album remains totally unnoticed"
