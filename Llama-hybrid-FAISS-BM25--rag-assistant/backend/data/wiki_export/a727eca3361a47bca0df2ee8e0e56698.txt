Background

Prior to the 2006 contest, Switzerland had participated in the Eurovision Song Contest forty-six times since its first entry in 1956. Switzerland is noted for having won the first edition of the Eurovision Song Contest with the song "Refrain" performed by Lys Assia. Their second and, to this point, most recent victory was achieved in 1988 when Canadian singer Céline Dion won the contest with the song "Ne partez pas sans moi". Following the introduction of semi-finals for the , Switzerland had managed to participate in the final one time up to this point. In 2005, the internal selection of Estonian girl band Vanilla Ninja, performing the song "Cool Vibes", qualified Switzerland to the final where they placed 8th.

The Swiss national broadcaster, SRG SSR idée suisse, broadcasts the event within Switzerland and organises the selection process for the nation's entry. SRG SSR idée suisse confirmed their intentions to participate at the 2006 Eurovision Song Contest on 22 July 2005. Along with their participation confirmation, the broadcaster also announced that the Swiss entry for the 2006 contest would be selected internally. Switzerland has selected their entry for the Eurovision Song Contest through both national finals and internal selections in the past. Since 2005, the Swiss entry was internally selected for the competition.

Before Eurovision

Internal selection 
On 22 July 2005, SRG SSR idée suisse opened a submission period for interested composers to submit their songs until 14 October 2005. On 14 December 2005, the broadcaster announced that Ralph Siegel and Bernd Meinunger had written the song that would represent Switzerland in Athens. Siegel had previously composed 17 Eurovision entries for various countries, 14 of them which were written by Meinunger. Meinunger had also written the Swiss entry in 2005 (under the pseudonym John O'Flynn). The song was selected by a jury panel consisting of representatives of the three broadcasters in Switzerland: the Swiss-German/Romansh broadcaster Schweizer Fernsehen der deutschen und rätoromanischen Schweiz (SF DRS), the Swiss-French broadcaster Télévision Suisse Romande (TSR) and the Swiss-Italian broadcaster Televisione svizzera di lingua italiana (TSI). 

Performer auditions took place between 25 and 27 November 2005 at the Olympia Studios in Munich where Siegel together with an expert panel consisting of representatives of SF DRS, TSR and RSI selected six artists from six different countries to form the group six4one for the Eurovision Song Contest. Eligible artists were those that have had television and stage experience (live performances), have made at least one video and have released at least one CD which placed among the top 50 in an official chart. "If We All Give a Little" was presented to the public as the song on 18 March 2006 during the SF1 show Benissimo.
