Atlantic Records Group LLC is an umbrella label owned by Warner Music Group. It oversees several labels assigned to its Atlantic Records unit. In total, the label group has nearly three hundred artists on its roster.

History
In 2004, Time Warner sold Warner Music to a group of private investors. As a cost-cutting maneuver, the new owners of Warner Music Group merged Atlantic Records with its sister, Elektra Records, to form The Atlantic Records Group. Upon the merger, Elektra became largely dormant, with most of its retained roster absorbed by Atlantic.  In the years to follow, Atlantic Records Group would add a host of other labels to its umbrella, including: Roadrunner Records, Fueled by Ramen, Custard Records and Maybach Music Group. Elektra was reactivated as a brand of Atlantic Records Group in 2009. The same year Atlantic's dance and hip hop imprint Big Beat Records, which scored notable success for most of the 1990s (but had been in hibernation since 1998) was also relaunched.

On June 18, 2018,  Warner Music Group announced the formation of Elektra Music Group to be launched as a stand-alone, independently managed primary label at WMG on October 1.  Splitting off from Atlantic Records Group, EMG will take with it five labels that previously operated under the Atlantic group (including Elektra Records), three label staff, and a handful of major artists. Elektra's independence renews the WEA (Warner-Elektra-Atlantic) triad that had for decades mark the original company organization. Elektra co-presidents, however, will answer to Atlantic Records Group Chairman/CEO Craig Kallman and Chairman/COO Julie Greenwald.

In 2020, Atlantic Records announced the relaunching of its original subsidiary label Atco Records, under the authority of its A&R President Pete Ganbarg. This reactivation of Atco Records marks the first time in over 25 years that the label has actively operated under the Atlantic Records umbrella.
