In his testimony to the legislature, Campbell claimed that the 20-year for prosecution window wasn't fair and would curtail the church's charitable work. In the end, the Assembly passed the legislation with a 10-year window.

After Heidtman filed suit, two other students came forward with accusations again Bennett.  The diocese settled the lawsuit with Heidtman in 2020 for $1 million.
