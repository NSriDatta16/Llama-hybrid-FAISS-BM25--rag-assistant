Love You Till Tuesday is a compilation of 1960s material by David Bowie, issued as a companion to the belated video release of Bowie's 1969 promotional film Love You Till Tuesday.

Deram, Bowie's record label from 1966 to mid-1969, released the soundtrack to the film. Due to its release when Bowie was a star, this has often been confused with his debut album. It does share some songs with the 1967 LP, but most of it was remixed in 1984. It was the first release to feature the original version of "Space Oddity", "Ching-a-Ling" and "When I'm Five", and also included previously unreleased versions of "Sell Me A Coat" and "When I Live My Dream".

In 1992, Pickwick Records reissued the compilation on CD, featuring a modified track list and a different cover. In addition to reordering the tracks, it also featured different versions of "Space Oddity", "Ching-A-Ling", "Love You Till Tuesday", "Rubber Band" and "When I Live My Dream". The first two are longer versions (the vinyl version had the shorter "film edit" version of "Space Oddity") while the last three were replaced by the versions from the 1967 album.
