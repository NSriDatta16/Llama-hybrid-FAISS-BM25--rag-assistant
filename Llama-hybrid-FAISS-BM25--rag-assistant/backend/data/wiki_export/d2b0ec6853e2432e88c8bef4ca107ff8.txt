History
Rückingen was first mentioned in 1173 as "Rukkingin".
Langendiebach was first mentioned in 1226 as "Dyppach".  In 1937 the Luftwaffe built an airfield known as Langendiebach Fliegerhorst.  World War II limited plans to expand it into a larger airfield.  Glider and nightfighter units of the German Air Force stationed here participated in the 1939 invasion of Poland and the 1944-45 defense of Germany against allied invasion.  Multiple bombings by allied forces rendered the airfield unserviceable by the war's end.  Under the name Fliegerhorst Kaserne American forces occupied the facilities from 1945 until 2007 with artillery, aviation, ordnance, quartermaster, transportation, meteorological, and military police units.
