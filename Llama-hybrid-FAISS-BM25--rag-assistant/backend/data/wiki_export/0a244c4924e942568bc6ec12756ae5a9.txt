The pudendal canal (also called Alcock's canal) is an anatomical structure formed by the obturator fascia (fascia of the obturator internus muscle) lining the lateral wall of the ischioanal fossa. The internal pudendal artery and  veins, and pudendal nerve pass through the pudendal canal, and the perineal nerve arises within it.

Clinical significance 
Pudendal nerve entrapment can occur when the pudendal nerve is compressed while it passes through the pudendal canal.

History 
The pudendal canal is also known as Alcock's canal, named after Benjamin Alcock.
