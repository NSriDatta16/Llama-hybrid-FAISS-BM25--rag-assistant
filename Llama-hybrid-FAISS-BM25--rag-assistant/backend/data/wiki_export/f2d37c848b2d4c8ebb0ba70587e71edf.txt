The Centre for Contemporary Photography (CCP), in Fitzroy, Melbourne, Victoria, is a venue for the exhibition of contemporary photo-based arts, providing a context for the enjoyment, education, understanding and appraisal of contemporary practice.

History
Established in 1986 as the Victorian Centre for Photography (VCP) by representatives of the photographic community on advice of Bernie O’Regan (1938–1996) who completed a study of its feasibility in the previous year, the VCP's first space was a shopfront on Rathdowne Street in Carlton, an inner suburb of Melbourne. It was supported by funding from the Victorian Ministry for the Arts and from the Australia Council for the Arts and issued an irregular newsletter to members. The organisation developed from a small community operation for local photographers and developed to encompass photographers Australia-wide and international in its program of exhibitions and publications. A major contribution was the survey exhibition and publication The Thousand Mile Stare which toured the nation through 1988 to 1989 which has become a reference point in the late twentieth history of Australian photography.

VCP moved to larger quarters at 205 Johnston Street, Fitzroy and shortly after changed its name to Centre for Contemporary Photography in the early 1990s to reflect its contemporary orientation. In 2005, CCP relocated to 404 George Street, Fitzroy, in purpose-designed premises by Sean Godsell Architects.

As a not-for-profit exhibition and resource centre, CCP has played a role in the support of photo-based arts across its spectrum and public engagement with photography. Major artists who have exhibited at CCP include Leah King-Smith, Gregory Crewdson, Robert Rooney, Kohei Yoshiyuki, Taryn Simon, Jane Burton, John Stezaker and Patricia Piccinini. As well as extensively showcasing contemporary fine art, its exhibitions are inclusive of indigenous photography, traditional genres such as portraiture, documentary and photojournalism in particular through its Leica/CCP Documentary Photography Award, pioneering digital imaging and video

The organisation celebrated its 30th year in July 2016 with an exhibition From Silver Gelatin to Instagram: Celebrating 30 Years of the CCP of work donated from prominent Australian photographers to raise funds after it became one of 62 arts institutions to lose federal funding, prior to which it received forty percent of its total income from the State of Victoria through Creative Victoria and the Commonwealth Government through the Australia Council and further support through the Visual Arts and Crafts Strategy, an initiative of the Australian and State and Territory Governments, with the remainder self-generated through membership and initiatives including an annual fundraiser exhibition of a work or suite of images donated by significant Australian artists.
