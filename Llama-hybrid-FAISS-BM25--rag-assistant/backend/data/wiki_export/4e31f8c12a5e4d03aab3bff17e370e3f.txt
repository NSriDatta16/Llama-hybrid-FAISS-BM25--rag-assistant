Toms River Fest was a major festival event held at the campus of Toms River High School North in Toms River Township, New Jersey, during the summers of 2005, 2006 and 2008. It was selected by the American Bus Association as one of the Top 100 Events in North America for Group Travel 2006. The festival, originally conceived as an annual event, has not been held since the last one in 2008.

Low Attendance in 2006

The festival attracted over 70,000 people in its first year. For 2006, over 100,000 people were expected to attend each day, however, estimates showed that only 45,000 attended over the four days. Officials blamed the low attendance rate on a dangerous heat wave, which struck the area with near-record temperatures during the four days of the festival. The revenue for the event was $60,000, down substantially from $394,000 in its previous year.

In 2005, Maroon 5, Kelly Clarkson, Clay Aiken, Jesse McCartney, Keith Urban, Fuel, Phantom Planet, and others performed.

While attendance numbers for the festival have yet to be released, the official website claims over 15,000 people attended Daughtry's concert on Sunday night.

Attendance on opening day, Saturday, was noticeably lower than the second day of the festival due to severe weather that passed through the Toms River area on Saturday. Sunny skies hovered over the festival with beautiful temperatures and low humidity on the second day, bringing in thousands of patrons.
