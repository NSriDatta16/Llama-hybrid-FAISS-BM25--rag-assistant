History
Hurricane Katrina devastated Salmen, pushing a storm surge of over eight feet through the area. All the buildings were devastated, with the exception of the new science wing, which was part of the original building.  After the storm, the school was closed for just over a month, but on 3 October 2005, Salmen started a platooning schedule at Northshore High School, which was mostly untouched by the storm. Northshore students attended from 6:55 a.m. to 12:35 p.m., and Salmen attended from 1:25 p.m. to 6:55 p.m. In mid January, the Federal Emergency Management Agency's assessment showed that more than 51% of the Salmen campus was damaged beyond repair, meaning that everything except the science building would have to be demolished and rebuilt.  The new school was completed in the summer of 2010 and in August, the staff moved into the new building permanently. On 17 January 2006, Salmen moved into the rebuilt St. Tammany Jr. High School, and is intended to finish the year there.  A temporary school is being built for the 2006–2007 and 2007–2008 school years. Before the storm, Salmen had just over 1000 students. As of 21 February 2006 about 800 of them have returned.

The new school was completed in 2010 and is elevated 15 ft to feature tuck-under parking.
