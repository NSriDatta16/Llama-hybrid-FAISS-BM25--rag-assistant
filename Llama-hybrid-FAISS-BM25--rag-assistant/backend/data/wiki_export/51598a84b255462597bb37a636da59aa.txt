The Eastern Metropolitan Bypass (also known as E.M. Bypass or EM Bypass) is a  (Including Kamalgazi to Baruipur extension) major road on the east side of Kolkata. It connects Ultadanga (North Kolkata) to Baruipur Puratan Bazar (South Kolkata). The 21 km long road from Ultadanga of North Kolkata to Kamalgazi of South Kolkata is known as Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and the 11 km long road from Kamalgazi Flyover to Baruipur in South 24 Parganas district is known as Southern Bypass. The road is a major link to  Salt Lake and New Town. EM Bypass is part of both State Highway 1 and State Highway 3. Much high-end construction and development in Kolkata has been centered around it.

It was designed as a six to eight-lane bypass to lessen traffic congestion on the entire stretch of Gariahat Road. Several consequent connections have been made to Gariahat Road to further move traffic to the Bypass.
