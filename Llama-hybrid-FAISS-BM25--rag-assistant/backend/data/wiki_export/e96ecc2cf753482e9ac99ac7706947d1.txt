École Secondaire Belmont Secondary School is a secondary school located in Langford, a western suburb of Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. It is one of three secondary schools in School District 62 Sooke.  It serves the suburban West Shore area of Colwood, Highlands, Langford, and Metchosin.

History
The first secondary school in the area was established on the school's former Jacklin Road site soon after the Second World War in re-located Army buildings. Several years later, two schools were constructed in permanent buildings:  Elizabeth Fisher Junior High School and Belmont High School. These were merged in 1973 into Belmont-Fisher Secondary School, and a new library was constructed to connect the adjacent buildings. After two years under this name, it was shortened to the current Belmont Secondary School.

New facilities
In December 2012, it was announced that Belmont was to be replaced with two new grade 9-12 schools: a 1,200-student replacement Belmont Secondary in the Glen Lake area of Langford, and a new 800-student Royal Bay Secondary School to be built in Colwood. The new facilities were intended to support a wide range of programs, including expanded students' skills and trades training. Additional programs such as culinary arts and automotive technician are being considered and links to the shipbuilding industry with possible metal fabrication and marine trades training programs are being explored. Both new schools will have Neighbourhood Learning Centres to provide community services.

In June 2013, construction commenced on the $53.9-million Belmont replacement school on the site of the former Glen Lake Elementary School. Even before its replacement had been completed, the sale of the former site to food retailer Sobeys was announced on April 3, 2014. The new Belmont Secondary School opened to students for the first time on September 8, 2015.
