Biography
Hans Gruijters studied psychology and political and social sciences at the University of Amsterdam. In 1954 he received a master's degree in psychology.

From November 1962 until 21 March 1966 he was VVD's representative in the Amsterdam's city council. After a conflict which had been provoked by his decision not to attend the wedding ceremony of Princess Beatrix and Claus von Amsberg he left the VVD. He thought that the marriage would not contribute to the social role that the royal house should play in society.
