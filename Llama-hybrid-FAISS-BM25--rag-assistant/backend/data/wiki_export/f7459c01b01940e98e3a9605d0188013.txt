By 2019, the original Sears auto center had been reconstructed for both BJ's Restaurants and Ethan Allen. In August 2017, Sears announced it would shutter as part of an ongoing decision to eliminate its traditional brick-and-mortar format. A number of potential replacement tenants have reportedly been in the midst of early on discussions with property owner and developmental arm Seritage Growth Properties.
