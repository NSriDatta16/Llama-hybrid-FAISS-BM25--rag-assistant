Poems, Speeches, Thoughts and Doodles is the nineteenth album by Roy Harper and was released in 1997.

History 
The spoken word album features 34 of Harper's poems and songs, and was originally only available via mail order or at Harper's concerts. Now out of print on CD, it can be difficult obtain; copies have sold for over $290 (US) on eBay. However, the album is available to purchase as a download from Harper's website.

The album is primarily a collection of Harpers poetry containing spoken versions of some earlier Harper recordings, such as "The Spirit Lives", "Commune" and "Pinches Of Salt" and at least one poem ("The Angel Of The Night") that would later become a song on the 1998 album, The Dream Society. Occasional guitar by Harper and Jeff Martin punctuates certain tracks, most notably on "Timelords in the Frost" which is the only track on the CD credited to both artists.
