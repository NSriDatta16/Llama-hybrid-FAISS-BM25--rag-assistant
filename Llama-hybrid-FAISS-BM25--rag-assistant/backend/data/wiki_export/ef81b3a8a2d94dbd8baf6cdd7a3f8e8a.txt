"Add Some Music to Your Day" is a song by American rock band the Beach Boys that was released in the US on February 23, 1970 as the lead single from their album Sunflower. It was written by Brian Wilson, Joe Knott and Mike Love. Wilson later said that Knott "was a friend of mine who wasn't a songwriter but he contributed a couple of lines. But I can't remember which ones!"

The song features lyrics that are a celebration of music and its ubiquitous presence in daily life. In April, the single peaked at number 64 in the US during a five-week stay. Disc jockeys generally refused to play the song on the radio, with one DJ reportedly stating that the Beach Boys "aren't hip anymore". According to band promoter Fred Vail, WFIL program director Jay Cook refused to play the song even after "telling me how great the Beach Boys are and how great Brian is."

Cash Box said "the Beach Boys strike up a whole new brand of teen excitement tinged with a trace of their old 'Good Vibrations' work sparked with vitality." Record World said it has "the same magic sounds that made them famous." Billboard called it an "original, easy-beat rhythm number."
