in Washington, D.C., is dedicated to the man who revolutionized naval history with his invention of the screw propeller.  The Swedish engineer John Ericsson was also the designer of , the ship that ensured Union naval supremacy during the American Civil War.

Congress appropriated $35,000 for the creation of the memorial, and Americans chiefly of Scandinavian descent raised an additional $25,000. Constructed on a site near the Lincoln Memorial between September 1926 and April 1927, the pink Milford granite memorial is  high with a  diameter base.

Sculpted by James Earle Fraser, it features a seated figure of Ericsson  high, and three standing figures representing adventure, labor, and vision.  The national memorial is managed by National Mall and Memorial Parks.
