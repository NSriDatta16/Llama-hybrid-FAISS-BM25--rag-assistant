Early life
Born to a Greek father and English mother in Surrey, Samos grew up in Oklahoma, London and Northampton. A portable radio cassette player given to her for Christmas as a child led her onto the path of broadcasting. She gained 9 O-Levels, and a BTEC National Diploma in Business & Finance at Northampton College for Further Education, before studying in London at Ealing College for a Bachelor of Arts degree in Design and Media Management.

Early career
Aged 19 during her degree years in London, Samos undertook work experience for GLR (BBC Greater London Radio) as a runner and switchboard operator, where she worked on the Greenhouse radio show presented by Chris Evans. She completed her degree, and moved into the record business working for MCA Records on Piccadilly in the A&R department.

Chris Evans period - BBC1 / Virgin Radio
In 1994, Chris Evans moved to the BBC to take over the Breakfast show from Steve Wright, taking previous colleagues, producer John Revell, sound engineer Dan McGrath and radio researcher Holly Samos. The 7-month contract evolved in to seven years on the breakfast show until 2001.

In September 1997, Evans and his team made a return to Breakfast Radio, on Virgin Radio.

By the middle of the May 2001, Evans was reported to have sacked his team and the Chris Evans breakfast show was dissolved.

Samos also undertook a lot of commercial work during her career, she presented for the Formula One Jordan team, the BBC's Holiday programme, and a number of fashion and beauty shows. She also works as a professional voice-over artist.

After Capital Radio took over Century Network, Samos moved to London's Heart 106.2 to present the Saturday breakfast show with Toby Anstis. She also returned to Virgin Radio as a swing shift DJ.

In March 2006, it was announced by BBC Radio Five Live that Samos had joined their Formula One team, and reported the latest news live from the pit lane and the paddock at each grand prix.

In January 2008 she became Virgin's presenter of Sunday Early Mornings 26am.

In 2010, she featured in the Codemasters game F1 2010, alongside David Croft (5 Live commentator). She has also been the voice behind the Renault F1 Official Podcast and Force India F1 Team Podcast.

After leaving BBC Radio 5 Live in 2011 Samos has worked for Formula One Management, Fanvision, AllSport, F1.com, hosts events for Formula One, various sport, music fashion and beauty companies. 

From 2011 to 2020, Samos provided the official live voiceovers for the Brit Awards. She freelance presented weekend shows on BBC Radio Oxford from 2012.
