Founded in 1998 through the efforts of William Henry Danforth, chancellor emeritus of Washington University in St. Louis, the Center was established with a $60 million gift from the Danforth Foundation, a $50 million gift from the Monsanto Fund, the donation of 40 acres of land from Monsanto, and $25 million in tax credits from the State of Missouri.

The founding chairman was William Henry Danforth with Ernest G. Jaworski as director. Roger N. Beachy became the first president in 1999.

The Danforth Center building was sustainably designed by Nicholas Grimshaw and opened in October 2001.

On September 24, 2009, Beachy was appointed by U.S. President Barack Obama to be the first director of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA).

James C. Carrington is the current president and chief executive officer. He joined the Center in 2011.

In June 2009 the first building of the new Bio-Research & Development Growth (BRDG) Park biotechnology incubator opened on the Danforth Center campus.

In April 2016, the William Henry Danforth Wing opened. Surrounding the buildings are six acres of reconstructed native Missouri prairie.
