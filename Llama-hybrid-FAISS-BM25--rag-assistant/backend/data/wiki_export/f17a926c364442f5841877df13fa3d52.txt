The Ghost of Cain is the third studio album of British rock band New Model Army. Released in 1986, The Ghost of Cain propelled the band to the forefront of the alternative rock scene in the 1980s. Not least thanks to the widely acclaimed underground hit song, "51st State", which is the only song by the band to date to feature lyrics not written by the band themselves; the lyrics were written by Ashley Cartwright of The Shakes.

It was the first album to feature new bassist, Jason 'Moose' Harris. It also features former Nine Below Zero member Mark Feltham as a guest musician on harmonica on songs "Poison Street" and "Ballad".

Brazilian thrash metal band Sepultura covered the song "The Hunt" on their 1993 album, Chaos A.D. UK folk metal band Skyclad covered the song "Master Race" on their Oui Avant-Garde á Chance album in 1996.

Singles and EPs
