The Monseigneur Schrijnen Retreat House was designed by the famed architect Frits Peutz (best known for the Glaspaleis) in 1932, and named after the 18th bishop of Roermond Laurentius Josephus Antonius Hubertus Schrijnen (Venlo 30 July 1861 - Roermond 26 March 1932). It is located at the top of one of the steepest hills in Heerlen next to the Molenberg and surrounded by the Aambos (a forest). It is one of the biggest buildings designed by Peutz.
