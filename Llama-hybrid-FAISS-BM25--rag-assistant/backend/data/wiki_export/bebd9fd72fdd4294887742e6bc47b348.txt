"It's Gettin' Late" is a song written by Carl Wilson, Myrna Smith Schilling and Robert White Johnson for the American rock band the Beach Boys. It was released on their 1985 album The Beach Boys and as a single with "It's O.K."

Billboard compared it to the Beach Boys' previous single "Getcha Back" which was about "teen reminiscence" saying that "It's Getting Late" brings the group's "harmonic tapestry hauntingly into the adult world."

The music video directed by Dominic Orlando, was filmed on location in Malibu, California, two months after Getcha Back.
