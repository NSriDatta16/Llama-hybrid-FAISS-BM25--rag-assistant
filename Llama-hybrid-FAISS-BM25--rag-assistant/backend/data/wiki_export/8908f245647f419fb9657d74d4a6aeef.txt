History
Stephens Swamp occupied much of present-day Burleigh Waters into the 1990s. It was named after Thomas Blacket Stephens, a local landholder who began draining the swamp land in 1861.

In the 1950s the Isle of Capri was one of the first canal estates constructed on the Gold Coast for waterfront living. Developers have expanded the popular estates ever since.  Prior to the eastern inland development of the Varsity Lakes area, Burleigh Waters was the southernmost point of the Gold Coast canal and waterway system. Burleigh Waters developed in stages, starting in the 1970s. One section, Burleigh Waters Estate was a canal extension developed by Hooker Corporation with partner  BMD Group during the late 1970s. The Hooker Corporation collapsed and Mr Power's BMD Group was paid out at 60c in the dollar a few years later. Privately built homes were being constructed by the time Pacific Fair opened in 1977 and continued with the expansion of the suburb. As a result of drainage and land reclamation, Stephens Swamp was eventually replaced by a series of man-made lakes that gives the suburb its name. 

The suburb of Burleigh Waters was officially named and bounded on 1 June 1981. The name Burleigh is taken from Burleigh Head, originally named Burly Head by surveyor James Warner in 1840.

The Infant Saviour Primary School opened in Burleigh Heads in 1935 and closed in 1973 when it was replaced by Marymount Primary School in Burleigh Waters.

Marymount College opened in 1967.

Caningeraba State School opened on 27 January 1987 with 130 students. It was built to relieve the pressure of increasing student numbers at Burleigh Heads State School.

The Burleigh Waters Library opened in 1991.

For decades a local urban myth maintained that sharks were seen as far south in the canal waterways as Burleigh Waters. Alleged sightings and stories were locally spread, but balanced with scepticism. In February 2003, a Burleigh Waters man was fatally attacked in shallow canal waters by a bull whaler shark. These sharks are also known as Zambezi whaler and are very aggressive. After the attack, the public was warned not to risk swimming in any Gold Coast canals but rather to swim safely at the beach, between the flags.
