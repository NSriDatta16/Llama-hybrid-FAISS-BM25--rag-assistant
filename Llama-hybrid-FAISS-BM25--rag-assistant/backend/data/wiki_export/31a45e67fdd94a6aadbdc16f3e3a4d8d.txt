Johnston is a village, parish and community in the former hundred of Roose, Pembrokeshire, Wales, and a parish in the diocese of Diocese of St David's.

It lies on the A4076 road approximately midway between Haverfordwest and the port of Milford Haven and is served by Johnston railway station. Until the end of the 19th century, anthracite was mined here. The village is now a dormitory for Haverfordwest and Milford Haven. The parish church has the typical tall, slim castellated tower of churches in the largely English-speaking south of Pembrokeshire, sometimes known as "Little England beyond Wales".

The village is just over 1 mile long and almost a mile wide from the furthest main points.
