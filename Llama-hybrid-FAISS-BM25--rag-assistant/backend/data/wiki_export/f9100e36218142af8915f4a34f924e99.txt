History
The settlement of this town began at the end of the eighteenth century on the banks of the present-day São Domingos River.  The first settlement was called "Arraial Velho" but it soon fell into ruin.  In 1821 the Portuguese Domingos and José Valente arrived seeking gold.  They brought an image of São Domingos Gusmão, which gave the name to the town and the river that passes nearby.   The town grew and in 1835 it became a district of Arraias, which is now part of Tocantins  In 1854 it became a municipality, one of the oldest in the state of Goiás.
