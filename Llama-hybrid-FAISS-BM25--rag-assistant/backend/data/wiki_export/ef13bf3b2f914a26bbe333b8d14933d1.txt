Iasmin Latovlevici (; born 11 May 1986) is a Romanian professional footballer who plays as a left-back.

Latovlevici started out as a senior at CFR Timișoara in 2005, while on loan from Politehnica Timișoara. His performances inspired a move to Steaua București in 2010, where he won seven domestic trophies before moving abroad to Turkey. He represented several teams in the latter country, including Galatasaray with which he won the 2017–18 Süper Lig, and returned to Romania in 2020.

Latovlevici made his senior debut for the Romania national team in June 2011, in a 0–1 friendly loss to Brazil, and amassed 13 appearances for the nation.

Club career

Early career / Politehnica Timișoara
After appearing in all matches in the first part of the 2005–06 season for CFR Timișoara, Latovlevici was transferred to neighbouring club Politehnica Timișoara and made his Divizia A debut the same season, in a match against Oțelul Galați.

Steaua București
On 8 July 2010, Latovlevici signed a five-year deal with FC Steaua București. He made his competitive debut on 25 July, in 2–1 Liga I away victory over Universitatea Cluj.

On 21 February 2013, Latovlevici opened the scoring in a 2–0 win over Ajax in the second leg of the UEFA Europa League round of 32; his side managed to qualify after winning 4–2 at the subsequent penalty shootout.

During his five-year stint in the capital, Latovlevici won seven domestic titles, amassing 177 appearances and 12 goals in all competitions.

Turkey
On 30 June 2015, Latovlevici agreed to a three-year contract with Turkish club Gençlerbirliği. He then joined Kardemir Karabükspor in the summer of 2016, also in the Süper Lig.

On 7 September 2017, Galatasaray announced the transfer of Latovlevici for a €550,000 fee. He signed a one-year deal with the option of another season, which would have been activated in case he made 18 appearances for the team. He recorded his debut nine days later, in a 2–0 league win over Kasımpaşa.

After failing to meet the number of appearances required for staying at Galatasaray, Latovlevici agreed to a one-year contract with fellow league club Bursaspor on 28 August 2018. He scored three goals from 25 games as the season ended in relegation for "the Green Crocodiles", but extended his deal nevertheless.

Late career
On 5 October 2020, after a brief spell at Hungarian side Kisvárda during which he did not make any appearances, Latovlevici returned to Romania by signing a contract with defending champions CFR Cluj. He played seven league games in the remainder of the season, as "the White-Burgundies" won their fourth consecutive championship title.

On 28 September 2021, Latovlevici moved to fellow Liga I team FC Argeș Pitești on a two-year deal. He terminated his contract on 8 November 2022, after executive director Daniel Stanciu publicly stated that Argeș lost several matches because of his blunders.

In April 2023, it was reported that Latovlevici signed for Petrolul Ploiești, although not officially confirmed by the club's website. The following month, rumours surfaced that a group of supporters opposed his signing and tried to remove a Petrolul shirt from him during a training, which led Latovlevici to promptly leave the team; head coach Florin Pârvu confirmed the incident, but stated that Latovlevici was still under contract.

International career
After representing Romania at under-21 level, Latovlevici made his full debut for the country in a 0–1 friendly loss to Brazil in São Paulo, on 7 June 2011.

Personal life
In June 2013, Latovlevici married his partner Roxana in a Serbian church in Timișoara, with his former Politehnica Timișoara teammate Costel Pantilimon acting as best man.
