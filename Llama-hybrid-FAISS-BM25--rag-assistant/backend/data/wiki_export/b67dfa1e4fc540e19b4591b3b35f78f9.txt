Thalangara is a part of Kasaragod Town, the district headquarters of the Kasaragod district in the South Indian state of Kerala. Malik Denar Jama Masjid and Dargah is located here. Its economy is dependent on remittance from expatriate workers in the Persian Gulf, particularly Dubai. Thalangara consists of areas like Padinhar(Westyork), Kunnil, Kadavath ("ferry stand"), Khazilane, Nuppadamail, Bangod, Theruvath, and Korkode ("street" in Malayalam). The areas of Thalangara consist of smaller mohallas (localities) and each locality has its own mosque and madrassa. 

Thalangara also houses the oldest and the biggest hospital in Kasargod district, the Malik Dinar Charitable Hospital, established in 1970 by Janab KS Abdullah. This institution is an educational centre of Kasaragod, with a School of Nursing, College of Nursing, B. Pharm and D. Pharm colleges.

Malik Deenar
Malik Deenar, Arabic مالك دينار  is said by Malabar Muslims to be the first generation follower of the Islamic prophet Muhammed who came to India to propagate Islam in the Indian Subcontinent. His grave is located at Thalangara which is consecrated inside a structure that was formerly a Tharavad of a local Tulu Chief.

Malik Deenar Grand Juma Masjid
Malik Deenar Mosque, formally Malik Deenar Grand Juma Masjid, is a mosque located about a kilometre from Kasaragod, Kerala, India, on the coast. The mosque is dedicated to Malik Deenar, who arrived from Arabia with his family on a mission to spread Islam on the coast of Kerala. It was originally built around 642. Years later, the mosque was reconstructed in 1809. In 2018, the Mosque was renovated under the guidance of T.A. Abdul Rahiman Haji (Nephew of Late K.S.Abdullah).    

Thalangara Thoppi, a traditional Muslim headgear crafted by hand in Thalangara, was once a flourishing industry that employed a significant number of people and had a global market in the Gulf and Africa. However, with the advent of mechanized production, the handmade Thalangara caps were unable to compete with lower market prices, leading to a significant reduction in production and a subsequent impact on Thalangara's economy
