Playing career

Early career – From Blackpool to Everton and back to Blackpool
Hills started in the youth team at hometown club Blackpool. He was signed by Everton manager Joe Royle for £90,000 as a schoolboy from Blackpool in 1995, after he impressed in an FA Youth Cup match playing for the Blackpool youth team against their Everton counterparts.

His only full appearance for the Toffees was at home to Chelsea on 11 May 1997. He had two loan spells at Swansea City, making eighteen appearances and scoring once, before returning to his hometown club for £60,000 in 1998, after an initial loan spell. In the 2000–01 season he was an integral part of the promotion team, playing 90 minutes as Blackpool defeated Leyton Orient 4–2 in the Third Division play-off final. He signed a one-year contract extension in April 2001. In the 2001–02 season he scored the Seasiders third goal as they beat Cambridge United 4–1 at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff to win the LDV Vans Trophy.

Hills made almost two hundred appearances over five years, scoring twenty goals and he also held the captain's armband in the absence of Ian Hughes.

Gillingham and Sheffield Wednesday
Hills left Blackpool for Gillingham, who were then in the Championship in 2003 and appeared fifty-eight times over two years, scoring two goals. After his contract was not renewed, Paul Sturrock signed him for Sheffield Wednesday, for whom he sometimes played on the left-wing. His time with the Owls was blighted by injury, which only allowed him to appear forty-six times, and was released by the club after two years.

Back to Blackpool again
On 5 July 2007, Hills signed a one-year contract (with an option for a further year) with Blackpool, his third spell with his hometown club. On 7 May 2008 he was released by Blackpool after making only four league appearances.

Fleetwood Town
An operation in the summer meant he was not fully fit and without a club. On the eve of the 2008–09 season, Hills signed for local Fylde coast club Fleetwood Town who had been promoted to the Conference North, on a non-contract basis. On 25 October 2008 he played in Fleetwood's FA Cup fourth qualifying round 4–3 win over Nantwich Town which saw the club reach the First round proper. At the end of the 2009–2010 season he was released by the club.

AFC Fylde

He has also helped coach youngsters on the Fylde coast with two fellow local players, who were also with Hills at Everton Jamie Milligan, now at Southport, and Gavin McCann. In February 2008, Milligan and McCann launched the first football academy on the Fylde coast, the Milligan-McCann Academy which is aimed at 8- to 12-year-olds and runs at King Edward VII and Queen Mary School in Lytham St Annes. Hills also coaches. John is married to Samantha and they have two children Isla and Rocco.
