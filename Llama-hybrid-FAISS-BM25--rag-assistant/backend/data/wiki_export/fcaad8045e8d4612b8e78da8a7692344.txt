Synopsis
In The Man Who Wouldn't Die art imitates life for Thomas Grace (Roger Moore), a famous British ex-novelist who wrote a series of acclaimed crime stories featuring a villain patterned after real-life criminal Bernard Drake (Malcolm McDowell).  Now living in America, Grace works as a hack reporter for a city newspaper.  After reading one of Grace's books, Jessie Gallardo (Nancy Allen), a waitress with burgeoning psychic abilities, predicts several murdersâ€”with Grace as one of the victims.  Her visions identify the enemy as Drake, who has escaped from prison by faking his own death in a fire.  As Drake sets out to frame the author for a series of grisly murders based around his novels, it is up to Thomas and Jessie to clear their names, stop him, and stay alive in the process.  Eric McCormack co-stars as a doubtful newspaper colleague.
