WUWF was founded in 1981 by the late Thomas K. Perry. Working with a core staff and hundreds of volunteers, WUWF has approximately 65,000 listeners. With the cutback of federal funding in the 1990s, WUWF began a course as a true listener-supported station: it operates largely with contributions from local individual listeners with additional support from locally based businesses. Only a small portion of the station's operating budget comes from state and federal grants. The University of West Florida also provides funds, mainly for facilities upkeep and utility bills.
