Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine is the medical school of Northwestern University and is located in the Streeterville neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. Founded in 1859, Feinberg offers a full-time Doctor of Medicine degree program, multiple dual degree programs, graduate medical education, and continuing medical education.

Through clinical affiliates Northwestern Memorial Hospital, the Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, and the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab (formerly Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago). Feinberg and its clinical affiliates are together an $11 billion academic medical enterprise. The school has about 4,830 faculty members.

Academic Medical Center
The Feinberg School of Medicine is part of the  McGaw Medical Center of Northwestern University. Other McGaw members include:
 Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago
 Northwestern Memorial Hospital 
 Shirley Ryan AbilityLab (formerly Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago)
 Jesse Brown VA Medical Center (formerly VA Chicago Health Care System)

Feinberg medical students and McGaw residents receive their clinical training at these hospitals, where nearly all the attending staff members have faculty appointments at the Feinberg School of Medicine. Residents also train at affiliates such as John H. Stroger Jr Hospital of Cook County, Northwestern Medicine Lake Forest Hospital, Swedish Covenant Hospital, MacNeal Hospital, and Methodist Hospital in Gary, Indiana.

The medical school's primary teaching hospital is Northwestern Memorial Hospital, a  modern hospital that was completed in 1999.

Education
The Feinberg School of Medicine is home to 631 medical students. The class of students who graduated in 2023 are the 164th graduating class. For the 2023 entering class, 7,836 people applied for 145 seats. The median undergraduate GPA and MCAT score for successful applicants are 3.92 and 520, respectively.

For medical students, the school offers four-year dual degree programs, which combine the Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree with a Master of Public Health (MPH), a Master of Arts in Medical Humanities and Bioethics (MA), a Master of Science in Healthcare Quality and Patient Safety (MS), or a Master of Business Administration (MBA). Students electing to pursue the additional degrees enroll in evening classes and graduate with both degrees. Two MD/PhD programs are offered, one in combination with Northwestern University's Graduate School (Medical Scientist Training Program) and one with the university's Institute for Neuroscience.

The school also offers graduate degree programs, some in combination with other Northwestern University professional schools:
Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in basic science programs such as Biological Sciences and Clinical Psychology, and public health programs such as Health and Biomedical Informatics, Health Services and Outcomes Research, Epidemiology, and Translational Outcomes Science

Additionally, the school offers a BS/MD degree through the Honors Program in Medical Education (HPME), a seven-year combined undergraduate and medical school program.

Research
According to public financial data for Feinberg, support for competitive research grants from all external sources totaled $706 million in academic year 2022â€“2023. In 2022, Feinberg ranked 15th for NIH funding among American medical schools.  The medical school houses more than 35 Core Facilities, including a Bioinformatics Consulting Core, Genomics Core and Human Embryonic and Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Core.

Faculty in the Research program at Feinberg study and mentor in a range of areas, including cancer biology, cell biology, chemical biology, drug discovery, developmental biology, evolutionary biology, genetics, genomics, medical biology, immunology, microbial pathogenesis, neuroscience, pharmacology, structural biology, biochemistry, epigenetics, epidemiology, behavioral sciences, preventive medicine, epidemiology, health outcomes, quality improvement, and translational sciences.

Recent Growth

In June 2019, the university opened a $560 million, 625,000 square-foot biomedical research building on the Chicago campus. The new building, the Louis A. Simpson and Kimberly K. Querrey Biomedical Research Center, is connected to the existing Robert H. Lurie Medical Research Center.  A second phase of build out will eventually total 1.2 million square feet in the new building when complete. Additionally, more than 250,000 square feet of space in existing campus buildings has been converted to new laboratory space.

Nobel Laureates
 John Eccles, an Australian neurophysiologist and philosopher, received the 1963 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Andrew Huxley and Alan Lloyd Hodgkin for their fundamental work on the synapse. Eccles was a professor at Feinberg from 1966 to 1968. 
 Robert Furchgott, a graduate of the class of 1940, received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1998 for his co-discovery of the role of nitric oxide as a signaling molecule.
 Ferid Murad, an American pharmacologist and cell biologist, received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1998, along with Robert F. Furchgott and Louis J. Ignarro, for demonstrating that nitroglycerin and related drugs worked by releasing nitric oxide into the body, which relaxed smooth muscle by elevating intracellular cyclic GMP. Murad was an adjunct professor at Feinberg from 1988 to 1998.

Rankings
In 2023, Feinberg was ranked 13th among American medical research schools by U.S. News & World Report. The school is ranked 15th in the National Institutes of Health funding rankings among all American Medical Schools.

The school's major affiliated teaching hospitals rank in U.S. News & World Report's Best Hospitals 2022-2023 as follows: 
 Shirley Ryan AbilityLab, ranked first in the nation for physical medicine and rehabilitation hospitals 
 Northwestern Memorial Hospital, ranked ninth in the nation of America's Best Hospitals

History
Hosmer Johnson, Nathan Smith Davis, Ralph Isham, Edmund Andrews, David Rutter and William Byford co-founded the medical department of Lind University on October 11, 1859. It was renamed the Chicago Medical College in 1863, and affiliated with Northwestern University in 1870.

The Woman's Medical College of Chicago, established in 1870 as the Woman's Hospital Medical College, became affiliated with Northwestern in 1892 as Northwestern University Woman's Medical School. The college closed in 1902 as other schools in Chicago and the nation began accepting women.

In 1906, the Chicago Medical College was renamed Northwestern University Medical School. It had occupied buildings on the near south side of Chicago from 1863 until the Montgomery Ward Memorial Building was constructed in Streeterville in 1926.

Northwestern University Medical School was renamed the Feinberg School of Medicine in 2002, reflecting a $75 million donation from the Joseph and Bessie Feinberg Foundation. Reuben Feinberg started to donate to the university after being hospitalized at Northwestern Memorial Hospital for a heart attack. The first donation, in 1988, was for $17 million to establish the Feinberg Cardiovascular Research Institute. A $10 million donation was subsequently sent in 1996 to establish the Frances Evelyn Feinberg Clinical Neurosciences Institute.

In 2012, Feinberg's entering medical students began a new curriculum, organized into three phases and emphasizing integration of four main curricular elements: science in medicine, clinical medicine, health & society, and professional development. The goal was to build a more learner-centered educational program that (1) fully integrates scientific principles in a clinical context; (2) stimulates inquiry and investigation; (3) has an assessment system that comprehensively evaluates student achievement in each of the core competencies; (4) reinforces a culture of learning, teamwork, and excellence; (5) is flexible and able to meet the unique needs of individual students as they learn and differentiate.

On September 1, 2013, Northwestern Medical Faculty Foundation, the medical school's physician's group, joined Northwestern Memorial HealthCare (NMHC), the health system that includes Northwestern Memorial Hospital, forming a new physician's group called Northwestern Medical Group. Together, NMHC and Feinberg jointly share the brand "Northwestern Medicine."

On May 8, 2015, exactly 90 years after Northwestern University first broke ground on its Chicago campus, Feinberg broke ground on the Louis A. Simpson and Kimberly K. Querrey Biomedical Research Center. The building opened in June 2019 and added more than 625,000 square feet and 12 stories of research space to the downtown campus.
