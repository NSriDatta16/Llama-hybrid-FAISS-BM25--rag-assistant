Petra Jaya is a suburb of Kuching, Sarawak, Malaysia. This suburb was named after sixth Yang di-Pertuan Agong, Tuanku Yahya Petra of Kelantan (1975-1979).

History
The suburb was founded in the 1970s by Sarawak chief minister at that time named Abdul Rahman Ya'kub. He saw a vision to develop the jungles and old rubber plantations here as the new satellite township next to Kuching. He began the project by constructing a bridge between Petra Jaya and Kuching, known as Datuk Patinggi Haji Abdul Rahman Bridge, across the Sarawak River in May 1975. In 1976, Wisma Bapa Malaysia was built. He also started on low-cost housing project which is known as Kampung Malaysia Jaya (Malaysia Jaya village) today.

The area where Petra Jaya was sited was formerly known as Matang. Most of the land in the area then was undeveloped. Kampungs or villages along and near the riverbanks of the Sarawak river were the only residential areas. The area was only accessible by the Satok suspension bridge, ferry or sampan. Since 1975, the completion of the Datuk Patinggi Tun Abdul Rahman Yaakub bridge, known as the Satok Bridge, together with construction of new road networks has made the area more accessible to development. Development in the area was further accelerated when it was designated as the Administrative Centre for the Sarawak Government, whereby many government offices and bodies relocated their headquarters and offices to Petra Jaya.

Administration
Petra Jaya is under the administrative jurisdiction of Dewan Bandaraya Kuching Utara (DBKU). The Kuching North City Hall (DBKU) headquarters is located here. In addition to that, the Administrative Centre of the Sarawak Government is located here.

The land in the area are generally flat with several hilly areas near Semariang. Most lands in this area are classified as Native Area Land and as such, a significant portion of the population in Petra Jaya are Bumiputras.
