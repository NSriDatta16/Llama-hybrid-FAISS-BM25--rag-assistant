Career

1995-2002: Early Days and Phrases and Numbers
Infusion founding members, Jamie Stevens and Manuel Sharrad, met in 1988 at a local high school in Wollongong. Frank Xavier also hails from Wollongong, although he did not meet the other two until they had relocated to Sydney.

In 1995, Infusion released its debut single "Smokescreen / Lux" on the Dance Pool label while primarily remixing other artists' tracks.

In 1999, he band signed with Thunk Records, an underground electronic label and released its debut studio album, Phrases and Numbers, in 2000. The trio's music evolved from the rave and club scene, widening in scope to include traditional pop song structures.

Andrew Wowk from In the Mix said the release of "Spike" was "the turning point in their career" saying "the track perfectly encapsulated the group's reinvention of their sound into an unstoppable behemoth of dark, throbbing, techy filth, which came as a fresh, subtle alternative to the over-saturation of floaty, uplifting progressive house of the time."

2003-2013: Six Feet Above Yesterday, All Night Sun Light and split
In October 2003, the group had relocated to Melbourne and signed with Sony BMG. In April 2004, Infusion released the single "Girls Can Be Cruel", which received airplay on Australia's alternative music radio station, Triple J. The song won the ARIA Award for Best Dance Release at the ARIA Music Awards of 2004. The band released Six Feet Above Yesterday in 2004, which won the Best Dance Release at the ARIA Music Awards of 2005. "Better World" and "Natural" were charting singles from the album.

Infusion's album All Night Sun Light was released on 7 July 2009 on its own independent label Futuresque. Infusion performed its last show with Leftfield at the Enmore Theatre in 2013.
