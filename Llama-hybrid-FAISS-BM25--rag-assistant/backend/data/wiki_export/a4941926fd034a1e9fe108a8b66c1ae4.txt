She has worked as a model, TV show host, actress, singer, instructor for Public relations and Personal Financial Planning at colleges, companies. Educated at Yong In University and Korea University, she is known for her unusual, almost cartoon-like voice.

Career

Television 
Hyun Young appears in numerous Korean television shows, and was mainstay on KBS's variety show, Heroine 6, since 2005 until the show's final episode in 2007. For her work on various shows, she won the 2006 Best Female Star award (for variety/comedy) on both the MBC and KBS Entertainment Awards. Since 2007, she has acted as one of the team leaders for the variety show Jiwhaza! ("Burst! Mental concentration"), airing on SBS. She is also one of the main 5 stars on KBS's High-Five, part of its Happy Sunday line-up. She was also part of Introducing a Star's Friend as a presenter.

Music 
Hyun Young has recorded the Korean version of "Dragostea din tei" (otherwise known as the Numa Numa song), titled "Nuna's Dream" ("누나의 꿈"); the "Numa Numa" lyrics are changed to "Nuna Nuna" (the Korean term used by males for an older woman) in 2006. The album did not achieve great sales, nor was the song officially promoted and sung on the music charts. Hyun Young instead sung it on the variety shows she appeared on, which allowed it to become somewhat popular as a novelty song with its own novelty dance (called the "Nuna Nuna" dance). Her video for the single became the most watched music video in 2006, according to M.net. In May 2007, Hyun Young released her second single "Love Revolution" ("연애 혁명"), a cover of Morning Musume's "Renai Revolution 21".

Personal life
Hyun Young married Choi Won-hee at the Sheraton Grande Walkerhill Hotel on March 3, 2012; her husband works at a multi-national financial firm. She gave birth to their first child on August 16, 2012.

During a 2013 investigation into propofol abuse among celebrities, Hyun Young admitted to getting doctor-prescribed injections 42 times between February and December 2011. She was not indicted, and was instead ordered to pay an  fine.

Philanthropy 
On February 10, 2023, Hyunyoung donated  to help 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquake, by donating money through Hope Bridge National Disaster Relief Association.
