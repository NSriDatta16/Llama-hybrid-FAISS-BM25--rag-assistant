History
The station name pays tribute to the Breguet family, including the Swiss-born watchmaker Abraham Breguet (1747–1823), who invented watches with automatic winding for astronomy. His grandson Louis Breguet (1804–1883) invented electrical and radio-telegraphic apparatus and collaborated with Claude Chappe. Later, his great-grandson Antoine (1851–1882) developed an electric anemometer. The sons of the latter, pioneers of aviation, Jacques and the famous Louis Charles Breguet (1880–1955) were the builders of the aircraft piloted by Dieudonné Costes and Maurice Bellonte who crossed the Atlantic from east to west in 1930. The name of the station is also a tribute to Angelesme de Saint-Sabin who was city councillor of Paris in 1777. The station was open on December 31, 1906.
