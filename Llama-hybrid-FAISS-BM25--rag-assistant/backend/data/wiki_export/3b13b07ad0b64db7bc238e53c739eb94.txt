Anywhere but Here (stylized as ...Anywhere but here) is the first full release on Kung Fu Records by The Ataris. The album was released on April 29, 1997, and was characterized by a straightforward, upbeat, pop punk sound.  The majority of the songs clock in at two minutes or less in length.

On May 28, 2002, the album was re-released with an extra track ("Anderson"), a hidden track (an acoustic cover of Weezer's "Butterfly"), and some video footage. The track listing was also changed.

Kris Roe played all of the instruments on this record except for the drums, but was credited only as playing guitar and singing. Derrick Plourde from Lagwagon played drums.
