Dandakosaurus (meaning "Dandakaranya lizard") is a genus of extinct averostran theropod dinosaur from the Kota Formation, Andhra Pradesh, India. It lived 183 to 175 million years ago from the latest Pliensbachian to the late Toarcian stages of the Early Jurassic.

Discovery and naming 
The holotype is partial pubis, GSI 1/54Y/76, discovered in the Kota Formation of India between 1958 and 1961 and was described as an indeterminate carnosaur in 1962. The type species, D. indicus, was named by Yadagiri in 1982. Little is known about the genus and some paleontologists consider it to be a nomen dubium.

Description 
In 2016, Dandakosaurus was estimated to be 10 meters (33 feet) in length and 2.3 tonnes (2.5 short tons) in weight.

Classification 
Dandakosaurus is currently classified as Averostra incertae sedis, variously suggested to be a ceratosaur or basal tetanuran.
