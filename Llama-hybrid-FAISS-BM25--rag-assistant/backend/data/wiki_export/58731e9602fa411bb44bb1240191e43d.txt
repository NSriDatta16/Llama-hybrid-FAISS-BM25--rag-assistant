It Only Hurts When I Laugh is the second album by Jann Browne. Among its highlights are a cover of Nanci Griffith's "I Wish It Would Rain," the title song "It Only Hurts When I Laugh" (penned by Kostas and Marty Stuart), "Where the Sidewalk Ends" (later recorded by George Strait for the soundtrack to his acting debut in the motion picture, Pure Country), and the old country standard "My Shoes Keep Walking Back to You."
