It begins its journey to join the Rhône at Pont-Saint-Esprit in Astet. The Espezonnette rises in the south of the commune with many tributaries: the Ruisseau de la Ferme, the Ruisseau du Gouffre, the Ruisseau de Montgros, and the Ruisseau de l'Ane. It flows north forming a small part of the northern border before continuing to join the Allier just south of the Langogne-Lesperon Aerodrome.
