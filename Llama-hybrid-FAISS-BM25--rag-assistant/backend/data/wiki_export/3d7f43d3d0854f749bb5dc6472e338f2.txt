Lambert Park is a purpose-built soccer stadium in Leichhardt, New South Wales, Australia.  It is the home ground of the APIA Leichhardt, and the Sydney FC Youth who participate in the National Youth League.

The stadium is peculiar in that it runs east to west, rather than north to south. The stadium has a nominal capacity of 7000, with 2000 seated in two main stands on either side of the playing field. In the southern of these stands there are dressing room facilities, a social club with views of the game, press facilities and media facilities. The northern stand runs the full length of the playing field, seating around 1200 spectators in 8 rows. This stand is regularly full for New South Wales Premier League encounters, with attendances at the ground in the last few seasons ranging from 800 to 3000 spectators. The western and eastern ends behind the goals are hilled, bringing the ground capacity to around 6000 spectators.

In March, 2011 as part of the campaign from the NSW Liberal Party ahead of the 2011 New South Wales state election leader Barry O'Farrell promised $2.2 million would be spent upgrading Lambert Park. This would include a new Synthetic playing field, installation of a new perimeter fence, a new club house including bigger dressing rooms for players and officials.

On 4 March 2014, The venue to be at is Lambert Park in Leichhardt – or more accurately the ‘new’ Lambert Park. The day will honour the past of APIA Leichhardt as well as unveil the future. It will be Round 2 of the IGA National Premier Leagues NSW Mens 1 and the traditional derby between APIA Leichhardt Tigers and Marconi Stallions will be played. It’s not so much the game that will be centre of attention but the new ground. APIA Leichhardt, who are celebrating their 60th birthday this year as the club because they were founded in 1954, have invested over $3.5 million dollars into Lambert Park. $2.2 million came from the largesse of the government while nearly $1.4 million came from private benefactors. So what did this money go towards? There are four new dressing rooms, new public toilets, a disabled toilet, a lift, a new bar, a supporters’ shop, a gymnasium, street lighting inside the ground with an upgrade of the lights to 500 lux, state of the art irrigation system, six water cannons above ground, 8 new water tanks holding 120,000 litres, new perimeter fencing, a new English-style gate at the front of the ground, shade sail over the paved area near the canteen, a new sound system and the whole ground has been painted.
