Pittsburgh is a former incorporated and now geographic township in Ontario, Canada. Located within Frontenac County, it was surveyed in 1787–1788 and named for William Pitt the Younger, the British prime minister. It was incorporated on January 1, 1850. The township was amalgamated into the city of Kingston effective January 1, 1998. The community still retains the name "Pittsburgh" within the government of Kingston.

Pittsburgh Township is home to Fort Henry, Canadian Forces Base Kingston, the Royal Military College of Canada and the historic community of Barriefield, Ontario. It includes the east side of the UNESCO-listed Rideau Canal at Kingston Mills (site of the Shafia family murders), hosts a handful of motels serving Ontario Highway 15 and former Ontario Highway 2, a federal prison (Pittsburgh and Joyceville Institutions in Joyceville, Ontario) and three museums (Military Communications and Electronics Museum, RMC Museum and MacLachlan Woodworking Museum).

Pittsburgh Township, separated from Kingston by the Cataraqui River, is linked to the downtown by the La Salle Causeway. The Waaban Crossing, located between the La Salle Causeway and Highway 401, opened in 2022.
