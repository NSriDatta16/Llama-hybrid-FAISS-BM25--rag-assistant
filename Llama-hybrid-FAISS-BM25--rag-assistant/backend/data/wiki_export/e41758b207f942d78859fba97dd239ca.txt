Means was a Canadian Christian post-hardcore and melodic hardcore band from Regina, Saskatchewan.

History
The band was formed in 2001 under the name of Means 2 An End as a three-piece by main-songwriter and lyricist Matt Goud. They were originally from the small city of Dauphin, Manitoba. In 2003, they relocated to Regina, Saskatchewan. They eventually integrated elements of hardcore into their sound and dropped "2 An End" from their name. It was around this time, in 2005, that original bassist Blair Roberts quit to pursue a family. He was replaced by Dylan Johnstone, formerly of Yorkton, Saskatchewan hardcore group Statement of Service. They remained a three-piece until mid-2006 when Wells joined so Johnstone could switch to lead vocals.

This era of the band saw them switch to a mainly metalcore sound inspired by Shai Hulud and Misery Signals. The group toured in the US and Canada, and was featured in the June 2007 issue of Alternative Press magazine as well as multiple other publications. Their 2007 album, Sending You Strength, was released in the US on Facedown Records.

Means disbanded after a series of farewell shows in select Canadian and US cities. They played their final show to a sold-out crowd at the Riddell Centre in the University of Regina on November 28, 2008. This show was captured on video and given out to friends of the band.
