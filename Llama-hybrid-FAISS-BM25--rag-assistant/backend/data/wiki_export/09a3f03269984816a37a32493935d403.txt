Ockley railway station serves the villages of Ockley and Capel in Surrey, England and is  from Ockley village and  west of the village of Capel. The station is  from London Waterloo station (although London-bound trains run to Victoria). Ockley is managed by Southern which also provide the services.

History
It opened as Ockley & Capel on 1 May 1867 as part of the London Brighton & South Coast Railway extension to Horsham. Its location, next to Le Steeres of Jayes Park brickworks (closed c 1914) and nearby Phorpres Works (now Clockhouse Works) allowed for substantial brickwork traffic for many years. Milk traffic was also important until the early 1930s when this trade was lost to road transport. Goods traffic declined slowly over the next 30 years ceasing finally in June 1962.

A signal box was provided at the station when it opened and was rebuilt with a 22-lever frame in 1905. The box was closed in 1965 and demolished two years later.

In 2000 the station was Grade II listed.

A great deal of further detail on the history of this station and the entire section of line between Dorking and Horsham can be found in John Harrod's Up The Dorking.
