Beverly Robison Marrero (born January 23, 1939) is an American politician and a Democratic member of the Tennessee Senate District 30, which is a part of Shelby County.

She chairs the Family Justice Subcommittee, and is a member of the Health and Human Resources Committee, the Domestic Relations Subcommittee, and the Public Health and Family Assistance Subcommittee. At the 1976 Democratic National Convention, she represented Tennessee on the Rules Committee. She is a member of the Tennessee Economic Council on Women.

Beverly Marrero was one of only seven members of the House to vote against a measure to hold a referendum advocating amending the Tennessee State Constitution to ban gay marriage. In April 2006, in the Public Health and Family Assistance Subcommittee, Marrero voted against another proposed amendment that would have removed all guarantees of a right to an abortion from the state constitution. Marrero also sponsored a bill to stop death penalty executions for three years, while a newly created committee would perform a study of the fairness of death penalty administration.

Before entering politics, Beverly Marrero was a real estate consultant. She began politics working for the election of John F. Kennedy by going door to door in her neighborhood. She worked in Tennessee, Missouri, Ohio, and New Hampshire for Jimmy Carter's campaign.
