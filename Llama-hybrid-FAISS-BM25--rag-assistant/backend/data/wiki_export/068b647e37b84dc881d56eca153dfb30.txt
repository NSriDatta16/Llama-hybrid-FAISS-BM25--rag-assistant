History

The first settlers in the area arrived in the mid-1840s. Over the next quarter century, a church and school community developed and the number of farms increased. The arrival of the Texas and Pacific Railway in the 1870s established the settlement as a shipment point for area farmers. When local residents requested a post office, they submitted the name "Scurry"—in honor of Scurry Dean, who was killed during the Civil War. Postal service began in 1883, and a year later, Scurry had an estimated population of 50. By 1914, the community was home to around 400 people and a number of businesses. The Great Depression caused Scurry to decline, which lasted through the first decade after World War II. Only 250 people remained in the community by the mid-1950s. The trend was reversed during the latter half of the 20th century. In 1990, 9 businesses and about 315 people were living in the community. That figure approached 600 by 2000, and Scurry was officially incorporated as a town three years later.
