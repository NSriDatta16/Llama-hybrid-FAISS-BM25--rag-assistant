Petrie signed for Arbroath from local club Strathmore. On 12 September 1885, Petrie, at the age of 18, scored 13 times for Arbroath in a record 36–0 win over Bon Accord. In 1891, Petrie signed for Distillery, playing in the Irish League for a season, before returning to Arbroath. In 1920, Petrie retired from football, later becoming a kitman and trainer for Arbroath.
