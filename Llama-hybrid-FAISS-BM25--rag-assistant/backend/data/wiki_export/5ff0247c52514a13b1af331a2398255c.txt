"Plan B" is the seventeenth episode of the second season of the American mystery television series Veronica Mars, and the thirty-ninth episode overall. Written by Dayna Lynne North and directed by John T. Kretchmer, the episode premiered on UPN on April 5, 2006.

The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life as a high school student while moonlighting as a private detective. In this episode, Weevil (Francis Capra) asks Veronica for help in proving that Thumper (James Molina) killed Felix. Meanwhile, Wallace (Percy Daggs III) breaks up with Jane (Valorie Curry), and Mac (Tina Majorino) confronts Cassidy (Kyle Gallner) about his hesitance to engage in an intimate physical relationship with her.

Synopsis 
Logan (Jason Dohring) wins the essay contest to become Woody Goodman's (Steve Guttenberg) intern, and Veronica taunts him about having plagiarized it. Weevil (Francis Capra) flashes back to a conversation with Felix in which Felix talked about marrying and having kids. Weevil asks Veronica to help prove that Thumper killed Felix, but it is risky because Thumper has leverage: a video of Weevil beating up David "Curly" Moran. In study hall, Wallace and Jackie (Tessa Thompson) bond, and they agree to hang out together. Beaver encourages Mac to ask him to the Sadie Hawkins dance. Veronica asks Logan about the night of Felix's murder, and he says the witness drove a San Diego seafood truck. Woody assigns Logan to sort his mail, during which Logan discovers a DVD with footage secretly filmed inside Woody’s house. Keith (Enrico Colantoni) agrees to investigate. Veronica and Logan track down the truck driver, who denies seeing anything before telling them he is worried about the safety of his family. Veronica reports the dead-end to Weevil, who suggests Felix was killed because of his relationship with Molly Fitzpatrick (Annie Campbell).

Mac goes to Veronica for advice about why Beaver isn’t trying to be intimate with her. Weevil asks Molly about Felix and gives her a toy truck he says was Felix’s. To save him from being embarrassed by bullies, Jackie asks a disabled boy to the dance. Logan discovers Goodman's signature stamp. At The River Styx bar, Liam Fitzpatrick becomes enraged when Molly mentions Felix’s murder, a conversation Veronica and Weevil record using a bug hidden in the toy truck. Veronica and Weevil take the recording to Sheriff Lamb (Michael Muhney), who is dismissive of their evidence. Frustrated, Weevil decides to implement “Plan B,” although Veronica pleads for more time to get proof. Keith deduces that the video was recorded before Woody went public with incorporation, so he suggests another motive. Outside the Fitzpatrick's church, Weevil chloroforms Thumper and steals his bag of drug money. However, he is seen by two children. At the Sadie Hawkins dance, Gia pesters Logan. Wallace kisses Jackie, who rejects him; Jane finds out, however she forgives Wallace and blames Jackie. Beaver resists Mac’s pushes for intimacy. Veronica asks Logan to dance to prevent him from snapping at Gia.

Thumper tells the Fitzpatricks he lost their money, but they find it in his bike and believe he tried to cheat them. The Fitzpatricks gag him and cuff him to a urinal in an unspecified location. Woody tells Keith that a disgruntled ex-gardener shot the footage and asks for the DVD back; Keith returns it but keeps a copy. After Veronica talks to his wife, the truck driver agrees to testify against Thumper. Wallace breaks up with Jane because he still has feelings for Jackie, but Jackie spurns Wallace to protect her reputation. Mac confronts Beaver about their lack of intimacy, but this pushes him to break up with her. A demolition worker finds Thumper's motorcycle locked in the condemned stadium. As Logan depresses the plunger, Thumper is shown struggling against his cuffs in the stadium, and he is implied to be killed when the stadium is demolished. Weevil gives confession at the church.

Reviews 
Television Without Pity gave the episode an "A". Price Peterson, writing for TV.com, praised the closure of the Felix-stabbing mystery, stating that "I don't know about you, but I was really ready to be finished with the Felix-stabbing plot line, so this episode was deeply satisfying. […] I'm definitely ready for a fresh set of mysteries for Veronica to solve.

Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave a more mixed review, writing that "It's amusing that last week I was complaining that Veronica Mars wasn't ramping up its tension as it headed towards the end of the season. Clearly I jumped the gun slightly, since both of these episodes did exactly that. "Plan B" was a little contrived—you could see the strings being pulled with Logan's memory and Wallace's breakup—but strong enough to take us into the home stretch."
