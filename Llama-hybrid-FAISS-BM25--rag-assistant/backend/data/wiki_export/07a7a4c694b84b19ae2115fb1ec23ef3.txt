Bigtoe is a motorcycle that once held the Guinness World Record in the category of Tallest Rideable Motorcycle, bearing a maximum height of 7.5 feet (2.3 metres) and a top speed of 62Â mph. It weighs 3,600 pounds. Tom Wiberg, from Sweden, built it in 1998 with a Jaguar V12 engine.

The title has passed to Dream Big, a bike built by Greg Dunham in 2005. Wiberg also holds the record for the smallest rideable motorcycle, with Smalltoe.
