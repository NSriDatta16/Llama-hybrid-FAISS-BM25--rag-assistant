Professional career
Kircus was selected in the 2003 NFL Draft in the sixth round by the Detroit Lions. Kircus was a fan and hometown favorite.  He played for the Lions during the 2003 and 2004 seasons, and training camp for the 2005 season.  In 2004, Kircus caught a 50-yard touchdown pass from Lions quarterback Joey Harrington.  He spent the 2005 regular season out of the NFL.

Kircus signed with the Omaha Nighthawks for the 2010 UFL season. However, on September 18, 2010, he was released by the team following an arrest on misdemeanor charges outside a gas station in Rockford, Michigan.
Kircus' misdemeanor charge was reduced due to an investigation proving he acted out of instinct on his September arrest that resulted in his release from the Nighthawks.

Personal life
Nicknamed "Circus Kircus" by Grand Valley Lanthorn sports editor Michael Kohon for his acrobatic catches, he is the son of Anthony and Elaine Kircus. He grew up in Imlay City, The Gateway to the Thumb of Michigan.

After being cut by the Lions in 2005, Kircus was employed as a sandwich artist at a Subway in Howell, Michigan.  The store, owned by a friend, allowed Kircus to remain in the Metro Detroit area while still pursuing his football career.

In May 2007, Kircus was involved in an early morning altercation with a man in Centennial, Colorado.  Kircus, who claimed self-defense, was allowed to remain with the Broncos after taking a polygraph test.  Originally charged with felony assault, Kircus instead pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and was sentenced to 2 years probation.  His release from the Broncos was unrelated to the incident according to head coach Mike Shanahan.  Kircus filed for bankruptcy protection in 2010 as a result of continued compensation claims by the victim.

On September 15, 2010, Kircus was arrested at a gas station in Rockford, Michigan.  He was charged with obstructing a police officer and driving with a suspended license.
