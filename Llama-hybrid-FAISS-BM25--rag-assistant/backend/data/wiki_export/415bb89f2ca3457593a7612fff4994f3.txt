Great Southern Bank Arena (originally known as JQH Arena) is an indoor arena in Springfield, Missouri. The arena opened in 2008. It is located on the campus of Missouri State University and is the home of the Missouri State Bears and Lady Bears basketball teams; it is often referred to by MSU students as "the Q".

About
There is a maximum seating capacity of 11,000. Included in the seating capacity are 9,637 chairback seats, 122 seats for permanently disabled guests, 114 loge seats, and 22 private suites. 55 courtside seats are arranged for basketball games and 1,363 bleacher back seats in the end zones are reserved for students. There are 166 public restroom stations (98 for women and 70 for men), six concession stands with 42 points of sale plus 12 additional portable locations, and 2 elevators. Located just off the main lobby area is a team store selling Missouri State University apparel and souvenirs. Maximum seating for concerts with an end-stage is 10,542.

The arena bears the initials of John Q. Hammons, a Springfield-based hotel developer and Missouri State alumnus who donated $30 million for the arena's construction. JQH Arena replaced the Hammons Student Center (also named in honor of its major donor) in terms of function and is connected with the Hammons Student Center via an underground corridor.

The venue underwent a name change in April 2022. Naming rights were purchased by Great Southern Bank for $5.5 million. 

The band Eagles played the inaugural concert at JQH on November 13, 2008, in front of a sold-out crowd of 10,550. In the fall of 2009, the PBR made their first Built Ford Tough Series appearance at the JQH Arena and appeared again in the spring of 2010, and summer of 2019.

GSB Arena currently co-hosts the Missouri State High School Activities Association state basketball semifinals with the Hammons Center. All championship games are played in the arena.
