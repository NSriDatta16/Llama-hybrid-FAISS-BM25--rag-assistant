All Points Bulletin is a 2004 live album by American indie/roots folk band Dispatch. Much like their previous live album Gut the Van, the album was released onto two discs.  The first is entitled "Somerville" and captures the band's intimate "warm-up" gig prior to their free performance to approximately 110,000 fans on the second disc, entitled "Hatch Shell."  The purchase of the double album also includes a DVD recording of both performances.
