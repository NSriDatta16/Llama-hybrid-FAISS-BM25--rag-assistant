Terenci Moix (; real name Ramon Moix i Meseguer; 5 January 1942, in Barcelona – 2 April 2003, in Barcelona) was a Spanish writer, who wrote in Spanish, and in Catalan. He is also the brother of poet/novelist Ana Maria Moix.

Life and work
Self-taught, his first work, La torre de los vicios capitales (La torre dels vicis capitals, in Catalan), was published in 1968. Many of his early works criticised the values of his time, especially the official morality of Francoism. In 1990, he wrote and published a children's book called, Los Grandes Mitos del Cine (English version as "The Greatest Stories of Hollywood Cinema"), which is illustrated by Willi Glasauer, and published by Círculo de Lectores. This children's book includes fun facts, trivia, and information accompanied by photos and Willi Glasauer's illustrations of the classic Hollywood films and stars such as Casablanca, Gone with the Wind, Cleopatra, and Tarzan the Ape Man.

He wrote in several newspapers: Tele-Exprés, Tele-Estel, El Correo Catalán, Destino, Serra d'Or, and El País. He was openly homosexual, and participated in many TV gatherings.

Death
Moix died of emphysema on 2 April 2003 in Barcelona.

Awards
In 1967 he won the Mercè Rodoreda Award for La torre dels vicis capitals. In 1992, he won the Ramon Llull Novel Award for El sexe dels àngels. In 1996, he became the first winner of the Fernando Lara Novel Award for his then-unpublished work El amargo don de la belleza.

An annual literature prize, bearing his name, the Terenci Moix Fundación Arena de Narrativa Gay y Lésbica, has been instituted. It was won most recently by Spanish novelist Rafael Peñas Cruz for his coming-of-age work, Charlie.
