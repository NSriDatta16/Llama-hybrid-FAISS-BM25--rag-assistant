Huochong () was the Chinese name for hand cannons. The oldest confirmed metal huochong, also the first cannon, is a bronze hand cannon bearing an inscription dating it to 1298 (see Xanadu gun).

By the time of the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) two types of huochong were in use. One was a hand held version with a wooden shaft known as a shouchong () whilst the larger Wankouchong ( — bowl-mouthed cannon) or Zhankouchong ( — cup-mouthed cannon) rested on a supporting wooden frame. It was invented presumably as an advance in warfare, a new way to fight. 

The Wankou Chong, translated literally as bowl-muzzle gun () was a type of Huochong gun used in the late Yuan and early Ming dynasties. The cannons normally contained black powder, a wooden block or frame to contain the powder, and a large cannonball or a group of smaller cannonballs. The cannon was most commonly used to protect Chinese ports and to defend against pirates. The cannon faded out of use gradually due to its short barrel, slow rate of fire, and short range.
