Blues in My Bottle is an album by Lightnin' Hopkins, released in 1961 on Bluesville Records.

Reception

The AllMusic review noted: "He was at his best when unaccompanied, as on this Prestige date recorded in 1961. Though he usually played electric guitar, the Texas blues titan performed on this release with an acoustic, and the result is most rewardin". The Penguin Guide to Blues Recordings wrote that "Lightnin' chanting the R&B hit 'Wine Spode-o-dee' on Blues in My Bottle is no more than a couple of minutes of fun, but it neatly demonstrates his range of reference, coming straight after 'Buddy Browns Blues', a reminiscence of Texas Alexander".
