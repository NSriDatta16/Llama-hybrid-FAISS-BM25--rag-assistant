History
The severe food shortage and political turbulence during the 1920s and 1930s forced the people of central Kerala to search for agricultural land and political security.  Malabar - then part of the state of Madras under the British rule - offered them relative political security as well as vast area of forest land to cultivate. However, cholera, fever, and starvation were endemic.

Economy

The major agricultural products are rubber, pepper, cashew and coconut. The name Anapanthy comes from the elephants in that area. There were people who could mate the elephants and train them to work, especially to clear the forest.

Today's Anapanthy Service Cooperative Bank was the first financial institution for the entire Aralam/Ayyankunnu villages. The bank was started in 1940s as a 'Society' with a few members. Today it has grown into a full-fledged bank with many branches in the area.
