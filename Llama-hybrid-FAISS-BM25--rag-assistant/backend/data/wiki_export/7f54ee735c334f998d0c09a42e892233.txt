Prom Meesawat (born 21 July 1984) is a Thai professional golfer. He won his age group at the World Junior Golf Championships in 1997 and 2002 and was Asia Pacific Junior Champion several times. He won the Thailand Open Amateur Championship in 2001, 2002 and 2003 and was victorious in a professional tournament as a fifteen-year-old amateur.

Professional career
Meesawat turned professional in 2004 and joined the Asian Tour. In 2005 he had five top ten finishes on Asian Tour and won a professional event in Thai circuit. His first Asian Tour win came at the 2006 SK Telecom Open in South Korea.

In 2012 a string of good results in Asian Tour events that were co-sanctioned with the European Tour earned Meesawat full playing rights on the European Tour for 2013. He lost his European Tour card in 2015 and returned to the Asian Tour full-time. In January 2019, Messawat qualified for the 2019 Open Championship with a top-4 finish at the SMBC Singapore Open.
