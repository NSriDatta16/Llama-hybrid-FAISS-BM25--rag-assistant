Small Heath railway station serves the areas of Small Heath and Sparkbrook in Birmingham, West Midlands, England. The station is managed by West Midlands Trains, which runs all the services.

The former Great Western Railway station building, opened in 1863 as Small Heath and Sparkbrook on the main line from  to Birkenhead Woodside, is on a bridge over the tracks shared with Golden Hillock Road (the B4145). The A45 Small Heath Highway runs alongside. To the other side is the site of the former BSA factory.  Nearby are the largely disused sidings which served local industry in the area.  

The station once had four platforms (both in an island configuration) in use, following the quadrupling of the line by the Great Western Railway in 1906, but only the western pair are now operational (as these are the only ones that trains can use to reach Moor Street & Snow Hill).
