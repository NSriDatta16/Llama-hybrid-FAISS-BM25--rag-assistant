Sir Arthur de Capell Brooke, 2nd Baronet (22 June 1791 in Northamptonshire – 6 December 1858) was a British baronet and travel writer, Fellow of the Royal Society (1823) and co-establisher of the Raleigh Club (1827).

Remarks on Norway
He travelled in Northern Norway in 1820 and remarked the following regarding sea monsters
«Off Otersoen.... It was of considerable length, and longer than it appeared, as it lay in large coils above the water to the height of many feet. Its head was shaped like that of a serpent; but he could not tell whether it had teeth or not. He said it emitted a very strong odour and that the boatmen were afraid to approach near it.»
«At Alstahoeg I found the Bishop of the Nordlands (another clergyman!) who was an eye-witness to the appearance of two in the Bay of Sorsund, on the Drontheim Fjord.... They were swimming in large folds, part of which were seen above the water, and the length of the largest he judged to be about one hundred feet. They were of a darkish grey colour, the heads hardly discernible, from their being almost under water.»
His informants were the county administrator of Finnmark, the clergymen Marcus Fredrik Steen of Karlsøy and Peter Vogelius Deinboll of Vadsø (1816–1824); as well as the bishop of Nordland Mathias Bonsak Krogh.  Later, in 1823 he was a traveller between the villages of Alta and Torneå, describing how the locals had discovered coffee.

He wrote and sketched in several publications from his expeditions:
