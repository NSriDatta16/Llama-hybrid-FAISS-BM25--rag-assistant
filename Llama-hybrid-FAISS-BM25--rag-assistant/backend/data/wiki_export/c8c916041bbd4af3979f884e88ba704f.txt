The Lebret Eagles were a Junior "A" team based in Lebret, Saskatchewan, Canada. They used to be members of the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League.

History
The Lebret Eagles played 8 seasons in the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League from 1993 to 2001.  

The team's formation as the SJHL's 13th club was announced during a press conference on May 13th, 1993 overlooking Mission Lake.

Star Blanket Cree Nation put up the $50,000 expansion fee, making the Eagles Saskatchewan's first Indigenous-owned and operated junior hockey club.

Right winger Carlin Nordstrom was the first player chosen in the 1993 dispersal draft. He'd later play NCAA Division I college hockey with Western Michigan University.

The Lebret Eagles played their home games at the Eagle Dome in Lebret, Saskatchewan. The rink’s capacity was expanded to 1,200 to accommodate the team’s needs, along with other upgrades.

In 2001, the team left the league and a year later the franchise was dissolved.
