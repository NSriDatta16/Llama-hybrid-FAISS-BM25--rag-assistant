No. 92 Wing is the maritime patrol wing of the Royal Australian Air Force. Headquartered at RAAF Base Edinburgh, 92WG is part of the Surveillance and Response Group, and with the transitioning of No. 10 Squadron to 42 Wing with effect 1 May 2019 – 92 Wing currently comprises two squadrons – No. 11 Squadron for operational duty, and No. 292 Squadron for training. The wing also has a detachment headquarters at RMAF Base Butterworth in Malaysia. 92WG operates 12 P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft. The P-8A is multi-role platform, capable of F2T2EA. Its roles include anti-submarine and anti-surface surveillance and warfare, for which the aircraft are equipped with MK54 torpedoes and Harpoon anti shipping missiles. It is also responsible for long range intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and maritime attack missions, Naval support and search and survivor supply missions. The Australian Maritime search area of responsibility constitutes approximately 11% of the Earth's surface, the largest area of responsibility for any single country.

Recent history
The return to Australia of the No 92 Wing Detachment in the Middle East Area of Operations (MEAO) in November 2012 marked the end of the longest deployment of an Air Force element on combat operations to date. While based in the Middle East, the aircraft and crews flew missions for three separate operations (Operation Slipper, Operation Catalyst and Operation Falconer). During this highly successful 10-year deployment, both the character of missions and the tactics employed to achieve success changed markedly. The AP-3C Orion detachments conducted more than 2400 missions, comprising more than 22,300 hours of flying over Iraq, Afghanistan, Persian Gulf, Arabian Sea and off the Somali coast.

In late-June 2017 two No. 10 Squadron AP-3C Orion aircraft were deployed to the southern Philippines to assist during the Marawi crisis.

No. 11 Squadron has taken delivery of 12 P-8A Poseidon, the first of which arrived at RAAF Base Edinburgh in November 2016, and the last arriving December 2019. No. 292 Squadron has been equipped with new P-8A Poseidon operational flight and mission simulators. These P-8A Poseidon aircraft have replaced the AP-3C Orion which first entered military service in 1962 and became the 'work horse' of No. 10 Squadron and No. 11 Squadron which both have histories dating back to World War II.

In April 2018 a No. 11 Squadron P-8A Poseidon was deployed to Japan to conduct maritime surveillance to prevent sanctions evasions by North Korea. No. 92 Wing aircraft have subsequently been periodically deployed to the region as part of Operation Argos.

In October 2019 a No. 11 Squadron P-8A Poseidon was deployed to the Middle East in support of a US-led International Maritime Security Construct, which includes forces from the US, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UK.

In January 2020, during the devastating and unprecedented Australia wide bush fires, a No. 11 Squadron P-8A Poseidon was utilised under the Emergency Defence Assistance to the Civil Community role as a surveillance asset for Operation Bushfire Assist.

In June 2023 No. 9 Squadron was re-raised as an element of No. 92 Wing. The squadron will operate the MQ-4C Triton from 2024.
