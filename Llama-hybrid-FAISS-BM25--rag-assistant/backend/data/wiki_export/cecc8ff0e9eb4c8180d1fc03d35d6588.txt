Gridlock'd â€“ The Soundtrack is the soundtrack to Vondie Curtis-Hall film Gridlock'd and was released on 28 January 1997 by Death Row Records and Interscope Records.

The track "Out the Moon (Boom, Boom, Boom)" was originally recorded for the LBC Crew debut album Haven't You Heard? (We Givin' Something Bacc To The Street), which was later shelved and the songs were cycled through other Death Row releases. The album had two chart running singles. "Lady Heroin" was originally going to be on Sam Sneed's unreleased album Street Scholars. This is both the second to last Death Row Soundtrack Album and second to last Death Row album to be distributed by Interscope, as later in the year they would drop Death Row from their label.

"It's Over Now" was 46th on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks, which was Danny Boy's second chart single. "Wanted Dead or Alive" was 16th in the UK and was accompanied by a music video with Snoop alone as it was filmed after the death of 2Pac, so he is only present in archive footages from the motion picture. The album itself went to top the R&B album chart also on the first place.

Commercial performance
Gridlock'd peaked at #1 on both the US Billboard 200 and the US Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts, selling 150,500 copies in its first week. The album was certified Gold on April 16, 1997.
