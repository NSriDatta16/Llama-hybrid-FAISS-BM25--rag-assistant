Types of Plastic
Discraft discs are produced in nine different lines of plastics: (In order of retail cost)

Ti (Chemical symbol for titanium): The newest Discraft material (2012). It has the durability of Z plastic with grippiness of the ESP plastic, along with extra stability.

Cryztal FLX Z: Z FLX is a new plastic that Discraft has released only being offered on a few models. It is speculated that this will replace the ESP FLX material.

ESP FLX Plastic: FLX is used on a limited number of discs. It is as durable as ESP Plastic, but much more flexible, this is achieved by adding a lightening agent to the ESP mixture. This type of plastic is extremely useful in cold weather conditions.

Cryztal Elite Z: Crystal plastic ranges from being more translucent than Elite Z to sometimes transparent. It often has glimmering effect when held in the light. Crystal is sought after by collectors for its beauty.

ESP Plastic: ESP plastic is a highly durable line that was launched in 2006. This type of plastic is made to be very grippy while also being very durable. ESP plastic is non-translucent.

Elite-Z Plastic: Elite-Z plastic is known for its durability. The plastic is semi-translucent, very stiff, and very resistant to wear. This line of plastic is produced in a variety of bright colours. This plastic is slightly more over stable than, for example the ESP Plastic.

Z-Lite: combines Elite-Z's durability and resistance to wear with lighter weights than possible with normal Elite-Z plastic.

Elite-X Plastic: Elite-X is very grippy plastic but is more prone to wear.

Pro-D Plastic is the cheapest type of plastic and is also the least durable. However, Pro-D plastic provides extremely great grip.

Soft Pro-D plastic is a variation on regular Pro-D plastic. It is only used for putters, and provides a more flexible, grippy feel.
