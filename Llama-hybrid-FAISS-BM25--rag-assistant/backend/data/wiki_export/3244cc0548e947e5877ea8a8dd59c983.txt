Ivo Knoflíček (born 23 February 1962) is a Czech football coach and a former player. He played for the Czechoslovakia national team, for which he played 38 matches and scored seven goals. At club level, he played mostly for Slavia Prague. Knoflíček played a total of 50 matches in the Gambrinus liga, scoring seven goals.

In 1988, Knoflíček and fellow Czechoslovakian international Luboš Kubík defected to England from a training camp in West Germany. In January 1989, they attempted to sign for Derby County as free agents, and were presented as new signings by the club's then-owner, the Czechoslovak-born Robert Maxwell, during a match against Southampton. However, both players were still under contract with Slavia Prague, who refused to allow the players to transfer. 

He was a participant at the 1990 FIFA World Cup.
