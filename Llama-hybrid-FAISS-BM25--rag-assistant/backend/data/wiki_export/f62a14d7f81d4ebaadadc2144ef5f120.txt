Wig Wamania is the second studio album by Norwegian glam metal band Wig Wam. The album was released on 13 March, 2006, and produced by the band's guitarist Trond Holter. The album's first single "Gonna Get You Someday" was released on 7 February, 2006 and was also featured on the soundtrack for the Norwegian 2006 movie Lange Flate Ballær. Two bonus tracks were added for the Japanese version of the album, "After the Nine O'Clock News" and "Flying High", the latter being the first recording with bassist Bernt Jansen singing lead vocals. 

In October 2006, Wig Wam released an acoustic version of the album's song "Bygone Zone" and performed the single for TV-aksjonen, an annual national Norwegian charity fund raising event, with all the sale proceeds from the single being donated to Médecins Sans Frontières. Wig Wamania is certified gold in Norway.
