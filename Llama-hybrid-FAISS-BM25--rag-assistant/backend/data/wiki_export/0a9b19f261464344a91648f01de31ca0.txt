Nýtt Líf (, English: New Life) is an Icelandic film directed by Þráinn Bertelsson and released in 1983. The film is a comedy shot in the Westman Islands and stars Eggert Þorleifsson and Karl Ágúst Úlfsson, among others. The music features several musicians including the band Tappi Tíkarrass (of which Björk was a member), which contributed the songs "Sperglar" and "Kukl" (a.k.a. "Seiður").

Synopsis
The film is the first of three about the misadventures of two friends, Þór and Danni. Two friends working at a restaurant get fired from their jobs and after seeing an advertisement for the fishing industry of the Westman Islands, decide to go there and make some money. The islands become a perfect setting for many funny and strange situations, especially after word gets around that the two are spies from the Ministry of Fisheries.
