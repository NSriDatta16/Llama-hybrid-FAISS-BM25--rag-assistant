Early life
Forrester, the son of physician James S. Forrester, grew up as a surfer in Malibu, California. As an undergraduate John Jay Scholar at Columbia University he worked on the university's student TV station, and returned to Los Angeles to begin a career as a TV writer. At Columbia, he roomed with future Chattanooga mayor Tim Kelly in Carman Hall.

Career
Forrester wrote for The Simpsons between 1993 and 1997. He wrote the episodes: "Homer vs. Patty and Selma", "Lemon of Troy", the Krusty Burger segment of "22 Short Films About Springfield", and "Homerpalooza". "Homerpalooza" was based on a story by David X. Cohen, although Forrester wrote the script. To do research for the episode, Forrester went to one of the Lollapalooza concerts, which ended up being a horrible experience. Several of the jokes in the episode are based on his experiences: cameras (including his own) were being seized and thrown in the garbage, there were numerous advertisements, several "sour faced teens", a real freak show and at one point a stranger approached Forrester and asked "how's it going, nark?"

Forrester has also served as executive producer on King of the Hill, and written for The Ben Stiller Show, Mr. Show with Bob and David and Undeclared. He served as a writer and consulting producer on The Office. He has written seven episodes of the show including "The Merger" and "Business School" and directed the episode "Casual Friday". He also directed a 2008 series of webisodes of the show, and wrote the NBC.com web series In Gayle We Trust.

He also wrote the screenplay for the 1996 film The Stupids. Forrester is writing the film The Low Self Esteem of Lizzie Gillespie with Mindy Kaling, and a sitcom pilot for Ron Howard.

Forrester also voiced Leon the Drug Addict in the episode of King of the Hill "Junkie Business".

In May 2012, he became an executive producer for the final season of The Office. In 2014, Netflix announced a two-season comedy series entitled Love co-created by director Judd Apatow, Paul Rust, and Lesley Arfin, with Forrester as executive producer.
