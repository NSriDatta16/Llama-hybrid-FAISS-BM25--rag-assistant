The How Weird Street Faire is an outdoor street fair held each year in San Francisco, occupying several blocks of Howard Street and the surrounding area, in the SoMa neighborhood. The event has been held yearly since 2000, and is currently centered at the intersection of Howard and Second Streets. The How Weird Street Faire claims to be the longest-running electronic music street festival in North America, showcasing diverse forms of dance music including live electronica, downtempo, breaks, electro, trance, house, techno, dubstep, drum & bass, dub, and world beat. As of 2017, it had several thousand visitors, many of which come dressed in costumes.

History

The event is a project of (and fundraiser for) the non-profit World Peace Through Technology Organization, which describes it as "an experiment in creating peace" that brings a diverse audience together to find similarities and common ground, to accept and appreciate differences, and to celebrate creativity and peace. There are many stages of music, performances, and vendors from around the world at the event. The event also features live and exhibited artwork, including an area called "Art Alley". Occurring in late Spring, the How Weird Street Faire is considered by many to be the start of San Francisco's street fair and outdoor event season. The name "How Weird Street Faire" alludes to the venue, Howard Street, as well as the street's namesake William Davis Merry Howard (1819-1856).

The festival has included workshops, fashion shows, and even a "peace game". Several charities set up booths with information about topics such as peace and sustainability. Some of the speakers who have talked about technology and peace include R. U. Sirius, Joe Firmage, Craig Newmark (founder of Craigslist), and San Francisco City Supervisors Mark Leno and Chris Daly.

In 2003, a CD was released titled "How Weird Street Faire CD Vol. 1" featuring ten songs from artists who had played at the event. The album features songs from Irina Mikhailova, Adam Ohana, Shakatura, Quasar, Penta, Ocelot, Biodegradable, Kode IV, Waterjuice, and Bassnectar. The album was released by Ceiba Records. The mission of the album and the music was to inspire peace.
