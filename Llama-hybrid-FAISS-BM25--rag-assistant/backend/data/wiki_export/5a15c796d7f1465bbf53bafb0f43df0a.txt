Dmitri Valerievich Tertyshny (; December 26, 1976 – July 23, 1999) was a Russian professional ice hockey defenceman. He played one season, 1998–99, in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Philadelphia Flyers and four seasons in the Russian Superleague for Traktor Chelyabinsk from 1994 to 1998. He died in 1999 during a boating accident.

Playing career
After spending a year with Traktor Chelyabinsk of the CIS/Russian League, Tertyshny was selected in the sixth round by the Philadelphia Flyers with the 132nd overall draft pick in the 1995 NHL Entry Draft. He spent three more seasons with Chelyabinsk before joining the Flyers in the 1998–99 season.

Fatal accident
On July 23, 1999, during the offseason after his rookie NHL campaign, Tertyshny was on a boating trip to Okanagan Lake in British Columbia with two players from the Flyers' minor-league affiliate Philadelphia Phantoms, Francis Belanger and Mikhail Chernov, when he suffered fatal injuries in a freak accident. Tertyshny fell forward out of the boat after it hit a wave, the boat ran over him, and its propeller slashed his neck and his jugular vein.
