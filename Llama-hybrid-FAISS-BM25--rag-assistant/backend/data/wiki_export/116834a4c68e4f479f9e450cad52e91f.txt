"Get Down on It" is a 1981 song by American band Kool & the Gang. It was originally released on their Something Special album in 1981. The single was certified Gold by the RIAA.

Blue version

In 2004, British pop group Blue recorded the song from their greatest hits compilation Best of Blue, featured Kool & the Gang and American rapper Lil' Kim. The song was released as the second single in Japan and across Europe except in the UK. Blue's version became a hit in mainland Europe, including Spain, where it reached number three and spent eight weeks in the top 20.

Critical reception
Sarah Harris of the Evening Chronicle praised the single scribing "There isn't much to say about this single, apart from yet again we are treated to another great single from hit band Blue. This time they have teamed up with Kool & the Gang and Lil' Kim, to produce a great cover of Get Down On It, originally released by Kool & the Gang." She continued saying "The whole band seems to be involved, and it's a great song to dance to." Music Week also noted "Blue have added rap sections, most notably a sassy contribution from Lil' Kim, to the hand-clapping funk of James Taylor and the Gangs' original version."
