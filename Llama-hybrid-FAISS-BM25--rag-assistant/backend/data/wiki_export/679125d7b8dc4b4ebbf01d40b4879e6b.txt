Aello Peak is the highest peak of a mountain group called The Twaharpies, just west of Mount Bona in the Saint Elias Mountains of Alaska. While not highly significant in terms of prominence or isolation (it is just  west of the summit of Mount Bona), it has a tremendous south face. From the summit, this face drops  in just over , and  in less than . In terms of vertical relief and steepness, this is one of the major faces in North America.

The Twaharpies also include two other named summits, Ocypete Peak and Celeno Peak, to the southwest of Aello Peak.
Other summits of the Mount Bona massif include University Peak, also a peak with huge, steep relief, and Mount Churchill, a higher but much gentler peak.
