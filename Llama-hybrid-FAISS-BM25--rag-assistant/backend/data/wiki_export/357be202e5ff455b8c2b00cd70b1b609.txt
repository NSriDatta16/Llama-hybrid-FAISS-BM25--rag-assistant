History

École secondaire Confédération takes its roots in 1955 when the nuns of Sacré-Coeur established a 9th and 10th grade in their French parochial school, offering French scholastic studies. However, students at that time, were required to pay in order to attend the school and after completing their 10th grade, had to follow their studies and adapt themselves to a completely Anglophone school. In 1959, École secondaire Sacré-Coeur was founded, organized solely by these nuns and soon after, Eastdale Secondary School began offering French courses to its students. In 1964 École secondaire Sacré-Coeur was officially built on Tanguay Street leading to its being bought and adopted by the Conseil Scolaire du Niagara-Sud in 1968 – École secondaire Confédération was officially founded. At this point, the school housed more than 500 students and 37 professors serving Welland, Niagara Falls, Port Colborne and St. Catharines. Respective of its heritage, the school adopted a new motto; "Double héritage, double effort".

In 1971 École secondaire Confédération's statistics grew exponentially, now serving nearly 900 students with 50 professors,  leading to the construction of the south wing where a variety of workshops and classes are added. Finally, in 1999 Confédération accommodated grade 7 and 8 students residing in the area – this program proved very successful. Today, Confédération remains a unique French public secondary school offering a reputation and ambiance based on morals, culture, academics and athletics. The school prides itself on offering "une education sans comparaison" or "unparalleled education".

Academics

The school offered 129 different courses from grades 7 to 12. In addition to academic courses, the school boasted a variety of specialized classes such as Business and Marketing, Hospitality and Tourism, as well as AutoCad.  École secondaire Confédération also offered two Specialist High Skills Majors in Hospitality/Tourism and Construction.
