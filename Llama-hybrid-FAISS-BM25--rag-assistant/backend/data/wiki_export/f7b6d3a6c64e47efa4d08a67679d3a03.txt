Hi Tech Expressions (later Hi Tech Entertainment) was an American video game publisher  headquartered in Lower Manhattan, New York City. The company was established in 1986. During the course of its existence, the company published primarily juvenile-oriented games. While it published a few adolescent-oriented games including The Hunt for Red October and War in Middle Earth (derived from the classic book The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien), it could not shake its reputation for publishing games marketed towards children. It was closed down in 1995.
