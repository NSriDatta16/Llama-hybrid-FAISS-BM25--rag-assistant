Taubaté Prison, an infamous correctional facility nestled in the city of Taubaté, São Paulo, Brazil, has gained notoriety due to its reputation for housing some of the most violent offenders known to mankind. This penitentiary has been plagued by a series of recurring prison riots and disturbances, further solidifying its status as a hotbed of unrest. Furthermore, it holds the distinction of being the birthplace of the Primeiro Comando da Capital, an influential criminal gang that has left an indelible mark on the annals of criminal history.

Riots

December 19, 2000 Riots

On December 19, 2000, a prison uprising ended at Taubaté Prison and the prison released more than 20 hostages on Monday, ending an uprising at a maximum security facility that left nine prisoners dead, officials said.

The rebellion at the Taubate House of Custody and Psychiatric Treatment, about 80 miles outside Sao Paulo, began during visiting hours Sunday when an inmate opened fire with a revolver, provoking a fight with prisoners from another pavilion.

Taking advantage of the confusion, prisoners took 23 hostages including four children.

Inmates began releasing hostages in small groups Monday after authorities agreed to transfer 10 prisoners to another facility. The hostages, all of whom were unhurt said the prisoners treated them well during the ordeal.

The department said the nine victims were probably killed in a settling of scores between rival gangs.
