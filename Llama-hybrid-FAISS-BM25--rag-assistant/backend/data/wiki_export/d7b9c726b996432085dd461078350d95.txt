As a singles skater, she won the gold medal at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships six times and competed three times in the Olympics, capturing a bronze medal in 1920.  With Niles, she won the national pairs title nine times and also participated in the Olympics three times.

Blanchard was also the long-time volunteer editor of the United States Figure Skating Association's official publication, Skating magazine; first jointly  with Niles from the magazine's founding in 1923, and then as sole editor after his death in 1931, until 1963.  The magazine was originally published out of her home.  Her long competitive career gave her many contacts throughout the skating world.  She also served as the first chair of the association's Professionals Committee from 1937 to 1947.
