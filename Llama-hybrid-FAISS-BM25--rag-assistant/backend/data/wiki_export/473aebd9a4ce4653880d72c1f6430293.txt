Inspirational seminars 
Since the late 1980s, Morshower has been a speaker at seminars. His speaking career began with his audition mastery course, The Extra Mile, which he took across the country on the advice of his agent. In the early 2000s, Morshower's speeches to actors about auditioning led to an invitation to speak at Exxon,  and more seminars followed. Morshower prefers to describe his talk as "inspirational" rather than "motivational", and has said that he enjoys giving these speeches even more than acting.
