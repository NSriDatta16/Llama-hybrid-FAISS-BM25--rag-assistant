Playing career

Club

St. Gallen
Barnetta started his career with his hometown team, St. Gallen for the 2002–2003 season. During his first professional season, he earned 30 appearances and scored 5 goals.

Bayer Leverkusen
Barnetta's debut season in Switzerland was noticed abroad and was soon snapped up by German side Bayer Leverkusen in January 2004.
During his first season at Bayer, he had a loan spell at Hannover 96, returning to Bayer in March 2005.

After a good showing at the World Cup in Germany, Barnetta became a regular in the Bayer squad. The 2008–09 season was one to forget for him, after Bayer finished two places lower than the previous season and his goals tally dropped slightly. During the summer transfer window, he was linked with a move away from Bayer as his place in the squad seemed under threat from loanee Toni Kroos. Barnetta regained his good form in the 2009–10 season, scoring a brace in only his second league game of the season and contributing to Bayer's unbeaten run for the entire first half of the season.

Schalke 04/Eintracht Frankfurt
On 2 July 2012, after his contract ran out at Bayer Leverkusen, Schalke 04 confirmed that Barnetta signed a three-year professional contract with them until 30 June 2015, and in preparation for the Gelsenkirchen club's participation in the Champions League. The transfer was reported as a free transfer by Schalke's sport and communications manager Horst Heldt. Barnetta was assigned a number 27 shirt, previously worn by Ciprian Deac. In the 2013–14 season, Barnetta had a season long loan spell at Eintracht Frankfurt, returning to Schalke 04 in June 2014 whom he signed for at the end of the 2011–12 season.

On 23 September 2014, Barnetta scored his first goal for Schalke in his second league match of the 2014–15 season.

Philadelphia Union
On 29 July 2015, Barnetta signed with the Philadelphia Union. Integrating with the Union, who were midway through their season, Barnetta netted his first goal on 20 September, in a home win against the Houston Dynamo.

After a full preseason with the Union, Barnetta led the team as the attacking playmaker during the 2016 season. Registering 5 goals and 4 assists, he helped lead Philadelphia's return to the MLS Cup Playoffs for the first time since 2011. Prior to the conclusion of the 2016 campaign, the Union announced Barnetta would return to Switzerland to rejoin FC St. Gallen. Barnetta cited he wanted to contribute to his hometown club in front of friends and family while he still had the fitness to do so meaningfully. He finished his Philadelphia career with 45 appearances and 6 goals.

Return to St. Gallen
Barnetta signed a contract with St. Gallen on 14 November 2016, starting from 1 January 2017.

At the end of the 2018–19 season, Barnetta decided to retire.
