C.O.R.E. Digital Pictures was a Canadian film and television computer animation special effects studio based in Toronto, and founded at the end of March 1994. Its productions included fully animated television series and feature films. 

C.O.R.E. signed a production partnership deal with Radar Pictures.

History
C.O.R.E. Digital Pictures was started in 1994 by John Mariella, Kyle Menzies, Bob Munroe and William Shatner.

Its first and only animated feature film, The Wild, was distributed by Walt Disney Pictures. It met with unfavorable critical and commercial reaction.

As with most Canadian F/X firms, a rising exchange rate, coupled with a decline in employment due to the economic downturn, would take a negative toll on C.O.R.E. After failing to secure a loan guarantee from the provincial government of Ontario, C.O.R.E. ceased operations on March 15, 2010.
