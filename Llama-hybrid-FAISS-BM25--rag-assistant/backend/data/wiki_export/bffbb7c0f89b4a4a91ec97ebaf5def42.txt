Greg Anderson (born 1970) is an American musician, a co-founder of Southern Lord Records. 

Anderson is the guitarist of stoner doom band Goatsnake, but is also well known for his collaborations with Stephen O'Malley. Together, the duo participated in projects such as the short-lived death/doom metal band Thorr's Hammer, the extreme doom metal band Burning Witch (although Anderson left before the band could record an album), as well as the drone metal bands Sunn O))) and Teeth of Lions Rule the Divine.

Career
Earlier in his career, Anderson was involved with the straight edge hardcore punk bands False Liberty, Brotherhood, Amenity, Statement, Galleon's Lap, and the Revelation Records and indie rock/hardcore punk band Engine Kid.

Both Brotherhood and Galleon's Lap featured future Foo Fighters and Sunny Day Real Estate bass player Nate Mendel.

In 2007, Greg joined Attila Csihar and Oren Ambarchi in a new drone-doom project called Burial Chamber Trio, as well as Ascend, a current project/record with Gentry Densley, the former singer-guitarist of Revelation Records band Iceburn.

In April 1998, Anderson and O'Malley founded the independent, underground label Southern Lord Records, based in Los Angeles, California. The company specializes in doom, sludge, drone, experimental metal, left-field black metal, and, more recently, crust punk.
