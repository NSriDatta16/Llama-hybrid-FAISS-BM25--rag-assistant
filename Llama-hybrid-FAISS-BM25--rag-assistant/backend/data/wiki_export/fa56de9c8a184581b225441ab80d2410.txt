Career

Berry moved to South Dakota in 1897. He homesteaded in Gregory County, moved to Todd County, and finally settled in Mellette County south of Belvidere.  He built up a 30,000 acre (120 km2) ranch raising Hereford cattle and saddle horses.

He called the legislature into special session to legalize 3.2 percent beer and again to enact unemployment insurance. During his tenure, state property tax was abolished, replaced by gross income tax which was replaced by a state sales tax.
