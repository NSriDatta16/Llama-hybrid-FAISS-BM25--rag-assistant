Conduit, often stylized as CONduit, was an annual general interest science fiction and fantasy convention held in May in Salt Lake City, Utah. CONduit was founded in 1989 but took two years to plan its first convention. While there are other genre conventions in Utah, CONduit was the largest general interest convention, and provided a means for professionals to meet and network with other professionals, as well as a way for fans to meet and enjoy each other's company.

CONduit had an annual charity auction to benefit a local charitable cause. This auction originally benefited Reading for the Future, a non-profit organization which promoted literacy through speculative fiction. The RFF Utah Student Writing and Art Contest was sponsored in part by CONduit. However, RFF ceased operation in January 2010. CONduit was a founding member of the Utah Speculative Fiction Council.

Notable local guests have included Brandon Sanderson, L.E. Modesitt, Jr., Tracy Hickman, Anne Wingate, Dan Willis, Bradley Williams, Eric James Stone, James Dashner, Dave Wolverton, Paul Genesse, Kevin Wasden, and Howard Tayler.
