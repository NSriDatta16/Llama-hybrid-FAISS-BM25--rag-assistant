also including teams from under 6s to the under 16s, youth, Bonymaen 2nds, Bonymaen 1sts and Bonymaen Ladies.

In May 2006 Bonymaen RFC were one of the 13 'Rebel' clubs who brought a vote of no confidence against the Welsh Rugby Union, which centered on financing and the handling of former coach Mike Ruddock's departure. The vote failed heavily with only 20 votes for the motion and over 300 against.

In the 2006–07 season, Bonymaen RFC won the Division One West League, but were denied promotion to the Premier League as their grounds were deemed to not meet WRU criteria. This ruling was upheld in an EGM by 67% of members.

In the 2014–15 season, Bonymaen RFC won Division 1 West Central, losing just 2 league games all year, both away against Maesteg Quins and Trebanos. This meant a play off with the winners of Division 1 West, Newcastle Emlyn. Played at a neutral venue in Carmarthen, Emlyn won the game and Bony remained in Division 1 West Central for the following season.

In the 2015–16 season Bonymaen enjoyed less success, finishing 5th in the league that they had won the previous year. As of December 19, 2016, they currently sit top of Division 1 West Central.
