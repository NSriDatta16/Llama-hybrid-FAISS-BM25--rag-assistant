Population

History
Eringhem is first mentioned in documents dating from the 9th century, at which time it was known as Ebersingahem, meaning the homestead of Eberso's people. Until the French Revolution, the settlement belonged to the castellany of Bourbourg. A papal bull issued by Pope Paschal II in 1113 confirmed the Count of Flanders' grant of the land to the Abbey of Bourbourg. In the 12th century, the Count of Guînes founded a convent at Eringhem. The château of Eringhem is mentioned as belonging to Louis of Luxembourg in 1458.
