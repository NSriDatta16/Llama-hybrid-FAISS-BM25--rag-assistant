Mount Notre Dame High School (MND) is a Catholic, college-preparatory high school for young women. The school is affiliated with the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur as a part of the Archdiocese of Cincinnati.

History 
In the early 19th century, Notre Dame Academy was a day and boarding school in downtown Cincinnati. Because of the poor conditions on Sixth Street, the school transferred the boarding school to a serene perch in Reading in 1860.  Three decades later, day school students joined them. MND became a diocesan high school in 1956 and has perpetuated their strong legacy as the oldest all-female academy in Cincinnati.

Academics 
MND offers a curriculum of over 100 courses configured to prepare and develop students for higher education. 20 Advanced Placement (AP) curricula can challenge high schoolers to obtain college credit.
