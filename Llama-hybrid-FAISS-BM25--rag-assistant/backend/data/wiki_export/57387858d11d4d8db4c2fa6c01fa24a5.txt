Claude Plessier (born 1946, Paris) is a French painter, who has worked in France and Argentina.

A graduate of the Arts Décos, the Beaux-Arts and the Allgemeine Gewerbe Schule in Basel he was awarded a scholarship by the Italian government to study mosaic in Ravenna in 1971. He has lived and worked in Paris since 1978.

Initially, his paintings were in an abstract manner very much under the influence of the COBRA (avant-garde movement) movement; he has even been called a Neo-cobra painter. 
His stay in Argentina (1973–1977) saw a radical change in his work. He has since been noted for his liberal and skillful use of vivid and contrasted colours and his enigmatic figures drawn without perspective at various scales and on various planes, sometimes emerging from a layer of paint beneath another one. In his "recouvrements" series, he sometimes even covered older works with thick layers of black paint.

In his recent paintings he has used lighter colours, and the figures are less numerous.

Plessier has also made a series of drawings in homage to Gabriel García Márquez, and a portrait on wood of the author.
