History 
In 1970, Warren Schwab established TLC in Massachusetts. He focused on a bilingual approach of education focusing on both ASL and the English language. Initially the school had a student-centered curriculum with open classroom format. The school was started with 22 students and expanded in 1975, with the addition of a preschool program, and in 1976 with the addition of a parent-infant program. In 1978, the school established a special needs program for deaf children who have cognitive or behavior disabilities. A high school began in 1980, and a group residence for high school students began the following year.

In 1987, TLC opened Walden House, a comprehensive residential treatment program for deaf youth between the ages of 8 and 22 years who are challenged by social and emotional difficulties. A new facility for these students was completed and occupied in December 1995 and is now called the Walden School. In 1994, the school opened a satellite campus in Randolph, Massachusetts, which was closed in 2011.

In 2010, TLC received full accreditation from The New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC), The Conference of Educational Administrators of Schools and Programs for the Deaf (CEASD) and the Council on Accreditation (COA) and continues to maintain full accreditation with each of them.
