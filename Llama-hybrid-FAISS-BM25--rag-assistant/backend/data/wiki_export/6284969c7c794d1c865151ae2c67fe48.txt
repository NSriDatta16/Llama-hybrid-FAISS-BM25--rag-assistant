The Episcopal Diocese of Springfield is a diocese of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America.  It is located in the state of Illinois and includes the area east of the Illinois River and south of the Counties of Woodford, Livingston, Ford, and Iroquois. The diocese was founded when the former Episcopal Diocese of Illinois split into three separate Dioceses (Springfield, Quincy, and Chicago) in 1877. 
 
On December 11, 2021, the Diocese elected the Very Rev. Brian K. Burgess of Woodbury, New Jersey to serve as the 12th Bishop of Springfield.
