Guizi () is a pejorative Chinese slang term for foreigners. It has had a history of containing xenophobic connotations.

History
Starting with the arrival of European sailors in the sixteenth century, foreigners were often perceived in China as "uncivilized tribes given to mayhem and destruction". Within the southern parts of China, the term gweilo (鬼佬) was used and remains popular today, especially in the Cantonese speaking region of Hong Kong. In northern parts, the term "Occidental devil" (西洋鬼子 xiyáng guǐzi) was used, with Europe being West of China.

Usage
The term gui (鬼) in guizi (鬼子) is an adjective that can be used to express hate and deprecation, an example being the local's expression of their hatred towards the Japanese during their occupation of China in World War II with the same gui (鬼). It conveys a general bad and negative feeling and is a somewhat obsolete and archaic/old-fashioned term nowadays; other more modern terms have largely replaced gui (鬼) for similarly negative meanings.

The character gui (鬼) itself can have negative connotations, even without the word zi (子). For example, when it was attached to the Westerners in the term yang guizi (洋鬼子; lit. "overseas devils") during the Boxer Rebellion, to the Japanese military in the term guizi bing (鬼子兵; lit. "devil soldiers") during the Second Sino-Japanese War, and to the Korean collaborators with the term er guizi (二鬼子; lit. "second-rank devil"). However, the same term can also be applied derogatorily to any foreign military which was an enemy to China. In Taiwan, anti-Japanese demonstrators from the New Party hoisted signs with "Guizi! Get out" (鬼子! 快滾) during the 2012 China anti-Japanese demonstrations.

A similar word in English is "Uncle Chan", which is derived from Uncle Tom and used to describe a xenophilic Hongkonger (and by further extension any westernized Chinese, regardless of mainland or overseas origin) who are perceived as loathing Chinese identity, supporting Hong Kong independence and pandering to sinophobia in order to gain favor from Westerners.
