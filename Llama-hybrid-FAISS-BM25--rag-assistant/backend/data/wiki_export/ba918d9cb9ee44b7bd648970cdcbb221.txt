It provides theological education for ministry candidates and members of the laity. It is an approved teaching institution of the Australian College of Theology.

History
The Presbyterian Church of New South Wales established the theological hall in 1873, to train Presbyterian ministers in accordance with the Westminster Confession of Faith, including the Presbyterian Church of Australia's later Declaratory Statement of 1901. It was located in St Andrew's College at the University of Sydney, and from the early 1920s co-operated with the Methodist and Congregational colleges under the United Faculty of Theology. In 1987 the then Presbyterian Training Centre moved to Shaftesbury Road Burwood, was renamed as the Presbyterian Theological Centre, Burwood and expanded its scope to include training of the laity, as well as  elders, missionaries, deaconesses, chaplains, church planters, and youth workers.

The dean of the college in the early years in Burwood was John Davies, who served as principal and lecturer in Hebrew and Old Testament exegesis. In 2010 Ian Smith took over from Davies as principal. The institution was renamed Christ College in 2014.
