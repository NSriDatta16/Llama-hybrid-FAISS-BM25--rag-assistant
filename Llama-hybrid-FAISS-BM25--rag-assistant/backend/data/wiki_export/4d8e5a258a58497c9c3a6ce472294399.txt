Ryderwood is a census-designated place (CDP) in Cowlitz County, Washington, west of the city of Vader. Known locally as the "Village in the Woods", the town began in 1923 as a logging settlement and considered itself the "World's Largest Logging Town". Ryderwood became a retirement community in the 1950s.

History 
Ryderwood, originally named Cougar Flats, was established as a logging camp by the Long-Bell Lumber Company in 1923. The town was constructed at a cost of $1.5 million and was the largest community to be built by private funding. Simultaneously, the town of Longview was created to mill and ship the lumber coming out of Ryderwood. Ryderwood was named for W. F. ("Uncle Bill") Ryder, the logging operations manager for Long-Bell, who came to the northwest to locate a timber source. The community was envisioned beyond that of a temporary logging camp, as a permanent center that would contain a school, church and theater. Billed as a place for families to live rather than bachelor workers, Ryderwood was considered a "modern logging town", as an article in The Log of Long-Bell proclaimed.

By 1953, due to advances in timber harvesting technology and the loss of old growth timber, Long-Bell sold the town. It was purchased by Senior Estates, Inc. for $96,000 with the goal of creating a retirement community for pensioners. The town built Ryderwood Lake in 1956, encompassing 6 acres inside an existing gravel pit.

In the 1980s, Ryderwood was home to the beginning of the Winlock Pickersfest, originally a bluegrass festival. The event relocated to Winlock in 2000. , the festival continues to be held.

Ryderwood held a town-wide centennial celebration in 2023. Featuring a pioneer costumed parade, the event included the opening of a time capsule.
