History
In the 2005–06 season, Trofense played in the Portuguese Second Division, winning its group by six points. The club then progressed to a playoff that decided promotion to the second level, with Serie B winners A.D. Lousada; Trofense won in an emotional game, only decided on the 20th penalty, scored by goalkeeper Vítor.

In 2007–08 (having finished 11th in the league the previous season), Trofense achieved a first ever promotion to the top division, and conquered its second piece of silverware, winning by a small margin over Rio Ave FC (the first four teams were separated by just two points).

On 4 January 2009, Trofense managed an historical home win, beating S.L. Benfica 2–0, courtesy of Reguila and FC Porto loanee Hélder Barbosa, that then placed the side above the relegation zone. The following week, it achieved a 0–0 draw at the Estádio do Dragão against Porto, but the club would be eventually relegated.
