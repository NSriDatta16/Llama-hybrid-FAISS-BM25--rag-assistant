Christian Brothers Academy (also known as CBA or "The Academy"), located in the Lincroft section of Middletown Township, New Jersey, is a private, all-boys preparatory school for grades nine to twelve, with a focus on Christian education. The school is run by the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools, founded by St. Jean-Baptiste de La Salle. Christian Brothers Academy was originally a farm owned by the prominent Whitney family of New York City, and home to their renowned Greentree Stable. The land was eventually given to the Christian Brothers for the purpose of teaching. The school opened for the first time in September 1959 and was blessed by the Bishop of Trenton on October 11, 1959. Christian Brothers Academy operates independently from the Roman Catholic Diocese of Trenton and is governed by a board of trustees.

As of the 2019–20 school year, the school had an enrollment of 876 students and 66.1 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 13.3:1. The school's student body was 83.4% (731) White, 10.2% (89) Hispanic and 4.5% (39) two or more races, 1.5% (13) Asian, 0.5% (4) Black.

The school has been accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Elementary and Secondary Schools since 1967.

History
The site of Christian Brothers Academy was originally a farm owned by the prominent Whitney family of New York City, and home to their renowned Greentree Stable.

Christian Brothers Academy was founded in 1958, when a group of devoted laymen, including Doctor George A. Sheehan, realized the need for another Catholic high school in Monmouth County. With the approval of the bishop, they initiated a drive to raise funds for the purchase of a piece of property. The Brothers of the Christian Schools, under the leadership of their provincial, Brother Anthony John Halpin, agreed to staff the school and finance its construction.

The former Whitney Greentree Stables, a  farm, was purchased and one building was converted into what is now Henderson Hall. With six Brothers on the teaching staff, the school opened for the first time in September 1959 with an inaugural ninth grade class of 140 students, with classrooms built in a converted horse stable. The school was blessed by the Bishop of Trenton on October 11, 1959

A brick school building with 12 classrooms and science labs, constructed at a cost of $1.8 million (equivalent to $ million in ), opened in September 1962 with 700 students in grades 9-12.

Over the years, the school has undergone many additions and renovations, including the building of the Henderson Theater, three science labs, two large gyms, and extra classrooms. The school's Christian emphasis is noted by a sign in the lobby which reads: "Jesus is the reason for this school, the unseen but ever-present teacher in its classes, the model of the faculty and the inspiration of its students."  Before school begins and at the start of every class, prayers are offered in the Lasallian manner, beginning "Let us remember we are in the Holy Presence of God" and ending with the invocations, "St. John Baptist de La Salle, pray for us." "Live Jesus in our Hearts. Forever!"

Athletics
The Christian Brothers Academy Colts have competed since 1982 in Division A North of the Shore Conference, which is comprised of public and private high schools in Monmouth and Ocean counties on the Northern Jersey Shore. The conference operates under the jurisdiction of the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association (NJSIAA). Since entering, the Colts have won over 240 Shore Conference championships. With 1,386 students in grades 10–12, the school was classified by the NJSIAA for the 2019–20 school year as Non-Public A for most athletic competition purposes, which included schools with an enrollment of 381 to 1,454 students in that grade range (equivalent to Group I for public schools).

CBA has been a member of the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association (NJSIAA) since the early 1960s. Since winning their first state title in 1965 (basketball), CBA has won over 145 state championships. At CBA, all sports are governed by the NJSIAA, with the exception of crew, rugby and sailing, which have independent governing bodies. Christian Brothers does not field an interscholastic football program.

Christian Brothers Academy has been recognized nine times by the NJSIAA as the Group A Non-Public winner of the annual ShopRite Cup, which is awarded for overall achievement by athletics programs in the state.
