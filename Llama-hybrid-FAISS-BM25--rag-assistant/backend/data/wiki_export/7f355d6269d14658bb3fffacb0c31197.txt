Finghall is a village and civil parish in the Richmondshire district of North Yorkshire, England.

History
The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book as Fingall when it belonged to Count Alan and had 13 villagers. The origin of the place-name is from the Old English words Fin, inga and halt meaning a nook of land of the family or followers of a man called Fina. The place-name appears as Finegala in the Domesday Book of 1086 and as Finyngale in 1157.

In the 1820s, Finghall had a population of 126, which had dropped to 111 by 1872 and 99 by 1897. In 2001, the population had risen to 178, and this had decreased to 166 at the 2011 census. Both censuses are for the Finghall parish which includes the hamlet of Akebar.  It is located south of the A684 road, about  west of Bedale and about  east of Leyburn. The church is dedicated to St. Andrew. the 12th century church is adjacent to the beck and quite near the A684 road. It is thought that the Medieval village of Fingall was clustered around the church, but was abandoned during a plague.
