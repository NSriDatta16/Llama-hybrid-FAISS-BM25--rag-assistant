Masaru Edward Fulenwider-Musashi (born April 26, 1977 in Rikuzentakata, Iwate, Japan), better known by the stage name , is a Wushu martial artist and a stuntman/actor or Gaijin tarento.

Raised in Buckfield, Maine, he attended Dartmouth College (Class of 1999), majoring in East Asian Languages and Literatures and minoring in Drama.

He took the fall term of his senior year there to go to China to study Northern Shaolin Kung Fu. After college, he moved to Japan, where, after getting his start doing a women's underwear commercial, he was soon recruited by AAC Stunts.

Since then, he has worked on various tokusatsu series as a stunt/suit actor and even as a regular.  Best known for his role as the mysterious murderer named Piece in the live-action drama Sh15uya, Musashi was also seen in Cutie Honey: The Live as Duke Seiya Anthony Watari IV, a bilingual gentleman in the service of the organization Panther Claw. He has participated in several Wushu competition championships and he has done motion capture for several video games. In 2008, he moved to Los Angeles to pursue American acting and stunt opportunities.

Since then, he's largely worked as a stunt performer in films, television shows and video games, with scattered speaking parts. In 2022, he was cast as Hansel, a High Table assassin, in The Continental: From the World of John Wick, a miniseries that premiered on Peacock in 2023.
