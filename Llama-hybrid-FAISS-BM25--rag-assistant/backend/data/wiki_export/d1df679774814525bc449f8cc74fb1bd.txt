Beyond Westworld is a 1980 American television series based on the 1973 film Westworld, which was written and directed by Michael Crichton. Although the DVD box cover mentions that it follows the film's events, it ignored the 1976 film sequel Futureworld.

Broadcast and reception
The series was nominated for two Primetime Emmy Awards (Outstanding Achievement in Makeup and Outstanding Art Direction For a Series), though only five episodes were produced. Only three of these episodes aired by CBS before cancellation.

In the United Kingdom all five episodes were shown by some ITV regions separately, starting with Granada Television, which aired the first four episodes between August 2 and 23, 1980 in an early-evening slot, but delayed the fifth until a morning slot on January 7, 1981. Across the nine regions which showed the "full" series, many showed episodes 2â€“5 in differing random orders, and only Yorkshire Television showed them more than once. Ulster Television only showed two episodes, six months apart. Thames Television aired all five episodes in an early afternoon slot during the summer of 1982.

Home media
On July 29, 2014, Warner Home Video released the complete series on DVD-R in Region 1 via their Warner Archive Collection manufactured-on-demand service.
