Juan Antonio Marín Casero (born 2 March 1975) is a former professional male tennis player from Costa Rica.

He originally played on tour under the Spanish flag, as he was born to a father from Murcia and a mother from Asturias, and lived in Spain since the age of 14. However, in May 1998 he began representing Costa Rica.

In October 1999, Marín reached his career-high singles ranking of world No. 55. Previously that year he came close to beating the then-world No. 2 Pete Sampras at the 1999 French Open, with the American eventually winning 6–7, 6–4, 7–5, 6–7, 6–4. He never won a Grand Slam main draw match, despite appearing in 17.
