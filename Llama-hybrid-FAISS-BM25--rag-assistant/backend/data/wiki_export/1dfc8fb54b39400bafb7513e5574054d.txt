History

Erdinger is the world's largest wheat beer brewery. It is widely available and popular across Germany and the European Union. Erdinger was founded in 1886 by Johann Kienle. Erdinger beer is the best-known culinary product of the town; however, the brewery did not receive its current name until 1949 from its owner Franz Brombach, who had acquired the brewery 14 years earlier.
The current owner is Franz Brombach's son, Werner Brombach (since 1975). Currently, there are ten varieties available:
