Shankara  Baaladeekshita Joshi (1896â€“ 28 Sep 1991), popularly referred to as Sham Ba  Joshi, was an authority on the culture of Karnataka.  Joshi was known for his unique and distinctive style of research. The range of his interests, study, research and thinking was very extensive.  As a result, he was able to do seminal research in linguistic analysis including the historical names of different places, divine imagery and religious symbolism.  Kannada Pustaka Praadhikara has brought out a collection of all his works in 1999 in a six-volume publication. He spent most time in Sadankeri in Dharwad, India.

He was born on 4 January 1896 in Gurlhosur village located in Saundatti taluka of Belgaum district, Karnataka.
