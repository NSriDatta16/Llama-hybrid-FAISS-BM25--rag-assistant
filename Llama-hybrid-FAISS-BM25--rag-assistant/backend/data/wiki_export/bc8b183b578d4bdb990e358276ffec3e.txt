In Dec 1994, refining capacity was increased to 7.5 million tonnes per year along with revamp of FCCU to 1.4 million tonnes per year. A fuel gas de-sulphurisation unit was installed as part of this project to minimise sulphur dioxide emission. CRL entered into petrochemical sector in 1989 when aromatic production facilities with a design capacity of 87,200 tonnes per year of benzene and 12,000 tons per annum of toluene was commissioned. In the year 2000, a 2 million tonnes per year Diesel Hydro De-sulphurisation (DHDS) plant was added to reduce the sulphur content in diesel.

In August 2010, the refining capacity was further increased to 9.5 million tonnes per year.

A captive power plant of 26.3 MW was commissioned in 1991. An additional captive power plant of 17.8 MW was commissioned in 1998 thus making the refinery self-sufficient in power.

An LPG bottling plant of capacity 44,000 tonnes per year was commissioned in 2003. A Bitumen Emulsion plant of 10000 tonnes per year capacity has also been commissioned in 2004.

A Biturox Bitumen Oxidation Unit of 378,000 tonnes per year capacity was successfully commissioned and started-up in 2008.
