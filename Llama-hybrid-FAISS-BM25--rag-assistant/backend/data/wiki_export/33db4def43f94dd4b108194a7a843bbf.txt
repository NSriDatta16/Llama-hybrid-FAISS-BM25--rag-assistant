History
The district is named after an extinct village and known to have existed since the early 17th century as an estate of the Romanovs and later the Naryshkin family. Strogino was engulfed by Moscow in 1960 and became a popular summertime venue thanks to its beaches. In the 1970s, the construction of apartment buildings in the area was started, and a microdistrict was built. Stroginsky Boulevard () is the main artery of Strogino.

Soviet statesmen Mikhail Suslov and Konstantin Chernenko had a Gosdacha in the settlement Troitse-Lykovo (Троице-Лыково).
