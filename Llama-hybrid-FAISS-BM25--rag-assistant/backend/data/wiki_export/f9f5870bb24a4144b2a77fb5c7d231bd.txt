Seabreeze Amusement Park (Seabreeze) is a historic family amusement park located in Irondequoit, New York, a suburb of Rochester, where Irondequoit Bay meets Lake Ontario.  According to the National Amusement Park Historical Association (NAPHA), Seabreeze is the fourth-oldest operating amusement park in the United States and the thirteenth-oldest operating amusement park in the world, having opened in 1879.  The park features roller coasters, a variety of other rides, a midway, and a water park.

History 
In the 1870s, the lakeshore of Lake Ontario became a tourist destination for residents of the city of Rochester.  Several hotels opened at the port of Charlotte and along Irondequoit Bay to entertain summer visitors, and rail lines were built from the city to both destinations.  In 1879, the Rochester and Lake Ontario Railroad Company built a line from Portland Avenue in Rochester to the Sea Breeze neighborhood at the inlet of the bay.  The company purchased fifty acres to open a resort for picnicking and other summer activities, which opened to the public on August 5, 1879.

The Rochester and Lake Ontario Railroad went bankrupt in 1899 and was reorganized as the Rochester and Suburban Railway.  Facing competition from other amusement parks along the bay and lakeshore, the company began adding carnival attractions, and in 1903 the first permanent ride, a figure-eight roller coaster, was built in the park.  By the 1920s, Sea Breeze featured several permanent attractions, including roller coasters, dance halls, a Philadelphia Toboggan Company carousel, and the Natatorium, a large outdoor saltwater pool.  The Natatorium was claimed to be the largest saltwater pool in the world at the time of construction. Fires were a frequent problem and several rides and buildings burned down during this era. 

Sea Breeze was forced to downsize during the Great Depression, and the trolley line to the park, now owned by New York State Railways, was closed in 1936.  George W. Long Jr. began renting the park from New York State Railways in 1937, and purchased it in 1946, changing the name to Dreamland Park.  Long added several rides, including a log flume.

Long retired in 1975 and was succeeded by his grandson, Robert Norris, as president.  Norris renamed the park Seabreeze and launched another wave of additions and improvements to attract families and compete with the new Darien Lake theme park in Corfu, New York. A water park was opened in 1986 and expanded in 2001.  The park's carousel was destroyed in another fire in 1994 and restored two years later.

During the COVID-19 Pandemic, Seabreeze remained closed for the entire 2020 season. Operations resumed during the 2021 season.

 Flying Scooters : A predecessor to the current Seabreeze Flyers. The design and location of the ride were almost exactly the same.
