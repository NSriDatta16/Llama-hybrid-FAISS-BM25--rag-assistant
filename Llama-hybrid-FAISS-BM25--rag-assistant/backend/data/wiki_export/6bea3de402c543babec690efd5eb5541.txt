Exposition Park (or Expo Park) is a neighborhood in south Dallas, Texas (USA). Centered along tree-lined Exposition Avenue, the small enclave stretches from the eastern edge of Deep Ellum to the entrance of Fair Park. The area includes Exposition Plaza, a one acre special use park established in 1984 that features an amphitheater and sculpture areas.

Exposition Park is home to several eclectic bars and restaurants, with small businesses and entertainment venues dotting the street-level storefronts. The neighborhood is also widely known as a budding arts district, attracting many artists and creatives who live and work in the area. Several art galleries, artist and photography studios, and creative offices are located within its borders.

The Gibson Company, a major property owner in the area, has preserved many of the historic buildings and lofts across the neighborhood.
