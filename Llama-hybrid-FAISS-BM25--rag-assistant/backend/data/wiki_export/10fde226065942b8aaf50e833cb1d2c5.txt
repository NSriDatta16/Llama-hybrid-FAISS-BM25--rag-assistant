The Youyi Bridge (, meaning Friendship Bridge, ) is a bridge on the Karakoram Highway  at Thakot in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. Its inauguration was on August 27, 2004.

The bridge spans the Indus river, and was constructed next to a bridge built between 1966 and 1978.  The bridge was given its Chinese name in 2004 to honour the Chinese and Pakistani workers killed in the construction of the Karakoram Highway.
