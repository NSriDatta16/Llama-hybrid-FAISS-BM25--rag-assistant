History
Originally named Thunder Bay Amateur Hockey Association (TBAHA), the organization's name was changed to Hockey Northwestern Ontario (HNO) in 1999 to better reflect the geographical area it served.  The association is responsible for controlling all hockey not controlled by the OHF or the HEO in Ontario.  TBAHA supported a variety of Junior and Senior leagues, including: the Thunder Bay Junior A Hockey League, Thunder Bay Senior Hockey League, North Shore Intermediate Hockey League, Northwestern Ontario Junior Hockey League, and the Thunder Bay Junior B Hockey League, amongst others.

Famous teams from the TBAHA included: Fort William Beavers, Port Arthur Bearcats, Thunder Bay Twins, Fort Frances Royals, Kenora Intermediate Thistles, Kenora Junior Thistles, Kenora Muskies, Fort William Canadians, Westfort Hurricanes, Port Arthur Marrs, Thunder Bay Bombers and Thunder Bay Flyers.

The senior league disbanded over the period of 2011–2016. The Kenora Thistles suspended operations in January 2016. The senior league champion played the southern Ontario Allan Cup Hockey league for the Renwick Cup.
