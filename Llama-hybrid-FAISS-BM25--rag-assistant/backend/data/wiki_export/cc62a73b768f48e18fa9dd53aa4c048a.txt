Kicking a Dead Pig is a remix album from Scottish band Mogwai consisting of remixes of previously released tracks (primarily from Young Team) by various artists, including Alec Empire, My Bloody Valentine, and Max Tundra.

The album was first released in 1998 on the low budget label Eye Q, but they went bust shortly after. It then became relatively hard to find, until "the master tapes mysteriously appeared on Chemikal Underground's doorstep".  The album was re-released on the Chemikal Underground label in 2001, with an additional two tracks forming the basis for a second CD of Mogwai Fear Satan remixes, from My Bloody Valentine, and μ-Ziq. In 1998, the album was licensed by Eye-Q to the now defunct label, Jetset.  The version Jetset released contained all of the Mogwai Fear Satan remixes on a second disc.
