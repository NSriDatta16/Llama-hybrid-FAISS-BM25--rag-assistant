There are also UH-60J Search and Rescue aircraft of one flight which detached from JMSDF 72 Squadron.

History

Tokushima Airport opened as an Imperial Japanese Navy air base in 1941.

The current runway was completed in 1987; it was extended to , with projected completion in 2010.

The airport has had scheduled service to Kagoshima (1997â€“98), Kansai (briefly in 2000), and Osaka/Itami (until 2003). There are 12 scheduled flights per day.

On April 13, 2006, Skymark Airlines discontinued its flights to Tokyo International Airport (Haneda) leaving Japan Airlines as the sole carrier to Tokyo. In response to Skymark's exit, Japan Airlines increased the number of flights between the two cities. Since Tokyo-Haneda opened its fourth runway, All Nippon Airways announced the resumption of service to Tokyo.

A new passenger terminal opened in the first quarter of 2010.

An international terminal facility with a dedicated boarding bridge and waiting area opened in January 2018, mainly to accommodate charter flights from China.

ShinMaywa Industries, Ltd. maintains a plant (primarily aircraft modification and refurbishment) at the airport. The plant also provides components for the Gulfstream G550 [GV-SP] and Kawasaki P-1.
