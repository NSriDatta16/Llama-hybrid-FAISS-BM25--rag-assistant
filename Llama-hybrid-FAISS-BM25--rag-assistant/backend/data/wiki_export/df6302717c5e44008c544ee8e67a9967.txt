Hanukkah or Chanukkah ben Obadiah was a hypothetical Khazar ruler who probably reigned during the mid to late ninth century CE. Hanukkah was the son of Obadiah and succeeded his nephew Manasseh I to the throne. No contemporary records from his reign survive; however, he is known from the Khazar Correspondence between Hisdai ibn Shaprut and the Khazar king Joseph. As with the other Bulanids, it is unclear whether Hanukkah was a khagan or a khagan bek; however, most modern scholars lean towards the latter possibility.  Historical authenticity and accuracy  of the only document mentioning his name has been questioned.

Hanukkah was succeeded by his son Isaac.
