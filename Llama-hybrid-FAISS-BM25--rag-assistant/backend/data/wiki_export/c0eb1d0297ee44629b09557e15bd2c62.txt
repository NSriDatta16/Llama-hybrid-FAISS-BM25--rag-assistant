The Carji Greeves  Medal  is a name given in recent decades to an Australian rules football award given to the player(s) adjudged best and fairest for the Geelong Football Club for the season. 

The voting system has changed a number of times. For the 2017 AFL season, the voting panel consisted of the senior coach, director of coaching and the assistant coaches rating each player out of 15 after every game. The combined votes are averaged to give a final score for that game. To ensure players are not disadvantaged by injury, only a player's highest-scoring 21 games counted.

For the 2022 AFL season, after each game, the senior and assistant coaches reviewed and rated each players performance out of 10. Votes were polled in games where a players performance had been deemed of a high quality by the coaching group, and unlike previous seasons all matches counted towards their final total.

Edward 'Carji' Greeves was a champion Geelong footballer who won the inaugural Brownlow Medal in 1924, awarded to person deemed the best and fairest player in the Victorian Football League.
