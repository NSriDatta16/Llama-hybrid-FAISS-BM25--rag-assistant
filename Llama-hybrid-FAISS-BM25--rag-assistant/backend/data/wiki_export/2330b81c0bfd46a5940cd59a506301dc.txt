Edward Joseph Furgol (March 24, 1917 – March 6, 1997) was an American professional golfer, the winner of the U.S. Open in 1954.

At age twelve, Furgol injured his left elbow when he fell off a set of parallel bars at a playground. Despite several surgeries, the elbow never healed correctly and was left with a crooked arm ten inches (25 cm) shorter as a result. On the recommendation of his doctors, he took up golf.

A Polish American born in New York Mills, New York, Furgol won six times on the PGA Tour, including one major championship, the 1954 U.S. Open. He also played on the Ryder Cup team in 1957. Although he was from the same town as fellow tour player Marty Furgol (1916–2005), they were not related. Furgol died at age 79 in Miami Shores, Florida.
