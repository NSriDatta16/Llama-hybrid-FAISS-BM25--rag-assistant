Dziennik Polska-Europa-Świat () was a Polish nationwide daily newspaper published by Ringier Axel Springer, a joint venture between Germany's Axel Springer Verlag publishing company and Swiss media company Ringier.

History
It was modelled on Springer's Welt Kompakt, the Berliner-style edition of the Hamburg-published broadsheet Die Welt. The first issue was released on 18 April 2006, and in May 2006 it recorded a circulation of 211,610 copies, giving it the third largest circulation amongst national newspapers. Dziennik was envisaged as a competitor to Gazeta Wyborcza, therefore its political profile was more right-wing than its left-liberal rival. In most cases, however, it presented a broad spectrum of views on its pages.

On 14 September 2009 "Dziennik" was merged with Infor Bizness's "Gazeta Prawna" daily to form a new nationwide daily under the title "Dziennik Gazeta Prawna".
