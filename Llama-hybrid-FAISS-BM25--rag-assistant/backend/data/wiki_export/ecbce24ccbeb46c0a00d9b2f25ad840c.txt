Tim McGraw is the debut album by American country music artist of the same name. It was released on April 20, 1993 by Curb Records. It includes the singles "What Room Was the Holiday In", "Welcome to the Club", "Two Steppin' Mind", and "Memory Lane", none of which reached the Top 40 on the country charts. This is the only studio album of McGraw's career not to achieve a music recording sales certification or to enter the Top Country Albums charts.

Content
The album's lead single, "What Room Was the Holiday In", was produced by Doug Johnson; the rest of the album was produced by Byron Gallimore (who has produced all of McGraw's subsequent work) and James Stroud.

The tracks "Memory Lane" and "Tears in the Rain" were co-written by Joe Diffie, the former had been recorded by Keith Palmer on his debut album, while Diffie recorded his own version of "Tears in the Rain" for his 1995 album Life's So Funny. "The Only Thing That I Have Left" had been recorded by George Strait on his 1982 Strait from the Heart album.

Critical reception

Brian Mansfield and Thom Jurek of Allmusic rated the album two and a half stars out of five, saying that it was not memorable aside from three of its singles, but that it showed the "roots of [his] individuality".
