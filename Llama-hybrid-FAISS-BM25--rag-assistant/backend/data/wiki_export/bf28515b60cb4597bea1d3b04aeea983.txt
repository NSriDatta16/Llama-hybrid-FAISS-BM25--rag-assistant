Google Store is a hardware retail store operated by Google that sells Google Pixel devices, Google Nest products, Chromecast dongles, Fitbit devices, and accessories such as earbuds, phone cases, chargers, and keyboards. It also sold Nexus, Daydream, Stadia and Cardboard devices until their discontinuations. Google Store sells products made by Google or made in collaboration with that company. It was introduced on March 11, 2015, and replaced the Devices section of Google Play as Google's hardware retailer. It is overseen by Ana Corrales, who is also the COO of Google's Devices & Services division.

Google has experimented with physical locations as well. In October 2016, it opened a pop-up shop in New York City to display its then-recently announced hardware products, and the following month it opened "Google Shops", store-within-a-store locations at select Best Buy stores in Canada. In 2021, Google announced that they would be opening a physical Google Store as part of its Chelsea Market campus in New York City, which opened on June 17.

Pop-up stores

London 
In March 2015, Google opened a store-within-a-store within a branch of British electrical retailer Currys, at Tottenham Court Road, London.

Pop-up showroom 

In October 2016, Google opened Made by Google, a temporary pop-up showroom in the SoHo neighborhood of New York City. The space offered a glimpse at hardware products the company had recently developed, including the Pixel smartphone, Google Home smart speaker, and Daydream View virtual reality headset.

Best Buy 
In November 2016, Google opened "Google Shop", a store-within-a-store where Google displays its hardware products. The Google Shops, available at select Best Buy locations in Canada, gives Google a retail presence that's "been key to building a premium mobile device customer base that’s sizable and loyal, and it’s not something Google has really had with its previous Nexus program". The Shops are "distinctly Google", with visual aesthetics featuring "light wood grain and gray fabric pairing up with playful hints of bright colors", along with "custom-created modular furniture that nests when standing room is limited, but can easily accommodate, say, a small group of students with stool seating in a pinch". In a comment to TechCrunch, Janell Fischer, Google's Director of Retail Marketing, said that "We love it when people can come in, discover, play and have fun and it just happens to be with technology. So we’ve really tried to layer on lots of different immersive sorts of experiences, some that are direct demonstrations of the product and product features, but some that are more exploratory and fun". Each Google Shop "could have unique digital content tailored to the city wherein it resides".

Brick-and-mortar

Chelsea Market 
In May 2021, Google announced that it would be opening a physical retail store as part of its Chelsea Market campus in New York City, next to its New York offices.
