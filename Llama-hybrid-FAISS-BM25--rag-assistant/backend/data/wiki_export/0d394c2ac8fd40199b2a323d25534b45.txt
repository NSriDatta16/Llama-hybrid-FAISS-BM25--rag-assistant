Microcoelus (meaning "small hollow") is a dubious genus of small titanosaurian sauropod dinosaur from the Bajo de la Carpa Formation, Argentina. It is known from only a single dorsal vertebra. A left humerus was formerly referred to this species, but it is now considered to belong to Neuquensaurus. This species is considered a nomen dubium.

It was described by British paleontologist Richard Lydekker in 1893.
