"Agadoo" is a novelty song recorded by the British band Black Lace in 1984. "Agadoo" peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart, and spent 30 weeks in the top 75. It went on to become the eighth best-selling single of 1984 in the UK, (and over one million copies worldwide) despite not being included on the playlist for BBC Radio 1 because it "was not credible".

In a survey for dotmusic in 2000, respondents voted "Agadoo" as the fourth most annoying song of all time. A 2003 poll for Q magazine saw a panel of music writers vote "Agadoo" as the worst song of all time, saying: "It sounded like the school disco you were forced to attend, your middle-aged relatives forming a conga at a wedding party, a travelling DJ act based in Wolverhampton, every party cliche you ever heard." The panel also described it as "magnificently dreadful".

Origins and recording
The song's origins date back to 1970, when Michel Delancray and Mya Symille recorded it as "Agadou" in French. It had been written based on a tune that had apparently come from Morocco. Club Med used it as their theme song from 1974. It was covered by several artists and groups, including Patrick Zabé in 1975 and the  (a German group) in 1981 (and a remix in 1986); their version was the first in English. Black Lace uses the lyrics first used in The Snowmen's 1981 cover of "Agadou", which was also the first cover to spell the song's title as "Agadoo". These lyrics are based on the lyrics of the Saragossa Band version but with minor tweaks.

The Black Lace group was made up during its heyday by the duo of performers Colin Gibb and Alan Barton. One of the early versions of the song, likely the cover by The Snowmen, became popular in a Derby nightclub called Gossips, with the bar staff making a novelty dance; when Black Lace performed at the club in 1981, they learned the dance and recorded their own version, which was mistakenly reported as being the first version in English by BBC Radio Derby in 2006.

Black Lace's version of the song was produced by Neil Ferguson and Black Lace at Woodlands Studio under the direction of John Wagstaff and arranged by Barry Whitfield and Black Lace. Whitfield also played keyboards on the track.

Despite not being played on BBC Radio 1 because it "was not credible", the track proved to be a commercial hit. On the UK Singles Chart, "Agadoo" debuted at number 86 on 20 May 1984. The song did not enter the top 40 until the end of July, then peaking at number 38. In its fourth week in the top 40, "Agadoo" reached number 2, with George Michael's "Careless Whisper" holding it off the top spot. By early November, the song was still in the top 40, but it fell out after the first week in that month. By 13 January 1985, its last appearance in the chart, "Agadoo" had spent 35 weeks in the top 100. It was revealed to be the eighth best-selling single of 1984 around that time. Fourteen years after its original release, the song was re-recorded and re-released. It re-entered the top 100 at number 64 on 16 August 1998 but only stayed in the chart for two weeks.
