Dörtdivan is a small town deep in the countryside.

The area has been occupied for a long time. Turkish presence in the area dates back to the Oghuz Turks in 1074, but the village of Dörtdivan was founded by the Seljuk Turks in 1197. The Seljuks ruled through local lords and the name Dörtdivan, meaning four hamlets, dates from this period. The town was later absorbed into the Ottoman Empire, when it thrived as a local centre of schooling and administration.
