History
The history of 100.9 FM in Mexico City begins with Televideo, S.A., receiving a concession for XEOY-FM in 1957. However, the station didn't come to air until April 18, 1968 and became XEBS-FM, with the on-air name of "La Chica Musical". In the mid-1970s, the station became known as "Sonomil" (a name derived both from its position at 100.9 FM and from XEOY-AM 1000). This name was enshrined in the station's callsign when it became XHSON-FM in 1978.

The format moved toward rock in 1983 and 1984; the station took on the name of Proyecto 101 on September 1, 1983 and then Rock 101 on June 1, 1984. The calls changed to XHROK-FM in 1994.

In August 1996, however due to low ratings and changes within Núcleo Radio Mil, it was decided to flip formats and become "Código 100.9" with techno music, with the callsign returning to XHSON-FM.

On January 8, 1999, the Sabrosita tropical music format moved to 100.9 FM from XEPH-AM 590. The format moved back to AM on September 20, 2004, at which time 100.9 FM took on its current on October 1.
