The Municipality of Bloke (; ) is a municipality in Slovenia. Originally a municipality in its own right, it was incorporated into the Municipality of Cerknica in 1955 and it was included in the Municipality of Loška Dolina in 1995, when it split from Cerknica. It was re-established as an independent municipality in 1998.

Etymology
The Municipality of Bloke is named after the karst Bloke Plateau, over which the majority of its 45 settlements are scattered. The name Bloke was first attested in written sources in 1230 as Oblach (and as Oblukch in 1260, Oblakh in 1360, and Obloc in 1581). These early transcriptions indicate that the name was originally *Obloke, probably derived from the prepositional phrase *ob(ь) lǫky or *ob(ь) lǫkaxъ 'next to the flood-meadow(s)'. Less likely theories connect the name to the meanings 'next to rough terrain' or 'arc, arch'.
