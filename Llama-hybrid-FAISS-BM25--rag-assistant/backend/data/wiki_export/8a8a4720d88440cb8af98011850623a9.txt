The next step was to move up to Division One of the Staffordshire County League (South). They were runners-up in 1982–83, and after finishing second again the following season, the club were promoted to the Premier Division, where they finished as runners-up in 1985–86.

In 1991 Brocton joined the Staffordshire Senior League, which became the Midland League in 1994. In 2003 the club transferred to the Premier Division of the Midland Combination. After winning the Premier Division in the league's final season, they became members of the Premier Division of the new Midland League, which was formed by a merger of the Midland Combination and Midland Alliance.
