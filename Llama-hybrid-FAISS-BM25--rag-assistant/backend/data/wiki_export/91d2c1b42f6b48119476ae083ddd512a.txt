Spend an Evening with Saddle Creek is a documentary focusing on the first ten years of the Saddle Creek scene in Omaha, Nebraska. It was released in 2005 by Plexifilm. It was directed by Jason Kulbel and Rob Walters.

Interviews for the film were conducted in December 2003 and January 2004 with the active bands on the Saddle Creek roster at that time. Since the "cast" is limited to these current members, bands such as Beep Beep, Criteria, and Two Gallants do not make an appearance.
