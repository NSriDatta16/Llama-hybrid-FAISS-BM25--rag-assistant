The Central Organization of Trade Unions (COTU) is a national trade union center in Kenya. It was founded in 1965 upon the dissolution on the Kenya Federation of Labour and the African Workers' Congress. It currently closely liaises with Non Governmental Organizations of East Africa Trade Union (NGOEATU).
