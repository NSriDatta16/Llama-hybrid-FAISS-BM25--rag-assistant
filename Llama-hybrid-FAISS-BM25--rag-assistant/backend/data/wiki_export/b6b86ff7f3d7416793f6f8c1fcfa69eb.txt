Rubidium telluride is the inorganic compound with the formula Rb2Te.  It is a yellow-green powder that melts at either 775 °C or 880 °C (two different values have been reported).  It is an obscure material of minor academic interest.

Like other alkali metal chalcogenides, Rb2Te is prepared from the elements in liquid ammonia.

Rubidium telluride is used in some space-based UV detectors.

The compound has several polymorphs. At room temperature, ω-Rb2Te is a metastable antiflourite type structure, and transforms to α-Rb2Te upon heating, which is a PbCl2 type structure.
