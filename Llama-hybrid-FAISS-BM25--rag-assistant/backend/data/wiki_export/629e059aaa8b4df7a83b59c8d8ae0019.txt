Cansei de Ser Sexy is the first full-length album by Brazilian indie rock band CSS. It was released on October 9, 2005 by Trama in Brazil, where it reportedly sold 5,000 copies and failed to chart. It was released in the United States on July 11, 2006 on the Sub Pop label, and in the United Kingdom on January 22, 2007 by Sire Records. A limited edition version of the album included a CD-R. The purpose of this was that the buyer could burn a copy of the album onto the CD-R to give to someone else as a gift.

The song "Alala" and video for "Let's Make Love and Listen to Death from Above" were included preloaded on the Zune multimedia player, released in November 2006. The singles "Alala", "Off the Hook" and "Let's Make Love and Listen to Death from Above" all charted on the UK Singles Chart, with the latter of the three reaching the top 40.

Reception

The album received mainly positive reviews—it was featured on Uncuts list of the 50 best records of 2006 at number eighteen, NMEs list of the 50 best records of 2006 at number five and Qs list of the 100 best records of 2006 at number eighty-nine. The album won the 2007 PLUG Independent Music Award for Best Punk Album.
