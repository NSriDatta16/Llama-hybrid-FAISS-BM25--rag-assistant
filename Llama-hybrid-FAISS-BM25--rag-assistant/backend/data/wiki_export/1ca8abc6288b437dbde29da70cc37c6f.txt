Legal issues 
In 2015, Berkeley College was named in a New York City Consumer Agency investigation (along with 3 other for-profit schools) concerning student dropout and loan default rates, as well as how the college recruits new students.

In 2018, Berkeley College was named in a lawsuit filed by the New York Department of Consumer Affairs for deceptive and predatory practices. The lawsuit description includes (1) misleading students about financial aid, including federal financial aid; (2) tricking students into taking out loans directly from Berkeley College; (3) deceiving students about institutional grants; (4) deceiving students about transfer credits, majors, and careers; and (5) violating local debt collection laws by concealing its identity from former students when collecting debt, including debt that is not owed. Berkeley College denied the allegations contained in the DCA's lawsuit and denied that it violated the New York City Consumer Protection Law.

In 2019, Berkeley College was sued by former staffers at the White Plains (NY) campus claiming they faced "a gender-related hostile work environment" and "wrongful termination." However, plaintiffs failed to prove their case. In July 2021, the Southern District of New York granted defendants' motion for summary judgment and dismissed the lawsuit against Berkeley College and all individual defendants. Thereafter, plaintiffs appealed their loss, and, in November 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit affirmed the judgment of the SDNY.

In 2022, the NYC Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) reached a settlement with Berkeley College in connection with DCWP’s 2018 lawsuit.  The settlement requires Berkeley to, among other things, stop collection on any outstanding debt incurred before January 1, 2019, which Berkeley estimates is valued at a total of $20 million; pay $350,000 to the City, which DCWP plans to use to pay restitution to certain impacted consumers; and instruct its third-party debt collectors to request that credit reporting agencies remove all consumer account information related to student debt owed to Berkeley incurred before January 1, 2019.
