Smoky
While stationed on the Island of New Guinea, Wynne bought a Yorkshire Terrier, which he later named Smoky, from a fellow soldier for two Australian pounds.

Their adventures together ranged from flying in PBY Catalinas to assisting engineers with getting the communications operational at an airbase at Lingayen Gulf, Luzon, where Wynne had Smoky drag a telegraph wire, tied to her collar, under a runway, through a  culvert only  in diameter, reduced in places by silt. Wynne and Smoky also entertained troops and wounded. After the war, Wynne brought Smoky back to the United States.
