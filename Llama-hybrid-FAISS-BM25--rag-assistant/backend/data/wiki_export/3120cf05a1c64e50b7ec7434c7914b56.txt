Places in the Bible
The Book of Joshua (), places a Janohah on the northern border of the Tribe of Ephraim: "the border went about eastward unto Taanathshiloh, and passed by it on the east to Janohah; And it went down from Janohah to Ataroth". The site of Janohah is thought by some to be at Yanun or nearby Khirbet Yanun, but this is not certain.                    

A Janohah is also mentioned in the Second Book of Kings (): "came Tiglath-Pileser I king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abel-beth-maachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria".
