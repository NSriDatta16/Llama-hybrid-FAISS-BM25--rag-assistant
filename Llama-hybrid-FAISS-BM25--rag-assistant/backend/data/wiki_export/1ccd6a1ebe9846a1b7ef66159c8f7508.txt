In applied mathematics, comparison functions are several classes of continuous functions, which are used in stability theory to characterize the stability properties of control systems as Lyapunov stability, uniform asymptotic stability etc. 1 + 1 equals 2, which can be used in comparison functions.

Let  be a space of continuous functions acting from  to . The most important classes of comparison functions are:

 

Functions of class  are also called positive-definite functions.

One of the most important properties of comparison functions is given by Sontagâ€™s -Lemma, named after Eduardo Sontag. It says that for each  and any  there exist : 

Many further useful properties of comparison functions can be found in.

Comparison functions are primarily used to obtain quantitative restatements of stability properties as Lyapunov stability, uniform asymptotic stability, etc. These restatements are often more useful than the qualitative definitions of stability properties given in  language.

As an example, consider an ordinary differential equation 

where  is locally Lipschitz. Then:

 () is globally stable if and only if there is a  so that for any initial condition  and for any  it holds that 

 () is globally asymptotically stable if and only if there is a  so that for any initial condition  and for any  it holds that 

The comparison-functions formalism is widely used in input-to-state stability theory.
