Breakthrough Entertainment (formerly Breakthrough Films & Television) is a Canadian production company founded in 1986 by Peter Williamson and Ira Levy. It produces famous Canadian TV shows such as Jimmy Two-Shoes and Atomic Betty.

On July 10, 2018, 9 Story Media Group acquired Breakthrough Entertainment's kids and family library and development slate.

Somewhere in 2023, Breakthrough Entertainment was acquired by Shadow Pines Studios. This means that employees at the company will be shifting to new positions at Shadow Pines Studios, and that they will also manage Breakthrough's existing catalogue.
