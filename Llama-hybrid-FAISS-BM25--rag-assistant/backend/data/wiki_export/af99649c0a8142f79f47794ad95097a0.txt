Egyptian Army Stadium â€“ Suez () is an all-seated association football stadium in Suez, Egypt. The stadium was built in 2009 as one of the venues for the 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup, which was hosted by Egypt.

The stadium was known as Mubarak International Stadium until 2011 and was changed to Egyptian Army Stadium as a result of the 2011 Egyptian revolution, which removed Hosni Mubarak from being the president of Egypt.
