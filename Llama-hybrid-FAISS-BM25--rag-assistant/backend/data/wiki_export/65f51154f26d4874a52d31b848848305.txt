Musica Viva was founded in 1945 by Romanian-born violinist Richard Goldner, with the aim of bringing chamber music to Australia. The co-founder was a German-born musicologist, Walter Dullo. At its inception, Musica Viva was a string ensemble performing chamber music for small groups of European immigrants. By 2013, Musica Viva had become one of the largest chamber music presenters in the world.

Musica Viva runs a large music education program across Australia called Musica Viva in Schools.

The CEO is Anne Frankenberg. The artistic director is conductor and author Paul Kildea.

History 
Musica Viva's heritage arose from the vision of Richard Goldner, a Romanian-born violist who had trained in Vienna. Goldner arrived in Australia as a refugee in 1939 but maintained his strong connections with many of the most respected musicians in Europe.

Once asked what he expected when he arrived in Australia, his answer was simple. First, he expected to save his life. Second, he soon realized that music was not a way of life in Australia the way it was in Europe. Men generally did not attend concerts as it was considered 'sissy' – a perception that lasted until the GIs came from America.

Goldner persevered and soon after formed the Monomeeth String Quartet, which took its name from an Aboriginal Australian word for peace and harmony.

Inspired by his life in Vienna and respect for his teacher Simon Pullman, Goldner was determined to create a "Pullman-like" ensemble in Sydney. Reading in 1944 of his mentor's death in the Treblinka extermination camp in August 1942, he accelerated his plans, recruiting 17 musicians and divided them into four string quartets (and piano). The quartets were trained individually before uniting as one group, named Richard Goldner's Sydney Musica Viva. In this enterprise, he was assisted by fellow immigrant Walter Dullo, who is usually credited as Musica Viva's co-founder.

The first concert of Sydney Musica Viva was presented at Verbrugghen Hall, Sydney Conservatorium of Music on 8 December 1945. Let down by Sydney's unreliable post-war power supply, the concert took place in darkness save the headlights of several cars parked in the doorway of the auditorium and some hurricane lamps in the foyers. The program included Beethoven's Große Fuge and Dullo's string orchestra arrangement of a work for mechanical organ by Mozart.

Musica Viva in Schools
Since 1981 Musica Viva in Schools has been inspiring children to think about, actively listen to, and create music by bringing professional live music performances to primary and secondary schools all over Australia. Musica Viva In Schools provide teachers with up-to-date training and the latest digital technology so they can incorporate the live music experience into their everyday classroom teaching.

The Musician in the Classroom residency program sends professional musicians and composers to work directly with students. This could be to teach a school band, to coach a choir, to help write a school song, or just to teach music in the classroom.

Through grants and special funding, Musica Viva also creates special music projects for remote, disadvantaged and special needs schools and their students. The major program for secondary students, Live Music Packages, is a live performance and a workshop.

In 2014, The Guardian named Musica Viva in Schools' Interactive Whiteboard as one of the ten global R&D projects that were changing arts and culture.

In 2016 Musica Viva announced the inaugural artistic director of education, Michael Sollis.
