History
The town is named after a local Turkish chieftain during the Ottoman era named Karaca Bey. The former name of the town was Mihalich (), after which a cheese was named, while its ancient name was Miletopolis (Greek: Μιλητόπολις). Miletopolis was apparently the chief settlement of a group of people called the Milatæ, whose name was hellenized to suggest a Milesian colony. Its people colonized Gargara. 

Miletopolis was a suffragan of Cyzicus until the 12th or 13th century. Around the end of the twelfth century, it was united with Lopadium as an archbishopric. There are two historical mosques in Karacabey, one being from the 14th century.

From 1867 until 1922, Mihaliç was part of Hüdavendigâr vilayet.
