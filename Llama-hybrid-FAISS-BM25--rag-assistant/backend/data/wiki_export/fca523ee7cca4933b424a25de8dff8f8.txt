The Moseley School of Art () on Moseley Road, Balsall Heath, Birmingham, England was built as the first municipal branch School of Art in Birmingham.

The Moseley School of Art was closed by the City of Birmingham Education Committee in 1976. The Moseley School of Art Association was established in 2002 by former student Graeme Collins as a forum and reunion association for past students and teaching staff.

It was designed by W. H. Bidlake in 1899 and opened in 1900. It closed in 1975 and was then used by the British Association of Muslims. It stands directly opposite the Public Library and Baths. It is Grade II* listed.
