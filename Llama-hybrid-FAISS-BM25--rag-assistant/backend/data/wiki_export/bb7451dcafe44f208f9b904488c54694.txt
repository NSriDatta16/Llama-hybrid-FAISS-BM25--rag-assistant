(born June 16, 1961) is a Japanese musician and video game designer based in Tokyo, Japan. He was born in Osaka on June 16, 1961, and majored in Industrial Society at Ritsumeikan University. He has worked extensively with music production, sound design, and visuals, and has been active with the J-pop duo Psy-S. He has also been credited with popularizing the modern music video game at his studio NanaOn-Sha.

Career
On April 1983, shortly after he graduated from Ritsumeikan University, Matsuura met singer Chaka (Mami Yasunori) and founded Psy-S. The band's debut album, Different View, was released in 1985. The group's musical style is a mixture of experimental synthesizer, electric guitar, and vocals. Matsuura is the band's composer and arranger, and he performs using a Fairlight CMI synthesizer. He has also mastered the keyboard, guitar, and bass and he occasionally performs these instruments on stage as well.

In the late-80s, the group enjoyed a fair degree of popularity in Japan thanks to their several hits. Certain of their songs have been used in such anime series, including City Hunter, and in films. In 1987, he was revealed to be the composer and musical director for an OVA adaption of Atsushi Kamijo's manga, To-Y.

Technological development occurring during the 1990s generated gained interest in himself creating computer-based music and from this field, and soon transitioned into interactive music and music video games. In 1993, Matsuura became the first Japanese musician to release the Macintosh CD-ROM, The Seven Colors, for which he was awarded the "Multimedia Grand Prix". On June 1996, after having produced 10 albums with Psy-S (and four "best of" albums), he left the band and focused his attention on his multimedia projects.

The same year, he founded the Tokyo-based production company, NanaOn-Sha, and began the development of video games. After said company's Japan-only debut release of Tunin'Glue, their first major project was revealed to be a unique game—which combines hip hop rhythms with the visual talents of American illustrator Rodney Greenblat from California. Released in December 1996 in Japan, PaRappa the Rapper is regarded as one of the first modern music video games, in which it was dubbed as the first rhythm game. Matsuura's talent for combining music and gameplay would later be demonstrated with his 1999 release of the generative rhythm game Vib-Ribbon (Acquired by MoMA in 2012), and would cement his position as one of the pioneers of the music video game industry.

Together with said company in 2003, they were responsible for producing the audio portion of Sony's third-generation robotic dog toy, AIBO (model ERS-7). This included both music and sound design.

In 2004, he was given the "First Penguin" award by the International Game Developers Association (IGDA) for his innovative contributions to the video game industry.
