Having become the first all-girl group ever to score 20 consecutive Top 10 hits with their first set of releases (as part of Polydor), Girls Aloud are one of the most successful girls bands in the UK with all albums being certified platinum and having 4 number one singles.

(which reached no. 5), their 17th single, "Call the Shots", (which reached no. 3) and their 18th single, "Can't Speak French", (which reached no. 9). The girls' 5th studio album Out of Control, and 6th overall, was released via this label on 10 November 2008, and was preceded by their 19th single "The Promise", which was released on 20 October 2008. It entered at no. 1 on the UK singles charts, making it Girls Aloud's 19th consecutive top 10 hit and 4th no. 1 of their career. The second single from the album, "The Loving Kind" (co-written with the Pet Shop Boys) became their 20th consecutive top 10 hit upon its release in January 2009, and the final single, "Untouchable" was released on 27 April 2009 and became the group's first single to not reach the top ten in the UK, instead peaking at no. 11. The group got back together and released a new single, "Something New" for Children in Need which entered the charts at number 2. The group also released another greatest hits album entitled "Ten" which charted at number 9.

Sophie Ellis-Bextor
Shooting to fame as the singer of Spiller's "Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)", Sophie went on to score a string of Top 10 singles. Her multi-platinum album Read My Lips peaked straightly to the UK Top and was a success throughout many European Countries and Australia. After the release of her second album, Shoot from the Hip, Sophie took a break from music to have a baby and to marry Richard Jones from The Feeling.

Her collaboration with dance producers Freemasons on the track Heartbreak returned her to the UK top 20 in July 2009, and in May 2010, Bittersweet, the first single from Sophie's fourth album Make a Scene was released and gave her another top 30 hit, peaking at No. 26.
