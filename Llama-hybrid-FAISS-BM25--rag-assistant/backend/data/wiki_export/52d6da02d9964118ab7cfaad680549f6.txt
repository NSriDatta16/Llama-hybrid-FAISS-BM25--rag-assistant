"Somos Novios" (Spanish for "We're a couple") is a song first recorded by Mexican songwriter Armando Manzanero in 1968. Perry Como recorded an English version of "Somos Novios" with original English lyrics titled "It's Impossible", which was a top 10 hit in the US and the UK.

The song has become one of the most popular boleros of all time and it has been covered by numerous artists. The recording by Manzanero was inducted into the Latin Grammy Hall of Fame in 2001.

Background
The song was the title track of Manzanero third album Somos Novios released in July 1968. Manzanero also appeared in the 1969 Mexican film of the same title Somos Novios starring Palito Ortega, and performed the song. The song was included in the inaugural inductions for the Latin Grammy Hall of Fame established in 2001 to honor early Latin music recordings.

Perry Como version

"Somos Novios" was adapted in 1970 by Sid Wayne, who wrote original English lyrics set to the music. Sid Wayne was a collaborator with Elvis Presley, but decided to give the song instead to Perry Como. Perry Como recorded the song under the title "It's Impossible".

The Como version would be one of his most influential records, and in February 1971 it became his first song to reach the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 in more than 12 years, peaking at No. 10. The song's peak on the Hot 100 chart came just weeks after concluding a four-week run at number one on the Billboard Easy Listening chart. On the UK Singles Chart, the single reached No. 4 in 1971.

Como's version was nominated for Song of the Year at the 1971 Grammy but lost to "You've Got a Friend".
