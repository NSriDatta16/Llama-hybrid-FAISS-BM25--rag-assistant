Hugues Lebailly is a French academic and Senior Lecturer in English Cultural Studies at the Sorbonne. He is known for his work on nineteenth-century English literature, particularly his studies of Lewis Carroll which, in combination with the work of Karoline Leach and others, have begun a reassessment of Carroll's life and personality. His work on Carroll's place within what he has termed the "Victorian Child-Cult" has helped shape a new understanding of the man's sexuality and his artistry.
