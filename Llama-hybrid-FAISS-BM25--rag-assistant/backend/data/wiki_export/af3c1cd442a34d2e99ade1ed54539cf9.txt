Fox Reality Channel was an American pay television channel. It was launched on May 24, 2005, and was owned by the Fox Entertainment Group. It featured many shows that were originally on the Fox network (or produced by Fox). The channel also featured reality shows syndicated from other networks (such as ABC, CBS, NBC, The CW and MyNetworkTV), as well as many international shows from the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand.

Shutdown and replacement
In October 2009, it was announced that Fox Reality Channel would be discontinued on most providers on March 29, 2010, and re-branded as an American version of Nat Geo Wild.

On that date, the channel's old website was taken down and redirected to its archived programming on now Disney-owned Hulu, as well as Nat Geo Wild's new site. Nat Geo Wild was launched on Dish Network on April 19, 2010. DirecTV removed Fox Reality and added Nat Geo Wild on June 30, 2010, with an automated loop of Fox Reality programming remaining until those respective launch dates on those satellite providers.
