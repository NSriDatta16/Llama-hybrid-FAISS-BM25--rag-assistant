Ideas for Songs is a cassette by Destroyer, released in 1997.  The tape was a result of Dan Bejar being asked to contribute a song under the Destroyer moniker for a various artists compilation being curated at the time.  As a response he submitted a cassette with 20 songs for them to choose from.  The original 20 songs was pared down to 16 and then pressed as "Ideas For Songs" by Granted Passage Cassettes.

The cover art features the 1977 painting Imperial Nude: Paul Rosano by the artist Sylvia Sleigh.  Ideas for Songs was reissued by Triple Crown Recordings of Canada (formerly known as Granted Passage Cassettes) on vinyl on April 5, 2011. It was also made available digitally on iTunes Store.
