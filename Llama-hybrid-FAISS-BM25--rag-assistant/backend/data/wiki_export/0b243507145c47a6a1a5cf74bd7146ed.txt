NASCAR 07 is the tenth installment of the EA Sports' NASCAR video game series. It was developed by EA Tiburon and released on September 29, 2006, for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable and on November 14, 2006, for the Xbox. This was the last NASCAR edition to be released exclusively on sixth generation consoles.

The NTSC game cover features Elliott Sadler, driver of the #38 M&M's Ford Fusion. The PAL region game cover features Matt Kenseth's #17 DeWalt Power Tools Ford Fusion. This game is the first since NASCAR 2001 not to include a subtitle in the name. The game retains the teammate features introduced in NASCAR 06: Total Team Control, but does not add any major gameplay changes. However, the graphics include a blurring effect to attempt to give a better sense of high speed, and the pace of the gameplay has been sped up considerably. This is also the second EA Sports NASCAR video game to appear on a handheld system (first NASCAR 2000 for Game Boy Color). On the PlayStation Portable, the game is simply called NASCAR. This was also the only NASCAR game on the PlayStation Portable, and the last NASCAR game on the Xbox.

New features 
The game introduces Dynamic Driver Attributes and a Variable Driver Attribute System. By making certain moves while racing the player gains skill points and fills an adrenaline meter which can increase driver attributes, but other moves can decrease skill points and adrenaline. The game also introduced a RaceBreaker feature which allows players to see the holes in the track to help make their way through the pack.
