The Barton 1792 Distillery 
The distillery currently known as the Barton 1792 distillery was originally established in 1879. As of June 2018, it comprises 51 buildings – most of which are rickhouses for barrel aging.

Rickhouse collapse in 2018 

In June and July 2018 one of the 29 rickhouses at the Barton 1792 Distillery collapsed in two stages. The rickhouse had a storage capacity of about 20,000 barrels, and contained about 18,000 when the first collapse occurred, with each barrel having a capacity of . On June 22, 2018, about half of the building collapsed and caused about 9,000 barrels of spirits being aged there to fall with the structure, although about two-thirds of the barrels remained intact. The facility had a  deep basement to help contain spills, but some bourbon and brandy leaked into the nearby Withrow Creek and Beech Fork River, and about 800–1000 fish were killed. 
The building had been constructed in the 1940s, and one of the walls had been in the process of being repaired when the collapse occurred. Sazerac was given a notice of state law violation for the spill and for failure to properly notify the authorities.
About two weeks later, on July 4, 2018, the remainder of the building collapsed. No one was injured in either collapse.
