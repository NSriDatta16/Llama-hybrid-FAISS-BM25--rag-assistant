The siding was 0.53 km from Trentham Railway Station and 0.63 km from Heretaunga Railway Station. A second siding ran back to the Ministry of Works Depot, which was on the site formerly occupied by the former Central Institute of Technology campus. The dates of opening and closing of the Trentham Camp station (a temporary stopping place) are given as 11/8/1942 to 9/2/1953.
