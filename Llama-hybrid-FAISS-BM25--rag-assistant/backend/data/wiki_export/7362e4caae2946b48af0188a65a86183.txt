Fraser Clarke Heston (born February 12, 1955) is an American film director, film producer, screenwriter and actor. He is the son of actors Charlton Heston and Lydia Clarke, and has a sister, Holly Ann Heston.

As a baby, he made his film debut as the infant Moses (his father played the grown Moses) in the Cecil B. DeMille epic The Ten Commandments.

Work with his father
While in the process of writing Wind River, a romantic adventure novel about 19th-century fur trappers, Heston was convinced by producer Martin Shafer to turn the story into a film script. Discovering that film-writing came naturally for him, 22-year-old Heston wrote his first screenplay, The Mountain Men, for Columbia Pictures, which became the feature film.

Frasier Heston produced his father's TV adaptation of A Man For All Seasons (1988). He directed his father as Long John Silver in a 1990 adaptation of Treasure Island for TNT and helmed  The Crucifer of Blood starring his father as Sherlock Holmes the following year.

After directing 2nd unit work in Spain on City Slickers, Heston directed 'Needful Things (1993) and Alaska.
