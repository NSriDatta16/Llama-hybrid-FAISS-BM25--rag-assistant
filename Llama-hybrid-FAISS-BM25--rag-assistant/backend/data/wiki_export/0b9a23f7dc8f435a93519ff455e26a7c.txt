Appearances in Hong Kong films
In the 1980s and early 1990s, the international rights to many of films featuring Sorapong were obtained by the Hong Kong production companies IFD and Filmark. The films were then edited and newly-shot footage added (often featuring ninja directed by Godfrey Ho) to produce a movie more easily marketed to the Western market. In general IFD productions credit Sorapong and no other Thai actors, while Filmark's credit only the western actors, although more than two-thirds of the film is of Thai origin.

Awards and honors
Sorapong was appointed Member (Fifth Class) of the Order of the Crown of Thailand in 1981 and Companion
(Fourth Class) of the Order of the Direkgunabhorn in 2009.
