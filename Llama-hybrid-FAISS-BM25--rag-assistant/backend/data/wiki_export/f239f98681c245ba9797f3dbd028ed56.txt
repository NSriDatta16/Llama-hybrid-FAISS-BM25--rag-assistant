The Moscow City Duma () is the regional parliament (city duma) of Moscow, a federal subject and the capital city of Russia. As Moscow is one of three federal cities, the city duma's legislation can only be overridden by the mayor and the federal government.

History
The original municipal legislature was established in 1785.

In 1917, the Mossoviet was established as a parallel administration in the city following the February Revolution. After the October Revolution where the Bolsheviks seized power, it was established as the city administration and replaced the Moscow City Duma.

In 1993, following a presidential decree, the Moscow City Duma was re-established.

Composition
The Moscow City Duma consists of 45 deputies who are elected for five-year terms from single-member districts.

From 1993 to 2001, the deputies were elected by single-member districts. From 2005 to 2009, 20 deputies were elected on party lists, and 15 from single-seat districts. From 2009 to 2014, 18 deputies were elected on party lists, and 17 from single-member districts. Since 2014, all 45 deputies are elected from single-member districts.

The last election was held in 2019.
