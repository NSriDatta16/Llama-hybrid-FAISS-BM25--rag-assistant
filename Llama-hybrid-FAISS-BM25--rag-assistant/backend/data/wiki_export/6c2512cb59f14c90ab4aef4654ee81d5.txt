History

Senftenberg was first mentioned in a 1279 deed issued by Henry III the Illustrious of Wettin, then margrave of Lusatia. In 1319, the town became part of the Duchy of Jawor, the southwesternmost duchy of fragmented Piast-ruled Poland. In 1346 it passed to the Bohemia, then in 1350 to the Margraviate of Brandenburg. With Lower Lusatia, the settlement was re-acquired by the Kingdom of Bohemia under Charles IV of Luxembourg in 1368. The town was located on a trade route connecting Leipzig with Poland. Elector Frederick II of Saxony acquired Senftenberg in 1448, whereafter the area as a border stronghold of the House of Wettin was separated from Bohemian Lusatia, until in 1635 all Lusatian territories fell to Saxony by the Peace of Prague.

During the Great Northern War, in 1701, troops marched through the town towards Poland. In 1704, the defensive walls were strengthened against a possible Swedish attack. According to the 1815 Congress of Vienna, Lower Lusatia was annexed by Prussia and incorporated into the Province of Brandenburg. During World War II, the present-day district of Großkoschen (Kóšyna) was the location of a subcamp of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp, in which some 850 men, including Soviet citizens and Poles, were imprisoned. From 1952 to 1990, it was part of the Bezirk Cottbus of East Germany.
