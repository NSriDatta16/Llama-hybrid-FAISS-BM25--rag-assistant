Ahmed Nihad became the head of the exiled Imperial family in August 1944, following the death of Abdulmejid II. He was informed in writing of the decisions taken by the council during the meeting held in Prince Amr Ibrahim's home. But Şehzade Ömer Faruk did not accepted him as head of the family. On the other hand, his wife Sabiha Sultan backed the council's decision and approved the choice of leader. Only the grandchildren of Sultan Abdulaziz, Şükriye Sultan, Mihrişah Sultan, and Mehmed Abdulaziz, sided with Ömer Faruk. According to Neslişah Sultan, Ahmed Nihad was an honest, gentle, and a polite person, but he spent the whole day sitting on a chair doing nothing. Besides, he did not have the capacity to fulfill such a role. According to her, Ömer Faruk on the other hand, who had always taken care of everybody's problems in the family, saw himself
as the head of the family.

The only ornament in the room was the Turkish flag hanging on the wall. He often watched the harbor, and used to check whether a ship carrying the Turkish flag entered the port. When he saw it, he would go to the quay to watch the flag closely.
