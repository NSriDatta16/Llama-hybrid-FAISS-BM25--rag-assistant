St. Alban's College is a private, boarding, English medium and day high school for boys situated in the suburb of Lynnwood Glen in Pretoria in the Gauteng province of South Africa. It was founded in 1963 by Anton Murray. Its history, influence, wealth, and academic reputation have made it one of the most prestigious schools in South Africa.

The school was founded on 1 February 1963 with a student body of 37 boys and 3 masters. It now has 580 boys and 43 teachers plus support staff.

The founder-Headmaster, Anton Murray, was a South African cricketer, who worked for twenty years at the school. Paul Marsh was headmaster during a transitional phase lasting for four years. Ronnie Todd introduced many radical changes during his ten years as headmaster, and following his position as headmaster went on to open St Peter's College. The fourth headmaster was Grant Nupen, who was one of the 37 Foundation Scholars in 1963 and went on to become the first Head Boy, a position he held for three years.
