Refounded in 1921 under the name of Portugalete Football Club, the club ceased activities in 1936 due to the Spanish Civil War, returning in 1939 under the name of Club Deportivo Portugalete Chiqui and acting as a B-team of CD Portugalete (which was already a separated club at that time), but only remaining active for one season.

In 1944, the club was refounded as Nuevo Club Portugalete, and switched to the current name in 1956.
