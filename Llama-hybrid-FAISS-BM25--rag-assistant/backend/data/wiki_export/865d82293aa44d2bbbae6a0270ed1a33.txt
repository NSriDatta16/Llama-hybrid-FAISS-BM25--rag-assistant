Parables
Matthew 13 presents seven parables, and two explanations of his parables. The chapter contains the following parables, in respective order:

 Parable of the Sower
 Parable of the Tares
 Parable of the Mustard Seed
 Parable of the Leaven
 Parable of the Hidden Treasure
Parable of the Pearl
 Parable of Drawing in the Net

The following explanations of the first two parables are included:

 Explanation of the Parable of the Sower
 Explanation of the Parable of the Tares

Protestant theologian Heinrich Meyer identifies two groups of parables: the four first parables (up to ) "were spoken in presence of the multitude, and the other three again within the circle of the disciples". German liberal Protestant theologian David Strauss thought this chapter was "overwhelming with parables". At the beginning of the chapter, Jesus sits in a ship or a boat on the Sea of Galilee and addresses the crowd who stand on the shore or the beach. The Textus Receptus has inserted the definite article (, to ploion), suggesting that there was a boat kept waiting for him, but other texts do not include the definite article and the Pulpit Commentary therefore argues that it was "wrongly inserted".

Verses 51-52
51"Have you understood all these things?" Jesus asked.
"Yes", they replied.
52 He said to them, "Therefore every teacher of the law who has become a disciple in the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old."
These verses conclude the Parabolic Discourse and may be called a "comparative proverb". Henry Alford describes them as a "solemn conclusion to the parables. Johann Bengel suggests that Jesus would have been ready to explain the other parables if necessary, "but they understood them, if not perfectly, yet truly". The reference to scribes, or teachers of the Jewish law, who became disciples reflects the Matthean gospel focus in particular; the Jerusalem Bible suggests that this reference may portray the evangelist himself.

Verses 53-58
The final verses of this chapter see Jesus return to his home town, meaning Nazareth, where he preaches in the synagogue and experiences the rejection of his "own people", and his own country.

Dale Allison sees these verses and the following chapters as far as chapter 17 as recounting "the birth of the Church"; the Jerusalem Bible likewise holds that the same long section constitutes a narrative on the Church, followed by Matthew 18, which is often called the Discourse on the Church.
