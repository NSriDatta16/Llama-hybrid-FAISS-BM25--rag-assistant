History and notable features
Since the development of the Marcellus Shale in the Appalachian region, Southpointe has also become home to many natural gas producers, including Range Resources, Noble Energy, EQT and other service companies related to the industry.

Southpointe is also home to the PrintScape Arena at Southpointe, which was the main practice and training facility for the Pittsburgh Penguins from May 20, 1995 until 2015. From 2010-2014 its golf course (Southpointe Golf Club) hosted the  Mylan Classic, a PGA TOUR sanctioned event on the Web.com Tour (now Korn Ferry Tour).

Planning for what would become Southpointe began in the 1980s, as the Washington County Redevelopment Authority in partnership with the RIDC began to pursue a tract of land in Cecil Township that had been the site of the Western Center, a reform school and a state mental hospital.  The property for the first phase, Southpointe I, was acquired in 1986, with construction beginning in 1993.  The location was chosen because of its access to Interstate 79, its proximity to Pittsburgh and low tax rates.  By 2013, Southpointe had become filled and the second phase, Southpointe II neared completion, with  across both. A third phase is planned for the other side of Interstate 79, to be called Cool Valley Industrial Park.

It was developed by Millcraft Industries
