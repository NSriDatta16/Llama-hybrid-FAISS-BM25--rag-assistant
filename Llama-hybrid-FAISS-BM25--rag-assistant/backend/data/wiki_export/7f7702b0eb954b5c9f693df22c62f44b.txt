IV: Constitution of Treason is the fourth full-length studio album by the New Jersey heavy metal quintet God Forbid. It is a concept album telling the story of a futuristic society that destroys itself, reforms many years later, and eventually destroys itself again in the same way as originally. The band's guitarist has said that the album's basic theme is the fact that humanity in general does not seem to learn from its mistakes. Three music videos were released from this album for the tracks "The End of the World", "Chains of Humanity" and "To the Fallen Hero". There is a special edition DualDisc version of this album, with a DVD documentary about the making of IV: Constitution of Treason entitled "The Act of Treason". This is the first album to chart, peaking at number 118 on the Billboard 200 selling 8,300 copies.
