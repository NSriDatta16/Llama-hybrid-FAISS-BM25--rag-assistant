The company was nationalised in 1943, and in 1948 the voltage was increased to 1,500 V DC.

On 20 August 2016, station numbering was introduced with Tsurumi line stations being assigned station numbers between JI01 and JI10. Station numbers were also introduced to the Umi-Shibaura branch (station numbers JI51 and JI52) as well as the Ōkawa branch (station number JI61).
