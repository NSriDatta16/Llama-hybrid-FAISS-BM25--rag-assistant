History
On November 30, 1875, founder William H. Bennett, MD, opened St. Christopher's Hospital as a charitable ambulatory pediatric clinic. Over the years, the hospital added several buildings before outgrowing its quarters and in 1990, the hospital relocated to its present location on Erie Avenue and Front Street.  This facility includes an acute care hospital, a medical office building, a teaching and research center and research laboratories.

St. Christopher's Hospital for Children operates several satellite offices throughout the Greater Philadelphia region and southern New Jersey.  These include primary care offices and pediatric specialty care centers in Yardley, Pennsylvania, Northeast Philadelphia, East Falls, Pennsylvania, Reading, Pennsylvania and Washington Twp., Southern New Jersey.

The Pediatric Residency at St. Christopher's is top ranked. Each year St. Christopher's Hospital for Children receives thousands of applications to its Pediatric Residency Program from which 300 are selected to interview. From this group, St. Christopher's selects 24 PL-1 residents through the National Resident Matching Program.

After the bankruptcy of Hahnemann University Hospital, St. Christopher's Hospital for Children was sold to Drexel University and Tower Health for $50 million. The purchase happened in 2019 and included the provision that the hospital would keep its 700 employees.
