Broderick Christopher Cormier (born August 19, 1967), known as Chris Cormier, is a retired American bodybuilder who competed in the IFBB.

Biography
He was born in  Palm Springs, California. In 1984, he placed 4th in the 167 pound weight group at the California Interscholastic Federation State High School Wrestling Championships for Palm Springs High School. Cormier's first Mr. Olympia came in 1994, where he placed 6th. The same year he also participated in his first Arnold Classic and the Ironman Pro Invitational, where he placed 4th and 2nd respectively. In 1995 he competed in his first Night of Champions tournament (now called the New York Pro), where he placed 6th. Cormier has been featured in many fitness and bodybuilding magazines, including being featured on the cover of Muscular Development magazine.

In mid-2006 Cormier was hospitalized with an infected spine resulting from a bodybuilding-related injury before he was due to train with veteran English bodybuilder and ex-Mr. Olympia, Dorian Yates. His recovery included extensive physiotherapy  but the injury, and a subsequent one involving his triceps, forced his retirement.

Since then he has turned his efforts into working with athletes all over the world, sharing the knowledge and expertise he gained over his 30+ years in the sport, which included competing in over 72 IFBB competitions, with 12 professional wins and first runner-up a record 6 times at the prestigious Arnold Classic.

In 2019, a documentary film called Chris Cormier: I Am the Real Deal, about Chris' life and career will be released.
