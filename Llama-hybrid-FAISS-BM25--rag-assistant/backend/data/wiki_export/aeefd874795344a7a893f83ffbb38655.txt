Motor Toon Grand Prix 2 is a racing video game developed by Japan Studio's Polys Entertainment and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation. It was released in the US as Motor Toon Grand Prix and Japan as Motor Toon Grand Prix USA Edition, since its predecessor never left Japan, although the European version kept the original Japanese title for unknown reasons. Polys would follow up this game with Gran Turismo and form Polyphony Digital following the game's success. In 2002, the game was re-released in Europe in a Twin Pack with Gran Turismo. In 2010, the game was re-released on PlayStation Network.

The game is compatible with Namco's neGcon analogue controller.

Reception

Motor Grand Prix 2 received positive reviews, with critics generally praising the comedic power-ups and eye-catching graphics, and commenting that underneath the game's cartoonish exterior are genuinely solid racing gameplay and controls. GamePro criticized that selecting power-ups from the spinning menu can be awkward, but summarized that, "It's slick, fast, and, yes, goofy fun for real race fans." Hugh Sterbakov wrote in GameSpot that while the lack of a split screen multiplayer is a problem, the game overall "delivers for kids and kids-at-heart alike." Todd Mowatt of Electronic Gaming Monthly called it "an excellent racing game that any fan of this genre, young or old, can enjoy."

Next Generation reviewed the game, and stated that "Motor Toon is fast, gorgeous, and very different from anything else seen in the U.S. (besides gray market copies of the original Motor Toon, of course). What more could you want?"
