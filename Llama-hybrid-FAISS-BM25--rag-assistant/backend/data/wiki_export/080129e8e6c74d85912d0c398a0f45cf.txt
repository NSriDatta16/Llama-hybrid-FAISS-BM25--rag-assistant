Thomas "Pieface" Kalmaku is a fictional character, a supporting character associated with Green Lantern in comic books published by DC Comics. He was created by writer John Broome and penciler Gil Kane.

Fictional character biography
Thomas Kalmaku was introduced in Green Lantern vol. 2, #2 (Oct. 1960) as a young Inuk mechanic at Ferris Aircraft, also the employer of test pilot Hal Jordan. In the Silver Age he was referred to as Pieface; however, this has not been used for some time. As one journalist described:

In his early appearances, Kalmaku had a girlfriend named Terga. They later married, but have since separated.

Kalmaku was one of the few people who knew Jordan's secret and kept a journal of Green Lantern's adventures, which he later published as a biography of Jordan. In several stories, as a non-costumed sidekick, he either assisted the hero or required rescuing.

During the Millennium crossover, Kalmaku is revealed to be one of the "Chosen" who forms the New Guardians. He has the superpower to bring out the best in people. He resides with the team for some time on a small island. When Guy Gardner appears on a boat to take over the team, Tom tries to calm the situation, as he and the team only wish to help Guy with his obvious anger problems. The situation degenerates and Guy is forcibly removed from the island by the power of Gloss. Later, Tom leaves the team to be with his family.

The graphic novel Legacy: The Last Will and Testament of Hal Jordan focuses on Kalmaku and his immense difficulty dealing with the aftermath of Jordan's rampage and killings. In it, he goes on a final mission on Jordan's behalf, eventually reconstructing the planet Oa and the Great Battery and mending his relationship with his son, daughter, and wife.

It is later revealed that he is about to become an equal partner in Carol Ferris's aircraft company. It is also mentioned that the Guardians of the Universe once offered Kalmaku a power ring, but that he turned it down, with a simple "Naw". It had originally been revealed in Legacy that Kalmaku was Jordan's choice to be his replacement.

Kalmaku was briefly featured in the Green Lantern: Secret Origin storyline, which reworked some of the earlier parts of the Green Lantern mythos. In this new origin, Kalmaku greatly disliked being called "Pieface" by an arrogant pilot, and was defended by Jordan, who had just joined Ferris Aircraft.
