History

Origin
The presence of non-local flint and quartz fragments suggests that the area was inhabited by hunters during the middle Stone Age (5000 BC). The discovery of middle Bronze Age forts dates permanent settlement to at least 1500 BC.

The community was mentioned by name for the first time in the Actum Rotungun of 1050 AD as a place that has made donations to the bishop. In the following centuries, the name has appeared in a variety of forms. Between 1140 and 1147, Bishop Hartmann of Brixen made the town an alod and bestowed it upon his ministerialis Frederick II and his wife Gerbirg, who built a castle there.

At the start of the 19th century, Rodeneck became a municipality, administered by a mayor since 1822. In 1926, the municipality lost its autonomy and became part of the municipality of Mühlbach, and then winning back its independence in 1955 after a long struggle.
