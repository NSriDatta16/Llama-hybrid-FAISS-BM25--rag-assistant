Route 158 is an east-west arterial road running between Lachute and Berthierville, north of the Ottawa and Saint Lawrence rivers, in the Laurentides region.

It runs parallel to Autoroute 50 from Lachute to Autoroute 15 near Mirabel Airport, also passing through Joliette. A section of the 158 in Joliette is a four-lane short freeway and was intended to be part of an eastern extension of A-50 towards A-40 in Berthierville by-passing several accident-prone sections of Highway 158.

In Berthierville, it junctions with Autoroute 40 and Route 138 and ends on the island municipality of Saint-Ignace-de-Loyola at the Saint Lawrence River, which can be crossed by car ferry to Route 132 in Sorel-Tracy.
