Club career

Southampton
Flahavan began his career at Southampton, after a number of times as an unused substitute in the Premier League, Flahavan couldn't break into the first team at his hometown club, with him competing with goalkeepers such as Paul Jones, Dave Beasant and Maik Taylor. He left Saints on a free transfer in 1998, and went on to make his name with Conference side Woking.

Southend United
He was signed by Southend in October 2000. Flahavan played for Southend during two spells and in total made 356 appearances for the club helping them from league two into the championship in back to back seasons. Flahavan was seen as one of the main reasons behind the club's rise through the divisions. Flahavan put in a man of the match display against Manchester United in the League Cup on 7 November 2006, making a string of saves from Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney. Southend won the game 1–0 with a Freddy Eastwood free kick. Southend were eventually knocked out the competition in the quarter-finals to Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane 1–0 where again Flahavan produced another man of the match display.

Crystal Palace
Flahavan signed for Championship side Crystal Palace in early July 2008 on a Bosman ruling free transfer, signing a three-year contract to compete for the first team shirt with Julián Speroni. He rejected Southend's offer of a one-year deal. Flahavan made his debut in Palace's 2–1 League Cup win over Hereford United in August 2008. Flahavan also played in the next round against Leeds United, but Palace lost the game 4–0. Flahavan's only league appearance of that season came against Cardiff City and despite saving a penalty, Palace lost the game 2–1. The following season saw Flahavan remain at the club despite speculation linking him with a move away, and he made a first home league appearance for the Eagles in the 0–2 home defeat to Newcastle United, with Speroni ruled out through injury. This proved to be his last appearance for the Eagles.

Loan to Leeds United
On 26 March 2009, he joined Leeds United on loan until the end of the 2008–09 season, although due to an early injury he did not feature for Leeds United, who also had goalkeepers Casper Ankergren, David Lucas and Alan Martin already at the club.

Flahavan played in all but two of Bournemouth's 46 league games in the 2011–12 season.
