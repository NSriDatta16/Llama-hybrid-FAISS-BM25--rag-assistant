Early life 

Gurbux Singh was born at Peshawar but grew up in Rawalpindi. After the partition of India, the family first moved to Lucknow, then to Mhow and finally to Meerut from where he did his graduation. He moved to Calcutta in 1957, a city which ultimately became his permanent home and shaped his sports career. Gurbux initially tried his hand at badminton but then started playing hockey for his school in Lucknow.

Gurbux started hockey at the age of 16. He represented Agra University in 1954–55 and a year later won the Obaidullah Gold Cup Hockey Championship. Gurbux Singh first played for East Bengal Club in 1957, and was influential in their first victory at the Beighton Cup that year. He later represented Calcutta Customs Club from 1957 to 1965, followed by Mohun Bagan Athletic Club from 1968 to 1980. He had a distinguished career in domestic hockey.

International Hockey career 

A skilled full-back player, Gurbux Singh made his international debut in a tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1960, and also participated in the International Hockey Tournament in 1962.

In the 1968 Mexico City Olympics, he shared the captaincy with Prithipal Singh, where India won the bronze medal. He is considered to be one of the greatest Indian hockey players of all time.

After retiring from internationals in 1968, Gurbux Singh took to coaching and umpiring. He coached France in 1974–75 and India during the 1976 Montreal Olympics. A national selector in 1973 and again from 1980 to 1985, he was the manager of the Indian team to the 1973 World Cup and the 1983 Champions Trophy.
