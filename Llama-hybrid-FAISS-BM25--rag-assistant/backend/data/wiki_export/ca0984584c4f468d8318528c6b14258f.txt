The Association of Free Trade Unions of Slovenia () (ZSSS) is the largest national trade union center in Slovenia, with a membership of 300,000. It was formed from the remains of the old Yugoslav-era unions.

The ZSSS has control of all four of the trade union seats in the National Council of Slovenia, and is affiliated with the European Trade Union Confederation.
