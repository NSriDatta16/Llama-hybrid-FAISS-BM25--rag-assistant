The Tony Award for Best Direction of a Play has been given since 1960.  Before 1960 there was only one award for both play direction and musical direction, then in 1960 the award was split into two categories: Dramatic and Musical.  In 1976 the Dramatic category was renamed to Play.  For pre-1960 direction awards please reference Tony Award for Best Director.
