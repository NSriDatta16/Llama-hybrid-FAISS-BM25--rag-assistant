Contact is the eleventh studio album by the American vocal group The Pointer Sisters, released in 1985 by RCA Records.

History
Upon its release, Contact quickly became the Pointer Sisters' second-most successful album to date; it was certified platinum, denoting U.S. sales of over one million, and helped the trio win an American Music Award for "Favorite Video Group" in 1986. Contact yielded U.S. chart hits with the singles "Dare Me" (Hot 100 #11, UK #17), "Freedom" and "Twist My Arm." Another song, "Back in My Arms", was released as a single and video in the UK.

A track from the Contact sessions, entitled "Just a Little Closer", was released on the We Are the World charity compilation album in 1985.

Contact was remastered and issued on CD with bonus tracks in 2011 by Big Break Records.
