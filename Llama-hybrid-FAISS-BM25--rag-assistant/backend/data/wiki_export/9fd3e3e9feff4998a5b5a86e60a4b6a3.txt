Cleasby is a village and civil parish in the North Yorkshire district of North Yorkshire, England. It is close to the River Tees and Darlington and the A1(M). The population at the 2011 Census of ONS was 208.

History

The village is mentioned in the Domesday book as "Clesbi". The manor had been the possession of a local named Thor, but passed to Enisant Mussard after the Norman invasion. The mesne lordship passed to the lords of Constable Burton from Enisant which eventually ended in the hands of the Scrope family. Enisant continued to hold a demesne lordship here which passed to Harsculph an ancestor of the Cleasby family. By the early fourteenth century the direct line of inheritance had ended and the manor passed to the Fitz Hugh family of Ravensworth who held it until the middle of the sixteenth century when it passed to the Crown. In 1602 the manor was granted to Peter Bradwell and Robert Parker. From thereon it passed via the Countess of Shrewsbury to the Duke of Devonshire. By the mid-nineteenth century it had passed into the hands of John Church Backhouse.

The origin of the name of the village is uncertain. Most sources claim it to be the combination of a personal name, Kleiss and the Old Norse -by for farm, giving Kleiss' farm.
