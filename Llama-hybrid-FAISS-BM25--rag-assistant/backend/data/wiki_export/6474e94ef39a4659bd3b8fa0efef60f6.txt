Career
Nadig won her first major competition in 1970, the giant slalom at the Swiss Junior Championships. She finished sixth in the downhill at the world cup in 1971, and second in 1972. The same year, she won two Olympic gold medals, beating the favorite Annemarie Moser-Pröll and becoming the Swiss Sportswoman of the Year. She also took part in the slalom, but failed to finish.

After a few unsuccessful years, Nadig won two downhill events at the 1975 World Cup season. She competed in the slalom and giant slalom at the 1976 Olympics, but failed to achieve a podium. She recovered in 1977 by winning the downhill and the combined world cup events, and had a brilliant 1979–1980 season, finishing on the podium in all 14 world cup events, and winning 9 of them. However, at the 1980 Olympics, she earned only a bronze in the downhill and failed to finish the slalom and giant slalom.

Retirement from skiing

Between 1999 and 2005 she worked with the Swiss national teams. The 2004/05 season was the worst ever for the Swiss women ski racers since the introduction of the World Cup. After the team failed to win a medal at the 2005 World Championships, Nadig was let go in March 2005. She finally ended her coaching career in October 2005.
