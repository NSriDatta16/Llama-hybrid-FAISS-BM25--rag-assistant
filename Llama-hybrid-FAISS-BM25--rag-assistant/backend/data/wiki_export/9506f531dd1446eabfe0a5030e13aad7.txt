In July 2020, Findlay responded to allegations by former CBC producer Dexter Brown that she had used the n-word in meetings in April 2019 whilst discussing the screening of a documentary about racial issues. Ms. Findlay issued a statement that she had no recollection of using the n-word, but apologized in the event she had done so.

On April 14, 2023, Findlay stated on her Twitter account that, after more than 30 years, she would be leaving the CBC. In a letter to friends and colleagues, she wrote: "I am leaving the CBC because I have been unable to negotiate a remote work arrangement that is acceptable to me or in keeping with arrangements afforded peers." Finlay was scheduled to retire at the end of July 2023.
