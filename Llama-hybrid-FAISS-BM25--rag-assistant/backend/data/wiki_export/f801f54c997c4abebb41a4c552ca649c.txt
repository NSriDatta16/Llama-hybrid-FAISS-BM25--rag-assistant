History
The foundation of this village goes back to the middle of the 17th century and originally it was called 'Rancho de la Manteca'-Spanish for Lard Ranch. Don Juan de Zavala was given a land grant for its foundation by the governor, Don Martín de Zavala. Juan de Zavala and inhabitants from Cadereyta began the foundation
The haciendas of San Vicente, Guadalupe and San Agustín, which are all under the jurisdiction of the modern municipality of Los Herreras, were all older foundations with larger populations than Rancho de la Manteca. However, this last one was chosen as the head of the municipality for its closeness to the railroad line that went between Monterrey and Matamoros.

Rancho de la Manteca was elevated to the status of township ("Villa") by a state congressional decree on November 20, 1874 which was signed into law governor Don Ramón Treviño on December 9, 1874

At its elevation to township status, the name of the municipality was changed to Los Herreras. The most commonly accepted reason for the selection of this name is that it was to honor  the brothers Herrera  heroes of  the battle of San Bernabe during Mexico's fight for independence from Spain.
