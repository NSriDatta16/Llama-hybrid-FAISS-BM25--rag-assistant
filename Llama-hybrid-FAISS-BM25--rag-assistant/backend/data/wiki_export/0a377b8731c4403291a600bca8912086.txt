Halftime field shows
The Pride of Arizona historically fielded multiple short shows throughout each season, some having a central theme of a particular artist or style, and some made up of selections of unrelated individual songs. In 1995, director Jay Rees introduced a different format consisting of a singular long-duration primary show, performed in smaller parts throughout the season. Sometimes a short secondary show would be added late in the season.

Band Day 
University of Arizona Band Day is a full-day marching band exhibition for high school bands to perform their half-time shows and be adjudicated by professionals in the music education field. Approximately 40 high school bands perform throughout the day at Arizona Stadium on the UArizona campus, and the Pride of Arizona also appears in two exhibition performances.

Bands are rated in six professional categories under the standards set forth by the Arizona Marching Band Association: Music, Visual, Percussion, Auxiliary/Color Guard, General Effect, and Placement by Band Size (small to large is division A, AA, AAA and AAAA). Award ceremonies occur twice during the day after the PoA exhibition performance and the distinguished “Nunamaker Award” is presented to the most outstanding group(s) of the festival at the end of the day.
