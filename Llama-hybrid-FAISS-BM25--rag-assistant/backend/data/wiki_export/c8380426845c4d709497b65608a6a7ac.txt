History

The name of the town originates from the Malaya Vishera River, a tributary of the Vishera River. It was founded in 1843, as the construction of the Moscow–St. Petersburg Railway (opened in 1851) passing through the modern town started. At the time, it was a part of Krestetsky Uyezd of Novgorod Governorate. On February 24, 1918, Malovishersky Uyezd was established and Malaya Vishera became its seat. In 1921, Malaya Vishera was granted town status.

In August 1927, the uyezds were abolished and, effective October 1, 1927, Malovishersky District was established, with the administrative center in Malaya Vishera. Novgorod Governorate was abolished as well and the district became a part of Novgorod Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were abolished and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast.

During World War II, Malaya Vishera was under German occupation from 24 October 1941 until 20 November 1941.  It became the eighth Soviet town liberated by Soviet troops in 1941 and the first one among those which were not subsequently re-occupied.

On July 5, 1944, Malovishersky District was included into the newly established Novgorod Oblast and remained there ever since.
