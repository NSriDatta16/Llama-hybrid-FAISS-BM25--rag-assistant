Guðrún is one of the most frequently given female names in Iceland. In 2004, it was ranked first before Anna and Sigríður.

According to Icelandic custom, people are generally referred to by first and middle names and patronyms are used if disambiguation is required.

The name is earliest attested in a runestone as  kuþrun. In Old Norse, Goðrún was an alternative version. The Faroese equivalent is Guðrun and the mainland Scandinavian version is Gudrun. The Old Norse name is composed of the elements guð or goð, meaning "god"; and rūn, meaning "rune", "secret lore". The Scandinavian Gudrun was revived in the last half of the 19th century.
