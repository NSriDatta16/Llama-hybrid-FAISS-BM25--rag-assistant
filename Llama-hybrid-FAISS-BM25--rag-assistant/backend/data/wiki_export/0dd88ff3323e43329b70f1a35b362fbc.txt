The M58 Mine Clearing Line Charge (MICLIC) is a rocket-projected mine-clearing line charge used to provide a "close-in" demining capability for maneuver forces of the United States Army and Marine Corps. First entering service with United States Army Europe and Africa in 1988, it is effective against conventionally fuzed land mines and, when detonated, it provides a lane 8 meters by 100 meters (8.75 yards by 109 yards).

Technical specification 
The MICLIC system consists of an M353 3½ ton (3,175 kg) or M200A1 2½ ton (2,268 kg) trailer (or M200 tracked trailer) chassis, a launcher assembly, an M147 firing kit, an M58A3 line charge and a 5-inch (127mm) MK22 Mod 4 rocket. The line charge is 350 feet (107 meters) long and contains 5 pounds (2.27 kg) per linear foot of C-4 explosive. In the event a MICLIC fails to detonate normally, it can be manually activated by time-delay fuses every few feet along the length of it. The M147 Firing Kit can also be employed from other combat engineer vehicles, namely the M60 AVLB and the M1150 Assault Breacher Vehicle.

The M58 MICLIC unit cost to procure in FY2018 was approximately $83,600.

Use 
On September 15, 2022, the United States Department of Defense announced the U.S. would supply mine clearing equipment, including the M58 MICLIC, as part of a security assistance package to Ukraine during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In November 2022, the Armed Forces of Ukraine showcased a photo of their forces using the M58 MICLIC.
