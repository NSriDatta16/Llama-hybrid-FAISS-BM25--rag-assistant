Jennifer Darling (born Joan Darling; June 19, 1946, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) is an American voice, film and television actress. Her best-known role on screen was as Peggy Callahan in  The Six Million Dollar Man and its spin-off The Bionic Woman. In anime, she is the voice of Ayeka in the English dub of Tenchi Muyo for most of the English adaptions.

Early life 
Born on June 19, 1946, and a native of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Darling began taking dancing classes when she was 3 years old. She sang and danced on The Original Amateur Hour when she was 14. While she attended Carnegie Tech, she met Paul Itkin, and they married before they graduated. They have a daughter. She was born Joan Darling, but she had to change her name for professional purposes because another actress named Joan Darling had already registered that name with Actors' Equity Association.
