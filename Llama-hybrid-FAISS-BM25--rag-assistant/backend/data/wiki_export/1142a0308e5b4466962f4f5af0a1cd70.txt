Velickovic maintained a column on B92.net from 2005-2007 and was the culture editor in Serbian newsmagazine Evropa until its folding in February 2008. He has written about London culture and lifestyle on his blog City of Doom and has published essays and magazine articles on pop culture across various European media.

His first novel Gužva ('Crowd'), published in Serbian by Alexandria Press in 2003, contained a book-soundtrack CD featuring emerging electronic music artists from the Balkans.

Velickovic is also a interdisciplinary artist, interacting his writings with other media such as music, video and photography. From 2003 to 2006, he was the author of "If I were" column in Belgrade's 'Prestup' magazine, where he dealt with political provocation, enacting different social roles – the prime minister's chauffeur, a beggar, a TV news presenter, or a drag queen on the trail of a mass grave. His second novel 'Vrt Uživanja' [Garden of Pleasure] was staged as a multimedia act at international festivals in Belgrade and Zagreb.

In 2011, Velickovic founded Bturn, online culture magazine for the Balkans where he worked as Editor-in-Chief until its folding in 2014.

Velickovic performs live as a "trance blues" musician under the stage name Frank Magnolia, with a debut album "Almost There" released in 2019  and a follow-up "Night Rider" in 2021. He has performed at various clubs and venues in Serbia, Croatia, Montenegro, Slovenia, Austria, Switzerland, Germany and Italy.
