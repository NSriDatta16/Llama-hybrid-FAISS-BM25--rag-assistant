Sunil Asoka Jayasinghe (15 July 1955 â€“ 20 April 1995) was a Sri Lankan One Day International (ODI) cricketer who played two ODIs in the 1979 World Cup competition (the subsequent British Isles tour incorporated his only first-class appearances).

He was educated at Nalanda College Colombo and captained the college first XI team in 1974. For many years he represented Bloomfield CC and during the 1982/83 Lakspray Trophy compiled a monumental 283 against Colombo CC (this tournament was only recognised as first-class from 1988 to 1989).

He committed suicide aged 39.
