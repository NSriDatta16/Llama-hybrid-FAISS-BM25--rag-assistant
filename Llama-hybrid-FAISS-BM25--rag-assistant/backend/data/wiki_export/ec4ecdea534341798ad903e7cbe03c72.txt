The IX Gymnasium "Mihailo Petrović-Alas" () is a gymnasium located in New Belgrade, Serbia, established in 1961, and named after the Serbian mathematician Mihailo Petrović-Alas.

Public reputation
The school has a reputation of being very academically demanding, with high entry standards: for example, in 2005, an applicant needed a score of at least 96 out of 100 points on the Serbian High school examination to enroll in the school, the highest score of any high school in Belgrade that year.

The school has earned an excellent reputation over many decades and has been called a philosophical school since Đinđić's schooldays because of its liberal-humanistic atmosphere.

Complete reconstruction of the gymnasium was announced in 2021. Reconstruction is finished in August 2023.
