Menasseh ben Zebulun was a  hypothetical Jewish ruler of the Khazars mentioned in some extant editions of the Khazar Correspondence (but not others). In some versions he is called Moshe or Moses, but this may be a result of the degradation of the text. He probably reigned in the late ninth century CE. Little is known about his reign. As with other Bulanid rulers, it is unclear whether Menasseh was Khagan or Khagan Bek of the Khazars, although the latter is more likely.  Historical authenticity and accuracy  of the only document mentioning his name has been questioned.
