Critical reception
Indiaglitz wrote, "It's Vijayakanth all the way who with his brainy and brawny ways restores order in the society."

It summed up, "Sabari: an absolute dud." The hindu wrote "Now having said all these you can only add that Vijayakanth could have gone in for an innovative storyline, far removed from the run-of-the-mill rut".
