Doll fetishism is a sexual fetish in which an individual is attracted to dolls and doll like objects such as figurines. The attraction may include the desire for actual sexual contact with a doll, a fantasy of a sexual encounter with an animate or inanimate doll, encounters between dolls themselves, or sexual pleasure gained from thoughts of being transformed or transforming another into a doll. Doll fetishism is a form of agalmatophilia, which is itself a form of object sexuality.

As a fantasy

Though not common it can involve intercourse or other sexual activity with dolls.

Doll fetishism in games

Doll fetishism is a phenomenon that has gained attention in various forms of media, including video games like Tekken 8. In the game, female characters are portrayed as emotionless dolls, which has sparked discussions among players about the fetishization of this type of character. Some players are drawn to the robotic and seemingly perfect nature of these characters, while others find it unsettling that they lack the ability to express emotions. Regardless of individual opinions, it is important to acknowledge that fetishism can be a complex and nuanced topic that requires sensitivity and understanding. While it is ultimately up to the individual player to decide their own preferences and interpretations of these characters, it is essential to approach the topic with an open mind and respect for diverse viewpoints.
