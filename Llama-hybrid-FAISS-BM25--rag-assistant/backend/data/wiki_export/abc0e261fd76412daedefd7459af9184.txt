Snowman began playing together in various incarnations and under different names during their high school years. Joe McKee and Andy Citawarman met when they were fourteen years old; they began writing music together almost immediately. Olga Hermanniusson soon joined on Bass guitar and saxophone.  After a few line-ups and name changes, the band settled on Snowman with new drummer Ross DiBlasio joining in 2002. In 2003 they began playing live around Australia. They also recorded two demo CDs, which included early versions of "Lost in the Woods", "The Horror Song", "Moodswing" and a track that would go through many changes to eventually become "Wormwood".

In 2003, the band won The Next Big Thing competition and began recording an EP later that year. Zombies on the Airwaves of Paris was released in September 2004 and distributed by Shock Records in Australia. It garnered positive reviews nationally. National tours with Interpol, Regurgitator, The Mint Chicks and Wolfmother soon followed, as well as a publishing deal with Mushroom Music Publishing.
