"Good People" is a protest song written and performed by Jack Johnson. It is the fourth track on the album In Between Dreams and was released as a single on May 9, 2005. Though the song has a positive and relaxing sound, it is a critic of contemporary television, especially with regard to frequent violence, and its effect on society. The song is similar to the song "Cookie Jar" from Johnson's previous album On and On, which also draws attention to the issue, but with a more explicit protest and melancholic sound.
