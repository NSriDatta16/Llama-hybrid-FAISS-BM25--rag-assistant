Brekke is a former municipality in the old Sogn og Fjordane county, Norway.  The municipality has existed two separate times: from 1850 until 1861 and then again from 1905 until its dissolution in 1964. It was located in the northeastern part of the present-day Gulen Municipality in Vestland county.  The municipality encompassed about  south of the Sognefjorden, centered on the Risnesfjorden arm that reaches to the south from the main fjord. The administrative center of the municipality  was the village of Brekke, located on the southern shore of the Sognefjord, about a  drive from the village of Eivindvik. The main church for the municipality was Brekke Church.

History
The parish of Brekke was originally established as a municipality in 1850 when it was split off from the municipality of Evindvig. Initially, Brekke had a population of 898.  In 1861, Brekke (population: 898) was merged with neighboring municipality of Lavik (population: 926) to form the new municipality of Lavik og Brekke. On 1 January 1875, a part of Klævold municipality with 90 inhabitants was moved to Lavik og Brekke.

On 1 January 1905, the municipality of Lavik og Brekke was split (back) into two parts, Lavik (population: 1,182) and Brekke (population: 982). During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, Brekke municipality ceased to exist when it was merged with Gulen, the neighboring municipality to the west, forming a new, larger municipality of Gulen. Before the merger, Brekke had a population of 782.

Name
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old Brekke farm () since the first Brekke Church was built there. The name is identical to the word  which means "slope". Historically, the spelling of the name was not formalized until the 1800s, so spellings such as Breche, Bræcke, and Brække were also used.

Government
During its existence, this municipality was governed by a municipal council of directly elected representatives. The mayor was indirectly elected by a vote of the municipal council.
