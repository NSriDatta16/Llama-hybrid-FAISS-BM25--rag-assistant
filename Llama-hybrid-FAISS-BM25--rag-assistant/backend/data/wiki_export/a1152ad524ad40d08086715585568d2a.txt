The 2007 World Aquatics Championships, or the XII FINA World Championships, were held in Melbourne, Australia from 17 March to 1 April 2007. The competition took place at three locations in central Melbourne: the Melbourne Sports and Aquatic Centre (diving and water polo), St Kilda Beach (open water), and Rod Laver Arena in a temporary pool christened the Susie O'Neill Pool (synchro and swimming).

A total of 2,158 athletes from 167 nations participated in the 2007 championships. The total number of spectators was more than 215,000, setting a new record attendance for the event. FINA President Mustapha Larfaoui described the competition as "the biggest and best in history."

Medals table 

At the end of the competition, the medals table contained an entry for Tunisia, with one gold and one silver medal, both won by Oussama Mellouli. However, on 11 September 2007, the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, Switzerland vacated these results imposing an 18-month competition ban on Mellouli, effective retroactively to 30 October 2006 for doping with amphetamine.
