History 

Opened by the Caledonian and Dunbartonshire Junction Railway on 15 July 1850, it became part of a joint London, Midland and Scottish Railway and London and North Eastern Railway line during the Grouping of 1923. The line then passed on to the Scottish Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948.  The line through the station was double until 1973, but now only one track and platform are in use.

In 2018, it was reported locally that new signage, showing the way to the Vale of Leven Hospital, had been installed at the station and at Balloch.

Although the ticket office entrance from the car park is not step-free, there is step-free access to the platform (and from the platform to the ticket office).
