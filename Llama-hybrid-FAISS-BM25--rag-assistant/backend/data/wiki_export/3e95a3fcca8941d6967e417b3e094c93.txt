It was built in 1916. The venue was an open air arena that is said to be among the first to utilize artificial ice and had a capacity variously reported to be 2,300-4,000. The arena was located at the corner of North Elm Street and West Maxwell Drive across the street from Cannon Park in Spokane's West Central neighborhood and The Spokesman-Review roughly estimated the arenas' record attendance figure at about 1,500 for the second home game of the Spokane Canaries.
