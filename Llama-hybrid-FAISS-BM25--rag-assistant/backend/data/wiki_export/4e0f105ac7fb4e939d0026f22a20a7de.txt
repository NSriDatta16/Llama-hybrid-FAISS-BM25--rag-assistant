Rovos Air was a charter airline headquartered in Randpark Ridge, South Africa based at Wonderboom Airport.

History

The company operated tourist traffic between Pretoria and Victoria Falls offering passengers a nostalgic flight in classic aircraft that were fully refurbished and fitted with luxury seats to match the saloon wagon in their train. 

In 2009, Rovos Air was sold to TIM Holdings (PTY) LTD. Rovos Air, trading as Gryphon Airlines, then operating MD-83 and DC-9 aircraft providing charter flights in Africa, the Middle East and South Central Asia. It shut down operations in 2014.
