Arrow Comics was one of the original independent publishers of black-and-white comics in the mid-1980s, the first truly creator-owned comic companies, started in Ypsilanti, Michigan, by founders Ralph Griffith (24 April 1960–11 December 2020) and Stuart Kerr.

History

Origins 
Griffith and Kerr were just getting ready to publish a local comic fanzine called Fantastic Fanzine (a name which they later discovered had already been used in the seventies by Fantagraphics founder Gary Groth), when the first issue of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles came out. Spurred on by the success of this fairly low production level book, Griffith and Kerr set about to gather their own 'bullpen' of local comic creators and start a comic company, using Fantastic Fanzine as a springboard. With their motto "Our Target is Entertainment; Our Aim is Quality", they intended to bring to the black-and-white comic book market their idea of quality work, in comparison to what they thought was sub-par work intended only as a source of revenue for the larger publishers. Fantastic Fanzine ran thirteen issues in its first volume, during which time Griffith and Kerr discovered local Michigan artists Randy Zimmerman, Guy Davis, Vincent Locke, Susan Van Camp, Mark Bloodworth, and Tim Dzon. 

In December 1985, Tales From The Aniverse by Zimmerman and Van Camp was published, followed shortly thereafter by The Realm, Deadworld, and Nightstreets. Other titles included Legend Lore: Tales from the Realm and System 7, but it was not long before Arrow found itself caught up in the infamous "black and white bust", and the revenues from their highest-selling titles were held up in the bankruptcy hearings of several major comic book distributors of the day. In 1989, in order to salvage their legacy, Griffith and Kerr agreed to the move of their most popular titles, The Realm and Deadworld, to Caliber Comics.

1993 revival 
After publishing three issue of Fantastic Fanzine volume two throughout 1992, Griffith and Kerr announced the return of Arrow Comics in a single issue of Fantastic Fanzine volume four in December 1992, this time explicitly under the Arrow Comics banner. In January 1993 they released the first issue of The Dead, a horror title written by Griffith and Kerr themselves and penciled by Jason Moore (later of Evil Ernie inking fame), that pushed the envelope on gore even farther than their earlier Deadworld. Despite the first issue being labelled "For Mature Audiences Only", the violence and nudity made retailers reluctant to carry it, and only one additional issue was published (featuring the banner "Banned in Canada and the U.K.!!!") before Griffiths  and Kerr moved to Caliber Comics to write Oz (1994–1997).

1998 revival 
After the release of Shock and Spank: The Monkeyboys by Creative Force Designs in 1996, a far more significant revival began with the first of four issues of Arrow Anthology by Arrow Comics Group in 1997, followed in 1998 by a variety of titles continuing the Oz series from Caliber Comics: Dark Oz, Land of Oz, Wogglebug, Wonderland, and Bill Bryan's Oz Collection. Also beginning in 1998 were a second volume of The Dead, The War of the Worlds: The Memphis Front, Arrow Spotlight, August, and Korvus v2 (continued from Human Monster Press). A sub-imprint named "Arrow Manga" began in 1999 and included Descendants of Toshin, Miss Chevious: The Armageddon Project, Semantic Lace, and Butterly Gunn (originally solicited as Happy the Clown Manga Special). In 2002, "Arrow Books" released the trade paperbacks The War of the Worlds: Haven and the Hellweed, which collected the 1996 Caliber Comics The War of the Worlds series written by Zimmerman, and then Zimm's Heroic Tales, a superhero anthology.

2008 revival 
With strong support from Internet readers, the most recent incarnation of Arrow Comics has been spearheaded by Randy Zimmerman and Scott R. Moore, publishing the webcomics Spank the Monkey and Rebel Nun (both by Zimmerman).

2021 Revival 
Randy Zimmerman has once again restarted Arrow Comics, due to a retail deal that never existed) and, along with a number of other Indie creators, returned to publishing comics for the direct and crowdfunding market. Initially began as Arrow Comics 4.0 the number designation was dropped in January 2023 and the brand continues on as Arrow Comics. A new "sub-brand was begun in February 2023 entitled "Arrow Comicsw 3-G" to designate their adult content titles from their more family friendly works. AR-13L is the first title to carry the "3-G" designation.
