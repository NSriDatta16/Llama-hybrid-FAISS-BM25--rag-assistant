History 
The area of the Baltimore National Cemetery was once part of an elevated site in Baltimore, referred to as early as 1750 as the Cloud-Capped estate. It was originally owned by the Baltimore Company and Charles Carroll of Carrollton.  In 1890 it was acquired by Blanchard and Susan Randall. When the nearby Loudon Park National Cemetery was deemed full, the War Department surveyed the area for a new site. In 1936 the federal government took possession of the land for a cost of $95,000, and began converting the estate to "Little Arlington". The old mansion was demolished, fences were put up, roads were constructed, and landscaping was done as part of a Works Progress Administration to invest in infrastructure during the Great Depression. The first interment took place on December 22, 1936, but the cemetery was not formally dedicated until May 30, 1941. In 2019, The Durable Restoration Company provided restoration of the exterior Tudor style stone facade and slate roof.

Notable monuments 
The memorial area of the cemetery has monuments representing each of the six United States Marine Corps divisions from World War II.
