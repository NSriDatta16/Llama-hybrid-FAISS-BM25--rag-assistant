Antonio Maurice Lang (born May 15, 1972) is an American former professional basketball player who currently serves as an assistant coach for the Atlanta Hawks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball at Duke, where he won back-to-back NCAA tournaments in 1991 and 1992.

High School and College career
Born in Columbia, South Carolina and raised in Mobile, Alabama, Lang graduated as valedictorian from LeFlore Magnet High School in 1990. The year before, he helped the school win a state championship in basketball. Lang had a productive collegiate basketball career, as he was a member of a Duke team that won two championships in three Final Four appearances.

Professional career
Lang was selected by the Phoenix Suns in the second round (29th overall) in the 1994 NBA draft; however, he saw limited action during his rookie year due to a knee injury. He was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers in 1995 along with Dan Majerle. Lang also had stints with the Toronto Raptors, Philadelphia 76ers, and Miami Heat. In addition, Lang played in the Continental Basketball Association (with the Fort Wayne Fury and Grand Rapids Hoops), where he was selected to the All-CBA Second Team in 1998. He played in the Philippine Basketball Association, with the Red Bull Thunder.

Lang began playing in 2001 for the Mitsubishi Melco Dolphins (now the Mitsubishi Diamond Dolphins) of the Japan Basketball League. Foot problems, though, prompted Lang to retire from playing basketball in 2006.

Coaching career
Lang became an assistant coach for the Dolphins following his retirement. On May 19, 2010, Lang was named as the Dolphins' head coach.

Lang was hired as an assistant coach for the Utah Jazz in June 2014. He joined the staff of Quin Snyder, who is also a former Duke basketball player. On June 19, 2019, Lang was hired as assistant coach for the Cleveland Cavaliers. On June 14, 2023, Lang was hired by the Atlanta Hawks as an assistant coach.
