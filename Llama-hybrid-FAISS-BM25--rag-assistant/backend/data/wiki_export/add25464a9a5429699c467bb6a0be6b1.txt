Consuming Passions is a 1988 black comedy film which stars Vanessa Redgrave, Jonathan Pryce, and Sammi Davis and was directed by Giles Foster.  The film is based on Secrets by Michael Palin and Terry Jones, a BBC television play broadcast in 1973. 

In the film, a chocolate factory accidentally released a new luxury product which contained human flesh. When the product turns into a surprise sales hit, the factory's owners decide to market their products to cannibals and to keep acquiring human corpses as key ingredients.

Synopsis
The film  tells the story of a chocolate factory preparing to launch a new luxury range, Passionelles. However, during the production run a worker falls into a vat of chocolate and dies, meaning human flesh is present in the first batch released. 

The horrified owners try and fail to recall the chocolates, but when they go on sale, they prove a surprise hit. Keen to continue the success, the developers try to replicate the taste with animal meat, but this fails miserably - leading them to realise human flesh is the key ingredient, and going to extreme lengths to obtain dead bodies to use in the chocolate.
