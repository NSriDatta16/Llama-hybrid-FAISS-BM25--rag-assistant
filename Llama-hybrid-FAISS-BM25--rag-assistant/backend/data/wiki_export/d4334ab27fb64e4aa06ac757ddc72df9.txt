Oceanside High School (California) is an American public secondary school located in Oceanside, California. It is part of the Oceanside Unified School District.

History and Campus
Oceanside High School is one of two high schools in the Oceanside Unified School District serving Oceanside, CA.  Founded in 1906, OHS originally was located on the second floor of a one-room schoolhouse located at the site of the present campus.  The school primarily serves Oceanside's beach communities and rests less than one mile from the beach.  Throughout much of the first half of the 1900s the campus served as the High School for the majority of the North San Diego County region - its territory spanned as far south as Encinitas and east to Vista. In 1934, the school opened a junior college division, which operated on the eastern side of campus and existed until the 1970s when Mira Costa College opened its own campus.

The current school grounds occupy approximately 32 acres in downtown Oceanside. The oldest building still in use on the campus is known as Senior Hall. OHS has experienced recent renovations due to the $125 million bond measure passed by Oceanside residents in 2000 that provided funding to the city's schools. The remodeled campus includes new landscaping, new athletic fields, and a new three-story Science & Technology building. A new performing arts center had its grand opening on September 30, 2017. Renovations to other existing buildings such as Senior Hall and the library were also included as part of the bond initiative.
