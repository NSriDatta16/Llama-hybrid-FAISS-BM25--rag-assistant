Wonjong of Goryeo (5 April 1219 – 23 July 1274) was the 24th ruler of the Goryeo dynasty of Korea from 1260 to 1274.

Biography

He ascended the throne with the help of Kublai Khan. During his reign, Goryeo became a vassal of the Mongol-founded Yuan dynasty in China.

In 1269, the military leader Im Yon engineered a coup d'état to remove Wonjong. Kublai Khan dispatched 3,000 troops to oust the forces of the rebel. Wonjong visited the imperial court in 1271 after his re-accession.

Wonjong was the eldest son of the previous king, Gojong.
