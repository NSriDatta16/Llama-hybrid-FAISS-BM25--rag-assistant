The National Citizen Will Party (, PNVC), formerly known as the National Civic Veterans Party, is a minor Christian-democratic and social-conservative political party in the Dominican Republic. It was founded on 10 May 1973 by Sergeant Federico Marte Pichardo, under the initiative of then-President Joaquin Balaguer, and was renamed on 8 March 2015. It is currently directed by Juan Cohen.

The party first contested national elections in 1982 when it won 1.6% of the vote, but failed to win a seat. For the 1986 and 1990 elections it was part of the victorious Social Christian Reformist Party-led coalition. For the 1994 elections it changed its allegiance to the Dominican Revolutionary Party-led coalition that won the Congressional elections but lost the presidential vote. It contested the 2002 elections alone, but failed to win a seat after receiving only 0.5% of the vote. For the 2006 elections it was part of the defeated Grand National Alliance.
