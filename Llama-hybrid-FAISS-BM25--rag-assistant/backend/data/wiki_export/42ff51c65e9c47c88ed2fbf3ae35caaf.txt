Southwest China Normal University
Southwest China Normal University was one of the key comprehensive universities under the administration of the Chinese Ministry of Education. Originally it was created as the Southwest Teachers College. The college was the result of several mergers of the former National Women's Teachers College and the Sichuan Provincial Educational College in 1950. It was then established as Southwest China Normal University in 1985.

Southwest Agricultural University
Southwest Agricultural University was created in 1950, as the Southwest Agricultural College. The college was the end result of several institutions which were Sichuan Provincial Educational College, the Western China University and Xianghui College.

In 1979, it was authorized by the State Council to be one of the national key universities. It was restructured as Southwest Agricultural College. In 1958, the college was upgraded as Southwest Agricultural University.

In 2001, Sichuan Animal Husbandry and Veterinary College and the Citrus Research Institute of Chinese Academy of Agriculture were absorbed into Southwest Agricultural University. This marked the beginning of a new Southwest Agricultural University which specializes from teaching, pedagogy, psychology, agronomy and agriculture.

Prior to the merger, Southwest China Normal University and Southwest Agricultural University were neighbors with only a wall separating the two universities. Both universities had a long historical relationship, which could be located back to their common origin, West China Union University, founded in 1906.

Academics

Scientific Misconduct
Qian Zhang, a researcher at Southwest University, was accused of having recycled tables, impossible statistics, and unrealistic properties in the raw data of the scientific papers. 
Some papers were corrected by adding constant values to make statistics possible, however, none of the other summary or inferential statistics had to be changed in these corrigenda, as one might expect if there was an error in analysis.
For other papers, Dr. Zhang refused to provide raw data after being accused, allegedly to hide the academic misconduct. 
Dr. Zhang was reported to the university. The official response explained that Dr. Zhang was just very bad at statistics and would be receiving remedial training and writing some corrigenda. However, the letter did not comment on the strongest pieces of evidence for misconduct: the recycled tables, the impossible statistics, and the unrealistic properties of the raw data.

Faculty and Student
Southwest University employs 2,650 full-time teachers, and 300 professional researchers, 349 professors (research fellows), and 739 associate professors (associate research fellows, 113 PhD supervisors, and 513 Master's degree tutors.

Southwest University has over 50,000 students.
