Suhum, Sūḫu, or Suhi was an ancient geographic region around the middle course of the Euphrates River, south of Mari (modern-day Tell Hariri, Syria).

History
Its known history covers the period from the Middle Bronze Age (c. 2000-1700/1600 BCE) to the Iron Age (c. 1200–700 BCE).

Middle Bronze
During the Bronze Age, Suhum was divided into an Upper Suhum, with its capital in Hanat, and a Lower Suhum with its capital in Jabliji. Several ancient letters place the Sutean people as having lived in the region of Suhum.

Iron Age

Neo-Babylonian period
In 616 BCE, Suhum subordinated themselves to the king of Babylon, Nabopolassar (ruled 626-605 BCE). Three years later, in 613 BCE, Suhum rebelled against him, which led Nabopolassar to send an expedition against Suhum.
