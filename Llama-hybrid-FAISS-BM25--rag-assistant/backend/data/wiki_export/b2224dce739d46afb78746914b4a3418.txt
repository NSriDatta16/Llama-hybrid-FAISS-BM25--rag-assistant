Donavon Frankenreiter is an eponymously titled debut album, released in the United States on May 11, 2004 (see 2004 in music). Produced by longtime friend Jack Johnson and regular Johnson collaborator Mario Caldato, Jr, the album sold modestly in the United States, peaking at number 7 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers and 169 on the Billboard 200. The album performed relatively better in Australia, where Frankenreiter was already well known through regular support gigs with Johnson; also he embarked on an extensive tour of small venues to promote the album. The album reached the top forty of the ARIA albums chart and received gold accreditation (sales in excess of 35,000 units) in 2005.
