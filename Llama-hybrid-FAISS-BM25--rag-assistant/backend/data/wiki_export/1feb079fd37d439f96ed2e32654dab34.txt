Butternut Square was a Canadian children's television series which aired on CBC Television between October 19, 1964 and February 10, 1967. The cast featured Ernie Coombs as Mr. Dressup, whose own landmark television series began production  after Butternut Square's run had ended. The show was broadcast in black and white, and originally was 20 minutes until the third (final) season, when it was expanded to a full 30 minutes.

Following Butternut Square's cancellation, Mr. Dressup would get his own series, in the fall of 1967. Two puppets from Butternut Square, Casey and Finnegan, would also join him on that new series, which would run until 1996.
