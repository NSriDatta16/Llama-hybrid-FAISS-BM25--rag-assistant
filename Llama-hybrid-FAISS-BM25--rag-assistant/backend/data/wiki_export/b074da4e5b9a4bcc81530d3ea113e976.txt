Alexandr Fedorov () (born 6 May 1978) is an IFBB professional bodybuilder.

Fedorov earned his IFBB Pro Card after winning the 2003 IFBB European Amateur Championships. After competing in various Russian and other European professional bodybuilding competitions in 2003 and 2004 where he earned two top 3 finishes, including runner up to Ronnie Coleman at the 2004 Grand Prix Russia, Alexander qualified for the 2005 Mr. Olympia, where he did not place.  He also competed in the 2006 New York Pro, but did not place either.

During this time Fedorov was dealing with a torn pectoral muscle â€“ an injury from September 2003 which would eventually force him to temporarily retire from bodybuilding.

Since 2014 Alexander is back to professional bodybuilding and is actively training now.

Alexander currently resides in Russia with his wife Natalia, his daughter Veronica and his two young baby-twins.
