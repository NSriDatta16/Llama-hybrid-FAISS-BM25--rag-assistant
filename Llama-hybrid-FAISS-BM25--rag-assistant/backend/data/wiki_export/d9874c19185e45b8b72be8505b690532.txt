History
According to ARIJ, Israel confiscated 332 dunams of land from the nearby Arab village of Bruqin in order to construct Brukhin.

Brukhin was founded in 1998 on non-private land claimed as state land by Israel as a trailer neighbourhood, and developed by one of the founding members, Amishai Shav-Tal, in October 2000, within the territory administered as part of its municipality by the Shomron Regional Council. The Sasson Report established that the Brukhin outpost was an unauthorized Israeli settlement. The report also said that $785,000 was spent on Brukhin's infrastructure and public buildings. Construction in the village was frozen in 2012 by an order from the Israeli High Court. In 2012 the Israeli state provided the illegal outpost with official authorization.

Popular culture
In July 2015 a "come and join" video was released on YouTube featuring a song sung by the families of Brukhin.
