Lee Tabor Sholem (May 25, 1913 in Paris, Illinois, â€“ August 19, 2000 in Los Angeles, California) was an American television and film director.

Nicknamed ""Roll 'Em" Sholem", he is identified more than anyone else in the industry with speed and efficiency. He directed more than 1300 productions, including both feature films and TV episodes, without ever going over schedule. His achievements over a 40-year career have, as yet, been unsurpassed in Hollywood history.

Sholem's first film was Tarzan's Magic Fountain in 1949 and his last film was Doomsday Machine in 1972.
