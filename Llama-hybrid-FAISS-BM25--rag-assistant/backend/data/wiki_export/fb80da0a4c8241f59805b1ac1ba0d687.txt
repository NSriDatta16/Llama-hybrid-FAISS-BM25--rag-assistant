The UST Growling Tigers are the college athletic teams representing the University of Santo Tomas in the University Athletic Association of the Philippines. They hold the most UAAP Overall Championships with 45 Seniors' Overall Championships (out of 74 seasons) and 21 Juniors' Overall Championships (out of 26 seasons).

UST is one of four member universities that participate in all 15 sporting events of the league. They also take part in various sports leagues such as the Filoil Flying V Preseason Cup, the Premier Volleyball League and the UNIGAMES.

Team identity

Mascot and colors

The gold and white colors of the flag of Vatican City were adopted by the University of Santo Tomas for their school colors because of its Pontifical status.

They were known as the Glowing Goldies until a name change in 1992. UST Rector Fr. Rolando V. de la Rosa, who was appointed in 1991 recalled in a speech to the school's administrators and faculty members during his 2007 Rector's Report on how UST's present Growling Tigers moniker came to be.

It was during the parade of school mascots in the opening ceremonies of Season 54 (1991–92) when an embarrassing incident occurred. Unlike the other member schools, UST had no mascot to represent their varsity teams and it gave the host school a hard time in coming up with a suitable representation for the Glowing Goldies. A “fat Dominican friar” who was carrying bags of gold had come out with the other mascots and drew a lot of laughter from the crowd in attendance.

Fr. De la Rosa later instructed PE moderator Bro. Rolando Atienza to conduct a naming activity for a new mascot. Mrs. Felicitas Francisco, directress of the PE department, suggested the tiger as the new mascot due to its gold and white colors.

When it was UST's turn to be host in Season 55 (1992–93), the new growling tiger mascot debuted in the opening ceremonies. Since then, Mrs. Francisco always donned her tiger-striped coat when she attends UST playoff games. The High School boys' team followed suit by changing their name from the "Golden Nuggets" to the "Tiger Cubs".

The Manila Central University Purple Owls once used the tiger mascot (with purple and gold colors) when they participated in the UAAP from 1952 until their pullout in 1962.

Basketball 

The UST men's and boys' basketball teams were first formed in the year of the NCAA's foundation in 1924. UST won their first and only NCAA men's championship in 1930.

In the UAAP, they have the most combined championships with 40 from the men's, women's and boys' teams. The men's total of 18 titles is tied with the UE Red Warriors' for the second most championships behind FEU's 20.

In 1993 the Growling Tigers finished the double-round eliminations with a rare 14–0 sweep and were declared automatic champions of the UAAP Season 56 men's tournament. This was the start of the Growling Tigers' four-peat championship run in the UAAP. The Tigers faced and defeated the De La Salle Green Archers for three consecutive finals series.

UST's last championship before the sweep was in 1967 when they were declared co-champions with UE in Season 30.

The Tiger Cubs and the Tigresses also have successful basketball programs with each team having a total of 11 UAAP championships.

In 1994, the men's, women's and juniors' teams won the UAAP Season 57 basketball championship in their respective divisions. This was the only time that a triple championship was achieved in the UAAP. UST also won double championships in Seasons 58 and 69 with the Growling Tigers and the Tigresses winning both their division titles in both years.

UST's off-season training includes participation in summer basketball tournaments. The Tiger Cubs regularly join the MILCU Summer Showcase, Smart City HOOPS, Filoil Flying V Preseason Cup juniors tournament and the PCABL Freego Cup. The Tigresses recently played in the Fr. Martin Cup Summer tournament and Breakdown Basketball Invitational tournament, while the Growling Tigers continue to participate in the MILCU Under-25 tournaments, the PBA D-League, Filoil Flying V Preseason Cup, Breakdown Basketball Invitational, Fr. Martin Cup Summer tournament, the Millennium Open Basketball championship, as well as pocket tournaments in the provinces such as the Kim Lope Asis Invitational Basketball Tournament in Bayugan, the Kadayawan Basketball Invitational in Davao City, and the Republica Cup collegiate tournament in Malolos. They have also competed in the Philippine Collegiate Champions League, an annual postseason tournament for schools that topped their respective leagues.

The UST Tigress Cubs girls' basketball team were declared co-champions with Adamson in Season 82's inaugural exhibition tournament after the deciding Game three of their finals series was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Tigresses finished second in the four-team eliminations with 4 wins and 2 losses behind the Lady Falcons' perfect 6–0 record.

Football 

The formation of UST's football team dates back to the early days of the NCAA. The Golden Booters have a combined total of 35 NCAA and UAAP championships. They won four straight NCAA titles from 1926 until 1929. The men's team who were sparringly called the Growling Booters and the Tiger Booters achieved a three-peat in the UAAP from 1991 to 1993. They last won the championship in 2006.

The Golden Booters made it back to the finals and ended up as runners-up to the undefeated UP Maroon Booters in Season 80. Before Season 77, UST had only missed the playoffs once in a span of 13 years.

The UST Lady Booters won their first UAAP title in 2009, 14 years after women's football became an official sport in the league. They won the championship again in 2011.

The Juniors team that plays in a small pool of four teams (the number of competing schools increased to five with the entry of Nazareth School in Season 80) have yet to get a podium finish since boys' football became a regular sport in UAAP Season 72.

UST's off-season training includes participation in the UNIGAMES, Ang Liga, the PFF Women's League, the Pinas Cup, and the Metro Manila Girls Football Association.
