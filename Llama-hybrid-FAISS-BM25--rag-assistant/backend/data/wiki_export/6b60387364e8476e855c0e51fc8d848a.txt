Hospital Nacional () is a private hospital in Panama City, Panama. It is located at Avenida Cuba and 38th Street in Bella Vista.

History
Clinica Nacional (National Clinic), a small 10-bed facility with one operating room, one delivery room, and a small newborn unit, opened on 9 July 1973 at Justo Arosemena Avenue and 38th Street in Panama City, Panama.
It exclusively provided 
OB/GYN services and became known as "Clinica de la Mujer" (The Women's Clinic). To accommodate its growth to 25 beds, it moved to a larger location across the street in January 1980

In September 1994, Centro MÃ©dico Nacional (National Medical Center) opened, housing 110 specialists.

By that time, the smaller clinic's fame made further expansion feasible. On 20 August 1998, a new building was inaugurated on Avenida Cuba, between 38th and 39th Streets in Panama City, where the clinic was renamed Hospital Nacional.
