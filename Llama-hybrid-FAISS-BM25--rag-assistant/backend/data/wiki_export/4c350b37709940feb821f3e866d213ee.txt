History
Wakasennin Station opened on November 18, 1921 as a station on the now-defunct Yokoguro Line. With the construction of Yuda Dam in late 1962, the line was re-routed to become part of the Kitakami Line. The station was absorbed into the JR East network upon the privatization of the Japan National Railways (JNR) on April 1, 1987. A new station building was completed in 1999.
