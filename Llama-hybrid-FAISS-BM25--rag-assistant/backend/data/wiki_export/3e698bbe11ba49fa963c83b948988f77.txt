Emerging is the title of the only album by the Phil Keaggy Band, released in 1977 on NewSong Records. The album's release was delayed due to a shift in record pressing plant priorities following the death of Elvis Presley. The album was re-released on CD in 2000 as ReEmerging with one original track omitted and four newly recorded songs by the band members.
