Sometimes Podgorica Airport is referred as to Golubovci Airport by locals, the airport being just 5 km away from the town.

Golubovci is located next to the M-2, Podgorica - Bar road (E65/E80), main Montenegrin road connection between the coast and northern part of the country. Part of this road went through the centre of Golubovci causing frequent traffic jams during the summer tourist season which led to construction of 4-lane dual carriageway, the Golubovci Bypass, in 2018.

Sports
The town is home to FK Zeta, one of the most successful Montenegrin football clubs in recent years. They play their home games at the Stadion Trešnjica. The town's basketball team is KK Zeta 2011.
