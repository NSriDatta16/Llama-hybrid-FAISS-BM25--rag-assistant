Controversy
The Islamic Society of San Francisco (ISSF) was the subject of a wrongful termination lawsuit by Safwat Morsy, an imam he had hired for his mosque but later fired for preaching radical ideology.  Morsy maintained that he had been terminated for reporting accounting irregularities at the mosque, and was awarded $400,000 in damages by a jury in San Francisco Superior Court.
