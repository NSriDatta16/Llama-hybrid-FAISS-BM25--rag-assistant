America's 11 Most Endangered Places or America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places is a list of places in the United States that the National Trust for Historic Preservation considers the most endangered. It aims to inspire Americans to preserve examples of architectural and cultural heritage that could be "relegated to the dustbins of history" without intervention.

Many of the locations listed by the Trust have been preserved. However, there have been notable losses, such as 2 Columbus Circle, which underwent significant renovations, and the original Guthrie Theater, demolition of which was completed in early 2007.

First released in 1988, the number of sites included on the list has varied, with the most recent lists settling on 11.
