At the time of his retirement in 2003, 11 seasons into their streak of 20 consecutive losing seasons which lasted from 1993 to 2012, he was the last remaining player to leave the Pittsburgh Pirates who had played on a winning team with the club (their last winning season before the streak was in 1992, which was his rookie year).

He also connected off San Francisco's Rod Beck for his first big league home run on 4/9/93 at Three Rivers Stadium.

In his 11 seasons with the Pirates (1992–1995 and 1997–2003), Young played a total of 1022 games at first base and ranks third on the club's all-time list for games played at that position, trailing Gus Suhr (1339) and Jake Beckley (1045). Young spent the 1996 campaign in the Kansas City Royals organization before returning to the Pirates for the 1997 season. He set career highs in batting average (.300) in 1997 and in games (159), home runs (27) and RBI (108) the following year. In 1998, he became the second of only three Pirates player to have at least 20 stolen bases 40 doubles, 25 home runs 100 runs scored and 100 RBI in a single season since Dave Parker in 1978. Jason Bay also reached the feat in 2005

K.Y. played a total of 12 seasons in the Major Leagues, appearing in his final game with the Pirates on 6/27/03. He produced a .258 career average, going 1007-for-3897 with 235 doubles, 17 triples, 144 home runs and 606 RBI in 1205 games. Primarily as first baseman, he also made 97 career appearances at third base where he shares the NL record for most assist in a single game (11) with Cincinnati Reds Chris Sabo. Also played 18 games in right field and 13 in left field during his Major League career.
