Sweet Valley High Senior Year is part of the Sweet Valley High franchise and the last spin-off series to be published. A double edition of the final book, Sweet 18, included the first book from the SVH series, Double Love, and a letter from creator Francine Pascal.  The series is considered the most contemporary and realistic of the franchise .

The Senior Year series continued the earthquake plot that took place in the final Sweet Valley High books, notably that the earthquake destroyed nearby El Carro High. As a result, El Carro students were forced to transfer to Sweet Valley High and several new characters are introduced.  Like the Sweet Valley Junior High series, the chapters are interspersed with "handwritten" diary pages, e-mail entries and similar that explore the characters thoughts "off screen".

The series ends when the twins graduate from high school and their story is continued in the Sweet Valley University series, where they go to university.
