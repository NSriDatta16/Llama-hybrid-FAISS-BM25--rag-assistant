On 18 August 2013, Yanal's first league match with Fenerbahçe, paid the price for its distraction as they squandered a 2–0 first half lead to eventually lose 3–2 to newcomer Torku Konyaspor in their Süper Lig opener at Konya Atatürk Stadium on Saturday evening.

Management style
The 51-year-old Yanal coached Eskişehirspor this past season and led the Central Anatolian side to eighth place in the 18-team Süper Lig. He had previously coached Denizlispor, Ankaragücü, Gençlerbirliği, the Turkish national team, Manisaspor and Trabzonspor but achieved only scant success. In fact, he left or was forced to leave almost all these teams, except Eskişehirspor, before his contract expired. The reason was that Yanal usually adopted a self-destructive tactic of going all out on attack and leaving huge holes in the midfield and defense. That may be why matches involving a team under his tutelage were interesting to watch and also the reason why his team, more often than not, conceded almost as many goals as it scored. Yanal may have changed his tactics a little bit, but the result remained almost exactly the same. While managing Eskişehirspor, the team scored 48 goals but conceded 40.
