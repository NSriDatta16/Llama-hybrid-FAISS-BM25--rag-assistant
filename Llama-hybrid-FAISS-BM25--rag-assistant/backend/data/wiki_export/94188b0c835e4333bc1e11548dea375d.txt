The Miami Sharks were an inaugural franchise of the third incarnation of the American Soccer League in 1988. The team was renamed the Miami Freedom and joined the American Professional Soccer League in 1990 when the ASL merged with the Western Soccer League. The club played in the Orange Bowl in Miami, Florida.

Julio Moreira, a native of Ecuador, was team president and general manager during 1990–1991. He was replaced as team president by David A. Donet, Esq. during a restructuring that also saw the firing of head coach David Irving.

1990
In 1990, the Miami Freedom played their first seasons in the new American Professional Soccer League (APSL) in the South Division of the league's East Conference.  The other members of the division included the Fort Lauderdale Strikers, which won the division that year, the
Tampa Bay Rowdies, Orlando Lions and Washington Diplomats.

While the Freedom were one of the best defensive teams in the league, having only 25 goals scored against them, they had difficulty scoring.  The team's leading scorer, Laszlo Barna, with 7 goals and 5 assists, finished the season 18th in the league's ranking.

The Miami Freedom finished this season with an 8-12.  Despite this record, the team fell just one victory short of reaching post-season play.
