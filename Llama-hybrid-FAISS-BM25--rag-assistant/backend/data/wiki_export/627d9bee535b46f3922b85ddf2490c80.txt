Cursive regrets to announce the departure of cellist Gretta Cohn. After four years in the band, Gretta has decided to leave Omaha to pursue other interests and projects, including a potential solo album. The split is very amicable: the band wishes her well and she in turn eagerly anticipates the new Cursive material to come. Cursive will not be seeking a replacement.

She has collaborated with other artists including the band Twin Thousands. She appeared on 2006's Halloween episode of Late Night with Conan O'Brien, performing with Cat Power.
