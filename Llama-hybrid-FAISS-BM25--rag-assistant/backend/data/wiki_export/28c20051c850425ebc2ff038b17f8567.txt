The company produces a variety of videos, including Baby Parts For Sale, an "investigation into the multimillion-dollar-a-year baby parts trafficking industry" and stem cell research; and Halloween: Trick or Treat?, which challenges parents with a Biblical worldview "to decide whether to allow their children to participate in celebrations which glorify Pagan Occultism".

In 1996, Patrick Matrisciana, the founder of Jeremiah Films and an organization called Citizens for an Honest Government, produced a video called Obstruction of Justice: The Mena Connection. It claimed that two police officers with links to former Arkansas governor, Bill Clinton were implicated in drug trafficking, two murders, and a cover-up of the murders. The police officers sued Matrisciana for defamation and won an award of $598,750. In 1999, the award was overturned after Matrisciana appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. He won in appeals court; the three-judge panel saying: Campbell and Lane being public officials bear the burden of proving statements made by a defendant are false, and they failed to meet that standard. The judge said a public figure plaintiff must also prove malice and they did not.
