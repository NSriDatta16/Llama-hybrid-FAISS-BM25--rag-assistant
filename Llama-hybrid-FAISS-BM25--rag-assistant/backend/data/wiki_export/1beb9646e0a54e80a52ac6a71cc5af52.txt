Name
The village was formed after the Second World War when former villages of Beodra and Dragutinovo were joined into one single village known as Novo Miloševo. Before 1918, Dragutinovo was known as Karlovo.

History

The former village of Beodra was first mentioned in 1331. It was established at present-day location from 1742–53, and was settled by Serbs from Potisje and Pomorišje. The village of Karlovo was established in 1751 by former Serb frontiersmen. In 1918, the name of the village was changed from Karlovo to Dragutinovo, after Dragutin Ristić, a colonel in the Serbian army, whose unit occupied the village. In 1946, Dragutinovo and Beodra were joined into one single village known as Novo Miloševo, after Miloš Popov Klima, a noted Partisan who was born in Dragutinovo.
