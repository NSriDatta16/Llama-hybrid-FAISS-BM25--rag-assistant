Magic Bullet Musketeer Ryuguno 
/ made his entrance before Ryukendo, sending an army of Tsukaima to a quick defeat. He really doesn't like it when people call him "Old Man", a nickname that Kenji started despite the fact that Fudou is only 25 years old. It was eventually revealed that Fudou and Kenji are a combination destined by fate.

Master Ryukendo 
 is an ancient Magic Bullet warrior who with his two allies fought against DaiMaOu in the first war. Unable to defeat DaiMaOu, as only Master Ryukendo went Ultimate, he and his allies combined with the dragons of light and Master Ryukendo became the Madan Ryu Core of GekiRyuKen, his allies becoming GouRyuGun, and ZanRyuJin, so the three could help the next generation. DaiMaOu was reduced to an egg and somehow obtained the three Ultimate Keys, and storing them in Rock Crimson, Lady Gold, and Baron Bloody's bodies, making them immortal. The Canon of light returned Master Ryukendo back to normal, with no memory until the Jamanga attacked. In human form, he wears ancient Japanese clothing, and his Madan Suit is similar to Ryukendo's, except with a cape and bronze accents. He wields a weapon similar to GekiRyuKen, except it uses no keys and dragon head, instead with a diamond replacing the dragon head and chanting Shadu Iraki Yuza to summon his sword and transform. Master Ryukendo showed Kenji the Ultimate Madan Slash before returning into GekiRyuken with no memory of the incident. By episode 50, however, GekiRyuKen recovered his memories as Master Ryukendo and emerged from GekiRyuKen encouraging Kenji to not give up hope, as well as teaching him the method to defeat DaiMaOu once and for all.

Ryukendo 
 is Kenji's partner, transformation device, and primary weapon. Also used to activate the Keys that Kenji finds. Finishers include "Magic Bullet Slash" (Ryukendo), "Blazing Slash" (Fire Ryukendo), "Freezing Slash" (Aqua Ryukendo), "Thunder Lightning Slash" (Thunder Ryukendo). GekiRyuken was later powered-up into , a sword-and-shield combo, similar to Kamen Rider Knight Survive's Dark Visor Zwei from Kamen Rider Ryuki. Finishers include "RyuuOu MaDan Slash", "Exploding Burning Slash" (Burning Ryukendo), "Exploding Freezing Slash" (Blizzard Ryukendo) and "Exploding Lightning Slash" (Lightning Ryukendo). God GekiRyuKen was sacrificed to seal the Power Spot at the end of the series.
The  is a golden dragon that attaches to God GekiRyuKen to create Ultimate GekiRyuKen. Called forth by the Ultimate Key, transforming Kenji into Ultimate Ryukendo. The dragon's body attaches to the shield and the tail to the sword. God GekiRyuKen Ultimate Mode uses the finisher "Ultimate MaDan Slash".
The  is a double-edged sword made from the Magic Bullet Dagger and GekiRyuKen. Each of its finishers is a "Super" version of GekiRyuKen's own.
The small  was used when Kenji couldn't figure out how to reveal his latest Key. Fudou went down into the power spot and brought the Dagger Key to life. He gave it to Kenji, who was fighting Rock Crimson on the surface. The Dagger is similar to GekiRyuKen and attacks with "Dagger Spiral Chain", or combines with GekiRyuKen to form Twin Edge GekiRyuKen.

Ryuguno 
 is Fudou's SPECIAL partner, transformation device, and primary weapon. He has a robotic voice and used primarily as a gun, but a small blade can be extended from the bottom for close-range combat. Finishers include "Dragon Shot" and "Dragon Cannon", although the latter wasn't gained until Fudou achieved it in Episode 6. GouRyuGun was destroyed by Bloody's UFO in Episode 23, and returned in Episode 27 when Fudou became Magna Ryuguno. GouRyuGun was sacrificed to seal the Power Spot at the end of the series.
The  is formed by combining GouRyuGun with the MaDan Magnum. Magna Ryuguno's combined weapon. It's so powerful that Magna Ryuguno must hold it in both hands. Its finisher is the extremely strong "Magna Dragon Cannon."
The  is a small gun with knife, similar to the Madan Dagger, used by Magna Ryuguno. It can attach to the GouRyuGun to make the Magna GouRyuGun.

Ryujino 
 is Koichi's partner, transformation device and weapon. Extremely talkative. Unlike the GekiRyuKen and GouRyuGun, the ZanRyuJin is worn as a brace, rather than around the belt. It serves as a battle axe for the most part, but a second mode, Archery Mode, fires fast-moving arrows at enemy targets. ZanRyuJin's attacks are "RanGeki" in Axe Mode and "RanBu" in Archery Mode. ZanRyuJin was sacrificed to seal the Power Spot at the end of the series.

Generic 
The  is summoned by the Knuckle Key, it can be used by any of the three Warriors as their wrist pad transforms into a powerful, long-distance blaster. Its primary attack is the "Knuckle Spark".
The  is worn around the waist of the Magic Bullet Warriors, calling forth the appropriate Key for any situation. Ryukendo's is blue, Ryuguno's: red, and Ryujino's: black.

SHOT 
SHOT, the Shoot Hell Obduracy Troopers, are the anti-demon force in Akebono. Since nobody believed that demons even exist, SHOT keeps itself in secret, placing their base beneath the Akebono police station through a special elevator that only its members know of. There are only four members in the Akebono branch, not counting the Madan Warriors. The police force is probably the best place to hide SHOT, because Akebono's real police force is hideously incompetent.
: Commander of SHOT, he poses as the "janitor" at the police station. Koichi Shiranami, Ryujinou, believed that Amachi had killed his parents, when in reality Amachi had protected a young Koichi from the explosion caused at the Madan Suits European Testing Facility.
: SHOT's operator and secretary at the Akebono Police Station. Had a brother, now deceased, who sought to protect the fireflies at his lake so that Rin could be happy. Appears to be close to Kenji, even though he couldn't get her name right when they first met. But she has deep feelings for him. When she was asked for a marriage interview by the mayor's only son Hiroshi, she was the one who was very angry on Kenji for allowing her to date Hiroshi San. She is very kind and caring as well as very bad tempered.
: SHOT's Magical Engineer, who sends the Keys and reads the writings that bring about developments against Jamanga in the Canon of Light. He doesn't really know anything, but does serve as a gateway between the Canon of Light and SHOT's purposes.
: A professor of magic that Kiichi respects.

Allies and civilians 
: A florist that Kenji met on his first day in Akebono. She is Kenji's love interest too. But later in the series she developed feelings for Shiranami Koichi and Kenji for Rin. Later on, she was tricked by Lady Gold into believing that Ryukendo had cut down Ichiko and Ritsuko. There appears to be a romantic relationship going on between the two, since Kenji got jealous when Koichi neared her to get flowers for drawing out a Jamanga demon. Kaori was chosen as the leader of the Akebono vigilante group when she "won" the martial arts tournament (due to all of her opponents forfeiting when they refused to attack her). In episode 50 she turns into a Tsukaima and also thanks Kenji for defeating the demon probably knowing that Kenji is Ryukendo.
: A lady ghost in white that only those with a passion for justice, like Kenji and GekiRyuKen, can see. This doesn't do much for their reputation. She's actually a spirit of the first Head of the Akebono Police, a female detective. She assisted Kenji in his first fight against Jack Moon. When spirits were being resurrected, she lived again, and delayed giving Kenji the Akebono flower needed to defeat the demon. She left with the other spirits, but returned as she still wants to hang around. Komachi managed to gather enough energy to help Ryukendo out once in a while, as well as encourage the chief of police, to resume his old way of thinking in terms of justice.
 & : A pair of lively, somewhat incompetent lady cops in Akebono that try to keep the town's peace. More often than not become victims of Jamanga's latest plan, though they are the only cops who actually attempt to fight the demons on a regular basis with a ridiculous supply of firearms ranging from standard police rifles and pistols to a bazooka and SWAT cannon. While Ritsuko was on vacation, Ichiko developed feelings for Rock Crimson before he recovered his memory.
: Kenji's fiancée, also trained in the Narukami Ryuujinryu technique. She occasionally visits Akebono, leaving Rin to watch over him. Was the one to inform Akebono of the Martial Arts tournament. Introduced in episode 10. She also knows the true identity of the Madan Warriors.
Maria(28): is one of Bloody's Jamadroids that was taken in by SHOT and removed of her battle systems. She obeyed Fudou's orders only, but never seemed to smile. When the Jamadroid control tower's barrier had trapped Fudou, Maria rushed in and took his place in the barrier, allowing Fudou to finish off the tower and delete all the androids. In her final moments, she smiled at last.

Jamanga 
The army of demons called Jamanga serves as the principle enemy of the SHOT organization and the Madan Warriors. Their main purpose is to gather minus energy that is created when humans are in despair to resurrect their leader, Daimaou GrenGhost.
: Jamanga's "King of Demons" who fought Master Ryukendo long ago and lost enough energy to regress into a green orb-like egg hovering in the eternally black sky of the area where the Jamanga armies reside. Only when enough Minus Energy, brought about by negative human emotions, is collected, can he be revived. Though he was successfully revived, emerging from his egg to evade Ultimate Ryukendo, GrenGhost was in a larval state and attempt to fully mature at the metal factory, but was easily killed by Ultimate Ryukendo. However, GrenGhost's soul survived and absorbed Worm to create a new human-like body until he possess enough excess power from Ultimate Ryukendo taping into the Power Spot to rip out of his host and assume his true moth-like form before being destroyed by the Madan Warriors' final attack.
: Jamanga's monster-maker, who creates Demon Beasts from the Madan Keys. He performs the menial work, such as resurrecting Rock Crimson and telling Lady Gold not to sit on his demon creation pedestal. After his friend RockCrimson was killed, Worm revealed that he knew of the Ultimate Keys and hid the fact to protect his position. With the truth exposed, he was almost killed by Lady Gold and Baron Bloody, were not for the piece of Rock Crimson on his person. While performing Rock Crimson's funeral, he invited Ryukendo and gang out of his friend's final wish, seeing the true nature of humans. But to save face as a demon and not suffer the wrath of the Jamanga, he revoked his friendship with RockCrimson and defeated the Madan Warriors singlehandedly, now even more bent on solely reviving GrenGhost and nothing else. Now driven insane by his newfound conviction, Worm allowed himself to become GrenGhost's new body, only to meet his end once GrenGhost was powerful enough to assume his true form, tearing Worm's body to pieces in the process.
: A swordsman for Jamanga. Though he swore loyalty to GrenGhost, Jack Moon serves him because he's stronger than himself. Jack Moon's ideal were that the strong rule, refusing to destroy a foe he considers to be weaker, citing such actions as a waste of his time and energy. However, Jack Moon's demonic side has pleasure in attacking the weak. Though Ryukendo originally saw him as his rival, he came to see that Jack Moon has no actual warrior's code when he succumbed to his demonic nature and decided to attack Akebono from his Air Fortress while Ryukendo was unable to fight. After his fortress was destroyed by Thunder Ryukendo in Episode 12, Jack Moon was not seen until in Episode 21, when Baron Bloody saved him from being sacrificed to GrenGhost for betraying Jamanga. However, Jack Moon's body is dying from the conflict between his hearts and decides to his restore his honor by fighting Ryukendo on-on-one during the solar eclipse, restoring his fullpower. Though he fell the Twin Edge GekiRyuKen's Super Thunder Slash, Jack Moon was resurrected as , a cyborg version of himself with golden adornments to his armor and without any memories of himself and freewill, a slave under Bloody. But after GrenGhost's death, he was Jack Moon once more, and, in a final duel with Kenji under the black moonlit night of Christmas, he was defeated by the Narukami Ryuujinryu technique.
: A female warrior whose plans usually involve magic that effect the hearts of her victims as seen when she once made the entire town distrust SHOT, and invaded people's dreams with a special orb. She also has a habit of sitting on Dr. Worm's pedestal. Lady Gold usually lets her trio of personal Familiars fight in her stead. She later gains a Catwoman-like battle suit from Dr Worm when she attempt to steal back the MaDan Keys. When revealed to have Fudou's Ultimate Key in her body, Ryukendo removes it from her before Ryuguno finally destroyed LadyGold by blasting the source of her life, her earring, to bits.
: A warrior who transforms into a massive ball of stone, an old friend of Dr. Worm. Has amazing raw power, but gets set off if anybody calls him "idiot". He was broken into pieces by Ryukendo's Twin Edge GekiRyuKen, only to be revived later by Dr. Worm with Lady Gold's help, giving him a stone that allows Rock Crimson to regenerate even after he's blown to bits. It took a team effort and Fire Ryukendo with the Twin Edge GekiRyuKen to destroy RockCrimson. But using the Power Spot's magic, Rock Crimson was revived, though defeated by the three Maden Warriors, and Magna Ryuguno's trinity attack. before Dr. Worm took RockCrimson's remains to rebuild him. Rock Crimson was revealed to have Kenji's Ultimate Key in his body, unwillingly creating Ultimate Ryukendo, who defeated him once and for all.
: A robotic Demon who saved JackMoon, only to use him as part of his plan. Once Jack Moon died, Bloody took JackMoon's sword and used it to eventually revive JackMoon into MechaniMoon, under his control. He made his attack on Akebono with his AsteRoids before revealing himself, intent on destroying the Maden Ryu Cores. Baron Bloody was the one responsible for killing Koichi Shiranami's parents ten years ago in an attempt to destroy the Madan RyuCores that became Gekiryuu and GouryuuGun, destroying all of Europe if he succeeded. As a result, Bloody became Koichi's mortal enemy. Bloody soon began his part with collecting Minus energy with his Jamadroids and then the construction of Grenstar. He attempted to kill Ryuujinou, but ended up being killed by him, with only his drill staff remaining. But once revived and revealed to have Koichi's Ultimate Key in his body, Bloody was finally destroyed when Ryukendo removes the key before Ryujino lands the deathblow.
: Jamanga's never-ending supply of cannon fodder. These purple-bodied, yellow-striped, one-eyed, bat-eared soldiers appear when there's trouble to be caused. However, with the exception of special Familiars, the regular kinds are neither bright nor difficult to defeat.
 Ganymede, Phobos and Europa, familiars to Lady Gold
 Mecha Familiar, familiars to Baron Bloody
 Fire Familiar (4)
 Swordsman Familiar (4)
 When fighting a Swordsman Familiar at Akebono Temple, it proved to be a match for Ryukendo's normal form. Ryukendo defeats it with his Fire Mode, but the Jamanga somehow took in the fire attack's source and powered up another Swordsman Familiar with Ryukendo's fire power. In this form, the Fire Familiar gains a flaming sword as well as a large shield that could move telepathically. The Fire Familiar overpowered Ryugunou and Ryukendo in his Fire Mode. Fire Ryukendo, while getting in a sword fight with the Familiar, caused large fireballs to launch and burn Akebono City. In the end, Ryugunou captures the Familiar's shield, and Ryukendo transforms into Aqua Ryukendo, destroying the Fire Familiar. Akebono City also snows from the Freezing Slash made from Aqua Ryukendo.

Demon Beasts 
The  are usually created by Dr. Worm using a Madan Key as the core of the monster's form. However, Lady Gold and Baron Bloody can also create their own monsters but without Madan Keys.
 : A metal-eating insect Demon Beast impervious to most blades and guns, but was killed by Ryukendo, who acquired the Fire Key from it. A 2nd red version was created by Lady Gold and shrunk so it can infect people with a virus that turns their skin into iron and cause them to lash out violently before it was destroyed by Ryujino in Shadow Wing Mode.
 : A flower Demon Beast that was planted by Dr. Worm in Akebono, and eventually grew to giant size under the watchful eye of a young boy, Shigeru. All it took to bring it down was Fire Ryukendo's Blazing Slash. After the battle, Kenji acquired the Aqua Key from it.
 : A balloon Demon Beast, Balloon Gamma can shoot a beam that causes people to swell up like balloons, and would've made them explode within an hour of their ballooning. With a careful eye and steady hand, Ryuguno was able to defeat it with his new weapon at the time, Dragon Cannon.

Being a copy of Jack Moon, Elemoon had half of his "father's" power augmented with the Thunder Key, and used his blade as a rifle. Though he gathered mass amounts of minus energy, SHOT managed to trap Elemoon in tank Dr. Worm had been driving in Episode 3, only for him to fully use the Thunder Key to get out. However, the power the key had proved too much for Elemoon as it killed him to Jack Moon's annoyance for his lowly clone to be put in such a predicament in the first place.
 : A ghost-like Demon Beast that brought the spirits of the dead back to life, able to become intangible yet has a weakness for sunlight. Once rendered tangible, Ryukendo uses the Twin Edge GekiRyuKen to kill it. Dr. Worm later revived Beyonder as , only to be defeated by Ryujino and Aqua Ryukendo.

Grem Goblin was the first to be defeated by God Ryukendo's RyuuOu Madan Slash.
 : A giant Demon Beast that targets indecisive people, teleporting them to her tunnel-like stomach, chasing them with a smaller version of herself.
