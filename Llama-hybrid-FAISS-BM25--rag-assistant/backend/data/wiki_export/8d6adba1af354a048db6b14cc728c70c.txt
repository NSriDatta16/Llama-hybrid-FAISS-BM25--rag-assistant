In November 2013, d'Olier Gibson appeared in Oxford magistrates' court after allegedly assaulting Beckett at their home during a discussion over their possible divorce. Beckett called the police, who in trying to restrain d'Olier Gibson used pepper spray and struck him with a baton. Having discovered a missing shotgun, he was eventually arrested after armed police were called to the property. d'Olier Gibson was charged with assaulting both Beckett and arresting officer PC Aaron Walker; he denied both charges. Convicted for his "sustained and drunken" attack on PC Walker, he was ordered to wear an electronic tag for two months and given a curfew. On release, d'Olier Gibson started divorce proceedings.
