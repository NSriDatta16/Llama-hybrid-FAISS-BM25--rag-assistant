Hipposideros is one of the most diverse genera of bats, with more than 70 species.  They are collectively called roundleaf bats after the shape of their nasal ornament. It is the type genus of the family Hipposideridae. It is divided into species groups based on morphology.

Some species that were previously placed in Hipposideros are now placed in the related genera Doryrhina and Macronycteris. Conversely, the genus Paracoelops, which was considered distinct until 2012, is now synonymized with Hipposideros, as the only species turned out to be based on a specimen of Hipposideros pomona.

Fossil species 
The species Hipposideros bernardsigei Hand, 1997 describes one of many species of bats discovered in the north of Australia, the Riversleigh fauna, and appears to be a member of an Australopapuan group in an early radiation of the genus. The first hipposiderid to be described from Pliocene deposits at Riversleigh was Hipposideros winsburyorum Hand, 1999. Other named fossil species allied to Hipposideros include Hipposideros (Pseudorhinolophus), Hipposideros collongensis, Hipposideros conquensis, Hipposideros felix, Hipposideros minor, Hipposideros morloti, Hipposideros omani and Hipposideros schlosseri.
