Anophthalmus hitleri () is a species of blind cave beetle found only in about fifteen humid caves in Slovenia. The blind cave beetle shares its genus with 41 other species and 95 different subspecies. Members of its subfamily (Trechinae) are, like most Carabidae, predatory, so the adults and larvae of A. hitleri are presumed to be predators on smaller cave inhabitants.

Name 
The scientific name of the beetle comes from an Austrian collector, Oskar Scheibel, who was sold a specimen of a then-undocumented species in 1933. Its species name was made a dedication to Adolf Hitler, who had recently become Chancellor of Germany. The dedication did not go unnoticed by Hitler, who sent Scheibel a letter showing his gratitude. The genus name means eyeless. 

The species exhibits no notable characteristics, such as extravagant colors or unusual antennae, but is of interest to beetle collectors (and also collectors of Hitler memorabilia) as a result of its name. This is putting the beetle in danger of extinction.

While many have suggested the species be renamed, the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature's principle of priority holds that the first name validly given to a species is its correct name and does not in general allow for a name to be invalidated due to causing offense. On the topic of A. hitleri's name, International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) President Thomas Pape says: "It was not offensive when it was proposed, and it may not be offensive 100 years from now." One potential solution suggested by the vice-president of the ICZN, Patrice Bouchard, was to "change the vernacular name", and in September 2023, the new vernacular name, Slovenian blind cave beetle, was proposed.
