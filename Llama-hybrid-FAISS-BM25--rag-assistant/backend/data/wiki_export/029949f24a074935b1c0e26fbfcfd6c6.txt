The NES version was released by Milton Bradley, and ported by Software Creations on behalf of producer Rare.

The game is a continuation of the Epyx sports line that includes Summer Games and Winter Games.

World Games was made available in Europe for the Wii virtual console on April 25, 2008.

Reception

Writing for Info, Benn Dunnington gave the Commodore 64 version of World Games three-plus stars out of five and described it as "my least favorite of the series". Stating that slalom skiing was the best event, he concluded that "Epyx does such a nice, consistent job of execution, tho, that it's hard to take off too many points even for such boring material". Computer Gaming Worlds Rick Teverbaugh criticized the slalom skiing and log rolling events' difficulty, but concluded that "World Games is still a must for the avid sports games". Charles Ardai called the game "an adequate sequel" to Epyx's previous Games, and praised the graphics. He criticized the mechanics "as bizarre little joystick patterns which have little to do with the events" but still recommended the game because of the log rolling event. Jame Trunzo praised the game's use of advanced graphics and sound, including humorous effects. Also noted was the variety in the included games, preventing the game from getting too repetitive.

The game was reviewed in 1988 in Dragon #132 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in "The Role of Computers" column. The reviewers gave the game 5 out of 5 stars.

A budget-priced re-release of the Commodore 64 version was positively received in Commodore User who said it was "the pinnacle of the Games series".
