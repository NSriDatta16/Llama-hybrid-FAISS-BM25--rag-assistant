Background and release
In 1991, playing the role of Nikki Spencer on Channel 10's drama soap, E Street, Tkautz embarked on a recording career.  Melissa's debut single, "Read My Lips", reached number 1 on the Australian singles chart., was certified platinum and became the sixth highest-selling single of 1991 in Australia. Tkautz's next single, "Sexy (Is The Word)", reached number 3, was certified gold, and was the fifty-seventh highest-selling single of 1991 in Australia. 
Her third single, 1992's "Skin to Skin", peaked at number 16 in Australia.

Following the release of these three singles, the album Fresh was released in June 1992. The album did not fare as well as the singles, peaking at number 15 in Australia, and spending only seven weeks in the top 100. A fourth single from the album, "My House", was issued in November 1992, but peaked outside the top 100 at number 119.
