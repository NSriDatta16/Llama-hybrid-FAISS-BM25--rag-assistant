Reception

Critical reception

Upon its release, the album received a generally positive reception from music critics. AllMusic's David Jeffries praised Khaled for crafting an album that's diverse in its production geography-wise and for bringing out great performances from his artists. A.L. Friedman of PopMatters also praised Khaled for bringing in an all-star cast of artists and producers, signaling out "Born-N-Raised" and "Gangsta Shit" as the album's highlights. Vibe contributor Damien Scott felt that Khaled "masterfully balances hometown pride with outer regional influences", highlighting "Holla at Me", "Problem" and "Candy Paint" for their production and lyricism, concluding that "[T]his compilation makes a solid sonic case for why it deserves to be heard."
Steve 'Flash' Juon of RapReviews gave a mixed review of the record, saying it was competent and has a few standout tracks but that it didn't reveal much about Khaled besides the fact that he has many connections and shows pride in representing Miami. Andres Tardio of HipHopDX gave credit to the catchy production, but felt it was let down by the weak lyricism delivered by almost every artist throughout the record, concluding that "If nothing else, this album shows off Khaled's connections, but it does little justice to Khaled's talent."
