The Himalaya kingdom was a mountainous country in the Himalayas, mentioned in the Puranas. In the puranas, Himavat was its ruler and his daughter Parvati was a princess from this kingdom.  The Indian epic Mahabharata doesn't mention a kingdom named Himalaya, but mentions many kingdoms in the Himalaya mountains like the Kuninda, Parvata, Nepa, Kirata, Kimpurusha, and Kinnara.
