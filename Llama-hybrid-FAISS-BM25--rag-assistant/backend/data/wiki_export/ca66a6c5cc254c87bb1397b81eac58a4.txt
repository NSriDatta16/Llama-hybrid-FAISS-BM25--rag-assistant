History

20th century 
Ferrovial was founded by Rafael del Pino y Moreno in 1952 as a company focused on railway construction. Its first works consisted of the renovation of tracks for Renfe and operating railroad tie sleeper workshops.

It receives its first international project in 1954: a railway project in Venezuela, and in 1956, it renovated the railway between Bilbao and Portugalete.

In the 1960's, Ferrovial focused on the road market through the Redia Plan11 and the concession of the Bilbao-Behobia Highway, the first toll road tendered with private financing and management in Spain.

The company expanded in the early years of the new millennium by acquiring 58.5% of Polish construction company Budimex Dromex S.A. in April 2000.In 1974, it obtained its second concession in Spain, the Burgos-Armiñón highway, which linked Burgos with Bilbao and the French border of Behobia. The 1970s came to a close with the award of a construction project on 700 kilometers of roads in Libya, and its construction was completed in 1986.

In 1985, Ferrovial acquired Cadagua, an engineering and construction company for Water Treatment and Purification Plants established in 1971. It was also awarded construction of the High-Speed Train between Madrid and Seville, as well as numerous infrastructure projects for the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona and the World Expo of Seville in 1992.

That same year saw the appointment of Rafael del Pino Calvo-Sotelo as CEO, who began a strategic reorganization of the company.

In 1995, Ferrovial acquired the construction company Agroman founded in 1927, which it returned to record profits three years later. In 1997, construction began on the Guggenheim Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art in Bilbao, where Ferrovial implemented a pioneering Environmental Management System in the European structure.

In 1999, Ferrovial went public and integrated all its construction activity into Ferrovial Agroman. Following the founder's retirement in 2000, his son, Rafael del Pino Calvo-Sotelo, became Chair. That same year, Ferrovial took over Budimex, then the leading Polish construction company in terms of turnover and market capitalization.

It was also awarded the Ontario Highway 407 407 ETR concession in Toronto, Canada.

 21st century 
By following the internationalization and diversification strategy, Ferrovial acquired a 20% share in the Sydney Airport in the airport sector in 2002.

Similarly, it acquired two urban services companies in 2003: the British company Amey and Spanish company Cespa. The concessionaire Cintra went public in 2004, and in 2005, Ferrovial acquired the handling company Swissport and the Texan construction company Webber.

In 2006, the company bought the British airport operator BAA and through this operation, it came to manage seven airports in the United Kingdom: Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, and Southampton, and it took ownership of shares and managing the Budapest Airport in Hungary, the Naples Airport in Italy, and the Melbourne airport in Australia. In 2006, Cintra also obtained the concession for operating the Indiana Toll Road turnpike. and signed an agreement with the Texas Department of Transportation to build and manage Segments 5 and 6 of the SH-130 Turnpike, both of which are in the  US.

In 2007, Ferrovial sold the Budapest airport, as well as its holdings in the Australian airports in Sydney, Melbourne, Launceston, Perth, and three airports in the Northern Territory. It also started to concentrate its airport business in the UK. That year, Cintra signed a contract for the construction and operation of the Central Greece Toll Highway (E65), and Amey was chosen by Network Rail (the UK's rail infrastructure manager) as one of its three exclusive providers for Britain's National Rail track renovation services.

In 2008, the Montabliz viaduct, the highest aqueduct in Spain, was inaugurated and connected Cantabria and the plateau by road. A year later, Cintra was awarded the construction, maintenance, and operation of the North Tarrant Express Highway in Texas in the US.

In 2009, the company was reunited under a new logo and brand image, with yellow and white establishing its hallmark. Several designs had been used before then, such as black letters on a yellow background which can still be seen on some old signs.

In 2010, Ferrovial made several divestments in accordance with its asset rotation policy, which meant its departure from Swissport. Through BAA, it announced the sale of its stake in Airport Property Partnership and the Naples Airport. Likewise, Ferrovial, sold all its shares in Tube Lines (concessionaire of three London Underground lines) through Amey; signed an agreement for the construction of Heathrow Terminal 2 in London; and sold 60% of Cintra Chile.

In addition, it signed a contract to manage and renovate the largest and fifth busiest airport in the United States: Denver International Airport.

In the town of El Salado, Colombia, the company delivered a new water system as part of the Social Infrastructures program: an aqueduct that is energetically powered by a solar panel facility, making it unique in the country. To spread the word about this project, the company worked with local artists to release  a graphic novel as part of the campaign "Water for peace."

Ignacio Madridejos was appointed as the new CEO of the company in 2019. The sale of Broad spectrum to Ventia for €303 million of Equity Value was also announced. The RiverLinx consortium, which Ferrovial participates in, was chosen to manage the Silvertown Tunnel in London.

Criticism

The Palau Case 
As part of the Palau Case investigation, Anti-Corruption discovered "sufficient evidence” of Ferrovial Agroman paying illicit commissions to the Democratic Convergence of Catalonia (CDC) party through the Palau de la Música Catalana to ensure that public works such as the City of Justice and the unfinished line 9 of the Barcelona Metro station would be awarded to them.

On January 15, 2018, the Provincial Court of Barcelona issued a judgment in the Palau Case, acquitting the two executives related to Ferrovial Agroman. The prosecution appealed that acquittal, but the appeal was dismissed by the Supreme Court.
