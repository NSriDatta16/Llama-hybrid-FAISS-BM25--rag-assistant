In 2003, Anderson travelled to the United States to compete in the AMA 125cc national championship for the Yamaha of Troy team, he finished the year in seventh place overall and collected one win at Southwick, Massachusetts. Anderson was fired from the team following the season despite having two years remaining on his contract. In 2004, he moved up to the 250cc AMA national championship where he finished in 17th place overall.
