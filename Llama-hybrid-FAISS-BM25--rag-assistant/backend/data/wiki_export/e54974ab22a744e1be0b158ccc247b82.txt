Jindřich Šimon Baar  (7 February 1869, Klenčí pod Čerchovem – 24 October 1925, Klenčí pod Čerchovem) was a Czech Catholic priest and writer, realist, author of the so-called country prose. He joined the Czech Catholic modern style, but later severed the ties with that movement. As writer, he emphasized traditional moral values of the countryside.

Born into a peasant family, he did religious studies and was ordained as a Catholic priest in 1892. As a priest, he strived, unsuccessfully, for reforms in the church.

Works
Among his novels are:
 Cestou křížovou (1900) – the first fruit, autobiographic description of the uneasy life as a reform priest
 Pro kravičku (1905)
 Farská panička (1906)
 Farské historky (1908)
 Jan Cimbura (1908) – highly idealized depiction of peasant life
 historical trilogy: Paní komisarka (1923), Osmačtyřicátníci (1924) and Lůsy (1925)

He also published several short stories and collections of fairy tales.
