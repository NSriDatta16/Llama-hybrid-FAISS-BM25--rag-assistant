Pir Sadar al-Din (Sadardin) or Pir Sadruddin was a fourteenth-century Nizari Ismaili da'i and is regarded as the founder of the Khoja Nizari Ismaili community, also called Satpanth.

He was the son and successor of Pir Shihab al-Din, and was one of the most prominent Ismaili authors of the 14th century. He was a contemporary of the Nizari Ismaili Imam Islam Shah.

Born in Persia, Sadardin later travelled to South Asia, settled in the Sindh area (in what is now southern Pakistan), founded the Khoja community and developed the Khojki script; he also wrote ginans. Pir Sadardin composed the previous Du'a, which was recited by Ismailis during several centuries, was very long and took almost half an hour to be recited. His "Gat Paj ji Dua" also summarized the story of Creation.

Pir Sadar al-Din's ginans were the last of the ginans that have been studied today to mention Alamut or Daylam, suggesting that until this time, Ismaili presence – which is commonly thought to have been obliterated after the fall of Alamut to the Mongols in 1256 – had remained in the regions of Alamut and Daylam until his life time the 14th century.
