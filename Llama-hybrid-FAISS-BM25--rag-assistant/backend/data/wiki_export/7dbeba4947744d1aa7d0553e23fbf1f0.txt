10 Years Younger in 10 Days, previously called 10 Years Younger (and sometimes called 10 Years Younger: The Challenge), is a make over show aired on Channel 5 in Britain and repeated on its 5Star network. As 10 Years Younger, the series debuted as a Channel 4 programme in 2004, before being relaunched and rebranded by Channel 5 in 2020.

Presented for its first five series by Nicky Hambleton-Jones, who was replaced by Myleene Klass for series six, with Cherry Healey hosting the show for Channel 5, with the programme's full name also being used in Australia.

About the show
With the help of experts the participant of the show is given a complete make over in an attempt to make them look 10 Years Younger, partially through plastic surgery. At the start of the programme the person's age is guessed by 100 people on the street and an average is taken. From this average the target image is set. At the end of the show this happens again to see the results.

The programme regularly makes use of cosmetic surgery, which has attracted criticism from some quarters. However, in his book 10 Years Younger: Cosmetic Surgery Bible, the show's resident consultant surgeon Jan Stanek says: "I decided to take part in the series because I felt that it offered an opportunity to shine an honest light on what was involved in cosmetic surgery and to address some of the common misconceptions about it."
