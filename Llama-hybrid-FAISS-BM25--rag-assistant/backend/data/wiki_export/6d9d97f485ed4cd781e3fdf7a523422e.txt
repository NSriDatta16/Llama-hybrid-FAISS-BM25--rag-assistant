History

In the US, the Eskimo Pie chocolate bar was invented in Iowa by a pharmacy owner named Chris Nelson, who was inspired by a boy named Douglas Ressenden who could not decide between candy and ice cream. They were named "I-Scream-Bars" in the original test run. One of the earliest advertisements for Eskimo Pies appeared in the November 3, 1921 issue of the Iowa City Press-Citizen. A patent was awarded in 1922, but invalidated in 1928.

According to the Good Humor ice cream company, confectioner Harry Burt invented ice cream on a stick in 1920, and was granted a patent in 1923. This product also was enrobed in chocolate, and other products were produced.
