Addiscombe tram stop is a light rail stop in the London Borough of Croydon in the southern suburbs of London.

The tram stop is located between Bingham Road and Lower Addiscombe Road, on a section of line which follows the trackbed of the former Woodside and South Croydon Railway. However the former railway was on an embankment at this point and crossed over both roads on bridges. During construction of Tramlink, the embankment was removed, the bridges replaced with level crossings and the tram stop built at street level.

The tram stop is built on the site of Bingham Road Halt on the Woodside and South Croydon Railway which was closed in 1915. A new station Bingham Road opened in 1935 was situated on the other (south) side of Bingham Road but closed in 1983.  The same railway's Addiscombe station was located on a branch line, about 500 metres to the west.
