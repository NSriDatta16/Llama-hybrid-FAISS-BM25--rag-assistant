Kilsfjorden is a fjord in Volda Municipality in Møre og Romsdal county, Norway.  It is located in the central part of the municipality, about  east of the Dalsfjorden.  The Kilsfjorden is located in the Sunnmørsalpene mountains and it flows north and joins the Austefjorden to form the Voldsfjorden.  The village of Straumshamn lies on the southwestern coast of the fjord, at the entrance to the Kilspollen, a nearly  long inlet that comes off of the Kilsfjorden.
