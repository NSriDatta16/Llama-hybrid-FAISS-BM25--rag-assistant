Rao Tula Ram helped Emperor Bahadur Shah and other rebel forces who were waging war against British in Delhi. He sent  Rs 45000/- through General Bakht Khan, ten days before the fall of Delhi  and  supplied large quantities of necessary commodities and supplied two thousand sacks of wheat.

The battle 
Rao's forces, which were led by his cousin Rao Kirshan Singh, fought against the British on 16 November 1857 in the field of Nasibpur on outskirts of Narnaul.
