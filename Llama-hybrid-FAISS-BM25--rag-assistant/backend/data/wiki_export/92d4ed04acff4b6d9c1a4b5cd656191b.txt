Baron Lovelace, of Hurley in the County of Berks, was a title in the Peerage of England. It was created on 31 May 1627 for Sir Richard Lovelace, who had earlier represented Berkshire, Abingdon and Windsor in Parliament. The second Baron served as Lord Lieutenant of Berkshire. The third Baron sat as Member of Parliament for Berkshire. The fourth Baron was Governor of New York and New Jersey. The title became extinct on the early death of the sixth Baron in 1736.

The Lovelace title was revived in 1838 when William King, 8th Baron King was made Earl of Lovelace. He was the husband of Ada, daughter of Lord Byron and a descendant of the Barons Lovelace.
