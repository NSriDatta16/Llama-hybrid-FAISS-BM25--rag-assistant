Emathia () in ancient times was a geopolitical toponym, although no doubt based on a type of coastline terrain (stony or sandy) prevalent in the region at the time. The toponym comprised different territories at different times, expanding from a base in the lower Axios River valley to include all of what was renamed to Macedonia. The details of the initial  terrain, being in the delta of a river with a high rate of flow, are subject to rapid geologic change, easily perceptible over historic time.

Emathia initially was the region of the Macedonian capital polis, Pella of Meris (subdivision) II, also of the capital of the Macedonian League, Beroia. In portraying these poleis moderns usually use the modern map and base their conclusions upon it. With the advent of core samples and carbon dating in the latter 20th century it was soon discovered that the 19th and early 20th century literary analyses had not taken into consideration the changes made by the Axios and other rivers, as well as the latest available archaeological data. Pella was not a late classical or Hellenistic settlement, although rendered into a legitimate polis by Philip II. Mycenaean surface sherds supported at least a Bronze-age provenience, or close to it. 

Moreover, Pella until quite late in the classical period had been a port city of the Thermaic Gulf. Subsequently its estuary became a lake until it was dispensed with by agriculturalists of the 20th century, with a river as a remnant. Consequently the modern rivers there as well as the filled area, called "the Central Macedonian Plain," are quite late and cannot be used to reconstruct the details presented by the literary sources. Today most of the C. Macedonian Plain is occupied by the Axios Delta National Park, mainly a collection of wetlands. Modern Imathia, etymologicaLly from the same ancient word, is a new creation of modern Greece, as is modern Macedonia.

History of the terrain

Subsidence and aggradation in the region

The Aegean Sea Plate undergoing subsidence because of back-arc extension behind the Hellenic arc, the Aegean Sea is a classic example of drowned terrain: islands fronted by steep cliffs formed from mountain-tops, submergent coastlines with long estuaries formed by flooding from the sea. Acting contrary to the submergence is aggradation. Drowned rivers dump their sediment into their new estuaries creating river deltas. The deltas eventually combine to form alluvuial shelves and valleys, which, in the Aegean, typically became agricultural areas.

Over any period, an aggraded shoreline is the result of an equilibrium between subsidence and aggradation. Subsidence pushed the coastline inland; aggradation brings it out. The equilibrium may be cyclical, or it may trend in one direction.

Core studies in the C. Macedonian Plain compared with core studies from the whole Mediterranean have established that throughout the Aegean the rate of subsidence is on the average a little less than a metre per thousand years, which expresses itself as a rise in sea level to an observer at the surface. Bintliff calls this a "eustatic rise."

The shoreline at any isochron; that is a line on the basin wall  every part of which has the same date, obviously depends on the configuration of the surface between the location of the foot of the core and the concurrent shoreline. The more core samples that are available, the better the geologist can detail the surface. All models retain an element of speculation. However, in the case of the C. Macedonian Plain, Bintliff reports on a number of circumstances recent enough to add new meaning to the historical sources.

The plain is readily perceptible on the map, being the green area at the mouth of the Axios, today's Vardar River. Stretching across the Vardar, it extends E-W from Thessaloniki to Naoussa, a distance of about , and N-S from Giannitsa to Vergina, about . This is approximately the location of modern Imathia, which many conclude descends from Emathia. The latter country, however, is distinguished from the ancient by not having been there. In its place was either a shallow estuary of the Thermaic Gulf, or a lake in a marsh, from prehistoric times to nearly the present. Ancient Emathia can only have been further north, but of course at the time when the name was changed, Emathia was all of Macedonia.

The white clay marker bottom
In the 19th and 20th centuries the geologic formation of the terrain was of concern to the archaeologists working in the area. They formulated a number of models, accelerating after the excavation of Nea Nikomedeia (NN here), 1961-1963. NN is a Neolithic site at , within the borders of Veria, ancient capital of the Macedonian League, on the right bank of a tributary of the Moglenitsas River. The site and the city are at the SW edge of the Plain.

Testimony of the sources

Earliest known name of Paeonia
Polybius (23.10.4) mentions that Emathia was earliest called Paeonia and Strabo (frg 7.38) that Paeonia was extended to Pieria and Pelagonia. According to N. G. L. Hammond, the references are related to Bronze Age period before the Trojan War.

Under the name of Emathia
Homer, who makes no mention of Macedonia, places Emathia as a region next to Pieria.

The Homeric name was renewed mainly in Roman times and Ptolemy mentions some cities of Emathia.
In Nonnus, Dionysiaca 48.6 Typhoeus having stripped the mountains of Emathia, he cast the rocky missiles at Dionysus. In Ovid, Metamorphoses 5.313 the daughters of Pierus say: "we grant Emathia's plains, to where uprise Paeonia's peaks of snow".

The change to Macedonia
The Emathian or  is a frequently used name by Latin poets for Alexander the Great, as in Milton, the Emathian conqueror. Strabo relates that "what is now called Macedonia was in earlier times called Emathia" but since Homer, the earliest source considers Emathia only a region next to Pieria, Strabo's reference should be interpreted in the Roman era context of Emathia's name reviving. The same stands for Latin writers who name Thessaly as Emathia; the Roman province of Macedonia included Thessaly. In 12.462 of Metamorphoses, an Emathian named Halesus is killed by the centaur Latreus and in Catullus 64. 324, Peleus is  (protector).

Etymology

Folk-etymologies
Emathia was named after the Samothracian king Emathion and not after the local Emathus.

Greek terrain etymology
The etymology of the name is of Homeric Greek origin - ‘amathos’= sandy soil, opp. to sea-sand (psámathos = ψάμαθος); in plural the links or dunes by the sea, [compare  êmathóeis = ἠμαθόεις/ἠμᾰθόεις (masc.), ēmathóessa = ἠμαθόεσσα (fem.), ēmathóen = ἠμαθόεν (neut.) epic for amathóeis/ámathos = ἀμᾰθόεις ἄμαθος and êmathoessa (see above) 'sandy', i. e. the coastal, sandy/swampy land around Axius river, in contrast to mountainous Macedonia, probably also intended as 'laying large land' (cf. PIE *mē-2, *m-e-t- 'to mow, to reap').

Towns
The most important towns of Emathia were:

Aigai (first capital and holy city of Macedonia)
Beria (modern Veria)
Kition (modern Naoussa)
Alexander the Great with settlers from this area founded Emathia in Syria.
