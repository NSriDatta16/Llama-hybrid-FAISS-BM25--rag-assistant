Sweat is an Australian drama television series created by John Rapsey and produced by Barron Entertainment in association with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in Perth. The show aired on Network Ten in 1996 for one season of 26 episodes and centred on students at an Australian school for the athletically gifted. In early 1997, Ten announced that they had no plans for a second season.

Scenes were shot in and around Perth including locations such as HBF Stadium, Arena Joondalup, the Town of Cambridge, the now defunct Perry Lakes Stadium and the Perth SpeedDome.
