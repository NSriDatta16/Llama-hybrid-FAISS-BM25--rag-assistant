Cole Harbour District High School is a Canadian public high school located in the Forest Hills area of Cole Harbour, Nova Scotia. It is operated by the Halifax Regional Centre for Education (HRCE), and is an International Baccalaureate (IB) world school, offering the Diploma program.

History

Cole Harbour District High School was founded in 1982 by the amalgamation of Cole Harbour High School, founded in 1979, and Gordon Bell High School. The newer building for Cole Harbour High was used as the new location for Cole Harbour District High, and Gordon Bell High was repurposed as the Gordon Bell Building, a general-purpose adult education centre. The Gordon Bell Building served as the Grade 10 building until 1995 when the Cole Harbour District high school was split into two separate schools. Cole Harbour High and Auburn High.  The Bell building was also used as a temporary location for the students of Halifax West High School during the 2001-2002 school year, when its own building was unusable due to health concerns. As of January 2015 the Gorden Bell building has been demolished.

Cole Harbour District High is seen in the hit series Trailer Park Boys. It is used as the location to film the scenes that take place in the fictional Dartmouth Regional Vocational School (DRVS). CHDHS's unofficial rival school is Auburn Drive High School, with whom they play a football game against every Thanksgiving weekend called the Turkey Bowl. In the 2014-2015 school year, renovations were completed on the school adding a new gym and a skilled trades centre while converting the old gymnasium into a cafetorium. The skilled trades centre also includes a yoga studio and a student council office.

Cole Harbour District High School appeared on national news in the late 1980s after a number of riots broke out at the school, alleged to be race-based.  The school was temporarily shut down due to these events.

The school was in the news again in March 2008, when brawls broke out in the school prompting a lockdown.  Two students were arrested, another two sent to hospital.  Though the cause is not completely clear, many think that it resulted in 24 suspensions. Though the brawls only lasted one afternoon, some of the concerns that students and parents had in the 1990s were brought up again. These concerns were again brought up in April, 2009, when another brawl took place after a fire alarm was pulled. One student was sent to the hospital for treatment and several suspensions were handed out. 
In the spring of 2013, Cole Harbour High reappeared on national news following the death of Rehtaeh Parsons, as this was a school that Parsons had previously attended, though she was enrolled at Prince Andrew High School at the time of her suicide. The incident raised questions about the school board's lack of action against bullying. In October 2018, the school was once again in the news after a confrontation between a teacher and a student occurred. The school was in hold and secure and the student was checked by paramedics, but showed no signs of injuries. The teacher was arrested on November 9, 2018.
