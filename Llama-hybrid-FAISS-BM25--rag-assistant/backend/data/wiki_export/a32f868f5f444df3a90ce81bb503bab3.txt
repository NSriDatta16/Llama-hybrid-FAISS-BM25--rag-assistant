is a diary of 20th-century Indian philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurti (18951986). Written during , it was reputedly not intended for publication; the manuscript also became entangled in copyright and custody disputes. The diary was eventually published in 1976 over objections of Krishnamurti associates, and an expanded edition with additional material was published in 2003. The work one of the very few books Krishnamurti wrote himself has been noted for poetic and penetrating descriptions of nature, but is best known for its first hand accounts of persistent, unusual physical experiences and states of consciousness. It has been called "a remarkable mystical document" in press reports, while an authorized Krishnamurti biographer described it as containing "the whole essence" of his philosophy.

About the work

Krishnamurti's first entry in this handwritten journal, quoted above in its entirety, is dated  with the location given as New York City. He continued writing almost daily for nine months while at various locales; there are about 200 entries in total, almost all of them between one and two print pages in length. The last entry is dated  at Bombay (Mumbai). The published work is considered one of the few books that Krishnamurti actually wrote himself; the majority of his other books consist of edited or verbatim transcripts of talks, discussions and dictations, or are curated collections of excerpts from the same   

The diary portrays Krishnamurti's world from the inside; according to a commentator, it provides a "panorama of the landscape of Krishnamurti's daily consciousness. In particular, the diary describes Krishnamurti's experience of a nearly lifelong, often acutely painful condition he called , and manifestations of a state he refers to as  a state that often, but not always, appeared concurrently with . As is the case with other Krishnamurti works, the entries often include his impressions of nature, individuals and society, the descriptions of which have a "poetic quality" according to 

The journal begins (and ends) without preamble; shortly before he started writing it, Krishnamurti, then in London, reputedly experienced a recurrence of  during May and , witnessed by associates. In the time period covered by the diary, similar events were witnessed by other associates while Krishnamurti was in Switzerland in the summer of 1961; the diary and the events or states described, again reputedly perceived by others, continued upon his arrival to India in late autumn of the same  

The work was minimally edited for clarity and spelling by authorized Krishnamurti biographer Mary Lutyens, who provided the Foreword for the original edition (published 1976). In it she states, â€œIn this unique daily record we have what may be called the well-spring of Krishnamurti's teaching. The whole essence of his teaching is here, arising from its natural source. Elsewhere Lutyens writes, "apart from its content, it is an extraordinary manuscript,  without a single erasure. She devoted a chapter to this book in the second volume of her biography of Krishnamurti, The Years of Fulfillment (published 1983). In it she mentions objections raised against the diary's publication by Krishnamurti associates who had read the manuscript and thought it presented a picture of Krishnamurti at odds with his public pronouncements; his responses to these objections are 

Lutyens had revealed the existence of  in The Years of Awakening, the first volume of her biography of Krishnamurti (published 1975). This physical condition which Krishnamurti and those around him did not consider as medical in nature and experiences similar to , had reputedly originally appeared in 1922. At the time, Krishnamurti was associated with the Theosophical Society and the related World Teacher Project. The existence and history of these experiences had remained unknown outside of the Theosophical Society leadership and Krishnamurti's circle of close associates and 

Roland Vernon, another of his biographers, states that previous attempts (by others), at revealing details from his past, including these reputed experiences, were suppressed by Krishnamurti. According to Vernon, Krishnamurti "believed, with good reason, that the sensationalism of his early story would cloud the public's perception of his  current work". However, Krishnamurti often hinted at -like states in later talks and discussions; he was more expansive on the subject with close associates, also stating that the experience of  continued as he was nearing 

Around the time of the diary's original publication more than fourteen years after the final entry Krishnamurti stated, "I did not write it for  I have attempted to put into words the actual pain and sensation which goes with the heightened

Publication history

The manuscript was entangled in personal and legal disputes between Krishnamurti and D. Rajagopal, Krishnamurti's erstwhile editor and business manager. An agreement in 1974 regarding this and other Krishnamurti materials allowed eventual publication, and the first edition appeared in  via longtime Krishnamurti publishers Gollancz in the United Kingdom and Harper & Row in the United States .

The front and back covers of both impressions feature the same set of contemporary photographs of Krishnamurti. After the Foreword by Lutyens there is a table of contents labeled "Itinerary", listing the places the diary was kept. Copyright was held by the Krishnamurti Foundation Trust (KFT), a UK-based organization. A paperback edition was first published in the US by Harper's Perennial Library imprint in  

Following the discovery in the  of thirty-two additional diary pages, the work was republished in an expanded edition (the "Full Text Edition") in 2003 by Krishnamurti Publications, the official publisher and distributor of Krishnamurti's works. It includes facsimiles of original diary pages and an additional, edition-specific foreword; the updated "Itinerary" precedes both forewords. It features a photograph similar to the first edition's on the front cover (Krishnamurti alone in a nature setting); a 1935 portrait of his by Edward Weston is on the back cover. This edition's copyright was again registered to the KFT. It was followed by  in 

The work was first published in digital media in 2008, as a Kindle e-book release of the full text edition . By 2010, print versions had several reprints, with the expanded edition offered in  and dialects; around the same time, the work was made freely available as an electronic document through , the official Jiddu Krishnamurti online

Reception
The Library Journal stated in review,  insights are, as always, written in plain, nonsectarian language, and give perhaps the best picture we have today of the life of the spirit outside a strictly religious context.

Kirkus Reviews described it as  approachable, more intimate than Krishnamurti's didactic writings, this will  to all readers with a feeling for the mystery of existence"; however, London's Observer thought it better suited to those already familiar with Krishnamurti's life and 

Krishnamurti was interviewed about the work by Gerald Priestland for the BBC Radio 4 program Chapter and Verse, which reviewed books of a religious or spiritual nature; the interview and book review was broadcast on the evening of 

The Guardian (London) carried a sympathetic report about the book in  the article was not exclusively focused on the Notebook, also describing Krishnamurti's life and 

The reputed inner experiences as described in the diary and in Lutyens' biography aroused the interest of Krishnamurti's audiences. After their publication he was questioned by his listeners on the subject; he was generally dismissive of the importance of -related events, stating that all discussion of mystical experiences was trivial, and, although he continued alluding to -like states, he again avoided any 

The book continued to attract attention, and favorable mentions, in the following decades. In its obituary of Krishnamurti, The Times (London), described it as "a remarkable mystical document", while in 2006 the work was cited in a conference paper as  the most extensive documentation to date of a mystic's inner thoughts, perceptions, and
