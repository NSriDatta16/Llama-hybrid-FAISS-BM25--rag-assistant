is a Japanese light novel author. In 2000, his work Kino's Journey was a finalist for the 6th Dengeki Novel Prize, and was subsequently serialized in Dengeki hp magazine in March of the same year, marking his debut. Kino's Journey proved popular, and has continued in serialization (as well as collected bunko releases) since that time.

Sigsawa's name, a pen name, was derived from SIG Sauer, a firearms manufacturer, and "a manga hero", definitely Keiichi Morisato from Oh My Goddess!, according to the afterword in the second volume of Gakuen Kino. He loves to travel, ride his motorcycle, and is a self-professed "gun maniac". He mentions Galaxy Express 999 and the works of Hayao Miyazaki as some of his primary influences.
