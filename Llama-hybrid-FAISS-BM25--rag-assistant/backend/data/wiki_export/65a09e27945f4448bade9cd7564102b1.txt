On November 16, 2008, he began serving as a guest pastor at Crystal Cathedral in Orange County, California. His mentor, Robert H.

In March 2022, Maxwell visited a Christian conference called Conference for Life and the Family in Guatemala City, supported by Guatemala's president, Alejandro Giammattei. During a meeting with employers, he praised Guatemalan Attorney General, Maria Consuelo Porras, calling her "a rockstar" and a "leader of leaders".
