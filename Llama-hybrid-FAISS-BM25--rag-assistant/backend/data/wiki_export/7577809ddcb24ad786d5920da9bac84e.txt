Potomac and Rappahannock Transportation Commission (PRTC) is an American public transportation system in Prince William County, Virginia, Stafford County, Virginia, and Spotsylvania County, Virginia, plus two adjacent independent cities, Manassas and Manassas Park. Services provided by PRTC include OmniRide, OmniRide Local, and OmniRide Ridesharing Service operating in Prince William County, Manassas, Manassas Park, and Stafford County. Spotsylvania County's membership is solely based on a membership requirement due to the VRE operations in the county and the state aid that comes with the VRE. In , the system had a ridership of , or about  per weekday as of .

Organization
The Commission was established in 1986.  It consists of representatives from each local jurisdiction, the Chairman of the Commonwealth Transportation Board and two members of the House of Delegates and one member of the Senate from the related legislative districts. Together with the Northern Virginia Transportation Commission PRTC operates the Virginia Railway Express. By 1986, it became apparent that the jurisdictions outside of NVTC could not reach agreement on how to support VRE by joining NVTC so PRTC was created. Legislation established a 2% motor fuels tax to support VRE expenses and other transportation investments.

PRTC operates a carpooling and vanpooling project called "OmniRide Ridesharing Service" (formerly "OmniMatch").  PRTC participates in the SmarTrip rechargeable fare card program with other public transportation agencies.
