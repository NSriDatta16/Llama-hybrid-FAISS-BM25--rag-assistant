is a sequel to the games, anime, and manga franchise of Galaxy Angel, and is the continuation of BROCCOLI's Project G.A.. It features a brand new cast of Angels called the Rune Angel Troupe, and according to the game Galaxy Angel II: Zettai Ryōiki no Tobira, is set 4 years after the end of the previous game, Galaxy Angel: Eternal Lovers.

In this sequel, due to the development of a method to cross-dimensions at the end of Galaxy Angel: Eternal Lovers, a new dimension called NEUE was discovered, which is linked to EDEN through a space called ABSOLUTE, a central hub to which all dimensions are linked. This hub cannot be operated by most people however, and currently, the only person who can is the Moon Angel Troupe's Milfeulle Sakuraba. Since the operation of the hub involves opening gates between different dimensions, those with the ability to do so are called "gate keepers". The new Rune Angel Troupe features Emblem Frames from NEUE and is the successor to the now disbanded Moon Angel Troupe.

Manga

Several years have passed since Milfeulle Sakuraba and the other lovely ladies of the Angel Troupe finally defeated Eonia's forces in EDEN. A new galaxy called NEUE is found, and though the troupe has officially disbanded, each of the former members works for the expansion into NEUE. Milfeulle is now the lone gatekeeper of the intergalactic "gate" that connects EDEN and NEUE. It's rumored that other gates and gatekeepers exist, and a new troupe has formed to hunt them down. Led by Kazuya Shiranami, the first male Angel, and Milfeulle's younger sister Apricot, the Rune Angel Troupe prepares for the mission to connect the two dimensions.

Due to Broccoli Books closing its doors in 2008, volumes 4-6 were never released in America.
