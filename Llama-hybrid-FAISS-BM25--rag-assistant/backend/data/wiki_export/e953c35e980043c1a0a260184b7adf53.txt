The Dell Technologies Championship, originally the Deutsche Bank Championship, was a professional golf tournament on the PGA Tour that was played annually from 2003 to 2018. It was held in Norton, Massachusetts, United States, over the Labor Day weekend in late summer.

In 2007, the PGA Tour introduced the FedEx Cup and the Deutsche Bank Championship became one of four playoff events. The 2018 edition was the last time the event was staged as the FedEx Cup playoffs were reduced to three events the following season.

History
Replacing the Air Canada Championship in British Columbia on the tour schedule, the tournament made its debut in 2003 as the Deutsche Bank Championship. It was held at the Tournament Players Club of Boston in Norton, Massachusetts, south-southwest of Boston. Unlike most PGA Tour events which are played Thursday through Sunday, this tournament was played Friday through Monday, with the final round on Labor Day.

It became part of the first-year FedEx Cup playoffs in 2007, with its purse increased to $7 million. The purse in 2018 was $9.0 million, with a winner's share of $1.62 million. As the second of the four playoff events, its field was limited to the top 100 players on the FedEx Cup points list. Points were amassed during the PGA Tour's regular season and the first playoff event, The Northern Trust, which took place the previous week in the New York City area.

Deutsche Bank sponsored the first 14 editions of the tournament, through 2016. In 2017, Dell Technologies, which had a new subsidiary Dell EMC headquartered in Massachusetts, took over as the title sponsor of the tournament. The event was managed by the Tiger Woods Foundation from 2013 to 2016, after which it was managed by the PGA Tour.

Television
With the tournament's offset scheduling, Friday to Monday, network coverage has been over the final two scheduled rounds, Sunday and Monday; cable channels carry the Friday and Saturday rounds. The first network partner was ABC Sports from 2003 to 2006, though the 2006 event was covered under the "ESPN on ABC" banner. The event has been covered by NBC Sports from 2007 to 2018, though the 2011 and 2012 events were covered under the "Golf Channel on NBC" banner.
