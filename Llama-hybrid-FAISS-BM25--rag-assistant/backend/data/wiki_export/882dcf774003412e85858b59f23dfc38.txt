History
Construction on SR 212 began in 1930, routed between US 20 and US 12 along its modern route. The road opens in 1932 along its modern route. On August 10, 2007, officials of the INDOT abruptly closed the bridge on SR 212 which crosses the tracks of the South Shore Line, effectively closing the road as a bypass. The closure followed a routine inspection which found severe corrosion, resulting in the bridge receiving a lower rating than the I-35W Mississippi River bridge which collapsed on August 1, 2007. Removal of the old bridge was and construction of a new bridge began during February 2008. The construction of the new bridge was completed and the roadway reopened to traffic on June 12, 2008.
