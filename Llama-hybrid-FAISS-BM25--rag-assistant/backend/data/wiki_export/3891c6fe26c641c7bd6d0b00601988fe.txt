Honk! was an American comics magazine published in the 1980s by Fantagraphics Books, featuring creator interviews, reviews, satirical articles, and original comic strips. Similar in format to Mad magazine, but with an alternative/underground twist, Honk! was edited by Tom Mason (issues #1–3) and then Joe Sacco (issues #4–5).

The 52-page magazine-sized publication was published bimonthly from November 1986–July 1987.
