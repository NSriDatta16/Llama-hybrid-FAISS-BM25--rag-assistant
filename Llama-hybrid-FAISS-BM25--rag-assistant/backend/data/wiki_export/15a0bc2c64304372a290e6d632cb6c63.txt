History
Hundreds of years ago, most of the area consisted of fields and farmland area.

The Anglican Church

The Anglican church, more usually called Boulton St. Mary's, was built about the year 1150 by the Sacheverell family who were owners of the Manor of Boulton at that time. Following a long period of dispute the church became a chapel of ease in 1281 to St. Peter's in Derby, this being brought about by the ambitions of the all-powerful abbot of Darley Abbey. The church is now within the Diocese of Derby. The lychgate which forms the main entrance to the churchyard on Boulton Lane is a war memorial to those of the parish who gave their lives in the Great War of 1914 to 1919. The church has been altered and extended during its long history but still retains some of the original Norman fabric.

Nunsfield House

Nunsfield House, also on Boulton Lane, was built in 1828 by Mr Charles Holbrook and after subsequent owners and tenants it passed into the hands of Derbyshire County Council and later still (1996) to Derby City Council. The house is used for community purposes and in 1935 a community hall called the Jubilee Room was added. A small and cramped outbuilding was used as the local library for about 50 years and despite the difficult accommodation, the library was extremely popular. A modern library with computer terminals and Internet access is now available and located in the main Alvaston shopping centre.

Boulton Moor
Boulton Moor is an area of scrubland and agricultural fields on the edge of Boulton situated between Allenton, Chellaston, Thulston and Aston on Trent. A new housing estate has been built on Boulton Moor, which is now a distinct postal Dependent Locality.  Part of this area is outside the city boundary and is in the civil parish of Elvaston in South Derbyshire.

A Site of Special Scientific Interest known as Boulton Moor SSSI is situated in the agricultural land which borders the residential area of Boulton.
