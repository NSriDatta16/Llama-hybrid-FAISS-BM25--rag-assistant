Historical airline service

With the end of World War II, Douglas AAF was considered surplus to military needs and was transferred to local government authorities of the City of Douglas for conversion to a civilian airport. American Airlines served the airport as Bisbee/Douglas was a stop along a transcontinental multi-stop route. The carrier flew Douglas DC-3, Convair 240, and by 1952 Douglas DC-6 propliners with daily flights in each direction between the east coast and the west coast. In 1959 the westbound routing was New York Newark (EWR) – Philadelphia (PHL) – Washington D.C. (DCA) – Memphis (MEM) – Fort Worth (GSW) – El Paso (ELP) – Bisbee/Douglas (DUG) – Tucson (TUS) – Phoenix (PHX) – San Diego (SAN) – Los Angeles (LAX). By 1963, American was still serving the airport with two daily flights operated with the DC-6. The westbound routing was Dallas (DAL) – Midland/Odessa (MAF) – El Paso – Bisbee/Douglas – Tucson – Phoenix – San Diego – Los Angeles. American Airlines flights ended in 1965 and were replaced with commuter flights to Tucson and Phoenix provided by Apache Airlines using de Havilland Dove aircraft.

The original Frontier Airlines (1950-1986) briefly served Bisbee/Douglas in the early 1950s using DC-3s on flights to Phoenix, stopping at Nogales and Tucson, Arizona.

Apache Airlines service ended in 1970 and was followed by Cochise Airlines which served the airport from 1971 through 1975 using de Havilland Twin Otters.

Copper State Airlines provided service from 1980 through 1982 using Piper Navajos.

Sierra Vista Aviation was the final carrier at Bisbee/Douglas from 1983 through 1987 also using Piper Navajos.
