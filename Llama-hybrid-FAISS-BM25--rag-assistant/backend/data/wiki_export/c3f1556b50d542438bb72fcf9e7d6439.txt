Storytelling Giant is a 1988 compilation album of music videos by Talking Heads during the 1980s. The videos are linked by real people (not actors) telling stories from their lives; the stories have no logical connection to the videos.

The film has been released on VHS tape and 12" CD Video Laserdisc. A DVD version was released as part of Rhino's Once in a Lifetime box set, with three additional videos.
