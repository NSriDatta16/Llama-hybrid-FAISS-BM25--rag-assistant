Rapture is the first studio album by the Black metal band Dragonlord.

Though essentially a black metal album, much of Eric Peterson's thrash roots can still be heard, likening the sound that to the faster thrash style on Testament's "The Gathering" album mixed with symphonic black metal.  This is also the first time Peterson attempted vocals on any recordings.
