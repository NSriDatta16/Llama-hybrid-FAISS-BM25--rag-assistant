Masonic Children's Hospital 

M Health Fairview University of Minnesota Masonic Children's Hospital (formerly known as Amplatz Children's Hospital) is a non-profit pediatric acute care hospital located in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The hospital has 212 beds and is affiliated with University of Minnesota Medical School. The hospital provides comprehensive pediatric specialties and subspecialties to pediatric patients aged 0â€“21 throughout Minnesota and midwest United States. Masonic Children's Hospital is also a state designated Level III Trauma Center.

History
The medical center and University of Minnesota Children's Hospital, were created in 1997 as a result of the merger of the University of Minnesota Hospitals and Clinics with Fairview Health Services. In 2014, Children's Hospital was renamed University of Minnesota Masonic Children's Hospital in recognition of the financial support that Minnesota Masonic Charities has given the medical center over the past 60 years.  In 2018, the medical center announced a $111 million renovation and expansion project.

The hospital's merger with M Health Fairview was called into question when Fairview planned a merger with Sioux Falls-based Sanford Health. Having the flagship state institution for medical training operated by an out-of-state corporation with its own unranked medical school raised red flags both within the University medical community and the state government. Fairview agreed to spin off the University hospital in 2023, but as of March 18 it was uncertain whether it would be a charitable gift or a sale 

The world's first open heart surgery and the first bone marrow transplant were done at the University of Minnesota Medical Center.
