Structure
Residents of the state of Michigan at least 16 years of age are eligible for party membership; no financial contribution is required. Generally, a person is required to have been a member for at least 30 days before a convention, caucus or meeting to receive voting privileges.

Between state party conventions, the party is governed by the Democratic State Central Committee (DSCC). Delegates to the state central committee are elected at congressional district spring conventions in odd-numbered years. Each district is entitled to at least four delegates consisting of two men and two women, with additional members allocated by congressional district based on the proportion of its vote for the Democratic nominee for President or Secretary of State at the last general election held. Additional ex-officio with voting privileges include the Democratic National Committee members of the state and the officers of the DSCC. Any congressional district or county chairs having not been elected delegates also become DSCC ex-officio members, but without voting privileges.

The DSCC's officers are elected at the spring state convention in odd-numbered years by party members. Officers consists of a Chair, two Vice-Chairs one of each of a different gender and race, Secretary, Corresponding Secretary, Treasurer, and any additional officers as the convention deems proper. Current major officers for the DSCC include:

3rd Vice-Chair: Jonathan Kinloch
4th Vice-Chair: Chris Cracchiolo
