Royal High Corstorphine RFC is a former Edinburgh rugby union club, formed from the merger of the Royal HSFP and Corstorphine RFC. The merged club was dissolved in 2017 as two clubs:- Corstorphine Cougars and Royal HSFP.

History

Royal High Corstorphine was formed in 2003 from the merger of two Edinburgh rugby union sides:- Royal HSFP and Corstorphine RFC. RHC was originally planned as a bilateral club based both in Royal HSFP's Barnton ground and Corstorphine RFC's Union Park.

The club had a very successful women's side that produced several Scotland international players.

Dissolve of club

As time passed more and more matches were being played in Barnton; eventually the 1st XV playing in Barnton and the 2nd XV played in Union Park. This highlighted differences between the two factions on how a club should be run and the merged club was dissolved into two clubs.
