The high commissioner of the United Kingdom to Ghana is the United Kingdom's foremost diplomatic representative in the Republic of Ghana, and head of the UK's diplomatic mission in Ghana.

As fellow members of the Commonwealth of Nations, the United Kingdom and Ghana conduct their diplomatic relations at governmental level, rather than between heads of state. Therefore, the countries exchange high commissioners, rather than ambassadors.
