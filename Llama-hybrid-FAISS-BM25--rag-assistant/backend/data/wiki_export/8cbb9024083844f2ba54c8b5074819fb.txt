George Nelson Tremper High School is a high school located in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Part of the Kenosha Unified School District, it was named after George Nelson Tremper, the principal of Kenosha High School from 1911 to 1944. The mascot of Tremper High School is the Trojan.

History 
Built to relieve overcrowding at Bradford High School, the original  school was completed in the fall of 1964, with the first class graduating in June 1965.  A successful referendum in 2005 gave the school a new, larger field house, team locker rooms, and a new weight room.  In the summer of 2009, the cafeteria was remodeled and expanded into the original commons.  A 2015 referendum enabled the renovation of Ameche Field in the summer of 2017, including new bleachers and press box, a new track, and new team locker rooms, as well as enlargement of the tennis courts and turfing of the softball and baseball fields.

Controversies

Transgender Rights
In 2016, the school disallowed a transgender student from running for prom king, suggesting that he instead run for prom queen. The student initiated an online petition, and some of his schoolmates organized sit-ins, leading the Kenosha Unified School District to require the prom court ballot to list candidates "under the gender for which they identify". The school had also barred the student from using the boys' bathroom. The student filed a lawsuit against the school district with the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights, seeking to be able to use the boys' bathroom.

Sexual Harassment

In 2019, the ACLU filed a demand letter to Kenosha Unified School District regarding the treatment of cheerleaders at Tremper and Mary D. Bradford High School. The letter discussed awards given out for teenager cheer athletes at Tremper having large breasts, as well as coaches making commentary on their genitals and other sexual comments on their bodies.
