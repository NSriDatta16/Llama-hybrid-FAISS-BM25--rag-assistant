The 4th World Cup season began in December 1969 in France and concluded in March 1970 in Norway. Karl Schranz of Austria won his second consecutive overall title.  Michèle Jacot of France won the women's overall title.

For the final time, the results of the World Championships, held in 1970 in Val Gardena, Italy, were included in the World Cup standings (except for the Alpine Combined results, because that discipline was not recognized in the World Cup until the 1974/75 season).  Future Olympic and World Championship results were not included as World Cup races.

Malcolm Milne of Australia won the season's first downhill at Val d'Isère in December to become the first alpine racer from the Southern Hemisphere to win a World Cup event.
