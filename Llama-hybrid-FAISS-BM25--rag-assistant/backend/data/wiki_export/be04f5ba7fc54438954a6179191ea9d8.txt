Release
The film opened on 12 January 2007 to highly negative reviews from critics, with Sify.com  praising Ajith and Asin's performances but criticized the plot of the movie by labelling it as  a "built on a predictable premise" . Another critic described the film as "below average" citing that "the biggest drawback is that the story does not have a strong plot or surprising twists and that "there is also a palpable lack of chemistry between the characters and this gives the picture a poorly contrived feel." Rediff.com's review concluded that "Chella's directorial debut lacks originality and is a hotch potch of celebrated scripts of the past. Malini Mannath of Chennai Online wrote "With an absurd script, insipid narration, and with neither the role nor the performance working out here for him, it's like Ajith has lost whatever ground he'd gained with his splendid performance in 'Varalaru'". The film was a disaster at the box office.
