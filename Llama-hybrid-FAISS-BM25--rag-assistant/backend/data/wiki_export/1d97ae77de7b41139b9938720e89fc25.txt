History 
Settlers were recorded at Cap(e)lin Bay, what is now Calvert, as early as the 1670s.

Prior to January 30, 1922, Calvert was known as Caplin Bay, sometimes spelled Capelin Bay. It is said to have been named for the large number of capelin that were fished by its early settlers.  As several other Newfoundland communities had similar names, and in light of the necessities of the postal service, the Newfoundland Nomenclature Board, in the early 20th century, made efforts to reduce duplication of place names.  It responded favourably to a 1922 petition collected by the parish priest of Ferryland, Father Alfred Maher to change the name of the settlement in honour of Sir George Calvert, First Baron Baltimore, and founder, in the early seventeenth century, of the Colony of Avalon at what is now nearby Ferryland.

A book about the community was written by Gerald Pocius, titled "A Place to Belong: Community Order and Everyday Space in Calvert, Newfoundland".
