Pitching style
Logan threw with a sidearm delivery, making him appealing as a left-handed specialist. Left-handed hitters batted only .238 against him in his career, while righties hit .291. Logan was especially tough against lefties because his primary pitch was a slider in the low 80s that breaks sharply away from them. This was his favorite pitch to throw in two-strike counts. He also had a four-seam fastball and two-seam fastball that appeared in the 92-95 mph range. Logan also threw a high-80s changeup from time to time against right-handers.
