Open Hall-Red Cliffe is a local service district and designated place in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador.

History
Open Hall was settled around 1770 by Joseph Batt. Joseph Batt held a fishing room in Greenspond in 1769, however he moved from there to Open Hall in the next year. As a result, a nook in Open Hall Harbour arrived in his name, Joe Batts Cove.

It is likely that Open Hall was settled long before this date by French fishermen. However this was not recorded by British Authorities because of disputes over the territory. The original name of the settlement was Open Hole. This name was given by Dorset fishermen who colonized Bonavista Bay. Open Hole is translated from the French name " La Bonne Eau" which means Good Water.
