Traffic Gold is a two-disc 2005 compilation album by the psychedelic rock band Traffic. It contains at least one song from each album except On the Road, Far from Home, and The Last Great Traffic Jam.

Reception

Allmusic gave the compilation a positive review, commenting, "While previous Island collections like Feelin' Alright: The Very Best of Traffic and 20th Century Masters – The Millennium Collection dutifully cover the radio essentials, Gold provides both newbies and longtime fans with a fully stocked buffet of fan favorites and album highlights."
