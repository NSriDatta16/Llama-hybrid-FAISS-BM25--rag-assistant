Language of instruction
The language of instruction at the TEI is Greek. Therefore, a good knowledge of Greek is essential for regular students. However, special arrangements are made for a certain number of courses for Erasmus students who wish to follow regular courses. After consultation with the teaching staff, students can register for certain courses, must study from English literature, and will be given a separate examination at the end of the term. Additionally, a few courses are taught in English, and there are plans for more.

In 2016 the external evaluation committee gave Agricultural University of Athens a Positive evaluation.

An external evaluation of all academic departments in Greek universities was conducted by the Hellenic Quality Assurance and Accreditation Agency (HQA).
