Then presenter of Blue Peter Konnie Huq makes a cameo as a paratrooper who supervises Young on a slide from Tower Bridge whilst then pet Mabel appears throughout the video. One blooper occurs 35 seconds into the video when Young presents a homemade replica of Tracy Island. The model of FAB 1 shown is based on the 2004 live action incarnation even though the video is set in the 1970s.
