Song information
The song was performed in the semi-final, as Belgium had not qualified for the final at the . On the night, it was performed seventh, following 's Luiz Ejlli with "Zjarr e ftohtë" and preceding 's Brian Kennedy with "Every Song Is a Cry for Love". At the close of voting, it had received 69 points, with a maximum of 7 points given by , , and the , placing 12th out of 23 and missing the final – thus forcing that Belgium would have to qualify through the semi-final at their next appearance.

The song itself is a love song in a disco style, with Ryan expressing her love and occasionally lapsing into French to sing .

The performance was notable on the night for the neon-tubed microphone stands that Ryan variously sang and danced with, each being moved around by the backing dancers. Pre-contest publicity had credited Ryan with a strong song, however this was not borne out in voting. As a small consolation, the presenter charged with announcing the Belgian votes on the night of the final held up a cardboard sign with the words "We Love Kate Ryan" on it – prompting derisive comments from BBC commentator Terry Wogan, who during the contest said the song sounded like "shut that door" instead of je t'adore.
