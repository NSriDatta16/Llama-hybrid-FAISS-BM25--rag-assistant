History
The reason for European settlement here was the building of a chapel in honor of Santa Luzia.  The first name was Malhador (cattle tamer), because of the existence of a man with that profession.  Later the name was changed to Biscoito Duro (Hard Cookie), because of a popular sweet sought after in the local general store.  In 1958 it became a district of Guapó with the name Aragoiânia, a combination of Araguaia and Goiânia.  It was dismembered from Guapó and Hidrolândia in 1958 to become a municipality.
