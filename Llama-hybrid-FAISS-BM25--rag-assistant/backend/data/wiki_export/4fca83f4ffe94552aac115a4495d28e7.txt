On 1 January 1964, the neighboring municipalities of Hølonda (population: 1,428), Horg (population: 2,560), Flå (population: 843), Melhus (population: 3,978), and the Langørgen farm (population: 11) in Buvik were all merged to form a new, larger municipality of Melhus.

Name
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old Horg farm () since the first Horg Church was built there. The name comes from the word  which is the name for an "altar" or "cairn", so the site was likely an important site for the Old Norse religion.

Government
While it existed, this municipality was responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment, social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads. During its existence, this municipality was governed by a municipal council of elected representatives, which in turn elected a mayor.
