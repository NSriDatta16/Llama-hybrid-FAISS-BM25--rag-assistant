Brush Script is a casual connecting script typeface designed in 1942 by Robert E. Smith for the American Type Founders (ATF). The face exhibits an exuberant graphic stroke emulating the look of handwritten written letters with an ink brush. Lowercase letters are deliberately irregular to further effect the look of handwritten text. The typeface was introduced in 1942 and saw near immediate success with advertisers, retailers, and in posters. Its popularity continued through the 1950s, and waned as influence of the International Typographic Style grew in the 1960s. The typeface has regained considerable popularity for its nostalgic association with the post WW2 era.

Along with Dom Casual and Mistral, it is one of the best-known casual script typefaces.

Reception
Brush Script was named #3 in "Least Favorite" nomination in 2007 designers' survey, conducted by Anthony Cahalan. "Least Favorite" is defined as "misused or overused", "ugly", "boring, dated, impractical or clich√©d", "dislike or blind hatred".

Brush Script was rated #5 in "The 8 Worst Fonts In The World" list in Simon Garfield's 2010 book Just My Type.
