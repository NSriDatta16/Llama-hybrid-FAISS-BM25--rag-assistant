Biography 
He was born in L'Assomption, Lower Canada (now Quebec) on January 15, 1836, son of Amable Jette and Caroline Goffreau. After receiving a classical education at the Collège de L’Assomption, he studied law at the Collège Sainte-Marie, before being called to the bar in 1857. He then practiced law in Montreal, notably participating in the Guibord case.

A Liberal, he was elected to the House of Commons of Canada representing the riding of Montreal East in 1872, defeating Sir George-Étienne Cartier. He was re-elected in 1874. In 1878, he left politics and became a judge of the Superior Court of Quebec; the same year, he joined the law faculty of the newly-established Université Laval in Montreal (later the Université de Montréal).

From 1898 to 1908 he was the lieutenant governor of Quebec. He was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) during the visit to Quebec of the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York (later King George V and Queen Mary) in October 1901. He served as lieutenant governor until 1908, when he returned to the Superior Court bench, becoming chief justice of the Court of King's Bench in 1909. He retired from judicial service in 1911.

He was entombed at the Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery in Montreal.
