Non-film career 
P. Bhaskaran started to write songs for communist stage performers. His songs were banned in the (then) State of Travancore. His first collection of poems was released under the title Villali. During the Communist Rebellion in Punnapra-Vayalar, he wrote a song titled Vayalar Garjikkunnu (Vayalar Roars) under the pen name Ravi. The song, starting with the lines Uyarum Njan Nadake... rose to legendary stature in the days to come, during which the song was banned and he was expatriated from the (then) State of Travancore as per the orders of Dewan C. P. Ramaswami Iyer. Then he went to Chennai (then Madras) to join the editorial board of the Jayakeralam. He used to write songs for Akashavani, which helped him secure a job in Kozhikode Akashvani. In the 1950s, he got associated with the film industry. He quit his job in Akashavani and went to Chennai to start a full-time film career. The lyrics for the theme song of the Malayalam channel Asianet, starting Shyama Sundara was also written by him.

Film career 
P. Bhaskaran's debut as a lyricist was for a Tamil film. He wrote the Malayalam lines for a multi-lingual song in film Apoorva Sagodharargal (1949). The first Malayalam film song for which he wrote lyrics was "Madhumadhuri..." for the film Chandrika (1950). He worked with the director P. Venu in his films Viruthan Shanku (1968), Virunnukari (1969), and Ariyapedatha Rahasiyam (1981) and produced some evergreen songs.

In 1954, Bhaskaran along with Ramu Kariat directed the film Neelakkuyil. The movie is regarded as ushering in social realism in Malayalam cinema. It got the President's silver medal, the first-ever national recognition for a Malayalam film. Two years later, he did his first solo work, titled Rarichan Enna Pouran. It failed at the box office. His films  Adyakiranangal (1964), Iruttinte Athmavu (1969), and Thurakkatha Vathil (1971) went on to win National Film Awards for various categories.
