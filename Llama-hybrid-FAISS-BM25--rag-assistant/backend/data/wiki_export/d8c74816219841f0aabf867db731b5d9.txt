Marlin made his NASCAR debut in 2000 at Nashville Fairgrounds, driving for Felix Sabates' No. 42 Bellsouth Chevrolet. He only managed a start in the 42nd position in a grid of 43. Marlin finished in 30th-place finish, after being involved with 20 other cars in a late-race crash. Marlin then ran eight races in 2001, running for the Sadler Bros' No. 95 Shoney's Ford. His best run was a 19th at Michigan, and had two other top-25 finishes. One of the seven races was for the No. 54 General Creation Chevy, where he crashed to a 42nd place at Memphis Motorsports Park.  Marlin made six more starts in 2002, driving for the Sadler Brothers. His best run was at Kentucky Speedway, where he led his first career laps (7), before late race problems led him to 22nd. In his other five starts, Marlin finished no worse than 30th.

In 2003, Marlin ran seven races in the No. 30 Keystone/Express Personnel Dodge for Braun Racing. His best run in his career was a 15th at California. He also tacked a pair of 24th-place finishes.
