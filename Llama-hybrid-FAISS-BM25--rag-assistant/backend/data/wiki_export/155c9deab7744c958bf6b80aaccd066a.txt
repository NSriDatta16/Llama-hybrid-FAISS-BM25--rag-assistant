Chittaranjan Avenue, more commonly C.R. Avenue (Formerly Central Avenue), a principal north-south thoroughfare in Central-North Kolkata. It starts from Beadon Street (Dani Ghosh Sarani/Abhedananda Road) crossing (Girish Park) in the north and ends at Chowringhee Road-Bentinck Street Junction (Esplanade) in the south. The road is renamed after Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das, a nationalist politician and freedom-fighter of India. North of Beadon Street crossing, Chittaranjan Avenue becomes Jatindra Mohan Avenue.

Significance

The road is arterial in maintaining north to central and vice versa connection in Kolkata. The road remains always busy. A major portion of the Kolkata Metro Line 1 runs beneath this road. Several important places are on this road, including Beadon Street crossing, Girish Park, Vivekananda Road crossing, Jorasanko, Mahajati Sadan, MG Road crossing, Kolkata Medical College, All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, Bowbazar, Khirode Vidya Binode Avenue-Dr. Lalit Banerjee Sarani crossing, B.B. Ganguly Street crossing, Ganesh Chandra Avenue crossing, Chandni Chowk and Esplanade.
This thoroughfare (earlier known as the 'Central Avenue') was built by the Calcutta Improvement Trust during the inter-war period. The process included massive displacement of populations in the central city. Social dislocations during the street-building process found expression in contemporary urban conflicts.
