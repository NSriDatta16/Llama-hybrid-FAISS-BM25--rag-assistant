The Asia Fashion Exchange (AFX) is an annual fashion festival held in Singapore between 2001 and 2015. It began in 2001 as the Singapore Fashion Festival and was conceived by the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) with the goal of positioning Singapore as a fashion capital within Southeast Asia. The festival was eventually relaunched as the Asia Fashion Exchange in 2010 as a joint initiative between the private and public sector, and features a variety of fashion-related events.

The flagship event of the Asia Fashion Exchange is the Audi Fashion Festival Singapore. In 2015, Audi Fashion Festival Singapore was rebranded as Singapore Fashion Week and it was the last year that the Asia Fashion Exchange was marketed as its parent event.

2001 - 2008: Singapore Fashion Festival 
AFX began as Singapore Fashion Festival, an annual two-week long consumer-driven event that took place between 2001 and 2008. It was supported by the Singapore Tourism Board (STB), which aimed to position Singapore as a fashion capital within Southeast Asia.  The event consisted of showcases by international and local designers, exhibitions and fashion-related fringe events. The event was organized by MS Twilight, an events management company, from 2001 to 2003. In 2004, Mercury Marketing and Communications, now a fully integrated communications agency, won the contract to organize the Singapore Fashion Festival.

The first Singapore Fashion Festival in 2001 hoped to present high fashion in a “fun and entertaining way” to consumers. It saw big names in high fashion such as Kenzo and Christian Dior presenting their collections. Zouk’s carpark was converted into a fashion catwalk for labels like Armani Exchange, Blackjack and Island Shop to showcase their collections.

2006 Singapore Fashion Festival

The 2006 Festival was a ten-day event held from 24 March to 2 April 2006. It was considered the best fashion festival for both international and local designers in Singapore. The most anticipated model taking the catwalk at this year's festival was British supermodel, Lily Cole.

The festival was located in a tent at Ngee Ann City, on Orchard Road. More than 30 brands signed up, with most of them displaying their spring-summer designs, and with some displaying their autumn-winter designs. The collections on display were also sold at the event.

In addition to the catwalks, MTV's Fashionably Loud, performed at Ngee Ann City. Featured in the performance was UK's rock favorites Placebo who performed a mixture of old hits and new tracks from their upcoming new album Meds. They were also accompanied by a variety of fashion labels showcasing designs inspired by "Rock Resurrection" portraying themes of destruction, renewal, grief, and joy.
