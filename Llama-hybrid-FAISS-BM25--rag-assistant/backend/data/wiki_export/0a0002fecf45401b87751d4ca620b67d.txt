Recorded Live: The 12 Year Old Genius is the first live album by Little Stevie Wonder. The album was released on the Tamla record label (catalog #240) in May 1963, the same month as the single release of "Fingertips" (catalog #54080). "Fingertips" topped both the Billboard Hot 100 chart and the R&B Singles chart, and Recorded Live: The 12 Year Old Genius topped the Billboard 200, all of which happened in 1963. This is the last album to use the "Little" in Stevie Wonder's name. Starting with the next album, he would go by just "Stevie Wonder." Wonder was the second and youngest solo artist to chart on the Billboard Top LPs under the age of 18. He was only 13 years old when that occurred.
