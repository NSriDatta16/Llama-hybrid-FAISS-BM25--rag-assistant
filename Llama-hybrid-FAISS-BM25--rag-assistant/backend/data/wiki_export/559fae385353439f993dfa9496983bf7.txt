History 
Dunglady fort is a Ringfort located less than a mile from the village of Culnady variously dated from around 100 AD, to as early as 2000 BC.It is 110m in diameter with three banks and three ditches (up to 5m. deep) with a straight entrance. A legendary home of the Celtic Kings, it is the earliest known instance of residence in the Culnady area. The fort was occupied by tribes during the earliest periods of Irish history, until the arrival of the plantations (c.17th century) in Ireland, at which time settlers began to live in the low-lying areas surrounding the Clady river, using it for farming, and thus the village of Culnady was born.
