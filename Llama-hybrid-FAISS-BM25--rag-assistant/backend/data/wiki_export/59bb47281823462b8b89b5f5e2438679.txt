George Franklin "Paddy" Patterson (May 22, 1906 – January 20, 1977) was a professional ice hockey winger who played nine seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL). He was born in Kingston, Ontario.

As an NHL rookie, George scored the first goal for the newly named Toronto Maple Leafs in 1926–27. He was also a member of the following teams: the Montreal Canadiens, New York Americans, Boston Bruins, Detroit Red Wings, and St. Louis Eagles.

Patterson later coached senior ice hockey in Kingston. In 1951, Ontario Hockey Association executives Jack Roxburgh,  George Dudley, Frank Buckland and W. A. Hewitt, handed out a lifetime suspension to Patterson, for conspiring to deliberately lose a playoff series to avoid moving into a higher-level of playoffs, rather than staying in a lower level and potentially make more profits at home playoff games than on the road.
