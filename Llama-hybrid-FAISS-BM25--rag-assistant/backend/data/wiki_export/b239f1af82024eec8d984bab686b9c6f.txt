This is a list in both Italian and Friulian language of place names in the historical area of Friuli, Italy, with the official spelling standard published by ARLeF - Regional Agency for the Friulian Language in 2009.  Grave accents ( ` ) on the Friulian forms are to show syllable stress but are rarely written except when placed on the ultimate syllable.  Italics are used for the names of municipalities that are not included within the area subject to protection of the Friulian language minority. These names are divided according to the former Italian province in which they lay.  From the historical point of view, both the Italian and Friulian forms are found in medieval documents. In some cases, though, Italian names were created by the fascist regime to Italianise the region.
