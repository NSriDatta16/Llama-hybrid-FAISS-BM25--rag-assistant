The Classic Marvel Figurine Collection is a magazine series published by Eaglemoss Publications from 2005 to 2012, through which consumers can collect hand-painted lead figurines of the Marvel Comics characters. The figurines are produced at a 1:21 scale, so that regular figurines have a height around . Bigger figurines are also produced: bulky characters like the Hulk are considered as Specials while giant characters like Galactus are called Mega Specials. Double Packs consisting of two figurines of related characters have also been released.

The collection have been released in various countries such as Australia, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy, Greece, France, South Africa, Spain, Brazil, Poland and the USA. Confusingly not all areas have seen the characters released in the same order. For example, depending on area, #8 features the Green Goblin or Daredevil.

Subscribers receive three other pieces of memorabilia and also special issues throughout the year. The online service, based in the United Kingdom, prohibits the items to be sold to American buyers, however the figures can be obtained through several comic book speciality stores in the United States. The collection ended with issue 200.
