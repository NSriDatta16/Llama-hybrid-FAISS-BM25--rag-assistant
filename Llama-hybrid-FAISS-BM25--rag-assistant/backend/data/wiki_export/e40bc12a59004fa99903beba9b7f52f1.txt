The original 7 World Trade Center (7 WTC) was a 47-story building, designed by Emery Roth & Sons, with a red granite facade. The building was  tall, with a trapezoidal footprint that was  long and  wide. Tishman Realty & Construction managed construction of the building. The ground-breaking ceremony was hosted on October 2, 1984. The building opened in May 1987, becoming the seventh structure of the World Trade Center.

 Trade Center was  tall, clad in red granite masonry, and occupied a trapezoidal footprint. An elevated walkway spanning Vesey Street connected the building to the World Trade Center plaza.

On September 11, 2001, the structure was substantially damaged by debris when the nearby North Tower of the World Trade Center collapsed, gutting the face facing the North Tower. The debris ignited fires on multiple lower floors of the building, which continued to burn uncontrolled throughout the afternoon. The building's internal fire suppression system lacked water pressure to fight the fires. The collapse began when a critical internal column buckled and triggered cascading failure of nearby columns throughout, which was first visible from the exterior with the crumbling of a rooftop penthouse structure at 5:20:33Â pm. This initiated progressive collapse of the entire building at , according to FEMA, while the 2008 NIST study placed the final collapse time at . The collapse made 7 World Trade Center the first steel skyscraper known to have collapsed primarily due to uncontrolled fires.

Construction of a new 7 World Trade Center was started in 2002 and completed in 2006.
