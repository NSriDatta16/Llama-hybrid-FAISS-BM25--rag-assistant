The Renault Mégane Renault Sport (alternatively Renault Mégane RS) is a series of high-performance hatchback models based on the Renault Mégane, produced since 2004 by the high-performance subsidiary company Renault Sport for its parent company Alpine, a subsidiary of Renault. The Mégane RS won awards such as "Best hot hatch" from What car? (2010–2014), "Highest placed non-supercar" in Evo's annual Car of the Year test 2011 and "Best hot hatch" from Top Gear.

Mégane Renault Sport I (based on Second generation Mégane; 2004–2009) 

The first generation Mégane RS was introduced in September 2004 and is based on the Renault Mégane II small family car. The Mégane II RS was available in three-door and five-door hatchback versions, both with the same engine and was built at Renault's Dieppe factory by using body shells made in Palencia, Spain. The Mégane Renault Sport 225 uses double-axis strut suspension with independent steering axis at the front and an electric power steering.

Engine and performance
The RS uses a turbocharged 2.0-litre petrol engine that produces , allowing the car to achieve 0–100 km/h in 6.5 seconds (0–60 mph in 6.5  seconds), with a top speed of about . Ninety percent of the engine's torque is available from 2,000 rpm until redline. A twin-scroll turbocharger minimizes turbo lag, especially when throttle is applied at over 2,000 rpm. The turbocharge functions at 1,800 rpm. The transmission is a six-speed manual. Renault's claimed combined economy is .

In a 2004 road test by Mexican car magazine Automóvil Panamericano, the engine developed a peak output of .

Equipment
The Mégane Renault Sport has a speed-limiter, which prevents the car from passing a user-determined speed. It can be disabled or recalled with a button-press, and is set in the same way as the cruise control.

Mégane R.S. 265 Trophy (2011)
In June 2011, Renault Sport unveiled a limited edition variant of the Mégane III R.S. called the Mégane R.S. 265 Trophy. The Megane R.S. 265 Trophy uses the same 2.0-litre four-cylinder engine as the standard R.S. but due to modifications such as a new air intake and higher turbo pressure (from ) it gains an extra 15 hp, increasing the power output to  and  of torque. The car can accelerate from 0–100 km/h in six seconds and goes on to a top speed of 254 km/h (157 mph). It is recognizable from a model-specific decoration such as Trophy stickers on the doors, a new spoiler and specific 19″ rims with R.S. center caps.  It comes in a model-specific metallic yellow (Jaune Sirius) but is also available in more low-key colors such as white (Blanc Glacier), black (Noir Étoilé) and gray (Gris Cassiopée).

The Mégane R.S. 265 Trophy set a Nurburgring laptime of 8 minutes and 8 seconds, beating the record previously held by the Mégane R26.R by 9 seconds.

Production was limited to 500 units.

Renault Sport Mégane R.S. 265 (2012–2013) 

Renault introduced the updates on the Trophy model to the standard Megane R.S. in 2011 replacing the Mégane R.S. 250. The car was a result of Renault winning a tender from the Gendarmerie National for a new high speed pursuit vehicle with a power output requirement of 261 bhp. In addition to supplying the updated car to the police, Renault introduced it for the general public as well.

The car retained the updated engine from the Trophy version rated at  and offers the same "Cup" and "Sport" versions like the Mégane R.S. model. Changes include Piano Black interior highlights and wider LED daytime running lights with 6 LEDs per side rather than the 3 LEDs found in the RS250. The 18" wheels were changed to a new design called "Tibor", while the 19" wheels carried over from the 250. Extreme Blue and Sport Yellow were dropped as colour options.

The new exterior package introduced on the 265 was the  'Red Design Pack' which includes red striping on front blade, rear diffuser and side protection mouldings, rear parking camera with front parking sensors, Visio System lane departure warning and auto high/low beam headlights.

The Cup Chassis Pack available on the 265 consists of 18-inch matt black alloys with 235/40 R18 95Y Michelin Sport 2 tyres, slotted brake discs, limited slip differential, red brake calipers, stiffer springs/dampers and anti-roll bars.

In Australia, the Cup and Cup Trophée models were replaced with the Cup, Cup+ and Trophy+ with slightly more flexible specification levels.

Red Bull RB7 and RB8 Edition (2012–2013) 

The Red Bull RB7 and RB8 Editions were based on the Mégane R.S. 265 Cup trim and was unveiled in 2012 and 2013 respectively to celebrate the wins of the Renault Red Bull F1 team. The models featured various optional equipment as standard along with unique Etoilé Black body colour (for the RB7) with yellow trim pieces and Twilight Blue exterior colour with silver trim pieces (for the RB8).

Facelift (2014–2017) 

The Mégane R.S. received a facelift in 2014 featuring design cues from the rest of the Renault lineup at the time. Exterior changes include a new front grille with a pronounced Renault badge, revised front and rear bumpers, revised headlights and a new hood. The car was only available in a single trim with an optional cup chassis package which included limited slip differential and a firmer suspension setup. Interior updates included Renault's R-Link infotainment system which was criticised for its joystick control. No mechanical changes were made in the facelift.

Renault Sport Mégane 275 Trophy & Trophy-R (2014–2017) 

In response to SEAT setting a new record for a Front-wheel drive production car at the Nürburgring race track with the Leon Cupra 280 at 7:58.4, Renault developed the 275 Trophy-R to retake the title a few weeks after. With Laurent Hurgon driving, the record was reclaimed with a Nürburgring lap time of 7:54.36. The Mégane R.S. 275 Trophy-R features an Akrapovič titanium exhaust system increasing the power output to 271 bhp (201 kW; 273 PS) at 5,500 rpm while the torque is unchanged at  at 3,000 rpm. Other changes include Öhlins dampers with Allevard composite coil springs and 19-inch Speedline Turini wheels with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tyres. A lithium battery results in additional weight saving of 16 kg. The front brakes are changed to a 350mm 2 piece floating rotor (up 10mm) while using the same calipers and rear brakes. On the interior, the sound deadening is removed, as well as the air conditioning, stereo, sat nav and back seats in place of which a rear brace is fitted in place. The front seats are Recaro "pole position" fixed polycarbonate bucket seats trimmed with leather and Alcantara with Sabelt race harness belts fitted. The total weight saving of all the changes amounts to a  loss, bringing kerb weight down to ,  and 174 g/km of CO2/km. The Mégane R.S. 275 Trophy-R also set new track records of several others circuits such as the Suzuka circuit, Fuji International Speedway and the Tsukuba circuit.

Variants

Motorsports

Mégane Trophy 

The Mégane Trophy based on the second generation Mégane R.S. Trophy was unveiled in 2009, sharing only visual appearance with its road legal counterpart. The car was destined to compete in the European Mégane Trophy race series for privateer race teams.

The Trophy features a composite body with a space frame chassis and a mid-mounted 3.5-litre Nissan-Renault V6 engine rated at  and  mated to a 6-speed sequential transmission driving the rear wheels. The suspension system has full adjustable dampers. The only resemblance to the road car are the headlights and taillights along with the windscreens. The composite body and other weight saving measures result in a dry weight of .

Mégane Renault Sport III (based on Fourth generation Mégane; 2017) 

The third generation of the Renault Megane R.S. is based on the 4th generation of the Mégane and was introduced at the 2017 Frankfurt Motor Show. It is available in 3 trims: 280-Sport, 280-Cup and 300-Trophy. The Mégane R.S. is only available in 5-door hatchback bodystyle and was developed with the assistance of Renault F1 team driver Nico Hulkenberg.

All feature a similar turbocharged 1.8-litre inline-4 engine (to a varying rate of tune) shared with the Alpine A110, and as standard a four-wheel steering system to improve handling, though this was removed to save weight in the Trophy-R. Five selectable drive-modes are available, namely Comfort, Neutral, Sport, Race and Personal (which is a customisable driving mode).

The gearbox choices are either a 6-speed manual gearbox or a 6-speed Efficient Dual Clutch (EDC) gearbox with paddle shifters and launch control (which can be activated by holding both of the shifter paddles).

The interior features a portrait style infotainment system and red graphical display on the digital tachometer flanked by analogue fuel and water temperature gauges. The infotainment system supports AppleCarPlay and Android Auto. An engine revving sound is played through the speakers when the driver opens the door of the car. Red stitching with RS badges are standard on the interior and the Trophy model adds an Alcantara-suede trim on the steering wheel. Recaro sports seats are optional equipment. Buyers have the choice to have a carbon fibre weave or an Alcantara trim.

The suspension system has struts up front and a torsion beam at the rear, but its front configuration has new geometry and retains Renault Sport's PerfoHub technology, which reduces kingpin angle offset and resists torque and bump steer. The system uses fluid-filled shock absorbers commonly found on rally cars on the lower end of the suspension struts and is called a damper within a damper system by the manufacturer.

The entry-level 280 Sport, features a torque-vectoring system of braking the inner wheels during a turn, to further improve turn-in; and a passive double damping suspension system.

The 280 Cup trim is similar to the 280 Sport trim, but adds a mechanical Torsen limited-slip-differential to the front wheels along with a 10% stiffer suspension setup. 19-inch wheels with Bridgestone tyres and lightweight brakes with aluminium hubs and red calipers are optional.

The 300 Trophy is similar to the 280 Cup, but has even firmer suspension, a lightweight DESS (Dual-Energy Storage System) battery, a different cylinder head and turbocharger with a higher-performance engine tune for more power (221 kw). Torque figure is increased to 420 NM (400 NM for cars with a manual gearbox).

4-wheel steering 
A four-wheel steering system called the "4Control" is standard on the Mégane RS which uses electronic actuators to turn the rear wheels synchronised with the front wheels.

Depending on the speed, the system may turn the rear wheels up to 2.7 degrees in the opposite direction to the front wheels or can turn the rear wheels up to 1 degree in the same direction as the front wheels.

Changeover happens at 60 km/h (37 mph) in Normal driving (all modes other than Race). The rear wheels are turned in the opposite direction to the front at up to 60 km/h (37 mph) and makes a tighter turning circle. When the speedo swings past 60, they turn in the same direction as the fronts to virtually extend the wheelbase for better motorway driving stability.

In Race mode, changeover happens at a much higher 100 km/h (62 mph) allowing tighter cornering at higher speeds.

Facelift (2021)
In 2020, the facelifted Megane RS was introduced for the 2021 model year.

The trim levels were revised and the 280-Sport model was removed, bringing the engine power output to  for all facelifted Megane RS models. Buyers could choose between the 300-Sport and the 300-Trophy, equipped similarly to the pre-facelift models.

On the outside, the facelifted Megane RS came with new LED headlights and different-looking taillights. Inside, the instrument panel was now fully digital and the infotainment system used a new software. The climate controls were also changed and now featured separate temperature displays on the temperature control dials. The ambient lighting was removed from the rear door cards.
