"Sí, se puede" (Spanish for "Yes, it is possible" or, roughly, "Yes, we can"; ) is the motto of the United Farm Workers of America, and has since been taken up by other activist groups. In 1972, during César Chávez's 25-day fast in Phoenix, Arizona, UFW's co-founder, Dolores Huerta, came up with the slogan. "Sí se puede" has long been a UFW guiding principle that has served to inspire accomplishment of goals.  The phrase is a federally registered trademark of the UFW.

The phrase has been widely adopted by other labor unions and civil rights organizations and drew widespread political and media attention as a rallying cry during the U.S. immigration reform protests.

AeroMexico's trademark application
After AeroMexico, a Mexican airline, had filed a trademark application for "Sí se puede" with the US Trademark Office, lawyers for the United Farm Workers defended the phrase as the intellectual property of the UFW. After litigation, AeroMexico agreed not to use the phrase and abandoned its trademark application.
