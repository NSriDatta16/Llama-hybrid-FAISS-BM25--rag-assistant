For this reissue, Rhino chose to include the non-album single track "Can I Get to Know You Better" in place of "Let Me Be", which had already appeared on the first Turtles album. This change, of course, necessitated an alteration to the front cover artwork, which on the original 1966 LP prominently showcased the inclusion of "Let Me Be".
