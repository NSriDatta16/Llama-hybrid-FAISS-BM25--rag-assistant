Shrutakirti () is a princess featured in the Hindu epic Ramayana. She is the daughter of King Kushadhvaja and queen Chandrabhaga. She is the wife of Shatrughna, the younger brother of Rama. Shrutakirti is considered to be an incarnation of the disc of the goddess Lakshmi.

Legend 
Shrutakirti is the younger daughter of King Kushadhvaja. Shrutakirti's elder sister, Mandavi, is married to Bharata.

Shrutakirti is married to Ayodhya's king Dasharatha's fourth and youngest son, Shatrughna. They have two sons, Subahu and Shatrughati. Later, Shrutakirti became the queen of Madhupura (Mathura) when her husband Shatrughna captured the capital after killing Lavanasura. Shatrughna came to her every night, worried about his every inexperienced decision regarding the kingdom, and confided in her. She acted as an advisor to her husband.

Shrutakirti is regarded to be an aspect of Lakshmi, merging with the goddess following the death. According to the Tulsidas' Ramcharitmanas, Mandavi and Shrutakirti performed the practice of sati and immolated themselves on their husbands' funeral pyres.

Worship
In the Medak district of Telangana, there is a temple called Sri Kalyana Ramachandra Sannadhi that is dedicated to Shatrughna and Shrutakirti. This temple is the only one in India that has installed statues of Rama's brothers and their wives.
