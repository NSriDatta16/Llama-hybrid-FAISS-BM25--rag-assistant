History

The Hot Lies formed in early 2004 as an alternative rock band in Adelaide with three former members of The Killchoir Project: Jared Brown on drums, Benjamin Pix on rhythm guitar and Wolfgang Sapsford on lead vocals; they were joined by Leaton Rose (ex-I Killed the Prom Queen) on bass guitar and Josh Delsar (ex-Day of Contempt) on lead guitar. They released a demo, "Bulletholes and Blacklines": it was home-recorded, and was put on high rotation by national radio broadcaster, Triple J, in March 2004.

In August 2004 they released an extended play, Streets Become Hallways, which spent 30+ weeks on the AIR Indie Charts, and later re-entered the charts at No. 17. The band toured supported Alexisonfire, After the Fall and 28 Days. Later the Hot Lies toured with Sum 41 and Yellowcard, and then with Good Charlotte and Kisschasy. Blunt magazine and Rolling Stone labelled them one of their bands to watch in 2005.

The Hot Lies released another five-track EP, Heart Attacks and Callous Acts (EP), in September 2005, which appeared in the top 40 on the ARIA Singles Chart. Heart Attacks yielded two music videos: "Promise Me" and "Tell Me Goodnight". It spent 40+ weeks on the Air Indie Charts and later returned there for another 14 weeks.  The EP was recorded, mixed and produced by renowned producer Kalju Tonuma.

Their single, "Emergency! Emergency!", was released in August 2007 a month ahead of their debut album, Ringing in the Sane. "Emergency! Emergency!" included the title song, and their cover version of "Time After Time", which was a crowd favourite, and an acoustic version of "Ghosts and Mirrors".

Ringing in the Sane received national radio airplay from 5ADL and Triple J. The album reached the top 40 on the ARIA Albums Chart. One review read "After two impressive build-up EP's, Adelaide's finest emo popstars, The Hot Lies finally unveiled their debut full-length to the world, making lovers of local pop-infused rock everywhere rejoice. Abandoning their harsher post-hardcore beginnings, the yelling and screaming was barely anywhere to be found amongst the minefield of infectious diseases that so easily sucked you in and but so tenaciously refused to let go. With their emphasis on stronger songs, Ringing in the Sane was an instant 'Lies classic." Ringing in the Sane provided two video clips, "Tokyo" and "Emergency! Emergency!" Both received regular airplay on TV music programme, Video Hits.

The group announced their split on their official website in December 2009, and then performed two final gigs in Adelaide in January 2010.
