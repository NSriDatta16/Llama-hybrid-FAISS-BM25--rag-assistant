History
WLCN-CD began broadcasting on June 12, 2009 under the ownership of Jen Rose Broadcasting. The station offered local news, weather, and sports programming along with syndicated programming from America One and My Family TV. After its conversion to digital, the station added Retro TV and Untamed Sports to its subchannels. WLCN produced local shows with emphasis on political, financial and spiritual support, as well as local sports such as South Carolina Stingrays ice hockey and Summerville High School Greenwave football.

On January 23, 2011, the station's previous owners, Faith Assembly of God of Summerville, sold the station to the Christian Television Network. The sale closed on January 23, 2012. Soon afterward, programming on WLCN switched to programming and services similar to other CTN stations.
