The Sörenstam family began playing golf at Viksjö Golf Club in Jakobsberg, north of Stockholm and later switched to nearby Bro-Bålsta Golf Club, opened in 1980, initially with a 9-hole course.

At the European Tour tournament Scandinavian Enterprise Open in Stockholm in July 1986, the Sörenstam sisters tried to be volunteer caddies and was asked to stand in a line with all other candidates. When all male volunteer caddies finally had been chosen by the tournament professionals, three teen-age girls were left without a bag yet. It was Charlotta, Annika and Fanny Sunesson.

At the end of 1996, she finished second at the LPGA Tour Final Qualifying Tournament to earn exempt status for 1997.
