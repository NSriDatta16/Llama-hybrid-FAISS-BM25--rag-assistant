United on March 14, 2006 for a 2007 draft pick. Mediate made seven starts for the D.C. reserves in 2006, scoring a goal and logging two assists. He had worked his way into United's first team, appearing in eight games with two starts (despite having to miss time due to a concussion) when his right leg (distal fibula) was broken in a game against Los Angeles Galaxy on August 8, 2006.
