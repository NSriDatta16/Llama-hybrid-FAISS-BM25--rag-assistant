John Oliver Secondary School is a public secondary school located in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, at East 41st Avenue and Fraser Street (between the Vancouver neighbourhoods of Kensington-Cedar Cottage, Riley Park-Little Mountain and Sunset). It is named after John Oliver, the Premier of British Columbia from 1918 to 1927. The school is composed of four main segments: the main building ("A" Building) containing the bulk of the learning areas, including the Auditorium and Learning Commons; a wooden building ("B" Building) affectionately nicknamed "The Barn", due to its appearance, which is closed but was previously used by the mini school and Digital Immersion students; a Drama Studio ("C" Building) which allows for several theatre and acting courses; and a concrete building — the engineering building — bisected by a breezeway, with automotive, metal, and wood shops.

Current 

John Oliver Secondary is a school of approximately 1150 students attending grades Eight to Twelve with nearly 70 teachers. The students participate in many extracurricular activities including Music, Sports and Clubs.
The school has a multicultural student population, with a large number of bilingual students. Although the predominant populations are reflective of the Indo and Filipino-Canadian neighbourhood it resides in, many other ethnic backgrounds are represented in the school's population.

History 
The school was originally called South Vancouver High School and began in 1912 as two surplus classrooms on the grounds of Lord Selkirk Elementary at 22nd Avenue and Commercial Street. The following year, when enrolment jumped from 58 to 148, the high school students moved to General Gordon School, which is today known as Sir Sanford Fleming Elementary, located at 49th Avenue and Knight Street. Enrolment continued to increase and a site for a purpose-built high school was chosen near 41st Avenue and Fraser Street, adjacent to the South Vancouver municipal hall and fire station. South Vancouver's first, stand-alone high school was built in 1920, and was opened on January 21, 1921 by its new namesake, the Honourable John Oliver, then Premier of BC. By 1926, the enrolment of the school was over 900, and a second building with an additional 8 rooms was built to the west of the main building, on 43rd Ave. This new building, now called "The Barn", is still in existence today. The main part of the current school building was erected in 1950 on 41st Avenue, with the subsequent addition and expansion of technical studies shops, cafeteria and music wing during the following years. The original building burnt down on December 9, 1959.

Programs and course offerings 
John Oliver is home to a Mini School for gifted children from grades 8–12. Twenty-eight students per year are admitted to the program. Students from across district may apply. The goal of the Mini program is to enrich students in academics (John Oliver does accelerated math), leadership (special course/responsibilities in Grade 9), and enrich education outside the classroom with three field study trips every year. Students in the John Oliver Digital Immersion Mini School take special classes each year that enrich their understanding of information technology, Chroma key techniques (and more) and their cohort has a focus on using technology to assist with advanced projects. In place of their first field trip, grade 8 students visit various high-tech institutions and corporations located within the Metro Vancouver area, such as MDA and UBC.
John Oliver is one of two secondary schools in district which offer STEM Science/Technology/Engineering/Mathematics programs. As of September 2017, thirty students per year are accepted into a one-year program for Grade 9, and/or 10, and/or 11. Students may apply for subsequent years. Students take STEM on Day 1, working within a project-based program that covers curriculum and more for Math, Science, Electronics, IT. Day 2 they take subjects like English, Languages, PE, and other electives. 
Students in the Mini School, STEM and regular program can enter an annual science fair, with winners being able to move onto the district, regional, and ultimately the Canada-Wide Science Fair.
