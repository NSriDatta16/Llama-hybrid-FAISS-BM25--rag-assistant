The 653d Electronic Systems Wing is a wing of the United States Air Force located at Hanscom Air Force Base, Massachusetts.

Mission
The 653d Electronic Systems Wing executes a $21 billion fiscal year defense plan budget with 1,300 personnel. The 653 ELSW acquires, delivers and sustains Air Force and Joint systems to include communications, intelligence and airspace management capabilities supporting AF Global Continuous Operations. Additionally, the wing provides engineering and integration to optimize delivery of net-centric capabilities to warfighter for effects-based combat operations and support. The wing serves 9 major commands, 4 Services, 7 Combatant Commands (COCOM), 14 national agencies, and NATO.

Units
From 2004 to 2010 the 653rd Wing consisted of three groups with four squadrons: The 653d Electronic Systems Group, the 753d Electronic Systems Group, the 853d Electronic Systems Group, the 639th Electronic Systems Squadron, the 640th Electronic Systems Squadron, the 641th Electronic Systems Squadron, and the 644th Electronic Systems Squadron.

The 653d Electronic Systems Group (653 ELSG) executed a $18 billion Fiscal Year Defense Plan budget with six divisions and squadrons. The group had 720 personnel. The 653 ELSG acquired, delivered and sustained networks, integrated information systems, enterprise services and applications for the Global Information Grid, facilitating communication between land, naval, air and space warfare forces. The group delivered capabilities for voice, video and data networks focused on joint and coalition warfighter needs to enable worldwide net-centric ops.

The 753d Electronic Systems Group (753 ELSG) executed a $500 million Fiscal Year Defense Plan budget with 350 personnel. The group was the ESC lead for AF and joint capabilities, planning and enterprise integration. The 753 ELSG leveraged $14 billion Air Force combat and command budget in support of net-centric operations, performed XR staff functions, and identified technical opportunities through management of experiments and simulations. Additionally the group acquired, fielded and sustained interoperable C2 capabilities; implemented C2 net-centric integration with all commands and services.

The 853d Electronic Systems Group (853 ELSG) executed a $2.6 billion Fiscal Year Defense Plan budget with 260 personnel. The group acquired, fielded and sustained mission critical fixed and deployable airborne, space and ground-based Communication, navigation and surveillance/Air Traffic Management and landing systems. The group also certified CNS/ATM systems to meet warfighting requirements for access to global airspace vital to AF Global Attack, Rapid Global Mobility and joint operations worldwide.

History
The wing was last active on 1 October 1994, after being redesignated the 653d Communications-Computer Systems Group on 1 October 1992 at Robins Air Force Base, GA.  The redesignated Wing activated in November 2005 at Hanscom Air Force Base as the Network Centric Operations and Integration Systems Wing.
