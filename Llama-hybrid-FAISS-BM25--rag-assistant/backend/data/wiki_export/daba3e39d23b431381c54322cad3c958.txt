Crew 
 Steve Dawson from Boston, Lincolnshire

The crew were all members of the 2002 Skandia Atlantic crossing attempt which ended after 21 days when their rudder was ripped off in a storm.

The route 
The crew's aim was to break existing Atlantic Rowing Records and to create a new one for rowing in the North Atlantic eastwards directly to mainland UK. They set off from St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada on 31 May 2005 and intended to finish in Falmouth, Cornwall, England less than 55 days later. The route was 2100 miles long.
