Sawai Madho Singh I (December 1728 â€“ March 5, 1768) was ruler of the state of Jaipur in the present-day Indian state of Rajasthan. He was the younger son of Jai Singh II and became ruler of Jaipur after his brother Sawai Ishwari Singh's death.

Biography

Madho Singh I was at Udaipur when his half brother Ishwari Singh committed suicide. Following this Madho Singh was crowned as the king of Jaipur state.

Madho Singh invited Jayappa Scindia who arrived in due time along with Malharrao Holkar to dinner where the Maratha sardars were served poisoned food which they detected and evaded in time. Next day on 10 January 1751, about 5000 Marathas marched through Jaipur and started exploring the city's temples and monuments. Marathas seemed to have behaved towards Jaipur like city taken by storms. Suddenly the pent-up hatred of the Rajputs burst forth and a riot broke out at noon and citizens attacked unsuspected Marathas. Madho Singh I posted assassins along the escape routes to kill off the Maratha envoys calling for aid. 

He won several important battles against other kings. He later reconciled with the Marathas after rewarding Holkar for his help in gaining the Jaipur throne by giving him the parganas of Rampura and Bhanpura in 1753. According to Vir Vinod which is 19th-century creation, Madho Singh gave poison to Raja Bakht Singh of Marwar but according to contemporary Persian sources Bakht Singh died due to cholera.

Death
He died in 1768 after a rule of 17 years after contracting dysentery after a battle with Jawahar Singh. Madho Singh's queen, the Maharani Chundawatji Kundan Kanwarji who belonged to the Chundawat clan, was the daughter of Rawat Jaswant Singh of Deogarh, and ruled Jaipur following his death as his heir, Prithvi Singh II was only five years old at the time. Following Prithvi Singh's death, her son Pratap Singh succeeded to the throne.
