Sigma Delta Alpha () is a Greek-lettered Latino-based fraternity established in spring 1992 at San José State University.

History 
The first interest group was formed in the Fall semester of 1991, at San Jose State University. Future Founding Father, Francisco Huerta, had the idea of creating a new organization on campus to serve the needs Latinos. Francisco Huerta took the forefront in organizing the initial meetings that set the groundwork for the establishment of Sigma Delta Alpha.

The first introductory meeting held in November 1991. The fraternity's ideological Purposes were set and after several meetings and numerous successful events it was decided that it was time for these individuals to present themselves to the community as an established organization. On May 5, 1992, Sigma Delta Alpha was officially recognized with 18 Founding Fathers.

This was one of only two Latino fraternities founded in the United States during the so-called fragmentation period from 1990 to 2000, and the third to ever be founded in California.

It is also one of the few Latino fraternities that eschew stepping, an important distinction when considering the cultural history of the practice.
