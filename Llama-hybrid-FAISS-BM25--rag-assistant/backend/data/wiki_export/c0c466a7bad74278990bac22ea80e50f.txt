History
This line constituted part of the original Keisei Main Line, opened in 1914 as a dual track 1,372 mm gauge electrified line, but once the section from Ueno and Nippori to Aoto came into service in 1932, this line became a short branch and was renamed the "Oshiage Line".

The line was regauged to 1,435 mm in 1959 in preparation for the introduction of through services upon the opening of Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transport (Toei) Line 1 (present Toei Asakusa Line) on 4 December 1960, when the line returned to its original role in the Keisei network, to provide trains from its main line to downtown Tokyo via the Toei line. It also provides connections at Oshiage to the Tobu Skytree Line and the Tokyo Metro Hanzōmon Line. The line is now a de facto'' main line of Keisei.

Former connecting lines
 Mukojima Station (since closed): The Keisei company was seeking a line to Tokyo, and encouraged the Ōji Electric Railway to construct a 1.4 km 1,372 mm gauge line to this station as part of a campaign for government approval for a Tokyo line, the line opening in 1928. However, once approval to build to Ueno was received, the Tokyo line proposal lapsed and the line closed in 1936. Mukojima Station closed in 1947.
