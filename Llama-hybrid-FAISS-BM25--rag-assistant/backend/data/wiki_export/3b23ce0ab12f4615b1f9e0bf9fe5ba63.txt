Growing up in Port Augusta during her early childhood, Rings had voiced an interest in dance, but her family was unable to afford to pay for ballet lessons. She continued to show her passion for dance as she created a theatre in her backyard out of water tanks, which she turned into a cubby house and decorated with curtains, as well as dressing up her siblings in costumes which she made out of bits of materials that were available to her. She would often stage mini productions with her siblings in her makeshift theatre.

Influences
Rings’ earliest memory of dance is watching Young Talent Time (1971-1988), an Australian variety show on television which inspired her to become a dancer. Some of her earlier dance heroes were Alvin Ailey, whom she admired due to his American Dance Theatre which was one of the first professional dance companies that welcomed dancers of all races and backgrounds. Before Alvin Ailey, she was inspired by Michael Jackson.

During high school, Rings’ dance class was taken on a trip to Sydney to watch a live performance of Cats the musical at the Theatre Royal. Rings remembers being fascinated by the way dancers were able to move their bodies and stated she did not know dancers could use their bodies to create such movements. The performance inspired her further to pursue dance as a career.

Choreographic works
Rings' choreographic works are often influenced by her childhood experiences with nature. During her childhood, her father, a German migrant, struggled financially to provide for his family due to the aftermath of World War II. The main source of sustenance that he could provide for his family included what he grew in his own vegetable patch and orchard. Rings also recalls how on the way to school in the morning, she would climb over other people's fences to pick figs, nuts and grapes. She believes that because of her father, Rings developed her "connection to country". It was not because of her Aboriginal background, or from a cultural perspective.

Rings mentions being influenced by the way her aunts and sisters told stories, specifically their body language, such as gestures and expressions, and how she is able to see them reflected within the shape of trees.
She said in 2022 that she likes choreography that shows "clean shapes and distinctive physical architecture of body", that also embodies the convergence of the spirits of culture, Country and people.

Unaipon (2004)
Unaipon  (2004) was Rings' third work for Bangarra. It was a celebration of the life of Ngarrindjeri author and inventor David Unaipon (1872–1967), with the work comprising three sections: "Ngarrindjeri", "Science",  and "Religion". Each section related to different aspects of Unaipon’s life and work, with the whole work bringing an interconnected story to the stage. Rings saw this as a way of bringing Indigenous stories, which had often been ignored in school curricula, to a wider audience, of bringing them into the mainstream.

Terrain (2012 and 2022) 

Stephen Page asked Rings to choreograph a work depicting Aboriginal views on landscape. She cites her trips to Flinders Ranges, which she used to visit every weekend as a child, and also Kati Thanda–Lake Eyre as her main influence to choreograph a piece that illustrates how geographical features influences people's mood and spirit. She wanted to incorporate imagery of Lake Eyre that she had witnessed during her visit. She states how on the first day of her trip to the lake, it was filled with water, but the next day it was empty and shiny. She also took a tour with an Arabana elder, who showed her around waterholes and sacred sites. She had access to stone tools and ancient paintings that mapped secret waterways. Rings was influenced by literal ideas of elements that make up the physical landscape of the lake, and explored figurative ideas of human connections to land and nature which she incorporated into her work, Terrain in 2012.

Rings re-staged Terrain in 2022, with the show touring Sydney, Canberra and Brisbane from June to August.

Sheoak (2015) 
When choreographing Sheoak, Rings was influenced by sheoak trees and how it is used by people to provide medicine, shelter and food amongst other purposes. Through symbolism, Through the choreography, Rings wanted to create a connection between the sheoak trees and Indigenous stories, focusing on how like sheoak trees, Indigenous languages, customs and knowledge are endangered.
