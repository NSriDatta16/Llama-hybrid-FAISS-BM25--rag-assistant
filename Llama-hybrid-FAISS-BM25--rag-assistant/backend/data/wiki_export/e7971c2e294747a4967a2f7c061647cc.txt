History 

The Northern Riverina Football League was formed in May 1924 when the Ungarie Football Association amalgamated with the Lake Cargelligo Football Association to form the Northern Riverina Australian Rules Football Association.

The five foundation club's in 1924 were - Burgooney, Girral, Lake Callgelligo Rovers, Tullibigeal and Ungarie, with Girral defeating Ungarie in the grand final.

Blow Clear entered the competition in 1925, with Tullibigeal losing only one game for the year, but were defeated by Lake Callgelligo in the grand final.

Girral and Blow Clear merged in 1926 and went on to be the premier team. Following a split in the Tullibigeal club, Four Corners was formed in 1927 and went onto be a very competitive club right up until 1994, when they folded.

Calleen joined in 1928 and Four Corners won the premiership in only their second year in the NRFA. while in 1929 Weja joined the competition, which was divided into two divisions of four teams. Four Corners and Girral finishing on top of their divisions, with Four Corners coming out on top in the grand final.

Lake Callgelligo Rovers withdrew in 1930 and the competition went back to one division, with Four Corners defeating minor premiers, Ungarie in the grand final.

Calleen and Girral both withdrew in 1932 and Yelkin entered the competition, with minor premiers, Ungarie losing to Four Corners in the grand final.

Naradhan entered the NRFA in 1933 and Tullibigeal broke through for their first premiership with an eight point victory over Four Corners in the grand final.

Burgooney won the 1934 flag when they defeated Tullibigeal by points, then Burgooney lost the 1935 grand final when Ungarie's Les Woolsterncroft snapped a goal late in the last quarter, to defeat Burgooney by one point!

West Milby who joined in 1935 and Erigolia who joined in 1936, played off the 1936 grand final, with West Milby winning their one and only premiership. Girral withdrew form the NEFA half way through the 1936 season. 

In 1937, Lake Cargelligo re-join with a blue uniform and West Milby make the grand final from fourth position, but are defeated by Four Corners in the grand final.

Kikoria entered the NRFA in 1938 and Tullibigeal won the flag, after drawing the first semi final against West Milby. Burgooney, minor premiers in 1938, only lost one match throughout the year, then kicked 7.19 - 61 in the grand final to lose by 30 points.

Ungarie dropped out in 1939, there only season they did not field a team, with Burgooney defeating West Milby by three points in the grand final.

Kikoria won the premiership in 1940, and also won it again in 1941, after Four Corner went into recess and some of their players moved across to play with Kikoria's premiership team of 1941.

The NRFA went into recess from 1942 to 1945 due to World War Two. Tullibigeal then won three consecutive premierships immediately after the war from 1946 to 1948, under the leadership of George Imrie.

In 1947, Ungarie wore a white jumper with a red sash. 

In 1949, the NRFA, best and fairest player was awarded the Griffith P. Evans Cup, Griff Evans was a former West Wyalong player and official and also a local solicitor and NSW State Member for Lachlan, whose family donated the cup.

Rankins Springs and West Wyalong boosted the competition to seven teams when they joined in 1949, but Forrest Vale withdrew. 

In 1950, Lake Cargelligo returned to the NRFA and Ungarie won their first premiership since 1935, led by former Forrest Vale captain, Jim Dale.

Tullibigeal had a golden era in the 1950's winning senior football premierships in 1951, 1953, 1955, 1957 and 1958 and well as three of their players winning best and fairest award, the Evans Cup in - David Imrie, Kelth Imrie and Vince Dwyer.

Footballers from the NRFL who have played in the VFL/AFL include the Daniher brothers (Terry, Neale, Anthony and Chris) and Ben Fixter.

Pre 1924 Football
Australian Rules Football was introduced to the Northern Riverina region around in the early 1890's when farm land was being settled and with the discovery of gold at West Wyalong in 1893.

West Wyalong formed a club in 1913, consisting of two teams, the Rovers (maroon & gold) and the Globes (blue), then in 1914, a competition was held between Blow Clear, Hiawatha and West Wyalong. Ungarie was formed in 1916 and played three friendly matches against Blow Clear in their first season.

After World War One, the Bolygamy District Football Association was formed and Australian Rules Football was really starting to get established in the Northern Riverina area. Lake Cargelligo Rovers Football Club was formed in June 1922.
