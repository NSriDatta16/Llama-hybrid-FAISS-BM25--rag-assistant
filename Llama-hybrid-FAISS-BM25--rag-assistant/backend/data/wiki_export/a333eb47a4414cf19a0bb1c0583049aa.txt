History 
There has been presence of human beings since the Paleolithic. Lithic workplaces corresponding to that era were found in the Southern half of the municipality.

This current municipality was also inhabited by people during the first centuries of the Ancient Era (from the 5th century to the 3rd in this case) by Iberians. There is a former settlement in the Northwest end it also occurs in Fortuna and Jumilla and another one in the south.

There were also people inhabitance and structures corresponding to the period when Romans ruled the Iberian Peninsula. A Roman road (via romana) traversed Abanilla and there are remains of it. Another site dating back from that era is a former Roman villa.

A war with conquer purposes begin in the Iberian Peninsula in 711. Muslim peoples intended to rule the peninsula and conquered large part of it from the starting year to 726. The nobleman Theodemir did an agreement with the governor Abd al-Aziz ibn Musa in 713 which name is Treaty of Orihuela. The treaty lead Abd al-Aziz to rule territory between Vinalopó and Segura rivers. Consequently, Abanilla had dependency on Orihuela during the Muslim Iberian Peninsula era.

A structure that originated in that period is the alcazaba (Arab fortification) of the town.

The king of the Taifa of Murcia signed the Treaty of Alcaraz, which consisted in conferring vassalage to the Crown of Castile, in 1243. Muslims were allowed to stay, and keep their religion, customs, organisations, etc. provided they paid extra taxes. In this era, Abanilla ceases being part of Orihuela because the first one belonged to Castile and the second one to Aragon.

In 1613, the king Ferdinand III of Castile ruled the expulsion of the Muslims. As there were rather many of them in Abanilla (over 1,000), the town turned out not to have enough workers for land labouring and that caused an economic downturn, which lasted for a century.

There had been an increase in population in the 18th century and there were over 7,000 inhabitants in that century. New dwellings and buildings were necessarily built beyond the town-surrounding wall. Many important buildings of the municipality were constructed during this century.

In the third quarter of the 20th century, water canals were built in Abanilla and drinking water supply begin to exist in the municipality.
