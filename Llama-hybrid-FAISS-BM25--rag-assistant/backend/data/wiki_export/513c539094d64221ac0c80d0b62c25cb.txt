Halesowen College is a further and higher education college in Whittingham Road, Halesowen, West Midlands. It was established in 1982 as a tertiary college. The college also has a Business Centre about a mile away at Coombswood that opened in September 1999.

History
Founded in 1982, it replaced a former small further education college. It was created as a tertiary college following the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley's reorganisation of post-16 studies.

From 1985 to 2003, the Walton Campus (previously Walton Girls School) was part of Halesowen College.

The college was founded in 1966 and on its completion consisted of one large building – which was later designated as Block 0 following the construction of more buildings.

Its current principal is Jacquie Carman.

Four more buildings (Block 1, Block 2, Block 3 and Block 4) were built in 1982 when the college underwent the most significant transformation in its history as part of a reorganisation of education in Halesowen, which saw sixth form facilities withdrawn from secondary schools as well as compulsory education being reorganised to traditional infant, junior and secondary schools from the three-tier system that had been introduced 10 years earlier. This was a landmark change in education in the Dudley borough, sparking a similar reorganisation in the rest of the borough within a decade.

In September 1985, the college further expanded when it took over the former Walton Girls School in Highfield Lane as a campus.

Block 5 was opened in 1997 to accommodate a new library and learning centre. Block 6 (Sports Studies) and Block 7 (ICT and Performing Arts) were opened in late spring of 2003 to replace the facilities at the Walton Campus, which was sold off to make way for a housing estate. The new building was officially opened on 22 September 2003 by Charles Clarke, the education minister.

Halesowen College purchased Shenstone House office block, on Dudley Road, in the summer of 2005 and converted into a Health and Beauty academy.

Buildings

Block 0

This was the original Halesowen College building. It accommodated a refectory, maths and science hub computer suite, science laboratories and an animal care centre. It was built in 1966 but by 2004 there were plans for complete reconstruction of the block. The block was extended to include an admissions centre in the early 1980s but refurbishment in 2003 saw this area converted into a computer suite called the Hawne Room. Students based here studied many different subjects, from Animal Care and Separate sciences to Applied science courses such as forensics and medicine.

Part of the building was demolished in 2008 to make way for a new building which forms the first phase of a complete replacement of Block 0; it was completed in the summer of 2009 and the phased rebuilding was completed by 2012, leaving no trace of the original 1966 college.

Block 1

One of four blocks which were built in the early 1980s. Includes a lecture theatre, staff room, and classrooms for business studies, and the senior management offices.

Block 2

The Catering and Hospitality Department is also situated in this block. This block was renovated in 2019-2020 as the Student Hub incorporated student services, the library, computers and spaces for socialising. The catering department still remains in Block 2.

Block 3

The third of four blocks which were built for the 1982 reorganisation. It houses the Art & Design Department and the Earth Science Department.

Block 5

The library and learning centre covered most of the upstairs of the building until it was reduced in size in 2003 following the opening of several learning centres across the college, to make was for the Humanities department. As of 2020, this block is currently being refurbished with plans for its reopening later this year.
