The BMW Charity Pro-Am is a golf tournament on the Korn Ferry Tour. It is currently played at Thornblade Club (host course) in Greer, South Carolina and The Carolina Country Club in Spartanburg, South Carolina.

From 1992 to 2000, the event was played at Verdae Greens Golf Club in Greenville.

When the event changed to a pro-am format in 2001, it moved to The Cliffs in Travelers Rest, South Carolina, using the Valley and Keowee Vineyards courses. The Walnut Cove course was added in 2005. In 2008, the tournament shifted to three different courses: Thornblade Club, Carolina Country Club in Spartanburg, South Carolina and Bright's Creek Golf Club in Mill Spring, North Carolina. In 2012, the Greenville Country Club (Chanticleer course) replaced Bright's Creek.

The 2017 purse was $700,000, with $126,000 going to champion Stephan Jäger. Since 2002, the tournament has been sponsored by German car manufacturer BMW, which has an assembly plant in Spartanburg County.
