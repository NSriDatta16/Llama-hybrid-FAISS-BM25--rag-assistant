Justice Yaqub Ali had held a previous martial law by a usurping general violating the constitution of Pakistan as martial law undermines the concept of the rule of law which is the basis for the country's constitution. The usurping General Zia realized his illegal actions would be overturned in a court of law headed by a Judge who believed in democracy so he proposed amendments to force the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Muhammad Yaqub Ali to retire.
