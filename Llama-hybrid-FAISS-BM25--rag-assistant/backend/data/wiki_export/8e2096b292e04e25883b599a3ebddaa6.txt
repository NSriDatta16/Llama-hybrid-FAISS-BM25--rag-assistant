The Church of Saint Nicholas was first mentioned in 1357 and rebuilt in the Neo-Gothic style in 1872. The Marian Holy Trinity column is from 1716 and is the oldest statue in the town. On the square there is a fountain from 1814 and monument to Jan Hus from 1898.

Thanks to the legend of finding a miraculous statue of the Virgin Mary, the Minim monastery was established in the second half of the 17th century. The Church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary was built in 1709–1724 and made Nová Paka a pilgrimage site. After the religious reform of Joseph II, the monastery was closed in 1785. From 1872, the premises served as a hospital. Today it houses social services.

Cemetery Chapel of Our Lady of Sorrows comes from 1700–1709. The wooden Greek Catholic Church of the Transfiguration of Jesus and Saint Nicholas was transferred from Carpathian Ruthenia in 1930.
