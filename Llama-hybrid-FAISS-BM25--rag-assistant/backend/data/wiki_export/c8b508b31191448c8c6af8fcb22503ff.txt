Katherine Marie "Katie" Weatherston (born April 6, 1983) is a Canadian retired ice hockey player and head coach of the Lebanese women’s national ice hockey team. As a member of the Canadian women's national ice hockey team, she won Olympic gold in the women's ice hockey tournament at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin and medalled at two IIHF Women's World Championships.

Playing career
Weatherston played four years of college ice hockey with the Dartmouth Big Green women's ice hockey program in the ECAC Hockey conference of the NCAA Division I, from 2002 to 2005 and for the 2006–07 season. 

She debuted with the Canadian national team at the 2004 Four Nations Cup. For the 2005–06 school year, Weatherston opted to put her college career on hold in order to focus entirely on preparing to represent Canada at the 2006 Winter Olympics.

After completing her college eligibility with Dartmouth, Weatherston played the 2007–08 season in the Canadian Women's Hockey League (CWHL). She began the season with the Ottawa Capital Canucks but transferred to and finished the season with the Montréal Stars.

In 2009, Weatherston sustained a concussion during a pick up hockey game. It was not her first concussion but, unlike previous instances, her post-concussion symptoms lingered for over two years – dashing her hopes of participating in the 2010 Winter Olympics and bringing an early end to her playing career.

Personal life
Weatherston was born on April 6, 1983, in Thunder Bay, Ontario, to David and Anna Weatherston. She has a bachelor’s degree in psychology from Dartmouth College.
