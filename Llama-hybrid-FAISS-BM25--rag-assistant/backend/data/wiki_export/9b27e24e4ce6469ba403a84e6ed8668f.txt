Development in the Brookfield area began in 1869, when the area was opened for logging and farming.

A Bible Christian Church congregation (a denomination of Methodism) was established in 1869. In January 1870 a committee was formed to raise funds to construct a church.

Brookfield State School opened on 27 March 1871 on a  site donated by Mr J. W. Barnett. In 1874, a teacher's residence was built for the school. In 2021, the school celebrated its 150th anniversary. The original school building is still in use.

In 1872, a  site was reserved for recreation.

In October 1892, the Anglican parish of Indooroopilly purchased land for a church on the north-east corner of Brookfield Road and Boscombe Road for £20 from the owner, William Thomas Gee.

The town hall was moved from Darra to Brookfield in 1931.

In 1932, the school teacher's residence was too small for a teacher with nine children, so a new building was constructed. The old building was bought by the Brookfield Hall trustees and relocated it where it became the Brookfield General Store.

In 1932 Father Robert Bartlett Bates, the rector of All Saints Anglican Church at Wickham Terrace purchased a house at 139 Brookfield Road to establish St John's Home for Aged Men, which subsequently relocated to West Toowong (where it continues to operate as St John's Residential Aged Care Home). On 12 May 1934 the Anglican Church opened St Christopher's Lodge, a home for boys. It was officially opened by James Francis Maxwell, the Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for Toowong. It was a farm school which operated until circa 1959. Around this time,  of the site was sold to the Presbyterian Church (now the Uniting Church in Australia) to develop an aged care centre. It was subsequently used a friary used by the Society of Saint Francis, a centre for contemplative spirituality and other community purposes. It is now within the suburb of Kenmore Hills and is listed on the Brisbane Heritage Register. In 2019 the site was sold by the Anglican Church to the Uniting Church on the condition that community could continue to use the site.
