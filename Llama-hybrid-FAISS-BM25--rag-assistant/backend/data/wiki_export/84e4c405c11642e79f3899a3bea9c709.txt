Early life and education 
Born in Idaho Territory near present-day Cambridge, Donart graduated from the prep school of the University of Idaho in Moscow in 1909, then earned a Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws degree.

Career 
Donart practiced law in Weiser for decades and as a member of the Idaho Senate from 1933 to 1941 and from 1943 to 1947.

1946 Senate race

After Senator John Thomas's death in 1945, Governor Charles Gossett, a Democrat, resigned and allowed his successor Arnold Williams to appoint him to the Senate vacancy, which in turn allowed him to enter the special election race as the incumbent. During the 1946 primary race, Donart was endorsed by Idaho's other U. S. Senator, Glen Taylor, who had defeated him in the 1940 primary.

Donart defeated Gossett in the Democratic primary, but was defeated in the general election by Republican congressman Henry Dworshak.

Personal life 
Donart died at age 72 in 1961, and is buried at Hillcrest Cemetery in Weiser.
