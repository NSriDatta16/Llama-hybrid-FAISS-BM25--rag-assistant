Chilly Beach: The World Is Hot Enough is a Canadian animated comedy film based on the television series Chilly Beach and produced by March Entertainment. The title is a parody of the James Bond film The World Is Not Enough.  An early version of the film had its premiere at Sudbury, Ontario's Cin√©fest, and Boston, Massachusetts in 2005. It was released February 5, 2008 on DVD in Canada. A second film, The Canadian President was also later released.

Plot
Dale wonders why no one ever visits Chilly Beach, and he realizes that it's due to the cold climate. Thus, Frank invents a super heater to warm Chilly Beach up. When the U.S. learns about it, they steal it and accidentally use it to destroy the planet. Frank and Dale must travel back through time to undo the damage.

In addition to the James Bond-like opening credits and theme song, the movie contains references to Back to the Future and The Terminator.
