Gommar A. DePauw (11 October 19186 May 2005) was a Belgian-American traditionalist Catholic priest and founder of an organization that he called the Catholic Traditionalist Movement.

Education and career 

From 1952 to 1963 DePauw taught canon law at Mount Saint Mary's Seminary in Emmitsburg, Maryland. In 1955 he requested and was granted incardination from the Diocese of Ghent to the Archdiocese of Baltimore and was named academic dean of the seminary.

Fr. DePauw never broke communion with the visible Church, retaining incardination until death in the suburbicarian diocese of Tivoli. 

On 23 June 1968 DePauw established the Ave Maria Chapel in Westbury, Long Island.
