Atomic beam is special case of particle beam; it is the collimated flux (beam) of neutral atoms. The imaging systems using the slow atomic beams can use the Fresnel zone plate (Fresnel diffraction lens) of a Fresnel diffraction mirror as focusing element. The imaging system with atomic beam could provide the sub-micrometre resolution.

History
In 1911, Louis Dunoyer observed sodium vapor 'rays' in a vacuum chamber. Learning from that experience, Otto Stern worked with Walther Gerlach to produce silver atom beams for their historic Sternâ€“Gerlach experiment, providing the first evidence of atomic scale quantization.

In 1930, Immanuel Estermann and Stern reflected a helium beam from lithium fluoride observing the first atomic matter wave diffraction peaks in the reflected intensity.
