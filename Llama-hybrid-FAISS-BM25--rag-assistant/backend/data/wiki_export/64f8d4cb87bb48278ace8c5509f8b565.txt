Pulled pork is an American barbecue dish, more specifically a dish of the Southern U.S., based on shredded barbecued pork shoulder. It is typically slow-smoked over wood (usually outdoors); indoor variations use a slow cooker. The meat is then shredded manually and mixed with a sauce. It may be served on bread as a sandwich, or eaten on its own.

Preparation
Pulled pork, almost always a shoulder cut, is commonly slow-cooked by first applying a dry rub, then smoking over wood. A non-barbecue method uses a slow cooker, a domestic oven, or an electric pressure cooker (such as an Instant Pot).

For the meat to 'pull' properly, it must reach an internal temperature of 195 to 205째F (90.5 to 96째C); the smoker temperature can be around 275째F (135째C). Cooking time is many hours, often more than 12 hours (though much shorter with electric pressure cookers, typically from 60 to 90 minutes).

In rural areas across the United States, either a pig roast/whole hog, mixed cuts of the pig/hog, or the shoulder cut (Boston butt) alone are commonly used, and the pork is then shredded before being served with or without a vinegar-based sauce. Before cooking, it is common to soak the meat in brine; this process provides the extra moisture needed for a long, slow cooking process.
