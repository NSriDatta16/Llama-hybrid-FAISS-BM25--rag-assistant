Being Cyrus is a 2005 Indian English-language thriller film directed by Homi Adajania. The film revolves around a dysfunctional Parsi family. The film was originally titled Akoori, a reference to a traditional Parsi scrambled-eggs-like side dish. The film is the directorial debut of Homi Adajania and Saif Ali Khan's first film in English. Upon its release, the film was reported to be released in Hindi dubbed version as well in 2007, however the director cancelled the plan.

Plot 
The plot is narrated at times from the perspective of Cyrus Mistry.

Dinshaw Sethna is a retired sculptor who lives with his wife Katy in Panchgani. Dinshaw's brother Farrokh, their father Fardoonjee, and Farrokh's wife Tina reside in Mumbai.

Cyrus Mistry, a wanderer hailing from Jamshedpur, arrives at Dinshaw's house one morning. He professes his admiration for Dinshaw's work and asks if he can become a sculpting apprentice. Dinshaw and Katy agree, and soon the young man becomes a part of their life. Katy makes sexual advances towards Cyrus, which he tolerates, while cryptically telling the audience that he is "playing Katy". As time passes Cyrus gets to know the oddball couple better â€“ Dinshaw is an affable, perpetually zoned-out eccentric, while the promiscuous Katy, tired of slow-moving Panchgani life and her marriage, has embarked on an affair with her brother-in-law Farrokh in Mumbai. Katy makes Cyrus her pawn, sending him to Mumbai to visit her father-in-law Fardoonjee, who lives in an extension of Farrokh's flat, with orders to get a stash of money Fardoonjee supposedly has. On meeting Fardoonjee, Cyrus realizes that he is ill-treated by Farrokh. Farrokh's timid young wife, Tina, is unable to be herself except during the few hours Farrokh is at work. She enjoys smoking, loud music and goes to beauty appointments when Farrokh is gone.

Katy convinces Cyrus to murder both Fardoonjee and Tina, so that she can be with Farrokh. Unknown to Cyrus, Farrokh plans to kill him after the deed to close the loose end. Cyrus arrives at a time when Tina is coincidentally out for a waxing appointment. He meets with Fardoonjee and feeds him his favorite food before stabbing him to death immediately afterwards. Cyrus implies to the audience that he actually mercy killed Fardoonjee, to release him from his wretched life. Farrokh sneaks into the house but Cyrus kills him first. When Katy calls to check on Farrokh, Cyrus picks up the phone and tells her that her plan has failed. Cyrus then vanishes.

Katy and Dinshaw are taken by the police for interrogation. She constantly blames Cyrus for the murders, but the police find no evidence of any person named Cyrus existing in Panchgani. Katy and Dinshaw are arrested for the murders, while Tina is sent home after being told that she was lucky to be away at that time.

A few months later, Tina is in her apartment when Cyrus arrives. Apparently, he has come to finish the last murder. Instead, the pair embrace and it is revealed that they are actually siblings. The murders are shown to be an elaborate plot concocted by Tina to inherit the Sethna property. With Fardoonjee and Farrokh dead, and Katy and Dinshaw incarcerated, the plan has succeeded. While Tina is showering, Cyrus sees a newspaper where Tina has marked another prominent, wealthy family for this scheme. Unwilling to participate in this murderous scheme any further, Cyrus flees with their stolen money, leaving Tina alone.
