The Alice Davis Hitchcock Book Award, established in 1949, by the Society of Architectural Historians, annually recognizes "the most distinguished work of scholarship in the history of architecture published by a North American scholar." The oldest of the six different publication awards given annually by the Society, it is named after the mother of architectural historian Henry-Russell Hitchcock.

The Alice Davis Hitchcock Medallion, established in 1959, is awarded to the author of a literary work that provides an "outstanding contribution to the study of architectural history". The recipient(s) must be British, or the book must deal with an element of the architectural history of Britain or the Commonwealth. The medallion is a Wedgwood portrait of James ‘Athenian’ Stuart.
