North Trail High School is a high school with an enrollment of 1200 students in grades 10â€“12 (10-11 currently) in Coventry Hills, Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The school is part of the Calgary Board of Education's public school system.

History
The school had been planned for almost a decade before beginning construction, with students living in this area of the city having to go to schools several kilometers south such as John G. Diefenbaker High School and Crescent Heights High School, which could have up to a 50 minute travel time.

School construction started in 2021, and was completed in July 2023. The school opened for students on August 31, 2023.

The school is currently hosting Grade 10 and Grade 11 students for the 2023-2024 school year, and will then expand to include Grade 12 students in September 2024. This is to ease the transition for the CBE and students with the opening of the new school. Grade 12 students living in the school's enrollment area will continue to attend John G. Diefenbaker High School and other high schools for the 2023-2024 school year. 

Originally given the placeholder name of North Calgary High School, the official name was announced by the Calgary Board of Education Trustees on April 7, 2023, after consultations with a local First Nations elder.
