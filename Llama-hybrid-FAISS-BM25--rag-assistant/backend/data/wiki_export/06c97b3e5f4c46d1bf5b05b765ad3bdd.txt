Alan Bruce McInally (born 10 February 1963) is a Scottish former professional footballer, sports reporter and pundit.

As a player he was a striker for Ayr United, Celtic, Aston Villa, Bayern Munich and Kilmarnock. He is now a regular reporter and occasional pundit on Sky Sports Soccer Saturday.

Club career
Ayr-born McInally variously went by the nicknames of Rambo and Big Mac and he is the son of Jackie McInally, who played in Kilmarnock's title-winning side of 1965, scoring 11 goals. He won his first medal in the 1985–86 season, when Celtic won the title on goal difference from Hearts. Although he played only 16 games (with one goal scored), in his third and last season at the club (1986–87), he scored 15 goals in his 38 league games.

He then moved to English club Aston Villa, helping them win promotion in 1988. He was transferred in 1989 to German giants Bayern Munich, where he stayed for four years. In his first season at Bayern he made 31 appearances and scored 10 goals as he helped them win the 1989–90 Bundesliga.

International career
During this period he appeared in eight international games for Scotland and was selected for their 1990 FIFA World Cup squad.
