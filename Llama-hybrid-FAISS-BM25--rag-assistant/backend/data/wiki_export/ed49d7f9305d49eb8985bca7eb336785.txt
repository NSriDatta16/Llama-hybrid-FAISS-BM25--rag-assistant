Pelaw () is a residential area in Gateshead, located around  from Newcastle upon Tyne,  from Sunderland, and  from Durham. In 2011, Census data for the Gateshead Metropolitan Borough Council ward of Heworth and Pelaw recorded a total population of 9,100.

Pelaw lies in between the older settlements of Heworth to the west, Bill Quay to the east, and Wardley to the south, with the southern bank of the River Tyne forming the northern border.

History

Pelaw came into being due to the huge Victorian factory complexes of the Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS) which was the manufacturing division of the then burgeoning Co-op company, which grew up along the length of the Shields Road. This mile long stretch of red-brick industry was home to factories making clothing and textiles, furniture, pharmaceuticals, household cleaning products, quilts, books and magazines and the world-famous 'Pelaw' shoe polish.

The factories created Pelaw, and were a significant employer in the area during most of the twentieth century. Due to inevitable foreign competition, the prevailing economic climate, and government policies of the times, the majority of the factories were closed and demolished between the mid-1970s and early 1990s, to be replaced in recent years by modern housing estates.

Only one of the original CWS buildings – the Cabinet Factory – is extant. The Cabinet Factory in Bill Quay, which later became a major Brentford Nylons plant, has been redeveloped, now housing Stonehills Business Park. The last factory to be demolished was the Shirt Factory, the site having since been redeveloped in to a supermarket.
