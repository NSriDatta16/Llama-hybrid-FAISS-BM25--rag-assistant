Our Wife is a 1931 American pre-Code Hal Roach comedy film starring Laurel and Hardy. It was directed by James W. Horne and released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

Plot
Oliver is making plans to be married to his sweetheart Dulcy (Babe London) with Stan as his best man, but the plans are thwarted when Dulcy's father (James Finlayson) sees a picture of Ollie and forbids the marriage. The couple plan to elope, and steal away at night to a Justice of the Peace. After typical Laurel and Hardy blundering, they manage to sneak the girl away from her father's house.

Ollie, his gargantuan fianc√©e and Stan try to cram into a tiny car Stan hired for their elopement, but Ollie had expected a "limousine". After much struggling, they finally succeed in getting themselves and a suitcase into the car. As they move off, it tilts up under the weight and Stan's head smashes through the roof. The film concludes with a cross-eyed justice (Ben Turpin) marrying Ollie to Stan.
