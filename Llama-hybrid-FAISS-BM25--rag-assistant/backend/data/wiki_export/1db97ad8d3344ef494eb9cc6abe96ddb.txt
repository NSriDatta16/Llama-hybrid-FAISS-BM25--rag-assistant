Saint-Sébastien-sur-Loire (, literally Saint-Sébastien on Loire; ) is a commune in the Loire-Atlantique department in western France.

It is the third-largest suburb of the city of Nantes, and is adjacent to it on the southeast, across the river Loire. It has two railway stations on the line to Clisson: Saint-Sébastien-Pas-Enchantés and Saint-Sébastien-Frêne-Rond.

The territory of the commune was occupied at the earliest 3,000 years before our era.

During the Revolution, despite its proximity to Nantes, the commune sided massively against the Republic and joined the Vendée insurrection of March 1793.
