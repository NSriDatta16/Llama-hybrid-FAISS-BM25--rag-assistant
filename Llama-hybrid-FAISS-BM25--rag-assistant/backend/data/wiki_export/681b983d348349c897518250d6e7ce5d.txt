The song was produced by Goldfrapp and received a very positive reception from music critics. It was released as the lead single in the second quarter of 2003 and reached the top thirty in the United Kingdom, where it became Goldfrapp's first top thirty single. The original title of the song was "Wolf Lady", which makes reference to the lyrics in the second verse of the song.  The lyrics of "Train" are based on Alison Goldfrapp's observations while in Los Angeles, California.
