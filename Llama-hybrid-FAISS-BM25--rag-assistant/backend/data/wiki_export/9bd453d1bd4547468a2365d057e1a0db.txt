Placochelys ('flat-plate turtle") is an extinct genus  of placodont reptiles erected by Otto Jaekel in 1902.

Fossil records
Fossils of Placochelys dates back to the Triassic period (age range: 221.5 to 205.6 million years ago). They have been found in Germany, Austria, Hungary and Italy.

Species
This genus includes only one species:

 Placochelys placodonta Jaekel, 1902 (from Upper Ladinian of Hungary)

Description
Placochelys looked remarkably similar to a sea turtle, and grew to about  in length. It had a flat turtle-like carapace covered with knobbly plates, and a compact triangular skull. Its beaked skull had powerful muscles. It had only two pairs of palatal teeth, a large posterior pair, and a small rostral pair. The specialized broad teeth on the palate, were most likely used for crushing shellfish and hard-shelled prey. Its limbs were paddle-shaped for swimming, although, unlike modern sea turtles, they still had discernable toes, and it also had a short tail.
