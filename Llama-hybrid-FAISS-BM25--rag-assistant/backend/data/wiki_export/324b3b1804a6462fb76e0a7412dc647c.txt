Mordano ( or ) is a town and comune in Emilia Romagna (Italy), situated in the province of Bologna. The municipality is organized in two major villages: Mordano and Bubano.

History
An intense activity of centuriation was performed by the Romans in the area and this is still visible nowadays: the streets of the countryside are organized in a squared lattice, every square has a side of about 715 meters (0.444 miles).

Reclaim of land is attested during the 11th and 12th centuries, creating the massa Bibani: a little village (Bubanus) grew around this new partition of cultivable land. Later, a castle was built up in this location.

The presence of a castle in Mordano is attested during the 15th century.

Both castles were then annexed in the domain of Caterina Sforza in 1488. In 1494, king Charles VIII of France destroyed the castle of Mordano, but it was unable to conquer the one of Bubano, bolstered by Caterina Sforza and transformed into a strong fortress.

During the following centuries, Mordano and Bubano were part of the domain of the Church and the two municipalities were joined. During this period, also the castle of Bubano was gradually demolished and nowadays only the main tower (known as Torrione Sforzesco) still exists.

In 1860 the municipality of Mordano became part of the newborn kingdom of Italy.
