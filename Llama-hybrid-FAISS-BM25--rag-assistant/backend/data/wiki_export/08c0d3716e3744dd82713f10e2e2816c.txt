Nalini by Day, Nancy by Night is a 2005 documentary film by filmmaker Sonali Gulati.

This film explores business process outsourcing in India. Told from the perspective of an Indian living in the United States, the film provides a glimpse into India's call centers, 
where telemarketers acquire American names and accents to service the telephone-support industry of the U.S. The film incorporates animation as a way to build in personal narrative in a doodle-like manner. It also includes live action footage which takes the form of cinema verit√© and innovatively edited interviews, and archival footage that provides contextual analysis to the socio-political history of globalization and capitalism. The film is a commentary on identity in the new millennium that intersects diaspora with global outsourcing. It was first shown at the 2005 Margaret Mead Film Festival.
