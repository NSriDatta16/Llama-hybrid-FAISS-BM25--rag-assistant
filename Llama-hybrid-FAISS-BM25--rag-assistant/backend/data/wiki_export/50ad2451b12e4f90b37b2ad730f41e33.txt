The Hyde Park Herald is a weekly newspaper that serves the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois.

Overview 

The newspaper was founded in 1882.  For the Herald'''s first seven years, it was a suburban newspaper covering affairs in an independent unit of local government; after Hyde Park was annexed by Chicago in 1889, the Herald evolved into its current status as an urban neighborhood newspaper.

The Herald covers local business, retail, politics, real estate and housing, the University of Chicago, sports, Kâ€“12 education and local Chicago Public Schools, parks (including the Barack Obama Presidential Center), crime, obituaries and fire. Freelancers provide photography and arts coverage.
