Fantastic Plastic Records is an independent record label based in London and Brighton. 
 
Fantastic Plastic was formed by lifelong music fan Darrin Robson in a County Down attic.  Originally specialising in mail-order only rare and collectible records, it soon grew into the opening of two independent local record shops before making the move to release the label's debut vinyl EP by Cork's finest The Sultans Of Ping FC in 1991. Further releases soon followed by bands such as Television Personalities, The Blue Aeroplanes and Ash before the label relocated to London going on to work with bands such as Ikara Colt, Guillemots and The Futureheads.

Aside from the label FP are also an artist management company FP MUSIC representing Villagers who have been shortlisted on two occasions for the Mercury Prize for their first two albums Becoming a Jackal and Awayland. 
The company also set up a publishing wing and signed Luke Haines; they currently represent the majority of The Auteurs back catalogue.
