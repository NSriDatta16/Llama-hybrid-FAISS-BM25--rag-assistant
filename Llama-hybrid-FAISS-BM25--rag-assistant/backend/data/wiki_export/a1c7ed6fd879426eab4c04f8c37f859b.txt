The Last Rune is a series of six epic fantasy novels written by American author Mark Anthony. It concerns the exploits of two earthlings, tavern owner Travis Wilder and ER doctor Grace Beckett, as well as those of their allies, both throughout their homeworld of Earth and the otherworld of Eldh. Travis soon discovers that he has a wild talent for the magic of runes, which gives him power over the material world, while Grace learns that she is a witch, with power over nature.
