Musical career
As the Goodmen, their most notable production was "Give It Up", a 1993 house music track based upon samba-styled percussion and the simple, repeating vocal line of the song title. The percussion was inspired by a Sérgio Mendes recording.

The song rose to #1 on the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart in 1993 and made a brief appearance on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, peaking at #71. When re-released in late 1993, "Give It Up" reached #5 on the UK Singles Chart.
