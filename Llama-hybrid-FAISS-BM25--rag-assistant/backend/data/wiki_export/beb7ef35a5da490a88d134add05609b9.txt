Vietnamese National Football Super Cup (), also called the Thaco National Football Super Cup due to sponsorship reasons, is Vietnamese football's annual match contested between the champions of the previous V.League 1 season and the holders of the Vietnamese Cup. If the V.League 1 champions also won the Vietnamese Cup, then the league runners-up provide the opposition. The fixture was first played in the 1998–99 season.

The current holders are Vietnamese Cup winners Dong A Thanh Hoa, who defeated runner-ups Hanoi Police 3–1 in the 2023 match.
