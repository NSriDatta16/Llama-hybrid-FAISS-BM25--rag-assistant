 The song "Blueprints for Future Homes" was the first song to be "released" on their MySpace and Purevolume pages on 7/25/06 at 12:01 AM EST.
 The song "The End of All Things Will Be Televised" was the second song to be "released" on their MySpace and Purevolume pages on 8/4/06 at 12:01 AM EST.
 The song "A Small Spark vs. A Great Forest" was the third song to be released on their Purevolume and MySpace.
 The song "A Small Spark vs. A Great Forest" refers to James 3:5-12 from the New Testament.
 The song "No Passenger: No Parasite" seems to have derived its title and the majority of lyrics from the book "Mere Christianity" by C.S. Lewis, in which Lewis describes a fully Christian society as having "no passengers or parasites".
 The song "Songs Sound Much Sadder" was featured on This is Solid State Vol. 6
