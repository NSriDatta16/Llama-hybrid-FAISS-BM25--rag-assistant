Western Carolina University
A star high school athlete in both baseball and football, Tolleson said he chose to attend Western Carolina University over other schools because it was the only program that would allow him to play both sports "with no strings attached."

Tolleson first attracted the attention of baseball scouts while playing college ball at Western Carolina. During his college career, Tolleson set ten WCU season and career records, earning  All-Southern Conference honors at shortstop in  and . In 1978, he was named Southern Conference Baseball Player of the Year, SoCon Athlete of the Year and was an All-NCAA Atlantic Region selection.

In 1977, he was WCU's emergency placekicker and was a perfect 6-of-6 on field goals, and connected on 22 of 24 extra point kicks.

At the first-ever Canadian-American Bowl in Tampa, Florida, Tolleson returned the opening kickoff. He was later named to WCU's All-20th Century Football Team and in , was inducted into WCU's Athletics Hall of Fame.

Texas Rangers
The Pittsburgh Pirates chose Tolleson in the 12th round of the 1977 Major League Baseball Draft, but he decided to return to school for his senior year rather than sign with Pittsburgh. The Texas Rangers chose Tolleson with the 202nd pick of the 1978 Major League Baseball Draft, and this time he signed.

Chicago White Sox and New York Yankees
Tolleson is often identified with the brief, disappointing tenure of Ken Harrelson as general manager of the Chicago White Sox, due to his involvement in two of Harrelson's iconic trades.
