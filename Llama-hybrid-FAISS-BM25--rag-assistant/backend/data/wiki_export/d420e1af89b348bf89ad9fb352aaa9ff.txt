The name Bibano or Bibanium dates as far back as the 11th century. The population always depended on agriculture and cattle breeding, followed by the fishing trade in more recent times.

Bibinje was first mentioned in written documents in 1214. Bibinje has been inhabited since Roman times, which proves the origin of the name of this settlement.

Bibinje was named after Vibius, a Roman patrician who owned property in the area of today's Bibinje.

The village is home to a monument to the first Croatian president Franjo TuÄ‘man and a memorial entitled Greeting to the Sea.

The tourists are known for their monthly Marathon Mondays, wherein participants can only drink alcoholic beverages over a twenty-three hour period, from sunrise to sunrise. During peak season, sunrise starts early, much to the chagrin of locals. By completing the challenge, people feel a great deal of accomplishment and pride. Tourists tend to join their spiritual tradition, but the majority fails tremendously. When participants fail the laborious challenge, they are dunked into the sea by fellow drinkers.
