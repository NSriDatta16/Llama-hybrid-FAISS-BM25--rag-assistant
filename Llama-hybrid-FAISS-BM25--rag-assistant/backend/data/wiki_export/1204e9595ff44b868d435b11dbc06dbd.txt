Pleasure Island Family Theme Park was a theme park in Cleethorpes, North East Lincolnshire, England. It was commonly known as Pleasure Island.  The park opened on 27 May 1993. It was originally a subsidiary of Flamingo Land Ltd. Pleasure Island became independent of Flamingo Land in May 2010 and was owned and operated by DewarSavile Enterprises Ltd until closing at the end of the 2016 season.

History 
Pleasure Island Family Theme Park stood on the site of the former Cleethorpes Marineland and Zoo. Owned and operated as a satellite zoo of Flamingo Park, and later by Scotia Leisure, the zoo had such attractions as dolphins, sea lions and pelicans. The zoo closed in 1977. The site was sold to Pleasureworld, a division of RKF Entertainment, who announced that a new theme park would be built, as a sister park to the Pleasurewood Hills park near Lowestoft and bearing the same name. Construction began on the new theme park in the 1980s.

RKF Entertainment went into receivership during the early 1990s and construction of the park was halted. The site was sold to Robert Gibb, the managing director of Flamingo Land in Malton, North Yorkshire. Gibb decided to continue with the redevelopment of the site as a theme park, which became Pleasure Island. Reconstruction of the park was completed by Gibb in 1992 and Pleasure Island Family Theme Park was opened on 27 May 1993. Robert Gibb's son, Gordon Gibb, later became the chief executive of the company to directly run Flamingo Land, while his sister Vicky Gibb, and subsequently other sister Melanie Wood (formerly Gibb), took the responsibility for the management of Pleasure Island.

Negotiations took place to separate Pleasure Island from its sister park Flamingo Land, resulting in the managing director of Pleasure Island Melanie Wood taking control of the park on 14 April 2010 as a separate entity from the family company. Pleasure Island was then operated by Dewarsavile Enterprises Ltd, directed by Wood, and marked the end of Pleasure Island and Flamingo Land's association. As a result of the ownership transfer the Grimsby Telegraph website broke news that the park had closed. The park reopened under its new ownership on 1 May 2010. In 2013 a farm and petting zoo was added, including a tractor ride replacing an electric monorail.

Pleasure Island Family Theme Park closed permanently at the end of the 2016 season. The contents, including a 1904 carousel, were put up for auction. The last of the rides were sold off in October 2018 however as of 2023 the majority of the buildings themselves remain intact on the abandoned site. This includes all the buildings near the park entrance, the dodgems building, the children's show area and the building that housed the carousel ride. Current proposed plans for the site included two hotels, several hundred log cabins, a casino and other leisure developments and a supermarket.

The theme park was split into 6 areas:
 Africa – themed around Africa, the largest area of Pleasure island and containing one white-knuckle ride
 Kiddies Kingdom – rides for especially young children
 Morocco – themed around Morocco, with three white-knuckle rides: the Alakazam, Hydromax and the Hyper Blaster
