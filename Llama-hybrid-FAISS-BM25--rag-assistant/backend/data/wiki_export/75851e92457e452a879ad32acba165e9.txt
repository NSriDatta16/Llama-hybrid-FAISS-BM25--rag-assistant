Terbium(III) chloride (TbCl3) is a chemical compound. In the solid state TbCl3 has the YCl3 layer structure. Terbium(III) chloride frequently forms a hexahydrate.

Preparation 

The hexahydrate of terbium(III) chloride can be obtained by the reaction of terbium(III) oxide and hydrochloric acid:

Tb2O3 + 6 HCl → 2 TbCl3 + 3 H2O

It can also be obtained by direct reaction of the elements:

2 Tb + 3 Cl2 → 2 TbCl3

Properties 

Terbium(III) chloride is a white, hygroscopic powder. It crystallizes in an orthorhombic plutonium(III) bromide crystal structure with space group Cmcm (No. 63). It can form a complex Tb(gly)3Cl3·3H2O with glycine.

Applications 

Terbium(III) chloride is used in the semiconductor industry. The hexahydrate plays an important role as an activator of green phosphors in color TV tubes and is also used in specialty lasers and as a dopant in solid-state devices.

Hazards 

Terbium(III) chloride causes hyperemia of the iris.
Conditions/substances to avoid are: heat, acids and acid fumes.
