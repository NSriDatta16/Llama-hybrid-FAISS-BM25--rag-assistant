History
PT Cakrawala Andalas Televisi, operating as ANTV was launched on 1 January 1993 as a local television station in Lampung province. In the same month it was awarded a government license for nationwide broadcasting, and moved its studio to Jakarta. 

The first programming it produced itself was live coverage of the general session of the People's Consultative Assembly on 1 March 1993.

ANTV has 37 relay stations covering 155 cities across Indonesia and reaches 130 million people.

After the 77th Indonesian Independence Ceremony, ANTV switched from 4:3 into 16:9, beginning with the ANTV HD on 18 August 2022 during midnight programming. IndiHome TV and First Media carried the ANTV HD version a few days later in 2022.
