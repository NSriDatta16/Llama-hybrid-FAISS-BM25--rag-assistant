Hampton High School is a public secondary school in Hampton, Virginia. It is the oldest of the four current high schools in Hampton Public Schools, built in 1956. It is an International Baccalaureate World School with the Diploma Programme.  Hampton High is the first high school in the Hampton city high school division.

History
Hampton High School traces its roots to the first free school founded in the American Colonies, the Syms-Eaton Academy, which opened on February 12, 1634, as the Syms Free School. Syms is the oldest free school and the first endowed educational institution in the United States. In 1634 Benjamin Syms left  and eight cows to provide a free school for children of the parish.

In 1659 Thomas Eaton, a 'cururgeon' (surgeon), left , buildings, livestock, and two slaves for a school to serve Elizabeth City County. The schools were so popular that in 1759 an act was necessary to provide for the attendance of only poor children at Eaton School.

In 1805 the schools were merged by act of the General Assembly and called Hampton Academy, which in 1852 became part of the public school system. Its building was burned in 1861 and rebuilt after the war, taking the official name of Hampton High. The first graduating class was in 1896, consisting of two students: Miss Bessie Birdsall and Miss Blance Bullifant.

From the early 20th century, Hampton High was ranked in the top ten of schools in Virginia, and the West Point Military Academy acknowledged that it accepted Hampton graduates without requiring them to take the West Point entrance exam. The current building for Hampton High dates to 1956; due to the layout of the building, it earned the nickname "Little Pentagon" because of its "seemingly endless hallways."

Hampton High is the oldest public school still in use. The school was featured in national news in the summer of 1995 for the celebration of the centennial graduating class (1996). There is a section of seating at football games for the alumni who are in their 70s and 80s.

Accreditation and rankings
Hampton High School is fully accredited by the Virginia Department of Education based on its performance on the Virginia SOL Tests. It was included in Newsweek magazine's "Top 1200" high schools in 2008 and 2009 and the "Top 1600" (top 6%) in 2010.

In March 2019, for the first time in Hampton's history, the Band and Chorus earned Superior ratings at State Assessments, establishing Hampton High School as Blue Ribbon School, which is the highest musical honor a Band and Choral program can receive.

Demographics
In the 2005-2006 school year, Hampton was 81% Black; 14% White; 3% Hispanic; and 2% Asian.

Athletics and extracurricular
The school's official mascot is a crab, and athletic teams are referred to as the "Crabbers." Occasionally, Freddie the Crab can be found on the sidelines at football games. The Crabbers compete in Group AAA, the largest group in the state, Peninsula District and Eastern Region of the Virginia High School League.

Football
In the 1980s the Crabbers appeared in the state championship game 8 times in 10 years, winning 5. 1980, 1981, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, & 1991. The Crabbers have the Peninsula District/Eastern Region/State Record for most consecutive wins. Their most recent title was in 2005. The Crabbers have won 18 state titles the first in 1912 and two National High School titles 1996 and 1997.

Basketball
Hampton is also known for its basketball teams. The girls' team is a perennial contender in the district, winning the district title more often than not in the last decade, including all of the last seven. The Lady Crabbers are the 2006-07 Eastern Region Champions and the VHSL Group AAA State Champions. The Hampton High boys' team finished first in the district in the 2011-2012 season going on to win the AAA state championship.

In 2013, the Crabbers earned VBODA Virginia Honor Band again. Both of the concert bands earned Superior Ratings in grade 4/5 and 3 music respectively. The marching band earned a combined score of 98 at State Marching Assessment, as well as all "A"s in all captions. The Percussion section went undefeated for the second year in a row in class. The bands earned Grand Championships at the Menchville Monarch Competition, the Hermitage Classic, and the Hanover Hawks Marching Invitational. This is in addition to winning their class at every competition in the 2013 season. The Band also participated in a concert band clinic at the University of Virginia, before the State Concert Assessment.

For four consecutive years, from 2010 to 2013, the Pride of the Peninsula has been the highest scoring band out of the City of Hampton at the annual Holiday Parade.
