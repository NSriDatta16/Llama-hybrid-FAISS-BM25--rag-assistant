Haddon W. Robinson (21 March 1931  22 July 2017) was an American evangelical who was the Harold John Ockenga Distinguished Professor of Preaching, senior director of the Doctor of Ministry program, and former interim President at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary. He was also the founding President of the Theology of Work Project.

Biography
A native of New York City, Robinson received a bachelor's degree from Bob Jones University, a Th.M. from Dallas Theological Seminary, a M.A. from Southern Methodist University, and a Ph.D. from the University of Illinois. Robinson served as president of Denver Conservative Baptist Seminary (now known as Denver Seminary) for 12 years (1979–1991), and taught homiletics on the faculty of Dallas Theological Seminary for 19 years. He has authored seven books, including Biblical Preaching. "Biblical Preaching" is a primary source for the study of expository preaching.  He wrote and edited for several magazines.

Robinson was heard as the 'lead teacher' on the 15-minute Discover The Word radio program (formerly Radio Bible Class) produced by Grand Rapids, Michigan-based RBC Ministries.

Robinson co-founded the Theology of Work Project and served as the Project's president from its inception in 2007 until his death in 2017.

Robinson lived with his wife, Bonnie, in South Hamilton, Massachusetts, and Willow Street, Pennsylvania. They had two children. Robinson died from Parkinson's Disease.

One of his major contributions to homiletics was the "Big Idea of Biblical Preaching" (the title of a book which is in his honor), whereby sermons should have one major idea (has one subject and one complement), even if the big idea breaks down into several subpoints. Robinson also argues that a sermon should be primarily expository, since that places the authority in the biblical text, not in the preachers themselves. He was instrumental in changing the name of Denver Conservative Baptist Seminary to Denver Seminary.
