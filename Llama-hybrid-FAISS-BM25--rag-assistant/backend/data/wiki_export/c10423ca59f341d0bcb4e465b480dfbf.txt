The 14th World Cup season began in December 1979 in France and concluded in March 1980 in Austria.

Andreas Wenzel of Liechtenstein edged out Ingemar Stenmark of Sweden for the men's overall title. Wenzel's older sister, Hanni Wenzel, won the women's overall title for the second time, making them the first sibling combination to both win the overall World Cup title (as of 2017, joined only by Janica and Ivica Kostelić from Croatia) and the only one to win in the same year.

The World Cup race scoring system was revised again, the third different system used in less than a year.  The new system was a "Top 15" points system (ranging from 25 points for first, 20 for second, 15 for third, 12 for fourth, and 1 point less for each subsequent position down to 1 point for 15th).  This system remained in effect through 1991.  The season championship for the "Combined" discipline also returned this year, for the first time since 1976.

A break in the schedule in February was for the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York, U.S.A. This was the final time that the Winter Olympics also served as the FIS Alpine World Ski Championships; the World Championships would become a separate competition held in odd-numbered years beginning in 1985.
