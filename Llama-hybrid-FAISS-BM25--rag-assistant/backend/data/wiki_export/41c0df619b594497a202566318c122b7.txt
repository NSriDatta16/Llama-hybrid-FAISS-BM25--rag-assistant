Just One Night is the fourth studio album by English singer Samantha Fox. It was released on 21 June 1991 by Jive Records. In addition to longtime collaborators Full Force, the album also features production from Robert Clivillés and David Cole of C+C Music Factory. The lead single, "(Hurt Me! Hurt Me!) But the Pants Stay On", had some radio airplay, but failed to receive much attention. The album's second single, "Another Woman (Too Many People)", remixed for radio, charted moderately in some continental European countries. The radio remix of "Another Woman (Too Many People)", along with the third single, "Just One Night", and fourth single, "Spirit of America", written by Mama's Boys member Pat McManus and featuring a guitar solo by Glenn Tipton of Judas Priest, were subsequently included on Fox's 1992 Greatest Hits album.

On 23 July 2012, the album was reissued as a two-disc deluxe edition by Cherry Red Records in the United Kingdom, including bonus tracks and remixes.

Critical reception
Chuck Eddy from Entertainment Weekly gave the album an A, writing, "Who follows an insanely impudent single called ”(Hurt Me! Hurt Me!) But the Pants Stay On” with a medley of two of disco’s most X-rated hits ever (Andrea True Connection’s ”More, More, More” and Donna Summer’s ”Love to Love You Baby”)? Samantha fox, a smart Cockney hussy, who ensures right off that we hear her fourth album, Just One Night, as a G-spot manifesto. She’s hilarious; Madonna should retire to a convent."
