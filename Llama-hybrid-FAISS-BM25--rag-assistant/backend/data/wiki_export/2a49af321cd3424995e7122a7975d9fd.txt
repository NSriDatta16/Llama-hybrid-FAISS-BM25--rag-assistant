For the overall 2009 season, LeCras became the most potent forward in the team kicking 30 goals in the first 12 rounds, and 58 for the season, topping the Eagles' goalkicking list.

2010: All-Australian

In round 16 of 2010, LeCras kicked a personal best of 12 goals, doubling his previous record of 6, in an outstanding individual display against Essendon at Etihad Stadium. It broke the previous record of 11 (kicked by Stephen Milne) for the most goals kicked by an individual in a game at the stadium. This was one of a few highlights in a dark season for the Eagles in which they won the wooden spoon for the first time in its history. The performance also earned LeCras 226 points in the Herald Sun Supercoach competition, the highest score for the 2010 season. LeCras later finished Third in the Coleman Medal with 63 goals from 21 games, behind Jack Riewoldt and Barry Hall. On 10 September 2010, LeCras was awarded the "prestigious" award of the West Coast Eagles Club Champion.
On 13 September, LeCras was selected at forward-pocket in the 2010 All-Australian team, the only player from the West Coast Eagles in the team. He was also nominated as one of the three contenders for goal of the year for his effort against Essendon in Round 16, one of twelve goals scored on the night, eventually losing out to Lance Franklin for the award.

2011–2012: Midfield move and injury
After a strong pre-season, LeCras ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) at a West Coast training session in February 2012, and was ruled out for the remainder of the season, opting to undergo a full knee reconstruction.

In 2019, LeCras signed with West Coast's fierce local rivals, Fremantle, as a part-time specialist forwards coach, for the 2020 AFL season.
