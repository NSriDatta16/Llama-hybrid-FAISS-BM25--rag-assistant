Critical reception
On its release, Cash Box wrote, "A vision of a future where civilization is overrun by nature, much to the chagrin of the natives. Byrne is a genius at saying it all between the lines, and this little gem is a light-hearted romp into our greener-grass lives." Music & Media described "(Nothing But) Flowers" as "a rhythmic but also surprisingly melodic song with striking vocal harmonies". 
The Song Was Also Featured In The Kevin Smith Film Clerks 2.

2010 TED Conference
