Temple
The Maa Bagheshwari Devi Temple is dedicated to Goddess Kudargarhi who is perched on top of a hill and is the  major attraction in Kudargarh.

The history of the temple is obscure. According to Dalton, the temple was built by Suryavanshi Khairwar Baland Rajput Kings. Balands were the original rulers of Korea state in the 17th century.

Also Devotees throng this temple to appease the goddess for the fulfillment of their desires. On fulfillment of their wish, the Goddess is offered with the blood of a goat which is poured into a small hole (kund) of 6 inch in diameter. It is said that the kund would not get filled up even if thousands of goat's blood is poured into it, in which blood goat in honour of devi is given, a fact is that it never overflows.
