History 

West Melton was first settled in the 1870s, where it has long been associated with horse racing (trotting), cropping, and sheep farming. Recently, it has become associated with wine growing and deer farming. In 1881, Alfred Saunders arrived in West Melton, where he bought a farm that he referred to as a “bleak and wild looking property”.

On 26 October 2014, West Melton residents celebrated the town's 150th anniversary.

Urban expansion 
In 2007, West Melton saw the start of its urban expansion. Gainsborough and Halkett Grove subdivisions were the first developments to be built, followed by Preston Downs to the west of Gainsborough and a third subdivision called Wilfield built to the south of Gainsborough. 

One more subdivision and a southern extension of Wilfield are planned to be built. This third subdivision is being developed by Hughes Developments Ltd, and will be built to the east of Gainsborough. A retirement village, developed by Marama Te Wai Ltd, is to be built to the west of Preston Downs. This is in contrast to scaled-down plans. In December 2020, original plans were for a 50-hectare subdivision to be built, however, in June 2022, only 12.5 hectares was allocated for zoning change.

The spread of housing developments into fertile rural land has led to tensions between the traditional farming community and recent arrivals. It is common for these tensions to spill onto community notice boards.
