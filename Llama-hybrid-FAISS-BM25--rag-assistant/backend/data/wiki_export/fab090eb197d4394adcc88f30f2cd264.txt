Cork United Football Club was a League of Ireland club based in Cork from 1940 until 1948.

History
Cork United was formed in February 1940 upon the dissolution of Cork City. The new club took Cork City's place and that season's playing record in the League of Ireland. The new club enjoyed a golden age in the early 1940s, winning five league titles, before disbanding and resigning from the league on 10 October 1948. Another new club, Cork Athletic was immediately formed to take its place.
