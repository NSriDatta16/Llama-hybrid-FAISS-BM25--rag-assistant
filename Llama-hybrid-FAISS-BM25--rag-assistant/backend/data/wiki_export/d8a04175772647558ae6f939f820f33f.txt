Depression
In June 2004, Ergić was treated for depression in the psychiatric university clinic in Basel, and his further career as a football player was in question at the time. Nevertheless, FC Basel kept him as a player and eventually made him club captain. He is also close friends with Ljubo Miličević. He appeared on the Swiss late night show Aeschbacher, stating that football players earn too much money and expressing sympathies for the ideas of Karl Marx.

Journalism
Since December 2008, Ergić has been writing an irregular column for Serbian daily newspaper Politika. His contributions are about issues related to professional sports, written from an insider's viewpoint. He's touched on various topics such as: male chauvinism in sports, raw competitive spirit he considers to be unhealthy, corporate machinery behind institutionalized sports, and lack of public's understanding for professional athletes who do not subscribe to a cliché lifestyle created by sports media, fans, club leadership, and leagues stakeholders and officials.
