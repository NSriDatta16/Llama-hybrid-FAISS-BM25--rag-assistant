Lost artworks are original pieces of art that credible sources indicate once existed but that cannot be accounted for in museums or private collections or are known to have been destroyed deliberately or accidentally, or neglected through ignorance and lack of connoisseurship.

In some cases, such as the Portrait of Henry VIII by Hans Holbein the Younger (lost in a fire in 1698) many copies had been made, so we have a good idea of the work's appearance. Almost all portable stone sculptures from classical antiquity are later copies of pieces famous at the time, mostly from the Roman period. 

The US FBI maintains a list of "Top Ten Art Crimes"; a 2006 book by Simon Houpt and a 2018 book by Noah Charney and several other media outlets have profiled the most significant outstanding losses.

Research and recovery efforts 

The Art Loss Register is a commercial computerized international database which captures information about lost and stolen art, antiques and collectables. It is operated by a commercial company based in London.

In the U.S., the FBI maintains the | National Stolen Art File, "a database of stolen art and cultural property. Stolen objects are submitted for entry to the NSAF by law enforcement agencies in the U.S. and abroad."

A number of search and recovery efforts were created in response to major loss events, notably:
Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program ("Monuments Men"), 1943–1946
Bureau of Revindication and Damages (Poland), operated from 1945 to 1951
Bureau of the Government Representative for Polish Cultural Heritage Abroad, 1991-
