He graduated from the local gymnasium at sixteen, and enrolled at the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg, where he studied for three years.

He then spent two years travelling, spending some time in Karlsruhe, where he took classes at the Academy of Fine Arts. He arrived in Düsseldorf in 1860, and became a student of Wilhelm Sohn, who gave him such wholehearted encouragement that he decided to stay there. He settled on a street which was the home of several other artists and their studios.

His home and studio at Rosenstraße Nr. 41 became a retirement home for the Mutual Aid Association of the . Streets were named after him in Essen and Wuppertal.

Work
Due to his father's profession, he was inclined to religious themes from the beginning. His models were the Dutch and German masters of the 15th and 16th centuries, and he strove for a realistic presentation. It was said that what he gained in truthfulness was a loss for beauty.

Some of his best-known Biblical scenes are:
 "Christ on the Cross" (1866, St Mary's Cathedral, Tallinn)
 "The Last Supper" (1870, National Gallery, Berlin)
 "Crucifixion" (1873, Hamburg Kunsthalle)

 "Taking Care of Christ's Body" (1883, Dresden Gallery)

 "Christ and the Rich Youth" (1892, Düsseldorf Gallery)
 "Sermon on the Mount" (1893, Düsseldorf Gallery)
 "Healing of the Palsied" (1895, Breslau Museum)
 "The Raising of Lazarus" (1896, Museum Kunstpalast)

He also painted excellent portraits; making sketches of prototypical peasants,  which he drew while visiting Estonia. There, he was a tutor to famous Estonian painters such as Ants Laikmaa, and the brothers, Kristjan and Paul Raud. Many of works were considered for inclusion in the series of trading cards issued by the Stollwerck chocolate company.
