No. 306 "Toruń" Polish Fighter Squadron () was one of several Polish squadrons during the Second World War. It was formed as part of an agreement between the Polish Government in Exile and the United Kingdom in 1940.

History

Formed on 28 August 1940 at RAF Church Fenton, the squadron inherited the traditions, along with the emblem and a large part of the initial crew, of the pre-war Polish Torunian Fighter Squadron. The bear climbing a tree (Coat of arms of Madrid) was an emblem of the No. 605 (County of Warwick) Squadron, the unit of the first (British) commander of the new squadron, F/Cdr. Douglas Scott.

Throughout its existence, the squadron claimed 68 confirmed kills, 16½ probable and an additional 26 damaged. In addition, the crews of the 306 downed 59 enemy V1 flying bombs. It was disbanded in December 1946 after the end of World War II.
