Blinded by Science is an EP by new wave/synthpop artist Thomas Dolby, comprising extended 12-inch single versions of songs from the 1982 album The Golden Age of Wireless. It was released in 1983.

Four of the recordings had previously been released as two separate 12-inch remix singles in the UK: "She Blinded Me With Science" backed with "One of Our Submarines"; and "Windpower" backed with "Flying North". (These two singles were also released in 7-inch format, containing their shorter versions.) "Airwaves" is the full-length UK album version, since the US version of The Golden Age of Wireless contained the shorter UK single version.
