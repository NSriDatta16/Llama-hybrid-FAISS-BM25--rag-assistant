History

In the 1870s, Tingrith was described as:A parish in Woburn district, Beds; 4 miles E of Woburn, and 4½ SE of Ridgmount r. station. Real property, £1,450. Pop., 226. Houses, 38. The living is a rectory in the diocese of Ely. Value, £240.* Patrons, Misses Trevor. The church is chiefly later English.

In the past, the most common occupation for males over the age of 20 in Tingrith was agricultural labour; in 1831 70% of males over the age of 20 were working in agriculture. Other popular occupations during this time were: farmers employing labourers, retail, professionals and servants. In 1881 agricultural work was still very popular in the Tingrith area, with 64% of males working in agriculture. Although information for male occupations was well recorded, 50% of female occupations were unknown in 1881. Of the female occupations that were recorded in 1881, the most common were for women to work in the domestic services or offices or working with dress. As 84% of the occupations were labourers or servants in 1831, it can interpreted that Tingrith at this time was a lower class area. Along with this, in 1831 only 11% of the population were employers or professionals.

As seen from the graphs above, today in Tingrith, the most common occupations for males are leading roles, such as managers, directors or senior officials. This is closely followed by jobs in skilled trade. This is very different to the most common occupation in 1881, which was agriculture; very little of this is seen in Tingrith today. The most common occupation among females is a working professional; this is closely followed by jobs in leading roles, such as managers, directors and senior officials. It is clear that far more women are working today than back in 1881, as far more of their occupations are recorded.
