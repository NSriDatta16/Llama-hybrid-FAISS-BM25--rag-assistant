Rajská zahrada (, ) is a Prague Metro station on Line B. It was opened on 8 November 1998 as part of the extension of Line B from Českomoravská to Černý Most. The station was designed by Patrik Kotas.

It has an unorthodox platform design, where trains in each direction are on a different level with the westbound platform being directly above the eastbound track. Due to its unique architectural design, Rajská zahrada was named the Czech Construction of the Year for 1999.
