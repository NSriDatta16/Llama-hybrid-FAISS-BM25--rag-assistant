(also shortened as Show and AG) is an American hip hop duo from The Bronx borough of New York City, composed of record producer Rodney "Showbiz" Lemay (born July 7, 1969) and rapper Andre "A.G." Barnes (born September 26, 1970). The duo formed soon after their debut on the song "Back to Back Rhyming" from Lord Finesse's Funky Technician album and joined the hip hop collective D.I.T.C. along with Lord Finesse, Diamond D, Fat Joe, O.C., Buckwild and Big L.

Career

The duo's first release was an extended play Soul Clap, self-released in late 1991 via their own independent record label, Showbiz Records. The EP included a song "Diggin' in the Crates" with verses from Diamond D and Lord Finesse, which became the name of a bigger group called D.I.T.C. They signed with Payday/London Records and re-released the EP on March 17, 1992 as "Party Groove"/"Soul Clap" (also known as Showbiz & A.G.). On September 22, 1992, the duo released their debut studio album, Runaway Slave, with guest appearances from Diamond D, Lord Finesse, Dres, and the first album appearance of Big L. In 1993, Showbiz became popular for producing KRS-One's single "Sound of da Police".

In 1994, Showbiz and A.G. had a guest spot on Black Sheep's second album Non-Fiction, on the track "E.F.F.E.C.T.". Showbiz soon shortened his name to Show, changing the group name to 'Show & A.G.'. 1995 saw the release of their second studio album, Goodfellas, which featured a darker sound than their debut, as well as the absence of Showbiz rapping. It featured contributions from artists who were on Runaway Slave, plus the Ghetto Dwellas (D Flow and Party Arty), Big Cathy, Roc Raida, Method Man, Wali World and DJ Premier. The most successful song from the album was DJ Premier's 'Nyte Time' remix of the track "Next Level", an instrumental version of which was later featured in the 2002 film 8 Mile.

Following the release of EP-turned-LP Full Scale project in 1998, the duo began concentrating on their work with D.I.T.C., as well as solo projects. In 1999, the duo appeared on A.G.'s first solo studio album, The Dirty Version, which also featured contributions from 7 out of 8 D.I.T.C. members (Big L was the only absent member due to being murdered on February 15 later same year), as well as the Ghetto Dwellas, Gang Starr, KRS-One and Big Pun. Showbiz was one of the executive producers on D.I.T.C.'s self-titled group album, which was released in 2000 via Tommy Boy Records.

The album featured 18 new tracks performed by the likes of O.C., Party Arty, Milano, Fat Joe, Sean Price, and late Big Pun and Big L over Show's productions. It also saw A.G. and Show reunite as A.G. was featured on 2 of the album's songs, "Chase Game" and "You Ain't a Killer".

In 2007, they released a new EP entitled Live Hard on D.I.T.C. Records, their first new material in nearly a decade.
