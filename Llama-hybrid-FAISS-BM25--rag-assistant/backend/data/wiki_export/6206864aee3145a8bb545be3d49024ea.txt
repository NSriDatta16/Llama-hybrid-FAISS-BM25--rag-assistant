Jimmy Orr (October 4, 1935 â€“ October 27, 2020) was an American professional football player who was a wide receiver for the Pittsburgh Steelers and Baltimore Colts for 13 seasons from 1958 to 1970 in the National Football League (NFL). Orr was a two-time Pro Bowler with the Steelers in 1959 and the Colts in 1965. He was a popular player during his time in Baltimore and the corner of the end zone in Memorial Stadium where he caught many of his passes was nicknamed "Orrsville."

Orr played college football at the University of Georgia and was chosen UPI NFL Rookie of the Year in 1958 with 33 receptions for 910 yards and seven touchdowns. His 910 yards stood as a franchise rookie record until 2017 when the total was surpassed by JuJu Smith-Schuster. Orr's three touchdowns and 205 yards in the season finale against the Chicago Cardinals remain Steelers rookie records. He played his first three seasons in Pittsburgh, was traded in a five-player deal in July 1961 and concluded his career with ten seasons in Baltimore.

Orr retired in 1970 with 400 career receptions for 7,914 receiving yards and 66 touchdowns.

Orr is known for his part in a play in Super Bowl III against the New York Jets. On the last play of the first half, Colts quarterback Earl Morrall handed the ball to Tom Matte, who threw a lateral back to Morrall in a flea-flicker play. Orr, wide open at the 20-yard line with an easy path to the end zone, frantically waved for Morrall's attention, but Morrall did not see him and threw instead to fullback Jerry Hill, and the ball was intercepted by Jets safety Jim Hudson. The Colts had successfully run the play in a regular-season game that year against the Atlanta Falcons.
