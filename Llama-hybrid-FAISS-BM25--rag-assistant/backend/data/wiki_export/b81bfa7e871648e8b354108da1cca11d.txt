Morning Is When Jenoah Wakes Up
Shortly after being signed to Drive-Thru Records, Jenoah digitally released the EP, Morning Is When Jenoah Wakes Up,  as the first of two free downloadable EPs (the second being hellogoodbye's Hellogoodbye) on the label's homepage. The physical release was issued later with two bonus songs.  The album's cover art comes from a photo published on page 130 of the February 1966 issue of Playboy magazine.
