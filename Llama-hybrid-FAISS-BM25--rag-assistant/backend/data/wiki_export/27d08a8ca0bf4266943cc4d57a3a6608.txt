Bezirk Braunau am Inn is a district of the state of
Upper Austria in Austria.

History
During the Bavarian uprising of 1705 and 1706 the country defense congress ("Braunau Parliament") was held in Braunau. In addition to leader Johann Georg Meindl, born in Weng, Christian Probst wrote of other leaders from the court of Braunau: old Hofbauer from Wuerlach, the rotbartete Schwaiger, Schienkhueber zu Mitterndorf, Neuhauser zu Hochburg, Meindlsberger in office at Eggelsberg, the innkeeper of Ibm and Baron of Taufkirchen, who was a civil servant there.

The district was created in 1868.

Franz Xaver Gruber composer of the Christmas carol "Stille Nacht" ("Silent Night") was born in the district in 1787. Adolf Hitler was born here on 20 April 1889.

Memorial blocks

The Cologne artist Gunter Demnig laid 13 Stolperstein memorial blocks for victims of National Socialism in the district of Braunau am Inn.
The former "home district of the Führer" was the first district or county in German-speaking Europe to memorialize Nazi victims in this form and on this scale. Gunter Demnig has placed over 20,000 paving stones with the inscription "Hier wohnte" (German for "here lived") in front of the houses of Nazi victims since 1997. However, this occurred mostly in cities and in rural communities the practice remained the exception.
