The Indianapolis Prize is a biennial prize awarded by the Indianapolis Zoo to individuals for "extraordinary contributions to conservation efforts" affecting one or more animal species.

Overview
The Indianapolis Prize was established by the Indianapolis Zoo to recognize and reward individuals who have achieved significant successes in the conservation of animal species.

Every two years, nominations of deserving individuals for the Indianapolis Prize are accepted. From those nominations, a group of conservation experts from around the world select six finalists. A second group of conservation experts, aided by representatives from the Indianapolis Zoo and the city of Indianapolis, serve as jurors to review the work of the six finalists and select the winner.

From 2006 through 2012, winners received an unrestricted cash award of US$100,000, which was increased to US$250,000 for 2014 and subsequent years. In addition, beginning in 2023, the five other finalists each receive a US$50,000 unrestricted cash award.

Many renowned conservationists and scientists have served on the nominating committee and jury, including E.O. Wilson, John Terborgh, Peter Raven, and Stuart Pimm. New nominating committee and jury members are chosen each two-year prize cycle.

The Eli Lilly and Company Foundation provides funding for the prize. In addition to the US$250,000 award, the winner also receives the Lilly Medal. The obverse of the Lilly Medal features a shepherd surrounded by nature and the rising sun. On the reverse is inscribed a quote from naturalist John Muir, "When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the Universe."

Indianapolis Prize Gala 
The winner and finalists are celebrated at the Indianapolis Prize Gala held in downtown Indianapolis. It is designed to inspire guests to care more about animal conservation and place these dedicated heroes on the pedestal usually reserved for sports and entertainment stars.

In 2022, the Indianapolis Prize Committee created a new award recognizing conservationists early in their careers and under the age of 40 years of age with the drive to make a significant impact on a species or group of species. The goal of the award is to encourage talented individuals who dedicate their lives and careers to saving species. 

Similarly to the Indianapolis Prize Award, the Emerging Conservationist is chosen through a two-stage selection process. The Winner receives a US$50,000 award to further their conservation work.
