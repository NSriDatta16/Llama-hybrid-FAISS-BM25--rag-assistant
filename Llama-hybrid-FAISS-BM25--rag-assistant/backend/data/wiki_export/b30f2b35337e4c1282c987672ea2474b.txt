Ritchie Jr. Bridge, more commonly known as the Ravenswood Bridge, is a two-lane cantilever bridge in the United States, connecting Ravenswood, West Virginia and rural Meigs County, Ohio, across the Ohio River.  It has a total length of  with a main span of .  The bridge was completed in 1981.

The bridge replaced a ferry that had crossed the river between Ravenswood at Walnut Street and rural Lebanon Township since at least 1908. When the bridge opened in 1981, on the Ohio side of the river, the bridge and its approach route carried the  Ohio State Route 824 (SR 824). The crossing originally led to a winding two-lane SR 338. On the West Virginia side, the bridge carried West Virginia Route 338. In 2003, the SR 824 and WV 338 designations were removed when the US 33 relocation in Meigs County was completed and the US 33 designation was moved onto the bridge.
