Salford and Eccles is a constituency represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament since 2015 by Rebecca Long-Bailey, a member  of the Labour Party.

Further to the completion of the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, the seat will be subject to boundary changes which will involve the loss of Eccles. As a consequence, its name will revert to Salford, to be first contested at the next general election.

History
The constituency was created following the Boundary Commission's Fifth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies (ended 2008), and was first contested at the 2010 general election. The review led to the loss of one seat in Greater Manchester, and the Salford and Eccles seat covers parts of the previous Salford and Eccles constituencies.

The last MP for Salford was Hazel Blears, whereas the last MP for Eccles was Ian Stewart. Hazel Blears was chosen as the Labour Party candidate to represent the new constituency at the 2010 general election. Following Blears's retirement, Labour member Rebecca Long-Bailey was elected to replace her in 2015.
