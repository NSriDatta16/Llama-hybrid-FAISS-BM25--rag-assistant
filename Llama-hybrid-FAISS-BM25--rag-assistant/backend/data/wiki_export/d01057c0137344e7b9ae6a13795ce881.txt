The Lake Placid Stakes is a Grade II American Thoroughbred horse race for three-year-old fillies over a distance of one and one-sixteenths miles on the turf course scheduled annually in late July or early August at Saratoga Race Course in Saratoga Springs, New York. The event currently carries a purse of $200,000.

History 

The event was inaugurated on 20 August 1984 as the Nijana Stakes and was won by the Edward P. Evans owned Possible Mate as part of an entry with Miss Audimar leading throughout the race to win by 2 lengths in a time of 1:50 flat.

The event was named after the broodmare Nijana, who as a two-year-old won the Grade III Schuylerville Stakes in 1975 at Saratoga.

In 1986 the event was upgraded to the Grade III and in 1999 to Grade II.

In 1998 the event was renamed the Lake Placid Stakes after the village of Lake Placid, which is approximately 100 miles north from Saratoga in the Adirondack Mountains.
In 1990 the event was taken off the turf due to the state of the turf track after prolonged inclement weather and was run on dirt. The 2010 event was also moved off the turf, which led to three horses scratched, leaving a field of three.

The Lake Placid was run in two divisions in 1988, 1991, and from 1992 through 1995.
