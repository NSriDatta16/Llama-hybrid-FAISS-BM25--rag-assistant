Gianfranco Rotondi (born 25 July 1960) is an Italian politician. Born in Avellino, Campania, he is a member of the Chamber of Deputies.

Career 
Graduated in law, he was first elected in the Chamber of Deputies in 2001 as member of the House of Freedoms and Union of Christian and Centre Democrats in the uninominal electorate of Rho. In 2005, he left UDC over disagreements about the relationship with Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia, which Rotondi wanted to be closer. He then founded a new party strongly inspired on Christian ideals and the former Christian Democracy party, called Christian Democracy for Autonomies. In 2008, his party joined the People of Freedom, and he was appointed Minister without Portfolio for the Implementation of the Government Program in Berlusconi IV Cabinet, a position he held until 16 November 2011.

On 2 April 2022, Rotondi founded a new party named Green is Popular (), a Christian-democratic and green-conservative movement. Soon after that, he ended his alliance with Forza Italia and federated with Brothers of Italy.
