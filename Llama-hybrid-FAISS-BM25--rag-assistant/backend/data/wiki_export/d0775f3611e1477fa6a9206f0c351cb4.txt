Early life
Aldrich was born in Rogers, Texas, and attended Temple High School in Temple, Texas, where he was named All-State as a center in 1934.  He was an All-American center at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, Texas.  At TCU, he played alongside two legendary quarterbacks—Sammy Baugh and Davey O'Brien.  Aldrich's senior year, 1938, the Horned Frogs won the National Championship, finishing 11-0 and winning the Sugar Bowl.
