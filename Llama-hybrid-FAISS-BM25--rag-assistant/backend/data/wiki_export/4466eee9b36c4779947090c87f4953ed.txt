Rath is a quarter in northern Düsseldorf, part of Borough 6. It is about 5 km northeast of the city center, near the airport. It has an area of , and 20,483 inhabitants (2020).

History
The Rath area was occupied since at least the Mesolithic. Flint artifacts from the Neolithic and pottery and dwellings from the Bronze Age have been found in Düsseldorf-Rath. In the Iron Age Rath was a center for the Hallstatt Celtic culture, and a ceremonial site has been excavated.

Historically, Rath was mentioned as early as 1375, but Rath and its environs remained rural and agricultural until 1897 with the establishment of the Mannesmann Röhren Gross Lager Gmbh tube-rolling mill, which created the industrial character that the borough retains even today. In 1909 Rath together with Unterrath and Lichtenbroich were incorporated into Düsseldorf at their own request.  Recently Düsseldorf office parks have started to take advantage of the less expensive land in Rath coupled with its excellent transportation network.

Attractions
The new ISS Dome is a multipurpose stadium which opened in September 2006. It is located on Theodorstraße and seats up to 13,400 spectators. It is conveniently located near the A52 autobahn (motorway) and will have a large parking garage attached. The ISS-Dome will be the new home of the Düsseldorfer EG, today known as DEG Metro Stars, a successful ice hockey club that has won six German championships.
