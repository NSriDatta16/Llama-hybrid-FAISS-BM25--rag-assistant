Hassan Ugail (born September 24, 1970) is a Maldivian mathematician and computer scientist. He is a professor of visual computing at the Faculty of Engineering and Informatics at the University of Bradford.

Early life 
Hassan Ugail was born in Hithadhoo, Maldives. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in Hithadhoo.

Education 
In 1987, he moved to Mal√© to continue his education at the English Preparatory And Secondary School and at the Centre for Higher Secondary Education. In 1992, he received a British Council scholarship to continue his studies in the UK.

Career and Research 
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996, both from King's College London. He earned his PhD in Visual Computing at University of Leeds in the year 1999. His doctoral research focused on the application of Partial Differential Equations in interactive surface design.

After completing his PhD, Ugail worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at University of Leeds until September 2002. He then joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009. Ugail's research interests are in the area of Visual Computing, including 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations, and machine learning. His work in these areas has contributed to the development of new methods and techniques in the field of visual computing, particularly in the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning for biometric identification and healthcare applications. Ugail is particularly known for his work on computer-based human face analysis including, face recognition, face ageing, emotion analysis and lie detection.

Forensic science and criminal justice 
In 2018, Ugail worked alongside Bellingcat journalists to verify the identities of two suspected Russian spies at the heart of the Salisbury Novichok poisoning case. Additionally, in 2020, Ugail collaborated with the BBC News investigators to uncover an alleged Nazi war criminal, who settled in the UK, who could have worked for the British intelligence during the Cold War.

Awards and recognition 
In 2010, Ugail received the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award' from the University of Bradford to recognize his contributions to the field of visual computing and efforts in knowledge transfer.

In 2011, Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation for his work in the field of Visual Computing.
