Incidental Music 1991–95 is a collection of various b-sides and previously unreleased tracks by Superchunk. It was released by Merge Records in 1995. Despite the name of the collection, the songs included actually date from between 1990 and 1994.

A number of the tracks are covers: "100,000 Fireflies" is a song by The Magnetic Fields; "Lying in State" is a song by the Verlaines; "I'll Be Your Sister" was originally recorded by Motörhead; and "Night of Chill Blue" is a song by the Chills.

The unlisted track at the end is an alternate version of "Precision Auto," which originally led off the On the Mouth album.

The cover art is credited to Mac McCaughan, the band's singer and guitarist.
