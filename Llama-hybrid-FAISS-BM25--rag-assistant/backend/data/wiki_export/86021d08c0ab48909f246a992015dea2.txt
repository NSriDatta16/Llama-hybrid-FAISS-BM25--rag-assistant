Ksudach () (also known as Vonyuchy Khrebet Volcano) is a stratovolcano in southern Kamchatka, Russia. The last eruption of Ksudach was in March 1907, on or around 28 March, which was one of the largest ever recorded in Kamchatka, with a Volcanic Explosivity Index of 5 and a volume of ejected ash at . The 1907 eruption sent ash high into the atmosphere which was transported by the jet stream, leaving North America east of the Rocky Mountains unseasonably cold.
The summit area comprises overlapping calderas. Two lakes, Bolshoe and Kraternoe, are located within calderas at the summit of Ksudach. These lakes, along with hot springs and the surrounding wilderness, make the Ksudach Volcano region a popular trekking destination. In the event of renewed volcanic activity, its remote location minimizes its potential hazard to humans.
