Randy Newman Live is a live album by American singer Randy Newman. It is one of only two official live recordings he has released (the other was 2011's Live in London.) The album was recorded over three evenings between September 17 and 19, 1970 at the Bitter End, New York.

Originally intended as a radio promo recording to gain publicity, it is just over 28 minutes in length. The material is mostly taken from his debut album and 12 Songs plus a couple of rarities ("Maybe I'm Doing It Wrong" and "Tickle Me") and two songs from the as then unreleased Sail Away album ("Last Night I Had a Dream" and "Lonely at the Top").

"I'll Be Home" is a song that was also recorded (most notably) by Harry Nilsson (Nilsson Sings Newman, 1970), Barbra Streisand (Stoney End), Cass Elliott (Cass Elliot), The New Seekers (Beautiful People album), Anne Murray (Danny's Song), Tim Hardin and Mina (Mina, in Italian). Newman released a studio version on Little Criminals in 1977.
