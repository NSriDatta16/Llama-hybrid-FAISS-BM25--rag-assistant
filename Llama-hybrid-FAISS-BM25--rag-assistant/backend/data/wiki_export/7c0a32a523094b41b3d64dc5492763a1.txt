The competition took place at "Olympiaschanze" with a K-point of 80 metres. It started at 11 a.m. The weather conditions were good with temperatures between 0째 to 3째 Celsius and no wind.

The 80 metres were not reached due to difficult snow conditions, so the winner's lengths were 74.5 meters and 75 meters respectively. The second placed Sven Eriksson was able to stand 76 metres twice. In the second run Shinji Tatsuta reached 77 metres but was not able to stand his jump. Four jumpers fell Goro Adachi in the second run after a very attractive performance in the first heat. Shinji Tatsuta and Sauli P채lli fell in both runs, and Mario Bonomo was the only competitor who did not finish the contest after his fall in the first run.

The three judges, G. Schmidt (Germany), J. Asp (Norway), and R. Straumann (Switzerland), decided that Birger Ruud presented the most sophisticated style.
