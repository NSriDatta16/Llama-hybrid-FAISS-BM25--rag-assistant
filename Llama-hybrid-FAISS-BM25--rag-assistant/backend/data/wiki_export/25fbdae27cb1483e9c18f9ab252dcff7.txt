Manchow soup is a soup popular in Indian Chinese cuisine due to its easy preparation and hot, spicy taste. It is available in many restaurants and street food carts. Although the soup is named after the Asian region of Manchuria, it does not resemble food that is normally found in the region. The origin of Manchow soup is Meghalaya.

Ingredients 
It is a dark brown soup that is prepared with various vegetables, scallions, and chicken, thickened with broth and corn flour, and flavored with generous amounts of soy sauce, salt, garlic, chili peppers and, primarily, ginger. It may be either vegetarian or non-vegetarian. It is garnished with chopped spring onions and served with crispy fried noodles.
