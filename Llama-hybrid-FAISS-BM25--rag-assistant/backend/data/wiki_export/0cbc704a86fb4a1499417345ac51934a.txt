Henderson Creek is a  tributary of the Mississippi River, which it joins in Henderson County, Illinois, near the villages of Gladstone and Oquawka.

Henderson Creek rises in Knox County northwest of Wataga and flows west. South Henderson Creek joins the stream in eastern Warren County, and Middle Henderson Creek joins farther west in Warren County. The creek continues west, entering Henderson County, where it receives North Henderson Creek and Cedar Creek. Approximately  downstream, Henderson Creek breaks through the bluffs forming the edge of the Mississippi River valley and proceeds  farther southwest, running parallel to the Mississippi and collecting several small streams running off the bluffs, including Fall Creek and Jinks Creek.
