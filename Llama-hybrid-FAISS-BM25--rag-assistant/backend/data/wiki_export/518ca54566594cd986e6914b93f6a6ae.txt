Athletics and activities
Football:
2014 SPSL South league title
Emerald Ridge won the SPSL South league title during the 2014–2015 school year, their first ever league title. The Jags also picked up the All-City Championship by defeating both Puyallup High School and Rogers High School. They beat Rogers High School during the 2014 King of the Hill game. They've had three winning seasons at 6 wins 4 losses in the '04-'05 & '05-'06 season, and 7 wins 3 losses in the '14 - '15 season. The Jaguars won arguably their biggest game ever when they defeated their cross town rivals, Governor John R. Rogers High School (a.k.a. the Rams), on September 14, 2007, by a score of 20–19.  On the Rams final drive with sixteen seconds to play, the Rams scored a touchdown. In an effort to avoid a tie, they attempted a two-point conversion the following play; they ran a sweep play towards the sideline, and just short of the goal line their running back was stopped when he tried to cut back to the middle. On the following kickoff, the game expired making Emerald Ridge the victors. The Jaguars went on to win their game the following week, and achieving the school's longest winning streak of five games.

On October 8, 2010, the Jags defeated their crosstown rivals, the Puyallup Vikings, by a score of 20–17, earning their first victory since the 2008 season. The win snapped a 19-game losing streak for the team, and was the first time they had beaten the Vikings in the school's history.

Daffodil Festival
Every year, Emerald Ridge participates in the Pierce County Daffodil Festival. A competition is held in house to select the Puyallup Princess, who goes on to compete against other regional schools, for the Daffodil Festival Queen title. The Queen title is considered the highest honor of the regional festival. The Emerald Ridge band accompanies the float of Emerald Ridge's princesses every year in the parade, held annually in April. The Queen and runners-up receive scholarships for post-high school education, and 2009 was the first year that one of ERHS's princesses was selected as Queen (Melanie Stambaugh). In the 2013–2014 school year ERHS selected two Daffodil princesses. One of them went on to become the Daffodil Queen (Marissa Modestowicz).

JagWire newsmagazine
Emerald Ridge's official newspaper is {JagWire} newsmagazine. The paper was named by a Puyallup High School teacher and the adviser of the Viking Vanguard.

{JagWire} published a 28-page monthly newspaper for many years until it was dropped to a 16-page newsmagazine in 2010. During that time the print publication followed mostly the same design, until a redesign in 2010 led by then Editor-in-Chief Allie Rickard, the 2010–2011 WJEA Journalist of the Year.

During the 2014–2015 school year, {JagWire} dropped down to six 16-page publications that year instead of the usual eight. That same year {JagWire} started its online addition to the print publication, erhsjagwire.com, and set up social media accounts for Twitter (@GetJagWired) and Instagram (@erjagwire). The print publication also featured a new design, the first since 2010.

{JagWire} has won various state and national awards for its print publication, as well as numerous individual write-off awards from its staff members.

For the 2018–2019 school year the school district dropped the newspaper class at Emerald Ridge due to low student interest, marking the first year JagWire did not publish an issue.
