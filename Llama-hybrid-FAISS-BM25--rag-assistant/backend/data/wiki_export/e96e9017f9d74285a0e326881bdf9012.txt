Winchester Speedway is a half-mile paved oval motor racetrack in White River Township, Randolph County, just outside Winchester, Indiana, approximately  northeast of Indianapolis. It seats 5,000 spectators. It is also known as the "World's Fastest 1/2 mile".

The track's 37 degree banking is one of the steepest in motorsports, and the highest-banked active racetrack in the country.  Notable drivers that raced at Winchester include Rusty Wallace, Mark Martin, Jeff Gordon, Tony Stewart, Ryan Newman, Sarah Fisher, Chase Briscoe and William "Billy" Hutson.

Funk's Speedway

The original half-mile clay oval was built in a cornfield by Frank Funk in 1914, and the track opened in 1916 with the name of Funk's Speedway.
As owner and operator, Funk pursued a two-pronged strategy to attract spectators.
First, he recognized that attendance went up as the clay banks were raised higher and higher, reaching 25 feet by 1932, and the turns were said to be banked at 45Â° in 1948.
In 1932, the track could seat 6,000 in the grandstands, with the grounds accommodating 12,000 to 14,000.

Second, Funk tested various treatments to reduce dust and increase traction for the drivers.
He started with mineral oil, then branched out into various other substances, which would result in a track "not only relatively dust   free but pavement fast."
This work brought the attention of highway engineers, who made the track a proving ground for roadbuilding technology.
