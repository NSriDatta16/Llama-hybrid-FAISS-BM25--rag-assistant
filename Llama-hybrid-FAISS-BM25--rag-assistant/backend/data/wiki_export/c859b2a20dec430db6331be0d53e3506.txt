Scarlet and Other Stories is the second studio album by All About Eve. It was held to be considerably darker both in tone and lyrics than their first album, All About Eve. The relationship between lead singer Julianne Regan and guitarist Tim Bricheno broke down during the album's recording and production, and Regan later said that she hadn't wept as much in her life as she had during the making of this album.

Scarlet and Other Stories reached No. 9 in the UK charts with three Top 40 singles resulting from it.  The album spent 4 weeks in the UK top 100 album charts, and is certified Gold with in excess of 100,000 units being sold.
