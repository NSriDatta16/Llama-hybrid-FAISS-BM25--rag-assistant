Television

Bradbury's first ever television show was a cable show called Tellywest, where he worked alongside Sacha Baron Cohen. He has also hosted shows on Bravo (UK TV channel) including Mercenaries in 2001/2002 (later repeated on the Virgin Channel some years later), and also on Trouble TV including T Spot, Trouble @ Breakfast, Jason on Your Doorstop and Trouble Radio. He was also a presenter for BBC Knowledge's Front Room

The Gadget Show
Bradbury was a presenter on The Gadget Show for 12 years, from when it launched in 2004 to 2016. On The Gadget Show, Bradbury visited universities, laboratories and research and development departments to see future science and technology. He undertook DIY gadget builds, which have included a DIY hoverboard, the world's first 'phone glove', a Head-Up Display for his girlfriend's car, and a "mind-reading" device made from a modified mouse that (crudely) controlled a computer. He also built his own hovercraft using only a car wheel and an industrial sized fan.

Don't Scare the Hare
Jason was the host of the primetime BBC One game show Don't Scare the Hare which made its debut on 23 April 2011. The show was presented by Jason and narrated by Sue Perkins, and was scheduled to run for 9 episodes (including a compilation show), however it was axed after just a few episodes due to poor ratings.

Motor Morphers
Bradbury hosted the Channel 5 show Motor Morphers which made its debut on 6 May 2013 and ran for 4 episodes. In it, two teams were tasked with converting an old vehicle each into something different, which they then pitted against each other.
