Charles Brabin (April 17, 1882 â€“ November 3, 1957) was a British-American film director.

Biography

Born in Liverpool, England, he was educated at St. Francis Xavier College. Brabin sailed to New York City in the early 1900s and, while holding down odd jobs there, he tried his hand as a stage actor. He joined the Edison Manufacturing Company around 1908, first acting, later writing and directing. He was active during the silent era, then pursued a short-lived career in talkies. His last film was A Wicked Woman for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1934.

Brabin married his first wife socialite Suzan "Susette" Jeanette Mosher, the daughter of Edwin Howard Mosher and Jennie Slater Mosher of New York City. They wed December 14, 1913, at Bedford Congregational Church in the Bronx, shortly after Brabin returned from a trip to England and Europe. Brabin's best friend, screen actor Marc MacDermott, served as best man. Charles and Suzan Brabin remained married for seven years.

Brabin later wed silent-film "vamp" star Theda Bara July 2, 1921, remaining married to her until her death from abdominal cancer on April 7, 1955.
