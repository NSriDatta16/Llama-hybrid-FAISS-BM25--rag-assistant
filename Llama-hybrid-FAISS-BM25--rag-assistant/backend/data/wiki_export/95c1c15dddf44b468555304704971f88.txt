The Miss Georgia Teen USA competition is the pageant that selects the representative for the state of Georgia in the Miss Teen USA pageant. This pageant is directed Greenwood Productions under the ownership of Miss Tennessee USA 1989 Kim Greenwood. The pageant is hosted in McDonough, Georgia.

Georgia is in the top 5 most successful states at Miss Teen USA in terms of number and value of placements. Despite this, like their sister pageant, Miss Georgia USA, they have never won the competition despite having placed 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th as well as several finalist and semi-finalist spots. They have never won any of the main awards, but did win Style awards in 1999 and 2000.

Four Georgia teens later won the Miss Georgia USA crown, and two others won the Miss Indiana USA and Miss Virginia USA titles, respectively. Kelly Jerles, the first Miss Georgia Teen USA, became the first Teen titleholder to compete at Miss America, representing Georgia in 1987. Another Georgia teen also competed for Alabama at that pageant.

Denim Lovett of Warner Robins was crowned Miss Georgia Teen USA 2023 on November 19, 2022 at Henry County Performing Arts Center in McDonough. She will represent Georgia for the title of Miss Teen USA 2023.
