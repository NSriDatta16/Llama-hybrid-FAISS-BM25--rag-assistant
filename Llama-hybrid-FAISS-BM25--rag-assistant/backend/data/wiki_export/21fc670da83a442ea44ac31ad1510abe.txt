Disney Channel was a Scandinavian children's television channel owned and operated by The Walt Disney Company Limited. On 5 June 2023, it was shutdown and merged into Disney Channel EMEA.

History
On 28 February 2003, almost 80 years since the founding of The Walt Disney Company and almost 20 years since the launch of the original Disney Channel in the United States, the Disney Channel was launched, and was then at the time exclusive to the Viasat satellite platform (Sirius 4).

Later that year, it became available on digital cable networks, such as the Swedish Com Hem. Once the channel was originally launched, the only programs aired were animated, many of which were not Disney Channel Original Series (as they are called in the U.S.). The first live-action series aired on Disney Channel was Smart Guy, which debuted in 2005.

In 2003, the channel also applied for a license to broadcast in the Swedish digital terrestrial television network. The Disney Channel was among the channels recommended by the Swedish Radio and TV Authority, and the government granted the Disney Channel a broadcasting license on 29 January 2004. The terrestrial transmissions could start on 15 February via the Boxer TV Access platform. Soon after that, the channel celebrated its first anniversary by dropping encryption for one weekend. On 1 August 2005, the channel became available to subscribers of the Canal Digital (Thor 2) satellite platform. Simultaneously, a sister channel called Toon Disney was launched. A third sister channel, Playhouse Disney, was launched on 1 October 2006.

In the fall of 2009, the channel started broadcasting its first original productions. Among these are a sitcom called NÃ¥r klokkerne ringer, produced by the Danish production company Nobody, and the music competition My Camp Rock, produced by Titan Television.

In January 2012, Disney Channel Scandinavia got the same on-air logo and graphics as the UK version of Disney Channel at the time. Later in May 2012, the channel updated to 16:9 (widescreen).

Since 1 August 2012, the channel has been airing advertisements between the shows. In the fall of 2012, the Disney Channels in Sweden, Norway and Denmark split feeds during the commercial breaks so it would be easier to air local advertisements; however, the promos and schedule are the same in the Nordic countries.

In 12 October 2012, a Russian audio track was added.

In October 2013, Disney Channel Scandinavia introduced its own locally produced mini-series, Violetta: The Scoop, in which they catch up with Violetta, show sneak peeks, and talk about "secrets" from the show.

On 29 May 2014, Disney Channel Scandinavia began using new on-air graphics and a new logo, both created by BDA Creative. The new logo was first introduced on the German Disney Channel in January 2014 when it went free-to-air and later on 23 May in the U.S.

On 28 February 2023, Disney Channel ceased broadcasting on Allente, along with the Russian-language audio track. However, it remains in other providers. The same day, the feed ceased broadcasting in the Baltics (Since the addition of the Baltic satellite service Viasat in 2003) and was replaced by the EMEA feed of Disney Channel, in April 3 as Home3, satellite service.
On 5 June 2023 the channel was fully disconnected and it was merged into the Pan-European version.

Programming

The channel is mainly aimed at children, broadcasting Disney television series 24 hours daily. Disney feature films are also an important part of the channel's programming. All of the programs are dubbed into local languages. Since autumn 2012, Disney Channel broadcast with different video streams between the countries with its audio stream, but schedule is still the same.  Many syndicated programs have been aired on Disney Channel, such as The Fairly OddParents and Scaredy Squirrel.
