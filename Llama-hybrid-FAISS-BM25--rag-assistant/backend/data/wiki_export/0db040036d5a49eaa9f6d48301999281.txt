The church is now situated at 5 Rua De Henrique De Macedo (馬大臣街 Minister Macedo Street) (Map) in Bird Garden District (雀仔園), Macau.

According to the  Macau Christian Association data, Macau only has 4,000 registered members of the Christian faith - however there are over 70 churches so each local congregation would be averaging between 40 and 50 members.

The early church

"Chi Tao Tong" (originally known as "Chi Tao Hall") was founded in Macau during 1906. Before its establishment, Macau had garnered many religious believers and faithful followers, but no brick-and-mortar meeting places. Before the creation of the Ji Dou Church, Christians met as small congregations in the homes of their members. Early congregations began around 1898 with the arrival of London Missionary Society pastor Pei Yao. Priests of these early Christian communities included Wang Yu, Fung Fu, and Heqin Po District elders.

Community expansion 
Over the years, land and funds were donated to the growing congregation, climaxing in 1906 with the construction of a cottage-style structure to house the activities of the church. Accommodating approximately 300 seats, Chi Tao Hall commenced operation around 1906.

The church today 
Over the years, further difficulties arose surrounding a decline in attendance of the schools and services supported by the Ji Dou Church.  Other nearby institutions began transferring the Ji Dou students to their ranks, and in the first years of the twenty-first century church finally ceased its educational endeavors, with its last class of sixth grade students at Morrison Building School graduating in 2004.  By the time the church shut down its school, students had begun to move to other areas, and the congregation had begun to wane.

Today, Chi Tao Tong is a fellowship aimed at a younger audience, primarily comprising primary, secondary, and collegiate students, offering outreach to these groups, in addition to supporting femo-centric services.
