The Big Blue River is an  tributary of the Driftwood River in east-central Indiana in the United States.  Via the Driftwood, White, Wabash and Ohio rivers, it is part of the watershed of the Mississippi River.

Course
The Big Blue rises in northeastern Henry County and flows generally southwestwardly through Rush, Hancock, Shelby and Johnson counties, past the towns of New Castle, Knightstown, Carthage,  Morristown, Shelbyville and Edinburgh.  It joins Sugar Creek to form the Driftwood River  west of Edinburgh.  At Shelbyville, it collects the Little Blue River.
