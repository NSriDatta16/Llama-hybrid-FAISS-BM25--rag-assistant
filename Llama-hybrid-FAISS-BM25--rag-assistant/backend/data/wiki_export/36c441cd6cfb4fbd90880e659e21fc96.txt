House of Heroes is an American alternative rock band from Columbus, Ohio. They have released six albums: What You Want Is Now (2003), House of Heroes (2005), The End Is Not the End (2008), Suburba (2010), Cold Hard Want (2012), and Colors (2016). The band also released the album Ten Months (2001) under their original name, No Tagbacks, which had more of a punk sound than their releases as House of Heroes. They also re-released their self-titled record under the name of Say No More (2006). The band was last composed of Tim Skipper, Colin Rigsby, A.J. Babcock, Jared Rigsby, and Eric Newcomer.

History 

Originally a punk group called Plan B, the band began in 1996 at Hilliard Davidson High School in Hilliard, Ohio, composed of Tim Skipper, A.J. Babcock, and Nate Rothacker on drums. In 1998, Colin Rigsby replaced Nate Rothacker on drums and they changed their name to No Tagbacks, then, later, to House of Heroes, changing their punk style in the process. The band recorded early demos at Chris Lundquist's home studio, LundquistAudio, formerly Lunkhead Studio. In 2003, they released their first album What You Want Is Now under the name House of Heroes.

Jared Rigsby replaced A.J. Babcock as the band's live bassist in December 2005, as Babcock had married and focused on a side project with his wife called FlowerDagger. Babcock eventually rejoined the band as the live bassist and Jared Rigsby became an official member as the band's second guitarist. In 2009, Babcock stopped touring for the second time and was replaced by Eric Newcomer as the live bassist. After Babcock rejoined the band once more in 2012 as bassist, Newcomer became an official member as the band's second guitarist, involved in the writing and recording of Cold Hard Want. After only a brief touring stint in early 2012, Babcock stopped touring again and the band recruited Matt Lott (formerly of Wavorly) as touring bassist. Jared Rigsby did not appear in the band's "In The Studio" video for Cold Hard Want, nor is he featured in the band's press shot on the official page for Cold Hard Want.

Colin Rigsby was temporarily replaced by Josh Dun on drums from March through October 2010, as Rigsby felt he needed to spend more time with his family.

The band became inactive in music and on social media in September 2016, which led many to believe that House of Heroes had broken up. However, in December 2018, they played a ten-year anniversary show for their 2008 album The End Is Not the End. Jared Rigsby rejoined the band and played the entire show, and former touring bassist Matt Lott played on a few songs. The band was also joined onstage by Dun, who played drums during the track "God Save the Foolish Kings". The band played another ten-year anniversary show in 2021, this time for Suburba. The album turned eleven years old in 2021, but the planned 2020 show was delayed because of COVID-19. The band's lineup for the show once again included Jared Rigsby, with Matt Lott playing bass for the encore. The band played a third anniversary show for Cold Hard Want in 2022, once again featuring appearances from Lott and Dun.

Influences 

According to drummer, Colin Rigsby, some of House of Heroes influences are The Beatles, Queen, Bruce Springsteen, and The Clash. Tim Skipper also said that Muse is a source of influence.
In his free time, Rigsby works on art, and has his own website. He is currently working with Jon Schneck of Relient K on a graphic novel titled "En Carne."

Christian music 

Though they are sometimes considered to be Christian rock due to their association with Gotee Records, their lyrics are not always transparently Christian. In an interview with Ransom.tv, Tim Skipper discusses their part in Christian music: "We didn't feel drawn to necessarily be in the church and be a praise and worship band, and we didn't feel drawn to just be outside of it. We kind of felt like we should straddle the line, and the big deal was to keep the integrity of the music intact and not to sacrifice any of the artistry."

In another interview, bassist AJ Babcock said, "We never wanted to try to pander to a Christian audience by saying things that necessarily were just kind of, you know, lip service to people. We never want to do that unless it meant something, unless it was in context in a song." In their fifth album, Suburba, they embrace this idea, with songs such as "Salt in the Sea" and "Constant", which both can be seen as songs with Christian ideas.

In the same interview, Skipper summarizes their role by saying "We're Christian people, and we play rock and roll music."

In an April 2016 interview with BadChristian, Skipper revealed that the band never set out to be a Christian band, and their current stance is that the interpretation is up to the listeners. He also stated that not everybody in House of Heroes is presently a Christian.
