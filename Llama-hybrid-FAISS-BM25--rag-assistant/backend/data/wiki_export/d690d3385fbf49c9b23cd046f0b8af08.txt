History 
The line from Wickford to Southend including Rayleigh station was opened on 1 October 1889 by the Great Eastern Railway. There was a goods yard to the west of the station, on the 'up' (London-bound) side, including a goods shed and cattle pens. There was a signal box on the 'down' (country-bound) platform, which was closed in 1938 with the introduction of colour light signalling. Electrification of the Shenfield to Southend Victoria line using 1.5 kV DC overhead electrification was completed on 31 December 1956. That was changed to 6.25 kV AC in November 1960 and to 25 kV AC in January 1979.

To the west of the station there was a private halt called Bridge 774, which was used from May 1922 to April 1925 during construction work on the Southend Arterial Road. To the east of the station there was a siding called Downhall, associated with a brickworks, which had been decommissioned by 1968.
