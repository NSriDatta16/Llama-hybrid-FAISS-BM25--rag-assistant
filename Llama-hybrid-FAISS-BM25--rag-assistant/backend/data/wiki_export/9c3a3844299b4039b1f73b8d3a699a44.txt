Exit Records was an independent record label founded in 1982 and run by Mary Neely, a veteran of the music business and a host of several national rock and roll radio shows, including Rock Scope. The label folded in 1987.

Based in a large building on the west side of Sacramento, California, Neely set up her label with the hopes of encouraging art and creativeness over commercial success. Exit began with two small releases from the 77s and Vector before signing a production and distribution deal with A&M Records and Island Records. Included in the arrangement was a promotion deal with Bill Graham Productions.
