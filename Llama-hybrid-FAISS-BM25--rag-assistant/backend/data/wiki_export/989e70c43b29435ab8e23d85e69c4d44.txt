Bruce Andrew Ferguson Douglas (born 10 February 1980) is a former Scottish rugby union rugby player. He played as a prop, and had been signed with French top 14 club Montpellier from July 2008 up until March 2010 when it was confirmed that he was signed with Worcester Warriors. He has represented Scottish Schools, Scottish Districts and Scotland at under-16, under-18, under-19 and under-21 levels.

Douglas won his first cap for Scotland in the 37–10 win against Romania in November 2002. He played in all three of Scotland's victories in the 2002 tour of North America.

In 2003, Douglas scored his first try for Scotland in the 30–22 victory over Wales. He toured South Africa with Scotland in 2003 and his work-rate earned him recognition on the 2004 tour of Australia.

After the Borders were disbanded in 2007, Douglas was signed by the Llanelli Scarlets as the Welsh region attempted to bolster their front row. After 1 season with the Scarlets Douglas, having made 16 appearances over the course of the season, opted to leave Wales for France. After two seasons for Montpellier, he joined Worcester Warriors on a two-year deal.
