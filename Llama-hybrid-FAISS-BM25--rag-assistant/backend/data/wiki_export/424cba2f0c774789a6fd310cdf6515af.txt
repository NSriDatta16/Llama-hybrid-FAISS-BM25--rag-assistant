Yale Nance Patt is an American professor of electrical and computer engineering at The University of Texas at Austin.  He holds the Ernest Cockrell, Jr. Centennial Chair in Engineering. In 1965, Patt introduced the WOS module, the first complex logic gate implemented on a single piece of silicon. He is a fellow of both the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and the Association for Computing Machinery, and in 2014 he was elected to the National Academy of Engineering.

Patt received his bachelor's degree at Northeastern University and his master's degree and doctorate  at Stanford University, all in electrical engineering. His doctoral advisor was Richard Mattson.

Patt has spent much of his career pursuing aggressive ILP, out-of-order, and speculative computer architectures, such as HPSm, the High Performance Substrate for Microprocessors.

Patt is also the co-author of the textbook, Introduction to Computing Systems: From Bits and Gates to C and Beyond, currently published in its third edition by McGraw-Hill, which is used as the course textbook for his undergraduate Introduction to Computing class at University of Texas at Austin as well as the introduction Computer Engineering course at University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, Introduction to Computer Systems at University of Pennsylvania and Computer Organization and Programming at Georgia Institute of Technology and Introduction to Computer Engineering at University of Wisconsin Madison. It is in this textbook that the LC-3 Assembly Language is introduced.

In 2009, Patt received an honorary doctorate from the University of Belgrade.
