The Arthurian League is an English association football league for clubs comprising old boys of public schools. It is affiliated to the Amateur Football Alliance and is not part of the English football league system. It takes its name - via the Arthur Dunn Cup in which all founder members competed - from Old Etonian and England international Arthur Dunn.

League competition
The Premier and First Divisions are restricted to first teams with the remaining divisions open to all teams.

Cup competitions
Most first teams contest the Arthur Dunn Cup and some enter cups run by - or affiliated to - the Amateur Football Alliance or other Greater London associations. 
In addition, the League runs two open aged knock-out cups and two veterans cups as follows:
 The Junior League Cup (for teams in Divisions 2, 3, 4 and 5)
 The David Woolcott Trophy (for teams in Divisions 4 and 5)
 The Derrick Moore Veterans Cup (for all veterans teams)
 The Derrick Moore Veterans Plate (for teams losing their first game in the Derrick Moore Veterans Cup)
