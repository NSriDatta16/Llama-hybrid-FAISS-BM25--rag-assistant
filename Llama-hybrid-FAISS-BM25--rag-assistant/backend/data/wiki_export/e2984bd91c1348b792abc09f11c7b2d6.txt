The Academy of Information Technology and Robotics
The Academy of Information Technology and Robotics, also known as AITR, is designed to introduce high school students to the rapidly expanding digital and technological workplace and to the wide variety of career opportunities that it offers.  Students take courses in programming, database administration, web design, digital design, PC repair and networking. Also offered are courses in Game and Simulation Design and Engineering.

The AITR Academy acts as its own 'school inside of a school.' There are no bells, and students are allowed to roam between the Academy classrooms to visit specific teachers for help in any specific subject area. Students participate in group challenges divided into hexmesters, which encompass core subjects. Students use the mornings to focus on their core work, and spend the afternoons working on their technology class, one of the courses listed above. Also available is a Robotics program. The AITR program is the sponsor of FIRST Robotics Competition Team 2152.

Business Cooperative Education
Business Cooperative Education is a training program for students planning careers in business and/ or office occupations. Students go to school in the morning and work each afternoon on the job for an average of 15−25 hours per week. It is a cooperative effort between the school, parents, the student and the employer. All cooperate to assist the student-trainee in applying on the job what her or she is learning in class. BCE helps prepare students not only for his or her career upon graduation, but also for college business courses and for college expenses.
