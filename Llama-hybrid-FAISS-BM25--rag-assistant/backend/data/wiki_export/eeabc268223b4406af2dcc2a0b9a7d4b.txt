Offinso Municipal District is one of the forty-three districts in Ashanti Region, Ghana. Originally created as an ordinary district assembly in 1988 when it was known as Offinso District, which it was created from the former Offinso District Council; until the northern part of the district was later split off to create Offinso North District on 29 February 2008; while the remaining part was elevated to municipal district assembly status on the same year to become Offinso Municipal District. The municipality is located in the northern part of Ashanti Region and has Offinso as its capital town.

History
In the early 18th century, the people of Offinso were regarded as one of the Ashanti Empire’s strongest armies and played a role in the conquering of Denkyira, Akyem and Bono territory. Led by Nana Wiafe Akenten I, the second paramount chief of Offinso, they assisted in the Ashanti Empire’s great expansion over Ghana.

As a reward for Offinso people’s contributions in war, Nana Osei Tutu I granted Nana Wiafe Akenten I, a vast amount of land in the kingdom. The land granted is what makes up the present day Offinso Municipality.
