Just Because I'm a Woman is the second solo studio album by American singer-songwriter Dolly Parton. It was released on April 15, 1968, by RCA Victor. The album was produced by Bob Ferguson. It peaked at number 22 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart. The album's title track was the only single released and it peaked at number 17 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart.

Background
When Parton joined The Porter Wagoner Show in September 1967 she was still signed to Monument Records. In addition to having Parton join his show, Wagoner was instrumental in persuading RCA Victor to sign Parton to a recording contract. Parton's first three sessions for RCA were limited to duets with Wagoner as she could not record for RCA as a solo artist until her contract with Monument expired.

Recording
Recording sessions for the album took place on December 11, 18 and 20, 1967, at RCA Studio B in Nashville, Tennessee.

Content
The title song, in which a woman admonishes her boyfriend for passing judgment on her previous sexual encounters even though he is guilty of the same behavior, was regarded as something of a daring statement to make at the time. It was written by Parton in response to her husband's questioning (and subsequent reaction) if she'd ever been with a man before him. "The Bridge", distinctive because of its subject matter and rather abrupt ending, details the story of a woman who falls in love with a man and becomes pregnant with his child. His abandonment leads the woman back to the bridge where she apparently commits suicide. The last verse states, "My feet are moving slowly, Closer to the edge, Here is where it started, And here is where I'll end it..." before simply ending, midway through the verse.

Parton re-recorded "Just Because I'm a Woman" for the 2003 tribute album Just Because I'm a Woman: Songs of Dolly Parton.

Critical reception

Billboard reviewed the album in the issue dated April 27, 1968, saying that "Dolly really makes it with this package. Her performances are packed with sincerity and style. The songs include "You're Gonna Be Sorry", "False Eyelashes", "Try Being Lonely", and some more earthy, realistic tunes."

Cashbox published a review of the album which said, "After one duet smash with Porter Wagoner, and another just beginning to make the climb, Dolly Parton makes her first RCA solo flight with this LP. Soaring to some pretty heady heights with a dozen well-chosen tracks, the lark spreads her wings like a veteran, especially on such tracks as "Try Being Lonely" and "You're Gonna Be Sorry", as well as the title track, and can count on some excellent response."

Mark Deming of AllMusic gave the album 4.5 out of 5 stars, calling it "one of Parton's best early albums and a superb showcase for her gifts as both a singer and songwriter." He noted that although there are only four Parton compositions on the album, they are four of the best songs included. He concluded by saying that "the album still sounds like a winner decades after its initial release."
