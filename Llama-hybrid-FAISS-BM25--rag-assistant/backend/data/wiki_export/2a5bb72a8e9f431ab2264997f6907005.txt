Plot
James Vasanthan and his three friends Ganeshan, Charles, and Mohan, have a music troupe that sings at weddings. They are tenants of Subramani whose daughter Lakshmi shares a good rapport with the youths, helping them in their time of need. Her encouragement puts a new zeal in James, who soon gains recognition as a singer. Not that this brings any change in the group's lifestyle, for J. Suresh still shows them as strugglers. James finally proposes to Lakshmi who rejects him, as she has her past to reckon with. She is a divorcee, her husband having abandoned her soon after marriage for his girlfriend. When Lakshmi's friend and neighbour Seetha puts some sense into her, she decides to make amends. But misunderstandings pile up between the lovers – the situations are all forced here – until J. Suresh leads the story to a desired happy ending.

Production
The director J. Suresh initially approached Mani Ratnam to produce the film, but Mani Ratnam refused the script. He however introduced Suresh to R. Madhavan, who was signed on to play the lead role. The film was eventually produced by Sri Sai Deva Productions, a noted Telugu film studio, making their first Tamil film venture. Tips Industries also entered the Tamil film industry as the soundtrack producers for the film.

The film was tentatively titled as Dhool and then as Sugham, whilst actress Sneha made her debut with the film after calling off schedules for her film, Virumbugiren. Telugu comedian Venu Madhav also made his debut in Tamil films with the project. The film was shot across locations in Kerala, Chennai, Ooty, Hyderabad and Gopichettipalayam and the filming was completed within 18 days.

Release
The film opened to predominantly negative reviews, with most critics agreeing that Madhavan had taken a wrong career move after the success of Alaipayuthey. Chennai Online wrote "A routine storyline with the first half reminding one of films like 'Puthu Vasantham' and the twists and turns already twisted many a time in quite a few recent films, 'Ennavale' gives a sense of déjà vu throughout. There is nothing by way of novelty in script or presentation." The Hindu critic revealed that the "reeks of melodrama bogs down even a natural performer like Madhavan". Visual Dasan of Kalki wrote if you are looking for solace other than the fact that you can watch it without cringing even if you go with your family, you can only say Madhavan and Sneha's performance. The film subsequently did not perform well at the box office.

Soundtrack
Soundtrack was composed by S. A. Rajkumar. Chennai Online wrote "Madhavan's first movie in Tamil 'Alai Payuthe' and third, 'Minnale' have good songs but unfortunately his second, 'Ennavale', was a big letdown".
