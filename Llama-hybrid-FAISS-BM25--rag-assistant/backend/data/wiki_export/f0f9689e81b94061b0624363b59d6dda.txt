The Very Best of Jackson Browne is a double-disc compilation album by Jackson Browne, released on March 16, 2004, by Rhino Entertainment and Elektra Records in celebration of Browne's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame a day earlier. It reached number 46 on The Billboard 200.

History 
The previous Browne collection, 1997's The Next Voice You Hear: The Best of Jackson Browne was missing many songs considered essential by fans, such as "Rock Me On the Water" and "Lawyers in Love", as well as tracks from his 1989 album World in Motion. Thus, The Very Best of Jackson Browne is seen by many as the more complete of the two, although it lacks two of Browne's most successful singles, "For America" and "That Girl Could Sing".

Disc 1 encompasses the material from Browne's early career (1972–1977) and Disc 2 contains the material from his later years (1977–2002).

The album was certified as a Gold record in 2006 by the RIAA.

Reception

Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the release, writing "the collection does contain the great majority of Browne's best and best-known material in an attractive, engaging fashion... and for listeners who want a comprehensive overview without purchasing individual albums, this suits the bill nicely."

Nigel Williamson of Uncut wrote "Browne's default mode has always been delicious melancholy, as this double-CD collection proves once again... for a one-stop career retrospective, this is hard to beat."
