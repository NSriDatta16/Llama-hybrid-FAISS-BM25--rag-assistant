History
In the 10th century King Ordoño III of León donated the Vila de Moraria (Moreira de Rei) and Monte Longo to the monastery of Guimarães, founded by the Countess Mumadona.

The territory was effect the Diocese of Braga in the 12th century, and was one of the largest of the seven dioceses, with approximately 950 to 1000 parishes divided into 38 group. During the 1220 Inquirições (Inquiries), the territory of Monte Longo was first identified. This location would have an effect; in 1258, the municipality was designated as the lands and julgado (judicial territory) of Monte Longo.

By 1320, Fafe was part of the Diocese of Braga and the Terra de Entre Ave e Vizela, also known as the Terra de Montelongo, with 15 parishes, among which Santa Ovaia Antiga (Santa Eulália de Fafe).

It was only in 1647 that the first reference to the toponymy Fafe, and shortly thereafter (1655) the parish adopted the name Santa Eulália de Fafe.
