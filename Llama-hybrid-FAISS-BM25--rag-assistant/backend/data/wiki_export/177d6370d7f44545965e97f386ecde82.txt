Drissa Diallo (born 4 January 1973 in Mauritania) is a Guinean former professional footballer who most recently played for Cheltenham Town. Although he holds French nationality, he represented Guinea on eight occasions at international level.

Career
After playing for Sedan, Liege and Denize, Diallo signed for KV Mechelen in 1998. In 2003 Mechelen went into liquidation and Diallo was released on a free transfer. He promptly moved to England and signed for Burnley. Although the Lancashire club were keen to sign Diallo on a long-term deal after he had impressed Stan Ternent during his time at the club, Diallo spent only 5 months in Burnley before Joe Royle swooped to sign him for Ipswich Town at the end of the season. He scored two goals for Burnley, against Fulham in the FA Cup and Gillingham in the league.
