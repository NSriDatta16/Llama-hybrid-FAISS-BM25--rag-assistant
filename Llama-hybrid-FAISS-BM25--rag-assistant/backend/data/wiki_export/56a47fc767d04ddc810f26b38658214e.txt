The Vietnamese Wikipedia () is the Vietnamese-language edition of Wikipedia, a free, publicly editable, online encyclopedia supported by the Wikimedia Foundation. Like the rest of Wikipedia, its content is created and accessed using the MediaWiki wiki software.

Content
As of  , it has about  articles. It is the fifth-largest Wikipedia in a non-European language, as well as the third-largest for a language which is official in only one country. In contrast to the English Wikipedia, the Vietnamese Wikipedia allows bots to create articles: as of 2019, 63% of its articles had been generated in this way.

History
The Vietnamese Wikipedia initially went online in November 2002, with a front page and an article about the Internet Society. The project received little attention and did not begin to receive significant contributions until it was "restarted" in October 2003 and the newer, Unicode-capable MediaWiki software was installed soon after.

By August 2008, the Vietnamese Wikipedia had grown to more than 50,000 articles—of these, approximately 432 of were created by bots. By the time the project reached 100,000 articles on September 12, 2009, bot-generated articles made up around 5% of its corpus. Stubs on the wiki number in the hundreds of thousands, including most of the bot-generated articles.

An experimental Wikipedia edition in the obsolete chữ Nôm script began in October 2006 at the Wikimedia Incubator. It was deleted in April 2010.

The Vietnam Wikimedians User Group supports the development of the Vietnamese Wikipedia and other Vietnamese-language Wikimedia projects. It gained formal recognition as a Wikimedia user group on 28 August 2018.

The wiki reached the 500,000-article milestone on 28 September 2012, and the 1,000,000-article milestone on 15 June 2014.

Software

The Vietnamese Wikipedia uses AVIM, an input method that allows users to type Vietnamese text using popular input methods, such as Telex, VNI, and VIQR, selectable from the sidebar.

Vandalism 
Several Vietnamese newspapers have reported on vandalism committed by users on the wiki, mainly on articles about celebrities.
