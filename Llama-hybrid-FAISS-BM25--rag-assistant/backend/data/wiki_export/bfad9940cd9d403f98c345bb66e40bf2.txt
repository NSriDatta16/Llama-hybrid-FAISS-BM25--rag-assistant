Orgasm is John's Children's sole studio album, projected for release on 18 March 1967, and eventually released in September 1970. It was recorded (before Marc Bolan joined the band) at Advison Studios in London, England. Originally intended as a regular studio album, it was transformed into a fake "live" album by producer Simon Napier-Bell by dubbing audience screams lifted from The Beatles' movie A Hard Day's Night.

According to the liner notes by Chris Donovan in the 1982 Cherry Red Records reissue of the album, its release in the United States was stopped by the Daughters of the American Revolution, who objected to the title. When the album was finally released by White Whale in the U.S., the title "Orgasm" was covered up on the front cover and on the disc label. However, the title was forgotten to be removed from the LP spine, where it remained.

In Australia it was released as simply John's Children.
