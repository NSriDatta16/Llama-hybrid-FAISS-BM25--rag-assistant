In category theory, a branch of mathematics, a presheaf on a category  is a functor . If  is the poset of open sets in a topological space, interpreted as a category, then one recovers the usual notion of presheaf on a topological space.

A morphism of presheaves is defined to be a natural transformation of functors.  This makes the collection of all presheaves on  into a category, and is an example of a functor category. It is often written as .  A functor into  is sometimes called a profunctor.

A presheaf that is naturally isomorphic to the contravariant hom-functor Hom(–, A) for some object A of C is called a representable presheaf.

Some authors refer to a functor  as a -valued presheaf.

Examples 
 A simplicial set is a Set-valued presheaf on the simplex category .

Properties 
 When  is a small category, the functor category  is cartesian closed.
 The poset of subobjects of  form a Heyting algebra, whenever  is an object of  for small .
 For any morphism  of , the pullback functor of subobjects  has a right adjoint, denoted , and a left adjoint, . These are the universal and existential quantifiers.
 A locally small category  embeds fully and faithfully into the category  of set-valued presheaves via the Yoneda embedding which to every object  of  associates the hom functor .
The category  admits small limits and small colimits. See limit and colimit of presheaves for further discussion.
 The density theorem states that every presheaf is a colimit of representable presheaves; in fact,  is the colimit completion of  (see #Universal property below.)

Universal property 
The construction  is called the colimit completion of C because of the following universal property:

Proof: Given a presheaf F, by the density theorem, we can write  where  are objects in C. Then let  which exists by assumption. Since  is functorial, this determines the functor . Succinctly,  is the left Kan extension of  along y; hence, the name "Yoneda extension". To see  commutes with small colimits, we show  is a left-adjoint (to some functor). Define  to be the functor given by: for each object M in D and each object U in C,

Then, for each object M in D, since  by the Yoneda lemma, we have:

which is to say  is a left-adjoint to . 

The proposition yields several corollaries. For example, the proposition implies that the construction  is functorial: i.e., each functor  determines the functor .

Variants 
A presheaf of spaces on an ∞-category C is a contravariant functor from C to the ∞-category of spaces (for example, the nerve of the category of CW-complexes.) It is an ∞-category version of a presheaf of sets, as a "set" is replaced by a "space". The notion is used, among other things, in the ∞-category formulation of Yoneda's lemma that says:  is fully faithful (here C can be just a simplicial set.)
