Capricorn () (, Latin for "horned goats") is the tenth astrological sign in the zodiac out of twelve total zodiac signs, originating from the constellation of Capricornus, the goat. It spans the 270–300th degree of the zodiac, corresponding to celestial longitude.  Under the tropical zodiac, the sun transits this area from around December 22 to January 19.  In astrology, Capricorn is one of the three earth signs along with Virgo and Taurus, an negative sign, and one of the four cardinal signs. Capricorn is ruled by the planet Saturn along with  Aquarius.

Cultural significance 
In India, the zodiac sign of Capricorn is celebrated as the Makara Sankranti festival, also known in Nepal as Maghe Sankranti. The Indian astronomical calendar is not based on the western Gregorian or Julian date keeping system. The Gregorian calendar has fixed days in a year and does not accommodate difference in the actual solar year. Therefore, the festival is celebrated on either of January 14 or 15 every year, when, per the Indian astronomical calendar, the Sun actually enters the Capricorn sign.
