Hopkins High School is a public high school located in Minnetonka, Minnesota, United States. Hopkins High School is part of the Hopkins School District 270.

History
In the 1970s, there were two high schools in the district: Dwight D. Eisenhower Senior High School, named for the former general and U.S. president and Charles A. Lindbergh Senior High School named for the Minnesota native and famed aviator. In 1982, Hopkins closed Eisenhower High School, located in a 1950s-era building along Highway 7, and renamed the remaining school Hopkins Senior High School. The older building was converted to a community center and theater. Later part of the building was converted for use as an elementary school.

Academics 
Hopkins High School was Minnesota's first National School of Excellence. In 1996, Hopkins was the only high school in Minnesota honored for overall excellence in Redbook's "America's Best High Schools" project. The Language Arts Department has been named a "Center for Excellence" by the National Council of Teachers of English in recognition of the writing program. The Community Involvement program is one of six in the nation honored by the IBM Corporation and U.S. News & World Report.
