History
Jangams Sages: claim they originated from a part (thigh) of Lord Shiva's body. According Hinduism "Shiva wanted to give some donation to Brahma and Vishnu but when they refused he became so angry that it led to his creating the Jangam Sages". The Jangam sages go from one place to another and explain the different saints the story of the holy union of Lord Shiva and Parvati. Another version is that Lord Shiva at his wedding created two recipients of his alms, one Jangam, from the sweat of his brow, the other Lingam, from his thigh. According to Hinduism "Shiva had blessed the Jangams with immortality (i.e., entire world is destroyed by nature or some other factors to destroyed the nature, Jangam will Live) but declared that they would live by Religious Begging in Lord Shiva temples (by priest, religious prayer, prayer for healing, and Guru) after some religious event completed by them in Prayer in Hinduism."

Veerashaivism contains two sections, one the ancient race of Veerashaiva jangam (the priests at Srisailam and Kedarnath) and the Lingayat which constitutes all different working classes who later changed their way of life as lingayatism, a sect of Hinduism. They believe in formless god in form of Ista-Linga and no other idol. The Jangam Lingayat are known as Lingayath, True Shivavatari , Movable Lingam, Jangam Sage, Jangama , Lingayat, Jangam Acharya in Lord Shiva temples in Karnataka.

The main names related to the movement are Basavanna, Allama Prabhu, Akka Mahadevi, Dohara Kakkaiyya, Haralayya, Aaydakki Lakkamma and Madara Chennayya. This movement had many philosophies attached to it, example: work is worship 'kayakave kailasa', dignity of labour, gender equality, no caste discrimination, considering one's body as temple, importance to transition, change, movement (bodily worn linga) in contrast to something that is stationary (temple)- 'sthavarakkalivuntu, jangamakkalivilla'.

Jangam Math in Nepal 
In the 9th century, the king Narendra Dev of Lichhivi dynasty has described the Jangam Pratishthan, which is available in stone inscription in Anantlingeshwor temple, in which he has addressed the name of the Chancellor of Jangam Pratisthan and explained rights and duties performed by them. These evidences indicate that Jangam community was present in Nepal before the 9th century. The king of Karnatvansh Shri Nanya Dev became ruler of Mithila state (in Northern Bihar) by dynasty in the 11th century. During the period Veerashaiva Jangam were the Rajaguru of the King Nanya Dev. After ruling the Mithila dynasty for 240 years, King Harisingh Dev Mall became the king of Nepal Mandal and established the capital at Bhaktapur City and there is a Jangam Math. Devi Tula Bhavani was the deity they worshiped and they started spreading the religion of veerashaivism in the region. When Malla dynasty was established in Nepal Mandal Veerashaiva religion had started. It establishes that Veerashaiva religion section of Hinduism had its roots since the 9th century. There is a stone inscription belonging to Nepali Year 692, which explains the role of Hari Singh Dev Mall of mallavansa, who renovated the Jangam math in Bhaktapur. With this, we can say that Veerashiava Religion was established in Nepal in the 13th century.

1.Akbar and the Goswamis of Jangam Bari Math of Benaras1

The Goswamis of Jangam Bari Math of Benaras belonged to the Shaivite sect of South India. This sect had various Shiva Temples at Benaras, Arial, Prayagraj and Gaya. Since its foundation during sixth century A.D., this ancient Math has been enjoying imperial grants and favours. The oldest document of land grant to this math was made by a Hindu Raja, Jainanad Deo, ruler of Kashi in V.S. 631/574 A.D. of 800 paces of land in favour of its head priest Malik Arjun Jangam. Malik Arjun Jangam was the title of the head priest of this Math. This Math attracted the attention of emperor Akbar during 1566 A.D. Akbar issued a farman dated 973 A.H./1565-66 A.D. granting 480 bighas of land in the name of Arjun Jangam the head priest.

2.Jahangir's Relations with Goswami's of Jangambari Math of Benaras2

Jahangir came into contact with Jangamas, when he was in revolt against his father during 45th regnal year of Akbar i.e in 1600 A.D. at Allahabad. He made Allahabad his imperial seat and acted as an independent ruler. During this period he issued a farman to Malik Arjunmal Jangam with the seal of Sultan Salim.
The farman dated Mihr Ilahi 45 R.Y/September, October 1600 A.D. It was addressed to the āmils, jagirdars and karosis of pargana Haveli Banaras, confirming 178 bighas of land as grant in favour of Malik Arjunmal Jangam. It bears the seal of sultan Salim on the top. It also appears from a document that the property rights of the Jangamas were also protected by the Mughal government.

2.Aurangzeb's Relations with Goswami's of Jangambari Math of Benaras3

Aurangzeb carried on the traditions of his forefathers in granting favours to Hindu religious communities, a continuity underscored by his dealings with the Jangam, a Shaivite group. The Jangam benefited from Mughals orders beginning under Akbar, who confirmed their legal rights to land in 1564. The same Jangam received several farmans from Aurangzeb that restored land that had been unfairly confiscated (1667), protected them from a disruptive local Muslim (1672), and returned illegally charged rent (1674).

Jangam Deva in Andhra Pradesh 
Jangam or Jangama is one who is endowed with the true knowledge, sacrificed his life for the society, and avoided all the worldly happiness and attained the divine happiness. Jangam, a Sanskrit word, etymologically means that which moves. When this word applied to a person, in the context of Lingayath religion, it symbolizes a man who moves from place to place preaching moral and religious values in Shaivism, Veerashaivism and Jangama dhyana section of Hinduism.

True Jangam 
Jangams are divided into Virakhtas (celibates), Samanyas (common Jangams), Ganachans (managers), and Mathapatis or Matapathys (Beadles). Pancha peethadhishas represent five faces of Shiva and considered highest class of Jangams, dedicate themselves to celibacy. The Samanya Jangam is the ordinary Jangam who had the initiation performed on him. They live common life, conducts marriages, begs, serves temples or lives by agriculture. When a Jangam goes begging, he wears a garter of bells called Jang below his right knee, and carries a cobra cane. Mathapatis/Matapathys (Beadles) and Ganachans (managers) are Jangams who hold rent-free lands.
 
The two main categories of Jangam are (1_Sthira  and 2_Chara). Sthira Jangama: is a person who, staying in math (mutt) i.e., has to carry on mass education, preaching to the people, and giving them the necessary guidance to achieve spiritual progress called   Jangama dhyana, and to perform certain rituals related to birth, marriage, death and holy communication etc. Chara Jangama is one who constantly moves around, preaching as he goes, without settling at any particular place and without accumulating any property of his own.

Demographic distribution 
The community is distributed throughout India and also in Nepal. However, they form a significant proportion of population in the southern states of India mainly Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab and Gujarat.

Ancient Jangam Tradition
In Jangam community, the male child after the initiation (Ayyachar) will be handed over to the custody of Jangam (Guru). The child will be brought up under the shelter of Jangam (in mutt/math) and by his blessings he, too, can become a Jangam of any of the maths. Jangam priests live in ‘maths’ and guide their followers in Hindu religious and spiritual matters.

Main Tenets of Jangam 
The Linga is tied to the womb in the 8th or 9th month of mother's pregnancy for the prospective child. Linga wearing ceremony to the child is thus performed before the child takes birth.

Lingayath or veerashaiva jangam worship is centred on the Hindu god Shiva as the universal god in the iconographic form of Ishtalinga. The jangam always wear the Ishtalinga held with a necklace. The Istalinga is made up of small blue-black stone coated with fine durable thick black paste of cow dung ashes mixed with some suitable oil to withstand wear and tear. The Ishtalinga is a symbolism for Lord Shiva. It is viewed as a "living, moving" divinity with the devotee. Every day, the devotee removes this personal linga from its box, places it in left palm, offers puja and then meditates about becoming one with the linga, in his or her journey towards the atma-linga.

Veershaiva Jangams celebrate a Hindu festivals, namely, Deepavali, Shivrathi, Ugadi, Nagarpanchmai, Kollipaki Adi Jagadguru and Renukàcharya jayanti etc. Among these festivals Shivratri is an important one. On this day all elderly people observe fast and they perform Bhajanas (Prayer) in praise of 'Lord Shiva'.

Jangam Theology
They wear, Linga on their body, the Linga is always cased in a silver box called 'karadige',  which is tied round the neck by a thread called ‘Shivdhara' They worship the Linga daily after taking bath, smear their forehead with ‘Vibhuti' and do not touch food without offering 'Niyvedya' to the 'Istalinga’. 

The Lingas are divided into two types called "Jangam Linga" and "Sthavaraa Linga".  Further, Lingas are known as Jangama and Sthavara. Jangam or chara Lingas are those that appear on the neck of the Jangam Lingayats who tie a Linga to their neck to their life of Jangam. The Lingas housed in Garbhagrhas and carved on walls of temples belong to Sthvaraa Lingas as mentioned Agama shastra of Veera Saiva Theology.
