Nobleford is a town in southern Alberta, Canada that is approximately  northwest of the City of Lethbridge. It has emerged as a bedroom community of Lethbridge.

History 
The hamlet of Noble was established in 1909. It was named after Charles S. Noble, who owned much land in the area and built many of the local buildings. In 1910, Noble moved his family to the area from Claresholm. The hamlet was renamed Nobleford in 1913, in order to differentiate from a community in Ontario.

On February 28, 1918, Nobleford was incorporated as a village, and its first mayor was Noble. A century later to the day, Nobleford incorporated as a town on February 28, 2018.

A major employer in Nobleford from the 1930s to 1998 was a cultivator factory established by Charles Noble, manufacturing variations of the Noble blade. This reduced-tillage plow was designed to cut weed roots below the soil surface without greatly disturbing the soil, thus minimizing moisture loss in the dry, windy climate of southern Alberta.

Government 
The town is governed by a council comprising a mayor, a deputy mayor, and three councillors.
