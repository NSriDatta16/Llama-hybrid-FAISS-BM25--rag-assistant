History
Midd-West School District was founded in 1970 after the merger of the former West Snyder Area and Middleburg Area School Districts. Two high schools had been maintained despite declining enrollment and significant fiscal challenges. In the 2004-2005 school year, Middleburg High School and West Snyder High School were united to form Midd-West High School. The Midd-West School Board voted to realign the district in response to declining enrollment and education program changes, closing 2 elementary schools, at the end of the 2011-12 school year. Midd-West School District operates Middleburg Elementary School, West Snyder Elementary school, Midd West Middle School, and Midd-West High School. Beaver Adams School and Penns Creek School were closed years ago.

Having consolidated two elementary schools, in 2005 the District sold the Penns Creek and Beaver Adams elementary schools via public auction. In 2012, West Beaver Elementary School and Perry-West Perry Elementary School were closed after a district realignment West Snyder Middle School and Middleburg Middle School closed in 2013.
