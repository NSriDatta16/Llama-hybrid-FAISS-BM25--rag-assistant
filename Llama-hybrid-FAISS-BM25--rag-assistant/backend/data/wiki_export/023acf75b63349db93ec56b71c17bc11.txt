A shelter magazine is a periodical publication with an editorial focus on interior design, architecture, home furnishings, and often gardening.

The term is most often used in the U.S. magazine publishing trade. The earliest example of this "chiefly N[orth] Amer[ican]" meaning recorded by the Oxford English Dictionary is from a New York Times article published on July 3, 1946, in reference to Your Own Home, a "shelter magazine devoted to low-cost housing", which was reported to have gained a new advertising manager.
