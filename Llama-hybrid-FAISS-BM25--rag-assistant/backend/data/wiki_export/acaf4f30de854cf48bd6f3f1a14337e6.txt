Economy
In 2013, Arab-Bedouin women from Lakiya and other Bedouin towns participated in a sewing course for fashion design at the Amal College in Beer Sheva, including lessons on sewing and cutting, personal empowerment and business initiatives.

The Lakiya Negev Weaving Project was founded in 1991 to empower Negev Bedouin women by applying their traditional weaving skills to the manufacture and sale of woven products. It is based on the unique Bedouin heritage passed on from mother to daughter. Approximately 130 Bedouin women are involved  in all the stages of the production from initial wool treatment, weaving the rugs, cushion covers and pouches, and sales. The women were provided with professional guidance and hands-on assistance in  marketing, branding, sales, the business's organizational structure and business plan, fundraising and networking. The aim was to create a  profitable and financially independent cooperative business. Several retailers and chains now sell the goods  in Israel and abroad. 

The Desert Embroidery Project is another women's empowerment program in Lakiya Some 20 women completed their professional entrepreneurial and business training and guidance and initiated a project based on the design and production of the traditional Bedouin costume jewelry. They are producing this embroidery at home with traditional Bedouin motifs and decorations. The women also hold Bedouin embroidery workshops and events based on the Bedouin tradition. Their workshop also serves as a visitors' center.
