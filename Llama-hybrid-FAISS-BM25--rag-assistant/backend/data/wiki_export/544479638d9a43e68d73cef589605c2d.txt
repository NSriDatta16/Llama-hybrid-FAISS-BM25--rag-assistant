Administration
Core district administrators are:
Mary Ellen Walker, superintendent
Amy P. Doherty, business administrator and board secretary

Board of education
The district's board of education, comprised of nine members, sets policy and oversees the fiscal and educational operation of the district through its administration. As a Type II school district, the board's trustees are elected directly by voters to serve three-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with three seats up for election each year held (since 2012) as part of the November general election. The board appoints a superintendent to oversee the district's day-to-day operations and a business administrator to supervise the business functions of the district.

Teachers' union
The Middletown Township Education Association (MTEA) is the Middletown Township teachers' union. The organization is Middletown's local NEA, NJEA MCEA office.

The Middletown School District received national attention in the fall of 2001 when its teachers and secretaries went on strike for the second time in three years.  The strike disrupted classes from November 30 to December 7, 2001, and 228 teachers and secretaries were jailed in alphabetical order for violating a court back-to-work order. After the strike, members of the MTEA successfully lobbied to change the state law to prohibit school boards from imposing a contract on their employees (signed into law July 10, 2003). The union, with over 1,200 members, had elected Diane Swaim president since 1983, and re-elected her in May 2007. Swaim retired on January 1, 2008, and was replaced by the first vice-president, Linda McLaughlin  There has not been a strike since 2001. The union and board of education amicably settled the next contract (July 1, 2004 – June 30, 2007) in April 2004, months before the expiration of the old contract. The union and board reached a new contract settlement without acrimony for 2007–2010.

Armed officer in each school 
On May 31, 2022, following the mass shooting in Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, the school board unanimously voted to have a police officer in each school at the hourly rate of $50 until the end of the 2021–2022 school year. For the 2022–2023 school year, a Class III special law enforcement officer would be at every school in the district, at an hourly rate not to exceed $35.
