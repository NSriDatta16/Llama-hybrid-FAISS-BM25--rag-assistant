History
The Indiana State Highway Commission authorized a state road following modern SR 109, between Columbia City and Wolf Lake, in 1934. Construction started in 1935 on the authorized segment with it being completed by 1942. A segment of state road was commissioned, between Knightstown and the Hancock–Madison County line, in March 1940. This section of roadway was originally planned as SR 7, but became a southern segment of SR 109. The northern end of the southern segment was moved north to SR 32 in Anderson in July 1941. Between late 1950 and early 1951 the northern end of the southern segment was moved north to an intersection with SR 9, just north of Anderson. The southern end of the northern segment was moved north to an intersection with the new alignment of US 30, just north of Columbia City, in late 1970 or early 1971. A new alignment for SR 109, from south of US 36 to Anderson, was constructed between 1997 and 1999.
