Los Fugitivos (The Fugitives) is an American grupero band. They formed the band in 1985 as Grupo Kariño with brothers Jaime and Edi Espinoza. But in 1991, with the addition singer/guitarist Roberto Nieto, the band became Los Fugitivos. The band's first hits were covers, including "Esperando Por Ti," which was a Spanish-language version of Richard Marx's "Right Here Waiting." In 1993, the band scored their biggest hit with José Luis Perales' "La Loca," which landed them on the Billboard Hot Latin Tracks chart, climbing all the way to number 3. In 1998, they had a hit with another cover, Roberto Carlos' "Pajaro Herido," which appeared on their album Secretos. In 1999, Nieto was replaced by Hekar Rivero, and that same year the band left PolyGram and signed with Sony Discos, who issued their album "Mi Última Tentación" soon afterwards. Los Fugitivos have recorded 10 albums,  earning seven gold records and two platinum albums.
