Noordwelle is a village in the Dutch province of Zeeland. It is a part of the municipality of Schouwen-Duiveland, and lies about 5Â km southwest of Scharendijke.

The village was first mentioned in 1109 as Willa, and means well. Noord (north) has been added to distinguish from the former village Zuidwelle. Noordwelle is a circular village around a church which is surrounded by moat. It developed near a 13th century castle which was lost in a flood in the 15th or 16th century. In 1575, Noordwelle was in Spanish hands and liberated by the Dutch States Army on 14 January 1576.

The Dutch Reformed church is a single-aisled church. The tower dates from around 1450. The church was destroyed by war in 1576, and rebuilt slightly bigger in the 17th century. The choir was converted into a school in 1859. In the early 1960s, the school parts were demolished.

Noordwelle was home to 392 people in 1840. It was a separate municipality until 1961, when it was merged with Westerschouwen. In 1997, it became part of the municipality of Schouwen-Duiveland.
