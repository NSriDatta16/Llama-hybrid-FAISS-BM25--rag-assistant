The Sweden–GDR Association () was a Sweden-based organization, formed on 23 October 1956 to promote ties between Sweden and the German Democratic Republic (GDR or East Germany). The association published the journal DDR-revyn.

The association was typically seen as pro-communist and ceased to exist in January 1991, following the collapse of GDR.
