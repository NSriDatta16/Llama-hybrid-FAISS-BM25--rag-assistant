The University of the Balearic Islands (, UIB;  ) is a Balearic Spanish university, founded in 1978 and located in Palma on the island of Majorca. The university is funded by the autonomous Government of the Balearic Islands.

History
The origins of the University date back to 1483, when King Ferdinand II of Aragon authorized the foundation of the  in Palma, Majorca. This college was named after the philosopher and writer Ramon Llull (1232–1315). It operated until 1835 when it was closed following intense debate.

After 1835, students from the Balearic Islands attended university in mainland Spain, in Cervera and subsequently in Barcelona. There was no higher education institution in the Balearic Islands until 1949, when the Estudi General Lul·lià was reinstituted under the auspices of the University of Barcelona. This initially offered courses in philosophy and philology, which were recognized by the University of Barcelona. The faculties of Science and Arts were added in 1972 (attached to the Autonomous University of Barcelona and to the University of Barcelona respectively), followed by the Faculty of Law.

The faculties of the Estudi General Lul·lià were separated from their sponsoring universities in 1978, forming the University of Palma.

Work on a new campus began in 1983, on the road from Palma to Valldemossa. This was a controversial choice; there was an alternative location near to the original Faculty of Sciences in Palma. In 1998 additional sites were opened in Ibiza and in Alaior, Menorca.

In 1985 the name was changed to the current University of the Balearic Islands.

The School of Tourism was added in 1993, the Faculty of Education in 1992, and the School of Psychology and the Polytechnic School in 2000.

Since 1996 the University has been funded by the Government of the Balearic Islands.

Campus 
Construction of the UIB campus began in 1983 on private land located next to the Valldemossa road, between the former possessions of Ca's Jai and Son Lledó, in the municipality of Palma. This decision led to the separation of the university from the city. For a long time, the only way to access the campus was by car or by the  bus service from Palma. The road was later improved, speeding up traffic coming from the capital and providing a pedestrian and bicycle lane. In 2005, work began on a Metro line to the train station in central Palma. The Metro was operational in April 2007 and was the first line of its kind in the Balearic Islands.

The campus has been fully operational since 1993. In that year, all Palma urban area studies were centralised at the University of the Balearic Islands. Currently all the administrative services and faculties are located on the campus, although the Sa Riera building in Palma still remains. Buildings on the campus are named after important figures in Balearic society including Ramon Llull, Mathieu Orfila, , Anselm Turmeda, , , Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos and Arxiduc Lluís Salvador.

The University also has campuses in Ibiza and in Alaior, Menorca. These locations provide tuition in Business Administration and Management, Law, Nursing, Education and Tourism.

Rapid transit line
The university campus is connected with the city center through the Palma metro line M1 (13 minutes) and the bus line 19 (22 minutes).

The UIB metro station was inaugurated on April 25, 2007, but was closed later that year due to structural problems caused by flooding. Nowadays, it operates with regularity every 15 minutes.
