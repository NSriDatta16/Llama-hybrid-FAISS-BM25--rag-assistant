History

18th, 19th, and 20th centuries
The Urbana area was first settled in 1730.

Urbana is the site of Landon House, which was built in 1754 along the Rappahannock River around Fredericksburg, Virginia. It was used as a seminary for girls. In 1840, Landon House was moved by boat to Washington and then by oxcarts to its present site in Urbana. Landon House later served as a military academy and a hospital during the Civil War. Confederate General J.E.B. Stuart's officers held a dance at Landon House in 1862. During the dance, Union cavalry advanced on the house, but the Confederate military drove the Union forces away and the dance continued.

Zion Episcopal Church was built in 1802 and served as a house of worship until badly damaged by fire in 1961. Since 2005, it has been restored to its original condition as a museum. Amelung House and Glassworks were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Stancioff House was listed in 1975, and Fat Oxen in 1979.
