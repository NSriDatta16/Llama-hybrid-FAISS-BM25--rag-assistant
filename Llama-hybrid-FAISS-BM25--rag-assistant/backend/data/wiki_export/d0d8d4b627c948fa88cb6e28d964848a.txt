The Colorado Medical Society (CMS) is the largest group of organized physicians in Colorado.This nonprofit organization is composed of physicians, residents and medical students.  It was founded in 1871 to promote the art and science of medicine and to improve public health. Projects include a congress for health care reform, a technology fair, and lobbying for legislation to improve the health of the State's citizenry.

The Territorial Medical Society was established on September 19, 1871, when physicians from across the territory attended a meeting in a Denver district courtroom.
