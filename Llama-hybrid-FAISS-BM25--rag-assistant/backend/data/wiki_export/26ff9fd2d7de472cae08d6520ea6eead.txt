He was the second leading rusher with 387 yards and a 5.2 yards per carry average despite missing four games after dislocating his right elbow in the first quarter of the season opener against North Carolina. Washington's punt return for a touchdown against Wake Forest was the first by a Seminole since Peter Warrick's 59-yard return against Virginia Tech in the 2000 Sugar Bowl. He rushed for a season-high 121 yards on 17 carries against NC State, the highest total by a Florida State running back during the season. He scored the game-winning touchdown in the second overtime against the North Carolina Wolfpack on a 12-yard run to clinch the Seminole's 11th ACC Championship in 12 years as a league member. Washington rushed for 69 yards on 13 carries in Florida State's victory over Virginia and 65 yards on 15 carries in the Seminoles' victory over Florida.

During his junior year in 2004, Washington earned the Gator Bowl Most Valuable Player honors with 12 rushes for a career-high 195 yards in the Seminoles' victory over West Virginia. His 16.3 yards per rush is a single-game Florida State record while his 195 yards is the second most by a Seminole player in a bowl game.

Professional football career

New York Jets
Washington was selected in the fourth round (117th overall) of the 2006 NFL Draft. The pick used was obtained by the Jets from the Kansas City Chiefs, as compensation for the release of former Jets head coach Herman Edwards.

Washington gained some attention in his second preseason game, returning a kickoff 87 yards for a touchdown against the Washington Redskins. Nonetheless, he did not immediately get many carries in the first few weeks of the regular season. However, as the Jets running game struggled in the first few weeks, his role in the offense increased. He first showcased his ability on a 47-yard reception Week 3 in Buffalo. Two weeks later in Jacksonville, he recorded his first 100-yard rushing game, running for 101 yards in a Jets 41–0 loss.

On October 22 at home against Detroit, Leon ran for 129 yards for two touchdowns and led the Jets' to a 31–24 win. In a game in Miami on Christmas night, Washington had 108 receiving yards including a 64-yard reception to set up the game-winning field goal in a 13–10 win. He helped the Jets clinch the fifth playoff spot in the AFC on New Year's Eve 2006 with a touchdown run that helped to seal a win against the Oakland Raiders in the final game of the 2006 regular season. He finished the regular season with 650 yards rushing and four touchdowns on 151 attempts. He averaged 4.3 yards-per-carry. In an AFC East game, he returned a kick 92 yards for a touchdown against the New England Patriots in 2008. Washington gained 2,317 all-purpose yards in 2008, more than any other running back in the NFL.

In a Week 9 game against the Buffalo Bills on November 2, 2008, Washington made a play as a kick returner when he noticed a kickoff was headed out of bounds at the 8-yard line. When he saw the ball would stay in bounds, Washington straddled the sideline and then put his hand on the ball. The officials initially spotted the ball at the 8-yard line before Washington reminded them that, according to the rulebook, the ball is out of bounds when a player standing out of bounds touches it, meaning the correct call was Illegal procedure. This gave the Jets the ball at the 40-yard line, a 32-yard gain in field position.

Washington was selected as AFC Special teams Player of the Week for Week 11 of the 2008 season, the first such award in his career. His 92-yard touchdown was the fourth kick return touchdown of his career, surpassing Justin Miller for the club record. He led the league in all-purpose yards in 2008 with 1606 yards.

Washington was out for the 2009 season with a compound fracture to his fibula that he suffered in Week 7 in a 38–0 shutout win versus the Oakland Raiders. Prior to his season-ending injury, Washington had rushed for 331 yards on 72 carries, with a 4.6 yards/carry average. Washington had yet to score in 2009 prior to his injury. The Jets call their wildcat formation "Seminole" because Washington lined up at quarterback, and was a Florida State Seminole.

On April 15, 2010 (the NFL free agent deadline), Washington signed his tendered contract with the Jets for one year, worth $1.759 million.

Seattle Seahawks
On April 24, 2010, Washington was traded to the Seattle Seahawks for a fifth-round draft pick in the 2010 NFL Draft. He was assigned the number 33 on his new team;  29 went to first-round draft pick Earl Thomas. During the September 26, 2010, game against the San Diego Chargers, Washington set a Seahawks record with 2 kickoff return touchdowns. He returned the opening kickoff of the 2nd half for a team record 101 yards, then in the 4th quarter he ran 99 yards for his second kickoff touchdown of the game. On March 1, 2011, Washington signed a four-year deal worth $12.5 million to stay with the Seattle Seahawks. Due to the signing of wide receiver Percy Harvin, Leon Washington was released by the Seahawks on March 12, 2013.

Personal

Washington's 2006 Bowman "Signs of the Future" card with the Jets caused a great deal of controversy during the third week of November 2006, in which it appears that he is making an obscene gesture. The card sold on eBay during that time for more than four times its book value. Washington insists his gesture is a popular hand gesture among his friends in his hometown.

Leon Washington Foundation

Washington established a charitable organization called the Leon Washington Foundation whose mission it is to assist low-income families in the Jacksonville, Florida area with education, sports, and life skills. The Foundation provides programs intended to enlighten, inspire, and educate underprivileged youths to live stronger, healthier, and more productive lives. A major annual event is the Leon Washington Football Camp, which provides a one-day, non-contact football clinic run by current and former NFL players and local volunteers free of charge to youth from Jacksonville and the surrounding region.
