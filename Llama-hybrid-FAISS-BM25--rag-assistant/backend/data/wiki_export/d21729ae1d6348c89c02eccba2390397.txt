Clothing industry
Historically there was a lot of trade between Isfjorden and the northern county of Nordland. Shoes and clothing were produced in practically every home, and eventually several factories were established. This earned Isfjorden the label "the cradle of the Norwegian clothing industry". One of the factories, "Oddfred Tokles konfeksjonsfabrikk", has been turned into a museum.
