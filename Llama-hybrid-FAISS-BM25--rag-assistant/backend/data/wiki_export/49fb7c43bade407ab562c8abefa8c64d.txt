"Evergreen" (also called "Love Theme from A Star Is Born") is the theme song from the 1976 film A Star Is Born. It was composed and performed by American singer, songwriter, actress and director Barbra Streisand with lyrics by Paul Williams, and arranged by Ian Freebairn-Smith. The song was released on the soundtrack album to A Star Is Born.

Background
As composers, Streisand and Williams earned an Academy Award for Best Original Song, making Streisand the first woman to be so honored as a composer. She also earned a Grammy Award for Song of the Year. Streisand and Williams also won Golden Globes for Best Original Song.

The song's opening couplet, "Love, soft as an easy chair; love, fresh as the morning air", almost did not appear that way.  Williams wrote the "morning air" line first, but told Streisand to "flip those two first lines, because it sings better".

Record World said that "Barbra is in fine voice."

In 1997, the track appeared on the tribute album Diana, Princess of Wales: Tribute.

Chart performance
In the US, the single became Streisand's second number 1 single and spent three weeks at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 and six weeks atop the easy listening chart. This was Streisand's second number-one song on the Hot 100 (following "The Way We Were" in 1974), and her third on the adult contemporary chart ("The Way We Were" and 1964's "People"). In its year-end chart for 1977, Billboard ranked the platinum-certified single, which sold more than 2 million copies, the fourth-biggest single of the year. In the UK Singles Chart, the song peaked at #3 in 1977.
