Max Mara (Italian [maks 'ma:ra]) is an Italian fashion business. It markets up-market ready-to-wear clothing. It was established in 1951 in Reggio Emilia by Achille Maramotti (7 January 1927 – 12 January 2005). In March 2008, the company had 2,254 stores in 90 countries. It sponsors the Max Mara Art Prize for Women.

History
Founded in 1951 by Achille Maramotti in Reggio Emilia, the fashion house was initially named Confezioni Maramotti with the aim of introducing American industrial processes into European tailoring culture, thus creating Italian pret-a-porter.

In 1957, the company expanded and moved to its new headquarters designed by industrial architect Eugenio Salvarani, changing its name to Max Mara. "Max" is a superlative, while "Mara" is a diminutive form of the founder's surname.

Achille Maramotti chose the men's coat as an iconic garment for women's wardrobes, and in the 1960s, Max Mara established its creative studio to research the expression and personalization of outerwear.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Max Mara began collaborating with international designers such as Anne-Marie Beretta, Emmanuelle Khanh, Karl Lagerfeld, Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, Narciso Rodriguez, Proenza Schouler, as well as fashion photographers including Richard Avedon, Arthur Elgort, Steven Meisel, Sarah Moon, Max Vadukul, Mario Sorrenti, David Sims, and Craig McDean.

During the same period, Max Mara also introduced the Manuela coat, made of pure camel hair with a notched collar, side pockets, wrap-around closure, and a belt. It has since become a distinctive outerwear piece for the fashion house.

In 1981, French designer Anne-Marie Beretta created the model 101801 coat, a camel-coloured wool and cashmere overcoat that became an iconic symbol of Max Mara. Inspired by the men's Ulster coat, the most noticeable feature of this model is the "puntino," a stitching detail derived from men's tailored suits.

In 1989, the MM Magazine was launched, a biannual fashion and lifestyle publication distributed in the brand's stores and selected multi-brand retailers.

In 2003, Max Mara relocated to its new campus in Reggio Emilia on Via Giulia Maramotti, designed by John McAslan & Partners.

In 2012, Max Mara received the "Brand Heritage Award" from the global association Fashion Group International during the FGI's 29th Annual Night of Stars in New York.

In 2013, the brand presented the Teddy Bear coat on the Autumn/Winter runway, made of alpaca wool and silk with a faux fur effect, inspiring a series of imitations.

In 2015, Max Mara collaborated with Renzo Piano Building Workshop to create the Whitney Bag for the opening of the new Whitney Museum of American Art in New York's Meatpacking District.

Brands
Max Mara has spawned 35 labels, although Max Mara womenswear, usually stylized as MaxMara, remains the core of the company. Other brands include Sportmax, Sportmax Code, Weekend Max Mara, Marella, Pennyblack, iBlues, MAX&Co. (the trendy, youth division), and Marina Rinaldi. This last, founded in 1980 and named after Achille Maramotti's great grandmother, is one of the best-known: in her obituary of Maramotti for The Independent.

As of 17 July 2013, Jennifer Garner is the first celebrity spokesperson for Max Mara.

Starting in September 2013, the campaign appears in Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, Elle, W, InStyle, The New York Times, and the International Herald Tribune.

Family
Achille Maramotti was born on 7 January 1927, in Reggio Emilia in Italy. Maramotti was educated in Rome and received a law degree from the University of Parma. According to the Forbes Rich List of 2005, Maramotti was one of the world's richest men with a fortune of US$2.1 billion.

He died in Albinea, Italy on 12 January 2005. Maramotti's two sons and daughter, Luigi, Ignazio and Ludovica, followed him into the business; Luigi Maramotti is chairman of the company. After his death, according to Maramotti's will, a large and important collection of contemporary art from Europe and America was made open to the public.
