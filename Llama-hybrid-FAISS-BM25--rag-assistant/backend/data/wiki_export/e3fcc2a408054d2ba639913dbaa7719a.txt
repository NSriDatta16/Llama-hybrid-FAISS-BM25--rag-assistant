The 66th Armor Regiment is the oldest armored unit in the United States Army, tracing its lineage to the 301st Tank Battalion which served with distinction soon after it was formed in the First World War; the 301st trained at Camp Meade, Maryland, where then Cpt. Dwight D. Eisenhower was an instructor.  It has often been rumored that the 301st, the parent unit of the 66th, was first commanded by Col. George S. Patton, but this appears not to have been the case; while Patton was the first officer assigned to the Tank Corps, and while the 301st Tank Battalion was the first unit formed, Patton went nearly immediately to France to train Americans attached to Allied commands. The 301st was the only American heavy tank battalion to have seen action in the war.  After the war, the 301st transitioned in the Regular Army to become the 66th Infantry Regiment (Light Tanks) by way of the 16th Tank Battalion.

Current disposition
Two battalions of the regiment are still in service in the Regular Army.
1–66 AR is assigned to the 3rd Brigade Combat Team of the 4th Infantry Division at Ft. Carson. The First Battalion has participated in combat operations in Operation Iraqi Freedom and in Operation Enduring Freedom.
3–66 AR is assigned to the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division (United States), garrisoned at Ft Riley, Kansas. The Third Battalion has participated in combat operations in Operation Iraqi Freedom and in Operation Enduring Freedom. Burt’s Knights most recently deployed to Europe in support of Operation Atlantic Resolve and following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Operation European Assure, Deter, and Reinforce.

History

World War I
The 1st and 2nd Provisional Brigades of the United States Tank Corps would eventually go on to provide the original cadre for what would become the 66th Armored Regiment in World War II. In September 1918 both brigades – which were attached to the 1st Infantry Division in France – participated in the battle of St. Mihiel and the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, operating French-built Renault FT tanks. Five days before the Armistice with Germany, the brigades were renamed respectively the 304th and 305th Brigades, Tank Corps on 6 November 1918.

The casualties in the unit led General John J. Pershing to say: "The percentage of casualties among the officers and men tells the tale of splendid morale and gallantry in action and their unselfish devotion to duty". The regiment's Organization Day was chosen as 12 September to commemorate its baptism of fire at St. Mihiel.

The Headquarters and Headquarters Companies (HHC) of the 304th and 305th Tank Brigades transferred in 1919 to Camp Meade, Maryland, and consolidated on 22 June 1921, reorganized and redesignated as HHC, 1st Tank Group. This organization reorganized and was redesignated HHC, 1st Tank Regiment, on 1 September 1929, as the 66th Infantry Regiment (Light Tanks) on 25 October 1932. In 1936 and 1937, Bruce Magruder commanded the 66th Infantry Regiment at Camp Meade, Maryland. When the regiment received its first two light tanks, unit members decided to name one for Magruder, and his wife took part in the christening ceremony. As the 66th Armored Regiment, on 15 July 1940, the organization become part of the newly formed 2nd Armored Division, stationed at Fort Benning, Georgia.

World War II
In December 1942, the regiment was part of the amphibious invasion of Morocco in North Africa and led the division's entry into Casablanca. The regiment next participated in the invasion of Sicily. 

On 10 June 1944 (D+4), the three battalions of the regiment landed on Gold Beach in Normandy. Four days later the regiment (as part of Combat Command A of the 2nd Armored Division) fought through elements of the German 6th Fallschirmjäger Regiment of the 2nd Fallschirmjäger Division and elements of the 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division southwest of Carentan, France at the Battle of Bloody Gulch. Later progress was also initially difficult in combat against elements of the newly arrived 116th Panzer Division and surviving elements of the Panzer Lehr Division. In a difficult battle in the streets of the village of Percy and on surrounding high ground on 30 July, against some of the eight Panthers Generalleutnant Fritz Bayerlein had found and rallied from workshops at neighboring Villebaudon on 28 July, the 3/66th was to lose 13 tanks and was forced to pull out of the city losing another five tanks outside Centry to heavy Nebelwerfer and other mortar fire. On 31 July 3/66th was down to only 24 operational tanks. The regiment fought across France to the German border with the rest of the division and the U.S. Third Army, but was diverted north to counter the German advance during the Battle of the Bulge, assisting in the destruction of the 2nd Panzer Division and capturing Houffalize, Belgium.

On 14 June 1944, just after arriving in France, the Regiment was reorganized to align with newer armored division structure. While the regimental designation was retained, companies were formally aligned with battalions. For example, the 1st Battalion no longer had companies A, B, and C, instead now it had Company C (M5 Stuart) and Companies F and I (M4 Sherman). 2nd Battalion received Company A (M5) and kept Companies D and E (M4). 3rd Battalion gained Company B (M5) and maintained Companies G and H (M4). The regiment would fight with this organization for the remainder of the war.

The regiment was twice cited in the Order of the Day of the Belgian Army. Captain James M. Burt, the commander of B Company, 66th Armored Regiment, was awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroism during the Battle of Aachen in October 1944. Captain Burt later served as Honorary Colonel of the Regiment.

Cold War
Following the war, elements of the 66th and other units of the 2nd Armored Division were selected to occupy the American sector of Berlin and serve as the first American troops to enter the fallen German capital.

During the Korean War, an offspring of the 66th fought under the designation "6th Tank Battalion". During the war, the sixth won seven battle streamers and the Korean Presidential Unit Citation. These honors were awarded to the 66th Armored Regiment when the 6th Tank Battalion was inactivated after the conflict.

Throughout the Cold War, the four battalions of the regiment served in the 2nd Armored Division at Ft. Hood, Texas, and as part of the 2nd Armored Division (Forward) in the Federal Republic of Germany.

Desert Storm
In 1991, during Operation Desert Storm, the regiment assisted in the liberation of Kuwait and the defeat of the Iraqi army. The 2nd and 3rd battalions of the regiment, stationed in Germany as part of the 2nd Armored Division (Forward), deployed and fought under the operational control of the 1st Infantry Division as part of Task Force 1-41 Infantry. The 4th Battalion, along with the 3d (Phantom) Brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division, was attached to the 1st Armored Division. The 2nd and 3rd battalions served in the Battle of 73 Easting and the Battle of Norfolk. The Phantom Brigade became the 1st Armor's lead brigade for VII Corps' "left hook" to smash the Iraqi Republican Guard divisions. It served in the largest tank battle in American history at the Battle of Medina Ridge.

In the spring of 1995, the 1st Battalion of the 66th was assigned to assist over 5,000 Cuban and Haitian refugees interned at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

Global War on Terror
The 1st and 3rd Battalions deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. 3–66 Armor was deployed to Operation Iraqi Freedom for 2003–2004 and 1-66 Armor deployed shortly after 3-66 Armor to Operation Iraqi Freedom from 2003-2004 as well. 1-66 Armored Regiment also deployed to Operation Iraqi Freedom from 2005–2006 and again in 2008–2009. This was the last tour of duty for 1-66 Armor BN while stationed at Fort Hood, Texas, before relocating to Fort Carson, Colorado.  1–66 Armor BN was then deployed to Operation Enduring Freedom from 2010–2011, as part of the surge in the volatile Arghandab River Valley west of Kandahar City in RC-South. 3–66 Armor BN was recently deployed to Operation Enduring Freedom from 2011–2012 to Paktika Province in RC-East.

Coat of arms
Shield: Tierced in pairle reversed gules, azure, and or, in dexter chief an escutcheon azure semé-de-lys or charged with saltire of the last; overall, a label of three points argent
Crest: On a wreath of the three colors a wyvern couchant reguardant to sinister argent, grasping in its dexter claw a pine tree inverted and eradicated proper, and charged on its neck with a label of three points azure
Motto: "Semper in Hostes" (Always into the enemy).
Symbolism: The coat of arms was originally approved for the 15th Tank Battalion, part of which was in the old 304th Tank Brigade. Therefore, the shield and crest of the 304th Tank Brigade are used with the label added for difference. The shield is of the colors of the Tank Corps shoulder sleeve insignia. The Brigade was organized at Langres, France, in 1918, and the arms of Langres are shown on an escutcheon with the saltire changed from red to gold for difference. The wyvern is from the original insignia of the French Tank Corps. The uprooted pine tree commemorates the activities of the brigade in the Argonne Forest during the Meuse-Argonne operations.

In popular culture 
 Sherman tanks of the 66th Armor Regiment come to the aid of the soldiers of Easy Company in Carentan, the third episode of the HBO mini-series Band of Brothers. On 13 June 1944, Easy Company was in defensive positions after capturing Carentan, France. A German counterattack by SS-panzer troops and Luftwaffe fallschirmjager threatened to overrun the US troops. The ensuing depiction of the Battle of Bloody Gulch, accurately depicts how tanks from Combat Command A of the 2nd Armored Division arrived at a critical point in the battle, inflicted severe casualties on the German attackers and forced their withdrawal.
 The 2014 film Fury depicts armored combat in April, 1945 Germany, and the danger to Allied tank crews posed by SS, Hitlerjugend and Wehrmacht troops armed with Panzerfaust rocket-propelled grenades and the Panzerschreck bazooka. Brad Pitt and his -E8 Sherman tank crew belong to the 66th Armored Regiment. This is identifiable both by the soldiers' distinctive 2nd Armored Division uniform patch and by the 66th Armored Regiment bumper numbers painted on the Sherman tank featured in the film. While the storyline is fictional, the depiction of Fury and its commander Wardaddy parallels the experience of several real Allied tankers, such as the American tank commander Staff Sergeant Lafayette G. "War Daddy" Pool. However, SSG Poole served in the 3rd Armored Division, rather than the 2nd.
