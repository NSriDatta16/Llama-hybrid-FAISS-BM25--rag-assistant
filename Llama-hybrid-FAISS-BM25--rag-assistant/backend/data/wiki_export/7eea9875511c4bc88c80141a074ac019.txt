Out of the Blue is the debut studio album by American singer-songwriter Debbie Gibson, released on August 18, 1987, by Atlantic Records. The album received favorable reviews from music critics and sold more than three million copies in the United States (three times platinum by RIAA) and five million copies worldwide.

Background
Gibson (who was then 16 years old) wrote all ten songs on this album, which reveals her very early talent for composing. As executive producer, Douglas Breitbart of Broadbeard Productions, Inc. (whom Gibson's mother had hired as manager five years before), assembled a team of producers from both New York and Florida:  Fred Zarr, John Morales, Sergio Munzibai and Lewis A. Martineé.

Zarr produced "Shake Your Love" and "Fallen Angel" in addition to "Only in My Dreams," and co-produced "Out of the Blue," "Staying Together" and "Wake Up to Love" with Gibson, sole producer for "Foolish Beat."  Morales and Munzibai produced "Red Hot" and "Between the Lines."  Martineé produced "Play the Field".

While posing for the album cover, Gibson was told by the photographer that her knee was pulling focus; as a compromise, the makeup artist drew a face on her knee. This became a fashion trend among girls who attended her concerts.

Out of the Blue made No. 7 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart and No. 26 on the UK Albums Chart. The album sold over three million copies in the United States, and five million copies worldwide.

Reissues
Out of the Blue was included in the 2017 box set We Could Be Together, with six remixes as bonus tracks.

A special four-disc digipack edition was released by Cherry Red Records on October 15, 2021. This release includes two remix CDs and a DVD containing the album's five music videos, the live video Live in Concert: The "Out of the Blue" Tour, and a special interview video.
