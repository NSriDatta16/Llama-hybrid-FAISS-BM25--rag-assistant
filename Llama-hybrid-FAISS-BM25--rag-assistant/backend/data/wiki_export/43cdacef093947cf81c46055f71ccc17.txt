Over the yellow field, a green circle, representing the abundant vegetation and three blue fesses separated from each other to represent the rivers that cross the Bolívar State.

In the central blue fess, eight white five-pointed stars, located horizontally. Seven of them represent the seven provinces that together declared the Venezuelan independence and the eight that constitutes the emblem of the Guayana Province.

In the first canton (up and left) the coat of arms of the Bolivar State will be located.
