Big Deal is a British comedy-drama television series originally broadcast by the BBC between 1984 and 1986. The series was created and written by Geoff McQueen, who created several other major television series including Give Us a Break, Stay Lucky, and The Bill.

Starring Ray Brooks, Sharon Duce and Lisa Geoghan, the series concentrated on the ups and downs of small-time London gambler Robbie Box (played by Brooks) and the effect that his poker addiction has on his long suffering girlfriend Jan Oliver (Duce) and her daughter Debby (Geoghan).

The theme music was by Bucks Fizz member Bobby G.
