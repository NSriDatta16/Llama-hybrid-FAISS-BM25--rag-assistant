History
Third division
C.D. Vista Hermosa was founded on 17 April 1999, by José Gilberto Flores (Paquito Flores). The club's first president was José Gilberto Montoya. He retired for health reasons on 28 December 2000. Pedro Hernandez became the next president who was supported by the club's staff and supporters.

When Hernandez became president, the club was in the third division of Salvadoran soccer. The team was contending for a place in the finals game but lost to Gerardo Barrios University, three points to two. In light of the club's good performance in the third division, Francisco Benitez made an offer to purchase the club for 5,000 Salvadoran colon, approximately 560.85 US dollars. The offer was rejected as being too low. However, in the following season, the club performed poorly and finances were mismanaged. Lacking patrons and sponsors, the club was left in debt to an amount of two billion colon. The club was relegated to the fourth division. On 1 December 2001, Benitez purchased the club for 3,000 colon and became the new president.

A payment of 2,000 colon by Benitez in December 2003 secured the club a place in the second division in the 20032004 season.

However, after one season, the mayor of Nueva Guadalupe purchased the license outright, broke all links to the original Vista Hermosa, and started a new club in Nuevo Guadalpue called C.D. Guadalupano. Vista Hermosa ceased to exist after 12 years of existence, 11 of which were played in La Primera.

C.D. Guadalupano first competed in the 2013–14 Segunda División de Fútbol Salvadoreño, but also ceased operation, in 2015.
