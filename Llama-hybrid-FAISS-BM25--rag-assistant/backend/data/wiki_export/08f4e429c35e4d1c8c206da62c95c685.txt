The Family Medicine Residency Program
The Family Medicine Residency Program has been in existence for 30 years and was founded by Dr. Melvin B. Dyster, M.D., who was active in the program until he died in April 2021. It is affiliated with the Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine and operates under the direction of Jeffrey O. Burnett, D.O.

Family Medicine is the only residency program Memorial offers. The program's faculty members are interested in research and have published in the areas of patient safety, residency training and working with underserved populations.

At Niagara Falls Memorial, residents work closely with board certified physicians and faculty members.
