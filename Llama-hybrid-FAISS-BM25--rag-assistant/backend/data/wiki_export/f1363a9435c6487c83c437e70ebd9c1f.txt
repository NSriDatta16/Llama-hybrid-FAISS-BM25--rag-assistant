Hong Kong Football Club Stadium (), nicknamed The Jungle, is a multi-purpose stadium located in Happy Valley, Hong Kong inside the oval of Happy Valley Racecourse. The main pitch is used for football and rugby (union) matches, and there is an adjoining hockey pitch. The playing surface has been synthetic since 2004. The pitch is also used for Youth football and Rugby teams. These teams train on the pitch on Saturdays and Sundays. Some teams also train on the Training Triangle, which is next to the main pitch.

The stadium, privately owned by the Hong Kong Football Club, holds 2,750 people and hosts the annual Hong Kong Tens tournament and the HKFC International Soccer Sevens tournament.

History 
The original HKFC Stadium on Sports Road was the venue for the world-famous Hong Kong Sevens from its inception in 1976 until it outgrew its home and was moved to the Hong Kong Government Stadium (now the Hong Kong Stadium) in 1982. The original stadium was built in 1954 and demolished in 1995 and was located northeast, adjacent to the racecourse.

The stadium's home attendance record is 1,720, reached during the HKFC's defeat against Kitchee on 26 February 2023.
