Jobe was born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. He attended UCLA where he was a member of the 1988 NCAA Division I Men's Championship winning team.

Professional career

However, he only made five cuts during the 1991 season.

After slicing his hand and severing several fingers with a shattered push broom, Jobe had significant hand and wrist surgery in 2003. He never won on the PGA Tour, but has tied for second place four times, including two in 2005 when he played on a major medical exemption.

Jobe finished 30th on the Nationwide Tour in 2010, which was not enough for a PGA Tour Card, but exempted him through the final stage of Q School, where he finished tied for sixth and earned his 2011 card. In June 2011, Jobe achieved his best finish in six years when he tied for second at the Memorial Tournament, one stroke behind Steve Stricker.
