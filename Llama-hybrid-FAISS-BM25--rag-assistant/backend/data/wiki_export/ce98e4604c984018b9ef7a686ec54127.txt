History

A construction permit for an FM station in Howland was granted by the Federal Communications Commission in 1989.  That permit carried the call sign WPVM, although it was never used on the air.  In 1992, the construction permit switched to WPRG, which also didn't make it to the air.

In June 1993, the station signed on as WSNV.  It aired an adult contemporary format and was owned by Bay Communications, Inc.

In 1997, the station was acquired by San Antonio-based Clear Channel Communications (later known as iHeartMedia).  Clear Channel switched the format to conservative talk, mostly featuring its own syndicated programs, and using CBS Radio News for world and national coverage.

WVOM and the other 16 Clear Channel stations in Maine were sold in August 2008 to Maine-based Blueberry Broadcasting which is headed by Louis Vitale and Bruce Biette.

WVOM-FM's programming was previously heard on WVOM (AM 1450) and FM translator W236DO (95.1) in Rockland, serving Midcoast Maine. The license for WVOM AM was surrendered to the FCC and cancelled on July 21, 2022. Translator W236DOâ€™s license was surrendered and cancelled on the same day.

Past programming
"Tom and Charlie Show" was a wake up information program hosted by Tom Morelli and Charlie Horne from 1995 to 2000.  Originally carried from 6 to 10 am.

Horne was let go three years later, after being paired with several other hosts.  The live coverage of the Ice Storm of 1998 was the high point of the morning show, and many details of this event were written about in a book.

The program was hosted by Deb Neuman of the University of Maine's Target Technology Incubator.  Neuman was awarded Small Business Journalist of the Year for Maine and New England by the US Small Business Administration. The show also has received a commendation from the United States Senate in September 2006.
