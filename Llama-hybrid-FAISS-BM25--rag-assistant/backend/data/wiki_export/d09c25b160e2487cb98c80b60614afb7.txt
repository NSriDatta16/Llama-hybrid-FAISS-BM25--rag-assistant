Buffett wrote the song to his future wife while he was on tour. At a live performance in 1974, Buffett mentioned that he had written the song heading out to California the previous year, meaning that it would have been written as he was "heading up to San Francisco for the Labor Day Weekend show" in 1973. He opened those Labor Day Weekend shows for Country Joe McDonald at the Lion's Share club in San Anselmo, California and the song was written at the Howard Johnson's Buffett was staying at in Mill Valley, California. The single version replaces the third line, "I've got my Hush Puppies on," with "I've got my hiking shoes on."

It is one of Buffett's more popular songs, and is part of "The Big 8" that he played at almost all of his concerts, typically changing the line "I just can't wait to see you again" to "It's so nice to be in...(location of show)...again".

Chart performance
"Come Monday" was Buffett's first Top 40 hit single, reaching  30 on the Billboard Hot 100 as well as  3 Easy Listening and  58 Country.  It also reached number 12 in Australia and was his most popular song there.
