Bantul (; ) is a regency located in the Special Region of Yogyakarta, Indonesia. It is located on the island of Java. The regency's population was 911,503 at the 2010 Census, but has risen to 985,770 at the 2020 Census and to 1,013,170 at the official estimates for mid 2022 - comprising 504,133 males and 509,037 females. Like many regencies on the island of Java, it is densely populated with roughly 1,999 people per square kilometre in 2022, although this is largely because the north of the regency partly surrounds the city of Yogyakarta and contains many suburban communities, notably in the densely-populated districts of Banguntapan, Sewon and Kasihan.

The regency is bordered by the city of Yogyakarta and Sleman regency to the north, the regency of Kulon Progo to the west, the Gunung Kidul Regency to the east and the Indian Ocean to the south. The town of Bantul is the administrative centre.

The village of Kemusuk in the Sedayu District in the northwest of the regency is the birthplace of former Indonesian President, Suharto.
