Robertson became involved in the 2016 controversy surrounding the all-white list of Oscar nominees in the acting category.  The president of the Academy  Cheryl Boone Isaacs, the first African American and third woman to lead the Academy, denied in 2015 that there was a problem.  When the nominations for acting were all white for a second year in a row, Robertson called it "offensive," and a repeat of the previous year's failure to recognize actors of color. He called for changes across the board in the Academy. Robertson did not call for a boycott of the Oscars, as some activists have. He noted that his organization is working with other professional groups to correct the lack of diversity in Hollywood and at the Oscars.

Robertson is a member of the National Press Club. Robertson resides in Los Angeles and Atlanta.
