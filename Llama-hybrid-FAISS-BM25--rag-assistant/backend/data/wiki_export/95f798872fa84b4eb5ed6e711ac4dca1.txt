Pershyi (, ; meaning First) is the Ukrainian public television channel, operated by the Public Broadcasting Company of Ukraine.

It is the only Ukrainian TV channel covering over 97% of Ukraine's territory. Its programs are oriented toward all levels of Ukrainian society and national minorities. Among priority directions of the network are information, popular science, culture, entertainment and sports.

History
It was launched in 2015 as the main TV channel of the newly created public broadcaster. The channel has replaced Pershyi Natsionalnyi (, First National), the state-operated TV channel that traced its origin to the Soviet UT (, , Ukrainian Television) and after dissolution of the Soviet Union UT-1.

UA꞉ Pershyi is not influenced by the state nor by Ukrainian oligarchs, which makes it one of the most transparent and reliable media in Ukraine. The channel has a series of journalistic investigations related to corruption in Ukrainian politics, including incidents that were related to the incumbent (at the time) presidents Petro Poroshenko and Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

The channel changed its logo and visual identity to the current on May 23, 2022.
