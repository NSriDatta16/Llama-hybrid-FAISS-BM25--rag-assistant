Manilow is the eleventh studio album by singer-songwriter Barry Manilow, released in 1985. It was his first album to miss the Top 40 and fail to earn a gold certification. Many feel it was due to the prominence of synthesizers, a departure from his renowned piano ballads. This album was one of Manilow's two albums with RCA Records.

The only other release with the RCA Company was an original soundtrack album of his 1985 CBS television movie, Copacabana, in which he starred as Tony Starr with Annette O'Toole as Lola Lamarr.

Release
Three singles released from this album are "In Search of Love" (#11 US AC, #80 UK), "I'm Your Man" (#86 US, #96 UK) and "He Doesn't Care (But I Do)" (#22 US AC), with "I'm Your Man" becoming the only single from the album to reach the Billboard Hot 100 chart, peaking at number 86. However, "In Search of Love" and "He Doesn't Care (But I Do)" entered the Adult Contemporary chart, peaking at number 11 and 22, respectively. 

None of its singles captured the general public, except for the song "If You Were Here with Me Tonight", which became a mainstay in adult contemporary radio setlists.
