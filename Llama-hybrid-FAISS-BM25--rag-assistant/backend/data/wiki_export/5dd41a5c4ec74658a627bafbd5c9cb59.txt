History 
Pensacola Catholic High School is a Roman Catholic diocesan high school owned and operated by the Diocese of Pensacola-Tallahassee. Catholic High was opened in the fall of 1941 when the former St. Michael's High School, located on the corner of Garden and Baylen Streets, was renamed as it gained students from several smaller Catholic schools in the city and became the one central Catholic High School in Pensacola. It opened its doors to 180 students. In 1958, Pensacola Catholic High School relocated to its current site in West Pensacola. Through the years, the campus has undergone numerous additions and renovations to accommodate its growing enrollment. The Brent Media Center was built in 2001 and the Science wing was completely remodeled in 2003. In 2004, the renovation of the administration wing was completed.

In 1993, Pensacola Catholic High School was named a Blue Ribbon School of Excellence by the U.S. Department of Education. This honor is granted to outstanding public and private schools across the United States that achieve high academic standards and model excellence.

Pensacola Catholic High School has been continuously accredited by The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools since 1928.
