The Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival is the largest documentary festival in North America. The event takes place annually in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The 27th edition of the festival took place online throughout May and June 2020. In addition to the annual festival, Hot Docs owns and operates the Hot Docs Ted Rogers Cinema, administers multiple production funds, and runs year-round screening programs including Doc Soup and Hot Docs Showcase.

History 
Hot Docs was founded in 1993 by the Documentary Organization of Canada, previously known as the Canadian Independent Film Caucus. The DOC is a national association of independent filmmakers. Paul Jay, then chair of the CIFC, was the founding board chairperson and Debbie Nightingale was the event producer. The first event was held on February 24 to 27, 1994, including the first industry conference and the National Documentary Film Awards.

In 1996, Hot Docs separated from the DOC to become an individual entity with a mandate to showcase and support the work of Canadian and international documentary filmmakers and to promote excellence in documentary production. In 1998, Chris McDonald, formerly of the Canadian Film Centre, was hired as its first full-time employee, eventually rising to become president of the festival in 2014.

The 2020 festival was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. In April, the organization partner with CBC Television on the short-run series Hot Docs at Home, which broadcast several Canadian documentary films that had been slated to premiere at the festival,. In May, Hot Docs launched an online version of the Festival and its own Hot Docs at Home screening platform.

The 2021 Hot Docs Festival was originally expected to be a hybrid event, but remained online. In 2022 the festival returned to accepting live audiences.

McDonald stepped down as festival president in 2023, to be succeeded by Marie Nelson.
