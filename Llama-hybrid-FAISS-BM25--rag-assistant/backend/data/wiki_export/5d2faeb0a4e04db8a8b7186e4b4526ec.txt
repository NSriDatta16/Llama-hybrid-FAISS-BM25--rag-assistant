Watch Your Step is a 1982 album by Ted Hawkins, a collection of previously recorded songs.

Release 
At the time of the album's release, Hawkins was a guest of the California Medical Facility in Vacaville.

Critical reception 
Trouser Press wrote: "Teaching a mighty acoustic lesson in roots music, Hawkins inhabits that secular place just outside the churchyard where gospel, folk and soul meet." Robert Christgau wrote that "these little dramas of passion, tenderness and betrayal are stamped with the sin-and-redemption of a lived life." The New Rolling Stone Record Guide wrote that "soul and blues fans need to hear this, if only to restore their faith in the dying art of emotional conviction."
