Early life and education
Soni Oyekan was born in Aba, Abia State, Nigeria on 1 June 1946 and came to the United States to study in 1966. Soni completed his high school studies at St. Paul's College, Zaria, in 1963, and his advanced high school education at Olivet Baptist High School in Oyo, Oyo State in 1965. He is of Yoruba descent.

Oyekan was a recipient of an African Scholarship Program of American Universities (ASPAU) award which was administered by the Africa-America Institute (AAI) in 1966.  The scholarship award enabled Soni to pursue his studies in Engineering and Applied Sciences with specialization in Chemical Engineering at Yale University. He completed his Bachelor of Science degree program at Yale University in 1970.

After his undergraduate studies at Yale, Soni moved on to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and completed graduate studies in chemical engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. He was awarded the Master of Science (MS) degree in 1972 and the doctoral (PhD) degree in 1977. During this time he taught at the University of Pittsburgh.

His MS degree thesis title was on "The Stability of Low Tension Interfacesâ€”Effects of layers of Discrete Dipoles and Charges". The title of his doctoral thesis was "An Infrared Spectroscopic Study of the Isomerization and Hydrogenation of Cyclic Olefins Over Zinc Oxide".  He conducted his doctoral research studies under the tutelage of Professor Anthony L. Dent.

Career
Soni Oyekan is the President and CEO of Prafis Energy Solutions. Prafis Energy Solutions is an oil refining and energy consulting services company. The company is located in Richmond, Texas. Prior to starting up his oil and gas processing consulting services company in 2013, Oyekan contributed to chemical engineering and oil refining with his inventions and studies on catalytic systems and the catalytic naphtha reforming process. 
His patents are used for enhanced profitability in reactor engineering and catalysis for the processing of crude oil to meet consumer demands for transportation fuels, heating oil, propane and butane gases. Dr. Oyekan provides his expertise as expert witness in litigation cases for oil refining history, oil refining and related waste management challenges.  

Soni has over 42 years of experience in petroleum refining technologies and operations. He worked at the Exxon Research and Development Laboratory in Baton Rouge, Louisiana between 1977 and 1980; at Engelhard Corporation between 1980 and 1990, and DuPont between 1991 and 1993, leading research and development programs in catalysis and reaction engineering. After 1993, Soni moved into the management of oil refineries, with technical management assignments as senior consultant/corporate process technologist at Sun Oil Company (Sunoco)1993 to 1997; BP-Amoco, 1997 to 1999, and Marathon Petroleum Corporation, 1999 to 2013.
