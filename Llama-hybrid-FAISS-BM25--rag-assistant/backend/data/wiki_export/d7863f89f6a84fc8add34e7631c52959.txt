This page lists tornadoes and tornado outbreaks which have touched down in Canada prior to the 21st century. On average, there are around 80 confirmed and unconfirmed tornadoes that touch down in Canada each year, with most occurring in the southern Canadian Prairies, Southern Ontario and southern Quebec. Canada ranks as the country with the second most tornadoes per year, after the US. The most common types are F0 to F2 in damage intensity level and usually result in minor structural damage to barns, wood fences, roof shingles, chimneys, uprooted or snapped tree limbs and downed power lines. Fewer than 5% of tornadoes in Canada are rated F3 or higher in intensity, where wind speeds are in excess of . Prior to April 1, 2013, Canada used a slightly modified Fujita scale, and as of that date the Enhanced Fujita scale, again slightly modified, was put into use to rate tornado intensity, based on the damage to buildings and vegetation.

Each year on average, about 43 tornadoes occur across the Canadian Prairies and about 17 occur across Ontario and Quebec. New Brunswick and the British Columbia Interior are also recognized tornado zones. All other provinces and territories have significantly less threat from tornadoes. The peak season in Canada is through the summer months, (June to August), when clashing air masses move north, as opposed to the spring season in the United States southern-central plains, although tornadoes in Canada have occurred in spring, fall and very rarely winter.

The reported increase in numbers of tornadoes in recent years may reflect more reporting by citizens and media involvement rather than an actual increase in tornado occurrence (although some natural increase has not been ruled out), in addition to better detection technology i.e. Doppler weather radar and satellite imagery. The upswing could also be attributed to other factors, such as improved aerial and ground damage assessment after the fact in sparsely populated areas (particularly the case in remote parts of the Canadian Prairies and Northern Ontario, for example), better trained spotter capabilities and increased use of digital recording devices by citizens. Tornadoes in Canada are enough of a threat for a public warning system to be in place, overseen by the national weather agency, Environment Canada (EC).

For a variety of reasons, such as Canada's lower population density and generally stronger housing construction due to the colder climate, Canadian tornadoes have historically caused fewer fatalities than tornadoes in the United States. The deadliest tornado in Canadian history, the Regina Cyclone of June 30, 1912, killed 28 and injured 300. Urban centres are not immune from the threat of severe tornadoes. Twelve medium to large size Canadian cities have been hit by significant strength tornadoes (F3 or higher), which caused large-scale damage and fatalities: Toronto (1868); Regina (1912); Windsor (1946 and 1974); Sarnia (1953); LaSalle (1956); Sudbury (1970); Woodstock (1979); Lloydminster (1983); Barrie (1985); Edmonton (1987); Aylmer (1994); and Ottawa-Gatineau (1888 and 2018).

All figures for damages are in Canadian dollars.

September 5 - an F2 tornado and a probable tornado struck Ontario and Quebec. The F2 tornado struck Cornwall, Ontario, and near Lancaster, Ontario. The tornado started near Massena, New York, before crossing the St. Lawrence River. The tornado was spotted crossing the river from Long Sault, Ontario.

As for out-houses, the tornado destroyed 11, unroofed 13, and damaged many more. Debris was carried up to the three miles away. A young girl was thrown into the Cornwall Canal and drown while here brother and another man escaped without injury. The tornado approached the St. Lawrence River near Lancaster, Ontario, where it destroyed several other buildings and injured two. The probable tornado struck Saint-Édouard, Quebec, two hours after the first tornado. The storm lasted 50 minutes which is far longer than a normal tornado, however, the damage caused was the destruction of 57 buildings of various kinds. This tornado is listed as probable as the description is not fully clear on the event but the significant damage caused seems far greater than a downburst.

The tornado was strong enough to knock over 18-inch in diameter trees and carry them long distances. A second tornado touched down near Williams Creek, British Columbia, carrying light materials some distance. These two tornadoes are only probable as they do mention smoke and fire with both situations, but if severe thunderstorms did cross a forest fire area and produce a tornado, the vortex could be able to spin up the smoke alongside carry debris and cause damage as described in the articles.
 Weeks before August 21 (on a Sunday) - one strong tornado or two smaller tornadoes touched down in Southwestern Ontario. The source indicates that a tornado started a few miles west of Woodstock, Ontario, and crossed through the city. The tornado caused immense damage, destroying over 740 panes of glass from the Canada Institute building, uprooting trees and levelling barns and sheds in "East Woodstock". The source discusses a second tornado through Middlesex County, Ontario, which may have been the origin for the first tornado. The description of this tornado claims that forests, fences, houses, and everything else were knocked down in the path of the tornado.

The Weekly British Whig states that damage to some of the provincial towns was also severe with heavy crop damage while the Victoria Daily British Colonist states that the damage was in a narrow path with weak crop damage. Because of the difference in the event descriptions and the distance between Portage la Prairie and Winnipeg, it is assumed that there was likely at least one tornado with the possibility of more tornadoes that touched down.

Additional damage was reported in Lachute, Quebec, where the path was nearly a mile wide, however, it is unclear from any sources whether this is the same tornado as the first one or a probable concurrent tornado. The second tornado hit the Township of Templeton, just east of the Gatineau River causing significant tree damage. The tornado was half a mile wide. Further east of both of these tornadoes, significant damage was reported in Acton Vale, Quebec, and Upton, Quebec, with a hundred homes destroyed and four deaths and a third tornado is probable. Five additional areas of significant damage were reported across the region. These damage areas could have been from tornadoes or from strong straight-line winds/downbursts at the result of weaker building structures, however, based on the amount of damage caused, probable tornadoes seem likely. The significant damage was reported in St. Johns, Quebec, where two buildings and a large barn were destroyed, over the Île d'Orléans, Quebec, where various houses and barns were blown down, in Saint-Augustin-de-Desmaures, Quebec (just east of Portneuf, Quebec) where a man died after falling off the roof of a barn they were repairing, over Lac Saint-Jean where heavy damage was also reported, and in Renfrew, Ontario, where a high school and six additional buildings were destroyed, including a home that was tossed more than 100 feet.
