NFL career
A second round draft pick in the 1997 NFL Draft, the 6'0", 212Â lb. Herring played in 54 games for the Baltimore Ravens, including a victory and an interception in Super Bowl XXXV. After racking up 178 tackles, 2 sacks and 3 interceptions in his four seasons with Baltimore, he signed as a free agent with the St. Louis Rams in 2001. There he made another Super Bowl appearance that season in a 20-17 loss to the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XXXVI.
