"Calling You" is a song from the 1987 film, Bagdad Cafe. It was originally recorded by American R&B and gospel music singer Jevetta Steele. Bob Telson, the songwriter, also recorded his version. Both versions appeared on the movie soundtrack. The song was critically acclaimed and nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 61st Academy Awards.

Critical reception
Film critic Julie Salamon from Wall Street Journal wrote, "The mood, dreamy and yearning, takes hold at the outset, as the terrific gospel singer Jevetta Steele sings Bob Telson's "Calling You". This theme song is hypnotic; days later you'll find it turning itself on in your head." Upon the 1993 re-release, Larry Flick from Billboard stated that "this overlooked nugget from the soundtrack to Bagdad Cafe is poised for long overdue success, thanks to its exposure in an AT&T television commercial. Steele's haunting, beautiful vocal rests comfortably atop a spare keyboard and harmonica arrangement. Don't let this one slip by a second time". Jerry Smith from Music Week declared it as a "startlingly simple, but highly effective ballad", made distinctive by Steele's "hauntingly soulful vocals. Could well be an offbeat hit if given the deserved exposure." A reviewer from NME said, "Jevetta has a beautiful voice that haunts the heart with a moving and yet feminine piano accompaniment." Jim Delmont from Omaha World-Herald viewed it as "a strangely fascinating theme song". Parry Gettelman from Orlando Sentinel wrote, "Levi Seacer's production is syrupy, but Steele sings the eerily simple melody with extraordinary strength and elegance." Joe Brown from The Washington Post complimented it as "haunting", sung by the "incomparable" Steele. He added, "Okay, you can compare her to Whitney Houston - but Steele wins".
