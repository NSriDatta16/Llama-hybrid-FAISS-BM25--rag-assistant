The first website was created in August 1991 by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN, a European nuclear research agency. Berners-Lee's WorldWideWeb browser was made publicly available the same month. The World Wide Web began to enter everyday use in 1993 and 1994, when websites for the general public started to become available. By the end of 1994, the total number of websites was still minute compared to present figures, but quite a number of notable websites were already active, many of which are the precursors to today's most popular services. Of the thousands of websites founded prior to 1995, those appearing here are listed for one or more of the following reasons:

 They still exist (albeit in some cases with different names).
 They made contributions to the history of the World Wide Web.
 They helped to shape certain modern Web content, such as webcomics and weblogs.
