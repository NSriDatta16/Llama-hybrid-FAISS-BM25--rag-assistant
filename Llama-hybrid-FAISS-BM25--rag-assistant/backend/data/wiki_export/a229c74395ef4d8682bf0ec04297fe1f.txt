The Estación de Madrid-Chamartín Clara Campoamor or Madrid Chamartín  is the second major railway station in Madrid, Spain. Located on the northern side of the city, it was built between 1970 and 1975, but more work was carried on into the early 1980s. It then superseded Atocha station, which is located just south of the city centre. However, as the AVE network expanded with a hub at Atocha, Chamartin again became Madrid's second station by passenger volume.

It hosts the railway networks connecting Madrid and north-western Spain, the AVE (high-speed line) from Madrid to Segovia, Valladolid and León and many Cercanías lines (commuter rail), as well as the international line to Lisbon. There are also connections with Atocha. Under the railway station is Chamartín Metro Station, linking with lines 1 and 10 of the Madrid Metro, also for travelling to Madrid City Centre.
