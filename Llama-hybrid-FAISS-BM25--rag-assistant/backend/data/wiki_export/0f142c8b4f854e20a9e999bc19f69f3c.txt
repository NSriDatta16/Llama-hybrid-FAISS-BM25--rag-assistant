Graves de communi re is an encyclical written by Pope Leo XIII in 1901, on Christian Democracy. It is part of a larger body of writings known as Catholic social teaching, that trace their origin to Rerum novarum which was issued by Pope Leo XIII in 1891. While reaffirming the Church's opposition to individualistic liberal capitalism, it also denied that the new ideals of Christian Democracy were an endorsement of the principles of a democratic political system. Leo also attacks socialism within the work, referring to it as a "harvest of misery" ''.
