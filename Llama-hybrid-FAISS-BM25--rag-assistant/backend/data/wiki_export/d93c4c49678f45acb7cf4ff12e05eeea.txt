Mawson Lakes is a railway station and bus interchange in the Adelaide suburb of Mawson Lakes. It is located on the Gawler line,  north of Adelaide station. To the west of the station lies the Australian Rail Track Corporation standard gauge line to Crystal Brook. The northern ends of the platforms are under the Elder Smith Road bridge with elevators and stairs from the footpath down to the platforms.

History 

Mawson Interchange was constructed as part of the Mawson Connector project, which saw the construction of a new dual carriageway, now Elder Smith Road, through Mawson Lakes, and over the Gawler rail line. The $33 million Mawson Interchange project was officially opened in March 2006, complete with approximately 100 carparks, a large bus interchange and a pedestrian overpass connected to the Elder Smith Rd bridge. At the time, Mawson Interchange was the first new public transport interchange to be built in Adelaide in more than 15 years. In 2017, there were several calls for a multi-level carpark to be constructed on the site of the existing carpark, due to increasing passenger numbers, however, this never eventuated.

Platforms and Services 
Mawson Lakes has two side platforms and is serviced by Adelaide Metro Gawler line services. It is a designated high-frequency station, with trains scheduled every 15 minutes on weekdays, between 7:30am and 6:30pm.
