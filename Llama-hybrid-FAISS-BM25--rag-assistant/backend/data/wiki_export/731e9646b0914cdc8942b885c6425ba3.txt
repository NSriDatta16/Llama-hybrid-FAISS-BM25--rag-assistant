Halfway Around the World is the second single from the album Teen Spirit by A-Teens. The single peaked at number seven in Sweden and earned a gold certification.

Music video
The video premiered in February 2001 and it was directed by Mikadelica. It shows the A-Teens in different parts of the world (Peru, Paris, somewhere in the North, and China) and the action takes place in different seasons, but all of this ends up taking place on a set for a film shooting. There is also a love story between two staff members. The song tells the story of two people who are "halfway around the world," but that them being distanced from each other won't stop their love for each other.
