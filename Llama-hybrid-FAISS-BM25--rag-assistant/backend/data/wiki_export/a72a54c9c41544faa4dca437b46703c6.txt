"What's on Your Mind (Pure Energy)" is a song by American synth-pop band Information Society that was released as a single in 1988. The "Pure Energy" subtitle derives from a sample of Leonard Nimoy's voice from the Star Trek episode "Errand of Mercy". There are also samples of DeForest Kelley and Richard Tatro's (The Android Norman) voices from the episode "I, Mudd". John Leland of Spin magazine called it a "pretty potent dance record".

In 2009, VH1 ran a countdown of the 100 Greatest One Hit Wonders of the '80s. Information Society's "What's on Your Mind (Pure Energy)" placed at number 74 on the countdown despite the fact that the group had two other top 40 hits: "Walking Away" (number 9) and "Think" (number 28).

The song was a big hit in the US, spending 25 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number three in October 1988. The single was certified gold by the RIAA on January 18, 1989, selling 500,000 copies.

The song was featured in Loverboy and American Psycho. A remixed version was included in American Psychos soundtrack.

In 1989, Pittsburgh radio station WYDD-FM played this song non-stop in a loop for 25½ hours—focusing on a repeat of the "Pure Energy" sample from Leonard Nimoy as Star Treks Mr. Spock. The marketing stunt caused listeners to call emergency services, concerned that some calamity had befallen the DJs and other station employees. Bob Hank, general manager at the time, told reporters he was only trying to draw attention to the station's switch in format and new call letters WNRJ (N-R-J = "energy"). "We were just trying to draw a little bit of attention," Hank said. "We never dreamed it would go this far". The song also samples Star Trek in the intro, with the character Dr. McCoy saying "it's worked so far, but we're not out yet."

Composition
The song started out as a 10-minute instrumental jam, when Information Society was trying to record their first album. Tommy Boy Records grew frustrated that the band was spending so much money in the studio but had nothing to show for it, and pressured them to make a hit. Paul Robb came up with a chorus he said was partly inspired by "Sledgehammer" by Peter Gabriel, as well as Duran Duran. After the chorus, he wrote verses with Kurt Harland.

Robb emulated minimalist New Wave artists such as Gary Numan and Devo by trying to write lyrics that "said as little as possible". He said the verses were "just sort of a random collection of emotional impressions. ... But when you look back at it now, it's a clear narrative about the difficulty that people have communicating with each other. At the time, we weren't writing it with that in mind, but it's so clear when you just read through the lyrics. It's a very simple and very clear-cut story."
