Quebec autonomism is the belief that Quebec should seek to gain more autonomy as a province, while remaining a part of the Canadian federation. The concept was first articulated by Maurice Duplessis; it has since been advocated primarily by Quebec's nationalist and conservative political parties, including Union Nationale, Action démocratique du Québec, and the latter's successor Coalition Avenir Québec. Coalition Avenir Québec and Équipe Autonomiste are two contemporary parties which support Quebec autonomism.

Drawing inspiration from René Lévesque's "beau risque", and Robert Bourassa's work on the Meech Lake Accord and Charlottetown Accord, its goals are, in short:
 Setting out the procedures for constitutional change
 A sharing of jurisdictions between the federal government and Quebec
 Framework for federal spending powers
 Institutional reform
 Reform of intergovernmental policies

In a speech to delegates of the ADQ, party leader Mario Dumont, on 8 May 2006, Dumont said that Quebec should seek to re-open negotiations with the federal government over Quebec's status in Confederation, and should eventually ratify the Constitution of Canada.
