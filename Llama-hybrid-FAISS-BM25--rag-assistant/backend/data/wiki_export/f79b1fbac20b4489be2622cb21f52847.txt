Brown Line Capacity Expansion Project
The Brown Line Capacity Expansion Project aims to allow eight car trains on the Brown Line by the extension of the platforms at all stations. At the same time all Brown Line stations are being upgraded to become accessible to passengers with disabilities. On December 2, 2006, Addison station closed for 12 months to be rebuilt as part of this project. The station reopened on December 3, 2007, the same day which the Irving Park station closed for renovations.
