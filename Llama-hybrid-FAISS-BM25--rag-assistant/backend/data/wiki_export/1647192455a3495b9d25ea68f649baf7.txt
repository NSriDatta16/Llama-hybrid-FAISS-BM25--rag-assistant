Methven (; ) is a large village in the Scottish region of Perth and Kinross, on the A85 road due west of the town of Perth. It is near the village of Almondbank. The village has its own primary school, church, bowling club, community halls, playing field with sports facilities and skate-park, and a variety of businesses.

There is a local primary school in the village, and a large co-educational boarding and day independent school nearby, called Glenalmond College, described by The Good Schools Guide as providing an "outstanding" quality of education.

Etymology
A Brittonic name, Methven is thought to be derived from words equivalent to Welsh medd "mead", and maen (in this case, mutated to faen) "stone".

Businesses
To the south of the village, along Station Road, a small industrial estate occupies the former site of Methven Station.  Closed since 27 September 1937, the station was originally the western terminus of the Perth, Almond Valley and Methven Railway.

Strathearn_distillery, a single malt Scotch whisky distillery is located to the south-west of the village.

Local Issues
Work began on a new pedestrian crossing in the village in 2008, but was slow to progress, with it not completed until August 2009. Locals had campaigned for a crossing for years because of the busy main road that cuts through the village. The work to install it (as well as nearby works to upgrade the gas pipe network in the village) caused some disruption.

History and legacy
The  Battle of Methven took place in 1306 between Scottish forces (led by newly crowned king Robert the Bruce) and English forces (led by Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke) and resulted in a resounding win for the English. This was part of the Scottish Wars of Independence.

There used to be a Royal Air Force station nearby called RAF Methven.

Smiddy House, at 42â€“44 Main Street, was built around 1840. It is now considered at-risk due to its condition.
