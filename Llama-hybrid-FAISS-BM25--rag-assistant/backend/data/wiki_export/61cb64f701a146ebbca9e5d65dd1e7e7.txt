Taco soup is a type of soup composed of a broth with similar ingredients to those used inside a taco: ground beef, tomatoes, chopped green chilis, onions, corn, beans and a packet of taco seasoning. Vegetarian versions combine beans with the other ingredients, except for the ground beef. Once cooked, the soup may be topped off with cheese, sour cream, raw onions, avocado, or tortilla chips
