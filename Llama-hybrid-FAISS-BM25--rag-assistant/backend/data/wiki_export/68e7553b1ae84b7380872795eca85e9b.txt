Gedung Sate is a public building in Bandung, West Java, Indonesia. It was designed according to a neoclassical design incorporating native Indonesian elements (such as Hindu-Buddhist elements) by Dutch architect J. Gerber to be the seat of the Dutch East Indies department of State Owned Enterprises (Departement van Gouvernmentsbedrijven, literally "Department of Government Industries"); the building was completed in 1924. Today, the building serves as the seat of the governor of West Java, and also a museum.

Its common name, Gedung sate, is a nickname that translates literally from Indonesian to 'satay building', which is a reference to the shape of the building's central pinnacle - which resemble the shape of one of the Indonesian traditional dish called satay. The central pinnacle consists of six spheres that represent the six million guilders funded to the construction of the building.
