The New Firm is the term used, hailing from the 1980s, to describe the rivalry between Scottish football clubs Aberdeen and Dundee United. Both clubs are located on the east coast of Scotland, in the third and fourth most populous cities respectively.

Although not traditionally a derby, with 65 miles separating both teams, the fixture was seen as a North-east of Scotland derby between the two most successful teams in Scotland outside of the Old Firm during the 1980s. Dundee United also have a more traditional rivalry with their close neighbours Dundee.

History
The term originated in the 1980s, when both clubs challenged the Old Firm for domestic trophies. The term was used by Evening Times and The Glasgow Herald.

The Old Firm have more often than not been the dominant force in Scottish Football, however throughout the 1980s both Aberdeen and Dundee United were more than a match for them, regularly beating them home and away and winning many of the trophies on offer.

Aberdeen were to win the Scottish Premier Division three times, the Scottish Cup four times, the Scottish League Cup twice, the European Cup Winners' Cup and the European Super Cup, all within the 1980s. In this same period, Dundee United won the Scottish Premier Division once and the Scottish League Cup twice, as well as reaching the Scottish Cup final four times, the 1987 UEFA Cup Final, and the semi-final of the 1983–84 European Cup. Not only were the Old Firm not dominating the title race, but for three seasons in a row, 1983 through to 1985, the league title went to either Aberdeen or Dundee United, meaning for the first time two other teams were dominating Scottish Football.

Both sides' success was limited as they entered the 1990s, with Aberdeen winning both cups in 1989–90, reaching both finals in 1992–93, as well as almost winning the league in 1991, while Dundee United were Scottish Cup finalists in 1991 and finally winners in 1994. However, in the 1994–95 season both sides fought relegation (with United going down), and although Aberdeen won the Scottish League Cup in 1995 and Dundee United the Scottish Cup again in 2010, neither side has managed to be a consistent force for Rangers and Celtic to reckon with, and Aberdeen's league success in 1984–85 is the last time a non-Old Firm club won the Scottish league title.

Since 2010 however, the sides have seen a divergence in fortunes, as Aberdeen capitalised on Rangers' implosion to win the Scottish League Cup in 2014 and finish runners-up behind Celtic for four years running between 2014–15 and 2017–18 (losing three cup finals to the same club in that period), while Dundee United were relegated from the top flight in 2016 having lost the 2014 Scottish Cup Final to a local rival, St Johnstone.

Domestic head-to-head
In domestic head-to-head matches, the teams have played each other 246 times, Aberdeen winning 98 compared to United's 79. Aberdeen have won more league and Scottish Cup matches while United have won more League Cup matches between the two.

Given their mutual success particularly in the 1980s, it is perhaps surprising that the only major final featuring both clubs is the 1979–80 Scottish League Cup Final, won by Dundee United in a replay at Dens Park after a draw in Glasgow.
