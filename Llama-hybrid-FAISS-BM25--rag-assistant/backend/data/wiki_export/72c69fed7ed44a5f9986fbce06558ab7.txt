North is a 2003 album by English singer-songwriter Elvis Costello. Contrasting with its rock-based predecessor When I Was Cruel (2002), North is an intimate album of ballads and torch songs using classical music and jazz idioms, partially inspired by the dissolution of his marriage to wife Cait O'Riordan and his burgeoning relationship with Diana Krall. It reached No. 44 in the UK Albums Chart, No. 57 in the US chart and No. 1 in the US Traditional Jazz chart.
