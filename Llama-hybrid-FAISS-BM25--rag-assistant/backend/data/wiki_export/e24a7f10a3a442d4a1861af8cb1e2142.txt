History of the group 
The history of the group dates back to 1927, with the creation of one of the first tractor powered by a diesel engine by brother Francesco and Eugenio Cassani. In 1942 the foundation of the company SAME (Società Accomandita Motori Endotermici) in Treviglio (Bergamo) crowned the company's founders' dream. After buying Lamborghini Trattori S.p.A. in 1973 from its founder Ferruccio Lamborghini, SAME embarked on a strategy of growth through acquisitions. With its acquisition of Hürlimann in 1979, the company changed its name to SAME-Lamborghini-Hürlimann (S-L-H).

In 1995, the group acquired Deutz-Fahr from the German group KHD, changing name definitively to SAME Deutz-Fahr (SDF).

SAME Deutz-Fahr India was founded in 1996.From 2003 to 2012, SDF was a shareholder in the German group Deutz AG In 2003, the group acquired 10% of the Finland based company Sampo-Rosenlew, which specialised in the production of components and 4 and 5 straw walker combine harvesters. This shareholding was subsequently sold.

In 2005, following its acquisition of the Croatia based company Ðuro Ðaković, the group founded the company Deutz-Fahr Combines, through which it now produces Deutz-Fahr branded components and combine harvesters.

In 2008, the Same Deutz-Fahr Historical Archives and Museum was established at the group's main headquarters in Treviglio.

In 2011, the group acquired Grégoire A/S, a company which specialised in equipment for wine farming, olive oil farming, pruning and for the treatment and harvesting of grapes and olives. Also in 2011, SDF initiated a joint venture in China with Shandong Changlin Machinery.

In 2014, the company SAME Deutz-Fahr  Traktör Sanayi ve Ticaret A.Ş. was founded in Istanbul, Turkey and the company Agricoltural Equipment in China is acquired and in 2016 SDF acquires the majority of the Chinese business.

In 2022, SDF acquires VitiBot, French leader in the production of autonomous and electric robots for vineyards.

Global operations 
SDF has 9 production sites, 12 commercial branches, 1 joint venture in China, 155 importers, over 3,100 dealers, and 4,400 employees. 

SDF's farm equipment, machinery, and logistics research and development is funded by a €50 million European Investment Bank loan secured by the European Fund for Strategic Investments. The initiative is part of Horizon 2020 and is in accordance with the Paris Agreement's objectives. A senior engineer at the European Investment Bank, Matteo Fusari, who worked on the project, says, "We expect this project to have quite a good environmental impact." “It allows for vehicle automation and monitoring from a distance. These innovations will increase the efficiency of bioeconomy supply chains, in addition to reducing fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.”
