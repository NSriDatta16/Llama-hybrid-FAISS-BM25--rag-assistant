2012 Controversy
In 2012, Vázquez Raña came under media scrutiny for allegedly manipulating news stories in newspapers controlled by the Organización Editorial Mexicana in favor of  Enrique Peña Nieto, presidential candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party.

On 11 May 2012, Enrique Peña Nieto gave a speech at the Universidad Iberoamericana in Mexico City as part of his 2012 presidential campaign. He was jeered by the general student population upon arrival, but was allowed to deliver his remarks. Multiple newspapers belonging to the Organización Editorial Mexicana including El Sol de México and Diario de Xalapa covered the story by printing identical headlines labeling Peña Nieto's speech a "success" after an attempted "boycott" by leftist activists. The university incident, as well as the coverage by newspapers controlled by Vázquez Raña subsequently received media attention and scrutiny.
