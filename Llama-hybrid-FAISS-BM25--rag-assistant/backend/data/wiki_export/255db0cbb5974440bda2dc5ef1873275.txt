This is a list of people who have served as Lord-Lieutenant of Kildare.

There were lieutenants of counties in Ireland until the reign of James II, when they were renamed governors. The office of Lord Lieutenant was recreated on 23 August 1831. The main function of the office was to raise, train and manage the local militia bodies, in line with the Militia (Ireland) Act 1802. Beyond that, the Lords Lieutenant had a figurehead function representing the monarch at the local level.
