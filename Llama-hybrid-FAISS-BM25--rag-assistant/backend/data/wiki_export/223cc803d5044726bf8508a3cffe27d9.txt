History
After voters rejected a June 1959 referendum that would have raised $3.25 million for construction of the district's second high school in Old Tappan, voters narrowly approved a trimmed-down version of the plan in January 1960 that reduced the cost to $2.9 million (equivalent to $ million in ).

The school was opened with 740 students in grades 9-11 in March 1962 to address overcrowding in the district's original school at Demarest that opened in 1955 and that had been holding split sessions until the new school opened. At its establishment, the school served students from Harrington Park, Northvale, Norwood and Old Tappan, as well as those from the northern portion of Closter.
