In physics and mathematics, the Pauli group  on 1 qubit is the 16-element matrix group consisting of the 2 × 2 identity matrix  and all of the Pauli matrices
,
together with the products of these matrices with the factors  and :
.
The Pauli group is generated by the Pauli matrices, and like them it is named after Wolfgang Pauli.

The Pauli group on  qubits, , is the group generated by the operators described above applied to each of  qubits in the tensor product Hilbert space .

As an abstract group,  is the central product of a cyclic group of order 4 and the dihedral group of order 8.

The Pauli group is a representation of the gamma group in three-dimensional Euclidean space. It is not isomorphic to the gamma group; it is less free, in that its chiral element is  whereas there is no such relationship for the gamma group.
