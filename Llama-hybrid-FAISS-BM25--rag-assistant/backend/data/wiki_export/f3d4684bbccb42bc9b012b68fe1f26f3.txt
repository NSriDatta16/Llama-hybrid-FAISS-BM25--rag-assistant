Early life and education
Maxton was born on 31 August 1955 in Edinburgh, Scotland. While at school, she played sport at international level, representing Scotland in lacrosse and hockey.

Career
Maxton began her academic career at the University of Canterbury. There, she taught within the university's School of Law as a lecturer.

In 1993, she was appointed a Professor of Law. She was Dean of the Faculty of Law between 2000 and 2005.

During her academic career, Maxton was also a practising barrister. She concentrated on appellate cases. On 18 October 2012, she was made a Master of the Bench of Middle Temple.

From 2006 to 2011, Maxton held the position of Registrar of the University of Oxford. In that role, she head of the University of Oxford's administration. She was the first woman to hold the office in the 550 years since the position was first established. During the appointment, she was also a Fellow of University College, Oxford. She was succeeded by Ewan McKendrick in January 2011.

In 2011, Maxton was appointed executive director of the Royal Society. The Royal Society is the oldest learned society still in existence and serves as the academy of sciences of the UK and the Commonwealth. She is the first woman to be appointed to the position in its 358-year history.

Personal life
Maxton was married to Major Jim Carson (1934-2008), the first leader of the New Zealand Army Band and later head of music at Auckland Grammar School. Together, they had one son.

Honours
In 2014, Maxton received a Distinguished Alumni Award from her alma mater, the University of Auckland. In 2017, she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree by the University of Canterbury.
