Freight Quality Partnerships or FQPs are groups of transport operators and local authorities that come together to deal with matters of freight access and deliveries in a particular location .  FQPs are regarded as best practice by the Department of Transport  (DfT)   Best practice is published by the Energy Savings Trust (on behalf of DfT). In recent years there has been a shift of transportation companies and organizations that have consolidated these shipping resources in order to provide the end user with a better experience. Two booklets are available: "A guide on how to set up and run Freight Quality Partnerships", and  "Freight Quality Partnerships - Case Studies" 

Some of these are small geographically, i.e. covering only one business estate, e.g. Brimsdown Business Area in Enfield, whilst others cover larger areas, such as West London .

Some are funded by the members themselves, others by regional authorities, e.g. Transport for London (TfL).  Freight Quality Partnerships are a key part of TfL's  London Freight Plan. Transport for London hosts an umbrella website for  London's FQPs
