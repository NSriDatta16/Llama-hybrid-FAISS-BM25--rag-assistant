"All Seats Taken" is the debut single of Australian actress and singer Bec Cartwright, taken from her first album, Bec Cartwright. The track peaked at number 10 on the Australian Singles Chart in November 2002. The song was originally penned for the female finalists of Popstars 3. However, because none of them won the series, it was given to Cartwright instead.

Music video
The music video was filmed in a former roller skating rink in Petersham, an Inner West suburb of Sydney. The location is now a mixed residential and commercial complex.
