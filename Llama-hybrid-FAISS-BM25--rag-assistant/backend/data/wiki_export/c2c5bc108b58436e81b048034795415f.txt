Channellock 250 

The Channellock 250 was held March 23 at Bristol Motor Speedway. Scott Riggs won the pole. This race was known for several major story lines. There were two separate altercations post-race, the most notable being a physical confrontation between Kevin Harvick and Greg Biffle following an incident between the two drivers on lap 241 in which Harvick crashed hard; Harvick was placed on probation for the incident, which saw him being parked from the Virginia 500 Cup Series race when he collided against Coy Gibbs during the Martinsville Trucks race, in violation of the probation.

The other happening just on the other end of pit road in a verbal confrontation between Jimmy Spencer and Jack Sprague after Spencer turned Sprague, who was five laps down, in the last turn on the last lap while chasing down Jeff Green for the win. Green would ultimately win while Spencer lost two spots in that incident to drop to fourth. It was also known for privateer driver Ken Alexander and rookie Johnny Sauter causing or getting caught up in multiple incidents with Alexander being a nuisance on the track throughout the race, both finally dropping out before the race's end as well as a hard crash on the last lap between Mark Green and Larry Foyt with Green suffering a broken left foot.
