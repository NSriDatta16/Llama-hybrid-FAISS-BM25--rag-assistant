"Black and White Town" is the lead single from English rock band Doves' third album, Some Cities (2005). The single was released on 7 February 2005 and gave the band their second top-10 hit, charting at  6 on the UK Singles Chart. The atmospheric single is noted for its heavy piano and guitars played in unison, with Andy Williams' percussion maintaining a driving beat. The music video for "Black and White Town", directed by Lynne Ramsay, was filmed on the Summerston council estate and Prospecthill Circus estate in Toryglen Glasgow. There also exists a "director's cut" of the video, featuring different footage, which can be found on the DVD in the limited edition box set version of the Some Cities album.
