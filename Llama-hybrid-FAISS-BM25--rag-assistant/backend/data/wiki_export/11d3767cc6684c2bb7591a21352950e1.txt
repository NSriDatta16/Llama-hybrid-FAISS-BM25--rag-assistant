The 57th Academy Awards were presented March 25, 1985, at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Los Angeles. Jack Lemmon presided over the ceremonies. This ceremony marked the first time that multiple black nominees would win an Oscar, when Prince and Stevie Wonder won for their respective work on Purple Rain and The Woman in Red. Additionally, it was the only time that all five nominees in Best Original Song topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart.

Amadeus won eight awards, including Best Picture. Other winners included The Killing Fields with three awards, A Passage to India and Places in the Heart with two, and Charade, Dangerous Moves, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Purple Rain, The Stone Carvers, The Times of Harvey Milk, Up, and The Woman in Red with one.

While presenting the Best Picture award, Laurence Olivier forgot to list the nominees and simply tore open the envelope to declare: "Amadeus!". Upon accepting the award on the film's behalf, producer Saul Zaentz had the presence of mind to mention the other Best Picture nominees during his speech to make up for Olivier's flub.
