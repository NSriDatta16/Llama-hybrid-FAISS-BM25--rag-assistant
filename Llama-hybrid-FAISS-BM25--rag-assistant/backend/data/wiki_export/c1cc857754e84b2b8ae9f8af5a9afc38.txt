In the early 1920's, the logging of ancient Redwood Forests in Northern California nearly extinguished a primordial coastal redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens).  A last ditch conservation effort to preserve a grove of these trees was undertaken following publication of a series of photographs showing the size of these ancient trees.

Within Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park, within the Redwoods National Park, there is a plaque that reads the following:
"The Metcalf Grove
This Grove is Given to the State of California 
for the
Preservation of these Ancient Trees
by
Mr. And Mrs. Jesse M. Metcalf
of Rhode Island"
