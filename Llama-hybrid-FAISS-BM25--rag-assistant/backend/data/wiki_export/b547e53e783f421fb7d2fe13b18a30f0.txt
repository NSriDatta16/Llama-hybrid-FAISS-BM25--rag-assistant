Shaw Spotlight (formerly Shaw TV) is the name of locally based community channel services operated by cable TV provider Shaw Communications.  The channels are available only to Shaw Cable subscribers and are produced in communities throughout western Canada.

Each station runs programming produced by staff and/or volunteers. Most stations broadcast a variety of programming, including community interest segments, studio shows, city council meetings, sports, community bulletin board messages, and public service announcements.

Some programs are aired only locally, while others are aired throughout a province or region. Shaw Direct airs many of the features and shows from "Shaw TV" on channel 299 (or channel 2 depending on the line-up). This channel is not branded as "Shaw TV" but as "Shaw Direct TV". It also airs selected other features relating to Shaw Direct programming such as a PPV (Pay-Per-View) movie preview show called "Movie Loft" and regional news for areas where a local station is not carried (notably CBC Newfoundland & Labrador).

In April 2017, Shaw announced that it would shut down its Shaw TV community channels in Calgary, Edmonton, and Vancouver on August 15, 2017, under new policies allowing television providers that also own terrestrial stations in "metropolitan" markets to redirect funding from their community channels to support the news operations of the terrestrial station (in this case, the Global stations owned by sister company Corus Entertainment).

In late 2018, Shaw TV channels began rebranding as "Shaw Spotlight", as reflected by new on-air graphics, website and social media accounts.

Sports
Shaw TV provides local sports coverage. It provided live network sports coverage until the end of the 2016-17 Western Hockey League season.

In terms of network coverage, Shaw was in a partnership with the Western Hockey League from 2003-04 through 2016-17 to all subscribers across the network in Western Canada known as WHL on SHAW. The schedule usually consisted of random games before the December holiday break, with a regular game of the week on Friday nights plus select Saturday and mid week games.

In the playoffs, Shaw will select one series per round to cover. Play-by-play broadcasters for the 2012–13 season include Dan Russell and Peter Loubardias. Russell is in his ninth year as play-by-play announcer. Bill Wilms and Jeff Odgers provide colour commentary, with Andy Neal responsible for hosting duties.

In 2006, Shaw added Canada West Football as a sports property with a game of the week package known as Krown Produce Canada West Football on Shaw. Shaw carried the Hardy Cup Championship until 2011, when the conference elected to broadcast the game on TSN. The Hardy returned to Shaw from 2013 - 2016. The Shaw TV production produced and presented the Hardy to 10.2 million households in the 2015 season on Global TV nationally. 

Jim Mullin was responsible for the play-by-play broadcast duties from 2006 until the series end in 2016. Colour announcers included former Saskatchewan Huskies quarterback Laurence Nixon, former Hec Crighton Trophy winner and Canadian Football League running back Jesse Lumsden, Saskatoon-based broadcaster Wray Morrison, Krown Countdown U analyst Gord Randall and former CFL player Daved Benefield. Andy Neal handled the hosting duties. It was announced before the start of the 2012 season that Canada West had renewed their agreement with Shaw for another three seasons. 

In 2009, Shaw broadcast provincial curling championships for men and women in Manitoba, Alberta and British Columbia. In 2013, Rogers Sportsnet obtained the rights for Manitoba's and Alberta's playdowns. It was announced by Curl BC prior to Shaw's coverage in 2013 that the broadcast rights for BC will move to Sportsnet for 2014.

In 2012, Shaw broadcast the CIS Final Eight Women's Basketball Championship a.k.a. The Bronze Baby from the University of Calgary and shared the feed with NBA TV Canada.

All of Shaw TV's network sports coverage ceased with the CRTC-approved closure of the Shaw TV channels in Calgary, Edmonton, Alberta and Vancouver, British Columbia, and the renaming to Shaw Spotlight.

Controversies
Some concern has been raised about the company putting business interests over public-access/community interests, and has led one community group to consider creating an alternative, independent local public-access service in Vancouver.
