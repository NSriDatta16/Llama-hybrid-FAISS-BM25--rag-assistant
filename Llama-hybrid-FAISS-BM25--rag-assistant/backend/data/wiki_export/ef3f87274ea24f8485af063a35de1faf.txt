Plot 
Sivagiri alias Giri is a bladesmith in a remote village near Thirupaachi and has a lovable sister named Karpagam. Giri runs into some hilarious incidents while searching locally for a groom for his sister, where he confides to his friend Kannapan that he wants his sister to be in a good city after her marriage. Giri also nods his acceptance when a city guy proposes to Karpagam, where he also accompanies the newlyweds to Chennai and finds a girl named Subha and they both fall in love after initial mishaps. On a trip to Chennai, Giri rescues a court witness from a goon named Pattasu Balu, who dominates Central Chennai and also learns about another local goon Pan Parag Ravi, who controls North Chennai and troubles Karpagam's husband's canteen business. 

In an altercation in a cinema theatre, Kannapan gets murdered by a don named Saniyan Sagadai, who dominates South Chennai. Karpagam's husband tells Giri to leave Chennai if he wants his sister to be happy. After Kannapan's funeral, Giri leaves his hometown, stating that he got a job in a cloth manufacturing company, but actually comes with a mission in Chennai. Giri tells Sagadai that the latter will be killed by him and also calls ACP Raj Guru and warns him that he will finish all gangsters in Chennai. Later, Giri's friend Inspector Veluchamy learns about this and Giri challenges him that he will give up this mission when Veluchamy keeps a goon in prison at least for a single day. However, Balu kills Veluchamy's son, which makes Veluchamy help Giri in his mission. 

Veluchamy and Giri list the crime network of Chennai by providing the specification of their locations in various areas and also write their names in papers, where he randomly chooses and kills Balu. Later, Giri provokes Ravi to kill his own brother by sticking funeral posters of Ravi and making him think that his brother is the person who is killing people in Chennai. After the death of Ravi's brother, Ravi realizes his brother has not stuck the funeral posters and hides himself in a politician's house in order to save himself from Giri. The politician damages his car and house and makes the police believe that someone has attacked his house, which makes the police provide security for the politician. Veluchamy finds out that Ravi is hiding in the politician's place. Giri wants Veluchamy to disband the police protection. 

However, Veluchamy refuses as the police are assigned the responsibility to protect the public, but can only inform Giri, who has to kill Ravi. Later on, Giri brings a group of rally people who lost their money to a fraud financier and makes them believe that he is hiding in the politician's place. With the rally, Giri enters Ravi's fort and kills him. Raj inquires about the people who were involved in the rally regarding Giri's identity, but to no avail. Raj's daughter is willing to die rather than reveal Giri's identity as she was rescued from Balu by Giri earlier. Later, Giri decides to kill Sagadai and warns him, where Sagadai seeks the protection of a mass group of thugs from Chennai. Giri uses this as a chance to destroy the entire underworld and ignites a war between the police group and gangsters in a very diplomatic manner. 

Giri disguises himself as an Inspector and enters Sagadai's fort. Veluchamy helps Giri in his mission by hurting himself. Raj orders his squad to hit the thugs. Giri enters the house in a police uniform, where he confronts a thug and forces him to wear a police uniform. After that, Giri shoots and kills the thug and throws him out of the window. Thinking that one of his fellow officers is dead, Raj orders to open fire. All the thugs are killed, but they realize Giri's trick and run upstairs to find him. Giri fights and stabs Sagadai he throws him to the ground right before the birth of a new year. Subha welcomes Giri, Karpagam and her husband once again after returning home. Giri gives his necklace to Subha and they reunite with each other.

Reception

Critical response 
Behindwoods wrote: "Another tailor-made role for Vijay, Tiruppachi scores with its impressive screenplay. Although the story is the perennial tear-jerker of a brother's affection for his sister, the packaging will attract the audience". Indiaglitz wrote: "It is a film for Vijay's fans who love their star to dance with energy, fight with enthusiasm and love with mischief. He does all this in his usual style. Punchline dialogues, songs glorifying hero find their place in all throughout the movie". Malini Mannath wrote for Chennai Online: "It's a debutant's work, but director Perarasu reveals an appreciable grasp of the medium. Rehashing the by-now-familiar story line of a rural youth's trip to the big bad city of Chennai, his taking on the anti-social elements single-handedly, Perarasu tries to make slight variations within the parameters of this scenario, weaving in the right dose of humour, action and sentiment and succeeds in presenting a film that is fast-paced and engaging from the opening to the final scene. Except when the dances intrude". Sify wrote: "Vijay has stuck to his regular formula – five songs, flying fights, crass comedy, punch line dialogues, dream songs in foreign locales and corny sentiments. So if you have seen earlier films of the superstar you may strive hard to find anything new in Tirupachi, which is old wine served in a new bottle, with a different label. Ananda Vikatan rated the film 40 out of 100. Visual Dasan of Kalki called Thirupaachi not only the angry brother but also the masala king.

Box office 
The film released on the Pongal festival in Tamil Nadu alongside Ayya and with Dhanush starrer Devathayai Kanden. The film opened up to full houses with 80 percent occupancy from Chennai and other districts of the state. After taking a fantastic opening for the first week, the film took a slight fall in crowd for the second week. The film completed and 175-day theatrical run run  at Tamilnadu.

Controversy 
After Thirupaachi's release, Super Good Films was sued by Godrej Sara Lee Ltd. for what they considered "defamatory, prejudicial, offensive and slanderous" use of the mosquito spray HIT, of which they are the trademark owners. Godrej eventually won the case, obtaining "an order of permanent injunction and damages" worth 500,000 from Super Good Films.
