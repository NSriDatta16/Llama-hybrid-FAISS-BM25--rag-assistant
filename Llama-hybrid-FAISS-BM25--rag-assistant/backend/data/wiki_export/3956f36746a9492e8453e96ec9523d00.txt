Penryn Athletic Football Club was formed in October 1963 by a group of schoolboys, who after playing in the County youth system the joined the Falmouth/Helston League Division two in 1965, as a men's team. Twelve years later in 1977 Penryn were elected to the Cornwall Combination League. During their time in the Cornwall combination the club went on to win the league three times in the 1981–82, 1982–83 and 1984–85 seasons.  After the last of the Cornwall Combination league titles the club joined the South Western League in 1985 for a single season, returning to the Combination League again. They remained in the Cornwall combination league, winning six more league titles, until the 2000–01 season when they joined the South Western league.

In 2002 the club gained the FA's Charter Standard Community Club status after they linked up with local youth team Falmouth United.

The 2005–06 season saw floodlights erected at the Kernick ground. On the football side, the 2005–06 season saw them as runners up in the South Western League Cup, losing out in the replay to South Western league winners, Bodmin Town. Also that season, they reached the first round of the FA Vase, and in 2006–07 they entered the FA Cup for the first time, losing 3–2 in the preliminary round to Slimbridge.
