911: In Plane Site: Director's Cut is a 2004 documentary which promotes 9/11 conspiracy theories. Photographs and video footage from the September 11 attacks are presented and the documentary claims that the public was not given all of the facts surrounding the terrorist attack. It was directed by William Lewis.

Claims 
The films ask a series of leading questions about 9/11 conspiracy theories. Despite the film's assertions that "a jetliner is too large to fit into the hole made in The Pentagon," others have refuted this claim by showing that a hole of over  in width was made on the first floor.  Films such as In Plane Site and Loose Change only refer to the smaller hole on the second floor.

Reviews 

A short review in The Portland Mercury says of In Plane Site, "it features both an exceedingly annoying crackpot theorist and outlandish, unsubstantiated allegations about blurrily pixelized photos that don't really show anything".

Another review at Heraldextra.com states, "Nor does the presentation explain, if the attack planes were military, what happened to the commercial planes. It hints that they might have been shot down over the ocean. The trouble is that they weren't necessarily over the ocean. And who remembers an Atlantic crash of an airliner where debris such as luggage did not wash up all up and down the Eastern seaboard? If airliners went down in the sea, the secret could not have been kept for long.  It's fine to be entertained by this stuff, even if it is a bit morbid. But let's not lose our senses."  In the documentary von Kleist says the purpose of the documentary was not to provide explanations, but to raise questions:

You know, there are those that see these pictures and hear this information for the first time. They inevitably ask the question, "Well if the plane didn't hit the Pentagon, where did it go?" The answer is, I don't know where it went. For all I know, it could be sitting in 200 feet of water in the Atlantic Ocean. But then again, I didn't say that Flight 77 hit the Pentagon. That was [the mainstream media]. The question should be, if Flight 77 hit the Pentagon, then where is it?"
