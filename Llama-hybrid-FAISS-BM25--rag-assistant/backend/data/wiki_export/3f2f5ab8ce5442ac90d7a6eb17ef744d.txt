Works

Milton's "Checkmate in Berlin" explores post-war Berlin from 1945 to 1949, focusing on the city's division between the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. "D-Day: The Soldiers' Story" focuses on the experiences of survivors during Operation Overlord, giving voice to unheard accounts. "Churchill's Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare" contains the story of a secret irregular warfare organization and its missions during World War II.

"Fascinating Footnotes From History" is a collection of lesser-known stories from world history, featuring topics like Adolf Hitler's cocaine use, Joseph Stalin's criminal experience, and other anecdotes about famous historical figures. The stories have been drawn from Milton's research and previously published as separate e-books. The book is available in the United States as two volumes, titled "When Hitler Took Cocaine and Lenin Lost His Brain: History's Unknown Chapters" and "When Churchill Slaughtered Sheep and Stalin Robbed A Bank."

"Russian Roulette" is an historical account of British spies who were sent to Soviet Russia after the 1917 Bolshevik revolution, aiming to thwart Lenin's plans. The book is based on previously unknown secret documents found in archives.

"Wolfram: The Boy Who Went to War" tells the story of Wolfram Aichele, a young artist who grew up during the Third Reich. The book follows his life, including his time in the Reich Labour Service, his experiences in the war, and his time as a prisoner of war.

Paradise Lost: Smyrna 1922 is a historical narrative that recounts the sacking of Smyrna (modern-day Izmir) and the subsequent population exchange between Turkey and Greece in 1922. The book makes use of unpublished diaries and letters written by Smyrna's Levantine elite to provide an impartial perspective on this event. It has been praised for its balanced approach to history and has been published in both Turkish and Greek. The narrative provides a day-by-day account of the events that took place when the Turkish army entered Smyrna, looking closely at the individuals involved and the humanitarian efforts made by American charity workers.
