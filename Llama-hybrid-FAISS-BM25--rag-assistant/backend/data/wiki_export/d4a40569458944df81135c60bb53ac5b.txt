The Palos Verdes Library District (PVLD) is an independent special library district serving the residents of the Palos Verdes Peninsula in Southern California. PVLD is governed by a publicly elected Board of Trustees that consists of five members who voluntarily serve without monetary compensation. PVLD's three libraries - Peninsula Center Library, Malaga Cove Library, and Miraleste Library - serve the cities of Palos Verdes Estates, Rancho Palos Verdes, Rolling Hills Estates, and Rolling Hills, California.

History

Palos Verdes Library District also has two branch libraries, Malaga Cove Library and Miraleste Library. Malaga Cove Library, adjacent to Farnham Martin Park in the City of Palos Verdes Estates, was designed by Myron Hunt and built in 1929. It was designated as a historical landmark in 1980 by the Rancho de los Palos Verdes Historical Society and placed on the National Register of Historic Places and the California register of Historical Resources in 1995.
