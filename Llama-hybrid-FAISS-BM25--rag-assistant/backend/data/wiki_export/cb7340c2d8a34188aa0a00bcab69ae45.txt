Benjamin Horace (Ben) Weese (born 1929) in Evanston, Illinois is an American architect hailing from Chicago, and a member of the architects group, the Chicago Seven. Weese is the younger brother of Chicago architect Harry Weese.

He received BArch and MArch degrees from Harvard University, and a certificate from the Ã‰cole des Beaux-Arts in Fontainebleau, France. He returned to Chicago in 1957 into his older brother's firm, Harry Weese Associates, which specialized in urban renewal and subsidized housing projects. In the late 1970s, he was a member of the Chicago Seven, a group which emerged in opposition to the doctrinal application of modernism, as represented particularly in Chicago by the followers of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe.

In 1977, Weese opened his own firm, Weese Seegers Hickey Weese, with his wife. This turned out to be an award-winning firm, later becoming Weese Langley Weese, and is known for non-profit and educational projects with an emphasis on historical appreciation and preservation. Ben is suffering from dementia currently and is confined in an assisting living facility.
