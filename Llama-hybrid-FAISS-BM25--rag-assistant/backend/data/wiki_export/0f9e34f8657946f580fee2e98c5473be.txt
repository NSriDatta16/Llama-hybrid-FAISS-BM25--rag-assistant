All About Eve is the self-titled debut album of All About Eve. Commercially, this was their most successful, reaching No. 7 in the UK charts and spawning four Top 40 singles (one of which went top 10). Most of the album was produced by Paul Samwell-Smith.

Release
Some of the earlier cassette versions of the album had the album title Flowers in Our Hair printed on both sides of the tape, instead of All About Eve.

Although drummer Mark Price was a full-time member of the band when this album was completed, he was not present for all of its recording. Some songs feature Mick Brown, on loan from The Mission, one features session drummer Greg Brimstone, and one features a drum machine.

The album spent 29 weeks in the UK top 100 album charts, and is certified Gold with in excess of 100,000 units being sold.

All About Eve was bolstered by several singles preceding and following the album's February 1988 release: "In the Clouds" charted at No. 47 on the UK Singles Chart, "Wild Hearted Woman"/"Apple Tree Man" at No. 33, "Every Angel" at No. 30, "Martha's Harbour" at No. 10, and "What Kind of Fool" at No. 29. A different version of "Flowers in Our Hair" was released as a single (no chart position) under the band's own "Eden" label before they signed to Mercury and recorded this album.

In return for Julianne Regan helping out on backing vocals for The Mission's first studio album, God's Own Medicine, Wayne Hussey lent his backing vocals to the song "Shelter from the Rain". Hussey and his bandmate Simon Hinkler also produced "Lady Moonlight".

"She Moves Through the Fair" is the only non-All About Eve composition on the album, it being a traditional Irish folk song.

One of the B-sides to the single "What Kind of Fool" was "The Garden of Jane Delawney", originally by Trees.

Track listing
All songs written and composed by Tim Bricheno, Andy Cousin and Julianne Regan except where noted.
