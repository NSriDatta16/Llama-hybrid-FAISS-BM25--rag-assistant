Farmers harvest 15,000 sacks of corn per square kilometre, which is twice the national average.  Usually corn is rotated with soybeans.  There was one financial institution—Banco Itaú—in 2007.

Tourism
Tourism has become important in recent years with the proximity of the Chapada dos Veadeiros National Park.   There are several waterfalls in the region, with the Cachoeira Extrema or Label being the highest: 130 meters of direct fall.  It is still quite inaccessible and it is necessary to walk three hours to reach it.  The vegetation and fauna are very rich in the area.  In the cerrado there are a minimum of 837 species of birds and 161 species of mammals.

History
São João began as a farm in the nineteenth century.  In 1910, it was Arraial Capetinga, consisting of same grass huts, two houses covered with tiles, and a chapel dedicated to Saint John the Baptist.  In 1931 it became a municipality only to revert to a district of Formosa in 1939.  Finally in 1953 it was re-established as a municipality.  With the construction of Brasília and a relative proximity to that important city, farmers from the south began to arrive and buy inexpensive land to plant soybeans.
