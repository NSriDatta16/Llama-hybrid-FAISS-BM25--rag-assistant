During the 2006 protests, in opposition to the results of the 2006 Presidential Elections, Dynko was detained at a protest rally on March 21, 2006, and spent ten days in a jail. His prison diaries were published thereafter and translated in a number of languages. The arrest was used by the authorities as the reason to refuse registration to 'Nasha Niva'.

Arrest 

Following the nation-wide protests in Belarus after the  2020 presidential election that was denounced as rigged by the opposition and the West, the authorities started a crackdown campaign wiping all independent media in the country. ‘Nasha Niva’ covered the protests and was eventually banned as ‘extremist’ in November 2021, exactly on the 115th anniversary of its founding; its website was blocked in July.

By 2021 Dynko was serving as chief editor of the ‘Nasha Historyja’ (Наша гісторыя), the Arche, and the «Асцярожна: дзеці!» magazines, also published by ‘Nasha Niva’.
On July 8, 2021, Dyńko was arrested together with Nasha Niva editor-in-chief Yahor Martsinovich and editor Andrey Skurko. He was declared suspected first under the article 342 of the Criminal Code of Belarus («Organisation or preparation of mass disturbances or participation in mass disturbances»). The accusation was not submitted. Instead the detention continued under suspect under the art. 216 part 2 of the Criminal Code of Belarus («Causing property damage without signs of theft»). Like other political prisoners, he stayed in Akrescina prison without any bedding and personal belongings in cells where light was never switched off.

On July 12, 2021, by a joint statement of ten organizations, including the Human rights center "Viasna", the Belarusian Association of Journalists, the Belarusian Helsinki Committee, the Belarusian PEN Center, he was recognized as a political prisoner.

On July 21, 2021, Dynko was released under an undertaking to appear. He described his detainment as ‘being in hell’. According to Dynko, the detained in Okrestina are kept in inhuman conditions.
