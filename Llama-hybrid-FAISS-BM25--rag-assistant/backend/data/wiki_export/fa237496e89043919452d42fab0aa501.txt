Plot
Music student Nancy, the 19-year-old daughter of real estate broker Frank Benson and his wife Elaine, wants to marry fellow music student David, the 20-year-old son of Oliver Poe, a record producer. What the bride doesn't know is that her parents are getting a divorce. Oliver Poe is opposed to marriage and forbids the children from planning their marriage. He discovers and exposes the Bensons' secret. Nancy and David decline this unnecessary marriage. They will live together instead, traveling around the country with a rock band and heeding the advice and wisdom of a Persian mystic called the Baba Zeba. Frank and Elaine see other people. He is involved with a divorc√©e, Lois Grey, while she is developing an interest in Phil Fletcher, who is recently divorced. Poe meets LaVerne Baker, who becomes his live-in girlfriend. One day, Nancy finds out she is pregnant. The Baba Zeba, paid off by Oliver, persuades Nancy to put up the baby for adoption. Frank and Elaine conspire behind their daughter's back to adopt their own grandchild. Complications arise, resulting in Frank trying to bribe the Baba Zeba and disguising himself as one of the guru's followers. The Bensons are reunited, David and Nancy have a baby, and Poe and LaVerne are married.
