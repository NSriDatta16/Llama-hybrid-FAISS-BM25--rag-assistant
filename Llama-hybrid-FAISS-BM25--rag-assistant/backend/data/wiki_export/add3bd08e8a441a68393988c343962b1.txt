Henry Wilbraham (25 July 1825 – 13 February 1883) was an English mathematician.  He is known for discovering and explaining the Gibbs phenomenon nearly fifty years before J. Willard Gibbs did. Gibbs and Maxime Bôcher, as well as nearly everyone else, were unaware of Wilbraham's paper on the Gibbs phenomenon.
