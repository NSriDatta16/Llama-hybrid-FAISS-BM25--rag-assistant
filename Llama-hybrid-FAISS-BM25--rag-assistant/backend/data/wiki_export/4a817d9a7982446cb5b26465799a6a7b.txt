The Lexus LF line is a series of concept cars built by Lexus, the luxury vehicle division of Toyota Motor Corporation. The "LF" designation refers to Lexus Future. The LF Series vehicles features coupes/convertibles, including: the LF-A, the LF-A Roadster, LF-LC, LF-CC, and the LF-C; sedans: the LF-S, LF-Sh, and LF-Gh; crossover SUVs: the LF-X and LF-Xh; and hatchbacks: the LF-Ch. The first concept vehicle of the LF Series, the LF-X, appeared in 2003. The LF Series utilizes L-finesse, a design philosophy named for "Leading Edge" and "finesse", which debuted on the LF Series concepts and later extended to all new production Lexus vehicles. New vehicle technologies on the LF Series include advanced instrumentation, multiple driver-selected vehicle configurations, hybrid and experimental powertrains, and unconventional driver interface designs. The vehicles also feature new design cues which derive from the L-finesse design language of "Intriguing Elegance" (純), "Incisive Simplicity" (妙), and "Seamless Anticipation" (予). Several of the LF concept vehicles have appeared close to their production counterparts, while the design cues of other LF concepts appeared on more distinctly different production vehicles.

LF-A

The LF-A is a 2-door exotic concept car built as a prospective halo car for the Lexus division. Three versions have been shown, the first of which debuted at the 2005 North American International Auto Show (NAIAS). The designation stands for Lexus Future-Advance. The first concept was about five inches shorter than the Porsche 911 Turbo (996) with a wheelbase about nine inches longer, and was nearly  in height about equal to the Ferrari F430 with a width of .  It was powered by a V10 engine displacing 4.8 liters, generating over  and had a top speed around . To maintain a near ideal weight distribution a rear transaxle is used and the radiators are mounted at the rear.  A second revised version with a more completely furnished interior and exterior was unveiled two years later at the 2007 NAIAS as a possible future member of the Lexus F marque performance lineup.  The interior gauges revealed a 9,000 RPM redline, however news reports speculated that it might not make the production version. The third version of the LF-A concept, a roadster model, premiered in 2008.

Reports in 2006 indicated that the LF-A concept car had received the green-light for production. Prototypes of the LF-A had been spotted regularly undergoing testing at Nürburgring since October 2004, the famous motorsport race track in Nürburg, Germany. Numerous test vehicles have been equipped with automatic retractable rear wings, and carbon ceramic brake discs. The production vehicles were expected to carry V10 engines, putting the car in market competition with the Lamborghini Gallardo, Ferrari F430, the Porsche 911 (997), and the Chevrolet Corvette C6 ZR1. Pricing was estimated at over $225,000, and close to $400,000. In December 2007, Auto Express reported that the LF-A had set an unofficial 7:24 lap record at the Nürburgring. The production $375,000 Lexus LFA supercar debuted in 2009.

On August 12, 2009, news reports suggested that the LF-A would be released as the LF-L, with the change in name from A to L to signify its appearances at Le Mans and to draw on its pre-production racing development. However, a production non-convertible designated LFA premiered in October 2009.

LF-C

The LF-C is a concept car Lexus unveiled at the 2004 New York Auto Show. This concept featured a retractable hardtop design which allowed for coupe, convertible, targa, or speedster configurations via a four-position glass roof.

LF-Ch

The LF-Ch is a concept four-door hatchback Lexus unveiled in September 2009 at the Frankfurt International Motor Show.  The designation refers to Lexus Future-Compact hybrid. The LF-Ch exterior featured a more aggressive interpretation of the L-finesse design language, with an arching roofline, rear spoiler, and single-bar grille. The rear door handles were integrated into the C-pillar window trim. The concept was equipped with a hybrid 2.4 L inline-four gasoline engine with an electric motor. Inside, the LF-Ch featured wood, polished aluminum, and semi-aniline leather, along with paddle shifters, a turbine-style instrument panel, and Lexus' Remote Touch control interface with pop-up information screen. The rear seat featured entertainment options in the form of headrest-mounted iPhone docks.

The LF-Ch was intended to preview a forthcoming premium compact vehicle, which was expected to enter production in the near future and targeted at European markets. Such a vehicle, originally codenamed C-Premium in early press reports, was designated CT 200h, CT 300h, or CT 400h in trademark applications filed in June 2009 in the US and in Canada. The LF-Ch concept measured  long,  wide, and  in height, with a wheelbase of . It may very well presumptively be a Lexus based on the Toyota Corolla.

The LF-Gh is a rear wheel drive hybrid platform powered by a Lexus Hybrid Drive powertrain. The LF-Gh also provide a hint of what future Lexus models, mainly the Lexus GS which was scheduled for late 2011, might look like. The front and the back of the LF-Gh is equipped with LED headlights, daytime running lights, and taillights. To improve aerodynamics the LF-Gh's door handles are sealed into the door panel and could be pushed to open out. the large spindle grille on the front of the LF-Gh brings out the aggressiveness of the design. Though the interior has been teased online, Lexus never once opened the doors of the LF-Gh to reveal the full interior, which is why most critics are rumoring that the LF-Gh is a nutshell concept, in which only the exterior has purpose, and the inside components are not made up.

LF-LC

Designated LF-LC for Lexus Future-Luxury Coupe, the concept two-door vehicle premiered in January 2012 at the North American International Auto Show.  The vehicle's exterior and interior styling was created by the Calty Design Research center in Newport Beach, California, which previously developed the exterior styling of the first generation Lexus SC coupe and the fourth generation Lexus GS. The LF-LC features the brand's spindle-shaped grille which debuted several months prior on the fourth generation Lexus GS.

The LF-LC features a front-engine, rear-wheel drive drivetrain layout, which incorporates a next-generation Advanced Lexus Hybrid Drive system. The interior features a remote touchscreen control system linked to two  liquid crystal display (LCD) screens that measure  in width. Smartphone-size touchscreens are placed on the door armrests for additional controls.

The LF-LC was produced as a design study for a driver-focused vehicle at the direction of the Lexus Center in Japan, and work began on the concept in May 2010.  The exterior appearance of the LF-LC was inadvertently leaked by Road & Track magazine several weeks prior to its scheduled auto show debut, a preview of its February 2012 issue with the LF-LC on its cover (under the headline "Stunning! New Lexus Super Coupe") was posted to YouTube.

During the North American International Auto Show, Mark Templin; the vice president and general manager of Toyota's Lexus Division responded to a reporter "Would you like to see (the LF-LC) to be the next generation SC?. In a report from Autocars, Karl Schlicht, head of Lexus product planning, reportedly gave the LF-LC concept vehicle a 50/50 chance at making production in the future According to a report from Automotive News, the Lexus LF-LC concept is now headed for the showroom in the near future and could be production ready within three years. It is unclear if the new coupe will wear the SC nameplate or continued on with its concept name LC. However, this new coupe would filled the gap of the discontinued SC430 and finally give Lexus a much needed Nissan GT-R or Acura NSX rival. It has now officially confirmed the LF-LC for production. Lexus International executive vice-president Kazuo Ohara says the LF-LC coupe would be an all-new car, possibly built from a newly developed set of underpinnings, that would take around four years to make it to production.

A series production model inspired by the 2012 LF-LC Concept is being developed under the Toyota 950A development program. Introduced at the 2016 North American International Auto Show, it went on sale as the LC500 in the second quarter of 2017, based on the new Toyota GA-L modular rear-wheel drive platform and the fifth generation LS flagship.

The LF-S is a concept luxury sedan which Lexus unveiled in October 2003 at the Tokyo Motor Show, signalling its intentions to launch Lexus in its home country.  The designation stands for Lexus Future-Sedan. Unique features of the LF-S concept included side-mounted cameras instead of mirrors, an air stream style windshield cleansing system, transparent panoramic roof with security illumination, and keyless entry. Design cues from the LF-S, particularly the slingshot cabin, sleek profile, and rear deck lid, appeared in the third generation Lexus GS production sedan.  The vehicle was designed to seat 5 passengers.

The LF-S was powered by a high-output hybrid V8 system with all-wheel drive, marking the conceptual debut of a Lexus vehicle with hybrid technology (the first luxury hybrid, the RX 400h, subsequently premiered in 2005 with a V6 hybrid powertrain, and in 2007 the LS 600h and LS 600h L hybrids debuted with hybrid V8 systems).

LF-Sh

Production concept luxury sedan.  The LF-Sh was developed to preview the fourth generation Lexus LS.  The LF-Sh featured LED headlamps, hybrid all-wheel drive, and exhaust vents integrated into the rear bumper.  The designation refers to Lexus Future-Sedan hybrid. Although the LF-Sh debuted before the LS 460 and shared identical exterior dimensions as the standard wheelbase version of the fourth generation LS sedan, it was a subsequent development, thus it did not particularly influence the production model.

Multiple details on the LF-Sh as a result, differed from the production model.  Among them, the integrated exhaust vents were instead a seamless one-piece design versus a chrome-plated version.  The LED headlamps did not appear on the standard production LS 460, but did later debut on the hybrid ultra-luxury LS 600h / LS 600h L.  The long wheelbase model LS 460 L is a lengthened version of the LF-Sh/LS 460 standard wheelbase design.

The LF-Sh concept premiered at the Tokyo Motor Show in late 2005, following the debut of Lexus in the home market of Japan, and predating the January 2006 debut of the LS 460 North America. The LF-Sh concept was not fitted with an interior, allowing the interior reveal of the LS 460 to occur at the North American International Auto Show in 2006.
