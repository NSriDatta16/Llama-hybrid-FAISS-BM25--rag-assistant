Laune Rangers is a Gaelic football and Hurling club based in town of Killorglin, County Kerry, Ireland.  The club is affiliated to Kerry GAA.  Rangers won the All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship in 1996.

History
The club was formed in 1888 by two teachers. The newly formed club won the Kerry County Championship of 1889 and 1890. In 1890, after again winning the County Championship, Rangers represented Kerry in the All-Ireland series. They defeated Clondrohid 3-6 to 0-5 and won the Munster final but lost the All-Ireland Final.  The first recorded match the club played was against John Mitchels in 1888. The club's finest hour came when they won the All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship in 1996 beating Éire Óg of Carlow in the final.

Famous players have included Mike & Liam Hassett, Peter Crowley and Mike Frank Russell, all of whom have won All-Ireland Senior Football Championship titles with the Kerry county team.
