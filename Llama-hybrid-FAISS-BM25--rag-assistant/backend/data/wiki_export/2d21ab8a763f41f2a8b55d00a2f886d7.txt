The Lancia Lybra (Type 839) is a compact executive car manufactured and marketed by Fiat's premium division, Lancia  between 1998 and 2005, based on the Alfa Romeo 156 floorpan, and  replacing the Dedra in Lancia's range. Like the Dedra, the Lybra was available as a Berlina (saloon) or a Station Wagon (estate). A total of 164.660 units were made.

Name

The model's name refers to the zodiac sign of Libra, and signalled an end to Lancia's Greek letter model name convention. The Lybra was manufactured in the Rivalta plant near Turin until 2002 and after that in Mirafiori plant in Turin.

Styling

The Lybra was styled in Centro Stile Lancia, contrary to earlier Lancia models, which were commissioned from external design studios.   Initial models were carried out by Enrico Fumia in 1992 and by the time of His departure from Centro Stile Lancia the project was finished by Michael Robinson. The interior was designed by Flavio Manzoni.

The Lybra's distinctive taillights were given to the 2001 facelift of the Fiat Marea sedan for the Latin American markets.
