Prince Ananias was the first operetta composed by Victor Herbert. The libretto is by Francis Neilson.  It was first produced by a troupe called "The Bostonians" at The Broadway Theatre on November 20, 1894, directed by Jerome Sykes.  It remained in their repertoire for three seasons and was given more than 300 performances in all.  A modest success at first, it did well on tour.

Synopsis

Arriving at the court of King Boniface, a touring troupe of players finds that the king has lost his ability to laugh.  They are tasked with finding his sense of humor; the penalty for failure is death.  They produce a work, Prince Ananias, that is not well-received, except that the title character is so inept that the king bursts out laughing.  Thus, the players have a happy ending, as do the several pairs of lovers who overcome various romantic and backstage complications.
