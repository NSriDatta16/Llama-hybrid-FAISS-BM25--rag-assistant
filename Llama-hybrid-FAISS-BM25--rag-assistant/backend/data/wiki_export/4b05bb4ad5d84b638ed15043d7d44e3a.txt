Tarleton Academy is a secondary Academy situated in Tarleton, Lancashire, England; the headteacher is Simon Day. The school caters for 11 to 16-year-olds. The academy is scheduled a complete building renewal to be completed in September 2023, with a total cost of 23 million pounds.

The school celebrated its silver jubilee in September 1987.

Facilities
The school has its own swimming pool facilities, which the school operates itself and are used by local primary schools. In 2003, the school secured a £850,000 bid to build a new sports hall, after going 30 years without one. The sports hall can accommodate four badminton courts, and was completed in 2004. There had been plans to build a sports hall as far back as 1991, when a proposed £350,000 scheme was to be part funded by £180,000 from the council and £75,000 from the Sports Council, however Lancashire County Council failed to commit funds to the scheme and it was shelved.

Academy status
In late November 2011, as part of the school's conversion to Academy status, the Governing Body announced that the school would be renamed as Tarleton Academy from January 2012.
