Molybdenum(V) chloride is the inorganic compound with the empirical formula . This dark volatile solid is used in research to prepare other molybdenum compounds. It is moisture-sensitive and soluble in chlorinated solvents.

Structure
Usually called molybdenum pentachloride, it is in fact partly a dimer with the molecular formula . In the dimer, each molybdenum has local octahedral symmetry and two chlorides bridge between the molybdenum centers. A similar structure is also found for the pentachlorides of W, Nb and Ta. In the gas phase and partly in solution, the dimers partially dissociate to give a monomeric . The monomer is paramagnetic, with one unpaired electron per Mo center, reflecting the fact that the formal oxidation state is +5, leaving one valence electron on the metal center.

Preparation and properties
 is prepared by chlorination of Mo metal but also chlorination of . The unstable hexachloride  is not produced in this way.

 is reduced by acetonitrile to afford an orange acetonitrile complex, . This complex in turn reacts with THF to give , a precursor to other molybdenum-containing complexes.

Molybdenum(IV) bromide is prepared by treatment of  with hydrogen bromide:

The reaction proceeds via the unstable molybdenum(V) bromide, which releases bromine at room temperature.

 is a good Lewis acid toward non-oxidizable ligands. It forms an adduct with chloride to form . In organic synthesis, the compound finds occasional use in chlorinations, deoxygenation, and oxidative coupling reactions.

Reactions
 is reduced by acetonitrile:

Although it polymerizes tetrahydrofuran,  is stable in diethyl ether. Reduction of such solutions with tin gives  and , depending on conditions.

Safety considerations
 is an aggressive oxidant and readily hydrolyzes to release HCl.
