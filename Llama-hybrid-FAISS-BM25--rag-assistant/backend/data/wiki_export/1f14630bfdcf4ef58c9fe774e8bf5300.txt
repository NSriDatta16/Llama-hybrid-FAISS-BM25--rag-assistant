Mineola High School is a public high school in the Mineola Union Free School District and is located in Garden City Park, New York. It serves Mineola, as well as certain parts of Albertson, Williston Park, Garden City Park, and Roslyn Heights.

History 
The current high school opened in 1962, replacing the old high school, built in 1927, which now houses the Mineola Middle School. In 2016, the high school underwent a multimillion-dollar renovation, which included the refurbishment of the school's library. Since 1981, it has been fully accredited by the Middle States Evaluation Committee.

Mineola's mascot is the Mustang, which replaced the original “Maroon” mascot in the early 1960s.

The Mineola Union Free School District was recognized as being one of the best communities for music education in the United States from 2009 to 2022. In the winter months the Mineola Colorguard produces two indoor performance ensembles. Mineola White is composed of first-year members and competes in the Scholastic Novice Class in local competition. Mineola Red, an all-veteran ensemble, competes nationally in Winter Guard International (WGI).
