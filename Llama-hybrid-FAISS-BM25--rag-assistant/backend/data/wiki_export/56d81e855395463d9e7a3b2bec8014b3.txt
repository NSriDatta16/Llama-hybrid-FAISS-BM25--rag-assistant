Bowling railway station serves the village of Bowling in the West Dunbartonshire region of Scotland. This station is on the North Clyde Line, 12¼ miles (20 km) west of Glasgow Queen Street.

The station is managed by ScotRail who also provide the train service.  It was opened in 1858 by the Glasgow, Dumbarton and Helensburgh Railway, though Bowling had received its first railway several years earlier courtesy of the  Caledonian and Dumbartonshire Junction Railway (whose Bowling Pier terminal linked into the steamer service along the  River Clyde).

The station was made famous by a 1960 painting by the renowned railway artist, the late Terence Cuneo, who depicted a then new Blue train (Class 303) heading westbound into Bowling, passing a steam engine, which the 303 had replaced, in a siding. The painting was used as a poster 'Glasgow Electric'.

Accidents and incidents
On 8 September 1933, a passenger train collided with wagons on the line due to a signalman's error. Five people were injured.

In October 2023, severe flooding took place around the River Clyde following a severe weather warning from the Met Office. The Glasgow Times described the station as being "underwater" while The Herald called the station "inundated with muddy water...[the] flood rising almost to the platform’s edge".
