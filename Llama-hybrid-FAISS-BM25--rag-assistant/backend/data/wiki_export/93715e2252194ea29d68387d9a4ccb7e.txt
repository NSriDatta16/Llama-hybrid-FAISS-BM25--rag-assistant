Vaccinium reticulatum, known as  in Hawaiian, is a species of flowering plant in the heather family, Ericaceae, that is endemic to Hawaii. It grows at altitudes of  on lava flows and freshly disturbed volcanic ash on Maui and Hawaii, and less commonly on Kauai, Oahu, and Molokai. Adaptations to volcanic activity include the ability to survive ash falls of over  depth.

Description
 is a shrub usually  tall, rarely up to . The leaves are evergreen, spirally arranged, leathery, oval,  long, red when freshly emerging, then green or green with reddish patches. The flowers are bell-shaped,  long, variable in color, red to yellow or pink.

Fruit
The fruit is an edible berry  diameter, ranging in color from blue to purple to red to orange to yellow. The color does not necessarily indicate the ripeness of the berries. The berries taste somewhat similar to the related cranberries, less ripe ones being tart, while ripe berries are quite sweet but bland. They are an important food source for the nēnē (Branta sandvicensis); the seeds are dispersed in the birds' droppings (endozoochory).

Uses
Oligomeric proanthocyanidins (OPC) can be obtained by the means of V. pahalae in vitro cell culture.
