Drowning with Land in Sight is the seventh studio album by American rock band The 77s. It was released in 1994 on Myrrh Records. The music, their heaviest up to that point, ranged from the opening note-for-note Led Zeppelin cover to the straightforward Rolling Stones homage "Cold Cold Night" to Roy Orbison-influenced ballads "Film at 11", "The Jig Is Up", and "Alone Together". The lyrics primarily reflected the stress of singer Michael Roe's divorce, except for "Dave's Blues", about guitarist David Leonhardt's illness with cancer. At the record label's insistence, the final track was written and added to provide a more upbeat conclusion.  Also, a vulgarity in "Dave's Blues" was backward masked into unintelligibility.
