History

The founding
HK Drott was founded on 10 March 1936 by Lars-Erik Dymne, Erik Månsson, Arvid Fridh and Ingvar Svensson, all 13 years of age; the club was originally formed as a football club. A few games were then played in 1937, with HK Drott winning all games played in the rural areas, while at least 3 of the games played in town were lost. The club also bought their first sports kit, based on the Arsenal F.C. model, and for practice the club rented I 16's gym. When playing away against Laholm, the club members pretended to be children to be able to buy the cheaper children's tickets.

Several more football matches were played in 1938, but during this year handball became stronger within the club and the first handball matches were played against Läroverkets realskolelag. At this time no centre halves were used so only 6 outfielders and 3 substitutes were used. In 1939 the football part of the club lost a number of key players to their larger local rivals, the same year the handball section successfully filed for entrance to both the Swedish Sports Confederation and Swedish Handball Federation, and the club participated in Division 3.

In 1940 it was decided to shut down the football section completely and on 20 September the same year the name was changed from Fotbollsklubben, F.C., to Handbollsklubben Drott. The club also ended up last in Div. 3 the same year. Drott ended up last in 1941 as well, however Halmstads BK declined its place in Div. 2 and the Federation called for a playoff for the position between newly demoted IF Cate and HK Drott. Cate won the game by 10–0. To celebrate the club's 5 years of existence a tournament was played between all the teams in the Halmstad, which was won by IS Halmia. The club's first success came in 1942 as it was able to win Div. 3 and gain promotion to Div. 2. The success continued in 1943 as Drott won Div. 2 in their first year of participation. They then played qualification games against Ystads IF and Pantarholmens SK; Ystads IF won the qualification and were promoted. 1944 saw a change of the league system which was remodeled in football style, creating only four divisions. Drott was placed in Division 2 Södra and were relegated to Div. 3 in 1945 as the club ended up last in the league. The club's first international game was played that year against IF Vidar from Copenhagen.

The growth
In 1946 all parts of the club played in total 47 games and lost 11 of them. The home games were played in a remodeled aircraft hangar at F14, the local air force wing; the games attracted a large number of spectators despite the remoteness of the base. Drott returned to Div. 2 in 1947 after winning Div. 3. They achieved 5th place in 1948 and won an exhibition game against IK Heim from Allsvenskan. In 1949 Hasse Carlsson became the new chairman and after some intensive work both he and the teams in the club were able to establish a long term stable economy. An exhibition game was played against Danish champions IF Ajax which ended in a draw, 14–14.

In 1950 HK Drott made its first trip abroad to Germany and played a tournament there. However, back home the club's playing ground at F14 was closed, but after some intense negotiations the club was able to play its games at the local tennis hall, while the in-between game practice continued at I16. Drott was able to reach 3rd place in Div. 2 that season. In 1951 Drott again traveled abroad to play a new tournament, this time in Germany and Austria. Drott finished 2nd in Div. 2 after losing the series final at home against IFK Karlskrona. Drott yet again traveled abroad to play a friendly tournament, this time in Germany and Denmark, while the club ended up in 5th place in the 1951–52 season. 1952–53 saw a new friendly tournament abroad while none of the club's teams did any good in the league. Following a 2nd place in 1953–54 season the club finished in a relegation place in 1954–55 season, however following objections against an incorrect judgment from the match referee in the last game against Wargo, the club was allowed to remain in Div. 2.

In 1956 a new sports hall was opened, resolving earlier problems with where the home matches were supposed to be played. Drott achieved a 3rd place in Div. 2 the same season. In 1956–57 both the senior and youth teams traveled to Berlin and Germany to play a friendly tournament, the club then ended up in 4th place in the league. In 1957–58 Drott were able to defeat the Dutch national handball team during a tournament in Germany and the Netherlands. Five of the team's players participated in the South Swedish Team playing an annual New Year's tournament in Berlin. The club ended up in 6th position in Div. 2. 1958–59 saw new friendly tournaments abroad, the seniors visiting Berlin again, while the youth team played matches in Paris and Amsterdam. Drott ended up in 2nd place behind LUGI HF, only losing 4 matches in the season. Drott ended up 2nd again in 1959–60, while Vikingarnas IF completely dominated the league. Drott ended up 2nd in the 1960–61 season, this time behind Ystads IF.

Success
The 1961–62 became a very successful year for the club; it was for the second time able to win Div. 2 and then win the qualification to Allsvenskan against IF Hallby, IF Start and Lundens BK. The team's first season in Allsvenskan in 1962–63 was plagued by the loss of several players, however the club were able to achieve a 7th place. The club arranged two World Men's Handball Championship games, Japan against Spain and West Germany against Romania. After having the chance to remaining in Allsvenskan Drott was eventually relegated back down to Div. 2 in the 1963–64 season. The youth team won the NILOC tournament in Amsterdam and the club left the Allsvenska serieföreningen after a disagreement between the club and the organization. Following a generational change in 1964–65 the club finished in 5th place in Div. 2, the supporters failed the club, as only about 600 people came to see each home game, compared to over 1,300 the previous year.

The supporters however returned strongly in 1965–66, with about 1,000 per game, and a new attendance record was set against local rivals HBP with 2,831 spectators. After wins against their top competitors and losses against teams in the middle of the league, the club gained a 3rd place. In the 1966–67 season duels with local competitor HBP for the 1st place spot, Drott just failed on inferior goal difference after both teams ended up on 30 points by the season's end. HK Drott won the 1967–68 season 9 points ahead of IF Hallby after the league system had been remodeled yet again and again return to Allsvenskan. Drott was able to reach the final in Svenska Cupen; they were however then defeated by SoIK Hellas. HK Drott won Allsvenskan in 1968–69 ahead of Hellas, the team however then lost the new playoffs against Hellas who in turn became Swedish champions.

The 1970–71 season started with friendly games in Iceland, including a game against Iceland's national team. After a poor performance at home Drott ended up in 5th place, just 1 point away from the playoffs.

The club reached a 3rd place in Allsvenskan in the 1971–72 season, however Hellas turned out to be too strong yet again in the playoffs, but not until a third decisive game had been played. Drott became runners-up in the 1972–73 season Allsvenska and were yet again defeated in the playoff semifinals by Hellas; the club lost only 4 of 18 matches in the league. Drott ended up in 6th place in the 1973–74 season, with Bengt Hansson becoming the league's top goal scorer.

The 1974–75 season started badly for Drott, with Bengt Johansson as playing head coach, following injury to last season's top goal-scorer Bengt Hansson; the club found itself second from last by the end of the year with only five points, however after a strong spring the club was able to gain a playoff position in the final game of the league.

Achieving a draw in the first match they were able to win the second by 14–12, becoming Swedish champions for the first time ever; the final match was played in front of a sold out stand. Drotts attempt to follow up the previous season's success in 1975–76 with Karl-Erik Einerth as head coach, resulted in a complete failure due to injuries on key players. Drott conceded only 310 goals with only Hellas conceding fewer, however the club also scored the fewest goals and ended second from last.
