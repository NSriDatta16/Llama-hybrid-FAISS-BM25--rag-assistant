Whitford is a rural town to the south-east of Auckland, New Zealand, located on the Pōhutukawa Coast. The area is a part of the rohe of Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki, who settled around the Turanga Creek area. Whitford developed into a rural township in the 19th Century, known for its ostriches, thoroughbred horses, and quarry.

Geography

Whitford is located at the mouth of the Turanga Creek, an estuarial arm of the Hauraki Gulf. It is 20 kilometres south-east of the Auckland City Centre.

Etymology

Until 1882, the area was called Turanga by European settlers. There are multiple versions of where the name Whitford came from. It may be named after Richard Whitford, a man who operated a flax mill on the Waikopua near Housons Creek and was the postman. Others think Whitford referred to the White-ford over the Turanga Creek at the end of Sandstone Road, where the salt dries when the tide is out. Another possibility is that it is named after Whitefoord Park part of a vast property belonging to L.D. Nathan was initially listed as 'Whitefoord Park' in Wises Post Office Directory for 1875–1876, but by the time it went on sale for subdivision in 1903 it was known as Whitford Park.

History

The Pōhutukawa Coast was visited by the Tainui migratory waka around the year 1300. The waka landed at Tūranga Creek, tethered to a volcanic rock in the shape of a man. This gave rise to the name of the creek, which means "Anchorage". Tainui followers of Manawatere, who identified as Ngā Oho, decided to settle the area between the Pōhutukawa Coast and Tūwakamana (Cockle Bay). Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki, the mana whenua of the area, descend from these early settlers. Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki traditional stories talk about the land already being occupied by the supernatural Tūrehu people, and many place names in the area reference Tūrehu figures, such as Hinerangi and Manawatere. Tūranga became the name of the hill overlooking the west bank of the estuary, and the name was applied to the pā and kāinga of the estuary.

The Tūranga Creek area was known as a traditional food source for eels (tuna), lampreys (kanakana), flounder (pātiki) and kererū. There were multiple pā and kāinga sites in the area, including Moananui, Mangemangeroa and Awakarihi (above the Whitford quarry). When William Thomas Fairburn visited the area in 1833, it was mostly unoccupied due to the events of the Musket Wars, as most members of Ngāi Tai had fled to temporary refuge in the Waikato. In 1836, Fairburn purchased 40,000 acres between Ōtāhuhu and Umupuia (Duders Beach), including much of the catchment of the Wairoa River. Fairburn's Purchase was investigated by the New Zealand Land Commission in 1841 and 1842 and found to be excessive and reduced in size. The disallowed parts of his purchase were not returned to Ngāi Tai, however in 1854 a reserve was created for Ngāi Tai around Umupuia.

Whitford's first European settlers, George and William Trice, arrived from Kent in England in 1841. They started a popular and productive farm on Clifton Road near the village settlement in 1843, primarily growing potatoes and employing local members of Ngāi Tai. Over time, the farm grew to 1,000 acres. The family established an unproductive gold mine, which later became the Whitford Quarry and was used as a landfill. The Trice family were followed by more settlers in the mid-1850s, including Isaac and Eve Wade from Wells, Somerset. The first wooden bridge across the Mangemangeroa Creek to the west was constructed in the 1860s, better connecting the community to Auckland by road. Despite the bridge, transport to the community usually occurred via water until the 1920s, when roads and motor transport were improved.

In September 1863 during the Invasion of the Waikato, the Ngāi Tai village of Ōtau near Clevedon was attacked by the British army, and the village was evacuated, living in communities at the river's mouth. For the remainder of the war, Ngāi Tai were designated as a "friendly" people by the Crown, and remained neutral in the fighting. After the Native Lands Act of 1865, the Native Land Court confiscated many Ngāi Tai lands. The remaining land was individuated, slowly sold on to European farmers.

Farming community

In 1869, L.D. and N.A. Nathan took over Alexander Kennedy's farm and developed an ostrich farm, which provided meat and feathers for the fashion trade from 1869 until the 1920s. Racehorses were trained in Whitford, and in the 1890s the Nathan family equestrian track held large-scale racing events, which people from Auckland attended by ferry. The farming community primarily grew oats, hay, wheat, potatoes for the Auckland market. The town's Granger's brickworks operated from the 1878 until 1920, and in 1900 the Nathan family established a butter factory.

In 1910 the Nathan family subdivided their farm into 21 farms and farmlets, which grew the Whitford community. Whitford Hall was built in 1912, and from 1929 to 1934 during the Great Depression, the town hosted unemployment camps, where people could work at the Whitford Quarry. During World War II, home guard troops dug trenches in the Turanga Creek, and built tank traps around Whitford. In 1957, the Whitford Domain was opened as a sports ground and war memorial.

By the early 2000s, Whitford had developed into a service centre for the surrounding rural area, and as a commuter suburb for city workers. Due to urban growth in surrounding areas like Beachlands and Ormiston, the Whitford village area has seen a substantial increase in traffic flow.
