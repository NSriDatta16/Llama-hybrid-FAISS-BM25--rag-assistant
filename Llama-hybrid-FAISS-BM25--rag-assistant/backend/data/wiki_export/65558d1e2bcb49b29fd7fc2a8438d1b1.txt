Business

Which Wich is known for its ordering system, in which customers use red Sharpie markers to mark up pre-printed menus on sandwich bags. They select a sandwich from 10 categories, then choose the bread, cheese, spreads, and toppings. There are other extra options such as double meat, double cheese, bacon, and avocado. The menus have a wide variety of options which besides the aforementioned extras are all free.  The sandwiches are then prepared, and delivered in the personalized sandwich bags. Guests are encouraged to draw on their bags and hang their "artwork" on the community wall.

Which Wich sells customizable submarine sandwiches it calls "Wiches". There are ten categories and 60 topping options. Sandwiches come in regular (7-inch), large (10.5-inch), super (14-inch), spinach wraps, and lettucewiches sizes.
