The 2006 Bound for Glory was a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, which took place on October 22, 2006, from the Compuware Sports Arena in the Detroit suburb of Plymouth Township, Michigan. It was the second event under the Bound for Glory chronology. 

Eight matches were featured on the event's card. In the main event, Sting defeated Jeff Jarrett for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in a Title vs. Career match. In other prominent matches, Samoa Joe defeated Abyss, Brother Runt and Raven in a Monster's Ball match, Chris Sabin defeated Senshi to become the new Impact X Division Champion, Christian Cage defeated Rhino in an 8 Mile Street Fight, and in the opening contest Austin Starr won a Gauntlet Battle Royal by last eliminating Jay Lethal to become the #1 contender to the X Division Championship. 

Bound for Glory was the first TNA pay-per-view event held in a location other than Nashville, Tennessee, or Orlando, Florida, since the first two weekly pay-per-views in June 2002, which were held in Huntsville, Alabama. The Compuware Sports Arena was also the site of the first TNA house show. This was the first pay-per-view to feature a half-hour "Road to" preview airing the night before. This continued for future pay-per-views. This was the first and only time that all of TNA's active championships at the time changed hands in one night.

In October 2017, with the launch of the Global Wrestling Network, the event became available to stream on demand.
