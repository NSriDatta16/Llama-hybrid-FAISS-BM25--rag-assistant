Conservation

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Department of Natural and Environmental Resources, and the American Association of Zoos and Aquariums have worked together to create a captive breeding program run by the American Association of Zoos and Aquariums. In 2013, the group released 71,000 tadpoles and 520 toadlets across three locations. The group has released 260,000 tadpoles over the last twenty years.
 
In 2019, another 8,000 tadpoles were sent to Puerto Rico from the Detroit Zoological Society.

In November 2019 the first Puerto Rican crested toad was born as a result of in vitro.
