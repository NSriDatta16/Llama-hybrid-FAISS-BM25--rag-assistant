Klotz is a family of violin makers. Members of the Klotz (or Kloz) family have made violins in Mittenwald, Bavaria from the mid-17th century to the present. Matthias Klotz (1656–1743) founded the Mittenwald school of violin making. Mittenwald prospered and became well known for its violins. 

In 1856, the Bavarian government founded a school in Mittenwald to continue the violin trade. Dictionaries of violin makers list more than 25 artisans by this name.
