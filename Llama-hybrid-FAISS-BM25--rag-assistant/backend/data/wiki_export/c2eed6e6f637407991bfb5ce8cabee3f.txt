From 27 March to 1 April, she escorted merchant ships to Guadalcanal and then sailed the following day to Efate as escort for the ammunition ship .  Arriving on 4 April, she steamed next day to Espiritu Santo to escort a merchant tanker to Guadalcanal.

PC-1136 reached Guadalcanal on 8 April, and for almost two months she continued intermittent convoy escort and ASW patrol duties out of the Solomons to New Caledonia and the New Hebrides. Departing in convoy on 31 May, she arrived at Kwajalein, Marshall Islands on 6 June to prepare for the invasion of Guam. Assigned to Task Group 58.1, she sailed on the 9 June, arriving east of the Marianas on 22 June.  After patrolling east of Saipan, she returned to Kwajalein on 5 July.  Between 15 and 21 July she steamed to Guam, where she served as amphibious control ship during the landings.  After screening offshore transports during the next week, she departed for the Marshalls on 28 July and arrived at Eniwetok on 3 August.  Between 5 and 13 August, she sailed to Saipan as a convoy escort.  For almost seven months she operated between the Marshals and the Marianas, escorting merchant ships and searching for enemy submarines.  She departed Guam on 3 March 1945, touched at Eniwetok and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 18 March.

After overhaul and conversion to a control ship, PC-1136 sailed for the Western Pacific on 21 May.  Escorting a convoy of LSTs, she reached Guam on 9 June and resumed convoy escort duties in the Marianas.

PCC-1136 departed Manila for the Marianas on 17 October and arrived at Guam on the 22nd.  On 1 November, executive officer Lt. Elden L. Beebe was reassigned as captain. For more than six months, she operated out of Guam, steaming to Saipan, Rota, Marianas, and Ulithi. She sailed for the United States on 1 May 1946 via Eniwetok and Pearl Harbor, arriving at Astoria, Oregon, on 29 May.

PCC-1136 decommissioned on 28 July 1946 and entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet. While berthed in the Columbia River, she was reclassified back to PC-1136 (Submarine chaser) on 27 October 1955.
