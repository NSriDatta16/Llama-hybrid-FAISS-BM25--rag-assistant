The Ethel M Chocolate Factory is a chocolate factory in Henderson, Nevada, founded by Forrest Mars Sr. It produces gourmet chocolate for all of the Ethel M and Ethel's brand chocolates. The factory was named after the mother of Forrest Mars Sr. and is owned by Mars, Incorporated.

History

Forrest Mars Sr. joined the family business Mars in 1929 and retired in 1969. After a short time of retirement, he created Ethel M Chocolates in 1978, which opened in 1980. The reasons for the foundation are assumed to be wanting to cure the boredom he experienced after retiring and to honor his mother, using chocolate recipes she had created. According to researcher J.G. Brenner, "Forrest established the venture in Nevada because it is one of the few states that allowed the sale of liqueur-filled cordials."

He started Ethel M with two of his past associates, Alan Thomas, as general manager, and Dean Musser, as CFO. Mars commissioned engineer Stephen H. Edelblute to design and build the factory, former candy factory owner Fred Dent to assist in developing his chocolates and Karen Grover, a recent research assistant.

Within a few years of its opening "the company had reached annual sales of $150 million, from seventy Ethel M stores throughout the West."

In 2007, Ethel M's introduced a new line of 48 different handmade-gourmet chocolates designed by master chocolatier Jin Caldwell.

In late 2007 the company responded to public demand for the classic line of chocolates by re-releasing six varieties of chocolates in their retail stores in the Las Vegas area.
