Playing career
Geyer started his career in 1997 for the Western Reds in the Super League competition where his older brother Mark was captain. Upon the club's dissolution at the end of 1997 he became one of the foundation members of the Melbourne Storm when they started their first season in 1998. Since then, Geyer has become the most capped Melbourne Storm player, also holding the record for most tries for the club. Most of his career has been played at , but he has also played a large utility role at the club, including  and . While with the Storm he played for the Norths Devils in the 1998 Queensland Cup.

He became the first Storm player to lead the NRL's point-scoring for the season (1999). That season he also played in all three State of Origin matches for New South Wales, scoring two tries.

Geyer played at five-eighth in the 1999 NRL Grand Final and kicked the winning conversion to earn the Storm a premiership in only their second year in the NRL competition (in which he was the leading pointscorer for the season). He replaced Craig Smith, who had been knocked out (resulting in the Storm being awarded a penalty try). Geyer became the Storm's first player to make 200 appearances, against the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks at Melbourne's Olympic Park in 2006. That season he was only remaining player from the 1999 grand final squad to also be a part of the Storm's 2006 NRL Grand Final loss to the Broncos. In 2007 Melbourne again reached the grand final and won against the Sea Eagles but the premiership was later stripped for major breaches of the salary cap.

During the 2008 season, Geyer had been playing off the interchange bench as he had for the 2007 finals series. After Will Chambers' season-ending injury, Geyer took up his centre position for the remainder of the season. On 14 July 2008 he became the first Melbourne Storm player to play 250 games. He played in the 2008 NRL Grand Final defeat by Manly and retired at conclusion of the 2008 season. He left Melbourne as the club's all-time top try scorer.

In July 2009, Geyer revealed that he had made himself available for the Gold Coast Titans in the National Rugby League. However he ended up retiring in Queensland after playing in the Queensland Cup for the Norths Devils.

Geyer's success as a coach continued into the 2018 season with the U17's playing group boasting the only U17's in the Gold Coast competition to field teams in every division and as well as being 2018 Premiers of all divisions. Geyer's U19's senior squad tasted success also, being crowned premiers and being the first Currumbin Eagles senior team to win a grand final in 2018 and then going back-to-back taking out the U20 Premiership again in 2019.
