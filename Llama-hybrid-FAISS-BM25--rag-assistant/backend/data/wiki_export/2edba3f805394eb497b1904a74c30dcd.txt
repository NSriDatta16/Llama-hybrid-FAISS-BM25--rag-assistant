The Celtic Football Club, commonly called the Jersey City Celtics, was an American soccer club based in Jersey City, New Jersey. The club was organized in the summer of 1921 to be an inaugural member of the professional American Soccer League. The club folded after five games.

History
The owners of Celtics put over $6,000 into establishing their team which played in a baseball stadium.  In July 1921, they played Third Lanark in preparation for the upcoming season.  After losing its first five games, the ownership withdrew the team from the league, dissolved it, and forfeited its franchise in early December. Like a number of the ASL teams that season the Celtics lost considerable money. The system was for home teams to get the gate receipts instead of a percent to both teams. Since the Celtics were not able to use their home ground well into late October they played all their ASL games away.
