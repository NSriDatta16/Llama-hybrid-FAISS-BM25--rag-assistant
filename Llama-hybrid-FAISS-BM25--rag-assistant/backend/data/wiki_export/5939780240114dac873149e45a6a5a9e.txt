Orangeville Rise is the second largest spring in the U.S. state of Indiana, in Orange County near Orangeville. It was designated a National Natural Landmark in June 1972.  It is owned and managed by The Nature Conservancy and the Indiana Karst Conservancy.

Geology
Contrary to popular belief, the spring is not a rise of the Lost River which surfaces approximately  south of Orangeville.  Water emerging at Orangeville Rise comes from approximately  of the highly karstified Mitchell Plain to the northeast.  The spring fluctuates wildly in response to drought and rain events, with storm discharge appearing less than 24 hours following an event.
