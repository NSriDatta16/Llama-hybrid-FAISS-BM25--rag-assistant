History 
VUSN has opened since 1908, and was one of the first five schools to receive Rockefeller funding to implement the Goldmark Report of 1923. The school began offering the Masters of Science in Nursing (MSN) in 1955. It was one of the first to launch a pre-specialty program in 1986, which allows students who hold non-nursing degrees to enter the MSN program without repeating undergraduate classes. Vanderbilt's Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree, first conferred in 1935, was restructured into the pre-specialty program as one of several entry options.

In 1993, VUSN established a PhD in Nursing Science program. The Doctor of Nursing Practice program began in August 2008, which had an inaugural class of thirty-one students who graduated in 2010.

Education 
The school became exclusively a graduate school in 1989, with a mission of educating advanced level nurses. It has established MSN programs in numerous advanced specialty practice nursing areas. The school has multiple entry options for nurses and non-nurses, admitting students from educational backgrounds other than nursing and allowing them to complete a course of work leading to an advanced practice nursing degree. The school also offers a Ph.D. in Nursing Science—clinical research or health services research—and a Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP).
