Galeb () was an 8-bit computer developed by the PEL Varaždin company in Yugoslavia in the early 1980s. A grand total of 250 were produced by the end of the summer of 1984, before being replaced with the Orao.

Galeb was designed by Miroslav Kocjan and inspired by Compukit UK101, Ohio Scientific Superboard and Superboard II computers. These machines appeared in the UK and USA in 1979 and were less expensive than Apple II, Commodore PET and/or TRS-80 computers. Galeb's codename YU 101 was chosen to resemble Compukit's UK101.

Galeb was very similar to computers that inspired it:
