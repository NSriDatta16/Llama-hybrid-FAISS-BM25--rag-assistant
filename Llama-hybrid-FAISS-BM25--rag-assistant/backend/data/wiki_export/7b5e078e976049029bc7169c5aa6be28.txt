2020–present: Genius Guild and Build the Damn Thing 
On the heels of the events of the Summer of 2020, Kathryn created Genius Guild, a $20 million dollar venture fund & studio that invests in Black entrepreneurs building scalable businesses that serve Black communities and beyond. Pre-launch, Kathryn and Genius Guild raised over $5MM from a number of partners including Pivotal Ventures, an investment and incubation company founded by Melinda French Gates; Impact Seat, an investment company led by serial investor Barbara Clarke; First Close partners, led by former Surgeon General Regina Benjamin and Lowenstein Sadler partner Ed Zimmerman; and individual investors such as Andrew Bosworth (Facebook/Meta).

Genius Guild’s Greenhouse Fund invests in companies created by Black founders that serve Black communities and have the ability to scale globally. Greenhouse invests into three main areas: Restructuring the flow of capital in Black communities, building healthy environments, and fostering connectivity and belonging. Some of the fund’s notable investments include the digital health platform Health in Her Hue and Quirkchat, a video social network for anime and geek fandom communities.

In 2022, Finney released her second book, Build the Damn Thing, a guide for under-resourced founders on starting a successful business. Shortly after its release, it became a Wall Street Journal bestseller, and received positive reviews from Forbes, Porchlight, and Library Journal.

The Doonie Fund 
In April 2020, Kathryn founded The Doonie Fund, which is named after her grandmother, with a $10,000 personal donation to support Black women entrepreneurs during the COVID-19 crisis. Since 2020, The Doonie Fund has provided micro-investments to Black women-owned businesses. Recipients of the Doonie Fund include snack company Partake and digital media platform The Plug.

The following year, the conference partnered with Google, American Express, and (for a second year) Andreessen Horowitz and Ogilvy. In 2014, its third and final year, American Express returned as a sponsor along with Facebook, Mobile Future, and the Portland Development Commission. At the close of the final FOCUS 100 conference in 2014, Finney announced the expansion of its FOCUS Fellows program into an incubator for Black women-led startups under the DID organizational umbrella.

Having collected proprietary data showcasing the state of Black & Latinx women startup founders across the United States, Finney released the pioneering research #ProjectDiane.

BIG is a winner of the U.S. Small Business Administration’s 2015–2016 Growth Accelerator Fund Competition. In 2018, BIG hosted its fourth Demo Day for its fourth cohort of women of color founders.
