In January 2016, Sammie released his retail mixtape, Indigo via his own imprint StarCamp Music. His third album, Coming of Age was released in September 2017. His fourth album Everlasting was released in March 2019. In June 2019, Sammie embarked on “The Everlasting Tour” performing in intimate settings, giving his fans an up close experience.

In June of 2022, Sammie participated in the musical web series Verzuz, where he shared the stage with his teammate Pleasure P, and opponents Bobby V and Ray J. Their performances went viral over social media after a string of mishaps on stage, but Sammie was favored by viewers who deemed him a 'winner' out of all the participants in their match. This led him to go on a series of boasts on Instagram, where he was challenged by his teammate and opponents. This then led to many live streaming chats where the men discussed their flaws and success and eventually led to an idea to develop and form a supergroup named R.S.V.P. The group currently is in production stages and is working on releasing on EP later this year.

On January 12, 2023, Sammie's mother, Angila Baxter was charged with murder for the shooting death of Nekaybaw Collier in Orange County, Florida.
