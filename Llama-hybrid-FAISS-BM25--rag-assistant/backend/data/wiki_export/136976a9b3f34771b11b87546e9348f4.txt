Managerial career

Chelmsford City
After finishing his career as a player, Rowe took a coaching job in Hungary although this was halted due to the outbreak of World War II. He returned to Britain and joined the military as a physical training instructor. He joined Chelmsford City, as secretary-manager, in 1945 and made the club into a leading non-league team.

Tottenham Hotspur
Tottenham Hotspur were in the second division when Rowe returned to the club as manager in 1949 and his task was to gain promotion. This was achieved by becoming Champions and the following season the First Division Championship was won as well. These back-to-back championships made Spurs the first post-war team to win back-to-back titles. This was achieved through the use of 'Push and run' football.

Rowe was forced to resign as Tottenham manager in 1955 due to health issues.

Crystal Palace
After leaving Tottenham, Rowe took time off to recover and joined Crystal Palace in November 1958 as an assistant to George Smith. He was promoted to manager when Smith resigned in April 1960 bringing the club a promotion to Division Three in the 1960–61 season. The club consolidated its position in Division Three in 1961–62, but a poor start to the next season coincided with failing health for Rowe and he resigned in December 1962 to be replaced by assistant manager Dick Graham. Rowe returned to assist Graham in the 1963–64 season (when Palace was promoted to Division Two) and when Graham was dismissed by Palace in 1966, Rowe was appointed caretaker-manager. After Bert Head was appointed as manager later in 1966, Rowe continued with Palace in a scouting capacity. He subsequently managed the Hall of Fame in London and also assisted Leyton Orient briefly in 1972.

Rowe died on 5 November 1993 in Wallington, aged 87.
