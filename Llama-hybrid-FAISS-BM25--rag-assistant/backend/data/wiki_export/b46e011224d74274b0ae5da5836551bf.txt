New Luce () is a civil parish in Dumfries and Galloway, south-west Scotland. It lies in the traditional county of Wigtownshire, and is about  in length and  in breath, being the upper part of the original Glenluce Parish. New Luce is shown as a civil parish on John Ainslie's county map of 1782.

New Luce is also the principal village within the parish. The coast to coast walk, the Southern Upland Way, passes close to the village. The Covenanter Alexander Peden spent time preaching in the village.

Places of interest
A viaduct carried the Stranraer-Glasgow railway over the Main Water of Luce. Down the river from the viaduct is a pool called Bloody Wheel where the Hays of Castle of Park, near Glenluce (Old Luce), and the Linns of Larg in the adjoining parish of Inch, were said to have had a violent encounter centuries ago.

Archaeology
The Caves of Kilhern, between 2,000 and 3,000 years old, are in south New Luce.

Cairn na Gath ("cairn of the wild cat"), near Balmurrie, is a chambered long cairn dating to the neolithic (later stone-age).  At the south end there are remains of huts or enclosures. In addition, there are ancient hut circles at Lagafater, around 8 miles to the north of New Luce.

Cairn Macneilie,  north-west of Cruise, New Luce, is a Bronze Age round cairn,  in diameter and  high.  There is another Cairn Macneilie at Inch Parks, by Lochinch Castle in Inch Parish.  They may have been named after a person who conducted archaeological excavations.
