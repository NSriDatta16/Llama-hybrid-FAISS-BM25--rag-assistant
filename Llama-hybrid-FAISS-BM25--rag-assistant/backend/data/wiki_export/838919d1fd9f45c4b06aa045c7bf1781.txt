Sande is a municipality in the district of Friesland, Lower Saxony, Germany. It is situated near the Jade Bight, approximately  west of Wilhelmshaven, and  southeast of Jever.

Sande is on the railway which links Oldenburg to Wilhelmshaven and Esens. A bypass is planned so that rail traffic for the JadeWeserPort will not pass through the centre of Sande.
