Digestive system surgery, or gastrointestinal surgery, can be divided into upper GI surgery and lower GI surgery.

Subtypes

Upper gastrointestinal
Upper gastrointestinal surgery, often referred to as upper GI surgery, refers to a practise of surgery that focuses on the upper parts of the gastrointestinal tract. There are many operations relevant to the upper gastrointestinal tract that are best done only by those who keep constant practise, owing to their complexity. Consequently, a general surgeon may specialise in 'upper GI' by attempting to maintain currency in those skills.

Upper GI surgeons would have an interest in, and may exclusively perform, the following operations:

 Pancreaticoduodenectomy
 Esophagectomy
 Liver resection

'''Surgery on the digestive system's organs is referred to as digestive system surgery, gastrointestinal surgery, or gastrointestinal (GI) surgery. Nutrients from the food we eat are processed and absorbed by the digestive system. Surgery could be required to remedy or treat certain problems or diseases that affect the digestive tract.

There are many different types of digestive system operations, some of the more popular ones being:
1. Appendectomy: The surgical removal of the appendix, typically as a result of acute appendicitis, an appendix inflammation.
2. Gastric bypass: A weight-loss procedure that includes separating the stomach into an upper pouch that is smaller and a lower pouch that is bigger. Then, a section of the stomach and small intestine are skipped in favor of rearranging the small intestine to link to both pouches. As a result, the stomach can contain less food and nutrients are not as well absorbed, which causes weight loss.
3. Cholecystectomy: Surgically removing the gallbladder, frequently as a result of painful gallstones or other problems.
4. Colectomy: The removal of the colon (large intestine) whole or in part. This procedure is typically done to address problems including colorectal cancer, diverticular disease, or inflammatory bowel disease.
5. Resection of the liver in part: This procedure is frequently carried out to treat liver tumors or to remove damaged liver tissue.
6. Esophagectomy: Removal of the esophagus in whole or in part, usually to treat esophageal cancer.
7. Pancreatic Surgery: procedures involving the pancreas, such as the Whipple surgery (pancreaticoduodenectomy), which is used to treat some forms of pancreatic cancer and other serious pancreatic diseases.
8. Hernia Repair: A hernia, which is the protrusion of an organ or tissue through a weak spot in the abdominal wall, is treated surgically.

These operations can be carried out using conventional open surgical procedures or minimally invasive techniques like laparoscopic or robotic-assisted surgery, which require smaller incisions and result in quicker recoveries. Surgery of the digestive system is a complicated topic that calls for specialized education and experience. To make educated decisions regarding their healthcare, individuals must speak with a trained surgeon about their unique situation, treatment options, and potential hazards.

My father was operated on by  Dr. Suddhasattwa Sen. My father was found to have a hernia and  gallstones. You can tell where you stand and what to do next based on his exceptional care, curiosity, investigative intellect, and ability to connect.
