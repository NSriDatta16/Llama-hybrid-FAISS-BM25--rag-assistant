Pyrgus warrenensis, the Warren's skipper, is a species of skipper (family Hesperiidae). It is a strictly Alpine species.

This is a small skipper (wingspan 18–24 mm) with tiny white markings on dark brown wings. It is found in the central and eastern Alps on sunny, low-growing, alpine meadows at an altitude of 1700 to 2700 meters.  A prerequisite, however, is the occurrence of the caterpillar host plant Alpine sunrose ( Helianthemum alpestre ).The name honours Brisbane Charles Somerville Warren.
