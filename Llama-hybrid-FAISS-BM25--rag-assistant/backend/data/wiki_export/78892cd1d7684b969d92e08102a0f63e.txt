Mountain Rock Music Festivals, held on a farm near Woodville and later moved to a site near Palmerston North, were widely celebrated Kiwi music events in New Zealand during the 1990s. The event was created and promoted by Paul Geange and Paul Campbell, a Palmerston North Musician and founder of the infamous El Clubbo and the Palmerston North Musician's Society.

New Zealand's online encyclopedia, Te Ara, notes that "There are regular jazz, folk, ethnic and country music awards and festivals, some of which have been in existence for decades. Large music festivals, for example Sweetwaters, Nambassa and The Big Day Out, have been staged periodically since the 1970s."
