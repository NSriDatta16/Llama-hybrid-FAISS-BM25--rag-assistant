History 
Kappa Psi Kappa was founded by five men in Tallahassee, FL on the campus of Florida State University. They were known as the Illustrious Elite. In the summer of 2001, these men set out and started to organize the foundation of the fraternity based upon promoting brotherhood, scholarship, service and leadership. The fraternity was incorporated under the Articles of Corporation in the State of Florida on October 3, 2001.

Symbols and traditions 
The heraldic crest of Kappa Psi Kappa contains ten symbolic elements, each of which carries a special meaning to the Fraternity. The fraternity's mascot is the White Bengal Tiger, representing the rarity, beauty, and strength of a man of Kappa Psi Kappa. The fraternity's colors are Baby Blue, Gold, New Black.The formal motto of the fraternity is "One Brotherhood, One Bond."

The highest honor bestowed by Kappa Psi Kappa Fraternity is the status of Constellation member.  A Constellation is a member who is recognized by the Fraternity as being a leading figure, mentor, who has demonstrated exemplary service to both Brotherhood and Community.

Membership 
Membership into the Kappa Psi Kappa Brotherhood is open to any man over the age of 18 who has obtained his high school diploma or GED.  Current enrollment in an institute of higher learning is not a requirement for membership.

Because Kappa Psi Kappa is a Service-Social organization, community service is not only a requirement to maintain active status membership within the Fraternity, it is also a requirement to apply for membership.

Kappa Psi Kappa has intake classes twice  per year, in the spring, and fall.  Once a Pledge has successfully completed the Membership Intake class or Line and meets all required prerequisites for membership, full membership into the Brotherhood is conferred.

Kappa Psi Kappa has implemented a strict ban on hazing activities.

Chapters and Colonies 

Kappa Psi Kappa chapters are assigned a sequential Greek letter designation according to the order in which they were chartered. The oldest is the Alpha Chapter, located in Tallahassee, FL. Subsequent chapters were assigned successive letters of the Greek alphabet. After all single-letter designations were used, chapters were assigned double-letter combinations in the fashion "Alpha Alpha," "Alpha Beta," "Alpha Gamma," etc. The designation "Alpha Omega Kappa" is reserved as a symbolic "Chapter Eternal" for all Eternal Diamonds, members who have died.

Kappa Psi Kappa chapters and colonies are metropolitan based, serving the cities in which the charter member lives and then extending for a two-hour radius.
