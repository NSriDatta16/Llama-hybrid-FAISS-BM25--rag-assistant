Long Walk Home: Music from the Rabbit-Proof Fence, released in June 2002, is the fourth soundtrack album and twelfth album overall by the English rock musician Peter Gabriel. Devised as the soundtrack to the Australian film Rabbit-Proof Fence, it was the first release of new music by Peter Gabriel since OVO, also a soundtrack. The soundtrack contains elements from and references to songs which Peter would release on his album Up. The track "A Sense of Home" samples the drum loops used on "No Way Out". "Running to the Rain", "Crossing the Salt Pan", and "The Return" are reworked arrangements of "Signal to Noise", track nine of Up. "Ngankarrparni" and "Cloudless" are reworked arrangements of track three, "Sky Blue".

Critical reception

Billboard included Long Walk Home in its reviews Spotlights section, deeming it "to deserve special attention on the basis of musical merit and/or Billboard chart potential". Billboard reviewer Bradley Bambarger recommended the album to fans of Gabriel's album Passion—the soundtrack for the film The Last Temptation of Christ—writing, "the intrepid artist's soundtrack to the Australian film Rabbit-Proof Fence should prove nearly as compelling". He described the album as "atmospheric, often ominously so" and as having "a cumulative emotive power" due to its "interwoven motifs".
