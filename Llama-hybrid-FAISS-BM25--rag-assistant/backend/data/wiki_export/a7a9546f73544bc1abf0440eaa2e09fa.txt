Facilities
The Planetarium's 23-meter dome can seat some four hundred spectators viewing projections of the sky from both analogue and digital planetarium projectors. It hosts regular public shows on astronomical topics as well as a variety of other events. In 2011 it hosted the fifth International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics.
	
The Planetarium's sister astronomical observatory is equipped with a 300-mm diameter refracting telescope (the largest refractor in use in Poland) and a number of smaller instruments. On cloudless days, visitors can view live images of the Sun and, after dusk, a range of celestial objects at a magnification of up to 750 times. 

The observatory conducts research on comets and minor planets. The Planetarium has an astronomical library of some 10,000 volumes and, in the courtyard, an impressive sundial. The corridors host astronomy-related exhibits.

The Planetarium's meteorological and seismological stations conduct regular observations and host educational classes.
