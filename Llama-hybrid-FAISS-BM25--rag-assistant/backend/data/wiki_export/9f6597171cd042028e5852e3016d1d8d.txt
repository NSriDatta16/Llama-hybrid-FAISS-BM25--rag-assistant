The University of Michigan Solar Car Team is an engineering project team at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor that designs, builds, and races some of the world's most advanced solar-electric vehicles. Having won the North American Solar Challenge (NASC) nine times (out of a possible twelve), the team is regarded as the most successful in North America. Additionally, the is highly competitive on the global stages having placed third in the World Solar Challenge (WSC) six times, and placing second in 2017 – the best ever achieved by an American collegiate team. Many of the team's 16 vehicles are on display in museums in the United States and abroad.

Composition and history
Founded in 1989 by Bill Kaliardos, an undergraduate student in Aerospace Engineering and Mechanical Engineering, the University of Michigan Solar Car Team is one of the largest and most successful student projects at the university. The inaugural 1990 team, which formed in 1989, was eventually managed by Susan Fancy, with Professor and Dean Gene Smith serving as the team's Faculty Advisor.  Gene Smith was also Advisor for many other U-M Solar Car Teams to follow.  The teams have built eleven solar cars and competed in 15 major races.  Although it draws heavily on undergraduate students from the College of Engineering, students from any academic discipline or year of study are allowed to join the team. Students have also come from the College of LS&A, the Ross School of Business, and the Stamps School of Art & Design.

In 1990, the team's first car, Sunrunner, finished in first place in the inaugural GM Sunrayce USA, and third place overall (first place in Student category) in the 1990 World Solar Challenge in Australia.  Core team members of the 1990 team included Susan Fancy, Paula Finnegan, David Noles, Chetan Maini (Maini went on to become the founder of Reva which is one of the major electric car companies in India), David Bell, Jef Pavlat, Andy Swiecki, Chris Gregory, and many more.

The second generation team built its car, Maize & Blue, and competed in Sunrayce 93 (the predecessor to the North American Solar Challenge) finishing in first place in the national race, and 11th in the World Solar Challenge.

After 1993's races, all projects have run on a 2-year cycle. During those two years, the team is typically anywhere from 50 to 100 students. The vast majority of these students volunteer their time freely, although in the past a small percentage opt to receive credit via the university's Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (or UROP). A race crew of approximately 20 students is selected to race the vehicle in competition.  These students' function is similar to that of a pit crew in professional auto racing.

As of 2016, UM's solar car project has won the North American championship nine times.
