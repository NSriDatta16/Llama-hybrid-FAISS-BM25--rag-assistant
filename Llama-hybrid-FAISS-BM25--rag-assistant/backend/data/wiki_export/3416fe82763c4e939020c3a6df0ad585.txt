The Apostolic Vicariate of Luang Prabang () is a Latin Rite jurisdiction of the Catholic Church in Laos. As an apostolic vicariate, it is a pre-diocesan jurisdiction, entitled to a titular bishop. It is located in northern Laos.

It is exempt, i.e. not part of any ecclesiastical province but directly dependent on the Holy See and its missionary Dicastery for Evangelization.

It currently has no cathedral since its former Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, in Luang Prabang, has been secularized. The vicariate has been vacant since 1975, entrusted to a series of temporary Apostolic administrators.

Statistics 
The vicariate covers 80,425 km² in the northern Laotian civic provinces of Luang Prabang, Xaignabouli, Oudomxai, Phongsali, Louang Namtha and Bokeo.

As of 2014, it pastorally cares for 2,693 Catholics (0.2% of 1,692,000 total) in 8 parishes with one priest and five seminarians.

History 
It was established on March 1, 1963 as Apostolic Vicariate of Luang Prabang with territory split off from the Vicariate Apostolic of Vientiane.

Since the Communist takeover of Laos in 1975 the Catholic Church in the vicariate of Luang Prabang has been strongly suppressed.
