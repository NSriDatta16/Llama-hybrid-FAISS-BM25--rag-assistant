Despite its title, the song is actually 3 minutes 39 seconds. It begins with the sound of what is apparently a ping-pong ball being hit back and forth. Then Mike D raps from about the 0:12 mark to around the 1:12 mark. MCA follows from about 1:14 to 2:00. Finally, Ad-Rock takes over from around 2:09 and continues to 3:07, followed by another half minute of music.

The track contains samples of "Feel Good" by Fancy and "Brave and Strong" by Sly & the Family Stone.

Incidentally, it is one of the few Beastie Boys tracks where each member has a standalone verse.
