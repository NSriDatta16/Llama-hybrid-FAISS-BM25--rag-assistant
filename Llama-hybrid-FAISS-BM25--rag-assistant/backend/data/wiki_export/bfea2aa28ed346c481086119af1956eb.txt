Additionally it is one of very few institutes in the region to teach the Islamic sciences completely in Arabic.

History

Nadwatul Ulama was formed with the aim to bring all the sects of Islam together irrespective of some of their differences in beliefs.

Nadwa means assembly and group, it was named so because it was constituted by a group of Indian Islamic scholars from different theological schools. Darululoom is the educational body of Nadwatul Ulama which was formed in Kanpur in 1893. It was eventually shifted to Lucknow in 1898 and the Islamic curriculum was updated with modern sciences, mathematics, vocational training and the addition of an English Department.

On 2 September 1898, the office of the Nadwatul Ulama was shifted to Lucknow. The Darul Uloom Nadwatul Ulama was started on 26 September 1898.
