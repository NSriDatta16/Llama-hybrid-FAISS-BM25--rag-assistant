Football Club Progrès Niederkorn is a professional football club based in Niederkorn, in south-western Luxembourg.

History
During the German occupation of Luxembourg, the club played in the Gauliga Moselland under the name of FK Niederkorn, where it finished runners-up in 1942–43, behind champions TuS Neuendorf.

Three times domestic league winners, the club's most successful years were at the end of the 1970s and beginning of the 1980s. They haven’t won a major trophy since the 1981 league title.

In the 2005–06 season, Niederkorn finished second in Luxembourg's second division, the Division of Honour. As the top league, the National Division, expanded from twelve teams to fourteen, Niederkorn were promoted along with Differdange 03.

In the 2016–17 Luxembourg National Division, Progrès Niederkorn drew the league's highest attendance that year: 1,820. Their average home attendance was 710.

On 4 July 2017, Progrès beat Scottish side Rangers in the 1st qualifying round of the 2017–18 UEFA Europa League. They overcame a 1–0 defeat at Ibrox with a 2–0 win at the Stade Josy Barthel, having scored only once before in European competition. This victory was also the club's first ever win in European football. They enjoyed an even greater campaign in the 2018–19 UEFA Europa League, defeating FK Gabala and Budapest Honvéd FC to reach the third qualifying round against Russian side FC Ufa. The tie seemed destined for extra-time but a last-minute goal for Ufa sent Progres out, denying them a rematch against Rangers in the play-offs.
