The MaX5 Racing Championship is a UK based one-make sports car series using older specification mark 1 1600cc Mazda MX-5s. It was started in the summer of 2003 by Alyn Robson and Jonathan Halliwell, with the first race season being held in 2004. It was based upon the original MX5 Championship that ran between 1990–91 and the American Spec Miata MX-5 Championship. The championship works on the ethos that close racing is exciting racing, and is aimed at drivers who want to race for fun. This is summed up in the championship's slogan, "Race it to the max." The championship has gained success through its cheap racing entry fees and the popular nature of the Mazda MX5.

Although the main race calendar contains some major British circuits, including Silverstone and Brands Hatch, the championship has also taken in minor circuits such as Lydden Hill and Mallory Park, circuits not often visited by major British car championships.

To race in the series, prospective drivers are required to join the MAX5 racing club for an annual membership fee. The minimum racing licence for entering the championship is a National B ARDS (Advanced Racing Driver Schools) licence.

Drivers can compete in the MaX5 races for a whole season, but an Arrive and Drive package is offered in an attempt to attract new drivers into the championship, costing £750 + VAT per race.

2005
There was a close race for the championship saw Martin Byford winning the Championship from Christian Dick by 2 points at the last meeting of the season. The competition regularly attracted grids of over 20 cars.

The series has been regularly part of one of National motorsport's major packages, Dunlop's Great and British festivals, which featured Radicals, Ginettas and the Mini Cooper challenge, alongside the MaX5 Racing Championship. The first occasion that the Mazdas featured in the package was on the weekend of 27–28 May 2006 on the Welsh circuit of Pembrey, south Wales.
