Critical reception

Rolling Stone reviewer gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, stating: "on his fifth album, Get In Where You Fit In, Short plays his usual blaxploitation character, only he ain't battlin' the man, he's on his way to get some. Between "I'm a Player", "Playboy Short" and "Blow Job Betty", Short sounds like he's getting more than Shaft, Sweet Sweetback and Superfly combined". Dimitri Ehrlich of Entertainment Weekly found that: "In Get In Where You Fit In, Oakland rapper seems to be operating on mental cruise control as he recounts gratuitous tales of life as a player in the streets and bedrooms of his hometown. Producer Ant Banks' antiseptic assemblages lack all the grit of the original recordings from which they were sampled. The result? N.W.A redux meets P-Funk lite". AllMusic reviewer wrote: "Although he tries to cop part of the current P-Funk-inspired gangsta rap, Too Short sounds lost and dated on the overlong, sample-reliant, grotesquely misogynist, and musically muddled Get in Where You Fit In". Veteran critic Robert Christgau gave the album a "neither" rating.
