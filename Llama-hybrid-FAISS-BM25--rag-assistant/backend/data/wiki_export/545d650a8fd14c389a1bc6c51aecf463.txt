Maayan Strauss (, born in 1982 in Jerusalem) is an Israeli artist.

Strauss studied architecture at the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design in Jerusalem. She has exhibited in several galleries and art projects, such as the project "Sharon", that suggests, according to curator Joshua Simon, "an unlikely connection between the most affluent region in Israel, and the name of the Israeli PM."

Maayan Strauss studied at the Yale Photography MFA and graduated in 2012.

Exhibitions & Projects

In 2003 she showed paintings and photographs in Tel Aviv's renowned  Givon Gallery.

In 2005, Strauss was involved in the short film Beautiful Tamar as the narrator.

In 2006, she exhibited a work called "Settlement Evacuation" in the Israel Museum of Jerusalem as part of the "Mini Israel" exhibition that the museum held. Strauss's work was a model of a Jewish settlement being evacuated.
