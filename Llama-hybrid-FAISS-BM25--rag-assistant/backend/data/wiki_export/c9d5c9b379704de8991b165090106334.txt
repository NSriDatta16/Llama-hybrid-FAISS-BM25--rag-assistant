Political career
Beatty is a native of Jefferson, and a graduate of the University of Georgia. He was elected as the first Republican since Reconstruction from Jackson County, Georgia to the Georgia House of Representatives in 1990. While in office he strongly opposed the creation of a state lottery. After legislative redistricting placed Beatty in a district with another incumbent Republican legislator, he decided not to seek re-election in 1992 opting to focus on the small businesses he and his wife owned including a poultry and cattle farm. In the 2000 election cycle, Beatty was drafted by the Senate Republican Caucus to oppose  the incumbent Democrat State Senator. He was elected  State Senator and proved instrumental in the successful battle to ban video poker in Georgia.

In 2002, he opted not to seek re-election to the Senate and declared his candidacy for Lieutenant Governor of Georgia. He finished first  in a three-way Republican primary but failed to gain a majority of the votes, forcing a primary run-off in which he was narrowly defeated.

Commissioner of the Georgia Department of Community Affairs
He was then appointed Commissioner of the Georgia Department of Community Affairs (DCA)  in 2003 by Governor Sonny Perdue, a post which he held until being replaced by Gretchen Corbin on August 1, 2013.
