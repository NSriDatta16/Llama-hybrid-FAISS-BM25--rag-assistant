The European Institute of Oncology (, IEO) is a non-profit private-law comprehensive cancer centre located in Milan, Italy. It is a clinic, a research centre and a training institution. IEO is a member of EU-LIFE, an alliance of leading life science research centres in Europe.

The European Institute of Oncology works on the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancer by developing clinical and scientific research coupled with organisation and management. It provides a professional network for its members.

History
The European Institute of Oncology was conceived by Umberto Veronesi, who developed a new model for health and advanced research in the international oncology field. The institute was inaugurated in May 1994 and is today managed by Division and Unit Directors from eight European countries.

The Institute became a research hospital and treatment centre (IRCCS or ) through the Ministerial Decree issued in January 1996. The European Institute of Oncology provides services through agreements with Italyâ€™s National Health Service. Professor Gordon McVie performs outreach activities on behalf of the IEO. 
 
The Institute integrates various activities involved in the fight against cancer: prevention and diagnosis, health education and training, research and treatment.

At its centre in Via Ripamonti all clinical, research and training activities take place. In 2002 the institute opened IEO CENTRO, an integrated cancer diagnosis centre in downtown Milan.
