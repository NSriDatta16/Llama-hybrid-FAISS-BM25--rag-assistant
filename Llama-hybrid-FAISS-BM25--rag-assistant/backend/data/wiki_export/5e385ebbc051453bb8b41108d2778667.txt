History
The track was built in 1946 as a 1/4 mile dirt track, before being converted to a paved race track during the 1960s, through the early 1990s when the track was abandoned.

The speedway was about to be torn down until the Grosso family purchased it in 1997. Until this point the speedway had steadily deteriorated from bad to worse.

In July 2022, The speedway went under new management.
