Indoor netball is a variation of netball, played exclusively indoors, in which the playing court is surrounded on each side and overhead by a net. The net prevents the ball from leaving the court, reducing the number of playing stoppages. This gives indoor netball a faster pace than netball.

There are two main types of indoor netball, "6-a-side" and "7-a-side". Indoor netball has a larger focus towards mixed-gender matches than netball does, although ladies' games, and to a smaller extent men's games, are ever-present. While the sport does not have as large a following as netball does, its popularity is growing in countries such as England, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. The sport is administered at an international level by the World Indoor Netball Association (WINA)

Overview
The rules of indoor netball are similar to that of netball, with two teams aiming to score as many goals as possible. An indoor netball game usually consists of four-quarters of 10 minutes. There are two umpires one for each half of the court. The winning team is the one with the most points at the end of the match. In case of a tie in elimination games, two straight 5-minute overtimes are played; if still tied, whoever is up two points will win.

6-a-side
In this version the court is divided into halves rather than thirds, and there are six players per team rather than seven. The team is made up of two Center's/Link players, two attack players, and two defence players. The two attack players are located in one half and the two defence in the opposite half to their Attacking side.  Both the Attackers and Defenders are allowed anywhere in their half of the court which includes the Shooting Circles.  The Center/Link players run the full court but are NOT allowed into the Shooting Circles at either end.  Scoring is also different.  Attackers can shoot from inside the Circle, a successful shot gives you 1 point.  Attackers can also shoot from Circle edge or further back-outside of the Circle.  A successful shot from this distance or further scores 2 points (much like 3-pointers in basketball). Because the 2-point line is the Circle edge in the Attackers zone, this allows the Centers/Links to shoot for 2 points from the outside along with Attackers.  Fundamentally, this changes the game play from normal 7-a-side Netball significantly! with the Attack players working to set up the Center/Link players for the 2-point shot.

Once a goal is scored, a defence player from the opposition team takes a throw-off from the top of their circle. This makes the game even faster as the ball doesn't have to be sent back to the centre third for a centre pass like 7-a-side.

7-a-side
This version is a lot like original netball, with the court in divided into thirds and with seven players similarly positioned. Only 1-point shots are possible, and only from inside the shooting circle.
