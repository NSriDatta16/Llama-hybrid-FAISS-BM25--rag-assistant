Florida's 7th congressional district is a congressional district in the north central portion of the U.S. state of Florida.

From 2003 to 2013, the district consisted of the suburban area between Orlando and Daytona Beach and included St. Augustine. The district included all of Flagler and St. Johns Counties; a very small portion of eastern Putnam County; parts of Volusia County, including portions of DeLand, Deltona, Ormond Beach, and Daytona Beach; much of western Seminole County; and a small, predominantly suburban portion of Orange County.

Following court-ordered redistricting in 2015, the district included all of Seminole County and northern Orange County, including much of downtown and northern Orlando and the cities of Maitland and Winter Park. At the time, the district was also home to the University of Central Florida (UCF), the state's largest university by student population in 2020-2021.

Following further redistricting in 2022 based on the 2020 United States census, the 7th district still includes all of Seminole County. It now includes the southern half of Volusia County, while the portion of the district that extended into Orange County, including UCF, is now part of the 10th congressional district.

The district is currently represented in the U.S. Congress by Rep. Cory Mills.
