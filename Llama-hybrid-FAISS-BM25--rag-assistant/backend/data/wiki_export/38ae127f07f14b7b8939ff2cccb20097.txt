The Navistar T444E is a diesel V8 engine manufactured by Navistar International Corporation. In its use in Ford Motor Company trucks, vans, and school buses, it is the first of the Power Stroke family of diesel engines. The T444E was manufactured from 1994 to 2003, replacing the 7.3L IDI V8 designed by International Harvester. As a result of its inability to meet California noise regulations, the T444E was discontinued midway through the 2003 model year, replaced by the all-new 6.0L VT365. In total, nearly 2 million 7.3L Power Stroke V8s were manufactured for Ford at Navistar's Indianapolis, Indiana, plant before switching to the 6.0L.

The T444E used a  bore and stroke. Power output was  at 3000 rpm and  at 1600 rpm for 1994-1997. Power was increased in 1998 to  at 2600 rpm and  of torque at 1600 rpm. In 2000, power was once again upped to  at 2700 rpm with automatic transmission and  with manual transmission, and  of torque at 1600 rpm.
