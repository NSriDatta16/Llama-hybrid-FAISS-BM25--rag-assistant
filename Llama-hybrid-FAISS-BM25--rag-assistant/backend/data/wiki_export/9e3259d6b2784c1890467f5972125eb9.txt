Early life
Jackson was born in Lafayette Township, Allen County, Indiana on May 28, 1895, the son of Reverend Isaiah H. Jackson and Minnie (Whitterberger) Jackson. He attended the public schools of Fort Wayne and graduated from the city's Central High School in 1914. He then attended Indiana Law School (now Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law), from which he received his LL.B. degree in 1917. Later that year, Jackson was admitted to the bar. He delayed the commencement of a law practice in order to enter the military for World War I.

World War I
Jackson enlisted in the United States Army for World War I. He attended the officers' training camp held at Fort Benjamin Harrison and received his commission as a second lieutenant of Infantry in August 1917. He was subsequently assigned to legal duties in the office of the judge advocate at Camp Zachary Taylor, Kentucky. Jackson received promotion to first lieutenant and captain during the war, and was mustered out in April 1919.

Start of career
After leaving the Army, Jackson engaged in the practice of law at Fort Wayne as the head of a firm that eventually became known as Jackson, Longfellow and Jackson. In 1919 and 1920, Allen served as assistant supervisor of the U.S. census for Indiana's 12th Congressional District.

In July 1940, Jackson received an interim appointment as attorney general of Indiana, and he completed the term of the late Omer Stokes Jackson.

Later career

Gates, 50.97 percent to 48.18. After losing the governor's race, Jackson resumed the practice of law in Fort Wayne. In 1946 he was hired for a three-year term as governor of the National Association of Commodity Exchanges and Allied Trades.
