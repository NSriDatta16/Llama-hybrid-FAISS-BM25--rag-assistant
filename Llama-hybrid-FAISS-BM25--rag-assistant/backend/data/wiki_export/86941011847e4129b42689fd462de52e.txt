The Scout and Guide movement in Denmark consists of about ten different associations. Most of them are members of two large federations, but there are also some independent organizations. Affiliated to Danish Scouting and Guiding are the organizations in Greenland, on the Faroe Islands and in Southern Schleswig.

Scouting in Denmark started in 1909. Danish Scouts were among the charter members of the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM), Danish Guides among the founding members of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS).

Girl Guiding in Denmark consists of girls only, while some WAGGGS countries allow boys to be included. De grønne pigespejdere is the only association for girls only - all the other organisations are mixed boys and girls. 'Boy Scout' and 'Girl Guide' are both translated to the Danish 'Spejder'. As of 2003 there were 22090 girls involved in Denmark in Girl Guides.
