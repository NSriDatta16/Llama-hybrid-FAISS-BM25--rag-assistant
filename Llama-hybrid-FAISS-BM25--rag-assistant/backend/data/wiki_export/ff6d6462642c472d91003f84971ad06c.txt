Fleisher Yarn began as an amateur company soccer club of the SB & BW Fleisher Manufacturing Company in Philadelphia and quickly became a national amateur soccer power. They won the Philadelphia Industrial League championship in 1920/21, both the Allied Amateur Cup of Philadelphia and Philadelphia's Telegraph Cup in 1922, a "quadruple" in 1923 winning the Allied Amateur League, the Allied Amateur League Cup, the Allied Amateur Cup, and the American Cup (the last by defeating the professional J&P Coats of the American Soccer League), and the inaugural National Amateur Cup.

Fleisher became a professional team and joined the American Soccer League in 1924. After one mediocre season the club folded.
