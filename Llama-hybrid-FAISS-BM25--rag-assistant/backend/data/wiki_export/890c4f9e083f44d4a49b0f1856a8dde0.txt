Critical reception

James Christopher Monger at AllMusic gave Elements Pt. 2 three stars out of five, describing it as "borrowing liberally" from Helloween's Keeper of the Seven Keys series, and praising the album's "inspired moments" which "succeed with bombast and Queensrÿche-like melodrama." He noted "Alpha & Omega", "Awaken the Giant", "Season's of Faith's Perfection" and "Liberty" as highlights, but remarked that the album "may disappoint some fans with its lack of epics and torch-heavy balladry".
