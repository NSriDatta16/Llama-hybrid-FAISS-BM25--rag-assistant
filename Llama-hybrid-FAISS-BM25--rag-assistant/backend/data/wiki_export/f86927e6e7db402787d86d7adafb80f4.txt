Little Rosey is an animated television series produced by Canada-based Nelvana. The series first aired on ABC (part of its Saturday morning block) in 1990. It was Roseanne Barr's first attempt at a cartoon.

Plot
Loosely based on comedian Roseanne Barr's childhood, the series revolved around a young 8-year-old Rosey and her two best friends Tess and Buddy. The three would use their imaginations to overcome the obstacles they faced, such as spelling bees, family vacations, and rules that their parents forced upon them.

Among the recurring characters were Rosey's parents, her younger sister Nonnie, and her baby brother Tater, and a pair of nemesis science nerds.

Production
In 1990, this animated series aired late in the day on ABC's Saturday morning lineup. Two years later, an animated special called The Rosey and Buddy Show was produced as a primetime special that aired on May 15, 1992, in which Rosey and Buddy invade Cartoonland to take on the meddling executives who wanted to "change their show". In the 1992 special, Barr voiced the character.
