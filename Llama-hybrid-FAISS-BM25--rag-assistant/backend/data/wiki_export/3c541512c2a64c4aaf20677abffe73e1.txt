List of ships of the Peruvian Navy comprising almost every Peruvian warship commissioned after 1840.

Vessels acquired in the 1840s and 1850s

President Castilla sought to expand and well-equip the Peruvian Navy. His naval policy was to if Chile constructed one ship, he should construct two, and he went on to turn the Peruvian Navy into the most powerful of South America. He acquired the frigates "Mercedes", "Guisse", "Gamarra", "Amazonas", and "Apurimac" as well as the Schooners "Tumbes" and "Loa". He also built the naval ports of Paita and Bellavista. Castilla also acquired the first steam-powered warship of any South American country and named it the "Rimac". To better educate the officers of these new ships, he sent them to study with the various navies of European nations. For the defense of the Amazonia, Castilla began to develop an Amazonian fleet with the purchase of the ships, "Morona", "Pastaza", "Napo", and "Putumayo",
