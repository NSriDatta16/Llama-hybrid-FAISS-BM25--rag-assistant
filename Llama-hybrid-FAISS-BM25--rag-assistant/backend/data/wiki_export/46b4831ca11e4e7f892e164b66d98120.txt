"Over My Head (Cable Car)" (originally performed simply as "Cable Car") is a song by American rock band the Fray. It was released in October 2005 as the lead single from their debut album How to Save a Life (2005) and hit the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The single helped propel their album from the Top Heatseekers chart to the top 20 of The Billboard 200 chart. The CD single was backed with "Heaven Forbid" and a live version of "Hundred". In the United Kingdom, "Over My Head (Cable Car)" was released as the second single from the album, following "How to Save a Life".

The song sold over two million digital downloads in the United States and was certified 2Ã— Platinum by the RIAA in May 2006. The song was the fifth most-downloaded single of 2006 and was ranked number 13 on the Hot 100 singles of 2006 by Billboard. It was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals in 2006 but lost to "My Humps" by the Black Eyed Peas.

The song was ranked No. 43 on Billboards Best Adult Pop Songs of the Decade list and No. 100 on Billboards Top 100 Digital Tracks of the Decade list.

After comparisons were drawn between "Over My Head (Cable Car)" and the Chainsmokers' "Closer", Isaac Slade and guitarist Joe King of the Fray were credited as co-writers of "Closer" on September 2, 2016.

Song meaning
The song "Over My Head" was written about lead singer and pianist Isaac Slade's relationship with his brother, Caleb, nicknamed "Cable Car". He wrote the song because he and his brother were allegedly not speaking and were at odds with each other:

"It is about a fight I got in with my brother, Caleb. After he graduated high school, we drifted apart and really hadn't spoken in a long time. One day we both realized that we needed to fight it out. We'd been friends for 20 years. That's a long time when you're only 23 years old. We fought it out, and he's one of my best friends today."

The song was originally recorded as a demo in 2004. This demo version was picked up by Denver radio station KTCL, and became one of the station's most played songs of 2005. There is also another slightly different version of the song which is 4:10 in length.
