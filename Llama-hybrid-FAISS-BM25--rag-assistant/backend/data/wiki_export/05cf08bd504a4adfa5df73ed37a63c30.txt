Larix griffithii, the Sikkim larch, is a species of larch, native to the eastern Himalaya in eastern Nepal, Sikkim, western Bhutan and southwestern China (Xizang, Yunnan), growing at  in altitude.

It is sometimes called the Himalayan larch, not to be confused with Larix potaninii var. himalaica, which is generally known as the 'Langtang larch'.

Description
It is a medium-sized deciduous coniferous tree reaching  tall, with a trunk up to  in diameter. The crown is slender conic; the main branches are level to upswept, the side branchlets pendulous from them. The shoots are dimorphic, with growth divided into long shoots (typically  long) and bearing several buds, and short shoots only  long with only a single bud. The leaves are needle-like, light glaucous green,  long; they turn bright yellow to orange before they fall in the autumn, leaving the pale yellow-brown shoots bare until the next spring.

The cones are erect, ovoid-conic,  long, with 50-100 seed scales, each seed scale with a long exserted and reflexed basal bract; they are dark purple when immature, turning dark brown and opening to release the seeds when mature, 5–7 months after pollination. The old cones commonly remain on the tree for many years, turning dull grey-black.

Taxonomy
It has 2 accepted variants;
 Larix griffithii var. griffithii
 Larix griffithii var. speciosa 

Synonyms of the variants; include Abies griffithiana J. D. Hooker ex Lindley & Gordon and Larix griffithiana hort. ex Carrière. 

Trees to the northeast of the range in eastern Bhutan and Xizang have been separated as Larix kongboensis (Mill 1999); they differ in smaller cones  long. This taxon has been accepted by the Flora of China but not widely elsewhere.
