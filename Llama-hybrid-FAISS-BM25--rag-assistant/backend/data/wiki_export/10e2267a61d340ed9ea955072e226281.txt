Professional career

San Francisco 49ers
The San Francisco 49ers selected Lawson in the first round of the 2006 NFL Draft with the intention that he could bring pressure off the edges as the 49ers defense transitioned from a 4-3 defense to a 3-4. Although Lawson played defensive end in college, the 49ers felt that he had the athletic ability to change position to linebacker. Lawson impressed opposing teams with his athleticism and speed on the field. He showed that he could play linebacker at the next level consistently, making plays from sideline to sideline. He finished the year with 2.5 sacks, one interception, one blocked punt, and 2 fumble recoveries.

Lawson was voted Week 2 Rookie of the Week for his performance against the St. Louis Rams by voters on the NFL website. In the game, he recorded three tackles, two sacks, and two quarterback pressures.

In 2007, he started off the season well. He accrued 11 tackles in the first two contests, both tight victories, over Arizona and St.Louis. He had several good QB pressures but mainly was noted for his excellent coverage play, keeping both teams' tight ends fairly non-existent in the offense and letting the rest of the defense focus on stopping those teams' excellent wide receiver duos. Lawson tore his ACL during a practice preparing for a week 3 games against Pittsburgh, ending his season.

Cincinnati Bengals
On August 2, 2011, Lawson signed a one-year contract with the Cincinnati Bengals. On April 14, 2012, Lawson re-signed with the Bengals.

Buffalo Bills
On March 13, 2013, Lawson signed with the Buffalo Bills for 4 years worth up to $12 million. Under new defensive coordinator Mike Pettine Lawson switched from outside linebacker to defensive end in Pettine's 4-3 scheme  He then changed back to outside linebacker for the 2015 season in coach Rex Ryan's 3-4 scheme.

In 2016, Lawson was suspended one game for a violation of the league's personal conduct policy due to a domestic situation during the 2015 season, and he appealed the suspension. On September 2, 2016, Lawson was released by the Bills.
