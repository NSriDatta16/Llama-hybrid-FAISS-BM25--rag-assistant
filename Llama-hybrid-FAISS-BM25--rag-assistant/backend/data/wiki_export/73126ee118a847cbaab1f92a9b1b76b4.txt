"Les enfants du Pirée" ("Children of Piraeus") is a French song by singer Dalida, first released on EP in June 1960. It was a big international summer hit and remained one of major successes of her career. The song comes from the Greek movie "Never on Sunday/Pote tin Kyriaki" nominated for 8 Oscars and won an Oscar for the music of Manos Hadjidakis, sung by Melina Mercouri who starred in the movie along Jules Dassin.
