Souleymane Adama Diamouténé (born 30 January 1983) is a Malian former professional footballer who played as a defender.

Club career
Diamouténé was born in Sikasso. He spent his professional career in Italy, moving in the country after being noted by an Udinese scout. He then trained with the zebrette under-19 squad for a few months between 1999 and 2000, without being officially signed. After a friendly against Pisa, he was spotted by Francesco D'Arrigo, the head coach of the nerazzurri, who successfully signed him with his next club, Serie C1's Lucchese. Diamouténé spent two seasons with Lucchese, and in 2003 he was signed by Perugia.

In 2004, Diamouténé joined U.S. Lecce, becoming a mainstay of the salentini under coach Zdenek Zeman. He played two seasons in Serie A (2004–05, 2005–06) and two in Serie B (2006–07, 2007–08). He was confirmed with Lecce for the 2008–09 season, the first one back in the top flight for his club, but in January 2009, he was loaned to Roma with a pre-set price of €3.15M as a replacement for outgoing Christian Panucci.

On 31 August 2009, Diamouténé joined Bari on a loan deal.

On 10 February 2012, it was announced that Diamouténé had signed a one-and-a-half-year contract with Bulgarian A PFG club Levski Sofia. He was handed the number 25 shirt. On 23 May 2012, Diamouténé scored his first goal for Levski in a 7–0 win over PFC Svetkavitsa. In August 2016, he joined Maltese club Gżira United.

International career
At youth level, Diamouténé played at the 1999 FIFA U-17 World Championship.

He represented the Mali national team at the 2004 African Cup of Nations in Tunisia, the 2008 Africa Cup of Nations in Ghana and the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations in Angola.
