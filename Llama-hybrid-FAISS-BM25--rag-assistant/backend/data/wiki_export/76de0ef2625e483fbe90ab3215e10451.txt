Shifnal railway station is a railway station which serves the town of Shifnal in Shropshire, England. The station is managed by West Midlands Trains, who provide the majority of services that call here (it is also served by Transport for Wales, primarily on Sundays).

The station (opened in 1849) is located on a viaduct/causeway high above the village itself. It is on the Shrewsbury to Wolverhampton Line. When Shifnal was controlled by semaphore signalling it boasted a three-storey signal box.  The building by the entrance at street level is not in railway use and there are no permanent buildings left at platform level.

Facilities
The station is unstaffed, but does have a ticket machine.  Waiting shelters are provided on both platforms and service running information is given via CIS displays, timetable poster boards and customer help points on each side.  Level access is possible from the car park on the Birmingham-bound platform (1) only - the main entrance on Market Place is below platform level and is only accessible via a staircase, whilst the footbridge between the two platforms also has steps.

Services
There is a basic 1 train per hour off-peak service in each direction (Mon-Sat), westbound to  and  and eastbound to  and Birmingham New Street run by West Midlands Railway. This service is operated by Class 196 DMUs in 2 and 4 carriage configuration. Additional trains also call at peak periods, with the service becoming 2tph. One Transport for Wales service calls per day after midnight, westbound only to Telford and Shrewsbury. Sunday services are hourly calling at all stations, with an additional nightime Transport for Wales service heading eastbound to Wolverhampton on Sundays only.
