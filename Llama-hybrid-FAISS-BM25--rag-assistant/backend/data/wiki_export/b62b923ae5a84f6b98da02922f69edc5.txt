Heongang of Silla (c.861–886) (r. 875–886) was the 49th to rule the Korean kingdom of Silla.

According to the Samguk Sagi, he excelled at civil affairs.  Heongang was the eldest son of King Gyeongmun; his mother was Queen Munui.  He had no legitimate heir, but did leave a son (later King Hyogong) by Lady Uimyeong.

In 879, Heongang was faced with the rebellion of a high official, his Ilgilchan Sin Hong.  In 886, he sought to defuse domestic discontent with a decree of general forgiveness.

Heongang was buried to the northeast of Borisa temple in Gyeongju.
