Privilege is an album by Ivor Cutler, originally released in 1983 on Rough Trade Records. It was produced by David Toop and Steve Beresford, both of whom are better known for their work in improvisational music and, unlike Cutler's 1970s recordings, it sees Cutler's vocals accompanied by a wide range of musical instruments including keyboards, banjo, euphonium and alto flute. The LP is co-credited to Linda Hirst, who recites a number of poems and provides vocals on some of the tracks. The closing track, "Women of the World", was released as a single and became a minor hit on the UK Indie Chart. It has since been covered by Jim O'Rourke, on his 1999 album Eureka, and YACHT, on their 2007 album I Believe In You. Your Magic Is Real.

The album was re-released on CD in 2009 by Hoorgi House Records.
