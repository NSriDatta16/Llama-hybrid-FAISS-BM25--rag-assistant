Playing career

Rogers was born in Liverpool, England. With his previous club, Shelbourne, he had quite a successful spell. He joined them from Dutch club Cambuur Leeuwarden in June 2003. Rogers made his debut that same month against Derry City, the club he would later join in the future, and quickly established himself as a key player in the side of Pat Fenlon, who was the Shelbourne manager at the time. He won the League of Ireland championship with Shelbourne in 2003, 2004, and 2006.

"Scouser", as he is known by most was one of the favourite players of the club's fans, especially after his volley in the UEFA Champions League second qualifying round against the Croatian champions Hajduk Split.

His goal spurred Shels on to a famous victory and made the Reds the first Irish team to make it to the Champions League third qualifying round. However, the club was downtrodden with financial difficulties and unable to sustain its first-team squad by early 2007,

His former manager, Fenlon, who had taken the managerial position at Derry City in December 2006, convinced him that the Brandywell was the new place for him, and his signing of a two-year contract was announced by Derry City on 28 January 2007.

He made his debut for his new club during a pre-season friendly game against Newry City prior to the beginning of the League of Ireland 2007 season.

He then signed for St Patrick's Athletic during the June transfer market and played in their UEFA Cup 1st Qualifying Round against OB Odense of Denmark.

Rogers had earlier played in the Football League for Chester City, Peterborough United, Scunthorpe United and Carlisle United, and was at Tranmere Rovers. He also played in Scotland for Ayr United and Dundee in the Scottish Premier league and also won the Scottish First Division title with Dundee in the 1997–98 season.

Rogers joined Sporting Fingal on loan from St Patrick's Athletic on 27 February 2008. He returned to the Saints on 1 July. On 22 November he along with 8 other St. Patrick's Athletic players left on a free transfer.

In August 2009 Rogers signed for Lisburn Distillery but after four months both parties agreed to part by mutual consent and on good terms.

In March 2010 Rogers signed for newly formed Cork City FORAS Co-op. On 5 June 2010, Rogers departed the club by mutual consent. He made 15 league and cup appearances for Cork.
