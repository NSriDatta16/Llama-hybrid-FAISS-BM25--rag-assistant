The Nokia E70 is aimed at the high-end professional market. The 16 million color screen has a 352 × 416 pixel (totalling 146,432 pixels) resolution, and the E70 is capable of GSM, WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity. The SIP VoIP functionality will currently not work through a firewall or most router configurations. Nokia has made a statement that they are working on implementing STUN (originally planned for 2006 but only available for E70-1 as of April 2012), TURN and ICE (also planned for 2007 but not available as of June 2008).

As well, the advanced Bluetooth capabilities of the phone, capable of connecting to up to six devices simultaneously, lacks A2DP support.
