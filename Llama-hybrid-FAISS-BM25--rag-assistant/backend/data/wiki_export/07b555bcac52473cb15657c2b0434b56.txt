Kevin Charles Bass (born May 12, 1959) is a former American professional baseball right fielder who played in Major League Baseball for the Milwaukee Brewers (1982), Houston Astros (1982–1989, 1993–1994), San Francisco Giants (1990–1992), New York Mets (1992), and Baltimore Orioles (1995).

Career
The Milwaukee Brewers selected Bass in the second round of the 1977 MLB Draft. His MLB debut came on April 9, 1982. Bass was traded to the Houston Astros from Milwaukee with Frank DiPino and Mike Madden for Don Sutton on August 30, 1982. He played his final MLB game on October 1, 1995.

Bass had his best year in  for an Astros team that narrowly missed a World Series appearance. Bass was named to the  National League All-Star team, pacing the Astros with a .311 batting average, 20 home runs, 22 steals, and sterling defensive play. In Game 6 of the epic 1986 NLCS, he struck out swinging with men on first and second in the 16th inning, sealing a 7–6 victory for the Mets, allowing them to advance to the 1986 World Series.

On August 3, 1987, versus the San Francisco Giants, Bass became the 15th switch hitter in major league history to hit a home run from each side of the plate in the same game. In 1989, the Astros right fielder hit two grand slams in the season. The first homer stunned Cubs closer Mitch Williams, turning a 4–4 tie into an 8–4 Astros victory. The second homer, against Atlanta Braves reliever Mark Eichhorn on September 20, created a tie game that the Astros won in 14 innings.

In 1571 games over 14 seasons, Bass posted a .270 batting average (1308-for-4839) with 609 runs, 248 doubles, 40 triples, 118 home runs, 611 RBI, 151 stolen bases, 357 base on balls, .323 on-base percentage and .411 slugging percentage. He recorded a .982 fielding percentage at all three outfield positions.

Born in Redwood City, California, Bass attended Menlo School before being drafted after he graduated.
