Controversies 
The church has drawn attention for its vocal opposition, and active resistance to federal and local restrictions meant to halt the spread of COVID-19. The church's head pastor, Douglas Wilson, has posted on his blog and on YouTube to call on his followers to "resist openly, in concert with any others in your same position", which he said would constitute "an example of a free people refusing to go along with their own enslavement". Wilson's remarks, which also warned "we are not yet in a hot civil war, with shooting and all, but we are in a cold war/civil war", drew condemnation from a number of other Evangelical leaders. Wilson has also drawn controversy for co-authoring the book Southern Slavery as it Was, which described slavery in the Antebellum South as more benign than usually portrayed. Wilson has denied the accusation that he supports slavery, writing on his blog, "Am I a defender of the system of Southern slavery as it existed prior to the Civil War? No, I am not. This is a false charge."

2020 anti-mask protests
In late September 2020, Christ Church organized and promoted two anti-mask protests at Moscow's City Hall. The protests consisted of members of the church and local community gathering mask-less at City Hall and singing psalms and hymns to protest Moscow's mandatory mask policy which required people to wear a mask in public places or at large gatherings. These protests occurred on Wednesday, September 23 and Friday, September 25. At the Wednesday psalm sing/protest about 150 people showed up and five people were cited and three were arrested with the most notable arrestee being 2020 Latah County Commissioner Candidate and Christ Church deacon Gabriel Rench. At the second psalm sing/protest on Friday, September 25, the protesters were joined by counter-protesters who beat drums to try to drown out the singing. About 400 protesters showed up and no one was arrested. Charges against Gabriel Rench were later dismissed.

In February 2023, U.S. District Court Judge Morrison C. England Jr. ruled that "the City indisputably erred in interpreting its own Code", and that the church members ought never to have been arrested in the first place, since the city ordinances explicitly exempted both religious and protest activities.

Handling of sexual abuse 
Christ Church ministers have garnered widespread criticism for their handling of instances of sexual abuse within the church's congregation. Head pastor Douglas Wilson publicly asked for leniency in 2005 when Steven Sitler, a student at New Saint Andrews College, was convicted of sex offenses involving children; and following the student's release from prison, Wilson married Sitler to a woman introduced to him by a former church elder.  After the wedding, a judge ruled Sitler must be chaperoned around his infant son, after he admitted to feeling sexual stimulation resulting from contact with the baby. Wilson has been criticized for his handling of the abuse case and for marrying the couple. Responding to allegations that he supported Sitler's actions, Wilson wrote, "My role was to encourage the father who discovered it to report Steven to the authorities immediately, and in subsequent counseling with Steven, to require him to confess to the crimes he had committed that had gone undetected."

In 2005, Greyfriar's Hall student Jamin Wright, then in his mid-20s, was put on trial following allegations of a sexual relationship with 14-year-old Natalie Greenfield. Pastor Douglas Wilson reportedly asked investigators for leniency and testified to the judge in the case that the relationship between Wright and the accuser was a secret parent-arranged courtship. Ultimately, Wright was found guilty of "injury to a child". In 2013, Wright was again arrested, and convicted of domestic battery. Greenfield subsequently accused Wilson of having sided with Wright, but later publicly apologized, writing, "I want to state publicly that I have sought the forgiveness of Douglas Wilson, and that he has extended it to me. As far as the two of us are concerned, the public controversy between us is now over. I sought his forgiveness for treating him and his church community as my enemy, and for blaming him for things he had nothing to do with."

In September 2021, Vice Media published an article documenting allegations of sexual assault from a dozen victims. The article interviewed several former members of the church who claimed that "women are told they must defer to church leaders and cannot say 'no' to their husbands, men are taught to strictly control their homes, and those who speak out can be isolated and harassed". One former church member, and student at the Christ Church-affiliated New Saint Andrews College, told Vice that she felt compelled by the church to marry her boyfriend from New Saint Andrews, despite the constant rape and abuse she claims she suffered. Her wedding was officiated by the church's pastor, Douglas Wilson. The woman said that other wives in the church reported that marital rape was common, and that when she went to church leaders to protest, they told her that a wife is not allowed to say 'no'. She reported that when she eventually divorced her husband and left the church, her car was repeatedly vandalized, and she received online abuse from church members. Pastor Douglas Wilson responded to article saying that it was slanderous and inaccurate, writing that "Every Christian leader, pastor, board member, writer, thought-influencer, or teacher who read that Vice article and then publicly voiced their solidarity or sympathy with it—in any way, shape, or form—has disqualified themselves ... they might as well step down now before the methods and procedures they have internalized and endorsed come back around when it is time to devour them."

A number of additional allegations stemming from anonymous sources have been documented on Christian blogs and YouTube channels.

Local influence 
Dating back to 2019, the church's leader, Douglas Wilson, has stated that the church aims to "make Moscow a Christian town", and favors "theocracy" as opposed to "civil governments, [which] are in necessary degrees satanic, demonic, and influenced by the god of this world, who is the devil". In a November 2021 investigation, The Guardian found that "Church figures have browbeaten elected officials over Covid restrictions, built powerful institutions in parallel to secular government, harassed perceived opponents, and accumulated land and businesses in pursuit of a long-term goal of transforming America into a nation ruled according to its own, ultra-conservative moral precepts". Said parallel institutions include "educational institutions, publishing houses, churches, and national associations". Many of these institutions, including New Saint Andrews College, are run by members of Wilson's family. One of the founders of the college served as the former chief executive of the town's largest private employer, EMSI, which has hired about 10% of all of the college's total graduates since the school's inception. A local businessman, who spoke anonymously to The Guardian, said that the church had a large footprint in Moscow's downtown, and alleged that church members was attempting to attract new members to the town through a large development project planned by a church elder.

According to a Vice Media report, there is a regular section in the printed church bulletin that lists the names of those denounced by the church. Some people whose names have appeared on the list have allegedly faced harassment from church members, as well as boycotts of their businesses.

Crawford Gribben notes that Christ Church has made "very little impact on local politics", and that Moscow is not yet a Christian town.
