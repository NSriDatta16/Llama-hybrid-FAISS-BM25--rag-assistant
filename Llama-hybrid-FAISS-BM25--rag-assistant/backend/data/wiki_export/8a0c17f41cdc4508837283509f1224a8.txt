Essex Catholic Boys High School (formally known as Bishop Francis Essex Catholic High School after 2000) was a four-year Catholic high school located in Newark and East Orange, in Essex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The high school opened in 1957. It was run by the Congregation of Christian Brothers and sponsored by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark until its closure in 2003.

History
The school's original location was at 300 Broadway in Newark. In fall 1980, the all-male school was moved to East Orange, where it took over the location of the closed all-girl's East Orange Catholic High School. It remained open at that location until June 2003 when it closed due to a lack of enrollment. Concurrent with ECHS's move to East Orange, the Archdiocese created Essex Catholic Girls High School, an all-girls Catholic high school at the former location of Archbishop Walsh Catholic High School in Irvington.

The school was supported in its early years by the efforts of the Most Reverend Thomas A. Boland, the Archbishop of Newark. In 2003, Archbishop John J. Myers agreed to close the school when the student enrollment hit a record low of 267 students in its final year, down from more than 400 five years earlier. At its peak, enrollment hovered around 3,500. In 2000, ECHS was renamed Bishop Francis Essex Catholic High School.

The area surrounding the original location went into a sharp decline following the 1967 Newark riots. The situation was further complicated by an increase in tuition in the spring of 1970 that doubled the $300 annual cost to $600 per student. The tuition increase was phased in over a period of three school years. The Class of 1971 went from $300.00 in 1970 to $400.00 in 1971. The Class of 1972 went from $300.00 in 1970 to $500.00 in 1971 and the Classes of 1973 and beyond were charged the full $600.00.

The school's 300 Broadway location is listed in the National Register of Historic Places, and had been built in 1927 as the corporate headquarters of the Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company. The Archdiocese sold the building  to a private group, which later opened a nursing facility at the location.

Following the formal closing of the school in 2003, a small group of alumni and supporters attempted to reopen a "new" Essex Catholic High School at a different location. That plan never came to fruition.

Since its closing in 2003, ECHS has maintained an active alumni association, Essex Catholic High School Foundation, Inc. Since 1982, this group has held the annual Alumni Dinner and Hall of Fame Induction, which typically attracts more than 200 alumni, faculty, family and friends. The Foundation awards scholarships to children and grandchildren of alumni. The Foundation also runs other annual fundraising events, among them the 300 Broadway Reception & Tour at the school's original location, an Alumni Golf Outing, and an All-Alumni Reunion at McGovern's Tavern in Newark, N.J. The Foundation also supports Christ the King Preparatory School, a Catholic high school in the Cristo Rey Network, located at the former Our Lady of Good Counsel High School building in Newark. Proceeds from the 300 Broadway Reception & Tour and Alumni Golf Outing go directly to CTK Prep.
