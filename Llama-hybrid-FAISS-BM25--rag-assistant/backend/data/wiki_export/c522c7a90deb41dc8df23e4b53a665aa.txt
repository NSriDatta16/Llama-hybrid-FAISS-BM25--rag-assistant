History 
The Arcadia School District came to be at the same time as the incorporation of Arcadia in 1903.

About 1975, the closed-campus policy and the dress code were discontinued. The change was influenced by the U.S. Supreme Court decision Tinker v. Des Moines, which stated that students do not "shed their constitutional rights... at the school house door." That year the student population of Arcadia High reached its highest population at about 3,300 students.

In the 1980s, enrollment decreased considerably to about 2,200 students, largely due to the aging demographic in Arcadia. Since then, enrollment has rapidly increased. In the 1990s, the demographics of the school dramatically changed.

A $218 million bond measure was passed on the November 7, 2006, election ballot for the purpose of upgrading and repairing Arcadia schools. A large part of local property taxes are absorbed by the state, and Arcadia is the lowest-funded unified school district in Los Angeles County. A new Student Services Center provides a grand entrance to the high school on Campus Drive. The two-story structure includes general and special education classrooms, three computer labs, a television studio, graphic design and digital photography classrooms, and the high school's career center and health, counseling, and administrative offices. The brick and glass exterior finish visibly blends with other elements of the campus. Ground was broken in the summer of 2008.

The Science Building is located on the south side of the campus on Duarte Road. The two-story center includes chemistry labs with preparation areas and collegiate-style biology and physics classrooms separated by lecture rooms.

The  Arcadia High School Performing Arts Center is located at the northwest corner of the campus. The center has ground-level and mezzanine seating for 1,200, and a stage that accommodates 150 musicians. The building contains a smaller theater, orchestra and dance rooms, and an internal courtyard. The Performing Arts Center construction began in 2010 and opened in October 2012.

Controversies

Native American symbols in branding 
Before 1997, Arcadia High School had used several Native American symbols in its branding, including an "Apache Joe" mascot, the Pow Wow school newspaper, the "Apache News" television program, the "Smoke Signals" news bulletin boards, the school's auxiliary team's marching "Apache Princesses" and opposing football team fans' "Scalp the Apaches".

In September 1997, the L.A. School Board banned the use of offensive Native American branding from its schools following criticism from several Native American groups. Members of the groups then advocated the same for Arcadia. The school consulted with Native American groups and made some concessions, including the removal of the "Apache Joe" mascot, the "Apache Princesses", and some other portrayals of Native Americans. The student newspaper Pow Wow was renamed to Arcadia Quill in 2021. The news show Apache News retained its name.

Arcadia High School has established a relationship with the White Mountain Apaches through the Student Council Apache Commission (SCAC). The commission holds fundraisers and drives for the White Mountain Apache Tribe in Cibecue, Arizona, and monitors the school's use of Native American motifs.

In July 2020, following several petitions to change the school's nickname, AUSD Superintendent David Vannasdall announced that the administration will consider possible options after schools resume in-class sessions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Athletics

Arcadia High School is governed by the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) Southern Section as a member of the Pacific League. Its colors are cardinal and gold. The boys compete in baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, swimming, tennis, track and field, volleyball, water polo, and badminton. The girls compete in basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track and field, volleyball, badminton, and water polo. There is a pep squad that is made up of three individual groups: Song, Cheer, and Pep flags. Arcadia's main rival is Crescenta Valley High School. Both teams often contend for the League Championship.

Arcadia teams often qualify for the CIF playoffs. In 2005, boys' soccer was a finalist in the Division III CIF playoffs.The girls track team has lost only two dual meets in the last four years and regularly sends athletes to CIF Finals. More recently, the girls soccer team has won 7 consecutive league titles and had back-to-back trips to the CIF Quarter Finals for girls soccer.

Cross country, and track and field
The boys' cross country team were placed 3rd, 7th, 8th, 4th, 3rd, 1st, 2nd and 1st in the 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012 California Interscholastic Federation CIF-State Cross Country Championships in Division I, respectively. They were led by renowned head coach Jim O'Brien.

In 2005 they qualified for the state championship for the first time in school history. They placed third overall and earned a spot on the state podium. In 2006, Arcadia went to the Nike Team Nationals Championship open race where Andrew Pilavjian led the way for the Apaches as the ninth fastest American runner on the day he placed seventh in the open race and fourteenth overall (open and invitational races combined, including Kenyan national runners).

In 2008, the team placed fourth in Division I at the state championships and came in second in the Open (non-invitational) race behind Kenya at Nike Team Nationals. Renaud Poizat led the team at the state championship with a fifth-place showing. They then placed third at the state championship in 2009, losing by a narrow margin of just 12 points.

The team remained undefeated the entire season and broke the California state record. Arcadia senior cross country star Ammar Mousa was named the Gatorade boys' cross country runner of the year in California for a second straight year in 2011. As defending state champions in 2011, Arcadia came up short of back-to-back state championships where they placed 2nd, however, did end up placing fourth at the national championships. They were led by individual state champion Sergio Gonzalez.

In 2012, the boys cross country team won another state championship, led by Estevan De La Rosa. They went on to win the Nike Cross National Championships.

The Boys Track team has also been successful from 2005, winning over 90% of its meets and three league championships in a row, (2005–07).
