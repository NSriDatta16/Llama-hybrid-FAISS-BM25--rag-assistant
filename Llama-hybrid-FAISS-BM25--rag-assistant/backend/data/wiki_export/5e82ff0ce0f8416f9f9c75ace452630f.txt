Savin Hill is the first album by punk band Street Dogs. This is the first new material featuring lead singer Mike McColgan since he quit Dropkick Murphys in 1998.  The album is named after Savin Hill, a small area within the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts.

The album includes two covers, of Kris Kristofferson's "The Pilgrim: Chapter 33" and Sham 69's "Borstal Breakout". Dicky Barrett from the Mighty Mighty Bosstones provides guest vocals on the track "Justifiable Fisticuffs" and former Murphys bandmate Ken Casey and Mike's Murphys replacement Al Barr provide guest vocals on the track "Stand Up."

Casey was due to produce the album but his busy schedule with the "Dropkick Murphys" didn't allow him to. A video for the single "Savin Hill" was also released.
