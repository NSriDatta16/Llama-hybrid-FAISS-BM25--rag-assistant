The 43rd Air Mobility Operations Group is an active duty air mobility unit at Pope Army Airfield (formerly Pope AFB), Fort Liberty, North Carolina and is part of the Air Mobility Command (AMC) under the USAF Expeditionary Center. The unit is composed of eight squadrons, including one of the only two active Air Force aeromedical evacuation squadrons based in the United States.  The group's primary mission focuses on providing enroute operations and enabling global response and airborne support for Fort Liberty's 82nd Airborne Division.

The 43rd Operations Group was redesignated the 43rd Airlift Group (43 AG) on 1 March 2011 after the inactivation of the 43rd Airlift Wing and entered into an Active Associate arrangement with the Air Force Reserve Command's colocated 440th Airlift Wing (440 AW). 

In 2016, the 440 AW was inactivated due to funding issues and both the 440 AW and the 43 AG discontinued their airlift mission with C-130H Hercules aircraft.  

While the 440 AW was inactivated, the 43 AG was reorganized as a non-flying unit, later redesignated the 43rd Air Mobility Operations Group (43 AMOG) on 14 June 2016.

Overview
As an AMC unit, the 43rd Air Mobility Operations Group (43 AMOG) is part of the air force component of United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM).  It provides rapid strategic deployment of forces assigned to Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), the XVIII Airborne Corps and 82nd Airborne Division. It also provides combatant commanders with Airborne Joint Forcible Entry, combat airlift, aerial port, command and control, and other enabling capabilities.  The 43 AMOG comprises eight squadrons:

 43rd Force Support Squadron
 43rd Air Mobility Squadron
 43rd Comptroller Squadron
 43rd Medical Squadron
 43rd Operations Support Squadron
 43rd Communications Squadron
 49th Combat Training Squadron
 34th Combat Training Squadron

In the postwar era, the 43rd Bombardment Group was one of the first USAAF units assigned to the Strategic Air Command on 1 October 1946, prior to the establishment of the United States Air Force as a redesignation of the 444th Bombardment Group due to the Air Force's policy of retaining only low-numbered groups on active duty after the war.

It conducted long-range test missions, including the first nonstop flight around the world (26 February-2 March 1949), accomplished in "Lucky Lady II", a B-50A Superfortress (AF Ser. No. 46–0010) commanded by Capt James G Gallagher.

The group became non-operational in February 1951 when its squadrons were attached to the 43rd Bombardment Wing headquarters.  The group was inactivated in 1952 when the parent wing adopted the Tri-Deputate organization and assigned all of the group's squadrons directly to the wing.

Redesignated as the 43rd Operations Group, and activated, in 1992 when the 43rd Air Refueling Wing adopted the USAF Objective organization plan. From 1994 to 1997 the group was inactive when the wing was reduced to group size.  In 2011, the wing was inactivated, and the group received its previous designation, the 43rd Airlift Group.  Later, in 2016, the 43rd Airlift Group transitioned to a non-flying mission and was redesignated the 43rd Air Mobility Operations Group as it discontinued airlift operations and reorganized to inherit those non-flying responsibilities inherited from the 440th Airlift Wing following the latter's inactivation.

History

World War II
The 43rd Bombardment Group trained for bombardment operations during most of 1941. From December 1941 to February 1942, it flew antisubmarine patrols along the New England coast.

It then moved to the Southwest Pacific via Cape Town, South Africa, from February to March 1942. It attacked Japanese shipping in the Netherlands East Indies and the Bismarck Archipelago from bases in Australia, New Guinea, and Owi Airfield, Indonesia between August 1942 and November 1944.

While there it earned a Distinguished Unit Citation (DUC) for missions over Papua, New Guinea from August 1942 to January 1943.

The unit used skip bombing to sink Japanese ships during the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, 2–4 March 1943, for which the unit earned a second DUC. It also provided support for ground forces on New Guinea and attacked airfields and other enemy installations in New Guinea, the Bismarck Archipelago, Yap, Palau, and the southern Philippines in 1943 and 1944.

The group conducted long-range raids on oil refineries on Ceram and Borneo late in the war.

After moving to the Philippines in November 1944, the group attacked shipping along the Asiatic coast and struck factories, airfields, and other installations in China and on Formosa. It also supported ground forces on Luzon.

The unit moved to Ie Shima in July 1945, from which it conducted raids against airfields and railways in Japan and against shipping in the Inland Sea and the Sea of Japan. It was moved, on paper, to the Philippines in December 1945 and inactivated in April 1946.

Cold War

The 43rd Bombardment Group was again activated in 1946, when it assumed the mission, personnel and equipment of the 444th Bombardment Group, which was inactivated.  Until February 1951, the group trained and conducted long-range test missions, including the first nonstop flight around the world (26 February–2 March 1949), accomplished by Capt James G. Gallagher and his crew in a B-50 called Lucky Lady II.

The group deployed to England for training, August to November 1949. It was not operational after 10 February 1951, and, the flying squadrons were attached directly to the 43rd Bomb Wing for operations. The group was inactivated on 16 June 1952.

Modern era
On 1 June 1992, the group was redesignated as the 43rd Operations Group, and was activated on the same day. Between June 1992 and 1 July 1994, the group flew air refueling missions in training exercises and was then inactivated.

In 1997, it was reactivated and assumed an airlift mission. It cooperated with U.S. Army airborne organizations at nearby Fort Liberty, North Carolina, taking part with them in joint training exercises. Crews and aircraft deployed to Europe, and later to Southwest Asia, to support contingency operations such as enforcement of no-fly zones over Iraq and for expeditionary force rotations.

After terrorist attacks on the United States on 11 September 2001, the group deployed resources in the Global War on Terror.  The group was redesignated 43rd Airlift Group on 1 March 2011 and 43rd Air Mobility Operations Group on 14 June 2016.
