Camp Tarsoa
Camp Tarsoa was a large Japanese prisoner of war camp constructed during World War II. It consisted of a transit camp, a work camp and a hospital camp, and was founded on 24 January 1943. The work camp originally contained 400 prisoners, but was enlarged to 800 prisoners. The hospital had a very bad reputation and hardly any medical supplies. There were three large cemeteries near the camp, one of which was for deaths from cholera. The camps closed in April 1944. 

Australian prisoners of war veterans erected a memorial at Hellfire Pass, and each year on 25 April, there is a memorial ceremony. Hellfire Pass is located  from Nam Tok.
