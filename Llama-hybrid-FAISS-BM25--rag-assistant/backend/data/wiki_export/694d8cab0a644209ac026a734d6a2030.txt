Background
Two candidates contested the seat. The first was Charles MacMillan, a former Mayor of Tauranga (1915â€“1917. MacMillan represented the Reform Party and was put forward by the party to succeed Herries. The other candidate was Sir Joseph Ward, a former Liberal party Prime Minister.

He was overruled however, by the party executive citing the lack of any established branches within the electorate and the possibility of a poor showing by the candidate damaging party morale and credibility.
