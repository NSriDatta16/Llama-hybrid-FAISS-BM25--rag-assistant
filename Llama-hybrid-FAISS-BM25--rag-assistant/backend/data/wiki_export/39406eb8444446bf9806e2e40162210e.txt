Wheelchair rugby league is a wheelchair-based version of rugby league football, one of two recognised disability versions of the sport. It was developed by French rugby league player, coach and official, Wally Salvan in 2004. Unlike other wheelchair sports, people without disabilities are allowed to compete in top-level competition. The sport is also unique in the fact that men and women of any age can play against each other in top-level competition.

Rules
The game shares many features with the regular rugby league:

Use of a size 4 rugby ball
Ball may only be passed backwards
Each team retains possession for six tackles, after which there is a hand-over
A modified version of the play-the-ball is used after a tackle
Same offside rules as rugby league
The 2006 rules

The game then sees its own particular rules:

All kicks – penalties, drop outs and conversions – are taken with the fist
Matches are generally played on a handball court with dimensions of 40×20 metres
Indoor rugby posts are put in place for conversions, drop kicks and penalty kicks
 In professional competition a maximum of two 'able bodied' players are allowed on the pitch per team
