Newtown High School dates from 1897, having been constructed on the site of a small wooden schoolhouse built in 1866. The present building was designed by C. B. J.

Building

Newtown High School is a large secondary school in the residential neighborhood of Elmhurst, in western Queens. Bound by 48th and 50th Avenues, and 90th and 91st Streets, the school occupies an entire city block. The current building is a result of several building campaigns spanning nearly four decades, three architects, and several architectural styles.

The site has had a school since 1866, when a small wooden school house was built to serve the children of Newtown and neighboring farms.   The oldest extant portions of the school are from 1921, designed by C. B. J. Snyder in a Flemish Renaissance Revival style.  Snyder's choice of this style showed his awareness of New York's and particularly Elmhurst's, beginnings as a Dutch colony.  It is one of only a handful of public schools in New York City executed in this style. Snyder's design was built as an addition to the now demolished Boring and Tilton school completed in 1900. His design continued the stepped gables of the original building, and features a dramatic 169-foot, centrally placed tower topped by a cupola and turrets. The tower is visible throughout the neighborhood and gives the school its slogan: "We Tower Above the Rest." The Snyder addition comprises two wings, having granite imitating terra cotta bases, and clad with buff and beige brick, limestone, glazed terra cotta, and decorative ceramic tile, corbelled cornices, multi-soldier flat arch lintels, and sculptural relief on entrance porticoes.

As soon as 1930, another addition was built to accommodate the rapidly growing student population.  Architect Walter C. Martin, designed two additional three-story wings, that are stylistically similar but less ornate than the previous Snyder wings.  The Martin wings are Clad with buff and beige brick and limestone detailing; one features stepped gables with ceramic tile designs.

The most recent addition was completed in 1958 and designed by Maurice E. Salo and Associates.  This wing took the place of the original school building by Boring and Tilton which had been deemed by the Board of Education to be deficient and not able to be improved by renovations.  Instead of echoing the motifs of the previous additions, the four-story rectangular block addition was designed in the International Style.  The steel-frame structure is clad with beige-colored bricks, limestone trim and aluminum panels.

Due to the site's long history, and the architectural significance of the building, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated Newtown High School a landmark in 2003. In 2012 the New York Landmarks Conservancy honored a comprehensive exterior restoration with its prestigious Lucy Moses Award to the team led by SUPERSTRUCTURES Engineers + Architect.
