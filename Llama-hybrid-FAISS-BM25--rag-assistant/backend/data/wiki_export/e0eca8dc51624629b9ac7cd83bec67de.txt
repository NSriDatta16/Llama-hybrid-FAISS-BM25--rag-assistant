Józef Młynarczyk (born 20 September 1953) is a Polish former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper.

After representing three clubs in his homeland he played out the remainder of his career in France and Portugal, winning seven major titles with Porto during his one-and-a-half-season spell.

Młynarczyk played more 40 times with Poland, appearing in two World Cups with the country.

Club career
Born in Nowa Sól, Młynarczyk arrived at Widzew Łódź in 1980 aged 27, after playing for three modest clubs. During his four-year spell, in which he was equally first and second-choice, the team won two Ekstraklasa titles, finishing second in the other two. In the 1982–83 European Cup, he helped Widzew to the semifinals after edging Liverpool in the last-eight (4–3 on aggregate).

In 1984, aged 31, Młynarczyk signed with SC Bastia in France. In January 1986 he switched countries again, joining FC Porto from Portugal, where he won the European Cup, the Intercontinental Cup and the UEFA Super Cup. After an interesting battle for first-choice status with Zé Beto, he eventually became the starter – he was in goal for all of these finals – but lost his importance after the emergence of 18-year-old Vítor Baía, choosing to retire from football in June 1989.

Młynarczyk started immediately working with Porto's goalkeepers after his retirement, a position he would also hold at former side Widzew Łódź. On 21 April 2008, he resigned after the latter side hired Janusz Wójcik as manager.

International career
Młynarczyk won 42 caps for Poland during seven years, the first arriving in 1979 whilst in the ranks of lowly Odra Opole. He participated – always as starter – with the national team in two FIFA World Cups, 1982 and 1986, finishing in third place in the former edition and being ousted by Brazil in the round-of-16 in the latter.

Młynarczyk would also work as goalkeeping coach for the national team, before being replaced by Jacek Kazimierski.
