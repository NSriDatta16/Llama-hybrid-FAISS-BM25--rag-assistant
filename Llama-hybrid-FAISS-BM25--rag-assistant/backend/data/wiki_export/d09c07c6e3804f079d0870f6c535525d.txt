St. Gregory's Academy was an all-male Roman Catholic boarding school in Elmhurst, Pennsylvania. Affiliated with the Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter, it was founded in 1993. It promised a threefold education: spiritual, intellectual, and physical. Students participated in traditional Roman Catholic liturgy, were provided with intellectual formation based on the Integrated Humanities Program, and competed in high-school level soccer and rugby. Students participating on those teams won a Pennsylvania Rugby State Championship, and Patrick Audino was named a USA Eagle Rugby Player. The academy was closed at the end of the 2011–2012 academic year.

In response to the closure of the school, members of the school community, including faculty and alumni, founded a new school, the Gregory the Great Academy, which graduated its first class in 2014. However, the current Gregory the Great Academy is not officially the successor of the earlier St. Gregory's Academy. 

The purpose of St. Gregory's Academy was taken from Pope Pius XI's Divini Illius Magistri:

"The specific and immediate purpose of Christian education is to cooperate with divine grace in forming the true and perfect Christian… the true Christian, the product of Christian education, is simply the supernatural man: the man who feels, judges and acts always and consistently in accordance with right reason enlightened by the example and teaching of Jesus Christ."
