Minerals Planning Guidance Notes (MPGs) were statements of the British governmentâ€™s policy on minerals and planning issues and provide advice and guidance to local authorities and the minerals industry on policies and the operation of the planning system with regard to minerals.

Under the provisions of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004, they were gradually replaced by Mineral Policy Statements (MPSs).
Most MPS's and MPG's have now been superseded by the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) which replaced MPS1, MPS2, MPG2, MPG3, MPG5, MPG7, MPG10, MPG13, MPG15.

Mineral planning authorities must take their contents into account in preparing their development plans. The guidance may also be material to decisions on individual planning applications and appeals.
