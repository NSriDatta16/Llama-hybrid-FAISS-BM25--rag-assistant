History 

The club announced they would be installing a 3G all-weather pitch for the 2017/18 season. Carmarthen Town began the season with a number of games away from their Richmond Park home due these pitch renovations. With the new pitch the 'Old Gold' joined a growing list of Welsh Premier League clubs to install a 3G/4G pitch.

Richmond Park has been used for a number of International football matches. The majority of these have featured Wales national football team sides. The first match was against Scotland on 20 May 2003 which ended in a 2â€“1 victory for Wales.

Records 
The highest attendance recorded at Richmond Park is 911, for Carmarthen's League of Wales match against Barry Town, on 10 September 1997.

The stadium hosted its first European football match in July 2007 when Carmarthen Town entertained Norwegian side SK Brann in a UEFA Cup qualification match.
