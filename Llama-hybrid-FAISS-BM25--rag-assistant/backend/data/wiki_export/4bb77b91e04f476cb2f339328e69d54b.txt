He later served as platoon commander at SEAL TEAM ONE from 1977 to 1981, phase instructor at BUD/S Training from 1981 to 1983, research, development and acquisition officer at Naval Special Warfare Group 1, and Naval Special Warfare/Explosive Ordnance Disposal Officer at Naval Surface Forces Pacific.

Following his XO tour Calland was assigned as assistant chief of staff for research, development and acquisition at Naval Special Warfare Command from April 1988 to May 1990. He served at US Special Operations Command (SOCOM) at Tampa, FL from 1990 to November 1993. Calland became commanding officer of SEAL Team ONE from 1993 until January 1995.

Between August 2002 and March 2004, Calland served as the commanding officer of the Naval Special Warfare Command.
Calland's career at the Central Intelligence Agency began with his appointment to the position of associate director of Central Intelligence for military support in March 2004, a position he filled until his appointment as deputy director. Calland resigned from that position upon the confirmation of CIA Director General Michael Hayden, as a 1953 amendment to the National Security Act of 1947 prevents the director and deputy director from serving in the military simultaneously.

After leaving the CIA, Calland served for a year as deputy director for strategic operational planning at the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC). He retired from the navy on July 1, 2007, after 33 years of service, becoming executive vice president for security and intelligence integration with CACI International Inc.

Calland died on March 31, 2023, from long-term health complications caused by injuries sustained during his military service. He was 70. Calland is interred at the United States Naval Academy Cemetery.
