Uri Adelman (; September 3, 1958 – August 5, 2004) was an Israeli writer, musician, composer, computer expert, and professor at Tel Aviv University.

Biography
Adelman was born and raised in Ramat Gan, near Tel Aviv, the 8th generation of a German-Jewish family hailing from Jerusalem. Adelman used the TAU's musicology department where he worked as a setting for his first thriller novel, Concerto for Spy and Orchestra. His second novel, Lost and Found, was a fantasy novel about Ashkenazi moshavnik Mossad agents, who alternated frequenting the Jerusalem Cinematheque with flying secretly to Cyprus. Written using short chapters and clear, direct Hebrew, the novels were bestsellers in Israel, culminating in translations to German, Greek and Japanese. Critics in Israel praised Lost and Found as "the perfect Israeli thriller", and his writing has received favourable comparisons with John Grisham.

In addition to 4 novels, Adelman wrote computer textbooks for the general public. He died from a heart attack in a hotel room in Ramat Aviv, Tel Aviv, where he was writing his next thriller.
