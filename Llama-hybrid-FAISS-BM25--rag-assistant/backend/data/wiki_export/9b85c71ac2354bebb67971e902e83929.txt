So Kwun Wat, commonly pronounced So Kwun Fat, is an area on the south coast of the western mainland New Territories in Hong Kong. The proper So Kwun Wat is a populated area in the valley between Siu Lam and Sam Shing Hui. It includes So Kwun Tan () on the shore, which is a residential area, Hong Kong Gold Coast (), with villas on Pearl Island () off the coast.

Administratively, the area belongs to Tuen Mun District. Northwest of So Kwun Tan is the Perowne Camp ( or ).

Name
The confusion regarding its name originates from a common mistake when a person, with some knowledge of Chinese/Cantonese, tries to guess the pronunciation of the last character in the name, based on the form of its Chinese character. The English transliteration actually came from the correct (but no longer used in everyday life) pronunciation, although it's the common (but technically incorrect) pronunciation that is recognised by the locals. This causes many to wrongly deduce that the transliteration was not properly done. (When in fact it was â€“ much like the case with the name Mong Kok)
