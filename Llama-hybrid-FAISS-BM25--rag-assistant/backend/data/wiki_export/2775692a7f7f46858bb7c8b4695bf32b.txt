Mühltal is a municipality in the district of Darmstadt-Dieburg, which is located in Hesse, Germany. It is situated southeast of Darmstadt from which it is separated by the Stadtwald (City Forest).

Historically, there have been many watermills on Modau river and its tributaries. This gave rise to the name Mühltal ("Mill Valley, Mill Dale"), a district through which the river flows.
