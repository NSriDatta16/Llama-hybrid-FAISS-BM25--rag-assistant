Miss Teen USA 2003
Tami Farrell won her first title, Miss Oregon Teen USA in 2002 and went on to win the Miss Teen USA 2003 pageant in Palm Springs, California on August 12, 2003. She also won the Miss Congeniality award at the same pageant. Farrell was the third representative of Oregon to win the pageant.

As Miss Teen USA, Farrell represented the Miss Universe Organization. Her "sister" 2003 titleholders were Amelia Vega (Miss Universe, of the Dominican Republic) and Susie Castillo (Miss USA, of Massachusetts). She gave up her title to Shelley Hennig of Louisiana in Palm Springs on August 6, 2004.

Miss California USA 2009

In the summer of 2008, she won the title of Miss Malibu USA 2009 and competed at the 2009 Miss California USA Pageant where she finished as first runner up to the winner Carrie Prejean.

On June 10, 2009, she became Miss California USA 2009 after Prejean was sacked by Donald Trump. Prejean had created controversy by saying marriage should be reserved for a man and a woman during the interview portion of the Miss USA 2009 pageant.

When asked about the controversy in 2009, Farrell, who is a Christian, stated that she believes that marriage is between a man and a woman but added "I don't think that I have the right or anybody has a right to tell somebody who they can or can't love. And I think that this is a civil rights issue. And I think that the right thing to do is let the voters decide."
