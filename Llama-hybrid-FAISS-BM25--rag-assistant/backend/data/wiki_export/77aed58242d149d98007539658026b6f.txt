The village was first mentioned in 1216 as Elewoldesdike, and means "dike of Elewold (person)". Ellewoutsdijk developed in the 11th century on a ridge on the former island of Borssele. A creek used to extend to the market square, but has silted up.

A church was known to be located on a terp (artificial hill) since 1216. The medieval church was destroyed in 1944 by war. Between 1948 and 1951, the current Dutch Reformed church was built on the foundations of its predecessor. It is an aisleless church with a wide tower. 

A castle used to be located to the north of the village, and was home to the Lord of the heerlijkheid Ellewoutsdijk, Driewegen, Everinge en Coudorpe. The ruins of the castle were demolished after 1822.
