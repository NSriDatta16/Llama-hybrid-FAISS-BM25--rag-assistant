In Case of Emergency is an American half-hour sitcom television series shown on ABC in the United States. The series follows a group of high school acquaintances whose lives have not turned out as they hoped.  It premiered on January 3, 2007, at 9:30 pm and ended on April 11, 2007. The pilot episode was directed by Jon Favreau and the cast included Jonathan Silverman, David Arquette, Lori Loughlin, Kelly Hu, and Greg Germann.

Although ABC gave early renewal notices to several of its series on March 21, 2007, In Case of Emergency was not one of them. 

On April 12, 2007, ABC announced that the show had been officially cancelled, leaving one episode unaired, which has since been broadcast internationally.
