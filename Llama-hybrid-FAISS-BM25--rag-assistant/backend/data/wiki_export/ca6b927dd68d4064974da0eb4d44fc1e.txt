The 1999–2000 Serie A (known as the Serie A TIM for sponsorship reasons) was the 98th season of top-tier Italian football, the 68th in a round-robin tournament. It was contested by 18 teams.

By late March, Juventus topped the table by nine points over Lazio with only eight games remaining, but they lost to Milan, to Lazio at the Stadio delle Alpi, and to Hellas Verona, with Lazio only dropping two points, against Fiorentina. Lazio won the title on the final day of the season when Juventus lost their match against Perugia 1–0 on an almost flooded pitch, while Lazio comfortably beat Reggina 3–0 at home at the Stadio Olimpico.
