History

The company was founded in 1923 by Edgar F. Johnson and his wife Ethel Johnson. The company began as a mail order business, selling radio transmitting parts to amateurs and early radio broadcasters from space shared with a woodworking shop located in downtown Waseca. In 1936, E.F. Johnson Co. built its first factory and office building in Waseca, and had 17 employees. The company designed and produced electronic components in volume, and was active in World War II defense production. By 1945, the company had grown to 500 employees with expanded facilities in a garage, a nearby grocery store and the Odd Fellows Hall. In 1949, the first of the company's amateur radio transmitters were manufactured, the Viking I model. The Viking line of amateur transmitters included the Valiant, Ranger and Pacemaker. In 1958, the company manufactured equipment for the Class D Citizens Band Radio. One such transceiver, the Johnson Messenger, is exhibited in the Smithsonian Institution as an example of early American-made technology.

The company transitioned to development and manufacturing of land-mobile radio products such as the Logic Trunked Radio trunking format. EFJohnson's discontinued Viking line of amateur radio transmitter products are collected, restored, and operated by a number of vintage amateur radio enthusiasts.

In 1982, the company merged with Western Union, and was later purchased in 1997 by software manufacturer Transcrypt International. Headquarters relocated to Irving, Texas in 2005 and the company became EF Johnson Technologies in 2008. In 2010, EF Johnson Technologies, Inc. was acquired by Francisco Partners, and later absorbed by Japanese electronics company JVCKenwood in 2014.
