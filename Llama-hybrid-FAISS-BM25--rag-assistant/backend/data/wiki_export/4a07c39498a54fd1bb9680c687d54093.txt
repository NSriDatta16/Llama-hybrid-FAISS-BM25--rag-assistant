In 2010 Sheinman finished Let's Celebrate - a commission inspired by the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games. The work toured to five National Trust properties across the East Midlands throughout 2010 and comprised over 250 painted miniature sculptures.

Sheinman worked on a project titled Being Human, created in collaboration with researchers at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridge and funded by the National Trust, Mottisfont Abbey. The work, a 200-foot-long paper sculpture made of 25,000 pieces of hand-painted gold Japanese rice-paper representing the number of genes in the human genome, was displayed at Mottisfont Abbey in the autumn of 2011. A subsequent on-going project, What Makes You/You, which began in 2013, is a web-based digital and interactive series of artworks based on responses received from members of the public. What Makes You/You was selected in The Lumen Prize Exhibition longlist of 100 works and shortlist of 28 works, and was named the winner of the Founder's Prize. In 2018, Sheinman received a grant from the Arts Council National Lottery Project, to be an Artist in Residence at C2C Social Action, a Northamptonshire-based charity supporting offenders in the criminal justice system.

Sheinman is also involved with Artists Interaction and Representation (AIR) and in 2012 was elected as Chair of this organisation which represents over 16,000 artists within the UK.
