"Let the Wind Blow" is a song by American rock band the Beach Boys from their 1967 album Wild Honey. Written by Mike Love and Brian Wilson, the song is a ballad with lyrics that metaphorically relate nature to the essence of love.

Background and composition
According to biographers Andrew Doe and John Tobler, "Let the Wind Blow" was composed primarily by Love and "rearranged" by Brian. It marked the first composition recorded by the group that is in  time from beginning to end.

In his analysis of the song, musicologist Daniel Harrison called it "the most arresting and compositionally assured song on the album" adding that "it echoes the formal and harmonic technique of 'God Only Knows'."

Critical reception
Stylus Magazine wrote: "'Let the Wind Blow' is a moody ballad that swirls and throbs with a subtle psychedelia more hinted at than indulged in; proof of a growing sophistication that improves upon the Smiley Smile formula." In 1968, Gene Sculatti said the song was further evidence of Wilson's "weird ear for melody". PopMatters wrote that, in contrast to the Wild Honey single "Darlin'", "'Let the Wind Blow' ... is forlorn and urgent, with a gripping chorus and somber production. It’s fantastic."

Variations
An alternate stereo mix of "Let the Wind Blow" was included on the rarities compilation Hawthorne CA (2001).
A live performance of the song appears on the album The Beach Boys in Concert (1973).
