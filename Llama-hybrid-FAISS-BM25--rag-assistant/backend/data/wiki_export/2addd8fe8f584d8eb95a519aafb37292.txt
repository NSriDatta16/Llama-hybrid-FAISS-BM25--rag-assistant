History
SR 115 was first designated in late 1932. The original routing started at US 24 (now Old 24) and ran north through rural Wabash County to SR 15 much as it does today. By 1934 the road was constructed as an intermediate road surface of either stone or gravel. Within one year the road was upgraded to a high type of road surface, with a hard driving surface. Between 1979 and 1980 the new four-lane US 24 opened to traffic and the southern end of SR 115 was moved north to it.
