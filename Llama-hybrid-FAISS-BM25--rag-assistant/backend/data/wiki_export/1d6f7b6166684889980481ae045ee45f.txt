Robert Pressley's car caught air after he spun on lap 10. The rear of the car lifted so much, the car was temporarily sliding across the track on its nose. The landing was quite hard, so after the crew repaired the car, then Busch Series competitor and future 2-time Camping World Truck Series Champion Todd Bodine hopped in to complete more laps.
Joe Nemechek's car owner Felix Sabates bought the #73 entry of Phil Barkdoll, who had qualified 38th.  Nemechek went to the #73 for the 500.
Dale Earnhardt rolled his #3 Chevrolet in a crash with the #28 Ford of Ernie Irvan while in a four-way battle for the lead with 12 laps to go.  In the crash, the hood of Irvan's car flew into the backstretch grandstand, injuring some fans.  Earnhardt famously noticed that his tires were still on the car after the roll, had his car taken off the hook, and drove it back to pit road.  The car was repaired and Earnhardt finished the race, 5 laps down in 31st. The car can be found in a diecast form in 1:64 and 1:24 scale and is known to collectors as the "crash car".
At age 25, Jeff Gordon became the youngest Daytona 500 winner ever until Trevor Bayne in 2011. Richard Petty had previously been the youngest winner in 1964 when he won the 500 at age 26.
 Hendrick Motorsports posted a 1-2-3 finish with Gordon winning the race, Terry Labonte finishing second, and Ricky Craven finishing in third.

During the post-race inspection, Rusty Wallace's engine failed to meet the proper 14:1 compression ratio. Due to this, NASCAR suspended Wallace's victory and confiscated his car's motor. After conducting another test the following day, the cooler temperature engine met the required compression ratio. As a result, Wallace's victory was certified official.
Only 3 cars finished on the lead lap in this race.
This was the last Winston Cup race at Richmond International Raceway scheduled for the daytime (excluding three races that were rain-delayed from Saturday night) until 2016, and the last time that the first Richmond race of the season was held in March, due to the cold, wet weather that is often seen at Richmond in late winter.

This was the final race held on the  configuration of Atlanta Motor Speedway.  Renovations had already started that would turn the racetrack into a  quad-oval.
This race was red-flagged on lap 282 due to a crash involving the #41 of Steve Grissom.  The #23 of Jimmy Spencer had spun out off Turn 2 and was hit by the #31 of Mike Skinner.  Grissom spun to avoid this wreck and hit the inside wall near where there was a gate allowing infield access for motorhomes.  Because of this, the car hit the wall tail first, breaking the wall, shearing the fuel cell out of the car, and putting Grissom on his roof.  The #91 of Mike Wallace backed off the throttle upon seeing the accident, which caused his exhaust to throw flames right over the fuel cell (which was sitting along the outside wall at the end of the backstretch).  This caused a significant fire. Grissom was not seriously injured.

On the first lap of the race, 15 cars were involved in a multi-car accident in turns 1 and 2. Dale Earnhardt was involved in the incident, but was able to continue.
On lap 162, an 8-car crash on the tri-oval began when Mike Skinner, Brett Bodine and Sterling Marlin spun into the infield coming off turn 4, and Rusty Wallace struck the outside wall after getting into some oil. Later, Ernie Irvan rear-ended Greg Sacks at over 140Â mph while trying to race leader Terry Labonte back to the flag to get his lap back and hit the outside wall. Jeff Gordon ran into the back of Irvan trying to avoid Sacks.
Ricky Craven suffered a concussion in a practice crash and was forced to sit out.  This was the beginning of a series of injuries that adversely affected Craven's career over the next 4 years. Todd Bodine subbed for Craven in this race and ran very well until he crashed out of the lead.

The Melling Racing #9 team technically did not make the trip to Sears Point due to a lack of funding.  However, they allowed Jeff Davis' Winston West Series team to use their number on their Ford so that the Melling team could get the owners' points.  Davis ended up crashing out of the race, finishing 37th.
This was the last race for the Winston Cup Series on the  configuration at Sears Point Raceway until 2019. After this event, a purpose-built section was added for the NASCAR weekend.
After David Green failed to qualify, Caterpillar put their logos on the #35 Ford was driven by Larry Gunselman, one of the Winston West teams.  Gunselman started the race, but Green did get in the car and drive at one point.
The #19 Child Support Recovery Ford for Tri-Star Motorsports that was driven by Gary Bradberry in the race was actually qualified by Ken Pedersen, a driver in Winston West at the time.
The #78 Ford for Triad Motorsports tapped Tom Hubert, a crew member for Bahari Racing, to qualify the #78 in 2nd round qualifying.  When Hubert (who had some road racing experience in other classes) qualified fast enough to earn the 27th starting spot in the race, Hubert was put in the car for the race to temporarily replace the team's regular driver, Billy Standridge.
This was the final race at Sears Point held in May, as it had been for the previous 5 years. In 1998, the race moved to the last Sunday in June, where it would remain through 2017.
Geoff Bodine Racing's sponsor; QVC, ran an unusual promotion in which a lucky fan would get their name and face on Geoff Bodine's #7 QVC Ford, with the winner being Mississippi native Dawn Gillis. Ultimately, however, Bodine would finish in last place.

Winston 500 

The Winston 500 at Talladega Superspeedway was originally scheduled for Sunday, April 27, but rain forced the race to be postponed. Teams returned on Saturday, May 10 (Mother's Day weekend), and the race was held under sunny skies.

The race was run caution-free, the first time in Talladega history. It also stands as the fastest  race in NASCAR history (at , a record that still stands).
Joe Nemechek drove the #40 Chevrolet in place of Robby Gordon during this race since Gordon was attempting to do the Indy-Charlotte double in 1997.  As a result of the rescheduled race, it conflicted with Pole Day at Indianapolis.  As part of the contract that Gordon signed with SABCO Racing, the owner Felix Sabates provided a team for Gordon to attempt Indianapolis with.  As for Nemechek, he finished 19th, 1 lap down in Gordon's car.
This was the last race for the #20 Ford for Ranier-Walsh Racing.  The acquisition of their sponsor Hardee's by CKE Restaurants resulted in the company pulling sponsorship of the team. Without sponsorship, the team shut its doors. The #20 car would remain inactive until 1999 when Tony Stewart drove it for Joe Gibbs Racing.
Final time in his career that Mark Martin would win back-to-back races.

This was the last  race held at Dover.
Robby Gordon, in a rather freak incident during the Indianapolis 500, suffered significant burns to his legs early on when an invisible fire started in the cockpit of his #42 Chevy-powered G-Force. This forced him to sit out for a couple of weeks. Wally Dallenbach Jr. subbed for Gordon at Dover, finishing 36th after suffering electrical problems. He was credited with completing 364 laps of the 500 lap distance.
Three different leaders had problems in the last 50 miles of the race.  Second-place Jeff Gordon hit the back of leader Dale Jarrett while trying to avoid a spinning Kenny Wallace on lap 452.

Jarrett retook the lead after the caution, but blew an engine 5 laps after the restart; he finished 32nd.  Jarrett's teammate Ernie Irvan inherited the lead and led the following 9 laps, but on lap 472, Chad Little broke a rear end in Turn 1 and dropped grease on the track.  Irvan hit it, spun, and crashed out, finishing 30th.  That gave the lead to Rudd, who held it the final 27 laps to win.

This was the 1st career Winston Cup start for Jerry Nadeau in the #1 Pontiac for Precision Products Racing.  He replaced Morgan Shepherd in the car.
This race would be the final CBS race that Ken Squier was the lap-by-lap announcer for. Starting with the DieHard 500 in October, all future races aired on CBS would have Mike Joy as the lap-by-lap announcer while Squier was transferred to serving as the studio host.

This was John Andretti's first Winston Cup career win.
This was the last July race at Daytona scheduled to run during the day. The 2014 Coke Zero 400 was run during the day, but only after being postponed due to rain the previous night.
The race ended with a 1 lap shootout, likely the last such shootout in the Winston Cup Series. John Andretti's crew chief Tony Furr employed a rather cynical strategy of brake-checking the field on the final restart, resulting in a stack-up of cars on the backstretch. As the field entered the final turns, cars spread out 3 and 4 wide, resulting in a multi-car wreck developed in turn 4. On ESPN's telecast of the race, the spotter for one of the drivers involved could be heard yelling "Goddammit."
It was also Cale Yarborough's first and only victory as a car owner.

Jeff Gordon's victory made him the 2nd and final driver, joining Bill Elliott, to win the Winston Million. Ironically, the 2 drivers that won the Winston Million won it in the very first running in 1985, and in the very last running in 1997. The program was replaced the following season in 1998 with the No Bull 5 program, which offered five drivers (that finished in the Top 5 of the last No Bull 5 race) the chance to win 1 million dollars.
Dale Earnhardt mysteriously passed out during the pace laps for the race and hit the wall.  Nobody is really sure what caused this, but Earnhardt had to step out of the car for the day. Once the car was repaired, Busch Series driver Mike Dillon (the son-in-law of car owner Richard Childress) was tapped to sub in the #3. Dillon drove the car to a 30th-place finish, 85 laps down.

The top 5 (T. Labonte, B. Labonte, Andretti, Schrader, Irvan) became the first drivers eligible for the Winston No Bull 5 million dollar bonus for next season, meaning that if any of them were to win the 1998 Daytona 500, they would receive an extra $1 million.
With this win Terry Labonte became only the second Chevrolet driver to win a race in 1997. Jeff Gordon had all of the other wins for Chevrolet in 1997.
Last top 5 finish for Ernie Irvan.

During the summer, the track had been reconfigured from a traditional oval to a quad-shaped oval. The race was broadcast on ESPN.

Jeff Gordon entered the race with a 77-point advantage over Dale Jarrett and an 88-point advantage over Mark Martin. During a practice session on Saturday, Gordon was driving down the pit lane, scrubbing his tires to heat them up on what was a cold morning. Gordon lost control and crashed into the parked car of Bobby Hamilton. Gordon had to go to a backup car, and qualified a lowly 37th. Gordon had to finish 18th or better to clinch the championship, but starting deep in the field, he had charge his way up through the pack. Jarrett finished 2nd, Martin 3rd, and Gordon 17th, while Bobby Labonte took the victory, the first win for Joe Gibbs Racing since the team switched from Chevrolet to Pontiac. Gordon ultimately hung on and won the title by only 14 points over Jarrett and 29 points over Martin, the closest three-way points finish under the Bob Latford 1975 points system.
