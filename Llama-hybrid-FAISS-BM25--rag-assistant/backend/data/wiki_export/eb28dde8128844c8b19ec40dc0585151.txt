Nigel Osborne  (born 23 June 1948) is a British composer, teacher and aid worker. He served as Reid Professor of Music at the University of Edinburgh and has also taught at the Hochschule für Musik, Theater und Medien Hannover. Known for his extensive charity work supporting war traumatised children using music therapy techniques, especially in the Balkans during the Bosnian War, and in the Syrian conflict. He speaks eight languages.

Osborne was born in Manchester, England, to a Scottish family. He studied composition with Kenneth Leighton, Egon Wellesz, and Witold Rudziński. His compositions include the opera The Electrification of the Soviet Union, Concerto for Flute and Chamber Orchestra commissioned by the City of London Sinfonia, I am Goya, Remembering Esenin, and Birth of the Beatles Symphony.

Osborne retired from his Edinburgh University position in 2012, and is now working internationally as freelance composer, arranger and aid worker. Currently working with war-traumatised children from the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Career

Osborne studied composition with Egon Wellesz, first pupil of Arnold Schoenberg (1968–69), also with Kenneth Leighton (his predecessor as Reid Professor of Music at the University of Edinburgh) at Oxford University (1969–70), and later in Warsaw with Witold Rudziński (1970–71) where he also he worked in the Polish Radio Experimental Studio. From 1983 until 1985, while at the IRCAM in Paris, Osborne co-founded Contemporary Music Review with Tod Machover. He held a special professorship at the University of Nottingham from 1978 to 1987, the Reid Chair and Dean of the Faculty of Music at Edinburgh University from 1989 to 2012, a senior professorship (C4) at the University of Hannover from 1996 to 1998 and head of faculty for the Vienna–Prague–Budapest Summer Academy (ISA) from 2007 to 2014. Currently professor emeritus at Edinburgh University, visiting professor in the drama faculty of Rijeka University and consultant to the Chinese Music Institute, Peking University. He has worked as visiting lecturer and examiner also at Harvard, UCLA, CalArts, Gedai and Toho Gakuen School of Music, Oxford, the Sorbonne and Bologna.

Osborne's works have been performed internationally by Vienna Symphony, Moscow Symphony Orchestra, Leningrad Philharmonic, the Philharmonia of London, Los Angeles Philharmonic, Berlin Symphony, Glyndebourne, Opera Circus, Opera Factory, Scottish Opera and the Royal Opera House. He has received, among numerous awards, a Netherlands Gaudeamus prize, the Opera Prize of the Radio Sussie Romande and Ville de Geneve, and the Koussevitzky Award of the Library of Congress Washington.

In the 1980s, Osborne composed a series of classic works for choreographer Richard Alston and Ballet Rambert. Master of Music at the Shakespeare's Globe (1999–2000), and since 2000 has been house composer for Ulysses Theatre, Istria. Osborne has collaborated with directors Lenka Udovicki, Peter Sellars, David Pountney, Michael McCarthy and David Freeman, and with writers Samuel Beckett, Craig Raine, Eve Ensler, Jo Shapcott, Howard Barker, Ariel Dorfman, Tena Štivičić and Goran Simić, with notable actors Vanessa Redgrave, Annette Bening, Lynn Redgrave, Amanda Plummer, Rade Šerbedžija, Simon Callow, Ian McDiarmid and Janet Henfrey, also with artists and designers John Hoyland, Dick Smith, George Tsypin, David Roger, Bjanka Adzic Ursulov and Peter Mumford. Singers and soloists with whom Osborne has collaborated include pioneers of contemporary music, such as Jane Manning, Linda Hirst, Liz Lawrence and Omar Ebrahim, alongside long-standing collaborations with artists Florian Kitt, Ernst Kovacic and the Hebrides Ensemble. Osborne's film documentary credits include BAFTA-winning and -nominated collaborations with director Samir Mehanović, an EMMY-winning collaboration with the BBC, and the film Dans un océan d'images with Helen Doyle and InformAction, Montreal. He has a special interest in Arabic, Indian and Chinese music.

Osborne has pioneered methods of using music and the creative arts to support children who are victims of conflict. This approach was developed during the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina (1992–95), and since then this work has been implemented widely in the Balkan region, the Caucasus, the Middle East, East Africa, South East Asia and India. He was also been awarded the Freedom Prize of the Peace Institute, Sarajevo, for his work for Bosnian children during the siege of the city. Osborne has worked actively in human rights initiatives, Workers' Defence Committee in Poland (1970–89), Citizens' Forum and the Jazz Section with Václav Havel in former Czechoslovakia (1987–1989), for Syrian refugee support organisations. During the genocide Osborne worked directly for the Government of Bosnia-Herzegovina. From 2012 until 2014, Osborne served as co-chair of the Global Agenda Committee for Arts in Society for the World Economic Forum.

In 2004 Osborne began an artistic relationship with 'Opera Circus', a chamber opera and music theatre company based in West Dorset UK during which the Bosnian sevdah opera Differences in Demolitions was produced, with Bosnian poet Goran Simić and Scottish conductor William Conway. Opera Circus toured through BiH in 2017.

Osborne has been active in supporting the development of new music technologies, for example the Skoog, and is co-inventor with Paul Robertson of X-System, an 'informatic modelling of the musical brain'.  In December 2017 he received the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors' (BASCA) Award for Inspiration. Osborne was awarded both the Queen's Prize and Music Industry Prize for innovation in education, and was recently made honorary fellow of the Educational Institute of Scotland. He is a director of the Scottish educational development company, Tapestry Partnership.

In 2017, Osborne was commissioned by the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra to arrange Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band for the ‘It Was Fifty Years Ago Today’ concerts with the Bootleg Beatles performed to capacity crowds at the Royal Albert Hall and Echo Arena Liverpool.
