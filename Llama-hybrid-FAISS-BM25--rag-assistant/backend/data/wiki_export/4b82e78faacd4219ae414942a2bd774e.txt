Rupčine (Serbian Cyrillic: Рупчине) is an urban neighborhood of Belgrade, the capital of Serbia. It is located in Belgrade's municipality of Čukarica.

Location 

Rupčine is actually the southwesternmost part of the Žarkovo neighborhood, bordered by Bele Vode to the north, Cerak Vinogradi (that is, Ibarska Magistrala road) to the east, and the Vodovodska Street and Makiš to the west. On the south, Rupčine borders with the open fields of Stari Lanci and Novi Lanci, which stretch all the way to Železnik.

Characteristics 

Quite contrary to its eastern bordering neighborhood, Cerak Vinogradi, Rupčine is not built according to urban plans and is highly unattractive in either urban, visual or sense of communal order. Atop of all that, it has quite unattractive name too (rupčine, Serbian for big holes).

Neighborhood had an estimated 7,000 inhabitants in March 2022.

Sub-neighborhoods 

Makiške Terase

By the 2020s, some parts of the neighborhood acquired more favorable names. Northern half, directly descending from Bele Vode, was named Makiške Terase ("Makiš Terraces"). It starts at the Momčila Čedića Street, where the sign with the new name of the neighborhood was placed. Border with the southern half of Rupčine is the Časlava Veljića Street, where a new, local post office "Makiške Terase" was opened in March 2022.

Savska Terasa

Southern section of Rupčine, in the direction of Železnik, became known as Savska Terasa ("Sava Terrace"). The foundations for the new Church of the Assembly of Saint John the Baptist, in the Đure Gavele Street, were consecrated on 16 April 2017 by the Patriarch of the Serbian Orthodox Church, Irinej. The lot was donated by the local resident Mrs. Borika Nikolić. Church was designed by architect Ljubica Bošnjak, and it should be completed by the end of 2023.
