The Riverwest Currents is a monthly newspaper published in Milwaukee, Wisconsin since 1999 by owner/publisher Vince Bushell. It has sometimes used the slogan "The Community Voice of Milwaukee's Left Bank," which was coined in 2001 by Dan Knauss (then the Currents' web editor) as a reference to the generally liberal or leftist reputation of the Riverwest neighborhood and the general ethos of the publication.
