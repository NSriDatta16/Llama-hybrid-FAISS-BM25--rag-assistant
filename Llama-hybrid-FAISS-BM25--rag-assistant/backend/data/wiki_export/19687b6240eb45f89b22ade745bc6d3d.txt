Fog on the Tyne is a 1971 album by English rock band Lindisfarne. Bob Johnston produced the album, which was recorded at Trident Studios in Soho, London, in the mid-1971 and released in October that year on Charisma Records in the United Kingdom and Elektra Records in the U.S..

It gave the group their breakthrough in the UK, topping the album charts early in 1972 for four weeks and remaining on the chart for 56 weeks in total. "Meet Me on the Corner", one of two songs written by bassist Rod Clements, reached No. 5 as a single.  The title track became the band's signature tune.  Simon Cowe made his debut as a writer, contributing the song "Uncle Sam".

Both tracks on the B-side of "Meet Me on the Corner", "Scotch Mist" (an instrumental), and "No Time To Lose", appeared as bonus tracks when the album was reissued on CD.

A heavily reworked version of the title track with vocals by footballer Paul Gascoigne was released in October 1990 under the title "Fog on the Tyne (Revisited)", credited to Gazza and Lindisfarne. It reached number two on the UK Singles Chart.
