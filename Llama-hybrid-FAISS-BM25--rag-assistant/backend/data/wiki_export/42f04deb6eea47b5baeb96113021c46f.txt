"Do I Do" is a song written and performed by American singer and songwriter Stevie Wonder, first released in 1982 on the compilation album, Stevie Wonder's Original Musiquarium I (1982). The single peaked at #2 on the US Billboard soul chart and #13 on the Billboard Hot 100. On the Billboard dance chart, "Do I Do" went to number one for two weeks.  Overseas, it reached #10 in the UK.

Background
The album version of the song is ten and a half minutes long. It features a rare example of Wonder rapping near the end of the track. Dizzy Gillespie is also featured on the track with a trumpet solo. Both of these are omitted from the single edit of the song (some longer edits retain the Gillespie solo but omit the rapping). Wonder audibly counts down at the end of the track, which is not commonly heard at the end of musical singles. The song is noted by bassists for its intricate bassline, played by Nathan Watts. A commercial success, it was the recipient of three Grammy Award nominations including for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance and Best R&B Song. The song became the basis for Ja Rule's "Livin it Up."
