Undercurrents, 'the magazine of alternative science and technology' (), was published in England between 1972 and 1984: when it was merged into Resurgence: 63 editions all together.

In the 1970s, Clifford Harper provided illustrations. For much of that period it appeared every two months and the circulation peaked at 7,000 in the late 1970s. It became the ‘house journal of the alternative technology movement’. The magazine has been republished on the World Wide Web using Issuu and, in part only, on Scribd.
