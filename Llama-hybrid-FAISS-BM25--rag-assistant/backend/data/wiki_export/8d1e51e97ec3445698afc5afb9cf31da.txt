Athletics
Northmont is a member of the Greater Western Ohio Conference (GWOC). 

The school's mascot is the Thunderbolt, but its student populace are more colloquially known as the T-Bolts or just the Bolts.  This moniker was unintentionally gained from a basketball commentator in the school system's early years (circa 1960s), who, while watching the high school boys' team racing back and forth across the court, exclaimed that they were zipping back and forth like "thunderbolts."

New building
A 5.9 mills levy was placed on the November 8, 2011 ballot to construct a new early learning center and new high school, as well as making improvements to the other buildings in the district. It passed with a 53% yes vote. Construction on the new building began in late 2012 with the relocation of the tennis courts, softball diamonds, and band rehearsal field. The only part of the current building that remained is the school's auditorium, constructed in 1987, which was brought up to code with the new building. Construction was completed and opened to students January 11, 2016.
