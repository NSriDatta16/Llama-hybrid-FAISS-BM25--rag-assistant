Under-age success
In the 2006-07 season the club's Under-16s and Under-18s both won the Munster club rugby titles. These are following a number of years of dominance in the club's provincial division East Munster. This has resulted in a large of numbers of players going on to represent Waterpark on the East Munster team (who have also won the last two Munster inter-divisional titles).

Notable players and coaches
Darren Coleman, former player-coach of Waterpark RFC, later became a successful professional head coach, winning the United States Major League Rugby Championship and the Australian Club Championship.
