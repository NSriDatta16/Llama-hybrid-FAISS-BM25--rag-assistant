The 1990–91 UEFA Cup was won by Internazionale on aggregate over Roma. For the second time in a row, the final was contested by two Italian teams. This tournament also marked the return of English clubs after a five-year ban resulting from the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985. However, for this season, only one English club (English First Division runners-up Aston Villa) competed in the UEFA Cup, from a previous total of four.

Teams
A total of 64 teams participated in the competition, all entering into the first round. Spain, Romania and Denmark gained a slot, while the Soviet Union, Scotland, Austria, France and Yugoslavia lost a slot (the latter two due to the end of the English ban).
