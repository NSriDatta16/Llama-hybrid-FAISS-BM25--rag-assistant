History

The school was named after one of the first European settlers of British Columbia, with the school being located in the upstairs of Eburne Superior School at the current location of David Lloyd George; it was relocated in 1913 to its current location. While the original Magee Secondary School was built in 1914, it has since been reconstructed. The new Magee officially opened in the year 2000, right in time for the new millennium.

The current student population at Magee is approximately 1275, and it has approximately 100 staff members.

Magee boasts an outstanding fine arts department. More than 500 students are involved in the award-winning music department's three faculties: band (4 concert bands and 2 jazz bands), concert choir, Evolution choir, chamber choir, strings, and a recent addition of the Magee Symphony Orchestra. Magee senior music students tour internationally every two years. Recent tours have included Hawaii, Thailand, St. Petersburg, Russia (2007), Japan (2009), Central Europe (2011), Spain (2013), the UK (2015), Cuba (2017), and the Baltic States of Finland, Estonia, and Latvia (2019). Some members of the String Orchestra were invited to play on the recording of International Recording Artist K’Naan's new rendition of "Wavin’ Flag" for the Young Artists for Haiti project produced by legendary rock producer, Bob Ezrin.  Many of the graduates of the art department go on to careers in art, with many of them studying internationally.
