In 1959 she married David Cunliffe-Lister, Lord Masham (1937–2006), who became Earl of Swinton in 1972. By this marriage, she became entitled to the honorifics Lady Masham, and, later, Countess of Swinton.

Disability campaigner 
Cunliffe-Lister sustained spinal cord injuries in 1958 in a riding accident, becoming paraplegic when she was 22 years old.  Her rehabilitation took place at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, where she met Sir Ludwig Guttmann, the founder of the Paralympic movement.  

In 1974 she founded the Spinal Injuries Association an organisation which supports and advocates for spinal cord injured people. She was the life-long President.

She was the subject of This Is Your Life in February 1976 when she was surprised by Eamonn Andrews in the foyer of the De Vere hotel in Kensington, London. 

Cunliffe-Lister was an active member of the House of Lords, where she continued to be known as the Baroness Masham of Ilton, a title she held in her own right.  In 1970 she was the youngest Life peer and became the longest running female peer with 53 years of service.   She took a particular interest in  disability rights, accessible public transport and accommodation, the added cost of living, rehabilitation, health including HIV/AIDs and Long Covid, and penal reform.  

She opened the factory for Nordis Signs, part of the Kier Group, in Northampton, which employs a majority-disabled workforce.
