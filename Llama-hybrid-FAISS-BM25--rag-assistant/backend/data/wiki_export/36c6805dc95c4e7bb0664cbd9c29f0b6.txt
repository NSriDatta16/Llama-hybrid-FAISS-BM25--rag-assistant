Career

At the 2006 Commonwealth Games, he was in contention for eight medals. Starting off with a silver, he finally won five Gold, one silver and one bronze. After winning the one silver and five Gold, nerves got the better of him in the 25m centrefire pistol individual event where he could manage only a bronze. In the standard fire pistol individual competition, his gun malfunctioned and he fell out of contention for a medal in that event. He was given the David Dixon Award at the closing ceremony, an award given to the "most outstanding athlete at the 18th Commonwealth Games". He was dubbed "Goldfinger" by the volunteers at the Games .
