Music career
Rachel Trachtenburg has been a member of the Trachtenburg Family Slideshow Players, The Prettiots, Supercute!, and Larry and the Babes. She is currently the guitarist and vocalist for New York–based three-piece band Wooing.

Trachtenburg Family Slideshow Players

Trachtenburg played harmonica (and later drums) for her parents' act, the Trachtenburg Family Slideshow Players. The band had its early start playing gigs in Seattle in 2000 and 2001 until they moved to New York City in 2002 to reach a larger audience. Trachtenburg and her parents played gigs across America and Europe nonstop from 2003 to 2008. While on the road, Trachtenburg was homeschooled. The band disbanded in 2011 when the band had run its course.

Supercute!
After the Slideshow Players disbanded, Trachtenburg began to put more focus into her band, Supercute!, an indie pop/psychedelic pop girl band she founded with friend and co-songwriter Julia Cumming. From 2009 through 2013, the band toured several times in America and Europe with their friend and mentor English singer-songwriter Kate Nash, going through several band member changes - founding co-member June Lei left in late 2010 - as well as musical changes. The band recorded a song, "Superrookie!", for the September 2011 debut of Tavi Gevinson's online magazine, Rookie, which was later released as a flexi disc accompanying the 2012 Drawn & Quarterly book release of Rookie Yearbook One. In 2011, the band recorded an entire album (DON'T PoP MY BUBBLE) produced by Kate Nash that featured the single "Dumb Dumbs" - the video of which features cameos of Nash, Jason Trachtenburg and Andrew W.K. Another song from those 2011 sessions ("LoveLoveLeaveLove") received a video release in 2013, but the rest of the album has yet to see the light of day.
