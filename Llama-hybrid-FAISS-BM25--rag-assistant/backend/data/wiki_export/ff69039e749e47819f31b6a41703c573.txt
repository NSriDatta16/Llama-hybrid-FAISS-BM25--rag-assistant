Music video
Most of "I Disappears music video was shot in Monument Valley atop a sandstone butte on April 13, 2000.  After accessing the butte by helicopter, Metallica and their instruments were alone on the plateau, circled by filming aircraft, for over twelve hours.  By the end of the shoot, winds were so severe that the drum kit was blown over, footage of which appears in the video.  Ulrich was later filmed on a skyscraper in Downtown Los Angeles for "action sequences, explosions, chaos and mayhem".

The 2000 music video also featured a 1967 Chevrolet Camaro driven by Metallica band member James Hetfield.  Hetfield was given the car after filming, and in 2003, listed it on eBay.  With  on the odometer, the restored two-door car had an automatic transmission and was bidding at  with seven days remaining in the auction; proceeds from the sale were earmarked for music education programs.

Release
While still working on the song, Metallica learned in 2000 that a pre-release version was being aired on US radio stations.  The band traced the source of the song to the peer-to-peer file sharing service Napster.  After finding their entire catalog available on Napster, they became the first musicians to file lawsuit against the service (Metallica v. Napster, Inc.).  , "I Disappear" was available for streaming via the Napster streaming music service.

Critical reception
Music critic Mike McGuirk (of the San Francisco Bay Guardian) described "I Disappear" as leaning on a reworking of "Enter Sandman" with an incorporation of some grunge aesthetic.  McGuirk said that following Metallica's Load, which he called their "country record", this new song with a "mega" riff and "catchy as hell" melodic choruses proved that the band was not afraid to change things up.
