The Catholic Church in Morocco is part of the worldwide Catholic Church (particularly the Latin Church), under the spiritual leadership of the Pope in Rome. Catholics account less than 1% of the overall population of over 31 million. The country is divided into two archdioceses; Rabat and Tangier.

During the era of the Spanish protectorate and the French protectorate over Morocco, the conditions of the Catholic Church have flourished, and Catholic churches, schools, and hospitals were built throughout the country, and until 1961, Sunday mass festivities were broadcast on radio and television networks.

During the era of the Spanish protectorate and the French protectorate over Morocco, Morocco had significant populations of European Catholic settlers: on the eve of independence, an estimated 470,000 Catholics resided in Morocco. Since independence in 1956, the European Catholic population has decreased substantially, and many Catholics left to France or Spain. Prior to independence, the European Catholic settlers had historic legacy and powerful presence.

Demographics
Prior to independence, the numbers of the Catholics in French Morocco reached about 360,000 or about 4.1% of the population, Catholics in French Morocco were mostly of French descent, and to a lesser extent of Spanish and Italian ancestry. Some Moroccans of Berber or Arab descent converted to Christianity during the French colonialism. Since independence in 1956, the European population has decreased substantially, and many Catholics left to France or Spain. In 1950, Catholics in Spanish protectorate in Morocco and Tangier constitute 14.5% of the population, and the Spanish Morocco was home to 113,000 Catholic settlers. Catholics in Spanish protectorate in Morocco and Tangier were mostly of Spanish descent, and to a lesser extent of Portuguese, French and Italian ancestry.

In the years leading up to the First World War, European Christians formed almost a quarter the population of Tangier. During the French protectorate in Morocco, European Christians formed almost half the population of the city of Casablanca. Independence prompted a mass exodus of the European Catholic settlers; after 1956 more than 75% of Catholic settlers left the country. 

In 2020, there are aporoximately 24,000 Catholics in Morocco; this included 53 priests and 155 nuns. Most Catholics were European expatriates, with a big majority of French and Spanish from colonization and post-independence.  The second group is composed of Sub-Saharan immigrants, mainly students. Aside from Arabic, all of the Europeans can speak Spanish and French, which are also spoken by Catholic Arabs, Berbers, and Moors, and these languages are used in the celebration of Mass, in prayer meetings, and in education. 

There are also converts from Islam, the dominant religion and when they exist, they keep their faith secret. On March 31, 2019, Pope Francis openly acknowledged that there are few Catholics, as well as few Catholic church workers, in the country.

There are also between 3,000 and 10,000 Protestants in the country, most of them from sub-Saharan Africa.
