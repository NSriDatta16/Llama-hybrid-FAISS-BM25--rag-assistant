Green Is Blues is the second studio album by American singer and songwriter Al Green. Released by Hi Records on April 15, 1969, two days after Green's 23rd birthday, critics and fans alike consider the album his breakthrough release, following the lukewarm reception of his 1967 debut, Back Up Train. Green Is Blues marks the first collaboration of Green and musician Willie Mitchell, who also served as the album's main producer; the co-founder and President of Hi Records, Joe Cuoghi, acted as the recording supervisor.

Upon the album's '40th Anniversary' re-release, as a digital deluxe package in July 2009, noted soul writer Pete Lewis of the award-winning 'Blues & Soul' stated: "Significant for matching for the first time Green's soulful refined vocal brilliance with the skilful production of co-writer/producer Willie Mitchell and the tight arrangements of Memphis' renowned Hi Rhythm Section, the album ushered in a new era for "The Memphis Sound" – effectively kick-starting a studio partnership between Green and Mitchell that would see Al go on to become the premier soul superstar of the early Seventies – and arguably the last great Southern soul singer, period."
