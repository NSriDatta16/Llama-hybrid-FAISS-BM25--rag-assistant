Religion
Donoughmore civil parish is coterminous with the Roman Catholic parish which has two functioning churches: St. Josephs and St. Lachteen's. These churches are in the Catholic Diocese of Cloyne. A Church of Ireland church existed in the parish until the 1960s, when it was de-consecrated. The building was a garage until recently, and a plaque in the garage commemorated this fact. Although the Church of Ireland church is now gone, the title of Prebendary of Donoughmore still exists. The current prebendary is The Revd Dennis MacCarthy, rector of Bandon union of parishes.

At Donoughmore Cross there is also the ruins of a very old church. This church is the origin of the Shrine of Saint Lachtin's Arm. This shrine now resides in the National Museum of Ireland and is a hollow bronze sculpture of an arm and hand. The shrine contains wood which itself contains a small cavity that would have held a relic at one time.

After the Rev John Buckely became parish priest of neighbouring Grenagh in 1869 he came to the conviction that his parish was too small. As a result, he requested a transfer of land to Grenagh from Inniscarra and Donoughmore.

History

During the Lordship and Kingdom of Ireland periods. A peerage system was established in Ireland to help with the administration of English rule. One of these titles, the Earl of Donoughmore, takes its name from the parish. The story is that Francis Hely of neighbouring Kilshannig conformed to the established religion, and after doing so he was able to marry a Protestant woman named Prudence Earbery, the daughter of Mathias Earbery, a leaseowner in Donoughmore. Their son John Hely married a woman by the name of Christina Nixon, who was an heiress to her grand-uncle Richard Hutchinson. After marriage he took the name of John Hely-Hutchinson. He became a politician and provost of Trinity College Dublin. Using his position he got his wife a peerage, and she took the name of his homeland as her title even though she did not live there but in Knocklofty, Tipperary.

When the IRA prisoners were executed instead of being released, the decision was made to execute the major. The manner in which he accepted his faith holding no ill will to his captors and including writing a letter to his wife with the opening words 'My own darling little wife, I'm to be shot in an hour' left a mark on many, including Michael Collins, who went to great lengths to retrieve the location of his body.
