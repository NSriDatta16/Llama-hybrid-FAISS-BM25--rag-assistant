History
When Bangladesh (as East Pakistan) was part of Pakistan, Pakistan Army established some cadet colleges in West Pakistan (now Pakistan) and four cadet colleges in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) in the form of British Public Schools. After the liberation war, Bangladesh Army established eight more cadet colleges (among them Mymensingh Girls Cadet College 1983, Joypurhat Girls Cadet College 2006, Feni Girls Cadet College 2006 had been established for girls). Sylhet Cadet College is the first cadet college established after the liberation War of Bangladesh in 1971. It was established in Pakistan as a model school in 1969. In 1974, it was modified and converted to a model college. Bangladesh Army modified this model college and converted it to a cadet college in 1978. In 1979, An admission test took place for selecting the students from model college to keep them in this new modified Cadet College. First, second and third batch of this new cadet college was from the model college, and in the same year 4th Batch was taken as fresh cadets. First Batch passed the college in 1982 and first intake, i.e. fourth batch, passed in 1985. And from that time, an admission test started taking place every year to admit new cadets in class seven.''
