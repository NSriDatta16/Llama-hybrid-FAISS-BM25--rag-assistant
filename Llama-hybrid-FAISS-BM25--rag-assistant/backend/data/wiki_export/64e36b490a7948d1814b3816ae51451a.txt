Newfield High School is a public high school in Selden, New York, United States. It is located  north of Middle Country Road (Route 25) on Marshall Drive.

History and overview
As suburban growth spread into central Suffolk county in the 1950s, the new Middle Country Central School District was created in 1957 from the merger of the Selden and Centereach school districts.  Newfield opened in 1959 to serve the growing population, as neither district had ever had a high school.  Before its opening, upper-level students had been sent to Port Jefferson High School.

Newfield's name is derived from the former names of both Centereach (which adjoins Selden and is part of the same school district) and Selden; New Village and Westfield.

It has always served as secondary school, currently educating students from the 9th through 12th grade.  In the past, students from the 9th grade were educated at Selden Junior High School, and this changed when the Junior High formally became Selden Middle School and the 9th grade was passed on to Newfield.

Athletics
Newfield fields a number of varsity and junior varsity athletic teams, in Section 11, Division 1 of the New York State Public High School Athletic Association, including baseball, basketball, bowling, cheerleading, cross country, fencing, field hockey, football, golf, gymnastics, lacrosse, swimming, soccer, softball, tennis, track & field, volleyball (girls), and wrestling.

Although team uniforms use the school's red and white colors, in the late 1990s, varsity teams began using black as a third color to distinguish from junior varsity.

On June 20, 2021, Newfield High Schools varsity baseball team, The Wolverines, won The Suffolk County Baseball championship for the first time.
