Mark Staunton (born 30 January 1989 in Alexandria) is a Scottish footballer who is currently without a club after leaving Stirling Albion in August 2015.

Club career
Staunton began his career with Celtic, playing in the under-19 youth team. He left Celtic to join Charlton Athletic in July 2006, with the London club - who paid Â£110,000 - having kept tabs on him for nearly a year previously. Staunton left Charlton to join Falkirk in August 2007 but was sent to Berwick Rangers on loan for the rest of the season in December 2007, with Falkirk manager John Hughes admitting he was "concerned about his lack of games." Mark was released by Falkirk on 27 June 2009.

On 23 July 2009, Staunton joined Scottish Second Division side East Fife. He was released at the end of the 2009/10 season, when he moved to junior side Beith.

Staunton returned to senior football in the 2012 summer transfer window, when he signed for Stranraer.

On 21 June 2013, Staunton returned to junior football, signing for Irvine Meadow XI F.C.

On 15 June 2015, Staunton signed for Stirling Albion. After just two months at the club, on 18 August 2015, he left Stirling Albion after asking to be released from his contract.

After a less than successful junior football career, Mark now focuses on charity work, providing cut price temporary electrics to the construction industry.

International career
Staunton has been an unused member of Scotland under-19 squad, previously playing at national under-16 and under-17 level.
