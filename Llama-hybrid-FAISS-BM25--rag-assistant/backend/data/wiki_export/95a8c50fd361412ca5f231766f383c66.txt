Frognal is a small area of Hampstead, North West London in the London Borough of Camden. Frognal is reinforced as the name of a minor road, which goes uphill from Finchley Road and at its upper end is in the west of Hampstead village.

History

The first reference to Frognal is as a tenement in the 15th century, probably on the site of the later Frognal House (now 99 Frognal).  By the mid-eighteenth century it was a significant settlement, sought after by eminent lawyers, and infill development continued through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

The organist at St Andrew's Presbyterian Church was the father of composer John Tavener.

Architecture
Frognal has a diverse architecture, with many architecturally notable buildings. The central area, lacking large council estates, has undergone less change than some other parts of Hampstead. University College School, an independent day school founded in 1830, relocated to Frognal (the road) in 1907. Frognal Grove, Grade II listed, (1871–72) was a large house inherited by the architect George Edmund Street, who made additions to it. It was later subdivided into four semi-detached houses.
