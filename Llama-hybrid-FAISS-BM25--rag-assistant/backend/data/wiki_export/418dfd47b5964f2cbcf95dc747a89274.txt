History
NRCC opened as New River Vocational-Technical School in 1959 and came under the jurisdiction of the VCCS in 1966. It was originally located in the City of Radford, in the old Belle Hethe Elementary School Building. The school's name was changed in late 1969. In November of that same year, the newly named New River Community College broke ground in Dublin. Currently, the college has an average enrollment of approximately 5,000 students.

The collegeâ€™s current president is Dr. Patricia B. Huber, who has served in that capacity since 2017. She is the fifth president and first female to hold that position.
