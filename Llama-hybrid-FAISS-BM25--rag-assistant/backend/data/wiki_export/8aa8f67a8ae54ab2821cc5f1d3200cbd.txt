the Hurmuzachi family (Hurmuzaki, Hurmuzache) is a noble Romanian family from Bukovina of Greek origin. During the 17th-19th centuries they were associated with the Cernăuca estate in Bukovina.

History 
The most prominent members were the Hurmuzachi brothers. Their father was Doxachi Hurmuzachi (d. April 1857), who eventually re-acquired Cernăuca after the documents of the ownership of the estate by the family had been lost and built a new boier palace and church and planted park there. Doxaki married Iuliana (Ilinka, Olena) Murguleț (d.1858), daughter of a Romanian boier (stolnic), and they had 12 children, of whom 7 survived: the five brothers and two sisters, Eufrozina and Eliza.

Doxaki was son of medelnicer Constantin Hurmuzachi and Roksana (d. August 12, 1818) from Moldavia.
