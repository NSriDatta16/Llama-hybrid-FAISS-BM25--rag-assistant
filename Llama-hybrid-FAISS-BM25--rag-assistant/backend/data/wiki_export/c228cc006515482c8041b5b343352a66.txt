Storyteller is a compilation album from Scottish singer-songwriter Donovan. It was released on 16 September 2003 (Audio Fidelity 015) and was the first Donovan album released as a Super Audio CD/CD hybrid.

History

In 2003, Audio Fidelity issued a compilation consisting chiefly of Donovan's 1965 Pye Records recordings, but also secured the right to add his Epic Records recordings of "Sunshine Superman", "Mellow Yellow", "Hurdy Gurdy Man" and "Atlantis".  All of the songs were remastered for both the CD and Super Audio CD layers by Steve Hoffman.  In 2006, MsMusic Productions reissued this album on 33 rpm vinyl record with a few additional tracks from the Pye Records years, the 4 Epic Records tracks on a bonus 45rpm EP and different artwork as pictured on the right, below.
