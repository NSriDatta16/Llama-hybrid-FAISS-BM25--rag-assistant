SouthernUnderground is the second studio album by American hip hop trio CunninLynguists. It was released on April 1, 2003 via FreshChest Records. Recording sessions took place at Deacon's Crib in Lexington, Kentucky. Production was handled by member Kno, who also served as executive producer, Domingo, Freshchest Prose and RJD2. It features guest appearances from Cashmere The PRO, Masta Ace, Supastition and Tonedeff.

As well as resident vocalist Deacon the Villain and DJ/vocalist Kno, the group employed Mr. SOS to accompany on vocals for much of the album. In addition to these three, other artists from the QN5 record label appear, including Tonedeff.

It is best known for its single "Seasons", featuring Masta Ace, that details that history of hip hop comparing different eras to seasons of a year. It also has some political songs, such as "Dying Nation", "War" and "Appreciation", which takes a somber, storytelling approach to the September 11 attacks.

It also includes the song "Falling Down", which is based on Falling Down, a film about a man violently making his way across Los Angeles.
