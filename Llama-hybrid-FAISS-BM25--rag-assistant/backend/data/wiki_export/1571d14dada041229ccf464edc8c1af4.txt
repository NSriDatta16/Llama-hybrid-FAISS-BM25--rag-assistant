History
Shinvi was promoted by SM Entertainment but was actually under a subsidiary of the company, similarly to their labelmate group Milk. Their first album was scheduled to be released in late 2001, but instead came out in April 2002. Shinhwa member Jun Jin appeared in the music video of their title song, "To My Friend". A poll was conducted on Shinvi's website to determine what the group's follow up release would be. "Darling" was voted as the next song for the group to promote, and it was also used in the online game Shining Lore. Shinvi released another solo song on the SM Entertainment compilation album Summer Vacation in SMTOWN.com, entitled "Summer in Love". The last album that the group participated in was 2002 Winter Vacation in SMTOWN.com. Though Yuna appeared in the music video for "My Angel My Light", only Soo Jin and Sang Eun were featured on the album's jacket. Since this last release there have been no updates on the status of the group, and Shinvi is assumed to have disbanded.
