Tano South Municipal District is one of the six districts in Ahafo Region, Ghana. Originally it was formerly part of the then-larger Tano District in 1988, until the western part of the district was split off to create Tano North District in December 2004; thus the remaining part has been renamed as Tano South District. It was later elevated to municipal district assembly status in April 2018 to become Tano South Municipal District. The municipality is located in the eastern part of Ahafo Region and has Bechem as its capital town.
