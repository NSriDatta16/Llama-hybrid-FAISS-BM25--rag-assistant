Pac-Car II  was developed as a student project at ETH Zürich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology). Based on a group of students and an experienced team leader, the goal was to build a vehicle that uses as little fuel as possible. By using hydrogen fuel-cell, developed at ETH/PSI (Paul Scherrer Institute), as power source, pure water is the car's only emission. Clean mobility completed therefore the educational and energy saving aspects of the project.

Features 

 Aerodynamic (, Af=0.254 m²)
 A lightweight body (total mass of 29 kg, carbon fibre materials)
 Low rolling resistance of Michelin's Radial Tyres (Cr=0.0008)
 Efficient powertrain (almost 50%)
 Use of simulation and optimization tools (CFD, FEM, MATLAB and Simulink, GESOP)

World record 

In 2005 on June 26, the PAC-Car II set a new world record in fuel-economy of 5385 km/L gasoline equivalence during the Shell Eco-Marathon in Ladoux, France. During its third race over 20.6 km the car consumed approximately 1 g of Hydrogen driving at an average speed of 30 km/h (roughly 18.6 mph). This corresponds to  gasoline equivalence. This record is certified by the Guinness Book of World Records.
