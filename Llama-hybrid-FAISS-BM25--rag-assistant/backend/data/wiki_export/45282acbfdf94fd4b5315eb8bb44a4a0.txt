Stolen Memories: Secrets from the Rose Garden is a 1996 film made for television directed by Bob Clark starring Mary Tyler Moore. It involves a young boy who goes to visit his three aunts (Linda Lavin, Shirley Knight, and Mary Tyler Moore) for the summer at their home in the south.

The film was released on The Family Channel on January 7, 1996 and released as well as produced by The Family Channel Network, Lavin Entertainment, and MTM Enterprises. 

Due to distribution issues after The Family Channel was merged to Fox Family the following year, the movie was rarely seen in repeats before abandoning it indefinitely as it was deemed "unsuitable for television" as of 2020.
