History

In 1929, Sun Zhen (孫震), the deputy general of the 29th Brigade of the National Revolutionary Army of the Kuomintang founded the first Shude Voluntary School. Between 1929 and 1932, Sun Zhen founded four other Shude Primary Schools. Among the four Shude Primary Schools, one of them was later expanded to include a co-educational Middle School division. The boys' division was located at Hsi Lai Temple (西來寺) at Shude Lane (樹德里) on Lingxia Street (寧夏街), while the girls' division was located at Shude Alley (樹德巷) on Lingxia Street (寧夏街). 

In the fall of 1937, with the donations from the then Governor of the Sichuan Province, Li Jieren and Chairman Chen of the Jialezi Company, the school was expanded to include a High School division. A school board was formed. Since then, Shude High School became a fully operating co-educational Secondary School. In 1943, the school was commended by Professor Yang Renpian, Professor at the Wuhan University, as one of the six best private secondary schools.

Following the establishment of the People's Republic of China, in 1950, the school was nationalized and renamed Chengdu No. 9 High School (成都九中) by the Chengdu People's Government. In 1953, the school was recognized as one of the three main secondary schools in Chengdu City. In the late 1950s, No. 9 High School of Chengdu served as the school for children of the cadres of the Chinese Communist Party in Chengdu and wider Sichuan Province, as well as a designated school for the children of returned Overseas Chinese. In 1980, Shude High School was honored as the first batch of exemplary schools in Sichuan Province.

In June 1988, the high school celebrated its 60th anniversary and reverted its name from Chengdu No. 9 High School to the current Shude High School due to the requests from Sun Zhen's eldest son, Sun Jingshan (孙静山) and alumni from all over the world. Sun Jingshan visited the school from Taiwan and donated to the school's library. 

In 2000, Shude High School was chosen as a model senior secondary school of China. In 2004, the school introduced the Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE) and became the first school in Sichuan Province to bring in an international curriculum. 

During 2007-2010, the school expanded and another two campuses were founded (Guanghua campus and Foreign language campus, respectively). In 2009, the Shude High School Educational Group was formed. Since then, it helped the development of 17 member schools. In 2011, the school introduced the International Baccalaureate Curriculum and became the first public high school to do so. In the same year, the school was commended by Peking University and Tsinghua University. In 2013, the school was chosen as a First-level model school of Sichuan Province. In 2019, school staff and alumni celebrated the 90th anniversary of the school at its foreign language campus.
