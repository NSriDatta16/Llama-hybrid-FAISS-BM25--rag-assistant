Call of the Mastodon is a compilation album of early recordings from the American metal band Mastodon. It was released on February 7, 2006, by Relapse Records.

History
The songs on Call of the Mastodon originally appeared on Mastodon's first release, 9 Song Demo, with lead vocals by Eric Saner. After Saner left the band, the vocals were re-recorded by guitarist Brent Hinds and bassist Troy Sanders, and the updated songs appeared on the band's Slick Leg and Lifesblood EPs. Several years later, the songs (with Hinds' and Sanders' vocals) were remixed and remastered by original engineer Matt Washburn, and released as Call of the Mastodon.

In a documentary on the making of Crack the Skye, Hinds referred to Call of the Mastodon as the band's first studio album; this sentiment was later echoed by guitarist Bill Kelliher when he appeared on Loudwire's 'Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction'.
