Huxley Pig is a British stop motion animated children's television series based on a series of picture books authored by Rodney Pepp√©.

The series was produced by FilmFair for Central TV, with narration by Martin Jarvis. 26 episodes aired from 1989 through 1990.

General theme

The main character, Huxley Pig, was always dreaming of adventure, exciting professions and encounters. At the start of each episode Huxley would be in his bedroom talking to Sam the squawking seagull and wondering about something. He would open his big suitcase of dress-up clothes, try something on and say, "Hmmm, I wonder". The picture would fade and be taken away into his daydreams for the rest of the story.

In the dream, Sam the Seagull would be able to speak, in a Cockney accent, and there were many other varied characters such as:
 Vile Vincent, the vampire pig-butler
 Horace, a hamster and something of a con artist
 Cuddles, a fanged green beast
 Sidney, a snake with a lisp
 The Ringmaster, the ringmaster pig who runs the Circus
 Ethel, Gloria and Myrtle, The 3 Girls
 Lady Agatha Porker, The Lady who lives at the Hall
 The Zoo Keeper, the zoo keeper pig who only appeared in Huxley Pig at the restaurant

The adventures took Huxley and the gang to many places, as long as there was food nearby. Food was close to Huxley's heart. Upon the conclusion of the daydream, Huxley would return to reality and find a memento from the story had mysteriously returned with him.
