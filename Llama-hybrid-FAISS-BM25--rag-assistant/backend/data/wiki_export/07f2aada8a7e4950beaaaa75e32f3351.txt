James Ronald Horn (born November 20, 1940) is an American saxophonist, woodwind player, and session musician.

Biography
Horn was born in Los Angeles, and after replacing saxophonist Steve Douglas in 1959, he toured with member Duane Eddy for five years, playing sax and flute on the road, and in the recording studio. Along with Bobby Keys and Jim Price he became one of the most in-demand horn session players of the 1970s and 1980s.

Horn played on solo albums by three members of the Beatles, forming a long association with George Harrison after appearing at the latter's Concert for Bangladesh benefit in 1971. Horn toured with John Denver on and off from 1978 to 1993. He also played with Denver in concert occasionally after the Wildlife Concert in 1995.

He played flute on the original studio recording of "Going Up the Country" by Canned Heat, reproduced in the film Woodstock.
Horn played flute and saxophone on the Beach Boys' album Pet Sounds, and played flute on the Rolling Stones' album Goats Head Soup.
Horn also collaborated with Don Williams on at least two songs and toured with Williams for two years.

In 2007, Horn was inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville as a member of the Wrecking Crew.
