HaKfar HaYarok - Levi Eshkol Green Village () is a youth village in Israel, located in southern Ramat HaSharon, along the northern border of Tel Aviv-Yafo.

Name
Gershon Zak, the founder of the village, called it in 1950 "Green Village", without a definite article, with the intention to name it after David Ben-Gurion (1886–1973), whose original name was Gryn or Grün, lit. "green" in Yiddish or German. However, many people did not understand the message contained in the name, and over the years a definite article became added to the institution. Another 20 years later, once the death of Israel's third Prime Minister, Levi Eshkol (1895–1969), occurred before that of the older Ben-Gurion, "the green village" was called after him, becoming since "The Levi Eshkol Green Village".

Some of these programs include an educational track taught in English (EMIS), veterinary studies and an arts program.

Each year a group of recent high school graduates do "Shnat Sherut" volunteer service prior to their IDF induction, it's possible that they come to live in the village as program counselors for the residential students.
