History

Englewood High School was established in 1873 by the Chicago Board of Education and opened for the 1874–1875 school year. Plans for a newer building for Englewood was purposed in March 1974 due to the aging of the then-100-year-old building. The new structure was built in 1978 on the same site to replaced the demolished original. Englewood's new campus opened for students in 1979.

The school board decided in 2005 that, due to its poor performance, Englewood would be phased out over a three-year period to allow the freshmen who had entered to be the final class to graduate. Many reasons were behind the closing of this school. It was one of the worst performing public schools in the US for the end of 2008. Englewood was closed as an action in the CPS Renaissance 2010 program. After graduating its final class of 151 seniors in June 2008, Englewood High School closed.

TEAM Englewood
Under Renaissance 2010 program, Englewood was re-opened as TEAM Englewood Academy High School for the 2007–2008 school year. The new school was designed by the new staff. Still fully operated by the school district, TEAM Englewood was a smaller school that consisted of more community involvement with curriculum. Team Englewood still used the Englewood High School team name "The Eagles" and colors of purple and white. With the last of its students having graduated or transferred to other schools during the 2017–2018 school year, TEAM Englewood formally closed in November 2018.

Other information
In 2002, 18-year-old Englewood senior Maurice Davis was shot to death at a bus stop located in front of the school. He was the seventh student killed in or near a public school in Chicago.  Before closing, this school was a participant in one of the oldest rivalries in the United States against Hyde Park Career Academy (now Hyde Park Academy High School).

In 2023, Chicago Public Schools is moving to take over operation of the school.On July 25th the all boys school located in Englewood and Bronzeville won their court appeal.

School song
"Our Furlong"
All voices raise in songs of praise for Furlong
Our flags unfold and banners hold for Furlong
For many friends throughout the land
With joyful hearts all willing stand
To shout her praise for dear old Furlong.

O Furlong, our Furlong,
How many times before
You've taught us how to faithful be
You're turned defeat into victory
O Furlong, our Furlong,
We'll stand by you today
Hurrah for the Purple and White
Hurrah for the Purple and White.

Then here's a cheer for schoolmates, dear hurrah, hurrah,
And here's a hand for teachers, grand hurrah, hurrah,
Our loyalty we pledge to thee
We'll work for what we hope to be
All honor then to dear old Furlong.

Oh, tell me of a high school
Where I should like to go
Where jolly pupils gather
And seek life's work to know.
Oh, tell me is there sunshine
In class and hall and heart
For I should like to join that school
And try to do my part.

Art Folz and the 1925 Chicago Cardinals

Prior to the 1933 season, the National Football League team with the best record in the standings at the end of the season, was named the season's NFL Champions.  In 1925, with the Chicago Cardinals trailing the Pottsville Maroons a half game lead in the standings, two extra games were scheduled by the Cardinals against the inferior Milwaukee Badgers and Hammond Pros, both of which were NFL members at the time, to close the standings gap. Art Folz, an Englewood High School graduate and a substitute quarterback for the Cardinals, convinced four players from Englewood High School to join the Milwaukee Badgers for the game under assumed names, thereby ensuring that the Cardinals' opponent was not a pro caliber club. The Cardinals later defeated Milwaukee 59–0. NFL President Joseph Carr later learned that high school players had been used and told reporters the 59-0 Cardinals win would be stricken from the record. However, the league had never got around to removing it. The game is still a part of the NFL records. The Cardinals' owner, Chris O'Brien, was also fined $1,000 by Carr for allowing his team play a game against high schoolers, even though he claimed that he was unaware of the players' status. Badgers' owner Ambrose McGuirk was ordered to sell his Milwaukee franchise within 90 days. Art Folz was then barred from football for life.

However prior to the 1926 season, Folz's lifetime ban was lifted, however he chose not to return to pro football. The $1,000 fine against O'Brien was rescinded. McGuirk though had already sold his Badgers franchise to Johnny Bryan, a fullback with the Chicago Bears. The Englewood players were also forgiven, and two of them, William Thompson and Charles Richardson, earned high school all-star recognition at the end of the season. Folz reportedly told the high schoolers that the game was a "practice game" and would in no part affect their amateur status.
