Código Postal (lit. "Postal code") is a Mexican youth telenovela produced by José Alberto Castro for Televisa in 2006.

The serial takes place in Acapulco, a popular tourist destination in the state of Guerrero, Mexico. The series is set within an exclusive gated community where the bulk of the cast resides. Like many Mexican telenovelas the cast comprises young, attractive actors, and many of the plotlines revolve around suspense, heavy struggles, love and romance.

On Monday, May 29, 2006, Canal de las Estrellas started broadcasting Código Postal weekdays at 6:30pm, replacing Rebelde. The last episode was broadcast on Friday, February 23, 2007 with Lola...Érase una vez replacing it the following Monday.

Jery Sandoval which was replaced by Africa Zavala and José Ron starred as protagonists, Altair Jarabo, Imanol Landeta, Eugenio Siller, Jacqueline García, Ulises de la Torre and Claudia Godínez starred as young co-protagonists, while Andrea García, Jessica Coch, Ana Bertha Espín and Guillermo García Cantú starred as antagonists.
