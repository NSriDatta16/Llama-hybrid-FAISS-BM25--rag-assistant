This page details statistics of the UEFA Cup and UEFA Europa League. Unless notified these statistics concern all seasons since inception of the UEFA Cup in the 1971–72 season, including qualifying rounds. The UEFA Cup replaced the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in the 1971–72 season, so the Fairs Cup is not considered a UEFA competition, and hence clubs' records in the Fairs Cup are not considered part of their European record.

General performances

By club

A total of 29 clubs have won the tournament since its 1971 inception, with Sevilla being the only team to win it seven times, and only one to win three in a row. A total of fifteen clubs have won the tournament multiple times: the forementioned club, along with Liverpool, Juventus, Inter Milan, Atlético Madrid, Borussia Mönchengladbach, Tottenham Hotspur, Real Madrid, IFK Göteborg, Parma, Feyenoord, Chelsea, Porto and Eintracht Frankfurt. A total of 32 clubs have reached the final without ever managing to win the tournament.

Clubs from eleven countries have provided tournament winners. Spanish clubs have been the most successful, winning a total of fourteen titles. Italy and England are second with nine each, while the other multiple-time winners are Germany with seven, Netherlands with four, and Portugal, Sweden and Russia with two each. The only other countries to provide a tournament winner are Belgium, Ukraine, and Turkey. France, Scotland, Yugoslavia, Hungary, and Austria have all provided losing finalists.

The 1980 UEFA Cup saw four Bundesliga teams (i.e., Bayern Munich, Eintracht Frankfurt, Borussia Mönchengladbach, and VfB Stuttgart) make up all of the semi-finals competitors — a unique record for one country. Frankfurt beat Mönchengladbach in the final.

Clubs from a total of 53 European cities have participated in the tournament final. Clubs from 27 cities have provided winners, with the clear city leaders being Sevilla and Madrid (seven and five respectively).

 Until 1997, the UEFA Cup was the only European club competition which routinely allocated multiple entrants to many countries. This has led to several finals featuring two clubs from the same country:

 During the 1979–80 season, West Germany had five entrants including cup holders Borussia Mönchengladbach. All five managed to reach the quarter-final stage and both semi-finals ended up being all West German affairs. Ultimately, Eintracht Frankfurt defeated Borussia Mönchengladbach in the final. No West German club that season was eliminated by a non-German club.
 During the 1997–98 season, France had seven entrants: Strasbourg as winner of French Coupe de la Ligue, Nantes as third-placed team from French Division 1, FC Girondins de Bordeaux as fourth-placed team from French Division 1, Metz as fifth-placed team from French Division 1, and also Auxerre, Bastia and Lyon as 1997 UEFA Intertoto Cup Group winners. Nevertheless, only one, Auxerre, reach the quarter-finals, where they were eliminated by Lazio.
 Two clubs have managed to win consecutive UEFA Cups/Europa Leagues: Real Madrid in 1985 and 1986, and Sevilla (twice) in 2006 and 2007 and then again in 2014, 2015 and 2016.
 The only countries to have won for three consecutive seasons are Italy (twice) and Spain. Italy: between 1988–89 and 1990–91 (Napoli, Juventus, and Inter Milan the winners) and between 1992–93 and 1994–95 (Juventus, Inter Milan, and Parma). Spain: 2014, 2015 and 2016 (Sevilla)
Entering both the Champions League and/or its qualifying rounds and the UEFA Cup in the same season has now become so common that a separate statistic of all clubs having done so in three or more consecutive seasons may be of interest (the means of entering the UEFA Cup is indicated in the last column in chronological order, G denoting group stage, q denoting qualifying round):

 Several times, winning the UEFA Cup was a club's only chance to qualify for European competition in the next season. A win by such a mid-table (and non-domestic-cup-winning) club then led to an extra place in the UEFA Cup (or an extra place in the UEFA Champions League since 2015) for the country in question. The following clubs managed to save their season by winning the UEFA Cup:
