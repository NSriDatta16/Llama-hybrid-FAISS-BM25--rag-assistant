Live in Tokyo 25th November 2005 is a 2005 (see 2005 in music) album by Underworld.  It is a recording of Underworld's live performance at the Electraglide festival in Tokyo on 25 November 2005.

This limited edition 3-CD set was originally available to order only at the 2005 Electraglide shows in Tokyo and Osaka.  It was shipped a few weeks later to attendees who ordered them at the show. After fulfilling the Electraglide attendee orders, Underworld sold the remainder of the stock directly to dirty.org (now borndirty.org) members via semi-private eBay auctions. There were apparently only 7000 copies of the album made.
