The Moment of Truth is the only studio album by the pop group the Real Milli Vanilli, released in 1991.

History
The Moment of Truth was meant to be the follow-up to Milli Vanilli's first album All or Nothing (repackaged as Girl You Know It's True in the United States). After it was revealed that Rob Pilatus and Fab Morvan had not performed the vocals with which they were credited in Milli Vanilli, the producer Frank Farian formed the group The Real Milli Vanilli, with the actual singers on the recordings, as well as new vocalists Gina Mohammed and Ray Horton. Milli Vanilli's vocalist, Charles Shaw, was unable to record for this album after being paid for his silence regarding his involvement with the first Milli Vanilli album. Most of the lead vocals on The Moment of Truth were performed by Brad Howell, who had performed many of the lead vocals on All or Nothing and Girl You Know It's True. The album also has the rappers Icy Bro on "Hard as Hell" and Tammy T on "Too Late (True Love)".

The album's cover shows Brad Howell, Icy Bro, Ray Horton, Gina Mohammed and John Davis. Its originally proposed title was Keep on Running, the title of the first single released from it. Although The Moment of Truth appeared on its cover (and The 2nd Album at the bottom), Keep on Running still appeared on its spine.

The album was released only in Brazil, Europe, Asia and New Zealand, and reached the top 20 in Germany. The Real Milli Vanilli also released three singles, one of which ("Keep on Running") reached number four on the German charts.

"When I Die", written by  Diane Warren, has been covered by several other artists, including Farian's own project No Mercy. It also appeared on the soundtrack of the Brazilian soap opera Lua Cheia de Amor in 1991 and received radio airplay in Brazil. Another Warren song, "Tell Me Where It Hurts", was covered by the Christian singer Kathy Troccoli and released as a single in 1994.

Seven of the songs from The Moment of Truth were reworked and released under the band name Try 'n' B on its first album, Try 'n' B, with the addition of Tracy Ganser and Kevin Weatherspoon on vocals. The album contained three additional songs: "Ding Dong", "Who Do You Love" and a cover version of Dr. Hook's "Sexy Eyes".

Alternative release: Try 'n' B

In 1992, RCA signed on to rework and re-release the album as the debut of the newly created group Try 'n' B. Because this album received significantly better sales than The Moment of Truth in America, a slightly modified version was also released internationally.
