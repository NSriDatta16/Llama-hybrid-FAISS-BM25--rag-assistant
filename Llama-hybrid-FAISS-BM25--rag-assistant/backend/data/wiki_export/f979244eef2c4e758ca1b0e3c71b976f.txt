The semilunar hiatus is a crescent-shaped/semicircular/curved slit/groove upon the lateral wall of the nasal cavity at the middle nasal meatus. It is bounded (sources differ) either inferiorly/anteriorly by the ethmoid bulla, anteriorly by the uncinate process of ethmoid bone. It leads into the ethmoidal infundibulum; it marks the medial limit of the ethmoidal infundibulum.
