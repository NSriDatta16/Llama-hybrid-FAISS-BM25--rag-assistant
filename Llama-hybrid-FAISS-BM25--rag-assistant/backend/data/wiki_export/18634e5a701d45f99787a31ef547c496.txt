Story
Danny, Sam, and Tucker are preparing a movie night when Undergrowth appears and shakes Fentonworks with an earthquake. Danny is unable to defeat Undergrowth, and heads into the Ghost Zone to search for a way to defeat him. In the Ghost Zone he meets Frostbite, who teaches Danny how to use ice powers.

When Danny returns from the Ghost Zone, Tucker warns him that Undergrowth has kidnapped Sam to turn her into his "plant girl". Danny then fights and defeats the plant-clone of Sam, and carries the real Sam back to safety. Sam reveals that she found Undergrowth's core, and  Danny suggests that they keep the core safe in Walker's Prison. Sam and Tucker decide to accompany Danny in the Ghost Zone with the Fenton Flyer vehicle.

Upon reaching Walker's Prison, the prison inmates bump into Danny and steal the core. Walker bargains with Danny into capturing the escaped inmates for him. During the fight in the prison, the Lunch Lady Ghost and Technus manage to escape. After battling Youngblood's pirate ship, Danny, Sam, and Tucker head back to Amity Park. When they return, Danny is zapped into the Internet by Technus and must battle three of Technus' forms.

Danny manages to escape the Internet and ends up at Casper High. Sam finds him and reveals that the Lunch Lady Ghost has turned Tucker into the Meat Monster. The Lunch Lady Ghost and Undergrowth then team up to create Meat-N-Potatoes. Danny defeat all three of the ghosts to save Amity Park and finally enjoy a movie night with his friends.
