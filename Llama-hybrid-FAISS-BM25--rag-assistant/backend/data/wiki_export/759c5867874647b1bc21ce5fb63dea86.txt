Twenty blocks closer to the ocean, the Santa Monica Steps at 4th Street are a popular set of 189 very steep steps that lead down into the canyon.

Ocean Avenue

Midtown Santa Monica 
Comprising most of the 90404 zip code Midtown Santa Monica stretches from 14th street to Centinela at its westernmost and easternmost extremities, and Wilshire Boulevard to Olympic Boulevard in its north and south.  Alternating between major thoroughfares and quieter residential lanes, Midtown is less congested than many other parts of the city.  Planned on a regular grid, Midtown Santa Monica was once home to a number of picturesque Craftsman houses and brightly painted Victorians, though only occasional examples of these can still be found.  In the early 1940s the first wave of suburbanization overtook this part of the city and many preexisting structures were razed and replaced with tiny square California Bungalows with green lawns and small, private backyards.  In the 1960s a large number of these increasingly dilapidated structures were demolished in favor of four and five unit condominium complexes and apartments.  The easternmost edge of Midtown Santa Monica, often referred to as the "college streets" where Princeton, Harvard, Yale, Stanford, and Berkeley intersect with Wilshire Boulevard, represents one of the city's primary gateways.  Commemorating the spot where the cities of Santa Monica and Los Angeles (Brentwood neighborhood) share a border is the "Wave" a sculpture by Tony De Lap arching over Wilshire Boulevard near Franklin.

Pico District 
Before the 1960s, the neighborhood was much larger and was an important African-American enclave on the Westside, but when the Santa Monica Freeway opened in the 1960s, it resulted in the destruction of many residences and the relocation of a large number of families. Its boundaries are Lincoln Blvd to the west, Centinela Ave to the east, Olympic Ave to the north and Pico Blvd to the south. The Santa Monica Freeway runs through the area with access near both Lincoln Boulevard and Olympic Blvd.  Santa Monica High School and Santa Monica College are both on Pico. Pico Blvd in Santa Monica has traffic lights at nearly every block, as well as local and middle class businesses.

During the era of segregation, Pico was one of the only neighborhoods in Santa Monica where nonwhite residents were permitted to live and own property. This is the most ethnically diverse area of Santa Monica, but this diversity is under threat as the area is rapidly becoming gentrified. However, due to Santa Monica's unusually strong rent control laws, many long-term renters have been able to stay despite rising market prices. While the city of Santa Monica has a very low crime rate compared to surrounding communities, the Pico neighborhood has higher crime rates than the rest of the city. The City of Santa Monica has been accused of ignoring the Pico District in the past, particularly when it came to issues regarding crime and gang activity.

Ocean Park neighborhood 

Located in the southwest corner of Santa Monica, from the beach to Lincoln Boulevard and between Pico Boulevard and the southern city limits, is the Ocean Park neighborhood, also known, together with the northern portion of Venice, as Dogtown. One of the oldest parts of the city, it is home to many styles of buildings typical of the early 20th century, such as craftsman and Victorian style houses and apartment buildings, as well as many midcentury apartment complexes and newer, higher-end homes. The area has a beachy, artsy feel similar in manner to its neighbor Venice Beach. Like Venice, it has a history of being predominantly working and middle class, but has become much wealthier and more expensive since the 1990s.

Ocean Park was originally founded as an independent city with the involvement of Abbot Kinney, and was developed along similar lines. It was originally home to an oceanfront boardwalk and pleasure pier, later developed into Pacific Ocean Park. In the 1950s through the 1970s the entire pier, boardwalk area, and all of the densely developed residential blocks between Neilson Way and the beach were demolished as part of an urban renewal program. Two high-rise apartment towers, along with a few low-rise condominium complexes and a public park, were built in their place.

Many Santa Monica residents come to shop/browse on Main Street, home of many boutiques, bars, and restaurants.  Main Street also hosts a weekly farmer's market on Sundays.  SMASH (an alternative school) and John Muir elementary schools are located in the neighborhood.  Olympic High, an alternative high school, is also located in the area. The neighborhood association is Ocean Park Association.

Sunset Park Neighborhood 
Sunset Park is a residential neighborhood located between Pico Boulevard and the southern city limits and Lincoln Boulevard and eastern city limits.  It is composed primarily of single-family housing.  Most of the homes are small one-story houses built in the 1940s for workers at the Douglas Aircraft Factory. Remodeled or rebuilt homes are upscale.

Sunset Park is part of the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District. Will Rogers and Grant elementary schools and John Adams Middle School are located in the neighborhood.  Santa Monica College, a two-year community college, is also located in Sunset Park.

Santa Monica Airport, one of the busiest single-runway airports in the nation, is located along the southern borders of the neighborhood. The airport will close at the end of 2028.

Clover Park is a large park in the area with recreation facilities. The neighborhood is represented by the Friends of Sunset Park association.

Thoroughfares 
Major east/west thoroughfares in Santa Monica are San Vicente Boulevard, Wilshire Boulevard, Santa Monica Boulevard,  Olympic Boulevard, Pico Boulevard,  and Ocean Park Boulevard. All of these streets are four lanes in width; however, about half of Ocean Park was recently reduced to two lanes in order to accommodate left-turn lanes. Wilshire Blvd and Santa Monica Blvd contain the most traffic. It is fairly easy to travel east/west in Santa Monica.

Traveling north/south in Santa Monica is considerably slower and more difficult. Most north/south streets in Santa Monica end relatively quickly or fail to yield traffic lights at intersections, making travel difficult during rush hour. The major streets are Ocean Avenue and Lincoln Boulevard which goes to Los Angeles International Airport. These two streets are mostly four lanes and considered major thoroughfares. In particular, Lincoln Blvd becomes congested since it is a main route that leads to the Santa Monica Freeway, Venice, Marina del Rey, and the Los Angeles International Airport. A number of smaller residential streets allow north/south travel through Santa Monica. These streets are: 7th Street from Olympic Blvd to the Pacific Coast Highway, 11th Street from San Vicente Blvd to Dewey Street on the border of Venice, 14th Street and 20th Street  from San Vicente Blvd to Ocean Park Blvd, and 26th Street from San Vicente Blvd to Olympic Blvd, where most traffic diverts to Cloverfield Blvd. 17th Street runs from San Vicente Blvd to the entrance of Santa Monica College on Pico Blvd. All of these streets are only two lanes (with the exception of a brief portion of 20th Street). However, all of these streets encounter traffic lights at all intersections, making travel plausible. One alternate route to reach the Santa Monica Freeway going eastbound is to take Cloverfield Blvd, a short four lane street that begins off Santa Monica Boulevard.
