Christophe Soumillon (born 4 June 1981) is a Belgian jockey based in France.

Career
Coming from a racing background, Soumillon is the son of jump jockey Jean-Marc Soumillon. He rode in pony races and left Belgium aged fifteen to go to the racing school in Chantilly, France, where he was then apprenticed to trainer Cédric Boutin.

Soumillon rode his first Group race winner aged eighteen when Berine's Son, trained by André Fabre, won the 2000 Prix de Fontainebleau. The following season he won four Group 1 races, including the Prix du Jockey Club on Anabaa.

Soumillon won the cravache d'or (the golden whip or French champion jockey title) for the first time in 2003 and won his tenth title in 2018.

Although primarily known as a flat jockey, Soumillon has also ridden over hurdles, winning the 2010 Grande Course de Haies d'Auteuil (French Champion Hurdle) on Mandali.

2022 riding suspension
On 30 September 2022 Soumillon was given a 60 day ban for elbowing Rossa Ryan off his horse during the Prix Thomas Bryon at Saint-Cloud. The ban was set to start on 14 October, allowing him to ride in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe on 2 October. On 4 October the racing operation owned by the Aga Khan, citing the elbowing incident, immediately terminated Soumillon's contract as their retainer jockey in France. Soumillon, who will still be permitted to ride the Aga Khan's horses on occasion, later told the Racing Post that he had bridges to rebuild and was determined to show commitment to those that wished to engage his services.

In November 2022 it was revealed that the Gaming unit of the Central Directorate of the Judicial Police, which oversees racing and gambling in France, had requested that Soumillon's suspension be extended to six months, or that his license be withdrawn indefinitely. In their request, the police said that Soumillon's behavior was "voluntary and dangerous," and "a serious risk to the public order within horse racing." Soumillon has been given time to respond, after which the French Ministry of the Interior will make a decision on the Directorate's request.

Personal life 
Soumillon married TV presenter and former beauty queen Sophie Thalmann on 22 July 2006. The couple have three children, daughter Charlie (born September 2005), son Mika (born November 2008) and son Robin (born April 2017).
