Gaming law is the set of rules and regulations that apply to the gaming or gambling industry. Gaming law is not a branch of law in the traditional sense but rather is a collection of several areas of law that include criminal law, regulatory law, constitutional law, administrative law, company law, contract law, and in some jurisdictions, competition law. At common law, gambling requires consideration, chance and prize, legal terms that must be analyzed by gaming lawyers within the context of any gaming operation.

Gaming law is enormously complex. In the United States, it involves federal and state law considerations. In Canada, it involves federal and provincial law considerations, in a variety of legal disciplines.

United States

In the United States, each state has its own laws regarding the regulation or prohibition of gambling. States that permit such gaming usually have a gaming control board established to oversee the regulation of the industry, such as licensing of those employed in the gaming industry. States that permit casinos and similar forms of gaming often have strict zoning regulations to keep such establishments away from schools and residential areas.

Ukraine

Parliament outlawed gambling in 2009 after a May 2009, fire in a gambling hall in Dnipropetrovsk that killed nine people. The Ukrainian parliament passed the law "On Prohibition of Gambling Business in Ukraine" (Gambling Ban Law) banning gambling business and any participation in gambling in Ukraine on May 15. The President of Ukraine Viktor Yushchenko signed the law on June 23 and on June 25 it came into force. The Law On Prohibition of Gambling Business in Ukraine also applied to internet casinos, it did not apply to lotteries. The Parliament legalised gambling again on 14 July 2020, albeit with regulations and age restrictions (minimum age of 22).

Japan

Gaming (including kinds of lottery)  is highly restricted in Japan. Penal Code of Japan 185 - 187 regulates Gamings and lottery and the regulation includes casual gaming within peoples.  Because of this, there have been no legal casino or some kinds of that. Additionally, illegal gaming is one of the sources of income of the Yakuza. However, there are some exception such as official gaming(for example, horse racing), Takarakuji lottery and Pachinko.
