Adolf Dygasiński (March 7, 1839, Niegosławice – June 3, 1902, Grodzisk Mazowiecki) was a Polish novelist, publicist and educator. In Polish literature, he was one of the leading representatives of Naturalism.

Life
During his literary career, Dygasiński wrote forty-two short stories and novels. 
Since 1884 his works were being published in book-form and enjoyed considerable success. 
They were translated into Russian and German. 
In 1891, Dygasiński went on a trip to Brazil on a trail of Polish emigrants from Partitioned Poland. 
He produced a series of letters describing the tragic fate of Polish émigrés in South America. In the following years Dygasiński maintained a position of a tutor and coach for numerous wealthy landowning families. Late in life he settled in Warsaw, where he died on June 6, 1902, and was buried at the local Powązkowski Cemetery.

In his work Dygasiński often focused on topics of rural life and residents of small towns, highlighting the common fate of both, human and animal communities. Some of his most important work include:
