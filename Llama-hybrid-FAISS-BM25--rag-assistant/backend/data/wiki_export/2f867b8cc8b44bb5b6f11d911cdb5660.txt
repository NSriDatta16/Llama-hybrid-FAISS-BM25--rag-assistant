Savannah Dragway was an eighth-mile  dragstrip used by the NHRA located near in Savannah, Georgia. The track opened as a quarter-mile  facility in 1968, but safety concerns and rising insurance costs caused it to convert to the smaller distance in the mid-1980s. They were forced to close down at the end of 2005, this was because a neighbour filed many noise complaints and also because their lease expired.

An eighth-mile track called "Savannah River Dragway" opened in 2006 in Screven County. It is further from Savannah,  northwest of the old Savannah Dragway location.
