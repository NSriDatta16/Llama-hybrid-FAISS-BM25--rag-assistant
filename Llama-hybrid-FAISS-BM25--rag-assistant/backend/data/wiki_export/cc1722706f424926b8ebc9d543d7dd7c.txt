"Why'd You Lie to Me" is a song by American singer Anastacia from her second studio album, Freak of Nature (2001). Written by Anastacia, Damon Sharpe, Greg Lawson, Trey Parker, Damon Butler, and Canela Cox, the song first appeared on the US edition of Anastacia's debut album Not That Kind in March 2001. It was released as the third single from Freak of Nature on September 9, 2002, by Daylight Records and Epic Records. In the United States, the track served as the album's second single.

Critical reception
With a positive review, James Salmon from Yahoo! Music said: "Just when you think she's about to grind to an insipid halt, she snaps out of it with good old fashioned pop rants against the male species ('Why'd You Lie To Me')." Jose Promis from Allmusic compared it to a "Destiny's Child-sounding".

Music video
Directed by Mike Lipscombe and produced by Michael J. Pierce, the music video for "Why'd You Lie to Me" was shot at Raleigh Studios in Los Angeles on July 6–7, 2002. It was later included on Anastacia's first music DVD, The Video Collection. The video is notable for being the first to show the singer without her trademark glasses. Choreography was done by Tina Landon. In June 2010, Anastacia confirmed in her last tour she films a new alternative video of this single and a new music video of "I Thought I Told You That".

Cover versions and media appearances
The song was covered by Operación Triunfo series six finalist Noelia. She sang the song live on May 27, 2008, when the gala show took place. She was nominated by the panel for eviction, but was saved by the teachers. The song is also used as the fanfare to introduce "The Lie of the Day" segment on The Laura Ingraham Radio Show.
