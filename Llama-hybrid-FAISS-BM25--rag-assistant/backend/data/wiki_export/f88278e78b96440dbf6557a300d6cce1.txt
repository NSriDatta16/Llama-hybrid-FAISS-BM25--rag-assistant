, republished as  is a diary of 20th-century Indian philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurti (18951986). Originally published in print in 1982, it was republished under the new title in an extended edition in 2023. The diary, a handwritten journal that eschews the first person, is composed of entries dated in 1973, 1975 and (in the extended edition) 1981. The entries touch on favorite Krishnamurti topics like meditation, the dangerous effects of identification and of conditioned thinking, and the need for radical individual psychological reset. The diary is also known for poetic and nuanced descriptions of nature, and of nature's relationship with human consciousness. The published work is considered one of the very few books Krishnamurti wrote himself.

About the work

Mary Lutyens, authorized biographer and longtime friend of Krishnamurti, writes in Foreword that in  he "suddenly started keeping a journal. Yet elsewhere she states that she had at the time suggested the journal to Krishnamurti. This is affirmed in contemporary notes by Mary Zimbalist, Krishnamurti's personal secretary and close associate; she writes that following Lutyens' suggestion Krishnamurti recounted a strange experience he reputedly had two weeks earlier, and agreed to start the journal. He began writing the next day,  while at Brockwood Park in 

Krishnamurti kept writing (in pencil) almost daily for a period of six weeks, during his stay at Brockwood Park and then while in Rome; he resumed the diary in  in California, committing the last entry there on  at Malibu. These entries comprise the original edition of the published diary; however six years later Krishnamurti wrote additional entries. Zimbalist states he added to the journal in  when he was at Gstaad, Switzerland; he continued writing intermittently after he returned to Brockwood Park later the same month, with the final entry dated . The additions, consisting of 13 new entries in 36 pages, were published in an extended edition 42 years later, 

Lutyens considers the published diary "one of two books K  wrote himself", as almost all known Krishnamurti texts are verbatim or edited transcripts of his talks and discussions, edited collections of his notes, and material he dictated in person or on audiotape. In print, the extended edition contains  most of which are between one and three pages long. Krishnamurti wrote in second or third person, referring to himself in the latter mode exclusively; in a few cases there is an anonymous interlocutor. A typical entry expounds on one or more of Krishnamurti's favorite themes through observations of nature, consciousness, and life that often flow seamlessly into each 

A commentator stated that in this and other diaries "depictions of nature are stunning in their fine detail, suggestive nuance, and variety. The observations about consciousness and about meditation are at one with the teachings as they were articulated to the public." He adds that in the Journal there are no overt references to the reputed experiences called , that permeate the previously published Krishnamurti's Notebook (1976). Instead, in this diary "he psychological observations closely parallel his statements from the public platform, although in a somewhat condensed and, if possible, a more immediate form. Lutyens believes this diary reveals "more about  personally than any of his other work and offers, "only in his  we have these lovely descriptions of
