Burin ( ) is a town on the Burin Peninsula in Placentia Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. The Burin Peninsula is often affectionately nicknamed "The Boot" due to its resemblance to the footwear when seen on a map, with the town of Burin located near the "heel". Burin is approximately 318 km from the capital of St. John's. Settlement in Burin dates to the early 18th century, although documentary evidence indicates that French fishermen had been fishing and exploring the area even earlier.

History 
Burin was settled as a fishing community, with the earliest known evidence of settlement being in 1718. The town was incorporated in 1950, and included Burin North, Ship Cove and Burin Bay. In 1970, the town limits were expanded and now include Collin's Cove, Path End, Bull's Cove, Black Duck Cove, Long Cove, Green Hill, Little Salmonier, Hollett's Farm, Burin Bay Arm, and Salt Pond.

Demographics

Economy 
Until the early 1990s, the local economy was largely still dependent on the fishing industry. The federally imposed cod moratorium (which was instituted in 1992) had a heavy impact on the fishing industry as a whole. One of the main employers on the Burin peninsula was Fishery Products International (FPI), with fish processing plants located in Fortune, Marystown, and the largest in Burin. The processing plant in Burin was converted to a cannabis production facility in 2021.

The tourism sector has grown in the absence of the fishing industry. Museums such as the Heritage House and Old Colony Trust remind people of what life was like in early Burin. The Burin Heritage Days occur in August at the Heritage Museum site, with many locals dressing in period clothing, a plethora of local musicians and dancers who entertain, and a fireworks show to the end the event.

Education 
The school systems in Newfoundland underwent a change from denominational to a fully integrated system in the mid-1990s. Originally, there were two school systems under the denominational set-up — the Roman Catholic (R.C.) School Board and the Integrated School Board. Schools in the R.C. system included St. Patrick's elementary school (K-6) and Father Berney Memorial High School (7-12). The Integrated Schools included Sheen's Hill Elementary, Harfitt Primary, Donald C. Jameson Academy (4-8), and Pearce Regional High School (9-12). The schools of both systems served students from Burin as well as the neighbouring communities of Epworth, Corbin, Mortier, Fox Cove, Frenchman's Cove, and Garnish and Marystown; although Marystown did have two of its own R.C. schools, Sacred Heart Elementary (K-6) and Marystown Central High School (7-12), as well as a Pentecostal School.

With the removal of the denominational school system, each of the schools were combined into one system to provide education for the area. Marystown Central High School, Sacred Heart Elementary, Pearce Junior High and Donald C. Jamieson Academy now remain, with Fr. Berney Memorial housing the school board offices.

Post secondary institutions include three public trade colleges, College of the North Atlantic, Keyin College and Centrac College.
