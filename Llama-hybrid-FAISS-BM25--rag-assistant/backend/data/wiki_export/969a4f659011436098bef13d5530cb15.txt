But the process of finding a new club was delayed. Later, it was reported that the brothers were in talks with Braşov. However, the head coach of Braşov Daniel Isăilă later stated that the transition of the Karmanyans was unlikely to be completed because of the complexity of the negotiations, which reached a standstill. Talks were later made for the brothers to play for Astra Giurgiu, coached by Mihai Stoichiță. But after Stoichiță departed from the club, the talks ended. According to an edition of TotalFootball, because of the long search for a new team, the financial conditions for the Karamyan brothers increased to that of a required minimum of 10,000 euros per month.
