"Ratamahatta" is a song by Brazilian metal band Sepultura. It was the third and final single from the band's 1996 album Roots. It is also the last Sepultura single to feature founding frontman Max Cavalera. The song is amongst the band's best-known and remains a concert staple to this day. A music video was created for the song using stop-motion animation which explores the themes of the song. This video can be found on the VHS Sepultura: We Are What We Are, which was later released on DVD as part of Chaos DVD.

The song features guest appearances from Carlinhos Brown on vocals and then Korn drummer David Silveria on percussion. It is amongst Sepultura's most percussive and tribal songs.

The song also appears in live form on the band's live release Under a Pale Grey Sky.
