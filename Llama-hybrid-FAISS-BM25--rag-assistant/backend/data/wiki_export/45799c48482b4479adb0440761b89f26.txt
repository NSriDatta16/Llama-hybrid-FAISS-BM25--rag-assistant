Cuala GAA club (or Cuala GAC,  ) is a Gaelic Athletic Association club based in Dalkey in the south of County Dublin, Ireland. It fields teams in Dublin GAA competitions. Cuala is primarily based in a sports and social centre in Dalkey, and also has playing facilities in Glenageary, Meadow Vale/Clonkeen Park, Shankill and Sallynoggin.

The club name derives from Cualu or Cuala, an ancient kingdom of Ireland that stretched roughly from the Liffey to Arklow.

History
The club was founded as a result of a merger between Dalkey Mitchels and Cuala Casements in 1974.

The club won consecutive All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championships in 2017 and 2018.

The club replaced the Davy Group of stockbrokers as its jersey sponsor with biotech company Amgen in 2019 as part of a deal that attracted notice outside the area. Huawei sponsors the hurlers.
