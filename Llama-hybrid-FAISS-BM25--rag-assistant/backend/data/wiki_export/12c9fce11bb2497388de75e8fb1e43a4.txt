Joe's storylines included his bad relationship with his mother, being widowed, life as a single parent and a custody battle to keep his child. Joe is deemed a stereotype Australian man and a likable rogue character. Little returned to Neighbours in 2022 to celebrate the show's final episode.

Casting
Actor Mark Little joined the cast of Neighbours in 1988. He took up the offer to play Joe Mangel, after being blacklisted from various work opportunities due to his strong ties to the union and the "overtly political nature" of his solo theatre shows. The role was originally intended to last for three months. Of how he approached the part, Little wrote "I committed myself to the task. And I made the idea more palatable by deciding that I would treat it as a pop art experiment, after all, no one was watching. Little did I know that I would be dabbling with similar themes as Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Like Dr. Frankenstein, I was about to create a pop monster. The wild man, Joe Mangel". Little's contract was later extended.

Development

Characterisation
On Joe's arrival it became apparent that he was nothing like his mother Nell Mangel (Vivean Gray). Joe has been described as an "unreconstructed oaf who likes drinking beer", he is green fingered and loves gardening and also acts brutish. He also has a love for betting and likes to keep up with the status quo. Many of Joe's traits annoyed other residents, with Nell and Dorothy Burke (Maggie Dence) constantly trying to make Joe behave himself and change his ways. He would often clash with his niece Jane Harris (Annie Jones) who also hated Joe's love for loud music, football and beer drinking. When his son Toby (Ben Guerens) came to live with him he had a hard time adjusting to fatherhood and saw it as a chore at first, later he began to realise Toby's clever potential, he became proud and transformed into a good father. Through his relationship with Kerry Bishop (Linda Hartley-Clark), Joe was portrayed as being the complete opposite of her, he remained acting out his blunt and sometimes selfish ways, however, he truly loved her.

Little has branded Joe as a "massive character" within the serial, also stating that viewers still have enormous affection for him due to his storylines. In an interview with the newspaper Derby Telegraph, Little described his persona and links to the British public stating: "He was a single dad, struggling to get along, a bit of a battler. He appealed to the English psyche and became a bit of a folk hero". He also spoke about Joe still representing the old Australian archetype when he returned in 2005. Little described this change stating: "Joe is like one of a dying breed – I don't know if there are really too many Joe Mangels left. He was a genuine, easy bloke that is dying out. He knew the language. He could have been one of the last Australians!"

Departure and returns
In 1991, Little decided to quit the serial when his contract came up for renewal. Network Ten told TV Week that "Mark has been with the show since June 1988 and I think he feels it's time to move on. As with any ongoing drama, it's the nature of the production." Little suffered with typecasting after his departure from the show. He commented, "Joe Mangel was my creation and he rather ungallantly went about stealing my identity in a bizarre case of metaphysical identity theft."

In 2005, Little agreed to reprise his role as Joe in a four-month guest capacity, as part of Neighbours' twentieth anniversary celebrations. Little said that he was not sure if it was a mistake as he felt that Joe no longer fitted in because of Australia's change in culture. The character had changed and Little believed Joe living in the countryside contributed to this. Once "a very suburban" character Joe returns as a "bushie" after living on a cattle station. He added that his character does not blend back into his former lifestyle. In 2008, Little said it was unlikely he would ever return to the show again, describing Joe as "just a fond memory". In 2010, former co-star Janet Andrewartha (who plays Lyn Scully) called for Joe to return for Lyn, also wanting to work with Little again. However, Little gave confirmation that he would not return again because he felt that Joe has "had his time".

On 7 May 2022, Dan Seddon of Digital Spy announced Little had reprised the role for the final episodes of Neighbours following its cancellation. Joe was one of numerous characters reintroduced for the show's end. The "most memorable characters" from each decade were chosen to return and executive producer Jason Herbison explained that it ensured there was "something for everyone as Neighbours draws to a close." The character's return scene airs on 15 July in the UK and 21 July 2022 in Australia. Joe's former father-in-law Harold Bishop (Ian Smith) contacts him via a video call to ask about his relationship with Melanie, who is now engaged to Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney). Harold is worried that Melanie will hurt Toadie's children, like he believes she did Toby and Sky when she left. However, Joe admits that he twisted the truth about her behaviour and that he and the children were lucky to have her around.

Storylines

Backstory
Joe was the youngest child of Nell and Len Mangel (John Lee). In contrast to his studious sister, Amanda (Briony Behets), Joe was laid back and roguish and often disappointed his mother.

17 years later, Joe speaks to Harold on a video call and explains that Melanie, who is marrying Toadie, was a good step mum to Sky and Toby. Joe tells Harold that he and Melanie broke up around his and Kerry's anniversary and he twisted the truth in anger. Joe explains that Sky and Toby stopped talking about Melanie in fear of being yelled at, however at Christmas, they explained how good of a step mum she was. Joe then fist bumps Harold through the screen before hanging up. Joe later sends Toadie and Melanie a video call, congratulating them after their wedding and telling Melanie that he wishes her all the best.

Reception
In 2010 to celebrate Neighbours' 25th anniversary Sky, a British satellite broadcasting company profiled 25 characters who they believed were the most memorable in the series history. Joe is in the list and describing him they brand him as the series' first 'easygoing Aussie' to be featured, stating: "For an Australian soap, Neighbours has surprisingly few blokey blokes. Perhaps that's because few were going to out-bloke Joe Mangel after he left – with a stubby in hand and probably some shrimp on the barbie, Joe was the originally easygoing Aussie. That provided a useful breath of fresh air to all the grown-ups who've tried to make him behave himself over the years, including nan Mrs Mangel, guardian of his son Dorothy, and father-in-law Harold. While not exactly dependable, he stayed on hand to support step-daughter Sky after the plane crash of 2005." Editor of MSN TV, Lorna Cooper branded Joe as one of the legendary characters of the series, despite his short duration. Tony Squires from The Sydney Morning Herald believed that producers should have better developed the on-screen partnership between Joe and Des, commenting "still, shove Des and Joe together and you have something."

Joe became popular in the UK due to his personality. The Peterborough Evening Telegraph brand Joe as the serial's "likeable rogue". Each of the Daily Mirror's columnists were asked to choose their favourite soap opera character, Polly Hudson chose Joe. She cited his "Funny, sweet and ute-obsessed" personality and the comedy moments he provided as her reasons for choosing him. Orange UK agree with Joe's loveable larrikin status adding it was his style and state he is famous for his relationship with Bouncer, referring to it as touching. Sue Heath from The Northern Echo said that commented on his return, opining that he "waltzed back into Erinsborough with a cheery 'Good day, chuck' as though he'd never been away" Joe was placed at number thirty-three on the Huffpost's "35 greatest Neighbours characters of all time" feature. Journalist Adam Beresford described him as a "true blue Aussie bloke" who was the "polar opposite of his uptight estranged mother". He added that Joe was a "unreconstructed beer lover" who "ramped up the comedy element" of the show.
