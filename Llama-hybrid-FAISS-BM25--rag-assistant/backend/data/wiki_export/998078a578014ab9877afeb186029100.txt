Lethbridge School Division is the public school board in Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada.

Size
Lethbridge School Division operates 24 schools covering grades ranging from Pre-Kindergarten  to Grade 12.

Governance
A group of seven elected trustees run the Lethbridge School Division.  They are elected every three years, in the regular municipal election.  In the election, Lethbridge voters can only vote for a trustee to one (not both) of the two major school boards (Lethbridge School Division and the separate Holy Spirit Roman Catholic division).  The public and Catholic systems operate independently of each other, and are both under the direct authority of the provincial government of Alberta. The last election was in October 2021.
