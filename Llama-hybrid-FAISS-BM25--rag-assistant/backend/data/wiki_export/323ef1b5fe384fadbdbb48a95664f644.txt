Clifford E. Brubaker is Dean of the School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences at the University of Pittsburgh. Brubaker is also a professor at that institution and an adjunct professor at both Xian Jiaotong University and Carnegie Mellon University.

Education and career
Clifford E. Brubaker was born on December 23, 1938, in Muncie, Indiana. Brubaker received his Ph.D. degree in Exercise Physiology from the University of Oregon in 1968. Subsequently, in 1971, he became a professor at the University of Virginia, eventually directing its Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center on Wheelchair Mobility. In July 1991, he became Dean of the University of Pittsburgh's School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, where he founded the Department of Rehabilitation Science and Technology. In 1997, he led the school to develop the first multidisciplinary doctoral program in rehabilitation sciences in the United States. In 2002, Brubaker received a Lifetime Achievement "Health Care Hero Award".
