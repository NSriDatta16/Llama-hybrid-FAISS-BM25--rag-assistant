American Inventor was a reality television series based on a competition to be named America's best inventor. It was conceived  by Simon Cowell and the producers of American Idol, and premiered on ABC in March, 2006. It was organized as a competition between inventors nationally, resulting in one overall winner.

Premise

Season 1
Twelve inventors and their products are chosen from a pool of hundreds by four judges.  The 12 semi-finalists are broken down into four groups of three, with each episode focusing on a different group of three.  Each of the twelve semi-finalists in each group receives $50,000 to improve their inventions and competes to become one of the four finalists. The finalists would then work with a dedicated prototype and design company who would help with expert advice and manufacturing assistance. Each group is assigned a judge who would judge their products that they have invented. Each of the four judges would then choose one inventor from their group to compete in the finals, for a total of four finalists. In the show's live finale, the four finalists present a 30-second commercial advertisement for their product, with the home audience voting by phone for the winner.  The winner receives $1,000,000 worth of business support, entrepreneurial counsel, physical resources, and prize money.

Season 2
Instead of 12 finalists receiving $50,000 checks to develop their inventions like in season one, six finalists, one from each of the audition cities of Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, New York, Tampa and Houston, will each receive $50,000 and have one month to develop their inventions. The 6 finalists are narrowed down to three based on the judges' preference. Unlike the first season, the three finalists for voting were declared and were voted on by viewers immediately after the second-to-last show.

Time slot
American Inventor debuted March 16, 2006 at 8:00Â p.m. Eastern Standard Time.  Each subsequent Thursday, it aired at 9 p.m. until the season finale May 18, 2006.  American Inventor aired on ABC and on CH in Canada. The second season began on June 6, 2007, at 9pm on ABC.  It aired on Global in Canada.

Controversy
The makers of the program were accused of modeling American Inventor on a similar program called Million Dollar Idea.

The validity of the claim that the Guardian Angel was invented by Greg Chavez is unclear. This same "invention" was actually a gag product on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on December 16, 1993, the first night Julia Roberts was a guest on the show. Leno used a lighter to trigger a smoke alarm within a Christmas tree which then caused the star on the top of the tree to spray a strong burst of water, putting out any potential fire. Several similar patents have been granted over the years, and Season 1 judge Doug Hall has also called it unoriginal, writing in his blog that he once worked on something similar for a client.
