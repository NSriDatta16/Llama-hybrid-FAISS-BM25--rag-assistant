Andrew Marshall is a journalist and radio DJ from Britain, who has worked for both the BBC and ILR stations. In the 1980s he made shows for Radio Mercury, which included Andrew Marshall Meets The Stars, a Sunday afternoon show with usually an interview with people including one who was famous.

Marshall also presented shows on County Sound in the 1990s and was a regular stand-in presenter for Martin Campbell on his country music show, "Country Plus." After he left Mercury and County Sound, which by this time had merged, he became a freelance journalist. Openly gay, his credits as a writer include "Together Forever?", a book about homosexual relationships.
