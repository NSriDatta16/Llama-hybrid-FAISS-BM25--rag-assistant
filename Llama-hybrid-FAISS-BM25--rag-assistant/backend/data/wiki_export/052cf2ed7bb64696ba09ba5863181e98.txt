This is a list of lakes in Wales, including those created as reservoirs. The names of most lakes in Wales start with the word "Llyn", which is Welsh for "lake". Except where otherwise referenced, all lakes listed here are named on the relevant Ordnance Survey map at 1:25000 scale.

By area
In terms of surface area, the ten largest lakes in Wales are
Bala Lake (Llyn Tegid) — 
Llyn Trawsfynydd — 
Lake Vyrnwy — 
Llyn Brenig — 
Llyn Celyn — 
Llyn Alaw — 
Claerwen Reservoir — 
Clywedog Reservoir — 
Nant-y-moch Reservoir — 
Caban Coch Reservoir — 

All of the above, with the exception of Bala Lake, are reservoirs held back by dams. Bala Lake was the largest natural lake in Wales though its level has been artificially controlled by sluices since about 1804. The largest natural lake in South Wales is Llangorse Lake (Llyn Syfaddan), which is also the second largest natural lake.

By unitary authority

This list of Welsh lakes ordered by unitary authority includes lakes with a surface area of greater than , but excludes those lakes and ponds created as part of an active industrial site (i.e., works ponds) and also excludes service reservoirs used to store drinking water as part of the water supply system. Grid references identify the approximate centre of the lake or the dam in the case of artificial reservoirs. For some lakes the unitary authority boundary passes through a lake; in these cases the lake is represented in the list for each appropriate authority. Known occurrences include Llyn Brenig, Pontsticill Reservoir, Llwyn-on Reservoir, Cantref Reservoir and Dol-y-gaer Reservoir. All occurrences are marked with an asterisk (*).
