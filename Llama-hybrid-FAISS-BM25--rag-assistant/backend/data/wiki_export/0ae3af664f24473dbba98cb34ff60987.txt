History

The station was built as the original terminus of the Sognsvann Line. Construction started in 1933 and the station and line opened on 10 October 1934. The area around the station was originally a recreational area around the lake Sognsvann. At the station there were two cafés, which were demolished in the 1960s to allow for new developments. For decades the station was mostly used to reach recreational areas. The Norwegian School of Sport Sciences took its new campus next to the station into use in 1968, followed by the National Archives in 1978.

During the 1980s, the city decided to connect the four suburban lines west of the city center with the Oslo Metro. The Sognsvann Line was selected as the first line to be upgraded, so the two systems would become compatible. The line was upgraded to metro standard by replacing the overhead wire with a third-rail power supply and installing automatic train protection. For Sognsvann this also meant that the single track was replaced with a double track. From 4 April 1993 trains along the Sognsvann Line were connected to the eastern part of the metro, initially connected with the Østensjø Line.
