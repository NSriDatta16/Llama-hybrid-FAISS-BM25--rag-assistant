L-Għanja tal-Poplu (People's Ode Song Contest) is a popular Maltese song competition first organized by Youth Travel Circle (YTC) on 5 May 1973 at the St. Albert College in Valletta. The founder of YTC is Rev. Maurice Mifsud. Initially the contest had to register as YTC members. From 1987 onward, the contest took a national dimension. The competing songs are sung primarily in Maltese and are written either by the singers themselves or other songwriters. In the 1990s the contest started being transmitted on local television stations. This contest is today organised by the voluntary organisation L-Għanja tal-Poplu and is slso supported by Arts Council Malta.

At present the competition is being organised in mid-summer in Pjazza Teatru Rjal with all the songs being accompanied by the Malta Concert Orchestra.

The main trophy, in rosewood, citrus wood, brass and acrylic was designed by Donald Friggieri in 1987. It is awarded to the singer of the winning song, held for one year and then passed on to the singer of the winning entry the following year.
