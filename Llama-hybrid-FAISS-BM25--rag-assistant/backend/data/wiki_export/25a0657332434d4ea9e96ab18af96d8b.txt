In mathematics, the Milliken–Taylor theorem in combinatorics is a generalization of both Ramsey's theorem and Hindman's theorem. It is named after Keith Milliken and Alan D. Taylor.

Let  denote the set of finite subsets of , and define a partial order on  by α<β if and only if max α<min β. Given a sequence of integers  and , let 

Let  denote the k-element subsets of a set S. The Milliken–Taylor theorem says that for any finite partition , there exist some  and a sequence  such that .

For each , call  an MTk set. Then, alternatively, the Milliken–Taylor theorem asserts that the collection of MTk sets is partition regular for each k.
