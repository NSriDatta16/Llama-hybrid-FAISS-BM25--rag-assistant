History

Ancient history and Middle Ages
Talin is one of the oldest settlements in modern-day Armenia, with ancient foundations dating back to the 2nd millennium BCE(or roughly four thousand years ago). The first reference to the town of Talin was made by Ptolemy during the 2nd century CE. Ptolemy referred to the settlement as Talina; the Hellenized version of the Armenian name of Talin.

Between the 7th and 10th centuries CE, Talin has been constantly mentioned by many historians, either as a big village or a town under the rule of Kamsarakan Armenian noble family, within the Aragatsotn canton of Ayrarat; the 15th province of Greater Armenia.

In 774 CE, Talin has been seized and its population has been ruled by the Arab Muslims. However, the town has been revived with the establishment of the Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia by the end of the 9th century CE.

The religious complex of the Cathedral of Talin was founded during the late 7th century CE, by prince Nerseh Kamsarakan. During the same period, the Dashtadem Fortress was also built by the Kamsarakan princes at the south of the town.

In 1162 CE, Talin has been severely attacked and destroyed by the invading Seljuks. Most of the town's population was either massacred or fell captive to the Seljuk army.

Dashtadem Fortress of Talin played a vital role as a strategic point at the north of Yerevan, during the wars between the Ottomans and Persians.

16th to 19th centuries
In 1514, Talin was occupied by Selim II after the decisive Ottoman victory over the Safavid Persians in the Battle of Chaldiran. The Armenians of Talin started an uprising against the Ottomans, that led to the massacre of the population of the town by the Ottoman forces.

In 1639, based on the Treaty of Zuhab signed between the Ottomans and Persians, Talin became part of the Erivan Khanate under the rule of Safavid Persia. However, under the Persian rule, the town has gradually lost its significance during the 17th and 18th centuries, eventually turning into a tiny village.

During the 1st half of the 19th century, following the Russo-Persian War in 1826–28, and as a result of the Treaty of Turkmenchay, major territories of Eastern Armenia -including Talin- became part of the Russian Empire in 1829. Many Armenian families from Western Armenia, particularly from Kars, Daruynk and Alashkert, migrated to Talin in 1829-30.

Modern history

At the beginning of the 20th century, during the years of the Armenian genocide, many Armenian refuge families arrived in Talin from the Western Armenian cities of Van, Mush, Alashkert and Karin between 1914-1918. In May 1918, Talin was included within the newly founded Republic of Armenia that lasted until December 1920.

Under the Soviet rule, Talin became the administrative centre of talin raion formed in 1930. In 1964, Talin was given the status of an urban-type settlement.

In 1995, the government of independent Armenia reaffirmed the status of Talin as an urban settlement within the Aragatsotn Province.

In 2019 Talin won Armenian title of the "Clean community of the year".
