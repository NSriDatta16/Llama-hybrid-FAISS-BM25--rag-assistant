The Lower Guinean forests also known as the Lower Guinean-Congolian forests, are a region of coastal tropical moist broadleaf forest in West Africa, extending along the eastern coast of the Gulf of Guinea from eastern Benin through Nigeria and Cameroon. The Guinean forests encompass a diverse array of vegetation zones that range from humid coastal forests, freshwater swamp forests (such as those found around the Niger Delta), to arid, semi-deciduous forests further inland, characterized by extended periods of dry weather.

The Guinean Forests Hotspot boasts a plethora of ecological characteristics that make it globally exceptional. Notably, the Niger Delta swamp forests rank as the second-largest swamp forest on the African continent, while the Central African Mangroves represent the largest mangrove expanse in Africa. Moreover, the offshore volcanic islands within the hotspot are remarkable for their substantial levels of unique species, particularly considering their size. Additionally, the hotspot contains the Volta River, one of West Africa's largest rivers, and the delta of the Niger River, the longest and most massive river in the region. Furthermore, the Western Equatorial Crater Lakes ecoregion is among those recognized as globally remarkable.

The Dahomey Gap, a region of savanna and dry forest in Togo and Benin, divides the Lower Guinean forests from the Upper Guinean forests to the west, which extend along the western coast of the Gulf of Guinea from Togo to Liberia and north to Guinea. To the north and northeast, the Lower Guinean forests transition to the drier inland Guinean forest–savanna mosaic and Northern Congolian forest–savanna mosaic and to the southeast are bounded by the Congolian Coastal forests, whose boundary is the Sanaga River in Cameroon. The Lower Guinean forests share many biotic affinities with the Upper Guinean forests. They are collectively known as the Guinean Forests of West Africa, location is Sierra Leone.

The Lower Guinean forests, represent a vital ecological region in West and Central Africa. Stretching along the Gulf of Guinea coastline, these forests encompass parts of Nigeria, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Congo, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and smaller portions of neighboring countries. The Lower Guinean forests are globally recognized as a biodiversity hotspot, characterized by their exceptional ecological significance and remarkable species diversity.

Geographical Features

Tropical Rainforests 
These forests primarily consist of tropical rainforests, characterized by high rainfall, lush vegetation, and a wide variety of plant life. The region's rainfall is relatively evenly distributed throughout the year.

Flora and Fauna 
The Guinean Forests Hotspot is renowned for its abundant and distinctive collection of wildlife. A noteworthy characteristic of the fauna within this region is that numerous endemic species have particularly limited distributions within the hotspot, rendering them highly susceptible to the consequences of deforestation. To illustrate, the Upper Guinea Highlands harbor an exceptionally high concentration of endemic bats and amphibians with constrained habitats, all of which are classified as either Critically Endangered or Endangered.

The Lower Guinean forests are recognized as one of the world's biodiversity hotspots. They are home to a vast array of plant and animal species, many of which are endemic.

Lower Guinean forests are known for their rich botanical diversity, including numerous tree species, epiphytes, orchids, and medicinal plants. The forests support diverse wildlife, including various primates (such as chimpanzees and gorillas), big cats (like leopards and forest elephants), numerous bird species, reptiles, amphibians, and insects.

Around 63 out of the approximately 320 mammal species are unique to this area, and there are also seven exclusive genera, among them is the single-species genus like the Liberian mongoose (Libtnezctis kuhn~, EN). Another example of a one-species genus is the pygmy hippo (Hexaprotodon liberiensis, VU), a charming miniature version of its larger relative, which is found solely in the Guinean forests, with one subspecies residing in Upper Guinea and another in the Niger Delta.

Ecological Significance

Carbon Storage 
These forests play a critical role in sequestering carbon dioxide, helping to mitigate climate change. Their extensive vegetation stores significant amounts of carbon. One of the most pressing global environmental concerns is climate change, primarily driven by the accumulation of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere. The Lower Guinean Forests emerged as a key player in mitigating this phenomenon. These forests boast a remarkable capacity for carbon storage. The extensive and diverse vegetation that thrives within this biome serves as a substantial carbon sink, effectively sequestering carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

In fact, numerous studies and scientific reports have emphasized the importance of these forests in the fight against climate change. Research findings underscore that the Lower Guinean Forests store significant amounts of carbon, serving as a vital buffer against the rising levels of atmospheric CO2. This sequestration function underscores the invaluable role played by these forests in supporting global efforts to reduce the impacts of climate change.

Water Regulation 
The forests regulate water flow, helping to prevent flooding during heavy rains and ensuring a steady supply of freshwater to rivers and streams. The water regulation function of the Lower Guinean Forests is another crucial aspect of their ecological significance. These forests act as natural sponges, absorbing and releasing water in a manner that benefits both the environment and human communities. During periods of heavy rainfall, they play a critical role in preventing flooding by absorbing excess water and regulating its flow. This not only safeguards the ecosystems within the forests but also safeguards human settlements downstream from potential deluges.

However, the forests ensure a consistent supply of freshwater to the numerous rivers and streams that originate within or flow through their territory. This consistent water supply is vital for sustaining the aquatic life and vegetation that depend on these water bodies, ultimately contributing to the well-being of the entire region.

Habitat for Endangered Species 
Several critically endangered species, including the Cross River gorilla and various species of monkeys and birds, inhabit the Lower Guinean forests. The Lower Guinean Forests serve as a refuge for a diverse range of wildlife. Among the most emblematic inhabitants of these forests is also the Cross River gorilla, an elusive and highly endangered primate species. These forests are also home to a plethora of other species, including various monkeys, birds, and numerous plants with unique ecological significance.

The preservation of these forests is, therefore, paramount for the continued survival of these vulnerable species. Conservation efforts in the Lower Guinean Forests are crucial to maintaining the biodiversity of the region and ensuring the protection of these species.

Cultural and Indigenous Importance 
These forests are often home to indigenous communities with rich cultural traditions. The forests provide resources and are central to the way of life of many local people. These forests have been the cradle of diverse cultural traditions, lifestyles, and worldviews that have thrived for generations. The Cultural and Indigenous Importance of the Lower Guinean Forests therefore extends beyond their ecological significance, reflecting a profound connection between the region's indigenous communities and the forest environment.  Understanding and acknowledging this cultural dimension is integral to appreciating the holistic significance of these forests.

Threats and Conservation 
The Guinean Forests Hotspot faces severe threats, being among the world's most endangered forest systems, marked by extensive habitat fragmentation and degradation across the majority of the area.

Deforestation 
The Lower Guinean forests are under threat from deforestation due to logging, agriculture, mining, and infrastructure development. This threatens both biodiversity and carbon storage. While these causes may not be limited to this region, each contributes to the ongoing degradation of this vital ecosystem.

 Commercial Logging: Commercial logging is a major driver of deforestation in the Lower Guinean forests. Valuable timber species are harvested for export and domestic use, leading to a significant loss of forest cover. Documented instances of this include the extraction of valuable hardwoods like mahogany (Swietenia spp.) and sapele (Entandrophragma cylindricum) for international markets. A study by the World Resources Institute (WRI) highlighted the impact of logging in this region, revealing that it accounts for a substantial portion of deforestation.
 Agricultural Expansion: The expansion of agriculture, including slash-and-burn farming, plays a substantial role in forest loss. Local communities clear forested areas to make way for crop cultivation, particularly in areas where subsistence farming is prevalent. Documented instances include cases of cocoa cultivation, oil palm plantations, and subsistence farming practices. A report from the Rainforest Foundation UK documented the expansion of cocoa farming in the Lower Guinean forests and its detrimental impact on the environment.
 Mining Activities: Mining for valuable minerals such as gold and bauxite results in deforestation in the Lower Guinean forests. The extraction of these minerals leads to the clearing of large areas of forest and generates pollution, disrupting local ecosystems. Documented instances include gold mining activities in Ghana and Guinea, which have been widely reported as contributing to deforestation. The Global Forest Watch platform provides data on mining-related deforestation in these regions.
 Infrastructure Development: The construction of roads, highways, and other infrastructure projects often necessitates clearing significant portions of forested land. As human populations continue to grow, there is a growing demand for improved transportation networks, leading to further deforestation. The fragmentation of forest habitats due to infrastructure development can also isolate populations of various species, making it harder for them to thrive and migrate.

Habitat Fragmentation 
Habitat fragmentation is a pressing concern in the Lower Guinean forests, threatening the integrity of this vital ecosystem. The expansion of human activities, including infrastructure development and agricultural expansion, has led to the fragmentation of forest habitats, making it increasingly challenging for wildlife to thrive, disperse, and maintain genetic diversity. This phenomenon is especially relevant to the Lower Guinean forests and has far-reaching ecological consequences which include limiting the ability of wildlife to access necessary resources, find suitable mates, and maintain genetic diversity. Smaller, isolated populations of species face an increased risk of inbreeding and reduced adaptive capacity. Additionally, fragmented habitats are more vulnerable to edge effects, which can include increased predation, invasive species, and altered microclimates. These consequences of habitat fragmentation pose significant challenges to the conservation and long-term sustainability of the Lower Guinean forests.

Illegal Wildlife Trade 
With the pervasive and destructive issue of Poaching and illegal wildlife trade, the Lower Guinean forests faces illicit activities that poses a substantial threat to the region's unique and diverse flora and fauna, including many endangered species. The trade encompasses the illegal capture, sale, and transportation of wildlife, and it primarily targets species for bushmeat and the exotic pet trade.

 Bushmeat Trade: The illegal trade in bushmeat, which involves the hunting and consumption of wild animals for food, is a significant concern in the Lower Guinean forests. It poses a severe threat to numerous species, including primates, duikers, and pangolins. Unsustainable hunting practices, driven by a growing demand for bushmeat, have led to declines in wildlife populations. Local communities often rely on bushmeat as a source of protein, but the commercial bushmeat trade, which caters to urban and international markets, exacerbates the problem. This trade results in overhunting and population decline of various species. Unfortunately, many of these activities remain clandestine and are difficult to monitor and control.
 Exotic Pet Trade: The illegal trade in exotic pets is another concerning facet of wildlife trafficking in the Lower Guinean forests. It targets a wide range of species, including parrots, reptiles, and small mammals, for the global pet trade. These animals are often captured in the wild, often causing harm to their populations. The process of capturing, transporting, and selling these creatures not only threatens their survival but can also introduce invasive species to new regions. The international demand for exotic pets contributes to the persistence of this trade.
 Traditional Medicine and Folklore: The use of wildlife in traditional medicine and cultural practices is a lesser-known but significant driver of illegal wildlife trade in the region. Various animal parts, such as bones, skins, and organs, are sought for their perceived medicinal or spiritual properties. These practices put additional pressure on wildlife populations and further fuel the illegal trade.

Climate Change 
The Lower Guinean forests, like many other critical ecosystems around the world, are increasingly susceptible to the effects of climate change. These forests, known for their high levels of biodiversity and carbon storage, face a range of climate-related challenges that can disrupt their ecological balance and alter their vital functions. Changing rainfall patterns and temperature variations associated with climate change can impact the health and distribution of forest ecosystems.

 Changing Rainfall Patterns: Climate change has led to alterations in rainfall patterns across the Lower Guinean forests. This region typically experiences a tropical climate with distinct wet and dry seasons. However, global warming is contributing to shifts in precipitation patterns, with implications for both flora and fauna. Prolonged dry seasons and more intense rainfall events can disrupt the timing of flowering and fruiting of many plant species, affecting the availability of food resources for wildlife. Changes in rainfall patterns and their impact on local ecosystems emphasize the urgent need for adaptive strategies and conservation efforts.
 Temperature Variations: Rising temperatures are a growing concern in the Lower Guinean forests. Increased temperatures can lead to heat stress in many plant and animal species, particularly those adapted to the relatively stable climate of these forests. Some species may find it challenging to adjust to warmer conditions, and the thermal stress can alter local species composition. Research suggests that rising temperatures in the region may also increase the prevalence of diseases that affect both wildlife and humans, highlighting the interconnectedness of climate change and biodiversity.
 Drought and Forest Health: Drought events, which are becoming more frequent and severe due to climate change, can weaken the resilience of the Lower Guinean forests. Prolonged droughts can result in reduced soil moisture, impacting tree health and potentially leading to increased tree mortality. Such changes can disrupt forest dynamics and the structure of these ecosystems. Additionally, drier conditions may make forests more susceptible to wildfires, which can be particularly destructive in tropical forests.
 Carbon Storage and Climate Mitigation: The Lower Guinean forests play a crucial role in global carbon storage and sequestration. The carbon stored in these forests helps mitigate climate change by reducing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. However, the impacts of climate change, including droughts and heat stress, can compromise the ability of these forests to continue serving as effective carbon sinks. Maintaining the health and resilience of these forests is essential for mitigating climate change at both local and global scales.
