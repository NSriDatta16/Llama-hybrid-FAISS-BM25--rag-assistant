Abdelatif Benazzi (; born 20 August 1968) is a French-Moroccan rugby union player who represented both Morocco and France. He played as a lock or back row forward.

Abdel Benazzi started out with his homeland Morocco, but his ability was quickly spotted by France's selectors. He won his first France cap in 1990 against Australia and went on to make 78 appearances and score nine tries for Les Bleus. He played in three World Cups and was a member of the France team that reached the 1999 Rugby World Cup final. He was twice a Grand Slam winner and led Les Bleus in the 1997 tournament. His last international appearance was on 7 April 2001 against England.

He finished his club career with Saracens in England, retiring in 2003 ahead of his 35th birthday.
