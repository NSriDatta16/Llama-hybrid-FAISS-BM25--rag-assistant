Rune Eriksen (born 13 January 1975) is a Norwegian musician. He is best known as the former guitarist in the black metal band Mayhem under the stage name Blasphemer, which he took from a Sodom song. He joined the band in October 1994, but departed in late 2008. He currently plays in Aura Noir, Earth Electric, and the multinational bands Twilight Of The Gods and Vltimas, the latter a supergroup of sorts with vocalist David Vincent (formerly of Morbid Angel), and drummer Flo Mounier of Cryptopsy. Ironically, Rune and Flo also played together with Steve Tucker (successor of David Vincent in Morbid Angel) for the artist Nader Sadek. Eriksen has also made guest appearances with Absu, NegurÄƒ Bunget, and Root. His former bands and projects are, besides Nader Sadek, Mezzerschmitt, and the Portuguese gothic doom band Ava Inferi. He resides in Portugal.
