Christ for the Nations Institute (CFNI) is the educational arm of the ministry Christ for the Nations, Inc. Founded by Gordon and Freda Lindsay in July 1970, CFNI is an interdenominational charismatic Bible college located in Dallas, Texas.

History
American evangelist Gordon Lindsay and his wife, Freda Lindsay, founded Christ for the Nations Institute (CFNI) in 1970. After Gordon's passing in 1973, Mrs. Lindsay and her family continued operating the institution. The organization has trained more than 33,000 students, reached 120 nations, and assisted native congregations in building more than 12,500 churches all over the world.

Accreditation and affiliation
CFNI is accredited by the International Christian Accrediting Association, a private Christian organization operated under the auspices of Oral Roberts University.

CFNI is a member of the Association of Christian Schools International, is approved by the United States Department of Homeland Security to enroll international students, and has approval from the Department of Veterans Affairs for veteran training.

Christ for the Nations Institute is not state accredited. Until April 21, 2007, it had "applicant status" with the Association for Biblical Higher Education. Applicant status is a pre-membership status granted to colleges that may be able to achieve pre-accreditation candidate status within four years. On April 21, 2007, the board of directors of Christ for the Nations decided to withdraw from pursuing ABHE accreditation. However, CFNI holds articulation agreements, for the purpose of transferring credits, with many accredited Christian universities and Bible colleges. The receiving school always determines credit transferability. Some of these institutions include, Ecclesia College, Southwestern Assemblies of God University, Dallas Baptist University, The King's University, Oral Roberts University, and Regent University.

Athletics
Christ for the Nations Institute has a number of intramural sports teams, some of which include: flag football, basketball, volleyball and soccer.
