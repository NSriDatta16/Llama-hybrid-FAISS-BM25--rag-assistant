MM – Mickey Mouse Mystery Magazine was an Italian monthly comic, published by Disney Italy from May 1999 to March 2001, about Mickey Mouse and his investigation in the city of Anderville.

Overview
The series, a noir story starring Mickey Mouse as the main character and is composed of twelve parts. It is often called MM or MMMM and it is set in Anderville, a chaotic metropolis, modelled on the city of New York City. Anderville is a deceiving city, full of criminals. In this new setting, Mickey Mouse has a hard life, because he has no friends and because the authors wanted to break traditional cliché of his adventures in Mouseton, featured in Italian comic Topolino. Villains are different from Black Pete and even from Phantom Blot, often unsuspected, and even friends act in a rude way toward Mickey Mouse, who often feels disoriented in the big city. These stories were directed to a more adult reader, trying to bring to a new life the "old style Mickey Mouse" of the 1930s and 1940s stories, written and illustrated by Floyd Gottfredson.

Mickey Mouse leaves Mouseton for Anderville, being involved in the case of his missing young friend Sonny Mitchell. To prove his innocence, being mistaken for a criminal, both by Anderville villains and police inspector Jan Clayton, he faces some dangerous situations, running the risk of being killed. He becomes friends with Little Ceaser, a well-respected, and somewhat rude, bartender, and with his friendly customers. He eventually proves his innocence but he is forced to stay in Anderville, waiting for furthermore investigations. He finds out that his friend left him an investigation agency: Mickey Mouse becomes a detective and gets involved in very dangerous events, which led him to act in a more violent way than the usual Mickey Mouse.

The first issue of the series was written by Tito Faraci and illustrated by Giorgio Cavazzano. They created Anderville, through many sketches and decided on a specific range of colors to use for the stories, preferring the dark and cold tones to the light and warm ones.
MM demonstrated the talent of Francesco Artibani and Tito Faraci, main writers of the series, and was a showcase for the talent of some young, at the time, drawers: Silvio Camboni, Corrado Mastantuono, Paolo Mottura, Marco Palazzi, Alessandro Perina, Claudio Sciarrone, Stefano Turconi, Silvia Ziche and Giuseppe Zironi.

There were also two side stories: one featuring the weird journalist Chester Soup, a comical one, and one called Anderville Confidential.
