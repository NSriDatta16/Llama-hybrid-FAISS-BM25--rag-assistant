History 
Wang Xiaochuan was hired by Sohu.com after graduation from Tsinghua University to create a new search engine.

The Sogou search engine was launched on August 3, 2004, and operated as a separate division within Sohu.

Wang Xiaochuan is known as the "Goalie of the East Gate" for the relentless recruitment from Tsinghua. In 2008, Sogou launched the Sogou Browser.

By 2010, search revenue share was under 1%. Wang Xiaochuan flew to meet Jack Ma, founder of Alibaba.com and convinced him of an equity investment.
