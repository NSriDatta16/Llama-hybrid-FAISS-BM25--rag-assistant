Matiari District (, ) is a district in the Pakistani province of Sindh. Located on the left bank of the Indus River, Matiari became an independent district in 30 May  2004 under the military regime of Pervez Musharraf, when Hyderabad was divided into four districts â€” Tando Allahyar, Matiari, Tando Mohammad Khan and Hyderabad.

Etymology

Matiari word is derived from two Sindhi words Mat and yari, which means friendship with earthen water pots.

According to culture, the Main Bus Stop at Matiari Main Road was where a Lady sat in a hut a long time ago. It is where she keeps a mud pot of water. People of Matiari tell the bus conductor "Mat Wari Maai" (Make Stop at Old Women's Hut Where She Keeps Mud Pot of Water). This is apparently why it the district is called Matiari.
