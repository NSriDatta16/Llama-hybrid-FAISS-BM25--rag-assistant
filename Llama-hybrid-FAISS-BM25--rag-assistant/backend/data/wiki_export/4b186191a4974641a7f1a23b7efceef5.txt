Glyn Wise (born 9 January 1988) is a British television personality and Church in Wales minister from Blaenau Ffestiniog, Wales. He is best known for being the runner-up of the seventh series of Big Brother in 2006.

Early life
Wise was born in Blaenau Ffestiniog to an English father and Welsh mother. His first language is Welsh, in which he often spoke to fellow Welsh-speaking Big Brother housemate Imogen Thomas. Big Brother initially told them off for doing this and banned them from doing it on the grounds that "[speaking Welsh] could be considered to be talking in code", despite Wise's protests that "Welsh is a British language". The decision was overturned after backlash from viewers and Welsh language activists. Subtitles were used to translate their conversations.

He attended Ysgol Dyffryn Conwy in Llanrwst, where he was head boy and missed his A-levels due to going on Big Brother. Prior to entering the House, he had hoped to study Welsh at the Bangor University.

In 2003, aged 15, Wise began presenting on a BBC Radio Cymru show called Radio Blaenau. It was broadcast to listeners in Blaenau Ffestiniog every Wednesday evening. Wise later worked as a swimming pool lifeguard and once claimed to have been voted "sexiest lifeguard in North Wales". He entered the House in his lifeguard attire complete with buoyancy aid.

Career after Big Brother

Television and radio
After leaving the Big Brother house, Wise was a guest on The Charlotte Church Show and BBC Two's Ready Steady Cook alongside fellow ex-housemate Jennie Corner. He also made appearances on numerous Welsh television programmes such as  and . In October 2006, Wise became a presenter on S4C's children's slot , joining Alun Williams and Alex Jones on a Halloween-themed set.

Wise was a regular presenter on  from 2006 until 2012.

In May 2007, he launched his book,  (Glyn Wise's Big Year, at the . Edited by Beca Brown, it is autobiographical in nature, with particular emphasis on his year since Big Brother.

Teaching and lecturing
In September 2012, he began working as a Welsh language teacher at Ysgol Gyfun Rhydywaun secondary school in Penywaun. After teaching there for two years, he became a tutor at Cardiff University, where he worked until 2016.

Politics
In July 2015, Wise, a long-time supporter of Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru, was announced as their candidate in Cardiff Central for the 2016 National Assembly for Wales election. He told the Press Association: "I can relate to young people and the issues affecting them very well. Young people deserve more of a voice in politics. Plus, I've always been passionate about my country and wanted the best for Wales – as does Plaid Cymru." Wise finished in fourth place in Cardiff Central at the election in May 2016.

Just three months later, however, he quit Plaid due to the party's support for the European Union. He tweeted, "Decided to leave Plaid Cymru today as we don't share the same vision / direction for our country any more." He pledged his support for the Brexit Party at the 2019 European Parliament election.

Church in Wales
Having been a Christian since attending Sunday school as a child, Wise announced in April 2022 that he was training to become an ordained minister in the Church in Wales. He claimed that moving to China had a big impact. "When I was in Asia, particularly South Korea, I saw that Christianity was growing at a massive scale and whilst I was there I went to church and felt every sermon was basically speaking directly to me," he said. "I wanted to bring the good word back to the UK, well Wales and the Church in Wales, and now I've been fortunate enough to be accepted to go into the ordained ministry - it was a dream come true. Jesus Christ was 33 when he got crucified, and we're the same age so let's go for it."

Wise ran the 2022 London Marathon to raise money for the Salvation Army. He claimed that "helping The Salvation Army to be out there – ready to help people in need – is a great cause".
