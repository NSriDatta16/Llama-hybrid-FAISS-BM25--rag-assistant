Bishop Ireton High School is a Roman Catholic high school located in Alexandria, Virginia, less than one mile from Old Town Alexandria. The school was founded in 1964 by the Oblates of St. Francis de Sales, and named in honor of Peter Leo Ireton, Bishop of Richmond from 1945 to 1958.  The school originally admitted only male students. Bishop Ireton, more commonly known as "BI" or simply "Ireton", became coeducational in 1990 after the closing of sister school, St. Mary's Academy. In 2008, the Oblates withdrew their presence from Ireton and the school is now managed by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Arlington.

The patron of Bishop Ireton High School is St. Francis de Sales, a 16th Century apologist and writer of mystical theology, a Doctor of the Church, and patron saint of writers and journalists.
