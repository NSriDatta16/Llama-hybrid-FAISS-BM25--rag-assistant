Herman Theodore Schneebeli (July 7, 1907 – May 6, 1982) was a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Pennsylvania.

Herman Schneebeli was born in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, to Barbara (née Schneider) and Alfred Schneebeli, both Swiss immigrants. He graduated from Mercersburg Academy in 1926, Dartmouth College in 1930, and Tuck School of Business in 1931. He worked as a commission distributor for Gulf Oil Corporation and an automobile dealer in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. He served as a captain in the United States Army Ordnance Department during World War II from 1942 to 1946.

He was elected as a Republican to the 86th United States Congress, by special election, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of United States Representative Alvin Bush, and was reelected to the eight succeeding Congresses. He was not a candidate for reelection in 1976.

The Herman T. Schneebeli Earth Science Center at Penn State University and the Herman T. Schneebeli Federal Building are named in his honor.
