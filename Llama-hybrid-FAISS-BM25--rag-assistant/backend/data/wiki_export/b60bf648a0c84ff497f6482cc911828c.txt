History 
In 1909, Milo was settled 3 kilometres northeast of its present location when Jens (Jim) and Alete Aasgard moved here from Osseo, WI and built their store and home. The town was named for Milo Munro, first postmaster - his post office was in the Aasgards' store. Nearby, a blacksmith shop and Bank of Hamilton opened. Before 1920, the Village of Milo had a telephone office, butcher, pool hall, community hall, and ice cream parlor.

A new railroad extension into the area did not reach the young community, so in 1924, Milo was moved to the side of the train tracks. Most of the buildings were pulled to the new location. The town hall was too large and was dismantled in sections and rebuilt at its new location. Village status was achieved in 1931.

A World War II Royal Canadian Air Force navigator, Harlo "Terry" Taerum, the son of a Norwegian immigrant, spent his early years on a farm a few kilometers from Milo and attended school in the community. In May 1943, in Operation Chastise, commonly known as the "Dambuster Raid," he navigated the lead Lancaster bomber at very low level, at night, to the primary target, a power dam inside Germany.  He was killed on a later raid in September 1943.

A new community hall was built in 1985 and the curling rink expanded and renovated in 1998. Since 2000, developments along the shores of McGregor Lake have attracted cottagers and vacationers from Calgary.  The original site of the village - the Aasgards' farmstead and store - are now part of Canada's largest comb honey beekeeping farm, owned by Don and Ron Miksha.
