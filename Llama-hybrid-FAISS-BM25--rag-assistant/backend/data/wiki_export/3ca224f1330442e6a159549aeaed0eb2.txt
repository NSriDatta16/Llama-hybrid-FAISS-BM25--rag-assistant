It also reached the top five in Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Spain, and Sweden, as well as number seven in Australia. In the United States, it peaked at number 34 in March 2001, giving the Corrs their only US top-forty hit.

Background and release
"Breathless", a pop song, was written by the Corrs (Andrea, Caroline, Sharon and Jim) and Robert "Mutt" Lange, who also produced the track. The song was released as In Blues first single in June 2000. The CD single includes "Breathless" and two new tracks: "Head in the Air" and "Judy". In the United Kingdom, a CD and cassette single were distributed on 3 July 2000.

Speaking of working with Lange, Andrea said: "We happened to meet up [with Lange], and we both liked what each other does, so we decided to try and write a song together. So we did, and the first song we wrote together was 'Breathless.' It was a beautiful, sunny day when we wrote it," she continued, "and I think that's very much in the song, because it's kind of high impact and driven and sunny and summery and it's a love song. It's about seduction and how when you're falling in love, you're just enticing that person to go one step further. It's good, good fun."

An acoustic version was made for their 2002 live album, VH1 Presents: The Corrs, Live in Dublin. The song was also included on their two compilation albums, Best of The Corrs and Dreams: The Ultimate Corrs Collection.

Reception

Critical response
Critics were divided over "Breathless". Steven McDonald of AllMusic picked the song as one of the best tracks on the album. Mel Roberts of Amazon.com called it "one of the standout tracks" on the album. For Chris Charles of BBC News, the song "chugs along at Blondie pace before petering out into a wailing imitation of Dolores O'Riordan." Entertainment.ie review was mixed, writing that "Even half-decent efforts such as current single 'Breathless' are ruined by the MOR production."

Jane Stevenson of Canadian website Jam! considered "Breathless" "one of the album's weaker songs". Steven Wells of NME was positive, praising "the incredibly beautiful Andrea basically begging you to get on with it and shag her 'breathless'," writing that "Andrea does a fantastic yodel-type thing with her voice." The reviewers from People magazine called the song "saccharine", while Jake C. Taylor of Sputnikmusic named it a "poppy hit". "Breathless" was nominated for the 2001 Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals but lost to Steely Dan's "Cousin Dupree".

Music video

Background
The music video for the song was filmed in the Mojave Desert, California, and at Trona Airport (TRH) in Inyo County on 24 May 2000; it and was directed by Nigel Dick. Two days of on-location filming were required. Both Andrea and Sharon succumbed to heat exhaustion during the two-day shoot and were hospitalized, although they were fine the following day. "We shot the video in the Mojave Desert, just outside Los Angeles," Jim described, "and it was shot by a friend of ours, Nigel Dick. We've worked with him on quite a number of videos. We spent about two days out in the desert sun, and we kind of weren't really prepared for that type of heat."

Synopsis
The video shows the Corrs at a small airstrip performing impromptu inside a hangar in the middle of the desert. They arrive in a Douglas DC-3 airplane (the registration N26MA is clearly visible on the side) and perform the song for an audience of bikers before the final shot shows the DC-3 leaving. There are two cuts of the video. One version was more story-oriented, and shows the Corrs setting up the stage for their show with bikers arriving to see them perform. The second version focused more on a young man, apparently a worker at the airstrip, and his reaction to The Corr sisters as they sing. Both versions were released on their Best of DVD.
