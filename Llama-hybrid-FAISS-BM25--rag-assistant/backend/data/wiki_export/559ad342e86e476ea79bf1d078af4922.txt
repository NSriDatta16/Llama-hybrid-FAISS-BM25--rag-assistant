Charles Raymond Cox (born 10 June 1958) is an Australian former racing driver and motorsports commentator. He was brought up in the Sydney suburb of Gymea.

Racing career

His background is based on four wheels rather than two. His earliest exposure was in Australia in the late 1980s in the Production car-based "Street Sedans", raced on tracks in the Sydney area. He raced in the National Saloon Car Cup in Britain using a Ford Escort RS Cosworth in 1993 and 1994, winning many races and three class championships: British Salon Championship Class A 1993,1994 and British GT Championship Class A 1993 . He also won the Willhire 24 Hour at Snetterton, again in a Ford Escort RS Cosworth, in 1993. For 1995 he moved up to the British Touring Car Championship in a Ford Mondeo for his recently formed Thames Ford Dealers team with sponsorship from the Evening Standard newspaper. He caused a sensation in a wet race early in the season by finishing 5th, although behind both works Fords, choosing the correct tyres and recovering from an early spin. However, a huge barrel-rolling crash at Thruxton left him with concussion, and caused him to miss several races. When he returned it was in a hatchback Mondeo, making him the first driver to race one in the BTCC. He raced occasionally in Sportscars subsequently, as well as some appearances at the Bathurst 1000.
