Switchback is an American music duo (Brian FitzGerald and Martin McCormack) active since 1993. Allmusic describes them as a mix of bluegrass, Americana and traditional Celtic music. 

In 1986, FitzGerald was a mandolin student of Jethro Burns and had already been touring with Clifton Chenier when he met McCormack, an award-winning voice student of Whelma Oshiem at the American Conservatory of Chicago and a member of the Star Search selected band Beyond Blue. They were both chosen by County Kerry composer and concertina master Terrence 'Cuz' Teahan to join his traditional Irish group. Teahan taught FitzGerald and McCormack the old country techniques of Irish musical entertainment, making them one of the last generations to be directly influenced by a master of this musical genre. 

 

By 1988, shortly after Teahan's death, the duo continued his musical legacy by joining forces with banjo great Bert McMahon of Woodford and County Galway & Chicago fiddle legend Mary McDonagh in forming the Wailin' Banshees. Their first album was a commercial success with Chevrolet using one of the songs to promote the Chevy Blazer automobile. Their music eventually reached the ear of Grammy-winning producer Lloyd Maines, who proceeded to produce several albums for the band including "The Fire That Burns", which was selected as one of Performing Songwriter Magazine's top choices for 2003.  Throughout this time, the duo managed a heavy touring schedule, opening for such acts as The Moody Blues, Leon Russell, Lee Greenwood, John Hartford, and Beausoliel. 

 

The duo never forgot their Irish roots as Switchback continues to cultivate a following performing live at concerts and festivals.  Playing in over 200 engagements a year, they have performed at festivals like Stan Rogers Folk Festival in Nova Scotia to the Summer Celebration in Michigan (where they performed for an audience of 15,000). Switchback has shared the stage with such notable Celtic musicians as Cherish the Ladies, Gaelic Storm, Liz Carroll, and John Williams. They tour Ireland annually and frequently performed at the Westport, County Mayo pub owned by The Chieftain's Matt Malloy, who often appears there as well. They have performed at the 3,400-seat Star Plaza Theater in Merrillville, Indiana and the intimate and famous venue, the Bluebird Café of Nashville, Tennessee. 
 
Switchback's music is frequently played on radio stations such as RTÉ Radio One with Pat Kenny in Dublin, Ireland and can also be seen on Public Broadcasting Television stations throughout the United States.
