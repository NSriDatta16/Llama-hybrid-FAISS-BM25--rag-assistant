Here Comes Trouble is the first album by funk metal band Scatterbrain, released in 1990.

The album spent 16 weeks on Billboard's album charts, peaking at #138.

It contains a cover version of Cheech and Chong's "Earache My Eye". The single "Don't Call Me Dude" makes reference to vaudeville routine "Slowly I Turned", and the intro is a parody of Dion's "Runaround Sue".

The follow-up single "Down With the Ship (Slight Return)" features snippets from a number of classic rock and heavy metal songs, as detailed below.

Critical reception
The album's initial reception was generally positive, with reviews noting the quality of the band's vocals and humorous approach to heavy metal. The album proved memorable enough for some music writers that it enjoyed continuing retrospective coverage into the 2000s. Later reviews reflect on the album's quirky and sometimes scattered themes, as well as the quality musicianship. Others believe the album demonstrates that the band should hold a more important place in the history of the genre, in spite of the fact that later offerings failed to reach the level of success enjoyed by Here Comes Trouble.
