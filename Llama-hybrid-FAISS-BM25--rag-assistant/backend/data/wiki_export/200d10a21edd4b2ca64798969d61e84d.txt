Overview

The company's product portfolio includes InsydeH2O BIOS (Insyde Software's implementation of the Intel Platform Innovation Framework for UEFI/EFI), BlinkBoot, a UEFI-based boot loader for enabling Internet of Things devices, and Supervyse, which is a full-featured systems management/BMC firmware for providing out-of-band remote management for server computers.

Insyde Software was formed when it purchased the BIOS assets of SystemSoft Corporation (NASDAQ:SYSF) in October, 1998.  Initially 
Insyde Software was a privately held company that included investments from Intel Pacific Inc., China Development Industrial Bank, Professional Computer Technology Limited (PCT), company management and selected employees. At that time, Insyde Software's management team consisted of Jeremy Wang, Chairman (also the Chairman of PCT); Jonathan Joseph, President (a former founder of SystemSoft); Hansen Liou, the General Manager of Taiwan Operations and Asia-Pacific Sales, and Stephen Gentile, the Vice President of Marketing.

Shortly after the initial investment, the company was introduced by Intel to a new BIOS coding architecture called EFI (now UEFI) and the two companies began working together on it. In 2001, the two companies entered into a joint development agreement and Insyde’s first shipment of the technology occurred in October 2003 as InsydeH2O UEFI BIOS. Since that time, UEFI has become the mainstay of Insyde’s business.

On 23 January 2003, Insyde Software announced its initial public offering on the GreTai Securities Market (GTSM) based in Taipei, Taiwan.
