Me and My Gang is the fourth studio album by the American country music group Rascal Flatts, released on April 4, 2006 by Lyric Street Records. The album became the highest US debut of 2006, with 721,747 units and went double platinum in the first month of release. The album spent three weeks at number one on the Billboard 200 chart. It was the best selling album (not counting High School Musical) and the best selling country album of 2006. It has sold 4.918 million copies in the United States as of the chart dated March 24, 2012 and was certified 5× Platinum. This is the group's first album to be produced by Dann Huff.

The singles released from this album included "What Hurts the Most", which peaked at number one on both the Hot Country Songs and Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks charts. This was followed by the title track (which reached a peak of number 6), and then two number one hits with "My Wish" and "Stand". Later presses of the album also included a cover of Tom Cochrane's "Life Is a Highway" (a cover previously included in the soundtrack to the 2006 Disney/Pixar film Cars) as a bonus track. This cover, though not released to country radio, charted at number 18 on the country charts, overlapping with "My Wish". A video was made for "He Ain't the Leavin' Kind" even though it was never released as a single.
