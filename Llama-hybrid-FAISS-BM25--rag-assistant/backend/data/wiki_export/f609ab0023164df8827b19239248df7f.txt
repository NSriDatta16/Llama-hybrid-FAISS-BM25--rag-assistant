Biography 
Ruditis' first publication was in a Buffy the Vampire Slayer short story collection, which was being edited by a friend. Since then he has published tie-in novels and official guides to many hit television shows such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Charmed, Angel, Queer as Folk, Frasier, The L Word, Star Trek, Roswell, The West Wing, Alias, Prison Break, Bones, The Brady Bunch, The Hardy Boys, The Girls Next Door and Sabrina, The Teenage Witch.

In 2010, he was hired by Zenecscope Entertainment to be the lead writer on Charmed, a comic series based on the television series of the same name. The comic features an all new storyline set after the series' conclusion and has to date been very popular with the first issue selling out in its first three weeks. For Issues 0-3 Ruditis co-authored the series with Zenescope veteran Raven Gregory but from Issue 4 onwards he penned the comics on his own.
