Eva Rothschild RA (born 1971) is an Irish artist based in London.

Eva Rothschild was born in Dublin, Ireland. She received a BA in Fine Art from the University of Ulster, Belfast (1990–93), and an MA in Fine Art from Goldsmiths College, London (1997–99). Her work is predominantly sculptural and she works across a range of materials including aluminium, jesmonite, leather, fabric and perspex. She has a materials based studio practice but also works on major public and outdoor commissions. Her work references the art movements of the 1960s and 1970s, such as Minimalism and is also informed by the contemporary aesthetics of protest and spirituality. In 2014 she was elected Royal Academician.

Rothschild's work has been the subject of institutional solo exhibitions including Australian Centre for Contemporary Art (2018), Dublin City Gallery, the Hugh Lane (2014), Nasher Sculpture Center (2012), The Hepworth Wakefield (2011), South London Gallery (2007), and Kunsthalle Zürich (2004). In 2009 she was awarded the Tate Britain annual Duveens' Commission, for which she produced Cold Corners, a vast rambling geometric sculpture that occupied the length of the neo-classical galleries.

Rothschild's works are held by major public collections including MoMA, New York, Arts Council of England, Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin, Tate, and the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis.

In 2019, she represented Ireland at the 58th Venice Biennale.
