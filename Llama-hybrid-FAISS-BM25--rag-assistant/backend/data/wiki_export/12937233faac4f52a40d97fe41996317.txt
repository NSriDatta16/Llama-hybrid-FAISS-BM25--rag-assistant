History

Camp Blanding was established in 1939 on  as a training facility for the Florida National Guard after its previous training base (Camp Foster) on the St. Johns River near Jacksonville had been taken over by the Navy for Naval Air Station Jacksonville. The new camp was named for Albert H. Blanding, who had been commissioned in the Florida National Guard in 1899, and was then a Major General and Chief of the National Guard Bureau. In 1940, as the threat of war increased and the United States Army was built up, Camp Blanding became a Federal facility housing two infantry divisions plus auxiliary units. Between 1940 and 1943, nine US Army infantry divisions trained at Camp Blanding, including: 1st Infantry Division, 29th Infantry Division, 30th Infantry Division, 31st Infantry Division, 36th Infantry Division, 43rd Infantry Division, 63rd Infantry Division, 66th Infantry Division, and 79th Infantry Division. In 1943, Camp Blanding became an Infantry Replacement Center, training soldiers to be sent to existing infantry divisions as replacements, providing a high percentage of the replacements sent to Army combat units. During WWII more than 800,000 soldiers where trained at Camp Blanding.

The base was a holding center for 343 Japanese, German, and Italian immigrant residents of the United States. A small cemetery is located on the grounds of the former POW camp. In 1946 the actual bodies were removed to the Ft. Benning however the grave markers remain. Additionally five settler era cemeteries are located on Camp Blanding property. Most are not maintained and are heavily overgrown.

At one point during the war, the camp contained the population of the fourth-largest city in Florida. It had 10,000 buildings,  of paved roads, and the largest hospital in the state. It was one of the largest training bases in the country. There were several newspapers published at the camp during the war, which helped provide insights into daily life at the camp, such as The Bulletin, the Bayonet, and the Camp Blanding Report. After the war, Camp Blanding was the headquarters of the Military District of Florida and was commanded by Brigadier General Charles S. Kilburn.

An expeditionary airfield consisting of two gravel runways capable of accommodating C-130 Hercules aircraft was added in the 1970s along with the reactivation of the artillery training range and parachute drop zones.

From 2001 until 2008, Camp Blanding was used by the Southeast Region of the Civil Air Patrol to host their Southeast Region Encampment for cadets. The Florida Wing of Civil Air Patrol continues to use Camp Blanding for their wing-level summer cadet encampments.
