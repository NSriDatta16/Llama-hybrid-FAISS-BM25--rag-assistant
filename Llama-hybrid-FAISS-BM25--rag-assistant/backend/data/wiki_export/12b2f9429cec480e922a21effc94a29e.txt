Undeniably the Whitlams is the second studio album by Australian band The Whitlams, released by Black Yak / Phantom in 1994. Due to popular request, it was re-released in 2001 as Undeniably The Whitlams - Reworked. It is their last album to feature guitarist Stevie Plunder.

Reworked edition

In 2001, Tim Freedman reworked much of the album, dedicating it to the memory of Stevie Plunder and Andy Lewis. Freedman explained that the original recordings and mixings had been rushed, and that these new versions were more comparable to the band's original vision.

Roughly half of the album was left as is, while "Met My Match", "Following My Own Tracks", "1995", "End of Your World" and "Shining" were remixed, often resulting in a marked difference from the originals. As well as this, "I Make Hamburgers" was replaced on the album with its single mix, and two previously unreleased songs, "Why Doesn't Andy?" and "Where Are You?" were included.

Initially, these two new tracks were scarcely anything more than demos, and were eventually fleshed out by Freedman, aided by current Whitlams members Jak Housden and Terepai Richmond.
