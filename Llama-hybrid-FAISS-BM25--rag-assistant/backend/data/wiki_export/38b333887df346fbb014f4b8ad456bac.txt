is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Takeaki Momose. The story takes place in Miami City, which is similar to Miami, Florida, except for several locale changes.  It's mainly about the life of two female Miami City police officers having to stop crimes before they get worse. The setting thus has some similarities to that of the popular TV show Miami Vice.

Characters

Yao is the daughter of one of the richest people in Miami City and seems to ask for her money a lot.  She is part of the Miami City Police and sometimes is unaware of what danger she's in.  She has a love for senseless violence, not to mention a desire to be the center of attention to whatever her whim is.  To her, being on the police is just an excuse to shoot people and blow buildings up.  She just doesn't care about anyone else... except herself and her partner Lu.

She is part of the Miami City Police and is a lot more calm and aware of things than her partner, Yao.  She seems to always be on top of things.  Her father is the Chief of the Miami Police.  One of her hobbies is wealth management, and sometimes whenever Yao's dad would cut her off, Lu would lend Yao money... but at a high rate of interest.  But otherwise, Lu cares about Yao a lot, and although she doesn't show it, often worries about her.

Kaken Masume is a scientist and part of the Miami City Police, but doesn't usually go on missions.  She does come with Yao and Lu in episodes like "The Sea! Bikinis! Ghosts!" and "Princess Nokemono".  Her clothes features a dart gun in her bow tie, helpful for subduing distraught bystanders... or when used by Yao, to knock out the chief so that she could do her grandstanding.

He's the Chief of the Miami City Police and is the father of Lu.  He's a bit tight with money, especially when payday comes at the department.  He also gets a lot of flak about his dated afro hairdo, and would like nothing more than to get rid of Yao.

Believed to be a major player in "the Organization", Nagisa Tojo has been awarded many honors in the past until Yao ruined one of her hugest plans yet.  She now plans to take revenge on Yao, but Yao believes her to be her greatest friend and sometimes Nagisa takes advantage of this to find a way to get rid of Yao.

A freelance bounty hunter.  He refers to himself as a "Messenger of Peace" and travels around with his pet alligator Al.  He runs into Yao and Lu in several episodes of the 13-episode series.  He seems to sometimes get into Yao's personal space, but she usually treats him as some sort of gigolo.

Julio Peacemaker's pint-sized pet alligator.  Originally, Al was a test subject in the Tojo Conglomerate's animal-testing labs until he escaped.  As a result of the experiments, Al possesses human-level intelligence, for which he uses to help out Julio.  He is also very fascinated with panties.

Jii is Yao's assigned bodyguard.  Not much is known about this man: his birthday, country of origin... even his real name.  But whatever, he is a loyal servant to the Sakurakougi family, also serving as a butler, mechanic, even a mercenary.  He also has a side-job as a professional wrestling trainer.
