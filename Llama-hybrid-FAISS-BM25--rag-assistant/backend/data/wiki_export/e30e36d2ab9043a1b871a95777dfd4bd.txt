Saint-François-Xavier () is a station on line 13 of the Paris Métro in the 7th arrondissement. It is named after the nearby Église Saint-François-Xavier, a church dedicated to Saint Francis Xavier (1506–1562), co-founder of the Society of Jesus.

History 
The station opened on 20 December 1923 as part of the original section of line 10 between Invalides and Croix Rouge (a ghost station east of Sèvres - Babylone; it was closed permanently during World War II). On 27 July 1937, as part of a reconfiguration of lines 8, 10, and the old line 14, the section of line 10 between Invalides and Duroc was transferred to become the first section of old line 14, linking Invalides and Porte de Vanves. On 9 November 1976, the old line 14 was merged with line 13 when it was extended from its former southern terminus at Saint-Lazare.

The station's corridors and lighting were renovated as part of the "Renouveau du métro" programme by the RATP on during the 2000s. In 2012, platform screen doors were installed on the platforms, together with eleven other stations on the line in an attempt to increase the average speed of trains and reduce track-related incidents due to the line's heavy traffic.

In 2019, the station was used by 1,701,996 passengers, making it the 266th busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 812,792 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 265th busiest of the Métro network out of 305 stations.

In 2021, the station was used by 1,213,378 passengers, making it the 260th busiest of the Métro network out of 305 stations.
