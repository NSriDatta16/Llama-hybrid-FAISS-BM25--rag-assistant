Thalía is the eighth studio album and second eponymous album by Mexican singer Thalía, released on 21 May 2002, by EMI Latin. The follow-up to her successful sixth studio album, Arrasando (2000), the album sees Thalía collaborating with previous producers Emilio Estéfan, Jr. and Cory Rooney, while working for the first time with Estéfano, Julio C. Reyes and Steve Morales. Thalía incorporates strong elements of pop rock, while also having Latin pop influences. Lyrically, the album touches on themes of self-empowerment and individuality. It also features two covers and a new version of an old Latin classic.

The album received generally positive reviews from music critics, who praised the album and indicating that Thalía has found her sound. Four singles were released from the album: the lead single "Tú y Yo" became a hit in Thalía's music career peaking at number-one on the Billboards Hot Latin Tracks. The second single "No me enseñaste" was another success on the Hot Latin Tracks chart, while the third single "¿A Quién le Importa?" was another top-ten hit on the same chart. The album went straight to number one, spending six consecutive weeks on Billboard'''s Top Latin Album Chart and Top Latin Pop Albums. It also reached the top of the Mexican chart and was certified Gold.

 Background and recording 
In January 2002, Mexican local press reported that Thalía was immersed on the recording process of a new album, which was announced as a "millionaire production" and that it would be released by mid-year. Thalía recorded the album in Miami and New York City, and according to Thalía's spokesperson, the album was going to include pop songs, ballads and some rhythmic parts as well. He claimed: "There will be some surprises. The producers are taking care of every single detail so the album can be perfect. Obviously, Tommy (Mottola) gave her a few orientations, but Thalía has a lot of experience in her job."

In an interview for the newspaper Clarin, Thalía declared that the album was the start of a new phase of expansion that the singer found herself "very productive, evolving, wanting to enjoy it." She also announced that the album was going to have three songs in English, becoming her first to have "a crossover appeal", and that it would be her second self-titled album, the first since her self titled debut album (1990). It was also announced that she was working for the first time with Cory Rooney (who worked with Jennifer Lopez and Destiny's Child), Steve Morales (who produced for Enrique Iglesias) and Estéfano. The singer also worked with previous collaborator Emilio Estéfan, Jr., who launched her into the international market on Amor a la Mexicana (1997).

Estéfano, one of the album's main songwriters, revealed that when the project came into his hands, he was told to write songs in a fresher, more aggressive vein, and he developed a strong rapport with the singer. He claimed: "She surprised me from the beginning. [...] She is far cooler than her TV roles, far nicer and more relaxed, and that's what I wanted to project. I found she had much more of an edge. She's an extremely talented, hard-working girl, and she works with love. I think this will be the most important album of her career. It's a great album." EMI Latin USA president Jorge Pino claimed that Thalía "has such a star quality, and with this album she's found her match. This a deep album - it has five or six singles - the marketing plan is comprehensive, and she's eager to support it to the max."

 Composition Thalía is a collection of ten tracks in Spanish, mostly penned by Colombian songwriter Estéfano, who co-wrote and co-produced several of them with collaborator Julio C. Reyes, and three others in English, which was envisioned as her introduction to that language's market. As noted by Leila Cobo of Billboard, the album "has far more aggressive rock undertones than its namesake's previous material, edgier arrangements that often rely on crunchy guitars, and a generally relaxed feel that belies the nine months of work that went into it." She also stated that Thalía "is a gutsy album, flush with personality and hooks." Joey Guerra noted that lyrically, the album "has a lock on independent-woman anthems," which he said that "[i]t's a familiar ground for Thalia, who explored similar themes on 1997's Amor a la Mexicana and 1999's Arrasando." The opening track, "Tú y Yo", was considered a "guitar-based pop rock track," while "Así Es el Destino" talks about destiny and how two people are meant to be. "En la Fiesta Mando Yo" was considered a dance and ska-tinged track, with accordion accompaniment, about girl-power, while "No me enseñaste" was defined as a sentimental rock ballad that "highlights a voice with range and pathos."

The fifth track, "Y Seguir", is another ballad, and was conceived after a long conversation in which Thalía told Estéfano that in love, one leaves pieces of oneself behind, only to have to turn around, pick those pieces up, and go on." The sixth track "¿A Quién le Importa?" is a cover of Alaska y Dinarama's 1986 hit and lyrically is "a devil-may-care ode to individuality." Thalía commented that the song reflected what she was going through at the time and called it "an anthem of freedom." "Vueltas en el Aire" was named a "glittering [song] destined to fill dance floors," while "Heridas en el Alma" talks about the fear of not overcoming someone. "La Loca" is a "smorgasbord of rock, cumbia, and rap rhythms, having Los Rabanes lead singer Emilio Regueira rapping. The album also features two versions of the song "The Mexican 2002", a remake of the song "The Mexican", one in Spanish and other in English, with the former featuring background vocals by Marc Anthony. It also features a "yearning ballad" in English, "Closer to You", and another cover: a dance version of Dead or Alive's hit "You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)", which was noted for Thalía "purring like a sex kitten." In some editions, a grupera version of "Tú y Yo" featuring Kumbia Kings was included, as well as an acoustic version.

 Critical reception Thalía received generally positive reviews from music critics. AllMusic editor Jason Birchmeier gave the album a four-out-of-five-stars rating, calling it "a buffet of delights -- finely prepared pop songs of all types, each with its own flavor and appeal, some tastier than others, sure, but practically all of them delectable. [...] It's an album that's as much the result of Estéfano's songwriting genius as it is Thalía's unmatched appeal. It does sound a little dated in hindsight -- closely tied to the production trends of its time, too closely perhaps -- but not nearly to the extent of Arrasando. A touchstone Latin pop album, no question, Thalia is also one of Estéfano's crowning achievements." Leila Cobo of Billboard was also positive, noting that on the album, "Thalía brings forth a new sound that aims to be earthier, edgier, and far more rock-driven than her previous, more dulcified pop. That said, Thalía is pop, but of the most satisfactory kind, aided by excellent songs (most written by Estéfano); interesting, organic arrangements; and Thalía's distinctive (if sometimes affected) vocals." Cobo also declared that " she's found her voice and her material." Joey Guerra wrote that "[t]his new set is not as instantly addictive, but it showcases Thalia's continued evolution as an artist. [...] If she keeps it up, we'll all soon be a slave for a new kind of diva."
