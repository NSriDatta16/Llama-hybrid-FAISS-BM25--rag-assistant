Etymology and Onam festival
The name Thrikkakkara is an evolved pronunciation of the word Thiru Kaal Kara, meaning the place of the holy foot. This connects to the tale behind the festival of Onam, by which, this is the place on which Lord Vamana set his foot to push down Mahabali to the 'lower world' Pathalam (also referred to as Suthalam). There is a place named Pathalam about 7Â km from this place in the same district.

Following from the legend of Onam, Thrikkakkara is home for the associated shrine, the Thrikkakara Temple, where the deity enshrined is Vamana. It is one of the very few Vamana temples in India. Thrikkakara temple is considered to be the centre of Onam celebrations worldwide. The festival is largely attended by thousands of people from all religions. The Onam festival is celebrated here in a colourful manner as a festival spanning over ten days. Devotees contribute money for public feasts. A large number of mobile shops make it a trade fair. A notable fireworks show is held towards the end of the celebration.
