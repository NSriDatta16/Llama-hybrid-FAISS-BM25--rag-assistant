The 1966 National Football League draft was held at the Summit Hotel in New York City on Saturday, November 27, 1965.

The expansion Atlanta Falcons were awarded the first pick in each round as well as the final pick in each of the first five rounds.  The first overall selection was Tommy Nobis, a linebacker from Texas. The league also provided the Falcons with an expansion draft six weeks later.

This was the last draft in which the NFL and the AFL selected their players separate of one another. As a result, most players drafted  by teams from both leagues chose to play for the more established NFL, but not all. Similar to 1965, the AFL draft was held on the same day. After the merger agreement in June 1966, a common draft was held in March 1967.
