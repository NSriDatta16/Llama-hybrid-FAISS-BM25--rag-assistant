History 
Winnipeg's history of towers began with the Union Bank Tower (1904), the National Bank Building (1911), and the Hotel Fort Garry in 1913. Buildings in the city remained relatively short in the city until the late 1960s when the city experienced its first skyscraper boom, with the construction of the Richardson Building, Holiday Towers, and Grain Exchange Tower, all being constructed during this time. From 1980 to 1990, Winnipeg witnessed a major expansion of skyscraper and high-rise construction. Many of the city's office towers were completed during this period, such as Canwest Place and the Evergreen Place towers. A 20-year lull in building construction came after this expansion, though Winnipeg has experienced a much smaller second building expansion beginning in the late 2000s and continuing into the present.

The most recent tall building to be constructed in Winnipeg is 300 Main Street, which opened in 2023. The Canadian Museum for Human Rights, which opened in 2014, was the 2nd most recent at  tall. In March of 2021, 300 Main (Artis REIT) became Winnipeg's tallest building during construction, surpassing 201 Portage.
