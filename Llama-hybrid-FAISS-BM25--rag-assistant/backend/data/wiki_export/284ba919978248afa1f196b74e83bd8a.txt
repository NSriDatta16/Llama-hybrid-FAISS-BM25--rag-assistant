Marcelo Ramos Motta (June 27, 1931 – August 26, 1987)  was a Brazilian writer, Thelemite, and member of A∴A∴. He was also known by his magical names of Parzival X°, and Parzival XI°.

Early life
Motta was born at the city of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). Very little is known about his childhood, only that he was born into a family with Swiss-German ancestry and received a very strict education, amplified by his admission at the Military Academy of Rio de Janeiro (Colégio Militar do Rio de Janeiro). His father was a follower of the doctrine of Allan Kardec and his mother was Catholic. At eleven years of age he became interested for the first time in the mysterious "Rosicrucians", after reading Zanoni, the novel by Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton, He also read works by Papus, Blavatsky,  Patanjali, Paracelsus and Arnold Krumm-Heller. He "decided to search for them and to become one of those mysterious Adepts". But his first contact with a self-proclaimed Rosicrucian society, the Brazilian branch of AMORC, did not satisfy him and he started his search for an initiatory school of the sort he found in Arnold Krumm-Heller's novel "Rose-Croix."

His time at the Military Academy of Rio de Janeiro gave him a sense of duty and discipline, which he applied to his occult research. During that time, he became interested in astrology and tarot, among other esoteric topics. Those interests were not very common among his fellow students, but they gave him some knowledge to argue with his philosophy teacher in a debate that became famous for years.

At the age of 17 he made contact with the Fraternitas Rosicruciana Antiqua, Arnold Krumm-Heller's Rosicrucian order, and took his first initiations in 1948. Local political tension impelled him to move to Europe and then to the United States of America. His mission on this voyage, given by the Brazilian leadership of the FRA, was to meet Parsival Krumm-Heller (son of Arnold Krumm-Heller and then legal leader of FRA) and mediate the contacts between the Brazilian group and the international leadership.

Thelema
Motta's first contact with Thelema was through John Symonds' book biography of Aleister Crowley, The Great Beast. Motta saw many connections between the Law of Thelema and parts of his initiations at FRA, but he had never previously heard about Thelema or Aleister Crowley. Furthermore, the book gave him some serious doubts about Crowley's initiations. After asking P. Krumm-Heller about the subject, Motta received from him considerable material about Thelema and Crowley, readings that completely changed Motta's opinion about Crowley and his methods and philosophy. Later, in the USA, P. Krumm-Heller introduced Motta to Karl Germer, leader of Ordo Templi Orientis at that time.

Returning to Brazil in 1962, Motta translated and published Crowley's Liber Aleph and wrote Calling the Children of the Sun, the first Thelemic writing published in Brazil (later this work was suppressed by Motta himself for fear of political repercussions). From this year to 1987, Motta, as a member of A∴A∴ had numerous students under his tutelage.

Karl Germer died in 1962, and in 1969, Grady McMurtry assumed control of O.T.O. based on his letters of "emergency authorization" given to him by Crowley. In 1975, Motta published "The Commentaries of AL", as The Equinox, Volume V, Number 1. This book was published by Samuel Weiser, Inc., and contained commentaries on The Book of The Law written by Aleister Crowley and by Motta himself. He also used this book to announce his claim to be the Outer Head of the Order (O.H.O.) of O.T.O.. This claim was rejected by U.S. court in 1978, when Motta unsuccessfully sued for ownership of Crowley's copyrights. The case was finally rejected on appeal in 1985.

Later years
Motta practiced Asian martial arts, especially Judo and Tae Kwon Do. In 1973 Motta self-produced a movie called "O Judoka", based on a comic book superhero ("The Judo Fighter"). The movie did not recover it's cost, causing him to pay for its debts in the few following years.

He also wrote lyrics for the songs "Tente outra vez", "A maçã", "Eu sou egoista", "Peixuxa" and the title track, "Novo Aeon" by musician Raul Seixas on the album of the same name.

Motta lacked economic stability, moving from job to job and making a living as an English teacher, aided by the help of his followers.

Motta established his version of O.T.O. called Society Ordo Templi Orientis in Brazil and elsewhere. The order never reveals the number of its members but it was significantly smaller than the legally recognized Ordo Templi Orientis. The legally recognized O.T.O. is now headed by a student of Motta's named William Breeze. Motta's pupils included the Brazilian celebrity novelist Paulo Coelho, mathematician and philosopher Gary Costner (Frater P.L.S.), and musician Raul Seixas. He originally bequeathed his succession to the care of three pupils (William Robert Barden, Claudia Canuto de Menezes, and Daniel Ben Stone) on the condition that they agree on a successor. (Deed and Trust, dated October 15, 1984). They failed to do so.

He died on August 26, 1987, in the city of Teresópolis (Brazil) at the age of 56 of myocardial infarction (a heart attack.)

Successors
Claudia Canuto de Menezes remained relatively silent outside of issuing a statement in 2000 appearing to endorse Ray Eales and H.O.O.R.

Daniel Ben Stone did manage to take out some advertisements for S.O.T.O. in the classified section of the Llewellyn New Times and issued a very limited printing of the Oriflamme VI, #6 in hardcover (the only edition to include Motta's commentaries) before fading off.

Barden did succeed in publishing some authorized editions of Motta's work via his Australian branch of S.O.T.O. (operating as the  Parzival XI° O.T.O. Foundation). As well as distributing Motta's other publications, the Parzival XI° O.T.O. Foundation issued five numbers of a journal, "The Journal of Thelemic Scholarship", which reprinted rare Crowley writings and other Thelemic materials. On August 20, 2018 e.v., Barden stepped down from his responsibilities (though retained his title of Supervisor General) and announced a successor to act as "Chief Caretaker of Thelema".  They now distribute Motta's publications under the name "Caretakers of Thelema".

In 1991, Ray Eales (Frater 939) established H.O.O.R. (Holy Order of RaHoorKhuit), an outer Thelemic order, and has published various volumes by Motta under the imprint of H.O.O.R. Publications from Tampa, Florida. H.O.O.R. also began issuing the journal Warriors LVX in 1993; this had reached Vol 11, No 1 by Spring 2004 - its 'Aeonic Centennial edition'.

Following the failure of Canuto, Ben Stone, and Barden to elect a Successor, David Bersson (Frater Sphinx) announced that as an emergency measure he was assuming the role of King in the United States (later proclaiming himself "Frater Superior of the Entire World") and continues to operate a version of S.O.T.O. from Pittsburgh, PA..  Bersson is a prolific writer and has done much to differentiate his "School of Thought" from that of Motta's.

Bersson and Eales endorsed the 1992 publication of "The Equinox VII, #1" by Silver Star Publications (Tampa, FL), and were denounced in the 1991 reprinting of "The Equinox V, #1" by Barden's Parzival XI° O.T.O. Foundation.
