Dylan Lee Howe (born 4 August 1969) is an English drummer, bandleader, session musician and composer. The son of guitarist Steve Howe with whom he has sometimes collaborated, Dylan is also noted for his work with rock band the Blockheads (both before and after the death of singer Ian Dury), in addition to his own work as a jazz bandleader and prolific session work with a variety of musicians. He was also the brother of musician Virgil Howe.

Early life
Howe grew up in Hampstead, London, and is the eldest son of Yes guitarist Steve Howe and his first wife, Patricia Stebbings. His half brother was Virgil Howe.

Named after Dylan Thomas and Bob Dylan, Steve Howe's guitar instrumental "Clap" was written for him.

Howe attended King Alfred School from 1975 to 1986. He began drumming at the age of 10, and although he briefly studied with Bob Armstrong, Bill Bruford, and Jonathan Mover; he is primarily self-taught. During this time, Howe spent a year living with his family in Montreux, Switzerland, for the recording of Yes's Going for the One album. It was during this time he first attended the Montreux Jazz Festival.

When Howe was 13, his parents took him to see Buddy Rich and his big band at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club – he cites this as the moment when he knew that he wanted to become a jazz drummer.

Throughout his teens, Howe played in various groups in North London. His first gigs were at King Alfred School (1981) and University College School (1982). The groups' repertoires mainly consisted of covers of The Clash, David Bowie, Bauhaus and U2 songs, supplemented with original material. Dylan left King Alfred School with three O-level passes in 1986. He worked as a window cleaner and sales assistant in various shops (for Katharine Hamnett and others) until 1988 when he started working as a professional musician.

Howe married music writer Zoë Howe in November 2006.

Career
In 1989, Howe ran nights at (now-defunct) jazz club The Shack on Tisbury Court, Soho and started playing regularly at West End jam session/house band club nights at venues including The Limelight. It was around this time that he joined flautist Philip Bent's group.

Howe was the in-house drummer for weekly club nights in London including 'Songwriters' at The Orange in West Kensington, London, backing many artists including Chaka Khan and Howard Jones. He was also house drummer for Channel Four series "Packing Them In" hosted by Frank Skinner in 1992.
