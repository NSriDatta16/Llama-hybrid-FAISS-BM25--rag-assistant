Gray-Nicolls manufactures and commercialises a wide range of products for cricket equipment, such as bats, batting gloves, balls, pads, athletic shoes, team uniforms, and bags.

History 

The Gray company was founded as H.J. Gray and Sons by H.J. Gray in 1855. This company later began manufacturing cricket bats for leading Cambridge University cricketers such as Ranjitsinjhi and the then Prince of Wales and remained a family business. L.J. Nicolls started manufacturing cricket bats in 1876.

These two manufacturers merged in the early 1940s and thus Gray-Nicolls was formed. After World War II, famous cricket stars such as England Captain Wally Hammond and Australian all-rounder Keith Miller started to use Gray-Nicolls bats.

In 1974 the company introduced the 'scoop' bat, sometimes named as cricket's most famous bat.
