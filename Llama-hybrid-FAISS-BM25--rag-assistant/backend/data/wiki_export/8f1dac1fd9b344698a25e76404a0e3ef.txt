Background

The Stadium was originally commissioned as part of a 5 international-standard stadiums project for Egypt's bid to host the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

Alongside the national team, Alexandria-based side Smouha started to play their home matches on the stadium instead of Alexandria Stadium since 2016; while Al Ahly, Al Ittihad, Al Masry and Zamalek also played some of their home matches their due to different reasons.

Opening
To utilize the new stadium, Egypt chose Borg El Arab stadium to be among the stadiums hosting the 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup. In an inspection tour to check Egypt's readiness, Jack Warner, FIFA Vice-president and head of the inspection delegation, said, "It is a fantastic stadium. It is one of the best in the world". The stadium, however, hosted only one match in that tournament, which was the opening match between Egypt and Trinidad and Tobago as well as the opening ceremony of the competition. FIFA President Sepp Blatter expressed his delight to be at the "fantastic" stadium of Borg El Arab as he watched the visuals and lights show of the opening ceremony.
