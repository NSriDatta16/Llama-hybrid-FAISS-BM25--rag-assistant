Plot
The Lost Grounds erupt into war as kingdom fights kingdom in their search for peace and the secrets of the Dragon King. Intrigues, betrayals, and dramatic confrontations ensue as each kingdom walks the path of war towards what may eventually become world conquest.

Gameplay
Generation of Chaos is a game revolving around the management of a kingdom, expanding not only through military prowess, but also improving the inner workings of the player's kingdom. The game moves between two modes: kingdom management and army battles.

Kingdom management
Kingdom management is viewed from an isometric perspective on a tile-based playing area and allows players to view their kingdom's holdings and the rest of the world, allowing players to track the progress of their enemies. Players can move five units per turn, improve their fortifications and market status of their towns and castles, change surrounding terrain or recruit officers, among other actions.

If players do not position their commanders well, a disaster can strike. For example, if an important commander goes to battle and loses, the game is over. Also, earthquakes can cause calamity within the kingdom, as earthquakes destroy walls and markets, lowering funds and increasing debt.

Army battles
Each unit has a unit type, with certain unit types being either more powerful or much weaker when faced off against certain other types. When two units meet on the map, they engage in a real-time army battle. The perspective is again isometric, with each side usually having a unit commander and 29 soldiers.

The player begins the battle with a certain kind of formation selectable from a list, each one having advantages and disadvantages not only in positioning, but also in stats such as speed. When the battle begins, players can issue commands to their troops such as attacking the enemy, waiting for the enemy army to come to them, or targeting the enemy commander. However, directing an individual within the unit is not possible.

The commander of a unit can make use of skills, which when used often provide healing for one's troops or area of effect attacks against the opposition. Skills use up a unit commander's SP.

In addition to skills, the commander can also use supers. To use supers, the commander's army usually must take damage or directly deal damage with their commander, charging up their super bar, filling it and storing up to three supers. When the player has the opportunity to perform a super, doing so will prompt an attack animation that encompasses the whole screen. Supers have similar functions to skills. Certain important characters actually have cut scenes during their supers, complete with voice acting.

The commander may also bring an item, usually taken from chests in battle or bought from shops. These items' functions range from healing the commander and accompanying troops to lowering the morale of the enemy.
