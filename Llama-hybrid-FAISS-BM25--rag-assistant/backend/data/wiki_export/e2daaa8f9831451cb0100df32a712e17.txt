Club career
Whitley played for San Juan Jabloteh for nine years in the TT Pro League prior to his contract termination in September 2007 after comments by manager Terry Fenwick regarding the player's attendance at practices. Several days later, he was signed by rival club W Connection where he remains to date (as of July 2008). His previous clubs include Superstar Rangers and Vitoria Setubal.

International career
Whitley made his international debut for the Trinidad and Tobago national team (T&T) on 15 November 2005 in a 2006 FIFA World Cup Qualifier against Panama.

He was absent from the national team for all of 2007 along with other World Cup players due to a dispute over bonuses with the Trinidad and Tobago Football Federation. He returned to the national team as captain for a friendly match against El Salvador in March 2008 and has retained the captain's armband for all games since (as of July 2008).
