The 50-Miler Award was established in April 1956, along with the Historic Trails Award.

Requirements

Although the 50-Miler is an individual award, the requirements are performed as a group. Groups may be the troop, team, crew, or an ad hoc group made of members of various units. The trip must be properly planned and may include other opportunities for advancement and recognition.  The group must travel a minimum of  on land and/or water in a minimum of five days.  Travel may be by foot, bicycle, canoe, or boat; pack animals may be used where appropriate.  No travel may involve any motorized vehicle.  The group must also complete ten hours of conservation work.  If ten hours of work cannot be completed on the trail, similar work may be done in the group's home area. Even if the award's requirements are completed at a National Jamboree or High Adventure base, the unit's leader must file an application at their local council's service center.
