In the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game, giants are a collection of very large humanoid creatures based on giants of legend, or in third edition, a "creature type".

Description
Giants are humanoid creatures of great strength and size with a self-involved social focus and are usually presented as the "bad guys" in the game. They "often create their own societies away from the other races". All giants have low-light vision. As a group, they have no other special abilities or immunities. Dwarves have a bonus to their armor class against attacks from creatures of the giant type, due to their experience with fighting these oversized foes.

Creative origins
Giants are based both on the giants from mythology and those appearing in J.R.R. Tolkien's work. Their stone-throwing ability indicates their creative roots in wargaming.

True giants
There are six types of classic "true giant" in the core Dungeons & Dragons game:

Hill giant: Hulking, dimwitted brutes, hill giants are the smallest race of true giant. They dwell in hills and mountain valleys, foraging near-constantly in order to find food. They eat as often as possible and can digest nearly anything (including rotting meat, humanoids, plant material, and occasionally mud). This has allowed them to survive for eons as savages, relying on their own formidable size and strength to defend themselves. They typically equate size with strength, and avoid fights with dragons, other giants, and other creatures larger than themselves. Hill giants commonly have a chaotic neutral alignment.
Stone giant: Reclusive, shy giants who are normally peaceful if left alone. They prefer to dwell in cavern networks underneath mountains. Stone giants have stone-gray skin, gaunt features, and black eyes which give them a stern appearance. Despite their size, they are lithe and graceful, and often throw rocks as means of protecting their home. Artistry ranks highly among the stone giants, and stone carving is esteemed as the greatest of skills. Usually true neutral.
Frost giant: Frost giants are fierce, hardy warriors who dwell in the freezing northern lands, away from normal civilization. They respect only brute strength and skill in battle. Based on rime (frost) giant.  Usually chaotic evil.
Fire giant: Fire giants are master metalworkers with a strong legacy of war. They are dangerous, organized warriors who live in and around volcanos. Based on jötnar such as Surtr.  Usually lawful evil.
Cloud Giant: Proud giants who live extravagant lives high above the world, cloud giants see themselves as superior to all other giant races save the storm giants. They place much value on treasure, not just in the value of the raw materials but of the artistry and beauty of the piece. Usually neutral good or neutral evil.
Storm giant: Isolated, contemplative seers who dwell in isolated, hard-to-reach refuges. They are wise and benevolent unless angered, but wield powerful, lightning-based magic. Usually chaotic good.

Beyond the Monster Manual

Craa'Ghoran Giant: Rare stone giant offshoots created when earth elemental energy warped and twisted their ancestors. They can glide and walk right through stone like Earth Elementals and raise walls of stone from the ground with their supernatural powers. They resemble tanned, bestial and deformed versions of stone giants.
 Desert giant
 Death giant
 Eldritch giant: Powerful scions of arcane lore, these ancient giants spend their years seeking out fragments of knowledge. Though selfish and cruel, they are smart enough to bargain fairly when they must and perceptive enough to know that open conflict distracts them from their studies. They hate Storm Giants, though they are too involved with their pursuit of magical power to bother fighting other creatures. Eldritch Giants resemble burly but serious and wise looking Storm Giants. They have purple skin. This skin is covered with tattoos and runes. Unlike most giants, they are quite good and capable of casting spells and other magic.
Fire Giant Dreadnought: A fire giant that lacks still at smithing and makes up for this with brute strength. They are also known for carrying two spiked "fireshields."
Fog giant
Forest Giant: An elfin giant that is amongst the tallest species of giant.
Frost Giant Everlasting One: An immortal frost giant that achieved immortality by worshiping Vaprak the Destroyer. After worshiping him and receiving dreams from him, they are sent a troll which is to be eaten. After it's eaten entirely, the frost giant gains immortality, strength, and the regenerative ability shared by trolls.
Jungle giant
Mountain Giant: A brute that is amongst the largest species of giant, and loves to squash people under boulders.
Mouth of Grolantor: A hill giant that has been imprisoned and starved by its own kind after becoming sick, which is seen as a divine message by hill giant society.

Phaerlin Giant
Reef giant
Sand giant
Stone Giant Dreamwalker: A stone walker that has gone on a "dream quest" to the surface. Stone giants view the surface akin to a dream because they live their entire lives underground. They're driven mad by their quest to the surface, and gain the ability to magically charm people and turn them into stone.
Storm Giant Quintessent: A storm giant who has achieved immortality by merging themselves with a storm, essentially turning into a never-ending storm. They have greater control over weather than typical storm giants, and are able to fashion wind and lightning into weapons.
Sun Giant: A grim, nomadic desert-dwelling giant that survives by raising livestock.
Wood Giant
Other giants: When turned to life as incarnate constructs, Large sized or larger artificial humanoids, such as golems, are defined as giants.

 Giant-kin 
Giant-kin are large humanoids related to the 'true' giants. The mythology of the Forgotten Realms has it that the mother of all giants, Othea, cheated on her unfaithful husband, Annam, the father of giants, with Ulutiu, a minor deity associated with the Great Glacier. Othea and Ulutiu sired the four giant-kin races: Firbolgs, Verbeegs, Voadkyn, and Fomorians. Othea also conceived the ogre race with Vaprak.

Critical reception
The storm giant was ranked fourth among the ten best high-level 4th Edition monsters by the authors of Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition For Dummies. The authors described the storm giant as being "at the top of the giant world, at least as far as the Monster Manual is concerned", as they are encountered with "hurling thunderbolts from afar, using howling winds to scatter enemies, and fighting with a lightning-edged greatsword when the battle gets up close and personal".

The elder titans, who "stand above giants and possess even more power in terms of their physical and magical capabilities", was ranked among the strongest creatures in the game by Scott Baird from Screen Rant.

Other publishersGiants was published by Mayfair Games in 1987 and gave in-depth descriptions both about giants already known in Advanced Dungeons & Dragons as well as new ones.

The cloud giant, fire giant, frost giant, hill giant, marsh giant, rune giant, stone giant, storm giant, and taiga giant are fully detailed in Paizo Publishing's book Giants Revisited (2012), for use with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game''.
