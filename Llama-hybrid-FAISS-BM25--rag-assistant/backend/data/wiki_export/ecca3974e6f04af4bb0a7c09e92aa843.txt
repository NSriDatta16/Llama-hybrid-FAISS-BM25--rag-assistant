Without You I'm Nothing is the second record released by comedian and singer Sandra Bernhard.

History
The album is a live performance recording that was issued on double-cassette, compact disc and double-vinyl in 1989; it was later re-released on double-compact disc and made available for sale on Bernhard's own website. The re-release included a second disc of bonus material.

Material
The recording features a combination of live music performance and comedy. The recording contains material from Bernhard's one-woman show of the same name, whose motion picture adaptation would arrive three years later.

Bernhard developed the show with Mitch Kaplan, her musical director, and John Boscovich who co-wrote and directed.  In an interview, she was quoted as saying “Almost every night, we went out afterwards, dancing, or hung out on Second Avenue. There were a lot more people on the street. It was just a more accessible, affordable situation back then.”
