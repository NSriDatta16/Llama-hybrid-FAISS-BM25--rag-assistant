Additional notes
While the longest-serving cast member of the Power Rangers franchise, Paul's Farkas "Bulk" Bulkmeier was never an official Power Ranger himself. This was finally rectified during the 2017 web series Power Rangers Hyperforce where Schrier was made the team's yellow ranger. Though a web series rather than a television one, Hyperforce is considered canon by series creators Saban Entertainment, thus finally making Schrier a Ranger in his own right.
