Club career

Zagreb
After one season at senior level in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ibričić left to play for Croatian side NK Zagreb. He established himself as one of the club's best players, and soon attracted interest from bigger clubs in Croatia. He was transferred to Hajduk in 2008 for €1.8 million.

Hajduk Split
In April 2010 Ibričić scored against Dinamo Zagreb, Hajduk's biggest rivals, for the second time in his career. The goal sent Hajduk to the final of the Croatian Cup with a narrow 1–0 aggregate scoreline. He scored again in both the legs of the final and thereby won his first trophy for the club. He finished the 2009–10 season with 17 goals, only behind Davor Vugrinec in the Prva HNL. He was voted the best player in the Croatian League and received the Sportske novosti Yellow Shirt award for the 2009–10 season. This was the first time since 1992 that a Hajduk Split player got the prestigious award. He also won the 2009–10 fans' player of the year award, the Heart of Hajduk.

In late August 2010 he was linked with a possible move to Turkish side Galatasaray. According to media reports, Gaziantepspor offered €6.5 million to Hajduk, but the offer was turned down, with former Hajduk president Joško Svaguša saying that the minimum transfer fee for Ibričić would be in the region of €10 million.

Lokomotiv Moscow
On 13 January 2011, he was transferred to Russian club FC Lokomotiv Moscow for a reported fee of around €7 million. Hajduk will also receive 20% of Ibričić's next transfer sum. He scored his first goal for Lokomotiv from the penalty spot in a league match against FC Krasnodar.
