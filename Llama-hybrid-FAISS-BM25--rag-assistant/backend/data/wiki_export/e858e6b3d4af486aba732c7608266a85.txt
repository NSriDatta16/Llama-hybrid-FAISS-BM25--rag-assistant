Ljutenica, lyutenitsa or lutenica (, , ; lyuto or luto meaning "hot") is a (sometimes spicy) vegetable relish or chutney in Bulgarian, Macedonian and Serbian cuisines.

The ingredients include peppers, aubergines, carrots, garlic, vegetable oil, sugar, salt, and tomatoes. It comes in many varieties: smooth; chunky; with chili peppers or eggplant; and hot or mild.

In recent years, industrial production of ljutenica and ajvar has flourished. Large-scale production of both relishes has popularized them outside the Balkans.
