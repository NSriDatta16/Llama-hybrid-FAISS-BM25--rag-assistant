"Let Me Live" is a 1996 song by Queen, from the album Made in Heaven. Freddie Mercury, Roger Taylor and Brian May share lead vocals, with Mercury singing the first verse, Taylor singing the second verse and bridge, and May singing the last verse. During the choruses, all of the band members sing (except for John Deacon), as well as a background choir, giving it a gospel sound reminiscent of the band's 1976 single "Somebody to Love". The single reached No. 9 in the UK Single Charts, becoming the band's last Top 10 hit in that country.

History
Freddie Mercury stated in an interview that this song was originally recorded with Rod Stewart in 1983. It is rumoured that this song was intended to be on Queen's The Works album in 1984. Some backing lyrics in the version intended for release on Made in Heaven had to be changed due to copyright problems, because it resembled a line from "Piece of My Heart". The first Mexican and Dutch pressings of the album, however, had the original version. The song peaked at No. 9 on the UK singles chart. According to the Queen website, BBC Radio 1 did not playlist this song.
