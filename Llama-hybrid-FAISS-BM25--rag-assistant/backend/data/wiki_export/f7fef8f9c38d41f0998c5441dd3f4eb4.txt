Remake 
Seeing the movie's tremendous success in Poland, two film studios from the United States started negotiations to buy the rights to make an English version of the film: Hollywood Pictures offering $600 000, and 20th Century Studios, $10 000. The rights were sold to Hollywood Pictures who paid half of the many on the spot and agreed to pay the rest after the end of film production. Barry Josephson was planned to be the producer, and Barry Levinson, the director. The original director of Polish film, Juliusz Machulski was planned to be the executive producer. After the poor reception of Wild Wild West made by Josephson and Levinson, two stopped working together, putting aside the possibility of working on the film adaptation. Barry Sonnenfeld was also interested in directing the movie. Jim Carrey and Will Smith were rumored to be considered to portray the main character of the film The film was set to happen in New York City, with the plot revolving around a taxi driver who accidentally got confused for the world-famous hitman. The production was meant to be appropriated into the American market and had different than original, humour. The production of the film was planned to start in 1999 or 2000, however it never happened. In 2007, the studio responsible for the production was disestablished.
