Sophronius III (; 1798 â€“ 3 September 1899) served as Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople from 1863 to 1866. He was elected Greek Patriarch of Alexandria on 30 May 1870. He served there as Sophronius IV until his death on September 3, 1899. He established the Holy Church of the Transfiguration of the Saviour in 1888 in the city of Port Said. His Alexandrian patriarchate was marked by unfair expulsion of Nectarios of Aegina, who was later elevated to sainthood.
