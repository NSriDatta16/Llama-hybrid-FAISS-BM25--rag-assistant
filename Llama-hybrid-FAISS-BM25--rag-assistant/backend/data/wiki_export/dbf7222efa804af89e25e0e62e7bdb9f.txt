WWE Crush Hour is a vehicular combat game published by THQ in 2003 for GameCube and PlayStation 2. An Xbox version was cancelled.

Plot
The plot of the game consists of Vince McMahon ending up having control over all of the television networks, making WWE superstars feature on any TV show or commercial that he wants. His newest project, titled "Crush Hour", is a demolition derby-style show featuring over 30 of the WWE superstars in their own custom cars with guns on them (Primary Weapon), and foreign objects (Optional Weapon) to enhance the destruction of the opponent's vehicles, and a "Special Move" which will inflict significantly more damage than the other aforementioned weapons. WWE Crush Hour also features the audio commentary by Jim Ross.
