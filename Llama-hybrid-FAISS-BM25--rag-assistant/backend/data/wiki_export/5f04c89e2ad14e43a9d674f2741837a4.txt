Joseph Reed Abbey (March 21, 1925 â€“ March 6, 2014) was an American football player and athletic administrator. He played college football for North Texas State, professional football for the Chicago Bears and New York Bulldogs. He served as athletic director at public school systems in Fontana and Chico, California, and at Parkland College. He was inducted into both the National Athletic Directors Hall of Fame and the University of North Texas Athletic Hall of Fame.

Early years and military
Abbey was born in 1925 in Denton, Texas, and attended Denton High School. While in high school, he received three varsity letters in both football and basketball. He served in the Army during World War II.

Football career
After the war, Abbey then played college football at the North Texas State Teachers College (1946-1947). During Abbey's time at North Texas, the team won consecutive Lone Star Conference championships in 1946 and 1947.

In May 1948, Abbey signed a contract to play professional football in the National Football League (NFL) for the Chicago Bears. He appeared in 10 games for the Bears at the end position during the 1948 season. He played some on offense (five receptions for 67 yards), but he gained particular notice for his work as a defensive end. After the 1948 season, Jake Lewis of the Denton Record-Chronicle wrote: Abbey, who will probably go down as one of North Texas all-time stars, has already proved himself in the tough pro game. The big 200-pounder had to beat ut some of the nation's leading ends last year to stay with the talent-loaded  Bears. He went on to become one of George  Halas' most dependable performers . . ."

After the 1948 season, Abbey was released by the Bears after suffering a knee injury. In October 1949, Abbey signed with the New York Bulldogs. He appeared in six games for the Bulldogs and tallied eight receptions for 110 yards.

Later years
After his playing career ended, Abbey worked as a teacher and coach for more than 35 years, including stints with Tarleton State and as the athletic director for school districts in Fontana and Chico, California. He concluded his career with 21 years as athletic director at Parkland College in Champaign, Illinois. He was inducted into the National Athletic Directors Hall of Fame in 1988 and the University of North Texas Athletic Hall of Fame in 2001. Abbey died in 2014.
