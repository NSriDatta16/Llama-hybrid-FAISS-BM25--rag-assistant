The Andhra cricket team is an Indian domestic cricket team representing the South Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. The team's main home ground is ACA-VDCA International Cricket Stadium at Visakhapatnam, while some home matches are also played at Anantapur and Kadapa. C. K. Nayudu was the first captain of the team.

Overview 
The roots of organisation can be traced to the formation of the Guntur Recreation Club in 1951 which was affiliated to the Madras Cricket Association. The Andhra Cricket Association was eventually formed in 1953. C. K. Nayudu was instrumental in the formation of ACA and was its founder president.

Andhra competed in the Ranji Trophy for the first time in the 1953–54 season, captained by Nayudu, who scored the team's first fifty in that match. Andhra has competed in every Ranji Trophy season since, with the exception of 1961–62, when it was absent. It falls under the South Zone of Indian cricket.

After the 2019–20 season Andhra had played 326 first-class matches, with 50 wins, 132 losses and 144 draws. In List A cricket, Andhra had played 148 matches, with 49 wins, 97 losses and two no-results.

Andhra has never featured in a Ranji Trophy final and has therefore never had a chance to participate in the Irani Trophy. In the 2007/08 season Andhra, captained by M. S. K. Prasad, achieved two wins out of six in the Elite Group of the Ranji Trophy, missing out of the semi-finals. In February 2018, they reached the semi-finals of the 2017–18 Vijay Hazare Trophy, the first time the team had got to that stage of the Vijay Hazare Trophy. In 2019-20 Andhra reached the Ranji Trophy quarter-finals, losing to Saurashtra, who went on to win the trophy.
