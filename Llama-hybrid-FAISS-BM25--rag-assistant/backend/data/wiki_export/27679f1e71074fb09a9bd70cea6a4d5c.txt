Adjacent to the site of the school, a general store was built, which was gutted by a fire on August 21, 2007.  By October 2008, however, refurbishment of the Buckhall store had been completed, and it re-opened under new management.

An addition was added onto the original church in 1988, and an even larger addition was completed in April 2007, while still preserving and retaining the older, historic Civil War era church building structure.
