Corey Wayne Brewer (born March 5, 1986) is an American former professional basketball player who serves as a player development coach for the New Orleans Pelicans. He played college basketball for the Florida Gators, winning back-to-back NCAA national championships in 2006 and 2007. He was named Most Outstanding Player of the 2007 NCAA tournament.

In 2007, Brewer was drafted by the Minnesota Timberwolves and went on to have a 13 year NBA career.

Early years
Brewer was born in Portland, Tennessee. He attended Portland High School, where he played high school basketball for the Portland Panthers. As a 6'7 174 lbs senior in the 2003–04 season, Brewer averaged 29.4 points and 12.8 rebounds per game and was named the Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association (TSSAA) Class 2A "Mr.Basketball", McDonald's All American, and a fourth-team Parade All-American.

Considered a four-star recruit by Rivals.com, Brewer was listed as the No. 7 small forward and the No. 31 player in the nation in 2004.

College career
Brewer accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida, where he played for coach Billy Donovan's Florida Gators men's basketball team from 2004 to 2007.  Brewer was one of four key freshman members of Donovan's 2004 recruiting class who would have a dramatic impact on the Gators' fortunes over the next three seasons.  Propelled by the 2004 class, the Gators would win the first three SEC basketball tournament championships in team history (2005, 2006, 2007), and two back-to-back NCAA Tournament national championships (2006, 2007) with the same starting line-up.

Brewer recorded the first triple-double in Gators team history on December 18, 2005, posting 15 points, 10 rebounds and 13 assists (the 13 assists were the most by a Gator since Jason Williams had a team record 17 in 1997).

He was projected by ESPN.com's Chad Ford to be a lottery pick to mid-first-round pick in the 2006 NBA draft if he had entered the draft that year.  However, Brewer, along with teammates Joakim Noah and Al Horford announced at the championship pep rally that they would be returning for their junior seasons in pursuit of their second NCAA Tournament championship.  Following the Gators' second NCAA championship, Brewer chose to enter the NBA draft on April 5, 2007 along with teammates Noah and Horford.
