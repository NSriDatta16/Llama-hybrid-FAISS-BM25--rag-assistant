Oakland Athletics

After being outrighted by the Rangers, McCarthy signed as a free agent with the Oakland Athletics on December 14, 2010, for one year and $1 million. As part of the starting pitcher rotation for the Athletics in 2011, McCarthy strengthened his mechanics and had his most productive major league season, starting 25 games and pitching five complete games. He adapted his pitch repertoire to emphasize two-seam fastballs and cutters, which helped increase his ground-ball percentage and lower his home-run rate while developing control and limiting walks allowed. McCarthy finished the year with the lowest FIP among American League starters. He signed a one-year contract worth $4.275 million with the Athletics for the 2012 season, avoiding salary arbitration.

McCarthy was the Athletics opening day starter for the 2012 season. On September 5, he took a line drive to the head off the bat of Erick Aybar of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.

Personal life
McCarthy is a minority owner of Phoenix Rising FC of the USL Championship. McCarthy was instrumental in getting the name Phoenix Rising approved by the team's board because it sounded like a mixture of a European team name and an American mascot.

Junior Flemmings Incident
Despite prior praise over his support of the LGBT+ community, McCarthy was criticized in 2020 by Outsports writer, Alex Reimer, over his reaction to a homophobia controversy involving the Phoenix Rising FC, where the San Diego Loyal walked off the field in protest and forfeited a match after midfielder Junior Flemmings was accused of using a Jamaican homophobic slur against openly gay Loyal midfielder Collin Martin, which was not heard by the referee or any other player.

McCarthy was accused of questioning the veracity of accusations made against Flemmings, suggesting in a direct message with another Twitter user that the Loyal, who forfeited a match against the Los Angeles Galaxy II in the days prior over the alleged use of a racial slur against a Black Loyal player, wanted to forfeit the match to begin with to continue making a statement on social justice.

In later statements, McCarthy said he was "emotional" in his initial reaction to the incident.
