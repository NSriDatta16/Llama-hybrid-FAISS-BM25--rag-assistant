In Greek mythology, Perses (; ) is the son of the Titan Crius and Eurybia, and thus brother to Astraeus and Pallas. Ancient tradition records very little of Perses other than his marriage and offspring, his role largely being purely genealogical, existing merely to provide a parentage for other, more important figures.

Etymology 
His name is derived from the Ancient Greek word perthō ( – "to sack", "to ravage", "to destroy").

Mythology 
Hesiod describes Perses as "eminent among all men in wisdom." He was wed to Asteria, the daughter of Phoebe and Coeus, with whom he had one child, Hecate, honoured by Zeus above all others as the goddess of magic, crossroads, and witchcraft. He might be the Perses that is the father of Chariclo, the wife of Chiron, in some versions.

He was confused with another Perses (the son of the sun god Helios and Perse), who was made the father of Hecate in some versions.
