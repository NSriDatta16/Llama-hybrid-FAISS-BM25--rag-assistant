History
Osco is first mentioned in 1171 as Hoscho.  In 1237 it was mentioned as Osco.  Golasecca culture (6th century BC) graves have been discovered in Freggio and Brusgnano.  Osco was one of the three Degagne of the Vicinanza of Faido.  This organization was mentioned in the Statute (Statuti) of 1237, one of the oldest documents of its kind in the Alpine region, which involved the organization of pass traffic and maintenance of roads.

The Church of San Maurizio was first mentioned in 1171, but the church's present appearance dates back to 1673.  Until 1602 it was under the authority of the parish church of San Siro in Mairengo.  After that, Osco was an independent parish.

The mule track over the Gotthard pass, led by the southern part of Osco and crossed the Monte Piottino gorge near the old Sust or storage house, which is now only ruins.  After 1550, the Canton of Uri built a new road.  The Cantonal road of 1819 followed the old mule path and was replaced by a tunnel, completed in 1934.

The residents of Osco lived mostly off livestock and alpine pastures in the Bedretto valley (Alp Cruina) on the north side of the Lukmanier pass.  From the mid-19th century onwards, the population decreases rapidly, because of emigration (mostly as cooks, assistants, farmers and hoteliers).  With the construction of second homes, at the beginning of the 20th century, the decline has been only partially stopped.  In 2005, 62% of the population worked in agriculture.

In 2004 voters rejected a merger with Faido and other municipalities of the middle Levantine.
