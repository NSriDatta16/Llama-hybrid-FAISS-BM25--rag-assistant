History 
The West Central Area school district was created in 1993 when the West Central school district of Wendell, Elbow Lake, and Barrett, joined with the Hoffman-Kensington school district due to declining enrollment.  However, consolidation had started long before that. Wendell, Elbow Lake, Barrett, Hoffman and Kensington all used to be their own districts, but kept consolidating with each other until they all finally became one, large district.  Declining enrollment continues to be the district's largest problem today.  Class sizes in the high school are down to around 20 people per class.

Other accomplishments 
The Knights have fielded a national championship qualifying team in the televised Academic Challenge (national).  West Central (Elbow Lake - Barrett- Wendel) was one of the eight inaugural knowledge bowl teams in the state of Minnesota back in 1979. Now almost every district in the state has a knowledge bowl team.
