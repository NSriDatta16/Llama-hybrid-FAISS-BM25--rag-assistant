Career

Los Angeles Police Department 
Zine was a police officer with the Los Angeles Police Department for over 28 years. Councilman Zine is a former Los Angeles Police Department sergeant and a current reserve officer. He worked Valley Traffic Detail and served as liaison for Deputy Chief Mark Kroeker in the aftermath of the 1992 riots. He was honored as officer of the year by the California Highway Patrol. He has been elected three times to the Board of Directors of the Police Protective League, representing the 9,100 rank and file officers.

Civic engagement 
Councilman Zine is a past president and active member of The Executives, a support group of Los Angeles Jewish Health (formerly Los Angeles Jewish Home).

Elections 
Zine was elected to represent the 3rd District of the Los Angeles City Council in 2001. He was re-elected in 2005 and 2009, but city term limits prevented him running for a fourth term.

Tenure 
In February 2008, Zine proposed an anti-paparazzi "Personal Safety Law" for Los Angeles to ensure a safety zone for celebrities against photographers. The measure was in direct response to several incidents in which celebrities were hindered from entering medical facilities or caught in pursuits with paparazzi.

Zine was one of two Republican Party members of the City Council until he changed his registration to Decline to State in 2011.  The Los Angeles Times reported "He said he did so because he's tired of the 'gridlock' of partisan politics and because his liberal positions on gay marriage and other social issues are out of line with traditional Republican views."

Post-Council career

2013 Los Angeles City Controller election 
Zine announced his candidacy for the position of Los Angeles City Controller in July 2011, following his City Council predecessor, Laura N. Chick, who served as City Controller from 2001 to 2009.  In a primary election field of six candidates, Zine placed second, trailing Ron Galperin, an attorney and businessman who had run for elected City offices unsuccessfully in the past.

In 2018 Zine started and two weeks later halted a campaign for State Assembly in a Special Election to replace Matt Dababneh in California Assembly District 45.
"I will be announcing shortly a great opportunity that has come my way at the professional level, and I would like to thank my supporters, especially those from the 3rd Los Angeles Council District," Zine said in a two-paragraph statement quoted by the Daily News. Zine garnered 7.7% of the vote.

Personal life 
Zine is divorced with two sons. Zine was criticized during his time on the Los Angeles City Council for failing to recuse himself from votes that conflicted with his romantic relationship with lobbyist Veronica Becerra.
