Lochluichart railway station is a railway station on the Kyle of Lochalsh Line, serving the village of Lochluichart in the north of Scotland. The station is located at the north edge of Loch Luichart,  from , between Garve and Achanalt. ScotRail, who manage the station, operate all services.

History 
The station was opened as Lochluichart High by the Dingwall and Skye Railway on 1 August 1871 as a private station for Lady Ashburton on the Lochluichart Estate. It became a public station by 1887.

In 1949 Lochluichart was planned to be relocated to allow the flooding of the area by the Glascarnoch-Luichart-Torr Achilty hydroelectric scheme. On 3 May 1954 a new station was opened as Lochluichart as a result of a hydro electric scheme raising the level of Loch Luichart, constructed of red sandstone. The deviation required about  on stone-pitched embankments and in rock cuttings, a  bridge over the River Conon and a  bridge.

Facilities 

Facilities are incredibly basic, comprising just a shelter, a help point and a small car park. The station is step-free. As there are no facilities to purchase tickets, passengers must buy one in advance, or from the guard on the train.

Services
Four trains each way call (on request) on weekdays/Saturdays and one each way all year on Sundays, plus a second from May to late September only.
