Sandycove and Glasthule railway station () serves the suburban areas of Sandycove (on the coast) and Glasthule (just inland) in Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown, Ireland.

The building is on a bridge as the rail line is in a cutting. Because of the station's altitude at sea level and the consequent moisture content of the earth, the track at, and surrounding, this station is laid on concrete rather than wooden sleepers.

The ticket office is open between 05:45-00:15 AM, Monday to Sunday.

History
The station opened on 11 October 1855 as Kingstown & Sandycove, renamed Sandycove in 1861 and Sandycove & Glasthule in 1967. The station was electrified in 1983 with the arrival of DART services.
