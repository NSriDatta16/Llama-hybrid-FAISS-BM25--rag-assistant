The chain started as a market stand in the Downingtown, Pennsylvania, Farmer's Market in 1988. A second location opened in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania at the Broad Street Market in 1988 before franchising. The franchise began when a store location opened at Saturday's Market in Middletown, Pennsylvania.
