During his two years as State Secretary, Locke brokered a preference deal between the ALP and the Family First Party, helping to elect Family First Steve Fielding as Senator ahead of the  Greens, which allowed the Coalition to form an  Upper House majority. He resigned from the State Secretary position in April 2005 amidst factional infighting and in protest of a branch stacking controversy.
