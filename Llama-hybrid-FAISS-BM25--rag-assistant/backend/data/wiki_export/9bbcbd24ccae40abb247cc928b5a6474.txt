Hugh II (born c. 910-915 - died 967), called Carus (Latin for the Kind), was the second Lord of Lusignan, the son and successor of Hugh I Venator. According to the Chronicle of Saint-Maixent, he built the castle at Lusignan.  Hugh III Albus, who emerges from historical obscurity in the next generation, was probably his son.
