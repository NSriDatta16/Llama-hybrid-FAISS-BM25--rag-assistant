History 
The village was first mentioned in 1578 as "Graefdyeck ofte Vuylen Graft", and means "dike on (de Vuylen) Graft River". West- has been added to distinguish from Oost-Graftdijk. West-Graftdijk developed on the former island  in the second half of the 16th century after a dike was built around the lake.

The Dutch Reformed church is an aisleless church with wooden tower which was built on a terp (artificial living hill) in 1651. The church was extensively modified in 1792. West-Graftdijk was home to 465 people in 1840.
