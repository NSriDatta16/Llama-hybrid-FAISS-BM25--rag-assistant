Alice Johnson (born 1860, died New York City, November 25, 1914) was a Broadway actress and singer, active at the beginning of the 20th century. She began her career in the chorus in light opera. She later became a member of the Murray Hill Theatre Stock Company. In a single season she was seen in "no less than thirty roles running the entire gamut of the modern stage." The company was founded by Henry V. Donnelly (1862–1910). The company gave two performances daily and changed the play each week. Alice played everything from Lady Macbeth to Peggy in A Tin Soldier by Temple Bailey. 

She was also the leading actress in the Frawley Company, a stock company founded by T. Daniel Frawley in San Francisco, when it was at the zenith of its popularity. She was married to Benjamin Franklin "Frank" Butler, the son of Colonel George Harris Butler and actress Rose Eytinge, until his untimely death in 1904 at the age of thirty-three.

She is buried in the Oak Hill Cemetery in Washington, D.C.
