Murrayfield Wanderers Football Club is a rugby union side based in Edinburgh, Scotland, founded by the merger of Edinburgh Wanderers and Murrayfield RFC in 1997.

Beginnings

The club's roots were based on two clubs; Edinburgh Wanderers and Murrayfield RFC. Edinburgh Wanderers was the elder of the two clubs.

For the history of these clubs see:

Edinburgh Wanderers FC dated from 1868. Murrayfield RFC dates from 1971.  A merger was proposed, and to facilitate this the Wanderers renamed in 1997, to allow the Murrayfield club to join in a merger.

As part of the merger there was notable restructuring. The Scotman newspaper reporting: "after Murrayfield RFC and Edinburgh Wanderers FC merged in 1997, the old clubhouse on Corstorphine Road was sold and the £300,000 proceeds invested in the new pavilion next to the main stadium. Public sports grants of £125,000 and £165,000 were made on the basis of a wider public benefit."

Both clubs brought together a long history of rugby excellence which can trace its roots back to 1868 when the Edinburgh Wanderers Football Club was formed. Murrayfield RFC itself was borne of a prior merger when Kenmore RFC, Bruntsfield RFC and County Rovers RFC merged to form that club. Kenmore RFC dated from 1916, Bruntsfield even earlier, a 2nd XV extant in 1907, County Rovers extant after the Second World War.

The club celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2018, on the basis of Edinburgh Wanderers history, the earliest of its merged component sides.

The team currently compete in  and play their matches in Roseburn Park, Edinburgh.
