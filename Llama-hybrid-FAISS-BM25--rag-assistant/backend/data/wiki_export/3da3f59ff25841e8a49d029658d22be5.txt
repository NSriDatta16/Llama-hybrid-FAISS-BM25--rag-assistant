In the theory of algebraic groups, a Cartan subgroup of a connected linear algebraic group  over a (not necessarily algebraically closed) field  is the centralizer of a maximal torus. Cartan subgroups are smooth (equivalently reduced), connected and nilpotent. If  is algebraically closed, they are all conjugate to each other. 

Notice that in the context of algebraic groups a torus is an algebraic group 
such that the base extension  (where  is the algebraic closure of ) is isomorphic to the product of a finite number of copies of the . Maximal such subgroups have in the theory of algebraic groups a role that is similar to that of maximal tori in the theory of Lie groups.

If  is reductive (in particular, if it is semi-simple), then a torus is maximal if and only if it is its own centraliser  and thus Cartan subgroups of  are precisely the maximal tori.

Example 
The general linear groups  are reductive. The diagonal subgroup is clearly a torus (indeed a split torus, since it is product of n copies of  already before any base extension), and it can be shown to be maximal. Since  is reductive, the diagonal subgroup is a Cartan subgroup.
