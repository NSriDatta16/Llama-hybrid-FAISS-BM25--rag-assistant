Plot summary

The plot of Snake Woman follows Jessica Peterson, a young introspective Midwestern girl who has moved to Los Angeles and works as a waitress in a downtown LA dive-bar. One night, a yuppie bar patron she mistakenly trusts accosts her, and during the attack, he reveals knowledge of an ancient order known only as "The 68". Jessica is able to fight him off and ultimately kills him, experiencing a strange mixture of emotions, including arousal. The story draws on India's ancient Snake (Naga) legends, in which the soul of a serpent is reborn in the form of a beautiful and unsuspecting female. Jessica becomes increasingly possessed by her reptilian instincts and is driven to avenge a centuries-old wrong, finding herself a part of something far greater than herself.

Throughout the story Jessica experiences struggle between her human brain, of which include ethics, morals, and intellect, and her reptilian one, that of which also include instinct, sense, and survival patterns. As she discovers the power embedded in our reptilian selves, she confronts the humanity that tries to control it.
