History

Up to and including the official establishment of the town in 1818

A settlement called Aldarespah is first mentioned in the mid-8th century in a codex belonging to Mondsee Abbey. The ostensible earliest mention of a church in Aldersbach dating from this period resulted from the misinterpretation of note from the early 14th century to be found in the earliest book of accounts of Aldersbach Abbey.  1120 saw the establishment of the first abbey in Aldersbach (St. Peter), founded by the religious order of the Augustinian Canons. By c. 1140 the name Alderbach was in common use and a Latinized form, Adalogeriopagus, appears in records from the early 16th century. The name derives from the name of a person, Althar or Aldar and the Old High German word for a stream: pah or pach. Aldersbach fell under the financial stewardship of Landshut and the jurisdiction of  Vilshofen district court in the Electorate of Bavaria. Aldersbach Abbey had its own limited jurisdiction as a Hofmark, before being suppressed in 1803 during the secularization of Bavaria. In 1806 the local Weng and Bernhardsberg churches were sold and demolished. The community of Aldersbach was created by the Community Edict of 1818 in the course of administrative reforms in Bavaria.

Administrative community 
Enforced membership of the administrative community of Aidenbach was lifted in 1980.

History of the parishes 
The parish of Walchsing is first mentioned in records in 1100. Haidenburg hosted a manor house that originally belonged to the House of Harbach, had been acquired by Aldersbach Abbey in 1737 and following secularization in 1818 was purchased by Johann Adam Freiherr von Aretin  in 1811. As part of administrative reforms in Bavaria, the Community Edict of 1818 led to the formation of the parishes of Pörndorf, Haidenburg and Walchsing, which were incorporated into Aldersbach in 1972.

Incorporation 
The previously separate community of Walchsing and parts of the dissolved community of Haidenburg were incorporated on January 1, 1972, while Pörndorf (District of Eggenfelden) was incorporated on July 1, 1972.

From 1990 to 2014 Franz Schwarz was mayor. In the local elections of March 16, 2014, Harald Mayrhofer was elected for a 6-year term.
