Synopsis
Jimmy's behavior at a meeting convinces Tony and Uncle Junior that he is an FBI informant. Jimmy is lured into a trap by Christopher and killed by Silvio; his body is dumped in an alley with a dead rat stuffed into his mouth.

Knowing that Tony's life is in danger, Dr. Melfi openly speculates about Livia, noting that she often speaks of infanticide and suggesting that she has a borderline personality disorder. Tony angrily rejects this, physically threatens Melfi, and storms out.

Tony is brought to an FBI safehouse where Agent Frank Cubitoso reveals that Livia's room at the Green Grove retirement home has been bugged. He plays audio recordings that confirm Tony's suspicions that the attempt on his life was planned by Uncle Junior, who was goaded by Livia.

Tony returns to Melfi, explaining that the attempted hit occurred partly because he was seeing her, and telling her to leave town. He then confides to his crew that he is seeing a psychiatrist. Though Silvio and Paulie accept it, Christopher cannot and walks out. Tony and his crew then begin to retaliate against Junior's crew, killing Mikey and Chucky. However, Junior and the rest of his crew are then arrested; Tony's lawyer tells him that he was not indicted because the charges relate to a stock fraud scam in which he was not involved. Junior is offered a lesser charge if he confesses that Tony is the de facto boss of the DiMeo crime family, but he refuses.

Carmela sees that Father Phil is now close to Jackie Aprile's widow Rosalie. When he calls on Carmela, knowing that she is alone, she rebuffs him, accusing him of taking advantage of spiritually thirsty women. Crushed, he leaves.

When Artie visits Livia at Green Grove, she divulges Tony's role in burning down his restaurant. Artie then angrily confronts Tony with a rifle, but Tony manages to persuade him that his mother is unreliable and confused. Though still enraged, Artie destroys the rifle and leaves. As time passes, his rebuilt restaurant is a success, and he finds peace. 

Tony goes to Green Grove and grabs a pillow, intending to smother his mother. However, Livia has just had a stroke and is wheeled past Tony on a gurney. Discarding the pillow, he leans very close to her face and whispers that he knows what she did. The staff haul him off as he shouts, "Look at her face, she's smiling!"

Later that night, Tony and his family go to Artie's restaurant to wait out a thunderstorm. After a little hesitation, he welcomes them. As they eat by candlelight, Tony raises his glass to "the little moments that were good".

Title reference
 In a session with Dr. Melfi, Tony relates a dream he had involving neighbor Jean Cusamano. The title is also a play on the name of the TV show I Dream of Jeannie, which is, in turn, a play on the first line of the Stephen Foster song "Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair".

Cultural references 
The episode title is a nod to the 1960s I Dream of Jeannie TV series.
When A.J. is making fun of Livia after her "Who's Artie Bucco?" question, he mockingly hums the theme from Jeopardy!.
Meadow and Jeremy are watching "Planely Possible", an episode of the sci-fi/horror HBO TV Show Perversions of Science, together.
Father Phil brings Carmela a DVD of the 1998 film One True Thing, starring Renée Zellweger.
When Mikey Palmice fingers Junior for shooting Brendan Filone, Christopher expresses disbelief, calling Junior "Mr. Magoo".
When the FBI offers to play Tony portions of surveillance tape in an informal sit-down, he jokes that if it's the Springsteen CD box set, he's already got it. 
The U.S. attorney who offers Junior a deal is named Gene Conigliaro. Eugene Conigliaro was a character on a sixth-season episode of The Rockford Files, "Just a Coupla Guys." Chase wrote both scripts. Greg Antonacci, who played Conigliaro, would eventually join the show in the sixth season as New York mobster Butch DeConcini.
Tony calls a hospital worker "George Clooney", a reference to the actor's role on ER.
During the final dinner scene, Paulie calls Silvio "Pat Cooper", a reference to the famous comedian.
When advising Dr. Melfi to leave town for her own safety, Tony suggests that she tell her patients that "August came early". This is a reference to the practice of psychoanalysts to vacation in the month of August.
Being questioned while under arrest, Junior jokes to his interrogator that he would like to have sex with Angie Dickinson. This is a reference to the actress who was reputed to have had an affair with John F. Kennedy, with whom Junior is obsessed.
Christopher refers to William "Petite" Clayborn and Rasheen Ray — the gunmen contracted to kill Tony — as Boyz II Men.
