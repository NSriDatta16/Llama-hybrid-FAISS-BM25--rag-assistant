The Professorship of Greek is a chair at the University of Glasgow. Following a bequest by Douglas MacDowell, the chair was renamed the MacDowell Professor of Greek in his honour.

History
Under the Nova Erectio of King James VI of Scotland the teaching of Greek at the University of Glasgow in Scotland was the responsibility of the Regents (university teachers). From 1581 one of the Regents was sometimes given the title Professor of Greek. The Professorship was more formally established in 1704.

Following the retirement of Douglas MacDowell in 2001, the University opted to let the Chair of Greek lapse. However, upon his MacDowell's death the University received a bequest from his estate of over £2 million. The money was used to re-establish the chair, with the first incumbent of the Macdowell Chair in Greek appointed in 2012.
