Terra Diablo is a Scottish rock band signed to Nocturnal Records. The band was formed when singers and guitarists Ian Fairclough and Davey McAuley met while working at the same record store.

They have been managed by Jez Hindmarsh, drummer for Swervedriver, since early 2006.
They have supported the likes of Biffy Clyro, Snow Patrol, Hundred Reasons, Six by Seven, Idlewild, and have played at both the Reading and Leeds Festivals and T in the Park. Their original bassist Paul Wilson left the band in 2005 to join Snow Patrol.
