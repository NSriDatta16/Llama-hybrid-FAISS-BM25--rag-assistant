Industry

Maikammer's local economy is predominantly supported by the wine industry.  The area is well known for the vineyards of Alsterweiler, Kappellenberg, Kirchenstück, Immengarten and Heiligenberg, which produce  Müller-Thurgau and Riesling grapes.  Wine has played a significant part in Maikammer's history, both economically and culturally.  Maikammer is also host to numerous villas built by the original wine families of the area, which now help to attract tourists to the area.

During the 1850s, Anton Ullrich and his brother Franz Ullrich established an enameling factory in Maikammer producing enameled kitchenware.  This factory was a major source of employment for the people of Maikammer, employing around 1,000 people at its peak.  The products made in Maikammer were sold throughout Europe, distribution  extended as far east as Russia.  The factory was closed in 1928 as a result of Germany's hyperinflation.
