The 10th World Cup season began in December 1975 in France and concluded in March 1976 in Canada.  Ingemar Stenmark of Sweden won the first of his three consecutive overall titles.  Defending women's overall champion Annemarie Moser-Pröll, who had won five straight overall titles, missed the entire season so that she could care for her father, who was terminally ill with lung cancer.  In her absence, Rosi Mittermaier of West Germany, a double gold medalist at the 1976 Winter Olympics, won the women's overall title.

This was also the first year that a season champion was recognized in the Combined discipline, which was added the previous year.  After this year, the World Cup would not award a season championship trophy in Combined again until 1980.  Additionally, individual parallel slalom was made a permanent fixture at the season-ending Nations Cup championships; however, it only counted for the team competition.  After 1992, it was replaced by a team parallel slalom event, which again only counted for the Nations Cup team competition.

A break in the schedule in February was for the 1976 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria.
