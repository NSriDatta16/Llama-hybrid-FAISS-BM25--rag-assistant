3-Way Tie (For Last) is the fourth and final full-length album recorded by the American punk band Minutemen.  It is notable for featuring several covers of songs by bands such as the Urinals, Meat Puppets, Blue Öyster Cult, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and Roky Erickson. The last song, a cover of Erickson's "Bermuda," was sung over the phone by Mike Watt.

The album was released very shortly before the death of D. Boon, who also painted the cover. Watt collaborated with Black Flag bassist Kira Roessler on four tracks ("Political Nightmare", "No One", "Stories", and "What Is It?"). Around the time that the album was recorded, Watt and Roessler formed Dos.

The album included ballots for listeners to vote on the track list for what would become Ballot Result.
