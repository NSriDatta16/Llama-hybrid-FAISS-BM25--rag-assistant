Get It Right is the twenty-ninth studio album by American singer Aretha Franklin, released on July 14, 1983, by Arista Records. It was produced by Luther Vandross, following his successful teaming with the singer for the Gold-certified album, Jump to It, in 1982. Get It Right was not as commercially successful, and Franklin did not have Vandross produce any further albums.

The disc's title song became a number 1 hit on Billboards R&B singles chart, but it stalled at only number 61 on the Billboard Hot 100. The album was a critical and commercial failure, selling about 200,000 copies in the US. It was re-issued on compact disc in the late 1990s. and again via Big Break Records in 2012.
