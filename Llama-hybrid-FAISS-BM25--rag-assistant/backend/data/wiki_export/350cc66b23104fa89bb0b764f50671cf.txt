The Treasurer of Arkansas acts as the head banker for the State of Arkansas, handling deposits, withdrawals, redemptions of state warrants, and investments of state funds. The position was created in 1819 when Arkansas became a territory. When Arkansas became a state in 1836, its constitution established the Office of the Treasurer, a position that would be elected by the legislature, and was later changed to a statewide elected post.

The office is currently held by Larry Walther, who was appointed to the position following the death of Mark Lowery.
