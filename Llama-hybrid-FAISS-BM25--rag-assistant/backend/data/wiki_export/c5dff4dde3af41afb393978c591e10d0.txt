was a Japanese actress from Osaka Prefecture. From 1947 to 1957, she was a member of the Takarazuka Revue. After leaving the revue, she was active in film, television, and narration.

She famously quit part way through the filming of the television series Akai Giwaku, outraged at being forced to work at times dictated by idol Momoe Yamaguchi's schedule.

Her husband, director Senkichi Taniguchi, died on October 29, 2007, in Tokyo, Japan.  The couple had been married since 1957.

Yachigusa died on October 24, 2019, at a Tokyo hospital from pancreatic cancer, aged 88.
