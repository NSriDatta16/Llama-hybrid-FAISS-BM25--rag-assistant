Where's Neil When You Need Him? is a tribute album based on the works of fantasy writer Neil Gaiman.

Overview
The album was released on Dancing Ferret Discs on July 18, 2006. The CD has cover art by Dave McKean and extensive new liner notes from Neil Gaiman and Patrick Rodgers.

The album's title was taken from the song "Space Dog", by Tori Amos. Amos became a long-time friend and collaborator of Neil Gaiman after she made a reference to him in the 1991 song "Tear in Your Hand". (She had also made references to Gaiman and his work in her songs "Horses", "Hotel", "Carbon", "Not Dying Today", and "Sister Named Desire".)  "Sister Named Desire" is the only work on this album that had previously appeared elsewhere. (The song was originally released as a B-side to Amos' track "Talula".)  It was remastered specifically for this release at the same time that other Amos tracks were being cleaned up for her compilation Tales of a Librarian.
