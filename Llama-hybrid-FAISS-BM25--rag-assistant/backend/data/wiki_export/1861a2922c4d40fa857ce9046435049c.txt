Cardinal Spellman High School is an American Roman Catholic high school in the borough of the Bronx in New York City, New York. The school is chartered by the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York and is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. It is named after Cardinal Francis Spellman, the sixth archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York.

History

In September 1959, the newly created Cardinal Spellman High School opened in temporary quarters (formerly, the Biograph Motion Picture Studios of Thomas Alva Edison) on Marmion Avenue in the Tremont section of the Bronx. Its permanent location on Baychester Avenue, between Boston Road and East 233rd Street in Edenwald, covers thirteen acres (including ball fields, grandstands, running track, and parking lots). The founding principal was  Msgr. John Breheny, PhD.

Cardinal Spellman personally dedicated the new school facilities on May 27, 1962. Many years later, the name of Needham Avenue, in front of the school, was officially changed by then Bronx Borough President and alumnus Fernando Ferrer to Cardinal Spellman Place.

At first the school was co-institutional, with separate classes for boys (staffed by diocesan priests, Brothers of the Christian Schools and laymen) and for girls (staffed by the Sisters of Charity of Mount St. Vincent and laywomen). Each of the two departments (Boys' and Girls') had its own principal and assistant principal, and (to coordinate) a Principal of the School. In Fall 1971, the co-institutional model was changed to the current co-ed system.

In May 1963, Cardinal Spellman High School was admitted to the University of the State of New York and thus accredited by the Board of Regents of the State. Accreditation by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools was first announced on December 2, 1965, and was renewed in December, 1976 This accreditation has been renewed regularly in 1977, 1982, 1986, 1997 and most recently.
