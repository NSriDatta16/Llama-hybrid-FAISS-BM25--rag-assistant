History
AHEPA University Hospital was founded in 1947 with the economic support of the AHEPA, which is a Greek organization in the United States of America. It opened for the public in 1951, during the celebration of the 25th anniversary of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. Practically though, the hospital started its normal operation in March 1953.

In 1955, the Swedish philanthropic organisation RÃ¤dda Barnen (Swedish chapter of Save the Children) made a new donation to the hospital. This donation was used in order to construct the Paediatric pavilion with a total of 100 beds. The university's paediatric clinic was settled in this new pavilion in 1958.
