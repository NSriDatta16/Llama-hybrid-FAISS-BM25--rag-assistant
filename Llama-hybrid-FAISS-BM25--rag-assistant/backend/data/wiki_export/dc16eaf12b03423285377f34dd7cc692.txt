Arne is a common masculine given name for males in Scandinavia. It is also a surname in England. 

The name Arne originates from the old Norse name Árni, which in turn is derived from the old Norse name for "eagle", Ǫrn. The oldest attestation of the name is from a runestone in Vagnhärad dating to the 11th century. 

The word arne also refers to the central stone on the floor of traditional Norwegian homes upon which the fire that provides the heating/cooking needs was lit. Similarly, "Arne" is Danish for the flame in a fireplace or old-fashioned oven or stove.
