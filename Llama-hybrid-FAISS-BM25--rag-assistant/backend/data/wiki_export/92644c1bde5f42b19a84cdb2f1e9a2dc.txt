Monroe County Airport  is a county-owned public-use airport located four nautical miles (7 km) southwest of the central business district of Bloomington, a city in Monroe County, Indiana, United States. Commercial service has been available at different points in the airport's history but as of today and for the future, no scheduled service is available.

Facilities and aircraft 
Monroe County Airport covers an area of  at an elevation of 845 feet (258 m) above mean sea level. It has two asphalt paved runways: 17/35 is 6,500 by 150 feet (1,981 x 46 m) and 6/24 is 3,798 by 100 feet (1,158 x 30 m).

As constructed, the original runway was 5,200 feet (1,585 m) but was later lengthened to 6,500 feet (1,981 m) permitting the operation of Boeing 727 aircraft. In 1995, the aircraft parking ramp was completely replaced  allowing for the handling of larger planes. 13 hangars were added at this time as well. Fixed Base Operator (FBO) services and car rentals are available. There are two FBOs at the airport: Cook Aviation (owned by Cook Group) and BMG Aviation.

Commercial carriers offered scheduled service to and from Monroe County Airport until the late 1990s.  Operations at Monroe County Airport received federal funding under the Essential Air Service program until 1997, when these subsidies were cut due to the airport's proximity to Indianapolis International Airport.  After the loss of these subsidies, it was no longer economically viable for commercial carriers to operate at Monroe County Airport.
