Vera Vladimirovna Bryndzei (, ) (born 25 January 1952 in Ivano-Frankivsk, Ukrainian SSR) is a former speed skater who competed for the Soviet Union.

Skating for Dynamo Kiev, Vera Bryndzei won a silver medal at the Soviet Sprint Championships in 1975. She would eventually win two more national medals, both at the Soviet Allround Championships: silver in 1977 and bronze in 1978.

Bryndzei made her first international appearance in 1976 at the World Allround Championships in Gjøvik where she finished 16th. Her only international success came the next year when Bryndzei became the 1977 World Allround Champion in Keystone. She also participated in the World Sprint Championships two weeks later, finishing 23rd. In 1978, Bryndzei did not successfully defend her World Champion title, finishing in a disappointing 14th place. At the 1980 Winter Olympics of Lake Placid, she competed in the 1,500 m, resulting in an 18th place.
