Globus is a Santa Monica-based movie trailer music-inspired band consisting of a mix of producers, musicians, and vocalists. The band is led by composer and producer Yoav Goren.

History

Foundation 
Globus was founded as a result of increasing demand for Immediate Music to make their work available for a wider audience. The band's live world premiere took place in The Grand Hall, Wembley, London, on 26 July 2006 and their first album, Epicon, was released in August of that same year.  Feeder's Mark Richardson is featured on drums with guest performances by vocalist Scott Ciscon.

Later years 
In 2011 Globus released their second album, Break From This World, with Ciscon returning for some performances together with Dutch singer Anneke van Giersbergen. The latter also actively participated in the album's development, helping write some of the lyrics for the song Mighty Rivers Run.

In the following years, Globus' activity declined, as creative director Yoav Goren worked on other composing and producing projects.

Return 

But in mid-2018, the group announced that they had restarted work. On 4 November 2020, a rendition of John Lennon's "Gimme Some Truth" (1971) was released, the band's first studio recording in over 9 years, and the first of a so-called Election 2020 trilogy of covers.

On 25 February 2022, the band released You and I performed by Dann Pursey as the first of three singles for a third studio album Cinematica, which was released on October 14, 2022.

Musical style 
Globus is considered to have been a pioneer of the then relatively young Epic Music genre. As a result, their musical style range from orchestral arrangements to symphonic rock with elements of world music  and symphonic metal. Some of their compositions have been used as trailer music, such as Preliator, which was featured in the trailers for Spider-Man 2 and The Dukes of Hazzard as well as the "Epic" promo for PlayStation Move.  A portion of their Epicon "Preliator" track was used for the final sinking of the Japanese warship "Yamato" feature (2005).
