Edgar Sulite (September 25, 1957 â€“ April 10, 1997) was a teacher of Filipino martial arts. He was the creator of Lameco Eskrima and trained such notables as Dan Inosanto, Ron Balicki, Larry Hartsell, Fred Degerberg, and Diana Lee Inosanto.

Sulite trained with several martial arts masters, including Leo Gaje of Pekiti-Tirsia Kali, Antonio "Tatang" Ilustrisimo of Kalis Ilustrisimo, Jose D. Caballero of De Campo Uno-Dos-Tres Orihinal, and Jesus Abella of Modern Largos. He created a new style and called it Lameco Eskrima. The name was a combination of the Largo (long), Medio (Medium), and Corto (close quarter) techniques that he learned during his studies of Filipino martial arts.

Biography

Life in the Philippines

In 1981, he moved to Manila and became friends with Roland Dantes, a famous Filipino film celebrity and martial artist. This created opportunities for him to train various stunt people, celebrities, and prominent business people. Also at this time, he began to train under Antonio Ilustrisimo.

Completing college, Sulite earned his Bachelor in Arts and majored in economics. During his time in college, he sought out different Eskrima masters to study under. Sulite became a member of Bakbakan International as well as the representative for Leo Gaje's national Arnis Association of the United States.

He managed to bring his wife, Felisa Sulite, from the Philippines in 1992, and their children followed a few years later. The couple had two more children, who were born in the US.
