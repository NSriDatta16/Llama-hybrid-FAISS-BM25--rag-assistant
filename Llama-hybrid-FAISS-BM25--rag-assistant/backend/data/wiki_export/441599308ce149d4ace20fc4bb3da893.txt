History
Wanted sa Radyo first aired on DZXL-AM from 1994 to 2010. It transferred to the newly-launched Radyo5 92.3 News FM (now 92.3 Radyo5 True FM) in 2010, while retaining Raffy Tulfo and Niña Taduran as its hosts with the same airtime from 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm.

Its television simulcast began on February 21, 2011, with the launch of AksyonTV. From January to May 2012, the show used to temporarily air for one hour from 12:30 pm to 1:30 pm whenever Radyo5 and AksyonTV aired the News5 coverage of the impeachment trial of then-Chief Justice Renato Corona at 1:30 pm onwards. On December 23, 2013, the Radyo5 studios used by the show moved from the TV5 Studio Complex in Novaliches, Quezon City to TV5 Media Center in Mandaluyong.

On October 15, 2018, Niña Taduran left the show to run for party-list representative for ACT-CIS in 2019. She was replaced by Sharee Roman. The TV simulcast was carried over to One PH in January 2019, when AksyonTV was rebranded as 5 Plus.

From October 18, 2021, the show moved from TV5 Media Center to its new studio at the Raffy Tulfo Action Center in Quezon City and it went online-only where it is exclusively livestreamed on "Raffy Tulfo in Action" YouTube channel. Replay episodes were being aired until October 20, 2021, on their regular timeslot on Radyo5 92.3 News FM and One PH before live broadcasts resumed on the next day. An online-only hour-long extended edition of the show was also launched on the same day.

On February 8, 2022, Tulfo took a leave from the show to focus on his Senate campaign; he returned to the show on May 10. The show still continues streaming online even if Radyo5 and One PH air a One News special coverage.

On August 12, 2022, Tulfo revealed that the show would return to the TV5 Media Center starting August 15. As a result, it reverted to its regular two-hour timeslot. The hour-long online-exclusive extended edition was moved to 6:00–7:00 pm, this time re-titled as RTIA: Bardagulan Serye with Roman and Tulfo-Tungol as hosts; it later returned airing from 4:00–5:00 pm.

Format
The show investigates and exposes cases of abuse, dishonesty, exploitation, and family disputes ("Sumbong at Aksyon"), as well as recognizes ordinary people who return items of value that they find in their course of work ("Solian ng Bayan"). The show regularly emphasizes Tulfo's no-nonsense approach and interrogation, sometimes laced with profanity.

The most common feature of the show is "Sumbong at Aksyon", where complainants tell Tulfo about their situation and seek assistance to resolve it. Tulfo puts the other party on the air to get their side of the story and encourages both parties to talk to each other in the air. Tulfo may occasionally conclude that the complainant is the one who committed something wrong and, as such, may refuse further assistance; in rare cases, Tulfo himself may even take action against the complainant (e.g. refer him/her to the police and file charges) if warranted. After hearing both sides of the story, Tulfo may contact someone in a position (e.g. high-ranking police officials or social workers) to further assist the aggrieved party. An average of four sets of complainants are featured during the show. If a complainant's conversation with the other party is quite lengthy and time is about to run out, they may be asked to continue it off-air.

The final show of each month begins with an awarding ceremony featuring people who returned items to their owners in the "Solian ng Bayan" segments aired throughout the month. The awardees receive a medal, plaque, cash reward, and items from the sponsors; these are in addition to the cash reward and items received during the "Solian ng Bayan" segment in which they appeared.

Internet and social media

On July 4, 2016, Wanted sa Radyo launched a website entitled "Raffy Tulfo in Action", which features the cases featured in WSR and also cases in the spin-off segment Itimbre Mo kay Tulfo on Aksyon sa Tanghali and Idol in Action. The show's video feed is simulcast over Radyo5's Facebook page and a copy of the day's show is also posted on the "Raffy Tulfo in Action" YouTube channel. The social media accounts contain video clips that feature how some of the cases were resolved as well as how the off-air conversations between the parties have gone.

Spin-off television series
From January 28, 2011, to July 30, 2012, Wanted, a public affairs program acting as an extension and TV version of Wanted sa Radyo, was aired every Monday at 11:30pm–12:00am on TV5. AksyonTV aired its producer's cut from February 21, 2011, to January 11, 2019. The set was different, with Tulfo sitting comfortably in a radio booth setting. Respondents and interviewees are videotaped while they are on the phone with him. From June 8, 2020, to October 1, 2021, it was renamed Idol in Action.

Wanted: Ang Serye, a docu-drama anthology and another extension of Wanted, premiered on January 16, 2021, on TV5. Presented by Cignal Entertainment and JCB Entertainment Productions, it is also hosted by Tulfo. The program dramatizes true stories based on complaints brought to Raffy Tulfo in Action. After its most recent episode was aired on May 1, 2021, it took a "season break". It returned on June 27 in a new timeslot.

Controversies

Jee Ick-Joo's abduction and killing

On October 21, 2016, a complainant named alias "Joy" was exulted to WSR that her employee South Korean businessman named Jee Ick-Joo was kidnapped by a policeman identified as SPO3 Richard "Ricky" Sta. Isabel, due to alleged involvement of illegal drugs on October 18 in Angeles, Pampanga, the maid and Jee were sent to Quezon City and eventually separated at Camp Crame, and that night when they separated Jee was killed in nearby White House, the residence of the Philippine National Police Chief, incidentally Gen. Ronald dela Rosa was in Beijing accompanied by President Rodrigo Duterte on his State Visit.

Political involvement

Raffy Tulfo and his siblings are staunch supporters of President Rodrigo Duterte's policies. During the 2019 elections, he and Erwin acquired ACT-CIS Partylist from former Representative Samuel Pagdilao, Jr. and nominated Erwin's Chief of Staff Eric Go Yap, Raffy's wife Jocelyn Tulfo, and co-host Niña Taduran, while Ramon, Wanda, and Ben declined to participate. ACT-CIS took the top position with 2.6 million votes, earning the maximum of three seats at the 18th Congress. One of the campaign strategies is inserting the ACT-CIS logo into the Raffy Tulfo in Action social media pages, as RTIA is only a blocktimer to 92.3 Radyo5 True FM.
