History
On February 4, 1960, the station signed on as WFMM-FM.  It was owned by the Commercial Radio Institute (which eventually evolved into Sinclair Broadcast Group) with studios on West Biddle Street. It was a rare stand-alone FM station, not associated with an AM station or a newspaper.

In 1974, the station was acquired by Nationwide Communications, a division of Nationwide Insurance.  Nationwide decided to put a country music format on 93.1.  The call sign was switched from WFMM-FM to WPOC, standing for "Pride of the Chesaspeake", because the station covers much of Chesapeake Bay.  The station affiliated with the ABC Directions Network for national news.

In 1999, the station was acquired by Clear Channel Communications, which maintained the country music format.  Clear Channel later became iHeartMedia, the current owner.

Airstaff and honors
WPOC has been voted "Baltimore's Best Country Station" several times, along with other industry awards. The station is home to "The Laurie DeYoung Morning Show." Since 2008 she has been joined by newscaster and producer Jeff St. Pierre, and since 2017 traffic reporter Francesca Presti. DeYoung was inducted into the Country Music DJ Hall of Fame in 2010.

Midday is hosted by Bob Delmont, while Michael J. hosts the afternoon drive time. Premiere Networks' syndicated The Bobby Bones Show is carried in the evening and Granger Smith's syndicated show is heard overnight. Saturday evenings feature the "Country House Party".

WPOC-FM has one of the longest-tenured weekday lineups in the country. DeYoung, Delmont and Michael J. have hosted Morning Drive through Afternoon Drive since 2001.
