Xenon oxytetrafluoride () is an inorganic chemical compound. It is an unstable colorless liquid with a melting point of  that can be synthesized by partial hydrolysis of , or the reaction of  with silica or :

 +  →  +  + 

A high-yield synthesis proceeds by the reaction of  with  at .

As are most xenon oxides, it is extremely reactive, and it hydrolyses in water to give dangerously hazardous and corrosive products, including hydrogen fluoride:

2 + 4 → 2 + 8 + 3

In addition, some ozone and fluorine is formed.

Reactions
 reacts with  in the following steps:

 +  →  + 2
 +  →  + 2

The  formed is a dangerous explosive, decomposing explosively to Xe and :
2 → 2 + 3

In its liquid form,  exhibits amphoteric behaviour, forming complexes with both strong Lewis bases like  and strong Lewis acids like . It forms a 1:1 adduct with , isostructural with ·, as well as various heavy alkali metal fluorides.

The reaction of  with  provides a convenient synthesis route for .
