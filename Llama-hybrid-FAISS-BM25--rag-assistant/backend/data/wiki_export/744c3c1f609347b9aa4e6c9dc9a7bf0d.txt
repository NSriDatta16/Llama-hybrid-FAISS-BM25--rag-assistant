The following is a non-comprehensive list of Iranian doctors that lived from medieval times up until the beginning of the modern age.

By "Iranian", all the peoples of historic Persia are meant, i.e., what is today Iran, Afghanistan, and all the countries of Central Asia ("common modern definition") that were historically part of the Persian empire, whether or not such people were ethnic Persians or Iranians. In some cases, their exact ancestry is unclear. They may have emigrated or immigrated, and thus may appear in other "Lists of", but nevertheless their names and work are somehow linked to the words "Iranian" and/or "Persian".
