Bartholomew is an English or Jewish (generally also Christian) given name that derives from the Aramaic name meaning "son of Talmai". Bar is Aramaic for "son", and marks patronyms. Talmai either comes from telem "furrow" or is a Hebrew version of Ptolemy. Thus Bartholomew is either "son of furrows" (i.e., rich in land) or "son of Ptolemy".

Bartholomew (Barry) is English or Scottish but also a Jewish surname with the same meaning as the above as a given name.
