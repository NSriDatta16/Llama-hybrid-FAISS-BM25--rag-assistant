History
The name derives from the town's ancient origins, meaning "The Guard". It is mentioned in 1056, when its castle was a fief of the Bishops of Toulon; they kept it until the 13th century, when it was handed over to the Castellanes, then the lords of Glandevès and the Thomas. Today only a tower and the chapel remain of the castle.

La Garde was repeatedly invaded during the French Wars of Religion. In 1707 it was sacked by Savoyard troops.
