History
Bishop John E. Hines of the Episcopal Diocese of Texas founded St. Stephen's Episcopal School in 1950. He was once quoted as saying that it was the duty of Christians "to live on the bleeding edge of the human dilemma". Hines believed girls should have equal access to education, and St. Stephen's was the first Episcopalian co-educational boarding school in the United States. The school also played a part in the 20th-century Civil Rights Movement as the first integrated boarding school in the South.

Governance
St. Stephen's has a board of trustees, including alumni and parents of former students. Day-to-day operations of the school are overseen by a head of school, who is appointed by the board of trustees with the consent of the Bishop of the Episcopal  Diocese of Texas. The current headmaster, Christopher L. Gunnin, was appointed in 2016.

Currently there is a boarding program, with students supervised by a team of roughly 38 full-time staff, as well as  proctors (junior and senior students selected by staff to serve as mentors).

Religion
All faiths are welcomed, encouraged, accepted and celebrated at St. Stephen's Episcopal School. Chapel services are held in the early noons, in the form of a traditional Episcopalian worship service, sometimes featuring guest speakers and announcements. A weekly Sunday morning church service takes place during the school year, and boarding students are required to attend.
