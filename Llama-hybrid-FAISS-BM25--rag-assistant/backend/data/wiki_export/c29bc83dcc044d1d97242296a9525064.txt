Zadarfest is a music festival held annually since 1993 in Zadar, Croatia. In 2010, it was held in the Višnjik Hall, but was criticized for lack of appeal to the audience. The 2011 edition was moved to Kukljica on a nearby island, but was plagued by bad weather and attendance issues as well.

The festival gives out several awards, the highest being the Grand Prix.
