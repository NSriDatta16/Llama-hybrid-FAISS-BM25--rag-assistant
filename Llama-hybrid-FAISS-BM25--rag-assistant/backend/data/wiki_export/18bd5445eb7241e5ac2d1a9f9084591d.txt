Toms River High School East is a comprehensive four-year public high school, the third high school built in Toms River in Ocean County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, serving students in ninth through twelfth grades as part of the Toms River Regional Schools.

As of the 2021–22 school year, the school had an enrollment of 1,552 students and 103.1 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 15.1:1. There were 274 students (17.7% of enrollment) eligible for free lunch and 78 (5.0% of students) eligible for reduced-cost lunch.

The Toms River high school day ends at 1:35 PM, one of the earliest daily closing time of any high schools in New Jersey.

History
By 1974, the district was facing split sessions for students, as the district's first and second high schools, Toms River High School South and Toms River High School North, had a total of 4,600 students, nearly 50% above capacity. To address the overcrowding, a March 1975 bond referendum was proposed to raise $15 million—the largest ever in county history—for construction of a third high school, which was rejected by a margin of nearly 1,000 votes. Construction was finally approved in a May 1977 referendum authorizing a $10.9 million bond issue to construct the school.

The school opened in September 1979 on a  site in a building constructed at a cost $10.9 million (equivalent to $ million in ). Opened at a time of rising energy prices, the building was designed so that each classroom had only two windows as a means to reduce heat loss through the glass.

Awards, recognition and rankings
The school was the 171st-ranked public high school in New Jersey out of 339 schools statewide in New Jersey Monthly magazine's September 2014 cover story on the state's "Top Public High Schools", using a new ranking methodology. The school had been ranked 225th in the state of 328 schools in 2012, after being ranked 239th in 2010 out of 322 schools listed. The magazine ranked the school 204th in 2008 out of 316 schools. The school was ranked 205th in the magazine's September 2006 issue, which surveyed 316 schools across the state. In 2017, the school became the seventh school in the state to be selected by Character.org as a National School of Character.

Lip Dub videos
Toms River High School East was recognized across the state and even the country for their Lip Dub 1 and Lip Dub 2 videos. The lip dub videos feature East students lip-syncing and dancing through the halls and campus of the school. The videos were created and produced by the Toms River Regional Schools TV Network and television production class. The students spent roughly three months planning Lip Dub 1, planning camera movement and timing out cues for the students who were lip-syncing in the video. Lip Dub 1 features about 150 students involved in many different sports, clubs and activities at East.

In that same school year, Lip Dub 1 received so much recognition that it inspired students and faculty at East to request a second lip dub be filmed. Lip Dub 2 involved over 400 students and faculty at East and was featured on News 12 New Jersey as well as WOBM.com, a local radio station.
