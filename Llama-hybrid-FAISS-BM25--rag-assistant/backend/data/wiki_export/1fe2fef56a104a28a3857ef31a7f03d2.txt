Main sights

Located nearby is the Catholic shrine of the Madonna di Tirano, a major tourist attraction. The shrine is dedicated to the appearance of the Blessed Mother to Mario Degli Omodei on September 29, 1504, an event religious pilgrims credit with ending a pestilence.

The Museo Etnografico Tiranese (MET) is an ethnographic museum and located nearby the Basilica Madonna di Tirano in an 18th-century Palazzo, the Casa del Penitenziere (Penitent's House).

The museum of Palazzo Salis in the old town of Tirano is an example of the use of trompe l'oeil to create the illusion of architectural features.
