Elaea or Elaia () was the ancient name of a promontory on the northeast coast of Cyprus, which was mentioned by Ptolemy, (Ptol. v. 14. ยง 3) and is mapped by the Barrington Atlas on the southeast side of the Karpas Peninsula. A misprint in Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography places it on Crete, but at a location, Chaule-burnau, mapped by Richard Pococke to Karpas on Cyprus. The confusion with Crete has caused the place name to be linked to a temple of Zeus Diktaios near the modern town of Palaikastron.
