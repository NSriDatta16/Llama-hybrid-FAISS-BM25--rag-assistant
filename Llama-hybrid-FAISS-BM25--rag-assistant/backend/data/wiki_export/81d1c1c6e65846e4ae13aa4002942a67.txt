Falconer is a Scottish surname, either a sept of Clan Keith or a clan on its own, having as crest an angel in a praying posture or, within an orle of laurel proper, as motto VIVE UT VIVAS ("Live that you may have life") but without a chief, being merely an armigerous clan. It is an Anglicized version of the Old French Faulconnier, the name being derived from the occupational name for a trainer of falcons. It can also be used as a first name or as a middle name.
