Henry of Scotland (Eanric mac Dabíd, 1114 – 12 June 1152) was heir apparent to the Kingdom of Alba. He was also the 3rd Earl of Northumbria and the 3rd Earl of Huntingdon. He was the son of King David I of Scotland and Queen Maud, 2nd Countess of Huntingdon.

Earldom
David I of Scotland, Henry's father, invaded England in 1136. His army was met by Stephen of Blois at Carlisle. Instead of battle, there was a negotiated settlement that included Henry performing homage to Stephen for Carlisle and the Earldom of Huntingdon. Henry's journey to Stephen's court for Easter (1136) was met with resentment, including an accusation of treason, which brought about his return at his father's insistence.

After another invasion by his father, Henry was finally invested with the Earldom of Northumberland in 1139. Later in the year, Henry met with Stephen at Nottingham, where he was also reinvested with Carlisle and Cumberland. Henry then paid homage to Stephen for his earldom.

Henry's inclusion into King Stephen's inner circle was highlighted by his arranged marriage to Ada de Warenne. This marriage secured Henry's place within Stephen's kingdom. Following Stephen's capture by forces of Empress Matilda, Henry held the Earldom of Northumberland as a Scottish fief.

Earl Henry, as sometimes named, son and heir of King David I of Scotland, had been in poor health throughout the 1140s. He died suddenly on 12 June 1152. His death occurred in either Newcastle or Roxburgh, both located in those areas of Northumbria which he and his father had attached to the Scots crown in the period of English weakness after the death of Henry I of England. Unlike in the case of the English king, who had been left without legitimate male descendants in the wreck of the White Ship, there was no succession crisis. This was because Earl Henry had left behind three sons to carry forward the lineage of his father.

On Henry's death, the Huntingdon earldom passed to his half-brother Simon II de Senlis.

Family
In 1139, Henry married Ada de Warenne, the daughter of William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey (died 1138), and Elizabeth of Vermandois, daughter of Hugh of Vermandois. Their children (in an approximate order of birth) were:

Malcolm IV of Scotland (1141–1165)
William I of Scotland (c. 1142–1214) 
Ada of Huntingdon (died 1206), married in 1161 Floris III, Count of Holland.
Margaret of Huntingdon (died 1201)
David of Scotland, 8th Earl of Huntingdon (1152–1219)
Matilda (or Maud) of Huntingdon, died unmarried in 1152.
Marjorie of Huntingdon, married Gille Críst, Earl of Angus.
