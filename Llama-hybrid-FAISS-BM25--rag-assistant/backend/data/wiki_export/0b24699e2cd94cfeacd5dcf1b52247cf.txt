Window Rock High School is a public high school in Fort Defiance, a census-designated place in unincorporated Apache County, Arizona. WRHS is the only high school in the Window Rock Unified School District.

WRUSD, and therefore the high school, serves several unincorporated areas, including Fort Defiance, Oak Springs, St. Michaels, Window Rock, and most of Sawmill.

History
The school district opened by the mid-1950s, with high school students two years later. The first students graduated in 1958 and 1959, and the school was completed in 1960.

A devastating fire burned the school to the ground early in April 1981, causing $5 million in damage. A new school was built later in the decade.
