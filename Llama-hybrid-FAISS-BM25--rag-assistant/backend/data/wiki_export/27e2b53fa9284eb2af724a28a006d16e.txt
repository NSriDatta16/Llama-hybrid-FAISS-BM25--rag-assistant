The site's status as a stopping place for travelers dates back to the 19th century when it was Rancho de Centinela (Spanish for "Sentinel Ranch") along El Camino Viejo; the route through the community has since been replaced by Interstate 5 and State Route 33.

Etymology
The name does not refer to a saint, as there is no saint named "Nella". The name is an English language corruption of the Spanish word centinela ("sentinel"), referring to the earlier Centinela Adobe that was located in the vicinity.

History

Santa Nella began as the site of Rancho de Centinela (Sentinel Ranch) first established by pioneering stockmen from San Juan Bautista and Monterey as a place to raise horses in 1810. The former Centinela Adobe, a one-story adobe built as living quarters for the ranch, was located on El Camino Viejo a Los Ángeles about  downstream from the site of the later San Luis Adobe (now under the San Luis Reservoir), at the east end of the Pacheco Pass road, situated on the south bank of Arroyo de San Luis Gonzaga. The escape of many of the horses into the valley and subsequent Indian hostilities made the enterprise a failure.

The land and adobe of this old Spanish ranch was included in the Rancho San Luis Gonzaga in 1843. From the time of the California Gold Rush the stage road from Hill's Ferry crossed San Luis Creek at Centinella on the way to connect with the Pacheco Pass road at Rancho San Luis. The old Centinela ranch became a stopping place for stages and travelers on El Camino Viejo. Later a two-story adobe house was constructed near the old adobe by Basque sheepmen in the 1860s and a wooden barn in the 1870s. The two-story adobe was subsequently torn down in the 1890s and replaced by a frame house built by Miller and Lux. This house and barn were for a long time local landmarks. However, by 1966, the wooden house and barn had been removed and a roadside stop built on the site along State Route 33. The name of the place had been corrupted into Santa Nella.

The community was entered into the Geographic Names Information System in 1981 as "Santa Nella Village". In 2010, it became a census-designated place under the "Santa Nella" name.
