History 

From the 1840s to 1918, the square was known as Znamenskaya Square, after the  built there between 1794 and 1804 in a Neoclassical design by . The church building commemorated the icon of Our Lady of the Sign. 

Four years before the Romanov Tercentenary, in 1909, Prince Paolo Troubetzkoy, an artist and sculptor, completed a tremendous equestrian statue of Tsar Alexander III. It stood opposite Nikolayevsky Station in Znamenskaya Square. The statue was removed by the Soviet regime in 1937. It remained in storage for fifty years before its re-erection in 1994 in front of the Marble Palace.

The square was a scene of many revolutionary demonstrations and protests. After the Bolsheviks took control of Petrograd in 1917, they had the square renamed (1918) into Uprising Square to commemorate these events. The Church of the Sign was demolished by the Soviet government in 1940 to make room for the surface vestibule of the Ploshchad Vosstaniya (Vosstaniya Square) Metro station, which opened in 1955.

The Leningrad Hero-City Obelisk was erected on the spot of the former Alexander III monument in 1985 in commemoration od the 40th anniversary of Russian Victory Day. The obelisk received mixed reviews, as its design and style did not match that of the neo-classic square.

In 2010, the  Galereya shopping center opened on the square, including a large Stockmann department store.
