The Dow Centennial Centre (DCC) is a multipurpose recreational facility in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, Canada. Constructed in 2003–2004 for the city's centennial, the  complex cost $22 million.

The DCC is notable for its arts facilities, which include a 552-seat performing arts theatre, and for its energy efficiency. However, it lacks any swimming facilities. The DCC has frequently hosted the province's judo and ringette championships.

Background and design

Into the early 2000s, there was a lack of public spaces in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta. The public gym and art studios were located in decrepit buildings which had once belonged to the local jail and were scheduled for demolition. There were no performance spaces, and some residents were travelling outside the city to find facilities.  These factors put pressure on the city to create a new recreational facility.

An initial proposal for a new community centre was rejected by city taxpayers in 2001. A larger plan, called the Centennial Activities Centre, attempted to meet all the community's requests with a gymnasium, indoor soccer pitch and hockey rink, studios for pottery and painting, a performing arts theatre, and a banquet facility. The  complex was approved by taxpayers in 2002.

The Centre was designed by architect Ken Hutchinson, and is distinguished from other multipurpose recreational facilities by its performing arts theatre and energy efficiency. Hutchinson made certain not to disguise the facility's features, with the second-floor running track and other prominent aspects visible from the reception area. The city's 4400 school children designed ceramic tiles which decorate several of the Centre's walls.

Financing
The projected cost of the Centre was $20 million. City taxpayers voted to pay $15 million of this over 20 years; the remainder was sought through grants and donations. The city had secured commitments for about half of these monies by July 2003.

The provincial government provided $2 million in grants. The largest corporate donor, Dow Chemical Company, donated $1 million towards the Centre, partially in the form of insulation materials manufactured by the company, and received naming rights as the Dow Centennial Centre (DCC). Other corporate donors include Sherritt International, Shell Canada and Agrium (now Nutrien), which respectively received naming rights to the hockey arena, performing arts theatre and indoor soccer pitch. Private donors include professional hockey players Richard Matvichuk and Ray Whitney.

Cost increases during construction were paid through additional fundraising, through lease charges, and through the city's budget reserves. The total cost of construction was just under $22 million.

Opened to the public on 15 September 2004, the DCC operated at a loss and cost the city millions of dollars over its first three years of operations, although it is credited with spurring nearby commercial and residential development in the city. In 2007, Telus was granted a five-year lease to a small parcel of land on the DCC property, to erect a  telecommunications tower, the tallest in the city.

Construction
Groundwork for the DCC began in spring 2003 on an  lot on Alberta Highway 21 at 84th Street. The primary builder was Stuart Olson Construction, with the work overseen by project manager Dick Polowaniuk and city manager Paul Benedetto.

The foundations were poured in July 2003. By October 2003, it was realized that second-floor expansions planned for a future date could be completed more cost-effectively alongside the main build. These were approved by city council, along with additional commercial space to generate lease revenues.

The Centre was intended to open in July 2004, for the centennial of Fort Saskatchewan's incorporation as a town. This was pushed back to September 2004.

The multi-purpose recreational facility has many features:

Commercial space includes physiotherapy and massage clinics, Ticketmaster, a sandwich shop and refreshment booth. There is also a  commercial kitchen, contracted to a catering company and capable of serving 2000 people at 4 events per evening.

Most of the facility has extra-thick insulation, and the sinks, toilets and urinals are designed to save water. An "eco-chill" system pumps glycol from the hockey rink's refrigerant compressors to the air vents in the soccer pitch, theatre and fitness centre, warming them in the winter and cooling them in the summer (when the hockey rink isn't in use). High-efficiency boilers provide backup heating, and solar panels on the facility's roof generate approximately 6,000 kilowat-hours of energy per year.

The DCC is operated by a staff of 35.

Expansion plans

Citing rapid population growth, the city's 2015 recreation master plan called for a $27 million aquatic centre and fitness expansion at the DCC planned for 2017–2020, followed in 2020–2022 by a second hockey arena at a cost of $12 million. Under Hockey Canada's development model, the city was not providing adequate practice time for the city's teams, who were seeking ice time in other communities.

Notable events

The DCC's performing arts theatre has hosted notable performers including Randy Bachman, George Canyon, Matt Good, Natalie MacMaster, Rita MacNeil, John McDermott, and Trooper. The theatre was also used for the opening concert scene in the 2008 Skyline Motion Pictures film Cat's Cradle.
