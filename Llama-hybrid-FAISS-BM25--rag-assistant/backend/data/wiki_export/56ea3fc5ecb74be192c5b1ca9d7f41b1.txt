David Bowie version
"Nite Flights" was first covered by the English musician David Bowie in 1993 for his album Black Tie White Noise. Along with all the other songs on Black Tie White Noise, this version uses heavy electronic sounds, including electronic drums and multiple synthesizers.

Bowie remarked that he was introduced to Scott Walker when he dated one of Walker's ex-girlfriends. Reportedly, she enjoyed Walker's music more than Bowie's, and played Walker's albums constantly.

A live performance of the song from a 1995 show during Bowie's Outside Tour was included on the release Ouvrez le Chien (Live Dallas 95) (2020).
