Bothidae or lefteye flounders are a family of flounders. They are called "lefteye flounders" because most species lie on the sea bottom on their right sides, with both eyes on their left sides. The family is also distinguished by the presence of spines on the snout and near the eyes.

Lefteye flounders vary considerably in size between the more than 160 species, ranging from  to  in length.
