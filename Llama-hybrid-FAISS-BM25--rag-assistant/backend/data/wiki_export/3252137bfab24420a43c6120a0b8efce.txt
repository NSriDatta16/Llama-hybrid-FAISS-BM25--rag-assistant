Toponymy
One of the first European landowners in the area was James Gibbon. He purchased 48 hectares of land between Newstead and New Farm and named the property Teneriffe because it reminded him of Mount Teide in Tenerife, Canary Islands. Gibbon built Teneriffe House in 1865. The single storey building still stands today on what is known as Teneriffe Hill.

History

By the 1880s the area was being settled by Europeans. The area was served by horse drawn trams starting in 1885. In 1890 land near Teneriffe House was subdivided and auctioned. The 30 allotments were sold under the name Teneriffe Estate. From 1897 until December 1962 electric trams ran along Commercial Road. Early photographs of the suburb show trams displaying the destination "Bulimba", which has given rise to some confusion in later times. Originally the area was considered part of the suburb called Bulimba which then straddled both sides of the Brisbane River. Postal deliveries were often misdirected and as a result the western section of Bulimba, comprising the area now known as Teneriffe, was renamed before World War I. However, the unofficial use of Bulimba as an address on the northern side of the river persisted for some decades, appearing on maps and in electoral rolls into the 1940s (although its Woolstore No.3 (Teneriffe Apartments) – 241 Arthur Street use progressively declines).

As wool exports from Queensland increased in the early 20th century, the economic importance of Teneriffe to the state also increased. The first wool store was built in 1909, with another three stores opening by 1915. Another nine wool stores were built, with the last two constructed during the 1950s. Well known architects designed these large buildings to represent the commercial success Australian wool producers experienced in the early 20th century. In 1927, the Australian Estates store was opened by the Duke and Duchess of York. It had the largest showroom in Australia and was able to store 24,000 bales.

During World War II the wharves served as Australia's largest submarine base with around 60 submarines based at Teneriffe. American and British submarines used the facilities, known as Capricon Wharf up until 1945. As container ships forced cargo shipments to the Port of Brisbane at the mouth of the river wool trading at Teneriffe ceased.

Through the conversion of wool stores and factories to residential apartments, the area has been transformed from a riverside industrial hub to a mostly high density residential area. Most of the Queenslander style homes have been preserved and renovated.

In the , Teneriffe had a population of 5,335 people.
