History
The Junior Vees were one of the inaugural teams in the Okanagan-Mainline Junior A Hockey League (OMJHL), launched in 1961. The league became the British Columbia Junior Hockey League (BCJHL) in 1967.

Although it is commonly thought by many that the name "Vees" refers to "victory", the name actually represents the three types of local peaches (Vedette, Valiant and Veteren).

The Vees were Mowat Cup champions in 1968, 1973, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1985, as well as in 1986, when they were also Centennial Cup champions. After 26 years since their last RBC Cup appearance, the Vees advanced to the championship game in the 2012 RBC Cup in Humboldt, Saskatchewan, defeating the Woodstock Slammers 4–3 on a goal by Joey Benik to win the Canadian National Junior A Championship.
