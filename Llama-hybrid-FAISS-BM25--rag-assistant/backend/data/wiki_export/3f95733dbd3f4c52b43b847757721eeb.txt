Salvador María de Iturbide y Huarte (17 July 1820 – 7 June 1856) was the eighth child (and third son) of Agustín I of Mexico and Empress Ana Maria Huarte. He was married in 1845 to Doña María del Rosario de Marzán y Guisasola. His descendants, through his son Salvador de Iturbide y de Marzán, are the current pretenders to the Mexican Throne. He was in the Secretary Mexican Legation in Washington, D.C. in 1849.

Biography
Prince Salvador was two years old when he became a Mexican Prince and was styled Highness by the Mexican Congress. He had nine brothers and sisters; Prince Imperial Agustín Jerónimo, Princess Sabina, Princess Juana, Princess Josefa, Prince Ángel, Princess María, Princess Dolores, Prince Felipe, and Prince Agustín Cosme. He was educated at Collège Sainte-Barbe, Paris, as well as in Vienna.

Salvador was the third in line to the throne, after his brother Ángel de Iturbide y Huarte. When Maximilian I of Mexico was crowned emperor, he contacted the Iturbide family to ask for the adoption of two boys: His Highness, Agustín de Iturbide y Green, son of Ángel, and His Highness Salvador de Iturbide y Marzán, son of Salvador.

He drowned in a boating accident on the Tepic River, Nayarit, on 7 June 1856.
