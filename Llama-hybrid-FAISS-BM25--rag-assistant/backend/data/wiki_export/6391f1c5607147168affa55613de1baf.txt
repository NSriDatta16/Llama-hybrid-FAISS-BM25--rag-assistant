After additional escort duty along the eastern seaboard, she departed Charleston, South Carolina, on 6 November to escort slow-moving convoy CK-4 to Plymouth, England. She arrived on 5 December, then sailed a week later, escorting ships and landing craft damaged during the Normandy invasion, back to the United States.

George W. Ingram reached New York on 12 January 1945.

After escorting a captured Italian submarine from Portsmouth, New Hampshire to New London, Connecticut, George W. Ingram was re-designated APD-43 on 23 February.

She supported additional landings by American troops at Chefoo and Tsingtao, China, before departing Tsingtao on 17 October. She steamed via Okinawa, Eniwetok, and Pearl Harbor to the West Coast, arriving at San Diego on 11 November.
