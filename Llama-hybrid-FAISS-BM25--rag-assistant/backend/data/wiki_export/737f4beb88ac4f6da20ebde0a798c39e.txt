Success with Mohammedan

Sabbir joined Mohammedan in 1987. And he played a key role in MSC winning the double, the Federation Cup plus the Dhaka league title. In the Federation Cup final they defeated their great rival of the 1950s, Dhaka Wanderers 1–0. In the league the MSC side trailed Abahani for most of season, but following an impressive 3–2 victory for MSC   in the final match of the regular season, the two teams were tied at the top. The 1st replay saw a 0–0 draw but Mohammedan clinched the title after a 2–0 victory in the 2nd replay.

He has also represented Mohammedan at the 1988–89 and 1989–90 seasons of the Asian Club Championship.

For the national team
In the national team Sabbir formed a partnership with the Abahani striker Sheikh Mohammad Aslam, and the two combined to produce many important goals for the national side. For example, a cross by Sabbir helped Aslam score a headed goal against Iran, at Dhaka, in a FIFA World Cup qualifier in early 1989. Bangladesh lost 2–1. The missed penalty by Sabbir in the first half proved decisive. The team was more successful in the President's Cup final later that year. There, Aslam scored, heading a Sabbir corner to give Bangladesh the lead against a South Korea side; and although the visitors equalized, Bangladesh prevailed in the penalty shootout.

Sabbir scored his last goal for the national team against Thailand on 5 May 1993, but Bangladesh lost 1–4. He played a total of twenty matches for the national team and appeared in his last match at the Al Maktoum Stadium in UAE, against Sri Lanka on 7 May 1993.

Before joining Mohammedan, Sabbir began his professional career at Sheikh Jamal Dhanmondi Club. He appeared with Dhanmondi from 1985 to 1987. At his peak, Sabbir was regarded as one of the country's finest winger. After his second stint with Dhaka Mohammedan, he signed with Rahmatganj MFS in 1997.
