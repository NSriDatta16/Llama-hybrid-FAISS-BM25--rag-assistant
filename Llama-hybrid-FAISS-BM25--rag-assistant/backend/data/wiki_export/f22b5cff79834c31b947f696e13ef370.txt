Wild Again (May 22, 1980 – December 5, 2008) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse by Icecapade out of Bushel-N-Peck (by Khaled). He was broken  by Tommy Akin, but for the majority of his career was trained by Vincent Timphony. Wild Again was bred in Kentucky by W. Paul Little and owned by Black Chip Stables, a nom de course for the racing partnership of Texans William Allen and Ron Volkman and the Californian Terry Beall. Wild Again is most famous for winning the inaugural Breeders' Cup Classic in 1984 over Slew o' Gold and Gate Dancer in a famous stretch run where all three battled head-to-head to the finish line.  In a thrilling conclusion to the richest race in history during that time, long shot Wild Again survived both a wild bumping match in the stretch with Slew o' Gold and Gate Dancer and a steward's inquiry to win the $3 million Breeders' Cup Classic at Hollywood Park Racetrack.   The three battled down the stretch with Wild Again bearing out and shifting his path away from the rail and Gate Dancer "lugging in" towards the rail, squeezing out Slew O' Gold. Wild Again finished a head in front of Gate Dancer with Slew o' Gold less than a length behind.

Wild Again, ridden by substitute jockey Pat Day, ended up in front by a head over Gate Dancer and Slew o' Gold - sandwiched between the two for the final furlong - was third by one-half length.  After the long steward's inquiry, Slew o' Gold was moved up to second because of interference by Gate Dancer, the Preakness Stakes winner. Steward Alfred Shelhamer pointed out in the films that Wild Again's path through the stretch didn't waver more than six inches.

"If you look at the harrow marks in the track," said Shelhamer, "you'll notice Wild Again never leaves his path, but Gate Dancer comes over quite a bit at the sixteenth pole and bothers both horses."

The dark brown colt ran in 28 races in his four-year career, winning 8, placing 7 times, and coming in third on four occasions.

Year by year record:
1982  = 7: 2-3-0  -- $33,700
1983 = 1: 0-0-0   -- $0
1984 = 16: 6-1-4 -- $2,054,409
1985 = 4: 0-3-0   -- $116,720
Totals = 28: 8-7-4  -- $2,204,829

Aside from winning the first Breeders' Cup Classic, to which he had to be supplemented for a fee of $360,000, Wild Again won the Grade I Meadowlands Cup Handicap, the Grade II New Orleans Handicap and the Grade II Oaklawn Handicap in which he broke the track record by almost two seconds.
