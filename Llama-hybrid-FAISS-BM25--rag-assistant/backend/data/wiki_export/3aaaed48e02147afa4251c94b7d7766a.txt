History
The first European visitors to the Savannah, Georgia area arrived in 1526. James Oglethorpe established the city of Savannah in 1733. By the mid-eighteenth century, rice planters were farming much of the land that is now part of the refuge.  The old rice levees, which were built by hand, form the basis for current impoundment dikes.  Remnants of the original rice field trunk water control structures and narrow dikes are still visible in some places.  Within the impoundment system there are 36 historic and prehistoric archeological sites which have been located and inventoried.
