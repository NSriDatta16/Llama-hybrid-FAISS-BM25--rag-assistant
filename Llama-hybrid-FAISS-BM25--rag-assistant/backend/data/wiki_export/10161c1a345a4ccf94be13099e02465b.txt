History
The town of Rudo was established in 1555 by Sokollu Mustafa Pasha, a close relative of Ottoman Vizier Sokollu Mehmed Pasha. A stone mosque, bridge over the Lim, hamam, inn, mekteb (school), tekke, some shops and houses were built. It was mentioned by Evliya Çelebi (1611–1682). It was flooded in 1896, and then expanded into an urban settlement. Following the collapse of the Republic of Užice and the time spent in the village of Drenova leader of Yugoslav Partisans arrived to Rudo on 21 December 1941. The 1st Proletarian Brigade of the Yugoslav Partisans was established in Rudo on 22 December 1941. A monument dedicated to the Brigade was erected in 1961, with a museum subsequently being opened a decade later.
