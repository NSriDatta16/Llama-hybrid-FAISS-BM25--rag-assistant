Gangland is the twenty-first studio album by the band Kool & the Gang, released in 2001 following a five-year gap between albums. The album was a compilation of rappers backed by Kool and the Gang remaking some of the band's songs.

Critical reception 
With a 2.5 out of 4 star rating, Steve Jones of USA Today wrote "Years before Kool rode vocalist James 'J.T.' Taylor's voice to pop success with songs such as Celebration, Cherish and Fresh, they were Hollywood-swinging with such street-oriented anthems as Jungle Boogie and Let the Music Take Your Mind. It's a freshened-up version of the latter funk-fueled jams that propel this new, hard-grooving set. The fusion of rap, jazz and R&B finds the band -- led by founding brothers Robert "Kool" Bell on bass and saxophonist Khalis Bayyan (Ronald Bell) -- joining an engaging pool of young talents."
