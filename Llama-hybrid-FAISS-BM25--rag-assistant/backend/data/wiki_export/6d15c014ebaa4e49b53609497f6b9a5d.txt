Howth station ( ; ), is a railway station in Fingal, Ireland that serves Howth village and one side of Howth Head.

History
The station opened on 30 May 1847. The Howth tram ran between here and Sutton railway station (all the way around Howth Head) until 1959. Within the station buildings (although not accessible from the platforms) are a bar and restaurant and a convenience store.

Operations
Howth is a two-platform terminal station.  Due to the lack of a run-round or turntable facility, on the rare occasion that a locomotive-hauled train arrives (such as on a railtour), a second locomotive must follow the train light engine from Dublin to haul the train back from Howth.

The ticket office is open from 05:45-00:30 AM, Monday to Sunday.
