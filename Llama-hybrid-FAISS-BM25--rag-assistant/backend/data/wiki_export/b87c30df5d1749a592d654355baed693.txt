Heaven and Hull is the final solo album by Mick Ronson, released in 1994, following Ronson's death the previous year. It featured collaborations by longtime friends of Ronson including David Bowie, Joe Elliott, and Ian Hunter.  Other artists included Martin Chambers and Chrissie Hynde, Phil Collen and John Mellencamp.  The "All the Young Dudes" track on Heaven and Hull is from the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, where Ronson was suffering from cancer. It was his last concert.

On the CD notes, there is a quote from Sham Morris, one of the album's producers:   "During the making of Heaven and Hull (working title To Hull and Back), I asked Mick to visualize a characteristic from his home town of Hull.  His first thought was the Humber Bridge. The bridge became very symbolic for those of us working on the album and it was his wish to incorporate it in the artwork.  Mick has crossed the bridge now and left us this swan song." It is worth noting that the bridge actually shown in the album artwork is not the Humber Bridge.

Two songs from the album, "Midnight Love" and "Like a Rolling Stone" were included in the 2017 feature-length biographical documentary, and compilation Soundtrack, entitled Beside Bowie: The Mick Ronson Story.
