C Bear and Jamal is an animated musical comedy children's television series that originally aired on the Fox Kids programming block from 1996 to 1997. It centers on an elementary school-aged boy named Jamal and his companion "C Bear", an orange hip-hop teddy bear who raps. Film Roman co-produced the show.

Characters 
 Jamal Harrison Wingo (Arthur Reggie III) - Jamal is a cheerful, imaginative 9-year-old (later 10-year-old) African-American boy. He always keeps C Bear by his side.
 C Bear (Tone Loc) - C Bear is a wise rapping teddy bear with a hip-hop style. He comes to life whenever Jamal is around and is always ready to give him advice. He has the power to take Jamal on magical adventures at the snap of his finger. C Bear sometimes breaks the fourth wall with sarcastic remarks to the audience.
 Hawthorne Wingo (George L. Wallace) - Hawthorne is Jamal’s father. He sometimes wonders why Jamal still keeps C Bear. Hawthorne's wife passed away before the events of the series.
 Bernice Wingo (Dawnn Lewis) - Bernice is Jamal's grandmother. She is kind hearted and gentle, and is most often seen cooking meals for her family.
 Willis Wingo (Darryl Sivad) - Willis is Jamal's grandfather and the husband of Bernice. He is bald and rarely leaves his chair by the television.
 Maya (Kim Fields) - Maya is Jamal’s classmate and love interest. She is bold and outspoken, and has a loud voice. She is the smartest of Jamal’s friends, often getting the highest test scores in class.
 Big Chill (Aries Spears) - Big Chill is Jamal’s fat friend, who is always hungry and speaks like he has a cold. Upon entering a room, he'll say "the b-i-g c-h-i-double-l is in the hizzouse". Big Chill has been held back in school a few times. Though his exact age is unknown, he is old enough to drive a car and, in one episode, mentions filling out tax forms.
 Kwame (Aries Spears) Kwame is Jamal's best friend. He is dressed in African clothes and believes in "power to the people". He has a tendency to label anything and everything as a "conspiracy by 'The Man'”. He is the second smartest of Jamal’s friends.
 Chipster (Jeannie Elias) - Chipster is Jamal's Caucasian friend. He is silly and likes to make his friends laugh.
 Kim (Margaret Cho) - Kim is Jamal's Asian friend and Maya’s best friend. She is feisty and quick to stand up to anyone who bullies her friends.
 Javier (Paul Rodríguez) - Javier is Jamal's Latino friend. He has a wide vocabulary, often using big words that Jamal and his friends barely understand. He is the third smartest in class, achieving the second highest grades after Maya.
 Miss Fine - Miss Fine is Jamal’s teacher. She is kind but firm, always pushing her students to do their best.
 Sooner - Sooner is the Wingos’ basset hound and C Bear’s rival. Sooner and C Bear often engage in cartoonish chases and fights, which are usually won by C Bear.
