Pink Cream 69 is a German hard rock/heavy metal band founded in 1987 in Karlsruhe by Andi Deris, Dennis Ward, Kosta Zafiriou and Alfred Koffler. The band gained their first contract by winning music magazine Metal Hammers newcomer competition in Ludwigsburg one year after forming. In 1994, Andi Deris left the band to join German power metal band Helloween. He was replaced by British singer David Readman in August 1994.

The band, often referred to as The Pinkies, became a five-piece in 2003, when Uwe Reitenauer was hired to support neuropathic guitar player Alfred Koffler.

On 5 March 2012 it was announced that drummer Kosta Zafiriou had left the band, due to his various activities as a manager at the company Bottom Row and as the drummer and manager of the new band Unisonic. He was replaced by Chris Schmidt.

In 2019 and 2020, respectively, bassist Dennis Ward and guitarist Uwe Reitenauer announced their departure from the band. They were replaced by Roman Beselt (from the band Sons of Sounds) and Marco Wriedt (from the bands 21 Octayne, Arc of Light, Axxis).
