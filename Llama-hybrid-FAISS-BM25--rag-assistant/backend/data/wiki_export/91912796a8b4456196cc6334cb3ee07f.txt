Pindjur or pinjur or pinđur (, ,  , ) is a relish form and is commonly used as a summer spread. Pindjur is commonly prepared in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Bulgaria, Serbia and North Macedonia.

The traditional ingredients include red bell peppers, tomatoes, garlic, vegetable oil, salt, and often eggplant. Pindjur is similar to ajvar, but the latter is smoother, usually has a stronger taste, and is rarely made with eggplant. In some regions the words are used interchangeably.

The creation of this traditional relish is a rather long process which involves baking some of the ingredients for hours, as well as roasting the peppers and peeling them.
