"Stir It Up" is a song composed by Bob Marley in 1967 and first recorded by the group Bob Marley and the Wailers that year and issued as a single. It was later covered by American singer Johnny Nash on his 1972 album I Can See Clearly Now. The following year, Marley and the Wailers re-recorded the song for their album Catch a Fire.

The band performed "Stir It Up" on The Old Grey Whistle Test in 1973 during their first trip to the UK, singing live over a Chris Blackwell overdubbed backing track.

"Stir It Up" was the first Marley-written song to be successful outside Jamaica. Another tune written by Bob Marley, "I Shot The Sheriff", was covered by Eric Clapton on the album 461 Ocean Boulevard, July 1974. Marley's first international hit recorded by him, "No Woman No Cry", was released on the Bob Marley and the Wailers album Live!, December 1975.

Haddaway version

In 1994, Trinidadian-German Eurodance artist Haddaway released his version of "Stir It Up" as the second single from his debut album, The Album (1993). It was only released in the US.

Critical reception
Troy J. Augusto from Cash Box wrote, "Hot new Arista singer (where have we heard that one before?) Haddaway looks to recover from the disappointment of last single, “Life”, with this solid cover of one of Bob Marley’s most beloved songs. The cut’s producers add a contemporary, almost techno-pop feel to the song (Marley’s surely bumpin’ in his grave!), but the tune’s solid arrangement and Haddaway’s likable voice translate to a crossover hit waiting to happen. Hit radio will stir it up soon."
