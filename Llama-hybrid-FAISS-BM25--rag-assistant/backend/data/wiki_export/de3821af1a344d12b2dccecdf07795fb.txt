Weird Little Boy is a one-off album by a band of the same name, performed by John Zorn (alto saxophone, keyboards, samplers), Trey Spruance (guitar, drums, keyboards), William Winant (percussion), Mike Patton (drums, vocals) and Chris Cochrane (guitar). It was released in 1998 on the Japanese label Avant.

Weird Little Boy is regarded by fans (as well as by the actual performers) as the best/worst thing that could have resulted from the meeting of this eclectic mix of artists. Every performer on the recording has at some point professed their distaste for the project. Most vocal on this subject was Trey Spruance.

Reception

The Allmusic review by Bradley Torreano awarded the album 3 stars noting that "This is not for fans of jazz, or fans of anything really. This is a brutal noise experience for listeners interested in how far sonic technology can really be stretched and twisted. It is also very captivating music, and given time it can really sustain interest. Just make sure to listen to it when you have time to digest the whole package".
