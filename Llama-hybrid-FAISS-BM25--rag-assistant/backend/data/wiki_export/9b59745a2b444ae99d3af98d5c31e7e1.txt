Fuzzy is the debut studio album by American rock band Grant Lee Buffalo, released in 1993 by Slash Records. According to the band's website, "Fuzzy would galvanize the sound of Grant Lee Buffalo, i.e., the acoustic feedback howl of overdriven 12-string guitars, melodic distorto-bass, tribal drum bombast, the old world churn of pump organs and parlor pianos."

R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe praised Fuzzy as "the best album of the year hands down". Noel Gallagher of English rock band Oasis revealed in 2022 that the title track was an influence on the band's 1995 hit "Some Might Say".
