He earned his Master of Theology at Dallas Theological Seminary in 1985 and earned a Doctorate of Ministry from Dallas Seminary in 2003. In recognition of his doctoral work, Michael received the John G. Mitchell Award for outstanding scholarship and effectiveness in ministry.

Before becoming president of the Moody Bible Institute, Easley served as a pastor for twenty-four years, beginning as a youth pastor intern at Trinity Fellowship in Dallas, Texas.

He has also stood against the TNIV's gender inclusive language.

On May 16, 2008, Easley resigned from Moody due to continuing back troubles, which he felt were impeding his abilities to be an effective president. His successor, Dr. Paul Nyquist, became the ninth president of Moody Global Ministries on October 23, 2009.
