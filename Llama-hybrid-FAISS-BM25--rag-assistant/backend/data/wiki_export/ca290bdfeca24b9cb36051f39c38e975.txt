The F-Cell is a hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle developed by Daimler AG.

The first generation F-Cell was introduced in 2002, and had a range of , with a top speed of . The current B-Class F-CELL has a more powerful electric motor rated at , and a range of about . This improvement in range is due in part to the B-Class's greater space for holding tanks of compressed hydrogen, higher storage pressure, as well as fuel cell technology advances. Both cars have made use of a "sandwich" design concept, aimed at maximizing room for both passengers and the propulsion components. The fuel cell is a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), designed by the Automotive Fuel Cell Cooperation (AFCC) Corporation.
