Shady View Terrace / The Lawrence Arms split EP is a punk rock EP by the Branchville, New Jersey band Shady View Terrace and the Chicago, Illinois band The Lawrence Arms. It was originally released in 2000 by Castaway Records on CD format, and was re-released later that same year by Asian Man Records. Both are currently out of print, however all of the Lawrence Arms tracks have been reissued on the B-sides album Cocktails & Dreams.

Background
Paul of Castaway Records contacted The Lawrence arms and asked them if they wanted to do a split. It was the label's first release, and he paid for them to record. It marks the first time The Lawrence Arms recorded with Matt Allison, who they would go on to record with for all their other releases. On the other half of the split was the New Jersey emo band, Shady View Terrace. They mixed emotional lyrics about failed relationships with clean and screaming vocals. Castaway Records soon fell apart, and Asian Man Records re-released it. The artwork was designed by math-nerd Ricardo Saporta.
