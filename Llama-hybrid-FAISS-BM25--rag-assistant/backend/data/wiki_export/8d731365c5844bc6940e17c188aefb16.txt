The 2004 NBA playoffs was the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association's 2003–04 season. The tournament concluded with the Eastern Conference champion Detroit Pistons defeating the Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers four games to one in the NBA Finals. Chauncey Billups was named NBA Finals MVP.

Overview
The 2004 playoffs was the first appearance for the Memphis Grizzlies in their nine year history which began in Vancouver. However, they failed to win a single game in their first 3 playoff appearances (2004, 2005, 2006), before earning their first playoff game and series victories in 2011.

The Minnesota Timberwolves, entered their eighth consecutive post season.

The Denver Nuggets made the playoffs for the first time since 1995.

The New Orleans Hornets made their final postseason appearance as a member of the East. They would not make the playoffs again until 2008, as a member of the West (the result of a realignment with the addition of the Charlotte Bobcats in the 2004–05 NBA season). Their playoff series with the Miami Heat, led by Dwyane Wade, was the last playoff series where the home team won all seven games until 2008's Boston–Atlanta and Boston–Cleveland playoff series.

The Houston Rockets made playoffs for the first time since 1999. As a result, 2004 was the first time in 14 years that all Texas teams made the playoffs, and the second time (first in ten years) that all former ABA teams made the playoffs. This was Steve Francis' only career playoff appearance.

This was the first postseason since 1998 without Allen Iverson or Tracy McGrady.

The Miami Heat and the New York Knicks both made the playoffs for the first time since 2001. This marked Dwyane Wade’s first postseason appearance and the start of four straight playoff appearances for the Heat. For the Knicks, on the other hand, this was their last appearance until 2011.

The Portland Trail Blazers and Utah Jazz missed the playoffs for the first time since 1982 and 1983, respectively.

Game 4 of the Spurs–Grizzlies series was the last NBA game ever played Pyramid Arena. That game and Game 3 of the same series were the only playoff games to take place in The Pyramid before the Grizzlies moved to FedExForum in the autumn of 2004.

With their series win over the Denver Nuggets, the Minnesota Timberwolves won their first playoff series in franchise history.

With their first round series loss to the Sacramento Kings, the Dallas Mavericks lost a first round playoff series for the first time since 1990. As of 2023, this remains the Kings’ most recent series victory.

Game 5 of the Spurs–Lakers series was extremely notable for both teams’ last shots. Tim Duncan scored a two–pointer to give the Spurs a 73–72 lead with 0.4 seconds remaining. However, Derek Fisher would hit the game winning shot as time expired to give the Lakers a 74–73 victory in San Antonio.

With their conference semifinals victory over the Miami Heat, the Indiana Pacers made the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time since their NBA Finals run in 2000, after which they significantly changed the makeup of their team (yet still made the playoffs every year).

With their conference semifinals victory over the Sacramento Kings, the Minnesota Timberwolves made their first conference finals appearance in franchise history. As of 2023, this remains the Timberwolves’ most recent series victory.

Game 2 of the Pistons–Pacers series was notable for Tayshaun Prince’s block of Reggie Miller’s late game layup.

Game 6 of the Timberwolves–Lakers series was the last Minnesota Timberwolves postseason game until 2018.

With their Conference Finals win over the Indiana Pacers, the Detroit Pistons made the NBA Finals for the first time since 1990.

In a shocking upset, the Detroit Pistons beat the Los Angeles Lakers in five games to win the NBA Championship.
