Plot
Laurel & Hardy try to sleep in a rented room. Oliver, suffering from a cold, coughs frequently, while Stan snores. Both of them have trouble falling asleep because of this. They try to solve their problems, but this results in total chaos. The owner of the room (played by Charlie Hall) threatens to throw them out. When the duo are back in their room, their air mattress is filled up accidentally with gas and blown up so big that Stan and Ollie are pressed against the ceiling. After they have realised the trouble they are in, they start to panic, at which point Oliver sneezes and the mattress explodes. The hotel owner and police officers enter the room and Oliver sneezes again collapsing the ceiling.

Production
