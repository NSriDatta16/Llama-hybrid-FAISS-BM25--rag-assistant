Grbić started with the senior national team in 1991, when he was 18 years old. For the next couple of years (1992–1994), he was unable to play due to an international embargo.  

Yugoslavia, with Grbić, won the bronze medal at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. Grbić was honored as the European Championship Best Setter in 1997 as Yugoslavia earned the silver medal. In 1998, he led Yugoslavia to the silver medal at the FIVB World Championship.

Grbić then helped Serbia win the bronze medal at the 2010 FIVB World Championship in Italy, where he was named Best Setter of the tournament.
