Reception

Mickey's Racing Adventure received positive reviews from critics. IGN reviewer Craig Harris felt that it was Rare's "first real quality Game Boy Color-exclusive title" after their "atrocious" Conker's Pocket Tales, while GameSpot praised the number of tracks and characters to choose from, stating that Mickey's Racing Adventure "shows how Game Boy racers should be done". N64 Magazine said that the game successfully combines the exploration aspects of Rare's Diddy Kong Racing with the racing style of R.C. Pro-Am for the Nintendo Entertainment System, but criticised the lack of a multiplayer mode. Game Informer gave the game an overall score of 8 out of 10 noting the game being well designed, especially for a Disney game, and commenting that the game has plenty of racing courses, characters, power ups and vehicle upgrades concluding "Mickey's Racing Adventure won't take you an exorbitant amount of time to finish, but youâ€™ll like it all the way to the end".
