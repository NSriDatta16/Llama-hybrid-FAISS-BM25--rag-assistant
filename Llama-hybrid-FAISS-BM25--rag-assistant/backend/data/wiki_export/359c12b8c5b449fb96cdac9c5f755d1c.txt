In 1510, some of the Armenians, who were exposed to the pressure of the Safavid ruler Shah Ismail, settled around Talas. Talas later became one of the important Armenian settlements in Anatolia until its eventual destruction and evacuation in 1915 by members of the late Ottoman Empire. Following the establishment of Turkish Republic, Greeks in this region were deported to Greece by ships via Tarsus and Silifke during the Population exchange between Greece and Turkey. Today, there is a negligible presence of Armenian or Greek population in Talas.

A more traditional Anatolian village aesthetic of older single family homes and gardens dominates the southern portion of Talas while the northern section is predominantly high-rise housing - much of which was initially developed by TOKİ.
