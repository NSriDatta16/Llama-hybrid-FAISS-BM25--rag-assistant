Vemb-Lemvig-Thyborøn Jernbane (VLTJ) or Lemvigbanen is a Danish railway line in Northwest Jutland. Established in 1879, the line extends from Vemb via Lemvig to Thyborøn. The single-track line is mostly level, and is operated with a fleet of five double-unit Y-train railcars. VLTJ has its own workshop and servicing facilities on the line.

Until 1 January 2008, the line was operated by the company Vemb-Lemvig-Thyborøn Jernbane A/S, which has been merged with Odderbanen's operating company to form Midtjyske Jernbaner.

The railway was used to test a prototype hydrogen-powered train in 2010.

Popular culture 
The railway achieved fame in Denmark, when the band Tørfisk in 1985 wrote the song "VLTJ" describing a trip with the railway. This song later achieved cult status.
The song is based on the Irish folk song "Poor Paddy works on the Railway".
