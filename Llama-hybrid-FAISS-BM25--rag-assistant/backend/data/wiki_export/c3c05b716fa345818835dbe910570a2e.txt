John Joseph Mizerock (; born December 8, 1960) is an American former Major League Baseball backup catcher for the Houston Astros and the Atlanta Braves. He was the eighth overall pick in the 1979 Major League Baseball Draft. He later served as a coach for the Kansas City Royals and Philadelphia Phillies. He is currently the hitting coach for the Clearwater Threshers.

Houston Astros
The Houston Astros drafted eighteen-year-old Mizerock straight out of Punxsutawney High School in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. He was the second of five catchers selected in the first round of the June  draft. After four seasons in their farm system, in which he batted .228 with eighteen home runs (twelve of which were hit in ) and 143 runs batted in, Mizerock made the Astros out of Spring training  as Alan Ashby's back-up. He allowed three passed balls in a game against the Cincinnati Reds on April 19 to not only lose the back-up catcher job, but to also get himself sent back down to the minors. In fairness to Mizerock, knuckleballer Joe Niekro was pitching.

After Ashby was lost for a month of the season with a viral infection in his ear, Mizerock was called back up. However, he only appeared in four games during that span, and was optioned back down to the triple A Tucson Toros upon Ashby's return. He was brought back up for a third time in mid-August, and remained on the major league roster through the end of the season. He had a second game with Niekro on the mound on August 31 in which he had two passed balls. In all, Mizerock had eleven passed balls for the season; eight of which occurred with Niekro pitching.

After spending all of the  season with the double A Columbus Astros, he returned to Houston late in the  season to fill in for an injured Ashby. He was with the Astros on and off throughout their division winning  season, and was on their post-season roster, but did not make an appearance in the 1986 National League Championship Series against the New York Mets. He was released after the season.

Atlanta Braves
Mizerock spent spring training  with the Montreal Expos, but failed to make the club. Just as the season was set to begin, he signed with the Atlanta Braves. Mizerock batted .240 with eight home runs and 94 RBIs in three seasons with the Richmond Braves to earn a September call-up to Atlanta in . He batted .222 with two RBIs in eleven games. After one more season in the Braves' minor league system, Mizerock retired.
