This is a list of the 100 busiest airports in Europe, ranked by total passengers per year, including both terminal and transit passengers. Data is for 2021 with a partial population of 2022 as statistics are released and is sourced individually for each airport and from a variety of sources, but normally the national aviation authority statistics, or those of the airport operator. 

The tables also show the percentage change in total passengers for each airport over the last year. Lists of the rankings for every year since 2010 are also presented. 

2020 and 2021 numbers are significantly reduced compared to 2019 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused a significant reduction in passenger numbers and aircraft movements.
