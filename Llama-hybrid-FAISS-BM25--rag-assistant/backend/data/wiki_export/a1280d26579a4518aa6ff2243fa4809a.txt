Personal life
Mann has related her conversion to Buddhism:
"I was sort of unconsciously on a bit of a path... I was doing a show called 'Janus'... I just reached a point that my spirit, my consciousness, had said, "Tracy, enough, Now you have to get it... And I had five weeks off of filming 'Janus' and went to Nepal... to go to a monastery to study Buddhism."
