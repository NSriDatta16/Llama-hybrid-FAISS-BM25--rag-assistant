Stephen Pool Waltrip High School is a public high school located at 1900 West 34th Street in Houston, Texas, United States, 77018.

Waltrip, which serves grades 9 through 12, is a part of the Houston Independent School District.

Waltrip has Houston ISD's Research and Technology magnet program.

The school's namesake is a former principal at the defunct Houston Heights High School, who transferred to Reagan High School (now renamed Heights High School) after that school replaced the original Houston Heights High.

History

Waltrip High School opened in 1960 to serve many newly developed post-World War II subdivisions, and relieved Reagan High School of many students when it did so. It was relieved by Scarborough Junior-Senior High School when that school opened in 1969. The school was named after Stephen Pool Waltrip, a funeral home owner in the Houston Heights named  principal of Reagan High School in 1918.

The school remained majority white until the  early 1990s, when the school was equally white, black, and Hispanic.

In 1997 a portion of the Reagan High School boundary was rezoned to Waltrip. By the 2000s, Waltrip became majority Hispanic.

Waltrip has become one of the highest performing comprehensive high schools in Houston ISD by being named "Recognized" by the Texas Education Agency, one of the few urban high schools in Houston ISD to receive such a designation.  (Reference:  Texas Education Agency website).

Around 2012, each year a total of 400 students transfer from Booker T. Washington High School to Waltrip and Reagan.

In 2015 Andria Schur got a job as the principal of a charter school in Dallas, Texas, causing her to leave her post as principal of Waltrip. Dale Mitchell, previously the principal of Sterling High School, became the principal of Waltrip.

The campus began receiving a renovation around 2015.
