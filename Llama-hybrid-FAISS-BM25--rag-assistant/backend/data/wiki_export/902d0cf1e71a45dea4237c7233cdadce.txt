History

The New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad originally had two stations in Mount Vernon. Mount Vernon (Prospect Avenue) was located between 3rd Avenue and Park Avenue, slightly west of the modern station. Columbus Avenue station was located about  to the east at Columbus Avenue. It was a transfer point to the New York, Westchester and Boston Railway â€“ one of five NYW&B stations within the city.  The station building was destroyed by a fire on March 31, 1957, though trains continued to stop.

Penn Central closed the two stations and replaced them with the Mount Vernon station on December 20, 1972. The new station was built with two high-level  side platforms, allowing the new M2 cars to platform at the station. The two old stations were subsequently demolished.

Stained glass artwork named Tranquility by Marjorie Blackwell was installed in 2001. The station stood in for the Rockville Centre station during the filming of the 2004 movie Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.
