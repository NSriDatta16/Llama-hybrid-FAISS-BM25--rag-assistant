Once a part of the original Dixie Highway, the former State Road 815 was a 7.76-mile-long northâ€“south route that served - and still serves - as a commuter alternative to the nearby Biscayne Boulevard (US 1-SR 5) that was part of the Florida State Roads system for five decades.  Located entirely in Dade County, SR 815 was locally known as East Second Avenue.  The southern terminus of SR 815 was an intersection of Southeast Second Avenue and Southeast Second Street at the Miami River; the northern terminus was an intersection of Northeast Second Avenue and North Gratigny Road (SR 924).

Route description
State Road 815 started at the intersection of Southeast Second Avenue and Southeast Second Street, just north of the Miami River.  SR 815 took Southeast Second Avenue north, where it became Northeast Second Avenue just two blocks north of the southern terminus at Flagler Street.  SR 815 continued through Central Miami business, intersecting with Interstate 395 and then Interstate 195.  Leaving Central Miami, it continues through residential streets, intersecting SR 944 and SR 934 before leaving Miami for Miami Shores.  Continuing north, it intersects SR 932.  In North Miami, it forms the eastern boundary for Barry University for several blocks before intersecting SR 909 just one block south of the northern terminus of North Gratigny Road (SR 924).

History
State Road 815 was established in the 1945 Florida State Road renumbering.  After the construction and opening of Interstate 95 and the Downtown Distributor (SR 970), traffic patterns in downtown Miami were altered, reducing SR 815's importance.  Despite remaining a commuting and commercial alternative, the significance of SR 815 faded by the 1980s.  First, the designation was removed from the southern half of the route; by 1994 it was barely noted on AAA and Rand McNally road maps; the following year, the Florida Department of Transportation transferred SR 815 maintenance responsibilities to Dade (now Miami-Dade) County control.
