Facebook controversy
In 2007 Dudley-Eshbach posted several pictures on her Facebook profile, among which was a picture of Dudley-Eshbach pointing a stick toward her daughter and a Hispanic man. The caption underneath the picture read that she had to "beat off the Mexicans because they were constantly flirting with my daughter."

After being contacted by the media, which had been alerted by upset students, Dudley-Eshbach removed the photos and issued the following statement: "Many of us are learning about the positives and negatives of public networking sites such as Facebook. I regret that some of these family vacation photos, with captions that were only intended to be humorous, were included on Facebook. I did not intend for these photos to end up in the public domain, and I am grateful that this was brought to my attention. I sincerely apologize for any offense anyone may have taken."

In an interview with the Washington Post Dudley-Eshbach said, "Somebody said that the fact that I was apparently going to hit a Mexican, that that was racism. That's not the way it was intended. Frankly, I think the media locally here is trying to make a sensational story about something that was, on our part, innocent. The truth is, I am a very fun-loving person. What we were doing was having fun. There was nothing immoral, there was nothing illegal, there was nothing illicit."
