Pitzer College presidency
Trombley was inaugurated as president of Pitzer College in February 2003. In her first year in office, she made the SAT an optional criterion for admission to the college.

During Trombley's presidency, Pitzer founded the Robert Redford Conservancy for Southern California Sustainability, the Firestone Center for Restoration Ecology in Costa Rica, and the Vaccine Development Institute's partnership with the University of Botswana.

During her tenure, the college's student participation in overseas study increased from 49% to 80% and over 50 student exchanges were established. The admission acceptance rate declined from 56 percent to 11 percent, and the college moved up 35 places in the U.S. News & World Report rankings, from no. 70 in 2004 to no. 35 in 2014.

Trombley established three endowments: the John Skandera student financial aid fund for first generation students, the Laura Skandera Trombley endowment, and the Laura Skandera Trombley Humanities and Arts Endowed Research and Internship Fund.

Trombley's resignation was announced in December 2014, effective June 30, 2015. In June 2015, the faculty made a vote of no confidence, citing concerns about the lack of shared governance during her administration, as a "message to prospective presidential candidates that Pitzer takes issues of shared governance seriously".

In her first year, she raised $39.4 million, a $9 million increase over the previous year. The Huntington also reached a new high of nearly 40,000 member families and 725,759 visitors. Trombley modified the plan for the final phase of the Chinese Garden, adding a restaurant, outdoor entertainment space, and an art gallery, and completed funding for the 20-year project, with gifts totaling $12 million. In addition, she planned and received a $2.5 million gift for a Director of Research home to be built on the grounds of The Huntington, its first LEED certified building.

She worked to establish internal sustainability and water conservation efforts; organized the first institutional sustainability summit; and signed an agreement with the University of California, Riverside to subsidize the hiring of two assistant professors who will research full-time in The Huntington's collections.

Trombley created the first institutional dashboard; instituted The Huntington Channel to archive videos and webcasts for the public; and created the Out of the Vault Series, to heighten the Huntington's profile in the southern California region. She instituted San Marino Day and made a $5,000 gift in her father's name to honor San Marino educators. She negotiated a new agreement between The Huntington and USC for The Huntington-USC Institute on California and the West (ICW) and USC-Huntington Early Modern Studies Institute (EMSI).
