Arthur Newell Strahler (February 20, 1918 – December 6, 2002) was a geoscience professor at Columbia University who in 1952 developed the Strahler Stream Order system for classifying streams according to the power of their tributaries.

Strahler was largely responsible for the shift from qualitative to quantitative geomorphology during the mid 20th century.
