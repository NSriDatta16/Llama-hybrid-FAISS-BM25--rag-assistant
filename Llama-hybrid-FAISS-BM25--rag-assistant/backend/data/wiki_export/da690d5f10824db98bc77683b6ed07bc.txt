Geology
Mount Jerai is a 1,217- metre tall inselberg located near the coast of the Strait of Malacca, and is part of an eponymous geological formation that correlates with the Machinchang Formation in the island of Langkawi. The Jerai Formation is originally a sedimentary formation composed of fully metamorphosed sandstone and shale, and it consists of argillite, arenite and porphyry facies.

Insular origins
There is an information board on top of the mountain stating that it used to be an island called Pulai Serai before the sea levels receded letting it form a mountain. This is probably supported by I Ching's record of Pu Lou Shi (Pulau Sri), a country located west of Sribogha.

Tourism

The summit of Jerai has been developed into a  hill resort, and from there tourists can get to enjoy a wide angle view of the surrounding areas, including Penang Island and the rice fields of Yan District.
