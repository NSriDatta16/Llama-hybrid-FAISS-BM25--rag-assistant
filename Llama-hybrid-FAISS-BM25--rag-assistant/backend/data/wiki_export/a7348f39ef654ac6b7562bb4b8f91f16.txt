History

Náměšť was founded around 1220. The first written mention of Náměšť is from 1234, when the castle was owned by the lords of Lomnice. In the 14th and 15th centuries, Náměšť was frequently conquered and destroyed by various armies. In 1304, Náměšť was destroyed by Cumans, in 1408 by the army of Lacko of Kravaře, and during the Hussite Wars by the armies of Sigismund and Albert II.

From 1481 to 1563, Náměšť was owned by the lords of Lomnice again. In 1563, it was acquired by Jan the Elder of Zierotin, who had replaced the old Gothic castle with a new large Renaissance residence. Jan's successor Karl the Elder of Zierotin sold the manor to Albrecht of Wallenstein in 1628, who immediately sold it to the House of Werdenberg. The Werdenberg family owned it until 1733.

From 1752 until the abolition of manorialism, Náměšť was in the possession of the Haugwitz family. The railway was built in 1866. In 1923, Náměšť nad Oslavou was promoted to a town.
