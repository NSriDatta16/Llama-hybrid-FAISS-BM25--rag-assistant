ISO 639 is a standardized nomenclature used to classify languages. Each language is assigned a two-letter (639-1) and three-letter ( and ) lowercase abbreviation, amended in later versions of the nomenclature.

Table

This table lists all of:
 ISO 639-1: two-letter codes, one per language for ISO 639 macrolanguage
And some of:
 ISO 639-2/T: three-letter codes, for the same languages as 639-1
 ISO 639-2/B: three-letter codes, mostly the same as , but with some codes derived from English names rather than native names of languages (in the following table, these differing codes are highlighted in boldface)
 ISO 639-3: three-letter codes, the same as  for languages, but with distinct codes for each variety of an ISO 639 macrolanguage
