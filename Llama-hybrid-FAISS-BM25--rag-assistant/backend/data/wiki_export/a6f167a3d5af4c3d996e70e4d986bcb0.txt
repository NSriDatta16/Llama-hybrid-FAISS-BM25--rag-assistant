J Lloyd Crowe Secondary School (commonly referred to as J.L. Crowe) is a public high school in Trail, British Columbia, and is part of School District 20 Kootenay-Columbia. A new facility was opened in 2009, followed by the demolition of the older school. In the years 2014-2015 the school's enrollment was 850 students. The school serves the local areas including Trail, Rossland, Fruitvale, Warfield, and Montrose.

History
JL Crowe was founded in 1951, after demand grew over the smaller, and aging Trail High School in Downtown Trail.  The shops were extensive as Cominco hosted the largest apprenticeship programme at Crowe in Western Canada. The school also held 1st year Arts and Science classes until 1966 when Selkirk Regional College opened.  It was originally a grades 10-12 plus 1st year Arts & Science, as there were 2 middle schools in the area. Modifications were made to the school during the mid 70s, and 80s, and a bigger library. After 58 years the school was demolished, and a new one was built.

New school
In late 2007, construction of a new school began on the field adjacent to the original school. The new building was opened in September 2009, and demolition of the old building was completed a few weeks later. It came with state of the art technology, including document cameras in most classrooms, and 70 new iPads that were later added for learning use. The new school has a gym, cardio room, weight room, a full science lab, and five classrooms for shop classes, including woodworking, metalworking, and electronics.
