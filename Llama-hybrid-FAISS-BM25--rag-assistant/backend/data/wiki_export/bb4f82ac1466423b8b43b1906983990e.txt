Antoni Wit (born February 7, 1944) is a Polish conductor, composer, lawyer and professor at the Fryderyk Chopin University of Music. Between 2002 and 2013, he served as the artistic director of the National Philharmonic in Warsaw.

Life and career
Wit was born in Kraków. He graduated from the Kraków conservatory (then called Państwowa Wyższa Szkola Muzyczna) in 1967. He studied conducting under Henryk Czyż and composition under Krzysztof Penderecki.  He went on to study in Paris under Nadia Boulanger (1967–68). In 1969, he also graduated in law from the Jagiellonian University in Kraków.

From 2002 to 2013 he was music director of the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra. He also collaborated with the Orquesta Sinfónica de Navarra in Pamplona from the 2010–2011 to the 2016–2017 season, serving as their first guest conductor. In May 2013 he was nominated Artistic Director of the ensemble.

He has conducted the Berlin Philharmonic, Staatskapelle Dresden, the Orchestra dell'Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in Rome, the Zürich Tonhalle Orchestra, the Kraków Philharmonic Orchestra, the Orquestra Simfònica de Barcelona i Nacional de Catalunya, and in London the BBC Symphony Orchestra, Philharmonia Orchestra, and London Philharmonic Orchestra. He has recorded over 90 albums, most of them for the Naxos label, and many of them with the Polish National Radio Symphony Orchestra in Katowice, whose managing and artistic director he was from 1983 to 2000.  He specializes in the works of Polish composers such as Henryk Górecki, Wojciech Kilar, Krzysztof Meyer, Witold Lutosławski, Karol Szymanowski and Krzysztof Penderecki, whose Polish Requiem he recorded in 2004. Wit received a Cannes Classical Award for his album of Olivier Messiaen's Turangalîla Symphony; his recording of Bedřich Smetana's Má vlast cycle was also very well received.

He currently teaches at the Fryderyk Chopin Academy of Music in Warsaw.
