Etymology

The Australian Aboriginal local Birpai people tell a dreamtime story of three brothers who were killed by a witch called Widjirriejuggi and were buried where the mountains stand. The youngest of the three was Dooragan, that now carries the name for one of the national parks.

Coincidentally, when Captain James Cook passed the area on 12 May 1770, he also named the mountains Three Brothers, since "these Hills bore some resemblance to each other". During his apprenticeship with John and Henry Walker, ship owners of Whitby, the second ship Cook served on was named Three Brothers.
