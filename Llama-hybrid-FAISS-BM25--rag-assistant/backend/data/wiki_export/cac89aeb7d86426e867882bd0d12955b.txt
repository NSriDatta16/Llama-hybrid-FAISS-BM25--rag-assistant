Description
Busuioaca is a liqueur wine with a special body, with an unmistakable fragrance, a mixture of rose and basil giving it a special note, rarely found in other aromatic wines. Its aroma is unique, bringing honeysuckle and peach ripe, succulent, with perfect harmony of sugar, alcohol and acidity. Sweet taste sometimes has a bitter sensuous taste of almonds.

The Busuioaca de Bohotin variety is grown in four viticultural centers: Bohotin, Iași County, Huși, Vaslui County, Pietroasele, Buzău County, and Tohani, Prahova County. If we gather the area cultivated with this variety in the four wine-growing centers, we have about 100 hectares, which makes the national production of authentic wine of Busuioaca de Bohotin very little.
