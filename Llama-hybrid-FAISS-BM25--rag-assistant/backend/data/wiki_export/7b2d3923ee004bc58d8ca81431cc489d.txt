The Universidad Station () is a station on Line 2 of the Monterrey Metro. It is located in the Alfonso Reyes Avenue.

This station is next to the campus of the Autonomous University of Nuevo León (UANL – from which it takes its name), and it sees heavy traffic of students on a daily basis.  The station is also the nearest to the Estadio Universitario, the home venue of the UANL Tigres.  It is accessible for people with disabilities.

This station's logo represents the flame and atoms that appear in the logo of the UANL.

This station was inaugurated on October 31, 2007, as part of the first stage of the Line 2 expansion (along with Regina and Niños Heroes Stations). It served as the Line 2 terminus until stage 2 of the Line 2 expansion was completed on October 1, 2008, when Sendero Station took its place as the northern terminus of the line.
