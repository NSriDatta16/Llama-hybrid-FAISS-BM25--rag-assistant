"Roll It Gal" (otherwise known as "Roll It") is a song written by Shontelle Layne and Sheldon Benjamin, and originally recorded by soca singer Alison Hinds, taken from her debut album Soca Queen. The single was released by Hinds in 2005 in Barbados and in the United Kingdom in 2007. A music video was produced for Hinds' version of the song in 2005. The Hinds version of "Roll It Gal" shot to the top of the charts in Barbados, Trinidad and throughout the Caribbean. The song contains a sample of Benjamin's "Big Love".

In 2007, a re-worked cover of the song entitled "Roll It", performed by J-Status and featuring Rihanna, as well as Shontelle, who assisted in writing both versions of the song, was released in several European countries.
