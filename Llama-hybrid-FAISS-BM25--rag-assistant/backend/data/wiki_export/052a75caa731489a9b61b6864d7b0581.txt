Lublin County in the Past 
The history of Lublin County as a separate administrative unit dates back to the late 15th century, when Lublin Voivodeship was carved out of eastern part of Sandomierz Voivodeship. The new voivodeship was made of three counties - Urzedow County, Lukow County and Lublin County, which had the area of 5812 sq. kilometers (as for mid-16th century). Apart from Lublin, other towns of the county were Kazimierz Dolny, Lubartow, Wawolnica, Kurow, Leczna, Konskowola, Belzyce and Parczew. Exact boundary between Urzedow and Lublin counties is difficult to establish, as it varied in different centuries.

Lublin County existed in its original form until the Partitions of Poland. It continued to exist also in the Duchy of Warsaw, Russian-controlled Congress Poland and Second Polish Republic, but its borders were subject to frequent changes, due to several administrative centers.
