Robbinsville High School is a comprehensive community public high school serving students in ninth through twelfth grades from Robbinsville Township, in Mercer County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, operating as the lone secondary school of the Robbinsville Public School District. The school is accredited by the New Jersey Department of Education.

As of the 2021–22 school year, the school had an enrollment of 1,085 students and 82.5 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 13.2:1. There were 30 students (2.8% of enrollment) eligible for free lunch and 10 (0.9% of students) eligible for reduced-cost lunch.

Awards, recognition and rankings
The school was the 59th-ranked public high school in New Jersey out of 339 schools statewide in New Jersey Monthly magazine's September 2014 cover story on the state's "Top Public High Schools", using a new ranking methodology. The school had been ranked 110th in the state of 328 schools in 2012, after being ranked 109th in 2010 out of 322 schools listed. Schooldigger.com ranked the school 43rd out of 389 public high schools statewide in its 2012 rankings, which was based on the combined percentage of students classified as proficient or above proficient on the mathematics (94.4%) and language arts literacy (98.1%) components of the High School Proficiency Assessment (HSPA).

The New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association recognized Robbinsville High School as the Group I winner of the Seventh Annual ShopRite Cup in 2009–10, based on the overall performances of the school's athletic teams which included first-place finishes in boys' cross country and girls' soccer, second place in girls' cross country, third-place finishes in indoor track & field, baseball (tie) and wrestling (tie), along with finishing fourth in both girls' indoor relays and girls' outdoor track and field, with bonus points awarded for not having any disqualifications during the three sports seasons.

History and facilities
There was a great struggle in the community to get the high school approved, and when it was approved, the vote was extremely close, with a referendum passing in 2001 by a 51-49% margin to approve the construction of a $50 million high school building, while a separate ballot for a pool price at $4.4 million was rejected. The school was first opened in 2004 as a wing in the middle school to house ninth graders. The plan was to start with only freshmen and each year fill in an additional grade. In 2005, the new high school building opened.

By the 2006–07 school year, only students in 12th grade from Robbinsville Township were attending Lawrence High School in Lawrence Township, as part of the final year of a sending/receiving relationship with the Lawrence Township Public Schools. With the start of the 2007–08 school year, the sending relationship had ended, and Robbinsville High School began to serve all of Robbinsville Township's high school students on site. The school graduated its first class of 150 students in June 2008.

The school features a large common area with an atrium to serve as a cafeteria as well as several other purposes, an attached music wing, a central hallway which connects the commons area to the four main wings, the kitchen, the black box theater, the 1,000-seat auditorium with a  opera pit, the gymnasium wing (including a main gym, auxiliary gym, the weight room, locker rooms, and the trainer's office), and the main office as well as administrators offices on the first floor and contains much technology including a recording studio.  Outside, there is a rubberized turf football field along with a track, an aerial obstacle course, and numerous sports fields for all seasons.
