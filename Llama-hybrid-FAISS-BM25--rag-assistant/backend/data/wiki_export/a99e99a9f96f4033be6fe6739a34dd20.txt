Season 1976â€“1977 was the 104th season of competitive football in Scotland and the 80th season of Scottish league football.

After the failure of the Spring Cup and the 26-game season in the First and Second Divisions, a 39-game season was instituted in these divisions with a slight imbalance in the number of home and away games played by each team; however, this was seen as preferable to a lengthy 52-game season.
