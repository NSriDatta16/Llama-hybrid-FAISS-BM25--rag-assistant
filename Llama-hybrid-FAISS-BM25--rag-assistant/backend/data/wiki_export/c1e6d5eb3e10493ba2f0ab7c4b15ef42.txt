Olsson started his professional career with hometown club Färjestads BK and in his first season with the team, 1996/97, the team won the Swedish Championship. The following season the team won the Championship again. But Olsson did not play many games in the two season and decide to leave to club and signed with the Norwegian club Stjernen.
