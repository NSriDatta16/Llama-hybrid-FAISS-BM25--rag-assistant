Plot
After the untimely death of her father and step-mother, Sonia is orphaned and lives with her aunt and paternal uncle (General and Mrs. Rajpal Singh). Sonia is plain-looking, like her real mother, and often invites unappreciative taunts and critical remarks from her aunt and cousin, Sheela. Sheela has a boyfriend, Dev Kumar Mehra, and she plans to marry him. Fed-up with hearing frequent taunts and adverse remarks about her plain-looks, Sonia challenges Sheela that she will make Dev fall in love with her.
