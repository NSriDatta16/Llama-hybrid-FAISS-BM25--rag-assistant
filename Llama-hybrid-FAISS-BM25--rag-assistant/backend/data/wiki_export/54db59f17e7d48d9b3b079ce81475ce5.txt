Raffaëla is the debut album by the Dutch 2006 Idols winner Raffaëla. The album was released on 21 April 2006 in the Netherlands and contains songs Raffaëla sung during her Idols career. The album also contains two Dutch songs about pregnancy (as Raffaëla was pregnant) and a duet with Floortje Smit, runner-up on Idols. The album debuted at #1 in the Dutch Mega Album Top 100, but quickly dropped out of the top 20.

Singles information
The first single released from the album was Right Here, Right Now (My Heart Belongs to You), covered from Agnes Carlsson, winner of the Swedish Pop Idol. The song was released the day after the Idols final for digital download only. Three days later, Sony BMG had announced that the song was downloaded over 40,000 times, certifying the single gold before its release: the first time something like this happened. A week after the final, the song was certified platinum, meaning over 80,000 copies were downloaded already. On 17 March 2006, the CD single was released, debuting and peaking at the number one position in the Dutch Top 40 (national Dutch chart, similar to the Billboard Hot 100). "Right Here Right Now" remains her most successful single to date. The second single "Mijn Houten Hart", recorded with Paul de Leeuw, flopped commercially. The single was released on 9 June 2006 and received little promotion. A music video was made for the song, showing Raffaëla and De Leeuw recording the song in a studio, but due to Raffaëla's pregnancy she was unable to further promote the song. The song entered the Dutch Mega Top 100 Singles at #63, rose up to #18 the following week and dropped again to #33 in its third week.
