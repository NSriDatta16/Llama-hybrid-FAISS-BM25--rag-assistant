Exhibits

Flamingo Crossing
A moated island located at the beginning of the zoo that holds the zoo's flock of Caribbean flamingos. The island is lush with bamboo vegetation.

Reptile House
The reptile house was remodeled in 2012. With the renovations the building houses mostly reptiles. The exhibit houses many species of snakes, tortoises and lizards. There are two large areas where the zoo's Komodo dragons are held. In a building located near the Reptile House the zoo's temporary home for a large adult saltwater crocodile and for slender-snouted crocodiles. On the outside of the Reptile House is the new Gator Swamp Exhibit, which is a large outdoor heated pool housing several adult American alligators. The reptile house received more renovations in 2017 to improve digital interpretive signage and interactive displays.

Five Texas horned lizards, born in August 2019 at the Zoo, are now on exhibit in the reptile building. The zoo has been breeding the species since 2017. The Texas horned lizard has disappeared from about half of its historic range due to habitat loss, human eradication of the ant populations that these lizards eat and displacement of native ant populations by invasive fire ants. To date, the zoo has successfully released about 70 young into the wild in Socorro County, New Mexico.
