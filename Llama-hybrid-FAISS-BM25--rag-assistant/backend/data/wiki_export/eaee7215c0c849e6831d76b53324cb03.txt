Le visage de l'amour is the last album Dalida released a year before her death. It was also her first album to be made as a CD format. The name "Le visage de l'amour" is usually used by Dalida to describe her public and her fans, it was picked up by the big French artist Charles Trenet who decided to write a song for Dalida bearing this name. It eventually became the name of her last album.

Dalida didn't promote the album like she used to do for her former releases, appearing only for a week of promotion on French TV.
Subsequently the album failed to chart upon its release but did chart right after Dalida's death in 1987 entering the top 20 for 2 weeks.
The album is a collection of rather moody to sad songs while containing a dance number called "Mama Caraibo" and that was later disregarded by Dalida herself who didn't like the song quality.
Two singles of the album were already released and heavily promoted in 1985 but failed to chart.
Another 2 songs were released and poorly promoted upon the outing of the album but the whole project was a little neglected due to Dalida filming and releasing the most important movie of her career, a picture by Egyptian director Youssef Chahine called Le sixième jour. This movie earned huge positive reviews from movie critics all over the world praising Dalida's performance but the movie was not a commercial success. Nevertheless, this movie remains a strong proof of Dalida's acting talent and a great addition to her legacy.
