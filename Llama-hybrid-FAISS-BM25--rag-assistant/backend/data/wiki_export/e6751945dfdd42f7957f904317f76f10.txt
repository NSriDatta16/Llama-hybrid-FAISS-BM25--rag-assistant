Vector 13 is a comic strip published in the British magazine 2000 AD. It featured the eponymous agency set up to investigate anomalous phenomena and conspiracy theories. It was influenced by American TV drama The X-Files (which was at the height of its popularity at the time) and other events such as the 1995 release of the alien autopsy film; as the general interest in the paranormal and parapolitics waned, the series was wound up and replaced by Pulp Sci-Fi as a venue for single issue self-contained stories. In turn it foreshadowed other comics series dedicated to similar agencies, such as Caballistics, Inc.

The format was created by former 2000 AD editor and long-time contributor Alan McKenzie.

Plot

Each story was presented by the Men in Black, as being a true file from their cases touching on a whole range of Forteana from Mothman to the Chupacabras and broader conspiracy theories such as those surrounding Project MKULTRA.

In the middle of the series run (and as the interest in such subjects peaked) the MiB even broke out of their own strip and fictionally took over the running of the magazine from #1014 (appearing as part of the logo from #1015), as traditional mascot character Tharg was allegedly away dealing with a crisis. This first issue coinciding with a promotion of the X-Files series 2 trading cards.

Cases were not always consistent - "Series 1, Case Nine: Spear of Destiny" and "Series 3, Case Three: The Dream Factory" directly contradicted each other; Case Nine revealed that the Spear Of Destiny was used as the flagpole for the 1969 Moon landing, whereas Case Three stated that the Moon landing had been faked in order to cover up a much more advanced space programme prevalent throughout the Solar System.
