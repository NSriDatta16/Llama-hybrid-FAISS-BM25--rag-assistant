History

1950-1964
7th Engineer Battalion was activated on September 29, 1950, at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, CA.  The battalion was rapidly built up with equipment and troops for deployment to the Korean War.  Activated companies included Headquarters, Support, A, B, Bulk Fuel, with a Fixed Bridge Platoon and Floating Bridge Platoon attached.  7th ESB never went to Korea however with all its new equipment, it became the training command for all engineers headed overseas to 1st Engineer Battalion in Korea.  From 1951 to 1954 the battalion also completed various engineering projects aboard MCB Camp Pendleton and constructed cold weather training facilities in the San Jacinto and Sierra Mountains.  

7th Engineer Battalion was attached to the 1st Marine Division in October 1955.  That same year, an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Platoon was attached to the battalion and was mainly used for clearing ranges.  In 1956, the battalion conducted a rigorous training cycle focusing on ambushes, construction, and bridging.  The battalion demonstrated its bridging capabilities when the Santa Margarita River flooded in 1957.  An unprecedented, 339 feet of M-6 bridging were used to span the swollen river which, at that time, was the longest M-6 Bridge ever erected.  That same year, the battalion increased the size of the Fixed Bridge Platoon to a company and the Floating Bridge Platoon was re-designated as 1st Bridge Platoon together creating a new Bridge Company. In 1962, the battalion's Company B was embarked aboard ship in support of the Cuban Missile Crisis response.

Vietnam War
On June 1, 1965, Company A attached to Regimental Landing Team-7 and embarked ship headed for South Vietnam.  In August 1965, the remainder of the battalion was ordered to depart for service in Vietnam, arriving in Da Nang on August 24, 1965.  From Da Nang, the battalion supported the III Marine Amphibious Force (MAF) throughout the I Corps Tactical Zone.  During the following year the battalion constructed an M-4 aluminum pontoon bridge spanning 1,478 feet over the Da Nang River, the longest ever built.

Many of the battalion's missions in 1967 included the construction of non-standard bridges, M-4 aluminum pontoon bridges, and pile bent bridges as well as the maintenance and upgrading of over 120 km of roads.  In 1968, Company A constructed a coffer dam while Company D participated in Operation Mameluke Thrust. Service Company provided over 33 million gallons of fresh water to the Marines of III MAF.

Throughout 1969 and 1970 the battalion continued upgrading and maintaining roads, mine sweeping and providing general engineer support until it returned to MCB Camp Pendleton in September 1970.  During April 1971, the battalion was reassigned to the 1st Marine Division and in June Company A detached from the battalion and was relocated to Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center Twentynine Palms, California.

1970s-1980s

In March 1976, 7th Engineers was re-designated as 7th Engineer Support Battalion (7th ESB) and was reassigned to the newly formed 1st Force Service Support Group (1st FSSG).  1st Bulk Fuel Company was transferred from 1st Supply Battalion at this time.  From 1977 to 1979 the battalion participated in several exercises including VARSITY EAGLE, OPPORTUNE LIFT, and VARSITY CLEANEX on MCB Camp Pendleton, MCAGCC Twentynine Palms, San Clemente Island, and Barstow, California.  Members of the battalion also participated in Operation KERNEL POTLATCH, a joint US-Canadian fleet landing exercise.

7th Bulk Fuel Company was activated in April 1983 followed by the activation of Bridge Company in July of the same year bringing the battalion up to two bridge companies and two bulk fuel companies.  For the next two years Companies A, B, and C, conducted horizontal construction, building roads, earthwork for runways, and replacing AM-2 matting throughout all Marine Corps installations across the western United States.  Bulk Fuel Company trained on fire fighting and the Amphibious Assault Fuel System (AAFS).  Bridge Company continued increasing proficiency in constructing Medium Girder Bridges (MGB) and M4T6 rafts in the Del Mar Boat Basin.
