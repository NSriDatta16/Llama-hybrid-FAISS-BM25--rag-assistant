Ricky Kanee Schachter, FRCP(C), CM (December 23, 1918 – July 1, 2007) was a dermatologist who practiced in the Toronto area, and was invested as a Member of the Order of Canada in 1998, as "a researcher, teacher, administrator and healer, whose work in the areas of skin cancer and psoriasis has improved the lives of her patients, and inspired fellow researchers across Canada."

Early life, education, and private life
Schachter grew up in Melville, Saskatchewan, at a time when women were not generally accepted as professionals in Canada. When she decided to go to university at the age of 16, to become a doctor, even her father, an educated Russian immigrant and community leader, said to her that she would "be taking up a space for a man."

In 1940, she received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Saskatchewan. Dr. Schachter then graduated from the University of Toronto’s Faculty of Medicine in 1943, and pursued post-graduate training in dermatology at Columbia University in New York from 1944 to 1945. She began working at the Women's College Hospital, in Toronto in 1946 and became a Fellow of the Royal College, in Canada, in 1950. She was appointed associate professor at the University of Toronto's Faculty of Medicine in 1961.

Her husband, Benjamin Schachter, was a Torontonian biochemist, working at the University of Toronto, who, from 1934 to 1939, conducted research on female sex hormones. He isolated and identified conjugated oestrone sulphate (Premarin). Her late brother, Sol Kanee, also received the Order of Canada for his work with the Bank of Canada and the Canadian Jewish Congress.
