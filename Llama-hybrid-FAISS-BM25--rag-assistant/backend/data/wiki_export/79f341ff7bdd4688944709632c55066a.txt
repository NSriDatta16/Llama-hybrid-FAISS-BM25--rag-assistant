History

Name 
The ancient Phoenician city of Sarepta was located on the Mediterranean coast of today's Lebanon, approximately at the site of the modern village of Sarafand, between Sidon and Tyre.

Sarepta was also mentioned, as Zarephath, in the Old Testament (I Kings 17:9), as the home of Elijah during a drought and famine.

In the 18th century (1765-1773), Moravian Brethren from Germany established the village of Sarepta, Volgograd, Russia.  About a century after its founding, the larger German Lutheran Church in Russia began efforts to take Sarepta under its wing. Many of the Moravian Brethren objected, moving elsewhere in Russia, then choosing to emigrate to the Western Hemisphere, including Canada.

Some of these settlers, part of the Germans from Russia diaspora, established a new village in Canada's North-West Territories.  From various suggestions, approximately 60 people in the new community signed a document favouring the name Sarepta, honouring their previous village. The government of the North-West Territories designated the name Sarepta to this settlement on October 2, 1904.  When the new province of Alberta was split from the North-West Territories in 1905, the government added "New" to distinguish it from the existing place name in Ontario.  The Moravian Brethren also felt that it honored and distinguished their newer community from the earlier biblical and Russian villages.
