Critical reception 
The Chicago Tribune wrote that Instigator "is loaded with the sort of sassy, danceable songs Britney Spears used to do really well." USA Today'''s review gave the album two and a half stars out of four, and said that Brown "has a breathy but fluid voice that nods to influences ranging from Jewel to Mariah Carey." The Morning Call'' wrote, "For the bubblegum pop aficionado... it's not a bad album." PopMatters gave the album a rating of two out of ten, and wrote, "With the exception of two songs that demonstrate a burgeoning talent both as a writer and a vocalist, the rest of Kaciâ€™s CD is positively puerile."
