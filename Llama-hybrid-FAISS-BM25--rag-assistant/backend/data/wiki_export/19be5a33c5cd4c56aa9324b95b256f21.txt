This star is estimated to be about the same age as the Sun, with 83% of the mass of the Sun and 82% of the Sun's radius. It has not been identified as a member of any moving star groups. This star has displayed unusual emissions of Ca II and is much more x-ray luminous than the Sun. It is considered a relatively active star. Based on an iron abundance of [Fe/H] = âˆ’0.02, the metallicity of this star appears to be similar to that of the Sun.
