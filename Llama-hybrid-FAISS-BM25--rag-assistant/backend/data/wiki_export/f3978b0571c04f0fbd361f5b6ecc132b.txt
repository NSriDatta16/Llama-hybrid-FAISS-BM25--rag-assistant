Lisa LaFlamme  (born July 25, 1964) is a Canadian television journalist, and formerly the chief anchor and senior editor of CTV National News. She replaced Lloyd Robertson in this role on September 5, 2011. LaFlamme previously served as the news international affairs correspondent and substitute host for CTV National News. In August 2022, CTV announced it was ending her contract, due to a "business decision" to take the programme in a "different direction". LaFlamme spoke out publicly regarding her dismissal, and went viral on social media when she claimed she was "blindsided" by the decision.

Following her departure from CTV, Rogers Media announced on September 9, 2022 that it had hired LaFlamme as a special correspondent to cover the death and funeral of Elizabeth II for CityNews. She also covered the Coronation of Charles III and Camilla for CityNews in May 2023.

Early life
LaFlamme was born in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada, to David and Kathleen LaFlamme. She graduated from St. Mary's High School and then from the University of Ottawa.

Career
LaFlamme began her career at CTV's Kitchener affiliate CKCO in 1989 as a copy writer and script assistant. She moved on to become an anchor in 1997. Past roles include serving as the co-host on Canada AM between 2001 and 2003, as a parliamentary reporter, and on CTV NEWSNET (now CTV News Channel).

CTV National News
LaFlamme joined CTV National News in 2003 as a foreign correspondent as well as back-up anchor to Lloyd Robertson. She covered many international events and conflicts: the September 11, 2001 attacks and the subsequent Iraq War, the War in Afghanistan, the Arab Spring in Cairo in 2011, Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the 2010 Haiti earthquake, the death of Pope John Paul II in 2005 and the election of Pope Francis in 2013. LaFlamme has also covered every Canadian federal election since 1997, and every Olympic Games since 2006, most recently, the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics and the London 2012 Summer Olympics. Also from London, she covered the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II in 2012, the Platinum Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II in 2022, and the royal weddings of Prince William and Catherine Middleton in 2011 and of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in 2018. 

Laflamme has interviewed many Canadian figures, such as former Prime Ministers Paul Martin, Jean Chrétien, and Brian Mulroney, Stephen Harper and his wife Laureen Harper, plus current Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his mother Margaret Trudeau, members of the Canadian royal family, such as Prince Andrew, the Duchess of York, and Prince Harry, the latter for the Toronto's Invictus Games and during the London Olympics, as well as foreign celebrities like Sir Paul McCartney. She has also interviewed: Boris Johnson (mayor of London at the time), Conrad Black (former businessman), Colin Powell, Bill Clinton, Tony Blair, Benjamin Netanyahu, John Kerry, and Alex Trebek.

After Robertson's departure in September 2011, LaFlamme was promoted to sole anchor in his place. In June 2022, LaFlamme was informed her contract would not be renewed by Bell Media, the parent company of CTV, and that she would be replaced as anchor by Omar Sachadena.

Dismissal 
On August 15, 2022, LaFlamme posted a video on Twitter explaining that her contract had been terminated, saying she was "blindsided" by Bell Media's decision. According to Jesse Brown of Canadaland, LaFlamme was ousted by Michael Melling, a Bell Media Vice President; the two apparently had a disagreement over the budget to cover the Ukrainian-Russian conflict. According to internal sources, while Melling made the decision, it received approval from Karine Moses, senior vice-president of content development and news, Wade Oosterman, president of Bell Media, and Mirko Bibic, president and CEO of BCE Inc. and Bell Canada.  Bibic later stated "We are at a crossroads where viewing behaviours have changed dramatically and traditional broadcasting is under severe stress worldwide. In an environment of declining ratings and global online platforms, we can’t keep relying on traditional broadcasting. The days when viewers wait until 11 PM to get their news are gone. While some may resist change, it is necessary and we need to confront this. The CTV national news team needs to work on an integrated and aligned basis, dedicated to a common strategy and Bell Media needs to provide our journalists with the resources they need on all platforms where news is consumed". Among other changes, this realignment would mean that a breaking news story would no longer be covered on CTV National News first, instead it would be published on the CTV News website. In addition LaFlamme was likely a target for those advocating cost-cutting at Bell Canada since she "had a legacy contract that paid way more than the current market rate". 

Moses said that LaFlamme was given the opportunity to have a "proper on-air sendoff," but "opted not to say goodbye to the public," and noted that LaFlamme "was offered many options to come back and to do many things, which she declined, and I respect that." LaFlamme's announcement of her departure via Twitter was considered "quick, cold, and calculating", and some former CTV colleagues noted that LaFlamme and senior producer Rosa Hwang had created a toxic work environment. In addition, LaFlamme's standing among Bell executives likely declined due to incorrect reporting that caused Patrick Brown to resign as Ontario Progressive Conservative (PC) Party leader, as Brown filed a libel lawsuit against CTV that was only recently settled.

The Guardian correspondent Leyland Cecco reported on accusations of misogyny, sexism and ageism and "furore over LaFlamme's termination" in the public debate. Bell Media published a statement that they would be "taking steps to initiate an independent, third-party internal workplace review." Robyn Doolittle of The Globe and Mail alleges a "senior CTV official" told her they witnessed a meeting where "Mr. Melling asked who had approved the decision to 'let Lisa’s hair go grey.' The issue of Ms. LaFlamme’s hair colour came up again on set one day, when he noted that it was taking on a purple hue in the studio lighting." Carol Off and Melissa Fung have argued that LaFlamme's firing was an example of sexism. On August 26, Melling went on leave, effective immediately, to "spend time with his family"; BCE Inc.'s chief executive officer, Mirko Bibic, contradicted CTV's explanation, stating that the leave was "pending the outcome of the workplace review that is proceeding." Journalists within the CTV newsroom issued a letter to Bibic, BCE's board of directors, and president "expressing a lack of confidence in Mr. Melling's leadership", "serious concerns" over LaFlamme's dismissal, and "toxic work culture that has developed at CTV over the past eight months." On December 19, 2022, the independent review concluded with Melling being reassigned away from CTV's news division, citing a need for civility, respect, and better working conditions in the newsroom.

On August 25, the Canadian branch of the Wendy's restaurant chain changed the hair of their girl mascot from red to gray in support of LaFlamme. Dove Canada did not mention LaFlamme explicitly but urged its followers to turn their pictures to grayscale in support of graying women, and announced a $100,000 donation to Catalyst, an organization for inclusive workplaces. The Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Twitter account retweeted the cover of its Maye Musk issue, who also has gray hair, and mentioned its support for the Dove campaign.

CityNews 
On September 9, 2022, Rogers Media announced that it had hired LaFlamme as a special correspondent to cover the death of Queen Elizabeth II and her legacy. She reported from London for CityNews and its platforms. 

On April 21, 2023, Rogers Media announced that LaFlamme would cover the Coronation of Charles III and Camilla alongside Cynthia Mulligan for CityNews and its platforms.
