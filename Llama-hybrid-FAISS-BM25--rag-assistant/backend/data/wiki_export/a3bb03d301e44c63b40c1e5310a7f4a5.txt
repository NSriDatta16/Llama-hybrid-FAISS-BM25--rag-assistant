Overview 
Sellingen was founded in the 12th century on a sandy ridge along the River . The church dates from the 1300s, however a church in Sellingen was already mentioned around 1150 on a list of possession of the Diocese of Osnabrück. In the 15th century, the Ter Apel Monastery was part of the parish of Sellingen. 

In 1665, the bishop of Münster secretly constructed a road through the moor from Walchum in Lower Saxony to Sellingen as part of a planned invasion of Groningen. At neighbouring Jipsinghuizen, the Münster Army was attacked by the Dutch Republic, and  had to retreat after the Battle of Jipsinghuizen. The road was removed afterwards. 

Around 1750, the first school was built in Sellingen. In October 1964, a road was opened between Sellingen and Walchum. Despite protests by both municipalities, the border remained fenced off, because Germany did not want to establish a border post.

Sellingen used to be part of the municipality of Bourtange. In 1821, it became part of Vlagtwedde. Many people desired a more central location of the municipal council. In 1889, the council voted to move the seat to Sellingen. In 2017, Vlagtwedde merged into Westerwolde, however Sellingen is still one of the two seats.
