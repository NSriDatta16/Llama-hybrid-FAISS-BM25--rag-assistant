The settlement stretches some five kilometres into the valley forming the present village, with a population of around 3300. Historians and linguists etymologically derive the name of the settlement from the Slavic word of ’cserny’, meaning ’black’. The anterior constituent, the word ’Bakony’ was added to the settlement's name in 1913, when administrative changes were introduced all over the country. Formerly the settlement had been registered as Csernye, by which it is still colloquially known.

The new settlers were Slovaks from the counties of Nyitra and Zólyom of the Old Upper Hungary, who in addition to their mother tongue, the Slovak language, also brought with them new skills and occupations including the basics of forestry and viniculture.  The local gentry in this period were the members of the Zichy family, who granted the inhabitants the free practice of their Lutheran religion and built a church and a school for the inhabitants of the village. The settlement prospered during this period and in 1730 the number of inhabitants numbered 300. The first stone church of the settlement was built in 1785.

It was in 1862 that part of the village was destroyed by a great fire. The pews in the Lutheran church, still in use today, were acquired when the church was rebuilt after the fire.
