Alfred Aloysius "Trader" Horn (born Alfred Aloysius Smith; 1861â€“1931) was an ivory trader in central Africa. He wrote a book, Trader Horn, detailing his journeys. The book also documents his efforts to free slaves; meet the founder of Rhodesia, Cecil Rhodes; and liberate a princess from captivity.

A silent film exists of Horn, as do recent writings about him online  and a biography by Tim Couzens.
