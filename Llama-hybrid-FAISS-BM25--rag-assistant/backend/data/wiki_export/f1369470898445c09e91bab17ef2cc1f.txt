Rovibronic coupling, also known as rotation/vibration-electron coupling, denotes the simultaneous interactions between rotational, vibrational, and electronic degrees of freedom in a molecule. When a rovibronic transition occurs, the rotational, vibrational, and electronic states change simultaneously, unlike in rovibrational coupling. The coupling can be observed spectroscopically and is most easily seen in the Rennerâ€“Teller effect in which a linear polyatomic molecule is in a degenerate electronic state and bending vibrations will cause a large rovibronic coupling.
