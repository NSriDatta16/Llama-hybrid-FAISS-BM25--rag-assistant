In addition to the waters of the Colorado, water from Willow Creek just below the dam is pumped up  to Lake Granby. Water from Lake Granby is pumped  higher by the Granby Pumping Plant to the Granby Pump Canal, which extents  to Shadow Mountain Lake, from which water is diverted through the Alva B. Adams Tunnel to the East Slope.

This damsite does not generate any power directly; power is generated at other locations in the Colorado-Big Thompson Project.
