Inez Hogan (August 5, 1895 â€“ February 1973) was an American writer and illustrator of children's books, particularly animal stories.  She was born in Washington, D.C., and attended the Cape Cod School of Art.  She lived in Provincetown and New York City.

Hogan wrote 63 books, including many about her character Nicodemus.  She illustrated another 19 books, including the first edition of Epaminondas and His Auntie by Sara Cone Bryant. The black characters in Hogan's books were often portrayed with African American stereotypes.

From the 1930s until her death, children's books were her sole means of support. Of this she said "I can think of no happier way to make a living."

Inez Hogan died in February 1973 in Orleans, Massachusetts.
