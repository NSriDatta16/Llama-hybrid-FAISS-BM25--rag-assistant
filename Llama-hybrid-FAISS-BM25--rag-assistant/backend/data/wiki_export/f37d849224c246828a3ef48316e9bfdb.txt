The LBC Crew (Long Beach City Crew) were a hip-hop trio from Long Beach, California. They were the first act to be executively-produced by Snoop Dogg.

During their time with Death Row, the LBC Crew recorded a previously unreleased album entitled Haven't U Heard... which remained unreleased until February 8, 2011 when it was released by WideAwake/Death Row. They had a hit single with the song "Beware of My Crew", from the A Thin Line Between Love and Hate soundtrack album, which was originally intended to be for their debut album. They played on Snoop Dogg's second album Tha Doggfather. The group disbanded following the collapse of Death Row. Since then, unreleased material from the group emerged on the underground.

The LBC Crew remained visible figures in West-Coast hip-hop. Bad Azz released two solo albums under the Doggy Style imprint. Lil C-Style remained part of disorganized Death Row camp. And Techniec recently signed to The Game's The Black Wall Street Records then left to start his own label.

Break-up
Early on in the LBC Crew's lifespan, a small dispute broke out between Lil' C-Style and Snoop Dogg over C-Style's royalties (he claimed he wasn't being paid enough for them). The argument was never settled, resulting in C-Style damaging the original tape of LBC's debut album beyond repair, and telling Snoop he no longer wanted to be part of the group.
