History

The rail line through the San Fernando Valley was established by the Southern Pacific in 1893. When the Montalvo Cutoff was constructed in 1904, most traffic was diverted over a new mainline which ran diagonally across the valley and the tracks were relegated to branch status. Pacific Electric interurban trains reached Van Nuys by December 1911, crossing the Southern Pacific tracks at Van Nuys Boulevard.

The Orange Line (now the G Line) began operations over the former Burbank branch with new facilities to serve rapid buses on October 29, 2005.

Future development
As part of the Orange Line Service Improvements Project, which aims to increase bus speeds and capacity through the corridor, the station is planned to be rebuilt on a grade-separated bridge to decrease interference from traffic.

Thus far, A section of LADWP overhead power lines were undergrounded along Atena Street between Vesper Ave and the distribution substation to the east in August 2019. The communication wires were also undergrounded in November 2020, due to a planned TOD (transit oriented development) on the northwestern corner of Van Nuys Blvd and Oxnard St to be built next to the proposed G Line Bridge.

Van Nuys station will serve as the southern terminus of the East San Fernando Valley Light Rail Transit Project light rail line in 2030. In June 2018, Metro staff recommended light rail as the preferred transport mode along this route. This route will connect to Amtrak and Metrolink's Van Nuys train station and Sylmar/San Fernando Metrolink station to the north. Additionally, the Sepulveda Transit Corridor service may connect to the station.
