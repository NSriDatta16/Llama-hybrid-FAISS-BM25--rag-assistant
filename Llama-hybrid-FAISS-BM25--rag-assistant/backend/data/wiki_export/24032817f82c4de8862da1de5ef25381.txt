History
Deanshanger used to be called Daneshanger, "hanger" being an old English word, meaning a clearing in the woods â€“ hence Daneshanger was a clearing in the woods where the Danes lived.

The original population centre of the parish was the hamlet of Passenham. However, from the late 18th century the coming of the Grand Union Canal to the east made Deanshanger an agricultural industrial centre causing it to grow quickly. This growth accelerated with the building of the London and Birmingham Railway in the first half of the 19th century which passed through the nearby villages of Wolverton, Bletchley and Roade.

After a fall out with Henry II in 1170 AD, Thomas Becket is said to have sought refuge in the Gilbertine Monastery in Deanshanger (or Dinneshangra as it was then known). Although disguised as a peasant, he was nevertheless recognised by a farm labourer. At the time the only water supply in the village was foul and brackish, and having heard of the miracle that Becket was said to have performed at nearby Northampton, the farm labourer pleaded with Becket to repeat the performance. Becket is said to have looked towards Heaven, struck the ground with his staff, and immediately a fresh spring appeared. This is one of 703 miracles that is said to have led to his canonisation.

The school, a sports college, merged with former Roade school in September 2011, and was renamed The Elizabeth Woodville School.

Demography
At the time of the 2001 census, Deanshanger parish had a population of 2,900 citizens and in 2010 was estimated to be 3,877, falling to 3,817 at the 2011 census.

Industry
From the 1820s, the main industry in the village was an iron foundry and later an iron oxide works (making pigment for paint). This gave some of the surrounding area a red colouration from the oxide dust. However, in 1999, the works closed and was demolished. By 2008, most of the works land has been replaced by the construction of several new housing estates. Extensive remedial work was needed to reverse the harmful effects of the previous industrial use of the site there are still signs of the red stained oxide all around the village. Some land has designated for light industrial use.

Local Amenities
The village has a village hall and community centre (extended in 2008) to provide a venue for events and facilities for community groups, a doctor's surgery, a library, and a cafe. Other amenities include two pre-schools, a primary school, and a secondary school, the aforementioned Elizabeth Woodville School, which is split over two sites across the town. The schools' grounds include the site of a Roman villa.

There is a parish church (Holy Trinity, Church of England) and a Methodist chapel, a post office, a pub and two members' clubs (sports and social, Conservative club), a pharmacy, a hairdresser, a pizza and kebab takeaway, a Chinese and fish and chips takeaway, a mobile takeaway, and other village stores and newsagent's shops including a greengrocers.

On the edge of the village on the A422, is a golf and country club, a hotel, an Indian restaurant and a petrol and service station. The town has a parish council office, which is a former school and Baptist Church, which was renovated in 2008.
