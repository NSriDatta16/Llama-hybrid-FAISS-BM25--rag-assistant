Calasparra () is a municipality in the autonomous community of Murcia, Spain. It shares borders with Cieza, Mula, Cehegín, Moratalla and province of Albacete.

History 
There were people living in Calasparra during the Bronze and Iron Ages.

The present-day municipality was also occupied by people during the Roman Iberian Peninsula era as largely attested by several ceramic remains.

There is archaeological evidence of the presence of people during the Muslim Iberian Peninsula era in the territory. A remarkable site is Villa Vieja or Despoblado de Villa Vieja, which consists of an ancient hamlet.

Since the Moors' conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, there was an aspiration from some Christian kingdoms to conquer the Peninsula. The aspiration led to wars and also resulted in the acquisition of territories for the Christian kingdoms. The Kingdom of Castile obtained the Taifa of Murcia, the region where Calasparra was, in 1243 because the king of the Taifa felt under pressure and stipulated the Taifa to be dependent on the Christian kingdom with Castile in the Treaty of Alcaraz. The Castilian kingdom bestowed upon the Knights Hospitaller the territory of Calasparra in 1289 as a reward for taking part in the Reconquista.

Geography 
Calasparra has an area of 193 km2 and a population of 10,178 (2019). Between 2004 and 2006 more than 2,000 British immigrants bought new homes off-plan, built on 3 new urbanisations surrounding the town, with more purchasing country homes.

Calasparra is situated in a mountainous region (398m) in the northwest of the province of Murcia. In contrast to the surrounding arid terrain, Calasparra benefits from being crossed by four rivers, including the Segura. This has enabled the cultivation of Calasparra rice, for which the town is noted, and dates back to the 14th century.
