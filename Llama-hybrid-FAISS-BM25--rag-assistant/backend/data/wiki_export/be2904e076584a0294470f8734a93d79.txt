Richard II (died 1111), called Richard of Aquila (Riccardo dell'Aquila), was the consul and duke of Gaeta, ruling from 1104 or 1105 to his death.

Riccardo di Aquila was the son of Bartolomeo, Count of Caleno, possibly from a junior branch of the Counts of Aversa. Other researchers link him to the Norman lords of L'Aigle and assume him to be a younger son of Richer, the lord of L'Aigle, and nephew of Hugh d'Avranches, Earl of Chester. 

He conquered the duchy from his predecessor, William Blosseville, whom he exiled. He subsequently minted his own coinage as an independent prince.  He was also count of Suessa.

He lent troops to Pope Paschal II in 1108 to retake Rome. He was a constant ally of the pope and enemy of Ptolemy I of Tusculum.
