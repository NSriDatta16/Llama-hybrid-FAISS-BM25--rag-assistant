History

2000-2004

World TV launched in June 2000 to take advantage of the infrastructure and viewing quality of the Sky TV digital platform that had been launched the year before. Through its ongoing partnership with Sky, it has continued to provide entertainment, educational and cultural programming to new migrants, New Zealand-born Chinese New Zealanders and other speakers and learners of standard Mandarin throughout the country. The company's mission has been to help new generations of Asian New Zealanders retain their language and cultural identity through quality programming, up-to-date information, imported entertainment and local community news.

World TV attracted the attention of other media in 2002, for an interview by Rod Peng on the Face to Face programme with New Zealand First leader Winston Peters. Peters claimed most migrants from the past 30 years would agree the volume of new migrants coming into the country could be a cause of "discord, violence and racism". Peters also used the appearance to accuse other media of misrepresenting him as anti-Asian, because of what he called an unprofessional focus on emotions rather than facts. He argued he was instead an advocate for new migrants being settled, employed and integrated in small numbers. Peng described Peters as a "very capable politician" with a "very big communication problem".

Between November 2003 and December 2004, Touch China TV also made an attempt to target Chinese-speaking audiences with a two-hour afternoon slot on music channel C4. A University of Otago study put the station's closure down to its failure to combine local content and Chinese programming in a way that gave it a point of difference to transnational broadcasters geared at new English-as-second-language migrants.

2004–
The company expanded into radio, setting up Auckland-based radio stations Real Good Life (now Chinese Radio FM 99.4) in 2004, New Supremo (now AM936) in 2004, and Radio 9 (now Chinese Radio FM 104.2) in 2010. In 2004, it set up wholly owned subsidiary Chinese Voice Broadcasting to operate the stations on a day-to-day basis. In 2006, World TV added three channels to serve Korean and Japanese language communities. In August 2007, CTV8, the first 24-hour free-to-air Chinese television channel, joined the service - initially as an analogue channel and later as part of the Freeview line-up.

English-language television channel TV9 began broadcasting on Freeview in February 2012, combining imported programmes with simulcasts of Chinese Radio shows. Chief executive Henry Ho said the introduction of specialist English-language broadcasting was a reflection of growing demand for information about Asia, strengthening trading and cultural ties between Asia and New Zealand, and New Zealanders becoming increasingly interested in Asia.

The Chinese media market is very competitive, despite the closure of several Asian media outlets. Asia Downunder, the country's only programme specifically targeted towards Asian communities, broadcast on TV One between 1994 and 2008. Limited Chinese programming aired on local Auckland channel Triangle TV in the early 2000s through commercial operation Golden Raindrop TV.

On 19 January 2016 Sky announced the World TV channels 300-309 will cease transmission from 1 March 2016.
