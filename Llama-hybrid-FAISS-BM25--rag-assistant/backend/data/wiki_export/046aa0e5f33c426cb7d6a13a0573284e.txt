Professional standards 
Global Internal Audit Standards set forth essential requirements and recommendations for the professional practice of internal auditing globally. The Standards apply to any individual or function that provides internal audit services; for organizations that vary in purpose, size, complexity, and structure; and by persons within or outside the organization. The Standards apply whether internal auditors are employees of the organization, contracted with an external service provider, or a combination of both.

All internal auditors are accountable for conforming with the principles and standards relevant to performing their job responsibilities. Chief audit executives are additionally accountable for the internal audit function’s overall conformance with the Standards.

The development and implementation of a structure of fundamental professional standards offers internal audit practitioners a basic framework on which to build an internal audit function that serves their individual organizations. The structure The IIA has developed over time is called the International Professional Practices Framework® and serves the needs of internal auditors around the world in any sector, industry, or profession.

To help internal auditors implement these professional practice standards, The IIA produces authoritative guidance developed with the assistance of professional internal auditors with diverse, global expertise. Guidance is created through a rigorous process to assure its applicability to a wide range of internal audit functions around the world.

IIA members can download guidance titles from The IIA’s website in a variety of subjects or areas of specialization, such as public sector, financial services, and information technology (IT), as well as general guidance offering best practices and/or internal audit strategies.

Growing with the profession
In 2023, The IIA introduced the newly titled Global Internal Audit Standards as a revamp of the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing designed to ensure that the profession and its practitioners a maintain relevance in an evolving global landscape. Stakeholders from around the world provided comments on the proposed update, which will be available in over 20 languages, with the finalized version released in 2024, with an effective date 12 months after the release date.
