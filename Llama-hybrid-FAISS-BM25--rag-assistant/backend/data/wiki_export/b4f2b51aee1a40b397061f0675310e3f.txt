The Renault Magnum is a heavy-duty truck that was produced by the French Manufacturer Renault Véhicules Industriels and later Renault Trucks (also part of Renault, now Volvo) from 1990 to 2013. The Magnum was available in articulated and rigid configurations, both configurations could be bought with a 6×2 or 4×2 drivetrain. The 6×4 is merely designed for heavy haulage uses.

First launched in 1990, the Magnum was awarded the "International Truck of the Year" in 1991.

The Magnum was featured in Top Gear S12 E01, when Jeremy Clarkson bought one for less than £5,000 in the Top Gear Lorry Challenge.

History
In 1985, Renault presented a prototype truck, the VE 10, with special aerodynamics to reduce fuel consumption.
The truck was launched as the Renault AE (for AErodynamic) in 1990, and notable for being the first modern truck with a completely flat cab floor and for having a mechanically separate cab and engine compartment, resulting in increased comfort inside the cab. The cab was designed by Marcello Gandini. Engines at launch were the AE 380 with a 6-cylinder turbodiesel offering , and the AE500 with a  Mack V8 diesel. It was voted Truck of the Year 1991. Since 1997 the truck was marketed as Renault Magnum and the cab was redesigned, and new engines became available. In 1995, the VE 20 prototype was presented, giving a preview of the second generation Magnum.

In 2001, the major facelift was presented, with a new cab designed by Xavier Allard,  keeping its characteristic boxed shape and separate engine-cab model.

A few days after the presentation of its totally renewed range, in Lyon, Renault Trucks was getting ready to turn the page on the Renault Magnum. On Wednesday 26 June 2013, the keys to the last Magnum were presented to hauliers Robert Chabbert, at the Bourg-en-Bresse site, with a brand-new Renault Trucks T also present.
