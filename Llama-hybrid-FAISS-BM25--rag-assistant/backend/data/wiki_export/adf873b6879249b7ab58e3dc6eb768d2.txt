"Yassassin" (Bowie's pronunciation ; also known as "Yassassin (Turkish for: Long Live)", and released in Turkey as "Yassassin (Yaşasın)") is a song written by English singer-songwriter David Bowie for the 1979 album Lodger. "Yassassin" is an incongruous reggae song with a Turkish flavour.

The title of the song is derived from the Turkish verb used to wish someone a long life, spelled yaşasın (), from the verbal root yaşa- 'live' with the third-person imperative ending; therefore yaşasın literally means 'may he/she live'.

"Yassassin" was released as a single – the third single to be released from Lodger – but only in the Netherlands and Turkey.  The Dutch single edit of the song was included on Re:Call 3, part of the A New Career in a New Town (1977–1982) compilation (2017).
