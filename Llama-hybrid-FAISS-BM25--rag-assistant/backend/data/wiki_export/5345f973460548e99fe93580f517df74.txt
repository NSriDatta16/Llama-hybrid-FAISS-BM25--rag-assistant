Paid Vacation is the fourth studio album by American singer/songwriter Richard Marx, released in 1994.

The album features "Now and Forever", Marx's ninth and final Top 10 hit on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and most successful single on the Adult Contemporary chart. It was issued as a lead single for the album and stayed atop the Billboard A/C chart for 11 consecutive weeks. The follow-up single "The Way She Loves Me" also achieved in Billboard, reaching the Top 20 on the Hot 100 and hitting #3 at Adult Contemporary radio.

However, the album itself was less successful than his previous efforts. During a 23-week-long chart run on the U. S. Billboard 200, Paid Vacation only reached #37 and failed to climb higher than its predecessor Rush Street (#35). Nevertheless, received his fourth successive Platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America in late 1994. The album sold well globally, especially in Japan, providing Marx with his first Gold record in that country. It was also a success in Southeast Asia, where it sold over 1.1 million copies by 1995, alongside Ballads.

The album was dedicated to Marx's then-wife Cynthia Rhodes and sons Brandon, Lucas, and Jesse Marx.
