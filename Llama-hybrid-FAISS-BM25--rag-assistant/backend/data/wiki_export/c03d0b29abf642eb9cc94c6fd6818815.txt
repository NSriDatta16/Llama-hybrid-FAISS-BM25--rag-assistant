Editorial history
Wodehouse was still working on the book when he died in 1975; the published version was edited by Richard Usborne, and includes Wodehouse's notes on the ending of the story.

In various pages of notes, Wodehouse wrote fifteen possible titles for the novel, including Lord Emsworth Entertains, Blandings Castle Fills Up, Gally to the Rescue, The Weird Old Buster, and All's Well at Blandings. He did not consider the title Sunset at Blandings, which was the title chosen by the company that published the book in 1977, Chatto & Windus. Usborne writes that the title is apt but would not have been chosen by Wodehouse himself since, according to Usborne, "Wodehouse would never have locked, even if only by suggestion, the great gates of the castle. He would have wanted it there, with its sun high in the sky, for another visit if the mood took him".

Plot
The story is another tale set at Blandings Castle, filled as ever with romance and imposters. Galahad Threepwood uses his charm and wit to ensure his brother Clarence continues to lead a quiet and peaceful life.
