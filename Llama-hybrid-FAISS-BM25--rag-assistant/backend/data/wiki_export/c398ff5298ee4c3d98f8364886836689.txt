2000

2002

During the 2002 congressional elections Grucci released a radio advertisement which stated that Tim Bishop had "turned his back" on rape victims at Southampton College. Grucci was criticized for the advertisement and Bishop filed a lawsuit to prevent the advertisement from being played.
