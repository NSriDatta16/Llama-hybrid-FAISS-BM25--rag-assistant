Sandur State was a princely state of India during the British Raj, part of the Madras States Agency. Its capital was the town of Sanduru.

History 
From 1731 until the accession to India, the Sandur state was ruled by Maratha Ghorpade royals. In 1776 – 1790 its territory was captured by Hyder Ali. Between 27 October 1817 and 1 July 1818 Sandur was again annexed to the Maratha Empire Peshwa's Dominions. In 1801, Bellary district was transferred to British India, and the Rajas of Sandur came under the political authority of the Madras Presidency. On 1 July 1818 Sandur formally became a British protectorate.

The area of the state was 433 km2. (161 sq. mi.); its population in 1901 was 11,200. The military sanatorium of Ramandurg is located in a range of hills on the western border of the district.

The Raja of Sandur acceded to the Union of India on 10 August 1947. The ruler commanded an estimated annual revenue of Rs.3,500/-. Sandur remained a separate territorial entity till 1 April 1949 when it was merged with the neighbouring Bellary district of Madras State (the previous directly ruled colonial Madras Province).

Sandur state was later incorporated into Bellary district, then part of the Madras Presidency. In 1953, Bellary District was transferred to Mysore State, which was later renamed Karnataka.

The instrument of accession to the Dominion of India was signed by Yeshwantrao Ghorpade on 10 August 1947, thereby merging Sandur State with the Madras Presidency in 1949. After formation of states on linguistic basis, Sandur was transferred to the Mysore State in 1956. Raja Yeshwantrao continued playing an influential and active role in public life, till his death in 1996. He was succeeded by is son, M. Y. Ghorpade as the titular Raja. M. Y. Ghorpade served as a state Minister for Finance, Rural Development & Panchayats, Member of the Karnataka Legislative Assembly and Member of Parliament the Indian Parliament (Lok Shabha).
