Munlochy ( ; Scottish Gaelic: Poll Lochaidh) is a small village, lying at the head of Munlochy Bay (Ob Poll Lochaidh), in the Black Isle in Ross and Cromarty, in northern Scotland.

There are few early records of a settlement, but it seems likely that Munlochy expanded in the 1760s due to quarry workers extracting stone nearby to build Fort George on the far side of the Moray Firth.
