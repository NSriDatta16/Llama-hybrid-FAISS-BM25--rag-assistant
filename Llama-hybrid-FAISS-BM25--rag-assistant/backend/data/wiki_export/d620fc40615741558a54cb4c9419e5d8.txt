Fünf auf der nach oben offenen Richterskala () is the fourth full-length studio album by the German experimental rock band Einstürzende Neubauten, released in 1987 through Some Bizzare Records in the U.K. and What's So Funny About GmbH in Germany. It was reissued in 2002 through the band's own label, Potomak.

Reception 

Trouser Press, in an ambiguous review, described the album as "shockingly low-key." AllMusic described the album as "Einstürzende Neubauten at their unsettling, gripping, and tension-ridden best" and "the group's most subdued and measured work to that point, organic dark ambient that rarely utilized the chaos and  for which they had become known."
