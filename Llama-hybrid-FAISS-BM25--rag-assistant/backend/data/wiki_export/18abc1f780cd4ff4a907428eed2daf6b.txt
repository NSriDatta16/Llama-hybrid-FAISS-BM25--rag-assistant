Collegeland (or Collegelands - ) is a semi-rural area in north County Armagh, Northern Ireland. It includes the townlands of Aghinlig, Keenaghan, Lislasley, Kinnego, Mullaghmore, and Tirmacrannon  near the village of Charlemont and just across the River Blackwater from  Moy, County Tyrone, within the Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council area. It had a population of 122 people (42 households) in the 2011 Census.

In 1859, the lease of the Collure estate (as it was then known) was inherited at his father's death by John Howard Parnell, elder brother of Charles Stewart Parnell. In 1879, John Parnell, financially strapped, offered his subtenants terms on which to purchase their own farms, according to the "John Bright Clauses" of the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act 1870.  As late as 1980, tenant farmers in the area paid rent to the estate of Olivia Parnell (widow of John Howard Parnell). A portion of the rents paid for upkeep of Trinity College, Dublin, hence the name "Collegeland."

Five killings in the Collegeland townlands of Aghinlig and Lislasley are noted in the article on The Troubles in Loughgall.
