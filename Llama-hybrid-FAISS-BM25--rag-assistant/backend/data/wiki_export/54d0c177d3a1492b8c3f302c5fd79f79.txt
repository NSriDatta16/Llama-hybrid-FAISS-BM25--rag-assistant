Trifluoromethylisocyanide is the chemical compound with the formula CF3NC.  It is an isocyanide and a fluorocarbon. Polymerisation occurs even at temperatures below its boiling point of −80 °C. As a ligand in coordination chemistry, this species behaves similarly to carbon monoxide.

The compound trifluoracetonitrile (CF3CN) is an isomer to trifluoromethylisocyanide.  The nitrile is more stable, as is the usual case.
