Kyle Busch was the fastest in practice when he was ejected from the track by CART officials because the American Racing Wheels 200 was part of a CART weekend featuring the Marlboro 500 CART FedEx Championship Series event. Marlboro threw Busch out of the garage because of an interpretation of the Master Settlement Agreement of 1998, prohibiting persons under 18 years of age in participating in events sponsored by tobacco companies. Due to that, Tim Woods III took over Busch's #99 truck; NASCAR subsequently set an minimum age limit of 18 across all top three national series the following season, primarily as the Cup Series was also then sponsored by another cigarette brand, Winston.  Kyle's response to the new minimum age limit was to switch to another racing league for 2002, before returning to NASCAR after turning 18 as a Hendrick Motorsports development driver.
This was the last time the Truck Series concluded at California. From 2002 to 2019, all three series have had the season finale at the Homestead-Miami Speedway.

Failed to qualify: Ronnie Hornaday (#07), Mike Hamby (#09), Tom Powers (#55), Conrad Burr (#87), G. J. Mennen Jr. (#71), Phil Bonifield (#23)

Rookie of the Year 
After winning once and finishing fourth in points, Travis Kvapil of Addington Racing was named the Truck Series Rookie of the Year, narrowly defeating Ricky Hendrick, teammate to champion Jack Sprague. Matt Crafton and Billy Bigley Jr. both posted several top-tens during the season and finished close to each other in points. Jon Wood, Brian Rose, Larry Gunselman, and Ricky Sanders all made limited runs, while Willy T. Ribbs became the first African American to make a full-time bid for the Craftsman Truck Series championship. Chuck Hossfeld and Nathan Haseleu signed to drive for Roush Racing after winning its "Gong Show" competition, but were released early in the season.
