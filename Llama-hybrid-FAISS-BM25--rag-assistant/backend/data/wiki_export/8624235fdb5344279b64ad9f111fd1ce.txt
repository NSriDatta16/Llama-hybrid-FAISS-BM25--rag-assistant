Kulwinder Dhillon (6 June 1975 – 19 March 2006) was an Indian Punjabi singer, who had the hit songs like "Kacherian Ch Mele Lagday" and "Boliyan".

Career
Kulwinder Dhillon started his career with his debut album Kacheriyan Ch Mele Lagde that had the hit song "Boliyan", which got a lot of airplay on the radio. In 2002, he released his album, Glassi Khadke; it was a hit and the popular song on this album was Mashooq. Dhillon made his career with his third album, College, in 2003. The most popular song on the album was "Kalli Kite Mil". Though this was not a fast-paced tune, the album was redone later for an international release and the song was converted to a hardcore Bhangra, fast-paced song.

"Kalli Kite Mil Kujh Kahengi Ta Nahi" made Dhillon widely popular. He later released Velli in 2005. The album was enjoyed internationally and nothing had to be changed to appeal to the international crowd. The album Velli is also believed to be his most successful album, which is believed to have sold over four hundred thousand copies worldwide. Most of the lyrics he sang for the albums were by Balvir Boparai, who is famous for his album Hostel. He also released another album, Jatt Driver Fauji, which contained some of his new and some popular tracks.

Death
He died in a road accident on the Phagwara-Banga road, near Behram village, on 19 March 2006. According to sources, the accident occurred when the Honda City by which Dhillon and his friend Baljinder Billa were travelling, went out of control and collided against a roadside tree.

Kulwinder Dhillon had just released an album titled Akhara. His other albums are "Gareeba Ne Ki Pyar Karna," "Teri Tasveer," "Viah De Vajey" and several Dharmik albums. He has left behind a wife Gurpreet Kaur and son Armaan Dhillon.
