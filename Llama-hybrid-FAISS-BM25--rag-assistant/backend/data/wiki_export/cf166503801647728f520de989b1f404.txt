The Mall at Wellington Green is a two level super-regional shopping mall in Wellington, Florida. The mall features retailers Macy's, Dillard's, JCPenney, Ashley and City Furniture, in addition to CMX Theaters.

History
Upon opening on October 8, 2001, the mall's anchors were Burdines, Dillard's (which opened its first South Florida store at The Galleria at Fort Lauderdale in 1993 and Pembroke Lakes in 1995), JCPenney, and Lord & Taylor, whose store relocated from Palm Beach Mall. 

Wellington Green, alongside Pembroke Lakes Mall, are among the few malls in South Florida that opened without a Jordan Marsh store because their Florida division went defunct before the openings of both malls. Burdines was dual branded as Burdines-Macy's in 2003, and simply Macy's in 2005. Lord & Taylor closed in 2004, and in 2007, that building was split into three tenants: City Furniture on the lower level, and Ashley Furniture and La-Z-Boy on the upper level. La-Z-Boyâ„¢ closed in 2014 to make room for Paragon Theaters, which opened on February 10, 2017, and was purchased by CMX Cinemas on September 19 of the same year. Nordstrom opened in the Fall of 2003, two years after the mall's grand opening. In January 2019, it was announced that Nordstrom had decided against extending its lease again after previously determining the high capacity of additional outposts nearby.

Surrounding area
Several properties surrounding the mall include the Shoppes of Wellington Green, a lifestyle center, and Wellington Green Commons, and a Whole Foods Market-anchored power center encircle the shopping mall.

Incidents
On July 8, 2023, popping sounds heard inside the mall triggered panic, evacuation and a law enforcement response as shoppers feared  a mass shooting was taking place. An investigation later determined the sounds were fireworks set off in a bathroom by a 15 year-old juvenile, who was arrested.
