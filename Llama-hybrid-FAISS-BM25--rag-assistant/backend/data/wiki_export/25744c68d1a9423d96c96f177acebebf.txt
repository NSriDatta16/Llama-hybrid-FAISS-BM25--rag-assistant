He made his first-team debut for Birmingham on 28 August 2007 as a late substitute in a League Cup tie against Hereford United.

Aberdeen (loan)
In August 2007, Aluko joined Scottish Premier League club Aberdeen on loan until January 2008. He made his debut for Aberdeen as a late substitute in the UEFA Cup group match against Panathinaikos on 25 October 2007. He scored his first goal for the club the following week, opening the scoring in a 2–0 victory over Dundee United. In January, the loan deal was extended to keep Aluko at Aberdeen for the rest of the season.

On transfer deadline day, 1 September 2008, Aluko returned to Aberdeen on a permanent basis, signing a three-year contract for a fee of £50,000. He made his return in a 1–2 home defeat to Hamilton Academical on 13 September, and scored his first goal since rejoining the club to clinch Aberdeen's first home win of the season, a single-goal victory over Kilmarnock on 1 November. Aluko went on to win the SPL Young Player of the Month award for November 2008.

He did not score again for the rest of the season, scoring twice in 33 appearances in total during the season. He left the club at the end of his contract in July 2011.

Rangers
Following his release from Aberdeen, Aluko had a trial with Juventus prior to the 2011–12 season. He then went on trial at Rangers. Rangers were impressed with Aluko and offered him a contract, but the move was held up while Aberdeen and Rangers negotiated compensation. Aluko signed for Rangers until the end of the season on 24 November 2011 after a deal was agreed. He made his Rangers debut in a 0–1 away loss to Kilmarnock on 27 November. Aluko was banned for two games for diving to win a penalty in a match between Rangers and Dunfermline on 3 December 2011. Rangers' manager, Ally McCoist, stated "The three gentlemen on the panel have effectively called my player a cheat and a liar, neither of which he is". Aluko scored his first goal for Rangers in a 3–0 home win against Motherwell at Ibrox on 2 January. On 25 March 2012, Aluko scored the opening goal in Rangers' 3–2 victory over Celtic. He scored his first senior hat-trick in Rangers 4–0 victory at St Johnstone on the final day of the 2011–12 Scottish Premier League season. He scored 12 goals in 23 appearances during his first season at Rangers, his best goal return to date.

In June 2012, with his contract set to expire but the club holding an option to extend it, Aluko lodged an objection against the contract being transferred from Rangers to a new company set up by Charles Green. PFA Scotland had previously commented that players were entitled to become free agents if they objected to the transfer. Aluko raised a constructive dismissal claim against Rangers.

Hull City

2012–13 season

On 25 July 2012, it was confirmed that Aluko had signed a two-year deal with Hull City. He made his debut in a home match against Brighton & Hove Albion on 18 August.

His next goal came at the end of October against Bristol City, himself and Jay Simpson linked up to put Hull 1–0 ahead inside 8 minutes, to which the commentator compared the goal to Barcelona. He bagged another goal in the next game, at home to Barnsley, with teammate Ahmed Elmohamady's cross was half-cleared and Aluko, unlike Barnsley's defenders, was alert to the ball and fired home from a tight angle. He then made it 3 in 3 and 6 goals for the season against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 6 November, putting in a free-kick from 25 yards into the bottom-left corner past Wolves goalkeeper Carl Ikeme. On 17 November, Aluko scored twice against former club Birmingham City to put Hull 0–2 up, they went on to win the game 2–3. This made it five goals in five games for Aluko and eight goals for the season. In November 2012, Aluko picked up an Achilles injury, initially ruling him out for a month, which Hull City incidentally won all four games he was missing, but later in January the injury flared up again. This meant he would require surgery, with fears he would be out for 6 months, but after successful surgery, he was expected to be back in 2 months time.

In November Steve Bruce announced that Aluko denied a contract extension, this blow to Hull came shortly after Aluko tore his Achilles again which would see him out of action until February. He signed a new two-and-a-half-year contract with the club on 3 January 2014, telling the club website "I'm happy to be extending my stay here and I was always hopeful it would get sorted".

He captained the team in FA Cup and EFL Trophy matches during the first half of the season. Ipswich manager Kieran McKenna praised him for his contributions both on and off the pitch; “I can't speak highly enough of him as a person really, around the place he's great with the younger players, he mentors, he speaks, he gives advice but he never sticks it in your face, he doesn't go around telling everyone that he's played in the Premier League, but he's there for advice whenever people need it. He has a quiet word in his own way whenever it's needed.” On 26 April 2022, Aluko activated the one-year extension in his contract having made 36 appearances in all competitions during the season, keeping him at the club until 2023.

Nigeria
Aluko was named in the squad for the Nigeria under-20 national football team for the 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Egypt. He played in games against Venezuela, Spain and Tahiti.

He made his full international debut in the starting eleven, forcing the Irish goalkeeper to save his 40-yard lobbed free kick and playing the first 61 minutes of the game.

In April 2010, he was named in the provisional Nigeria squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, but failed to make the final cut.
