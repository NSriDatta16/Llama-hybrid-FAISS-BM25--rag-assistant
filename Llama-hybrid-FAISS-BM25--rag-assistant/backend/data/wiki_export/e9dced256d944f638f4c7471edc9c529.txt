is a railway station in the Asakusa district of Taitō, Tokyo, Japan, operated by Tobu Railway, Tokyo Metro, and Toei Subway. It forms one terminus of the original subway line in Tokyo, now the Ginza Line.

Station layout
There is a connecting passage from the Tobu station to the Tokyo Metro station, and a connecting passage from the Tokyo Metro portion to the Toei portion. However, there are no direct connecting passages from the Toei portion to the Tobu portion or from the Tsukuba Express station to the rest of the station complex. Passengers wishing to transfer between the Toei and the Tobu stations have to walk at street level, while passengers transferring between the Tsukuba Express station and the rest of the complex must also walk at street level, as the Tsukuba Express station is located  to the west of the station complex.

Tobu Railway

The Tobu Railway terminal is a surface station, which occupies a portion of the Matsuya Department Store. The station is used by local and limited express trains. Although Asakusa is the most "central" terminal of the Skytree Line, it is connected to the next major terminal, Kita-Senju Station, by a length of track with sharp curves, beginning with the first stretch leaving the station, where trains have to turn 90 degrees to the right at a maximum speed of  to cross the Sumida River. In part due to the station's somewhat awkward location, most "Express" and "Semi-Express" services on the Skytree Line run through  to the Tokyo Metro Hanzōmon Line instead of continuing to Asakusa. 

Due to the track curvature that makes the eastern end of some of the platforms narrow and dangerous, platform 1 can accommodate 8-car trains, and the other platforms can only accommodate 6-car trains. Longer trains, such as the 8-car local trains terminating on platform 2, keep the doors of the two easternmost cars closed through selective door operation.
