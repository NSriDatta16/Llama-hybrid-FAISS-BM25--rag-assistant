Universities Ireland is an organisation that promotes collaboration and co-operation between universities in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. It was launched in July 2003 by the nine university presidents on the island of Ireland, with Professor Gerry McKenna, Vice Chancellor and President of the University of Ulster, as founding chair. It is funded by the member universities themselves; the Department of Education in the Republic of Ireland; the Department for Employment and Learning in Northern Ireland; and InterTradeIreland, an all-island body under the North/South Ministerial Council.
