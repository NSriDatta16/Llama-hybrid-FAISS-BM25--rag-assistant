Redevelopment

Oakridge Park is the over 5 million square foot centre point for the Oakridge Municipal Town Centre Project, a Vancouver urban densification program that aims to create a new transit-oriented, high density hub. It would be surrounded by tall apartment towers ( condos, market rental, affordable rental and social housing ) much like Vancouver's West End, replacing a neighbourhood of single-family residences, centered around the Canada Line's Oakridge-41st station. The application was approved in 2014 and construction began in late 2019. The North and South tower complexes are scheduled to be completed by late 2025. The redevelopment, is the vision of Vancouver design architects Henriquez Partners aided by executive architects Adamson Architects and DSAI Architects both of Toronto, is estimated to have a project cost well over  and would include an integrated city park and community centre, theatre, library, large daycare, performance venues, office space within the retail complex. On September 15, 2020, it was announced that the mall would be closing on September 30 to demolish the structure to make way for the redevelopment. Crate & Barrel and the office towers would remain open during the construction.
