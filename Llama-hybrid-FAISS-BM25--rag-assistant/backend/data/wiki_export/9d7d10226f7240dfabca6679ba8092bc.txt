David Jemmali (born 13 December 1974) is a former professional footballer who played as a defender. Born in France, he represented Tunisia at international level. He spent most of his career at FC Girondins de Bordeaux.

In his time at Bordeaux, he won Ligue 1 in the 1998â€“99 season and the Coupe de la Ligue in 2002 and 2007.

Hoping for a selection to the France national team, he turned down several opportunities to represent Tunisia. However, when the 2006 World Cup was approaching, Jemmali accepted the offer and made his debut for the "Eagles of Carthage" on 1 March 2006 against Serbia and Montenegro. He was subsequently called up to the 2006 World Cup. Jemmali started Tunisia's first game of the 2006 World Cup against Saudi Arabia but did not appear in the other two group matches.
