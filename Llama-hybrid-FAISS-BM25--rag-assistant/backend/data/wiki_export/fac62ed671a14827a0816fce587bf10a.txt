GlyphX Inc. was a computer graphics designer studio that has been producing promotional videos, cinematics and artwork for various video games for several years before going into video game design. The third-person shooter Advent Rising, the first and the latest video game created by GlyphX Games, LLC, the game designer branch of the company, had been long anticipated by critics and fans of the genre, but turned out to be rather a disappointment for both. However, the company intends to produce more games in the future.  GlyphX was acquired by Sandman Studios circa 2006.
