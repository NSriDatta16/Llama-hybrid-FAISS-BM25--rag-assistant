History

A portion of modern VT 11 in the town of Winhall was part of an early toll road known as the Peru Turnpike.

In 1922, the six New England states adopted a uniform road marking system that assigned route numbers from 1 to 99 for inter-state routes. VT 11 was originally assigned its designation as part of New England Interstate Route 11, which ran  between New England Route 4 in Manchester, Vermont and New England Route 1 in Biddeford, Maine. Vermont formally established its state highway system in 1931, at which time the state took over maintenance of the western two-thirds of the route, between Manchester Center and Chester center, as well as the portion in Springfield along the Black River. The section from Chester center to Springfield center remained a town-maintained road until being transferred to the state in 1941.

VT 11 was extended south from Manchester Center to the New York state line west of Arlington by 1938, replacing VT 123. The portion of VT 11 between the state line and Arlington was co-designated as VT 313 from New York to Arlington by 1940, leading to the truncation of VT 11 back to Manchester Center between 1947 and 1952.
