Sir Charles Tupper Secondary School is a public secondary school located in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

History
Opened in 1959, the school is named in honour of Sir Charles Tupper, Canada's 6th Prime Minister. Originally serving only grades 7, 8 and 9, the school grew to include grades 10, 11 and 12 by 1965. 

On November 28th, 2003, a 17 year-old student was beaten to death on the school grounds.  A former student was later convicted and sentenced to 7 years in prison for his role in the attack. In the years since the killing the culture of the school has changed dramatically, with students and staff embracing a new school code of conduct which advocates respect, ownership, attitude, responsibility, and safety. 

Today Tupper serves grades 8 through 12. 
On September 29, 2009, the school celebrated its 50th Anniversary, with hosts Friends of Tupper Fund.

Programs Offered

Mini School
Established in 2000, Tupper's Mini School Program seeks academically motivated students looking for a challenge in the learning environment. Mini students attend enriched academic courses, however classes such as Physical Education and various electives are spent with the main school body.

Tupper Tech
Tupper Tech provides career focused grade 12 students the opportunity to gain experience in the trades, while working towards a full time apprenticeship. Working on a Day 1 / Day 2 rotation, students rotate each day between "hands on" education and academic classes. Many students are cross enrolled within other schools in the district, spending one day at Tupper, while returning to their home school for academic classes.
