Weathers was quoted as saying of Cincinnati, "I really felt like this is probably where I would end my career, and I really wanted to. But in this game, things don't go like you want them or how you plan them. It's a good day but, to be honest with you, it's a tough day emotionally because you form a lot of bonds, a lot of trust with guys you've been with for five or six years. You just don't find that every day, especially in this game." Weathers played 25 more games with the Brewers before playing in his final Major League game on October 3, 2009.
