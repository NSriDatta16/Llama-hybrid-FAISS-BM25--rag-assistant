"Super-Charger Heaven" (sometimes referred to as "Devil Man" due to its chorus) is the third and final single off White Zombie's 1995 studio album, Astro-Creep: 2000. The song can also be found on Rob Zombie's Past, Present & Future, the greatest hits album The Best of Rob Zombie, and a remix can be found on Supersexy Swingin' Sounds. The artwork for the single incorporates the Japanese superhero Devilman, who is also referenced in the chorus of the song.

Music and lyrics
Like many White Zombie songs, the song contains clips from old horror films. The song opens with spoken words: "Look, I know the supernatural is something that isn't supposed to happen, but it does happen", a sample from the 1963 film The Haunting.

The song contains a section of spoken Latin, from the 1976 Hammer film To the Devil a Daughter. The Latin states: Insipientia corde suo, non es deus. Non est vita qui adorem, non es usque ad unum. Es excommunicatus, ex unione fidelium. ("Foolish of heart, thou art not a god. There is no life for those who do not adore, and to a man thou hast not. Thou art excommunicated from the union of the faithful.")

Another line from the same film, "It is not heresy, and I will not recant!", is also spoken by actor Christopher Lee and sampled in "Super-Charger Heaven".

The lyrics contain the line "Bury me an angel,/God, I need some inspiration", a reference to the 1971 film Bury Me an Angel.  The song also includes the line "ring-a-ding rhythm", which was a film about jazz by Amicus Films.

Music video
