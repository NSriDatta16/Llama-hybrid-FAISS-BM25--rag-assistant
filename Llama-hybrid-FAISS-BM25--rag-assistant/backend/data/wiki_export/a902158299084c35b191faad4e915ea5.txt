Hispar Glacier (; ) is a 49-km (30-mile) long glacier situated in the Karakoram Mountains of Gilgitâ€“Baltistan, Pakistan. It converges with the  Biafo Glacier, which extends for 67 kilometers (42 miles), at the Hispar La (Pass), reaching an altitude of 5,128 meters (16,824 feet). This confluence creates the world's longest glacial system outside of the polar regions.

Details
The 100-km (62-mile) long ice highwayserves as a connecting route between two ancient mountain kingdoms: Nagar in the west and Baltistan in the east. The upper half of Biafo is particularly challenging due to the steep terrain and strenuous boulder hopping required on the lateral moraines and hillsides. The traverse becomes especially demanding when crossing the four major tributary glaciers from the north, and potential high nullah (stream) crossings can be hazardous.

Rivers
The Hispar River, a tributary of the Hunza River, rises from the meltwater of the glacier.
