Sør-Frøya is a former municipality in the old Sør-Trøndelag county, Norway. The  municipality existed from 1906 until its dissolution in 1964. Sør-Frøya included the southwestern part of the island of Frøya in what is now the municipality of Frøya in Trøndelag county. The main population center of Sør-Frøya was the village of Titran on the western tip of the island. The main church for the municipality was Hallaren Church (Sør-Frøya Church) which is located in Storhallaren on the southern coast of the island.

History

The municipality was established on 1 January 1906 when the old municipality of Frøien was divided into two new municipalities: Sør-Frøya in the south (population: 2,091) and Nord-Frøya in the north (population: 3,972). During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the municipalities of Sør-Frøya (population: 2,208) and Nord-Frøya (population: 4,348) were merged to form the municipality of Frøya.

Name
The municipality is named after the island of Frøya. The prefix  means "southern", literally meaning the southern part of Frøya. The second part of the name comes from Norse mythology. Although Frøya is a variant of the name of the Norse goddess Freyja, the Old Norse form of the name of the island was Frøy or Frey (the ending -a in the modern form is actually the definite article - so the meaning of Frøya is 'the Frøy'). Therefore, the name of the island probably has the same root as the name of the Norse god Freyr, brother to Freyja. The names originally were titles: "lord" or "lady". The oldest meaning of the common word was "(the one) in front; the foremost, the leading" and here in the sense "the island in front of Hitra". Until 1906, the island and municipality name was spelled Frøien (-en is the definite article in Danish-Norwegian).

Government
While it existed, this municipality was responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment, social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads. During its existence, this municipality was governed by a municipal council of elected representatives, which in turn elected a mayor.
