If I Should Love Again is the eighth studio album released by singer and songwriter Barry Manilow. The album was recorded at United Western Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California. The album was released in 1981, and it was certified gold.

Manilow refers to it as "The most romantic album that I ever made", and remarks "I was so caught up in romance that I actually wrote music and lyrics to the title song while playing the piano facing the ocean, in a rented house on the beach in Atlantic City, New Jersey."

Reception

Bryan Buss of AllMusic retrospectively called the album "classic Barry Manilow; shamelessly well-crafted adult contemporary."  He concluded his review by saying "It may not be the biggest album of his career, but If I Should Love Again showcases Manilow's greatest skill: making heartbreak sound hopeful."
