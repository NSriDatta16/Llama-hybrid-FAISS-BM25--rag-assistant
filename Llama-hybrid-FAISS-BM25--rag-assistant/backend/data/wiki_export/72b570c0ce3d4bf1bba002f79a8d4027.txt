Plot 
Bangaram is a reporter at a news channel who dreams of getting into an international news channel of BBC. To fulfill his dream, he needs Peddi Reddy's signature but gets entangled with his daughters Sandhya and Vindhya. Later, Bhooma Reddy wins over Peddi's heart and is able to convince him to marry Sandhya to his brother, but Sandhya already has her own love story with Vinay. Bangaram, feeling guilty about foiling Sandhya's escape plan and the mean looks from Vindhya, decides to help her by taking her to the city. Later, Vinay also loses contact with them because of the confusion caused by a bomb blast. Bangaram is able to find Vinay with the help of a driver and his company. Bhooma and his goons chase them, but each time, Bangaram saves Sandhya and Vinay. Unable to capture Sandhya, Bhooma kidnaps Vindhya and blackmails Bangaram that his brother will marry her if Sandhya is not returned. Bangaram goes to Bhooma, kills him and his henchmen, and saves Vindhya. In the end, it is revealed that Bangaram ultimately finds his own love during a train journey.
