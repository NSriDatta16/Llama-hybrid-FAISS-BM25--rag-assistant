History 

In the 1970s, Pedro Antonio Ríos Reyna presented a plan to build a theatre to serve as the residence of the Venezuela Symphony Orchestra. The Simón Bolivar Center expanded the project so that the center would serve multiple uses.

The funds for construction were granted in September 1970, and the architects were Tomás Lugo, Jesús Sandoval, and Dietrich Kunckel.

The theatre was inaugurated in two phases: the José Félix Ribas Hall in February 1976, followed by the Ríos Reyna Hall and the rest of the complex on 19 April 1983.

The center facilities have been expanded with two exhibition halls, one dedicated to the pianist Teresa Carreño and another one to the composer Reynaldo Hahn.
