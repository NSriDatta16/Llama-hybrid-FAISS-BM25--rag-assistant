History
Feldheim Publishers was founded in 1939 by Philipp Feldheim, a Viennese Jew who escaped Nazi Austria that year. He  made his home in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, NYC where he was a founder of the Vienner Kehilla there. Later he moved to Washington Heights, New York near Congregation Khal Adath Jeshurun founded by Rabbi Dr. Joseph Breuer (1882–1980). Feldheim opened a small bookshop on the Lower East Side, and witnessing customer demand for Jewish literature, decided to go into Jewish publishing under the name Philipp Feldheim Inc.

Feldheim Publishers was the first to produce Torah books with professional graphics. It also pioneered the publication of biographies of modern-day Orthodox Jewish figures such as Rabbi Aryeh Levin (A Tzaddik in Our Time) and Rabbi Yaakov Yosef Herman (All For the Boss).

From the beginning, the company, which markets under the slogan “Torah Literature of Quality”, committed itself to publishing the classics of Torah literature. These included age-old classics such as Duties of the Heart (translation of Chovot ha-Levavot), The Path of the Just (translation of Mesillat Yesharim), The Way of God (translation of Derech Hashem), and The Kuzari: In Defense of the Despised Faith (by Rabbi Yehuda Halevi), along with modern works such as Strive for Truth (translation of Michtav MiEliyahu by Rabbi Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler), Shemirath Shabbath KiHilchatho (by Rabbi Yehoshua Neuwirth), and Book of Our Heritage (translation of Sefer HaToda’ah by Rabbi Eliyahu Kitov, translated by Rabbi Nachman Bulman). The Feldheim library includes most of the works by Samson Raphael Hirsch, including his collected writings and commentaries on the Chumash, siddur, Haggadah of Pesach, and Tehillim.

Distributor
Feldheim Publishers acted as Targum Press's distributor.

Israeli division
Feldheim established an Israeli division on Beit Hadfus Street in Jerusalem in 1960.

Bankruptcy
In February 2012 Feldheim's Israeli division declared bankruptcy. The filing was not connected with Philipp Feldheim, Inc., the New York publishing division.
