Edmond Amran El Maleh () (30 March 1917 – 15 November 2010) was a Moroccan Jewish writer of Berber extraction.

Biography
El Maleh was born in Safi, Morocco to a Jewish Berber family. He moved to Paris in 1965, working there as a journalist and a teacher of philosophy.

He only began writing in 1980, at the age of 63, traveling back and forth between France and Morocco. He stated that, in spite of his long stay in France, he had devoted his entire literary life to Morocco. From 1999 until his death he lived in Rabat.

El Maleh was an anti-Zionist and declared that his father had taught him that Zionism had nothing to do with Judaism, and that what Jews were doing to Palestinians was against the principles of the Jewish faith. He remained as a result isolated and ignored by most of the Moroccan Jewish community.
He was buried, according to his wishes, in the Jewish cemetery in Essaouira. He wrote in French.
