Rescue 21 is an advanced maritime computing, command, control, and communications (C4) system designed to manage communications for the United States Coast Guard.

Overview

Rescue 21 is designed to be more robust, reliable, and capable than the legacy system by using a modern radio system coupled with a TCP/IP network, and digital communication using VoIP.  It was created to better locate mariners in distress and save lives and property at sea and on navigable rivers.

To address the limitations of the current communications system, the National Distress and Response System (NDRS), the Coast Guard has implemented a major systems acquisition program entitled Rescue 21.

Rescue 21 enables the Coast Guard to perform all missions with greater agility and efficiency. The new system will close 88 known coverage gaps in coastal areas of the United States, enhancing the safety of life at sea. The system's expanded system frequency capacity enables greater coordination with the Department of Homeland Security, as well as other federal, state and local agencies, and first responders.

When completed, this vital major systems acquisition will provide an updated, leading-edge Very High Frequency – Frequency Modulated (VHF-FM) communications system, replacing the National Distress Response System installed and deployed during the 1970s. Rescue 21 will cover more than  of coastline, navigable rivers and waterways in the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and Puerto Rico. Remote sites in Alaska and along the Western Rivers are scheduled to receive modified Rescue 21 coverage by 2017.  By replacing outdated legacy technology with a fully integrated system, Rescue 21 provides the Coast Guard with upgraded tools and technology to protect the nation's coasts and rescue mariners at sea. The name Rescue 21 is a reference to taking the Search out of Search and Rescue.

Rescue 21 was designed and is supported by General Dynamics Mission Systems out of Scottsdale, Arizona.

NDRS Technology
The National Distress and Response System (NDRS) was established more than 30 years ago as a VHF-FM-based radio communication system that has a range of up to  along most of the U.S. shoreline. While this system has served the Coast Guard well over the years, it consists of out-of-date and non-standard equipment with many limitations. These include:

No direction finding capability. 
Numerous geographic communication coverage gaps. 
Limited interoperability with other emergency response services. 
Single-channel radio operation, which prohibits the ability to receive multiple radio calls.

Rescue 21 technology
Rescue 21 will provide the United States with a 21st-century maritime command, control, and communications (C3) system that encompasses the entire United States. By replacing outdated technology with a fully integrated C3 system, Rescue 21 improves on the NDRS with the following enhancements: interoperability, direction-finding equipment with 2 degrees Root Mean Square of accuracy, enhanced clarity of distress calls, simultaneous channel monitoring, upgraded playback and recording feature for distress calls, reduced coverage gaps, and supporting Digital Selective Calling (DSC).

Features
• Improved information sharing and coordination with the Department of Homeland Security and
federal, state and local first responders

• Geographic display to assist in identifying hoax callers, conserving valuable response resources

• Supports Digital Selective Calling (DSC), which allows mariners in distress with DSC-equipped radios
to transmit, at the push of a button, their exact GPS position and vital vessel information to the Coast
Guard and other DSC-equipped vessels

• Enhances clarity and provides recording and playback capabilities for all communications

• Simultaneous monitoring and relaying of information over multiple radio frequencies

• Provides portable tower communications during emergencies and natural disasters

• Automates transmission of urgent marine information broadcasts
