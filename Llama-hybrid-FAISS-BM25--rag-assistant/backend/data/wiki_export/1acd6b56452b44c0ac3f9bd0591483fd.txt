History
Castle Rising's name is of Norman and Anglo-Saxon origin, deriving from a mix of the Old English and Norman French for a castle close to the settlement of Risa's people.

In the Domesday Book, Rising is listed as a settlement of fourteen households in the hundred of Grimshoe. The village was owned by William de Warenne.

Castle Rising Castle was built in the 1140s on the orders of William d'Aubigny and was most famously the residence of Queen Isabella after her role in the murder of King Edward II. The castle was subsequently passed to Edward of Woodstock and is now in the possession of Greville Howard.

Prior to the Reform Act of 1832, Castle Rising was a parliamentary borough yet due to its small population it was often labelled as an example of a rotten borough. Samuel Pepys was the member for Castle Rising between 1673 and 1679 as was Robert Walpole between 1701 and 1702

Geography
In the 2011 Census, Castle Rising was reported as having 216 residents living in 116 households.

Castle Rising lies within the constituency of North West Norfolk and is thus represented by James Wild MP of the Conservative Party at Parliament.
