History 

Udayan Bidyalaya started in June 1955..  At that time it was not called "Udayan Bidyalaya," instead it was known as "Dhaka English Preparatory School." From 1955 until 1992, it was located on the land next to the Vice-Chancellor's house of Dhaka University.

The Dhaka English Preparatory school started functioning when menials quarters attached to the residence of the vice-chancellor were renovated. After additions and alterations, the school started functioning.  The land and the renovated semi-constructed building were leased out to the school on a nominal rent of taka ten per month.

The syndicate of Dhaka University in a meeting held on 31 May 1969 granted permission to the school to construct another story on the school building. The university gave permission to change the name of Dhaka English Preparatory school as Udayan Bidyalaya and also to its upgrading as a high school.

The Government of Bangladesh, on 31 October 1980, approved the managing committee for the Bidyalaya under rule 20(2) of the Managing Committee Regulations of 1977. The Dhaka Education Board installed the first such committee by an official order in November 1980 and the second such committee on 25 January 1984.

On 14 March 1986, the foundation of the five-storied new building was inaugurated by the former Vice-Chancellor of Dhaka University, Prof. Abdul Mannan Choudhury. In 1991, the school received the award of the best school in the country. On 13 November 1991, the students had their first class day in the new building. However, in 1992, the school physically moved to its new five storied building located at 3/3 Fullar Road near Salimullah Muslim Hall of Dhaka University.

In 1997 the school opened its Higher Secondary Program and renamed as Udayan Higher Secondary School.
