As of the 2010 census, there are five United States congressional districts in Oklahoma. It was one of the states that was able to keep the same number of congressional districts from the previous census (in the past, Oklahoma has had as many as nine House of Representatives seats). Following the 2018 elections, a Democratic challenger ousted a Republican incumbent, changing the congressional delegation to a 4-1 Republican majority. The Republicans regained the seat in 2020 when Stephanie Bice defeated Horn. Along with Vermont & Delaware, Oklahoma has never gained a congressional seat.
