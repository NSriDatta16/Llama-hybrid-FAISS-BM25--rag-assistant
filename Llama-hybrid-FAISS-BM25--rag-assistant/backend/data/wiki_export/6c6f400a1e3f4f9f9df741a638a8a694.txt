History
The municipality of Grindum was established on 1 January 1902 when the old municipality of Bjelland og Grindum was divided into two separate municipalities: Grindheim (population: 909) and Bjelland (population: 907). During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, Grindheim (population: 701) was merged with the Ågedal and Midtbø areas (located just east of the lake Ytre Øydnavatnet; population: 96) in Bjelland and the neighboring municipality of Konsmo (population: 712) to create the new municipality of Audnedal.

Name

The last element is  which means "home" or "abode". Prior to 1889, the name was written as Grindem.  Then from 1889 to 1917, the spelling was changed to Grindum.  Then again in 1918, the spelling was changed to its present form: Grindheim.
