Dirashe Zone is one of the zones in the South Ethiopia Regional State of Ethiopia. In 2011, the Segen Area Peoples Zone was established, which includes Dirashe woreda and the 3 former special woredas surrounding it.

History 

In April 2002, several persons were killed and numerous houses were burned during fighting over a land dispute between the Dirashe and the Zayse. Local ruling party officials had incited the violence between the previously peaceful groups. By the end of the following year, the responsible local officials, who included the former woreda administrator, were found guilty of inciting the violence between the previously peaceful groups.

Human Rights Watch interviewed farmers on 25 June 2009, who claimed that they had been dispossessed of their lands and forced out of their homes for supporting opposition parties.
