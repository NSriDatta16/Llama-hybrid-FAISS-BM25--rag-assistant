October 9 – The Cincinnati Reds defeat the Chicago White Sox, 10-5, in Game 8 of the World Series to win their first World Championship, five games to three.  The events of the series are often associated with the Black Sox Scandal, when several members of the Chicago franchise conspired with gamblers to throw World Series games.
