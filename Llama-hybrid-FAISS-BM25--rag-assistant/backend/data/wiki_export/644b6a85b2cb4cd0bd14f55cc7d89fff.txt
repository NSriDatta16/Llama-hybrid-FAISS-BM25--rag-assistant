Plot
Jeetu, the son of a retired teacher named Jaidev Prasad, is debt-ridden due to many failed businesses. Jeetu breaks off his engagement with his fiancé, Pooja and decides to commit suicide by throwing himself into the sea to claim insurance money that his father could use to pay off his debts. However, Jeetu is found tangled in the fishing nets by a pair of fishermen, Gundya and Bandya who rescue him and mistake him to be mute and deaf.

Gundya owes money to a Gujarati businessman, Prabhat Singh Chauhan, who takes away Gundya's boat. Gundya cunningly makes Prabhat believe that Jeetu is his loving nephew and leaves both Jeetu and Bandya in Prabhat's house as the guarantee until he returns the money. Prabhat's niece Shruti is mute too, but not deaf. Her overprotective brother Mangal wants her to get married, however, her muteness makes her an undesirable match. One night, Shruti and her cousin Meenakshi learn Jeetu's secret and makes him break off Shruti's undesirable marriage match to keep his secret.

Shruti and Meenakshi send money to Jeetu's village through Bandya to repay his debts. Bandya returns from the village and tells Jeetu that Pooja is married now. Unaware that Pooja believes herself to be Jeetu's widow, is living with Jeetu's family. At the same time, Shruti confesses her love for Jeetu. Mangal approves their marriage after Jeetu reveals he is not deaf and mute. Later, Mangal sends Gundya and Bandya to deliver a suitcase of money to Jeetu's family to secure their financial well-being. However, while delivering the money they inadvertently reveal that Jeetu is alive. Shocked, Jaidev demands that they take him to Jeetu. Jaidev arrives at Prabhat's house during Jeetu and Shruti's engagement ceremony and sees him alive.

Jaidev reveals to Jeetu that Pooja is living as his widow and implores him to return home and marry Pooja. Jeetu later goes back home to speak to his family but they demand he marry Pooja, and Gundya and Bandya bring him back. On the day of the wedding, Jeetu's family intrude on the marriage, wanting for him to return and marry Pooja instead. However, when Pooja learns that Shruti is mute, she has a change of heart and tells Jeetu to marry Shruti. Jeetu and Shruti get married and live happily.
