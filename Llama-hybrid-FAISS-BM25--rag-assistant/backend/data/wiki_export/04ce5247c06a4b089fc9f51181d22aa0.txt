Parliament building

In 1975, the parliament building was opened for the Island Council of Aruba. The council did not have its own building, and had been renting locations in Oranjestad for almost 25 years. The building was officially called "Edificio di parlemento di Aruba". In 1 January 1986, the Status aparte was granted to Aruba making it a constituent country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The Parliament of Aruba became the successor of the Island Council. 

In 2011, construction started on a large extension of the Parliament Building.
