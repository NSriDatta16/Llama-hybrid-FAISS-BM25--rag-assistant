Taz Express is a video game for the Nintendo 64, that was released only in Europe and Australia in 2000.

Gameplay 
In the game, the player controls Taz and must deliver crates to various destinations in the game. The crate must remain intact until it reaches its intended destination. Each player starts with three lives that are shaped like crates. If the crate is destroyed by dropping or by Taz's spin or falls into the hole or water, the player will lose a life; if the player loses all three lives, the game is over. If the player collects all fifty tokens in each level, at the end of the level, they obtain an extra life for a crate. At the beginning of the level, Taz has full energy, which allows him to run faster; low energy will cause Taz to slow if he is hit by cars, lasers, falls into water, hole, ground, or other things that may hurt him. His spin ability can only be activated when Taz's running bar is full.

Reception 

The game received polarizing feedback from critics. Some reviews were favorable, such as Nintendo Acci√≥n's 88/100 score and Official Nintendo Magazine's 85% praise, while other reviews like N64 Magazine's 27% rating and Consoles +'s 5% criticism were far less positive.
