Joseph Paul Sindelar (born March 30, 1958) is an American professional golfer who currently plays on the PGA Tour Champions. He previously played on the PGA Tour, winning seven tournaments between 1985 and 2004.

Early life
Sindelar was born in Fort Knox, Kentucky, while his father served in the Army, but he lived in Horseheads, New York, for most of his life. He was a childhood friend and high school golf rival of fellow PGA Tour player Mike Hulbert.

Sindelar attended Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio, where he was a distinguished member of the school's golf team. He was a three-time All-American, a member of the 1979 NCAA Championship team, and Ohio State's Athlete of the Year in 1981. Sindelar was inducted into the Ohio State Varsity O Hall of Fame in 1992.

Professional career
Sindelar turned pro in 1981. He won seven PGA Tour events and was one of the most consistent players on the tour, with more than 80 top-10 finishes in his career. Sindelar had ten top-10 finishes in 1988, including victories at The Honda Classic and The International. He played on the 1991 World Cup team. His best finish in a major was T6 at the 1992 U.S. Open. Sindelar scored a double eagle at the 2006 PGA Championship, which was only the third time such a score had been recorded in that competition's history.
