Gnidrolog was a British progressive rock band.

History
The band was founded in 1969 by twin brothers Colin and Stewart Goldring, who were joined by drummer Nigel Pegrum from Spice and Peter "Mars" Cowling on bass. John Earle joined the band on saxophone and flute for their second album. They came up with the band name by reversing and slightly rearranging the brothers' surname, adding in an extra "o".  In May 1972, the British music magazine NME reported that Gnidrolog was to appear at the Great Western Express Lincoln Festival on 26 May that year, along with Budgie, Skin Alley, Tea & Symphony, John Martyn, and Warhorse.  In 1972, Gnidrolog released both their first and second albums, In Spite of Harry's Toe-Nail and Lady Lake, before disbanding due to a lack of commercial success.  Despite having played gigs with acts such as David Bowie,  Colosseum, King Crimson, Gentle Giant, Wishbone Ash, Soft Machine, and Magma in their brief career, they have always remained relatively obscure.

Cowling began a long working relationship with Pat Travers in 1975.

After disbanding, Nigel Pegrum joined Steeleye Span, while the Goldring brothers formed the punk rock band the Pork Dukes in 1976, and later went on to do session work, as did other members. After a break of 27 years, they got back together in 1999, and released their third studio album, Gnosis, in 2000. John "Irish" Earle went on to be a successful musician, playing with artists such as Thin Lizzy, Ian Dury and the Clash.
