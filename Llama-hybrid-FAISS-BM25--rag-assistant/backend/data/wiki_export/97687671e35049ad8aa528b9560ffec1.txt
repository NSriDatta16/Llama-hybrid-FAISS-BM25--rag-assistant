Lieutenant Colonel Hugh Richard Scarlett, 7th Baron Abinger,  (25 November 1878 â€“ 21 July 1943) was a British Army officer and peer.

Family
Scarlett was the son of Lieutenant Colonel Leopold James Yorke Campbell Scarlett, himself son of Peter Campbell Scarlett, third son of James Scarlett, 1st Baron Abinger. His mother, Bessie Florence Gibson, was the daughter of Edward Gibson, but had been adopted by Sir Percy Shelley, 3rd Baronet, and his wife. On the death of his kinsman, the 4th Baron Abinger, in December 1903, Scarlett's elder brother Shelley Scarlett succeeded as the 5th Baron Abinger. The following year, Hugh (along with his siblings Robert, Ruth, Percy, and Leopold) were allowed to use the style The Honourable by a Royal Warrant of Precedence. On his eldest brother's death without male heirs in 1917, the next brother Robert Scarlett succeeded as the 6th Baron Abinger. He too, died without male heirs, and Hugh succeeded to the Barony in 1927.

Scarlett married Marjorie Ursula MacPhillamy in 1913; they had three sons, James Richard Scarlett (who succeeded to the title upon his father's death), John Leopold Campbell Scarlett, and Felix Hugh Lawrence Scarlett.
