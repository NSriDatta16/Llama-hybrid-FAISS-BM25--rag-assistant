August von Finck Sr. (18 July 1898 – 22 April 1980) was a German banker. Due to his close connections with the Hitler's regime, he was called "Hitler's banker". 

He was the son of Marie Fäustle and banker Vilhelm von Finck (1848–1924), founder of insurance giant Allianz and private bank Merck Finck & Co. Following the Anschluss of Austria to Nazi Germany, his business benefited greatly when the Nazis seized the Vienna-based firm of S M von Rothschild and in October 1939 sold it to Merck, Finck & Co. His son August von Finck Jr. sold the businesses to Barclays in 1990.
