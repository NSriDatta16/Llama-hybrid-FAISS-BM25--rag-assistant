Nicolae Steinhardt (; born Nicu-Aurelian Steinhardt; July 29, 1912 – March 29, 1989) was a Romanian writer, Orthodox monk and lawyer. His main book, Jurnalul Fericirii, is regarded as a major text of 20th century Romanian literature and a prime example of Eastern European anti-Communist literature.

Biography

Early life
He was born in Pantelimon commune, near Bucharest, from a Jewish father and a Romanian mother. His father was an engineer, architect and decorated World War I participant (following the Battle of Mărăști). Due to his lineage from his father's side, he was subjected to antisemitic discrimination during the successive fascist governments of World War II Romania.

Between 1919 and 1929, he attended  in Bucharest, where, despite his background, he was instructed in religion by a Christian priest. His talent for writing was first noticed when he joined the Sburătorul literary circle.

Early career and World War II
In 1934, he earned his diploma from the Law and Literature School of the University of Bucharest. Under the pseudonym Antisthius (taken from La Bruyères Caractères), he published his first volume, the parodic novel  ("In the Manner of Cioran, Noica, Eliade..."). In 1936, he earned his PhD in Constitutional Law, and between 1937 and 1938, he travelled to Switzerland, Austria, France, and England.

In 1939, Steinhardt worked as an editor for Revista Fundațiilor Regale (a government-sponsored literary magazine), losing his job between 1940 and 1944, due to antisemitic policies, first under the Iron Guard regime (the National Legionary State), and then the government led by Ion Antonescu. Despite this, he would forgive Antonescu, and even praise him for allegedly having saved several hundred thousand Jews (which he claimed had occurred after a face-to-face debate with Adolf Hitler at Berchtesgaden).

Communist persecutions and imprisonment
In 1944, after Romania switched sides and joined the Allies, Steinhardt was reinstated at the Revista Fundațiilor Regale, and held his job until 1948, when King Michael I was forced to abdicate by the Communist Party of Romania.

From 1948 until 1959, he experienced a new period of persecution, this time from the Romanian Communist regime, during which non-communist intellectuals were deemed "enemies of the people". In 1959, during the show trial of the fascist collaborator (and Steinhardt's former school colleague) Constantin Noica, he refused to take part as a witness against Noica. As a consequence, he was accused of "crimes of conspiracy against social order", he was included in the "group of mystical-Iron Guardist intellectuals", and sentenced to thirteen years of forced labor, in Gulag-like prisons. He would serve his penalty at Jilava, Gherla, Aiud, and other prisons.

While in prison, Steinhardt converted to Orthodox Christianity. He was baptized on March 15, 1960 by fellow convict Mina Dobzeu, a well known Bessarabian hermit. Emanuel Vidrașcu, a former chief of staff and adjutant of Antonescu, served as Steinhardt's godfather. Witnesses to the baptism included the politician Alexandru Paleologu, two Roman Catholic priests, two Greek-Catholic priests and a Protestant priest. He would later state that his baptism had an "ecumenical character". This episode in his life would serve as the basis for his best-known and most celebrated work, Jurnalul Fericirii ("The Happiness Diary").

Later years
After his release from prison in 1964 (due to the general amnesty of political prisoners) he began a successful career in translation and publishing. His first celebrated literary works, Între viață și cărți ("Between Life and Books"), and Incertitudini literare ("Literary Uncertainties") were published in 1976 and 1980, respectively.

A new chapter in Steinhardt's life began in 1980, after being accepted to enter Rohia Monastery. He worked as the monastery's librarian, while at the same time dedicating himself to writing. During this time, his fame as a counsellor and father-confessor had grown, attracting dozens of visitors to Rohia every week.

He died at Baia Mare County Hospital. His funeral, under surveillance by the Securitate, was attended by many of his close friends and admirers.

In 2017, Steinhardt was posthumously elected a member of the Romanian Academy.

The Happiness Diary
The first manuscript of Jurnalul Fericirii ("The Happiness Diary") was confiscated by the Securitate in 1972, and restituted in 1975, after censorship intervention. Meanwhile, Steinhardt had finished writing a second version of the book, which was, in turn, confiscated in 1984. In the end, Steinhardt had written and edited several different versions, one of which had reached the expat writers and dissidents Monica Lovinescu and Virgil Ierunca in Paris. Lovinescu would later broadcast the book in a series of episodes through Radio Free Europe.
