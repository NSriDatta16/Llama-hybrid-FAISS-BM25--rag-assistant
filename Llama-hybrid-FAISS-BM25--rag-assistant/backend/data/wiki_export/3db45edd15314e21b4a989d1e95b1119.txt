Hong Kong cascade frog or Hong Kong torrent frog (Amolops hongkongensis) is a species of true frog from southern coastal China, once thought to be endemic to Hong Kong. Their eggs are laid on rock faces in the splash zones of cascades. In Hong Kong, it is a protected species under Wild Animals Protection Ordinance Cap 170.
