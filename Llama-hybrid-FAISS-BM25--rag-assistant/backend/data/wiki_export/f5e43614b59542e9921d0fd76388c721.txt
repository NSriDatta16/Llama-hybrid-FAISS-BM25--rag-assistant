For a small country, sport in the Isle of Man plays an important part in making the island known to the wider world. The principal international sporting event held on the island is the annual Isle of Man TT motorcycling event. However, the Isle of Man is represented internationally in a number of other sports at the Commonwealth Games and the Island Games.

International sport
The Isle of Man hosted the IV Commonwealth Youth Games in September 2011. The island started the Island Games in 1985 and hosted them once again in 2001. The most notable international event held on the Isle of Man is the Isle of Man TT motorcycle races, held annually in June. Rower Sidney Swann and cyclist Peter Kennaugh are the only islanders to have won Olympic Games gold medals, while polo player Frederick Agnew Gill won a bronze medal in 1900 and cyclist Mark Cavendish won a silver in 2016. In the Olympic Games, Manx athletes may compete in Team GB.

Cricket
The Isle of Man Cricket Association broke their affiliation with the Lancashire Cricket Board in 2004 to become affiliate members of the International Cricket Council and compete as a national team in their own right. The Isle of Man cricket team competed in their first official ICC competitions in 2005.

Cycling
The Manx Trophy cycling event is held annually. The Isle of Man boasts a very strong showing in the world of cycling, with several high-profile names and many talented up-and-coming young riders.

Manxman Mark Cavendish won two World Championships in the Madison, having won the event in Manchester at the 2008 UCI Track Cycling World Championships along with race partner Bradley Wiggins, and also with Rob Hayles at the Los Angeles World Championships in 2005. In 2006, he won a gold medal in the Scratch race on the track at the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne. After failing to win a medal in the Madison at the 2008 Olympic Games, Cavendish switched exclusively to road racing. He currently rides for . His sprinting abilities have made him one of the most prolific talents in British cycling, with 34 stage wins to date in the Tour de France between 2008 and 2016, and the green jersey in the 2011 Tour de France. In 2011, Cavendish, with the support of the British team, won the World Championship Road Race.

In 1970, Manxman Pete Buckley won a gold medal in the Men's Road Racing Championship at the Commonwealth Games in Christchurch. Just a couple of years later, his life and career were cut short when a dog ran into the road, causing Pete to crash and subsequently die from the resultant cerebral injuries.

Rugby union

There are five rugby union clubs in the island. The main domestic competition is the Dorchester Maritime Manx Cup; the secondary domestic competition is the Shimmin Wilson Manx Shield.

The current holders of the Manx Cup are Douglas Rugby Club and the Shield is held by Ramsey Rugby Club. The other island clubs are Castletown Rugby Club, Southern Nomads Rugby Club and Vagabonds Rugby Club.

Douglas, Vagabonds and Ramsey participate in the English leagues.

Motorcycle racing
The Isle of Man is famous for its TT motorbike racing event, which began in 1904 as a motorcar race. TT stands for Tourist Trophy. From 1905, the TT was held as a closed-roads motorcycle racing event and the original course was extended in the 1920s to use the current Snaefell Mountain Course. This is now a series of annual motorcycle road races over  held from late May to early June.

The 4.25-mile (6.84 km) Billown circuit near Castletown has been the scene of further events such as the Southern 100 in May, June and July since 1955.

Further racing takes place on the TT course each August–September in the form of the Manx Grand Prix (MGP). The idea of motor cycle racing for amateurs and private entrants on the famous TT course gave rise to the birth of the MGP back in 1921.

Linked to all this motor cycle racing are the Supporters Clubs, Riders Associations, the TT Marshals Association and the MGP Marshals Association.

Rallying
The Isle of Man hosts a number of rallying events including the Rally Isle of Man (formerly the Manx International Rally or Manx Trophy Rally) a round of the British Open Rally Championship. Also the Manx Rally (formerly the Manx National Rally), a round of the British National Rally Championship. Mark Higgins is a noted Manx rally driver, having won the Manx Rally a record five times, along with other events.

Association football is also popular, with the Isle of Man Football Association running a league of 27 clubs in two divisions, as well as a football combination for the reserve teams of the league clubs. There is also a national football team and Ellan Vannin team, although they do not participate in UEFA or FIFA tournaments. The Isle of Man Football Association has the status of a County Football Association within the English Football Association so is therefore represented by the England national football team.

In August 2019, it was announced that FC Isle of Man was investigating plans for a new club to be formed on the island which would join the English football league system. In December 2019, the club officially applied to join the North West Counties Football League, at Step 6 of the English non-league system. The league would then take the application to the Football Association with 'a recommendation that FC Isle of Man is accepted providing the appropriate criteria  met by 31 March 2020'.

The Isle of Man Gymnastics Association sends selected gymnasts from local clubs including Ellan Vannin and Manx Gym to events such as the Commonwealth Games, Island Games, Northern Europeans, and Celtic Cup, where the island competes with national representation. Island gymnasts also compete in England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales and further afield at both Championship, Challenge or Graded level. The sport has a very large growing young population, with larger Douglas clubs Manx Gym and Ellan Vannin, and smaller clubs Southern Gymnastics and Northern Gymnastics, drawing from the schools and the kindergartens.
