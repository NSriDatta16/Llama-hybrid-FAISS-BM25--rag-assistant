Space Cadet Solo Flight is the seventh studio album by the funk and disco group KC and the Sunshine Band. The album was produced by Harry Wayne Casey and Richard Finch and was released in 1981 on the TK label.

History
Space Cadet Solo Flight was credited only to group lead vocalist KC. Featuring more of a pop sound than the previous albums, it was not successful as the album and none of the singles released charted in the US. The album is notable for including a cover of the Supremes' 1966 hit song "You Keep Me Hangin' On".
