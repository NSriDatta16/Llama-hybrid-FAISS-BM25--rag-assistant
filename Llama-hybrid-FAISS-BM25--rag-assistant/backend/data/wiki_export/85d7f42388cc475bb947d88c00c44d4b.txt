The rise and fall in professional football 1954–1972 (1982)
In 1954 the club joined the ranks of professional football, after BVC Amsterdam had already stripped the club of all its players just prior (amongst others Hanny Tolmeijer). The players denounced their amateur club membership, and left without compensation to jump straight into professional football. considered very weak by the old supporters (known as the Foreign Legion, with members such as Frans van der Klink, Douwe Damsma, Nico Engelander, Anton Goedhart, Jan Dahrs, Wim van Biljouw, Erwin Sparendam). Playing in paid football the club were however not able to reach their previous form and relegated in 1960 to the Eerste Divisie.

Despite the club's illustrious amateur history, the professional football section of Blauw-Wit merged with the Volewijckers and DWS to form FC Amsterdam in 1972. Along with the shabby remnants of the BVC Amsterdam, which had already been merged with the paid section of DWS and in 1974 with the paid section of the Volewijckers. FC Amsterdam was dissolved in 1982.

Famous professional players of Blauw-Wit were Barry Hughes, Herman Rijkaard, Regillio Vrede, Wietze Couperus, Martin Koeman, Bennie Müller.

The introduction of professional football, and the founding of the BVC Amsterdam, put an end to a glorious history of three former top football clubs from Amsterdam. Ajax are the only club to survive the transition into paid football, with the fewest players leaving the club to join BVC Amsterdam, which was in part because the Ajax-players were already paid compensation from the club, even before the introduction of paid football in the Netherlands.
