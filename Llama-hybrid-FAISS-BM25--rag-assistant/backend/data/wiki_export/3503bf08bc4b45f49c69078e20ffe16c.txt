Art Pepper + Eleven – Modern Jazz Classics is a 1960 jazz album by saxophonist Art Pepper and a small big band performing arrangements by Marty Paich, who also directed the ensemble.

Background 
The recording is one of several dates Pepper made with Paich in 1959 and is the only one with Pepper as leader. The recording focuses on Paich's large group arrangements of modern jazz classics, including Denzil Best's "Move," Thelonious Monk's "'Round Midnight," Gerry Mulligan's "Walkin' Shoes". Other highlights of the recording are Pepper's clarinet performances on "Anthropology" and the alternate takes of "Walkin'."
