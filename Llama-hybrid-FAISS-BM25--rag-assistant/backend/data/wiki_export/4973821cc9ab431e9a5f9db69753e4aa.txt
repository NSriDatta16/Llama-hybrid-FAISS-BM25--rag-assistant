History
Basco Airport was first built in 1930 as Batan Airfield. During the Second World War, it became a target of Japanese forces during their invasion of the Philippines, seizing it along with the whole island on the first day of the Pacific War on 8 December 1941. Subsequently, the airfield was bombed by American planes in the closing months of the war in 1945, but the Japanese managed to hold on to it until their official surrender.
