PFFR is a Brooklyn-based production company and art collective consisting of Vernon Chatman, John Lee, Alyson Levy and formerly Jim Tozzi until 2009. The group has been active since 1998.

Work
The group's portfolio of work includes two albums, one 7-inch EP and one download-only EP (plus a string of live performances as a band), various art exhibits such as An Attack On All Americans or the Tyranny Of Weed shown at the LFL Gallery in New York and the script for the film Final Flesh. In 2010, they held an exhibition/video screening of a selection of their work entitled PFFR Presents Legacy IIX which took place at the Synchronicity Space in Los Angeles, CA between April 3 and May 1.

PFFR are also active in television comedy. They wrote, directed, produced and starred in the MTV2 variety show Wonder Showzen (2005–2006) and the Adult Swim CGI series Xavier: Renegade Angel. For both these shows, Chatman and Lee are the directors and main voice talent, whilst Tozzi and Levy are the animation/character designer and art director, respectively. Levy provides additional voices for both shows whilst Tozzi does only for 'Xavier'. PFFR are also responsible for producing, directing and co-writing Jon Glaser's Adult Swim show Delocated.

Chatman and Lee collaborated on Doggy Fizzle Televizzle, a short lived sketch show starring Snoop Dogg, although this was not an official PFFR production. Following this show, Snoop Dogg made a guest appearance on PFFR's 'United We Doth' LP as well as a second-season episode of Xavier: Renegade Angel.

In 2015, PFFR produced and directed the music video for Animal Collective's song FloriDada, the first single off of their album Painting With.

They also produced the 2008 Adult Swim pilot Neon Knome, which would later be worked as The Problem Solverz on Cartoon Network in 2011.
