"Temperature" is the third worldwide and the second US single from Jamaican musician Sean Paul's third studio album, The Trinity (2005). The song uses the dancehall riddim "Applause". Officially, there are two versions of the song, which only differ in their rhythm. The track was produced by Rohan "Snowcone" Fuller and received a positive reception from music critics. Released as the second US single in December 2005, the song reached  1 on the Billboard Hot 100 the following year to become Paul's third US No. 1 single. The single also reached the top 10 in Canada and France and the top 20 in Australia and the United Kingdom.

"Temperature" became Sean Paul's biggest hit single in the US. Even though it only spent one week at No. 1, "Temperature" showed extreme longevity on the Billboard Hot 100, spending 17 weeks in the top 10. Until Nelly Furtado and Timbaland's "Promiscuous", this was the longest run in the top 10 for a single in 2006.

Music video

The official music video was directed by Little X, in the video, Sean Paul is seen rapping with female backup dancers. The first dance sequence was with blowing leaves, centered in autumn. Then as weather gets cooler, Paul is in the snow while the thermometer freezing, centered in winter. The third sequence is in the rain, centered on spring. Finally, Paul at a tanning salon squirting sunscreen, centered on summer. There is evident sexual innuendo in the squirting of the lotion from the sunscreen bottles. At the end, Paul raps and is in a club while performing to the song "Breakout".
