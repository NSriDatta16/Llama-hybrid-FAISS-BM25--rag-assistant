The Greece national rugby union team represents one of the world's newest rugby union playing nations. The national team is governed by the HRF (Hellenic Rugby Federation).
Greece has been participating in international competitions since October 2005 playing its first international game against Austria in Vienna. 
Since then, they have played several international games in FIRA competition 3D, and in Greece. Greece played Slovakia in the Final on 12 May 2007 in Thessaloniki, where they won 20–17 and in doing so gained promotion to division 3C.

History
It is unknown when rugby was first played in Greece. During the mid 19th century, English and French sailors are recorded as playing some of the earliest games in northern Greece.
