History

Native American settlement 

Over 10,000 years ago, the area now known as Pine Brook was settled by Lenape tribes as part of the Lenapehoking. The Lenape tribes maintained peace and no significant battles were recorded in the area today known as Montville Township.

Dutch and English settlement 
In the 1710s, Dutch farmers from New Amsterdam settled in Pine Brook. A farming community, Pine Brook produced dairy products in addition to fruits and vegetables, and for many years there existed a large business in cider making and distilling of cider brandy in nearby Cider Mills.

In 1760, Pine Brook was the site of the first schoolhouse in Montville Township. It was built out of logs and was located on the road leading to Boonton, according to A History of Morris County, which could refer to multiple northwest-facing roads including Changebridge Road.

With its close proximity to Morristown during the American Revolutionary War, both British and American forces traveled through the area.

American history 
Additional Pine Brook schools were constructed in 1785, 1816, and 1852.

In 1809, the Parsippany and Roadway Turnpike Company constructed the road that begins at Pine Brook that "ran up through the Boudinot Meadows, Troy, Parsippany, Denville, Rockaway, across the mountain to Mount Pleasant, there joining the Union Turnpike." This possibly refers to the western terminus of today's "Bloomfield Avenue" where it becomes U.S. Route 46, connecting the port city of Newark with the farms, foundries, and mines of West New Jersey.

On April 11, 1867, the New Jersey Legislature formally united and chartered the three sections of White Hall, Montville, and Pine Brook into present day Montville Township from territory set off from Pequannock Township.

Way Station  - "From the description of property in old deeds, it appears that between 1800 and 1810 an attempt was made to name the cluster of three or four houses at Pine Brook, where George D. Mead keeps a store, "Union Village", but as a village failed to grow up, the name was dropped and has been forgotten. At this point, a tavern was kept over eighty years and for many years it did a legitimate and profitable business in the accommodations of "Sussex Teams", as they were called, which in large numbers used to pass this way toward Newark with loads of flour, feed, grain, butter, pork, and other produce from Sussex, Warren, and the upper parts of Morris county."  (Hon. John Kanouse - 1881)

The Pine Brook Speedway, which operated from July 1962 until October 1989, was designed for midget car racing and became one of the earliest sites for microstock racing. Mario Andretti raced at the track and had some of his earliest success as a race car driver at the speedway.
