A 6'2" guard from Virginia Tech, Combs was nicknamed "The Kentucky Rifle" for his long-range shooting.

Combs was a member of the Dallas/Texas Chaparrals, the Utah Stars, the Memphis Tams, and the Virginia Squires, and he appeared in three league All-star games (1970, 1971, 1972).  The Utah Stars won an ABA Championship in 1971 when Combs was as a member of the team.  He led the league in three-point baskets made (103) in 1971–72.  When he retired in 1975, he had scored 7,666 career points.

Combs played college basketball at Virginia Tech.  As a junior, he led the 1966–67 team to the Elite Eight, with a scoring average of 21.3 points per game. As of 2019 he  holds the school record for points in an NCAA tournament game when he put up 29 in the Sweet 16 game against Indiana.
