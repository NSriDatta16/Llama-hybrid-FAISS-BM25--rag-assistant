Oriental Brewery or OB () is a South Korean brewery currently owned by AB InBev, and initially founded by Doosan Group.

History 
In 1933, Showa Kirin Brewery (Kirin Company) established Oriental Brewery. Oriental Brewery was privatized in 1952. Established by the Doosan Group in 1952, it was purchased by InBev in 1998. In July 2009, it was sold by Anheuser-Busch InBev as the parent company sought to reduce its debt. It was sold to an affiliate of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.. Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB Inbev) has retained the right to purchase OB five years from its sale, at predetermined financial terms. In April 2014, AB Inbev executed its right to repurchase OB. OB became a subsidiary of AB Inbev again. Today OB produces several of Korea's most popular beverages including the OB, Cass and Cafri lager brands. All OB beers are brewed from rice, rather than the malted barley familiar to Western beer drinkers. In March 2001, the company merged Cass Beer (State) with the production capacity of 1,120,000 KLE per year, and produced red rock, OBE, KaprI, Budweiser, etc. In July 2002, it was the first beer industry to obtain the ISO 9001 certification from the Korea Standards Association.

It became a foreign company when it was taken over by Dutch beer company Molte Industries in September 2010 and became a subsidiary of Belgian beer company AB InBev in April 2014.

Brands

OB Golden Lager
The 4th top selling beer in Korea. OB Lager is a pale, 4.4% A.B.V. pale lager available in cans and bottles, and served on draft in Korea. Originally brewed in 1948; the name was changed from OB Lager simply to OB in 2003; the recipe was altered to include rice. The name changed to OB Blue in June 2006 with another slight recipe tweak.

Cass Fresh Cold Brewed
A pale-golden pale lager with a 4.5% ABV. Originally brewed by the Cass Brewery, the brand had been taken over by Jinro-Coors, one of the country's leading brewers. After having around 70% of the Korean lager market in the 1980s, by 1994 Cass had fallen behind Hite as Korea's top selling lager. Oriental Brewery bought the Cass brand from Jinro-Coors in 1999 and built it up again, with OB declaring a 51% market share in 2000. In 2007, the higher alcohol Cass Red was introduced. In 2011 Cass Lager became South Korea's number one selling brand, overtaking Hite.

The beer became notable after an endorsement by British celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay who described it as "not pretentious", "easy" and "fresh"; citing it as his preferred beverage with Korean dishes since acquiring a taste for the cuisine 15 years ago. His appearance in several of the beer's adverts caused much derision from viewers who found Ramsay's preference for the beer — which was considered to be poor in quality — offending despite his status as a chef very scrutinizing of his food palate.

Non-alcoholic look-alikes of Cass can be found with brand names such as "Cars" and "Cdss". Some noraebang (singing rooms) establishments have been known to try to pass off these imitations as the real thing, as Korean law prohibits  marked as such from selling alcoholic drinks within its premises ( establishments are allowed to sell alcohol).

Introduced in 1876 by Carl Conrad & Co. of St. Louis, Missouri, it has grown to become one of the highest selling beers in the United States, and is available in over 80 markets worldwide—though, due to a trademark dispute, does not necessarily do so under the Budweiser name.

Bud Ice
Introduced in 1994 as "Ice by Budweiser", it has more alcohol (5.5% ABV) than Budweiser. It is best known for an advertising campaign that involved a malevolent penguin that stalked Bud Ice drinkers and stole their beer, announcing its presence by singing the "doo-be-doo-be-doo" phrase from "Strangers in the Night".

Corona
Corona Extra is a pale lager produced by Cervecería Modelo in Mexico for domestic distribution and export to all other countries besides the United States, and by Constellation Brands in Mexico for export to the United States. The split ownership is a result of an anti-trust settlement permitting the merger of Grupo Modelo with AB InBev.

The Corona brand is one of the top-selling beers worldwide. Outside Mexico, Corona is commonly served with a wedge of lime or lemon in the neck of the bottle to add tartness and flavor.

In the United States, Corona Extra is the top selling imported beer.
