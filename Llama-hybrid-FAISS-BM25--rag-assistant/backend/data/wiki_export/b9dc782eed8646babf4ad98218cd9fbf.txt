Eugene Moore Jr. (August 26, 1909 – March 12, 1978) was an American professional baseball right fielder. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Cincinnati Reds, St. Louis Cardinals, Boston Bees / Braves, Brooklyn Dodgers, Washington Senators, and St. Louis Browns between 1931 and 1945. His father, Gene Sr., was a pitcher for the Pirates and Reds between 1910 and 1912.

Career
In a 14-season career, Moore posted a .270 batting average with 58 home runs and 436 RBI in 1042 games played.

Best season
In , Moore played in 151 games for the Boston Bees, batting .290, with 185 hits, 38 doubles, 12 triples, and 91 runs scored – all career-highs. On May 1, facing Pittsburgh's Waite Hoyt, Moore made Forbes Field history, becoming the first left-handed batter to launch a home run over that stadium's distant left-field wall, as well as the first to clear its then eleven-year-old, 24-foot-high scoreboard. (Scarcely one year later, he would become the first and only player to perform this feat twice.)
