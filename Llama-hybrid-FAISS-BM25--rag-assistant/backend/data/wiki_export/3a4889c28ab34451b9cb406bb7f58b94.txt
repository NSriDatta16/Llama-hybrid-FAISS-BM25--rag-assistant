Iran's annual Fajr International Film Festival (), or Fajr Film Festival (little: FIFF; ), has been held every February and April in Tehran since 1982. The festival is supervised by the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance. It takes place on the anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The awards are the Iranian equivalent to the American Academy Awards.

The festival has been promoted locally and internationally through television, radio and webinars; speakers have come from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany. 

Organizations contributing to the event have included the Farabi Cinema Foundation, Iran film foundation, Press TV, HispanTV and Iran's multi-lingual film channel IFilm. From 2015, the festival has been separated into a national festival in February, which is notable for premieres of the most important domestic movies, and an international one, held in April.

Visitors 

Over the years the Festival has had numerous film figures attend, some of whom have worked closely with the festival as jury members. These include: Volker Schlondorff, Krzysztof Zanussi, Robert Chartoff, Semih Kaplanoglu, Bruce Beresford, Percy Adlon, Paul Cox, Shyam Benegal, Bela Tarr, Jan Troell, Helma Sanders-Brahms, Elia Suleiman, Agnieszka Holland, Andrey Zvyagintsev, Rustam Ibragimbekov and Costa-Gavras.

Boycotts 
Two Italian film directors, Eugenio Barba and Romeo Castellucci, have announced that they will not be attending the 2020 Fajr Festival in Tehran. They made this decision at the request of some Iranian artists who have already boycotted the festival. So far, 139 people, including director Masoud Kimiai and various movie stars are boycotting the festival in a show of sympathy for the families of those killed in the January 2020 Iranian downing of a Ukrainian passenger flight.
