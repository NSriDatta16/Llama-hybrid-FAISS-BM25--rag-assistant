The Episcopal Diocese of Upper South Carolina (EDUSC) is a diocese in the Episcopal Church.

Originally part of the Diocese of South Carolina, it became independent on October 10â€“11, 1922 following nearly two years of planning. The see city is Columbia. Its cathedral is Trinity Cathedral. The diocese comprises approximately 60 congregations in the Upstate (northwestern) and Midlands regions of the U.S. state of South Carolina. There are five convocations in the diocese: Midlands (Columbia area), Catawba (Rock Hill area), Foothills (Greenville area), Gravatt (Aiken area), and Piedmont (Spartanburg areas).

The bishop is Daniel P. Richards. He was elected bishop on September 25 2021 and was consecrated at Trinity Cathedral as bishop on February 26 2022.

Among the Diocese's many institutions, the Bishop Gravatt Center began service in 1949 as a retreat and summer camp site. Now a non-profit corporation with its own Board of Trustees, the Center remains a vital part of the Diocese through its summer camp Christian formation program and numerous diocesan and parish activities such as Happening, Cursillo, youth retreats, vestry retreats, parish family weekends, etc.
