Slugs, also referred to as Slugs: The Movie (Spanish: Slugs, Muerte Viscosa, lit. "Slugs, Slimy Death") is a 1988 English-language Spanish natural horror film directed by Juan Piquer Simon, and co-written by Simon with Ron Gantman. Based on the 1982 novel of the same name by Shaun Hutson, it tells the story of a small town whose locals are terrorised by aggressive carnivorous slugs.

Plot 
In the fictional small town of Ashton, an alcoholic named Ron Bell is eaten alive late one night by a large swarm of slugs in his living room. The next morning, health inspector Mike Brady and Sheriff Reese head to Ron's home, preparing to deliver an eviction notice, only to discover his near-skinless body. Exploring the house, Mike finds mutilple trails of slime leading from the basement, but he and Reese are unable to determine the exact creature responsible for the murder.

Later that afternoon, local gardener Harold Morris puts on a gardening glove which, unbeknownst to him, contains some of the slugs, which start eating his hand. In the ensuing chaos, Harold accidentally knocks over some of his jars of chemicals, causing a fire which ignites a tank of gasoline, resulting in an explosion that kills him and his wife Jean. Mike, upon returning home, is informed of the deaths by his wife Kim, a high school teacher, when they both discover a group of abnormally large and aggressive slugs in their garden. Mike gathers some of the slugs in a jar and leaves them with the school's science teacher John Foley for investigation. During his investigations, Foley witnesses one of the slugs attack and eat the class hamster, as, elsewhere in town, the slugs attack and eat two teenagers, and Mike's friend David unknowingly eats part of a slug that was hidden in a salad made by his wife. 

Mike and Reese are brought in to investigate the deaths of the teenagers the next morning, where Mike postulates that the killings are a result of mutant slugs, only to be disregarded as crazy. Later, Mike is called over by Don, who has discovered that the locations of the murders line up with the layout of the town's sewer system, and theorises that the slug's aggressiveness may be a result of chemical leakage from a long-abandoned toxic waste dump that exists near to Bell's home.

Meanwhile, whilst dining at a restaurant, an unwell David begins profusely bleeding from his nose and collapses, before multiple blood flukes abruptly burst from his eye sockets. Having learned of the death and witnessed slugs crawling through the sink in his home, Mike approaches the town mayor, begging him to cut off the downtown water supply so that the slugs can be dealt with, but is once again dismissed as crazy, causing him to leave in frustration. Later, at the school lab, Foley shows Mike a lithium-based arsenic that Mike hopes to use to kill the slugs in the sewers, which he has discovered are the slugs's place of origin. Mike convinces Don to join him in helping getting rid of the slugs, as Foley creates a large batch of the arsenic. That night, Mike and Don enter the sewer system and locate the slugs's breeding ground, but Don is killed after he falls in and is eaten alive. Mike then climbs out of a nearby manhole and gets Foley to pump in the arsenic from a firetruck hose into the sewer, causing an explosive reaction that successfully kills all the slugs, despite causing serious damage to the rest of the town in the process. Mike reunites with Kim as the emergency services arrive, whilst unbeknownst to rest of the town, a singular live slug writhes ominously on a vent cover.
