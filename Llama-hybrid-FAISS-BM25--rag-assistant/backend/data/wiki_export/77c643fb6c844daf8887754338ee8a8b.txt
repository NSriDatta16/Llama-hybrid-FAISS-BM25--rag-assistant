Doctor of Medicine program

The Doctor of Medicine program was founded in 1970. It is one of two fully accredited medical schools in Canada that offers a three-year Doctor of Medicine program. The program is structured so that the pre-clerkship curriculum is taught year-round, without an extended summer break (as is common in 4-year MD programs). This structure allows the pre-clerkship portion of undergraduate medical education to be shortened in length, without limiting the breadth of medical knowledge required for students to be competent before entering the clerkship phase of the curriculum.
