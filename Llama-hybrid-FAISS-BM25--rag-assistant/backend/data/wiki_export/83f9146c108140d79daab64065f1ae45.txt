History

European settlement of Culcairn began in 1834, following favorable reports on grazing potential and grass cover by the explorers Hume and Hovell when traveling overland to the Port Phillip district in 1824. A number of stations were gazetted and  between 1862 and 1865 the district was terrorized by the bushranger, Dan "Mad Dog" Morgan. The reward for Morgan would reach £1,000. He was ambushed and killed in Victoria after his final holdup in 1865.

The town itself was laid out in 1880 by James Balfour, a local landowner, who named it after a property in the parish of Kiltearn, his mother's birthplace.  Culcairn Post Office opened on 1 September 1880.

Early industries included chaff mills, a cereal grain company and a quarry.  The extension of the Main Southern railway line to Albury to meet the broad gauge line from Melbourne saw Culcairn prosper.  The Culcairn Hotel, constructed in 1891, was the largest on the line between Melbourne and Sydney.
