Deepak Kumar was a professor of History of Science and Education, at Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India. Kumar lectured at numerous universities within India and abroad, held visiting fellowships at the universities of Cambridge, London, Leiden, The Smithsonian Institution, etc. and has also taught at Wisconsin University, Madison, USA, and York University in Toronto, Canada.

Kumar argues that British colonial rule in India played a major role in how European scientific fields developed. One of his major works is Science and the Raj: A study of British India is in the field of history of science in India.

A 2017 work is The Trishanku Nation reviewed in Sage Publications 

In describing medical encounters in colonial India, Kumar argues that Western medical discourse occupied an important place in the process of colonization and it worked towards a scientific hegemony. "Indigenous systems were so marginalised that their practitioners often sought survival in resistance rather than collaboration." 

A number of his publications are cataloged at WorldCat: These include, as of August 2021, publications in English (983), German (6), Arabic (2), and Hindi (2).
