History
It was announced in June 2006 that former Clear Channel Communications regional VP John Gehron would act as general manager for Harpo Radio, Inc. On July 20, Laurie Cantillo was appointed program director of Harpo Radio. Cantillo had program director experience at stations including KFYI, KTAR, and KGME. A week later, more staff was hired for the channel, including Corny Koehl (director of development), John St. Augustine, Katherine Kelly, Scott Miller, and Rita Coburn Whack (producers).

In September 2007, Oprah and Friends was added to the DirecTV lineup on channel 807.  Following the Sirius/XM merger, Oprah & Friends was added to Sirius on September 30, 2008, as part of its "Best of XM" package, and broadcast on channel 195 (it moved to channel 204 on May 4, 2011).  On November 12, 2008, Oprah and Friends was removed from the DirecTV lineup.

In November 2008, John Gehron and Laurie Cantillo exited their positions at Oprah & Friends.  Corny Koehl was named Executive Producer of the channel in charge of the creative side, and Katherine Kelly was named Operations Manager handling the day-to-day workings of the channel.

On March 4, 2009, Oprah and Friends was renamed and rebranded as Oprah Radio. Listeners tuned in on January 1, 2015, to an announcement explaining that the channel had ceased broadcasts on SiriusXM.
