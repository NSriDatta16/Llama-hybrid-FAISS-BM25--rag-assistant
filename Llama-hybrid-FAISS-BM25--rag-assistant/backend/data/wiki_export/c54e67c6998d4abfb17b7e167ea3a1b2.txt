Corinda is a suburb in the City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. In the , Corinda had a population of 5,064 people.

History
The suburb takes its name from the Corinda railway station, which in turn was likely named after a local cattle station owned by Sir Arthur Palmer, which he named after his Corinda pastoral station near Aramac.

Corinda was first settled in the 1860s as a small farming community.  Among the original settlers was the Francis family who in 1862 purchased 21 acres, which extended from the Brisbane River to Francis Lookout, a local heritage listed landmark on Dewar Terrace.  Francis Lookout survives to this day, and includes a small burial ground opened in 1862. Its ten graves include those of some of the pioneer settlers.  The oldest of the graves is of Clement Francis who died in 1863. The lychgate, erected by Angela Francis, dates to 1902. Most of the original older-style Queenslander homes date back to the colonial period and were built high on the hills around the lookout.

The first rail line opened in 1874. A small commercial district on Oxley Road gradually grew around it.  The Corinda School of Arts (now municipal library) is one of the earliest surviving buildings on this strip and is a small timber structure built in 1895. The commercial district rapidly developed after the 1920s.  Many large bungalow styled homes were built on the floodplain toward Oxley Creek during this time.

In October 1883, 140 subdivided allotments of 'Sherwood Junction Estate' were auctioned by J. Cameron. A map advertising the auction shows the Estate was at the junction of the South Brisbane Railway Line.

In 1879, the local government area of Yeerongpilly Division was created. In 1891, parts of Yeerongpilly Division were excised to create Sherwood Division becoming a Shire in 1903 which contained the suburb of Corinda. In 1925, the Shire of Sherwood was amalgamated into the City of Brisbane.

In June 1889, 145 allotments were available for sale in the Oxley Station Terraces Estate by T. A. Lawson, Auctioneers.

In 1915, seeing a need for more Catholic schools, Roman Catholic Archbishop of Brisbane, James Duhig, invited a number of orders of teaching Sisters to come to Brisbane. One of those orders was the Daughters of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart who came to Brisbane and established St Joseph's Catholic Primary School, which opened on 28 January 1917 with 50 students. The school was operated by the Sisters until 1993, when a lay principal was appointed.

In July 1920, 32 subdivided allotments of the Corinda Park Estate were auctioned by Cameron Bros. A map advertising the auction states the Estate was 10 minutes walk from both Corinda and Oxley railway stations. The Open View Estate advertised 32 allotments in May 1923. 

Corinda State School opened on 1 June 1927.

St Aidan's Anglican Girls' School opened on 5 February 1929.

On 3 December 1933, the Montrose Home for Crippled opened in Swann Road,  Taringa in Montrose, the home of Presbyterian philanthropist George Marchant which he donated for the purpose. When the home needed larger premies, in 1937, Marchant purchased Ardeyne, a  site in Corinda for the long-term operation of the home under the management of the Queensland Society for Crippled Children. The home closed in 2001 as the organisation transitioned away from institutional care towards community and in-home support services. The home had its own school. The Montrose Home School for Crippled Children opened in January 1934. In March 1934 it was renamed Montrose Special School. The school closed on 2 June 2006. The home and school were at 54 Consort Street in Corinda ().

Our Lady of the Sacred Heart College opened in January 1941 and closed in December 1972.

Corinda State High School opened on 25 January 1960.

The Corinda RSL was established in 1964 and now trades as the Sherwood Services Club. With the opening of Coles Supermarkets, the commercial centre has continued to develop and extend westward.

The Corinda Library became a branch of the Brisbane City Council library in 1966 and had a major refurbishment in 2016.

The suburb experienced a landslip during the 1974 Brisbane flood which affected more than 20 houses.
