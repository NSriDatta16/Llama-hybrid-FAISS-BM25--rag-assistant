Samnaun () is a high Alpine village and a valley at the eastern end of Switzerland and a municipality in the Engiadina Bassa/Val M端stair Region in the Swiss canton of Graub端nden.

History
The valley was first used as a seasonal mountain pasture for the villages of Tschlin and Ramosch.  By 1220 the first permanent farm houses are mentioned.  These farm houses and fields were given as a gift to the Marienberg Abbey by the counts of Tarasp in the 12th century.

In the 19th century, Samnaun could only be reached by road from Spiss in Austria. Thus Samnaun was excluded from the Swiss Customs Area. It retains a privileged 'duty-free' status, albeit not without controversy, in the twenty-first century. The exception was maintained even after a road was built in 1905 linking Samnaun to Martina, at the most eastern point of the Lower Engadine. In winters with exceptionally heavy snowfall that blocks the road, Samnaun at times can only be reached via Austria.
