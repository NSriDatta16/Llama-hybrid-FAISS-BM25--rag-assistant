The National Ice Hockey League () is the top men's ice hockey league in Spain. Its governing body is the Royal Spanish Ice Sports Federation.

History
Liga Nacional de Hockey Hielo was established in 1972 as the Superliga Española de Hockey Hielo. There were six founding teams which participated in the first season, 1972–73: Real Sociedad, CH Jaca, CH Valladolid, CG Puigcerdà, CH Madrid and CF Barcelona.

In 2011, the league was composed of eight teams, but due to financial problems in almost all clubs, the league has reduced the number of participants year after year until only five of them were left. In the season 2021/2022 in order to grow ice hockey in Spain, two teams composed of non-Spanish people, and one composed of Spanish players, joined the league, bringing the number of teams back to eight, with the door open to new ones in the future.
