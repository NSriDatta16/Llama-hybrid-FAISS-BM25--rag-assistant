Brooks is thought to have been derived from both the Swedish surname Bäckland, (bäck, "brook", "stream") and lund ("grove"); and in English, Gaelic and Scottish from "of the brook". The word brook derives from the Old English broc and appears in the Medieval predecessors of Brooks (Ate-Broc and Atte-Broc). The surname arrived in North America from England in the mid-seventeenth century.

The surname Brooks is recorded in Ireland from the 1600s. O'Laughlin reports that "some of the name could stem from Irish origins, the name being changed into the English word 'Brook' or Brooks." The surname is also found among English-speaking Ashkenazi Jews, deriving from the male Hebrew given name Boruch ("blessed").
