The MA is a straight-4 SOHC 0.9 L, 1.0 L, or 1.2 L engine first introduced in 1982 by Nissan, intended primarily for the K10 series Micra/March model. It shares design similarities with the older E engine, with an 8-valve hemispherical cylinder head but differs in that it uses an aluminium cylinder block. Unusually, the specified ignition timing for the MA10 running on the specified 90 RON gasoline was 2 degrees after top dead centre, reflecting a very high flame speed in the compact combustion chambers.

MA09ERT
The MA09ERT is a series-charged design (possessing both a turbocharger and a supercharger), an unusual design, particularly for Japanese vehicles. It powered the March Superturbo, March R, and the March Superturbo R.

The "Nissan PLASMA" (Powerful & Economic, Light, Accurate, Silent, Mighty, Advanced) improved performance and response by adding a supercharger to the (already turbocharged) MA10ET engine, which is a four-cylinder water-cooled OHC engine with a V-type valve arrangement and hemispherical combustion chambers, with sequential fuel injection.

The supercharger improved the response and the output in the low-rpm region (where turbochargers are typically less effective), and a new larger HT10 turbocharger aimed to improve output in the high-rpm regions. An intercooler and an updated intake manifold were added, the latter having a much larger throttle body and improved fuel rail. The result was an increase in output to  from , and a much broader range of torque. Other changes included a reduction of engine capacity from 987 cc to 930 cc; this strengthened the engine by increasing the bore wall thicknesses by 1 mm, and allowed cars using it to enter sub-1300 cc competition classes not otherwise possible due to conversion factors applied to forced induction engines.

The first prototypes of these engines were installed in the March Superturbo R/March R (EK10FR type) in 1988; shortly thereafter the engine was installed in the March Superturbo.

The MA09ERT was the first twincharged engine available in Japan; series charging combines the increased low-speed torque of supercharging with the increased high-speed torque and power of turbocharging. The presence of the supercharger also minimizes the effects of turbo lag.

MA10S

The MA10S is an engine with an electronically controlled carburetor. It was used in the Be-1 and 1982–1992 Micra (K10) and Pao. It has a hemi-head and, unusually, the spark is fired after top dead centre because of the very high flame speed in a compact engine with this head design. Compression in the  version was relatively low so that it was able to run on 90 RON petrol where available.
