The School of Medicine is the medical school of the University of Leeds, in the city of Leeds, West Yorkshire, England. The School of Medicine was founded in 1831.

The School of Medicine now forms part of the University's Faculty of Medicine and Health. The School is composed of institutes located at multiple sites in West Yorkshire including the Worsley Building, LIGHT, St James's Campus, and Chapel Allerton Hospital. The School of Medicine is primarily linked with two major hospitals for clinical teaching: the Leeds General Infirmary and St James's University Hospital, both run by the Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, alongside smaller district NHS Trusts.

History 
On 6 June 1831 six physicians and surgeons set up the Leeds Medical School with the aim: 
The Medical School admitted its first students in October of that year. It was one of ten provincial medical schools founded in the ten years between 1824 and 1834.

The founders were:
Dr James Williamson
Dr Adam Hunter
Mr Samuel Smith
Mr William Hey III
Mr Thomas Pridgin Teale
Dr Joseph Prince Garlick

The first premises were the Leeds Public Dispensary on North Street in the town but in 1834 the school was moved to new premises at 1 East Parade. In the 1940s, the "Leeds Public Dispensary and Hospital" is recorded as  sponsoring pharmaceutical research undertaken by  the University of Leeds.  The Medical School's current premises, the Worsley Building, was designed by the Building Design Partnership and officially opened by the Duke of Kent in March 1979.

Teaching 
The medical training in Leeds lasts five years. An optional intercalated degree can be taken either at Leeds or another institution, making the course six years.  The MBChB degree is divided into three phases. Phase I (Preparing for Clinical Practice) encompasses Years One to Three, Phase II (Clinical Practice in Context) encompasses Year Four and Phase III (Becoming a Doctor) encompasses Year Five and Foundation Year One. Leeds was ranked 19th in the Guardian medicine league table 2017 and 3rd for student experience in the Times Higher Education Student Experience Survey 2018.
