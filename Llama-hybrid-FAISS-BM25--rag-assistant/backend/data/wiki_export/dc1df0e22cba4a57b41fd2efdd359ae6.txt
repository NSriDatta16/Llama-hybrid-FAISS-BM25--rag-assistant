John Middleton, 1st Earl of Middleton ( – 3 July 1674) was a professional soldier and mercenary from Kincardineshire in Scotland. Beginning his career in the Thirty Years War, during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms he fought for the Covenanters and Parliamentarians until 1648, when he switched sides to the Royalists.

One of his colleagues in the 1639 to 1640 Bishops' Wars was Montrose, who later became a Royalist. Despite their similar backgrounds and views, Middleton pursued him with considerable vigour, reportedly because his father died when Montrose's men set fire to his house.

Middleton supported the Royalists in the Second and Third English Civil Wars and took part in the unsuccessful 1654 Glencairn's rising. Rewarded by being appointed Lord High Commissioner to the Parliament of Scotland after the 1660 Stuart Restoration, he fell out with his political colleagues and was removed from office in 1663.

However, viewed by Charles II as a capable and reliable soldier, he was compensated with two key strategic commands, first Rochester Castle, then English Tangier where he died in July 1674.

Personal details

Born around 1608, John was the eldest son of Robert Middleton of Caldhame and his wife Catherine Strachan; his younger brother Alexander and nephew George both served as Principal of King's College, Aberdeen great uncle of George's son John Middleton; and great-great uncle of Charles Middleton, 1st Baron Barham.

Military career
In early life Middleton served as a soldier in France; later he fought against Charles I both in England and in Scotland, being especially prominent at the Battle of Philiphaugh and in other operations against James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose.

Middleton held a high command in the Engager army which took part in the Second English Civil War and was taken prisoner at the Battle of Preston in August 1648. He joined Charles II when he arrived in Scotland in 1650 to be crowned, but fell out with the ruling Kirk Party and was compelled to do public penance at Dundee. He commanded the Royalist cavalry at the Battle of Worcester in August 1651 and was captured before escaping to Paris.

In 1653, Middleton was chosen to lead a projected Scottish rising; he reached Scotland in February 1654, but the participants were deeply divided and the revolt ended in defeat at the Battle of Dalnaspidal in July. He remained in Scotland until 1655 when he rejoined the exiled court and was created Earl of Middleton in 1656, with the subsidiary title of Lord Clermont and Fettercairn. He was made colonel of a Scottish infantry regiment in the Royalist Army in Exile, although actual command was exercised by Lord Newburgh.

Political career
Following the Stuart Restoration in May 1660, Middleton was appointed commander-in-chief of the troops in Scotland and Lord High Commissioner to the Parliament of Scotland, which he opened in January 1661. His extreme Royalism led to a political struggle with the Earl of Lauderdale and in 1663 he was deprived of his offices. He then served as Lieutenant-General of the Kent militia and Governor of Rochester Castle from 1663 until 1668, before being appointed governor of English Tangier in 1670, acquired when Charles married Catherine of Braganza. He died there on 3 July 1674 of injuries sustained by falling down the stairs after a drinking bout.
