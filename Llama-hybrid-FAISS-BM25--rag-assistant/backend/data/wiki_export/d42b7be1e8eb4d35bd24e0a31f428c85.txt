The Scottish League Championship (Formerly Scottish Premiership Division Three) is the third tier of Scotland's national rugby union league system, and therefore part of the Scottish League Championship.

Between 1973 and 2012 the league was the lowest division in the Scottish Premiership and as such was a nationwide league with the best teams being promoted to Scottish Premiership Division Two and the bottom teams relegated to Scottish National League Division One.

Beginning in the 2012â€“13 season the SRU have regionalised the third tier of the Scottish League Championship, replacing the 12 team nationwide league with two 10 team 'East' and 'West' Championships.
