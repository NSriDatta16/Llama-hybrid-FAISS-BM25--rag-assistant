Appetite for Extinction is an album by Some Velvet Sidewalk. It was released in 1990.

Critical reception
Trouser Press wrote that "between the epic grind of 'Snow' and the too-brief pop discourse of '20,000 Leagues', Some Velvet Sidewalk covers all of nerd-popâ€™s bases, getting thrown out only when they unplug on the insufferably twee 'Crayons'."
