The  (also romanized  or ) were a group of Japanese mendicant monks of the Fuke school of Zen Buddhism who flourished during the Edo period (1603–1867).  were characterized by a straw basket (a sedge or reed hood known as a ) worn on the head, manifesting the absence of specific ego but also useful for traveling incognito. They were also known for playing solo pieces on the  (a type of bamboo flute). These pieces, called  ("fundamental pieces"), were played during a meditative practice called , in return for alms, as a method of attaining enlightenment, and as a healing modality.

During the Meiji period (1868–1912), the Japanese government formally abolished the Fuke sect. Documentation of the musical repertoire of the performers survived, and it has been revived in the 21st century.

History 

According to a legend dating from 1795, a Japanese priest returned from China in the middle of the 13th century and purportedly brought the  with him.

Though the  named their sect Fuke-shū, the sect was never acknowledged as a sect or a sub-sect of Rinzai school of Zen Buddhism.  is the Japanese form of Puhua, a peer of Linji Yixuan (Rinzai), a Zen teacher active in China in the 9th century. Puhua is also mentioned in the Rinzai Analects as a strange person who walked around ringing a bell to summon others to enlightenment.

Some of the  in the Edo period (1603–1867) practiced , literally meaning "blowing Zen", a form of meditation through the blowing of a , as opposed to , which is the meditation of quiet sitting practiced by most Zen followers.  pieces (known as ) prioritized precise breathing control as a function of "mindfulness". The oldest documentation of any named  piece is in the  (Collection of Pieces for beginners on Strings and Bamboo, 1664). This text mentions , ,  and other pieces, but it does not mention any of the pieces considered to be the "three classics" (, , ).

 first appeared in the 17th century, though predecessors are depicted in paintings and texts from around 1500 onwards. There is no evidence of any earlier tradition of -playing monks, and it is recorded that in 1518 the  was regarded by some as an instrument for court music (), not for religious music.

Travel around Japan was heavily restricted in the Edo period, but the   managed to obtain a rare exemption from the Tokugawa shogunate, most likely for political reasons. There had been several uprisings involving masterless samurai () during the first half of the 17th century, and by acknowledging the , who by their own regulations had to be of samurai descent, the authorities hoped to control such . To be given a free pass in these times was a highly unusual and very special exemption from travel restrictions, and some researchers argue that in return for this privilege the  had to report back to the central government about conditions in the provinces. 

When the Tokugawa shogunate came to power over a unified Japan at the beginning of the 17th century, the  came under criticism for the first time. Because many new  had formerly been samurai disenfranchised during the Sengoku period (16th century), the potential for trouble was obvious. Because many of the monks were former samurai, and had become  when their masters were defeated—most likely by the shogunate and its allies—the  (now greater in numbers than ever) were seen as untrustworthy and destabilizing to the new shogunate.
