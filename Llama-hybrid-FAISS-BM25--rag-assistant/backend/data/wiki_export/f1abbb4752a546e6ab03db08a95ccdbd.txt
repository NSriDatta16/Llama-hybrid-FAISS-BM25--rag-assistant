The Eurovision Song Contest 1994 was the second time that Estonia had attempted to enter the contest, having failed to qualify from the semi-final stage of the Eurovision Song Contest 1993. The pre-selection process featured multiple artists for the first time, with Silvi Vrait's "Nagu merelaine" being selected by the judging panel to represent the nation in Ireland. In the contest, however, Vrait would place 24th second and last, receiving only two points in the scoring process and only beating fellow Baltic nation Lithuania.
