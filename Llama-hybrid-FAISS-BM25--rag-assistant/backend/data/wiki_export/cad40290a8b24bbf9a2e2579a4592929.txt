The STARFLEET International Conference is the annual business conference where members of STARFLEET: The International Star Trek Fan Association, Inc. meet the organization's leadership. The conference includes leadership meetings, information sessions, a formal banquet, an awards ceremony, and other events and entertainment.

History
STARFLEET is a nonprofit corporation based in North Carolina, and the conference also serves as the required annual meeting of the corporation where members of the Board of Directors, referred to as the Admiralty Board, and the officers of the corporation, known as the Executive Committee, meet in session. Initially called the "National Conference," the International Conference has been hosted in the United States because the majority of STARFLEET's membership resides in that country. Most conferences are stand-alone events, but some have been associated with nearby conventions; for example, in 1995, the conference was part of DragonCon in Atlanta, Georgia. Conference guests have included Vaughn Armstrong, Casey Biggs, Robin Curtis, Richard Herd, J. G. Hertzler, Chase Masterson, Colm Meaney, Tim Russ, Roger Stern and Fred W. Haise.

In 2020, because of the COVID-19 Pandemic, the 2020 IC2020 was delayed until November.  Due to the lateness of the event, a Virtual IC2020 was held ahead of the actual IC2020 online using ZOOM on August 1, 2020.  In early September 2020, IC2020 at BayCon in San Mateo, California was cancelled by the STARFLEET Board of Directors, the Admiralty Board, due to the COVID-19 Pandemic.  Both IC2021 and 2022 were scheduled for Tallahassee, Florida in June of those years but it was deemed that the Pandemic and its subsequent spike would affect it and the site managers agreed to push it back first to 2022 and then to 2023.

In December 2022, the STARFLEET Board of Directors (Admiralty Board), citing continued concerns of the COVID Viruses, voted to cancel the event.  On January 5, 2023, the IC Committee announced that a team has been awarded the next Virtual IC.
