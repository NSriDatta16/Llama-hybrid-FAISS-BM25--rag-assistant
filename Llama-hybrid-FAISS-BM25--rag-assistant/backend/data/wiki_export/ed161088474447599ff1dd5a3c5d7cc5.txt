The suffix -Mazarin was added in 1822 to distinguish it from other French villages named Chilly and refers to the Mazarinettes, the famed nieces of Cardinal Mazarin who resided several years at a mansion in Chilly. The fourth niece, Hortense Mancini, transmitted to her son the titles of Marquess of Chilly and Duke of Mazarin which were ultimately passed to the House of Grimaldi, reigning house of Monaco.
