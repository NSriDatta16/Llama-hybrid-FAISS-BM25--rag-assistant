If the War Goes On: Reflections on War and Politics is a series of essays and other writings by the German-born Swiss author Hermann Hesse.  It covers the period 1914 to 1948.  Much of the book is critical of war and the German war effort, yet contains multifaceted accounts of various Germans who resisted war (especially Nazism).
