Hyndland railway station serves Hyndland in Glasgow, Scotland. The station is  west of  and  west of Glasgow Queen Street on the Argyle and North Clyde Lines. It is managed by ScotRail.

The station was opened by British Railways as part of the electrification of the North Clyde Lines on 5 November 1960, replacing a nearby Hyndland (Stobcross Railway) railway station which was located at the end of a short branch line from Partickhill. This was subsequently adapted for use as an EMU maintenance depot, but eventually closed in 1987. The branch has since been lifted and the site redeveloped.

The lines of the old Lanarkshire and Dunbartonshire Railway (now closed) passed under the east end of the station in a tunnel adjacent to their  station. Immediately to the west of the station is Hyndland East Junction where the Yoker and Singer (including the Milngavie branch) lines diverge.

Hyndland station is accessible from the surrounding areas of Hyndland, Broomhill and Hughenden and also serves the nearby Gartnavel General Hospital, Gartnavel Royal Hospital and Glasgow Homoeopathic Hospital.

A ceramic mural called "Wonderful Trains" by the children of Hyndland Secondary School marks the station's entrance tunnel. It was commissioned to celebrate Glasgow's year as European City of Culture in 1990.

In 2017, a local domestic cat became associated with the station.
