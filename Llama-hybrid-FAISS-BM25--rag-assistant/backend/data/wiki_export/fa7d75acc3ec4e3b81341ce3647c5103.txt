Controversies

The 1972 escape of 15 inmates 
On the night of August 18, 1972, between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m., 15 inmates escaped from the Kuma bunker, which was considered the most escape-proof prison in Sweden. Those who escaped were considered to be some of Sweden's most dangerous criminals. Among the escapees were Lars-Inge Svartenbrandt, Miro Barešić and Nisse Pistol, among others. One of the factors contributing to the success of the escape was that the security department was not monitored by guards around the clock. Instead, guards patrolled the department at regular intervals during the night.

The police were able to establish early on that the 15 cell doors had not been broken into, but had been opened with a key. However, it has never been proven how the actual opening of the doors took place. One theory is that the inmates made their own keys by secretly making impressions of the guards' keys. Another theory is that the keys were bought by a prison guard. In order to open the doors, an inmate managed to fool the guards that he was already locked up. He then hid until the ward was unattended and then unlocked the others' cells. A total of 20 cells were opened, but five inmates chose to stay behind, partly because they had little time left before their release. The escape caused a huge police response. All 15 of the escapees were eventually captured by the police.

The 1991 escape 
On May 9, 1991, Marten Imandi and Ioan Ursuț escaped from Kumla. They were both placed in the security section of the institution.
