Kootenay River Secondary School (formerly named Prince Charles Secondary and Creston Valley Secondary School) is a public high school in Creston, British Columbia, Canada; part of School District 8 Kootenay Lake. The school provides a range of activities that students can enroll in, and many clubs as well.

Originally called Prince Charles Secondary, the school decide to remove that name in mid-2021, following a request by a teacher as part of a reconciliation process with the First Nations in British Columbia. After temporarily changing the name to Creston Valley Secondary School, the school district in December 2021 voted to adopt the permanent name of Kootenay River Secondary School.
