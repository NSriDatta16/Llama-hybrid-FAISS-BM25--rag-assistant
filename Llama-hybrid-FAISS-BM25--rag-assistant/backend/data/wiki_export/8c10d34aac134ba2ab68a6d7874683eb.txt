PMHUB is a free (not for profit) virtual community of professional project managers who recognise the Project Management Institute's Project Management Body of Knowledge (or briefly PMBOK) project management standard. Whilst a number of the members have already earned their PMP (Project Management Professional) certification the majority of the community consists of those who aspire to become PMP or CAPM-certified.

Site Purpose 

PMHub is a study resource which aims to assist managers around the world to study for their PMP or CAPM (Certified Associate in Project Management) certification exams, based on PMBOK Third Edition.

PMHub maintains archives of "lessons learned” from project managers who have passed their PMP exam, CAPM exam and PgMP exam with the help of project management experts. Also included are downloadable files and study guides, sample questions, tips and tricks, and advice from people who have passed the exam. Its website archived more than 500 PMP Exam questions accessible to all.

PMHuB maintains around 25 PMP, Project Management and CAPM forums. The most commonly visited forums are: Lessons Learned/exam tips and Tricks, CAPM and the PMHub Discussions on PMP Certification Yahoogroup Forum (which archived more than 20,000 questions and answers since 2001), and Jim Owens PMP Exam Tips & Columns.
