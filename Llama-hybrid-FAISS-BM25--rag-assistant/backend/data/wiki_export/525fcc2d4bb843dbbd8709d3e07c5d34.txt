へ, in hiragana, or ヘ in katakana, is one of the Japanese kana, which represents one mora. The  sound is the only sound that is written identically in hiragana and katakana and therefore confusable according to the Unicode Standard. In the Sakhalin dialect of the Ainu language, ヘ can be written as small ㇸ to represent a final h after an e sound (エㇸ eh).
