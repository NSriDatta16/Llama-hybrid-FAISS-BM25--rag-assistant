With a Song In My Heart is Stevie Wonder's third studio album (his first without Little before his name), released in 1963 on the Tamla (Motown) label. The album was the first to drop Wonder's Little nickname as the 13-year-old singer went the same route of his label mate Marvin Gaye and covered a set of standards. Like Gaye and other Motown acts, label president Berry Gordy wanted all of his artists to be established on a crossover basis. The album did not immediately spell success for Wonder on the adult contemporary set. Veteran jazz arranger Ernie Wilkins arranged and conducted the album.
