The Fallibroome Academy is a mixed secondary academy school in Macclesfield, Cheshire, England. It has approximately 1567 students, including around 365 in the sixth form. The school is a specialist performing arts college, leading edge, national training school and a national teaching school, equivalent to a teaching hospital. Fallibroome was opened as a purpose-built comprehensive school on the present site in September 1979. An OFSTED inspection report in 2022 rated the school as "Good"

Although only officially opened at its present location in 1980, during the academic year 1978-9 it operated from the old premises of the Wycliffe Avenue Secondary Modern School for Girls in Wilmslow as a 'stop gap' for a grammar school intake of 72 boys who were unable to be taken by King's School, Macclesfield.

In 2014 a new building was opened, housing a new sixth form centre and new canteen.

The school attracted headlines for its innovative "welcome video", which featured all students and staff in elaborate choreographed sequences.

Design and technology department
The department has had success in many national competitions over the last few years including Greenpower, Young Master Chef and the Audi Innovation award. The department shares its good practice by holding "professional development activities" for local schools and shares its resources via its own website.

The year groups start from year 7 (11–12) and go up to year 11 (15–16). After this stage the pupils either move on (e.g. start a different college or get a job) or stay on for years 12–13, which is also known as Sixth Form, for further education.
