"Free for All" is an episode of the allegorical British science fiction TV series The Prisoner. It was written and directed by Patrick McGoohan (though he used the pseudonym "Paddy Fitz" for the writer credit) and the second episode to be produced. It was the fourth episode to be broadcast in the UK on ITV (ATV Midlands and Grampian) on Friday 20 October 1967 and first aired in the United States on CBS on Saturday 29 June 1968.

The episode stars Patrick McGoohan as Number Six and features Eric Portman as Number Two . The central theme of the episode is corruption and fraud in elections.

Plot summary
Number Six is persuaded to run for election to the post of Number Two when it is suggested to him by the new incumbent that, should he win, he will finally meet Number One. Number Fifty-Eight, a newly arrived young woman who speaks only an unidentified Slavic-sounding foreign language (really "a meaningless linguistic pastiche specially invented by the scriptwriters") is assigned to Number Six as his assistant, which she enthusiastically embraces, although he does not. Both men campaign for the office, with Number Six subversively offering freedom to the Village masses if he is elected. Number Six participates ambivalently, but abruptly makes a break for freedom himself in the midst of the campaign by escaping in a motorboat. He is retrieved on the water by Rover while he robotically mouths campaign platitudes.

Number Six and Number Two drink and commiserate in a cave where illegal liquor is distilled and Number Two states that he detests The Village. Number Six is again repeatedly drugged and coerced into accepting the campaign, and wins the election when virtually all the robotic "citizens" vote for him. As he and Number Fifty-Eight go to the Green Dome to take command of the Village, she agitates him by playing with the buttons on the control panel before brutally slapping him around times with surprising strength, then stunning him with bright lighting. As Number Six becomes somewhat more lucid and attempts to broadcast to the Villagers that they are free to go, he is beaten by a group of mechanics in coveralls, and Number Fifty-Eight, now speaking perfect English, reveals herself as the real incoming Number Two, while the previous Number Two prepares to head out. She asks her departing predecessor to give her "regards to the homeland".

Notes
 The photograph of Number Six on his election poster is the same as that used for his former role as a spy that is seen being filed away at the beginning of almost all episodes. It was also, at the time, actor Patrick McGoohan's official publicity picture.
 Although there is no strict or established running order for the series, Six's line "I'm new here!" indicates that this story is an early one, probably taking place after 'Arrival' and 'Dance Of The Dead' as #3 of the 17 episodes.
 Two scenes were edited prior to the transmission of the episode.  The first was an extension of the nightclub scene, showing Six further losing his temper and loudly singing the 'Vote For Me' song heard in the cave scene.  The second was a removal of the worst of the beating Six receives at the end of the story.  This scene was restored to its proper length for reruns and home media releases, whereas the deleted nightclub footage appears to have been lost.
