Club career
Usually just known as Grenville Morris, he was born in Builth Wells, Wales. He was educated at Ellesmere College, Shropshire from May 1892 to December 1893.

Morris began playing football for his local team, Builth Wells F.C. He was still recorded as playing for this team (described as "Builth Football Club" in the press) in the Brecon County Times, of 29 December 1893, scoring a goal in a 4–1 win over Brecon. By January 1894, he was playing for Aberystwyth Town. Morris scored 111 goals for the team in 75 appearances. He moved from Aberystwyth Town to Swindon Town making his debut on 6 February 1897. At this time Swindon played in both the Southern Football League, and the Western Football League. Grenville scored on his debut for Swindon in a game away against North Fleet in the Southern League. He then scored a goal in the game at home to New Brompton in the same league a week later. He went on to play 50 games for the Robins in all competitions, scoring 44 goals. This total consisted of 31 appearances in the Southern League, scoring 23 goals. Sixteen appearances in the Western League, scoring 20 goals. And three appearances in the FA Cup, with 1 goal. He was one of the greatest players of his generation and was known as The Prince of the Inside-Lefts.

Morris moved on to Nottingham Forest in 1898 for a sum of £200. He still holds Forest's all-time goal scoring record with 217 in all competitions.
