Arthur Harry Griffin (15 January 1911 â€“ 9 July 2004) was a British journalist and mountaineer. He is particularly remembered for his evocative recording, in his writing, of rock-climbing in the Lake District in the inter-war years, especially a group called 'The Coniston Tigers'; for his long-running 'Lakeland Diary' column in The Guardian (spanning a period of 53 years); and for having inspired, via these columns, and an article in the Lancashire Evening Post, the rebirth of interest in the Bob Graham Round.

Fuller details of his life, including his wartime service as an intelligence officer,  may be found in the Guardian obituary. He was  friends with Alfred Wainwright but somewhat disapproved of the damage to the fells that the popularity of Wainwright's guides could cause.
