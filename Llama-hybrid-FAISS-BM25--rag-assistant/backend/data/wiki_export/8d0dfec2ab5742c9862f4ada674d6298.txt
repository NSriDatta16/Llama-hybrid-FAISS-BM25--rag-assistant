Rocket Raccoon was a four-issue comic book limited series that was published in 1985 and featuring the eponymous character.  It was written by Bill Mantlo, penciled by Mike Mignola and inked by Al Gordon (Issue # 3 was inked by Al Milgrom).  All covers by Mignola and Gordon.  The series took place on half world where Rocket and his anthropomorphic allies fought killer clowns with lethal juggling balls and deadly unicycles and who spoke in a stilted language full of alliteration and rhyme.

Plot synopsis
Rocket and his animal companions were genetically manipulated animals with human level intelligence and a bipedal body construction.  They were created to be caretakers of the inmates (or "loonies") on the verdant side of halfworld. Rocket was a guard who protected the colony against various threats.

Rocket and his friends ultimately cured the inmates of their mental illnesses and then took off into space for their own adventures.
