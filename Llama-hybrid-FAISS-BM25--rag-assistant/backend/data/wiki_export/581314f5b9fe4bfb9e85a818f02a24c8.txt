Political career
Krzysztof Rutkowski was a Polish politician who has held various positions throughout his career. In the 2001 parliamentary elections, he was elected to the Sejm of the 4th term on behalf of Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland, receiving 13,946 votes. He left the party and parliamentary club in December 2001 and later joined the People's Democratic Party, Federative Parliamentary Club, and Economic Party parliamentary groups. Rutkowski worked in the Administration and Home Affairs Committee and the Culture and Media Committee. He was an observer from 2003 to 2004 and a Member of the European Parliament of the 5th term from May to July 2004, serving on the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security, and Defense Policy.

In 2008, he registered as an independent candidate in the supplementary elections to the Senate in the Krosno constituency, receiving 357 votes and taking 10th place out of 12 candidates.

Unlawful detective activity and kidnappings
Starting in 2005, after his political career, Rutkowski became active as a so-called "private detective" and was not stopped by the fact that he had already come into conflict with the law on several occasions and was convicted, among other things, of unlawful detective work and kidnapping. 

In 2012, the Berlin Daily BZ reported an incident: men dressed in black with "Rutkowski Patrol" badges allegedly tried to drag a Polish-born woman with a German passport into a limousine against her will on a street in Berlin. The suspected kidnapper is said to have been private detective Rutkowski, apparently hired by the young woman's father, according to BZ. 

In an incident on April 7th, 2023 (Good Friday) at the Gräfenhausen motorway rest area in Germany, a Polish trucking company owner reportedly hired Rutkowski's organization to forcibly end a strike by truck drivers. Rutkowski's men arrived at the scene in armoured-like vehicles and wearing bulletproof vests, intending to intimidate the striking drivers and potentially seize the trucks by force. The police intervened and temporarily arrested 19 people, including Rutkowski's men.

Repatriation of Polish 9-year old from Norway
In June 2011, Rutkowski led a group of civilians who freed a 9-year old Polish girl from the custody of Norwegian authorities, and repatriated her. Reactions included Khalid Skah's comment that "Now Norwegian authorities can taste their own medicine." (Skah has had two of his children freed by a group of Norwegians including commando/Lieutenant Commander T.A.Bolle.

In December 2011, a Polish court ruled that the child would not be sent back to Norway.

Repatriation of a Russian-born teenager from Norway
A Russian-born teenager arrived in Russia in November 2011, after Rutkowski removed him from the custody of Norwegian authorities and transferred him to Poland.
