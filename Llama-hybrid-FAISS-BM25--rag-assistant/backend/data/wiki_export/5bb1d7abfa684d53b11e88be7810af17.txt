The North Dakota Fighting Hawks baseball team was a part of the athletic program at the University of North Dakota in Grand Forks, North Dakota.

History
The team was a member of the NCAA Division I Western Athletic Conference. It played at Harold Kraft Memorial Field. The last head coach was Jeff Dodson. The public address announcer for the baseball team was Kris Holm.

Announced April 12, 2016, as a part of expense reductions because of institution and statewide budget cuts, the University of North Dakota announced the baseball program would be discontinued at the end of their 2015â€“16 season.

On May 3, 2023, Zach Muckenhirn, who played for UND from 2014 to 2016, made his Major League Baseball (MLB) debut against the Detroit Tigers, becoming the first player in UND history to play in the major leagues.
