Susan Van Camp is a fantasy artist, best known for her work on various role playing games.

Biography
Van Camp was born on June 11, 1959, and raised in Flint, Michigan. She began her commercial career in gaming by doing work for Steve Jackson's Car Wars series. From there she proceeded to comic books with Arrow Comics' Tales from the Aniverse in 1984, and Varcelâ€™s Vixens from Caliber Comics. Comics led to science fiction conventions and the art shows held at the conventions, where she began painting and putting her paintings up for bidding by the public. In 1994 Van Camp began doing work for Magic: The Gathering.

She began selling her own RPG game in 1996, Dragon Storm.
