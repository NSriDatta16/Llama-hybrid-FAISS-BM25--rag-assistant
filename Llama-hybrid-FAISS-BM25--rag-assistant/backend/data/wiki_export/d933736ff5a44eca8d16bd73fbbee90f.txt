History 
The Last Vegas made their recording debut with the full-length album Lick 'Em and Leave 'Em (2004) on the independent label Get Hip Records. A second full-length album, Seal the Deal (2006), followed on the same label.

After leaving Get Hip, the Last Vegas released a five-track EP High Class Trash (2007), spotlighting the song "Raw Dog" (previously released in Seal the Deal), which was featured in the popular video game Guitar Hero II (2006). The full-length, The Last Vegas (2008), showcased the band growth with new singer Cherry and bassist Smash. In December 2008 the Last Vegas won Guitar Center's On-Stage: Your Chance to Make Rock History contest opening for Mötley Crüe. They also won $25,000 cash, $20,000 in new gear from Gibson Guitars, a management deal from 10th Street Entertainment and a recording deal from Eleven Seven Music. They beat out 8,000 contestants for the coveted prize.

In 2008, the band was also picked as Spin magazine's "Best New Discovery" at SXSW 2008.

The Last Vegas joined Mötley Crüe on their US winter Saints of Los Angeles Tour, along with Theory of a Deadman and Hinder. The band released its fourth full-length album and first major label album Whatever Gets You Off, the album was released to mainly positive reviews, produced by Mötley Crüe's Nikki Sixx, Sixx:A.M.'s DJ Ashba and frequent collaborator Marti Frederiksen, although most of the material on the album consists of the band's self-released self-titled album from 2008. The first single from the album was "I'm Bad".
