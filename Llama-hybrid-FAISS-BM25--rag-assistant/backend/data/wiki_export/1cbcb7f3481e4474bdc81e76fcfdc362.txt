The División Intermedia (), also known as the Segunda División (), is the second tier  professional football league in Paraguay. It is organized by the Asociación Paraguaya de Fútbol.

Overview
Since 1910 the second division tournaments have changed rules, number of teams and names. As of 2006, División Intermedia is the name for the second division and 16 teams are part of it. The champion and the runner-up of this league gains the right to participate in the Liga Paraguaya: Primera División, the Paraguay's top division of football. The last three teams are relegated to the third division (called "Primera de Ascenso" for teams from Gran Asunción and Primera División Nacional B for teams outside of the Gran Asunción area). The three spots left by relegated teams are occupied by one team from the Primera de Ascenso and one team from the Primera División Nacional B which is a tournament where teams from the whole country compete, giving them a chance to eventually make it to the first division.
