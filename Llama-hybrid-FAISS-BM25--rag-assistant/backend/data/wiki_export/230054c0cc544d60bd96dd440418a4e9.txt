History

The colonization of Valle de Santo Domingo (Valley of Santo Domingo) originated around 1940. A ranch called El Crucero ("The Crossroad") was settled in a crossroad. Because of this, people started to gather around it and the population started to grow. It quickly became a commercial hub and an obligatory travel stop for all the inhabitants of Valle de Santo Domingo, as well as for people going north or south on the peninsula. Then, it became known as Villa Constitución, and later, Ciudad Constitución. Even today, many locals still call it "El Crucero". Every 5 February the city becomes the state's capital for one day. Since 1996, the Instituto Tecnológico Superior de Ciudad Constitución serves as a higher education institution.
