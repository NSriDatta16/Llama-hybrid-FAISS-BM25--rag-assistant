Connor O'Neill is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera Neighbours, played by Patrick Harvey. He made his first screen appearance during the episode on 19 April 2002. Harvey was still in school when he won the role of Connor. He initially auditioned using an Australian accent, but later re-read for the part in his natural Northern Irish accent. The producers decided this would suit the role of Connor better. The character became well known for his friendship with Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) and his relationships with Michelle Scully (Kate Keltie), Carmella Cammeniti (Natalie Blair) and Serena Bishop (Lara Sacher). One storyline saw Connor have a one-night stand with Lori Lee (Michelle Ang), which resulted in the birth of their daughter, Madeleine (Madison Lu). Harvey decided to move on from Neighbours, so he could pursue other roles and Connor departed on 30 May 2006. In August 2012, it was announced Harvey had reprised his role for a four-week guest stint and Connor returned on 30 October. He departed on 27 November 2012.

Casting
Harvey was still in school when he secured the role. He had always wanted to act and hired an agent while he was living in Australia. It was then that the part in Neighbours "came along". When Harvey auditioned for the role of Connor, he did so with an Australian accent. He came back and re-read the part again in his Northern Irish accent and he was given the role. Casting director Jan Russ told a reporter from the BBC that Harvey did the best Australian accent she had ever heard, but she and the producers decided to give the character Harvey's natural accent.

Development

Characterisation
Connor was introduced to Neighbours as a friend of Jack Scully (Jay Bunyan). He was a backpacker from the United Kingdom who came to live with Jack's family. Connor was illiterate and on his arrival in Australia, he accidentally took Malcolm Kennedy's (Benjamin McNair) luggage. An Inside Soap writer called Connor an "enigmatic stranger". Connor befriended the show's other teenagers and he helped Nina Tucker (Delta Goodrem) overcome her shyness when it came to singing. Producers later decided to introduce Connor into the shared home at Number 30 with Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) and Stuart Parker (Blair McDonough), deeming it the "House of Trouser". The trio played out the serial's comedy stories and Harvey told Jason Herbison from Inside Soap that "the directors duck when they see us coming, we're forever coming up with our own ideas and adding little things in." A writer for the BBC's Neighbours website described Connor as "a splendid and thoughtful young man". A Channel 5 website reporter branded Connor a "lovable larrikin", while adding that he was "famed for a rather unique sense of style." In November 2012, Harvey told an Inside Soap writer that there would be no chance of Connor finding his "inner adult" anytime soon. He added "He's still a bit of a larrikin – nothing's changed there. But Connor's given some tough love while on Ramsay Street – and that could end up being a 'light bulb' moment for him..."

Relationships

Michelle Scully
Connor arrives in Australia on working visa which permits him to only work for the same employer for three months. He starts a relationship with Michelle Scully (Kate Keltie) and works for her father Joe Scully (Shane Connor). They later realise that the conditions of his visa have been broken as he carried on working for Joe outside the time limit. Keltie told Herbison that Michelle "panics" when immigration contact the Scully household. Upon receiving legal advice, Connor is told that deportation is likely. Michelle tells Connor "We've got to get out of here" and the pair go on the run where she comes up with a plan to marry Connor. Keltie explained that "it would be a solution to their problem, and even though neither of them are really ready for it, she's prepared to do it for Connor." He does not like the idea because he is scared of Joe's reaction. He does decide to see a priest and plays with the idea. The actress branded their actions as "completely ridiculous and irrational" because they are only sixteen. Keltie would have felt differently "if they really loved each other, but they haven't been together long enough to know." Michelle later left Connor to go to New York.

In March 2004, Connor became caught in the middle of a "passion-fuelled" love triangle when Carmella Cammeniti (Natalie Blair) and Michelle returned to Erinsborough. Connor is surprised when Carmella reappears, especially as she was sent away by her "scary underworld-figure" father, Rocco (Robert Forza). He tries to resist her advances, but he succumbs and they head to the bedroom. Harvey said "When Carmella comes back from Italy, Connor thinks 'Ok, let's see what happens. I really do like you'. They disappear into his room and come out a bit later. They're just having a bit of fun – they're enjoying a kiss and cuddle. But then Connor looks up and sees Michelle standing in the hallway." Connor was unaware that Michelle was on her way home and the moment is awkward. Michelle assumed that she and Connor would pick up where they left off, so she cannot believe what she is seeing. Harvey admitted that Connor was "shattered" when Michelle left him to go to New York and that she may have been the only person he has ever really loved. When she wrote and told him she was seeing an American boy, he thought things were over between them for good. Harvey explained "That's when he thought he should move on. He turned to Lori and then Nina and later Carmella. I think Connor really loves Carmella's personality. He likes the way she thinks and gets on with life, and there's definitely an attraction there." Although Connor reassures Carmella that his relationship is in the past, it becomes obvious that he is torn.

Lori Lee
Connor forms a close friendship Lori Lee (Michelle Ang) and they have a one-night stand. Harvey opined that it was a "rebound thing" because there was no attraction between them. Connor is "really missing" Michelle and Lori is heartbroken over Jack Scully (Jay Bunyan) and the scenario develops from there. Lori is a "shoulder to cry on" and it feels right for them both at the time, but the next morning they regret it. The situation becomes awkward because "Connor thinks that Lori might want a relationship, and Lori thinks the same of him, even though that's not the case." Lori discovers she is pregnant and Connor is led to believe that she has had an abortion before she leaves Erinsborough. Connor later reunites with Michelle, who returns home from New York to visit her family. They decide to spend a romantic night at Lassiter's Hotel and Michelle gives Connor a makeover. She then dares him to walk into the hotel lobby and Connor runs into Lori, who introduces him to his daughter, Madeleine (Madison Lu). Of the situation, Harvey told TV Week's Jackie Brygel "Connor is standing there looking like an idiot. Lori says 'Here's your daughter!' He just can't believe it. Everything feels like it's crashing down around him. It's a massive shock." Ang stated that Lori was not imagining introducing Connor to Maddy like that, but she is caught off guard in the lobby. Lori is unaware that Connor and Michelle are back together and Ang thought Lori might not have brought Maddy into Connor's life if she knew. Lori is keen to make sure her daughter knows who her father is and she wants to give Connor the chance to be a father.

Carmella Cammeniti
Connor and Carmella's relationship is tested when Frank Romano (Lliam Amor) begins to stalk Carmella. To begin with they are unaware that Frank is the perpetrator and they attempt to figure it out. Connor thinks that Dylan Timmins (Damien Bodie) is responsible – but he and spots the actual stalker and attempts to catch Frank. It soon becomes apparent that he came to the house to set up an accident. Blair stated that "the step is covered in something slippery, and Connor falls and knocks himself unconscious, which is when they realise they must take these threats seriously." The storyline comes to the forefront of the show when Frank wants Connor removed from the scenario. He kidnaps Connor and then decides to make his move on Carmella. Blair told a correspondent from Inside Soap that Carmella realises that Connor is in danger when "Frank comes on to her and tells her to forget about Connor". Carmella is "terrified" for Connor and thinks "her only chance to save" him is to play along with Frank's games. Connor remains unconscious and tied up inside a derelict building, which David Bishop (Kevin Harrington) plans to demolish. Carmella's attempts at tricking Frank fail and "he tells her to forget Connor, as he's taken care of him". Blair added that it "sounds like Connor is dead". Stuart manages to save Carmella, but he refuses to reveal where Connor is. A crowd gather outside the building that Connor is located in and begin a demolition countdown. The actress explained "since nobody knows Connor is inside, there doesn't seem much chance of him escaping at all."

After Connor is rescued Carmella decides to leave Erinsborough to overcome her ordeal. Connor begins a relationship with Serena Bishop (Lara Sacher); this shocks Carmella when she returns with the hope of a reconciliation. Blair told Inside Soap's writer that her character left Connor to have some time to herself but did promise Connor that she would return. Carmella decides to "surprise" Connor with her return, unaware that Serena is now on the scene. Connor is "shocked" to see Carmella, who presumes they are back together; Carmella is not impressed when Connor tells her the truth about Serena. This formed a new "tricky love triangle" for the characters. Blair explained that "Serena's a kid, but Carmella sees herself as a sophisticated woman. In her mind, Connor will choose her over a schoolgirl." Connor remains loyal to Serena but Carmella manages to get the "upper hand" when Maddy is taken ill. Lori asks Connor for fifty thousand dollars to pay for Maddy's ear operation. Connor asks Carmella for a loan and she agrees "on the condition that he spends time with her until he repays the loan. It's blackmail basically."

The story arc culminates with both Connor and Carmella resorting to lies and deception. Connor fakes a robbery at Bounce to repay Carmella, who is a concocting a new scheme. Harvey told a writer from Inside Soap that Carmella pretends that she loaned the money from a member of the local mafia. She "makes up this elaborate story so it looks as though she's really stuck her neck out for Connor. It's all part of her new plan to steal him away [from Serena]." When Stuart investigates the robbery, Carmella realises that Connor is the perpetrator and returns the money to Bounce. However, the act makes "Connor is completely confused" and left looking "even more suspicious" to the police. Izzy Hoyland (Natalie Bassingthwaighte) convinces Carmella to maintain her lies and deceive Connor further. Carmella asks Connor to accompany her to a meeting with the mafia, but tells him to wait outside as they do not exist. Harvey explained that "Connor's really worried [about Carmella], and insists on confronting the bad guys himself"; and in doing so he exposes Carmella's plot.

Departure
In January 2006, it was announced that Harvey had decided to leave Neighbours. He filmed his final scenes in February, and his exit scenes aired in May 2006. He told Jackie Brygel of TV Week that he knew it was time to move on from the series, saying "You have to get out into the big bad world and see if you can make a go of it. Acting is still my priority." When asked if there was a chance he could return to the soap in the future, Harvey replied "Who knows? Never say never!"

Return
In July 2012, the executive producer of Neighbours, Richard Jasek, was asked about an upcoming "mystery male returnee" during an interview with Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly. Jasek commented "I can't say too much at the moment, but Neighbours does have a rich history of wonderful past characters and yes, we do have a familiar face visiting – all will be revealed shortly…" On 17 August 2012, it was confirmed that Harvey had reprised his role and he would be seen on-screen from October. The actor was initially contracted for a four-week guest stint. Harvey began filming his scenes in the same week and he stated "As soon as the wardrobe department pulled out the boxers and Hawaiian shirt, I was back in character. However, it wasn't until Ryan dropped his dacks in a scene that I knew I was home!"

Connor's exit storyline in 2006 saw him disappear in mysterious circumstances, so Toadie is "over the moon" to see his friend alive and well. Harvey revealed that Connor turns up at Toadie's house in the middle of Sonya Mitchell's (Eve Morey) baby shower, which does not please her. He continued "But Toadie is delighted that Connor is back. Things are very grown-up in his life now, and this is a sort of release for him." Harvey explained further that Connor manages to cause an argument during the baby shower, which causes Sonya to ask Toadie to "send him packing".

Connor meets Jack, who tells him that he can stay with his parents if he ever visits Australia. Connor later shares a flight to the country with Malcolm Kennedy. He accidentally takes Malcolm's bag, which is identical to his own, instantly making the Erinsborough residents suspicious of him.

Connor then decides to go travelling.

Sonya asks Connor if he can organise a bucks party for Toadie and he organises an inflatable boxing ring to be delivered to Ramsay Street. Connor glues a pair of boxing gloves to Toadie's hands, before leaving for Lorne.

Reception
For his portrayal of Connor, Harvey won "Most Popular New Male Talent" at the 2003 Logie Awards. A BBC website writer said Connor's most notable moments were "When it was revealed that he couldn't read. Finding out Lori was pregnant. Meeting his daughter Maddy for the first time." Speaking of Harvey and Connor, a writer for Virgin Media said that they thought the character did not have any serious storylines. They stated "Patrick found fame as Toadie's best friend, and Irish funny-man Connor O'Neill. But with storylines like being illiterate and being threatened with deportation, is it any wonder he didn't last long?" Beverley Johanson of The Age stated Harvey "stirs many a teenage heart as Connor". A columnist from Inside Soap said that when Connor moved into the Scully household, he got an "added bonus" in the form of Michelle; adding that their "dangerous liaison" was "Ramsay Street's hottest secret" until Joe found out.
