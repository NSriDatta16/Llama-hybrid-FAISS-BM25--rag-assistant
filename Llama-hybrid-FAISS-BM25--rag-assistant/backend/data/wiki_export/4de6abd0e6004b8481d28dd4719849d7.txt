History
Prior to the discovery of gold on the Witwatersrand in 1886, the suburb lay on land on one of the original farms called Klipfontein. It became a suburb in 1901 and possibly named Johannes van der Linde who laid out the land with Lourens Geldenhuys. Prior to the land being surveyed, it was used to grow fruit. In 1937, it became part of the City of Johannesburg.
