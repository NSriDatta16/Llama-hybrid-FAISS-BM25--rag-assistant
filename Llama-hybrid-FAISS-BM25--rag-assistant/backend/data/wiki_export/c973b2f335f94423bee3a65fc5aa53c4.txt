fouls Very common in water polo, both as a defensive strategy or because of holding (usually underwater) and rough play.
Ordinary or minor foul: The referee signals with one short whistle blow and points one hand to the spot of the foul and the other hand in the direction of the team who gains possession. Play continues immediately.
If by a defender preventing the free movement of an opponent who is not holding the ball, the attacking team has a free throw. The player fouled has three seconds to make a free pass to another offensive player.
If the attacking team delays play, allows the ball to be pushed underwater, has a player inside the two meter area without the ball or pushes a defending player to create space for a pass or shot, the opposing team is given possession of the ball and play resumes immediately.
Exclusion or major foul: A referee signals a major foul by two short whistle bursts and indicates that the player must leave the field without impacting play and move to the penalty area for twenty seconds.
Dunking (sinking in FINA rules), intentional splashing, or pulling an opponent back who does not have the ball, also interfering with a free throw or attempting to block a shot with two hands.

free throw After an ordinary foul, a player of the team retaining possession of the ball puts the ball in play without delay. The defender may not challenge the player in possession until the ball leaves their hand. After a foul, the player putting the ball in play may only make a direct shot on goal if he/she is beyond the 5 meter line and shoots with one continuous motion.

overplay A player commits too early and is caught out of position by an opponent's move.
overtime If the score is tied at the end of regulation play, two overtime periods of three minutes each are played. Overtime periods are common in tournament play due to the high level of skill of these superior teams.

P
pass see dry pass and wet pass.
passing lane The path between the player with the ball and their teammate to whom he/she intends to pass.
period The game is divided into four periods; the length depends on the level of play:

penalty shootout A tie breaker if the score is tied after two overtime periods. Five players and a goalkeeper are chosen by the coaches of each team. Players shoot from the 5-meter line alternately at either end of the pool in turn until all five have taken a shot. If the score is still tied, the same players shoot alternately until one team misses and the other scores, deciding the winner.
penalty shot See penalty throw.

The penalty shot is attempted from five meters with play stopped. Any defenders flanking the player taking the shot must be no closer than two meters. The goalkeeper must be on the goal line. The referee signals with a whistle and by lowering their arm, and the player taking the penalty shot must immediately throw the ball with an uninterrupted motion toward the goal.
perimeter player The five offensive positions, other than the center forward, i.e.: wings, drivers and point. The perimeter players interchange their positions several times during a single offensive play.
point Position on offense in the center of the line furthest from the goal. The point player's position provides opportunities to pass to teammates and communicate among the offense, like the point guard in basketball.
pop shot An inside water shot, executed by scooping the ball with the non-dominant hand, and "popping" the ball upward, as the player treads up out of the water to meet the ball at its highest point with their outstretched dominant hand and shoots at the goal. During the flight of the ball, from when it is "Popped" up until it reaches the shooting-hand, and contact from behind by a defender will result in a 5-meter penalty shot, and thus it is an effective tool when one has inside water.
possession Undisputed control of the ball. The team with the ball has 30 seconds to take a shot until possession is given to the opposing team.
power play See man up.
power shot An outside water shot in which a player propels their body out of the water and uses their momentum to shoot the ball into the net.

Q
quarter See period.

R
rear-back a move used by an attacking player to create space between him/herself and their defender in an attempt to become open for a pass and subsequently attempt a shot. The attacker begins to swim toward the opponents' goal and abruptly stops and slides backward, awaiting a pass from a teammate, usually the center or 2-meter man.
rebound After an unsuccessful shot at the goal, the ball becomes free in the water, and can be recovered by the offense for another goal attempt or by the defense for a counterattack. A rebound after a shot on goal resets the 30 second possession clock.
red Shouted to teammates when 10 seconds remain on the shot clock, or in cases where a different color (usually yellow) is used to signify 10 seconds, red can be used to warn teammates of only 5 seconds remaining on the shot clock.

red card Shown by a referee to signify that a coach, substitute, or bench personnel has been excluded for misconduct, and is required to leave the pool area immediately and cannot return to the game. See also yellow card.
red flag A red flag is used by officials at the scorer/timekeeper's table to signal when a player has received three exclusion fouls and must sit out the rest of the game.
reentry area Area at each end of the pool near each team bench, designated by a red line, where players may enter and exit the playing area for substitution or exclusion penalties.
referee The two referees control the players, game play and the playing area throughout the match. Their decisions are final including rule infractions, fouls, scoring, possession of the ball and rulings of the timekeeper and goal judges. One referee stands on each side of the pool. The referee with the goal to their right when a team is on the attack is called the attacking or offensive referee. The other, the defensive referee, remains as far back as the attacking player who is furthest from the goal. When the other team regains the ball, their roles reverse as the ball moves to the other goal.
release To break free from a defender to receive a pass.
rolled  the foul regarding a misconduct or game exclusion. This is because of the referee's circular arm motions signifying the player is done for the game.

S
save Successful blocked shot by the goalkeeper. Also called a stop.
setting a screen (or pick) An offense player is positioned to allow their teammate to swim by, while blocking or delaying their defender.

shot clock A clock at each corner of the pool deck counting down (from 30 seconds) the time remaining for a team to take a shot. Also known as the possession clock.

sink To push an opposing player under the water, an exclusion foul if the player is not holding the ball and is in a position of offensive advantage.
skip shot An outside water shot executed by throwing the ball at an angle directly into the water. If done properly and with enough force, the ball will skip off the water into the goal, since the goalkeeper cannot easily anticipate the angle. Also called a bounce shot.
slough A defensive perimeter player intentionally causes an ordinary foul and then moves toward the goal, away from their attacker, who must take a free throw. This tactic allows the defense an opportunity to double-team the hole set and possibly steal the inbound pass. Also called foul and in or foul and drop.
spring shot An inside water shot executed by pushing the ball slightly into the water (but avoiding a ball under foul) and then allowing a sudden release, and a soft tap-in to beat the goalkeeper.
sprint  At the start of each period, teams line up on their own goal line. At the referee's whistle, both teams swim to midpoint of the field, where the referee drops the ball. The first team to recover the ball begins their offense.
stalling Failing to take a shot within 30 seconds or intentional delay in advancing the ball results in a turnover.
steal A steal occurs when a defensive player or goalkeeper legally causes a turnover by their positive, aggressive action(s).
swim off See sprint.
switch Players change defensive assignments to cover a teammate who has fallen behind an opponent, or to match up better with an offensive player in size or speed.

T
tee shot Executed by scooping the ball with the non-dominant hand, loading the ball to the dominant hand, and propelling the ball forward. The off-hand sets itself up as a tee, as in golf or baseball, and the two hands also finish in the shape of a "T".
timeout Each team may call two 60 second timeouts in the four periods of regulation play, and one timeout if the game goes into overtime. During game play, only the team in possession of the ball may call a timeout.
tube water polo See inner tube water polo
turn a defender An offensive move to get by an opponent using leverage or strength. The result is a 180 degree turn, where the defender is "wheeled" around, resulting in the attacking player possessing inside-water, or position towards the goal, with the defender trailing behind. This maneuver often results in the defender being forced to foul.
turnover A team loses possession of the ball, which reverts to the opponent, as a result of a foul or possession for more than 30 seconds without a shot on goal.

U
utility player A player skilled at several offensive or defensive roles, often coming off the bench for substitutions.
 USA Water Polo  The National Governing Body (NGB) for the sport of water polo in the United States.

V

W

walk it in The attacker grips the ball in one hand and either eggbeaters or strokes in toward the goal.
weak side When an offensive player has possession of the ball on one side of the playing area (the strong side), the opposite side is called the weak side. Players will shout "weak" to notify a teammate with the ball that they are open on the other side of the pool.

wet pass A deliberate pass into the water, just out of reach of the intended teammate and their defender. The receiving player can then lunge towards the ball and out of the water to make a shot or pass.
white ball Shouted to teammates when white cap team has possession.
wing The position on offense on either side of the center forward, along the 2 meter line. Players at this position may set screens for the drivers, recover rebounds, and shift laterally or toward the half-distance line to spread out the defenders. More generally, the wing is a player or location to either side of the center of the playing area. To move toward the side of the pool to get open for a pass is to wing out.

Y
yellow card Shown by the referee to indicate that a coach, substitute, or bench personnel has been officially cautioned for misconduct, but may continue participating in the game. If a person receives a second yellow card caution, it has the effect of receiving a red card, and the individual must leave the playing area for the rest of the match. Players out of the water are not show a yellow card in Water Polo.

Z
