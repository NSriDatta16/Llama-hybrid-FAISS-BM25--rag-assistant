Sir Peter Derek Fry (26 May 1931 – 12 May 2015) was a British Conservative politician.

Born in High Wycombe, Fry was educated at the Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe, and Worcester College, Oxford. He became an insurance broker and a director of the family retail clothing business. He served as a councillor on Buckinghamshire County Council from 1961.

Fry contested Nottingham North in 1964 and Willesden East in 1966. He was elected a Member of Parliament at the 1969 Wellingborough by-election. He represented the seat until 1997, when he lost to Labour's Paul Stinchcombe by a margin of 187 votes. He subsequently became the Chairman of the Bingo Association, Chairman of the Federation of European Bingo Associations, and a trustee of the Responsibility in Gambling Trust.

During his time as an MP, Fry was a Eurosceptic, who repeatedly voted against the government in 1992-1993 over its attempts to enshrine the Maastricht Treaty into UK law.

Fry was interviewed in 2012 as part of The History of Parliament's oral history project.

Fry died on 12 May 2015, aged 83.
