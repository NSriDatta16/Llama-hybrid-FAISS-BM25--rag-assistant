Bad Schwartau is the largest city in the district of Ostholstein, in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. It is situated on the river Trave and the Schwartau creek, approx. 5 km north of the Hanseatic City of Lübeck. Bad Schwartau is a spa-city, well known for its iodide saline waters. The city is located about 13 km from the Baltic Sea.

Economy and Infrastructure 

Bad Schwartau is best known for its food industry. The largest employer is the company  Schwartauer Werke which is owned by Dr. Oetker. Another economic focus is the healthcare sector.

There is a railway station in Bad Schwartau along the Kiel–Lübeck railway and the Lübeck–Puttgarden railway. The two railways go together as double track from Lübeck and branches from each other 1.5 km north of the station. As part of the improvement and rebuilding of the Lübeck–Puttgarden railway, the station will around 2025 be built on lower level so the two nearby level crossings can let those streets cross on bridges over the railway.

Sport 
The most important sports club in the city is VfL Bad Schwartau, whose men's handball team played in the handball national league. In 2002, the Bundesliga license was taken over by HSV Hamburg. This was followed by relegation to the handball regional league Northeast. Since the 2007/2008 season, VfL has been playing in the second handball Bundesliga again. Since the 2017/18 season, the team has competed as VfL Lübeck-Schwartau.
