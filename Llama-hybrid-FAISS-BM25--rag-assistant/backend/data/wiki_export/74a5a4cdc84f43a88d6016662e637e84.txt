Cecil Graham "Ceece" Dillon (April 26, 1908 - November 13, 1969) was an American-Canadian professional ice hockey right winger who played 10 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the New York Rangers and the Detroit Red Wings. He won the Stanley Cup in 1933 with the New York Rangers against the Toronto Maple Leafs three games to one on April 13, 1933.

Early life

Playing career
In 1927, Dillon turned professional. He played one season with the original Owen Sound Greys before playing for the Springfield Indians.

New York Rangers
For the 1930 season, Dillon was called up to the National Hockey League by the New York Rangers, with whom he would stay until 1939, never missing a single game during his time with the team. A left-handed shooter, Dillon scored 167 goals in total and led the Rangers in scoring during the 1935–36, 1936–37, and 1937–38 seasons averaging about 34 points per season. Dillon played an integral part in the Rangers' Stanley Cup championship in the 1932–33 NHL season. Cecil scored seven goals in his first five games of the postseason, against the Montreal Canadiens, Detroit Red Wings and the first game of the Stanley Cup Finals against the Toronto Maple Leafs. The goal in the first game of the Finals was the game-winner, and he scored his eighth goal of the postseason in game 3, setting a team record, later tied by Vic Hadfield in 1971. Dillon was selected as one of the games' stars for his work in holding the Primeau-Conacher-Jackson "Kid Line" to no goals in the final. Dillon's best season saw him score 25 goals in 48 games in 1934–35. He was a member of the first All-Star team in 1937-38, and the second All-Star team in 1935-36 as well as 1936-37. He played his final game for the New York Rangers on March 19, 1939 against the Toronto Maple Leafs.

In 1940 he played 49 games split between the Indianapolis Capitals and Providence Reds, and then 51 games with the Pittsburgh Hornets in 1941-42, scoring 13 goals along with 23 assists.
