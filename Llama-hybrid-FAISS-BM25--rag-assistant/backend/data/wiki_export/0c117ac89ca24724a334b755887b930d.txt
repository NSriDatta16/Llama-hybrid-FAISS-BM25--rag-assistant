The 12th-century Church of St Bridget is now in the combined Parish of Ewenny and St Brides Major, within the Diocese of Llandaff. For much of its history it was a Parish in its own right, co-inciding with the civil parish and more recently community boundaries. Until the Reformation the Church was, along with Ewenny Priory and other local churches, a possession of Gloucester Abbey, both having been given to the abbey in 1141. It contains a number of medieval tombs and memorials, but the building itself was heavily restored by Egbert Moxham in 1851.

There were two non-conformist Chapels within St Brides Major village. Bryn Sion Calvinistic Methodist Chapel, Penylan Road, was built in 1859, replacing a building of 1824.  It closed in 1987 and is now a house. Horeb Baptist Church, Ewenny Road, was built in 1863 and closed in 2003.  The building was sympathetically restored during 2019 and is now a hairdressers and beauty clinic.
