Minor Detail were an Irish new wave and synthpop band from Blackrock, Dublin, Ireland.

Career
Minor Detail was headed by brothers John and Willie Hughes. Their lyrical themes were positive and covered topics such as romance and peace. Their self-titled debut album was produced by Bill Whelan (later of Riverdance fame), and they became one of the first Irish bands to secure a recording contract with an American label. However, they were short-lived, splitting in 1984, but reunited for a brief period in 1986â€“87. In 1991, John Hughes would discover the Corr siblings during an audition for The Commitments and would soon become the Corrs' manager.
