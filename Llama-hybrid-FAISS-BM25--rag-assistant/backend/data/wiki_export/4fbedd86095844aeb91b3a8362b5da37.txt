Trevor G. Browne High School (also known as Trevor Browne High School) is part of the Phoenix Union High School District in Phoenix, Arizona.

History 
The plans for the school were approved by the school board in April 1970. Guirey, Srnka, Arnold & Sprinkle were the architects of the school. The campus featured a revolutionary design with movable walls and multi use spaces. M. M. Sundt Construction Company was the general contractor who built the school. The school began to accept students in the fall of 1972, and was named after Trevor Goff Browne, a Canadian-born man who taught at Harvard Medical School. Browne, who died in 1977, donated the land on which Trevor Browne High School was built.
