The Calrossy Anglican School (Calrossy) is an independent, Anglican, day and boarding school for boys and girls and incorporates a primary and preschool. Calrossy is located in East Tamworth, a suburb of Tamworth, a city in the New England region of New South Wales, Australia.

Established in 1919, the school has a non-selective enrolment policy, and caters for 470 secondary girls and 155 secondary boys and 375 primary students. With 180 boarders, Calrossy has one of the largest boarding enrolments among New South Wales boarding schools. In 2006, Calrossy joined with William Cowper Anglican Boys High School and William Cowper Primary School, to create the Calrossy Anglican School. The school now incorporates a secondary day and boarding school for girls (Calrossy), a secondary day and boarding school for boys, a co-educational prep and primary school, and a co-educational preschool, with total enrolments of 1000.

The school is affiliated with the Junior School Heads Association of Australia (JSHAA), the Australian Boarding Schools' Association (ABSA), the Alliance of Girls' Schools Australasia (AGSA), and is an affiliate member of the Association of Heads of Independent Girls' Schools (AHIGS). Calrossy is administered by the Anglican Diocese of Armidale.

History 
The school was named as the Tamworth Church of England Girls' School (TCEGS), by a group of parishioners from St John's Parish Church, Tamworth, led by the Vicar, Canon Rupert Fairbrother with seventeen foundation students. The school occupied a site close to the church in East Tamworth. Lessons were held in the church hall, and the boarding house was an old building on the corner of Brisbane and Carthage Streets.

The school moved to its present site in Brisbane Street in 1923, to a property formerly owned by John Patterson. His home, the centrepiece of the new school, was named 'Calrossy' after his family property in Scotland. The school adopted the name in 1969.

TCEGS remained a parish school until 1936, when it was taken over by the Diocese of Armidale and administered in a similar way to the diocese's other schools, The Armidale School and the New England Girls' School.

William Cowper Anglican (Primary) School opened, with Ann Brown as Principal in 1999 on the grounds of Calrossy where the secondary boys' school also started in 2001. 

William Cowper Anglican Secondary Boys' School was opened in 2001. It was in existence from 2001–2005 before amalgamating with the girls school, Calrossy Anglican School to become Tamworth Anglican College (2006–2007). In 2008 the school changed its name to Calrossy Anglican School. The primary school and the secondary boys' school moved to the William Cowper Campus on Moore Creek Road in 2002.

The inaugural Principal of William Cowper Anglican Secondary Boys' School was Mr Nicholas Brown, who resigned at the end of Term 1, 2001.

In 2006, Calrossy joined with William Cowper Anglican Boys High School and William Cowper Primary School, to create the Tamworth Anglican College (TAC), subsequently the school's name was changed to Tamworth Anglican College – Calrossy Campus. The amalgamation created a Pre-school to Year 12 with school, with a co-educational primary school and two single-sex high schools (Secondary Girls and Secondary Boys). Each sub-school has retained its own crest and traditions. In 2007, the name "Tamworth Anglican College" was changed to Calrossy Anglican School. The senior school for girls is now therefore named Calrossy Anglican School – Brisbane Street Campus.
