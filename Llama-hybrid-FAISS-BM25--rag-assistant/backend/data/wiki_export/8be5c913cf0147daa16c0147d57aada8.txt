Eton Racing Boats (commonly referred to as ERB) was a manufacturer of racing boats for rowing, based in Eton, United Kingdom. The company was founded by Eton College, who also funded the construction of the Dorney Lake development.

The company ceased trading on Friday 16 February 2007 due to insufficient profits and stiff competition from cheaper good quality rowing equipment. Eric Sims continues to offer equipment supplies via a separate outlet.

The former company website claimed that "boats from the Eton workshops have frequently won Henley medals and world championships". The firm also manufactured and sold range of accessories and other products for the sport, including outriggers, megaphones, coaching launches and pontoons, as well as providing maintenance services.
