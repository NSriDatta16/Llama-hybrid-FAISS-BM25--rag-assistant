Book series

Novels

The Charmed novels are a series of books that accompany the television series, but follow no strict continuity with the series or each other. The first novel, The Power of Three, was released in November 1999 and is a novelization of the series premiere episode "Something Wicca This Way Comes". All other novels, apart from Charmed Again which documents the events of the two-part episode of the same name, are original stories revolving around the four Charmed Ones and their allies. A total of forty-three novels were written. Ten include Prue and the original line-up of Charmed Ones, whilst the remaining thirty-three feature Piper, Phoebe and Paige. Two other novels, Seasons of the Witch and The Warren Witches, are anthologies of short stories. The final novel, Trickery Treat, was released in January 2008.

In 2015, HarperCollins acquired the rights to publish a second series of Charmed novels from CBS Consumer Products. The first novel, The War on Witches, was published in May 2015 and its narrative is set between the events of Seasons 9 and 10 of the comic book series. It is written by Ruditis, who previously authored Season 9 and edited Season 10, and follows the younger Charmed Ones' reunions with Prue and Cole Turner after their resurrections.

Comic books

The Charmed comic books serve as a continuation of the television series and were originally published by Zenescope Entertainment. The first comic book series, Charmed: Season 9, was released in June 2010 and is set eighteen months after the events of the televised show's final episode, "Forever Charmed." Author Paul Ruditis was the lead writer of the first series and Raven Gregory helped him co-write the first three issues. The second and final comic book series by Zenescope, Charmed: Season 10, debuted at the New York Comic Con during the weekend of October 9, 2014. Pat Shand was the lead writer of the second series while Ruditis assumed the role of editor. In 2017, Dynamite Entertainment acquired the rights to publish a new comic book series titled Charmed: A Thousand Deaths. It was written by Erica Schultz and illustrated by Maria Sanapo.
