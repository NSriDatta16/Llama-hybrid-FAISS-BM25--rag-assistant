History
The station signed on in 1948, and held the call sign KTXN. It ran 1,000 watts during daytime hours only.

On August 28, 1958, the call sign was changed to KOKE. It mostly simulcast the legendary KOKE-FM Country music radio brand in Austin in the 1970s. (An FM sister station 95.5 KOKE-FM, signed on in 1968, not related to today's KOKE-FM 99.7.)

In 1991, it switched to a simulcast of the soft adult contemporary sound on KKMJ-FM, using the call sign KKMJ.

In 1992, the station rebranded as "K-Juice 1370," with the call letters changing to KJCE. KJCE's new format originally consisted exclusively of satellite-delivered soul oldies.  In 1996, under new program and news director Benjamin Bryant, it switched to a mix of satellite-delivered urban adult contemporary music with limited local news, public service, and sports programming.  At that point, KJCE first began broadcasting Texas A&M football games. In 1997, Bryant received two Paul R. Ellis Media Awards from the American Heart Association of Texas for KJCE's coverage of heart disease and stroke risk in Austin's most vulnerable communities.

KJCE became a talk station in 2002. The station formerly simulcast on the HD3 subchannel of sister station KKMJ-FM "Majic 95.5" as well as FM translator K242CC at 96.3Â MHz. On July 29, 2013, both outlets dropped KJCE.  In 2015, KJCE's talk programming returned to the HD2 subchannel of 95.5 KKMJ.
