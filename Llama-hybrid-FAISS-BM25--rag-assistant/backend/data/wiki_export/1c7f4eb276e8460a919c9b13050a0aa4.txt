Billy Guy Anderson (February 17, 1941 â€“ April 11, 1996) was an American football quarterback who played professionally in the American Football League (AFL).

College career
Anderson played college football at the University of Tulsa. He established school and NCAA records as the starting quarterback in 1965. He led the nation in passing and total offense while setting school records for most passing yards in one game (502), most passing yards in a season (3,464), most completions for a game (42) and most passing attempts in one game (65). Completing 58 percent of his passes, he had 30 touchdown passes in 1965. He was an All-Missouri Valley Conference performer his senior season.

In the 1960s, Tulsa took the collegiate passing game to a level never seen before. The Hurricane averaged nearly 318 yards in 1964, and increased that average to 346 yards a year later. Anderson helped revolutionize the way college football was played.

Billy Anderson threw the first touchdown pass in Astrodome history - to Galena Park's Howard Twilley - when Tulsa defeated University of Houston 14-0 in 1965, the first football game ever played in the Dome. Anderson led the nation in passing that year.
