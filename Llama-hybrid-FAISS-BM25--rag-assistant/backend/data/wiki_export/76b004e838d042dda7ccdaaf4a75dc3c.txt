Stowgate is a small settlement in the South Kesteven district of Lincolnshire, England. It is situated approximately  north-east from Deeping St James, and is linked to the Deepings group of villages.

Stowgate contains very few houses, most of which are farmhouses. The settlement grew up around Stowgate Farm – the farmhouse of which still exists – which was divided into a number of smaller farms intended to provide housing and agricultural land for those who contributed to war effort. These farms still exist.

Stowgate contains a Bernard Matthews turkey farm.
