Inside Carolina magazine was founded by David Eckoff in early 1994 as a monthly magazine. Later that year, Eckoff added a web site to go along with the print publication. Some of the early writers for IC included Darcy Miller, Bob Heymann, Darrell Lucus, Adam Lucas, Thad Williamson, Andrew Jones and Michelle Donahue Hillison. Eckoff sold the publication to TheTarPit owner Buck Sanders in late 2000, and Sanders merged it with UNCBasketball.com (named by the November 27, 2000 edition of ESPN Magazine as the top college hoops site) in 2001. Ben Sherman, creator of UNCBasketball.com, now serves as editor in chief of the website. The editorial staff includes Tommy Ashley, Michelle Hillison and Greg Barnes as well as photographer Jim Hawkins.  The publication is fully credentialed by UNC, the ACC and the NCAA.
