U.S. Masters Swimming (USMS), founded in 1970, is a nonprofit membership national governing body for masters swimming, an organized program of swimming for adults. The program began when the first National Masters Swimming Championships were held on May 2, 1970 at the Amarillo Aquatic Club pool with a few dozen swimmers. Captain Ransom J. Arthur, M.D., a San Diego Navy doctor, had persuaded John Spannuth, President of American Swimming Coaches Association, that the event would give older swimmers (ex-competitors and beginners) a goal for keeping physically fit. Arthur's mission of encouraging adults to improve fitness through swimming has grown over the years into a nationwide organization that currently includes more than 60,000 adult swimmers.

Members participate in a variety of ways ranging from lap swimming to international competition. The program is organized by USMS, which provides organized workouts, competitions, clinics, and workshops for adults aged 18 and over. Programs are open to all adult swimmers (fitness, triathlete, competitive, noncompetitive) who are dedicated to improving their fitness through swimming. To be eligible for USMS competition, swimmers must sign up with USMS and obtain a membership card for a fee that varies by location.

Competition 
Although there are more than 500 local and regional competitions around the country that are available for Masters swimmers to participate in, less than half of the members compete in these meets. However, for those that do, there are a variety of events to choose from including pool meets, ePostal swims, and open water swims. Two national championship pool meets are held each year, which help to determine the USMS Top 10â€”the top 10 fastest times in the nation in pool meets that are sanctioned or recognized by USMS during the current season and is organized by age, sex and course. The swimmer with the fastest time in the USMS Top 10 in each age group, event, and course, plus the age group winners of the long distance events are further named to the All-American list. In each age group, the swimmer with the most All-American titles is named an All-Star. All of the results from the competitions, as well as a record of the USMS Top 10, All-Americans and the All-Stars are recorded and maintained on the web in the USMS Archives.

History
Captain Ransom J. Arthur, a San Diego Navy doctor, had persuaded John Spannuth, President of American Swimming Coaches Association, that the event would give older swimmers (ex-competitors and beginners) a goal for keeping physically fit. In the early 1970s, Spannuth approached American swimmer June Krauser about the need for competitive swimming for adults. With Arthur and Spannuth, she founded USMS. Krauser helped organize the group and drafted its rules. She became known as the "Mother of Masters Swimming."

Krauser was an active competitor in masters swimming from the 1970s through the 2000s. Between 1972 and 2001, she set 154 national records recognized by the USMS.

Spannuth said that Krauser "literally wrote the book when it came to competitive swimming for adults and for the Special Olympics, and did more to kick-start those two programs than anyone will ever know." Masters Swimming Hall of Fame inducted Krauser.
