Adrian Joseph Mariappa (born 3 October 1986) is a professional footballer who plays as a defender for  club Salford City. Born in England, he represents the Jamaica national team.

He progressed through Watford's youth academy, and started playing for the first team in the 2005–06 season. Although primarily a centre back, he spent some of his early professional career at right back due to competition for places in the middle. In his first spell at Watford, he made 247 first team appearances, including 19 in the Premier League. This included a run of 113 consecutive league appearances, the fourth longest streak in Watford's history. Mariappa captained Watford at under-18, reserve and first-team levels, and was the club's vice captain in his final few years at Vicarage Road.

Mariappa accepted his first call up to Jamaica's international team in May 2012. He won his first cap against Guyana later that month, and transferred to Premier League side Reading in July 2012. He made 29 league appearances for the club before joining Premier League side Crystal Palace in September 2013, following Reading's relegation to the Championship.  Returning to Watford before the 2016–17 season, Mariappa made seven league appearances that season.

Club career

Watford

Born in Harrow, Mariappa joined Watford's youth system at the age of eight. At the age of 15 he was initially told he would be released by the club. While in the Watford academy Mariappa trained with athletics and basketball clubs to improve his sprinting and jumping techniques. He captained the club's under-18 side during their FA Youth Cup quarter final against Tottenham Hotspur, and later captained the reserve team.

Mariappa was selected as an unused substitute in Watford's last league game of the 2004–05 season. After signing his first professional contract with the club that summer, Mariappa made his first team debut in a League Cup match against Notts County on 23 August 2005, playing 90 minutes in a 3–1 Watford win. He made another cup start against Wigan Athletic in the 3rd round. During the 2005–06 season he also made three league appearances, including a clean sheet in his first league start, against Hull City on the final day of the regular season. Mariappa did not play any of Watford's play-off games, but was an unused substitute in the final, in which the team won promotion to the Premier League.

Watford started their 2006–07 Premier League campaign at Everton, with Mariappa starting in central defence in place of first-team regular Jay DeMerit. He was substituted at half-time, and, aside from a League Cup appearance against Accrington Stanley, did not make another first-team appearance until December 2006, when in an away match at Newcastle United he came on for the injured James Chambers at right-back. He continued in that position, playing regularly for the rest of the season.

With Watford back in the Championship for 2007–08, Mariappa found himself largely on the substitute bench, making 13 league starts and 3 in other competitions, as Watford again reached the play-offs. By contrast, he started 45 games in all competitions in the 2008–09 season, under the management of Aidy Boothroyd, Malky Mackay and latterly Brendan Rodgers, and scored his first senior goal for Watford in a 3–1 defeat at Wolves on 31 January 2009. At the end of the season he signed a two-year extension to his contract.

In the absence of injured captain Jay DeMerit, Mariappa skippered Watford for the first time on 12 September 2009, in a 1–0 victory at Vicarage Road against Barnsley. He retained the captaincy during DeMerit's absence, and scored his second senior goal in October 2009, on his 100th professional appearance. Watford finished the 2009–10 season 16th in the Championship; Mariappa was the only player to start each of the club's games in the Football League, FA Cup and League Cup. 2010–11 followed a similar pattern to the previous campaign; Mariappa started every game for which he was available, and was one of Watford's six scorers in the team's 6–1 away win against Millwall. He was also appointed as the club's vice captain during the season. However, Mariappa was sent off for the first time in his career on 19 March 2011, in a 2–1 defeat to Middlesbrough. The resulting suspension ended Mariappa's run of 113 consecutive league appearances, the fourth highest in Watford's history.

Mariappa continued to play in the 2011–12 season under new manager Sean Dyche. He was the focus of transfer speculation during the January 2012 transfer window when Watford received a number of bids for him from Premier League clubs. Three bids from Newcastle United were rejected; an offer from Wigan Athletic was accepted, but Mariappa rejected a move. He stayed at the club until the following summer, and his good form saw players and fans vote him 2011–12 Watford Player of the Season.

Both of Mariappa's maternal grandparents are from Jamaica. In 2012 he accepted a call up to the Jamaica squad, for a friendly against Guyana. His first match in an international competition came on 9 June 2012, in a 2–1 World Cup qualifying win against Guatemala.
