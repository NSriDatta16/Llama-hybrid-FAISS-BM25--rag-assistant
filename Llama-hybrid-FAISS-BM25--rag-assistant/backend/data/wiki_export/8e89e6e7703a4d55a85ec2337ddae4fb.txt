Production notes
Having adapted the musical You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown three years prior, Charles Schulz once again opted to adapt the other musical with the Peanuts gang. Schulz had recently utilized many comic strips for The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show. Snoopy!!! The Musical marked the first time Snoopy was voiced by Cameron Clarke: Clarke would go on to voice Snoopy in  This Is America, Charlie Brown and in the World of Snoopy storybooks.

The song "Poor Sweet Baby" was based on the comic strip on April 8, 1973, and the Broadway version song "Hurry up Face" was based on the comic strip on September 17, 1972.

The idea of Lucy mistaking a potato chip for a butterfly was borrowed from 1969's It Was a Short Summer, Charlie Brown.

Stock footage was used for several sequences: 
 kids leaving school in "Just One Person" is from You're Not Elected Charlie Brown and Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown
 Charlie Brown kissing The Little Red-Haired Girl, flying and landing in his bed is from It's Your First Kiss, Charlie Brown
 Peppermint Patty and Charlie Brown talking under the tree in "Poor Sweet Baby" is from There's No Time for Love, Charlie Brown and It's Arbor Day, Charlie Brown

Cameos
 Rerun makes a brief cameo in the song "I Know Now" after Linus upsets him and is confronted by their parents.
 The Cat Next Door appears on screen for the first time, resembling Brutus from the 1977 film Race For Your Life, Charlie Brown.
 The Little Red-Haired Girl, again in the "Heather" version, appears comforting Charlie Brown in the "Poor, Sweet Baby" segment.
