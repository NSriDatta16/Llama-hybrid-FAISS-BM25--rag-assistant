Bobby socks are a style of women's sock, white, ankle-length or collected at the ankle, instead of at full extension up the leg.

The term "bobby sox" indicates the socks are "bobbed" instead of full-length.

The term bobby soxer derives from this type of sock.

They were initially popular in the United States in the 1940s and 1950s, later making a comeback in the 1980s.
