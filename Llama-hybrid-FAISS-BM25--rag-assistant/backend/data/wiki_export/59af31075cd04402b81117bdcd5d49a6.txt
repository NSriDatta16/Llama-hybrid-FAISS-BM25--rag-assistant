James Harry Smith (May 15, 1890 â€“ April 1, 1922) played 75 games of  Major League Baseball between 1914 and 1918, mostly as a catcher.  In all he had 148 at bats, his 27 hits produced one homer and 14 RBI for an average of .182, not sufficient to prolong his career in the big leagues.  He started with the New York Giants, moving to the Brooklyn Tip-Tops for 1915, but he returned mid-way through the season.  He was absent from the big leagues for 1916, starting 1917 with Cincinnati Reds, but after a couple of seasons as a peripheral figure with an average below .200, he disappeared from the big leagues for good.
