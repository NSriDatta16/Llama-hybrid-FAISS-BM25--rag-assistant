Live Phish Vol. 12 was recorded live at the Deer Creek Music Center in Noblesville, Indiana, on August 13, 1996.

The album marked the first time that the songs "Strange Design" and "Sleeping Monkey" had appeared on a commercially released Phish album.

Highlights include a mini-acoustic set of songs from the soon-to-be released, critically acclaimed Billy Breathes album, as well as a 22-minute version of the Phish classic "Mike's Song." Also of note is an exceptional version of the Rift classic "Fast Enough for You," said by many fans to be one of the best versions ever of the reflective ballad.

The show also includes keyboardist Page McConnell performing a solo version of The Wizard of Oz classic "Somewhere over the Rainbow" on a theremin.

Bonus tracks include two songs from the night before at the same venue.
