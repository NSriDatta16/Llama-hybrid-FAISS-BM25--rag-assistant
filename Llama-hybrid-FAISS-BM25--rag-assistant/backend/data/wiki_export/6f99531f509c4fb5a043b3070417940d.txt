Haplogroup N (M231) is a Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup defined by the presence of the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker M231.

It is most commonly found in males originating from northern Eurasia. It also has been observed at lower frequencies in populations native to other regions, including parts of the Balkans, Central Asia, East Asia, and Southeast Asia.

Origins

Haplogroup NO-M214 – its most recent common ancestor with its sibling, haplogroup O-M175 – is estimated to have existed about 36,800–44,700 years ago.

It is generally considered that N-M231 arose in East Asia approximately 19,400 (±4,800) years ago and populated northern Eurasia after the Last Glacial Maximum. Males carrying the marker apparently moved northwards as the climate warmed in the Holocene, migrating in a counter-clockwise path, to eventually become concentrated in areas as far away as Fennoscandia and the Baltic . The apparent dearth of haplogroup N-M231 amongst Native American peoples indicates that it spread after Beringia was submerged , about 11,000 years ago.

Distribution

Haplogroup N has a wide geographic distribution throughout northern Eurasia, and it also has been observed occasionally in other areas, including Central Asia and the Balkans.

It has been found with greatest frequency among indigenous peoples of Russia, including Finnic peoples, Mari, Udmurt, Komi, Khanty, Mansi, Nenets, Nganasans, Turkic peoples (Yakuts, Dolgans, Khakasses, Tuvans, Tatars, Chuvashes, etc.), Buryats, Tungusic peoples (Evenks, Evens, Negidals, Nanais, etc.), Yukaghirs, Luoravetlans (Chukchis, Koryaks), and Siberian Eskimos, but certain subclades are very common in Finland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, and other subclades are found at low frequency in China (Yi, Naxi, Lhoba, Han Chinese, etc.). Especially in ethnic Finnic peoples and Baltic-speaking peoples of northern Europe, the Ob-Ugric-speaking and Northern Samoyed peoples of western Siberia, and Turkic-speaking peoples of Russia (especially Yakuts,,but also Altaians, Shors, Khakas, Chuvashes, Tatars, and Bashkirs). Nearly all members of haplogroup N among these populations of northern Eurasia belong to subclades of either haplogroup N-Tat or haplogroup N-P43.

Y-chromosomes belonging to N1b-F2930/M1881/V3743, or N1*-CTS11499/L735/M2291(xN1a-F1206/M2013/S11466), have been found in China and sporadically throughout other parts of Eurasia. N1a-F1206/M2013/S11466 is found in high numbers in Northern Eurasia.

N2-Y6503, the other primary subclade of haplogroup N, is extremely rare and is mainly represented among extant humans by a recently formed subclade that is virtually restricted to the countries making up the former Yugoslavia (Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia, and Montenegro), Hungary and Austria. Other members of N2-Y6503 include a Hungarian with recent ancestry from Suceava in Bukovina, a Slovakian, a few British individuals, and an Altaian.

N* (M231) 

Y-chromosomes that display the M231 mutation that defines Haplogroup N-M231, but do not display the CTS11499, L735, M2291 mutations that define Haplogroup N1 are said to belong to paragroup N-M231*.

N-M231* has been found at low levels in China. Out of a sample of 165 Han males from China, two individuals (1.2%)  were found to belong to N*.. One originated from Guangzhou and one from Xi'an.

Among the ancient samples from the Baikal Early Neolithic Kitoi culture, one of the Shamanka II samples (DA250), dated to c. 6500 BP, was analyzed as NO1-M214.

N1 (CTS11499, Z4762, CTS3750) 
In 2014, there was a major change in the definition of subclade N1, when LLY22g was retired as the main defining SNP for N1 because of reports of LLY22g's unreliability. According to ISOGG, LLY22g is problematic because it is a "palindromic marker and can easily be misinterpreted." Since then, the name N1 has been applied to a clade marked by a great number of SNPs, including CTS11499, Z4762, and CTS3750. N1 is the most recent common ancestor of all extant members of Haplogroup N-M231 except members of the rare N2-Y6503 (N2-B482) subclade. The TMRCA of N1 is estimated to be 18,000 years before present (16,300–19,700 BP; 95% CI).
Since the revision of 2014, the position of many examples of "N1-LLY22g" within haplogroup N have become unclear. Therefore, it is better to check yfull and ISOGG 2019 in order to understand the updated structure of N-M231.

However, in older studies, N-LLY22g has been reported to reach a frequency of up to 30% (13/43) among the Yi people of Butuo County, Sichuan in Southwest China (, , and ). It is also found in 34.6% of Lhoba people (). N1-LLY22g* has been found in samples of Han Chinese, but with widely varying frequency:
 6.8% (3/44) Han from Xi'an ( and )
 6.7% (2/30) Han from Lanzhou 
 3.6% (3/84) Taiwanese Han 
 2.9% (1/34) Han from Chengdu 
 2.9% (1/35) Han from Harbin 
 2.9% (1/35) Han from Meixian District 
 0% (0/32) Han from Yining City 
Other populations in which representatives of N1*-LLY22g have been found include:
 Hani people (4/34 = 11.8%) 
 Sibe people (4/41 = 9.8%) 
 Tujia people (2/49 = 4.1%) 
 Manchu people (2/52 = 3.8%  to 2/35 = 5.7% 
 Bit people (1/28 = 3.6%) 
 Uyghurs (2/70 = 2.9%  to 2/67 = 3.0%) 
 Tibetan people (3/105 = 2.9%  to 3/35 = 8.6% )
 Koreans (0/106 = 0.0% – 2/25 = 8% (, , and )
 Vietnamese people (2/70 = 2.9%) 
 Japanese people (0/70 Tokushima – 2/26 = 7.7% Aomori) 
 Manchurian Evenks (0/26 = 0.0%  to 1/41 = 2.4%)
 Altai people (0/50 Northern to 5/96 = 5.2% Southern, or 0/43 Beshpeltir to 5/46 = 10.9% Kulada),
 Shors (2/23 = 8.7%) 
 Khakas people (5/181 = 2.8%) 
 Tuvans (5/311 = 1.6%) 
 Southern Borneo (1/40 = 2.5%) 
 Forest Nenets (1/89 = 1.1%) 
 Yakuts (0/215 – 1/121 = 0.8%) 
 Turkish people (1/523 = 0.2%)  In Turkey, the total of subclades of haplogroup N-M231 amounts to 4% of the male population.
 One individual who belongs either to N* or N1* has been found in a sample of 77 males from Kathmandu, Nepal (1/77 = 1.3% N-M231(xM128,P43,Tat)) 

N1(xN1a,N1c) was found in ancient bones of Liao civilization:
 Niuheliang (Hongshan Culture, 6500–5000 BP) 66.7%(=4/6)
 Halahaigou (Xiaoheyan Culture, 5000–4200 BP) 100.0%(=12/12)
 Dadianzi (Lower Xiajiadian culture, 4200–3600 BP)  60.0%(=3/5).

N-CTS4309:  two people identified with this subgroup in Iraq. Very rare.

N1a (F1206/M2013/S11466)

The N1a2-F1008/L666 clade and N1a1-M46/Page70/Tat are estimated to share a most recent common ancestor in N1a-F1206/M2013/S11466 approximately 15,900 [95% CI 13,900 <-> 17,900] years before present or 17,621 [95% CI 14,952 <-> 20,282] years before present.

N1a1 (M46/Page70/Tat, L395/M2080)

All M46 in Yfull database are M178, being a quarter younger than separation from F1139.

The mutations that define the subclade N-M46 are M46/Tat and P105. This is the most frequent subclade of N. It probably arose in a Northeast Asian population, because the oldest ancient samples comply with this genetic profile.

N has experienced serial bottlenecks in Siberia and secondary expansions in eastern Europe . Haplogroup N-M46 is approximately 14,000 years old.

In Siberia, haplogroup N-M46 reaches a maximum frequency of approximately 90% among the Yakuts, a Turkic people who live mainly in the Sakha (Yakutia) Republic. However, N-M46 is present with much lower frequency among many of the Yakuts' neighbors, such as Evenks and Evens. It also has been detected in 5.9% (3/51) of a sample of Hmong Daw from Laos , 2.4% (2/85) of a sample from Seoul, South Korea , and in 1.4% (1/70) of a sample from Tokushima, Japan .

The haplogroup N-M46 has a low diversity among Yakuts suggestive of a population bottleneck or founder effect . This was confirmed by a study of ancient DNA which traced the origins of the male Yakut lineages to a small group of horse-riders from the Cis-Baikal area .

N-Tat has been observed with greatly varying frequency in samples from Sweden. Karlsson et al. (2006) found N-Tat in 44.7% (17/38) of a sample of Saami nomads from Jokkmokk, 19.5% (8/41) of a sample from Västerbotten, 14.5% (8/55) of a sample from Uppsala, 10.0% (4/40) of a sample from Gotland, 9.5% (4/42) of a sample from Värmland, 7.3% (3/41) of a sample from Östergötland/Jönköping, 2.4% (1/41) of a sample from Blekinge/Kristianstad, and 2.2% (1/45) of a sample from Skaraborg.

Lappalainen et al. (2008) found N-Tat in 14.4% (23/160) of a sample from Sweden.

Lappalainen et al. (2009) found N-Tat in 15.4% (4/26) of a sample from Södermanland, 12.5% (3/24) of a sample from Västmanland, 12.1% (4/33) of a sample from Uppsala, 7.8% (4/51) of a sample from Gothenburg, 7.0% (3/43) of a sample from Norrbotten, 6.8% (5/73) of a sample from Skåne, 6.6% (15/228) of a sample from Stockholm, 6.3% (3/48) of a sample from Sydnorrland, 6.3% (2/32) of a sample from Västerbotten, 6.3% (2/32) of a sample from Örebro, 5.9% (3/51) of a sample from Värmland/Dalarna, 5.4% (2/37) of a sample from Östra Götaland, and 5.1% (2/39) of a sample from southeastern Sweden (Kalmar, Gotland, Kronoberg, and Blekinge). They did not find any instance of N-Tat in their samples from Jönköping (0/28), Malmö (0/29), Halland (0/34), or Västra Götaland (0/75).

N1a1a (M178)

The subclade N-M178 is defined by the presence of markers M178 and P298. N-M178* has higher average frequency in Northern Europe than in Siberia, reaching frequencies of approximately 60% among Finns and approximately 40% among Latvians, Lithuanians & 35% among Estonians ( and ).

Miroslava Derenko and her colleagues noted that there are two subclusters within this haplogroup, both present in Siberia and Northern Europe, with different histories. The one that they labelled N3a1 first expanded in south Siberia and spread into Northern Europe. Meanwhile, the younger subcluster, which they labelled N3a2, originated in south Siberia (probably in the Baikal region) .

N-M178 was also found in two Na-Dené speaking Tłı̨chǫs in North America.

Neolithic samples from Baikal area have yielded plenty of yDNA N specimens, and one sample from Fofonovo, Buryatia, 5000-4000 BC is among the first Tat samples in the ancient record.

Earliest samples of N1a1a-L708 were found in Trans-Baikal (brn008, N1a1a1*-L708; brn003, N1a1a1a1*-M2126) between 8,000 and 6,000 YBP. Downstream samples were found in Yakutia (N4b2, N1a1a1a1a*-Z1979) and Krasnoyarsk Krai (kra001, N1a1a1a1a*-L392), between 5,000 and 4,000 YBP.

N1a2 (F1008/L666)

N1a2a-M128 and N1a2b-B523/P43 are estimated to share a most recent common ancestor in N1a2-F1008/L666 approximately 8,600 [95% CI 7,500 <-> 9,800] years before present, 9,200 years before present, or 9,314 [95% CI 7,419 <-> 11,264] years before present.

At least three of six tested male specimens from the Early Neolithic (ceramic-using hunter-gatherer of approximately 7200–6200 years ago) layer at the Shamanka archaeological site near the southern end of Lake Baikal have been found to belong to N1a2-L666.

N1a2a-M128

This subclade is defined by the presence of the marker M128. N-M128 was first identified in a sample from Japan (1/23 = 4.3%) and in a sample from Central Asia and Siberia (1/184 = 0.5%) in a preliminary survey of worldwide Y-DNA variation. Subsequently, it has been found with low frequency in some samples of the Manchu people, Sibe people, Evenks, Koreans, Han Chinese, Hui, Tibetans, Vietnamese, Bouyei people, Kazakhs, Uzbeks, Uyghurs, Salars, Tu, Mongols, the Buzava tribe of Kalmyks, Khakas, and Komis.

A number of a Han Chinese, an Ooled Mongol, a Qiang, and a Tibetan were found to belong to a sister branch (or branches) of N-M128 under paragroup N-F1154*.

A neolithic sample brn002 (~5,940 BP) in Trans-Baikal was discovered to be an early offshoot upstream of N-M128.

As a genetic testing result of Yelü clan, a royal family of the Liao Dynasty and Khitan descents, it was found to belong to N-F1998, a downstream of N-M128.

N1a2b (P43)

Haplogroup N-P43 is defined by the presence of the marker P43. It has been estimated to be approximately 4,000 to 5,500 years old (TMRCA 4,510 years, TMRCA 4,700 [95% CI 3,800 <-> 5,600] ybp, or 4,727 [95% CI 3,824 <-> 5,693] years before present). It has been found very frequently among Northern Samoyedic peoples, speakers of Ob-Ugric languages, and northern Khakassians, and it also has been observed with low to moderate frequency among speakers of some other Uralic languages, Turkic peoples, Mongolic peoples, Tungusic peoples, and Siberian Yupik people.

The highest frequencies of N-P43 are observed among north-west Siberian populations: 92% (35/38) in a sample of Nganasan, 78% (7/9) in a sample of Enets, 78% (21/27) in a sample of Khants, 75% (44/59) in a sample of Tundra Nenets, 69% (29/42) in another sample of Nenets, 60% (15/25) in a sample of Mansi, 57% (64/112) in another sample of Khants, 54% (27/50) in another sample of Nganasan, 45% (40/89) in a sample of Forest Nenets, 38% (18/47) in a third sample of Khants, and 25% (7/28) in a fourth sample of Khants. In Europe, the N-P43 types have their highest frequency of 20% among Volga-Uralic populations. The extreme western border of the spread of N-P43 is Finland, where this haplogroup occurs only at marginal frequency – 0.4%. Yet N-P43 is quite frequent among Vepsas (17.9%), a small Finnic population living in immediate proximity to Finns, Karelians and Estonians.

Haplogroup N-P43 also has been observed with very high frequency (26/29 = 89.7% of a sample from the settlement of Topanov and 19/22 = 86.4% of a sample from the settlement of Malyi Spirin) in samples of Kachins, a Turkic-speaking ethnic group or territorial subgroup of the Khakas people, from Shirinsky District of northern Khakassia. There appears to be a cline through the Sagai (another Turkic-speaking ethnic group that is now considered to be a constituent of the Khakas people), with 46.2% (55/119) of Sagai sampled from Ust'–Es', Esino, Ust'–Chul', and Kyzlas settlements of Askizsky District of central Khakassia belonging to haplogroup N-P43 vs. only 13.6% (11/81) of Sagai sampled from Matur, Anchul', Bol'shaya Seya, and Butrakhty settlements of Tashtypsky District of southern Khakassia belonging to this haplogroup. However, other researchers' samples of Khakas people have exhibited only moderate frequencies of N-P43 or potential N-P43. Derenko et al. (2006) examined a sample of Khakassians (n=53) collected in the settlements of Askiz, Shirinsk, Beisk and Ordzhonikidzevsk districts of Khakass Republic and found that 15 of them (28.3%) belonged to N-LLY22g(xTat). Rootsi et al. (2007) examined a sample of Khakas (n=181) and found that 31 of them (17.1%) belonged to N-P43;  retested 174 of the individuals in this sample and found that 27 of them (15.5%) belonged to the N-B478 (Asian/northern Samoyedic) subclade of N-P43 and 2 of them (1.1%) belonged to the N-L1419 (European/Volga Finnic and Chuvash) subclade of N-P43 for a total of 29 (16.7%) N-P43.

Haplogroup N-P43 forms two distinctive subclusters of STR haplotypes, Asian and European, the latter mostly distributed among Finno-Ugric-speaking peoples and related populations .

N1a2b1-B478
The TMRCA of N-B478 has been estimated to be 3,007 [95% CI 2,171 <-> 3,970] years before present. It is one of the most prevalent Y-DNA haplogroups among indigenous populations of northwestern Siberia: 69.0% (29/42) Nenets, 50.0% (25/50) Nganasan, 22.2% (12/54) Dolgan from Taymyr, 7.0% (3/43) Selkup, 1.6% (1/63) Ob-Ugrian. It is also quite prevalent among populations of Central Siberia, Southern Siberia, and Mongolia: 17.9% (17/95) Tuvan, 15.5% (27/174) Khakas, 13.0% (6/46) Tozhu Tuvans, 8.7% (2/23) Shor, 8.3% (2/24) Even, 8.2% (5/61) Altaian, 5.3% (3/57) Evenk, 5.0% (19/381) Mongol, 4.9% (3/61) Sart-Kalmak (partial descendants of Oirat Mongols in Kyrgyzstan), 4.2% (9/216) Yakut, 2.1% (1/47) Torgut (Mongolia), 1.4% (1/69) Derbet (Kalmykia), 0.9% (1/111) Buryat. A geographically outlying member has been found in a sample of Chuvash (1/114 = 0.88%).

Karafet et al. (2018) observed N-P63, which appears to be roughly phylogenetically equivalent to N-B478, in 91.2% (31/34) Nganasan, 63.8% (30/47) Tundra Nenets, 42.7% (35/82) Forest Nenets, 14.0% (8/57) Dolgan, 7.0% (9/129) Selkup, 3.3% (3/91) Evenk, 2.7% (2/75) Mongol, 2.6% (2/78) Komi, 2.5% (2/80) Buryat, and 2.0% (2/98) Altai Kizhi. This haplogroup was not observed in samples of Yukaghir (0/10), Koryak (0/11), Teleut (0/40), Ket (0/44), Yakut (0/62), or Khanty (0/165) populations.

N1b (F2930)
Haplogroup N1b has been predominantly found in the Yi people, a Tibeto-Burman speaking ethnic group in southwestern China who originated from ancient Qiang tribes in northwestern China. However, it also has been found in people all over China and in some samples of people from Poland, Belarus, Russia, Mongolia, Korea, Japan and Vietnam.

N2 (Y6503) 

N2 (Y6503/FGC28528; B482/FGC28394/Y6584) – a primary branch of haplogroup N-M231, is now represented mainly by a subclade, N-FGC28435, that has spread probably some time in the first half of the second millennium CE and that has been found in individuals from Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Turkey (Istanbul).

N-Y7310 (or N-F14667) subsumes N-FGC28435 and likewise probably descends from a common ancestor who has lived some time in the first half of the last millennium. However, members of N-Y7310(xFGC28435) exhibit a greater geographic range, including an individual from Rostov Oblast of Russia and a Romanian Hungarian individual with ancestry from Suceava, Bukovina.

Other branches of N-P189 include members from Turkey, Russia (Moscow Oblast), France (Charente-Maritime), and England (Devon). The most recent common ancestor of all the aforementioned extant N-P189 lineages has been estimated to be 4,900 (95% CI 5,700 <-> 4,100) years before present. An archaeological specimen attributed to the Botai culture of northern Kazakhstan and dated to the latter half of the fourth millennium BCE belongs to N-P189*, being basal to present-day European members of N-P189.

Lineages that belong to N-Y6503(xP189) and are only distantly related (with a time to most recent common ancestor estimated to be greater than 10,000 years before present) to the aforementioned members of N-P189 have been found in an individual from the present-day Altai Republic and probably also in an archaeological specimen attributed to the Iron Age Mezőcsát culture of what is now Hungary (approx. 2,900 years before present) and in an archaeological specimen attributed to the Kitoi culture of ceramic-using foragers of the area around Lake Baikal (approx. 6,700 years before present).

Ancient peoples 
A sample excavated at the Houtaomuga site in the Yonghe neighborhood of Honggangzi Township, Da'an, Jilin, China dating back to 7430–7320 years ago (Phase II of the Early Neolithic) has been found to belong to Y-DNA haplogroup N and mtDNA haplogroup B4c1a2. This sample is autosomally identical with the Neolithic Amur River Basin populations, of which Nivkh people are the closest modern representative. As the paper detected this ancestry in terminal Pleistocene USR1 specimen in Alaska, it is therefore, postulated that there was gene flow from Amur to America of a population belonging to a hypothetical Chukotko-Kamchatkan–Nivkh linguistic family.

N has also been found in many samples of Neolithic human remains exhumed from Liao civilization in northeastern China, and in the circum-Baikal area of southern Siberia. It is suggested that  yDNA N, reached southern Siberia from 12 to 14 kya. From there it reached southern Europe 8-10kya.

History of phylogenetic nomenclature

Prior to 2002, there were in academic literature at least seven naming systems for the Y-Chromosome Phylogenetic tree. This led to considerable confusion. In 2002, the major research groups came together and formed the Y-Chromosome Consortium (YCC). They published a joint paper that created a single new tree that all agreed to use. Later, a group of citizen scientists with an interest in population genetics and genetic genealogy formed a working group to create an amateur tree aiming at being above all timely. The table below brings together all of these works at the point of the landmark 2002 YCC Tree. This allows a researcher reviewing older published literature to quickly move between nomenclatures.

Sources
The following research teams per their publications were represented in the creation of the YCC Tree.

Unreliable mutations (SNPs and UEPs)

The b2/b3 deletion in the AZFc region of the Y-chromosome appears to have occurred independently on at least four different occasions. Therefore, this deletion should not be taken as a unique event polymorphism defining this branch of the Y-chromosome tree .
