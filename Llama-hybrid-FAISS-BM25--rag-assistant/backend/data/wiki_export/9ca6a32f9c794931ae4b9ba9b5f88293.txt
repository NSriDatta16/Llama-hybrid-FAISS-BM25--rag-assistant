Liverpool High School (LHS) is a comprehensive New York public high school located on Wetzel Road in Liverpool, northwest of the city of Syracuse in the Liverpool Central School District, serving ninth to twelfth grade students. It is the only high school within the district, and is the successor to Liverpool Middle School, Soule Road Middle School, Chestnut Hill Middle School, and Morgan Road Middle School. The school is governed under the authority of the New York State Education Department, whose standardized examinations are designed and administered by the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York.

Liverpool High School Annex
The Annex was one half of Morgan Road School, which housed grade nine; the other half hosts the Morgan Road Elementary School. A faculty-led initiative in 2007 led to the re-branding of the school as "LHX" - an acronym of Liverpool High School Annex.  This was done to highlight the fact that the Annex was part of Liverpool High School, yet also a distinct educational environment. The Annex closed in 2021 to become Morgan Road Middle School, and moved the freshmen to the main building.

Renovation
Liverpool High School is a part of the Liverpool Central School District capital project to renovate and improve buildings in the district. The project was approved by voters on March 10, 2016, and allocates $39,481,107 to district-wide improvements. Modifications to the LHS main building will include relocation of the main entrance, expansions to the auditorium, offices, gymnasium, various art rooms, and the band, orchestra and choral rooms, as well as replacement and upgrades to the building utilities.  While renovations are underway, classes that are usually held in the areas under construction are being held at Wetzel Road Elementary School, a past elementary school within a short walking distance of LHS that was closed down after the 2009-2010 school year.

Academics

Curriculum
Liverpool High School offers more than 150 different courses in English, Social Studies, Mathematics, Science, Languages Other Than English, Art, Music, Family & Consumer Science, Health, Business, Technology, and Physical Education. Workforce Preparation Programs are available through Onondaga-Cortland-Madison Board of Cooperative Education (BOCES). The school focuses on graduating all students with the minimum of a Regents Diploma, but some may also graduate with a less advanced local diploma. The Regents Diploma with Advanced Designation may be achieved with extended studies in a foreign language.

Though the curriculum is developed and sanctioned by the New York State Department of Education, and classes are developed to prepare students to achieve success on the required Regents Examinations, most core courses offer one or two components that explore more advanced topics. The school not only offers standard level Regents courses (Academic level), but also offers more advanced Advanced Placement (AP), College-credit (College), and Honors (H) courses. The criteria used in placing students in the instructional levels are classroom performance, teacher and counselor recommendations, standardized test scores, and individual student preferences. Advanced students may begin earning high school credits in middle school through an accelerated program in mathematics and/ or foreign language.

The school uses a 100 grade point scale, as opposed to the much more common 4.0 scale. The rank in class is established by placing students in descending order from highest to lowest according to their weighted grade point average. The weighted grade point average is calculated with Advanced Placement (AP) courses and College Level courses weighted at 1.1 and Honors Level courses weighted at 1.05.
