From Yahoo news report:
Speaking to the International Conference on Emerging Infectious Diseases in Atlanta, Garten said the pool of H5N1 candidates with the potential to cause a human influenza pandemic is getting more genetically diverse, which makes studying the virus more complex and heightens the need for increased surveillance. "As the virus continues its geographic expansion, it is also undergoing genetic diversity expansion," Garten said in a statement.
