Cannon School is an independent, nonsectarian, college preparatory institution serving students in junior kindergarten through grade 12. The school enrolled approximately 1040 students for the 2022–2023 school year. Cannon School is located in Concord, North Carolina in Cabarrus County, on a  campus on Poplar Tent Road near the Cabarrus–Mecklenburg county line. The school is fully accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and the Southern Association of Independent Schools.

History 
Cannon School was founded in 1969 as Cabarrus Academy. The school was located in the historic downtown Concord residence of local textile entrepreneur J.W. Cannon. The school initially served students in grades 1-10. Upon opening, the school had 75 all white students, but neither a cafeteria nor a gymnasium. Tuition was $750. Headmaster Herman Butrick claimed that black students would have been admitted, but non applied. In 1970, the IRS found that the school had a non-discriminatory admissions policy and was thus eligible for tax-exempt status.

In 1994 the school relocated to its current  campus in the northwestern corner of Cabarrus county, and in 1998 the Cabarrus Academy was renamed Cannon School.

Originally a school for junior kindergarten through eighth grade, Cannon expanded throughout the 1990s and graduated its first senior class in 2002. (Note: First "new" senior class. As Cabarrus Academy, the school did graduate seniors in its earlier years.)

Academics 
Cannon School offers Mandarin Chinese classes in the Middle School and Upper School. Cannon School has developed a sister school exchange program with Tianli International School of Luzhou, Sichuan, China. Each year, since 2004, local families host Chinese students and teachers in their homes during week-long visits to Cannon School and other points of interest around the Carolinas.
