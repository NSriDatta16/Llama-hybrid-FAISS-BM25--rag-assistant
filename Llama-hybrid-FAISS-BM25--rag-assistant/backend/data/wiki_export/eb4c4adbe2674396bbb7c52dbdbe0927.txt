Atom Seed was an English hard rock band, popular in the early 1990s. They released their debut album, Get in Line, in 1990.

History
Atom Seed were formed in early 1989 in London, England, after former Zoodoll guitarist Simon James and bassist Chris Huxter met with singer Paul Cunningham and the Iranian-born drummer Amir. After recording a demo and playing a handful of gigs, Huxter left in late 1989 and was replaced by Chris Dale on bass. The band toured the UK constantly as headliners and also supporting Wolfsbane and Red Hot Chili Peppers. Their debut EP was released in early 1990, followed in 1991 by the album Get in Line on FM Revolver Records. Amir was replaced by Jerry Hawkins (formerly of Metal Monkey Machine) on drums before the band's debut European tour. They were signed to London Records for the Dead Happy EP in 1992, but were dropped from the label and split up soon after, with an unreleased album, Hard Sell Paranoia, shelved.

Following the dissolution of Atom Seed, Chris Dale went on to perform, record, and write for Iron Maiden's Bruce Dickinson. Dale now plays for the British heavy metal band Tank as well as his own pop rock band, Sack Trick. Simon James formed the band Moko Jumbi, recording an album for A&M Records in 1996 which remained unreleased after the label folded. In 2006, he released an acoustic album The Old Straight Track for Stovepony Records under the name 'Onions', launched at the Green Man Festival.
