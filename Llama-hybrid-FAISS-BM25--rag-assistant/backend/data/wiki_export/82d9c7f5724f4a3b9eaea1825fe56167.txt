Thomas Fisher Unwin (24 January 1848 – 6 February 1935) was an English publisher who founded the publishing house of T. Fisher Unwin.

Early life and career
Thomas Fisher Unwin was born on 24 January 1848 in 33 Lowgate Hill, London. He was the son of the printer Jacob Unwin (1802–1855), who was the founder of the firm Unwin Brothers and of the Gresham Press, and of his wife, Isobel, (née Hall). He attended the City of London School and then worked for the London publishing firm, Jackson, Walford, and Hodder (which was the predecessor firm of Hodder & Stoughton).

In 1882, he founded his own publishing firm, T. Fisher Unwin. In 1885, he started a British book series titled The Story of the Nations. It reflected his views, which were liberal and internationalist; and also his wife's interest in abolitionism and suffragism. The series was published in the USA by G. P. Putnam, though not in identical form.

In 1896, he jointly founded The Publishers Association.

Personal life
He was married to Jane Cobden, the Liberal politician, daughter of the Victorian reformer and statesman Richard Cobden.

His nephew, Stanley Unwin, founded the publishing firm George Allen and Unwin.

He died at his home in Midhurst, Sussex on 6 February 1935.
