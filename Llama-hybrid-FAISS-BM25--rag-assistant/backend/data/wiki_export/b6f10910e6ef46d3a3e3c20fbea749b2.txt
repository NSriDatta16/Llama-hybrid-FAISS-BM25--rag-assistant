EÄŸil is an ancient city 50Â km away from DiyarbakÄ±r with many ancient forts and caves dating to the time of the Armenian kingdom of Sophene. It is identified with Carcathiocerta, the capital of the Kingdom of Sophene, and the ancient Armenian religious center of Angegh-tun (AngeÅ‚tun).e Romans, the Byzantines, the Abbasids, the Seljuks and the Ottoman Empire.  

In 2018 parts of a village re-emerged in EÄŸil in the Ã‡akÄ±rÃ¶ren neighbourhood, after the Dicle Dam suffered water level decrease due to a burst of one of the gates. It is also the location of a supposed tomb of Elisha, which is located in the Kale neighborhood of EÄŸil.

History 

During the Bronze Age, the city was known as Ingalawa by the Hittites. Most scholars identify EÄŸil with the ancient city of Carcathiocerta. The city, with its strategic location overlooking the west bank of the Tigris, is the oldest in the region, with remains dating back to the Assyrian and Hellenistic periods. Later on, the city was known in Armenian as AngÅ‚, capital of the district of AngeÅ‚tun, which was known as Ingilene in Greco-Roman sources. It was part of the larger province of Sophene. Armenian sources described AngÅ‚ as housing "the tombs of the former kings of Armenia", apparently taking the rulers of Sophene as a branch of the Armenian kings' dynasty. The rock-cut tombs still exist today at EÄŸil.
