IPO is a station on Line D (yellow line) of the Porto Metro, Portugal.

The station is at the northern end of the University of Porto campus and is named after the nearby  Instituto Português de Oncologia (Portuguese Oncology Institute).

Although Line D opened in 2005, the IPO and Hospital de São João stations did not open until March 2006. The Escola Superior de Enfermagem, a nursing school, objected to the new line because of safety concerns from the trains running near the entrance of the school.  The sidewalk was set back and a traffic light was placed at the intersection to reduce the risk of accidents between trains and cars. The opening extended Line D to Hospital de São João station.

Before this time the line terminated at the preceding Pólo Universitário station. The line operates as a ground-level tram at this station.
