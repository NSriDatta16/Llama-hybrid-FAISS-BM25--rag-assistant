Village

The fishing village of Skrova lies on the northern part of the island group.  It exists mostly on the island of Heimskrova, but also includes parts of five other islands, including the northwestern edge of the large islands of Skrova.  The village is connected to the town of Svolvær (also in Vågan Municipality) and the village of Skutvika (in Hamarøy Municipality on the mainland) by regularly scheduled ferry routes.  The village has a population (2017) of 182, with nearly all the residents living in the village and the rest of the island group being virtually uninhabited.

The village gained privileged trading rights in 1760, and for a long time, it was the largest fishing village in Lofoten.
