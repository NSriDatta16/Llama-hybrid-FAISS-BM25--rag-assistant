South Park: Chef's Luv Shack is a 2D game show-style party video game and is a sequel to the 1998 video game South Park, itself based on the American animated sitcom of the same name. Developed by Acclaim Studios Austin and published by Acclaim Entertainment, it was released in 1999 for the Dreamcast, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation and Nintendo 64. Its gameplay involves playing minigames and the ability to play against other players in a challenge for the most points. It also involves trivia questions about South Park and other topics.

Chef's Luv Shack was met with mixed reviews. It is the second of three South Park video game titles developed by Acclaim after South Park in 1998 and preceding South Park Rally in 2000.

Gameplay 

In the game, the player takes the role of one of four characters: Eric Cartman, Kenny McCormick, Kyle Broflovski, or Stan Marsh in a game show hosted by Chef. The game intermittently switches between questions and mini-games, with a mini-game preceding every three questions. Players score points by correctly answering questions and mini-game ranking. Players lose points for questions answered incorrectly. The game is exclusively multiplayer; when played by one player, there is no AI, so that player always wins, even with a negative score. Players have the option to "shaft" (pass on) a question to another player after opting to answer the question. The "shafted" player can then pass the question on again or choose to answer the question. When "shafting", a question will always be answered by the last player to be "shafted".

Despite Chef's Luv Shack appearing on all the major home gaming consoles at the time, the only instance of the game taking advantage of the then-modern hardware is the up-to-four player multiplayer game featured in the Nintendo 64 and Sega Dreamcast versions. The PlayStation version supports four players with an adapter, and the PC version allows 2 players to play with a keyboard and 2 more players to play with Joysticks.

Reception 

The Dreamcast and Nintendo 64 versions received mixed reviews, while the PC and PlayStation versions received unfavorable reviews. Blake Fischer of NextGen said of the Dreamcast version, "If you've already burned out on YDKJ, and you need some more game-show luvin', this is your only option, so you're stuck."

The Enforcer of GamePro said of the N64 version in one review, "If you're a fan of the show – which you almost have to be to answer a majority of the questions – you'll have a lot of fun with Luv Shack. Its whimsical comic take on the series makes for a fun time on a rainy Saturday afternoon." In another GamePro review, Scary Larry said that the same console version "will remain one of those few games that dedicated fans enjoy and deserve, and everyone else should avoid. There's no Luv here." Nash Werner said of the PC version, "So we're left with another South Park game that falls into the 'could've been better' category. Fans of South Park will love the audio quality and voice-overs done by Isaac Hayes. Pick it up if you must own everything South Park--it's fun for a few days." Tim Weaver of N64 Magazine gave it 83%, calling it "a triumph of simplicity and design, and offers a significantly different playing experience to Mario Party."
