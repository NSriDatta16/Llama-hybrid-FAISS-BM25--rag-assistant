Jacen Burrows (born September 11, 1972) is an American comic book artist best known for his work on various books from Avatar Press and Marvel Comics.

Career
Burrows graduated from Savannah College of Art and Design in 1996 with a degree in Sequential Art and Illustration.

He started his career providing illustrations for role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons and Star Wars.

He broke into comics working as a cover artist for Avatar Press titles such as Snowman: Dead and Dying, Threshold, Quantum Mechanics and Secrets of the Ravening, for which he also did interior work. In 1998 he pencilled the King Zombie series for Caliber Press.

In 2000 he started collaborating with writer Warren Ellis on several titles for Avatar Press including From the Desk of Warren Ellis, Dark Blue, Scars, Bad World and Bad Signal. For Avatar Press he also illustrated several adaptations of Alan Moore's prose, such as Magic Words, Writing for Comics and the Lovecraft homages Yuggoth Cultures and Other Growths and The Courtyard. The latter led to him being noticed by Alan Moore himself. The two of them later expanded the saga which had begun in The Courtyard in the series Neonomicon and Providence.

In 2003 Burrows collaborated with writer Garth Ennis for the first time pencilling the war comic 303. They collaborated again in 2007 on the critically acclaimed Chronicles of Wormwood and the following year on the cult classic Crossed. Burrows went back to the Crossed universe for the anthology series Crossed: Badlands, illustrating two arcs written by Ennis and David Lapham and providing several covers.

In 2017 he started working for Marvel Comics, penciling Max Bemis' run on Moon Knight and reuniting once again with Garth Ennis on the Punisher: Soviet mini-series. He will also illustrate Warhammer 40,000:  Marneus Calgar, which will be the first Warhammer comic published by Marvel.

Outside of comics he has done illustration work for several video game companies, including work on Rockstar Games's Grand Theft Auto: Vice City and other computer games.

Influences 
Burrows' influences range from 80s indie creators like Matt Wagner, Tim Truman and Mike Baron, to European artists such as Herg√© and Moebius, and mangaka like Mitsuteru Yokoyama and Osamu Tezuka. Outside of comics, directors Stanley Kubrick, Alfred Hitchcock and David Lynch informed his work the most.
