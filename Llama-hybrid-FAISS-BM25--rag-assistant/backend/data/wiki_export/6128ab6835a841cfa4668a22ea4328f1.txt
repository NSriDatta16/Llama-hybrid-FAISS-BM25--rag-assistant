Rüegsau is a municipality in the administrative district of Emmental in the Swiss canton of Bern.

History

Rüegsau is first mentioned in 1139 as Ruxow.  In 1229 it was mentioned as Ruchisowe.  The name comes from ruggere aue, in modern German ruhe Aue, meaning calm floodplain. From the late 13th century until 1528 it was the location of Rüegsau Priory, a Benedictine nunnery.

The oldest trace of a settlement is a neolithic artifact discovered in Rüegsau village.  The first trace of a modern settlement is in the first half of the 12th century when Rüegsau Abbey was probably founded.  While very little is known about the early history of the abbey, it was probably founded by Thüring von Lützelflüh around the same time that he founded Trub Abbey.  It is unknown whether the village grew up around the abbey or was already here when the abbey was founded.

The first known provost appears in the abbey in 1256–99.  There was a Meisterin over the nuns in 1320 and an abbess is first mentioned in 1526–28.  The abbey ruled over a section of the lower Emmental including Rüegsau and Affoltern im Emmental.  In 1454 it had its own seal.  In 1528 the city of Bern adopted the new faith of the Protestant Reformation and in the same year secularized all monasteries including Rüegsau Abbey.  Its goods were used to provide income for the priests of Rüegsau and Lützelflüh, and part of the buildings was used to provide a priest's house. The remaining buildings were gradually dismantled: the last traces of the walls were removed between 1825 and 1831.

The priory church became the village church. It was renovated in 1789–1790 and extended in 1874. Further renovations took place in 1947, 1990 and 1999.

In 1763 a wooden, covered bridge was built over the Emme river connecting Hasle bei Burgdorf and Rüegsau.  In 1881 the Burgdorf-Langnau railroad built a station in Hasle-Rüegsau.  The railroad combined with the expansion of the Emmental road in 1899, brought factories to the formerly rural village.  Today the services sector has surpassed industry, but agriculture and manufacturing are still an important part of the local economy.
