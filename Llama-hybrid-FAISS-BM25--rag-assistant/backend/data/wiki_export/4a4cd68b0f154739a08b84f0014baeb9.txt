Name
The municipality (originally the parish) was first named Sylte. This comes from the old Sylte farm () since the first Sylte Church was built there. The name comes from the genitive case of the word  which means "hunger" or "famine", possibly referring to a swampy area near the farm that is not suitable for farming.

In 1922, the municipality was re-named Tresfjord after the local fjord, Tresfjorden (). The main village in the municipality was located at the head of the fjord and it was also named Tresfjord. The first element comes from the local river Tressa. This name is probably derived from the word  which means "to walk restlessly back and forth" or "to trot about". This likely refers to the strong current in the fjord. The last element is  which means "fjord".
