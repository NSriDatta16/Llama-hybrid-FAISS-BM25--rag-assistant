On March 25, 1923, the club was founded as Associação Sampaio Corrêa Futebol Clube. Abrahão Andrade was the Sampaio Corrêa's first president. The club is named after a seaplane called Sampaio Corrêa II, which visited the city of São Luís on December 12, 1922, and was commanded by two pilots, the Brazilian Euclides Pinto Martins and the American Walter Hinton. On April 26, 1925, the club played its first official match. Sampaio Corrêa beat Luso Brasileiro 1–0. The goal was scored by Lobo.
