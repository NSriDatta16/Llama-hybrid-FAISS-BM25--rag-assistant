Kannan and Sandhya's parents understand that neither Kannan nor Sandhya are interested in marriage and cancels the wedding plans between them. Meanwhile, Gautham develops affection towards Sandhya. Gautham receives frequent phone calls and he believes it to be from Sandhya. Gautham also gets gifts which he also believes to be sent by Sandhya.

One day, Sandhya calls Gautham to a restaurant. Gautham believes that she has called to convey her love but is shocked when she introduces Aravind as her lover. She also says that even Aravind is like Gautham who was not interested in girls but somehow is convinced by Sandhya. Gautham starts worrying and is confused about the happenings as he believed the phone calls and gifts were from Sandhya.

He smashes all those thugs and scolds Maha's father for involving in such activities. Maha's father realises his mistake and apologises. Kannan and Maha's wedding is fixed.

On the day of Kannan and Maha's wedding, Gautham walks alone in the street thinking about his love failure. Suddenly a car comes in front of him and it is Laila.

But Gautham did not reciprocate and avoided her during college.

On the last day of the college, Laila told Gautham that she will keep following him always and will never forget him.
