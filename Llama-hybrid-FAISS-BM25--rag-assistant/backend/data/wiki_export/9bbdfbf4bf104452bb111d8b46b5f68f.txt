The West Twin River, formerly the Neshota River, is an  river in east-central Wisconsin that is a tributary to Lake Michigan. It merges with the East Twin River in the city of Two Rivers, Wisconsin, less than a mile from the lakeshore. The source of the river is in southeast Brown County, near Richard J. Drum Memorial Forest. It is formed by the confluence of the Devils River and the Neshota River. On its course it passes through the unincorporated communities of Kingsbridge and Shoto.

About  upstream from its mouth, the West Twin River is blocked by Shoto Dam, which divides the river into upper and lower reaches. The river below Shoto Dam is broad, shallow, and slow and the water quality is poor, while above the dam it is narrow, deep, and fast-flowing with good to excellent water quality. Shoto Dam creates a  reservoir known as Shoto Lake.
