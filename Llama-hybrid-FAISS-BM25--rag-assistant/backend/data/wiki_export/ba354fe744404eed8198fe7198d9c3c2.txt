Andrew "Andy" Sawyer (born 1952) is a librarian, critic and editor, as well as an active part of science fiction fandom (although he himself has not written much science fiction). He was educated at the Duke of York's Royal Military School, Dover and the University of East Anglia. He is married (to Mary) with two daughters. 

Sawyer had a long career as the Librarian/Administrator of the Science Fiction Foundation Collection in the Special Collections Department in the Sydney Jones Library at the University of Liverpool, as well as Course Director of the University's M.A. in Science Fiction Studies program.
