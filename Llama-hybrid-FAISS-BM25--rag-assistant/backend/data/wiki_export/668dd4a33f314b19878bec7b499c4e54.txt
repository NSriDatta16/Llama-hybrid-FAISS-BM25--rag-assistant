The Body-Hat Syndrome is the third full-length studio album by American hip hop Digital Underground. It was released on October 5, 1993 via Tommy Boy Records. Production was handled by Digital Underground inner production team, the D-Flow Production Squad. The album peaked at number 79 on the Billboard 200 and number 16 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums in the United States.

The album saw rappers Saafir and Clee were added to the line-up. The opening song, "The Return of the Crazy One", which sampled Parliament's "Aqua Boogie (A Psychoalphadiscobetabioaquadoloop)", was released on September 21, 1993 as the lead single before the album's release, and peaked at number 77 on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. The album's second single, an anti-racism cultural awareness politico called "Wussup Wit the Luv", which features a guitar solo from the Funkadelic guitarist Michael Hampton and a verse from 2Pac, made it to number 99 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. Music videos were released for both of the album's singles. This was the last time 2Pac appeared on any Digital Underground release. The album also contains "The Humpty Dance Awards", the group's humorous shout-out to the many artists who sampled "The Humpty Dance" before 1993. Since then the list has grown to over 50 artists.

Critical reception
The Boston Globe called The Body-Hat Syndrome one of 1993's best hip hop albums. Trouser Press wrote: "Musically, Digital Underground is back at the top of its game, but conceptually the group is sounding the retreat".
