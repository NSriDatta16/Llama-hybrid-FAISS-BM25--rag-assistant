Release history
Silage produced a few independent albums before being signed to Sub*Lime Records, including "Holy Cow Food! Bagman!" in 1996 on the Sonfish Records imprint (featuring partial vocals and bass by A-F Records recording artist Ean Elliot Clevenger), Liquid Spatula. after signing onto the artist management company founded by Paul Gunther and Rob Poznanski, Straight Up Music, Silage was quickly signed onto Jive Records/SubLime Records. Silage's first album, Watusi (1997) saw a blend of ska, punk and hip-hop heralded mostly by the Christian underground punk scene. For their next release, Silage modified their sound to bring pop and hip-hop influences to the fore. This new sound produced their more successful album, Vegas Car Chasers (1998). The most notable songs from this album are "Billboards," which garnered the No. 6 spot on Christian music charts in 1998; and "Verb," which was graced by the rap stylings of Knowdaverbs, and achieved No. 7 on the same chart the next year.

Breakup
Silage disbanded in 1999. The band Parkway, also on Essential Records, consisted of Damian Horne and Lance Black. Lance Black plays in the band Celebrity.
