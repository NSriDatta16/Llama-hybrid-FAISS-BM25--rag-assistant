MacroMind was an Apple Macintosh software company founded in Chicago in 1984 by Marc Canter, Jamie Fenton and Mark Stephen Pierce. The company's first product was SoundVision, a combined music and graphics editor. Before the release, the graphics editor was removed, and SoundVision became MusicWorks and the animation creativiy tool VideoWorks (which later became Director). Along with other early programs, MusicWorks and VideoWorks were originally published and distributed by Hayden Software.

In 1988 the company moved to San Francisco, and in 1991 MacroMind merged with Paracomp to become MacroMind–Paracomp, then in 1992 merged with Authorware Inc., forming Macromedia.
