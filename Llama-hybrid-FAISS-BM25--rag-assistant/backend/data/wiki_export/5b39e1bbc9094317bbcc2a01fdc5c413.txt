The No Security Tour was a Rolling Stones concert tour to promote the concert album No Security. The tour spanned over 40 shows in North America and Europe in 1999 and grossed $88.5 million from over a million tickets sold.

History
They decided to do a tour with crowds less than 20,000 after the worldwide enormous Bridges to Babylon Tour with crowds of up to 100,000. The band insisted on smaller venues, with fewer special effects, concentrating on the music and band. The tour supported their new album No Security – a live album of Bridges to Babylon Tour recordings. After rehearsing for twelve days in San Francisco, the No Security Tour began on 25 January 1999 at the Oakland Arena in Oakland, California. The European Leg is mainly consisted of cancelled shows from the Bridges to Babylon Tour and festivals. The stage in the European was similar to the one on the Bridges to Babylon Tour without the B stage. 

In July 2018, the band released "From the Vault: No Security Tour - San Jose '99" on CD/vinyl/DVD/Blu-Ray format.
