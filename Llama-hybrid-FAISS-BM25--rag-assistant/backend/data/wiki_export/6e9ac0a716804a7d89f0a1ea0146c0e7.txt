Loudon Wainwright III (also known as Album I) is the debut album of Loudon Wainwright III. It was released on vinyl in 1970 on Atlantic Records. Like his second effort Album II, the album is a solo acoustic effort. Though his ironic sense of humour is evident, this is an altogether bleaker and more acerbic album ("Black Uncle Remus", "Four is a Magic Number" and "Glad to See You've Got Religion") than most of his 1970s work.

Reflecting another career-long obsession, the first line of the first song on his debut album concerns growing older, a theme which persists to his newest recordings.
