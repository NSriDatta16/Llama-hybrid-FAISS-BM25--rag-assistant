Psi Capricorni, Latinized from ψ Capricorni, is a single star in the southern zodiac constellation of Capricornus. It is a yellow-white hued star that is faintly visible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude of +4.13. The distance to this star is approximately 47.9 light years based on parallax measurements, and it is drifting further away with a radial velocity of +20 km/s. The closest approach to the Sun occurred some 467,000 years ago at a separation of .

This object is an F-type main-sequence star with a stellar classification of F5 V/ It is 1.4 billion years old with 1.4 times the mass of the Sun. The measured rotational velocity of this star is approximately 41 km/s (the Sun has an equatorial rotation velocity of 2 km/s). Analysis of the line profile of the star's spectrum indicates that it is undergoing differential rotation, with the variation by latitude being similar to the Sun. The star has 1.5 times the Sun's radius and is radiating 3.8 times the luminosity of the Sun from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 6,572 K. It displays an infrared excess, suggesting the presence of an orbiting debris disk at a separation of  and a temperature of 60 K.

Chinese name
In Chinese,  (), meaning Celestial Farmland, refers to an asterism consisting of ψ Capricorni, ω Capricorni, 3 Piscis Austrini, and 24 Capricorni. Consequently, the Chinese name for ω Capricorni itself is  (, ).

In R. H. Allen's version, this star represented the battle-axe Yue.
