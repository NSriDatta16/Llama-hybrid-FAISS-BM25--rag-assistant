History
WQQB was formerly WLTM (70s Hits - The Eagle) when it originated in 1993. The original owner was Rollings Communications.  It was a predominantly automated radio station with a live morning show.  In 1994, in order to target an untapped part of the market, the station switched to Urban Contemporary with the moniker Power 96.  It kicked off on a Friday night with an entire weekend of looping the song "I Got The Power" by Snap, before going live on Monday morning.

In 1996, the station switched again to a regular CHR format when it was purchased by Liberty Radio II, Inc. The station (and its sister stations WGKC, WJEK, and WEBX) were sold to AAA Entertainment in 2000. The stations were subsequently purchased by one of the principals of Liberty Radio II, Jim Glassman, under his new company (RadioStar, Inc.) in 2006.

On May 21, 2010, it was announced that RadioStar, Inc. was in the process of selling WQQB to SJ Broadcasting LLC.
