Air transports for heads of state and government are, in many countries, provided by the air force in specially equipped airliners or business jets. One such aircraft in particular has become part of popular culture: Air Force One, used by the President of the United States and operated by the United States Air Force. Other well known official aircraft include the Russian presidential aircraft, the British Royal Air Force VIP aircraft, the French Cotam 001, the Royal Canadian Air Force VIP aircraft, the German Konrad Adenauer, the Royal Australian Airforce VIP aircraft, the Japanese Air Force One, the South Korean Code One, Air India One, the Brazilian Air Force One, and the Israeli Wing of Zion.

Another well-known means of transportation for world leaders is by helicopter. Helicopters are seen as not only cheaper and more cost effective but also more convenient than a motorcade. These include the US President's Marine One, the South Korean Presidential Helicopter, King Charles III's Helicopter, and the Brazilian Presidential Helicopter.

If officials do not have their own aircraft or if their VIP aircraft are under maintenance, they would occasionally hire private jets, in which case a flag/coat of arms decal/sticker is often added on or near the door.

History 

On 15 July 1910, the then Tsar of Bulgaria Ferdinand I became the first head of state to fly in an aircraft during a visit to Belgium.

In 1919, during Paris Peace Conference, senior British politicians including Prime Minister David Lloyd George and Leader of the House of Commons Bonar Law used several Airco DH.4 planes for the cross-Channel trips. Originally designed as bombers, modified planes featured an enclosed compartment for two passengers (cockpit was left open) and a separate luggage compartment. Dubbed Lloyd George's airplane, it was probably one of the first aircraft to be widely used by a political leader.

The British Monarch became the first head of state or government to receive official and dedicated air transport when two Westland Wapitis were delivered to No. 24 Squadron RAF at RAF Northolt for the express purpose of the transportation of the Royal Family in 1928. Between 1929 and 1935, Edward, Prince of Wales, purchased 13 aircraft. Although the RAF maintained at least one of these aircraft for a time, the Prince of Wales eventually became solely responsible for them. When the prince ascended to the throne in 1936 as Edward VIII, The King's Flight was formed as the world's first head of state aircraft unit. This unit initially used the King's own de Havilland DH.89 Dragon Rapide; however, this was replaced in May 1937 by an Airspeed AS.6J Envoy III.

In the United States, prior to World War II, overseas and cross-country presidential travel was rare. Franklin D. Roosevelt was the first president to fly in an aircraft while in office. During World War II, Roosevelt traveled on the Dixie Clipper, a Pan Am-crewed Boeing 314 flying boat, to the 1943 Casablanca Conference in Morocco. The flight covered 5,500 miles in three legs. The first dedicated aircraft proposed for presidential use was a Consolidated C-87 Liberator Express VIP transport aircraft. This aircraft, tail number 41-24159, was re-modified in 1943 for use as a presidential VIP transport, the Guess Where II, intended to carry President Franklin D. Roosevelt on international trips. The Secret Service subsequently reconfigured a Douglas C-54 Skymaster for duty as a presidential transport. This VC-54C aircraft, nicknamed the Sacred Cow, included a sleeping area, radio telephone, and retractable elevator to lift Roosevelt in his wheelchair. As modified, the VC-54C was used by President Roosevelt only once, on his trip to and from the Yalta Conference in February 1945.

In the postwar period, governments around the world have instituted similar provisions for the official aerial transportation of their heads of state and government.

Eight Boeing 737-300s, two 737-700s, and four 737-800s, as well as three Airbus A319s are used for these missions.

A Boeing 747-8I with Air China branding with registration B-2479 was converted and tested for exclusive use as head of state transport around 2016-2017. Although no official photos have been released, it is speculated that the interior is fitted with conference tables, private bedrooms, office suites, and more. Boeing 747s from Air China's cargo subsidiary Air China Cargo are utilised to transport the President's limousines when traveling overseas.

A commercial Air China Boeing 747-4J6 has in the past, been converted for international travel when necessary. The three 747-400 used for this purpose have the following registrations: B-2445, B-2447, B-2472. At least one of them are specially retrofitted during official use and returns to commercial service afterwards; however since 2020, all 747-400s have officially been retired from government use and have since been converted to a permanent commercial airline configuration.

A secondhand Boeing 767-300ER was purchased by the Chinese government for use by the then Chinese leader Jiang Zemin in 2000. An international incident occurred in 2001 when the government claimed it had discovered 27 bugs embedded in the aircraft's interior. The aircraft had been refitted in San Antonio, Texas. It has since been converted back to a normal passenger airliner and sold. A normal Air China Boeing 767 was occasionally used for travel from thereon.

Lower-ranking officials such as the vice-president are transported in an Air China Airbus A330.

In order not to confuse air traffic control between a VIP flight and a normal flight, planes carrying government officials fly under the callsign CA1 to CA99, since all commercial callsigns of Air China are from CA101 and above.

China, Republic of (Taiwan) 

Air transportation for the president or other high-ranking officials of the Republic of China is operated by the Republic of China Air Force using a customized Boeing 737-800 delivered from Boeing in 2001 called the Air Force 3701. This aircraft operates out of Taipei's Songshan Airport and is not usually permitted to fly to countries without diplomatic relations with the ROC. Instead, a Boeing 777 or Airbus A350 operated by China Airlines or Eva Airways will be used, and is the type used for long-haul trips by the president and his/her staff. In addition, another three Fokker 50 turboprop perform the executive jet role for the Vice President of the Republic, premier, and other senior officials.

Excluding the 737s, which fly under a Taiwan Air Force callsign, any commercial plane carrying the president carries its regular callsign, albeit with some changes.

Georgia
Georgian Airways operated a single Bombardier Challenger 850 since 2007 to carry the President of Georgia and government officials. In 2011, a Gulfstream 450 was added to its inventory, possibly replacing the Challenger in its VIP transport role. The planes fly under four-digit Georgian Airways callsigns.

Air India One (AIC001) is the callsign of any aircraft with the President, Vice President or the Prime Minister of India on board. For international travel, two dedicated Indian Air Force Boeing 777-300ERs with registrations K7066 and K7067 which arrived in October 2020 are used. The aircraft are equipped with encrypted satellite communication facilities and advanced navigation aids. The jets are also equipped with an advanced missile warning system, a missile deflecting shield, and electronic countermeasures to provide protection from any ground-based or airborne threat. The aircraft are also equipped with flares and glares to mislead any missile.

For domestic and short distance international travel, three Boeing 737BBJ aircraft are used. The three Boeing Business Jets also used by the President, the Vice President or the Prime Minister were inducted in 2008. These aircraft have a range of  and are fitted with encrypted satellite communication facilities and advanced navigation aids. The jets are also equipped with an advanced missile warning system, a missile deflecting shield and electronic counter measures so as to provide protection from any ground-based or airborne threats.

Other aircraft used by other government officials are four 14-seater Embraer 135s and four 20-seater Embraer 145s.

Apart from these aircraft, there are several helicopters used such as the Mi-8 for carrying the President and the Prime Minister for travelling shorter distances. These aircraft and helicopters are operated by the Indian Air Force.

Indonesia

As Indonesia is a sprawling archipelagic nation, the President of Indonesia frequently needs VVIP air transportation for visiting Indonesian provinces, attending international summits and meetings, and traveling on official foreign visits. Since April 2014, Indonesia has acquired Indonesia One, an aircraft dedicated for the President and their entourage.

Prior to having their own aircraft, the President and Vice President formerly used aircraft chartered from Garuda Indonesia for their air travels. Boeing 737-800s were used for domestic flights and short-range international flights, and Airbus A330-300s were used for most overseas trips and state visits. The Indonesian Air Force also has special VIP squadrons for the President, Vice President and government ministers. These are the 17th Air Squadron () operating Avro RJ85, Boeing 737-400, Falcon 7X and 8X, and Lockheed L-100 fixed-wing aircraft; and the 45th Air Squadron () flying Aérospatiale AS 332L-1 Super Puma helicopters. Both squadrons are based at Halim Perdanakusuma Airforce Base, Jakarta, and almost all presidential flights depart from there.

On 10 April 2014, Indonesia One was delivered to Jakarta. The government claimed the cost of operating its own aircraft would be lower than chartering Garuda aircraft. The aircraft is the Boeing Business Jet variant of the 737-800. The aircraft was designed to meet the minimum safety and security requirements of Indonesia's VVIP air transportation, and includes a modest self-defense system.

In 2020, the Indonesian government chartered a Boeing 777-300ER, registration PK-GIG, from Garuda Indonesia for special use as a presidential aircraft on long-haul flights; the aircraft is painted in a special livery.

The planes when carrying the President use the callsign "IDAF01".

Japan

Japan Air Self-Defense Force operates two Boeing 777-300ER aircraft for use by the Prime Minister, the Emperor, Empress and other members of the Imperial Family.

The aircraft always fly together on government missions, with one serving as the primary transport and the other serving as a backup with maintenance personnel on board. The aircraft are officially referred to as Japanese government exclusive aircraft (日本国政府専用機 Nippon-koku seifu sen'yōki).

Until March 2019, two Boeing 747-400 aircraft were used. The aircraft were constructed at the Boeing factory at the same time as the United States Air Force One VC-25s, though the US aircraft were built to the 747-200 design, while the Japanese aircraft were built to the more contemporary 747-400 design. Both Japanese aircraft were delivered in 1990.

At first, even pilots and flight attendants were from Korean Air, but now, experienced pilots from the Republic of Korea Air Force operate the plane. The lease, renewed in December 2014, lasts until April 2020 and in June 2018, the government requested Korean Air and Asiana airlines to confirm their bids for the next contract. Before the 747-400 was leased, the President used a Boeing 737-300 for short-distance trips and chartered a Boeing 747 aircraft belonging to Korean Air or Asiana Airlines for longer distance trips. In the latter case, the presidential seal would be mounted on the forward passenger door to show that that aircraft is carrying the President.
 
The VIP aircraft, known by the callsign "Code One" (KAF001), has been highly modified with much of the technology onboard being classified. What is publicly known is that the VIP aircraft has infrared vision, secure satellite communication, secure telephone communications, a missile defense system, a missile deflection system, and is made out of a special metal to reduce its radar footprint. It also has had a complete renovation of the interior of the plane, turning the plane into a flying command center so the President can continue his or her duties. When in operation, another aircraft acts as a decoy and a spare.
 
The Air Force also operates one Boeing 737-300 and several CASA/IPTN CN-235s for government travel. The 737, in service since 1983, was used in the country's first presidential visit to Pyongyang in 2000.
 
A Sikorsky S-92, acquired in 2007, is used as a presidential helicopter. It has secure telephone communications, secure satellite communications, Infrared vision, missile defense system and is made out of a special metal that makes it hard to detect on radar systems. Two other helicopters fly with it as decoys and spares. The helicopter is based at Seoul Air Base.

Kyrgyzstan

The government of Kyrgyzstan operated a single Tupolev Tu-154M in 2010, which usually flies under four-digit callsigns "KGC" and "LYN".

Laos
The Lao Government uses a Lao Airlines Airbus A320 (specifically registered RDPL-34199) for government trips, and uses a Xian MA-600 for special squadron flights and private travels. The plane usually flies under the callsign "QV1".

Macau 

The Chief Executive of Macau travels abroad (and to mainland China destinations) on commercial aircraft operated by Air Macau, the de facto flag carrier of the territory. As Macau is a small locale, there is no need for air travel within the territory.

Malaysia

Malaysia's Prime Minister and Yang di-Pertuan Agong (Ruling Monarch) travel aboard aircraft operated by the Royal Malaysian Air Force. For this purpose, an Airbus ACJ319 named Perdana 1 was purchased in 2007, and an Airbus ACJ320 named Perdana 2 in 2015. Other fixed wing aircraft in use include a Dassault Falcon 900, a Bombardier Global Express BD-700, and a Boeing 737-800 BBJ. Helicopters including three S-70 Black Hawks and three S-61A4 Nuris are also used. Also latest addition to the fleet is 9M-JPM Agusta Westland AW139. The planes when carrying the Yang di-Pertuan Agong and/or the Prime Minister fly under the callsign "NR1".

Maldives
The government uses commercial aircraft for travel. In addition, the President has been known to use aircraft from the Saudi Government for religious trips.

Mongolia

The Mongolian President and Prime Minister with other Parliament members use a Boeing 767-300ER or Boeing 737-800 for short to medium range from Government owned by MIAT Mongolian Airlines, which also uses a Mongolian Airlines callsign. In domestic routes, the head of Mongolia and other government officials use Saab 340B or Fokker 50 chartered from Eznis Airways and Aero Mongolia.

Myanmar
The government uses various commercial airliners for travel, particularly airlines based in Myanmar. If that is not available, however, other commercial aircraft or government aircraft from other countries is used. Reports emerged in February 2023 that former president U Thein Sein was planning on buying a plane specifically for VIP government use, choosing a Russian Antonov 148 after sanctions prohibited the acquisition of an Airbus, Boeing, or Embraer aircraft, however this plan was scrapped after the selected plane crashed during a test flight in Eastern Russia, killing all onboard.

Nepal
The present President of Nepal, Prime Minister of Nepal, and other senior government officials travel on regular scheduled commercial flights or chartered flights by either Nepal Airlines or Himalaya Airlines. There is no plane used specifically for VIP operations.

Pakistan

The history of VIP transport in Pakistan dates back to August 1947, where an ex-British Imperial Air Force Vickers VC.1 Viking was acquired to serve as the official transport aircraft for the Governor-General of Pakistan. This aircraft is considered as the first to use the call sign reserved for an aircraft flying Pakistan's head of state or head of government, 'PAKISTAN ONE'. Governor-Generals Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, and Khawaja Nazimuddin used the aircraft until 195, when it was retired. It remained parked at Karachi's Mauripur Airbase and then at a PAF Base in Peshawar. In 1997, the aircraft was disassembled and transported to Karachi and put up for display at the Pakistan Air Force Museum.

In the 1960s and 70s, Presidents Muhammad Ayub Khan, Yahya Khan and Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto used Boeing 707 jetliners of the national flag carrier, Pakistan International Airlines. In the 1980s, President Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq used a Lockheed C-130B Hercules. In the 90s, Prime Ministers Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto used a Boeing 737 for their official trips which was maintained by the Pakistani Government. During the late 1990s, Prime Minister Sharif's government bought a Boeing 737-300 for official use. Initially its role was rotated between serving as a regular commercial aircraft for Pakistan International Airlines and as a VIP transport for the government. However, following a military coup in 1999 the aircraft was permanently transferred to Pakistan International Airlines. The President and Prime Minister then resorted to using two of the airlines's Airbus A310s for official visits, while rare trips were done on regular commercial flights of the airline. In 2007 the Qatari government gifted an Airbus A310-300 of the Qatar Amiri Flight to Pakistan, which was operated for the Pakistan Air Force by Pakistan International Airlines.

Since 2010 two Gulfstream IVs with serial numbers J-755, J-756 and four AW 139 helicopters from the Pakistan Air Force are used by the President and Prime Minister for air travel. The planes all fly under regular Pakistan Air Force callsigns.

Philippines

The 250th Presidential Airlift Wing of the Philippine Air Force is used to transport the President of the Philippines and the First Family. On occasion, the wing has also been tasked to provide transportation for other members of government, visiting heads of state, and other state guests.

The fleet includes: one Fokker F28, which is primarily used for the President's domestic trips and it is also called Kalayaan (Filipino "Freedom") One when the President is on board, one Fokker F27 aircraft, and seven Bell 412 helicopters. In October 2019, the government purchased an Airbus C-295 and a Gulfstream G280 for use by the President and other senior officials which were then delivered in April 2019 and September 2020 respectively. A Hawker 800XP business jet was donated by San Miguel Corporation in May 2022.

For trips outside of the Philippines, the President uses a Learjet 60, Challenger 850 or charters appropriate aircraft from Philippine Airlines. The aircraft with the flight number PR/PAL 001 and callsign PHILIPPINE 001/PILIPINAS 001 is a special aircraft operated by Philippine Airlines to transport the President. These aircraft have the Presidential Seal on the front left door. The Airbus A320 and Airbus A321 are used for short-haul flights, while the Airbus A330-300, Airbus A350-900 and Boeing 777-300ER are used for medium or long haul flights.

The presidential aircraft of President Laurel was a Mitsubishi MC-20. A PAAC Douglas C-47 Skytrain named Lili Marlene was designated as the presidential plane of President Roxas. This aircraft crashed in May 1947, and a few months later was replaced by a C-47 of the newly formed Philippine Air Force. President Quirino used a plane named Laong Laan (Filipino "Kept in reserve for a purpose for a long time.") which during the Garcia administration was renamed Dagohoy. President Magsaysay used two PAF C-47 presidential planes, the Pagasa (Filipino "Hope") and the Mt. Pinatubo. During the Macapagal presidency the Pag-asa was renamed Common Man and was also used by President Marcos Sr. Prior to 1962, the Air Force chartered aircraft from Pan American World Airways as the international services of Philippine Airlines were suspended.

Toward the end of the Marcos Sr. administration, the squadron of presidential aircraft consisted of: one Boeing 707, one BAC One-Eleven, one NAMC YS-11 and one Fokker F28 Fellowship airliner; along with one Sikorsky S-62A, two Bell UH-1N, one Aérospatiale SA 330 Puma and two Sikorsky S-70AS helicopters. President Corazon Aquino used some of these aircraft.

Russia

Russia State Transport Company operates two Ilyushin Il-96-300PU for use of the President of Russia.

At least one of the aircraft was refitted as a VIP transport in 2001 by a British company for a price of GBP 10 million. The aircraft is reported to have an escape capsule, much like the one featured in the film Air Force One.

The Russian government fleet consists of the following aircraft (April 2016):

These aircraft all fly under the callsign "RSD".

Singapore

The President, Prime Minister of Singapore and government officials typically travel on regular scheduled commercial flights, mostly operated by Singapore's flag carrier, Singapore Airlines, or other commercial airlines depending on the location.

However, at APEC Philippines 2015, the Prime Minister travelled on an Australian-registered Gulfstream G550.

Moreover, in case of need, the Singapore Government can count on the Republic of Singapore Air Force to provide airplanes such as the Airbus A330 MRTT and Fokker 50, specially retrofitted in passenger configurations.

Sri Lanka 
The present President, present Prime Minister and government officials typically travel on regular scheduled commercial flights run by SriLankan Airlines, due to their policies.

However, domestic travel for senior government officials and VIPs are provided by the No. 4 (VIP) Helicopter Squadron of the Sri Lanka Air Force using seven Bell 412EPs, Bell 206 or Mil Mi-17. Fixed wing transport aircraft of the Sri Lanka Air Force are used, such as the Y-12, Y-8 or C-130, in case of an emergency.
In post-WW2 times, the de Havilland Heron, Douglas DC-3, de Havilland Dove, Westland WS-51 Dragonfly were used.

Tajikistan
The government currently uses a Boeing 787 from the Mexican government for travel. Previously aircraft from national airline Somon Air were used.

Thailand
The Thai government operates, among others, (through Royal Thai Air Force's 602 Royal Guard Squadron) one Airbus A340-500, one Airbus A319CJ, two A320CJ, and two Embraer ERJ-135LR's as government transports. The A340-500,  and the A319CJ are maintained by Thai Airways International, the Embraer ERJ-135LRs are maintained by Royal Thai Army.

The Royal Thai Air Force's 602 Royal Guard Squadron also operates a Boeing 737-800 for the Royal family flight.

Although available upon their request, members of the royal family usually fly on commercial flights operated by the national carrier, Thai Airways International, when traveling outside of the kingdom.

All planes use a regular Thai Air Force callsign, "RTAF".

Timor-Leste
The government uses commercial aircraft for travel.

Turkmenistan
To transport the President and top officials of the state, Turkmenistan Airlines uses one Boeing 777-200LR of a special configuration (reg: EZ-A777), two Boeing 737-700 (reg: EZ-A007 and EZ-A700), one Bombardier CRJ700 Challenger 870 (reg: EZ-B024) and two Bombardier Challenger 605 (reg: EZ-B022 and EZ-B023).

Any aircraft with the president onboard uses the callsign "UZB1".

Vietnam

Vietnam has no dedicated airframe that is configured and used exclusively for VIP transport. Instead, the state uses general-purpose aircraft owned and commissioned by state-owned operators and armed forces' units for such special missions. It was designated that the General Secretary of the Communist Party, the President, Prime Minister and the Chairman of the National Assembly of Vietnam as well as equivalent representatives of other nations are objects to be served by such so-called "dignitary flights."

A Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner (most commonly the one registered VN-A868) or sometimes an Airbus A350-900 XWB (registered VN-A896 or VN-A898) chartered from Vietnam Airlines is often used for international and long haul flights. For domestic and short haul flights, an Airbus A321 is chartered from the same carrier. The callsign Viet Nam One (VN1/HVN1) is often used when the flight is chartered by the government, especially to transport key people of the Vietnamese state. None of those Vietnam Airlines airframes are reportedly configured specifically for VIP or Head of State transport missions, instead, they are all operating commercial services on daily basis and state leaders use the "casual" business class and are served with standard civilian crews employed by Vietnam Airlines on such VIP flights.

Helicopters of the Vietnam Helicopter Corporation and/or the Vietnam People's Air Force and/or the Vietnam People's Navy can also be used for VIP transport missions.

Europe

Albania
Albanian leaders previously utilised private or commercial aircraft for overseas travel, however, in January 2020, the Turkish government leased an Airbus A319 (TC-ANA) to the Albanian government for VIP transport.

The government of Austria has never operated VIP transport aircraft, although there were plans in the late 1980s to acquire a BAe 146-100STA, capable of being converted into a VIP configuration, however, the already painted and registered aircraft was never flown to Austria, as the deal had to be cancelled due to political pressure that led to tensions within the Austrian Government. The head of state, as well as members of the government, are flown on scheduled flights, preferably using flag carrier Austrian Airlines, occasionally chartering smaller aircraft. Until the late 1990s, domestic VIP flights were operated by a four-seater Saab 105OE of the Austrian Air Force. For visits of peacekeeping missions of the Austrian Armed Forces, a Lockheed C-130K Hercules is still being used.

However, the Finnish Air Force operates three Learjet 35 aircraft with limited transport capability for use by senior government and military officials, and other aircraft from the Finnish Air Force can also be used. Helicopters of the Finnish Army or Coast Guard are utilized to provide transport to senior officials on some domestic trips.

Former prime minister Juha Sipilä, an avid aviator, has also made official trips with aircraft that he has personally flown and paid for, such as a Cessna CitationJet/M2 525 and a Scanwings Cessna 525 (OH-SWI). The longest trip was to Ulaan Baatar in 2016. The government leases private jets from companies such as Jetflite.

France 

The Escadron de Transport 60, formerly Escadron de transport, d'entrainement et de calibration 00.065 (ETEC 65, "Transportation, training and calibration squadron"), is the unit of the French Air Force, under direct command of the Minister of Defence, in charge of the transportation of the President, the Prime Minister and other French government officials.

The aircraft are named after Konrad Adenauer, the first chancellor of (West) Germany, and Theodor Heuss, its first President. Until 2011 Germany's government officials used two Airbus A310-304 VIP carrying the same names, previously of East Germany's Interflug. In April 2019, Germany's "Luftwaffe" ordered three Airbus A350-900 as their new government planes and as a replacement for the aging A340s.

In Summer 2019, the Luftwaffe also ordered three Bombardier Global 6000 as an addition to the existing fleet.

The planes fly under German Air Force callsigns.

Greece 
Greece's prime minister has a Gulfstream V at his disposal, which is under the operational command of the Hellenic Air Force. The aircraft was bought by the government of Costas Simitis for the needs of Greece's 2003 EU presidency and the preparations of the 2004 Olympic Games. The VIP transport squadron (112 Combat Wing at the Elefsis Air Force Base) of the Hellenic Air Force also operates two Embraer business jets. For long haul flights the Prime Minister and other officials used one of the Airbus A340-300s of the government owned Olympic Airlines when they were still in service. The A340 aircraft were used for the official visit of the Greek Prime Minister to Australia in 2007.

Two other aircraft used over the last two decades for the same purpose raised controversy. A Dassault Falcon 900 had a range of technical problems culminating in an accident that cost the life of the deputy minister of foreign affairs Giannos Kranidiotis and five other people due to severe in-flight pitch oscillations 20 minutes before landing at Bucharest on 9 September 1999.

Under executive order 2954/28-8-12, the Greek government bestowed the 30-seat Embraer to the Hellenic Air Force to be used for pilot training, patient airlift and organ transplant transportation.

The planes fly under regular Norwegian Air Force callsigns albeit with some changes.

Poland

As of June 2022, the Polish Government operates a fleet of five aircraft for VIP transport. This includes two Boeing BBJ2 in custom configuration for 65 passengers and featuring secure communication systems as well as anti-missile defense systems, one reconfigured Boeing 737-800NG with 132 seats, and two Gulfstream G550 each capable of carrying 16 passengers. The aircraft are operated and maintained by the Polish Air Force 1st Airlift Air Base.

During communist rule in the People's Republic of Poland the aircraft used for head of state transport included Lisunov Li-2, Ilyushin Il-14, Il-18, Tupolev Tu-134A, Yakovlev Yak-40.

Tu-154M tail number 101, carrying the President of Poland Lech Kaczyński, crashed in April 2010. The remaining Tu-154M and all Yak-40s were retired in 2011, while the 36th Regiment was disbanded. Due to lack of the VIP fleet both the president and prime minister often used Polish Air Force EADS CASA C-295Ms for domestic flight and due to civil aviation restrictions.

Between June 2010 and December 2018 the Government of Poland used two Embraer ERJ-175LR (ERJ-170-200LR) leased from LOT Polish Airlines to carry out state flights. Since 2012 Polish Air Force 1st Airlift Air Base in Warsaw-Okecie operates VIP helicopters for domestic transportation and since 2018 the long range passenger jets.

The flights carried by LOT are operated with both the rules of the civil procedures and in line with the unofficial civil HEAD instruction.

Portugal

The Portuguese Air Force operates three Dassault Falcon 50s and one Dassault Falcon 900 for use by the President of the Republic and the Prime Minister, as well as cabinet members and other dignitaries when appropriate. They are operated by the 504 Squadron "Linces", based at the Lisbon Military Airfield (AT1).

Additionally, for similar use, the Portuguese Air Force maintained three Dassault Falcon 20s, bought from FedEx as cargo aircraft and converted to VIP configuration maintaining the outsized cargo door. These aircraft are no longer operational, the last one being used as an Aeronautical Navigation Calibration aircraft. These aircraft also flew under Portuguese Air Force callsigns.

The three Dassault Falcon 50 are also often used for long range emergency human organ transports and medical evacuation, mainly from and to the Portuguese islands of Azores and Madeira.

The Portuguese heads of state often fly in modern Airbus A330-900 and other planes from TAP Air Portugal state owned company in long haul travels.

The Spanish Air Force operates two customized Airbus A310s and five Falcon 900s, for transportation of the King, the Prime Minister, high-ranking government officials and the Spanish Royal Family. These transportation services are provided by the 45th Group of the Air Force, based in Torrejón Air Base,  away from Madrid. A new unit, an Airbus 330, is pending approval by the Council of Ministers of Spain. This will be the new official aircraft of the King and the Prime Minister. Usually when the Prime Minister and high-ranking officials travel, they use the Airbus A310 and use 1 of the Falcon 900s as a support aircraft. The planes use the current Spanish Air Force callsign "AME".

Previously, Spanish Air Force Boeing KC-707Cs were utilized.

Sweden 

The Swedish Air Force Transport Squadron Bromma (Stockholm), based on Stockholm-Bromma Airport in Stockholm Municipality, operates the State Flight (Swedish: Statsflyget). It forms part of the Transport and Special Flying Unit (TSFE, Swedish: Transport och Specialflygenheten), which in its turn is a part of the Skaraborg Wing (F 7). Currently it operates two Gulfstream IV aircraft and one Gulfstream G550 in the VIP transport role.

The Air Force also operates three Saab 340 in the VIP transport role.

The use of the State Flight is regulated in the State Flight Ordinance () issued by the Government of Sweden. All aircraft serve the official transport needs of the King and other members of the Swedish Royal Family, the Prime Minister and cabinet ministers, and senior Swedish Armed Forces officers.

They also fly scheduled flights, then using business class and using VIP area for check in and security check.

All planes use a regular Swedish Air Force callsign, SVF.

Switzerland 

The Lufttransportdienst des Bundes (LTDB) (English: Swiss Federal Government's air transport service), a unit of the Swiss Air Force located at Bern Airport, operates a fleet of VIP transport aircraft:

 one Dassault Falcon 900EX EASy II (T-785)
 one Cessna 560XL Citation Excel| (T-784)
 one Pilatus PC-24 (T-786)
 two Bombardier Challenger 604 (T-751, T-752), for transport and medical evacuation
 one Beechcraft 1900D (T-729), non VIP transport, located at the Dübendorf Air Base
 one Beechcraft Model 350C Super King Air (T-721), non VIP transport, located at the Dübendorf Air Base

These aircraft are mainly used by members of the Swiss Federal Council. Travel arrangements are coordinated by the Government Travel Centre in the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs. The Swiss-built PC-24 of Pilatus Aircraft complete the fleet in 2019. The Beechcraft 1900D will be replaced in 2019 by two Canadair CL-604 previously operated by Rega. All of these aircraft are based at Bern Airport.

The 6th Air Transport Squadron, flying from the Alpnach Air Base, also operates two Eurocopter EC635 as VIP transport helicopters and has a number of Super Puma helicopters at its disposal, one of which is configured constantly as a VIP transport for domestic use and another one can be configured for VIP transport. Before the introduction of the EC635s, a Eurocopter Dauphin was used as a VIP helicopter.

The planes use the callsign "SUI".

Ukraine

The President of Ukraine, along with high-ranking Ukrainian government officials are allotted two aircraft: an Airbus A319-100 (registered UR-ABA) and an Antonov An-148 (registered UR-UKR), both of which were originally operated by Ukraine Air Enterprise, under the state-owned State Management of Affairs. The An-148, along with an Mi-8MTV-1, was transferred to Ukrainian Ministry of Defence in 2021. The planes use the callsign "UKN".

However, following the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine military hostilities in 2022, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy prefer to use an assortment of different transport aircraft offered by NATO-members states over the Ukrainian state-owned A319 for international visits, ostensibly for security reasons. The A319 was not summoned for presidential transport until September 2023, when Zelenskyy used it to travel to the United States to attend the 78th session of the UN General Assembly; it was the first time that the plane had been summoned for presidential transport during wartime.

Between 2022 and 2023, Zelenskyy used the following aircraft:

United Kingdom

The British Government and Royal Family have use of an Airbus A330 Voyager, two Dassault 900LX and an Airbus A321 neoLR for official travel. The King's Helicopter Flight also provides two Sikorsky S-76+.

The A330 is the single VIP variant of the A330 MRTT operated by the Royal Air Force and AirTanker for air refueling and military transport. The Voyager was reconfigured to include a secure satellite communications system, missile detection, conference facilities, 58 business class seats and 100 economy seats but retains its primary role for the Royal Air Force. No. 32 (The Royal) Squadron of the RAF maintains an Agusta A109SP helicopter for use principally by the British Armed Forces. Until March 2022, the squadron operated four BAe 146s, which have been replaced by two Dassault 900LX aircraft. The A321 is owned and operated by Titan Airways on behalf of the UK Government.

On visits to Commonwealth realms - such as Australia, Canada and New Zealand - the Royal Family have often used the VIP aircraft of the host nation.

The British government used RAF Transport Command Vickers VC-10 aircraft until the late 1990s before their retirement from long-haul flight. During the 2000s and early 2010s they travelled on aircraft borrowed from British Airways or Virgin Atlantic for non-European or long-haul flights, and on rented private jets for inter-European flights. In 2012, then-Prime Minister David Cameron used a Boeing 747-400 operated by charter airline Atlas Air on his four-day state visit to South-east Asia. Atlas Air typically uses this plane for SonAir, the air transport division of Sonangol Group, an Angolan state-owned oil company. On 8 July 2016, the newly converted RAF Voyager was first used by the UK to transport government ministers from London Heathrow airport to the 2016 NATO conference in Warsaw, Poland. In 2020, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government commissioned additional changes to the aircraft, including a new livery consisting of a mainly white colour scheme, the Union Jack at the rear of the aircraft, and “United Kingdom” written in gold across the sides, to replace the former military grey colour scheme. The changes cost the British Government £900,000 and were carried out at Cambridge Airport. An Airbus A321-200neo with an identical livery was also commissioned in late 2020, with the ability for fast summoning and the capability of flying from London to Washington.

Vatican City/Holy See

Typically, the Pope flies on a chartered ITA Airways fixed-wing aircraft when travelling to or from more distant destinations and making pastoral and state visits to a country. Prior to 2021, the Pope formerly flew on a chartered Alitalia flight before the airline ceased operations in 2021 and later reorganized into ITA Airways. Traditional protocol dictates that a Pope flies to a country he is visiting on a chartered ITA Airways jet and to return on a jet belonging to a flag carrier from the visited nation; this may vary when he is touring multiple nations. When Pope John Paul II visited South America in May 1988, he travelled to Paraguay from Peru in an AeroPerú DC-8, but left Asunción International Airport back to Europe in a transcontinental Alitalia Boeing 747, which was brought in just hours before his farewell ceremony. Líneas Aéreas Paraguayas' longest-range aircraft at the time were Boeing 707-320Bs, which had to stop in Dakar, Senegal to refuel. However, he politely travelled within the country in a LAP jet, which incidentally carried the distinguished visitor's coat of arms in the forward fuselage as courtesy. Pope Benedict XVI also returned to Rome from Brazil on Alitalia.

The call sign of a papal flight within Italy is "volo papale" ("papal flight" in Italian) followed by the number of flights the pope has made. Pope John Paul II made 104 papal flights, so his call sign would have been "Volo Papale 104". The pope also uses a helicopter of the Italian Air Force (Aeronautica Militare), an AgustaWestland AW139, for short distances. There are two papal heliports, with the Vatican City Heliport being on the tiny state's western corner, and another on the southern edge of the extraterritorial papal residence of Castel Gandolfo. The former bears the official Latin designation Portus Helicopterorum.

It is erroneously, but widely, believed and reported that international flights carrying the Pope use the callsign "Shepherd One". This is an urban myth.

Middle East

Algeria 

The Algerian Air Force operates a small fleet of aircraft for use by the President and government officials, the largest of which is an Airbus A340-500. This aircraft was purchased under the rule of Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who only used it once before it was mothballed for several years and returned to use after Abdelmadjid Tebboune came to power.

Other, smaller aircraft that can be used include 2 ATR 72s, one Gulfstream G-V, and 3 Gulfstream G-IVs. Formerly used aircraft include models like an Ilyushin Il-18V and a Dassault Falcon 20C. Officials may also use Air Algérie aircraft for travel as well.

All aircraft use their registrations as callsigns.

Bahrain 

The Bahrain Royal Flight and Bahrain Defense Force use 2 Boeing 747-400, 1 Boeing 767-400, 1 Boeing 737-800, 5 BAe-146 of various modifications and 3 Gulfstream Aerospace (G450, G550, G650) for VIP transportation.

In terms of callsigns, the 747-400s flies under "BAH1"/2", the 767-400 flies under "BAH3", the Gulfstream G450 under "BAH4", the Gulfstream G550 under "BAH5", the Gulfstream G650 under "BAH6", and the Avro RJ85 under "BAH8".

Cyprus
The government of Cyprus uses an Embraer ERJ-135 for travel, which was gifted by the Greek government in 2022, which flies under the callsign "CAF001". Previously aircraft such as a Dassault Falcon 2000, and commercial aircraft were used.

Egypt

The government of Egypt operated an Airbus A340-200 along with a number of business jets including the Gulfstream IV and Dassault Falcon 20s in 2015.

The first presidential aircraft in Egypt was a gift from Saudi Arabia to Egyptian President Anwar Sadat. Before that, the President of Egypt, Gamal Abdel Nasser, traveled using a rented aircraft from Egypt Air.

On September 10, 2021, it was announced that the Egyptian government had acquired a Boeing 747-8I, registered SU-EGY for use as a VIP transport aircraft. The 747, which had originally been ordered by Lufthansa as D-ABYE, had not been accepted by the airline and spent a number of years in the Mojave Desert as N828BA.

In addition to air force aircraft, a number of aircraft are directly under government control to transfer the president of Egypt, presidential logistics, the prime minister and members of the government, including:

Any aircraft carrying the president, mostly the A340, flies under the callsign "EGY1".

Iran

Until the early 2010s, the supreme leader, the president and other high-ranking government officials of Iran were still using the aged but famous Shahin, a special VIP designed Boeing 707 which was ordered and purchased by the Shah of Iran in the 1970s. It was initially far more luxuriously outfitted than US Air Force One (also a Boeing 707 at the time), but after the Iranian Revolution in 1979 it was redesigned as a normal VIP aircraft. Another VIP airliner, an Airbus A321 which was purchased during the 1990s, is also used on medium range trips of high officials such as the Foreign Minister, the Speaker of Parliament and the Secretary of the Supreme National Security Council. The other VIP aircraft in use by the government consist of one Dassault Falcon 20, three Dassault Falcon 50s and a Lockheed JetStar all operated by the Iranian Air Force, and an Airbus A340-300, operated (along with the A321) by Meraj Airlines. The government of Iran had also occasionally chartered an A340-300 from Mahan Air prior to the acquisition of the current A340-300.

As of 2022, the Supreme Leader owns four planes: Airbus A340-313, Dassault Falcon 50, Dassault Falcon 900EX and the Airbus A321-231.

Any aircraft carrying the President uses the callsign "IRAN02".

Iraq
As of 2020, the government of Iraq operates a Boeing 737-800.

Prior to 2014, it used a Boeing 767-200 and an Airbus A310.

Former President Saddam Hussein had his own personal Boeing 747SP for his travel as well as few Boeing 727s and Dassault Falcons for governmental use. Now, they travel on either a Boeing 737-800 or a Boeing 767-300ER from Iraqi Airways.

The current 737 flies under the callsign "IPF", short for "Iraqi Presidential Office".

Israel

Since 1948, senior officials of the Israel government, including the President and the Prime Minister, have either travelled on military aircraft supplied by the Israeli government or on commercially-chartered aircraft.

In the early years of Israel's existence, prime minister David Ben-Gurion travelled using military aircraft belonging to the Israeli Air Force (IAF), such as the Douglas DC-3. However, in the 1960s, the IAF chose to use a specially-adapted Boeing 377 Stratocruiser, for ministerial travel abroad. From the 1970s onwards, government officials were transported internationally using second-hand Boeing 707 aircraft, which were purchased beforehand from commercial airlines and specifically configured for VIP transportation. The 707 was retired by the IAF in 2001.

Beginning from the 2000s, senior Israeli government officials have been transported abroad using commercial airliners leased by the Ministry of Defense from El Al. For short-range international flights, El Al's inventory of Boeing 737 aircraft have been customarily used, while the larger wide-body aircraft such as the Boeing 767 and 777 have been supplied for long-range transcontinental travel. Nonetheless, this practice has been criticized for its annual incurrence of high costs stemming from leasing and transportation, in addition to the planes' lack of secure communication facilities.

In April 2014, Israel's Cabinet approved a decision to procure an aircraft dedicated exclusively for the transport of the president and the prime minister. The move, which specified the purchase of a second-hand airliner and its reconfiguration for VIP transport, was initially estimated to cost around NIS 393 million. In 2016, Israel purchased a second-hand Boeing 767-300ER originally operated by Qantas, which had first flown in 2000. The 767, dubbed the Knaf Zion (Wing of Zion) was retrofitted with infrared missile-defense countermeasures and a secure communications suite over a span of two years, and first flew in November 2019.

Jordan
The members of the royal family and government officials use an Airbus A318-112 Elite. They also can use either private aircraft or other government aircraft at their disposal. The Jordanian King has also been known to use a UAE Boeing 777-200 belonging to the Amiri Flight Wing.

Any plane carrying the royal family or government flies under a Royal Jordanian callsign "RJA" or the registration.

Kuwait

Until April 2013, the Emir of Kuwait used a Boeing 747-400; since then he has used either one of two Airbus A340-500 airframes equipped with military defense equipment to protect the aircraft from any potential attacks, or since 2016, a Boeing 747-8 equipped similarly to the A340s. The aircraft are also used by the Crown Prince of Kuwait.

The rest of the official state aircraft used by senior ruling family members and cabinet members consist of:

These aircraft all fly under "KUG" (Kuwaiti Government) callsigns with some differences.

Lebanon

For his local and regional trips, the Lebanese president uses a Lebanese Air Force VIP variant of an AgustaWestland AW139 code named "Cedar 1"; the helicopter was a gift from the Emir of Qatar HH Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani. The Lebanese president uses Middle East Airlines (MEA) jets for his international trips. MEA aircraft use "Cedar Jet 1" (MEA1) as a special call sign when they are transporting the president.

Libya
During the rule of Gaddafi, the government operated an Airbus A340-200 for international travel. After the fall of Gaddafi, the plane was ferried to Perpignan in France in 2014 for repairs. It was then released seven years later and now flies for the current government. A Dassault Falcon 900EX has also been used for travel, along with a retired Ilyushin Il-62M and a Lockheed L-1329 Jetstar. Any plane with the president flies under the callsign "LBY001".

Mauritania 
The Mauritanian Air Force currently operates a Boeing 737 BBJ in a white-livery for use by the President and government officials, registered under the callsign 5T-ONE.

Before the acquisition of this plane, the government would borrow aircraft from Mauritania Airlines, such as Boeing 737s and Embraer 175s.

Currently, any aircraft carrying the president flies under the callsign "MRT001".

Morocco

The Moroccan Air Force operates a fleet of VIP aircraft for use by Moroccan officials, including King Mohammed VI and Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch:

A fleet of smaller jets and Beechcraft Super King Air 200/350 turboprops, is also occasionally used for VIP-transport of the royal family, ministers and armed forces senior staff.

All aircraft use either a Royal Air Maroc callsign or the callsigns "RMAF" or "FRV".

Oman

The Royal Flight of Oman operates the following aircraft for use by the Sultan of Oman and members of his government.

All planes fly under the callsign "OMAN" or "ORF.

Qatar

The government-owned carrier Qatar Amiri Flight is used to transport royal and other VIP government personnel.

These aircraft, with the exception of the A320, all fly under a regular Qatar Airways callsign. All aircraft fly under Qatari Air Force (QAF) callsigns.

Saudi Arabia

The Saudi royal family and government have multiple fleets of aircraft at their disposal. The Saudi Arabian Government operates a Boeing 747-300, a Boeing 747-400, a Boeing 757-200, an Airbus A340-200 and a Boeing 777-300ER for use by the King of Saudi Arabia. Saudi Royal Flight operates an Airbus A318 corporate jet. In the mid-2010s the Saudi government struck a deal with Boeing to purchase two Boeing 787s, registrations HZ-MF7 and HZ-MF8 for exclusive use by the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman. These aircraft were not painted in the normal Saudia livery, but in the livery for aircraft operated by the Saudi Ministry of Finance and Economy. Other aircraft operated by the Saudi Ministry of Finance and Economy are 3 Boeing 737 Business Jets and 3 Gulfstream G300s. Other aircraft used by Saudi royals are 2 Boeing 737-700 BBJ and 1 Gulfstream G450 operated by the Saudi Air Force, painted in an all-white livery with a Saudi flag on the tail and green stripes across the fuselage, and aircraft operated by Saudi Aramco.

All planes except the 737 BBJ fly under the regular Saudi callsign SVA. The 737 flies under the callsign SHU.

Sudan 
The former President of Sudan Omar al-Bashir typically used to travel on an Ilyushin Il-62 or a Dassault Falcon 50. Two Mil Mi-17 VIP helicopters are also used for domestic air transport. An Embraer EMB-135 with a brown livery and  a Dassault Falcon 20F are also utilised. Currently in the government fleet there is a Dassault Falcon 900 (reg: ST-PSA)

In 2021 an A320 was noted in Abu Dhabi with Sudanese government titles (registered A6-EIP). As this plane used to be operated by Etihad, the plane flies under a four-digit Etihad callsign and still retains its original registration.

Syria 

The government of Syria operated a Dassault Falcon 900 in 2016. They also operate a Dassault Falcon 20E and a Dassault Falcon 50, which all use special Syrianair callsigns. President Bashar al-Assad used an Airbus A320 from Syrianair during a landmark trip to Saudi Arabia.

Tunisia

The government of Tunisia operates a Boeing 737 BBJ bought in 1999 and registered under TS-IOO. In 2008 former President Ben Ali tried to replace it with an Airbus A340-542 registered TS-KRT, but he only used it once before he sent it back to France to change the interior design. Ben Ali was ousted in the Tunisian Revolution in 2011 and the post-revolutionary government sought to get rid of the aircraft,  eventually selling it to the Turkish government in 2016. Whenever a plane is carrying the President, it uses the callsign "TUNIS1".

Turkey

The government of Turkey has a VIP fleet which is maintained by Turkish Airlines for and on behalf of the President of the Republic. Airplanes and helicopters use the state aircraft hangar at Ankara Esenboğa Airport as its main base, which was opened in 2013. The maintenance and parking operations of these aircraft and helicopters are performed here. The airplanes and helicopters are used for the domestic and international flights of the President, Vice Presidents, the Speaker of the Grand National Assembly and the Ministers. In 2016, there was a total of 2026 flight hours performed by 11 aircraft. In the same year, the three helicopters flew together for a total of 485 hours. Flight operations and catering services of the aircraft is done by the Turkish Airlines staff, while the maintenance of aircraft is done by Turkish Technic staff. The maintenance and flight operations of the helicopters are carried out by Presidential personnel.

The composition of the Turkish government fleet is shown in the table below.

The Airbus A340-500 was purchased from the Tunisian government after President Ben Ali, who ordered it to replace a Boeing BBJ, was ousted.

A heavily modified Boeing 747-8 was gifted to Turkey by the royal family of Qatar.

When the President of the Turkish Republic is on board any aircraft, the call-sign is "Turkish Republic One"/TRK1.

United Arab Emirates

The United Arab Emirates has seven constituent Emirates, each one with its own private jet fleet. The most notable fleets are maintained by the Dubai Royal Air Wing and Presidential Flight (UAE).

The Dubai Royal Air Wing has 10 aircraft ranging in size from a Boeing 737-700 to a Boeing 747-400, used by the Emir of Dubai as well as government officials.

Presidential Flight of the Abu Dhabi Emirate has 8 aircraft, the smallest being an Airbus A320-200 and the largest being a Boeing 787-9.

The Sharjah Royal Flight uses an Airbus A319 and Airbus A320.

The Fujairah Amiri flight has one aircraft, an Airbus A320.

The Boeing 777 in the fleet has also, in the past, been used by the Jordanian royal family for trips overseas; if this happens then any "UNITED ARAB EMIRATES" titles are removed from the fuselage of the plane to avoid confusion.

The planes use the callsign "Dubai" or "AUH".

Yemen

Yemenia operated a VIP-configured Boeing 747SP registered 7O-YMN for use by the government of Yemen. The aircraft carried the Yemenia Yemen Airways livery. In March 2015, the Boeing 747SP was damaged by gun fire during a militia attack at Aden airport, and a subsequent blaze destroyed the aircraft completely. In August 2016, the internationally recognized government bought a Boeing 757-200 registered 7O-VIP that previously operated as a VIP transport for Uzbekistan Airways with UK75700 as its registration. The 757 underwent refit and repaint in Yemen government's livery at GMF AeroAsia's maintenance facility at Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, Jakarta, prior to delivery to Yemen.

Any aircraft carrying the president uses the callsign "IYE1".

United States

Air travel arrangements for the President are made by the White House Military Office, and may use one of three different types of aircraft depending on the flight and available runways. The first type is two customized Boeing 747-200B jetliners with military designation VC-25A. With a livery first designed by Raymond Loewy in 1962, they are among the most recognizable aircraft in the world and are a global symbol of the country as well as the President of the United States. They are also considered to have inspired other nations to acquire dedicated aircraft for state travel. These aircraft are primarily used by the President and are scheduled to be replaced by Boeing 747-8i aircraft, military designation VC-25B, in the near future. The VC-25 is used for airfields with runway lengths of  or longer because the four-engine jets require longer runways for take-offs and landings. For long-distance domestic travel and all international travel, the United States Armed Forces requires that the presidential aircraft have at least four engines.

The Vice President of the United States, the First Lady and Second Ladies/Gentlemen, the Secretary of State and other high-ranking officials may use customized Boeing 757-200, Boeing 737 or Gulfstream G550 aircraft with military designations C-32A, C-40B and C-37A/B, respectively. The President-elect and Vice President-elect of the United States may also use these aircraft, upon courtesy extended by the departing Administration. Each of these aircraft bear liveries based on the Loewy design. The exact aircraft used will depend on the length and destination of the flight, as these aircraft may take off and land using runways of  in length. However, the President only uses either VC-25A or C-32 aircraft – though, exceptionally, President Barack Obama once used a C-37A for private travel to New York City in 2009 – while the Vice President almost always uses C-32 aircraft. For long-distance domestic travel and international trips, the Secretary of Defense uses one of four modified Boeing 747-200B aircraft with the military designation of E-4B. These aircraft are specially fitted to serve as National Emergency Airborne Command Posts during wartime.

The callsign of any aircraft is regular if it is not currently carrying the President or vice-president. The callsign of any military aircraft that currently carries the President is called that military branch name followed by "One", such as Army One, Air Force One, Navy One, or Marine One (which is typically associated with a helicopter). The callsign of any military aircraft that currently carries the Vice President is called that military branch name followed by "Two", such as Air Force Two, Coast Guard Two, or Marine Two (which is typically associated with a helicopter). In the one instance that the President traveled on a private aircraft its callsign was Executive One, and Vice President Rockefeller's private Gulfstream was Executive Two when he was on board during his term of office.

In addition, the US military maintains separate fleets of Boeing C-40 Clippers (Boeing 737-700), C-37As (Gulfstream V) and C-37Bs (Gulfstream G550) for use by government officials, Members of Congress and the White House. These may have different liveries than the Loewy design.

Australia 

The Royal Australian Air Force operates a number of specialised aircraft to carry the King of Australia, members of the Royal Family, the Governor-General of Australia, the Prime Minister of Australia, senior members of the Australian government, and foreign, mostly Pacific Island, dignitaries.

An Airbus A330 MRTT multi-role tanker was announced by Defence Minister David Johnston in 2014 to be acquired for VIP transport, whilst maintaining its original ability to serve as a military tanker and transport aircraft.[1] The aircraft has the registration A39-007 and is painted in an "air force grey" livery rather than the white colour scheme. While no official photos have been released, the aircraft has 100 lie-flat seats for its passengers.

The RAAF's other VIP aircraft are two leased Boeing Business Jets and three Dassault Falcon 7Xs which are operated by the No. 34 Squadron RAAF and are based at Canberra Airport. The Falcon 7Xs replaced three Bombardier Challenger 604s in 2019. The Boeing Business Jets are custom configured Boeing 737-700s, fitted with facilities such as conference tables, offices suites, secure satellite and communication capabilities. These two aircraft have a longer range than what is standard for Boeing Business Jets. The Prime Minister regularly makes use of the aircraft for domestic and international travel.

The BBJs and Challenger 604s replaced five No. 34 Squadron Dassault Falcon 900s and passenger-configured Boeing 707s tanker transports of No. 33 Squadron RAAF in 2002. These in turn replaced two BAC One-Elevens, three Dassault Falcon 20s and two Hawker Siddeley HS 748s.

These aircraft usually fly under the callsign "ASY", followed by a three-digit number.

As multi-role aircraft, they are more often used as transport aircraft for troops or freight. Generally, the Prime Minister and government officials use commercial or chartered flights (with Air New Zealand where available) to travel both domestically and internationally. The 757s replaced a pair of aging Boeing 727s. The planes use a regular RNZAF "KIWI/KIW" callsign.

Argentina 

The Presidential Air Group uses a Boeing 757 outfitted in a VIP configuration for use as presidential transport.

The Argentinian government once operated a much larger fleet of aircraft and helicopters for exclusive use by the President of Argentina and his or her family. This set of aircraft was known as the "Agrupación Aérea Presidencial" (literally Spanish for Presidential Air Group) and belonged to one of the Departments of the Presidency, called the Military House (known in Spanish as Casa Militar).

This department was responsible for presidential security and transportation. Also incorporated during the presidency of Carlos Menem to replace an ageing Boeing 707, a Boeing 757-200 (T-01) was used for international visits. The Agrupación Aérea Presidencial was closed in 2016 by then-president Mauricio Macri, because of the high cost of repairs and maintenance and the lack of adequate pilots and spare parts. The fleet of the Presidential Air Group in 2014 was composed of

 T-01 (Tango 01) Boeing 757-200
 T-02 Fokker F-28-4000 Fellowship
 T-03 Fokker F-28-1000C Fellowship
 T-04 Boeing 737-500
 T-10 Learjet 60
 H-01 Sikorsky S-70A Black Hawk
 H-02 Sikorsky S-76B
 H-03 Sikorsky S-76B

All aircraft from the Agrupación Aérea Presidencial are currently stored, however Mauricio Macri used the Boeing 737-500 for domestic and short-haul trips, while utilising private jets for long-haul trips.

In 2014, Argentinian officials Axel Kicillof and Hector Timmerman traveled to the G20 in Brisbane, however, due to maintenance issues, a private Swiss-registered Dassault Falcon 7X was leased and used. The plane flew from Rio Gallegos to Christchurch for a stopover before flying to Brisbane. Former President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner also once used a Comlux Aviation Bombardier when she attended the 2010 G20 meeting in Seoul.

When current President Alberto Fernandez came to power, his mode of air transport was an Aerolineas Argentinas Airbus A330-200, which would fly under the callsign "PRESI01".

Any aircraft of the Agrupación Aérea Presidencial carrying the president would fly under the callsign "ARG1".

Bolivia 

The first known government jet owned by the Bolivian government was a Rockwell Sabreliner business-jet, acquired in 1975 for use by the president and government officials and operated by the Bolivian Air Force. In July 2010, the Bolivian government bought a Dassault Falcon 900EX for use by the president. In July 2013, the Bolivian government acquired a Dassault Falcon 50EX for use by the Executive Body.

Brazil 

The main Presidential aircraft used by the Brazilian Government is a modified Airbus A319, designated by the Brazilian Air Force as VC-1A and officially christened as the "Santos-Dumont", after the Brazilian aviation pioneer. The VC-1A is used for transporting the President on international medium-range travel.

For certain long-range flights the government uses a Boeing 767, which has a lease from 2017 to 2025. For short-range flights the President is transported in one of the two modified Embraer 190 presidential jets. When an aircraft is transporting the President of Brazil it uses the callsign Força Aérea 01 (Air Force One), ICAO code BRS01.

The Special Transport Group (GTE) of the Brazilian Air Force is responsible for transporting the President, the vice-president and senior ministers of the Brazilian Government. The GTE comprises 22 aircraft:
 A modified VIP-configured Airbus A319 (VC-1A) "Santos-Dumont" used on all international flights carrying the President.
 Two modified VIP-configured Embraer 190 jets, "Bartolomeu de Gusmão" and "Augusto Severo", used on domestic and regional flights carrying the President and as a backup aircraft accompanying the President.
 Two VIP-configured Eurocopter Super Puma (VH-34) presidential helicopters.
 Two VIP-configured Embraer ERJ-135 (VC-99C) aircraft.
 Ten Embraer ERJ-145 (C-99A) aircraft.
 Three Gates Learjet 35 (VU-35) jets.

The fleet is headquartered at the Brasília Air Force Base (BABR).

Chile 

The transportation of the president was formerly operated by state-owned flag carrier Lan Airlines, providing a Boeing 707 or a Boeing 737-200.

Nowadays, the transportation is under the responsibility of the Chilean Air Force, which operates the following aircraft:
 1 Boeing 737-500
 1 Beechcraft 200 King Air
 1 Gulfstream IV
 1 Boeing 767-300ER

Formerly, the Air Force also used a Boeing 707-320C which is still in service for military purposes.

Any aircraft carrying the president flies under the callsign "FACH1".

Colombia 

In 1933, Colombia acquired its first presidential transport aircraft, a Junkers Ju 52/3m, one of the most advanced aircraft of that time. It served former President Enrique Olaya Herrera until its retirement from service in 1950. From 1953 to 1972, a Douglas C-54 Skymaster served as the presidential aircraft starting with the dictatorship of Gustavo Rojas Pinilla (1953–57).

In 1972 a new Fokker F28-1000 became the presidential aircraft during the presidency of Misael Pastrana Borrero.

In 2005, Colombia operated the following aircraft for presidential transport:

The Colombian president may use the modified "Jupiter" Boeing KC-767 for longer-range flights.

Any aircraft carrying the president flies under the callsign "FAC0001".

Ecuador

Ecuador had a Dassault Falcon 7X and an Embraer Legacy 600 for presidential long and short range transport respectively, both acquired in recent years by Rafael Correa's government. They replaced an older fleet of Rockwell Sabreliners and Avro 748s. Aircraft from commercial airline Tame have also been used. In 2021, president Guillermo Lasso ordered the retirement and sale of the presidential plane as part of a decree to "rationalize public spending and balance the national budget by selling unproductive assets whose conservation would be inefficient or unnecessary".

Any plane carrying the president flies under the callsign "FAE001".

Guyana 
A Beechcraft B300 King Air is currently utilised by the Guyanese government for overseas travel, registered 8R-GPW.

Paraguay
The government uses a Cessna 680 Citation Sovereign (reg: FAP-3001) for travel, painted in the colors of the Paraguayan flag. Previously, aircraft like a Boeing 707 were used. As the planes belong to the Paraguayan Air Force, a regular Paraguayan Air Force callsign is used.

Peru

The official aircraft of the President of Peru is a Boeing 737-500 of the Peruvian Air Force, acquired in 1995 during Alberto Fujimori's presidency. Recent President Pedro Castillo promised to sell the aircraft and fly commercial, use the money for health and education for the poor, as well as considering banning government officials from flying first class. The plane flies under a Peruvian Air Force callsign.

Suriname 
An Airbus A340-313 is chartered from Surinam Airways and has been used for international and long haul flights. For regional flights in the Caribbean, North-, Central-, and South America a Boeing 737-300 is also chartered from Surinam Airways. For domestic flights, a helicopter is chartered from Hi-Jet Helicopter Services.

A China Southern Airbus A330 was also used to transport the President during a 2019 trip to China.

Uruguay

The President of Uruguay uses an Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia, operated by the Uruguayan Air Force, which uses a regular Uruguayan Air Force callsign, for flights within South America. Outside of South America, commercial flights are used.

Venezuela
Two government aircraft in 2019 were transferred to the management of the national airline Conviasa, repainted in its colors and re-registered. These aircraft include one Airbus A319CJ (ex-reg: 0001) - YV2984, and one Boeing 737-200 (ex-reg: 0207) - YV3434. An Embraer Lineage 1000 (reg:YV3016) from Conviasa is used too.

Former President Hugo Chavez often traveled on board an Ilyushin Il-96 aircraft owned by Cubana de Aviacion. A fleet of about 15 Dassault Falcons 900EXes, Falcon 50s and Learjets 45s is used for high-ranking officials.

The planes use the callsign "Venezuelan Air Force 001/FAV0001" when carrying the President.
