In 1713, Charles Calvert, 3rd Baron Baltimore, decreed 10,000 acres (40 km2) for himself. He made a gift of this land to his fourth wife, christening the estate "My Lady's Manor." It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Also listed on the National Register are the Corbett Historic District and St. James Church.
