Futian District () is one of the nine districts comprising the city of Shenzhen, China. The district is home to the government and Municipal Committee of Shenzhen, as well as the city's central business district (CBD).

Name
There are two theories concerning the origin of the district's name:
 From an inscription dating to the Song Dynasty (960–1297) which reads: "Lakes and mountains are blessed with fertile farmlands" ().
 Written records showing that people from Shangsha Village built houses in Songziling in 1192; their farmlands were cultivated in lattice shapes, which in Chinese is a homophone for "Futian" meaning "blessed fields".

History
Luohu District was established in April 1979, one month after Shenzhen was promoted to city status. Futian, and another area called Fucheng (), became communes within the Luohu District.

Futian became part of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone after it was designated in 1980. It then became a subdistrict under the district of Shangbu ().

Futian, along with Nanshan, was promoted to district status in October 1990. The Shangbu district, which had governed the Futian subdistrict the previous decade, became a part of the Futian district. The district government was established on Shennan Middle Road.

Rapid urbanization occurred in the late 20th century; the agricultural land which once made up a vast majority of Luohu had shrunk to an area of only  by 2003.

Economy
As of 2022, the nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Futian District is 551.45 billion CNY (76.4 billion USD), second in the city behind neighboring Nanshan District. This figure is the third highest of all districts belonging to municipal-level cities in China.
The Central Business District (CBD) of Shenzhen is a planned development project that began in the early 1990s. Located within the Futian district, it comprises an area of 607 hectares. The four sides of the district are delineated by Binhe Dadao, Lianhua Road, Xinzhou Road and Caitian Road.

Many office high-rises and government buildings are located in the CBD, some of which are prominent buildings in Shenzhen, such as the Shenzhen City Hall (Civic Center), Shenzhen Library, Shenzhen Concert Hall, Shenzhen Development Bank building and the Shenzhen Convention and Exhibition Center. Located directly north of the CBD is Lianhuashan Park.

There are numerous skyscrapers in the CBD such as the SEG Tower, the Shum Yip Up Hills Twin Towers, China Merchants Bank Tower, the twin towers of East Pacific Center, and the 599 m (1969 ft) Ping An Finance Center, which is the second tallest building in China and the fourth tallest in the world.
