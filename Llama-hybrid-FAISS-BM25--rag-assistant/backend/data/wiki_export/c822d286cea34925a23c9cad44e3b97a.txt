Nuclear Waste Negotiator

Leroy was appointed the first head of the Office of the United States Nuclear Waste Negotiator in 1990, which identified Native American tribes that could host spent nuclear fuel. In a 1991 speech to the National Congress of American Indians, Leroy stated the Native American's tradition of long-term culture made them especially suited for storing nuclear waste, including quotes from Chief Seattle. This led to sharp negative reactions from the audience, calling it Machiavellian and Orwellian.
