Human Waste is the debut EP by death metal band Suffocation. It was released in May 1991 through Relapse Records, and was also the first ever CD to be released by Relapse. "Infecting The Crypts", "Mass Obliteration", 
and "Jesus Wept" were re-recorded on the following album, Effigy of the Forgotten. "Synthetically Revived" was also re-recorded on Pierced from Within and "Catatonia" was re-recorded for the Despise the Sun EP. The only track that has not been re-recorded is the title track, which was originally recorded for the demo Reincremated.

Human Waste was reissued in 2005 with two bonus tracks taken from the 1990 demo Reincremated (which are "Involuntary Slaughter" and "Reincremation").
