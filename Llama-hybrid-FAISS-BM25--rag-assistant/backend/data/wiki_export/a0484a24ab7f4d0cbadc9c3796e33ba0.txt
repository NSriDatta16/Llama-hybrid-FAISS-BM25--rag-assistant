The European Northern Observatory (ENO) is the name by which the Instituto de Astrof√≠sica de Canarias and its observatories (the Teide Observatory on Tenerife and the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on La Palma) are collectively known. Its name is a word play on the successful collaboration of the member countries in the European Southern Observatory organisation.
