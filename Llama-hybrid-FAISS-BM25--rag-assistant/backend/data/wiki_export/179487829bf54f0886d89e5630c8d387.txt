The Academy of Saint Elizabeth is a private college preparatory secondary school for young women located in Convent Station, New Jersey, United States. Established in 1860, the academy is the oldest secondary school for women in New Jersey. The school is within the Roman Catholic Diocese of Paterson, but operates on an independent basis. The school has been accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools Commissions on Elementary and Secondary Schools since 1928 and is accredited until January 2027.

As of the 2021–22 school year, the school had an enrollment of 208 students and 27.0 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 7.7:1. The school's student body was 89.9% (187) White, 5.3% (11) Hispanic, 2.9% (6) two or more races and 1.9% (4) Black.

The community of Convent Station, which is adjacent to Morristown, was named for the railway station constructed in the 1870s to accommodate the  complex of the Sisters of Charity of Saint Elizabeth that also includes Saint Elizabeth University and Saint Anne's Villa. The religious order was founded in 1859 in Newark, but in 1860 the motherhouse of the new religious order and the academy were established on the site.

The academy is a member of the New Jersey Association of Independent Schools.

History
The Academy of Saint Elizabeth was founded at Morristown in 1860 by the Sisters of Charity. In 1859, Mother Xavier was commissioned by Bishop James Roosevelt Bayley to establish a school for young women in New Jersey, the first secondary school for young women in the state. The academy was established in Madison in September 1860 in a white frame building that still stands. The renaming of Convent Station would come later when Mother Xavier provided funding in the 1870s for the Convent Station train station just outside the front gate of the school campus.

When the religious order founded the academy, they moved their motherhouse and convent from Newark onto a parcel that was located on the developing "Millionaires Row" that stretched from Lonataka Parkway to the center of Morristown, described as the "inland Newport" because of the numerous wealthy families who built grand homes along the route. In 1865, Morristown changed its incorporation to the new "town" category with a boundary that then excluded their large land holdings. Thirty years later, that boundary line officially delineated two governmental jurisdictions in 1895 when Morristown was formally set off from the rest of Morris Township.

The College of Saint Elizabeth (renamed in 2020 to Saint Elizabeth University) was founded in 1899 as part of the complex and, notably, it is the oldest women's college in New Jersey and one of the first Catholic colleges in the United States to award degrees to women. After the new boundary delineated the governmental jurisdiction of Morristown as a smaller area, a community eventually grew up between Morristown and Madison as a separate entity that eventually took its name from the railway station built on the extensive Saint Elizabeth's property.

The first students entered in 1860; the Registration Ledger of September 1 still resides in the principal's office, as do the records of every succeeding year. In 1865, the new academy building was completed, and its first commencement exercises were held on the growing campus. By then, the school had gained a wide reputation for scholarship and was recognized and accepted throughout the state as an institution of strong academics, culture, and Catholic learning for young women. The Sisters continued to acquire land whenever it became available, allowing for a campus that is today more than  and is also the home of Saint Elizabeth University.

Initially, the academy served as a boarding school with students from many countries, but in the 1970s it became strictly a day school. The dormitories were converted into classrooms.

Campus
Today, the campus covers more than  and also the home of Saint Elizabeth University, founded in 1899. Covent Station is an approximately three-minute walk from the academy and many of the students make use of NJ transit to commute to and from school.

The Shakespeare Garden is located in front of the school. St. Elizabeth's recently held a contest to name the garden located in the rear of the school and decided on the title, "Sea of Flowers."

The Sisters of Charity live adjacent to the school and frequently participate in activities with the students. The Holy Family chapel is also found next to the academy, and the students often take part in mass on different occasions.
