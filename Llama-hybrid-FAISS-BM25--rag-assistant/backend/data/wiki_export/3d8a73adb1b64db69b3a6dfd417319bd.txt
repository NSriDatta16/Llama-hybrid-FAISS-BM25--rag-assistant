Wadim Zudilin (Вадим Валентинович Зудилин) is a Russian mathematician and number theorist who is active in studying hypergeometric functions and zeta constants. He studied under Yuri V. Nesterenko and worked at Moscow State University, the Steklov Institute of Mathematics, the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics and the University of Newcastle, Australia. He now works at the Radboud University Nijmegen, the Netherlands.

He has reproved Apéry's theorem that ζ(3) is irrational, and expanded it. Zudilin proved that at least one of the four numbers ζ(5), ζ(7), ζ(9), or ζ(11) is irrational. For that accomplishment he won the Distinguished Award of the Hardy-Ramanujan Society in 2001.

With Doron Zeilberger, Zudilin improved upper bound of irrationality measure for π, which as of November 2022 is the current best estimate.
