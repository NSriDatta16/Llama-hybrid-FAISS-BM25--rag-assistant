History
The village was initially founded by the Herut movement on 18 October 1950 by immigrants from Yemen, and was first named Allar-Bet, later to be called Ramat Shimon.

The village was also called Eitanim, until residents eventually settled on the name Bar-Giora, after Simon Bar Giora. The Yemenite immigrants, dissatisfied with conditions in their new village, abandoned the village after a short stint of 2-3 years, and in 1954 the village was resettled by immigrants from Morocco.
