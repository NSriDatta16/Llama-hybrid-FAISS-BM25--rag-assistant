The 13th congressional district of Pennsylvania is a congressional district in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. The district contains all of Adams, Bedford, Blair, Cambria, Franklin, Fulton, Huntingdon, Juniata, Mifflin, and Perry counties. It also includes slivers of Cumberland and Somerset counties. Republican John Joyce has represented the district since 2019. With a Cook Partisan Voting Index rating of R+25, it is the most Republican district in Pennsylvania.

Prior to February 2018, the district was located in southeastern Pennsylvania, covering eastern Montgomery County and Northeast Philadelphia. The district traditionally included most of Montgomery County, but was redrawn in 2002 to include part of Philadelphia, and altered again in 2012. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania redrew the district in February 2018 after ruling the previous map unconstitutional. The old 13th district became the 4th district, and what was the ninth district in the southwest part of the state was modified and redesignated the 13th district, for the 2018 elections and representation thereafter.

The previously drawn district had long been a Republican stronghold, like many suburban districts in the Northeast. However, the brand of Republicanism in southeastern Pennsylvania was a moderate one, and the district, like the Philadelphia suburbs as a whole, became friendlier to Democrats during the 1990s as the national party veered to the right. The district had not voted Republican for President since 1988. In 1992, the district elected its first Democratic representative in 86 years, Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky. She was defeated in 1994 by Republican Jon D. Fox, but Joe Hoeffel regained the seat for the Democrats in 1998. It was in Democratic hands afterward, becoming even more Democratic after being pushed into Philadelphia after the 2000 census. In 2018, it was redistricted again by court order, becoming the most Republican congressional district in the Northeast.
