History
Lake Bonavista was developed by the Keith Construction company starting in 1967.  It was the first community in Canada to be built around a man-made lake, and served as a prototype for other lake communities in Calgary.

Two trailer courts were on the west side of Bonavista, north of the Avenida Shopping Centre, alongside Macleod Trail. One trailer court was relocated to Northeast Calgary in the late 1990s; the other was removed and the land was sold. The Bonavista Square shopping complex, Calgary Honda, Kramer Mazda and Hyundai Gallery, as well as two apartments, a retirement home, and an office building were built in its place, accessed by an extended Lake Fraser Drive, as well as an interchange, built at Anderson Road and Macleod Trail, in 2001. The Avenida shopping centre, opened in 1988, was built to cater to the increasing size of the neighbourhood. It includes an art gallery and assorted upmarket restaurants.

Manmade Lakes

The area was originally flat treeless prairie with no distinctive natural features.  In order to make the area more attractive, Lake Bonavista, a  manmade lake, was constructed in 1968, with a portion of the earth excavated from the lake used to construct a  hill with a waterfall adjacent to the lake.  The lake and park provide a variety of year-round recreational opportunities for residents, including fishing, swimming, boating, tennis, skating, and tobogganing.  The Lake Bonavista Homeowners Association, membership of which is mandatory for homeowners in the area, provides for the upkeep of the lake and park.

The neighbourhood also contains a second manmade lake, Lake Bonaventure.  This  lake is only accessible from houses built directly around the lake itself.  Homeowners with access to Lake Bonaventure must pay their share of the upkeep on both Lake Bonavista and Lake Bonaventure.

Bonavista Downs residents share many of the amenities with Lake Bonavista, but they do not have access to the lakes and do not pay for their upkeep.
