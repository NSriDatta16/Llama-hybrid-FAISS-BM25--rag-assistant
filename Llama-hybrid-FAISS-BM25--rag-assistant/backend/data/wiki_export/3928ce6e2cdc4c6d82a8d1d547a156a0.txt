David M. Brienza is a professor of rehabilitation science at the University of Pittsburgh School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences. He holds additional professorial appointments in bioengineering and electrical engineering.

Biography
Brienza earned a B.S. from the University of Notre Dame in Electrical Engineering (1986) and a M.S. (1988) and Ph.D. (1991) in Electrical Engineering from the University of Virginia. From 1987 to 1991, he worked as a research assistant at the Rehabilitation Engineering Center at the University of Virginia, and in 1991 he joined the faculty of the University of Pittsburgh. 

Currently, he is the director of the Seating and Soft Tissue Biomechanics Laboratory, and continues to actively pursue research and development in the areas of wheelchair cushions, pressure sore and ulcer prevention, soft tissue biomechanics, telerehabilitation technology and wheelchair technology.
