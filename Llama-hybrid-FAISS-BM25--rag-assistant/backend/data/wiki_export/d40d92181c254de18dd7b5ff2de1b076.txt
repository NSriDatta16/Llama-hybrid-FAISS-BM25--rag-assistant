In Greek mythology, Anapus () was god of the river Anapus in eastern Sicily.  He was worshiped by the Syracusans, who depicted him as a young man.  Anapus was husband to the naiad Cyane, who attempted to dissuade Hades from abducting Persephone, describing how she consented to Anapus' wooing out of love, rather than force.
