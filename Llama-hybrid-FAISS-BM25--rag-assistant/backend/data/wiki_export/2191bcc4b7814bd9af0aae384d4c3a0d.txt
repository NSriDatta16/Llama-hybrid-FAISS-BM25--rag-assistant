Route description
All of SR 246 is located within the city of Toledo in Lucas County. This highway is not included as a part of the National Highway System.

History
The SR 246 designation was established in 1925. It was originally routed along the portion of its present alignment between Secor Road at the southwest corner of the University of Toledo campus, at the time a state-maintained roadway that carried the designation of SR 183, and its current eastern terminus in downtown Toledo.

In 1934, SR 246 was extended from Secor Road to Reynolds Road (U.S. 20). Three years later, the highway was extended west out of Toledo via Dorr Road, Crissey Road and Frankfort Road to a new terminus at SR 295 south of Berkey. Then, in 1939, SR 246 was extended again on the west side, this time utilizing Frankfort Road west of SR 295 to Fulton–Lucas Road, then south to County Road L (CR L), which SR 246 then used heading west across the entire width of Fulton County, and into Williams County. Through Williams County, it followed what is now CR 20N and CR O to the SR 15 intersection, where it then used what is now the westernmost stretch of US 20A to get to a new western terminus at US 20 southwest of Pioneer. The 1937 and 1939 extensions of SR 246 were reversed by 1957, when the portions of the route west of US 20 in the western end of Toledo were removed from the state highway system. In 2021, the route was extended to I-475 and US 23 in preparation for an interchange there, which opened in August 2021.
