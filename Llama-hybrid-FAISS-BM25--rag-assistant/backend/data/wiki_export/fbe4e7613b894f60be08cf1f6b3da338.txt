Alberto is the Romance version of the Latinized form (Albertus) of Germanic Albert. It is used in Italian, Portuguese and Spanish. The diminutive forms are Albertito in Spain or Albertico in some parts of Latin America, Albertino in Italian as well as Tuco as a hypocorism. It derives from the name Adalberto which in turn derives from Athala (meaning noble) and Berth (meaning bright).
