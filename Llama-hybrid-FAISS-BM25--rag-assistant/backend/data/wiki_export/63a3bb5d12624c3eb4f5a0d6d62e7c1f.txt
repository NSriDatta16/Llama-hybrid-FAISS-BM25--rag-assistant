Georgia's 6th congressional district is a congressional district in the U.S. state of Georgia. , it is represented by Republican Rich McCormick. Previously represented by Democrat Lucy McBath, the district's boundaries were redrawn following the 2020 census to be significantly more Republican-leaning than it had been in the previous decade. As a result, McBath announced that she would be running against Carolyn Bourdeaux in the Democratic primary in the neighboring 7th congressional district, which she subsequently won.  Rich McCormick defeated Democrat Bob Christian for the seat in the 2022 congressional elections, took office on January 3, 2023.

Georgia's 6th congressional district has existed since the 29th Congress (1845–1847), the first Congress in which U.S. representatives were elected from districts rather than at-large. Georgia gained a sixth U.S. representative for the first time in the 13th Congress (1813–1815).

Located in north-central Georgia, the district consists of many of the northern suburbs of Atlanta and includes all of Forsyth, Dawson County, portions of eastern Cobb County, northern Fulton County, a snippet of western Gwinnett County, and eastern Cherokee County. From 1965 to 1993, the 6th District covered a swath of exurban and rural territory south and west of Atlanta. In 1992, it moved to its present position in Atlanta's northern suburbs.

The district is known for producing prominent figures in American politics, including former House Speaker and 2012 presidential candidate Newt Gingrich, former Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price, and former U.S. Senator Johnny Isakson. It was also known as a suburban Republican stronghold for much of its recent history, and the party held the seat from 1992 to 2018. However, Metro Atlanta's recent population growth has brought Democratic-leaning voters into the area, as evidenced by McBath's 2018 victory over Republican incumbent Karen Handel. The district's new boundaries have restored its previous Republican bent.
