Wild Pitch Records was an American Golden age hip hop record label, started in 1987 by Stuart Fine, that was eventually distributed by EMI. Artists who released records on the label included Gang Starr, Chill Rob G, Lord Finesse & DJ Mike Smooth, Main Source, The U.M.C.'s, Hard Knocks, Brokin English Klik, Street Military, Super Lover Cee & Casanova Rud, The Coup, Ultramagnetic MCs, O.C., as well as Latee, Jamose, and female rapper N-Tyce. 

Together, Fine and Howard re-established and released the label's catalogue, while also releasing records by Bigmouth, The Wallmen, Mary Lee's Corvette and Mighty Purple. The hip hop music catalogue was eventually acquired by Jay Faires, who tried to reactivate it as part of his short-lived JCOR Entertainment label. 

As the majority of its albums were released in the early 1990s and went out of print, Faires re-released the label's catalog on April 22, 2008, through Fontana Distribution.

In 2013, Complex placed Stu Fine at No. 25 of their 'The 25 Best A&Rs in Hip-Hop History' list.
