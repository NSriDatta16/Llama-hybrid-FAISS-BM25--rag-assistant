Iron Man's armor is a fictional powered exoskeleton appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. It is built and worn by billionaire Tony Stark when he assumes the identity of the superhero Iron Man. The first armor was created in-story by Stark and Ho Yinsen, and was designed by artist Jack Kirby, first appearing in Tales of Suspense #39 (March 1963).

In the fictional multiverse, the appearance of Stark's armor has changed over the years, either as a result of modifications made by Stark or specialized armors created for specific situations. In real life, it changed as different artists took over the series and decided to change it to what they wanted.

Overview
Stark's suits are each unique in design and purpose. They are made of incredibly strong, fictional materials bolstered by a force field. Every suit has a self-contained environment, assorted onboard weapons systems, enhanced strength, thruster-aided flight, and various communications arrays and sensors, such as radar and radio.

Creation

While Tony Stark himself was designed by Don Heck, the designer of the character's first suit of armor in 1963 was Jack Kirby. It was recoloured gold for the character's initial batch of adventures in Tales of Suspense, before being redesigned again by Steve Ditko later in the year - this was the first version to feature a red and gold/yellow scheme, which would come to be Iron Man's most recognisable look.

Bob Layton would redesign the character's armor several times during his stint on the book. In 2008 he recalled that editorial directions in 1981 were that going into space was "a big deal", and devised the first space-going Iron Man suit with this edict in mind. He later devised the 1985 red and silver/white 'Silver Centurion' armor with input from Mark Gruenwald, who directed him to base it along Samurai motifs. The 1994 'Modular' armor was designed by Tom Morgan. When writing the title, David Michelinie avoided overuse of stealth technology in the armor. His eventual successor Len Kaminski disagreed, and in 1994 decided the suit's abilities should be boosted drastically. He devised a component system of armor that could be customised according to various missions, and noted he didn't "like to play fast and loose" with the rules of science and technology. This 'Modular' armor was designed by Tom Morgan, and was the first that could be converted into a 'Hulkbuster' configuration.

In Invincible Iron Man #25 (2010), Stark creates a new armor in the aftermath of the "Stark: Disassembled" storyline. Created by writer Matt Fraction and artist Ryan Meinerding, this new armor is sleeker in appearance, and is featured in the 2010 crossover storyline, the "Heroic Age". When writer Tom Taylor and artist Yildiray Cinar created the 'Endo-Sym Armor' in 2014, they designed it to glow red/orange when Tony was angry.

Fictional history
The first Iron Man armor was created by Stark with the help of Ho Yinsen to escape captivity. After his escape, Stark created a new version with a wide array of improvements; it was colored gold to be less frightening to the general public.

Bleeding Edge armor 
After defeating Norman Osborn in 2010, Stark creates a new "Bleeding Edge" Iron Man suit to replace the Extremis version. Asked whether the Bleeding Edge is an upgrade to Extremis, Stark says, "Nah—this is what comes next." The new armor is a part of Stark's now-posthuman biology; it is stored inside Stark's body, "manifesting" itself when mentally commanded. The neurokinetic user-controlled morphologic nanoparticle bundles that form the suit reside in Stark's body, and form a fibrous wetweb of iron and platinum, that can be commanded to form any type of structure upon Stark's skin, such as large boxing gloves, or weapons, including large guns extending from his arms or a lightsaber-like energy sword with which Iron Man was able to harm one of the Worthy. The nano-machines can mimic the appearance of clothes, then dissociate to transform into the Iron Man armor as Stark wishes. The suit adds less than 25 pounds to Stark's body mass. It can stop a howitzer shell.

The armor and Stark's own transhuman body are powered by the high-yield arc reactor mounted in his chest. The reactor augments Stark's intelligence and enables superhuman multitasking and learning. Unlike earlier armors, this new armor does not appear to rely on motors and servos for motion. Instead, the nano-machines create a secondary artificial musculature over Stark's body, upon which additional rigid structures are assembled. This also enables the armor to self-repair and be almost invulnerable, as the armor is capable of transforming and healing itself as long as the power output from the arc reactor is not interrupted or terminated; when the armor is briefly apparently destroyed in a fight with an alternate version of the Scarlet Witch, it is restored to normal after only a matter of seconds (although it remains inactive long enough to require Spider-Man to rescue Stark from plummeting to the ground). In the 2012 "Ends of the Earth" storyline, Doctor Octopus is able to disable the armor using technology derived from the armor of Iron Man 2020.

The suit's repulsors, which are located around the knuckles, chest, back, and legs of the armor, as well as in the traditional palms, also function as cameras, or "eyeballs", which afford Stark a 360-degree panoramic view. Temporarily replacing the suit's primary composite—iron/platinum—with carbon nanotubes renders it immune to Magneto's powers when he and Iron Man fight over Utopia.

After Stark decides to retire as Iron Man, he undergoes a surgical procedure that expels the Bleeding Edge technology from his body, rendering the armor inert.

List of armors
In 2008, Marvel issued a handbook called All-New Iron Manual, which issued model numbers to the various armor suits seen in the comics up to that point. When the guide was printed in trade paperback form alongside the Iron Manual, the numbering of the armors was revised so that the Model 14 listed in the original printing was now a sub-model of Model 13. Since then other guidebooks have named several newer models, though as of  most featured since 2016 have not received official designations.

In other media

Animated

In the 2007 direct-to-DVD film The Invincible Iron Man, Stark with James Rhodes' help creates a grey and bulky suit of armor (similar to the original Iron Man armor that Stark and Yinsen created in the comics) in order to escape from caves. After returning to Stark Industries in America, Stark reveals to Rhodey that he had previously used his company's resources to create several multi-use armors (including the Hulkbuster armor, the War Machine armor, and Ultimate Iron Man's armor) that he had been keeping in storage until the time was right to reveal them to the public. Stark first uses his Underwater suit to fight off the Elementals, destroying one while sustaining minor damage to the suit. Stark subsequently uses a red-and-yellow suit (resembling Iron Man's standard armor) to destroy two Elementals in a volcano, although there was severe damage to his suit. When he returns to China, Stark returns to using his grey suit to fight the last Elemental, an army of Terracotta soldiers, a giant dragon, and even the Mandarin.

Television

1994 animated series
As noted above, Iron Man's modular armor was his standard suit for his appearance in the 1990s Iron Man animated series, but with a slightly modified face plate to give it the traditional mouth-slit.  The suit was redesigned in the second season of the show, most significantly by restoring the "mouthless" appearance of the armor. (The season 1 armor appeared in a flashback early on)

The trademark of a changing armor remained a constant in the animated series, with the first season featuring the hydro-armor and deep space armor, straight from the comics.  The second season, however, was when the variant armors became a focal point of the series; the new modifications Stark made to his suit allowed it to shape-shift into different forms with specialized capabilities that could be called upon for the assorted situations he found himself in.  The hydro-armor and space armors were incorporated into this mechanism, and more armors from the comics such as the stealth armor and Hulkbuster armor were introduced.  The series also introduced an array of original situational armor designs, including:

Subterranean drill armor - brown and gold, with an arm-mounted pneumatic drill for burrowing.
Inferno armor - red and gold with pink highlights, this armor was resistant to extreme temperatures and outfitting with fire-extinguishing foam, which proved helpful in combat with Firebrand.
Samurai armor - never used in combat, this highly stylized armor was blue and grey.
Radiation armor - blue and silver armor to shield against radioactive danger, capable of firing x-ray blasts.
Lava armor - red and silver armor that can resist submergence in magma, which proved helpful when Iron Man had to recover one of the Mandarin's rings from within a volcano.
Magnetic armor - purple and silver, with the ability to generate electromagnetic pulses, once used by a microscopically reduced Iron Man to fibrillate Hawkeye's heart.
Bio-energy armor - DNA-powered red and gold armor, used against the Mandarin's anti-technology field in the two-part series finale "Hands of the Mandarin".
Hydro armor - yellow with a glass-domed helmet, is used for underwater situations.
Space armor - used to break through the Earth's atmosphere, the only thing that appears to be different is that it has a jet pack.
Stealth armor - dark gray, used to stay silent and not traceable by radar.
Destroyer armor. A miniature destroyer in odins
Trophy room. Used against Asgardians

The toyline also featured two armors which did not appear in the series; an entirely silver Arctic armor and the Silver Centurion suit, dubbed Hologram armor.

Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes
Several types of Iron Man armors were also featured in the Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes episode "Shell Games". The armors that were featured were the Mark I Armor, Stealth Armor, Hulkbuster Armor, Arctic Armor, War Machine Armor, and the Silver Centurion Armor.

Iron Man: Armored Adventures
In Iron Man: Armored Adventures, a teenage Stark initially creates the first armor completely on his own. It is similar to the movie version of the Mark III armor, with a less complex design and more red. Its level of technology is summarized by Obadiah Stane's scientists when they explain the armor is "more advanced than anything we're currently working on" and that "it's years, if not decades ahead of current technology" (Tony even mentioned in the same episode that he may have "outgeniused himself" when he made the armor). In addition to the traditional abilities of the armor (superhuman strength and durability, flight, repulsors, and the uni-beam), it is able to generate a force field around it, uses magnetic manipulation, and has other various functions, including a remote command system to enable Rhodes to control it from a separate computer terminal if Stark cannot ("Secrets and lies"), a security system to prevent people from opening it when Stark is unconscious ("Seeing Red") and a secondary wheeled transportation system that enables him  to "skate" when the flight system is damaged ("Masquerade"). It can even adapt to fit any size ("Don't Worry, Be Happy"). In "Ancient History 101", Stark even creates a pack that allows him to don the armor when and where he needs to, combined with anti-gravity devices so as to reduce the suit's weight (possibly based on how the comic version always carried his armor in his briefcase).

The armor briefly gained intelligence in Episode 14 of Season 1 "Man and Iron Man". Problems arose due to its desire to protect Stark above all (including almost killing Whiplash, as it did in the comics) - by constantly keeping him inside itself. However, like in the comics, the armor sacrificed itself in order to save Stark during a cardiac arrest.

The first variation of the armor appears in "Cold War" when he created enhanced Thermal Gauntlets for his armor and used them to help him fight Blizzard. After the fight, he talks about creating Arctic and Space Armor.

New armors then appear in various episodes:
 Silver Centurion: Red and silver, very similar to the original red and gold armor and its own comic counterpart in both appearance and abilities. Stark created it in the episode "Whip Lash", and used it in the same episode to fight the eponymous villain. The Silver Centurion armor made a cameo in "Don't Worry, Be Happy" and other episodes.
 Stealth Armor: initially similar to the red and gold armor, but with a different chest plate and lights on the sides. First seen and used in "Field Trip". It allows Stark to become invisible and undetectable to cameras and sensors, including those used by Stark International. Unfortunately, this function eventually burns up the power cells after a short period of time. The armor returned in "Panther's Prey" with a new design that is almost completely a bluish-black with red lights on the sides (more like its comic design). This version made several cameos in later episodes and was shown exploding in "Tales of Suspense (Part One)", though a rebuilt one was used in season 2. At the end of "Iron vs Titanium", Stark upgraded the armor with better weapons and stealth gear.
 Hulkbuster Armor: A heavy-duty armor designed for maximum strength and endurance at the cost of reduced mobility. It has the ability to redirect energy shot at it and has powerful versions of the repulsors and uni-beam as well as missiles and shoulder mounted Gatling laser blasters. First used to take on the Crimson Dynamo in "Seeing Red" when Obadiah Stane redesigned and weaponized it and sent it after Iron Man. Stark later used it in "Uncontrollable" to fight the Hulk (a reference to its comic roots). The armor was later shown exploding in "Tales of Suspense (Part One)". Its designs were later used to create Firepower in "Armor Wars" (Stark refers to the suit by name in this episode). It has a slight resemblance to the X-Men villain Juggernaut. Stark later used the rebuilt armor to fight the Iron Monger in "Heavy Mettle". It appears again in the episode "Rage of the Hulk", in which Stark wears it over his regular armor, before it is severely damaged by the Hulk.
 Space Armor: A mouth-less, black and gold armor that has all of the same weapons systems as Stark's standard armor. However, this armor also has extended life-support capabilities and an expanded propulsion system on the back (twin thrusters) for long-term flight and for flying into and maneuvering through space. Stark mentions making space armor at the end of "Cold War" and used it for the first time in "Fun with Lasers" against the Living Laser. It was later worn by Stark's father, Howard Stark, in the season 2 finale.
 Arctic Armor: A white and gold armor that contains additional systems that project thermal energy from Iron Man's gauntlets and uni-beam. Also, Stark said the Mark II armor's sonic disrupters were adapted from this suit. It has greater life-support functions and generally resists freezing temperatures. This special suit is equipped for long-range flight. Stark mentioned making arctic armor at the end of "Cold War" and used it in "Best Served Cold" against Blizzard.
 War Machine Armor: Whereas Stark created the Iron Man armor as a multi-environment suit for exploration and rescue, the War Machine armor was created for fighting. The War Machine is as fast as the Mark I Armor, but it has numerous weapons, more powerful and bulkier than the normal armor. Equipped with more powerful versions of the Repulsors and Uni-Beam, the War Machine also sports three shoulder mounted missile launchers as well as wrist-mounted machine guns and a shoulder mounted Gatling laser rifle. While Iron Man is red, War Machine is grey. The War Machine first appeared in the two-part season finale "Tales of Suspense", where Rhodes uses it to bring the Mark I Armor to Stark and help him against the Mandarin and Fin Fang Foom. Rhodey has since frequently used the suit throughout season 2.
 Iron Man Mark II Armor: In the second season of series, Stark creates a more powerful suit of Iron Man Armor. Its design possibly originated from the Extremis Armor from the comics and the first season's Silver Centurion Armor. In addition to the enhanced versions of all the systems from the Mark I Armor, it also has wrist mounted flame blasters, shoulder-mounted missile launchers, sonic disrupters (Stark mentions they were adapted from the Arctic Armor) and more powerful repulsors and Uni-Beam. Starting with the episode "Extremis", Stark controls the Mark II using his Extremis abilities.
 Rescue Armor: Also known as the Stark Solutions X-51 Stealth Infiltrator Armor, was created by Stark for Pepper Potts. Essentially an upgraded version of the Stealth armor, but with better Repulsors, the Uni-beam, Energy Grenades and Laser Spark blasters, and just like the Stealth Armor, it has a stealth mode equipped inside it. The suit was given to Pepper at the start of the episode "Dragonseed" as an early birthday present. The armor is recolored purple and white; rather than in the comics, where the color is crimson and silver. In addition, it is more feminine looking than the comic version.
Hyperpulse Mark 9 Armor: A highly advanced Iron Man armor worn by Andros Stark of the year 2099, that looks like the Cosmic Armor from the comics. This armor utilizes Time Travel capabilities, Ultra-Repulsor Blasts, runs on Extremis 16.5 and can create hard light Holographic photos. Andros's AI for this armor is JARVIS. Through the advanced technology of this armor, Andros alone could take on the combined might of Iron Man, War Machine, Hawkeye, and SHIELD. However, being that Andros prevented the creation of the Vortex Virus, it is unknown if this armor still exists in the future. The Hyperpulse Mark 9 only appears in the episode Iron Man 2099.

The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes
In The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes series, in which Iron Man is the co-leader of the Avengers, his standard armors are based on the ones in the film series. In "The Kang Dynasty", he even made special suits for the Avengers to use in the space battle against Kang, excluding the Hulk (who only needed a breathing mask) and Black Panther (who was still in Wakanda).

His current armored suits give him the standard superhuman strength and durability, flight, repulsors and the unibeam projector. They also have energy shields, an electromagnetic pulse generator, arm-mounted cannons and projectile launchers, various tools like a drill or detachable hip tasers, and can absorb and release energy.

Additional armors from the comics that were shown in the series are:
Mark I Armor (also based on the movie version, but with full flight capability, repulsors, and unibeam; first seen in "Ultron-5")
Mark II Armor (first seen in "The Ultron Imperative")
Mark VI Armor (first seen in "Breakout, Part 1")
Mark VII Armor (his standard armor in Season 1, the design of this armor is the same as the Mark VI Armor; first seen in "Breakout, Part 2")
Mark IX Armor (his main armor in Season 2. The new suit is based on the Extremis armor and/or the Mark VI from Iron Man 2; first seen in "Alone Against A.I.M.")
Classic Armor (first seen in "The Ultron Imperative")
Silver Centurion Armor (first seen in "The Ultron Imperative")
Hulkbuster Armor (a headless exterior unit over his standard suit; first seen in "Everything is Wonderful")
Hulkbuster Armor II (a bulky suit that looks like the mainstream Hulkbuster armor; first seen in "The Deadliest Man Alive")
Space Armor (first seen in "The Kang Dynasty")
Arctic Armor (first seen in "Casket of Ancient Winters")
Stealth Armor (first seen in "The Ultron Imperative")
Thorbuster Armor (an Asgardian Iron Man suit that was built in Asgard by Stark and Eitri the Dwarf using uru metal, making its repulsors similar to Mjolnir's lightning; first seen in "A Day Unlike Any Other")

Marvel Anime
The Iron Man anime series features an Iron Man armor similar to the movie's Mark III armor, except that in the anime the armor is only shown to be equipped with the repulsors, unibeam, and mini-rockets. Plus, instead of J.A.R.V.I.S. as the suit's AI; It has a female-voiced computer named "Computer" that sounds similar to the AI in the suit(s) of Iron Man Armored Adventures.

The plot of the series involves Stark traveling to Japan to build an ARC station and also to test a new armor: Iron Man Dio. Stark intends to mass-produce Dio and then retire as Iron Man. The Dio chest power core resembles the one on the Extremis Armor, but the armor is colored blue and silver rather than red and gold. Dio's head is also slightly redesigned from the typical Iron Man armor with curved features on its faceplate. The Dio armor is stolen in the first episode of the series, and Stark is forced to fight the Dio armor repeatedly over the series. Stark asserts the Dio Armor is a knock-off of the real Iron Man armor, but Dio is demonstrated as being equal to or surpassing Stark's standard armor in terms of performance. Maybe it is because the armor's performance depends on how good the pilot is.

The SDF later create a suit of armor called "Ramon Zero", used by Captain Nagato Sakurai. It resembles a samurai's armor. The Japanese armor appears to have a red pentagon-shaped ARC reactor, is armed with powerful swords, and also uses repulsors and missiles in combat.

Yinsen, revealed to still be alive and piloting the Dio Armor, builds an army of autonomous drones called Iron Man Sigma. These drones resemble the Dio Armor, except the Sigma armor is colored army camouflage.

Iron Man: Rise of Technovore
In Iron Man: Rise of Technovore, Tony Stark dons an armor that could possibly resemble his Marvel NOW! armor from the comics, but with even less gold color and a predominant red instead of black. The abilities of the armor are pretty much the standard, namely extreme physical strength and speed, repulsors, unibeam, and a suitcase transformation module. Its unique feature is the extra thrusters on its back and feet and the small, retractable wings on the shoulder pads. Stark appears with the same armor in the follow-up anime movie Avengers Confidential: Black Widow & Punisher.

Ultimate Spider-Man
In the animated series Ultimate Spider-Man, the episode "The Iron Octopus" reveals several prior suits developed by Stark:
Mark I Armor 
Mark II Armor
Mark III Armor
Hulkbuster Armor
Classic Armor

Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. 
In the animated series Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H., the episode "Wheels of Fury" reveals several prior suits developed by Stark:

War Machine Armor 
Mark I Armor 
Sliver Centurion Armor
Stealth Armor

Avengers Assemble
In the animated series, Avengers Assemble, Iron Man battles alongside the other Avengers. Iron Man reveals that he has made numerous armors in the episode "The Avengers Protocol Part 2". In season 2, his main armor looks slightly modified, with smaller shoulder plates and a more "movie-style" detailed helmet. Its prehensile capabilities are shown more prominently and now it has a suitcase module. It is currently unknown which model is this suit. In season 5, Black Panther's Quest, (partly due to the fact that the animation style has changed) Iron Man's armor has become sleeker, resembling an amalgamation of the Bleeding Edge and Model-Prime armors from the comics and retaining the "holographic" activation style from Season 4:
Mark XLIX Armor (first seen in "The Avengers Protocol Part 1")
Mark L Armor (his main armor, its design is similar to the Mark XLIX Armor, first seen in "The Avengers Protocol Part 2")
"Rubber Ducky" Armor (undersea armor; first seen in "Depth Charge")
"Herald" Armor (the Mark L seemingly infused with cosmic powers by Galactus, first seen in "Guardians and Space Knights")
Mark I Armor (first seen in "Exodus" as part of the show's incarnation of the "Iron Legion")
"Hulkbuster" Armor (first seen in "Exodus" as part of the show's incarnation of the "Iron Legion")
War Machine Armor (first seen in a cameo appearance in "The Avengers Protocol Part 1", later remote controlled in "Exodus" as part of the show's incarnation of the "Iron Legion")
Iron Patriot Armor (probably retrieved after Norman Osborn became the Green Goblin again in "Ultimate Spider-Man"; first seen in "Exodus" as part of the show's incarnation of the "Iron Legion")
Stealth Armor (black and gold armor, resembling Iron Man's Marvel NOW! armor from the comics; first seen in "Exodus" as part of the show's incarnation of the "Iron Legion")
Undersea Armor II (a new, dark-colored armor resembling the Mark XXXVII "Hammerhead" from Iron Man 3; first seen in "Beneath the Surface")
Iron Kid Armor (an armor worn by the de-aged Tony, based on designs he made when he was 8 years old. It resembles a small version of his classic armor with the horned visor; first seen in "The Age of Tony Stark")
Silver Centurion Armor (an adaptation of the classic red/silver armor from the comics and the Mark XXXIII from Iron Man 3; first seen in the Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. episode "Wheels of Fury")
Asgardian Buster Armor (an armor which resembles Stark's Uru Armor from the 2011 crossover event "Fear Itself". It was taken over by Ultron; first seen in "Avengers Disassembled")
A red/gold armor that resembles the Mark VI from Iron Man 2, which was under the control of Ultron (first seen in "Avengers Disassembled")
A red/gold armor that resembles the Marvel NOW! Space Armor MK III from the comics. It was controlled by Ultron against the Avengers (first seen in "Avengers Disassembled")
Mark II (A metallic silver armor, where the design of his current armor probably came from, also with prehensile capabilities; first seen in "Terminal Velocity")
"New Frontiers" Armor (a massive, enormous armor resembling Ultimate Iron Man's armor from the Ultimate Comics, which even though untested, was deployed to face Thanos head-on; first seen in "Avengers World")
New "Hulkbuster" Armor (a nearly identical armor to the Mark XLIV from Avengers: Age of Ultron, repainted green and grey by Bruce Banner to battle the Steel Corps. During the episode "World War Hulk" it is shown Iron Man had made each Avenger (except for Thor) their own variation, meant to work with their personal abilities; first seen in "Dehulked" and later in "Seeing Double" with its proper colors)
Omega Armor (a black, red and gold armor that Tony Stark is supposed to build in the future, in Kang's timeline; first seen in "Into the Future")
A blue heavy-duty armor resembling the Mark XXXVIII "Igor" from Iron Man 3 (first seen in the Guardians of the Galaxy episode "Stayin' Alive")
"Marsha" (a copper-colored truck modified by Stark to transform into a blocky, robotic armor, while he was hiding in No-Tech Land; first seen in the episode "Beyond")
"Secret Wars" Armor (Stark's main armor in season 4. It looks like an amalgamation of Iron Man's armors from Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Infinity War, with heavy artillery, fully retractable helmet and a holographic assembly system; first seen in the episode "Underworld")
 Mark 59A Armor (similar to the main Iron Man armor in Season 5, but built with a titanium reinforced hardshell and a modulating force bubble, an "anti-Panther" device as Stark calls it, to fight the Black Panther;first seen in "The Vibranium Curtain: Part 1")
 Panther Buster Armor (a red and gold armor, much like his main one, but bulkier and taller, with a different helmet, chestplate and arc reactor, which comprises the central circular reactor and multiple, small light-up panels. The armor is equipped with a prototype triple pulse generator, a laser net and a pair of retractable blasters mounted on the back; first seen in "The Vibranium Curtain: Part 1")

Iron Man and Hulk: Heroes United
In this direct-to-video team-up feature, Tony Stark displays three armors. His initial armor, the 'Mark VI', is a slightly bulky hypervelocity armor with a circular unibeam lens. It is somewhat reminiscent of the cinematic Mark III, but with a less complex paint job and more gold color. It is first seen battling a Hulkbuster armor run by J.A.R.V.I.S. in a training exercise. This time, Stark does not wear the Hulkbuster, instead giving the torso armor and the gauntlets to Hulk for extra protection against Zzzax. Stark's final armor is the 'Mark VII', an untested prototype which has better chances of defending against Zzzax. The armor clearly resembles the cinematic Mark VI, with grey plating on the knees and arms, but with a pentagonal unibeam instead of triangular one. The Mark VII is Tony's main and only armor in the follow-up animated movie Iron Man and Captain America: Heroes United. While there was also a Stealth armor, it was stolen and worn by Taskmaster.

Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers
In Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers, Iron Man's armor is almost identical to the cinematic Mark VI, although the name of this model is not stated in the series. Its weaponry and abilities are the standard, with flight capabilities, repulsor rays, missiles, and the unibeam. When Akira, Tony's partner, inputs the hidden command 'X-W-1-0-1-Alpha-7', Iron Man can unleash his 'Ultimate Unibeam' attack. Because Stark is trapped inside a DISK (Digital Identity Securement Kit), he is always seen in his armor. In episode 28, Iron Man gains the Build Up Plate, an extra piece of armor worn over his regular one, which grants him more firepower thanks to his Final Repulsor attack.

Marvel Future Avengers
The standard Iron Man armor featured in Marvel Future Avengers bears a striking resemblance to the Mark XLVI from Captain America: Civil War. The suit has prehensile abilities, shown when Tony Stark is able to control a gauntlet individually and then the rest of the pieces form up on him, completing the whole armor. Two additional modular add-ons were shown during the series: the Hulkbuster armor, an add-on donned over his regular armor that looks exactly like the Mark XLIV Hulkbuster from Avengers: Age of Ultron, and the Booster Unit, an add-on with a pair of thrusters and multiple arc reactors on the chestplate and shoulders that enables Iron Man to reach extremely high speeds during flight. The main operating system of the armor is FRIDAY.

Marvel's Spider-Man
Two different armors are shown in the series, the Mark 49 and 50. The Mark 49 appears to be based on the other armors in the franchise. The Mark 50, however, is mainly red with a gold face mask and collar bone, with a prehensile system. According to Tony, it can act as the central unit to an Iron Legion. Both the Mark 49 and 50 debuted (Mark 49 was destroyed by Ghost) in the episode Stark Expo.

Film

Iron Man's armors feature prominently in several films set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
