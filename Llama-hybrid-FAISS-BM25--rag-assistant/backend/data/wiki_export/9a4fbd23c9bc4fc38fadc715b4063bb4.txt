The Southbridge District High School was opened in 1903 and used some of the Primary School buildings. It continued with the Primary and High school merged until 23 October 1924 when the buildings were destroyed by a suspicious fire. The Southbridge District High School was rebuilt on the original site, whilst the Primary School rebuilt on the opposite side of the street.
