Geography

The Alazeya is formed at the confluence of the Nelkan and Kadylchan rivers in the slopes of the Alazeya Plateau. It crosses roughly northwards through the tundra meandering among the flat, marshy areas of the Kolyma Lowland, part of the greater East Siberian Lowland. Finally the Alazeya drains into the Kolyma Bay of the East Siberian Sea, close to Logashkino. The river freezes in late September through early October and stays icebound until late May through early June. There are more than 24,000 lakes in its basin.

Tributaries
The biggest tributaries of the Alazeya are the  long Rassokha and  long Buor-Yuryakh from the left, as well as the  long Sloboda River and the  long Buor-Yuryakh from the right.
