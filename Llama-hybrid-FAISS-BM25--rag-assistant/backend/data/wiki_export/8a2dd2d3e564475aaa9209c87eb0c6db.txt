Georgia's 13th congressional district is a congressional district in the U.S. state of Georgia. The district is currently represented by Democrat David Scott, though the district's boundaries have been redrawn following the 2010 census, which granted an additional congressional seat to Georgia.  The first election using the new district boundaries (listed below) were the 2012 congressional elections.

The district is located in the southern and western portions of the Atlanta metropolitan area and includes the cities of Austell, Jonesboro, Mableton, Douglasville, Stockbridge, and Union City, as well as the southern fourth of Atlanta itself.
