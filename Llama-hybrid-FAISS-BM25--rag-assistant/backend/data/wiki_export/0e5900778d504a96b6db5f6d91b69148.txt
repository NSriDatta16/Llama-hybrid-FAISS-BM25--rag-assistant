Sandford Park School is an independent, non-denominational, co-educational secondary school, located in Ranelagh, Dublin, Ireland.  It was founded in 1922.

History 
The school was founded in 1922 by Alfred Le Peton, who served as its first headmaster. Le Peton had previously served as joint headmaster of Earlsfort House School alongside Ernest Exshaw. It was decided to move the school from the terraced city-centre property of Earlsfort House to the 2.5 hectare Ranelagh property of Sandford Park, originally designed in 1894 by Thomas Edmund Hudman for James P. Pile, a property developer and Hudman’s brother-in-law. The school was founded as non-denominational, to contrast with the majority of schools in Ireland at the time, which had religious patronages. In its first year of teaching, the school had enrolled fifty-three boys. Le Peton resigned as headmaster in 1925.

In 2013, the school began accepting enrolment for girls in all year groups, and in 2021 there were 429 students attending in total, of whom 171 were girls.
