Sergio Pascual Vargas Parra (Villa Altagracia, Dominican Republic, March 15, 1960) is a performer of merengue and bolero, who was very popular in the 80s and 90s, during the "golden age of merengue" and today remains active as one of the leading figures in Dominican merengue. His brothers, Kaki and Johnny, are also interpreters of the genre and have been by his side for much of their respective musical careers.

Vargas was a deputy for the Dominican Liberation Party representing his people Villa Altagracia in the period 2006–2010.

Career 
Known as El negrito de Villa, Vargas participated in the Festival of the Voice organized by the Dominican musician Rafael Solano, where he finished second. Two years later in 1982, he became part of the Dionis Fernández orchestra. In this orchestra, Sergio came to perform great hits like "The designers", "To the rhythm of the night", "A man and a woman", among others. After this, Sergio went on to reinforce the orchestra "Los Hijos del Rey" as lead vocalist. This orchestra in its beginnings was led by Fernando Villalona and Raulín Rosendo. It was in this group that its popularity began to grow, so much so that the group had fan clubs in Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Panama and the East Coast of the United States.

In 1986 Sergio released his first LP under the Karen Records label. This LP includes the single "La quiero a morir" (I Love Her to Death), which is the Spanish version of "Je l'aime à mourir" by the French singer Francis Cabrel. In 1987 he recorded another album with Los Hijos del Rey titled "the earth quaked", with which he achieved great success. At the moment Sergio launched as a soloist, most of the musicians left with him, except for Diómedes Nuñez and shortly after Orvis García. The arrangements for this production are by Sonny Ovalles and his pianist Juan Valdez. The singles of this production are "Ciclón (indoor party)", "Marola", "On the other side of the sun", "Bamboleo", "This humble house", "Days of June" and "Black Pearl".
