Lajos Aulich (25 August 1793 – 6 October 1849) was the third Minister of War of the Hungarian State.

Originally a professional soldier and lieutenant colonel in the Austrian Army, during the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 however, he sided with the revolutionaries.

During the Spring Campaign, Aulich commanded an army, which gathered and prepared for the great Battle of Isaszeg.   
 
He became a honvédség (Hungarian Army) colonel on 2 October 1848, and was named General at the Battle of Kápolna. He was a stickler for the rules: when Lajos Kossuth sent him requests, he answered: "please work through Görgey." Due to his gout, he was relieved of field duty and appointed Minister of War on 14 July 1849. He was executed less than three months later as one of the 13 Martyrs of Arad.
