The weapons master, sometimes credited as the armorer, weapons specialist, weapons handler, weapons wrangler, or weapons coordinator, is a film crew specialist that works with the property master, director, actors, stunt coordinator and script supervisor. The weapons master is specifically responsible for maintaining control of any prop weapons, including firearms, knives, swords, bows, and staff weapons.

Duties
In some areas the weapons master must be a licensed armourer when firearms are used as props.

As of 1993, when Brandon Lee was killed by a gun believed to be loaded with blanks, the rules of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers required:

 Someone certified for the weapon in use be present at all times
 Firearms must be checked before and after each take
 Firearms must be cleaned daily
 Firearms must be stored securely by the props master when not in use
 Loaded guns must never be pointed at anyone
 Protective clothing must be worn by everyone nearby when blanks are fired
 If firearms are to be fired directly at the camera, a plexiglass shield must be erected
 Only the person certified for the weapon or someone under their direct supervision may hand a weapon to an actor
As of 2021, when Helyna Hutchins was killed by a gun believed to be unloaded, the Industry-Wide Labor-Management Safety Committee's guidelines stressed that blanks can kill, that all firearms were to be treated as loaded and that "live" ammunition was never to be brought onto any set. According to Local 44, a union that represents props masters, no members were on set when the shooting occurred.

According to Mike Papac, an experienced weapons master, a firearm should not be handed to an actor until film is rolling and should be taken from the actor as soon as the director calls "cut" and there should "never, ever, ever [be] any live ammo on the set. Never. Under no circumstances". According to armorer Larry Zanoff, after the director calls "cut", "nobody moves until I gather up every gun and yell 'The weapons are cold.'"

The UK has stricter laws in relation to weapons on set and the Metropolitan Police in co-ordination with the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) they have published two information leaflets for film sets in relation to weapons and stunts ETIS17  and ETIS20 

Some weapons masters (particularly in lower-budget productions) are also responsible for training the actors.  Prior to the 1980s, weapons were frequently the responsibility of the property master or their assistant, but since then, it has become increasingly common in the industry for the property master to a hire a dedicated weapons master in order to reduce the burden on themselves.  However, it is still common for the property master to double as the weapons master, as a cost-saving measure, on productions where National Firearms Act-regulated firearms (such as machine guns or sawed-off shotguns) are not being used.

Prop weapons accidents 
Charles Chandler, an extra on the set of The Captive (1915), was shot in the head and killed after another extra neglected to remove a live round from his rifle after a previous scene was shot with live rounds. Director Cecil DeMille in his autobiography wrote that he had told the extras to reload with blanks. Blanche Sweet said that DeMille's pursuit of realism had led to the use of live ammunition on set.

House Peters Sr. suffered serious burns to his face and hands when a prop pistol exploded upon being fired during shooting of The Girl of the Golden West (1915).

In 2021 Halyna Hutchins was killed and Joel Souza was injured on the set of Rust when Alec Baldwin fired a gun thought to be safe at the camera they were standing behind. Alec Baldwin and armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed were charged with involuntary manslaughter in 2023.
