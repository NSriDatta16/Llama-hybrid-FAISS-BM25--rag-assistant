"Twist" is a song by English electronic music duo Goldfrapp from their second studio album, Black Cherry (2003). It was released on 3 November 2003 as the album's third single. The song received positive reviews from music critics and was a minor success in the United Kingdom, peaking at number 31 on the UK Singles Chart. In the United States, the single reached number 18 on Billboards Hot Dance Singles Sales chart.

In an interview with New Beats, Alison Goldfrapp described the genesis of the song:

It's a sort of sexual fantasy that I had about a boy who worked at the fairground, who I lusted after. He was in control and I wasn't cause I was sat on the waltzer and he was the one that was spinning it around and—I don't know—it's sort of lust, adolescent, awakening, smells and noise and dirt. That's what "Twist" is about.
