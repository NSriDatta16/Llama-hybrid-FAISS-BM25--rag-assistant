The Academy of Interactive Entertainment (AIE) is an Australian video games and computer animation school. Founded in 1996, it was one of the world's first institutions to offer qualifications in these industries. The AIE provides courses covering CGI, animation, video game asset creation and games programming. Campuses are located in Canberra, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, and an online campus.  The Australian ABC has said that the AIE "is one of Australia's most awarded 3D animation, game design and visual FX educators".

Campuses

Canberra
The first AIE campus was established in Watson, a suburb of Canberra ACT, in 1996. In 2015 AIE submitted a proposal to the ACT government to transform the old Watson high school site – on which AIE is currently located – into a large education precinct, at an estimated cost of $111 million. The proposed development will enable the production of feature films, along with facilities to create special effects for films and games.  On site, there will be accommodation providing for 400 students.

Adelaide
AIE Adelaide has developed a four-player game which is projected onto the facade of a former cinema with four artists pitted against each other to paint platforms as they compete to reach a painting at the top of the screen.

Partnerships
AIE partners with other organisations including Microsoft, with Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, with Nnooo and the University of Canberra.
