Ghent Kangri (or Mount Ghent, Ghaint I) is a high peak near the north end of the Saltoro Mountains, a subrange of the Karakoram range. It is located west of the Siachen Glacier near the Actual Ground Position Line between India and Pakistan.

Ghent Kangri was first climbed on 4 June 1961, by Wolfgang Axt, a member of an Austrian expedition led by Erich Waschak, via the West Ridge. He climbed solo above the high camp.

According to the Himalayan Index, there have been three subsequent ascents of the peak, in 1977, 1980, and 1984.
