Sandy McCarthy (born June 15, 1972) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey right winger who played 11 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Calgary Flames, Tampa Bay Lightning, Philadelphia Flyers, Carolina Hurricanes, New York Rangers and Boston Bruins.

Playing career

McCarthy grew up playing minor hockey in the Barrie Minor Hockey Association with the Flyers rep program.  He played Jr.C. hockey at age 15 with the Midland Centennials before elevating to the Hawkesbury Hawks Jr.A. club of the Central Junior Hockey League.

In May of 1989, McCarthy was selected by the Niagara Falls Thunder in the 11th round (163rd overall) of the OHL Priority Selection.  After not being signed by the Thunder, McCarthy's rights were waived to the QMJHL Laval Titan where he starred for 3 years - including a trip to the Memorial Cup in Hamilton in 1990.

Sandy McCarthy was selected by the Calgary Flames in the third round (52nd overall) of the 1991 NHL Entry Draft. He began playing hockey in the Georgian Bay Junior C Hockey League with the Midland Centennials and the Central Junior A Hockey League for the Hawkesbury Hawks. As a power forward, McCarthy played for the QMJHL Laval Titan in the 1989–90 season before being drafted by the Calgary Flames. He played one last season with the Titan. His next stop was during the 1992–93 season for the IHL's Salt Lake Golden Eagles. Sandy throughout his career with the Flames played the role as the enforcer, with many major fights.

While playing in the NHL, Sandy McCarthy became well known for incidents surrounding racial slurs. In the year 1998, McCarthy was accused of racial insensitivity in the form of gestures against African-American player Peter Worrell. Along with teammate Darcy Tucker, allegations were denied and the victim, Worrell, also confirmed he had not seen or heard any racial insults made towards him from either of the Tampa Bay players. McCarthy stated that growing up half aboriginal and half black, he would "never go there" because he had to go through racial taunts growing up. This incident occurred during a game against the Florida Panthers while McCarthy was with Tampa Bay Lightning in 1998.

The following season in 1999, McCarthy was playing for the Philadelphia Flyers when he stated that Toronto Maple Leafs player Tie Domi made racial slurs towards him. Domi insisted this was a false accusation against him and went on to say he had no respect for McCarthy and would never partake in a fight with him. An NHL investigation was also conducted that reinforced Domi's denial.

As his time in the NHL progressed, he switched from his role as a power forward in junior hockey to more of a pressure player, offensively as well as defensively.

McCarthy remained in Calgary for the next five years before being traded, in 1998, to the Tampa Bay Lightning, for a short stay. His next stop was with the Philadelphia Flyers for the next two seasons then a brief stint for the Carolina Hurricanes. McCarthy then moved on to the New York Rangers in August 2000 where he scored a career season high 11 goals. The next season, he scored a career high in points with 23. 

One of his more infamous fights happened while a member of the New York Rangers. In a game on November 8, 2001, against the New York Islanders, McCarthy challenged defenceman Eric Cairns to a fight which Cairns refused. Later in the shift, McCarthy scored and as McCarthy celebrated, Cairns gave him a jab to the jaw, which led to a fight between Cairns and Steve McKenna.  While Cairns was in the penalty box, he was  called chicken by Theoren Fleury who flapped his arms like a chicken to suggest that Cairns was afraid to fight McCarthy, who flexed his biceps and looked at Cairns. The next time the two teams played against each other on December 21, 2001 Cairns fought McCarthy and beat him.

McCarthy signed with the Boston Bruins during the summer of 2003 then was claimed off waivers at the 2004 trade deadline by the Rangers.

In 2012, McCarthy was inducted into the Barrie Sports Hall of Fame in Barrie, Ontario.

In his 735 games, 15 season NHL career, McCarthy recorded 72 goals, 76 assists and 1554 penalty minutes. In his 11 seasons in the NHL he made just over 7 million dollars, increasing his yearly amount each year he played.

Coaching career 
After 15 seasons in the NHL, McCarthy changed his focus from professional hockey to becoming an assistant head coach with the Woodstock Slammers, a Junior A team in New Brunswick. Andrew McCain, President of the Junior A team stated McCarthy was a "motivator who had strong beliefs in detection and discipline" which would help the team reach their goal of making it to the Royal Bank cup. Since 2015, McCarthy has remained a part of the coaching staff of the team and has become the head coach.

Personal life
McCarthy's father is Black, while his mother is a white woman from Newfoundland. He claims that his mother also has Mi'kmaq ancestry.
