Corridors of Power is the second solo studio album by Northern Irish guitarist Gary Moore, released in October 1982.

Background
The album contains a cover of the Free song "Wishing Well". The track "End of the World" features Jack Bruce of Cream sharing lead vocals with Moore. Moore would later join with Bruce again on the Bruce-Baker-Moore project in 1993. The album also features then-former Deep Purple drummer Ian Paice, ex-Whitesnake bassist Neil Murray and former Uriah Heep singer John Sloman on backing vocals, with contributions from keyboardists Tommy Eyre and Don Airey, drummer Bobby Chouinard and bassist Mo Foster. 

The first 25,000 vinyl copies of Corridors of Power came with a bonus EP featuring three live tracks recorded at the Marquee, London on 25 August 1982.

Japanese rock singer Mari Hamada covered "Love Can Make a Fool of You" (Retitled as "Love, Love, Love") on her 1985 album Rainbow Dream. A far bluesier version of the song also showed up on the posthumous Gary Moore album How Blue Can You Get. As a nod to Corridors of Power, American guitarist Jeff Kollman named his 2012 solo album Silence in the Corridor, the title track of which is a tribute to Moore.
