Hydrography 

Dauphin Lake is located west of Lake Manitoba and south of Lake Winnipegosis. It receives most of its waters from the west.

Mossy River Dam 
Several efforts have been made to control lake levels in the last century. In 1964, the Mossy River Dam was constructed at Terin's Landing at the outlet of the lake. The ten bay concrete stoplog structure complete with a fish ladder is operated by the Province of Manitoba. The summer target since 1993 has been 854.8 feet (260.54 m). The dam can restrict the outflow when conditions are dry and levels low but the river limits the outflow when the lake is high.

Regulation of the lake is difficult. Conditions can change very quickly. For example, a four-day rain in June 1947 produced an estimated peak inflow of . At normal levels, the Mossy River can only take out about .

Tributaries 
 
Tributaries of Dauphin Lake include the Turtle River, Kerosene Creek, Ochre River, Edwards Creek Drain, Vermillion River, Wilson River, Valley River, Mowat Creek and the Mink River.
