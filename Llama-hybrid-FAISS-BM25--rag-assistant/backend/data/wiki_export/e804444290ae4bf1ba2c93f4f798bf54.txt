The H family is a line of automobile 60° V6 engines from Suzuki. Ranging in displacement from , the H family was a modern all-aluminum engine with dual overhead cams, 24 valves, and direct fuel injection. It was co-developed with Mazda and Toyota, which used a similar design in their 2.0 L KF V6 and the Toyota VZ engine. The H family was introduced in 1994 with the H20, but Suzuki, Toyota and Mazda's designs diverged greatly with the former increasing displacement and the latter experimenting with alternative induction technologies and smaller engine sizes.

The H27A is a modern version of the H25A, a reliable motor displacing , coming from an  bore and stroke (VVT added in 2006). The engine is tuned to achieve most of its torque at low revs at the expense of raw power at high revs, making the engine very responsive in day-to-day driving. It produces  at 5,350 rpm and  at 3,300 rpm.

Applications:

2000 - 2009 XL-7
