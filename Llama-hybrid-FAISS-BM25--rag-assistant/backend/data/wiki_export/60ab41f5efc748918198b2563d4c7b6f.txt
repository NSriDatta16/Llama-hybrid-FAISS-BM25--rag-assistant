Ain't Gonna Worry is an album by the American country music singer Crystal Gayle. Released on July 2, 1990, it marked the end of her run of Billboard album chart appearances (though a Greatest Hits album would make the Top 100 Country Albums chart in 2007). The album was Gayle's first and only album for the Capitol Records label.

Though the album itself failed to chart, one of its tracks, "Never Ending Song of Love", reached number 72 on the Country Singles chart. It also included covers of "Once in a Very Blue Moon" (although writers Pat Alger and Eugene Levine had Gayle in mind when first penning the song) and "Faithless Love", songs previously associated with Nanci Griffith and Linda Ronstadt respectively. "What He's Doing Now" would later be a hit for its co-writer, Garth Brooks (as "What She's Doing Now").
