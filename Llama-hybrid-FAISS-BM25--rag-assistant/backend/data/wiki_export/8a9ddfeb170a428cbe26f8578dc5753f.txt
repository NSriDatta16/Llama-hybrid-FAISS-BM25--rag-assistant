North Caicos is the second-largest island in the Turks and Caicos Islands (after Middle Caicos). To the west, the Caicos Cays (the closest is Parrot Cay) link to Providenciales. To the east, it is separated from Middle Caicos by Juniper Hole, a narrow passage that can accommodate only small boats. A 1600-m (1-mile) causeway connects North Caicos to Middle Caicos.

Geography
North Caicos has an area of 116.4 km² within the high water mark, and of 207.1 km² within the shoreline. The difference between the two values is not accounted for as land area.  Sights on or near the island include Cottage Pond, Wade's Green Plantation, Flamingo Pond Overlook, and the tiny Three Marys Cays (0.64 ha) approximately 20 metres off the northwestern shore. North Caicos is 19 km (12 miles) from Providenciales, which offers daily ferry trips to the island.

Together with Parrot Cay (4.9 km²), and Bay Cay off the eastern shore (at 12.9 km² the sixth-largest island of the territory) and a few more uninhabited offshore cays, it forms the North Caicos District, with an area of 144.9 km².

Population
The population was 1,312 at the 2012 census.
