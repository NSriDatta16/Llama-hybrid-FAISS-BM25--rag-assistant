In Norway 
The first ISU Championships held in Norway were the 1898 European Championships in Trondheim.

It was scheduled to host its first ISU Challenger Series event in November 2016 but the competition was cancelled. In 2010, Tatiana Volosozhar and Stanislav Morozov stated that conditions for skaters in Ukraine were poor, with only one good rink remaining. Most of Ukraine's figure skaters have come from Kyiv, Dnipro, Kharkiv, and Odesa. Western oblasts have developed few competitors due to limited ice rinks. In 2016, Uzhhorod began construction of an Olympic-sized ice rink.
