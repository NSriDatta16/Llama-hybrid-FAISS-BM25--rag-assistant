The Kolka–Karmadon rock-ice slide occurred on the northern slope of the Mount Kazbek massif in North Ossetia–Alania on 20 September 2002, following a partial collapse of the Kolka Glacier. It started on the north-northeast wall of Dzhimarai-Khokh,  above sea level, and seriously affected the valley of Genaldon and Karmadon. The resulting avalanche and mudflow killed more than 120 people, including a film crew of 27 people, among them Russian actor and director Sergei Bodrov Jr.  While this type of avalanche is not uncommon, this particular event is considered extraordinary because of several aspects.

Collapse
The main deposit settled  from the face of Dzhimarai-Khokh. A  thick chunk of the Kolka Glacier travelled  down the Karmadon Gorge and Koban Valley at over . The outflow of mud and debris measured  wide and  thick. Two villages along the gorge were under surveillance as flood waters backed up along the choked rivers. It finally came to rest in the village of Nizhniy Karmadon, burying most of the village in ice, snow, and debris. On September 25, a first round of explosives intended to break up the avalanche flow was unsuccessful in reducing flood waters lapping through the village of Gornaya Saniba. The avalanche had two distinct flows.
