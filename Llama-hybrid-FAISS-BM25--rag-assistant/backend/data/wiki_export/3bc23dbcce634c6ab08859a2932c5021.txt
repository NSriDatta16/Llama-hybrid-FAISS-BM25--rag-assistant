Capitalism and Schizophrenia () is a serial composed of two volumes, Anti-Oedipus (1972, translated in 1977) and A Thousand Plateaus (1980, translated in 1987). It was written by the French authors Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, respectively a philosopher and a psychoanalyst, during the May 1968, a period of civil unrest in France.

Deleuze's translator Brian Massumi observes that the books differ drastically in tone, content, and composition.
