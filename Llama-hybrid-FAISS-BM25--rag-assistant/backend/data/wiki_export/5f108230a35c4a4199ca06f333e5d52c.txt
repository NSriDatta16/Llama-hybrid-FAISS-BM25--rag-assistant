Markland Wood is a residential neighbourhood in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located west of the central core, in the former suburb of Etobicoke and is the westernmost residential community in Toronto along Bloor Street West.
It's located on the border of Mississauga and bounded by Etobicoke Creek to the west, Elmcrest Creek to the east, Burnhamthorpe to the North, and surrounded by the Markland Wood Golf Club; approximately 2/3 is north of Bloor Street, and 1/3 south. Markland Wood is part of the Etobicoke Centre riding for federal and provincial governments and Ward 2 for the municipal council.

History
Markland Wood, or Mark's Land, was purchased by Mark Cavotti from the Silverthorn family in September 1958. Development started in 1960 after the Conservation Authority determined the high water mark levels after Hurricane Hazel. Most of the single family houses in Markland Wood were completed by 1967, but several custom-built homes were built around Markland Drive in the following years, as well as some tract housing at the north end of Thicket Rd. in 1971â€“1972. Two condominium apartment buildings were built along the west side of Mill Road, north of Markland Drive, in the mid- to late 1970s.

The Markland Wood Homeowners Association was formed in 1962 to "Create, Foster and Maintain the Community Spirit in Markland Wood". The MWHA publishes Marklander Newsletter the oldest, continuous running, community newspaper in Toronto. It was first published in 1962 and now has 10 annual issues delivered to MWHA members' households.

On October 22, 2007, a massive fire struck the neighbourhood. New townhouses being built at 4333 Bloor Street West at Mill Road caught fire, burning the new townhouses to the ground. No one was injured.  The rebuilt collection of townhouses was again struck by fire March 8, 2008. This time around, only one townhouse was damaged. The Toronto Police Service are treating these incidents as "suspicious." In July 2008, St. Clement's Catholic Elementary School had a small fire on the side next to the townhouses around 2:00 in the morning.

In 2010/11 Markland Wood celebrated the 50 years anniversary. In 2011 the ratepayers association, Markland Homes Association changed their constitution and incorporated and is now called the Markland Wood Homeowners Association.

2012 marked the 50th anniversary of the association. At the AGM, Heritage Toronto presented the Historical Plaque to the Markland Wood community and the Silverthorn Family and Mill Farm, that now sits on the S.W. corner of Bloor Street W. and Mill Road.
