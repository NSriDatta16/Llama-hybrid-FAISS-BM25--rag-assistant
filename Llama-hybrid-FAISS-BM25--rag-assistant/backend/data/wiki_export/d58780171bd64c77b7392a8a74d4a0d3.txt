History

The South Dakota National Guard traces its history to the establishment of the Dakota Territory on March 2, 1861. Just prior to the establishment of the territory, in the 1850s, the U.S. Army had established garrisons at Fort Pierre and Fort Randall on the Missouri River. The U.S. Army detachments had been deployed to protect the settlers in Dakota from Native American tribes, but when the Civil War started, the U.S. Army withdrew most of its forces to put down the Confederate States of America. Because of this, the Territorial Governor William Jayne raised two companies of volunteer militia in December 1861, which were the predecessors of the South Dakota National Guard.

Since that historic date in 1862, the SDNG has seen combat during the Spanish-American War, World War I and II, Operation Just Cause and Operation Desert Storm. The National Guard was also called up during the Mexican Border Conflict, Korean War, Berlin Crisis and peacekeeping missions in Bosnia and Kosovo.

Use of private funding for deployment 
In June 2021, Governor Kristi Noem announced the deployment of up to 50 National Guard troops to the southern U.S. border to be funded by a private donor. The announcement was characterized as "unprecedented and unethical" by military and oversight experts.
