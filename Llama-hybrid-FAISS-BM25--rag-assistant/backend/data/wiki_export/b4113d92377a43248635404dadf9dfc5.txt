Electric Blue is the debut solo album by Erasure frontman Andy Bell, released 3 October 2005 by Sanctuary Records. The album was released in-between the Erasure albums Nightbird and Union Street. Bell toured European and American nightclubs to promote the album.

The album features fourteen tracks, co-written and produced throughout 2004 and 2005 with electronic music duo Manhattan Clique, who have worked as remixers for acts such as Moby, The B-52's, Stereophonics, Goldfrapp, Fischerspooner and Erasure. Electric Blue includes two duets with Claudia Brücken of Propaganda and another with Jake Shears of Scissor Sisters, and encompasses a variety of musical genres, most notably Giorgio Moroder-style disco, electro and house music. Upon release the album received mixed reviews, although more often than not critics were positive.

The first single, "Crazy", was released on 26 September 2005, and included club remixes from Erasure-partner Vince Clarke, plus Cicada, Manhattan Clique and King Roc. The second single, "I'll Never Fall in Love Again", was released 29 May 2006 and was remixed by Goetz, Jaded Alliance and Mr. Do. Included with this single is a non-album B-side track "Back Into the Old Routine".

"Crazy" peaked at number 35 on the UK Singles Chart and was a top-3 success on the U.S. Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. Electric Blue hit number 119 in the UK and number 12 on Billboard's Top Electronic Albums chart.
