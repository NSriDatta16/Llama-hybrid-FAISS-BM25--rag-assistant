The Povindah was a class of warrior nomadic traders in present-day Afghanistan and north-western Pakistan, who belonged chiefly to the tribes of Ghilzais Pashtuns. Their name, which designates their occupation, is derived from the same root as the Pushtu word meaning "to graze".

Occupation
They assembled every autumn on the plains east of Ghazni, with their families, flocks, herds and long strings of camels and horses, laden with the goods of Bokhara and Kandahar; and forming a caravan march through the Kakar and Waziri countries by the Zhob and Gumal passes of the Suliman Hills.
