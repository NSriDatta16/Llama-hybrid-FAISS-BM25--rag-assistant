Themes
In an interview with Idlebrain.com, Rajamouli described Chatrapathi as a "mother sentiment film", which also deals with the exploitation of immigrants who come to India from the places and live without any official identity. When questioned about similarities to the American film Scarface, he said that his father V. Vijayendra Prasad, who wrote Chatrapathi, watched Scarface and got inspired by the point of immigrants' problems, but there were no scenic resemblances between the two films.

Soundtrack

The film has seven songs composed by M. M. Keeravani. The track Gundusoodi has been reused from the song Kambangaadu from the Tamil movie Vaaname Ellai (1992) also composed by M. M. Keeravani. The song Agni Skalana was inspired from the Main Theme of the video game Myst IV: Revelation (2004) composed by Jack Wall.

Reception

Critical reception 
A reviewer from The Hindu felt that though the storyline was routine, its screenplay and direction did the trick for the film. Sify rated the film 2/5 and wrote, "a swell cast with a young action hero and add a dash of digital wizardry to the stunts and cook up an unimaginative script as an aftermath and serve it piping hot! Chatrapati works to a certain extent thanks to the tall handsome hunk Prabhas." Jeevi of Idlebrain.com observed the film's similarities with Scarface and Deewaar but opined that Chatrapati stands on its own.

Box office
The film had a 100-day run in 54 venues.
