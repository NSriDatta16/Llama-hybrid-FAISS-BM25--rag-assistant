Personal life 
D'banj married Lineo Didi Kilgrow in June 2016. He announced the birth of their son, Daniel Oyebanjo III, in May 2017; the child drowned in June 2018.

In June 2020, after D'banj had posted to social media to "say no to rape," Seyitan Babatayo accused him of raping her in 2018, saying she wanted to "[call] him out on his hypocrisy." Shortly thereafter she went missing for two days, and while she was missing posts made to her social media said the allegations had been a publicity stunt to support an upcoming D'banj single. According to The Guardian, she was found with help from the NGO Stand to End Rape (STER). She said she'd been abducted by Nigerian police, who turned her over to D'banj's management team who co-opted her social media and made the retraction posts. D'banj denied the accusations, calling them "false allegations and lies from the pit of hell." After several days Babatayo issued a statement saying she and D'banj had agreed upon a "non-monetary" settlement, saying, "I just want my peace."

On 3 July 2020, D'banj sued Babatayo for N1.5 billion. Shortly thereafter, D'banj's former manager Franklin Amudo reported that Babatayo had told him D'banj had raped her the day after the alleged rape.

Legal issues and controversies 
On 7 December 2022, D'banj, was arrested by the Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) in connection with alleged fraud. The arrest came after D'banj repeatedly ignored invitations from the ICPC to provide an explanation regarding his involvement in the alleged diversion of funds earmarked for the N-Power project.

N-Power is a component of the Social Investment Programmes (SIPs) established by the administration of ex-President Muhammadu Buhari to address unemployment and enhance social development in Nigeria.

According to reports from Premium Times, D'banj was detained by ICPC operatives on 7 December 2022 after he was compelled to surrender himself at the agency's headquarters in Abuja. It was revealed that D'banj had evaded ICPC summons for several weeks, claiming prior international engagements before his arrest.

The allegations against D'banj suggest that he conspired with certain government officials to include ghost beneficiaries in the N-Power payment scheme, diverting funds intended for genuine beneficiaries into accounts linked to him. Investigations have traced the flow of funds to accounts associated with D'banj.

Following his arrest, D'banj underwent an extensive interrogation and was subsequently detained when his request for administrative bail was turned down by ICPC officials. The Guardian newspaper has reported that the anti-graft agency is considering pressing charges against D'banj for alleged fraud and misappropriation of funds once their investigation is concluded.

These legal issues and controversies have garnered significant attention, raising concerns about accountability and transparency within the N-Power project and the involvement of high-profile individuals in alleged financial misconduct.
