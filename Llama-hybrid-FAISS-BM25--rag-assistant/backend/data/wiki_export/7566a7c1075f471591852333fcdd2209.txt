Gameplay

Uncharted Waters Online features a variety of gameplay concepts. The game can be divided into sea-based areas, land-based areas, and towns. Like most MMORPGs characters gain experience in skills and levels.

The player may choose from among 6 nationalities: England, Dutch Republic, Kingdom of France, Spanish Empire, Kingdom of Portugal, Republic of Venice. As well the player may choose from several "occupations" after choosing a basic class: adventurer, merchant, and soldier. However players can learn and upgrade skills from other classes, albeit needing more experience points. Under certain conditions a player may change their class, occupation, and nationality. Players are able to trade, explore, battle and join in live events such as the "Epic Sea Feud".

As an online game it offers Player vs. Player combat areas and factional warfare as well as socialization in the form of in-game chat and card games.

Players can discover quests with historical value such as learning about the economic decline of Venice, or the rise of England as a naval power.
