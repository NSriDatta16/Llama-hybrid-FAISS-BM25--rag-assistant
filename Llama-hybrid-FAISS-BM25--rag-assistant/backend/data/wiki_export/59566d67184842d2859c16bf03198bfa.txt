The 2004 Tour de Georgia was the second annual bicycle road racing event held in the state of Georgia, United States. The six-day, seven stage 1050 km race was held April 20 through April 25, 2004 with no winner declared for the overall title and yellow jersey, following the disqualification of the first-placed rider for using illegal drugs and practices to win. Canadian Gord Fraser (Health Net Pro Cycling Team Presented by Maxxis) claimed the points jersey for sprinters, while teammate Jason McCartney won the King of the Mountains competition for climbers. Kevin Bouchard-Hall (TIAA-CREF) won the Best Young Rider (blue jersey) competition.
