Cyril VII (1775-1872) was Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople from 1855 to 1860.

His predecessor Anthimus VI was unpopular in the church and the Holy Synod formally petitioned the Ottoman government to depose him; the government agreed and choose the new Patriarch. As such, Cyril ascended the Ecumenical throne on October 2, 1855.

He came to power during the Crimean War and witnessed the signing of Sultan Abdulmejid Iâ€™s Ottoman Reform Edict of 1856 which promised equality in education and justice to everyone, regardless of their religious beliefs.

He was not a well-educated or an energetic person. Nonetheless, he did much for His Church and people. He did his best to raise funds for the victims of an earthquake in the diocese of Prusa. He issued instructions in the sphere of marriage and family life. 

Due to the politics of the war, Cyril had a lot of enemies. He eventually resigned as Patriarch and spent the rest of his life in prayer and solitude in  Halki.

He is buried at  Hagia Triada Church in Istanbul.
