Death Metal is a 1984 split album by the bands Helloween, Hellhammer, Running Wild, and Dark Avenger. It contains the only recorded material by the German group Dark Avenger besides their 1985 demo tape.

The album offers a snapshot of the Central European metal scene during the end of the early 1980s. At that time, Running Wild had yet to develop their "pirate metal" focus and considered themselves a black metal band. Helloween had more of a thrash or speed metal sound compared to the more melodic power metal style they would soon develop. Hellhammer were the darkest and heaviest band of the foursome and would later evolve into the group Celtic Frost.

Running Wild's songs appear as Japanese bonus tracks on their 1995 album, Masquerade; Helloween's tracks appear on the second disc of the 2006 remastered and expanded edition of their 1985 album, Walls of Jericho; and Hellhammer's tracks appear on the 1990 re-issue of their 1984 EP, Apocalyptic Raids.
