History
The school opened in 1892 as Mauge Street Grammar School, taking on the name "A. R. Johnson Junior High School" in 1937. From 1945 to 1949, it served as a senior high school, and in 1956 a new building was erected to serve as the junior high school. In 1980, the school was established as an examination school. In 1980–81, A. R. Johnson Junior High School became "A. R. Johnson Health Professions High School". Under its new name, it served as a pilot program, using funds from a Magnet Implementation/Planning Grant. In 1984, feasibility studies were undertaken to introduce an engineering program at the school, which began in 1985.

On September 7, 2008, the school opened a new building that included an open-air cafeteria, an observatory deck overlooking the school's library, and its first elevator. The new building featured a dome skylight and modern layouts. The old gymnasium is currently in use as the auditorium. The expansion project was completed in 2008, and seventh and eighth graders began attending the school in August 2009. In 2015 a new wing was added for sixth graders, in August 2015 sixth graders began attending.

Background
