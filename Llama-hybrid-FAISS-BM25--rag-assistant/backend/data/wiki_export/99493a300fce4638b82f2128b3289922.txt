Crystal Serenity is a cruise ship owned by Crystal Cruises before the line went out business. Crystal Serenity was built in 2003 by Chantiers de l'Atlantique in St. Nazaire. She operated together with her older fleetmate, Crystal Symphony, offering around the world voyages.

Concept and construction
Crystal Serenity was ordered from Chantiers de l'Atlantique on 7 November 2000. The keel of Crystal Serenity was laid on 13 June 2002 and she was launched on 10 August 2002 being completed on 30 June 2003. She was formally named on 3 July 2003, by Dame Julie Andrews, in Southampton, United Kingdom.

The lead designer of Crystal Serenity was Robert Tillberg of Tillberg Design. The other designers were the Italian Garroni Designers Company, Japanese Okada & Associates, American Nix Firestone Associates and II by IV design Associates, British Stephenjohn Design and was internally designed by Brennan Beer Gorman Monk (BBGM) of New York.

In November 2018 she emerged from an extensive redesign at Lloyd Werft Bremerhaven.

Mama Lee Wachtstetter
Passenger Lee Wachtstetter, known as "Mama Lee", 88 years old in 2016, lived aboard the Crystal Serenity full-time. She was the longest permanent luxury cruise ship resident. In 2018, she reached 10 years living aboard the ship. She spent about US$170k a year to live on the ship full-time.

Ports of call
The maiden voyage of Crystal Serenity was on 7 July 2003, 4 days after her christening. It was a 14-day round-trip cruise, departing Southampton and cruising Northern Europe. During her inaugural season, Crystal Serenity held summer cruises in Europe, the Mediterranean Sea, and a transatlantic crossing. It was followed by two Caribbean/Panama Canal voyages and a combined Christmas/New Year Mexican Riviera cruise, round-trip from Los Angeles.

On 14 January 2004, she embarked on her first world cruise; a 106-day voyage departing Los Angeles, which concluded on 5 May, in New York City.

Crystal Serenity was the largest cruise ship ever to navigate the Northwest Passage. Starting on 10 August 2016, the ship sailed from Vancouver to New York City with 1,700 passengers and crew, taking 28 days for the journey. In the Canadian Arctic she made stops at Ulukhaktok and Cambridge Bay on Victoria Island, then passed up Franklin Strait and through the narrow Bellot Strait, adjacent to Zenith Point, the most northerly extension of North America. It explored Beechy Island where Franklin overwintered, followed by seldom visited fjords on the south side of Devon Island, plus fjords on Baffin Island and the village of Pond Inlet. On 5 September 2016 it sailed for Disko Bay in Greenland.  Her transit triggered comments on Canada's Arctic sovereignty.

On 27 November 2021, Crystal Serenity was the first large cruise ship to exceed the size limits set by the citizens of Key West in November 2020.

Arrest
In January 2022, a warrant was issued for the arrest of the ship should she reenter US waters. On 4 February 2022, both Crystal Serenity and her sister, Crystal Symphony were arrested while in  Bahamian waters. The total amount owed for fuel was reported to be about 4.6 million dollars.

In June 2022 she was sold at auction to CSE Ltd., reported to be a shell corporation for the actual buyer, for $103M USD.

Since July 2022, the ship is undergoing refurbishments in Trieste, Italy.
