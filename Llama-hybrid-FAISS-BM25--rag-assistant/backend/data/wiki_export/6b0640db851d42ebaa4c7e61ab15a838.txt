"Kooks" is a song written by English singer-songwriter David Bowie, which appears on his 1971 album Hunky Dory.  Bowie wrote this song to his newborn son Duncan Jones. The song was a pastiche of early 1970s Neil Young because Bowie was listening to a Neil Young record at home on 30 May 1971 when he got the news of the arrival of his son.
