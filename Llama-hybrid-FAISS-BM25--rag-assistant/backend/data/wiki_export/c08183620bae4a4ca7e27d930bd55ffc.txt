Special issue on the PACE trial  

In July 2017, the Journal of Health Psychology published an entire issue devoted to the controversial PACE trial for ME/chronic fatigue syndrome. The articles were mostly critical of the PACE trial, and the journal concluded that "the results are, at best, unreliable, and at worst manipulated to produce a positive-looking outcome". However, three editorial board members of the journal, all of whom were alleged to have conflicts of interest, resigned in protest, claiming that the articles were biased and one-sided. In response, an associate editor of the journal James C. Coyne attacked the three resigning board members, calling one a "disgusting old fart neoliberal hypocrite", and telling another to "f*** off...you ol' sleazebag". Coyne left the editorial board as a consequence.

In a Parliamentary debate on ME (#MEDebate) on 21 June 2018, the Journal of Health Psychology was referred to by Sir Edward Davey MP as a source of critical evidence on ME treatment.
