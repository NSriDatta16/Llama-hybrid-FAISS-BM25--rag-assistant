George Robson (; February 24, 1909 – September 2, 1946) was an English-American racing driver. He is best known for winning the Indianapolis 500 in 1946. Although his earlier career had been unremarkable, Robson won several more races during the 1946 AAA Championship Car season, before being killed later that year in accident at Lakewood Speedway.

Early life 

George Robson was born in the Benwell area of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, in England. He was the second child and eldest son of George William, a machinist, and Elizabeth (née Davison). By the year 1911 Robson had moved with his family to the Mount Dennis neighborhood of York, Ontario, Canada. 

In 1924, his family emigrated to the United States, settling in Huntington Park, California. A few years later Robson began working at a foundry. Robson married Marjorie (née June) in 1933, and a year later, the couple had a son, George William.

Driving career

Early career 

Robson began his racing career in the Los Angeles region during the mid-1930s. He made his debut at the Championship/Indy car level during the 1938 season, competing at the Syracuse Mile. Earlier that year, he had also competed in a non-championship points event held at the Milwaukee Mile.

In 1939, Robson drove relief in the Indianapolis 500, after failing to qualify for the race, but securing the position of first alternate, he took over for Harry McQuinn on the 77th lap, eventually dropping out on lap 110 with mechanical issues. Robson would go on to qualify for the following two Indianapolis 500s, finishing 23rd in 1940, and 25th in 1941.

Robson's most notable result before the onset of the Second World War halted racing in the United States was a second-place finish in the Syracuse 100 in 1940. Before the conflict he worked as a machinist in Los Angeles.

1946 Indianapolis 500 victory 

Robson was the winner of the 1946 Indianapolis 500, the first edition following the war. He made the field on the fourth day of qualifying, with the fifth fastest time overall. Starting the race from 15th position, Robson steadily made his way though the field. Robson took the lead for the first time on lap 56, and aside from making pit stops, held it for the remainder of the race. 

Robson's closest competitor during the latter half of the race was rookie Jimmy Jackson. Jackson lost time earlier in the race, forced to pit after his windshield was damaged by debris from Hal Robson - the younger brother of George, and like Jackson, a rookie - broke an engine rod. George Robson took the lead for good on lap 93. The race saw heavy attrition, and Robson ran much of the second half of the race at a measured pace.  

Robson finished more than 44 seconds ahead of Jackson, and lead 138 laps of the 200 lap event. After the event there was a minor controversy, as Robson was accused of not following the rules by choosing to remain within his car during pit stops. A protest was filed, but overruled, and Robson was declared the official winner of the race. His victory was the first for a 6-cylinder car since Ray Harroun won the inaugural Indianapolis 500 in 1911.

Post-victory career 
 
The anomalous 1946 season featured more than 70 races, only six of which were run to "championship car" specifications of more than 100 miles' length. AAA officials, fearing small car counts after more than four years without racing, looked to boost entry numbers by including 71 races run to "big car" specifications. These races were run at distances shorter than 100 miles. Robson performed strongly after his surprise '500' victory, including finishing second to Rex Mays in the Langhorne 100, the second race of the season held to "championship car" specifications. Heading into the second-half of the season Robson had won six races in total, and was running second in the points standings.

Death 

The third "championship" level race of the season was held on September 2, at Atlanta's Lakewood Speedway, a track notorious for its often dusty conditions. With two laps to go in the 100 lap event, visibility was at a minimum. Robson struck the slow moving car of Billy DeVore after moving low on the 98th lap, possibly having problems of his own. 

Seeing DeVore at the last moment, Robson veered to the right, and was hit by George Barringer, which simultaneously hitting De Vore's right rear wheel. The accident sent De Vore over a stone wall, where he landed upside down in a creek. He was rescued by crowd members.

Robson's car began tumbling wildly, throwing him to his death. Barringer, spinning sideways across oncoming traffic, was hit by Bud Bardowski. Barringer succumbed to massive internal trauma a few hours afterwards. Bardowski emerged with bruising and lacerations.
