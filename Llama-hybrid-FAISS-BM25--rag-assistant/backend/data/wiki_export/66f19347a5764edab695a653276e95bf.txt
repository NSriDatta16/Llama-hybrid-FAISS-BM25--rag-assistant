Plot
Saravana is a college student who returns to his home for his sister Divya's wedding with a distraught and frightened Sadhana, whom Saravana introduces as his friend to his family. While the marriage preparation continues, everyone begins to suspect Sadhana. Saravana's uncle Purushothaman begins to lose his emotions as he wants Saravana to marry his daughter. Purushothaman confronts Sadhana, who gets upset and an argument ensues. While at a restaurant, Saravana and Sadhana are confronted by a gang. Saravana chases the gang and thrashes them. Realizing that he has left Sadhana behind, Saravana returns to the restaurant, but finds that Sadhana is not there. Saravana's father Bhoopathi confronts Saravana and forces him to reveal about Sadhana's identity, where Saravana reveals his past.

Past: Saravana and Krishna are best friends, who visits Krishna's home village. Sadhana, who returns from London, is impressed by Saravana, who continually impresses her based on her tastes. He gets along well with Krishna's and Sadhana's family. Saravana convinces them that he would make a prospective groom for Sadhana. Sadhana's family, mainly her brother Soundarapandiyan and his sidekick Velu are involved in regional gangs in their village. When Sadhana takes Saravana to the temple for a visit without Soundarapandiyan's knowledge, a rival gang member group, headed by Duraisingam, is attacked by Velu's group members, and Duraisingam's brother Vanjaravelu gets hold of Sadhana and threatens to kill her. In a swift action of bravery and skill, Saravana knocks down Vanjaravelu. After this incident, Soundarapandiyan tells Saravana about the violent happenings in the village.

Soundarapandiyan explains how he and his wife are master's degree holder from BITS Pilani. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the villages, the rivalry is deadly and fatal. He ultimately says that even though the villages are violent, he will remain a noble person with high ideals. After a few days though, in the most ungrateful manner and a show cowardice, Duraisingam's gang fights with fierce brutality, and they finishes Krishna's entire family except Sadhana. Saravana promises to Soundarapandiyan that he will take up the responsibility of Sadhana. In the process, Saravana also becomes Duraisingam's rival as he kills Vanjaravelu to protect Sadhana. When Duraisingam finds out that Vanjaravelu was killed by Saravana, he decides to kill him instead of Sadhana.

Present: Velu trace Sadhana and bring her to Saravana's home. Feeling that she is not safe here anymore, Saravana plans to send her to London, but Sadhana is not happy with his decision as she loves him. On the day of the flight, Sadhana meets Saravana and Krishna's friend at the airport. The girl tells Sadhana about Saravana's devotion for her. She also knows that Sadhana's family chose Saravana as Sadhana's bridegroom before they were killed. Sadhana realizes she cannot leave Saravana and leaves the airport. She manages to find Saravana, who is fighting Duraisingam and his men. After Saravana defeats Duraisingam, he and Sadhana happily reunite and leave, while Duraisingam is killed by Velu.
