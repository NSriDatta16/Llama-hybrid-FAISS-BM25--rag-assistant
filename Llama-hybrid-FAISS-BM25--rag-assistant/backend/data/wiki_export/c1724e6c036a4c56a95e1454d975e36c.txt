The Knockmealdown Mountains () are a mountain range located on the border of counties Tipperary and Waterford in Ireland, running east and west between the two counties. The highest peak of the range is Knockmealdown, in County Waterford. On the western side of the summit, the range is crossed by a high pass called ‘The Vee’ through which runs the old mail coach road from Lismore to Clogheen.

The mountains were formerly known as Sliabh gCua, sometimes anglicized 'Slieve Gua' or 'Slieve Goe'.
