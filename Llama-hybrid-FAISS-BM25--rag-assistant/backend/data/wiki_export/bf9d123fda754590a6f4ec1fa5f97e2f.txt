Lolly Pop is an on-stage persona of Brooke R. Calder, produced by Ricardo Autobahn, Monte Moir and Doctor Fink.

Biography
Raised between the United States and Zimbabwe, Africa, Calder moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota to work as a dancer for Prince in 1994. Shortly after being cast in the New Power Generation (NPG)'s "Get Wild" video, she suffered a debilitating back injury and shifted to a studio apprenticeship with NPG keyboardist Morris Hayes. Following completion, she served as a label intern with Twin/Tone Records, where she worked for related acts of Information Society (band), The Suburbs (band), Semisonic and more. 

In 2002, Calder adopted the moniker Lolly Pop and formed Electro-Kitsch act TELEPHONE!.  Circa 2006, Pop emerged as a solo artist produced by Fink, Moir and Autobahn. The following year, she was featured on RockAmerica, the soundtrack of the film Loveless in Los Angeles, appeared at Winter Music Conference in Miami, as well as in the Paul Moering short Climbing Trees.

Next recruited as the female vocalist for POP INC., she also contributed vocals to and/or produced American acts A*O*A and glean (with Rick McCollum of The Afghan Whigs); British outfits Cuban Boys and The Rude Awakening, as well as Norway's Frode Holm.  With The Rembrandts' Phil Solem, Calder co-wrote the theme song for the Launch TV comedy Graham Crackers. In 2019, she had a cameo appearance in Jellybean Johnson's Put Some Jelly On It and formed dark wave duo The Red Hour with ENDIF.  She most recently collaborated with BBC award-winning director Martin Gooch for the short film "Everybody Loves Dancing", and runs the Philadelphia-based electronic music imprint Manual Control Records.

Charitable efforts
During 2019, Calder helmed a suitcase and donations initiative for survivors of the Drake fire. Throughout 2017, A*O*A donated their sales profits to the NODAPL Legal Fund and continue to provide a $1 royalty to RAICES for each maxi-single sold. In 2004, Calder partnered with First Avenue (nightclub) to raise money for the Tubman Alliance  and organized a female-fronted bill dubbed GIRLFEST.
