Former schools

 Edgefield Grade School: Was one the original elementary schools for the district and was later closed in 1994 when the SCESC bought the building. In the late 2010s the building was mostly demolished because it was no longer needed.  
 Day Elementary School: Was a K-5 elementary until 2006, later becoming one of the two kindergarten centers for the district. In 2011 it was chosen to close the kindergarten centers and move them to the 6 elementary schools. The building is now home to Day Integrated Learning Center for the Stark County ESC. 
 Plain Center Elementary: Was another K-5 elementary until 2006 when it became of the other kindergarten center in the district. In 2011 the district chose to close the building along with Day and move kindergarten to the 6 elementary schools. The school has now been leased to Portage Collaborative Montessori School for classes.
 Pleasant View School for the Arts: Originally Pleasant View Elementary before becoming a school for the arts a time later. Closed when the district reconstructed and the classes the school offered were moved to the new middle schools (Glenwood & Oakwood). The building was demolished in 2007 and the land is still vacant.

Controversies 

In early 2012, Plain Local District phased out its logo after Morehead State University claimed that the district had illegally used its logo.

Superintendent Brent May says the district removed the logo from its website, fliers and other correspondence. The website now features an outline of an eagle with its wings raised; however, the stolen eagle image also is featured on the GlenOak High School gymnasium floor, which would be costly to change.

The attorney representing the university's interests says he understands that financial burden and would ask that the logo be changed whenever the school replaces the gym floor.
