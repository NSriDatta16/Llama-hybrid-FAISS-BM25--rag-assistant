History
Before Montenegro became an independent country on 3 June 2006, the country had participated as part of  and later . Entries from Montenegro also placed 4th in  and 18th in  as part of Yugoslavia, and 7th in  as part of Serbia and Montenegro.  Montenegrin broadcaster Radio and Television of Montenegro (RTCG) organised the national final MontenegroSong to select the country's entries in  and , and internally selected the entry in .

As an independent country, Montenegro failed to qualify for the grand final during its debut in , as well as its appearances in  and . The country placed 11th in the first semi-final in 2009, their best result at the time, with "Just Get Out of My Life" performed by Andrea Demirović. In November 2009, RTCG announced that Montenegro would withdraw from the  contest due to financial difficulties. Despite not participating, RTCG still broadcast the contest. RTCG applied to participate in the  contest, but with the caveat that the potential representative would have to find sponsors to fund their participation themselves. As that did not come to fruition, in December 2010, Montenegro decided to not participate in the contest on financial grounds.

On 20 November 2011 the head of RTCG revealed that Montenegro would participate in the 2012 contest to be held in Baku; he also went on to say that he saw Montenegro at every Eurovision Song Contest to come. Montenegro returned to the contest in , again internally selecting their entry, "Euro Neuro" performed by Rambo Amadeus, which failed to qualify from the first semi-final. In , Montenegro internally selected Who See and Nina Žižić with the song "Igranka", and failed to qualify. In , Montenegro qualified for the grand final for the first time in its history with Sergej Ćetković's "Moj svijet". In , Montenegro again qualified for the grand final with "Adio", performed by Knez and composed by Željko Joksimović. The song achieved the best Montenegrin result up to that time, finishing in 13th place. In , RTCG selected Highway and their song "The Real Thing" internally. They performed in the first semi-final but the song failed to qualify, placing 13th with 60 points. In , RTCG selected Slavko Kalezić and his song "Space" internally. The song failed to qualify, placing 16th. In , RTCG organised the national final Montevizija to select their entry, which was won by "Inje" performed by Vanja Radovanović. The song failed to qualify from the second semi-final, placing 16th with 40 points. In , RTCG again selected its representative through Montevizija, which was won by "Heaven" performed by D mol. The song failed to qualify from the first semi-final, placing 16th with 46 points.

Despite initially confirming their participation in the  contest and aiming to expand Montevizija, Montenegro ultimately did not enter the contest, which was later cancelled as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. RTCG later stated that the reason was due to "modest results" and financial issues. Montenegro also did not participate in the  contest, but returned in , having internally selected Vladana to represent the country with the song "Breathe". Once again, Montenegro failed to qualify for the final, finishing 17th in a field of 18 with 33 points in the second semi-final. RTCG later confirmed its absence from the  contest, citing financial constraints and a lack of interest from sponsors.
