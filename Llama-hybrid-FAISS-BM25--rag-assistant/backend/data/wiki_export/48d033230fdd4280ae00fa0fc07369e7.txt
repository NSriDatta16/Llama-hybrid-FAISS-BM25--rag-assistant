America's Volume Dealer is the sixth studio album by American heavy metal band Corrosion of Conformity, released on September 26, 2000. It was the last album to feature longtime drummer Reed Mullin for nine years until his return in 2010.

Reception 
Steve Huey from AllMusic gave America's Volume Dealer three stars out of five. He described the album as "COC's most radio-friendly record yet", mainly because "the production is more polished, and while the guitars are still high-voltage, the sludgy murk of their most inspiringly heavy records is largely absent."

However, Huey admits that "even if some fans might be disappointed that they [COC] have left the garage, the songs hold up well -- they're melodic and well-crafted, and there's enough variety in the album's pacing to keep it an engaging listen the whole way through."
