Extract from Pigot & Co's National Commercial Directory, 1834
FARNLEY TYAS is a township, in the same parish as Honley and Crossland, about three miles from Huddersfield and two from Honley. There are but few manufacturing establishments in this township, and, divested of these, it is a place of little importance.  The Earl of Dartmouth contributes Â£30 annually for the support of a school, in which thirty children are instructed.  The population of this township has latterly declined: in 1821 it contained 900 inhabitants, and in 1831, 849.

Governance 

Farnley Tyas was formerly a township and chapelry in the parish of Almondbury, in 1866 Farnley Tyas became a civil parish and in 1894 became an urban district, the urban district was merged with Thurstonland urban district in 1925.
