Éric ['eʁik] is a French masculine given name, the equivalent of English Eric. In French-speaking Canada and Belgium it is also sometimes unaccented, and pronounced "Eric" as English with the stress on the "i". A notable French exception is Erik Satie, born Éric, but who in later life signed his name "Erik" pronounced as in English. 

As with Étienne, Émile, Édouard, Élisabeth, Édith the accent É is sometimes omitted in older printed sources, though French orthography is to include accents on capitals.
