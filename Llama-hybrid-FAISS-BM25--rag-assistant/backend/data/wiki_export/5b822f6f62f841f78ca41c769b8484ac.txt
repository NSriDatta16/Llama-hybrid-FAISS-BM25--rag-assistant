"Ein Lama in Yokohama" is a 2005 song released by animated German crocodile, Schnappi. It was the second single from the debut album Schnappi und Seine Freunde and was released on 25 April 2005.

Song subject
The song concerns itself with a llama (and his friend Schnappi). The llama flies to Yokohama, and is frustrated by his inability to eat with chopsticks. "Where is the fork?" asks the llama. The llama and Schnappi do various silly things with their chopsticks. Eventually, the llama learns to use chopsticks by observing several geisha eating, and becomes a chopstick "superstar".

Song information
Lyrics were written and the music composed by Rosita Blissenbach and Iris Gruttmann. As for the previous single, it was performed by Joy Gruttmann. The song features Das Lama, another animated animal, which is mentioned in the credits. The music video was produced as an animated feature.

The song achieved success in many European countries, but this success was minor in comparison with "Schnappi, Das Kleine Krokodil". It hit its highest position in Germany, where it reached number 6.
