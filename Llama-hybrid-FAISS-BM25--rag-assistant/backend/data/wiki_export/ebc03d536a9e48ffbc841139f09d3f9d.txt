Baldwin High School (BHS) is located at 155 Highway 49 West in Milledgeville, Georgia, United States. New additions since 2003 include a classroom wing, a JROTC building, a fine arts wing, cafeteria and a vocational building. Baldwin is the only public high school in Baldwin County, and the largest of the three total high schools. The other two are private schools: John Milledge Academy and Georgia Military College.

Mascot controversy
A Mascot Advisory Committee was formed by the Baldwin County Board of Education in 2016. After a year of discussion, the board decided to retain the "Braves" mascot name but remove some of the stereotypical imagery.
