History

In 2006, the CTA began the Brown Line Capacity Expansion Project, which involved the renovation and reconstruction of Brown Line stations to allow eight car trains to run on the line and make them accessible to passengers with disabilities. Irving Park station closed between December 3, 2007, and December 6, 2008, and was completely rebuilt.
