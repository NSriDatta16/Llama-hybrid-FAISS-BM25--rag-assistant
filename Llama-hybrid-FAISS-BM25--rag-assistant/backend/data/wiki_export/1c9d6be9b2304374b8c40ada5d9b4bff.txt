is a Japanese visual kei metal/rock band formed in 2003 by Asagi, Ruiza and Sin, after their previous band Syndrome disbanded. D's music includes heavy guitar songs, as well as melancholic ballads and even medieval music and folk dance from around the world. Their lyrics focus on love, human nature and esoteric themes, such as spirituality and the relationship between persons and nature, and their costumes are closely related to the stories they tell. Their styling matches their music: fantastical, gothic and elegant.

History

2003–2005: Formation and The Name of the Rose 
In March 2003, D was formed with their initial lineup of vocalist Asagi, guitarist Ruiza, drummer Hiroki, guitarist Sin, and bassist Rena. They released their first EP, New Blood on July 18. Shortly before the release, Sin quit D, and not long after, Ruiza had to leave the band due to undisclosed health issues. D went on a short pause of activities from that point, however Asagi and Hiroki continued to play concerts under the name "Night of the Children" with a support guitarist, Tetsu. Meanwhile, Sin decided to leave the music scene and Hiroki called a former band member, Hide-Zou, to fill in. Once Ruiza was released from the hospital on September 27, D officially resumed activities with Hide-Zou replacing Sin on guitar. Two months after their reunion, they recorded their first single "Alice" which was given away for free at only one show in Tokyo that November. "Alice" was released as a single on November 27. On January 7 of the following year, they released their second EP: Paradox, which reached 13th place on the Oricon indies chart.

During 2004, D released another EP Yume Narishi Kuuchuu Teien, as well as a single entitled "Mayutsuki no Hitsugi", which was only for sale at three concerts in November, in Tokyo, Nagoya, and Osaka. They also released a remastered version of their first EP, with a previously unreleased track "Gareki no Hana". New Blood: Second Impact was released on December 8 of that year, quickly followed by their fourth single, "Mahiru no Koe: Synchronicity".

In 2005, Rena remained in the band long enough to release one more single and promotional video, "Yami Yori Kurai Doukoku no a Capella to Bara Yori Akai Jounetsu no Aria". On July 27, after finishing the recording of the forthcoming album, Rena left the band and Hide-Zou recorded bass for that release. They released their first full album titled The Name of the Rose on September 28 in two versions, each packaged with a DVD containing a different promotional video. D launched their own publication called Mad Tea Party Magazine on August 7.

Keeping with the trend of remastering their old albums, in 2006 D re-released their EPs Paradox and Yume Narishi Kuchuu Teien. The latter came with two additional tracks that were previously unreleased. Their seventh single, "Taiyou wo Okuru Hi", was released in two types: a limited edition with the promotional video for the title track, and a regular edition with an instrumental version of the title track.
