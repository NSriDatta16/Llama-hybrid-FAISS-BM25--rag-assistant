"How Do You Talk to an Angel" is a song written by Steve Tyrell, Barry Coffing, and  Stephanie Tyrell. It was the theme for the American TV series The Heights. The single was released with Jamie Walters as the lead singer, and it reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 on November 14, 1992, but the series was canceled exactly one week after the song fell from its number one position. Vocalists on the single included Shawn David Thompson, Cheryl Pollak, and Charlotte Ross, as well as Zachary Throne from the Las Vegas rock band Sin City Sinners.

In 1993, the song was nominated for an Emmy Award for "Outstanding Individual Achievement in Music and Lyrics". The Emmy went to the song "Sorry I Asked" by Kander and Ebb from Liza Minnelli Live from Radio City Music Hall. No follow-up singles under The Heights name were ever commercially released. Promo CDs were issued to radio for a follow-up "I'm Still On Your Side", but there was no commercial issue for this track as a single.  

Walters, the lead singer on the single and the lead actor on the show, later had a number-16 Hot 100 hit with his single "Hold On" in 1994. It was his only subsequent chart appearance.
