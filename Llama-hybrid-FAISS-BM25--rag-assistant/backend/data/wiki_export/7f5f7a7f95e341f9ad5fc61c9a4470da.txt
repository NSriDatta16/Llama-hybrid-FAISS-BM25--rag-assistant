Dinder House was formerly a manor house dating back to the 12th century, but the existing building was constructed between 1799 and 1801 by the Rev William Somerville on the original site. The estate remained as the seat of the Somerville family until the late twentieth century.

History
The Dinder estate formed part of the early endowment of the Bishopric of Wells. By the 12th Century it has been granted away to William Fitzjohn whose descendants were known as 'Harptree' or 'Fleming' By 1327 the manor was held by Richard de Rodney and his family until sold in the mid 17th Century to Richard Hickes. The Hickes heiress brought it to her husband, George Somerville who died in 1776. His son Rev William Somerville rebuilt the present Dinder House in 1801, on the site of the original manor house, and subsequently died shortly after the completion in 1803. On the death of Rev William Somerville's  widow in 1830, the estate passed to his nephew, James Somerville Fownes, who took the surname Somerville to ensure the Somerville name survived.

The Dinder Estate encompassed many properties around the village including Dinder House, Dinder Lodge, The Coach House, The Old Rectory, West House, Gardeners Cottage, Pond Cottage in addition to large tracts of agricultural land and farms. 

The last Somerville resident of the house was Admiral of the Fleet Sir James Somerville, who was in command of the British force that sank the French fleet at Mers-el-KÃ©bir, near Oran, Algeria, on 3 July 1940. After World War II, Somerville, who was made Lord Lieutenant of Somerset in August 1946, lived in the house before he died in 1949. He was buried at the Church of St Michael and All Angels Church at Dinder.

The house was completely restored and renovated under the guidance of designer Ilse Crawford and Swiss landscape designer Augusto Calonder. The interior, gardens and grounds have subsequently been featured in many publications .

Dinder House and Estate was sold in March 2017 to private owners.
