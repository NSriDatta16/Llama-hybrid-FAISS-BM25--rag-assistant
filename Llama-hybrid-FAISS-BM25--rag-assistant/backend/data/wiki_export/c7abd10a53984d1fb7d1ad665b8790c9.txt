Saunders Secondary School is located at 941 Viscount Road in the Westmount suburb of London, Ontario, Canada. It is named after William Saunders. William Saunders was a Canadian pioneer and an authority on  agriculture and horticulture. Grades offered are 9–12. Saunders' school colours are red and gold and its mascot is a sabre-tooth tiger.  Saunders Secondary School is the largest high school in the Thames Valley District School Board with close to 2000 students and 120 teachers.  As of 2008, Saunders is also the site of new credit summer school for the TVDSB.

History 
Classes for Saunders began in portables at Westminster S.S. in 1970. Construction of Saunders was completed in 1972. The school cost more than $8 million to build.  The location caused many heated debates. The people of Byron, Ontario had been promised, upon amalgamation with the city of London, Ontario, a secondary school in their area so that their children would not have to be bused to the Westmount area. The chosen site for the multimillion-dollar school – right in the heart of the Westmount area, across the street from the Westmount Mall – greatly angered the Byron Area Secondary School Association. In spite of this, in January 1969, the London Board of Education approved the Westmount location for the school.

On April 18, 1994, arsonists set fire to Saunders forcing the evacuation and temporary closure of the school, as well as an extensive rebuilding of the rear part of the building.  London Police subsequently charged three students with setting the blaze.

Saunders recently underwent an exterior renovation, the first new construction at the school in over three decades.  A new entryway was added on the north-east corner of the building along with the fire escape stairs at the south and on the north-west corner of the school, contrasting modern with brutalist architecture.

Tech programs 
Current tech programs include: photography, broadcasting, electrical, computer engineering (offering CCNA & A+ certifications), woodworking, automotive, autobody, drafting graphic design, machine shop, welding and a newly added art welding course.

Saunders also offers courses in science, physical education, family studies, business and administration, computer programming, and others.

Musical theatre 
Saunders is one of the only schools in the TVDSB that offers the musical theatre performance course, another being H.B. Beal. One difference between the two schools' programs is the rotation. While Beal takes a 2 show-break schedule, Saunders does a big show on the main stage, and then a smaller show in the drama studio, alternating each year. The shows that have been performed are:
Little Shop of Horrors
Godspell
Snow White
