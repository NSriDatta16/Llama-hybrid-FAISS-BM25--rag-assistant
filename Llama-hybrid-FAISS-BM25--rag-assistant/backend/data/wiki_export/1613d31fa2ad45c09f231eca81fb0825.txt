He began to brush shoulders with Swazi politics sometime in the 1970s during a teachers' strike. All teachers were summoned by his Majesty king Sobhuza II at the royal kraal to express their concerns. On this day, one of the main speakers to speak on behalf of teachers was the late former deputy prime minister Albert Shabangu. Dlamini was not scheduled to speak on that day, but his colleagues requested that he should speak on behalf of them.  He spoke with eloquent SiSwati and received widespread cheers from his colleagues for having defended their strike and clearly making the needs of the teachers known. From time to time, Dlamini would serve King Sobhuza II.

Whilst serving in the King's advisory council, he's also head of the southern African development community's brigade  (SADC Brigade) which is a group of SADC peace-keeping troops tasked with the responsibility to engage in conflict areas to install peace. Below Dr. Dlamini in terms of rank are the Army Chief of Staff and Generals commanding the various battalions. Dlamini reports to his majesty King Mswati III as chairperson of the SADC TROIKA on politics, defence and security. He was appointed in this position in February 2009 by his majesty king Mswati III. Before then, Dlamini served as Swaziland's ambassador to the United Nations and the Republic of China on Taiwan. He was later appointed to the Senate where he was also elected Senate President.
