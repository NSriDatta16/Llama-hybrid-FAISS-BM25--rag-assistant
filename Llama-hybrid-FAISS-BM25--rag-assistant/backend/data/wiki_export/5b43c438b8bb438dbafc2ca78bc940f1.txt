Reviews
Matthew Leyland from the BBC gives it two out of five stars, saying that "few of the jokes hit the target" and the "leads were dull." He acknowledges the film's ambition, which uses "slapstick, sight gags, sound gags (movie dialogue finishing characters' sentences) and manga-esque inserts."  Anna Smith from Empire Magazine also gave the film a negative review, rating it one out of five. She states that Popcorn is "a well-meaning British comedy that fails to deliver the laughs â€“ or the romance." Paul Newman's blog review pointed to a positive aspect of the film, in that it doesn't follow the typical Hollywood format, but "feels more like an indy comedy."

Manga style artwork
The film makes use of manga-style artwork and comic strips by United Kingdom resident Original English-language manga artist Sonia Leong of Sweatdrop Studios. The artwork is used as both posters in one of the character's rooms, and as illustrations in the plot.
