Robert McKim (1828 â€“ January 20, 1900) was an Ontario, Canada, farmer and political figure. He represented Wellington North in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario as a Liberal member from 1867 to 1872 and Wellington West from 1879 to 1886.

He was born and grew up in Sligo, Ireland. In 1852, he married Margaret Shannon. He was a justice of the peace and also served as reeve for Peel Township. McKim resigned his seat in the provincial legislature in 1874 to compete unsuccessfully in Wellington Centre for a seat in the federal parliament. He was defeated in the 1875 provincial election and reelected in 1878. In 1884, McKim turned over to the speaker of the house a large sum of money that he had been paid to vote against the government. He died in Guelph in 1900.
