Critical reception
The Pitch wrote that the group "blasts dynamic street rhymes over guitar-laced tracks that would have both Jimi Hendrix and Iceberg Slim smilinâ€™ ... the combination of heavy-metal riffs and seductive pimp-licious grooves created a unique, richly textured sound." Rolling Stone wrote that P.A. "import shades of New York's ride-or-die anthems and old West Coast G-Funk into their crunk landscapes." The New Pittsburgh Courier thought that the album "takes P.A.'s funkadelic hip-hop to a new level with grimy ghetto rhymes, syrupy rock guitars and ham-hock-thick beats."
