Live Dates is a live album by the British rock band Wishbone Ash released in November 1973.

Following the release of the album, founding member Ted Turner left the band.

Recording
The album features 11 tracks, 10 of which originally featured on the band's first four albums. The one new track was a cover of the Jimmy Reed blues standard "Baby What You Want Me to Do".

The tracks were recorded in June 1973 at Croydon Fairfield Halls,[A] Reading University,[B] Newcastle City Hall,[C] and Portsmouth Guildhall.[D], using the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio.

In 2023, the band's other guitarist Andy Powell said, "We had made a name for ourselves as a dynamic live act, so it only made sense to capture the energy and vibrancy of our shows on a live album. Fortunately, the record company funded the costly Rolling Stones Mobile recording truck, so we were able to record several shows during our U.K. tour and compile the most powerful moments on Live Dates." Also in 2023, Wishbone Ash undertook a 50th anniversary tour celebrating the album, and recorded and released Live Dates Live, as a tribute to the original Live Dates.

Band founder and original bass guitarist Martin Turner also celebrated the 50th anniversary of the album in 2023, by touring across the UK. He had previously released a double live album New Live Dates in 2016, which also featured Ted Turner.

Live Dates charted at number 86 in Canada in February 1974. It is certified silver (60,000 sales) by the BPI in the UK.
