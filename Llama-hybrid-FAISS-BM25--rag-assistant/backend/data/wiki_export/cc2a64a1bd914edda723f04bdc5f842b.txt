Julius Margolin (, October 14, 1900 – January 21, 1971) was a Russian Empire-born Israeli writer and political activist. He was the author of A Journey to the Land Ze-Ka (Путешествие в страну Зэ-Ка).

Biography
Margolin was born in Pinsk, Russian Empire. He studied at the Humboldt University of Berlin. Margolin received his doctorate in philosophy in 1929. He then moved to Łódź, Poland, and later, in 1936, to Palestine. Three years later he was visiting his relatives in Pinsk and was trapped there by the Soviet invasion of Poland. Together with numerous other "socially dangerous elements", he was rounded up by the NKVD and sent to a labor camp on the northern bank of the Lake Onega. He survived, and was freed in 1945 as a former Polish citizen according to the agreement with Poland. In 1946, he was permitted to return to Poland. He emigrated to Palestine, settling in Tel Aviv.

Literary career
He completed A Journey to the Land Ze-Ka in 1947, when Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn had just been sent to the gulag. It was impossible to publish such a book about the Soviet Union in the West at that time, immediately after World War II. The manuscript was also rejected by publishers in Israel. An abridged version was published in France in  1949. The book was printed in the United States in 1952 by  (also abridged), and was reprinted in 1975. 

In 1951, Margolin testified at the  trial of David Rousset, who was accused of revealing information about the gulag to the French public.
