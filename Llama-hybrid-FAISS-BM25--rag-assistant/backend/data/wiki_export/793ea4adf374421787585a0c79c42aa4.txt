History

 SH 37 was designated as a route on April 13, 1918 from Clarksville to Lufkin. On August 21, 1923, it was pared back, with everything north of Mt. Vernon either cancelled or transferred to the new SH 66, and the portion from Jacksonville to Lufkin transferred to SH 40. On May 23, 1927, it was extended north to Talco. On June 24, 1931, it was extended north to the Oklahoma state line, replacing SH 66. On July 15, 1935, everything north of Clarksville was cancelled. The section north of Clarksville was restored on December 20, 1937. On September 26, 1939, the stretch from Mineola to Tyler was transferred to U.S. Highway 69 (Cosigned with since 1934), with the remaining route continuing to the present.

SH 37A was designated on January 19, 1920 as a spur from Tyler to Troup. This was cancelled on November 27, 1922. SH 37A was restored on February 18, 1924, but from Tyler to New Summerfield. It was cancelled on March 19, 1930, as it became part of SH 110.
