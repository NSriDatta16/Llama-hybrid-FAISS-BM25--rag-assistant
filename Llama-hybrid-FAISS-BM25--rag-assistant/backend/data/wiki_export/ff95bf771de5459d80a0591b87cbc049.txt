Television 

The Atlanta metropolitan area is currently defined by Nielsen Media Research as the seventh-largest television market in the United States, with all of the major U.S. television networks having affiliates serving the region.

Atlanta is a major cable television programming center. Ted Turner began the Turner Broadcasting System in Atlanta in 1970 with his takeover of WJRJ-TV, renamed WTCG in 1970 and WTBS in 1979; WTBS became a pioneer "superstation" distributed to cable operators internationally, eventually yielding TBS. Ted established CNN in 1980, long headquartered at the CNN Center. Most of Turner's other networks—including Cartoon Network/Adult Swim, Boomerang, TNT, Turner Sports, Turner Classic Movies, HLN and CNN International—continue to be based in Atlanta. The Weather Channel has its offices and studios in nearby Cumberland. The first nationwide music video programming on cable television, Video Concert Hall, was created in Atlanta.
