History
After the Princeton Public Schools announced that it could not accommodate students, the Montgomery district had sought the possibility of a regional high school with the Hillsborough Township School District and also sought other sending-receiving relationships.

Ground was broken in April 1968 for a building that would accommodate an enrollment of 1,100 students and be constructed at a cost of $3.3 million (equivalent to $ million in ). The original high school opened in January 1969 for students in grades 7-10, before which students from the township attended Princeton High School under the terms of a sending/receiving relationship. A new high school building opened for the 2005-06 school year.

The school had been accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Elementary and Secondary Schools from 1976 until 2013, when the school's accreditation status was removed.
