Magruder's is a grocery store and former chain in and around the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, founded in 1875. The store is owned by a family who were born and grew up in the Washington area. In 2006, Magruder's removed their loyalty cards, that allow the holder to save money on purchases. In 2009, locations in Cleveland Park, Annandale and Falls Church closed. In January 2013, Magruder's sold its Chevy Chase Connecticut Avenue store, which continues to operate under the Magruder's name as the sole flagship location, and began liquidation sales at its other four stores, in Alexandria, Gaithersburg, Rockville and Vienna.

History
In 1875, John H. Magruder purchased the grocery store at 1417 New York Avenue NW, Washington, D.C. where he had worked for ten years.

Some, including the owners since 2013, claim a link to "Commodore John Magruder", presumably Confederate General John B. Magruder.
