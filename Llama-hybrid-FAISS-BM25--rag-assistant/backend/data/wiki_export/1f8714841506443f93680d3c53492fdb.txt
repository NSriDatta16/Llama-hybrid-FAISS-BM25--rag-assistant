Péter Szondi (; 27 May 1929, Budapest – 18 October 1971, Berlin) was a celebrated literary scholar and philologist, originally from Hungary.

Biography
Szondi's father was the Hungarian-Jewish psychiatrist and psychoanalyst Léopold Szondi, who settled in Switzerland after his 1944 release after five months in Bergen-Belsen.

In 1965, Péter became a Professor at the Free University of Berlin, where he led the Institute for General and Comparative Literature. His fields were the history of literature and comparative literature. 

He committed suicide in 1971 by drowning himself in the Halensee in Berlin on 18 October, leaving unfinished his book about the work of his friend Paul Celan, who had killed himself the year before.
