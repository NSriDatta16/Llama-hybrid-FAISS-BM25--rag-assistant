During the Thailand political crisis of 2005-2006, he controversially called for King Bhumibol Adulyadej to replace elected Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. The King, in a speech on 26 April 2006, responded "Asking for a Royally appointed prime minister is undemocratic. It is, pardon me, a mess. It is irrational."
