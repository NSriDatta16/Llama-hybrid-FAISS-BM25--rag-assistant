The Greek spelling alphabet is a spelling alphabet (or "phonetic alphabet") for Greek, i.e. an accepted set of easily differentiated names given to the letters of the alphabet for the purpose of spelling out words. It is used mostly on radio voice channels by the Greek army, the navy and the police. The names for some Greek letters are easily confused in noisy conditions.

Similar sounding Greek letters:

víta (β), zíta (ζ), íta (η), thíta (θ)
épsilon (ε), ýpsilon (υ)
mi (μ), ni (ν)
xi (ξ), pi (π), fi (φ), chi (χ), psi (ψ)
