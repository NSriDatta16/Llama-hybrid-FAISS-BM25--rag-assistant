Entheogenic is a musical project consisting of Piers Oak-Rhind and Helmut Glavar that crosses musical style boundaries. Since the early 1980s, the Austrian musician and songwriter Helmut Glavar has founded a variety of bands, ranging from punk and funk to new wave and drums-and-bass. Piers Oak-Rhind was born in England and has been a sound designer, programmer and musician since the early 1990s. He studied guitar at the London School of Guitar. According to the two members, the music mixes "coloristic electrophonics" with "impressionistic orchestra-like sound".

The use of both eastern and western vocals, tribal-sounding instruments, and an array of synthesizers built the foundation of the Entheogenic sound.

History

Background
Entheogenic was formed in 1999 by producer, engineer, and songwriter Piers Oak-Rhind and Helmut Glavar. The duo met while working for Emagic (a former producer of music-studio software and hardware such as Logic, acquired by Apple Inc. in 2002). The name Entheogenic is derived from the term Entheogen coined in 1979 by a group of ethnobotanists and mythology scholars to describe psychedelic substances used in a religious or shamanic context.

German "Chill-Out" charts
In November 2003, Entheogenic's second album, Spontaneous Illumination, released on the German label C.O.R.N. Recordings, was the first psy-chill album ever to make it to number 1 in the German charts, where it remained Number 1 for 8 weeks and stayed in the Top 10 for an additional 12 weeks.
