Lawrence McMahon (18 January 1929 – 16 February 2006) was an Irish Fine Gael politician who served both as a Teachta Dála (TD) and as a Senator.

McMahon was first elected to Dáil Éireann at a by-election in 1970 in the Dublin County South constituency, following the resignation of Fianna Fáil TD Kevin Boland. He held the seat at the 1973 general election. At the 1977 general election, he was returned for Dublin County Mid, and after a further revision of constituency boundaries, he was elected as TD for Dublin South-West at the general elections in 1981 and February 1982. He lost his seat at the November 1982 general election.

From 1983 to 1992, he served as a member of Seanad Éireann, elected on the Labour Panel.
