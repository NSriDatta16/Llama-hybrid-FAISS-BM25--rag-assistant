Due to his good performance for Hoffenheim, Beck was called up on 5 February 2009 for the Germany national football team and made his debut against Norway in Düsseldorf. His debut against Norway also earned his former club, Stuttgart, 500,000 € extra as a result of an activated clause.

Beck was included on the 30-man preliminary roster for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, but did not make it to the final 23 man squad by Joachim Löw as he favoured Dennis Aogo and Holger Badstuber. He scored two goals against an Eppan U20 XI team in a warm-up game as a part of the preparations for the upcoming tournament. However these goals were not scored in a full international game so they are not counted as international caps or goals.

After being left out of the squad, Beck believed his exclusion from the squad would help accelerate his development as a person and a footballer.
