The Stoeger Condor is a double-barreled shotgun.  It is an over/under gun, with one barrel above the other.

There are several models of Condor, with different features and in various gauges.  The standard model has a grade-A walnut stock and fore-end, blued receiver and barrels, a single trigger,  and screw-in choke tubes.  It has a vented barrel rib and a brass bead front sight.  It is chambered to use either 2-¾ inch or 3 inch shells.  Opening the action automatically engages the safety mechanism.

In the United States, the Condor is marketed and distributed by Stoeger Industries in Accokeek, Maryland. It is manufactured by E.R. Amantino in Veranópolis, Brazil.  The Condor is relatively inexpensive compared to other double barreled shotguns.  It is most often used for hunting birds and for clay target games such as trap and skeet.
