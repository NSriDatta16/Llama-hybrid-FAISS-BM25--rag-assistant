The district serves students in ninth through twelfth grades from Shamong Township, Southampton Township,  Tabernacle Township and Woodland Township. Seneca High School serves students from four of the communities: Shamong Township, Southampton Township, Tabernacle Township and Woodland Township. Seneca is the newest of the Lenape Regional High School District's four high schools. The school has been accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Elementary and Secondary Schools since 2008.

As of the 2021–22 school year, the school had an enrollment of 1,026 students and 101.0 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 10.2:1. There were 89 students (8.7% of enrollment) eligible for free lunch and 31 (3.0% of students) eligible for reduced-cost lunch.

History
Approved by voters in 1997, Seneca High School was established as the district's fourth high school. The   facility was initially expected to be completed by 2000, constructed on a  site designed to accommodate 2,000 students. However, the school ultimately opened in September 2003 with 860 students from Shamong, Southampton, Tabernacle, and Woodland Townships. The total cost of construction amounted to $45.7 million (equivalent to $ million in ), with delays caused by lawsuits related to the building site in the Pinelands resulting in budget overruns of $8.7 million.

The district chose the name "Seneca High School" in December 2000, continuing the practice of assigning Native American names to its schools. Seneca was selected due to its traditional presence in the area. Additionally, the nickname "Golden Eagles" was chosen from a variety of animal-based alternatives, rather than selecting a nickname related to Native Americans, as had been done with the district's three other schools.

The opening of Seneca High School allowed enrollment levels at Lenape High School and Shawnee High School to decrease, helping to alleviate the overcrowding both schools had experienced. Based on the number of students who opted to switch to Seneca, the school's first graduating class in 2005 was expected to consist of 150 students.

Awards, recognition and rankings
The school was the 111th-ranked public high school in New Jersey out of 339 schools statewide in New Jersey Monthly magazine's September 2014 cover story on the state's "Top Public High Schools", using a new ranking methodology. The school had been ranked 119th in the state of 328 schools in 2012, after being ranked 135th in 2010 out of 322 schools listed. The magazine ranked the school 134th in 2008 out of 316 schools. The school was ranked 258th in the magazine's September 2006 issue, which surveyed 316 schools across the state.

Schooldigger.com ranked the school 82nd out of 381 public high schools statewide in its 2011 rankings (an increase of 14 positions from the 2010 ranking) which were based on the combined percentage of students classified as proficient or above proficient on the mathematics (89.5%) and language arts literacy (95.9%) components of the High School Proficiency Assessment (HSPA).

Athletics
The Seneca High School Golden Eagles participate in the Olympic Conference (New Jersey), which comprises public and private high schools in Burlington and Camden counties and operates under the auspices of the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association (NJSIAA). With 856 students in grades 10-12, the school was classified by the NJSIAA for the 2019–20 school year as Group III for most athletic competition purposes. This category includes schools with an enrollment of 761 to 1,058 students in that grade range.
