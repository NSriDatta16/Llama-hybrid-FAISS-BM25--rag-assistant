The Boston Red Sox Radio Network is an American radio network composed of 54 radio stations which carry English language coverage of the Boston Red Sox, a professional baseball team in Major League Baseball (MLB). Lawrence, Massachusetts station WEEI-FM (93.7 FM), which serves Boston and the Greater Boston area, serves as the network's Flagship. The network also includes 49 affiliates in the U.S. states of Massachusetts, Maine, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Vermont, New Hampshire, New York, and Florida: 28 AM stations, 24 of which supplement their signals with one or more FM translators; and 21 full-power FM stations, one of which supplements its signal with several FM translators. Joe Castiglione currently serves as the network's play-by-play announcer; since the start of the 2020 Red Sox season, Will Flemming, Sean McDonough, Jon Sciambi, Dave O'Brien, Dale Arnold and Tom Caron have alternated with Castiglione providing color commentary.  In addition to traditional over-the-air AM and FM broadcasts, network programming airs on SiriusXM satellite radio; and streams online via SiriusXM Internet Radio, TuneIn Premium, and MLB.com Gameday Audio.

Shaw's and Star Market Supermarkets, a grocery store chain which serves much of New England, holds naming rights to the "WEEI Shaw's and Star Market Red Sox Radio Network," rebranded in 2022 as the "WEEI Shaw's and Star Market Red Sox Network."
