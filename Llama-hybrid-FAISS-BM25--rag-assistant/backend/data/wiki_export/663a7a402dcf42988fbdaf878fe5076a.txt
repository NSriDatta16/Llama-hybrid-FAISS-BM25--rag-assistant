In mathematics, the logarithmic mean is a function of two non-negative numbers which is equal to their difference divided by the logarithm of their quotient.  
This calculation is applicable in engineering problems involving heat and mass transfer.

Definition
The logarithmic mean is defined as:

for the positive numbers .

Inequalities 

The logarithmic mean of two numbers is smaller than the arithmetic mean and the generalized mean with exponent one-third but larger than the geometric mean, unless the numbers are the same, in which case all three means are equal to the numbers.

Toyesh Prakash Sharma generalizes the arithmetic logarithmic geometric mean inequality for any  belongs to the whole number as

Now, for :

This is the arithmetic logarithmic geometric mean inequality. similarly, one can also obtain results by putting different values of  as below

Derivation

Mean value theorem of differential calculus 

From the mean value theorem, there exists a value  in the interval between  and  where the derivative  equals the slope of the secant line:

The logarithmic mean is obtained as the value of  by substituting  for  and similarly for its corresponding derivative:

and solving for :

Integration 

The logarithmic mean can also be interpreted as the area under an exponential curve.

The area interpretation allows the easy derivation of some basic properties of the logarithmic mean. Since the exponential function is monotonic, the integral over an interval of length 1 is bounded by  and . The homogeneity of the integral operator is transferred to the mean operator, that is .

Generalization

Mean value theorem of differential calculus 

One can generalize the mean to  variables by considering the mean value theorem for divided differences for the -th derivative of the logarithm.

We obtain

where  denotes a divided difference of the logarithm.

For  this leads to

Integral 

The integral interpretation can also be generalized to more variables, but it leads to a different result. Given the simplex  with  and an appropriate measure  which assigns the simplex a volume of 1, we obtain

This can be simplified using divided differences of the exponential function to
.
