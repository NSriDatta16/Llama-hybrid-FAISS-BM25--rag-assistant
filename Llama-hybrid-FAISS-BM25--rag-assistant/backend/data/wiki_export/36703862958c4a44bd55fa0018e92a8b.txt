Henry Dermot Ponsonby Moore, 12th Earl of Drogheda (born 1937), is a British photographer known professionally as Derry Moore. He inherited the title of Earl of Drogheda from his father, The 11th Earl of Drogheda. He had the right to use the courtesy title Viscount Moore from November 1957 until December 1989.

Education and career 
Henry Dermot Ponsonby Moore was born on 14 January 1937 in London into an Anglo-Irish aristocratic family, the son of Charles Garrett Ponsonby Moore (11th Earl of Drogheda), and Joan Eleanor ( Carr). He was educated at Eton then studied painting at Oskar Kokoschka's School of Seeing in Salzburg, Austria. After working briefly as a travel agent in New York City, he took photography lessons from British photographer Bill Brandt. Then-Viscount Moore (as he was up until inheriting the earldom in December 1989) began his professional career in 1973, with a commission from the American magazine Architectural Digest.  He photographed The Princess of Wales, Prince William and Prince Harry in 1992. His portrait, taken at Kensington Palace, was used by the Princess on her Christmas cards for that year.

Lord Drogheda photographed Queen Elizabeth II, the late Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, Indira Gandhi, Ronald Reagan, David Bowie, Iman, Benedict Cumberbatch and Helena Bonham Carter, as well as many other personalities. He became a leading photographer of architectural interiors and an illustrator of books, and had portraits published in Country Life and Vogue.
