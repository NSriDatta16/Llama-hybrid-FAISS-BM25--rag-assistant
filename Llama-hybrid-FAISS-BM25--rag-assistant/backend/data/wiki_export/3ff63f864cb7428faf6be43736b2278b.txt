Number Ones is a compilation album by the Bee Gees released in 2004. It includes 18 of their greatest hits and a tribute to band member Maurice Gibb, who died in 2003. It is the final Bee Gees album released by Universal Records.

Rhino Records re-released Number Ones worldwide in 2008 using the European track list. Combining sales of versions issued by two different record companies, it has sold 1,236,000 copies in the US as of August 2012. The set, which peaked at No. 23 in the US on the Billboard Top 200 albums chart in 2004, re-entered the charts peaking at No. 5 in 2012. The following week after peaking at No. 5 the album plummeted to No. 195, the second-greatest drop for an album that still remained on the chart, in Billboard album history. This gives the group a span of 44 years, 9 months since their first Top 10 album, 1967's Bee Gees' 1st, which peaked at No. 7 in November 1967. The only other groups with longer spans are the Beach Boys (49 years 1 week), the Beatles (47 years 7 months), and the Rolling Stones (45 years 6 months).
