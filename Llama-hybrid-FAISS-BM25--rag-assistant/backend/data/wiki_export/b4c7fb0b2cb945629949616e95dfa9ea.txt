The National Drama Festivals Association (NDFA) was formed in 1964 to encourage and support amateur theatre in all its forms and in particular through the organisation of drama festivals in the United Kingdom.

Since 1974 the NDFA has organised the British All Winners Drama Festival (BAWF) where the very best of British amateur theatre take part in a week-long celebration of theatre. The winners of all NDFA member festivals in the previous year, be they full-length or one-act member festivals, are eligible for invitation to take part.

The NDFA sponsors two playwriting competitions - the George Taylor Memorial Award and the Nan Nuttall Memorial Awards. The objective of this competition is to promote new writing for the theatre. Adjudication is carried out by a panel of judges, and the winners receive a certificate and a cash prize.

Membership of the NDFA is open to all drama festival organisations and also to theatre groups and individuals who are interested in taking part and supporting drama festivals throughout the UK. List of winners of British All-Winners Drama Festival 2016.
