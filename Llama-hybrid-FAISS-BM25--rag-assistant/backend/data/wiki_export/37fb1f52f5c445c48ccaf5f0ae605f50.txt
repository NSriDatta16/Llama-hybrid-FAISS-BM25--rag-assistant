Club career

AGF Aarhus
Rasmussen started his career in the youth scheme of Aarhus top-flight club AGF. While at AGF, he earned the nickname "Duncan" due to a slight physical resemblance of former Scottish international striker Duncan Ferguson, though he stated at the time that he wasn't a particular fan of Duncan Ferguson himself.

In January 2002, Rasmussen turned professional as he signed a three-year contract with AGF, running to January 2005. He made his debut for AGF in the Danish Superliga championship in May 2002, as he played the last two games of the 2001–02 Superliga season.
