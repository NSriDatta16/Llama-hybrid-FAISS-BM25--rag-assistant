Fixed telephony 
The area codes in Pakistan consists of two to five digits; generally smaller the city, longer the prefix. All large cities have two-digit codes. The smaller towns might have six digital whereas big cities have seven digit numbers. Azad Kashmir telephone lines contain five digits. On 1 July 2009, telephone numbers in Karachi and Lahore were changed from seven digits to eight digits. This was accomplished by adding 9 to the beginning of all phone numbers that started with a 9 i.e. government and semi-government lines and adding 3 to all other lines.

The following is the list of dialling codes for various cities and districts in Pakistan.
