History
The region was settled in 1930 by Sebastião Moreira da Silva and his children who built the first huts in an area of fertile lands and perennial springs.  With the arrival of new settlers a village (arraial) was formed called "Cobó", the name given to the knife that Silva used to keep away creditors who wanted to charge him.  In 1953 the settlement became a district belonging to Aurilândia and was called Moiporá, a combination of Moitu (Cachoeira de Goiás) and Iporá, a neighboring municipality.  In 1958 it was dismembered from Aurilândia and made a municipality.
