Gallery 825 on La Cienega Boulevard serves as LAAA's exhibition space for contemporary art. The gallery features four separate spaces, allowing for the simultaneous hosting of four individual programs. The North Gallery holds juried group shows, while the smaller galleries (South, Center, and Wurdemann) showcase solo artist exhibitions. Additionally, Gallery 825 collaborates with local non-profit organizations for their events.

Gallery 825
LAAA offers a diverse range of exhibitions, including group shows, solo exhibitions, lectures, workshops, and artist talks. All exhibition opportunities are juried by esteemed art professionals from both regional and national levels. Throughout the year, LAAA organizes eight shows at Gallery 825 exclusively for their artist members. Past show themes have explored topics such as the convergence of art and technology, contemporary culture's representation of superficial likeness or image, and the significance of multiples, patterns, and repetition in contemporary art practice. Some of the recent shows include:

Admissions
There are two opportunities for non-member artists to apply for membership. Screenings are held at the beginning and middle of each calendar year. A seven-member panel composed of art collectors, artist members, LAAA board members and prominent figures from other local art institutions select artists for admission based on the strength of their work and their potential to succeed. There is no defined criteria for acceptance; typically, accepted artists are at the stage of development where they are ready to engage in dialogue with the contemporary art world on a domestic and international level.

Guest jurors differ for each screening, thereby allowing for a more objective screening process. Previously rejected applicants, who apply again, will always have their work reviewed by a new exhibition committee. Although LAAA has no restriction for the number of admitted artists, the application process has proven to be highly selective. On average, LAAA receives 150 submissions per screening and accepts only about 20% of them.

Notable LAAA Artists
LAAA has approximately 300 artist members. Through LAAA's exposure to notable curators, gallery directors and collectors, artists have exhibited in prestigious museums, international art fairs and commercial galleries.
