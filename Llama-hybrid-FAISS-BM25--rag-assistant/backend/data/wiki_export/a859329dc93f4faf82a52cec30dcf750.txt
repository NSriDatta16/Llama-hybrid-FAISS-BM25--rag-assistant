"Bilâdy, Laki ḥobbi wa fuâdy" (; "My homeland, you have my love and my heart"), also known by its incipit, "" (), is the national anthem of Egypt, composed by Sayed Darwish and written by Mohamed Yunis El Qadi. It was adopted in 1979.

History 

The lyrics were written by Mohamed Younis El Qady. Sayed Darwish composed the music and maintained close ties with early leaders of the national movement for independence in Egypt, such as Mustafa Kamel. The chorus derived from one of Kamel's most famous Egyptian nationalist speeches.

Egypt's first national anthem dates back to 1869 when a royal anthem was composed to honor the monarch. It is unclear how long this anthem was in use. Although the monarchy was deposed in 1952, the anthem was used as part of the anthem of the United Arab Republic with Syria in 1958.
