The Kidd Kraddick Morning Show (formerly Kidd Kraddick in the Morning) is an American ensemble morning radio show that originates from Dallas, Texas.  The show is heard weekday mornings on flagship station, KHKS, and on dozens of other radio stations around the U.S., airing either a Top 40/CHR, Mainstream Adult Contemporary or Hot Adult Contemporary radio format.

The Kidd Kraddick Morning Show's primary focus is pop culture commentary, with discussions often revolving around the previous night's reality television programming, celebrity relationships and current affairs. The show is broadcast from their studios in Irving, Texas. The show is owned and syndicated by YEA Networks and is distributed by Westwood One. The radio show streams live through Twitch at Kiddtv.com. The Kidd Kraddick Morning Show is available in an on-demand service via the show's website and the iHeartRadio apps.

Some popular segments on the show are "Love Letters to Kellie", "Petty Monday", "Whatever Wednesday", "First World Problems", "Feel Good Friday", "Does that Make Me Crazy?" and "Flush the Format", a Friday morning segment where a featured DJ plays a variety of songs not normally heard.

On September 10, 2012, the show became a part of nationally syndicated Fox television show, Dish Nation, which mainly covers celebrity news as reported on several radio morning shows around the country. On December 16, 2016, the show announced a departure from Dish Nation, with a new TV project in the works. On July 30, 2018, "KiddNation TV", premiered in a limited test run in both Dallas and Houston, Texas. The television show features some of the daily radio show’s content and segments, as well as a look into some of the cast's daily life outside of the studio. KiddNation TV's test run ended on August 24, 2018 after airing a twenty episode season.

From October 1, 1992 until July 26, 2013, the show was hosted by radio DJ and personality, Kidd Kraddick.  But with Kraddick's unexpected death outside of New Orleans on July 27, 2013, the show's future without Kraddick was undetermined. On August 5, 2013, the show resumed live broadcasts as an ensemble program hosted by the remaining co-hosts, with the show continuing to posthumously carry Kraddick's name. On January 15, 2014, the show's name was altered from "Kidd Kraddick in the Morning", to "The Kidd Kraddick Morning Show".
