The Walton Arts Center is a performing arts center located in Fayetteville, Arkansas. It opened in 1992 and is currently Arkansas' largest and busiest arts presenter.

The center is estimated to have cost about $13 million, which was made possible by a collaboration of the Walton Family Foundation, the university, the city, and the private sector.

The facility currently houses three resident companies: Symphony of Northwest Arkansas, Trike Theatre for Youth, and Community Creative Center. In 2016, the facility was renovated and expanded with an additional  square feet.

History 

The idea for the Walton Arts Center started in the 1980s with a donation from Sam Walton to the University of Arkansas for the creation of a performance space. After talking with the city of Fayetteville, which was also looking for a multi-purpose space for conferences and special events, the corner of Dickson Street and North School Avenue was chosen for its location approximately halfway between downtown and the University. In 1986 the Walton Arts Center Council was formed with the task of the construction of the facility.

In 2009 Peter B. Lane was appointed the Center's third President/CEO.
In 2013 the Arkansas Music Pavilion was relocated to the city of Rogers, AR
In 2014 construction of Walmart Arkansas Music Pavilion was completed.
