"Bang Bang You're Dead" is a song by English band Dirty Pretty Things. It was released as the first single from the band's debut album, Waterloo to Anywhere (2006), on 24 April 2006. The song charted at number five on the UK Singles Chart and topped the NME chart in 2006. The same year, it was used as the theme tune to the BBC series Sorted.

Early rumours about the song claimed it was about Pete Doherty, citing the lyric; 'I gave you the Midas touch/You turned round and scratched out my heart' as evidence. Carl Barât later affirmed this in an interview for Vulture.
