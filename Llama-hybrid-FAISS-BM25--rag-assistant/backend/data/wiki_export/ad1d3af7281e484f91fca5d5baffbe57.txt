The "Silkolene" brand name
The Silkolene brand name has a long history, with the company originating in England. Initially, it was called Dalton and Company, being named after its founder, and sold Silkolene products.  However, recognising the strength of the Silkolene brand, in the early 1980s, the company was renamed Silkolene Lubricants. In 1989, Silkolene Lubricants was acquired by the German Fuchs group, and the products were subsequently renamed Fuchs Silkolene. Presently, Silkolene products continue to be manufactured at Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, in England. They are now also made in Germany, the US, and South East Asia. Fuchs purchased the British Batoyle Freedom Group company of Norfolk in 2014.

The brand has also been involved with Motorcross, speedway and karting (sponsoring Hudson Motorsport and Freddie Housley).
