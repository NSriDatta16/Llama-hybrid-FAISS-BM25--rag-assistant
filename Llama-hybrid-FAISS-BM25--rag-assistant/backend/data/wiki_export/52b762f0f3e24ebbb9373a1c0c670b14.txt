The song was joint winner with the 's "Boom Bang-a-Bang" performed by Lulu, "De troubadour" by Lenny Kuhr representing the , and "Un jour, un enfant" sung for  by Frida Boccara. It was Spain's second winning entry in the contest and the last to date.

Background
The song is a very up-tempo number, sung from the perspective of a woman telling her lover about the positive changes he has had on her, specifically that she now lives her life singing.

Salomé recorded the song in six languages: Spanish (Castilian), Catalan (as "Canto i vull viure"), Basque ("Kantari bizi naiz"), English ("The Feeling of Love"), French ("Alors je chante") and Italian ("Vivo cantando"). Israeli singer Rika Zaraï released a cover of the French version, which spent three weeks at number one in the French singles chart from 16 August to 5 September 1969.
In Spain the song reached 1 on the Spanish Singles Chart.

Eurovision
Two memorable aspects of the performance at Eurovision were Salomé's costume – a Pertegaz pantsuit covered in long strands of porcelain resembling beads – and the fact that the singer chose to dance on the spot during certain parts of the song. Dancing was against the Song Contest rules at the time; Salomé was not penalized, however, as the performers from Ireland and the United Kingdom had done the same that year as well.

It was succeeded as a Spanish entry at the 1970 contest by Julio Iglesias with "Gwendolyne" and at the 1971 contest by Karina with "En un mundo nuevo".
