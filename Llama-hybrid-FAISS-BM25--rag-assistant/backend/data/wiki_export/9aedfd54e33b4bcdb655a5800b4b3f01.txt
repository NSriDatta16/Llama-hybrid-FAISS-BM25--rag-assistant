Stop, drop and roll is a simple fire safety technique taught to children, emergency service personnel and industrial workers as a component of health and safety training in some of the anglophone world, particularly in North America. It involves three steps fire victims should follow to minimize injury in the event their clothing catches fire.

Procedure
Stop, drop and roll consists of three components:

 Stop – The fire-affected person stops, ceasing any movement which may fan the flames or hamper those attempting to put the fire out.
 Drop – The fire-affected person drops to the ground, lying down if possible, covering his face with his hands to avoid facial injury.
 Roll – The fire-affected person rolls on the ground in an effort to extinguish the fire by depriving it of oxygen. If the victim is on a rug or one is nearby, he can roll the rug around himself to further extinguish the flame.

The effectiveness of stop, drop and roll may be further enhanced by combining it with other firefighting techniques, including the use of a fire extinguisher, dousing with water or fire beating one's skin.

Those teaching the technique are advised to teach children the proper circumstances for its use. As such, some advice pamphlets regarding the technique suggest reminding children that this technique is only to be used in the event of catching on fire and not when a smoke alarm is sounding in a situation that requires immediate evacuation. Furthermore, some advice on the technique advises the procedure of "stop, drop and roll and cover your face," as this will help to protect the face from any flames.
