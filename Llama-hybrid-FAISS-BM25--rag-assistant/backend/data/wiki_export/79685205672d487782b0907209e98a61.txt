The second cycle of America's Next Top Model, premiered on January 13, 2004, and was hosted by model Tyra Banks. The show aimed to find the next top fashion model. The cycle's catchphrase was "They are all gorgeous, but only one has what it takes."

The prizes for this cycle were a contract with IMG Models, a fashion spread and a cover in
Jane magazine, and a cosmetics campaign with Sephora.

This was the only season to feature a cast of twelve contestants, as well the only season prior to  cycle 16 to not have a casting episode. The international destination for the cycle was Milan, Italy, marking the show’s first visit to Southern Europe and the first of three visits to Italy. 

The winner was 23-year-old Yoanna House from Jacksonville, Florida with Mercedes Scelba-Shorte placing as the runner up.

This was also the first appearance of Nigel Barker as a judge and the only season to feature Eric Nicholson as a judge.
