History
On 4 August 1913, the club was founded as Sport Club Arromba. Rio Branco's first board of directors was composed by João Truzzi, who was one of the club's founders, and by 26 other people. In 1917, the club was renamed to Rio Branco Football Club, after the Baron of Rio Branco.

In 1922 and in 1923, the club won the Campeonato Paulista do Interior. During the final years of the 1940s, the club's football section was closed.

In 1961, the club's name was translated to the Portuguese language, becoming Rio Branco Futebol Clube. In April, 1979, Rio Branco and another local team, called Americana Esporte Clube, fused, and the club's football section was reactivated.

One year after, without the bigger teams of the state, the 'Tiger' obtained the 3rd place of Campeonato Paulista.
