Blade is an action game based on the 1998 film Blade and a prequel to it. It was developed by HammerHead for the PlayStation in 2000, and by HAL Laboratory and Avit Inc. for the Game Boy Color. The game was published by Activision, and follows the adventure of Blade with help of his mentor and friend Abraham Whistler. Reviews were mixed, with criticism of the graphics, camera, controls, and voice acting.

Gameplay
The player takes control of Blade as he makes his way through various vampire-infested locations in order to defeat the head vampire menace. The player ventures through warehouses, sewers, museums, city streets, and nightclubs dispatching numerous types of enemies ranging from familiars (humans that do a vampire's bidding), vampires, zombies, monsters, killer dogs, and other creatures of the night. Blade has a small arsenal of weapons to arm himself with courtesy of Whistler. Blade has his sword but can use his fists as well as a variety of firearms including pistols, shotguns, and machine pistols. Each firearm has three different types of ammunition: standard, explosive, and silver, each with its own effect on different enemies. Blade is equipped with a "multi-launcher" that can shoot all sorts of things to kill vampires, like silver glaives and UV grenades.

Reception

The PlayStation version of Blade received mixed reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. David Smith of IGN called it "Much too little much too late. There might have been a good game here once, but not anymore." Samuel Bass of NextGen said, "With the actual film available on DVD for half the price, why waste your time with this inferior spin-off?"

The Game Boy version received more positive reviews. Marc Nix of IGN called it "Violent, visceral, bloody action on the Game Boy Color, just how you like it."
