The Israel Center for Social and Economic Progress is an independent pro-market public policy thinktank founded in 1983 by Daniel Doron to promote basic structural reform in Israel's economy. Its British Friends include members of the Jewish-British community such as Gerald Ronson and Barry Townsley. The center has also received funding from Sam Zell.

ICSEP was credited by then finance minister Binyamin Netanyahu as having provided â€œtruly invaluable assistance" in helping bring about the country's 2005 capital market reform bill and additional tax reform.
