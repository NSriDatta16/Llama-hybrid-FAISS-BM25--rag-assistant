Badger's 20-yard shuttle time of 4.13 seconds was the fastest of any offensive lineman that year, and to this day is still the fastest time by any offensive guard or tackle officially timed at the NFL Combine, having only been matched in 2017 by Jessamen Dunker of Tennessee State.

Initially projected to be a late first day selection, Badger was drafted in the fifth round on day two of the 1997 NFL Draft by the Washington Redskins.

Washington Redskins (1997-1999)

In that start, Badger helped the Redskins to 198 rushing yards, their third-highest output of the season.  He finished the season as a reserve, playing in 12 games.

In Badger's second season, offensive line coach and former Redskins all-pro guard Russ Grimm and head coach Norv Turner, shuffled the offensive line around and moved Badger to left tackle. After ten starts at left tackle, Badger was moved back inside to left guard.  He started all 16 games in 1998.

In year three for Badger in DC, he was primarily used as a backup at offensive guard.  He played in 14 games, missing 2 with an ankle injury, and started 4 games.

In 2001, he moved into the starting lineup after longtime incumbent Todd Steussie was released for cap considerations.
