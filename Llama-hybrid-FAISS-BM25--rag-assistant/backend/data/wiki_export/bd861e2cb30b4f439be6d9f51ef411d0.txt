History

The current station was built in 1956-1959 by the Delaware & Hudson Railway, as a replacement for an 1880-built structure at another location, which currently serves as a private residence. The 1950s-era structure was mostly torn down in 2002, and a temporary trailer was used as the station until the current station was completed in 2004. The brick exterior from the former structure was retained and covered with wooden facing high across the front and green trim on the doors and windows the rest of the building was rebuilt into a modern, high-ceilinged facility with a skylight in the center of the station.
The facade features a 54-foot frieze by Anne Diggory, Alice Manzi, and Beverly Mastrianni.
