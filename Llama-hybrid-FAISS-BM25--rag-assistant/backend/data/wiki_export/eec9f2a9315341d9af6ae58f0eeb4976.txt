Fantasoft was a computer game company which programmed and promoted a number of shareware games with a primary focus on the Apple Macintosh platform. Fantasoft has been dormant since about 2005. It was founded by Sean Sayrs, Peter Hagen, and Tim Phillips. Fantasoft was created to develop, market, and distribute the shareware game Realmz, which was MacUser Shareware Game of the Year in 1995â€“96. Following the success of Realmz, Fantasoft created or marketed other Macintosh and Microsoft Windows platform games, most notably Spiderweb Software's early Exile series.
