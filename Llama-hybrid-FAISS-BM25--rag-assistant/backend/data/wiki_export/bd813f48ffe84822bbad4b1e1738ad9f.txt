My Daughter the Broad is an album by the American band the Frogs, released in 1996. It is a compilation of improvised homemade recordings that were mostly recorded in the late 1980s. Many of the songs continue themes from It's Only Right and Natural, such as homosexual supremacy and social conservative fears.

The album introduces two new personas of Dennis Flemion, with distinct-sounding voices, a geriatric pervert and the high-pitched murderer Jack, as in the songs "Reelin' and Rockin #1" and "I'm Evil, Jack." Fans often request songs from the album in concert, but the band refuses to play some of them because of the difficulties involved with re-creating an improvisation in a live setting. The title was inspired by Mudhoney's My Brother the Cow.

Critical reception

Magnet wrote that the album "confounded and titillated with tunes about male and female sexual deviances, study-hall pervert mutilation, molestation fantasies and other songs that raised eyebrows yet made no sense ... one of the funniest albums ever made."
