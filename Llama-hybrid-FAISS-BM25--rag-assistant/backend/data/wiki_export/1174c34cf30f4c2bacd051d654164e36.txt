Laurenzana (Lucano: ) is a town and comune in the province of Potenza, in the region of Basilicata (southern Italy). It rises on a spur between the torre Camastro and the wood surrounding the Serrapotamo valley.

History
Laurenzana's origins probably date from the 12th century when the Normans decided to build a fortified village in this area due to its strategic position.  In 1268 Laurenzana took part in the Ghibelline revolt against Pope Clement IV.  During the Aragonese domination, it was ruled by the Orsini del Balzo and then in the 15th century by the Loffredos followed by the Filangieris the De Ruggieros, the De Quartos and the Belgioiosos.

Main sights

The ruins of the 12th to 13th-century Laurenzana Castle are found on a crag atop the village. 

The Chiesa Madre dell'Assunta with a stone portal dating from 1780 is the main church. It has a polychrome marble main altar, and a 16th-century fresco along with 18th-century Neapolitan school altarpieces.

Near the Assunta there is a belvedere from which it is possible to view the surrounding valleys and mountains. Near town is a trail in the Abetina ("Fir-wood") of Laurenzana, covering an area of  on which silver firs and beech trees grow.  The Societ√† Botanica Italiana has considered the Abetina as a biotope of extraordinary environmental interest and has designated it a "Riserva Naturale Regionale".

The Church of the Madonna del Carmine houses a 1611 canvas painted by Giovanni Battista Serra from Tricarico.

Economy
Up to a few years ago, Laurenzana was famous for the production of high quality liquors produced in four distilleries situated within the village.  Handicraft activities regarding the manufacture of wooden barrels, bagpipes and wrought-iron were also widespread.  The economy of the village is mainly based on agriculture; in fact, it is possible to find silviculture and animal breeding farms producing delicious dairy products.
