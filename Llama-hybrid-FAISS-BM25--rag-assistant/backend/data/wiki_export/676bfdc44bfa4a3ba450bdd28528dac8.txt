History
Watoga State Park’s name comes from the Cherokee word for “starry waters.”  The land that forms the nucleus of Watoga was originally acquired in January 1925, when the park was initially planned to be a state forest.  In May 1934, a decision was made to instead develop the site as a state park.  Much of the development on the site was done by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and the park was first opened on July 1, 1937. Development of the park stopped during WWII, but after the war, work on the park resumed, and the first camping area opened in 1953, and eight deluxe cabins opened in 1956. Recreational use of the park increased during the 60s and 70s, requiring the addition of another camping area. Today, the park is supported by the Watoga State Park Foundation which promotes the recreation, conservation, ecology, history, and natural resources of the park.
