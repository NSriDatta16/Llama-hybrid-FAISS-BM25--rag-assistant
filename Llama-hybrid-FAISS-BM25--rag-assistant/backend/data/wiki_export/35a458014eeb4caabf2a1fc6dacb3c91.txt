No section of State Road 156 in Indiana is included in the National Highway System (NHS).  The NHS is a network of highways that are identified as being most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation.  The highway is maintained by the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) like all other state roads in the state. The department tracks the traffic volumes along all state roads as a part of its maintenance responsibilities using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). This measurement is a calculation of the traffic level along a segment of roadway for any average day of the year. In 2010, INDOT figured that lowest traffic levels were 1,400 vehicles and 100 commercial vehicles used the highway daily between Florence and Patriot. The peak traffic volumes were 6,180 vehicles and 500 commercial vehicles AADT along the section of SR 156 at is within Vevay.
