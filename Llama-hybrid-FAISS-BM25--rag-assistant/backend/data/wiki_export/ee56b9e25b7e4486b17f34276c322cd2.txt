Star Theatres was an American movie theatre chain, initially owned and operated by Loeks Star Partners and Loews Cineplex Entertainment, and later by AMC Theatres.

Star Theatres was founded as a partnership between Jim and Barrie Loeks and Columbia Pictures Entertainment, Inc., the company that owned Loews Theatres in the 1980s. The Loeks, who were based in Michigan before becoming co-CEOs of Sony Loews Theatres in 1992, designed and operated the Star Theatres chain. Based solely in Michigan, Star was known for having exceptional service, extravagant interior designs, many screens, and in some cases, stadium-style seating. The chain made the Summer 1990 Entertainment Weekly Honor Roll for movie theaters with the late Detroit Free Press critic Kathy Huffhines declaring, "IT'S FRIENDLY, kicky, and cute and looks like a bright red-and-white jukebox from the outside.". The slogan was "Love*Laugh*Live" and "Larger than Life".

The chain came to prominence in the late 1980s and early 1990s as more audiences chose to view films at a megaplex. Over time, some locations shut down or moved, while others thrived. The Southfield, Michigan and Auburn Hills, Michigan locations were considered the flagships of the chain and remained very popular with local movie-goers. The Loeks sold their 50% interest in the chain to Loews Cineplex Theatres in 2002. The chain was subsequently sold to AMC Theatres in 2006 when Loews was purchased by AMC. The theaters were rebranded as AMC theatres in 2018. The Southfield location permanently closed in 2020, and the Fairlane Town Center location closed in 2022.
