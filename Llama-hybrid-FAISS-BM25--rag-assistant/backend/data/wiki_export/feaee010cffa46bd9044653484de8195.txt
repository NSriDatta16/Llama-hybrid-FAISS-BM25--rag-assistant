Christopher Kurt Bahr (born February 3, 1953) is a former professional American football and soccer player. He was a placekicker in the National Football League (NFL) and played midfielder in the North American Soccer League (NASL).

High school
Bahr attended Neshaminy High School in Langhorne, Pennsylvania.

College
Bahr attended Penn State, where he was named an All-American three times for soccer and once for football. He led the Nittany Lions in scoring in 1975, including four field goals over 50 yards. He averaged 39 yards in punts. Bahr graduated in 1975 with a Bachelor of Science in Biology and later earned a Juris Doctor at Southwestern University School of Law, attending school part-time while still playing with the Raiders.

Soccer
Bahr was the first round draft pick of the Philadelphia Atoms in the 1975 North American Soccer League draft. As a rookie midfielder, he made an immediate impression, tying an NASL scoring record for goals by a locally-born American by netting 11, including two 2-goal games and four game winners.  Bahr also netted the first sudden death goal in Atoms history against the New York Cosmos in front of 20,124 at Veterans Stadium. He was named the 1975 NASL Rookie of the Year. Bahr played 22 games for the Atoms, scoring 11 goals before departing for the NFL.

Bahr also joined his Atoms coach, Al Miller, on the 1976 U.S. National Team. He scored both goals for the United States in their 2–0 shutout of Bermuda in the qualifying rounds for the XXI Olympic Games in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

NFL
Bahr switched football codes in 1976, and was drafted by the Cincinnati Bengals, becoming their placekicker. He played four seasons for the Bengals before being acquired by the Oakland Raiders in 1980; he played for them for most of the 1980s, following them to Los Angeles in 1982, becoming a stalwart placekicker with them that saw him win two Super Bowl championships. He is the Raiders' second all-time leader in scoring (817 points), and his 162 career field goals was a Raiders record until 2007 when it was surpassed by Sebastian Janikowski. Bahr kicked in two Raiders Super Bowl victories, (1981 and 1984). Perhaps his best year as a pro came in 1983 when he compiled a 78% field goal percentage. He finished his career with a strong season, kicking 17 field goals and 29 PATs for the San Diego Chargers in 1989.

He was named to the All-Rookie team in 1976 and a Sporting News All-AFC in 1977.
