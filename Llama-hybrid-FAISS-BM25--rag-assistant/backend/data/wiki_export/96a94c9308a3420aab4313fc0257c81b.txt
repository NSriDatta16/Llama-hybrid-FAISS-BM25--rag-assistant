The anterior clinoid process is a bilaterally paired posterior projection of the sphenoid bone at the junction of the medial end of either lesser wing of sphenoid bone with the body of sphenoid bone. The two anterior clinoid processes flank the pituitary fossa anteriorly. The free border of the tentorium cerebelli attaches onto the anterior clinoid processes. A middle clinoid process is situated medial to each anterior clinoid process, with the internal carotid artery passing between the two (i.e. medial to the anterior clinoid process.)

Anatomy

Attachments 
The free border of the tentorium cerebelli extends anteriorly on either side beyond the attached border of the same side (which ends anteriorly at the posterior clinoid process) to ultimately end by attaching onto the anterior clinoid process.

Etymology
The anterior and posterior clinoid processes surround the sella turcica like the four corners of a four poster bed. Cline is Greek for bed. â€“oid, as usual, indicates a similarity to. The term may also come from the Greek root klinein or the Latin clinare, both meaning "sloped" as in "inclined".
