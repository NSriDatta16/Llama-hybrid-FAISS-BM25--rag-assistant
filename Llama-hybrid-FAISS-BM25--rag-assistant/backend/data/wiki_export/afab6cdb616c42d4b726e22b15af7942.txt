Espers was an American psychedelic folk band from Philadelphia, United States, that was part of the emerging indie folk scene. They formed in 2002 as a trio of singer-songwriter Greg Weeks, Meg Baird and Brooke Sietinsons but later expanded to a sextet including Otto Hauser, Helena Espvall and Chris Smith.  Their music is reminiscent of late-sixties British folk as well as many contemporary folk acts.  Most of the band's members have also featured on recordings by a number of other folk artists such as Nick Castro and Vashti Bunyan and as a result have become an important part of the psychedelic folk revival.

They released their self-titled debut in 2004 on Time-Lag Records and followed that with an album of cover songs, The Weed Tree, in 2005.  This release featured the band's versions of songs by artists as diverse as Nico, The Durutti Column and Blue Ã–yster Cult.  In 2006 the band released their third full-length album, II (presumably so called because it was their second album of original material), on Drag City Records.  Their fourth album, III, was released on October 20, 2009.
