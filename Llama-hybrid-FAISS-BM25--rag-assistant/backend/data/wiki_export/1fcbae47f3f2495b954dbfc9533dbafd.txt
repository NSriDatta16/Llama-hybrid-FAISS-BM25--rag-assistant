The Show is the Rainbow is an American music act from Lincoln, Nebraska, United States, aka Darren Keen. For much of 2006, The Show is the Rainbow toured as a three-piece, with Javid Dabestani and Jim Schroeder playing alongside Keen. Currently, Keen is touring as a one-man band. The Show is the Rainbow plays an eclectic mix of rock, electronica and hip-hop inspired by artists such as The Faint, Frank Zappa, Nina Hagen, Les Savy Fav, Squarepusher and Beck. The Show is the Rainbow has gained a national following by means of near constant touring and energetic live shows that focus on audience interaction.

Darren Keen has gained notoriety for his commentary on indie fashion and scene icons such as Conor Oberst and Saddle Creek.  This is most notable in the song "Up a Creek without a Saddle." Darren Keen also produced his own version of the fake interview from Bright Eyes' own Fevers and Mirrors, where he discusses cocaine, trite symbolism and indie scene stereotypes. This was in response to being "called out" in a hidden track that appears on Criteria's En Garde.
