Riverdale High School (often abbreviated as RHS) was an English language secondary school,  in the Pierrefonds-Roxboro borough of Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The school was part of the Lester B. Pearson School Board and was designated a "community school".

History 
Riverdale had many athletic teams, including basketball, rugby, soccer, volleyball, track and field, and swim teams. The school also had a wide variety of community-based clubs and organizations.

In 1971, the Riverdale Band won the International Band competition held in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan.

In 1972, an expansion of the original building took place.

The logo visible to the right and the slogan "Reach Higher and Succeed" were adopted during the 1988-1989 school year after they were chosen in a schoolwide contest. Both were submitted by students at the time. The school's official colours were blue (a dark navy blue) and Grey, with the school paper having the matching name "Blue & Grey," but they were changed to match the uniforms adopted in 1993, whose colours were also selected by the student body. Before that the school had no uniform but only a dress code with rules such as "no jeans" and "no clothes with holes."

A dwindling student populace made Riverdale apportion out half of its first floor to a French-language elementary school in 1988 to share costs, leaving the other two floors to the high school, along with the other half of the first floor, which included the cafeteria, shop classes, and music department. Later in 2007, the school got the full first floor back.

In 2011, the main hallway, which was used for the junior grades was closed off for adult education because of its low student population, but the cafeteria was still very much part of the school, as were the drama department, music department and shop classes, situated on the first floor.

In 2017, the second-floor hallway, which had previously run a full rectangular loop, was closed off roughly a fourth of the way through to make more space to be used for adult education which shared the building. 

In 2019, the school was forced to close and merge with the nearby Pierrefonds Comprehensive High School by the Minister of Education at the time, Jean-François Roberge. The building transferred over to the French-speaking Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board which had been struggling with overcrowding issues.

The building now houses the De L'Altitude high school.
