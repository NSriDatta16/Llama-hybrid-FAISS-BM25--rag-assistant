History

The Delaware General Assembly created Delaware Technical Community College in 1966 with the approval of House Bill 529, signed into law by then-Governor Charles L. Terry, Jr. The first Delaware Tech campus opened its doors in Sussex County in September 1967 with Dr. Paul K. Weatherly serving as the first president. Three hundred sixty-seven students enrolled in the first year. Enrolment doubled in the second year, and the construction of new laboratories and classrooms began. The Southern Campus was renamed in 1995 to the "Owens Campus" in honor of its first campus director, Jack F. Owens. In 1968, a Northern Campus was opened with 375 full-time students enrolled in the first year. A multi-campus facility was created, and the Stanton and Wilmington locations were opened in 1973 and 1974, respectively. With a Delaware Tech campus in both Sussex and New Castle Counties, it was determined that 47% of high school juniors and seniors in Kent County said they would be interested in a Kent County branch of Delaware Tech. In response to this need, Kent Campus was established in Dover in 1972, and the name was later changed to "Terry Campus" in honor of Governor Charles Terry, who was a motivating force behind the establishment of the college. The President's Office, located adjacent to the Terry Campus, functions as a central office by providing various services in support of the campuses.
