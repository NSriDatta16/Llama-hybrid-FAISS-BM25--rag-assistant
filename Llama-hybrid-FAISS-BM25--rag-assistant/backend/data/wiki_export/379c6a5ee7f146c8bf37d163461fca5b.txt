2015 Hugo Awards controversy
In July 2015, in the midst of the "Sad Puppies/Rabid Puppies" controversy, Antonelli (whose nomination for the Hugo Award for Best Short Story was part of both "Puppies" slates for the Hugo ballot) wrote a letter to the Spokane Police Department telling them to be on the lookout for World science fiction convention Guest of Honor David Gerrold (who was scheduled to be master of ceremonies at the award ceremony in Spokane) as a person who may incite violence calling him "insane and a public danger and needs to be watched when the convention’s going on."

Antonelli later apologized, and Gerrold accepted the apology, saying "Let's put this one to bed, once and for all. Lou Antonelli did something dumb. People were outraged. Someone who cared about him held up a mirror and he recognized he was (in his words) turning into his own crazy uncle. He apologized. I'm satisfied that his apology was sincere. And that should be the end of it."

Personal life
He was married to Patricia (Randolph) Antonelli, a Dallas native.

Antonelli died suddenly at the age of 64 at his residence in Clarksville, Texas.
