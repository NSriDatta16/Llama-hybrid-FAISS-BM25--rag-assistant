Critical reception

Entertainment Weekly (12/1/95, p. 77) – "...hits like the groundbreaking 'Boyz-N-the-Hood' and the funky 'We Want Eazy' are enjoyably raw (and music history to boot)." – Rating: B+
Melody Maker (1/13/96, p. 29) – Recommended – "...those old pre-Compton solo tracks...are still the absolute f***ing bomb, even with, in fact, because of, the dated production....[His] was the first voice in hip hop that could be called weak...and thus it was petulantly aggressive in a way that was entirely new."
Rap Pages (2/96, p. 31) – 9 (out of 10) – "...a historical biography of Eazy-E's music that is a must-have for the archives...this compilation documents the life of one of West Coast rap's most important contributors."
NME (1/6/96, p. 33) – 7 (out of 10) – "...is as elegiac as it is capitalistic....[These are] graphic accounts and celebrations of streetlife designed to cause maximum offence to anyone who doesn't try to understand the social context..."
