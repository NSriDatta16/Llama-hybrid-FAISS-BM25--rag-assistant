The Congregation of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Bourg grew out of the Congregation of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Lyon which had been disbanded during the French Revolution. The Sisters of Saint Joseph was revived as a congregation in 1807 at Lyons, during the Napoleonic regime through the efforts of Mother Saint John Fontbonne. In 1819 a daughter house was established in Bourg, which became an independent congregation in 1823. In 1977 the United States provinces of the Bourg congregation separated to form the Sisters of Saint Joseph of Medaille. In 1996 the Bourg congregation re-joined the founding congregation of Lyon, as part of the latter's European Province.

After establishing a central house in New Orleans, Louisiana, the Sisters extended their ministry to the poor and suffering of Louisiana and Mississippi, opening schools, hospitals and an orphanage.

Sisters of Saint Joseph of Medaille

In July 1977, the six provinces  voted to become two separate congregations, one based in Europe, the other in America. On November 30, 1977, Rome officially declared the three America provinces to be a new Congregation in the Church: the Sisters of Saint Joseph of Medaille. The name Medaille was chosen because it is the family name of the Jesuit priest who helped found the Sisters in 1650 and because the Sisters were geographically located in the north, central and southern areas of the United States. Sister Janet Roesener of Cincinnati, Ohio was chosen the first superior general.

In 1986 and in 1994 decisions were made to merge the three provinces into five regions headed by a Congregational Leadership Office composed of a president and three general councilors, in Cincinnati. The five regions are Baton Rouge, Cincinnati, Crookston, New Orleans, and the Twin Cities.
