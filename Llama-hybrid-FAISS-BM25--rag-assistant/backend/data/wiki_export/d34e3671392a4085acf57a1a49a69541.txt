Lambert Airport Terminal 1 station is a St. Louis MetroLink station. The station is connected to the eastern end of Terminal 1 at St. Louis Lambert International Airport. Terminal 1 serves Air Canada, Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Cape Air, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, Spirit Airlines, and United Airlines.

Station layout 
The station is accessed via a corridor on the ticketing level of Terminal 1, near Entry 2. An escalator or an elevator then takes passengers up to the platform level from the ticketing level.

Public artwork 
In 2014, Metro's Arts in Transit program commissioned the work Nucleic Life Formation by Amy Cheng for this station. This piece consists of two abstract mural designs, one over the station's escalators, the other adjacent to the platform entrance. Both designs are suggestive of striated nightscapes crossed by a constellation of “stars” that loosely mimics a DNA double helix.
