Club career
Romik Khachatryan began to get involved in football at age 7. Khachatryan began his youth career in SKA-Arai Echmiadzin. The then 16-year-old player played for the club for 11 games and was able to score 2 goals in the 1994 season. The club performed poorly that season, taking 14th place in the Armenian Premier League and was sent to the Armenian First League. Khachatryan joined Kilikia Yerevan. The club, who were soon merged with Pyunik Yerevan, played in season informal and formal, respectively. Following 1996, he joined BKMA Yerevan and stayed at the club for a long time. His first season for the club was initially not good. They had 7 defeats at the start of the Premier League. In the first round, the team finished with one win and 10 losses. Moreover, after the first match of the second round, the club withdrew from the championship and disbanded. Khachatryan himself played only three games and returned to Pyunik. From this period, Khachatryan went to take his career elsewhere. Successful performance for the club provided the opportunity to play in the Armenia national team. At the end of the 1998 Armenian Premier League, he made a transition into Araks Ararat. His skills developed in the new club and he was allowed half of the season to move to the Cypriot First Division. He played for Cypriot clubs Olympiakos Nicosia, APOEL Nicosia and Anorthosis Famagusta. He also returned to Armenia to play for Banants Yerevan, which made it to the finals of the 2008 Armenian Cup. Khachatryan currently plays for Lokomotiv Tashkent.
