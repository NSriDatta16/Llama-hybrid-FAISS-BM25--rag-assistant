Glemser also drove one time in Australia, partnering then 3-time and defending race winner Allan Moffat in Moffat's V8 powered Ford XB Falcon GT Hardtop in the 1974 Hardie-Ferodo 1000 at the Mount Panorama Circuit. After numerous engine and transmission troubles in practice (which saw them qualify in 15th) and again in the race, the Falcon was retired from the 163 lap race on lap 92. The Allan Moffat Racing team had gone into the race as favourites after Moffat easily won the traditional lead up event to Bathurst, the Sandown 250 just one month earlier.
