Scotcampus is an independent student magazine in Scotland. The paper is put together using a combination of freelance journalists and student writers from across Scotland. It is distributed throughout various locations in all of Scotland's major towns and cities.

Background
Scotcampus was founded by Graeme Barratt and Anna Purdie, who launched it in 2001. The magazine operates as a lifestyle publication, using approachable and inspiring journalism to reach student readers across all campuses in Scotland. In October 2012 Jennifer Lynn was named as the editor of Scotcampus. The magazine is published on a bimonthly basis.

Since it was founded Scotcampus has interviewed a number of different high-profile musicians, politicians, actors, directors and people of interest. Some of the most notable have included: The Prodigy, Dizzee Rascal,  Alex Salmond, Michelle Mone, Alastair Campbell, Armando Iannucci, Howard Marks, and Sir Tom Hunter.

Freshers' Festival

Since 2007, Scotcampus has hosted a Student Freshers' Festival that is open to all students at university and college from 16 years old and up, and takes place in Glasgow annually. The Freshers' Festival attracts more than 10,000 students and young people from across Scotland by offering up a selection of bands, DJ's, free gifts and contact with local organisations, job opportunities and internships. Some of the onstage performances of previous years include fashion shows, dancers, rap battles, cheerleaders and yoga classes. Food exhibitors offer the students discounts and even free food and drinks. Previous exhibitors at the Festival have been wide-ranging and have included Urban Outfitters, Royal Air Force, Domino's Pizza, Ernst & Young, Papa John's and YO! Sushi. In 2010 the Freshers' Festivals expanded into Edinburgh. Both events were powered with renewable energy.
