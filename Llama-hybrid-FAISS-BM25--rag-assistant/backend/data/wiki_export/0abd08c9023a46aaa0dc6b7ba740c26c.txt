History
NC 610 was established in 1930 as a connector route running from US 311/NC 77 to its parent route NC 61, following its present-day routing. its routing has remained unchanged since. By 1940, NC 61 was replaced with NC 62 forming the current eastern terminus of the highway. On September 8, 2011, US 311 was deleted along Main Street and placed along a new freeway concurrency with I-74. This left the western terminus of NC 610 without an official highway designation.
