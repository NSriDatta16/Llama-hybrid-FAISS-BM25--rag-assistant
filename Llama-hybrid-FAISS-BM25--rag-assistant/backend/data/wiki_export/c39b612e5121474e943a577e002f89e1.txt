Batman Black and White refers to the comic book limited series published by DC Comics featuring 8-page black and white Batman stories. Volumes 1, 4 and 5 of the series feature all-new stories (published in 1996, 2013–14, and 2020–21, respectively), while Vol. 2 and 3 contain stories from the back-up feature of the Batman: Gotham Knights comic book.

The series represents the first DC Comics work for future co-publisher Jim Lee, who drew the debut issue's cover, and the final DC work for Alex Toth, who drew the fourth issue's cover.

Publication history
The origin of the series is told by editor Mark Chiarello in his introduction to the first collection, in which he writes about a dinner table-discussion with "a few famous comic-book artists", at which they pondered the "desert island" question in terms of a single complete run of comics one would be happy to be stranded with. Ultimately, with "half a minute"'s thought, they "amazingly... all agreed, pound for pound, page for page" that the unequivocal choice was Warren Publishing's Creepy, a high point unmatched since "there has never been such a collection of stellar artists assembled under one banner publication" as in Creepy, whose pages were host to (among others) "Toth, Frazetta, Williamson, Torres, Colan, Ditko, Wrightson, Corben etc." Chiarello notes that "most of those stories" were written by one man: Archie Goodwin, described as "probably the very best editor ever to work in comics, probably the very best writer ever to work in comics" (and early mentor to Chiarello when the two worked at Marvel), whose Warren work was itself an "homage to the favorite comics of his youth, the E.C. line".

When Chiarello became a Batman editor "a whole bunch of years" later, he naturally "pitch[ed] the idea of a black and white anthology". Told by many colleagues that it would not sell - both because it was an anthology and because it was a black-and-white title, neither of which were purportedly widely liked by comics readers - the idea was green-lit, and Mike Carlin and Scott Peterson joined Chiarello to "make sure [he] didn't destroy the integrity of [Batman]".

Chiarello's initial thought, which was "to hire the very best artists in the business" led him and Peterson to assemble a wish list of creators to contact. The series ultimately became "a creative and financial success" when the first four-issue volume was published between June and September 1996. There was also a free preview issued in 1996. Each of the four issues featured several self-contained short-stories, all written and drawn by a diverse group of comic artists and writers, most of whom had previously worked on Batman comics. Each story varied in theme, setting, and tone (depending on the creative team involved), offering multiple interpretations of Batman - and, in some cases, his supporting characters - usually by exploring their inner pathos and relationships. The series was the first DC Comics work for future Co-Publisher Jim Lee, who drew the debut issue's cover, and the final DC work for Alex Toth, who drew the fourth issue's cover.

Contents and synopses

This contains all-new material.

Issue #1 - June 1996

 "Two of a Kind" - by Bruce Timm
 A Gotham news anchor comments on the biggest story of the year: a brilliant reconstructive surgeon, Marilyn Crane, has been able to repair the damage done to Two-Face, which cures him of his insanity and restores his Harvey Dent identity. Dent plans to marry Marilyn, but becomes nervous when he discovers that she has a twin sister named Madeline who is mentally unbalanced herself (Marilyn explains that she kept the information from him to prevent Two-Face's obsession with duality from resurfacing). Madeline and Harvey begin an affair, but when Dent decides to end the relationship and return to his wife-to-be, she is driven insane with rage and murders Marilyn. Harvey's therapy and surgery prevent him from tapping into his darker side, so he deliberately scars his face with hot coals, travels to Gotham's docks, and kills Madeline. He then waits for Batman to come and take him back to Arkham "with the rest of the crazy people", bitterly resigning himself to a life of madness as Two-Face.
 "The Hunt" - by Joe Kubert

The Caped Crusader eventually tracks down the culprit—a nondescript Gothamite who believes that he is doing the world a service by forcing people to pay closer attention to their behavior. After Batman apprehends the criminal, he assures the Dark Knight that the two of them are actually performing the same work to save the city, and even offers to be a "sidekick" to the hero when he gets out of jail.

However, he explains that in order to know he is truly a good person, he needs to perform a single horrific act and thus prove that he does not want to pursue a life of evil. The young man has decided that the only appropriate crime is murdering Batman, and outlines his plot to do so, explaining that, rather than Batman's many themed villains and rogues, he will simply shoot Batman in the head and vanish. After asserting his status as an "innocent guy", the young man swears that the Caped Crusader's murder will be his only villainous deed, and imagines his life going to back to its regular banality (this story would later be packaged with the 2008 re-release of Batman: The Killing Joke, with full coloring).

Contents
 "Case Study" - written by Paul Dini, art by Alex Ross (new material)
 When the Joker is once again captured and sent back to Arkham Asylum, a doctor laments that all of his work has not pierced the Clown Prince of Crime's insanity. Another doctor offers up a report written years ago, which suggests that the Joker cannot be cured because he is not insane. The report outlines the Joker's history before his accident, and suggests that his "revenge" against Gotham for ruining him is to commit perfectly sane crimes under the guise of madness. The doctors are at first convinced, but Harleen Quinzel is then escorted past, commenting that she was the one who wrote the report prior to her personal sessions with the Joker. The doctors then wearily put the document away, realizing that though it is plausible, its origin renders it worthless - it is just another one of the Joker's sadistic jokes, left where it would someday be found, examined, and ultimately dismissed; a spot of hope that is crushed just as it shines brightest.

All of it is essential to some cases, such as tracking down a pregnant prostitute's murderer - a political candidate.
 Untitled - by John Byrne (originally published in Gotham Knights #2)
 Batman and Robin capture Thick and Thin Lyman and their gang, but neither they nor the police can get them to reveal any further information about a major shipment of drugs due in the city. The Lymans suddenly get bailed surprisingly easily, but find their every move dogged by either Batman or Robin, night and day.

However, once there, Thick reveals himself as Batman, but refuses to tell Thin when the switch took place.
 "Broken Nose" - by Paul Pope (originally published in Gotham Knights #3)
 Alfred treats Bruce Wayne for the first broken nose he has sustained in his career as a crimefighter. It was given him by Mabuse, a criminal who designed a metallic suit of armor for himself (the Dark Knight derisively calls Mabuse a "geek in a trashcan"). After Alfred reassures him that a broken nose is something of a rite of passage for people who fight, Batman tracks Mabuse down to the scene of his next crime, fights him, and emerges victorious. Though Mabuse surrenders, Batman makes sure to provide a final bit of revenge against the villain by breaking his nose.

 "The Best of Gotham" - by Jill Thompson (originally published in Gotham Knights #44)
 A newspaper-style text and 'photos' guide to some of Gotham's "must-see" highlights, including mentions of the philanthropy of Gotham's most famous son, as well as the inspirational activities of the city's protector, which can be seen in the theaters, stand-up clubs, clothes shops, night clubs and a tailored museum: "Hideout" showcasing some of the items confiscated from Batman's rogues gallery, and funded by the Martha Wayne Outreach program.
 "Sidekick" - written by Kimo Temperance, art by Nathan Fox (originally published in Gotham Knights #45)
 Batman has to carry out his patrol while babysitting a child who has been abandoned on the Batmobile by someone eager for fame.
 "Urban Renewal" - written by Will Pfeifer, art by Brent Anderson (originally published in Gotham Knights #46)
 Writer/photographer Daniel McKinley notes the changing face of Gotham - and the world - from the kitsch architecture of "buildings shaped like cash registers" to the faceless conformity of the modern era. Turned down by publisher after publisher, he has almost resigned himself to writing a book about "gargoyle-covered skyscrapers", when his proposal is accepted by Signal Publishing, a division of Wayne Enterprises. Bruce Wayne, like McKinley, has a keen sense of nostalgia. A related story - Dean Motter's "Gargoyles of Gotham" - explains more on these iconic structures.
 "Riddle Me This" - written by Judd Winick, art by Whilce Portacio (originally published in Gotham Knights #47)
 The Riddler, in a series of highlights from across his career, runs through a series of riddles before settling on one which describes his nemesis, as well as indulging in a spot of soul-searching, concluding that he wants to be caught.
 "The Mob is Dead, Long Live the Mob" - by Eric Cherry (originally published in Gotham Knights #48)
 A former snitch tries to set himself up as a new mob boss, using Batman as a cover by feeding him information about minor drug deals while the major ones are carried out with impunity. The new "boss" is ultimately brought low by another snitch who fears that Batman is now in the employ of the gangs.
 "Fear is the Key" - written by Geoff Johns, art by Tommy Castillo and Rodney Ramos     (originally published in Gotham Knights #49)
 The Scarecrow runs through a litany of phobias, and regrets that his own addiction to fear has been compromised by an increasing immunity to his toxins. There is always something to fear, however, and for the Scarecrow, Batman is both the ultimate fear and the ultimate thrill.
 "The Gasworks" - written by Mike Mignola, art by Troy Nixey (originally published in Gotham Knights #36)
 Two villains attempt to use a powerful hallucinogenic compound to incapacitate Batman and kill him. In an ironic twist of events, they manage to disable him enough that he cannot subsequently come to their rescue.
Note: "The Gasworks" is the only Black and White story to include color - red permeates the story, the color of both the hallucinogen and the blood. This is likely the reason this story was moved to the end of the volume.

Issue #1 - November 2013
 "Don't Know Where, Don't Know When" - written by Chip Kidd, art by Michael Cho
 "Batman Zombie" - by Neal Adams
 The Caped Crusader has seemingly been turned into a ghoulish zombie, but still attempts to pursue his rogues gallery. As he does, he encounters various Gotham citizens who are suffering from unjust laws and cruel practices, including a woman being evicted from her home because of a bank's miscommunication and a man serving a life sentence for breaking a "three strikes" policy. The story's events are then revealed to be a nightmare Batman is having; when he awakens, he decides that is time to use his Bruce Wayne identity to help in the fight against a less dramatic, but still oppressive, evil.
 "Justice is Served" - written by Maris Wicks, art by Joe Quinones
 Harley Quinn robs Gotham Burger, a new fast food restaurant, only to discover that anyone who eats its products bloats into a spherical ball covered in leaves. Harley suspects Poison Ivy of tainting the meals, but Ivy claims innocence and realizes that Max Glyson, a rival scientist who studied with her under Jason Woodrue, is trying to frame her. The women team up to defeat Glyson and expose his crimes, with Batman providing support and a means for Ivy to cure the citizens suffering from Gotham Burger's effects—including the Joker, who inadvertently ate some of the food that Harley brought to his lair.
 "Driven" - written by John Arcudi, art by Sean Murphy
 Batman works on repairing the Batmobile after a chase with Roxy Rocket, a daredevil stuntwoman-turned-supervillain. As he works on the car's amazing technology, he recalls the intense pursuit—which surprisingly ended in the Batmobile not breaking down. Eager for the chance to work on the vehicle further, Batman deliberately sabotaged the engine and claimed that Roxy's actions were to blame; a sharp-eyed Alfred sees through the ruse, but decides to let Bruce have his fun regardless.
 "Head Games" - written by Howard Mackie, art by Chris Samnee

Issue #2 - December 2013
 "Manbat Out of Hell" - written by Dan Didio, art by J. G. Jones
 Batman pursues Dr. Kirk Langstrom, who has broken out of Arkham Asylum to attack an orphanage. The Caped Crusader fears that Man-Bat is after the children staying in the building, but discovers them unharmed in a bedroom upstairs. Closer investigation reveals that the orphans are being abused by their caretaker, who is Man-Bat's actual target. Batman helps Dr. Langstrom apprehend the criminal, and Man-Bat takes a few moments to spend time with two of the orphans, who are revealed to be his own children that, despite his monstrous transformation, he remembers and swears to protect. 
 "Into the Circle" - by Rafael Grampá
 "A Place in Between" - by Rafael Albuquerque
 Batman finds himself in a boat with Charon, crossing the River Styx. Charon tells him that he has died; to determine where he spends the afterlife, he must stay in the boat while witnessing horrific scenes from his own past. Batman struggles to contain himself and eventually breaks the rule by rushing to rescue Jason Todd. As he succumbs to grief, Charon inadvertently mentions that the Caped Crusader now understands fear—at which point Batman realizes that he is in another of the Scarecrow's toxin-induced hallucinations. He overpowers Scarecrow and congratulates him on a nearly-perfect ruse. 
 "Winter's End" - written by Jeff Lemire, art by Alex Nino
 "Silent Knight…Unholy Knight!" - written by Michael Uslan, art by Dave Bullock

Issue #3 - January 2014
 "Rule Number One" - by Lee Bermejo
 "Hall of Mirrors" - by Damion Scott
 "An Innocent Man" - written by Marv Wolfman, art by Riccardo Burchielli
 A criminal condemned for murder is set to be executed in twenty-four hours, but new evidence makes Batman believe that he might be innocent. He works against the clock to explore the new leads and discovers that the true killer was the victim's wife, who discovered her husband's infidelity and murdered him in a rage. Batman returns to release the condemned man, who is revealed to be none other than the Joker. The Caped Crusader further remarks that he knows the entire situation is one of the Clown Prince of Crime's trademark jokes—he arranged everything, including telling the victim's wife about her husband's affair, just to force Batman to rescue him. The Joker gloats that his release means that Batman shares culpability for his future crimes, but the Dark Knight responds that the villain now owes him his life, and that when he does defeat him, it will be in the name of justice, not revenge.
 "Namtab: Babel Comes to Gotham" - by Rian Hughes
 "Role Models" - written by Paul Dini, art by Stéphane Roux
 Batman and Commissioner Gordon receive a note from "Playground", a child abuser and kidnapper who targets prepubescent girls. Meanwhile, Playground's latest victim manages to escape her bonds and flees to Gotham's streets, hoping to find a superheroine to save her. Instead, the girl stumbles across Poison Ivy and Harley Quinn, who are preparing to rob a bank. Despite their criminal pasts, Ivy and Harley realize the girl's distress and work to defeat Playground, who even they find reprehensible. When Batman arrives on the scene to arrest the kidnapper, he is forced to let Ivy and Harley go at the child's request. The girl praises them as heroes, and Batman cannot help but smile as he agrees that for tonight, at least, the women are on the side of the angels.

Critical reaction
IGN Comics ranked Volume 1 of Batman: Black and White #13 on a list of the 25 greatest Batman graphic novels, saying: "Though having just eight pages to tell a story can certainly be confining, it also proves to be liberating. Forced to scrap complex plots but create something indelible, these tales are often parables, send-ups or unforgettable vignettes surrounding the Batman".

Merchandise

Statues

Several Batman: Black and White statues have been released by DC Collectibles. Some of these are based on designs used by various artists for their contributions to the three volumes of Black and White stories, but the line has expanded to include artwork from other titles as well as other characters.

Action figures
Starting in June 2018, some Batman action figures were re-released as black-and-white variants. They come with base stands that are similar to the ones used for the statues.

Mini PVC sets
Starting in May 2019, DC released mini PVC versions of some of the statues. These PVC versions were released in grouped box sets of seven at comics shops and in blind bags/boxes elsewhere.
