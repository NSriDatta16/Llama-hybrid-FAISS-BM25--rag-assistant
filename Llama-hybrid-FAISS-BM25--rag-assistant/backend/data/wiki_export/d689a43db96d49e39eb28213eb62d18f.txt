 Bridges 1 (Lakeshore Road Bridge), 3A (Carlton Street Bridge), 4 (Homer Bridge [Queenston Road]), 6 (Flight Locks Railway Bridge for Canadian National Railways), 19 (Main Street Bridge [Port Colborne]) and 19A (Mellanby Avenue Bridge) on the Welland Canal. Save for Bridges 3A and 19A, all of these were built during the late 1920s as part of the Fourth Canal expansion project (1913-1932). Bridge 3A was built to replace the original Bridge 3, which was destroyed in an accident. Bridge 19A was constructed in the 1980s to alleviate traffic on Bridge 19 (both bridges lie on either end of Lock 8). Bridge 4 is a twin-leaf, Chicago-type bascule bridge, with its counterweights located under the road deck. All the other bascule bridges on the Welland Canal are single-leaf Rall-type bridges, with counterweights suspended on a frame structure over the roadway.
