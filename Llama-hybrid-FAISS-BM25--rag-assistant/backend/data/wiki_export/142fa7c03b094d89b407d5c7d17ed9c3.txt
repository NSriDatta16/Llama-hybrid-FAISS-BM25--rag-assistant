Darrow School is a co-educational college-preparatory school for boarding and day students in grades 9-12 and PG. It is located in New Lebanon, New York.

History
Darrow opened in the fall of 1932 as the Lebanon School for Boys. In 1938 the president Charles S. Haight died, and C. Lambert Heyniger purchased the school, becoming its headmaster and treasurer. Heyniger was a Princeton alumnus who had taught as a missionary in China and then pursued graduate study at Columbia University before joining General Motors. After buying the school he renamed it in the Shaker tradition, after a family prominent among the religious colony. Heyniger redesigned parts of the campus and reorganized personnel and policy.

In 1963, three Darrow students set a fire and destroyed the century-old dining hall and fire leveled the 156-year-old gymnasium. Both fires threatened dormitories housing 175 pupils. The boys had hoped school officials would send all the pupils home until repairs were made.

Traditions

The strong visual traces of Shaker austerity stand in contrast with the modern and less conventional morés of some affluent students raised in such different moral settings. In an interview, teacher Ed Noggle stated that a fascination with ghosts resulted. "These young people," Noggle says, "are very much of this world, very sensual, sexual beings. It has always been a matter of 'Ha, ha, what would the Shakers do if they could see all this? They'd roll over in their graves.'"
