Auch is a family name which has two possible origins, one originating in southern Germany and the other in France.

The name Auch is common in Southern Germany as an occupational surname for those who watched livestock at night, from the Middle High German Uhte, which means "night watch", "night pasture", or "the time just before dawn".

The second origin is as a habitational name from the southern French town of Auch.
