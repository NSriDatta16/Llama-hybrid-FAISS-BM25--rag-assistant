The Clontarf Foundation is a not-for-profit organisation that assists in the education and employment of young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men.

Overview

With support from the corporate/philanthropic sector, state/Territory governments and the Federal Government, academies now operate in 141 schools in Western Australia, the Northern Territory, South Australia, Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria.

The founder and Chief Executive Officer is Gerard Neesham, former coach of Fremantle Football Club. Staff include former teachers, youth workers, professional football players and people from a range of industries.

The original Clontarf Football Academy was established in 2000 at the Clontarf Aboriginal College site in Waterford, Western Australia.  Since then, Clontarf academies have expanded to the Northern Territory, South Australia, Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria.
