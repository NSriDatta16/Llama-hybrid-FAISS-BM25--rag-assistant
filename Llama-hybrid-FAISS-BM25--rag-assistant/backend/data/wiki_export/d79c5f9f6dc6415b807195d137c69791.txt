History
The River Valley Local School District was founded in 1964 when the River Valley High School and Junior High School were created, along with adding Caledonia Elementary School, Claridon Elementary School, Martel Elementary School, and Waldo Elementary School to the district. Martel Elementary School was closed in the 1980s and remaining students from that community began attending Caledonia Elementary. In 2003 the new high school, middle school, and 2 elementary campuses were completed in new locations. Currently there are only two elementary schools - Heritage Elementary and Liberty Elementary. The Waldo, Claridon, and Caledonia elementary buildings have since been demolished for community safety purposes.
