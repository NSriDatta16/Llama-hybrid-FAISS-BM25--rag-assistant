Pierre Bouchet

Seen only in flashback during the film, Pierre Bouchet was a close friend of Connor MacLeod during the French Revolution, Bouchet asked MacLeod to aid the populace during the conflict. Both fought on the revolutionary side, but MacLeod ended up being arrested by the royal troops in a fortress in Vincennes, a suburb of Paris, and sentenced to be executed by the guillotine. In the day of Connor’s execution, Bouchet visited Connor, and told him he had come to take Connor’s place. He had had enough of his life, and wanted peace. When the Highlander refused to let his friend die, Bouchet struck him unconscious, and took his place. Bouchet was beheaded by the guillotine, and no Quickening took place, since Connor was too far away to even receive it.

The Source

Zai Jie: An Immortal archaeologist working with Cardinal Giovanni. He finds ancient writings in Gaza, which lead him to central Europe, where he locates the Source, but awakens the Guardian. 

Cardinal Giovanni: This fifteen-hundred-year-old priest is obsessed with the legend of the Source. He has enlisted a group of Immortals to help him find it. 

Reggie Weller: This three-century-old astronomer is recruited by Cardinal Giovanni to search for the Source. A cheeky Cockney who grew up in the slums of East London, Reggie uses humor and bluster as survival skills.

The Elder: A repulsive figure — his rotting skin  hangs in loose folds like blankets — explains to MacLeod and the others how, millennia ago, he was part of a group of Immortals trying to find the Source, who ultimately turned on each other. They found the Source and fought the Guardian, killing him, and was punished with a fate worse than death — a state of eternal living decay.
