WBXG-LD, virtual and UHF digital channel 33, was a low-power Sonlife-affiliated television station licensed to Gainesville, Florida, United States. The station was owned by L4 Media Group. The station's transmitter was located along SW 8th Avenue in west Gainesville.

History
WBXG-LD began operations on April 13, 1989, as W31AT, broadcasting on UHF channel 31. The station was originally an affiliate of The Box, a broadcast network where viewers could call-in to request (via a code) their favorite music video(s) be played, much like a call-in music radio station. The station later changed its call letters to WBXG-LP, which reflected its association with The Box network and the City of Gainesville.

In May 1999, The Box was acquired by MTV Networks division of Viacom and as a result, WBXG-LP became an affiliate of MTV2 when The Box was merged into that network's operations on January 1, 2001. About a year later, WBXG-LP upgraded to Class A as WBXG-CA and started broadcasting on channel 33.

By the early 2010s, Viacom had gradually sold most of their broadcast affiliates to other parties and in July 2015, WBXG dropped MTV2 and affiliated with Sonlife.
