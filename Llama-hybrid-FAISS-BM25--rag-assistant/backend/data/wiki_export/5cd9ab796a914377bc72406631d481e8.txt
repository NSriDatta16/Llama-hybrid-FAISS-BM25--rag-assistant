Six Flags Hurricane Harbor Oklahoma City (often shortened to Hurricane Harbor OKC) is a water theme park in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma built in 1981. Built by the Herschend Family Entertainment Corporation and originally known as White Water, the water park was picked up by Premier Parks (then known as Tierco) in 1991 and its name was changed to White Water Bay. Both White Water Bay and the nearby theme park Frontier City were sold again in a seven park package by Six Flags on January 11, 2007, for $312 million. White Water Bay is currently owned by EPR Properties and operated by Six Flags Entertainment Corporation. The park was renamed to Six Flags Hurricane Harbor Oklahoma City in 2020.
