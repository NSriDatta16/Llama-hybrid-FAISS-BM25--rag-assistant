Bryman College was a system of for-profit colleges  in the United States. Bryman College became Everest College in April 2007 and returned to the Bryman name after BioHealth Colleges purchased the San Jose, Hayward, San Francisco and Los Angeles-Wilshire locations.

On July 25, 2014, the school ceased operations after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and officially shut down all of its campuses.

The original Bryman Schools were founded in 1960 by Mrs. Esther Bryman as the Los Angeles Colleges of Medical and Dental Assistants. In 1975, The Bryman Schools were acquired by National Education Corporation. In 1983, the school names were changed to National Education Center Bryman Campus.  Corinthian Schools, Inc. acquired the schools in July 1995. In June 1996 the school names were changed to Bryman College.

Controversies

Washington
In April 2005 the college was sued by some of its students at the Tacoma, Washington campus who claimed they did not receive proper training for their careers in medical assistant program, that they were misled about the program’s accreditation status, their eligibility to take a national certification exam, the transferability of their credits and the availability of internships.

Settlement with State of California, 2007
In July 2007, the California Attorney General threatened to file suit against Corinthian Colleges, corporate parent of National Institute of Technology, unless it settled allegations that it has misrepresented its placement statistics; the school had been under investigation by the state attorney general's office for over 18 months.  According to a case filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, Corinthian Colleges "engaged in a persistent pattern of unlawful conduct" by overstating the percentage of those who obtained employment from its courses, inflated information on starting salaries and made misleading or false statements about which programs it was authorized to offer and which were approved by the California Department of Education.  The suit stated that Corinthian's "own records show that a substantial percentage of students do not complete the programs and, of those who complete the program, a large majority do not successfully obtain employment within six months after completing the course."  In late July, Corinthian Colleges agreed to pay $6.5 million to settle a lawsuit alleging that the chain engaged in unlawful business practices by exaggerating its record of placing students in well-paying jobs; the amount included $5.8 million in restitution to students as well as $500,000 in civil damages and $200,000 in court costs.

Financial issues
In July 2014, Bryman shut down its four schools in the San Francisco Bay Area.
