The National Concert Hall (NCH) (An Ceoláras Náisiúnta) is a national cultural institution, sometimes described as "the home of music in Ireland".  It comprises the actual concert hall operation, which in various chambers hosts over 1,000 events each year, as well as Ireland's National Symphony Orchestra and three choirs: the National Symphony Chorus, Cor na nOg and Cor Linn.

Originally built for the Dublin International Exhibition of Arts and Manufactures of 1865, the structure was converted into the central building of University College Dublin (UCD) at the foundation of the National University of Ireland in 1908. When UCD began to relocate to a new campus at Belfield in the 1960s, part of the building was converted, and reopened as the NCH in 1981.

As a national cultural institution, the NCH falls under the aegis of the Irish Government’s Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, as such, is grant-aided by the Irish Government. The NCH is a statutory corporate body, with a management team, and a Government-appointed Board.

History
The history of Earlsfort Terrace, where the National Concert Hall is based, dates back to 1865 when it was originally known as the Exhibition Palace. The Guinness Family purchased the buildings in May 1871, agreeing that ‘popular entertainment’ continue as before for a further ten years. Dublin Musical Society made its debut at the Exhibition Palace in May 1876. On its first visit to Ireland, the Hallé Orchestra gave two concerts at the Exhibition Palace on 26 October 1878. 
The stone structure and glass and steel Winter Garden proved expensive to run and was later dismantled and sold in May 1882. The Royal University of Ireland occupied the premises from 1883 to 1909. Concerts and small exhibitions continued. The Irish Universities Act 1908 brought the establishment of University College Dublin (UCD) and the RUI was dissolved on 31 October 1909.

Several members of staff and students of UCD were involved in Easter Week 1916 Rising, including Professor Eoin MacNeill and student Richard Mulcahy who became Chief of Staff of the Volunteers (Óglaigh na hÉireann). Thomas MacDonagh, one of the signatories to the Proclamation of the Republic, was a lecturer in English at UCD. He was executed in Kilmainham Jail on 3 May 1916.

The building also has significant links to the War of Independence. A Dublin Corporation scholarship brought Kevin Barry, who had joined the Irish Republican Army in 1917, into UCD’s medical school in 1919. 
Following the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in London on 6 December 1921, Dáil Éireann met in UCD’s Council Chamber between 14 December and 10 January 1922. Ratification of the Treaty by Dáil Éireann took place in UCD on 7 January 1922 with 64 deputies in favour and 57 against. Final session of Dáil Éireann in UCD took place on 10 January 1922 when Arthur Griffith was elected president of the Dáil.

In 1960 the Irish Government agreed to build a new campus for UCD at Belfield. In 1974 the Government agreed that the Earlsfort Terrace site would be completely renovated to become the National Concert Hall. Work began in May 1978.
President Patrick Hillary officially opened the National Concert Hall on 9 September 1981 with the RTÉSO and a number soloists and choirs under Colman Pearce. The Chieftains had the honour of giving the first traditional Irish music concert on 11 September 1981, while pianist John O'Conor gave the first 'solo' recital on the 12 September.

The National Symphony Orchestra was founded in 1948 and is one of Ireland's principal classical music groups.

In July 2018, the Government agreed in principle that the RTÉ NSO should come under the remit of the National Concert Hall; this transition was completed in January 2022, as part of this change the NCH also took control of RTÉ Cór na nÓg, RTÉ Vanbrugh Quartet  and RTÉ Philharmonic Choir.

Irish Baroque Orchestra
The Irish Baroque Orchestra performs music from the 17th and 18th centuries; it became an NCH resident in 2013.

Writers Block
Writer’s Block is a series of creative writing rooms at NCH offering artists space to write, experiment and collaborate. It allows NCH to support artists in the creation of new projects and allow them to contribute to NCH’s programming.  As of 2021, Paul Noonan, James Vincent McMorrow, Lisa Hannigan, Ross Turner and Glenn Keating are resident, creating and making new work at NCH. Neil Hannon and Cathy Davey have previously benefitted from this support.

Redevelopment
The redevelopment of the National Concert Hall on Earlsfort Terrace is part of Project Ireland 2040, and is one of the Irish Government's key cultural projects. Plans to develop the site have been in train since the mid-2000s following the purchase of Earlsfort Terrace from UCD for the future redevelopment of the National Concert Hall.  Under Project Ireland 2040, the Government has committed to a major investment in the redevelopment of the NCH with the aim of transforming it into the National Centre for the performance of music.  The redevelopment programme was due to start construction in 2022, involving the building and performance spaces at Earlsfort Terrace.
