In 1951, the United States FBI, under Director J. Edgar Hoover, continued for a second year to maintain a public list of the people it regarded as the Ten Most Wanted Fugitives.

As 1951 began, only three of the original top ten fugitives from the prior year still remained at large. The FBI had also added six additional fugitives to the list during the prior year, and had already caught one of those as well. As a result of the late year captures in 1950, 1951 began with only eight wanted fugitives named on the list. However, as soon as the second week of the new year began, the FBI promptly filled the two open slots with two new fugitives.
