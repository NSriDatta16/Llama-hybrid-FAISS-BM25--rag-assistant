"All This Time Still Falling Out of Love" is a song by English synth-pop duo Erasure. The track appears on the band's eleventh studio album Nightbird and Mute Records released it together with "Here I Go Impossible Again" (also from Nightbird) as a double A-side, the third single release from this album.

The song was written and produced by Erasure members Vince Clarke and Andy Bell. "All This Time Still Falling Out of Love" is a straight up dance music number displaying Clarke's signature syncopated, analogue synth noises and rhythm patterns. The song's original mix, by Tom Elmhirst, appeared as its single version; on Nightbird, it was the one song not to have been mixed by Elmhirst, instead appearing as a harsher dance remix by Vince Clarke and Mark Saunders, who had mixed much of Erasure's early material. In addition, the DVD single contained a live version.

It was performed frequently during Erasure's 2005 world tour to support Nightbird ("The Erasure Show"). The double A-sided single peaked at number twenty-five on the UK singles chart, becoming Erasure's thirty-first UK Top 40 single.
