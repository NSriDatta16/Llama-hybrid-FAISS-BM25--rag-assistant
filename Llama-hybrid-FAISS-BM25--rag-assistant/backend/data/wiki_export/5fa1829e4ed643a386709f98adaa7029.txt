The Ivel Ultra was an 8-bit Croatian Apple II compatible computer designed by Branimir Makanec and developed by Ivasim Electronika in the 1984s.

It was produced in two different versions: the first version has a brown case and ran from 1984 to 1986, the second has a white case and ran from 1987 to 1990.

The machine was equipped with one or two 5.25" floppy disk drives. It came with an Apple I compatible BASIC language. The operating system, called IDOS, is compatible with Apple DOS 3.3.
