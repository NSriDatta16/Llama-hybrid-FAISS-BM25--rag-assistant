Life and career 
Corrigan grew up in the Bronx, New York City. After studying at Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute, he made his film debut in 1989 in Lost Angels, starring Donald Sutherland and Adam Horovitz. He was cast in Goodfellas as the younger brother of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta). During the independent film boom of the 1990s, Corrigan built a career playing quirky, unconventional characters in films such as True Romance, Living in Oblivion, Walking and Talking and Rhythm Thief. He made his television series debut as a cast member of the short-lived Rhea Perlman sitcom Pearl. He also appeared in the video for "Get Me" by the indie band Dinosaur Jr. in 1993.

Corrigan became well known for his role as the slacker Eddie Finnerty on the sitcom Grounded for Life, which ran for five seasons. After the show's cancellation, he returned to appearing in smaller film projects, with the exception of a role in Martin Scorsese's The Departed as the drug-dealing cousin of Leonardo DiCaprio's character. Since that film's success, he has appeared more regularly in high-profile films. He had roles in two Judd Apatow-produced films: Superbad, as the violent owner of the house where Jonah Hill's and Michael Cera's characters attempt to steal alcohol, and Pineapple Express, as one of the main villain's henchmen. He also appeared in Ridley Scott's American Gangster as an informant for Russell Crowe's character. Corrigan was also in the movie The Last Winter, as Motor, a mechanic. In 2009 he was in the Oscar-winning short film The New Tenants and guested on the science fiction drama Fringe as Sam Weiss. He played Sal in the critically praised independent film Big Fan, written and directed by Robert D. Siegel. In 2010, Corrigan starred in the John Landis-produced thriller Some Guy Who Kills People, directed by Jack Perez, and appeared in Tony Scott's Unstoppable. In 2015, he co-starred with Guy Pearce in Results, writer-director Andrew Bujalski's fifth feature film.
