Sharp Peak (Chinese: 蚺蛇尖), or Nam She Tsim, is a hill inside Sai Kung East Country Park, north of Tai Long Wan, in the Sai Kung Peninsula in Hong Kong. It is particularly well known for its well-defined sharp peak, which rises to a height of  above sea level. The hill is reasonably hard for hikers because of its steep rocky terrain and should only be attempted in good weather with correct equipment.
