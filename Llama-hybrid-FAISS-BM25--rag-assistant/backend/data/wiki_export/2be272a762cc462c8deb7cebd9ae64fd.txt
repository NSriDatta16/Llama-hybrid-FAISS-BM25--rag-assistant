Critical reception

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic praised the album, writing "Chicago Wind is not the rough and rowdy honky tonk album some fans have been hankering for, but it is a poetic, thoughtful and empathic one that once more displays why Merle Haggard is the living king of country music."
