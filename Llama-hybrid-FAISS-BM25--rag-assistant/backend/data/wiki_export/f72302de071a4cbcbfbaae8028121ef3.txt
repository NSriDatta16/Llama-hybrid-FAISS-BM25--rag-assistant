KVNU (610 kHz) is a commercial AM radio station licensed to Logan, Utah.  It is owned by the Cache Valley Media Group and airs a talk radio format, serving the Logan metropolitan area.  KVNU first signed on in 1938 and was owned by the family of Herschel Bullen until 1996.  The studios and offices are at 810 West 200 North in Logan.

By day, KVNU is powered at 10,000 watts non-directional.  At night, to protect other stations on 610 AM from interference, it reduces power to 1,000 watts and switches to a directional antenna.  KVNU has a construction permit to boost its daytime power to 22,000 watts.  The AM transmitter is off West 3800 South in Benson, Utah, near the Little Bear River.  Programming is also heard on FM translators at 102.1 MHz in Wellsville, 102.5 MHz in Smithfield, 98.3 in Tremonton, Utah and 93.5 in Laketown, Utah.

History
KVNU signed on the air on November 20, 1938. It was owned by the Cache Valley Broadcasting Company, led by S.L. Billings and other Salt Lake City entrepreneurs. Shortly afterwards, Herschel Bullen and his son Reed became stockholders of KVNU's parent company.  The station originally broadcast at 1200 kHz at 250 watts, a fraction of its current output.  The studios were at 41 South Main Street.  With the enactment of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA) in 1941, the frequency moved to 1230 AM.

By 1945, the Bullens had become majority owners of the Cache Valley Broadcasting Company, with Herschel leading the company and Reed moving up from station general manager to company general manager to company director.  Reed hosted Man on the Street, a daily 12:15 p.m. live broadcast from a local jewelry business soliciting opinions from members of the public.

In the 1950s, KVNU moved its frequency to 610 AM and boosted its power to 5,000 watts, expanding its coverage area around Northern Utah and parts of Wyoming and Idaho.  In 1958, the Bullen Family was granted a construction permit from the Federal Communications Commission to put a television station on Channel 12 in Logan.  The permit was later transferred to the University of Utah to put a public television station on Channel 12.  

Through the 1960s and 1970s, KVNU was a Top 40 station and an affiliate of the ABC Contemporary Network.  In the 1970s, the daytime power was doubled to 10,000 watts.  

In 1986, Reed Bullen retired as KVNU director and transferred the station to his son Jonathan. Then in 1996, the Bullen family sold KVNU to the Cache Valley Media Group.
