The Best of Exodus: Lessons in Violence is a compilation album by thrash metal band Exodus. Even though this compilation album was released after Impact Is Imminent, it contains no tracks from that album as Exodus had switched record labels by that time. Therefore, the band had no involvement with this album.

In addition to tracks from the first three Exodus studio albums, this collection includes the AC/DC cover "Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap", which was recorded live on July 14, 1989 at the Fillmore in San Francisco, California, and can be found on their 1991 live album Good Friendly Violent Fun. "And Then There Were None" was recorded live at the Astoria in London, England on March 8, 1989; this version can be found on the CD reissue of Bonded by Blood from 1989.
