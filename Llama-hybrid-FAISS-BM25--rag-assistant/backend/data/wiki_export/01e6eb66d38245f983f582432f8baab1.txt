Humphrey joined the staff of the National Institute for Medical Research in 1949, working in the Division of Biological Standards. With James Lightbown he established international standards for antibiotics and enzymes, and later developed a long-standing association with the WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standards.

Humphrey was the son of Mary Elizabeth (née Horniblow) and H. A. Humphrey, the engineer who invented the Humphrey pump. His paternal aunt was Edith Humphrey, the first British woman to earn a PhD in chemistry and to identify a chiral.

At Cambridge University he met his wife Janet, the daughter of Nobel Prize–winning physiologist Archibald Hill and social reformer Margaret Hill.  They had five children, including Nicholas Humphrey, and brought up Humphrey's nephew and niece after the death of Humphrey's brother.
