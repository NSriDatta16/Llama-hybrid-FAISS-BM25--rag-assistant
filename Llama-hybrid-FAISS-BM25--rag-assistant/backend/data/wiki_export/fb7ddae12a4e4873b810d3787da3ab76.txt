Death
Moran died in Rockland on July 12, 1967, leaving a widow, Mrs. Irene Gusbee Moran; a son, Paul W. Moran; and two grandchildren. His funeral service was at Rockland Congregational Church, and he was interred in Achorn Cemetery in Rockland.

Upon Moran's death, U. S. Senator Edmund Muskie made this statement in the Congressional Record:

"...What I admired most about Carl Moran was his courage in being an active Democrat in Maine at a time when the party could hope for few victories at the polls. His successes in the public interest were highly significant in the development of Maine as a two-party State. Maine people of every political persuasion have benefited from the revival of political competition, which he helped ignite. His achievements as a Democrat in a Republican State suggest a man of deep conviction and great energy and optimism. That was Carl Moran. All who knew him or worked with him appreciated his drive. His spirit was contagious. We all took courage from his example and we benefited from his wisdom and experience.The Nation lost an outstanding citizen, and Maine a favorite son with the passing of Carl Moran."
