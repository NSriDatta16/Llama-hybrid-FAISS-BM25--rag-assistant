The Southern Maryland Blue Crabs are an American professional baseball team based in Waldorf, Maryland. They are members of the South Division of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, an independent "partner league" of Major League Baseball. Since 2008, the Blue Crabs have played their home games at Regency Furniture Stadium. They represent the counties of Charles, Calvert, and St. Mary's, which are located on the Southern Maryland peninsula between Chesapeake Bay and the Potomac River.

In 2006, Southern Maryland residents chose the name "Blue Crabs" in a team-sponsored fan ballot. The name refers to the indigenous blue crab, the official state crustacean of Maryland. The Blue Crabs' fanbase has been nicknamed the "Crustacean Nation", an allusion to the Cardinal Nation and the Red Sox Nation fan clubs of the St. Louis Cardinals and Boston Red Sox.

History 

Charles County initiated efforts to bring affiliated professional baseball, in the form of a relocated Class A Kinston Indians team, to the Southern Maryland region in 1985, but those plans fell through. The progress made on the ballpark was reversed after Charles County commissioners voted against its financial support, instead deciding to funnel money to infrastructure projects. There were also concerns about marketability of the baseball team in a then-largely rural area. However, Southern Maryland's population boomed soon after as the suburban expansion of Washington, D.C. encompassed the region.

In 2004, the town of Hughesville was targeted by Opening Day Partners to be the home of its Southern Maryland franchise, but the town's residents voted against the measure to retain the area's rural nature. After Hughesville residents denied the ballpark, all focus was shifted to Waldorf, a bedroom community of Washington, D.C. The Atlantic League formally announced an expansion team for Southern Maryland on February 15, 2006. The Blue Crabs were originally supposed to be an expansion team for the 2007 season, but the construction bids for Regency Furniture Stadium came in over budget. Instead, the Blue Crabs' inaugural season was pushed back to 2008. The team name was chosen in a name-the-team contest in Southern Maryland with six finalists to choose from: Blue Crabs, Blue Herons, Aviators, Rock Fish, Ospreys, and Eagles. Fans were able to vote online, through the mail, or at participating Southern Maryland-area Arby's Restaurants.

Initially, there was some concern about how the Blue Crabs would impact the attendance of the nearby Double-A Bowie Baysox, a Baltimore Orioles affiliate that plays approximately  away. The Baysox anticipated a small attendance drop initially, but did not worry about the issue in the long term.

The Blue Crabs were owned by Opening Day Partners and Brooks Robinson, a former third baseman with the Baltimore Orioles from 1955 to 1977. Robinson was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1983. In November 2016, the team was sold to a new ownership group, Crabs On Deck, LLC, headed by Frank Boulton, the founder and CEO of the Atlantic League and owner of the Long Island Ducks and Bridgeport Bluefish.

The Blue Crabs were the runner-up in the 2009 Atlantic League Championship Series versus the Somerset Patriots. They again finished runner-up in the 2015 Atlantic League Championship Series versus Somerset.

On July 13, 2019, Blue Crabs outfielder Tony Thomas became the first player in professional baseball history to steal first base. Atlantic League/MLB rule changes introduced in 2019 allow batters to steal first base on any pitch not caught in flight.

On October 19, 2023, with the announcement of the 2024 season schedule it was announced that the Blue Crabs would now be members of the South Division with the expansion Hagerstown Flying Boxcars joining the North Division.

Season-by-season records

The Blue Crabs tied for first place in the Liberty Division for the second half of 2009.  They also won a first-round playoff series against the Long Island Ducks, 3â€“2, on September 29, 2009. However, they lost the championship to the Somerset Patriots.

Philanthropy

The Blue Crabs hold a series of charity events that benefit such organizations as the Southern Maryland Food Bank, The Salvation Army, Juvenile Diabetes Research Fund, Soldier's Angels, Orioles Advocates, and the American Red Cross. Other events such as the Red Cross blood drive and Prostate Cancer Awareness Night are held at Regency Furniture Stadium to promote health and wellness. On the team's final game of the 2008 season, the Blue Crabs raised $8,139 for the College of Southern Maryland as part of the institution's 50th anniversary. Prior to the 2009 season, the team partnered with the Charles County Hospice House to allow the non-profit charity to take advantage of theme nights for fundraising opportunities.

Mascot

The Southern Maryland Blue Crabs' official mascot is an anthropomorphic, blue creature named Pinch. He wears a Blue Crabs home jersey with red and white sneakers. The mascot debuted on April 19, 2008, at the Charles County Youth League's opening day parade held at Laurel Springs Park in La Plata. Pinch's name alludes to the pincer of a crab. He resides at Crabby Cove, an artificial pond designed for recreational use at Regency Furniture Stadium.
