Deer Valley Unified School District #97 (DVUSD) is a Pre-K–12 school district, headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, United States. DVUSD is the fifth largest school district in the state of Arizona, serving areas of Phoenix, Glendale, Peoria, Anthem, New River and numerous unincorporated areas of northwest Maricopa County. Situated within the Sonoran Desert, the District has grown from its modest beginnings as a county accommodation school located in New River in 1934 to 37 campuses serving 36,261 students: 15 K–6 elementary schools, 13 K–8 schools, three middle schools, and five comprehensive high schools, plus an online school and an alternative school. Early childhood education opportunities are offered through DVUSD Community Education Preschool/PreKindergarten (15 sites), and Head Start (five sites). Twelve schools receive Title I funding. District facilities include District Office, Support Services Center, Transportation and Administrative Services.

Attendance area
 the Cañon Elementary School District sends high school students and junior high level special education students to DVUSD. In 1984, 27 students from Cañon attended DVUSD. That year Deer Valley sued Cañon, which stated it was unable to pay for the tuition costs of the district and acknowledged that it was billed for the correct amount. The Arizona Republic described this as a "friendly lawsuit", since according to the DVUSD officials, Cañon district officials stated that the lawsuit was the only mechanism through which it could pay DVUSD.
