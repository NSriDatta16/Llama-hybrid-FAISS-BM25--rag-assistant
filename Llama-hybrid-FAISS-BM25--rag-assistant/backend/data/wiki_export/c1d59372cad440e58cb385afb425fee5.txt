This is a list of characters in the game of Cluedo (UK) / Clue (US).

The Victim 
The victim of Cluedo/Clue is Dr. Black (UK) / Mr. Boddy (US), the wealthy owner of Tudor Mansion (formerly known as Tudor Close/Tudor Hall (UK) and Boddy Mansion/Boddy Manor(US)). In Cluedo, he is the unseen host who is murdered, which inspires the quest to discover who murdered him, with what weapon, and what room in his mansion the crime occurred. Dr. Black was listed in the original patent filing as one of the ten characters created for the game, in which one character was drawn from the suspect cards to be the new victim before the start of a game. Mr. Boddy's name is a pun on the fact that the character is a dead body.

In the 2002 US edition, Mr. John Boddy, also known as Dr. Black, is an eminent anthropologist and the heir of his late uncle's estate, which he is set to fully inherit on the day of his thirtieth birthday. Before then, Boddy discovered a series of secret allowances bequeathed to some of his uncle's former associates. Vowing to get to the bottom of these murky financial dealings, he invites his uncle's associates to Tudor Mansion for a weekend visit. However, Mr. Boddy is murdered by one of them.

In the 2023 edition of the game, the two names are combined into the character, Boden "Boddy" Black Jr, a man who acquired his significant wealth by inheritance. At the time of his murder in the game's updated story, he has used connections to government officials in Hue County, the game's setting, to push through permitting and construction on Boden Black Hotel, a luxury hotel which the public opposes.

In the film, Mr. Boddy is primarily portrayed by Lee Ving while Tim Curry portrays him in one of the film's three endings. He blackmailed the six guests of Hill House and his butler Wadsworth's wife until he is murdered. In Ending A, he was murdered by his maid Yvette on Miss Scarlet's orders. In Ending B, he was murdered by Mrs. Peacock. In Ending C, Boddy is seemingly murdered by Professor Plum, but Wadsworth reveals himself as the real Mr. Boddy while the person Plum killed was his butler. Boddy plans to continue blackmailing the guests before he is shot by Mr. Green.

Suspects
The following are the known suspects in the Cluedo / Clue franchise:

Original suspects

These are the original suspects from the board game in rolling order:

Miss Scarlett
Miss Scarlett is a stereotypical femme fatale, typically portrayed as young, cunning, and attractive. Known as "Miss Scarlet" in North America between 1963 and 2016, she rolls first in the game.

In Clue Master Detective, Miss Scarlet is depicted as an Asian woman nicknamed the "Mercenary of Macau".

In the film, she is portrayed by Lesley Ann Warren and is depicted as a sassy Washington DC madame who runs an underground brothel. In Ending A, she orders her former call girl and Mr. Boddy's maid, Yvette, to murder her employer and the cook before murdering her in turn, along with a cop she was bribing and a passing motorist and singing telegram girl. Nonetheless, Scarlet is eventually exposed, subdued, and arrested. In Ending C, she only murders the cop before being exposed and arrested.

In the 1990s ITV game show Cluedo, Vivienne Scarlet is the stepdaughter of Mrs. Peacock.

In the 1996 musical, Miss Scarlet used to work as a lounge singer in Las Vegas.

In the 2023 edition, she is a Black British gossip columnist who writes under the pen name "Cyan".

Colonel Mustard
Colonel Mustard is a stock military officer who rolls second. He is usually portrayed as a dignified, dapper, and dangerous military man. Originally known as Colonel Yellow, his name was changed before the game's first edition was published.

In Clue Master Detective, his full name is Algernon Mustard and is known to sleep with a revolver under his pillow.

In the film, he is portrayed by Martin Mull and is depicted as a war profiteer who sold stolen air force radios on the black market and was later involved in a top-secret fusion bomb project. In Ending C, he kills a passing motorist after recognizing him as his driver from World War II before he is exposed and arrested.

In the 1990s ITV game show Cluedo, Colonel Mike Mustard is a ex-officer of the Special Air Service and a regular visitor of Arlington Grange who is in a love triangle with Mrs. Peacock and her step-daughter Miss Scarlett.

In the 2002 US edition, he is Michael Mustard, a former officer of the Royal Hampshire Regiment, where he first met Sir Hugh. He is very nostalgic for his war days and has convinced a publisher that his military exploits would make for a good book.

In the 2016 edition, Colonel Mustard is a successful and popular officer. However, behind his medals of honor, are rumors of treason and war profiteering which he has paying someone to hide for far too long. Believing Mr. Boddy is blackmailing him, Mustard eagerly comes to Tudor Mansion in search of evidence.

Mrs. White / Chef White
Mrs. White is usually portrayed as a frazzled servant who worked as Mr. Boddy's cook and housekeeper. Originally known as Nurse White before her name was changed following the first edition's publication, she rolls third in the game. Various variations have been made to the character, diverging from her working class origins.

In Clue Master Detective, she is Blanche White, who has been a long-time maid to Mr. Boddy and has an eye squint from spying in keyholes.

In the film, she is portrayed by Madeline Kahn and is depicted as the widow of a nuclear physicist, an illusionist, and three other men, all of whom died under mysterious circumstances. In Ending C, she kills Yvette out of jealousy upon discovering she had an affair with one of her previous husbands before being exposed and arrested.

In the 1990s ITV game show Cluedo, housekeeper and cook Mrs. Blanche White has worked for Mrs. Peacock at Arlington Grange for the past 25 years. Additionally, series one featured her husband Mr. White before the character was dropped.

In the 1998 musical, Mrs. White is the chief domestic at Boddy Manor.

In the 2002 edition, Mrs. Blanche White is the housekeeper and cook of Tudor Mansion. She also served as the nanny of her current employer, Mr. John Boddy, during his childhood. For all her years of dedicated service, she has little to show for it.

In Clue: Discover the Secrets, Diana White is a former child celebrity who desires to be in the spotlight again.

In the 2012 edition, White is an alias given to Alexis Villenueve, a lawyer who will do anything for justice, including turning vigilante.

Although originally planned to be in the 2016 edition, Mrs. White was replaced as a suspect by a new character, Dr. Orchid.

In the 2023 edition of the game, the character returned as Chef White, a younger character with short white hair and a white chef's uniform coat. She worked for Boddy Black at one point before starting her own restaurant, using the budget money she skimmed from her old boss to fund it.

Reverend Green / Mr. Green / Mayor Green
Originally patented as "The Reverend Mr Green", he is a hypocritical Anglican priest who wavers when the subject is murder. In North America, Mr. Green has taken money-oriented roles from mobster to businessman. Parker Brothers insisted on the name change, believing that the American public would object to a parson as a murder suspect. He rolls fourth in both versions.

In Clue Master Detective, he is a mobster named Thallo Green.

In the film, Mr. Green is portrayed by Michael McKean. For most of the film and Endings A and B, he is depicted as a closeted homosexual who is concerned that his secret might cost him his job as a State Department employee. In Ending C, he is a heterosexual, undercover FBI agent working to expose Mr. Boddy.

In the 1990s ITV game show Cluedo, Jonathan Green is a regular visitor at Arlington Grange.

In the 1996 musical, Mr. Green is an entrepreneur.

The 2002 edition attempted to combine the two variations of the character. Mr. John Green, also known as "Reverend Green", has a reputation for fraud, money laundering, and smuggling.

In the film, she is portrayed by Eileen Brennan and is depicted as the wife of a U.S. Senator who is accused of taking bribes. In the film's second ending, or Ending B, she kills Mr. Boddy, Yvette, her former cook Mrs. Ho, who became Mr. Boddy's cook, as well as a passing motorist, cop, and singing telegram girl to prevent her secrets from being exposed as she was taking bribes from foreign powers. While the others discover her crimes, Mrs. Peacock attempts to escape, only to be arrested on her way out. In Ending C, she only kills the cook before she is exposed and arrested.

In the 1990s ITV game show Cluedo, Elizabeth Peacock is the stepmother of Vivienne Scarlet who resides in Arlington Grange.

Professor Plum
Professor Plum is the stock absent-minded professor character, who rolls last in the game.

In Clue Master Detective, his full name is Edgar Plum and is depicted as a shady archaeologist and the head of the local school's archaeology department.

In the film, he is portrayed by Christopher Lloyd and depicted as a disgraced former psychiatrist of the World Health Organization who lost his medical license for having an affair with one of his patients and became an employee at the United Nations. In Ending C, he seemingly kills Mr. Boddy, only to later learn it was actually Boddy's butler, before being exposed and arrested.

In the 1990s ITV game show Cluedo, Professor Peter Plum is a regular visitor at Arlington Grange.

In the 1996 musical, Professor Plum disguises himself as the orchestra's piano player while an imposter masquerades as a "dorky school teacher" and has three random audience members serve as accomplices in choosing the culprit, location, and murder weapon.

In the 2002 edition, Professor Peter Plum is an archaeologist and Egyptologist who formerly worked as the curator of the British Museum before he was fired due to allegations of plagiarizing his article on the dynasties of ancient Egypt from a deceased colleague.

Additional suspects
Parker Bros. released the Clue VCR Mystery Game in 1985, introducing four new characters to the lineup, the first change in Cluedo characters in 36 years. The new characters also appeared in a number of spin-off games and licensed products, such as Clue Master Detective (1988).

Sergeant / Inspector Gray
Sergeant Gray is a corrupt police officer. The name "Grey" was one of ten characters filed with the game's original patent. "Miss Grey" and "Mrs. Silver" are some of the oldest colour names previously unused, and "Gray" is one of the most enduring names in later editions, albeit with different characters depending on the edition.

In the VCR Game, Sergeant Gray is a crazed mental patient who escaped from the nearby asylum and evaded discovery by posing as a police officer.

In Clue Master Detective, Sergeant Gray is a no-nonsense, corrupt, unimaginative, and colorblind police officer who stumbles onto the crime scene while collecting funds for the Police Blackmail Awareness Fund.

Renamed Inspector Gray in the mobile game, he secretly worked with Dr. Black to drop tax evasion charges in exchange for a cut.

In Waddingtons' Cluedo Super Sleuth, Inspector Gray appears as a police inspector.

The UK edition of Cluedo Jr. introduced the first animal players or suspects: Samantha Scarlett, Mustard the Dog, Wendy White, George Green, Polly Peacock, and Peter Plum.

Cluedo Junior Detective introduced Inspector Cluedo and his bloodhound Watson, who invites his eight nieces and nephews: Jake Plum, Natalie Peacock, Jessica Scarlett, Spike Mustard, Robbie Green, Megan White, and Beth Peach; as well as investigator Tom Black.

Film
In 1985, Cluedo / Clue began expanding its character roster and served as the premise for a film of the same name:

 The Butler - Rarely used, the butler is usually the character most connected with the audience. He has appeared anonymously and as Wadsworth, Didit, Ashe, and Hogarth in related official media. In the film, Wadsworth is primarily portrayed by Tim Curry while Lee Ving portrays him in one of the film's three endings. In two of the endings, Endings A and B, he is revealed to be an undercover FBI agent. In Ending C, Wadsworth is revealed to be the true Mr. Boddy while the "Mr. Boddy" Professor Plum killed earlier was the real butler.
 The Inspector - Typically working for Scotland Yard, the inspector appears anonymously or as Pry, Brown, or Gray in related official media. In the film, the Chief of Police is portrayed by an uncredited Howard Hesseman and first appears disguised as an evangelist. In all three endings, he leads the police in raiding Hill House and arresting the murderer or murderers depending on the ending.
 Yvette - A young French maid at Hill House, portrayed by Colleen Camp. She is murdered in the billiard room with the rope by Miss Scarlett (Ending A), Mrs. Peacock (Ending B), or Mrs. White (Ending C), though she is considered a suspect beforehand. In Ending A, Wadsworth reveals Yvette was ordered by Miss Scarlett to murder Mr. Boddy and Mrs. Ho as the maid worked for Scarlett as a call girl. She also had Colonel Mustard as a client and an affair with Mrs. White's husband.
 Mrs. Ho - The cook at Hill House, portrayed by Kellye Nakahara. She is murdered in the kitchen with the dagger by Yvette on Miss Scarlett's orders (Ending A) or her former employer Mrs. Peacock (Endings B and C) early in the film.
 The Motorist - A middle-aged man who is later revealed to be Colonel Mustard's driver during World War II, portrayed by Jeffrey Kramer. He comes to Hill House after his car breaks down and is murdered in the lounge with the wrench by Miss Scarlett (Ending A), Mrs. Peacock (Ending B), or Colonel Mustard (Ending C).
 The Cop - An unnamed police officer, portrayed by Bill Henderson. He seemingly arrived at the mansion to investigate the motorist's abandoned car and make a phone call, but he is later revealed to have been invited. He is murdered in the library with the lead pipe by Miss Scarlett, whom he had been taking bribes from (Endings A and C), or Mrs. Peacock (Ending B).
 The Singing Telegram Girl - An unnamed singing telegram girl as well as a former patient of Professor Plum's, with whom he had an affair, portrayed by Jane Wiedlin. She arrives at Hill House to deliver a message, only to be shot with the revolver by Miss Scarlett (Ending A), Mrs. Peacock (Ending B), or Mr. Boddy (Ending C).

Television
In 1990, Cluedo inspired several television series which (in addition to the standard six characters) created additional characters – primarily victims. The most notable recurring character in the UK series was Mr. White while the Australian series introduced Det. Sgt. Stanley Bogong (who also appeared in French, German and Swedish versions).

Books
Clue Jr., a "Let's Read and Play" book written by Sara Miller and illustrated by Jim Talbot released in 2004, introduced five new suspects: a butler, a cook, a gardener, a maid, and a repairman.

Characters in other media
In the first half of 1985, Mobil joined Cluedo to introduce three new characters as part of its "Mobil £5 Million Cluedo Mystery" contest game: Sir Peach, Lady Oakwood, and Dr. Prussian. The characters were added along with three additional murder weapons to balance the game's playing elements. Of the three, only the name "Peach" would be re-used for other characters.

Clue Chronicles: Fatal Illusion, Hasbro's short-lived interactive video game series set in 1938, added five characters to the usual six: Ian Masque, an eccentric millionaire who invites the original suspects and new characters to his isolated Swiss mountain estate for a mysterious dinner party; Marina Popov, an attractive, blonde Russian psychic; Martin Urfe, a mediocre magician hired by Masque to entertain his guests who may be a fraud; Sabata, a deranged Spanish artist; and Dr. Julia Kell, an aging German psychoanalyst who may have Nazi ties.
