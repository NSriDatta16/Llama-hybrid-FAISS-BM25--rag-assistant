Wellington (Native name: Jakkatalla (Badaga)) is a town in the Nilgiris District of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, three kilometres to the north of Coonoor on the NH181. The town includes a Wellington Bazaar, and the Wellington Cantonment. The Wellington Cantonment is home to The Madras Regimental Centre (MRC) and  The Defence Services Staff College (DSSC). The Nilgiri passenger train passes through Wellington, which also has a railway station.

The settlement of Wellington lies immediately outside of Wellington Cantonment, which was earlier known as Jakkatalla (or Jacketallah) from the Badaga Village of that name to the north of it. In 1852, Sir Richard Armstrong, the then Commander-in-Chief, recommended that the name should be changed to Wellington in honour of the Iron Duke, who had previously evinced an interest in the establishment of a sanatorium in the Nilgiris. In 1860, Sir, Charles Trevelyan held that this interesting Military Establishment could not be connected with a more appropriate name than Wellington. He, therefore, ordered that Jakkatalla Station be called henceforth Wellington.

The construction of the barracks began in 1852 and was completed in 1860, popularly known as Wellington Barracks. It assumed importance in the Station, and since February 1942 is occupied by the Madras Regimental Centre. The Wellington Barracks is now named as Srinagesh Barracks in memory of the First Indian Colonel of the Madras Regiment Gen. S.M.Srinagesh.

The native Bazaar, now known as the Cantonment Market, is away from the Barracks and is on the other side of the stream after crossing the Waterloo Bridge (commonly known as Black Bridge, a tarred wooden construction, reconstructed in March 2009, and renamed as Manekshaw Bridge in memory of Field Marshal SHFJ Manekshaw) onto NH 181.

Weather
The one word that best describes the weather in Coonoor/Wellington is salubrious, a term made famous by the Defence Services Staff College! The climate is moderate and gains the advantage of latitude in winter and altitude in summer. The weather is neither tropical (given the latitude) nor humid (despite the lush greenery), but generally pleasant throughout the year. The temperature in summer (the dry months of Apr-May) swings between 27 °C by day, and can be a nippy 14 °C at night in the valley bowls; the slopes record around 17–18 °C at night/early mornings. Winter temperature goes down to about 18 °C in the day and a nippy 11 °C by night; valley bowls record a sub-zero temperature during Dec-Jan, with hoar frost before sunrise.

The atmosphere is clear in comparison to most cities; consequently, the UV index is high throughout the year, and the direct sun can scorch even when the temperature is not so high.

The rainy season is technically during the receding monsoon in Oct-Nov, but the district sees spillover rain (the location is not exactly leeward for the monsoon current hitting Kerala) during the south-west monsoon as well. Humidity ranges between 70% and 90% with a gentle breeze blowing at most times during the rainy season. During the dry spells, it can dip to 40%. It is never stuffy.

Mid-May to mid-July is a season for thunderstorms, most of which originate in the mouth of the valley leading up from Mettupalayam to Coonoor. Thunder can be scaringly loud; those that have not experienced such thunder must enjoy nature in its wild entirety! The faint-of-heart are advised to get under a mattress during such occurrences. The normal time of occurrence of thunderstorms is during early noon to early evening, or late afternoon to early night. An odd occurrence is also recorded around midnight.

Eighth Market
Traditionally, the second Sunday of the month was organised as a local market, outside the gates of Cordite Factory, located at Aruvankadu/Aravangadu, on the main Coonoor-Ooty road (NH 181). The local story around the choice of date is to do with the availability of salary in cash, and the second Sunday being best suited to make all necessary purchases for the month. With the choking of traffic becoming a nuisance, the local market has shifted to the Wellington Stadium, below the Railway Station, and next to the Cantonment Board Office. Sellers reach as early as 5 am, to choose the spot of their choice. The market sells cotton products from Tiruppur and Palladam, hosiery, woollens, inner-ware and socks, shoes, kitchen-ware, fresh garden produce, greens and fruit, and some enterprising ones set up breakfast stalls for fresh dosai, idli, pongal or upma.
