Someone to Love is a 1987 comedy film directed by Henry Jaglom. It was Orson Welles' final live action film appearance, released two years after his death but produced before his voice-over in The Transformers: The Movie, his final film performance.

The film was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1987 Cannes Film Festival.

Plot
The film is a pseudo-documentary about a filmmaker who throws a Valentine's Day party at an old theater that is about to be demolished.
