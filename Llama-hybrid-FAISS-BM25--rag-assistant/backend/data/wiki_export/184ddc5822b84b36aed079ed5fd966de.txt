Pickering Public Library is the library system of Pickering, Ontario, Canada. The library was operational in separate branches since 1841, but officially launched as the Main Library in 1990 at the Central Branch. There are also the George Ashe (formerly Petticoat) and Claremont branches which remain part of the Pickering Public Library.

History 
The Pickering Public Library officially opened its doors on May 22, 1990, which is the Central Branch, after two years of construction in response to the Town of Pickering's growing needs. Prior to opening, there were various library branches including Greenwood, Claremont, Whitevale, Bay Ridges, Rouge Hill, Brougham, which was the first branch opened in 1841, and the formerly named Liverpool Branch until the official opening of the Central Branch. The former three branches remain open to this day. The Petticoat Creek Library branch opened their doors on June 14, 2001 and was officially renamed to the George Ashe Library on September 15, 2017.

In 2020, the library estimates to have 515,000 visitors, upwards of 60 permanent employees, almost 1 million items available to borrow, and almost 1.7 million uses of the public computers annually.

Future 
There is a proposed Library Expansion for the Central Branch, due to increased usage and need. The expansion, dubbed the "City Centre Library", is projected to cost $21 million, while offering additional services such as financial learning assistance. The expansion would result in the Central Branch Library being attached to the Pickering Town Centre. Further, more items are planned to be available for loans, such as additional GoPro cameras and musical instruments.
