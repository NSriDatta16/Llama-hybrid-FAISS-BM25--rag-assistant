History

Magma–Winkelman line
The Magma–Winkelman line was constructed by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (ATSF) subsidiary Phoenix and Eastern Railroad between 1902 - 1904. The Phoenix and Eastern Railroad built the railroad from Phoenix –Winkelman via Florence. It originally proposed to build to a connection with the Southern Pacific Railroad (SP) at Benson but the line was never built past Winkelman.

 December 10, 1904 - the railroad was leased to Santa Fe upon completion of construction and was operated by ATSF subsidiary Santa Fe, Prescott and Phoenix Railway.
 March 13, 1907 - the Phoenix & Eastern became an operating subsidiary of SP.
 March 10, 1910 - the Phoenix & Eastern was leased and became a non-operating subsidiary of SP and operated by the Arizona Eastern Railroad.
 1911 - the track at Winkelman was extended  to Christmas, Arizona by the Arizona Eastern Railway.
 October 31, 1945 - the railroad was sold to the Arizona Eastern Railroad.
 September 30, 1955 - the Arizona Eastern Railroad was merged into SP.
 1961 - the track from Winkelman to Christmas, Arizona was abandoned by SP.

 At some point SP sold the line to mine operator Kennecott Copper.
 August 15, 1986 - the line was sold by Kennecott Copper and the CBRY was started.
 1986–2005 - the CBRY was owned by Rail Management Corporation.
 2006 (summer) - ASARCO Copper Corporation purchased the entire railroad. ASARCO also owns the Ray Mine and Hayden Smelter, CBRY's primary customers.

This railway served as the backdrop to Dwight Yoakam’s “A Thousand Miles from Nowhere” music video. He is seen near the tracks and moving about a train throughout the video.
