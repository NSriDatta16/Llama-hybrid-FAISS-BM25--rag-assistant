The school crest

The "chakra" or wheel on the left-hand corner is found in the center of India's Tri-colour and stands for progress. The symbol on the right is the logo of the Society of Jesus - which gives the universal trait of the Jesuits - being all things to all people. The symbol in the bottom left corner is a ladle from Tata Steel's blast furnace in Jamshedpur and signifies that the school is located in India's Steel City. The symbol in the right-hand corner of two wolves drinking out of a cauldron is taken from the coat of arms to be found in the Castle of Loyola, Spain, the birthplace of Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the Jesuit Society. The Latin motto "In Caritat et Justitia" appearing on the ribbon underlining the base of the crest translates to "In charity and justice". The universal motto of the Society of Jesus is "Ad Majorem dei Glorium" meaning "For the greater glory of God".

An original hand-drawn logo of The Loyolean still remains in the Loyola Press Club room. It is believed to have been drawn by Father Cassel himself.
