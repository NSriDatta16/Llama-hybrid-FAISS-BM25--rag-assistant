Hats Off is a 2001 compilation album by Roy Harper featuring 14 of Harper's own songs "...accompanied by some of rock's most legendary performers." (From rear album cover).

History

The album spans 28 years of Harper's recorded output and features a number of guest musicians, including Jimmy Page, David Bedford, Keith Moon, Ronnie Lane, David Gilmour and Kate Bush.

The album's title refers to the tributary song "Hats Off to (Roy) Harper" by Led Zeppelin from their third album, Led Zeppelin III. Five of the songs were edited from their original length in order to fit them onto a single CD.
