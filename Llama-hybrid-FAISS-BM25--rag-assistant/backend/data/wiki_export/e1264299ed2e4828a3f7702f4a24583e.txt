Amund Martin Sjøbrend (born 1 December 1952) is a former ice speed skater from Norway.

Together with Sten Stensen, Kay Stenshjemmet, and Jan Egil Storholt, Amund Sjøbrend was one of the legendary four S-es (which sounds like "four aces" in Norwegian), four Norwegian top skaters in the 1970s and early 1980s. His first international success came in 1974, when he won silver at the European Allround Championships. Sjøbrend participated at the 1976 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, but had no success there. In 1977, he won bronze at the European Allround Championships.

Sjøbrend was more or less in the shadow of the other three of the four S-es until he had his best year in 1981. That year, he became both European Allround Champion and World Allround Champion. For his accomplishments, he received the Oscar Mathisen Award that same year.
