Borneo Exotics

Borneo Exotics was established by Cantley and Diana Williams in 1997. As of 2009, the nursery stocked more than 130 Nepenthes taxa, totalling over 180,000 plants annually. In Pitcher Plants of the Old World, Stewart McPherson described it as "the world's foremost specialist producer of Nepenthes species".

As of 2011, Borneo Exotics operated a number of growing facilities spread over two locations: lowland species were kept at a nursery in Moragahahena and highlanders in Lindula. The company won a Gold Medal at the Chelsea Flower Show in 2006, 2007, 2010, and 2011, and a Silver Gilt Medal in 2005. Borneo Exotics also won a silver medal and two other awards at the World Orchid Exhibition in 2011.
