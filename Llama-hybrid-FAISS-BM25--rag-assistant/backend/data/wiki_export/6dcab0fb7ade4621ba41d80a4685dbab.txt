Mount Augusta, also designated Boundary Peak 183, is a high peak in the state of Alaska.

Mount Augusta lies about  south of Mount Logan and 25 km east of Mount Saint Elias, respectively the first and second highest mountains in Canada. It forms the eastern end of the long ridge of which Mount Saint Elias is the center and highest point.

The Seward Glacier starts to the north of the peak, separating it from Mount Logan, and then flows around the east side of the peak, forming the gap between Augusta and the peaks surrounding Mount Cook. It then continues south to join the Malaspina Glacier.

Name origin
Mount Augusta was named in 1891 by I.C. Russell of the USGS, for his wife J. Augusta Olmsted Russell.

Notable Features
In terms of pure elevation, Mount Augusta is not particularly notable, being one of the lowest fourteeners in the United States; it is therefore quite overshadowed by its huge neighbors Saint Elias and Logan. However, it is a huge peak in terms of local relief, since it lies so close to low terrain (and in fact close to tidewater). For example, it drops 10,000 feet (3,050m) to the Seward Glacier on the southeast side of the peak in approximately 3.5 miles (5.6 km).
