The Silver Lining is Soul Asylum's 9th studio album. It was released on July 11, 2006, eight years after Candy from a Stranger.

It is the last studio album with original bassist Karl Mueller, who died of cancer on June 17, 2005. Mueller was able to play on most of the tracks, while the band brought in Tommy Stinson for the remaining ones.

The single "Stand Up And Be Strong" was chosen by ABC and ESPN for their college football coverage for the 2006–2007 season.

Fellow Minneapolis musician Prince recorded a cover of "Stand Up And Be Strong" in 2010, and it was eventually released in his 2021 posthumous record Welcome 2 America.
