The Ghanche District () is a district of Pakistan-administered Gilgit-Baltistan in the disputed Kashmir region. It is the eastern-most district of Gilgit-Baltistan. It is the coldest place within Pakistan as it is situated to the "third pole", with temperatures reaching below -20 °C in the winter. The Khaplu Valley and the Hushe Valley form the gateway for the great Baltoro Muztagh, the subrange of the Karakoram Mountains that includes the mighty peaks of K2 (8,611 m), Broad Peak (8,047 m), the Gasherbrums (8,000+ m) and Masherbrum (7,821 m),all of which are also included in the Skardu District).

Etymology 
The word "gang" in the Balti language means "glacier", and '"che"  is used as a superlative term to indicate "an abundance". The word is used by the residents of the Khaplu Valley in the name of the Ghanche Nallah, a seasonal stream which flows through the town of Khaplu during the summer season. When the Pakistani government elevated the status of the Ghanche Tehsil to that of a district, the people of the valley willingly selected the name "Ghanche".

Administration 

The Ghanche District is divided into Six tehsils:

 Khaplu Tehsil
 Daghoni Tehsil
 Masherbrum Tehsil
 Chorbat Tehsil
 Ghowari Tehsil
 Keris Tehsil

The six tehsils are divided into 56 union councils, with each council containing many villages.  Four villages of the Chorbat Valley were lost in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. Those were the villages of Chalunka, Thang, Turtuk, and Tyakshi. . Some of them are given in the chart below.
