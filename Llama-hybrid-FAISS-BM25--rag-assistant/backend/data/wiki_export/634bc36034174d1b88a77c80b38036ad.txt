Early life

Career

Television
Cook made her debut on television in 1979 as Susie Denning in soap opera, The Restless Years.

Her relationship and wedding in A Country Practice to Dr Simon Bowen, played by Grant Dodwell, became one of the highest rated and most popular storylines of that series. After a break from television for over two years, Cook returned in 1989 to play Dr Elly Fielding in a new Ten Network soap opera, E Street. This role had been especially created for her, and Cook remained in the series from 1989 to early 1991. She went on to a guest role in ABC's medical drama G.P..
