History
Former Serbian name of this village was Feldvarac (Фелдварац). Historical sources from 1316 mentioned several settlements with name Feldvarac, but it is not sure which one of those could be identified with modern village. However, documents show that Serbs lived there before, during and after Ottoman rule.

The oldest and most reliable mention of place is from 1387 when it was part of the feudal lands of the Gorjanski family. In 1440, it belonged to the Serbian despot Đurađ Branković.

In 1519, there were, according to a 1925 article by ethnographer Borivoje Drobnjaković twelve Serbian households. By 1580, the number had decreased to four.

After the Ottoman forces left, Bačko Gradište became part of Tisa military border district. According to Habsburg census from 1720, this village was populated exclusively by Serbs, while in 1910 there were 1,390 houses with 6,922 inhabitants—3,934 Hungarians; 2,890 Serbs; and 98 Jews. In 1921, the population was 7,007 with a Hungarian majority.

Tourism
Bačko Gradište is very popular because of its Oxbow lake. There is a settlement of holiday houses there -without electricity- because the town doesn't want it to become an official village. People from Novi Sad, Belgrade, Temerin, Bečej, and Vrbas have houses here and they spend their time here on weekends, because it is very relaxing and far away from the urban life.

On 1 May there is a huge holiday at the oxbow lake, where even people from neighbouring countries (Hungary) come to enjoy the nature.
