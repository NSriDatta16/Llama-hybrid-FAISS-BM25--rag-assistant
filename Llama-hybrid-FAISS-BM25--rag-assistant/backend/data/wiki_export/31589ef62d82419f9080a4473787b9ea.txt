The Tampa Bay Devil Rays selected him in the 37th round of the 1998 Major League Baseball (MLB) draft, but he chose to attend Tuscaloosa's Shelton State Community College. He was then selected by the Kansas City Royals in the 18th round of the 1999 MLB draft, but he decided to transfer to Mississippi State University.

In 43 games (12 starts), he had a 4–8 record, a 5.38 ERA, 104 strikeouts, 36 walks, and 111 hits allowed in  innings. His 15 saves ranked fourth in the California League, behind Jared Hoerman's 29, Mike Frick's 23, and Frank Bludau's 22. This was the only year in which Medders made any starts.

In 2003, Medders pitched for the Class AA El Paso Diablos of the Texas League.

In 11 games, he had no record, a 4.26 ERA, 17 strikeouts, four walks, and 15 hits allowed in  innings pitched. He tore a labrum in his right shoulder during the year, requiring surgery to repair the injury.

2005–2006
Medders began 2005 with Tucson. On June 19, the Diamondbacks purchased his contract after Russ Ortiz was injured and Matt Herges was designated for assignment. He made his MLB debut the next day, pitching a scoreless eighth inning in an 8–3 loss to the San Francisco Giants. He was scored upon in one of six outings, posting a 3.38 ERA before being demoted to Tucson on July 2. Five days later, he was recalled by Arizona after Shawn Estes was injured. On July 18, he pitched a scoreless top of the 11th inning and earned his first MLB win when Arizona scored in the bottom of the inning to defeat the Florida Marlins 8–7. He pitched scoreless ball in four appearances on his second stint before getting sent to Tucson on August 2 so the Diamondbacks could add left-hander Buddy Groom to the roster. Recalled a third time on August 19 after Brian Bruney was sent down, Medders remained with Arizona for the rest of the season. In 36 games for Tucson, he had a 3–2 record, eight saves, a 2.48 ERA, 44 strikeouts, 18 walks, and 31 hits allowed in  innings. With Arizona in 27 games, he went 4–1 with a 1.78 ERA, 31 strikeouts, 11 walks, and 21 hits allowed in  innings.

In 2006, Medders suffered a muscle group strain that caused him to miss spring training. He started the year rehabbing at Tucson before getting called up by the Diamondbacks on April 19. On August 15, he had his longest outing of the year in the longest game in Colorado Rockies history, pitching a scoreless 16th-through-18th innings, striking out a season-high four batters, and earning the win in Arizona's 18-inning, 2–1 victory. He had his lowest ERA for the team in the month of May, posting a figure of 0.61 in 11 games. From June 3 through 6, he gave up nine runs in three games, but only one was earned; the rest were the result of three Diamondback errors. In 60 games, he had a 5–3 record, a 3.64 ERA, 47 strikeouts, 28 walks, and 76 hits in  innings.

2007–2008
Medders started 2007 inconsistently. He was optioned to Tucson on June 8 after allowing eight home runs in  innings. In 35 games with Tucson, he had a 5–3 record, five saves, a 4.69 ERA, 38 strikeouts, 24 walks, and 55 hits allowed in 48 innings. Recalled when rosters expanded, Medders pitched seven more innings for the Diamondbacks, allowing just one more home run. In 30 games for Arizona, he had a 1–2 record, a 4.30 ERA, 23 strikeouts, 16 walks, and 30 hits allowed in  innings. He did not pitch in the playoffs for the Diamondbacks, who won the National League (NL) West and swept the Chicago Cubs in the 2007 National League Division Series before getting swept by the Rockies in the 2007 National League Championship Series.

After beginning 2008 with the Diamondbacks, Medders was surprised to be designated for assignment on May 22 and outrighted to Tucson on May 30. However, the Diamondbacks needed his roster spot for Doug Davis, who was returning from the disabled list. In 18 games with Arizona, he had a 1–0 record, a 4.58 ERA, eight strikeouts, 11 walks, and 17 hits allowed in  innings. With Tucson in 26 games, Medders had a 1–2 record, a 7.45 ERA, 33 strikeouts, 24 walks, and 45 hits allowed in  innings. No longer on Arizona's 40-man roster, he was not recalled in September and became a free agent at the end of the season.

From May 10 through June 9, he allowed just two runs (neither earned) in 13 innings over a 14-game span. In the first game of a doubleheader against the Washington Nationals on June 4, Medders relieved Randy Johnson and pitched a scoreless seventh, preserving the lead in the 300th win of Johnson's career. Against Arizona on August 26, Medders picked up the only save of his MLB career, pitching a flawless ninth inning to preserve a 4–3 victory. He described what it was like to pitch in that game:

Medders avoided arbitration and agreed to a one-year $820,000 contract with the Giants on January 16, 2010. On May 21, he was placed on the disabled list. While on a rehab assignment with the PCL's Fresno Grizzlies, he was outrighted to Fresno on June 4 to make room on the Giants' 40-man roster for Pat Burrell. In 14 games for San Francisco, he had no record, a 7.20 ERA, eight strikeouts, six walks, and 26 hits allowed in 15 innings. He pitched in 22 games for Fresno, earning a 2–1 record, one save, a 5.46 ERA, 26 strikeouts, 10 walks, and 28 hits allowed in 28 innings.
