The 91st Security Forces Group falls under operational command of the 91st Missile Wing, and provides command and control for four squadrons—the 91st Missile Security Forces Squadron, 791st Missile Security Forces Squadron, 891st Missile Security Forces Squadron, and 91st Missile Security Operations Squadron – for the active defense of assets vital to national security. The 91st SFG ensures Security Forces are trained, organized and equipped to secure 150 Minuteman III missiles and Launch Facilities and 15 Missile Alert Facilities geographically separated throughout 8,500 square miles of the missile complex. All security support, including anti-terrorism, physical security measures and response forces for the 91st Missile Wing, are provided by the 91 SFG.

These units are the largest Security Forces contingent at Minot Air Force Base, being primarily responsible for maintaining the security of the Minuteman III missile silos in the surrounding area. When added together with the 5th Security Forces Squadron, Minot AFB has more Security Forces Airmen than any other installation in the Department of Defense.
