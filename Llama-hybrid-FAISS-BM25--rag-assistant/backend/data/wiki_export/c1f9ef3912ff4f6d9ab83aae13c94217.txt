It rises in the Cascade Range at , where Middle Fork Tumalo Creek and North Fork Tumalo Creek meet, and forms several waterfalls, including the   Tumalo Falls. Its mouth is on the Deschutes at .

It is home to several species of trout, including the Columbia River redband trout. It is the primary drinking water source for the city of Bend. The lower reaches of the creek are often emptied for irrigation, drained by a tunnel flume at  and Tumalo Canal at .

In 1883, the first known canal to be dug from the creek was created to divert water to farms.
