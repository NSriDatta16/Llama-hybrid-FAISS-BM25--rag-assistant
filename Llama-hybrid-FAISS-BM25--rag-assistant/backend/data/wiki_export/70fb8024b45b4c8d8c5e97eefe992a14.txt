Early life and education
Known as Sabu Cyril today, he was born Sebastian Vincent Cyril in the hill station of Valparai(Coimbatore District, Tamil Nadu), and completed his schooling in Asan Memorial (Chennai). He graduated from the Government College of Fine Arts, Chennai (formerly Government School of Arts and Crafts, Chennai). It was his grandfather George Vincent who first called him 'Sabu'. George Vincent was known for opening the first photography studio in Malabar, Kozhikode, called Chitra Studio. His son (Sabu’s uncle), Mr. A. Vincent was a reputed cinematographer and director in the South Indian Film Industry. It was probably his proximity to nature, wildlife and cinema that subconsciously helped Sabu develop an affinity to the world of aesthetics and design. Ever since he was a child, Sabu was always interested in knowing how things work and how this can be applied in everyday life. This curiosity drew him to the world of physics and chemistry, which helped him develop a scientific and practical outlook to problem-solving. Sabu started his career as a graphic designer and illustrator. It was only as a favour to a friend that he entered a film set. Circumstance and chance made Sabu an Art Director on his first ever film. Sabu believes that he could rise to the challenge because of his inclination towards science and art, it may seem as if he was destined to be a Production Designer all along.

Career
From 1982 to 1988, he was a freelance graphics designer for companies such as Welcomgroup Hotels, the Taj Group of Hotels, and Madura Coats. In 1988, he began his art director career, and has directed more than 2,500 advertisements, 3 teleserials and 115 feature films in Malayalam, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu and Kannada and designed several stage shows. In 1996, he directed the stage design for the Miss World beauty pageant. He also worked as one of the 2nd unit Art Directors in the 1990 film Iyer the Great.
