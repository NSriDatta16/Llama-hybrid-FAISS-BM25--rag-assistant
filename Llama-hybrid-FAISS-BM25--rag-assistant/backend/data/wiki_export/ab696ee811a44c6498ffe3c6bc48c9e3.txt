Silver Star citation
Citation:

The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Corporal Henry H. Black (MCSN: 667269), United States Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity while serving as a Jeep Driver of Headquarters and Service Company, Third Battalion, First Marines, FIRST Marine Division (Reinforced), during operations against enemy aggressor forces in Korea on 28 November 1950. Observing that a 60-mm. mortar section was rapidly exhausting its supply of ammunition during a fierce attack against his company's positions by numerically superior enemy forces, Corporal Black accompanied by a fellow Marine voluntarily completed two trips to the company ammunition dump, which had been overrun by the enemy, and returning on foot on each occasion, brought back mortar ammunition in the face of a continued enemy barrage of small arms, machine gun and mortar fire. Risking his life again, he led his companion through the enemy penetration, obtained a jeep and trailer, assisted in loading the vehicles with ammunition and boldly drove through the intense fire to his company command post. By his daring initiative, aggressive determination and courageous efforts in the face of extreme peril, Corporal Black contributed materially to the successful repulse of the attackers and upheld the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.
