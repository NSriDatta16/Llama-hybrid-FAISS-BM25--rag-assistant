George Waldegrave, 5th Earl Waldegrave (13 July 1784 â€“ 29 June 1794) was the son of the 4th Earl Waldegrave and his wife, Elizabeth Waldegrave, Countess Waldegrave.

Upon his father's death in 1789, he inherited his titles at the age of five but drowned whilst swimming in the River Thames near Eton in 1794, a week before his tenth birthday. His titles then passed to his brother, John.
