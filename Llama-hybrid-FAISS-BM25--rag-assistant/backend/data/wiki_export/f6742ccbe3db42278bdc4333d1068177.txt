"Filthy/Gorgeous" is a song by American pop-rock band Scissor Sisters. It is the seventh track on their self-titled debut album. Released as the album's fifth and final single in the United Kingdom on January 3, 2005, the song peaked at number five on the UK Singles Chart, making it the band's first British top-five single. It also reached number one on the UK Dance Chart and on the US Billboard Dance Club Songs chart. In Australia, it peaked at number 29 on the ARIA Singles Chart, and in Ireland, it reached number 13.

Music video
Two versions of the music video, directed by John Cameron Mitchell, were made: a full-length, raunchier version featuring semi-explicit scenes in a sex club, and an edited version where those scenes are shown more briefly, out of context, and occasionally obscured. Some scenes are removed completely.
