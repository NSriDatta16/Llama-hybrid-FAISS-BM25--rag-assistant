Mu Sigma Upsilon is a multicultural-based sorority in the United States and a founding member of the National Multicultural Greek Council.

History
In the early 1980s, more women from culturally diverse backgrounds were pursuing college degrees. Five women came together and decided to create a support system for these women. Mu Sigma Upsilon was founded on November 21, 1981, at Rutgers University, New Brunswick, as a Social Fellowship. The five Founding Mothers of Mu Sigma Upsilon are:

 Eve Bracero - Puerto Rican
 Lillian Sierra - Puerto Rican
 Karinee Candelario - Puerto Rican
 Ruth Gonzalez - Puerto Rican
 Sylvia Vigo - Puerto Rican
In the early 1980s, Mu Sigma Upsilon became the first sorority to be founded with a multicultural, rather than a specific ethnic or cultural, base. Mu Sigma Upsilon became a Greek-lettered organization in the early 1990s. It is the sister organization of Lambda Sigma Upsilon, a Latino-based fraternity.

R.A.C.E  is a national event of the sorority. Each chapter runs its version of the event, where campus cultural organizations are invited to perform in costume and provide cultural displays for table-top exhibitions during the event. Members are encouraged to wear national dress about their cultural background or heritage and provide sample delicacies from all parts of the world.

Mu Sigma Upsilon Foundation 
The Mu Sigma Upsilon Foundation Inc. is a 501(c)(3) charitable non-profit organization. The mission of the foundation is to provide essential support and financial resources for the educational, leadership, and charitable purposes of the sorority to enrich the lives of members and assist in improving the community in which they serve.

T.I.A.R.A. Interest Group
T.I.A.R.A. stands for Togetherness, Independence, Academics, Respect and Achievement. The T.I.A.R.A. Group is the official interest group of Mu Sigma Upsilon. Being an active T.I.A.R.A. gives interested ladies the opportunity to get an in-depth look at the sisterhood. They experience first-hand what it would be like to be a sister of MSU through event/meeting planning, programming, fundraising and networking. It also allows for the prospective members to build relationships with one another and Mu Sigma Upsilon sisters.
