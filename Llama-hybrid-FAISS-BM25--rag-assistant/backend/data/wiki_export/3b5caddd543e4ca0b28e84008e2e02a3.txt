Song information
"Absolutely Everybody" debuted and peaked at number six on the Australia ARIA Single Charts, her fourth-highest-charting single to date. It was the 74th-best-selling single of 1999 and the 40th-best-selling single for 2000 in that country. It remained in the ARIA Singles Chart for over six months after its release. In New Zealand, the single peaked at number 10 on 14 May 2000 and spent 27 weeks in the top 50. Shortly after her performances at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, the song was released internationally and reached the top 10 in the United Kingdom and throughout Europe. The song's highest peak was in Hungary, where it reached number one.

For her service to music, Amorosi was later awarded the Australian Centenary Medal by the Government of Australia. "Absolutely Everybody", with its positive lyrics, became an unofficial theme song for various cultural events. The song had four different music videos. The first was released in Australia in 1999, followed by the Australian Millennium version; the other two videos were made for the British and German markets, respectively, in 2000.
