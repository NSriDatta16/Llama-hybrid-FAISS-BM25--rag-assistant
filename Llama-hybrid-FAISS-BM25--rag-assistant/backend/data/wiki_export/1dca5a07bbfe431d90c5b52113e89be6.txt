Take a Look Around is the debut solo studio album by American rapper Masta Ace. It was released on July 24, 1990 through Cold Chillin' Records with distribution via Reprise Records. Recording sessions took place at House Of Hits in Chestnut Ridge, New York and at Libra Digital Sound in Long Island City. Production was handled by Marley Marl and Mister Cee.

Background
After appearing on the classic hip hop crew cut "The Symphony" with the Juice Crew in 1988, Ace released his first single, "Together" b/w "Letter to the Better" in 1989. "Together" was included in the album as well as a remixed version of "Letter to the Better".

Released in June 1990, "Me and the Biz" (b/w "I Got Ta") peaked at #47 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and #8 on the Hot Rap Songs. The song, a tribute of sorts to labelmate Biz Markie, in which Ace plays the role of both himself and Biz (who reportedly couldn't make it to the studio for the actual collaboration he desired), was later featured on 2004 video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas as a song in rotation on the fictional radio station Playback FM. A single for "I Got Ta" was released only in the UK and Europe.

Reaching a peak position of number thirteen on the Hot Rap Songs, the album's third single, "Music Man" (b/w "Ace Iz Wild"), remained on the chart for a total of nine weeks.

"Movin' On" (b/w "Go Where I Send Thee") was released on March 6, 1991 as the final single from Take a Look Around.
