Cladosictis is an extinct genus of South American metatherian from Patagonia, Argentina (Chichinales, Cerro Bandera, Sarmiento and Santa Cruz Formations) and Chile (Río Frias Formation).

Description 

Cladosictis was a fox-like creature that was around  long. Cladosictis probably hunted for eggs and small animals in the low undergrowth, using its low posture for cover. With sharp canines and slicing carnassials, Cladosictis's teeth were similar to those of carnivorans, although the groups were unrelated.
