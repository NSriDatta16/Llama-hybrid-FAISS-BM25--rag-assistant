Centro Desportivo Olímpico - Estádio () is a multi-purpose stadium in Taipa, Macau, China. It was formerly named Estádio Campo Desportivo () before the reconstruction of the stadium had been completed.

The Olympic Sports Center is the largest sporting complex in Macau. It is more often known as the Macau Olympic Complex Stadium since it is the largest facility of the complex. The complex comprises a stadium - a grass pitch (105 x 68 m) surrounded by an 8-lane athletic track and a long jump area, a 900-seated indoor stadium, a hockey centre, a practicing track and several tennis courts. In general, it is used mostly for football matches and athletics.
