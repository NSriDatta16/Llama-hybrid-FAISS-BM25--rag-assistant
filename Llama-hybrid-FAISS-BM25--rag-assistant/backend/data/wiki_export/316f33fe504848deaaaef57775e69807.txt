Adobogiona (fl. c. 80 BC - c. 50 BC) was a Celtic princess from Anatolia. She was the daughter of king Deiotarus of Galatia and Berenice, Princess of Pergamon, probably a daughter of king Attalus III of Pergamon.

Adobogiona married Brogitarus, King of Galatia, who reigned concurrently with his father-in-law. They were the parents of Amyntas of Galatia, a tetrarch of the Trocmi tribe and king of Galatia.

Adobogiona was honoured by a surviving inscription discovered on the island of Lesbos and a portrait head of her has been discovered at Pergamon.
