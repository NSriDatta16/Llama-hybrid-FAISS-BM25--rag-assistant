Coat of arms

Homberg's oldest known seal dates back to 1234, even before the town was granted town rights. Until the 16th century, the town's arms generally showed a castle or town wall with the red-and-silver-striped Lion of Hessen, and in 1536, a new version suddenly showed the lion "sinister" – facing left (from the arms bearer's point of view). The arms in use today, which were adopted in the late 19th century, are based on this version.

Town partnerships
The town of Homberg maintains partnerships with the following places:
  Thouaré-sur-Loire, near Nantes, France, since 1981
  Stadtroda, Thuringia, since 1990

Transportation
Homberg lies in the area of the Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund (Rhine-Main Transport Network). The busline 5332 of the Kurhessen Regional Transport system connects Homberg with the nearest railway stations at Burg- and Nieder Gemünden on the Vogelsbergbahn railway line and Kirchhain on the Main-Weser line. The busline VB-71 run by the Verkehrsgesellschaft Oberhessen (Upper Hessen Transport Company) also goes to Gemünden, and line VB-13a offers a direct connection to Alsfeld railway station.

The Ohmtalbahn, which runs through Homberg (Burg- and Nieder Gemünden–Kirchhain) is nowadays only partly in service beginning at Nieder-Ofleiden, and only then for goods trains that serve a basalt quarry.

The Homberg (Ohm) interchange on Autobahn A 5 lies about 10 km south of the town core, while 8 km to the north runs Federal Highway (Bundesstraße) 62.
