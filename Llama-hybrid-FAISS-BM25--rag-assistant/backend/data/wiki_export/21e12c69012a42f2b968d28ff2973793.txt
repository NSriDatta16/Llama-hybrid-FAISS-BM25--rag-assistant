In 2000, Metro's Arts in Transit program commissioned the work Ohne Titel by Olafur Eliasson for installation in the tunnel near this station. The 60 aluminum lamp housings with colored acrylic lenses and fluorescent lamps work together to create dabs of glowing colors that span the tunnel wall in an evenly spaced spectrum.
