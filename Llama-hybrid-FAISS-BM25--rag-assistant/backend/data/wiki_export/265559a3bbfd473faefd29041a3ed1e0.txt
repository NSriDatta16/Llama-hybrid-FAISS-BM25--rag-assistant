Hamilton East is a suburb in central Hamilton in New Zealand. The suburb's primary commercial and retail precinct is located along Grey Street. Hamilton East is characterised by villas and bungalows built early in the 20th century.

History
Hamilton East is one of Hamilton's oldest suburbs. From the 1870s until the mid-20th century, Hamilton East was sometimes known as 'Irishtown'. A significant number of the militiamen who settled there were of Irish descent, and many other Irish Catholics came to live near the Catholic Church and convent.

The town of Hamilton East merged with Hamilton West in 1877. Many of the streets were named after famous figures of the New Zealand Wars, including Governor George Grey and Maori chief Te Awaitaia, who went by the name William Naylor/Wiremu Neera when he converted to Christianity. Evidence of planning for the centre of the village can be seen in the village green concept of Steele Park and the planting of English trees along Grey Street. Hamilton East is one of the few suburbs of Hamilton to have a street grid plan.

Many of the parks in Hamilton East, including Hamilton Gardens, are located on the original Hamilton Town Belt that runs along the eastern and southern border of Hamilton East. Just to the north of the Gardens, Flynn Park housed an ammunition factory from 1942 to 1946. It is the most southerly of the parks in the original Belt and on the edge of the Wairere Drive extension to Peacocke.

Until February 1971 the Royal Hotel stood on the corner of Grey Street and Cook Street, now occupied by Eastside Tavern and Liquorland. The first Royal Hotel was opened on the southwest corner of Grey and Cook Streets in July 1865, by Lewis Bassiere Harris, of the 4th Waikato Militia Regiment. The hotel burnt down in 1894 and was rebuilt later that year. Many early meetings were held in the hotel, including those of Kirikiriroa Road Board.

In 2000 the suburb was extended over a former part of Ruakura Experimental Farm, by Grasshopper East Ltd. and Chedworth Properties Ltd adding 321 houses at Sherwood Park.  Although the streets are named with a Sherwood Forest theme, it required a campaign to preserve a shelter belt of redwood trees from the development.

The much-praised paradise collection includes a Chinese scholar's garden, an English flower garden, a Japanese garden of contemplation, an American modernist garden, an Italian Renaissance garden and an Indian char bagh garden.

Hayes Paddock

Hayes Paddock, an enclave in Hamilton East developed between 1939 and 1945, was planned and built according to the philosophies and ideals of the First Labour Government and the Garden City Movement.  It includes curved street patterns, open plan garden layouts, low density development, and the provision of walkways and reserves. Hayes Paddock contains over 200 classic state houses built along seven streets named mostly after New Zealand governors general.

Macfarlane Street, the only street not named after a governor general, was named after James MacFarlane, a partner in the Auckland company of Henderson and MacFarlane.
