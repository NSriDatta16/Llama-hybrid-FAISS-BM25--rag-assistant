is a Japanese actor and singer associated with Stay Luck. He began acting as a child and is sometimes mistaken with Daisuke Hirakawa, as their names only differ by one character when written in kanji. Despite his wide range of roles, he usually plays young heroes, such as Mikage in 07-Ghost, Fay D. Flourite in Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, Jellal Fernandes and his counterpart Mystogan in Fairy Tail, Rokuro "Rock" Okajima in Black Lagoon, Jack The Ripper in Black Clover, Keita Ibuki in Black God, Goemon Ishikawa XIII in later instalments of Lupin the Third, and Yu Narukami in Persona 4. He has also been cast as anti-heroes or antagonists, such as Ulquiorra Cifer in Bleach, Hisoka Morow in Hunter × Hunter (2011), Kei Kurono in Gantz, Eustass Kid in One Piece, Dr. Genus in One Punch Man, Chōsō in Jujutsu Kaisen, Tōru Oikawa in Haikyuu!!, Kishō Arima in Tokyo Ghoul, and Momoshiki Otsutsuki in Boruto: Naruto Next Generations.

He is the official Japanese dub-over voice artist for American actor Elijah Wood and Canadian actor Hayden Christensen. He has also dubbed over some roles that were performed by other fellow actors such as: Leonardo DiCaprio, Tony Jaa, Edward Furlong, and Kevin Zegers in Japanese. He made his directorial debut for Wonderful World, a live-action film that opened in Japan in early summer of 2010. He also starred in the film itself, alongside Mamoru Miyano, Tomokazu Sugita, Tomokazu Seki, Rikiya Koyama, Yuka Hirata, Toshiyuki Morikawa, Kōichi Yamadera, Showtaro Morikubo and Yūko Kaida.

Personal life
Namikawa married in 2001. On July 19, 2017, Shūkan Bunshun reported that Namikawa had been involved in an on-and-off extramarital affair with a female employee from his previous agency since 2004, whom he met when she had still been a teenager. Namikawa later confirmed the report and apologized.
