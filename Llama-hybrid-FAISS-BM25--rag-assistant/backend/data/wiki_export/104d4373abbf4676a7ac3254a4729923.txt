History
The court has its historical roots originating with the Gulating, one of the first Norwegian legislative assemblies or Þing, which was established before the year 900. This old assembly remained in operation until 1797 when the courts were changed. A new court law went into effect on 1 January 1890 which re-established the Gulating Court of Appeal which included all of Bergen, Søndre Bergenhus, Nordre Bergenhus, and Romsdalen counties. In 1892, some courts were consolidated and this court gained all of the county of Stavanger. On 1 January 1907, all of Trøndelag was added to the court as well, and at that time, the name of the court was changed to Gula- og Frostating Court of Appeal. On 1 July 1936, the northern part of the jurisdiction (Trøndelag and Møre og Romsdal) was separated to become the new Frostating Court of Appeal and the southern part continued as the Gulating Court of Appeal (using the old name again).
