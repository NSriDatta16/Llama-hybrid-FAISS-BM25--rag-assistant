History 

New Hampton School was founded on June 27, 1821, as a Free Will Baptist-oriented, coeducational institution. On that day the State of New Hampshire issued a charter to the New Hampton Academy, "having had three several readings," before the House of Representatives. That charter, issued to William B. Kelley, Nathaniel Norris and Joshua Drake, provided the framework for the institution that would become the New Hampton School and emphasized the "promotion of science and the useful arts." The school was later known as the known as the New Hampton Literary and Theological Institution. From 1854 to 1870, the Cobb Divinity School was affiliated with the institute before moving to Bates College in Maine.

Between 1925 and 1970 the school was a non-denominational school for boys. It returned to coeducation in 1970.
