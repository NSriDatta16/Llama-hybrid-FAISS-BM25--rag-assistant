Bonfol waste dump

Beginning in 1961 many of the largest pharmaceutical and chemical companies in and around Basel began burying chemical waste in a former clay mine outside the village.  Eight of the largest, including BASF, Novartis, Roche and Syngenta, formed Basler Chemischen Industrie (BCI) to administer the site.  The Bonfol dump remained in operation until 1976 and over those fifteen years about  of chemicals were dumped.  After it was closed BCI believed the clay would hold the waste in place.  The dump was buried and the  of land that it covered was replanted.  However, in 1981 the first leaks were detected from the dump and from 1986 through 1995 BCI installed a drainage system and built a runoff treatment plant.  After protests by Greenpeace and the passage of Switzerland’s Federal Ordinance on the Contaminated Sites in 1998, on 17 October 2000 BCI signed an agreement with the Canton to fully excavate and clean the entire dump.

In 2007 construction began on an excavation hall that covered the entire site.  Using a large overhead crane and digging bucket up to  of contaminated earth was excavated per day.  It was then loaded on sealed rail cars and taken to incinerators in Germany where it was burned at temperatures up to  and turned into chemically stable ash.  In July 2010 some of the chemicals in the dump exploded during excavation.  One machinist suffered minor injuries and the project paused for several months to evaluate the hazard.  At the end of August 2016 the last of the contaminated soil was removed, bringing the total removed and incinerated to .  The project cost BCI a total of .
