Sam Hamm (born November 19, 1955) is an American screenwriter and comic book writer. Hamm is known for writing the initial drafts of the screenplay for the 1989 Batman movie before those duties were handed over to Warren Skaaren. He also received a story credit for Batman Returns (though the final version of the movie differs significantly from his ideas).

DC Comics invited Hamm to write for Detective Comics. The result was Batman: Blind Justice, which introduced Bruce Wayne's mentor, Henri Ducard. Hamm's other screen credits include Never Cry Wolf and Monkeybone.

In 2021, Hamm returned to the 1989 Batman film universe with the limited DC Comics series Batman '89, a direct continuation of both the 1989 film and Batman Returns.
