Vanua Lava is the second largest of the Banks Islands in Torba Province, Vanuatu, after slightly larger Gaua.

It is located about 120 km north-northeast of Espiritu Santo and north of Gaua.

Name
The name Vanua Lava  comes from the Mota language, which was used as the primary language of the Melanesian Mission. Locally, the island is called Vōnōlav / in Vurës and Mwesen, Vunulava  in Vera'a, and Vunulāv  in Lemerig. In the immigrant language Mwotlap, it is referred to as Apnōlap  (with the locative prefix a-). Cognates in other Torres-Banks languages include Lakon Vanōlav . All of these terms come from a Proto-Torres–Banks form *βanua laβa "Large Land".

History
Vanua Lava was first sighted by Europeans during the Spanish expedition of Pedro Fernández de Quirós from 25 to 29 April 1606. The island’s name was then charted as Portal de Belén (“Nativity scene” in Spanish).

Vanua Lava was first explored by a New Zealand bishop, George Augustus Selwyn, in 1859. The sulfur deposits of Mt. Suretamate were at one time worked by a French company. Copra is the chief export.

Natural history
A 14,850 ha tract, encompassing the upper slopes of Mount Suretamate and much of the northeastern coastline of the island, has been recognised as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports populations of Vanuatu megapodes, Vanuatu imperial pigeons, Tanna fruit doves, red-bellied fruit doves, palm lorikeets, cardinal myzomelas, Vanuatu honeyeaters, fan-tailed gerygones, long-tailed trillers, streaked fantails, Melanesian flycatchers, buff-bellied monarchs, southern shrikebills, Santo thicketbirds and Vanuatu white-eyes. It is also home to seabird breeding colonies of collared and white-necked petrels. Other animals found on the island include coconut crabs and Banks flying foxes.

Population and languages
The population of Vanua Lava was 2,623 in the 2009 census.

Vanua Lava is home to four indigenous languages: Vurës, with about 2000 speakers; Vera'a, with 500; and two dying languages, Mwesen, with 10 speakers, and Lemerig, with only 2 living speakers. Other languages on the island, spoken by migrant communities, include Mwotlap (on the northeastern coast) and Mota (in the east). The language most commonly spoken in Sola, the administrative capital, where people from different language backgrounds meet, is Bislama.

Vanua Lava evidently used to harbour more languages in the past, several of which have disappeared since the mid 19th century.
