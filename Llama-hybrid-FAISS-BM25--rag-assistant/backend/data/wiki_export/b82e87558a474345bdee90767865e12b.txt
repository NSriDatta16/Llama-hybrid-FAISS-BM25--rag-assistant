Zafar Ali Khan (1874– 27 November 1956) ( – ), also known as Maulana Zafar Ali Khan, was a Pakistani writer, poet, translator and a journalist who played an important role in the Pakistan Movement against the British rule.

Well-versed in Islamic as well Western knowledge such as the latest trends in economics, sociology and politics, he has been considered as one of the fathers of Urdu journalism.

Early life
Zafar was born into a Punjabi Jat family of the Janjua clan in Sialkot, British India. He received his early education at Mission High School, Wazirabad, Wazirabad District, matriculated (10th grade) from Patiala, and passed his intermediate (12th grade) from the Aligarh College. Next, he worked in the postal department of the state of Jammu and Kashmir, the same place where his father worked, but resigned over a row with his seniors. He rejoined Aligarh College and gained his BA degree from there; stood fifth in his batch.

Career 
After graduation, Khan was appointed secretary to a Muslim political leader Mohsin-ul-Mulk, then in Bombay. Then he worked for some time as a translator in Hyderabad, Deccan, rising to the post of Secretary, Home Department. He returned from Hyderabad and launched his daily Zamindar newspaper from Lahore , founded by his father Maulvi Sirajuddin Ahmad.

Relation with the Ahmadiyya Movement

Zafar Ali Khan's relationship with the Qadiani movement was belligerent. He was among the vanguard, who censured Mirza Ghulam Qadiani for writing poems mocking him. He even wrote the preface to the book "His Holiness", which was written as a refutation of the Qadiani movement. Later on, when Pakistan was created he was an ardent participant of the 1953 Tehreek e Khatm e Nabuwat (a movement against the Qadianis), writing fervorous articles against them.

Notes 

Maulana would never miss a chance to snub the British government and the Heavens had provided him ample opportunities to carry out his sacred mission. Shaheed Ghazi Ilam Din had killed a blasphemous person and was sent to gallows in the Mianwali jail. The government buried him in Mianwali which infuriated the Muslims in Punjab. They protested and made a unanimous demand to bring Shaeed's body to Lahore but no one was prepared to give coverage to their voice as Hindus dominated most of the newspapers in the old Punjab before 1947. A large procession led by Lal Din Qaiser reached the office of Zamindar in 1903 newspaper which was the only hope for the Muslims at that time and succeeded in getting newspaper coverage for their event.
