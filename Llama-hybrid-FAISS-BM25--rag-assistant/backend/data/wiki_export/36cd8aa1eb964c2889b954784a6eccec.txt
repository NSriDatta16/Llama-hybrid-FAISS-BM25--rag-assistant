Darren Niel Lange (born 5 August 1971), from Toowoomba, Australia is a former freestyle swimming champion. He competed in the Australian Olympic trials on three occasions to qualify for an Australian Team but fell short, although in 1991 he qualified for the World Championship Team. Darren went on to represent Australia on eleven national teams including the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. Two years later Darren achieved gold and silver medals at the 1994 Commonwealth Games in Victoria, Canada.

While still competing internationally during 1994, Darren began a business career and founded the Darren Lange Swimming Academy, now one of southeast Queensland's largest swim schools.

In 1998 after being out of the water for two years, Darren refocused his goals on making it back onto the Australian Swim Team and was selected to represent Australia at the European World Cup series as well as the Short Course World Championships.

Darren then went on to win a silver medal at the Sheffield World Cup and place 6th in the World Championships in the 50-metre freestyle in a personal best time of 22.12 seconds.

On 23 June 2000, Lange was awarded the Australian Sports Medal. The Australian Sports Medal commemorates the efforts of those who have achieved in Australian sport.

With the goal of performing on the world swimming stage now achieved, Darren turned his attention back to his business career with the purchase of Bird Pool Services in 2006, now rebranded Lange Pool and Spa.
