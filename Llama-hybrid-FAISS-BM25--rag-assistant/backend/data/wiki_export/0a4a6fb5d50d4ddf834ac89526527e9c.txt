The Ghosts That Haunt Me is the 1991 debut album by the Canadian folk rock group Crash Test Dummies. It featured their hit "Superman's Song".

The artwork featured on the cover, and throughout the liner notes, is by 19th-century illustrator Gustav Doré and is from 'The Rime of the Ancient Mariner' by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. The same painting would later be used for black metal band Judas Iscariot's final album To Embrace the Corpses Bleeding in 2002.

The artworks on the booklet of the album are by 19th-century illustrator Gustav Doré and are from 'The Rime of the Ancient Mariner' by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, except "The Flying Man" by French novelist Nicolas Restif de la Bretonne, from 'The Discovery of the Austral Continent by a Flying Man', 1781.
