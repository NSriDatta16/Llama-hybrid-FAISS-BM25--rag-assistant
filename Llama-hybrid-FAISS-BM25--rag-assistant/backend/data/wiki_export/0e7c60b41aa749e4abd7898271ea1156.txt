Te Kāea (or Te Kaea News as written on television guides) is a nightly New Zealand television news show that airs on Whakaata Māori at 6:30pm. It is repeated at 10:30pm, and has English subtitles. Te Kāea is also shown in Australia, helped by Whakaata Māori's "strong collaborative relationship" with Australia's NITV as members of the World Indigenous Television Broadcasters Network (WITBN).

Te Kāea is anchored by Piripi Taylor.
