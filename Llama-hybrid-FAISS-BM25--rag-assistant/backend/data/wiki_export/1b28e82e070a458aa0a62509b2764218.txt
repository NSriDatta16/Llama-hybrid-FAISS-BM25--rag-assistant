The PTBC Storm English Open is one of the Europe's leading Ten-pin bowling tournaments. It was formed by the Premier Tenpin Bowling Club under the BTBA. In 2007 it forms part of the European Bowling Tour, and following the cancellation of the Kungsbacka International tournament in Sweden, becomes the final tournament in the calendar.

The inaugural PTBC Storm English Open was put together in 2006 by the PTBC to essentially replace the loss of the British Open. The PTBC's intention is for the tournament to grow to a level that will compete with some of the largest amateur tournaments outside of the United States. The tournament was won by Paul Moor of England.

The 2007 Tournament

The 2007 English Open will take place from the 5th to 9 December, and is the 18th and final stop in the 2007 European Bowling Tour (EBT). It is an EBT Challenger event, offering normal EBT ranking points for the top 50 Men and top 50 Women. The tournament is also a British ranking event to determine the selection of bowlers to represent Team GB during 2008, and it will also be the third and final tour stop of the Storm Rolling Thunder Tour.

Lane maintenance will be provided by kegel.

The venue will be at the Lakeside Superbowl in Nuneaton, Warwickshire. This town will provide the PTBC with an excellent range of facilities due to our close working relationship directly with the bowl. With plenty of room behind the lanes, an impeccably clean centre and a highly rated pro-shop onsite it's no wonder Nuneaton is a regular on the UK tournament calendar.

Located in the Bermuda Park retail centre, there are plenty of fast food outlets and restaurants, an 8 screen cinema and a hotel on-site. You shouldn't need to venture far from the action, but should you wish to explore whilst you are here there are plenty of tourist attractions all within easy reach.
