Discovery Travel & Living was a channel brand from Discovery Communications. This name was used in countries of Europe, Latin America and Asia. In other parts of the world the channel is known as Travel and Living Channel. It features travel shows rather than the documentaries on Discovery Science.

Discovery Travel & Living was launched as Discovery Travel & Adventure Channel. In early 2005 it was repositioned and rebranded as Discovery Travel & Living as a part of a "lifestyle" package from Discovery Communications, also including Discovery Home & Health and Discovery Real Time.

Discovery Travel & Living recently announced they are going to Sky Television (New Zealand) and Freeview service in the near future.

Starting in Norway in March 2010, Discovery Networks rolled out the TLC brand internationally. The rollout of TLC mostly replaced the Discovery Travel & Living.
