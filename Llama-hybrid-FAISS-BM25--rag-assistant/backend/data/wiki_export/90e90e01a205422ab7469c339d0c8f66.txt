The Berry Center of Northwest Houston (commonly known as Berry Center) is a multi-purpose sports complex located in Cypress, Texas. It was completed in March 2006 and consists of five separate facilities: an arena, stadium, theater, conference center and food production center. It was named after former Cy-Fair ISD superintendent Richard E. Berry. It serves as one of the two football stadiums used by CFISD, the other being Ken Pridgeon Stadium.

Amenities include the 11,000-seat Cy-Fair FCU Stadium used for football and soccer, a  conference center used for staff development able to be partitioned into 17 rooms, a 456-seat auditorium, a multi-purpose arena designed for a maximum capacity of 9,500 people with 8,300 fixed seats, and a floor banquet seating and catering facility to accommodate the preparation and serving of 1,000 meals.

In May 2016, the naming rights to the football stadium, previously known as simply "The Berry Center," were sold to Cy-Fair Federal Credit Union. The stadium was renamed "Cy-Fair FCU Stadium" for $1.5 million, to be paid over the span of 10 years.
