Myadestes is a genus of solitaires, medium-sized mostly insectivorous birds in the thrush family, Turdidae.

They are found in the Americas and Hawaii, where several island species have become extinct.

Taxonomy
The genus Myadestes was introduced in 1838 by the English naturalist William Swainson to accommodate a single species, the rufous-throated solitaire, which is therefore the type species of the genus. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek mua meaning "fly" and edestēs meaning "eater".

The genus contains 12 species:

 Brown-backed solitaire, Myadestes occidentalis Stejneger, 1882 – northwest Mexico to Honduras
 Slate-colored solitaire, Myadestes unicolor Sclater, PL, 1857 – south Mexico to Nicaragua
 Townsend's solitaire, Myadestes townsendi (Audubon, 1838) – west Canada to central Mexico
 † Kamao, Myadestes myadestinus (Stejneger, 1887) – Kauai (Hawaiian Islands, extinct)
 Puaiohi, Myadestes palmeri (Rothschild, 1893) – Kauai (Hawaiian Islands)
 Oloma'o, Myadestes lanaiensis (Wilson, SB, 1891) – Hawaiian Islands
 ʻŌmaʻo, Myadestes obscurus (Gmelin, JF, 1789) – Hawaii (Hawaiian Islands)
 Cuban solitaire, Myadestes elisabeth (Lembeye, 1850) – Cuba
 Rufous-throated solitaire, Myadestes genibarbis Swainson, 1838 – West Indies
