Mowry Baden (born in 1936 in Los Angeles) is an American sculptor who has lived and worked in Canada since 1975. He is known for his gallery-based kinaesthetic sculptures and for his public sculpture, both of which require a strong element of bodily interaction on the part of the viewer.

Life
Baden was born January 17, 1936, in Los Angeles, California. A 1954 graduate of Redondo Union High School in Redondo Beach, California, Baden studied at Pomona College (BA, 1958) and Stanford University (MFA, 1965). He has practiced sculpture for nearly 50 years and has taught sculpture at Raymond College, Pomona College, UBC, and the University of Victoria, from which he retired in 1997. Artist Chris Burden was one of his students. He lives in Victoria, British Columbia, where he continues to produce sculpture and public art. He is married to actor-director-writer Judith McDowell.

Art practice
Baden is known for his sculptures that allow the viewer to generate kinaesthetic experiences. To this end, his gallery-based works often use mechanisms or physical components that encourage viewer interaction.
