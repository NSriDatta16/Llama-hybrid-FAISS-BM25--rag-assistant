History
Surface finds from the Celtic and Roman times were discovered or excavated in Bosen, Eisen, Eiweiler, Mosberg-Richweiler, Neunkirchen (Nahe), Nohfelden, Selbach, Sötern, Türkismühle, Walhausen and Wolfersweiler. The Nohfelden castle was first mentioned in 1286 and a Nohfelden magistracy in 1372.

Since the early Middle Ages (around 1200) until July 1879 and in the years 1946/47, when Nohfelden was moved from Rhineland-Palatinate to Saarland, the historical development of the 13 districts has differed. Around 1790, lordship was divided among the following four areas:
 The Duchy of Palatine Zweibrücken, which evolved from the County of Veldenz in the 15th century, containing Eckelhausen, Eisen, Mosberg-Richweiler, Nohfelden, (Türkismühle), Walhausen, and Wolfersweiler,
 The Imperial Lordship of Eberswald with associated towns of Bosen and Sötern,
 The Imperial Lordship of Dagstuhl with the associated village of Eiweiler,
 The High Court of Neunkirchen including Gonnesweiler, Neunkirchen, and Selbach.

The French Revolution and the following occupation of the entire left bank of the Rhine in 1794 abolished the four lordships. New administrative divisions were created under French rule. The 13 districts of the municipality Nohfelden belonged to the Saar Department and were assigned to five Mairien (mayoralties):

After the defeat of Napoleon in October 1813, France reverted to its boundaries of January 1, 1792 by peace treaty. Among others all communities in present-day Nohfelden were assigned to the newly formed principality of Birkenfeld.

The Principality of Birkenfeld was divided into the three districts Birkenfeld, Oberstein, and Nohfelden. Each district comprised 3 mayoralties (Bürgermeisterei). The district of Nohfelden consisted of three mayoralties: Nohfelden, Neunkirchen, and Achtelsbach.

In 1819 the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg named the territory it had received adjacent to the Principality of Birkenfeld as the Principality of Lichtenberg, based in Sankt Wendel, however, it was already ceded to the Kingdom of Prussia. The Principality of Birkenfeld was now completely surrounded by the Prussian Rhine Province.

As a result of the abdication and the renunciation of the succession to the throne of Frederick Augustus II, Grand Duke of Oldenburg on November 11, 1918, the Principality became the Birkenfeld district of the Rhine Province. The Saar region was separated from Germany and now administered by France.

In 1935 the Saar was reunited with the German Reich under the name "Saarland", once again shuffling the administrative areas.

The end of the Second World War in 1945 ushered in another substantial reorganization. Bosen, Eckelhausen, Eisen, Eiweiler, Gonnesweiler, Hirstein, Mosberg-Richweiler, Neunkirchen, Schwarzenbach, Selbach, Sötern, Steinberg-Deckenhardt, Türkismühle, and Walhausen were assigned to the new "Amt" Türkismühle in the Sankt Wendel district. In the joint meeting the mayors of all the towns, with the exception of Hirstein, supported the establishment of a new administrative grouping headquartered in Türkismühle, in the absence of suitable facilities for the temporary administrative headquarters in Gonnesweiler. Due to its geographic location Hirstein preferred a connection to the Namborn. In 1947 the municipality of Hirstein was spun off from the district of Türkismühle and incorporated into the administrative district of Namborn.

With the Restructuring Act of 1973, the formerly independent communities were united. The legal successor of the Nohfelden Amt was the municipality (Gemeinde) of Nohfelden with the 13 districts: Bosen, Eckelhausen, Eisen, Eiweiler, Gonnesweiler, Mosberg-Richweiler, Neunkirchen, Nohfelden, Selbach, Sötern, Türkismühle, Walhausen and Wolfersweiler.
