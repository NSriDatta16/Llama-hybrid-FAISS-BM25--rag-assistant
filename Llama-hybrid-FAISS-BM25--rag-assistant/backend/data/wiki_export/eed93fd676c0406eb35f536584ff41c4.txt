History

KHSC originally appeared as KHST on channel 66, then later as KHSC-LP on channel 38, before moving to channel 16. It was originally affiliated with the Home Shopping Network.

The KHSC calls were originally used by a full-power Los Angeles HSN O&O station on channel 46 from the mid-1980s until 2002, when it was sold to Univision and became Telefutura (now UniMÃ¡s) O&O KFTR-TV.

The station became digital in 2014 and the HSN affiliation was moved to the fourth digital subchannel of sister station KGMC (channel 43).
