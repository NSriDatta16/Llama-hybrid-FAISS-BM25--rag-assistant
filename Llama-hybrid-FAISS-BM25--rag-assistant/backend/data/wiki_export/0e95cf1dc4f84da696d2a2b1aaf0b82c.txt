Hadi Rani was a Queen from Rajasthan. She was a daughter of Hada Chauhan Rajput married to Ratan Singh, a Chundawat chieftain of Salumbar in Mewar who sacrificed herself to motivate her husband to go to a battle.

According to the legend, when Raj Singh I (1653â€“1680) of Mewar called Ratan Singh to join the rebellion against Mughal governor of Ajmer Subah, the commander, having married only a few days earlier.  He asked his wife, Hadi Rani, for some memento to take with him to the battlefield. Thinking that she was an obstacle to his doing his duty for Mewar, she cut off her head and put it on a plate. A servant covered it with a cloth and presented it to her husband. Devastated but nevertheless proud, the commander tied the memento around his neck by its hair and after their rebellion ended, he got to his knees and cut his neck, having lost the desire to live.
