The Best of Billie (originally known as The Very Best of Billie Piper) is a compilation album by British pop singer Billie Piper. It was released by EMI Gold on 8 August 2005 following Piper's high-profile return to the public eye in Doctor Who. The compilation contained Piper's single releases as well as B-sides. The compilation was released as a budget album in the United Kingdom, and therefore was ineligible to chart. However it did manage to peak at Number 41 on the UK Budget Albums Chart.
