The Beary (also known as Byari) are a community concentrated along the southwest coast of India, mostly in the Mangalore district of the south Indian state of Karnataka.

The Beary community of Tulunadu is one among the earliest Muslim inhabitants of India, with a clear history of more than 950 years.

Etymology
The word Beary is said to be derived from the Tulu word Byara, which means trade or business. Since the major portion of the community was involved in business activities, particularly trading, the local Tulu-speaking majority called them as Beary or Byari.

Another popular theory is that the word Beary comes from Arabic word Bahar (Arabic: بحر).  Bahar means ocean and Bahri (Arabic: بحري) means sailor or navigator. It is said that the Beary community had trade relations with Arab businessmen travelling to Coastal South India, especially the coastline of Tulunadu Malabar. Inscriptions have been found in Barkur that prove Arab trade links with Tulunadu.

A third theory says that the word Beary is derived from the root word Malabar. The Islamic Da'ee, Malik bin Deenar, had arrived on the coast of Malabar during the 7th century with a group of Da'ees, or Islamic propagators. A member from his group, Habeeb bin Malik travelled through Tulunadu and preached Islam. He had also built Mosques in Kasaragod, Mangalore and Barkur.

Other sources
Ahmed Noori, a journalist and himself a member of the Beary community, claimed that there are several documents available which suggest that at least 90 years prior to the invasion of Muhammad bin Qasim in North India, Arab Muslim businessmen were thriving in the South India. This would prove that Islam was prevalent in South India much before Muslim conquerors came to North India.

Noori disputes the claim that the first Muslims came to India along with Alauddin Khalji between 1296 and 1316 AD and points out that according to historian Henry Miers Elliot, writing in 1867, the first ship bearing Muslim travellers was seen on the Indian coast as early as 630 CE. Noori also notes that Hugh George Rawlinson (1913) claimed the first Arab Muslims settled on the Indian coast in the last part of the 7th century and that Bartholomew also has similar things to say about the early Muslim settlers in India, while J. Sturrock (1894) said that Parsi and Arab businessmen settled in different places of the Malabar coast during the 7th century. Noori has quoted these and other sources to validate his argument that the Arab and other settlers came to India much before the Arab, Turk and Afghan conquerors came to North India.

Language

The dialect spoken by Beary (Byaris), is known as Beary Bashe.
While Muslims of Uttara Kannada, called Nawayaths, speak a dialect of Konkani, and the Mappilas of Kerala speak Malayalam (Mappila Malayalam), the Bearys spoke a language made of Malayalam idioms with Tulu phonology and grammar.
This dialect was traditionally known as Mappila Malayalam because of Bearys close contact with Mappilas.
Due to vast influence of Tulu for centuries, it is today considered as a language, close to Malayalam and Tulu.

World Beary Convention
In April 2006, The World Beary Convention was held in Dubai under the banner World Beary Sammelana & Chammana 2006. A similar event was held in 2010.

Ornaments
The beary women have a love of ornaments and use them on occasions such as Mangila, Sunnat Mangila, Appate Mangila, Birnd, Moilanji and other social gatherings. There were different types of ornaments used by the Beary community in past which is at the verge of vanishing today due to the cultural invasion and urbanisation. These ornaments are made out of mainly gold and silver and used for the ornamentation of head, ears, neck, waist, wrist, fingers and feet. Beary research scholars are of the opinion that Beary ornaments were largely influenced by Jain ornament patterns. The ornament storage box used by Bearys was made out of brass and other metals was also used by Jain community and was called Kharjana by both Bearys and Jains.

Cuisine

Beary cuisine is highly influenced by the South Indian cuisine. Just like Mangalorean cuisine it uses a lot of coconut, curry leaves, ginger, chilli and spices like pepper and cardamom. Beary cuisine includes a type of biryani which is very different from types made elsewhere. Rice preparations, both fresh and dry fish, meat and eggs feature in Beary daily menus.
