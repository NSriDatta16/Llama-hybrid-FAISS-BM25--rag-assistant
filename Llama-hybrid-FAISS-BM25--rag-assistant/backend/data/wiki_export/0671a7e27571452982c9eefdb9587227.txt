Bearley railway station  serves the village of Bearley in South Warwickshire, England. It is on the Leamingtonâ€“Stratford line. Today it is an unstaffed rural halt, managed by West Midlands Railway.

Bearley was once a junction station (a branch line to Alcester met the Stratford-upon-Avon to Hatton line here). The station dates from 1860, when it opened as part of the Stratford on Avon Railway's Hatton to Stratford branch line  - the Alcester branch was added in 1876, but this closed in 1951.  Originally a single track station, the line was doubled in 1939 and a second platform built; it reverted to its current status in 1969 when the line was reduced to single track once more.
