Edward Ernest "Eddie" Malin (23 October 1894 in Stoke Newington, London – 1 March 1977 in Ealing, London) was an English actor.

He was the youngest of seven children of John Malin (1850–1921), a purse maker in a fancy leather works, and Martha née Hackworthy (1855–1905). In 1911 aged 16 he was working as a tracer in a boiler works. During World War I he served in the Royal Navy, and became a Freemason in the Antioch Lodge No. 3271 in February 1918.

Malin mostly played in small, often uncredited roles in both film and TV, including as a dining saloon steward in the 1958 film A Night to Remember, as well as a waiter in the seminal 1964 film A Hard Day's Night, starring The Beatles. He achieved most of his fame as the mute and geriatric character of Walter Tattersall in the sitcom Nearest and Dearest from 1969 to 1973.

Edward Malin died on 1 March 1977, aged 82 at the King Edward Memorial hospital in Ealing, London. He had been resident at the actors' retirement home of Denville Hall, Northwood, Middlesex, for several years.
