The yellow-bellied fantail (Chelidorhynx hypoxanthus), also known as the yellow-bellied fairy-fantail, is found in the Indian subcontinent, the Himalayas, and portions of Southeast Asia including Thailand, Vietnam, and Myanmar.  It is about 8Â cm in size.  It is yellow below and has a black eye-stripe, white wing-bar and broad black tail tipped white.

It used to be placed in the family of the fantails (Rhipiduridae), but DNA analysis has shown it to be a close relative of the fairy flycatcher and it has therefore been transferred to the Stenostiridae (IOC World Bird List), in the revalidated monotypic genus Chelidorhynx.
