Mauro Darío Jesús Cetto (born April 14, 1982 in Rosario) is an Argentine retired footballer who played as a defender. He lastly worked as the sporting director of Rosario Central.

Career
Cetto won the 2001 FIFA World Youth Championship with the Argentina Under-20 team. He moved to France in 2002, spending five seasons with FC Nantes before to become a mainstay at Toulouse FC, where he played from 2007 to 2011.

In June 2011 he accepted to join Serie A club Palermo on a free transfer. His Italian experience turned out to be unfortunate in his first season, as Matías Silvestre and Giulio Migliaccio (a central midfielder adapted as a centre back) were preferred to him as starting centre backs. On January 26, 2012 he was sent on loan to Lille until the end of the season, with an option for the team from Northern France to sign him permanently.

Cetto returned to Palermo after Lille opted not to acquire the player permanently, and was called up for the summer pre-season camp where he met new head coach Giuseppe Sannino, who then decided to keep him in the rosanero team for the 2012–13 season. As a result, he played the full 90 minutes (pairing with youngster Milan Milanović) in the first competitive game of the season, a 3–1 win against Cremonese.

On Thursday, January 24, 2013, San Lorenzo de Almagro from Argentina, a Primera A team, signed Mauro Cetto for 2 and a half years.

Mauro Cetto holds both Argentine and Italian nationality.
