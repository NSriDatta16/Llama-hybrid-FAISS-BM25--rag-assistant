Critical reception 
Paul Cooper of Pitchfork gave the single a positive review, writing "I have to wonder if 'King of Snake' is such a smoking choon that nobody--not even that geezer from Adamski--could screw it up. At the moment, unfortunately, these are important singles and consequently about nine dollars apiece. But I assure you, while you might find pretenders of the throne, there is only the one King of Snake."
