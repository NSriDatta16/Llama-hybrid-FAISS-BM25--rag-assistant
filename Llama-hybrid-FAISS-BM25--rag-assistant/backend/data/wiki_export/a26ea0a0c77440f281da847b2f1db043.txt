Etymology
The name Kalamassery is derived from Kalabhasery. In Malayalam, a word can have multiple meanings: in common usage "kalabham" means yellow sandalwood paste, and in literary Malayalam, it can mean Elephant. Kalabhasery, a location near HMT, was where elephants from Thrikkakara Temple was taken for rest after celebrations at the temple. During the course of time Kalabhasery became Kalamassery. Historically, the prominent area was called Njalakam, place with a prominent Juma Masjid, but during the time of creation of Kalamassery Panchayat which includes Njalakam, it was decided to name the area Kalamassery instead of Njalakam due to the growth of Kalamassery. A primary driver of growth was the nearby Fertilisers and Chemicals Travancore Limited (FACT) in Udyogamandal. Employees of FACT would regularly visit Kalamassery for shopping and other purposes. Many settled down in Kalamassery after retirement in places like Santhinagar and Santhinagar Annexe. This growth was brought about by new industries like HMT in that area. Later, the rapid growth of Kalamassery led to it being promoted to a Municipality.
