After Faith Hope and Charity, her musical career included being the vocalist for electronic music group Xpansions whose major techno hit single Move Your Body (Elevation) reached Number 7 in 1991.

In addition to her musical career, she is a freelance voiceover artiste who does work for GCap Media and EMAP radio, as well as the Tindle Radio Group.
