Black Love is the fifth album by the band the Afghan Whigs, released in March 1996. It was released by Elektra Records/Sub Pop in the US and by Mute in Europe, and was produced by Greg Dulli. Black Love was preceded by the single "Honky's Ladder" and followed by the single "Going to Town" (also released as the Bonnie & Clyde EP in the US).

Prior to this album's release, lead singer Greg Dulli seriously explored producing a movie in the film noir genre, but despite his optioning at least one book,  the movie was never made. Dulli's ideas for a soundtrack led to the songs recorded on this album.

The album was reissued on November 25, 2016, on Rhino Records, in celebration of the 20th anniversary of its initial release. The 20th anniversary reissue was released as a double CD and triple LP, and includes nine previously-unreleased tracks.

Critical reception

Upon its initial release, Black Love received mixed reviews from critics, who generally considered it inferior to its predecessor Gentlemen. In recent years, the album has been regarded as one of the best albums in the band's oeuvre, with Stereogum labeling it their best album in a "Worst to Best" list.
