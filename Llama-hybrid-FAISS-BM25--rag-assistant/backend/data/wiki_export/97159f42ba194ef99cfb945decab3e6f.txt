Plot
Sentimientos Ajenos is the story of Sofía, a sweet young painter who falls in love with Renato with no idea that her love would release a tide of hatred from her own sister. Leonor will let nothing keep her from her goal of preventing their marriage and failing that, she tries a million ways to steal her sister's husband, something which sends their father to his grave. Up to her tricks, Leonor seduces an impetuous and passionate young man while masquerading as Sofia.
