Parliamentary elections were held in Hungary on 10 May 1998, with a second round of voting in 175 of the 176 single member constituencies on 24 May.

Although the Hungarian Socialist Party received the most votes, the then-liberal conservative Fidesz won the most seats. The successful breakthrough into parliament by the extreme right-wing Hungarian Justice and Life Party was also a major shock. After the election, Fidesz formed a centre-right coalition government with the Independent Smallholders Party and Hungarian Democratic Forum.

Results

Party list results by county

In the Hungarian parliamentary election system in force between 1990 and 2010, if the number of valid votes cast in the 1st round in a county did not reach 50% of all voters, then the list voting had to be repeated in the 2nd round in that county. The only example of this was in the 1998 parliamentary election, when in the first round in Hajdú-Bihar County and Szabolcs-Szatmár-Bereg County, the proportion of valid votes in the proportion of all voters did not reach 50%.
