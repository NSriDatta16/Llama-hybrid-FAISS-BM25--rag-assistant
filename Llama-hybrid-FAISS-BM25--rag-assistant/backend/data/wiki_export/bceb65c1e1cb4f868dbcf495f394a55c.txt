In 1824, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada for Norfolk; he was reelected in 1828 and 1830. In the assembly, he lobbied for the replacement of the jail and courthouse at Vittoria after a fire and the construction of a lighthouse at Long Point. He served as a justice of the peace and was also a member of the local militia. He died in York in 1832 after suffering a fever for several days.
