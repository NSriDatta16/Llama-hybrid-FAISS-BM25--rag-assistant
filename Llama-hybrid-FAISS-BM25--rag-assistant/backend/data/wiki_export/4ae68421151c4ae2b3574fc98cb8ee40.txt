Geography
Kořenov is located about  east of Jablonec nad Nisou, on the border with Poland. It lies in the Jizera Mountains and in the eponymous protected landscape area.

History
The first settlers came to the remote forested area in northern Bohemia in 1577 when Paul Schürer von Walthaimb established one of the oldest glassworks in the region at Rejdice. The glassworks operated until 1720. After the 1620 Battle of White Mountain, the lands were seized by Albrecht von Wallenstein, who sold them to the comital Desfours dynasty. In the 18th century, German colonists came to this region. The estates were acquired by the noble House of Rohan in 1824.

In 1902, the Tanvald–Kořenov cog railway connecting to the electrified Izera railway line running to Silesian Hirschberg (present-day Jelenia Góra) was put into operation. Until 1918, Bohemian Unter Wurzelsdorf belonged to the Cisleithanian part of Austria-Hungary, in the Bezirk (district) of Gablonz (now Jablonec nad Nisou), one of 94 Bohemian Bezirkshauptmannschaften.

The German-speaking population was expelled after 1945.

The municipality was established in 1960 by the merger of the former market towns of Polubný and Příchovice with Rejdice and Jizerka. Kořenov was only an administrative part of Polubný, however the new municipality adopted its name.

Part of Kořenov, the former hamlet of Údolí Naděje (Hoffnungstal, ), belonged to Poland between 1945 and 1958. As part of the interstate agreement on territorial exchange, the territory then fell to Czechoslovakia.
