Lake Santa Giustina
Lake Santa Giustina is an artificial lake which was created by the dike on the creek Noce. The dam was completed in 1950, is 152 metres high and it was the highest dam in Europe at the time. The lake can contain up to about 180 million cubic metres water, which feeds the turbines of the hydroelectric plant in Taio.
The lake is named after the location where the dam is placed, which in turn is named after an ancient hermitage of which only ruins are left, covered by a natural hollow of the rock.

Tabula clesiana
The Tabula clesiana is a bronze plate measuring  that was discovered in 1869 at Campi Neri in Cles. It contains the edict of Caesar Claudius of 46 AD, which granted Roman citizenship to the Alpine peoples of the Anauni, Sinduni and Tulliasses. It is kept at the Castello del Buonconsiglio Museum in Trento.

The Tabula is an important evidence of the rapid assimilation by the Roman world of the Alpine peoples of farmers-hunters; but also from the point of view of the Roman law the first evidence of the introduction of delatores in the fiscal controversy.
