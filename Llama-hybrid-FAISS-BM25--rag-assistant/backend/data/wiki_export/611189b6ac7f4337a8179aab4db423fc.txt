History
A school has existed at Portree since the 17th century. However it closed in 1825 due to the difficulty in finding a new qualified schoolmaster. Construction on the Portree High School buildings began in 1872. In 1905 it became a Higher Grade school. Margaret Carnegie Hostel for girls being opened in 1924, followed in 1933 by the Elgin Hostel for boys. Elgin Hostel is now a Category B listed building.

Until late 2008, the school consisted of three buildings - the main building, the Elgin Hostel and the Technical Block, along with about a dozen demountable classrooms. In 2008, this arrangement was replaced by a new building, constructed by Morrison Construction as part of a regional PPP scheme to build eleven schools in the Highlands. The demountable classrooms were then removed, and the main building and Technical Block demolished.

Curriculum
Students take a range of curricular subjects in the Broad General Education (S1-S3) and a wide range of subjects at N4/5, Higher and AH level. The school's curriculum includes provision for Gaelic medium education. The school works in partnership with the West Highland College and Sabhal Mor Ostaig to offer a wide range of vocational subjects and Foundation Apprenticeships.  The new school was built in 2008, and officially opened in 2010.  The current Head Teacher, Tony Breen, was appointed in 2021.
