CPN Radio () was a Peruvian radio broadcaster with national coverage in Peru. It was founded in 1996. Early in the decade of 2000 was the main competitor of RPP (Radio Programas del Per√∫), but declined at the end of the decade. Finally, because of economic problems radio ownership changed, but failed to get solvent. Following those circumstances was forced to stop broadcasting in 2011 and was replaced by a romantic music station.
