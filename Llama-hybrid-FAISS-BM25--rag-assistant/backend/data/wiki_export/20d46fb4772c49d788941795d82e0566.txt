Australia

In Australia, the 1992 National Forest Policy Statement (NFPS) made specific provision for the protection of old growth forests. The NFPS initiated a process for undertaking assessments of forests for conservation values, including old growth values. A working group of state and Australian Government agencies took the NFPS definition into consideration in developing a definition that was accepted by all governments (JANIS 1997). 

In 2008, only a relatively small area (15%) of Australia's forests (mostly tall, wet forests) had been assessed for old-growth values.

Of the  of forest in Australia assessed for their old-growth status,  (22%) is classified as old-growth. Almost half of Australia's identified old-growth forest is in NSW, mostly on public land. More than 73% of Australia's identified old-growth forests are in formal or informal nature conservation reserves.

In 2001, Western Australia became the first state in Australia to cease logging in old-growth forests.

The term "old-growth forests" is rarely used in New Zealand, instead, "The Bush" is used to refer to native forests. There are large contiguous areas of forest cover that are protected areas.
