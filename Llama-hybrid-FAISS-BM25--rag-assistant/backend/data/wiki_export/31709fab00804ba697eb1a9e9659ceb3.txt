Dale Dwight Douglass (March 5, 1936 – July 6, 2022) was an American professional golfer who won tournaments at both the PGA Tour and the Champions Tour level.

Douglass was born in Wewoka, Oklahoma. He grew up in Fort Morgan, Colorado, where graduated from high school in 1956.  Douglass graduated from University of Colorado in 1959, turned pro in 1960, and joined the PGA Tour in 1963. He played on the 1969 Ryder Cup team.

Douglass won three times and earned $573,351 in just under 25 years on the PGA Tour. His best finish in a major championship was T-13 at the 1969 U.S. Open. His fortunes improved dramatically when he reached the age of 50 and joined the Senior PGA Tour (now known as the PGA Tour Champions). In this venue, Douglass had 11 wins including the 1986 U.S. Senior Open and accumulated approximately $7 million in earnings.

Douglass lived in Paradise Valley, Arizona. He died in Scottsdale, Arizona, on July 6, 2022, at the age of 86.
