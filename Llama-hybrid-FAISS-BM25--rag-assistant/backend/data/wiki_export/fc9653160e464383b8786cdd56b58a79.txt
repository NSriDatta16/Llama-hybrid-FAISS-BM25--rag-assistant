Anarchic Adjustment was a fashion clothing company founded in 1986 by British clothing designer Nick Philip. It initially focused on skate punk wear but later, operating in San Francisco, California, became known for its rave fashion, such as T-shirts featuring aliens, UFOs, or MDMA-inspired slogans like "open your mind."

Anarchic Adjustment opened two fashion shops in Japan, one opened in Tokyo in 1994, west of Ebisu station and a second store in the American Village in Osaka inside the American Village Parco Store. Alan Brown, along with Joi Ito were responsible for founding the Anarchic stores in Japan.

Hiroshi Fujiwara, DJ, Mixmaster Morris, Towa Tei of Deelite, and Timothy Leary were early adopters of Anarchic Adjustment fashion. 
Hiroshi featured "Anarchic" in his Fujiwara Adjustment section of Cutie Magazine and Timothy Leary wore "Anarchic" whenever he could.
