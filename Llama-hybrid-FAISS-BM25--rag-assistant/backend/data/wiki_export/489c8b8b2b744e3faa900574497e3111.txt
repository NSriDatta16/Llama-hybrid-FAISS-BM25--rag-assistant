Topography

It is composed of two sub-divisions; Gulistan and Chaman. The general character of the district is mountainous. Its northern area is covered by the Toba Plateau. The hill ranges are fairly uniform in character. They consist of long central ridges with numerous spurs. These spurs vary in elevation from 1,500 to 3,300 metres.

Soil 
Kila Abdullah is a small valley bordered by mountains. The valley floor is covered with unconsolidated alluvial sediments that are mostly composed of clay, silt, silty clay and clayey silt. All these sediments were deposited in the valley by the seasonal streams that flow across the valley (generally north to south). The soil is of loamy nature in the Gulistan area, while the soil of Tehsil Chaman is sandy clay—gravel (admixture). The sandy fraction increases towards the mountain ranges. The scarcity of water in the area and the semi-desert climatic conditions have limited trees and shrubs to grow.

In 1993, it was separated from Pishin for administrative reasons and was given the status of a district.
