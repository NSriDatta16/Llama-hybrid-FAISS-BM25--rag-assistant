In organic chemistry, indoxyl is a nitrogenous substance with the chemical formula: C8H7NO. Indoxyl is isomeric with oxindol and is obtained as an oily liquid.

Indoxyl is obtained from indican, which is a glycoside. The hydrolysis of indican yields Î²-D-glucose and indoxyl.

Indigo dye is a product of the reaction of indoxyl with a mild oxidizing agent such as atmospheric oxygen.

Indoxyl can be found in urine and is titrated with Obermayer's reagent, which is a dilute solution of ferric chloride (FeCl3) in hydrochloric acid (HCl).
