Kenny Roby is a singer-songwriter based in North Carolina.  He was the former lead singer of 6 String Drag, which he formed with an old friend, bassist Rob Keller, in the early 1990s, becoming a part of the era's so-called Americana movement. The band's style ranged from old-style country with a hint of soul and gospel to rock. While 6 String Drag broke up in the late 1990s, Roby continues to make records and play live shows with the Mercy Filter, which includes Scott McCall of $2 Pistols. In 2013, Roby released the album Memories & Birds, which he described as "almost a concept album". In 2015, Roby reunited with the original members of 6 String Drag and released Roots Rock 'N' Roll, which Roby describes with "[the songs] kind of lent themselves to a 50’s and 60’s style."  Roby's latest album is The Reservoir, released in 2020.  The website Americana UK called the album "A sparse, personal narrative built on pain, loss, and the hardships of life."
