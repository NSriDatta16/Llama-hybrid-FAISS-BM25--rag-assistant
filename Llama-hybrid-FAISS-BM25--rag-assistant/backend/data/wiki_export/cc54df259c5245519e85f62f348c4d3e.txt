Canberra Commercial Development Authority 

The CCDA was an authority formed in October 1974 for the purpose of developing and managing the proposed Belconnen Mall. At the time Canberra had two major shopping centres, namely the Monaro Mall, and the Woden Town Centre, and it was decided that the north of Canberra needed a similar shopping centre. Rather than utilising private industry to build the mall, it was decided that the government should operate it to prevent the formation of monopolies.

Shortly after the opening of the mall in 1978, it was identified in a review of Commonwealth Functions conducted by Minister for Industry and Commerce Phillip Lynch as a potential privatisation target, and it was announced by Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser that the authority would be abolished and the mall sold. This, however, did not happen for many years due to the government's dissatisfaction with the offers it had received. Furthermore in 1983 there was a suggestion that the authorities responsibilities would be widened to include a new shopping centre development in Erindale. This never came to fruition, and a bid for the mall was accepted in 1985, with the authority being abolished the next year. The mall was bought for A$87 million by a joint venture between Westfield and the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund Investment Trust
