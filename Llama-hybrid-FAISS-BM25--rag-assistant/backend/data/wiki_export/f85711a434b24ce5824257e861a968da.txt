Ethan Allen Andrews (April 7, 1787 – March 4, 1858) was an American lexicographer and educator. He published a major Latin dictionary in 1850 and served in the Connecticut House of Representatives in 1851 and was a Whig.

Life
Andrews was born in New Britain, Connecticut, and graduated at Yale in 1810. He practiced law for several years, then (1822–1828) was professor of ancient languages at the University of North Carolina, after which he taught at New Haven and Boston. He married Lucy Cowles Andrews, with whom he had one son, Horace.

He died on March 4, 1858, in New Britain.

Works
He published a number of Latin textbooks and in 1850 a Latin-English lexicon, a reduced version of Wilhelm Freund's German translation of Egidio Forcellini's 1771 dictionary, which became known as Andrews' Lexicon. It went through many revisions and came to be known as Harper's Latin Dictionary (1907). He published a Latin grammar with his Yale classmate Solomon Stoddard, long very popular.  A monograph, Slavery and the Domestic Slave Trade in the United States, was printed in Boston in 1836. Other publications  include "First Latin Book"; "Latin Reader"; "Viri Romae"; "Latin Lessons"; "Andrews' and Stoddard's Latin Grammar"; "Synopsis of Latin Grammar"; "Questions on the Latin Grammar"; "Latin Exercises"; "Key to Latin Exercises"; "Exercises in Latin Etymology"; "Caesar's Commentaries"; "Sallust"; and "Ovid".
