Between Hollywood Road and Staunton Street, a large terrace at the street east erects two former staff quarters of Hong Kong Police Force built in 1950s, which have been converted into PMQ. The terrace was constructed for the old campus of Queen's College earlier, the largest building in Hong Kong at the time.

In 2018, Hong Kong highway officials put anti-skid coating on 100 steps along Shing Wong Street. After public backlash and criticism that the coating would destroy the historic steps, it was removed in early 2019.
