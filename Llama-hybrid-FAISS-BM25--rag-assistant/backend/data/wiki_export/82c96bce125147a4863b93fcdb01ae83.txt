Rauceby railway station is a station near the town of Sleaford, Lincolnshire, England, lying close to the western border of the Parish of Old Sleaford and Quarrington just over half-a-mile south of the village of South Rauceby.

History
The railway station originally served Rauceby Mental Hospital (the former Kesteven Lunatic Asylum, which lies immediately to the south of the railway station and was closed in 1998) and the village of South Rauceby in Lincolnshire, England. The line was built by the Boston, Sleaford and Midland Counties Railway. It now principally serves commuters living in the new housing estates that comprise the Greylees suburb of Sleaford.

The former leader of the Liberal Democrat Party, Nick Clegg, proposed to his wife on a platform at the station.

The station is now owned by Network Rail and managed by East Midlands Railway, which provides all rail services.

A local road crosses the line at the western edge of the platforms, where a signal box and manually operated crossing gates can be seen.
