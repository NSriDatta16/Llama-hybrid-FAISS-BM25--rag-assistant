Terre Haute South Vigo High is a consolidation of Terre Haute William H. Wiley High School (1912-1971) and Honey Creek High School (1926-1971). Honey Creek was involved in earlier consolidations as Blackhawk High (1919–71), Pimento High (1919–61), Prairie Creek High (1917–61), Prairieton High (1924–27) were consolidated into Honey Creek.  Wiley itself was the second high school in Terre Haute, opening in 1912.
After its founding, North added students from Terre Haute State High (a 'laboratory school' for Indiana State University) in 1978. The 'lab school' continued to educate elementary students through 1992.
