Reception

Critical
Music website AllMusic awarded the album two out of five stars. Writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted that it "certainly has an audience," but that anyone other than "wrestling nuts ... pretty much knows not to bother in the first place." Alex Ristic of Slam! Wrestling was similarly sceptical, noting that while the album "represents the individual mat stars to a tee," that is "not necessarily a good thing." Ristic criticised tracks such as "Big" and "Sexual Chocolate", although did praise songs including "Break Down the Wall" and "Danger at the Door" and concluded that "the majority of [the material] is quite good."
