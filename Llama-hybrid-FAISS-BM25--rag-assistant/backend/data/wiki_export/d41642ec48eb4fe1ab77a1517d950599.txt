Not long afterwards, Harmer was headlining her own shows at the Last Laugh theatre restaurant, owned by entrepreneur John Pinder, and later by Rick McKenna. The shows included Faking It, Sunburn Bloody Sunburn, and Sunburn the Day After, which included the group from the Flying Trapeze and, among others, Mark Neale, Richard Stubbs, and Steve Vizard.

Harmer's books have been described as being in the genre of chick lit or hen lit. Harmer wrote that the genres were misunderstood for The Age newspaper.

"And if it's all just banal 'women' stuff? If children, marriage, friendship and happiness are just of marginal concern? Pass me the pastel-covered girlie book and break out the chocolate!"  They are popular light novels, and very humorous.

Harmer has also written a series of children's books called the Pearlie the Park Fairy. There are 17 books in the series published to date. They are bestsellers in Australia, and have been published in ten countries around the world. The animated series Pearlie has been shown on Australian, Canadian, and American television, and Harmer adapted the first book in the series, Pearlie in the Park, for the stage. In 2005, this play toured around Australia, performed by the Monkey Baa theatre company.I Lost My Mobile at the Mall (2009) was Harmer's first novel for teens. The sequel was I Made Lattes for a love God in 2012.

In addition to the Pearlie in the Park adaptation, Harmer has written two plays, Backstage Pass and What Is the Matter With Mary Jane? She also wrote the libretto for Baz Luhrmann's Opera Australia production of Lake Lost.

She has written for numerous Australian magazines, and has been a contributing columnist for The Australian Women's Weekly, New Weekly, The Good Weekend, HQ, Sunday Telegraph and Yours magazine.

Television credits
Harmer was the host of the TV series The Big Gig, had her own TV chat show in 1990, In Harmer's Way, and co-starred in the World Series Debate with Andrew Denton from 1993 to 1994. Harmer hosted the Logie Awards of 2002, and was caught up in widespread media criticism of the event, with some focusing on her personal performance. In 2005, Harmer was the subject of an ABC Australian Story episode. Stuff, a four-part television documentary series which Harmer produced, wrote, and presented, premiered on ABC TV in 2008. The same year, Harmer commenced writing for the animated series Pearlie, based on her series of books. Harmer wrote many of the episodes, acted as a creative producer on the series, and even made a cameo appearance as Astrid the Dream Fairy.

Political views

In a 2015 article for The Sydney Morning Herald, Harmer described herself as a "tragic lefty". In a 2013 humorous piece for The Hoopla, she described herself as an "old lefty". Harmer told the ABC Q&A program in November 2015 that her politics sounded "like an old fashioned socialist", that she objected to trends towards privatization of public assets, and that the GST is not fair. In a 2014 piece for the Herald, Harmer cautioned against being too dismissive of opposing political views: "right and left need each other to progress, we should be more humble about our supposedly deeply-held beliefs and not so quick to label our opponents as either carelessly ill-informed or purposefully evil. Although, don't expect any extremist wingnut or idiotic greenie near you to get that any time soon!" Harmer advocated against the election of Republican Donald Trump at the 2016 United States presidential election.

Gender fluidity

Harmer wrote in 2016 that acceptance of "gender fluidity" could be one of the "best things" to happen in her lifetime, and that "I believe, with all my heart, that we exist on a dynamic spectrum of sexuality and that labels are at best useless, at worst tragically destructive."

Abbott-Turnbull government

Following the first Budget of the Abbott government in 2014, Harmer wrote: "The government we have now confounds me. It seems it is oblivious to all advice, evidence and entreaties. I just cannot understand how Joe Hockey has come up with a budget that offers no joy. At all. No carrot, all stick. All punishment and threats. No reward he's able to articulate. No budget emergency that stands up to scrutiny."

Republicanism

In 1993, she participated in a comic debate "Does Australia need the Royal Family", arguing the case for the negative alongside future Liberal leader Malcolm Turnbull and Labor politician Graham Richardson. In October 2015, Harmer tweeted that she is a member of the Australian Republican Movement, and encouraged others to join.

The Greens

Harmer described long term leader of the Australian Greens Bob Brown as "a good man prosecuting the good cause...".

Advocacy
Harmer was one of 28 members of the National People with Disabilities and Careers Council, created to advise the Australian Government on the development of the National Disability Strategy. She was also the ambassador for Interplast.

In 2014, Harmer wrote for The Sydney Morning Herald that her husband is a "dedicated greenie" and "Activism is now the core of our lives. Our kids have grown up behind protest banners."

Religion

In an article written for The Sydney Morning Herald in March 2013, Harmer described herself as "born into an atheist household", but said she attended Church of England Sunday school for a time until her father declared himself "humanist". She wrote in 2016 that her father was "a steadfastly non-religious man, a self-described humanist".

Nevertheless, she wrote, "I've remained deeply attracted to the tale of suffering and resurrection at the heart of the Christian narrative. Endlessly fascinated by accounts of religion, belief, myth, legend and fairytales... I'm one of those pathetic non-believers philosopher Alain de Botton bangs on about. The sad, godless orphans who can't pass a church or temple without entering to light a candle or offer a flower."

In an essay in Destroying The Joint: Why Women Have To Change The World'' edited by Jane Caro, Harmer wrote that her two children have been confirmed into the Catholic Church.

Personal
Harmer is married to Brendan Donohoe and has two children. 
She is a co-founder, of the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles's Angels, the women supporters' group for the local rugby league club.
