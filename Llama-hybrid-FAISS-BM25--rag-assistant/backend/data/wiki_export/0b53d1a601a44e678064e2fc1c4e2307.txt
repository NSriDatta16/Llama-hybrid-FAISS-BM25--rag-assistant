Selenium hexasulfide is a chemical compound with the chemical formula . Its molecular structure consists of a ring of two selenium and six sulfur atoms (diselenacyclooctasulfane), analogous to the  allotrope of sulfur (cyclooctasulfur) and other selenium sulfides with formula .

There are several isomers depending on the relative placement of the selenium atoms in the ring: 1,2-diselenacyclooctasulfane (with the two Se atoms adjacent), 1,3-diselenacyclooctasulfane, 1,4-diselenacyclooctasulfane, and 1,5-diselenacyclooctasulfane (with the Se atoms opposite). It is an oxidizing agent.

The 1,2 isomer can be prepared by reaction of chlorosulfanes and dichlorodiselane with potassium iodide in carbon disulfide. The reaction produces also cyclooctaselenium  and all other eight-member cyclic selenium sulfides, except selenacyclooctasulfane , and several six- and seven-membered rings.
