As a rookie in 2002, Goodman appeared in 14 regular season games including six starts. He missed the team's first two games with an ankle injury. On the year, he had 48 tackles, an interception, 12 passes defensed, a fumble recovery and six special team tackles. He saw his first regular season against the Green Bay Packers on September 22, finishing with four tackles. He had a pass breakup in the end zone and five solo tackles, including one for a loss, in his first career start against the New Orleans Saints the following week. Against the Packers on November 10, Goodman registered two pass breakups and five tackles (four solo) before being forced out of the game with a thumb injury. The injury would force him to wear a cast on his right hand for the rest of the season. Nevertheless, during season finale against the Minnesota Vikings on December 29, Goodman had a career-high nine tackles and also recorded his first career interception on a pass from quarterback Daunte Culpepper.

Goodman started all three games in which he played in 2003, recording 13 tackles and four passes defensed. He suffered a dislocated shoulder against the Minnesota Vikings on September 21, and was placed on season-ending Injured Reserve four days later.

In 2004, Goodman started four of the 11 games in which he played. In the season, he had 23 tackles, an interception, three passes defensed and a forced fumble. He recorded his lone interception in the season opener against the Chicago Bears on September 12, picking off a Rex Grossman pass. However, he also suffered a thigh injury during the game and missed the following five contests. He started the final four games of the season filling in for injured cornerback Fernando Bryant, and recorded five tackles and a forced fumble against the Bears on December 26.

Goodman played in 15 games with eight starts for the Lions in 2005. He had 47 tackles and a career-high three interceptions, a figure which ranked second on the club, and also came up with a fumble recovery, 12 passes defensed and a five special teams tackles. He had a season-high six tackles on four occasions, all within the first two months of the regular season. His first interception of the year came in a 13-10 win over the Cleveland Browns on October 23, when he picked off a Trent Dilfer pass in the fourth quarter to help preserve the victory. Against the Cincinnati Bengals on December 18, he intercepted a Carson Palmer pass and returned it a career-long 21 yards. He intercepted a Ben Roethlisberger throw in the season finale against the Pittsburgh Steelers on January 1, 2006.

Miami Dolphins
After his rookie contract with the Lions expired following the 2005 season, Goodman became an unrestricted free agent. He visited with the Miami Dolphins on March 11 and officially signed with the team on March 13.

Ankle and knee injuries to Dolphins cornerback Travis Daniels allowed Goodman to see significant playing time throughout the season. Goodman started 13 of the 15 games in which he appeared in 2006, accumulating 41 tackles (26 solo), a forced fumble, two fumble recoveries and nine passes defensed. He recovered a Bo Scaife fumble against the Tennessee Titans on September 24 and Justin Gage fumble against the Chicago Bears on November 5. His lone forced fumble came against running back Maurice Jones-Drew and the Jacksonville Jaguars on December 3.

While he did not nab an interception on the year and the Dolphins' secondary struggled as a unit, Goodman was the team's most consistent downfield cover corner in 2006. He suffered a shoulder injury against the New York Jets on December 25, and was placed on season-ending Injured Reserve the following day. It would be the second time during the season a shoulder injury had permanently forced him out of a contest against the rival Jets, with the first such occasion taking place more than two months prior on October 15.

After the 2006 season, Goodman switched jersey numbers with fellow cornerback Travis Daniels. Goodman, who had worn No. 29 during his first season with the Dolphins, switched to No. 21 while Daniels took No. 29.

Goodman's shoulder problems from the previous year plagued him during the 2007 offseason. He underwent arthroscopic debridement on his left shoulder on January 18. After being unable to participate in the team's first May minicamp, Goodman underwent further tests and had more surgery on the shoulder on May 11. On July 23, he was placed on the Physically Unable to Perform list. He finished the season with 20 tackles and two interceptions in 13 games (four starts).

Goodman started all 16 games for the Dolphins in 2008, leading the team and setting a career high with five interceptions. He also recorded 39 tackles and a career-high 19 pass deflections during the season.

On March 1, 2009, Goodman signed a five-year, $20.4 million contract with the Denver Broncos. The deal included $9.8 million guaranteed and Goodman having the potential to earn an additional $4.8 million if he played 75% of the defensive snaps.
