Blue Cathedral is the third studio album by Comets on Fire. It was released in 2004 on the Sub Pop label.

In an interview, Comets on Fire echoplex and electronics player Noel von Harmonson stated that the album cover art for Blue Cathedral was a photograph of an elephant that suffered from a disease causing a lack of pigment in some areas of its skin. In 2007, the album was performed live in its entirety as part of the All Tomorrow's Parties-curated Don't Look Back series.
