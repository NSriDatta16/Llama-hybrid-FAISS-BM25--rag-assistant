Veene Sheshanna (1852â€”1926) was an exponent of the veena, an Indian string instrument, which he played in the classical Carnatic music style. He was a concert musician at the court of the princely state of Mysore in southern India, but his performances were admired throughout Eurasia, including by King George V, who held a portrait of him at the Buckingham Palace.

Family
Veene Sheshanna was born in Mysore in 1852 into a family of celebrated classical musicians.

Musical style
Until the late 19th century, the veena would be held vertically as while being played. Not unlike the sitar, the gourd would rest in the lap of the player, who would sit cross-legged while performing. Sheshanna established a new convention by keeping the veena in a horizontal position while playing it.

Sheshanna seems to be the originator of what is now the known as the Mysore style of playing the veena.

Contributions
Sheshanna composed 53 pieces of music, including Swarajatis, Padas, Javalis and many Tillanas. He had a deep understanding of Hindustani music as well. His thillanas in the ragas Behag and Darbari Kannada are proof of this.

One of the Sheshanna's most beloved concert veenas as well as Raja Ravi Varma's famous portrait of him can be viewed at the Manjusha Museum, a conservatory of historical artefacts in Dharmasthala, Karnataka.
