Aguiguan (also Aguigan and Aguihan, based on the Spanish rendition of the native name, Aguijan, which is still used), alternatively it is called Goat Island, is a small bean-shaped uninhabited coralline island in the Northern Mariana Islands chain in the Pacific Ocean. It is situated  south-west of Tinian, from which it is separated by the Tinian Channel. Aguiguan and neighboring Tinian Island together form Tinian Municipality, one of the four main political divisions that comprise the Northern Marianas. The island is inhabited by wild goats and the last known habitat of a rare Pacific bat, as well as many species of birds. During WW2 a Japanese garrision was on the island, which surrendered at the end of the War without a battle. The island does not have natural harbor so its difficult to land on.

History

It is likely that first sighting by Europeans occurred during the Spanish expedition of Ferdinand Magellan, or by its continuation by Gonzalo Gómez de Espinosa being charted as Santo Ángel. It was visited by the Spanish missionary Diego Luis de San Vitores in 1669.

In the mid-19th century it was known that goats were introduced to the island. In the 1930s there was an attempt to grow sugar cane here, and areas were cleared for this purpose.

Aguiguan was administered as part of the Spanish Mariana Islands from the 16th century to 1899, when the Northern Marianas were sold by Spain to the German Empire. Under Germany, it was administered as part of German New Guinea. During World War I, Aguiguan came under the control of the Empire of Japan and was administered as part of the South Seas Mandate. During World War II, the Imperial Japanese Army maintained a garrison on Aguiguan. This garrison is noteworthy because of its surrender to Allied forces September 4, 1945, two days after the surrender of Japan. The surrender was unique as it was the only surrender hosted by a U.S. Coast Guard Cutter, the USCG 83525. US Navy Admiral Marshall R. Greer received the surrender of the Japanese Second Lieutenant Kinichi Yamada.

Following World War II, Aguiguan came under the control of the United States and was administered as part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. Since 1978, the island has been part of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, which along with the rest of the CNMI became part of the United States in the late 20th century.

In modern times the island is called Aguijan Island or Aguigan, or it also goes by Goat island. It is known for its population of feral goats, but is also the last known habitat for the Pacific sheath-tailed bat (Emballonura semicaudata rotensis). Currently the known to have over 1000 feral goats which have lived there for about two centuries. In addition, there is many species of bird that live on the island.

Geography

Aguiguan is only  in size, with a length of  and a width of . It is nicknamed “Goat Island” due to the large number of feral goats present there. Despite the goats the island is mix of forest and fields, and home to many species native to Marianas especially some rare bird species.

The island has an area of about 7.3 km2 and is uninhabited but visited periodically. It has no natural harbor, bay, or beaches, so it is difficult for boats to land on.

Aguiguan is uninhabited and is seldom visited because it is surrounded by sheer steep cliffs. However, a 2002 survey of the island did find a handful of native species there, including the Mariana fruit bat, the Polynesian sheath-tailed bat and the Micronesian megapode Megapodius laperouse.

The Tastumi fishing bank is in this area.

Naftan Rock

Approximately  off the south-west shore of Aguiguan is Naftan Rock,  in elevation.

Important Bird Area
Aguiguan and Naftan Rock have been recognised as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because they support populations of Micronesian megapodes, white-throated ground doves, Mariana fruit doves, Mariana swiftlets, Micronesian myzomelas, rufous fantails, Aguiguan reed warblers, golden and Saipan white-eyes, and Micronesian starlings. Aguiguan also supports seabird breeding colonies, with 120 pairs of brown boobies and 450 pairs of brown noddies reported, while Naftan Rock is home to several thousand seabirds.
