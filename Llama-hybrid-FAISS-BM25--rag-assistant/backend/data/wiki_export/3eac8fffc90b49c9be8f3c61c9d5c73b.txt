Arthur Corbin Gould (1850â€“1903) was an author, avid shooter and member of the Massachusetts Rifle Association. He published The Rifle [Riling 1160] in 1885. After Gould's death, The Rifle was acquired as an official publication of the National Rifle Association of America becoming American Rifleman. Mr. Gould also authored The Modern American Pistol and Revolver, including a description of modern pistols and revolvers of American make; ammunition used in these arms; results accomplished; and shooting rules followed by American marksmen as well as Modern American Rifles. The former was the first English-language book devoted to pistol shooting.
