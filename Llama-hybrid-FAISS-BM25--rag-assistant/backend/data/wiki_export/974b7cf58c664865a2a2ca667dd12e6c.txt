Alfred Barry (15 January 18261 April 1910) was the third Bishop of Sydney serving 1884–1889. Over the course of his career, Barry served as headmaster of independent schools, Principal of King's College London university and founded Anglican schools such as Shore School. He officiated at the funeral of Charles Darwin in 1882.

Life
He was born in Ely Place, Holborn in London, the son of the eminent architect, Sir Charles Barry and Sarah Rowsell, and had four brothers; Charles Barry (junior), Edward Middleton Barry, John Wolfe-Barry and Godfrey Barry.

From King's College School, he went to Trinity College, Cambridge (B.A., 1848; M.A., 1851), where his performance as 4th Wrangler (aeq.) and 7th Classic won him a minor fellowship and a Smith's prize. In 1850 he became a major fellow and was made deacon in the Church of England by Bishop Thomas Turton of Ely; Bishop Wilberforce of Oxford ordained him priest in 1853. He continued with divinity studies (B.D., 1860; D.D., 1866). Oxford gave him an honorary DCL in 1870, as did Durham in 1888.

He was consecrated in Westminster Abbey on 1 January 1884 by the Archbishop of Canterbury, assisted by the Bishops of London, Durham, Lincoln, Rochester, Dover and Bishop Perry. On 24 April, he was enthroned in St. Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney, installed as Bishop of Sydney and recognized as metropolitan of New South Wales and Primate of Australia and Tasmania.

Barry returned to England in 1889 and was appointed an Assistant Bishop of Rochester. In 1891 he was appointed Canon of the eleventh stall at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, a position he held until 1910. He was installed there on 13 January 1891; and in October–December 1891 he provided cover for Edward Bickersteth (Bishop of Exeter) while the latter was away in Japan.

Remaining a Canon of Windsor, he was also appointed Rector of St James's, Piccadilly, in 1895 (taking up the post after Michaelmas) and beginning to give episcopal assistance to the Bishop of London; he was (additionally) commissioned an Assistant Bishop of London in April 1897, which general commission he retained until his death.

Alfred Earle, suffragan Bishop of Marlborough, was often in ill-health during this period, and Barry (whose parish was within Marlborough's area) frequently deputised for him; when Earle resigned his responsibilities for West London in June 1900, Barry took these up (but not the See of Marlborough). Barry himself then resigned those responsibilities (for the rural deaneries of Westminster, Hampton, and Uxbridge) on medical advice in February 1903 and retired to the cloisters at Windsor Castle. He died at Windsor and his body lies in the cloisters of Worcester Cathedral. He was survived by his wife Louisa Victoria, daughter of Canon Hughes of Peterborough, whom he had married on 13 August 1851, and by two sons and a daughter. Another daughter, Mary Louisa (1862–1880) died young and was buried beneath the cloisters of his burial place.
