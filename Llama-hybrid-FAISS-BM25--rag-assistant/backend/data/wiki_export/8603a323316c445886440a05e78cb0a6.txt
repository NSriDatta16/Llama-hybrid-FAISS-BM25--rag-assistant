For Screening Purposes Only is the debut studio album by UK dance-punk trio Test Icicles, released in 2005. It was critically praised for being unique and compelling in an increasingly homogenous indie music scene. Following the group's split in February 2006, the album remains Test Icicles' only LP.

Title 

The name of the album is derived from the 1999 film Thicker Than Water. In the movie the phrase "For screening purposes only" appears on screen whenever any violence occurs in the film. Band member Rory Atwell has also stated that the first song on the album, "Your Biggest Mistake", is about the film.

Composition
The sounds on Screening Purposes fit somewhere between "cleaned-up" death-disco and "manicured" noise rock and dons "dance-punk verve and hardcore mayhem". It also digs into "hook-filled, slash-and burn" post-hardcore.

However, the trio bring in eclectic sounds of avant-pop, doom metal, funk and hip hop throughout.
