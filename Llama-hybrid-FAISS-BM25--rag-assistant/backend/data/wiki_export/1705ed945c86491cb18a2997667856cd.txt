Cergy-Saint-Christophe station (French: Gare de Cergy-Saint-Christophe) is a French railway station in the city of Cergy, France. The station opened on 29 September 1985 along with Cergy-Préfecture station. It was, until 1994, the terminus for RER's line A3 but is now the penultimate stop.

The station building is a large glass structure placed above the line at street level and comprises a metal and glass cylinder and Europe's largest clock. The architects were Martine and Philippe Deslandes, and the twin clock mechanisms were provided by Huchez.

Buildings have soon followed the station and the area is now Cergy's second shopping centre. From the station forecourt a pedestrian street leads to the plaza of the Axe Majeur from which is a view of the Vallée de l'Oise and of Paris. The axe is aligned with Paris' Champ de Mars.
