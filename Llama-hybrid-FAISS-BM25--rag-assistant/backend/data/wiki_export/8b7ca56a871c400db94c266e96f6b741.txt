Brett J.  Beyer (born 26 July 1966) is an Australian international sailing coach and world champion sailor.

Biography 
Beyer was born in Sydney, the youngest of three boys. He studied Sport Science at Wollongong University from 1985-1987.

Beyer's first major success as club, state, national and junior world champion in the Cherub class in 1983. He has been honoured as lifelong member with Woollahra Sailing Club on Sydney Harbour. Since 2000 he has been thrice nominated as "Yachtman of the year". In 2007, he was nominated as Master Athlete of the year. In 2014, he won his ninth World Championship. In 2015, he was nominated and won Sports NSW 'Master Athlete of 2014' amongst all sports in NSW.

His knowledge and commitment to the physical and mental requirements of elite competitive sports have held him in good stead for his own racing and ultimately, passing on those skills and knowledge to those aspiring for Olympic medals.

Beyer is known for a high standard of sportsmanship and athleticism, putting in many hours in practice sailing sessions and running innovative coaching programs. Beyer has achieved much success in the World Laser Masters Championship with ten gold medals, two silver and one bronze in the Apprentice and Master divisions since 2001. Brett Beyer has produced and lectured Level 2 and 3 coaching courses with an emphasis on the physiology involved in competitive sailing as well as the complex tactical strategies required for success. Brett has also contributed to ISAF Olympic Solidarity Courses around the world designed to assist developing nations to have sailing exposure.

Brett is currently working with Acquatic apparel brand, Vaikobi. News release: 
"One of the world's most awarded Laser sailors Brett Beyer has just claimed another victory, winning the Laser Masters World Championship in Mexico for a record 14th time! There is no one on the planet who has accumulated as many Laser Cubes as Brett Beyer (Last count was 78 Laser Cubes!)
But that’s not the only thing Brett is celebrating this month; Vaikobi is thrilled to finally announce a top secret design collaboration with Beyer, as the fast growing Australia sailing brand extends its range of dinghy sailing gear and hiking-specific products.
Not just by namesake; this partnership is an authentic collaboration that has sought Beyer’s professional laser sailing and Olympic coaching expertise, using his feedback to develop hikers that will undoubtedly help sailors of all ages and experience reach maximum performance across a range of conditions. There are also future product developments in the works through this partnership with Beyer."

From 2000 he has spent a considerable part of his time internationally coaching the Olympic elite.
Beyer has been working with Singapore Olympic Laser team since 2003 and helped them secure Olympic representation in the Laser 
and Laser Radial classes for the 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2016 Olympic Games. He is now working freelance with several top sailors with the
mission of achieving a medal in 2016 and 2020 Olympics.

These days, Brett is running his independent elite Laser group that is committed to qualifying for the Olympic Games in RIO. (Update.....this has been achieved in 2014). He limits the group to 3 elite sailors that are invited to be full-time participants in his training and racing program. This consists of a 6-month European racing circuit and several months for the Australian and New Zealand circuits. Each sailor bring his own strength and talent to the team. Brett has now competed himself or coached in 36 different countries and all States and Territories around Australia. His wealth of experience and successful coaching background has held him in high demand for high performance sailing across all classes.

Beyer now has an industry reputation of commitment, productivity and success.
