The GAAâ€“GPA All-Star Hurler of the Year is a hurling award presented to the player voted as best in the country by all the players from around Ireland. It began in 1995 and honours the achievements of a hurler of outstanding excellence.

Kilkenny players have won the award 10 out of 29 times, ahead of Limerick with five wins. Tipperary, Cork, Waterford and Clare have won it three times each.

The award's youngest winner was Tony Kelly, who won at the age of 19 in 2013. Henry Shefflin and Cian Lynch are the only players to have won the award more than once. The oldest winner is also Henry Shefflin, who was 33 when he won in 2012. Limerick are the only county to have had all three nominees come from the one county in a given year (2021 and 2023).

In 2011 the Gaelic Athletic Association and the Gaelic Players' Association announced that their respective annual player awards schemes were to merge under the sponsorship of Opel. The first merged awards were presented in 2011.
