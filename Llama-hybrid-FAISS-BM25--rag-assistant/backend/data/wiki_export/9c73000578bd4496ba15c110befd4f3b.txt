Secondary Highway 528, commonly referred to as Highway 528, is a provincially maintained secondary highway in the Canadian province of Ontario. It links the community of Wolseley Bay in French River with Highway 64. The route also has a short spur, Highway 528A. Highway 528 was designated, along with most secondary highways in the province, in 1956. It has remained unchanged since then.

Route description 
Highway 528 begins at an intersection with Highway 64 south of the community of Noelville, travelling east. The straight route travels through farmland initially, before entering the rock-infested Canadian Shield. Approximately  from its western terminus, the highway has a junction with its spur route, Highway 528A. The route enters Wolseley Bay and terminates at the Wolseley Bay Aerodrome.

Like other provincial routes in Ontario, Highway 528 is maintained by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario. In 2010, traffic surveys conducted by the ministry showed that on average, 640 vehicles used the highway daily along the section between Highway 64 and the Highway 528A junction while 220 vehicles did so each day along the section east of Highway 528A, the highest and lowest counts along the highway, respectively.

History 
Highway 528 was first assumed by the Department of Highways in early 1956, along with several dozen other secondary highways, but was likely provincially maintained as a development road prior to that.
The route has not changed since that time.
