"Hard to Make a Stand" is the third single from Sheryl Crow's self-titled second album (1996). It was released by A&M as a single only in Europe, Canada, Japan, and South Africa. The track caused controversy in the US due to its references to abortion. The music video for the song, directed by Matthew Amos, is taken from a live performance in London. A live performance of this song is featured on Sheryl Crow's 2006 concert DVD: Wildflower Tour, Live from New York.

Critical reception
Kevin Courtney from Irish Times commented, "'Hard to Make a Stand' is another just bog standard country rock tune, but somehow Ms Crow manages to turn it into a sparkling, rhinestone encrusted pop hit. This one faithfully follows the path of its predecessor, 'Everyday Is a Winding Road', offering nothing new except another chance to see the 1990s Linda Ronstadt do her cowgirl routine on video."
