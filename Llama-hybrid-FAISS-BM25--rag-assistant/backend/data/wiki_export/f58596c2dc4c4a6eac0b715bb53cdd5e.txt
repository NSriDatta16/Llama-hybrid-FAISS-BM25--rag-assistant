Ethylhexyl palmitate, also known as octyl palmitate, is the fatty acid ester derived from 2-ethylhexanol and palmitic acid. It is frequently utilized in cosmetic formulations.

Chemical structure
Ethylhexyl palmitate is a branched saturated fatty ester derived from ethylhexyl alcohol and palmitic acid.

Physical properties
Ethylhexyl palmitate is a clear, colorless liquid with a slightly fatty odor at room temperature.

The ester is synthesized by reacting palmitic acid and 2-ethylhexanol in the presence of an acid catalyst.
