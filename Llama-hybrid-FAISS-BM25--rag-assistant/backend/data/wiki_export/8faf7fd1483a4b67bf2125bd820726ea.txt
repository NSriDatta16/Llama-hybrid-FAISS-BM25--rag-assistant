Liberty Plaza
The Lombardo family invested heavily to create a shopping district in Central Square.  They began with a function hall named Lombardo's Function Facility and expanded to create what is now called Liberty Plaza, the square's strip mall.  They expanded with a large supermarket, Liberty Market.  In 2000, the family moved their business to Randolph, but the shopping plaza is still active and vibrant.  The entrance to the Plaza features a small park, known as Bertulli Park or Central Square Park, which doubles as a rotary.  Today, stores include CVS Pharmacy, Marshalls, Sprint, AutoZone, Shaw's Supermarket, including eateries such as McDonald's and Pollo Campero.

In 1981, the Boston Landmarks Commission declared it a landmark and it was later added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.
