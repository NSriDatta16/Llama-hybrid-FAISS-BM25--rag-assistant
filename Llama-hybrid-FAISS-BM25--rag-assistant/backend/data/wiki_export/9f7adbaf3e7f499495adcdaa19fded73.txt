The office of Mayor of the City and County of Limerick is currently the title used by the chairperson of Limerick City and County Council. Prior to the establishment of the council, the Mayor of Limerick was the chairperson of Limerick City Council. The office was originally established in 1195 and reinforced by a charter issued in 1197.

Election to the office
The Mayor is elected to office annually by councillors of Limerick City and County Council from amongst its members. There is currently no popular vote, but in May 2019 a plebiscite was held during the local elections which voted in favour of a directly elected mayor, with the first expected to be elected in 2022. Current practice is for the term of office to begin in June with the former Mayor presenting the Chain of Office to the incoming Mayor, thus formally inaugurating a new term. The process is repeated the following June, unless the same person is given a second consecutive term.

Directly elected mayor
At the 2019 Limerick City and County Council election, voters approved a proposal in a plebiscite on the establishment of a directly elected mayor for Limerick City and County by a vote of 52.4%. In August 2023, the Local Government (Mayor of Limerick) Bill 2023 was published. Kieran O'Donnell, Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, stated that it was the intention of the government that the election for a directly elected Mayor for Limerick would be held on the same date as the 2024 local elections, which will be held between 6 June and 9 June 2024. The powers currently vested in the chief executive are proposed to be transferred to the Mayor of Limerick.

History of the office
The office has existed, in one form or another, since it was inaugurated in 1195. The title of Provost was used up to the 14th century.
