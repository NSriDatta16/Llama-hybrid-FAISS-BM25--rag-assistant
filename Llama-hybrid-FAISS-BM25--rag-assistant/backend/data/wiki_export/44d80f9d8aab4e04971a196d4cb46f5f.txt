The Senators finished with a  record for the season.

Kittridge was traded to the Cleveland Naps in the middle of the 1906 season, but he only had five at bats for the Naps before retiring from baseball. In 1910, Kittridge served as player-manager of the Elgin Kittens in the Class D level Northern Association. The team's "Kittens" moniker was in honor of Kittridge. The team finished in first place.
