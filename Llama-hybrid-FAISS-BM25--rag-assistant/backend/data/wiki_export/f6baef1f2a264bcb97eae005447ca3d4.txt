Rameshwar Das Birla (also Rameshwardas Birla) (1892â€“1973) was an Indian entrepreneur. He was second son of Baldeo Das Birla and the father of Madhav Prasad Birla and Gajanan Birla. He is known for founding hospitals & educational institutions in Mumbai, Kolkata and Pilani.

Birla's decision in 1922 to remarry following the death of his first wife caused a split in the Maheshwari caste of which his family were a member. They were outcast by the community, who doubted that his new wife was herself a Maheshwari and thus believed that Birla had broken the caste rules relating to marriage.
