History 
Sound of Life was incorporated in the early 1980s by a group of people in the Kingston, New York area who wanted to begin a faith-based radio station for the Hudson Valley which would encourage and reach out to and be supported by listeners. After nearly buying WHVW in 1982, the network obtained the construction permit for 89.7Â MHz Kingston, which signed on as WFGB on January 9, 1985.
