American Samoa's at-large congressional district encompasses the entire U.S. territorial region of American Samoa.  The territory does not have a voting member of Congress but does elect a delegate who can participate in debates and vote in committees of which they are a member.  Amata Coleman Radewagen is the current delegate of the islands.

From 1970 to 1978, American Samoa elected an unofficial delegate-at-large in four-year terms to lobby for formal admission to the House of Representatives; they were A. U. Fuimaono from 1971 to 1975, A. P. Lutali from 1975 to 1979 (simultaneously serving in the American Samoa Senate from 1977), and Fof≈ç Sunia from 1979 to 1981 (when the delegate was formally recognized by Congress).
