Peelle began his professional career in 2002, when he was a fourth-round selection (103rd overall) by the San Diego Chargers and their general manager John Butler in the 2002 NFL Draft. He played in 15 games his rookie season, including two starts. On the year, he caught three passes for 15 yards. Peelle was also fifth on the squad with seven tackles on special teams.

He had his most productive day of season at the Raiders on October 16 when he caught three passes for 20 yards, including a four-yard touchdown reception from running back LaDainian Tomlinson in the Chargers’ 27–14 victory.

Miami Dolphins

The Miami Dolphins signed Peelle as an unrestricted free agent on March 20, 2006. Peelle signed a three-year deal with the team which included base salaries of $600,000 (2006), $1.2 million (2007), and $1.3 million (2008).

Peelle appeared in 15 games for the Dolphins in 2006, including a career-high ten starts. This was due to the team's increased use of two-tight end sets, which created more time for Peelle and less for fullback Darian Barnes. He finished with 16 catches for 116 yards and one touchdown on the season, marking the fourth consecutive season he had at least one touchdown catch. He was inactive once (on October 15 at the New York Jets) with a knee injury, allowing tight end Jason Rader to make the first start of his career. On November 19 against the Minnesota Vikings, Peelle had three catches for 21 yards and one touchdown, coming on an 11-yard pass from former Oregon teammate Joey Harrington. It was his first touchdown catch as a member of the Dolphins.

On August 30, 2008, Peelle was released by the Dolphins during final cuts.
