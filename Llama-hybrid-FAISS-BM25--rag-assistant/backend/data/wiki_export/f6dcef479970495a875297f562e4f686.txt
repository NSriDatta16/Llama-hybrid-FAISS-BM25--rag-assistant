Attractions
There is a bakery called Panadería La Unión located near the town that has become famous on the region. Most buses going to Ushuaia stop here so their passengers can have a coffee, and eat baked goods. The walls are lined with autographed photographs of Argentine celebrities who have visited the town over the decades.

Top Gear incident  
In 2014, Tolhuin was the site of an attack on the film crew from the BBC TV program Top Gear. The crew was confronted by what the presenters called "a mob", who blocked off the road access and began to pelt their cars with stones in a protest over the license plate on Jeremy Clarkson's Porsche 928 that referenced the Falklands War. Following the attack, the crew abandoned the damaged vehicles at a police checkpoint and left the country.

Climate

Tolhuin has a tundra climate (ET) that borders closely on a subpolar oceanic climate (Cfc) and subantarctic continental climate (Dfc).
