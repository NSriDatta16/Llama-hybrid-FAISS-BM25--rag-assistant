Northland Christian School is a private, Christian, PK-12 school located in Northwest Houston.

History

Northland Christian School (NCS) was established in the spring of 1974. Seeking to create a school in their community that combined excellence in education with a commitment to teaching Biblical principles, a group of dedicated families from Bammel Church of Christ gathered $1,000 of seed money, sought teachers who shared their vision, and found a physical location for the school.

Instrumental in the founding of NCS were DeAnna and Jim Graves, in whose honor their elementary school building is named. DeAnna was Northland Christian's first Head of School, as well as one of its first dedicated teachers, among countless other roles. Jim Graves served as a board member for 20 years and supported Northland Christian in those crucial early years.

NCS officially opened in the fall of 1974 with a combined enrollment of 43 students. Now, they have around 520 students annually. With a strong international program of around 35-40 students each year, and domestic students from more than 60 Houston area zip codes, NCS is small but diverse.
