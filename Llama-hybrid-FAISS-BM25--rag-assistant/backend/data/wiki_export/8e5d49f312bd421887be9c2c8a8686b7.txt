Ruapuke is a small farming community (predominantly sheep and cattle farmers) in the Waikato region on the slopes of Karioi, between Raglan and Kawhia in New Zealand.

History 
The introduction to 'Ruapuke' says, "The greater part of the Ruapuke District is of a sandy loam, and at one time carried a large population of Maoris, as is evidenced by old pas, great heaps of shells, warehouse sites and numerous kumara storage pits. When the first Europeans arrived the sandy country was covered with patches of light bush, with a big proportion of Karaka, Pūriri, and Cabbage trees. The balance was covered with Tauhinu, Teatree, Flax and Fern. The clay portion of the district, (inland and on the slopes of Mt Karioi) was in heavy bush." The archaeological map shows over 40 sites in the area. The European settlers, George Charlton and his sons-in-law, Captains Swann and Liddell, arrived in the 1850s. [1]

The  Ruapuke block was bought by the government from Ngāti Whakamarurangi between 1854 and 1856 for £300. A Waitangi Tribunal report says, "McLean appears to have applied pressure on Māori sellers to induce them to accept a price they had previously rejected . . . We find that, in this way, the Crown failed to act honourably and in good faith".

Ruapuke had a school from 1877 till 1954. The school was rebuilt in 1937. It has been replaced by a school bus.There was a store at Motakotako from the 1860s. From about 1875 to 1883 it was run by John William Ellis, who later founded Ellis & Burnand. Another store opened briefly in the 1890s.

From 1873 until the 1900s there were up to three flaxmills running.
