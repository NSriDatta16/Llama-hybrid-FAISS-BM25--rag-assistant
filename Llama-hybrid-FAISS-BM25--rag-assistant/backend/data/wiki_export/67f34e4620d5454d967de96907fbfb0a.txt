Reception
The GlassCafe was received favourably.  Kirkus Reviews found it "Not too likely, but all good fun, and Paulsen claims that Al is based on an actual acquaintance. Introduce reluctant readers, Paulsen fans, or anyone who enjoys an occasional belly laugh to this prototypical preteen and his most memorable mom."  while Publishers Weekly wrote "In one of his minor efforts, the prolific Paulsen serves up a righteous, proâ€“free-speech theme accompanied by big helpings of over-the-top plot lines." and "Paulsen looks to the endless run-on sentences and artless grammar of Tony's delivery for humor", concluding " Readers who like this style of writing can rest easy: Paulsen maintains that style all the way to the end."
