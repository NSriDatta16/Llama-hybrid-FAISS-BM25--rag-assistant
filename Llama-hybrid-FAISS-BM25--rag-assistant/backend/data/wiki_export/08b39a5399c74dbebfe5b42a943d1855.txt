Highland station is a SEPTA Regional Rail station in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Located at 8412 Seminole Avenue at Highland Avenue in the Chestnut Hill neighborhood, it serves the Chestnut Hill West Line. The Pennsylvania Railroad initiated service on June 11, 1884.

The station is in zone 2 on the Chestnut Hill West Line, on former Pennsylvania Railroad tracks, and is 10.7 track miles from Suburban Station. In 2004, this station saw 32 boardings on an average weekday.
