History
Distinctive Records was initially founded in 1995 and started out as a sublabel of Avex Recordings (UK). In 1998, Avex reorganized, closed two of its labels and only continued trading music recordings as Distinct'ive Records. In 1999, The company began categorizing its genres within the label, sometimes retitling itself "Distinct'ive Breaks", which was often mistaken to be a sublabel of Distinct'ive.

The label gained popularity in 2000 at the launch of its own "Y3K" series.
