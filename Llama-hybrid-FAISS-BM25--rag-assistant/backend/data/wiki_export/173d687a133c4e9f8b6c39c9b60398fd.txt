The studio was created in 1964 from the animation division of Studioul Cinematografic București (Bucharest Cinematographic Studios). Ion Popescu-Gopo was the best-known graphic artist and animator working at Animafilm.

Initially a state-owned studio, after the fall of the communist regime in 1989, Animafilm became a private company.
