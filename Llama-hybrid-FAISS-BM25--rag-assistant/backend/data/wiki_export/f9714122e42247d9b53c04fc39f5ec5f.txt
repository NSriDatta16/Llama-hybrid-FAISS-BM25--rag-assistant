History
Norman High School's history began in 1890 with the construction of the township's first high school, located at what was then the west side of the city. The institution was the only educational facility in Norman, tutoring students from elementary through high school. In the early 1900s, the original high school building burned down following an attempt to condemn the school. After the fire, Norman lacked an official high school building for 15–19 years. During this time, students were taught in homes, businesses, churches and other facilities. The second structure to house Norman High was located off of Porter Avenue and was used until 1954 when the current building was constructed, leaving the old building to become Central Mid-High, and eventually, Longfellow Middle School.

In 2014, students and community members staged a protest amid allegations that the school mishandled a rape investigation and "punished the victims for being victims." The school expelled the alleged rapist, and when charges were formally brought against him, a spokesperson for Norman Public Schools released a statement that the school district's leadership was "pleased that charges were filed." Court proceedings resulted in a 10-year prison sentence, of which eight were suspended.
