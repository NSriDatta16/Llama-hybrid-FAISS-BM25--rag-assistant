"Anymore" was the second single of Tritt's career to reach Number One on the Hot Country Songs charts. Overall, this is Tritt's highest-certified album; with sales of over three million copies in the U.S., it has been certified 3Ã— Platinum by the RIAA. He recorded the song "Bible Belt" for My Cousin Vinny in collaboration with the band Little Feat, and this placement gained him some exposure.
