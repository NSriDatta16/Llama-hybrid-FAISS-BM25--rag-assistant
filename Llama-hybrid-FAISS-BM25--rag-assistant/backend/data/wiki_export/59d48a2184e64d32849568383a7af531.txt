Randwick District Rugby Union Football Club, also known as the Galloping Greens, is an Australian rugby union club which competes in the Sydney premier grade rugby union competition. The club was formed in 1882 and since then has won 32 first grade premierships and six Australian club championships. It is one of the traditional powerhouses of the Shute Shield competition, winning 14 titles from 1978 to 1996. Randwick's colours are myrtle green and the club's home ground is Coogee Oval. In the 1980s the club produced many Wallabies, including the  Ella brothers. Its history has seen many of Australia's best players represent the club, including the likes of George Gregan and David Campese. In all, 93 Randwick players have pulled on a Wallaby jersey, and nine have had the honour of captaining their country.
