Oberkfell was a member of the 1982 World Series Champion St. Louis Cardinals, hitting .292 in that series.

Oberkfell was part of the "Bearded Braves" triumvirate along with Glenn Hubbard and Bruce Sutter. He told Neil Holfeld of the Houston Chronicle in a May 17, 1985, story that, "the beards make us stand out from the clean cut Dale Murphy types. Consider us a modern era House of David team."
