Championship Off-Road Racing (usually abbreviated CORR) was a sanctioning body for short course off-road racing in the United States. It formed in 1998 and went bankrupt in 2008. Its Midwest races were supplanted in 2007 by the Traxxas TORC Series and by the Lucas Oil Off Road Racing Series on the West Coast in 2009. Both received most of the drivers and adopted the same racing format.

History
CORR was formed in 1998 by ESPN announcer Marty Reid. It displaced the SODA series at the premiere short course off-road racing series when most of the drivers in SODA moved to CORR. The series was purchased by Jim Baldwin in 2005.

Baldwin canceled two of the rounds at Las Vegas in October 2008. In a press release, he stated: "Championship Off Road Racing has made the difficult decision to cancel the Primm, Nevada race on October 25th and 26th. The current credit crisis has made it very difficult to cover CORR’s costs." He filed for bankruptcy and abandoned the sanctioning body's facilities in Chula Vista, California.

Classes
There were ten classes in the series.

The eight truck classes were: Pro 4, Pro 2, Pro Spec, Pro Lite, and Trophy Kart (Junior I, Junior II, Modified).
