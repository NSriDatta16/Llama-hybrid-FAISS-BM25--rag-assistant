Michael Paul Koplove (; born August 30, 1976) is an American professional baseball scout and former player. He pitched for the Arizona Diamondbacks and the Cleveland Indians.

A sidearm relief pitcher, Koplove threw with a different arm angle than most pitchers. His arm angle was perpendicular to his body, which allowed his fastball to sink and his curveball and slider to stay on the same plane, making it appear to be a fastball. He won a bronze medal with Team USA in the 2008 Olympics.

Early life

Koplove was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He is the son of Steve (an attorney) and Lorraine Milito, and is half Jewish and half Christian. He is the older brother of Joey Criniti and minor league and Team Israel pitcher Kenny Koplove, who is 17 years younger. He also has three sisters; named Andrea and Erica and Franca.

Koplove grew up in South Philadelphia and attended Chestnut Hill Academy in Philadelphia (where he was a first-team Philadelphia Daily News All-City selection as a senior) from which he graduated in 1995. After high school Koplove first attended Northwestern University for two years where he played shortstop and pitched, before transferring to the University of Delaware prior to his junior year. In 1997, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Chatham A's of the Cape Cod Baseball League. During his junior season at the University of Delaware, he helped lead the team to the 1998 America East Championship and the NCAA Atlantic II Regional. He was voted an Academic All American.  He was drafted by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the 29th round of the 1998 Major League Baseball Draft.
