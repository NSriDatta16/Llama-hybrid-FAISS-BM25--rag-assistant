Ken "The Champ" Climo (born March 27, 1968, in Clearwater, Florida) is a professional disc golfer considered by some to be the best professional disc golfer of all time. Climo has claimed Twelve PDGA World Championship titles, including nine in as many years from 1990 to 1998.. Harold Duvall (1982, 1985), Barry Schultz (2003–2004), Nate Doss (2005, 2007, 2011), Paul McBeth (2012–2015, 2019, 2022) and Richard Wysocki (2016, 2017) are the only other golfers with more than one open world title.  In addition to his world titles, Climo has an unequalled record in the United States Disc Golf Championship (the premier event in the game), holding five titles (1999, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2007).  Named seven times as the PDGA player of the year, Ken Climo was inducted into the PDGA Hall of Fame in 1995.

He competed in the World Championships masters division for the first time in 2012, at the age of 44, and won by a large margin, for his 13th world championship title.  He has added 2 more world titles to his resume since then (2014, 2015).

In his 20 years on the PDGA, Climo has notched 103 aces.
