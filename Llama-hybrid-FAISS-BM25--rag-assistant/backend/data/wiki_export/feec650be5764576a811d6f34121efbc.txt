Two more singles were released from the album, "Sugar Free" in December 1986 gave the band a third Australian Top 10 hit, and "One and One (Ain't I Good Enough)" in April 1987 which peaked inside the Top 20. "Sugar Free" was released in the United States in July 1987 and peaked at number 35 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song featured in the film, Cassandra. "Stimulation" was released as the follow-up single where it peaked at number 86. It was featured in the film Satisfaction. In 1987, a remix album, titled Ulta Mixes was released.

During the recording of the second studio album in 1988, keyboardist Phil Witchett died. In November 1988, "Can't Control Myself" was released as the lead single from the band's second studio album. The song peaked at number 31. Their second studio album, Blush was released in May 1989, and spawned two more Top 100 hits in Australia, "So Good" and "I Want You". The group disbanded later in 1989.
