Charles Wayman (16 May 1921 â€“ 26 February 2006) was an English footballer.

Wayman, who was born in Chilton, Bishop Auckland, was a prolific centre-forward in the first decade after the Second World War. Newcastle United signed him from Spennymoor United in September 1941, while he was working as a miner at Chilton Colliery. He later formed a great partnership with Ted Bates at Southampton. In total, he played for five Football League clubs between 1941 and 1958. A knee injury forced his retirement from league football. He later coached Evenwood Town and became a sales manager for the Scottish and Newcastle brewery.

His brother, Frank, was also a professional footballer.
