Golden Films was an American production studio founded in 1994 by Diane Eskenazi, previously known as American Film Investment Corporation. The studio has produced a variety of animated films including the Enchanted Tales series, which were originally distributed by Sony and a series of well known specials for Hallmark.

This prompted The Walt Disney Company to sue one of Golden Films' distributors after a string of Disney Renaissance-era films ended up in direct competition with Golden Films' productions on the home video market. As both Disney and Golden Films had relied on the same public domain source material, Disney ultimately lost the case. The Golden Films library also uses classical music and over 200 original songs.

History
The company was founded in the late 1980s by Diane Eskenazi under the name American Film Investment Corporation. Since 1990 the studio produced a first series of medium-length films lasting half an hour. These films were animated in South Korea by Dai Won . The second series of films, approximately 45 minutes long, was produced under the American Film Investment Corporation II banner , and was animated in Japan by KKC&D Asia and Mook DLE , often partnering with other South Korean studios . The films of the second cycle use classical music composed by European composers in their soundtrack , however each film features an original opening song.

The studio's films were released directly to home video by several distributors, including Trimark and GoodTimes Home Video , the same company that would later also distribute Jetlag Productions films . In fact, by 1994, Jetlag Productions replaced American Film as GoodTimes' supplier of low-budget animated films.

In 1993 Disney sued the distributors of American Film, when some of the Disney Renaissance films ended up competing on the home video market with the low-cost productions of Golden Films. Since both Disney and American Film relied on the same public domain entities, Disney ended up losing the case [1] .

Since 1994 the company changed its name to Golden Films. Films produced during this period were distributed by Sony Wonder , Hallmark and Cinedigm .

The studio went bankrupt in 2004.
