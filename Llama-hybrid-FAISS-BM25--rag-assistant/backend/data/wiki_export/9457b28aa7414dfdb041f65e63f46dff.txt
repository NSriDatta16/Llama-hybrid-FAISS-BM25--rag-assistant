Hepsi was a Turkish girlband. They consisted of Eren Bakıcı, Cemre Kemer and Yasemin Yürük, and formerly of Gülçin Ergül, who left in 2009. Cemre Kemer's mother is a famous manager, Şebnem Özberk. When they were nine years old, they were students  at the same conservatory and her mother began to build the group. All the members of the group are ballet dancers.

The group was largely followed in Turkey, with their audience being made up mainly of teenage boys and girls and pre-teen girls.
The group also starred in their own soap opera, called Hepsi 1 on one of the main channels, ATV Turkey.

Album "Bir"
The group rose to fame in the year 2005 with their debut album Bir, which spawned the hit songs "Olmaz Oğlan", "Üç Kalp", and "Herşeye Rağmen", and the hugely successful song "Yalan".

Album: Hepsi 2 

In June 2006 the group released their second studio Hepsi 2.  The first single from the album, "Kalpsizsin", in 2006, also became a huge hit, winning them an award at the Kral TV Music Awards for the best group. The second single was "Aşk Sakızı" in 2007 which also became a huge hit.

EP "Tempo"
They went on to release their first official EP, Tempo, in association with Pepsi, and worked with Turkish Pop legend Sezen Aksu, famous for working with Tarkan.

Album: Şaka (10+1) 

The group released their third studio album on 24 May 2008. The group stated that the third album was gonna be "different", On 3 May 2008, the album title was confirmed to be Şaka (10+1).

The album's name includes "(10+1)", because the ten songs featured on the album are covers of famous songs Hepsi have re-produced for their unique style. Some of the featured songs are from very famous singers in Turkey such as Ajda Pekkan and Sezen Aksu, however there is only one brand new song in this album which is "4 Peynirli Pizza", written by Kenan Dogulu. "4 Peynirli Pizza" is the first single for this album and was released on 23 May 2008.

Album: Geri Dönüşüm
After Gülçin Ergül left, they released album "Geri Dönüşüm" in 2010.

Series "Hepsi 1" 

Hepsi 1 is a Turkish soap which airs once a week on ATV, originally on Show TV. The soap shows the girls as pre-famous and how they became famous. The characters of themselves are over the top, however the show has some truth about the girls, such as their likes and dislikes.

Season one attracted many views with an average of 3.2 million viewers a week. Season two had an average of 2.5 million to 6 million viewers a week.

The last episode of the season 2 has aired on 3 June 2008. Although it was said by ATV that season 2 was going to be the last season, it has been confirmed by ATV that a season 3 for Hepsi1 will be made. 
It did seem quite a hard decision to be made by ATV because of the number of viewers changing every week from approximately 6 million viewers per week to 2.5 million viewers. However, because of a high number of requests to ATV and the number of viewers being quite high, ATV has confirmed that there will be a Season 3 made. Although it was confirmed it may have a long delay because of the group's promotion of their new album and also the recording of their movie.
