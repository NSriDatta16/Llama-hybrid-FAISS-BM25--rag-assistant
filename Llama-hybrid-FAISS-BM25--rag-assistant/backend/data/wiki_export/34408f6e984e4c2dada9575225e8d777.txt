Yukon Jack is a liqueur, made from Canadian whisky and honey. It is named after the pioneer Leroy Napoleon 'Jack' McQuesten. In Canada, it is 40% alcohol by volume (or 80 proof), whereas in the United States, it is 50% ABV. The origin of the liqueur is unknown, but it was advertised in Maryland in the United States as early as 1946, later imported by Heublein Inc in the 1970s. It is now owned by the Sazerac Company. Yukon Jack was selected as the regimental liqueur used for special occasions and commemorations for the South Alberta Light Horse and the 19th Alberta Dragoons.

Product classification 
Although Canadian whisky regulations allow for the inclusion of a small percentage of non-whisky alcohol in a blend as an additional flavouring, Yukon Jack includes non-alcohol flavours, and is therefore labelled as "Canadian liquor" instead of Canadian whisky.

History 
Yukon Jack was first recorded when it was imported into the United States by Heublein Inc. Heublein was responsible for the advertising of Yukon Jack and its popularisation in the United States. The brand was later taken over by Diageo plc., a British drinks company. In 2018, Diageo sold Yukon Jack along with 18 other alcohol brands to the Sazerac Company for $550 million. It is now manufactured in Valleyfield, Quebec. Yukon Jack was also selected as the Regimental liqueur of the South Alberta Light Horse. It is used as the liqueur in official regimental toasts. It commemorates the stationing in Whitehorse, Yukon in the 1950s of the C Squadron of the 19th Alberta Dragoons, as a part of the 19th Alberta Armoured Car Regiment.

Cocktails 
Yukon Jack is a whisky blended with honey, described as a "very strong and very sweet drink with fruity undertones.". It can be consumed as is, with ice, or as an ingredient in cocktails.
