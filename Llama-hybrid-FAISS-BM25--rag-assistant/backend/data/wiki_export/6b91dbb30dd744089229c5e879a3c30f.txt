100 Demons is an American metalcore band from Waterbury, Connecticut. Being fans of tattoos, the band derived their name from a book of traditional Japanese tattoo artwork by Horiyoshi III. The band usually incorporates their agnostic beliefs into their lyrics.  

After over a decade of playing in the Connecticut hardcore scene, Deathwish Inc. announced the signing of 100 Demons to a record contract in 2003. In a press release the label was quoted as saying "Today's 100 DEMONS encapsulate a viciousness and ravenous intensity that few could achieve." The band then found themselves at Planet Z Studios with producer Zeuss (Hatebreed, Shadows Fall) recording their self-titled album.

The video for the song "Repeat Process" was featured on Headbangers Ball.

In 2019, Pete Morcey announced his new folk-influenced side project entitled Murmur.
