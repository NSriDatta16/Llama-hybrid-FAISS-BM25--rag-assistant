History
CNMI Governor Carlos S. Camacho created the college as an official governmental entity through Executive Order #25. The Executive Order established the college as one of the divisions within the Commonwealth Department of Education.

Northern Marianas Community College was founded in 1976. The college was established in May 1981. By mid-summer of 1981, the College was offering training programs for government employees and teachers of the CNMI Public School System. In January 1983, Public Law 3-43 established NMC as a public, nonprofit corporation having the Board of Education as its governing board. In March 1985, Public Law 4-34 amended the Higher Education Act of 1983 by creating a separate Board of Regents and broadening the authority and responsibility of the governing board. In June 1985, NMC received its initial accreditation from the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges (ACCJC) of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC). That accreditation was reaffirmed in 1990, 1996, and 2001. In March 2001, the Accrediting Commission for Senior Colleges & Universities of WASC granted NMC initial accreditation for offering a Bachelor of Science degree in Elementary Education.

In March 1999, President Agnes McPhetres  delivered the first State of the College Address.
