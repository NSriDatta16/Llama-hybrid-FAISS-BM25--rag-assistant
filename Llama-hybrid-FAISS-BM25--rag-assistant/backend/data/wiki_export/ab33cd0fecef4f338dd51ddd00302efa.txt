History
After the Union of Bessarabia with Romania in 1918, the county was part of Romania, which set up the county formally in 1925.

The area county of the county was occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940 and became part of the Moldavian SSR and the Ukrainian SSR. The area returned to Romanian administration following the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union in July 1941. A military administration was established and the region's Jewish population was either executed on the spot or deported to Transnistria, where further numbers were killed. Despite the Hotin County was geographically part of Bessarabia, it was not incorporated into the Bessarabia Governorate, but rather in the Bukovina Governorate, centered around the geographical region of Bukovina. Dorohoi County was also posteriously attached to the governorate even though it was not in Bukovina either. As the Soviet Union's offensive pushed the Axis powers back, the area again was under Soviet control. On September 12, 1944, Romania signed the Moscow Armistice with the Allies. The Armistice, as well as the subsequent peace treaty of 1947, confirmed the Soviet-Romanian border as it was on January 1, 1941. The areas of the county, along with the rest of the Moldavian SSR and the Ukrainian SSR, became part of the independent countries of Moldova and Ukraine, respectively.
