History 
Renningen lies in an area which even in the Early Stone Age was thickly populated. Proof of this are the many remains found of settlements from the linear pottery culture.
Remains of settlements found to originate with the Urnenfelderkultur (c. 1000 BC) as well the Hallstatt- and La Tène culture (Early to Late Iron Age), provide evidence of settlement during various prehistoric eras.

The evaluation of archeological digs and finds show expansion of two early Alemannic settlements within the Renningen Basin north and south of the Rankbach. Excavations by the then State Office for Historical Monuments in Baden-Württemberg in the Raite Industrial Park (1991) unearthed a number of farmsteads comprising three-naved longhouses, storehouses and pit houses (4th and 5th century).

A second settlement in the Neuwiesenäckern developed into a large settlement, which can now be identified as Altheim, first mentioned in the 12th century. 
During the Middle Ages, numerous other areas of settlement sprang up alongside this settlement. In the 12th and 13th century the population began to gravitate towards the two present-day centres of the town, since around 1200 the expansion of the outlying areas of the town seems to have stopped. Several earlier finds in the centre of Renningen show, that an older core settlement exists on the site of the later village. A few finds belong to the late Merovingian period or the  Carolingian period, but most of the finds date to the 11th or 12th century and are contemporary with the settlements on the Neuwiesenäckern. It is however uncertain if the site had been occupied during the centuries between. 
Near the church there is a graveyard from the early Merovingian era excavated in 1989/90 by the State Office for Historical Monuments, which was abandoned c. 500 though it is questionable as to whether it served an actual settlement, since the only evidence for this is a single fragment of pottery found in the vicinity. Later burial sites have been found on only the south side of Malmsheim, on the site of a suspected early Merovingian graveyard.

Written tradition says that Renningen was subject to the Villikation system of the Weißenburg monastery during the Carolingian period. 22½ farmsteads are mentioned, whereby the historical observations on the fate of this property raise the question as to whether these farmsteads were located within the later boundaries of the town. In the 11th and 12th centuries there was a nobility, which owned property in both towns, according to written records. In Malmsheim and the abandoned Altheim, Staufian style properties have been found. By the 14th century the community was organised to some extent, with the existence of a Schultheiß (Early form of Mayor) as well as a collective three-field system.

At the dawn of the modern era, Renningen was a large village, characterised by its craftsmen, its town boundaries marked by a wall, which exists to this day.

In 1982 Renningen was granted town rights. New development has expanded the former village well to the north.

Religion 
Since the Reformation Renningen has been predominantly Evangelical. Only in recent time has a Roman Catholic community emerged once more. Alongside these, there is a New Apostolic community and the Liebenzeller Gemeinschaft.

Economy and Infrastructure 

Renningen is economically dependent on the wider community, a large percentage of the workforce work outside the district, for example at DaimlerChrysler in Sindelfingen or in Stuttgart. Nevertheless, there are employment opportunities, for example through Pininfarina, who are involved in Formula 1 and in manufacture of sports cars. Kromberg & Schubert, the major cable harness supplier to the German car industry also have a presence in the town.

The DaimlerChrysler subsidiary MCC Smart previously had their main office in Renningen, as did Rinol AG, a manufacturer of floor coverings for industrial use, before their insolvency. Rinol, managed by former „Entrepreneur of the Year“, Kurt-Jörg Gaiser, were floated on the stock exchange on the same day as Deutsche Telekom and were seen as an „Over Performer“ on the CDAX.

Huron Frassmachinen Gmbh, the German subsidiary of Huron Graffenstaden SAS, Feance, has opened Technology Zentrum and their German Headquarters here. Huron is world-renowned CNC machine tool builder manufacturing 3 axes and 5 axes CNC machining centers and also offers CNC turning and milling machines.
