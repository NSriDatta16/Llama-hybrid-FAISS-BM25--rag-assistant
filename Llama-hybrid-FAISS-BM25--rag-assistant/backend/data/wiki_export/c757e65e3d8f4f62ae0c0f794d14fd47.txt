Acclaim 
The Eight garnered international acclaim upon its release and continues to be ranked as a top thriller novel. Publishers Weekly said, “Even readers with no interest in chess will be swept up into this astonishing fantasy-adventure… Neville has great fun rewriting history and making it all ring true. With two believable heroines, nonstop suspense, espionage, murder, and a puzzle that seems the key to the whole Western mystical tradition, this spellbinder soars above the level of first-rate escapist entertainment.” The Washington Post called The Eight "A feminist answer to Raiders of the Lost Ark." The Boston Herald lauded the novel as “The female counterpart to Umberto Eco’s The Name of the Rose… Impossible to put down.”

A Calculated Risk was selected as a New York Times Notable Book for 1992. Newgate Callendar of the New York Times Book Review said, “Never a dull moment, and Ms Neville makes it all the more plausible because of her intimate knowledge of how international banking works. She plots well and takes the reader through the intrigues and backbiting of immense corporations…[A Calculated Risk] churns up wave after wave of excitement."

Booklist called The Magic Circle "compelling" and noted that "fans of that emerging subgenre —– the millennial thriller —- will want to add this one to their reading list.” Beth Dora Reisberg of January Magazine termed The Magic Circle a "tour de force."

The Fire, Neville's sequel to The Eight, topped bestseller lists internationally and quickly became a New York Times Bestseller. In a 2008 review in The Independent of London, Barry Forshaw declared that The Fire was much better than The Da Vinci Code. The Chicago Sun-Times stated, "Katherine Neville’s follow up to The Eight, a cult classic that impressed many readers as a more intelligent and literary precursor to Dan Brown’s The DaVinci Code. . . The Fire impresses as much for its literary aspects as it does for its action, puzzles and suspense . . . This is a book to be savored as it’s read, and admired for the beauty of its accomplishment.”

Neville’s books have been bestsellers in many countries, and appeared on many bestseller lists in the United States, including USA Today, New York Times, Publishers Weekly, Wall Street Journal, Indie List, Seattle Times, San Francisco Chronicle, Los Angeles Times, Washington Post, St Paul Pioneer Press, and Denver Post.
