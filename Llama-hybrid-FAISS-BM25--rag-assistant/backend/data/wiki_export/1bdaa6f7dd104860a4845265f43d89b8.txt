Harrison High School (also known as Farmington Harrison) was a four-year secondary institution located in Farmington Hills, Michigan. It was part of the Farmington Public School District serving students from the cities of Farmington, Farmington Hills, and a portion of West Bloomfield Township.

Harrison High School's mission was “to develop students to be caring and engaged learners who make informed decisions as they become internationally minded in their stewardship of the world and its resources." Harrison's mascot was the Hawk and its colors are green and gold. The school closed in 2019 and its building was repurposed into a recreation and performing arts center named The Hawk.

History
Harrison High School opened in September 1970 with Freshman, Sophomore and Junior classes. The Juniors were the first graduating class in June 1972. The school is named for Gerald V. Harrison who was superintendent of Farmington Public Schools from 1957 to 1967, a period of dramatic growth in the school district. Harrison was the third high school in the district, and the only one with a Freshman class.

In March 2016, the Farmington school board announced that the school was to close at the end of the 2018-2019 academic year, citing lower student populations in the city of Farmington Hills. The school building was purchased by the city and developed into a recreation and performing arts center named The Hawk in tribute to the school. Construction began in fall 2019 and the center opened on June 7, 2021.
