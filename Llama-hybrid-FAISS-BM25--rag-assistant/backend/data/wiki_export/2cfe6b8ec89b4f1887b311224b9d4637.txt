Whitwell railway station  serves the village of Whitwell in Derbyshire, England. The station is on the Robin Hood Line 4¾ miles (7 km) south west of Worksop towards Nottingham.

History
The line and station were built by the Midland Railway. The station was designed by the Midland Railway company architect John Holloway Sanders. They were opened for passenger traffic on 1 June 1875. When the line opened two railway companies provided services through Whitwell:
 The Midland Railway (MR) ran three trains a day from Mansfield through Whitwell, which then turned right at Woodend Junction to Worksop, as all Robin Hood Line trains do now. They then continued on to . 
 The Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MSLR) ran three daily trains from Mansfield through Whitwell which turned left at Woodend Junction to  then several stops to their station in Sheffield, later to be renamed .

Over time the direct Mansfield-Whitwell-Sheffield service was diverted to Worksop. From 1 October 1905, the MR took over all services and ran them all to Worksop, where passengers for Sheffield could change trains. This core service continued until closure for passenger traffic in October 1964, though freight traffic continued. The station was dismantled and rebuilt, brick by brick, at the heritage railway at Butterley in 1981.

The line reopened in stages through the 1990s, with the final, northernmost, section from  through Whitwell to  reopening in 1998. The modern Whitwell station is on the original site, but a wholly new structure.
