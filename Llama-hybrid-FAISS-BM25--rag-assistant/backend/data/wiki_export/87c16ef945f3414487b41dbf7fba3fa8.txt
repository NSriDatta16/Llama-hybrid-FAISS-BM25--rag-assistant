Jesse Carlyle "J. C." Snead (born October 14, 1940) is an American professional golfer who won tournaments on both the PGA Tour and Champions Tour. Snead is the nephew of hall of famer Sam Snead.

Snead, who prefers that people called him by his middle name, Carlyle, was born in Hot Springs, Virginia, where his father worked at The Homestead resort. He attended East Tennessee State University in Johnson City, Tennessee, where he was a member of Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity. He played pro baseball in the Washington Senators farm system before becoming a professional golfer in 1964. He joined the PGA Tour in 1968.

Snead won eight tournaments on the PGA Tour, four on the Champions Tour, and one in international competition. He was a member of the 1971, 1973, and 1975 Ryder Cup teams. Snead's biggest career disappointment is that he never won a major championship on the PGA Tour; however, he made his career mark as one of the tour's most consistent players, with more than seven million dollars in career earnings. Snead recorded two runner-up finishes in majors: 2nd at 1973 Masters Tournament and in a tie for 2nd at the 1978 U.S. Open. He was also twice runner-up in The Players Championship, in 1974 and 1976, behind Jack Nicklaus on both occasions.

In 2003, Snead was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame.

In his free time Snead enjoys hunting and farming. He has one son, Jason, who was born in 1978. He currently resides in Hobe Sound, Florida.
