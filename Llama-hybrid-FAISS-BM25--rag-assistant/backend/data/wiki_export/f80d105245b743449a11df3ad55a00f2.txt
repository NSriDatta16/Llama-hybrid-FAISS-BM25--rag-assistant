Orussoidea is a superfamily of sawflies. It contains the living family Orussidae, as well as the extinct families Burmorussidae and Paroryssidae. They are the group of sawflies closest to the Apocrita, the group containing wasps, bees and ants, with both groups together forming the clade Euhymenoptera. Like most members of Apocrita, but unlike other sawflies, members of the superfamily are parasitoids.

Burmorussidae is the earliest diverging group, with the Paroryssidae more closely related to modern Orussidae. The infraorder Orussomorpha was proposed for the grouping of Orussoidea with Karatavitidae, however Karatavitidae is now considered to be more basal than the clade consisting of Orussoidea and Apocrita (Euhymenoptera)
