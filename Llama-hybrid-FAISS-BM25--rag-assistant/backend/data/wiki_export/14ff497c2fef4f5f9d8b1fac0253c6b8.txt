Location and features
The falls are situated at the foot of the southern face of Mount Bartle Frere in Wooroonooran National Park. They descend from the Atherton Tableland at an elevation of  above sea level in the range of  near a popular recreation site as the water flows over a large rock to form a natural waterslide on Josephine Creek, a tributary of the Russell River.

Access to falls is via a sealed road off the Bruce Highway between Babinda and Innisfail. The natural rock slide can be dangerous and the occasional flash flooding occurs without warning, with a sudden increase in the water volume.
