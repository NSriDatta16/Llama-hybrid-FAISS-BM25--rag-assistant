Araucania is an invalid genus of braconid wasps in the family Braconidae, found in South America. There are at least two described species in Araucania.

The valid genus Araucania Pate 1947, in the family Sapygidae, has nomenclatural precedence over the braconid name, published in 1993, so the latter name must be replaced, following the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature Article 52.2.
