London Buses route 176 is a Transport for London contracted bus route in London, England. Running between Penge and Tottenham Court Road station, it is operated by London Central.

History

Upon being re-tendered, the route was retained by Arriva London with a new contract commencing on 14 November 2003.

On 3 January 2009 the route was withdrawn between Tottenham Court Road and Oxford Circus to allow Andrew Borde Street to be closed and used as a work site for the upgrade of Tottenham Court Road station and the construction of the Crossrail station. In January 2010, Transport for London claimed this shortening of route 176 as part of its implementation of the Mayor's request to reduce the bus flow in Oxford Street by 10% in each of 2009 and 2010.
