Hans-Georg Aschenbach (born 20 October 1951) is a former East German ski jumper.

In 1969 he became junior world champion, and two years later won his first national title. He won the FIS Ski Flying World Championships in 1973. In 1974 he won the Four Hills Tournament, and both ski jumping events at the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships in Falun. Owing to these achievements he was named the East German sportspersonality of the year. He sat out most of 1975 due to a knee injury, but recovered by the 1976 Winter Olympics, where he took the gold medal in the individual normal hill event.

Aschenbach retired right after the Olympics to work as a military and sports doctor. In 1988, while serving as the physician of the East German ski jumping team, he defected into West Germany, where he worked as an orthopedic surgeon.
