Synopsis
Pussy is at Jimmy Altieri's social club when FBI agents conduct a raid and find a stash of guns. Jimmy and Pussy are both arrested, and Pussy is released on bail soon after. Vin Makazian relays intelligence to Tony that Pussy is an FBI informant. Tony doesn't want to believe it, but Vin points out how easily Pussy managed to get off from the raid. Tony insists on seeing the official report with Pussy's name on it, but Vin is unable to obtain it.

Pussy has stopped collecting payments because of back pain but Paulie, who sees the same doctor, has been told there is nothing wrong with Pussy's back. Tony asks Dr. Melfi's opinion; back pain, she says, might be caused by stress, such as the burden of a secret. Tony tells Paulie not to act until Pussy's wire is seen, so Paulie insists that Pussy go to a bathhouse with him; Pussy refuses to undress, saying that his doctor told him that heat is bad for him. Silvio discovers that Vin owes Pussy $30,000, which he believes may be his motive to have Pussy "disappear." Tony visits Pussy at home and questions him sympathetically, but Pussy doesn't respond. Tony is distrustful and confused; he tells Paulie he feels he is walking into walls.

Vin has a personal relationship with the madam of a bordello, and he is there when the police raid it. After his release from custody, Vin commits suicide by jumping off a bridge. Jimmy is bailed out and visits Tony at his home; Tony is surprised that he was freed so soon. Jimmy asks some intrusive questions about the Colombian drug heist. Tony evades the questions, which confirm his suspicion that Jimmy is the rat: he and Pussy were arrested at the same time, and Vin's source mixed up the "two fat fucks with black hair." Pussy is no longer suspected, but he has disappeared.

Uncle Junior visits Livia, who is bitter that Tony has sold her house. She tells Junior that several capos have placed their mothers at the Green Grove retirement community and hold meetings there. Junior instantly suspects that they are conspiring with Tony against him and decides that he has to act. He assigns Mikey and Chucky Signore to find hitmen from out of town.
