Appleton West High School (or AWHS, formerly known as Appleton Senior High School or Appleton High School) is a comprehensive public secondary school located in Appleton, Wisconsin that serves students in the ninth through twelfth grades. The school was founded in 1915 under the name Appleton Senior High School, but the current facility was constructed in 1938, and the name was changed to West High in 1967 following the construction of Appleton East High School. The current principal is Mark McQuade, Ed.D, who was awarded the Herb Kohl Educational Foundation Principal Leadership Award in 2022.

One of the three public four-year high schools in the Appleton Area School District (AASD), West High also offers two charter academies: Appleton Technical Academy (A-TECH) and the Renaissance School of the Arts (RSA). These institutions are fully accredited by the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction. Appleton West is also a member of the Fox Valley Association athletic conference.

Appleton West received the Wisconsin RtI Center School of Distinction Award for three years in a row from 2014 to 2016; as of the 2019–20 school year, they remain recognized for behavior and merit. According to the Fox Valley Association, 40 students of West High have been given a "Student-Athlete Spotlight" for excellent performance since the 2014–15 school year.

As of the 2019–20 school year, West High had an enrollment of 1,336 students and 69.51 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis) for a student-teacher ratio of 19.22. There were 420 students (31.44% of students) eligible for free lunch and 86 (6.44% of students) eligible for reduced-cost lunch.

History
In 1881, Ryan High School was constructed following the decision to unify Appleton into one school district (). On January 26, 1904, Ryan High School was destroyed in a fire and rebuilt as Union High School in the same year, at the cost of $92,000 (~$2,690,700 today). In 1938, students were relocated to the newly built Appleton High School so that Union High School could become the Carrie E. Morgan Elementary School. In 1967, construction on Appleton East High School was completed, and Appleton High School would become West High as a result. In the same year, following the death of Carrie E. Morgan, the elementary school in her name would be converted into the Morgan Administration Building and, as of today, remains as such.

On March 13, 1970, an arson fire caused by a Molotov cocktail would set Appleton West ablaze, damaging one classroom and a faculty room as a result. Although a perpetrator was never caught, some believe that it had to do with a rise in political climate at the time, supported by similar happenings from radical activist movements such as the Weather Underground Organization and the Student Strike of 1970.

West High's mascot is the 'Terror', a fictional animal representing a genetic hybrid between a wolf and a fox, as the school is situated in between the Wolf and Fox Rivers. This mascot would be depicted for the first time in 1944 as an orange canine on a blue background, but would receive multiple redesigns in 1969, 1982, 1989, 1991, and 1993 until finally deciding on a minimalist design of a Terror head and the letters 'AW' in a vibrant orange and blue.

In August 2014, a new football stadium was built on school grounds, but lacked the proper seating requirements issued by the FVA. Home games were played at Lawrence University's Banta Bowl, as well as Neinhaus Field, Appleton North, Appleton East, and Einstein Middle School until the seating requirement was satisfied.

Structure 
As of the 2019–20 school year, Appleton West has a modified school day that lasts from 8:15 AM to 3:50 PM. The beginning and end of each day (8:15 AM to 9:20 AM / 3:15 PM to 3:50 PM) is reserved for 'Student Support Time', or SST, that serves as a study hall, followed by an eight-period block schedule that alternates daily (commonly referred to as the "Monday-Thursday" and "Tuesday-Friday" schedules). Periods 1-4 are taken on Mondays and Thursdays, while Periods 5-8 are taken on Tuesdays and Fridays. Each period lasts 75 minutes, and there is a 30-minute homeroom period that serves as a 'lunch hour' and/or additional study time every day from 12:05 PM to 12:35 PM. Students are not required to attended classes on Wednesdays, as those days are fully dedicated to SST, but are expected to continue working from home using Chromebooks issued by the AASD; however, RSA students are given mandatory class periods on Wednesdays.

As well as hosting daily rehearsals after school hours, the Appleton West Theatre constructs and paints their own sets from scratch over the weekends leading up to the opening day.
