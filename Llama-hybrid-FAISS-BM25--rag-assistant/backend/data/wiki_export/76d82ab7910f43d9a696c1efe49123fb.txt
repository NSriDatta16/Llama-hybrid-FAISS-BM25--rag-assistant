Cork Borough was a parliamentary constituency represented in Dáil Éireann, the lower house of the  Oireachtas (the Irish parliament), from 1921 to 1969. The method of election was proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote (PR-STV).

History and boundaries
The constituency was created by the Government of Ireland Act 1920 as a 4-seat constituency for the Southern Ireland House of Commons from the Cork City constituency in which Cork had been represented in the United Kingdom House of Commons at Westminster since 1801. The constituency would have continued as a single-seat constituency at Westminster.

At the 1921 election for the Southern Ireland House of Commons, the four seats were won uncontested by Sinn Féin, who treated it as part of the election to the Second Dáil. It was never used as a Westminster constituency; under s. 1(4) of the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act 1922, no writ was to be issued "for a constituency in Ireland other than a constituency in Northern Ireland". Therefore, no vote was held in Cork Borough at the 1922 United Kingdom general election on 15 November 1922, shortly before the Irish Free State left the United Kingdom on 6 December 1922.

Under the Electoral Act 1923, it became a 5-seat constituency and was first used at the 1923 general election. Its representation fluctuated between 4 and 5 seats until its abolition for the 1969 general election.
