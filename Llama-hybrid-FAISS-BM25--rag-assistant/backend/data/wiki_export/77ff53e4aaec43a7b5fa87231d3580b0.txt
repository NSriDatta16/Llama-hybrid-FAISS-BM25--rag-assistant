History

The municipality of Skjørn was established on 1 January 1899 when the old municipality of Bjugn was split into three separate municipalities: Bjugn (population: 1,256), Skjørn (population: 2,166), and Nes (population: 1,285). In 1918, the spelling of the name was changed from Skjørn to Stjørna. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the northern part of the municipality (Nord-Stjørna) (population: 676) was merged with the neighboring municipalities of Bjugn (population: 1,240), Nes (population: 1,107), and Jøssund (population: 1,917) to form a new, larger municipality of Bjugn. The southern part of Stjørna municipality (Sør-Stjørna) (population: 1,868) was merged with the neighboring municipality of Rissa (population: 3,264) and most of the municipality of Stadsbygd (population: 1,616) to form a new, larger municipality of Rissa.
