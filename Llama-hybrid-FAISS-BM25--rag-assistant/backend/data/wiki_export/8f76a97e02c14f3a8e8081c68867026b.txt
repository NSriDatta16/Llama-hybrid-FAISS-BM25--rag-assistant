The Shadowthrone is the second studio album by the Norwegian black metal band Satyricon. It was released on September 12, 1994, by Moonfog Productions. A newly remastered version was released on May 28, 2021, with different artwork.

Style
The band has described The Shadowthrone as "an atmospheric and symphonic album with a strong Nordic touch. There are fewer acoustic guitars and medieval influences, and it is harsher and grimmer than the debut Dark Medieval Times, but it still maintains the atmosphere set forth in their debut album."
