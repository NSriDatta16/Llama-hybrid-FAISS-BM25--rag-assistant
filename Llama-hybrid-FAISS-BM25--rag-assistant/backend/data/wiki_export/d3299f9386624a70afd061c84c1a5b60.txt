Life and career
Born in Staten Island, New York, Sexton made his film debut in Todd Solondz's Welcome to the Dollhouse playing the troubled bully Brandon McCarthy, for which he was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award. He was the lead in Hurricane Streets and Desert Blue and also appeared in Boys Don't Cry, Black Hawk Down, and Just Like the Son, as well as the cult films Empire Records and Pecker.

2002 radio interview and alleged blacklisting by Hollywood
In a 2002 radio interview, Sexton said that the version of the film Black Hawk Down, in which he briefly appeared, which made it onto theater screens was significantly different from the one recounted in the original script. According to him, many scenes asking hard questions of the U.S. troops with regard to the violent realities of war, the true purpose of their mission in Somalia, etc., were cut out.

Sexton has said in interviews that speaking out against the film led to him getting "blacklisted" and prevented him from getting work in major films.
