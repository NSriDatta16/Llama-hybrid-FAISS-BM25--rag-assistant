Facilities

Kelana Jaya has a wealth of recreational facilities. One major attraction in Kelana Jaya is the Kelana Jaya Youth Park in SS7. Many people from other areas of Petaling Jaya and the neighbouring Subang Jaya come to this park on weekends to unwind and relax among the greenery. Fishing in the largest lake is also popular. Next to the park is a collection of community recreational facilities such as a public swimming pool and courts for badminton, futsal, hockey, and tennis. The 20,000-seater Petaling Jaya Stadium is also located near the park. The Perbadanan Kemajuan Negeri Selangor Sports Complex is very popular and further down the expressway from the lake park.

Commerce

In May 2012, a large shopping centre called Paradigm Mall opened in SS7. It has a cinema, a Lotus's supermarket, plenty of retail stores and eateries, and is located right at the centre of Kelana Jaya, within walking distance from most of the housing estates. 

Every year, a street bazaar opens daily on Jalan SS6/1 during the fasting month of Ramadhan, selling plenty of local delights in time for the evening breaking of fast or fasts.
