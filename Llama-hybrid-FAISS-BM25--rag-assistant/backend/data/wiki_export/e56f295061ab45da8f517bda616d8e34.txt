The Gold Leaf Awards of 1970, which were the first Juno Awards, were founded by RPM Magazine to honour Canadian music industry achievements. The magazine had honoured musicians in the previous six years using a reader survey until this formal ceremony.

These awards were presented at St. Lawrence Hall in Toronto on 23 February 1970. 250 people attended this inaugural awards ceremony, twice the number who were invited. Winners received walnut wood trophies that resembled metronomes. George Wilson of CFRB radio was master of ceremonies for these awards and for the subsequent Juno Awards ceremonies until 1974.
