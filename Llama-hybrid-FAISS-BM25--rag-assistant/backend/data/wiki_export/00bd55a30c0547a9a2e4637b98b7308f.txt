Before being called Ayolas, it was known as "Paraje San Josemí", in accordance with the foundation decree that established that Ayolas should be founded in Coratei, but because the founders found that Coratei was a desolate place, they decided to found Ayolas in Paraje San Jose mi, which was a Jesuit port, and had a certain amount of population, had a church, plaza and had more status than that of Coratei for that reason Ayolas was founded in San Jose Mi and not in Coratei.

History 
The city of Ayolas was founded in 1840 by Patricio Aquino, on a request made by José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia.

In Ayolas, the Binational Entity of Yacyreta is located within the city area. When the dam was being built, the city was projected from scratch right next to the original town settlement (also known as "el pueblo" locally) so that the workforce could be properly lodged. As such the Villa Permanente was raised in 1979 as a model town with 4 basic house models in a very organize arrangement, as well as modern schools, malls, water treatment plant, hospital, police stations, and a bus terminal. As the dam project advanced and more workforce was needed the same process led to the creation of the “Mil viviendas” (thousand houses) or "Nucleo 1" and then "Nucleo 2" housing neighborhoods in the mid-1980s. These housing solutions were offered free of charge to workers to encourage them to move from more populated cities. In most cases, the regular utilities as potable water, electricity, and phone were covered by the employer, at least until the late '90s.
