History
John Graham of Claverhouse (1648–1689), known to history as "Bonnie Dundee" or "Bluidy Clavers" by his supporters and detractors respectively, was the laird of Claverhouse. The Graham family, including John Graham, owned the area of Claverhouse in the 1600s. References to John Graham and his viscountcy were used for street names as part of the Claverhouse Braes community.

The Claverhouse Bleachworks factory opened in the late 1770s and closed in the 1970s. Claverhouse Bleachfield had a chimney and a counting house which housed a bell and a clock tower. The bell has been removed although the clock tower and the chimney of the bleachwork factory still stand in Claverhouse.

The nearby Trottick Ponds were used for the Claverhouse Bleachworks factory as a power source.

Private residential communities such as Claverhouse Braes, Claver Mill, Emmock Woods and Dalclaverhouse were constructed in Claverhouse from the late 1990s to the early 2020s.
