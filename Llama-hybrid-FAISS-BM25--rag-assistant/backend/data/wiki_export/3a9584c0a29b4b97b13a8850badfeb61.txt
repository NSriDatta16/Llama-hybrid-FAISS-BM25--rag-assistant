Kincorth is a suburb located to the south of Aberdeen, Scotland. The name is a corruption of the Scottish Gaelic "Ceann Coirthe", which probably refers to an old pillar or standing stone (coirthe). Kincorth is known as the garden estate of Aberdeen, and its plan originated in a competition launched in 1936 and won by Robert Gardner-Medwin, Denis Winston and Clifford Holliday.
