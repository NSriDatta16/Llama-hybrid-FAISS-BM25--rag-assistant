History

WTTO
1520 AM in Toledo, Ohio was established in 1966. Its first call sign being WTTO, it was known as "Weetow 15" with a Top 40 format to compete with 1470 WOHO (now defunct) and 1560 WTOD (Now WWYC). It also competed with 800 CKLW from Detroit/Windsor, Ontario. The station had its studios on the 4th floor of the Commodore Perry Hotel in Downtown Toledo.

In 1975, the call sign was changed to WTUU. The station switched to a country music format becoming known as "Fun Country W-15-2".

WANR, WGOR, WVOI
Sometime later, 1520 AM adopted an all-news radio format with the call sign WANR featuring programming from NBC Radio's News and Information Service. The news format was unsuccessful and the station was sold. The call sign was changed to WGOR in 1976; the station took on a religious format. With yet another change in ownership, the call sign was later changed to WVOI.
