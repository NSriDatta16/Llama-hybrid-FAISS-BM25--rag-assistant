Jewish Broadcasting Service (JBS) is an American Jewish television network. JBS programming includes daily news reports from Israel, live event coverage and analysis, and cultural programming of interest to the North American Jewish community. The network is a full-time HD and SD channel. It is an English-language network produced by the non-profit organization Jewish Education in Media (JEM) (not to be confused with Jewish Educational Media, distributors of Chabad Lubavitch movement materials). The goal of this organization is to reach out to lesser affiliated Jews and bring them closer to their Jewish religion and Identity.
