History
In 1924 the Orange Schools were consolidated from the individually operated Orange Township public schools. That year, the Foreman family donated the first  of property to ultimately comprise a  school district campus and the first Orange Schools building was opened on the current site of the high school. In 1973, the current Orange High School's contemporary structure was expanded upon, built around and opened on the site of the original school building. 

The Orange School District serves more than 2,200 students living in Hunting Valley, Moreland Hills, Orange Village, Pepper Pike, and Woodmere. Students living in portions of Bedford Heights, Solon and Warrensville Heights also attend Orange Schools.
