Badia (;  ) is a comune (municipality) in South Tyrol, northern Italy. It is one of the five Ladin-speaking communities of the Val Badia which is part of the Ladinia region.

Geography

The municipal area stretches on the Gran Ega river in the southern, upper part of the Val Badia (Abteital). It is surrounded by the steep limestone peaks of the scenic Dolomites mountain range. Part of the comune lies in Alta Badia, a ski resort at the top end of the Val Badia valley.

Badia is accessible by road from La Val (Wengen) in the north, located about half-way down to the Puster Valley at Bruneck. In the south, the valley road leads up to three mountain passes: Valparola Pass, connecting Badia with Cortina d’Ampezzo, Campolongo Pass linking the neighbouring comune of Corvara with the Arabba ski resort, and Gardena Pass leading to Val Gardena (Gröden). All pass roads may be temporarily closed during harsh winter conditions.

Frazioni
The municipality of Badia contains the frazioni (subdivisions, mainly villages and hamlets) La Ila (La Villa, Stern), San Ciascian (San Cassiano, St. Kassian), and Badia proper consisting of Pedraces (Pedratsches) and San Linêrt (San Leonardo, St. Leonhard) west and east of the Gran Ega river.

History

Since the 12th century, the valley estates belonged to the possessions held by the Benedictine nunnery of Sonnenburg near St. Lorenzen, hence the name Abtei ("abbey") first mentioned in a 1325 deed. The nuns had received the lands from the Aribonid counts, who formerly ruled as count palatines in Bavaria. A first parish church was erected in 1347.

While the Puster Valley in the south was held by the Counts of Görz at Lienz, the Ladin language and culture in the Val Badia, due to the remote location, have been preserved up to today. Upon the extinction of the House of Görz in 1500, the estates were inherited by the Austrian House of Habsburg. The Sonnenburg monastery was secularised by order of Emperor Joseph II in 1785. The valley road, originally a bridle path, was rebuilt from 1885 onwards and opened in 1892.

Coat of arms
The emblem is that of the Winkler von Colz zu Rubatsch noble family which, in the 16th and 17th century, had property and the castle at La Ila. The shield is party per fess, at the top is represented a sable steinbock, holding with the front hoofs a red broken branch on an or background. The lower part is divided into three, with vertex at the top, alternating gules and argent with a rose in the center; every rose has the central petal in or. The emblem was granted in 1967.
