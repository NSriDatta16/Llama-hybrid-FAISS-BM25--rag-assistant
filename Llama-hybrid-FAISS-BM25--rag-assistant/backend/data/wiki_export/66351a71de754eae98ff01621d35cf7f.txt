History 
Alcalá de los Gazules was first populated by the Romans in CE189 and supplied them with food, oil, wine, and metal.  During Roman occupation, the city was known as Lascuta. As the Roman empire weakened, the Vandals moved in and renamed the area Valdalusia but they lasted only twenty years, 409–429.  They were followed by the Visigoths who left behind the impressive tower, the Mesa de Esparragal.

For many years until the Catholic Ferdinand and Isabella took control, at the end of the 15th century of the last Muslim kingdom in the south of Spain, there was a demarcation line between the Islamic and Christian regions, along which sat towns that are now known as the pueblos blancos, the white towns, and Alcalá was on the border.  Many of these towns were fortified and Alcalá has a number of towers around its perimeter, now fallen into disrepair.

Following the Catholic consolidation in Spain, many mosques were knocked down and in Alcalá, the famous church of San Jorge in the top square was built in the mid-16th century on top of the ruins of the old mosque.
