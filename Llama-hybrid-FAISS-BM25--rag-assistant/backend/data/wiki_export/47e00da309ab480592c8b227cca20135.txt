A Comprehensive Retrospective Or: How We Learned to Stop Worrying and Release Bad and Useless Recordings is a compilation album by hardcore punk band Shai Hulud. It is a collection of live recordings and early demos and was co-released via the band's own record label, At Dawn We Wage War Records, in collaboration with Revelation Records, on January 25, 2005. The title is a play on the film Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.

Tracks 1-6 are the original Shai Hulud demo, with Damien Moyal on vocals. 

Tracks 7-9 are live recordings from the Crucial Chaos radio show at WNYU in 1997. 

Track 10 is a brief recording of Damien Moyal saying, "The end, the end. Stop now. All you're gonna get after this is bullshit." 

Track 11 is message left on Matt Fox's answering machine by his friends mocking the fact that the band's name was misspelled on the first 5,000 copies of their EP "A Profound Hatred of Man". 

Tracks 12-15 are taken from a practice session. Track 16 is a guitar only demo version of "This Wake I Myself Have Stirred". 

Tracks 17-19 are demo recordings with Chad Gilbert on vocals. Tracks 20-24 are scratch tracks recorded by Matt Fox in 1995.
