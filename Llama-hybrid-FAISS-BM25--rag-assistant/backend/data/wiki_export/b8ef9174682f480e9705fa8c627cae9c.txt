Live Phish Vol. 6 was recorded live on the first night of a three night stand at the Worcester Centrum in Worcester, Massachusetts, on November 27, 1998.

The show is best known for its repeated relapses into the classic Surfaris favorite "Wipeout," which made two appearances by itself during the concert and one during the middle of "Weekapaug Groove." The band was extremely loose and playful on this night, launching into a spontaneous version of The English Beat's  1980 ska hit "Mirror in the Bathroom" while still in the middle of "Chalk Dust Torture," and also breaking out the only blues version of "Dog Log" in the song's history.

Also, the band extended the ending of "Weekapaug Groove" into its own individual jam, resulting in the entire "Weekapaug Groove" segment clocking in at over twenty minutes.

This concert remains one of Phish's most popular performances from the 1998 fall tour.

Live Phish Vol. 6 marked the first time that "Runaway Jim" had appeared on an official Phish release, despite having been part of the band's concert repertoire since 1990. "Vultures", "Buried Alive", "Dog Log", "I Am Hydrogen", "Buffalo Bill" and the band's cover of The Mustangs' "Ya Mar" all also made their debut on a commercially available Phish recording.
