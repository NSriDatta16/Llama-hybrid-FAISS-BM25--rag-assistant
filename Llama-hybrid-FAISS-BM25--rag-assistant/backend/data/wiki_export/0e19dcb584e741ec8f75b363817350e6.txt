A lemon-lime soft drink or lemon-lime soda (also known as lemonade in the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand and as cider in Japan and South Korea) is a carbonated soft drink with lemon and lime flavoring.

Description
Lemon-lime soft drinks are typically colorless, however cloudy varieties such as Limca are also available. Similar in appearance and flavor to the clear variety of lemonade found in the UK and Australia, lemon-lime soft drinks are often packaged in green bottles to better distinguish them from soda water.
