URININE Records was an independent record label started by Sid Sowder in Indianapolis in 1994.  The record label shared its name with his zine.  In the years that followed, the record label would move with Sowder to Kansas City and ultimately to Boston.  He folded the label on July 4, 2004 citing the increased commercialization of the indie music scene.

Tribute albums

URININE released a series of tribute albums to bands unpopular in the indie rock scene at the time.  The first was a tribute to Creedence Clearwater Revival that included "Lodi" as performed by Pound WI, "Lookin' Out My Back Door" performed by Squidboy, "Who'll Stop the Rain" performed by Ruined in a Day, and "Fortunate Son" performed by Sohcahtoa.  The Ruined in a Day cover was particularly curious as the band never actually sung the song's namesake chorus.  In 2000 URININE released "The Wrong Way Home: A Tribute to Supertramp" which included Panoply Academy Corps of Engineers performing a medley of "Dreamer" and "Crime of the Century," Free Range Pilgrim performing "Breakfast in America," Not Funny Anymore performing "Bloody Well Right," and Hell on Wheels performing "The Logical Song."  The latter became a surprise hit in the band's native Sweden, despite the fact that the band had never heard the song before being presented the original by Sowder.  In 2001 "Sweet 16s Turned 31: a Tribute to Bob Seger" was released featuring [DARYL] performing "Mainstreet," The Hillary Step performing "Against the Wind," Saraswati performing "Feel Like a Number" and Sweep the Leg Johnny performing "Night Moves." Although Sweep The Leg Johnny was known for its math rock style, the band's cover was understated and quiet, allowing vocalist Steve Sostak to sing rather than perform in his usual yelping style.  The final tribute album was entitled "No Escape: A Tribute to Journey" and included The Ohms performing "Anytime," Houston performing "Send Her My Love," wafflehouse performing "Separate Ways (Worlds Apart)," and Traindodge performing "Only the Young."  "Anytime" was originally to be performed by Shiner however during the mix down, frontman Allan Epley decided to scrap what had been recorded and instead re-record the song himself using only drummer Jason Gerken's drum tracks.  Epley chose the name The Ohms for this one-off project.
