Emoh is a solo album by Lou Barlow, the first with his real name; the album was released in the USA in 2005 by Domino and by Merge Records and recorded in 2004.

Rolling Stone gave the album 3 stars out of 5 and noted: "[F]ull of quiet lyricism and Nick Drake beauty..." Uncut (p. 108) gave 4 stars out of 5 and said: "Using acoustic guitar, piano and vocals, he delivers 14 sweetly somber neo-folk tunes that reveal just how subtly persuasive the man's influence really is."

The album was recorded when Barlow was "in a better place" after some years of struggling due to Sebadoh's hiatus, John Davis leaving The Folk Implosion and personal problems. When the album was re-released in 2020, Barlow reflected: "Though Emoh was an overwhelmingly positive step forward for me, listening now, I realize the songs have a lot of pain in them. They clearly track the slow dissolution of my first marriage, the fatal break of several partnerships, and my struggle to acclimate to living in LA. Emoh is primarily an acoustic LP with live performances at its core, and that was a personal achievement for me. I’m still very pleased with it."
