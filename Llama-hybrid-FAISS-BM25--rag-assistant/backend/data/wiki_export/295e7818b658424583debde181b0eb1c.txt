"When I Get You Alone" is the debut single of American singer Robin Thicke—under the name Thicke—released on September 23, 2002. It was originally to be featured on his debut studio album Cherry Blue Skies, before being placed on a revamped version of that album called  A Beautiful World. The song became a top-20 hit in Australia, Flanders, Italy, the Netherlands, and New Zealand, entering the top 10 in the latter two regions.

Writing and inspiration
The track samples Walter Murphy's "A Fifth of Beethoven", which is based on Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. Songwriting credits thus went to "Murphy/Thicke".
