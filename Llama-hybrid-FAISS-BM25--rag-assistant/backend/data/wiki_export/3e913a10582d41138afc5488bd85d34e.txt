Plot
Christie Ryder (Dickey), a telephone linewoman and aerobics instructor, is possessed by the evil spirit of a fallen ninja warrior by his Ninjat≈ç, Christine, coming to his aid. The spirit uses her body to carry out his revenge on the police officers who killed him. One of them is Billy Secord (Bennett), who catches Christie's eye yet cannot explain her preoccupation with Japanese culture or help her with her sudden blackouts. Out of options, they turn to a Japanese exorcist, Miyashima (Hong), who manages to summon the ninja within her. The exorcist reveals that he cannot force the spirit out of Christie but that "only a ninja can destroy a ninja". Christie and Billy are forced to seek the aid of Goro Yamada (Kosugi), a ninja hunting the assassin within her for killing his clan. The three force the ninja out in a dangerous gambit that results in the spirit repossessing his own dead body and fighting Yamada to death, finally freeing all three of the curses of the black ninja.
