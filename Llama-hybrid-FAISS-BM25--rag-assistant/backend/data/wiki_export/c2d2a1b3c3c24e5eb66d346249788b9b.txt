History
During the Qing Dynasty the Nenjiang provided an important communication route between southern Manchuria and the cities of Qiqihar and Mergen, both of which served at various points as capitals of the Qing Heilongjiang. A portage road connected the upper reaches of the Nenjiang with Aigun on the Amur as well.

In November 1931, the bridge over the Nen River near Jiangqiao became the site of one of the first battles of the Second Sino-Japanese War.
