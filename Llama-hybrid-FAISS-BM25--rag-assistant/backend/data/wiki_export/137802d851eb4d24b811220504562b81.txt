The Bomber Brigade () was a World War II unit of the Polish Air Force commanded by płk obs. Władysław Heller. It resisted the Invasion of Poland in 1939 as the main aerial reserve of the commander in chief and was used for bombing enemy units in central Poland.  It was created just before the war and did not have time to reach full operational readiness. Its equipment consisted of 36 modern PZL.37 Łoś medium bombers, 50 older PZL.23 Karaś light bombers, as well as 21 support planes.  It was organised into four squadrons, each in turn composed of two escadrilles.  It was similar in make-up to the Pursuit Brigade.
