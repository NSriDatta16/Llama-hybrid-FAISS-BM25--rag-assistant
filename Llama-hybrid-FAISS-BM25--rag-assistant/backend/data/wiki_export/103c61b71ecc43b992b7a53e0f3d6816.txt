Armin is an ancient Indo-European forename.

It can also be a surname, but such examples are infrequent.

 Historical records of Armin as a forename appear independently from two different sources:
 Germanic
 Armin is the modern form of Arminius who was a German prince. He is mostly known for defeating the Roman army in Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. The latinized name of "Arminius" itself comes form an ancient Germanic name that may have derived from elemental noun "ermen" which means "whole" or "universal" in essence.
 Iranic
 Armin was son of Kai Kobad who is a fantastical character in the Shahnameh book of poetry. He belonged to the Kayanian dynasty in Persian literature and mythology.
 Armin is the short form of "Āriya-bṛdāna" whose hellenized name is Ariobarzanes. He was a Persian prince and satrap who fought against Alexander the Great.
