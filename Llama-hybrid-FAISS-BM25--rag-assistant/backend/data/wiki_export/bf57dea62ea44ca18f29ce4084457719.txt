History

Sonic Unyon was founded in 1993 by Mark Milne, Sandy McIntosh of the band Tristan Psionic. At first they released their own band's music, and then began releasing and promoting music by other local bands. By 1995 Sonic Unyon had grown to be one of the largest independent labels in Canada. The basement of their headquarter often held shows, and many local musicians got jobs working for the record label and operated their own record labels out of the shop.

As of 2005, Sonic Unyon releases were distributed in the United States exclusively by Caroline Distribution.

Tim Potocic and Mark Milne created Sonic Unyon Distribution as a branch of the record label, and distributed releases in Canada from independent labels from around the world and select co-releases with other independent labels including Jagjaguwar, Nuclear Blast, WARP, Fearless and Plexifilm (including the Death Cab for Cutie tour DVD, Drive Well, Sleep Carefully).

Sonic Unyon branched out into events production, by organizing Supercrawl, the annual version of the monthly Artcrawl, which is dedicated to showcasing the arts scene in the James North region of Hamilton. The event has featured many national and international touring artists; in 2014, its attendance was estimated at 165,000.
