David Alejandro Green Casaya (December 4, 1960 – January 25, 2022) was a Nicaraguan professional baseball player who was an outfielder and first baseman in Major League Baseball (MLB). Between 1981 and 1987, he spent parts of six seasons in the MLB. He was a member of the St. Louis Cardinals for five of those years, and he also spent one season with the San Francisco Giants.

Early life
Green was born in Managua, Nicaragua, on December 4, 1960.  He was one of ten children of Edward Green Sinclair and Bertha Casaya.  His father was a very successful baseball player in Nicaragua, as an outfielder for the Cinco Estrellas club of Managua and the Nicaragua national baseball team. Green was raised in a primarily Spanish-speaking home in the primarily Creole-speaking city of Bluefields.  His sisters, Isabel and Carlota, were noted basketball players.  Green is considered to have been born in 1960, although there has been some debate about his age.

Career

Milwaukee Brewers (1979–1980)
An amateur free agent, Green signed a contract with the Milwaukee Brewers on September 24, 1978. He made his professional debut the following year with the Class A Stockton Ports of the California League. He appeared in 136 games for Stockton, batting .262 with 8 home runs and 70 RBI. Green spent the 1980 season with the Class AA Holyoke Millers of the Eastern League. He batted .291 over 129 games, hitting 8 homers and driving in 67 runs. Green's 19 triples were the most in the Eastern League that season.

Green was part of a major trade between the Brewers and St. Louis Cardinals, who later went on to face each other in the 1982 World Series. On December 12, 1980, the Brewers traded Green, Dave LaPoint, Sixto Lezcano, and Lary Sorensen to the Cardinals in exchange for Rollie Fingers, Ted Simmons and Pete Vuckovich.

For the 1981 season, Green was promoted to the Class AAA level as a member of the Springfield Redbirds. In 106 games with Springfield, he tallied a .270 batting average, 10 home runs, and 67 RBI.  He was called up by the Cardinals during the September roster expansion that year, and made his MLB debut on September 4, 1981, at the age of 20, entering as a pinch hitter and being held hitless in two plate appearances in a 7–2 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers.  Green was the youngest player in the major leagues that year, and batted only .147 during 21 appearances for the Cardinals. He earned his first MLB hit, an RBI single off Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Luis Tiant, on September 26.

Green split the 1982 season between St. Louis and the Louisville Redbirds, who had relocated from Springfield. He batted .345 in 46 games with Louisville, while recording a .283 average in 76 appearances with the Cardinals.

After splitting the 1981 and 1982 seasons between the Cardinals and their Class AAA affiliate, Green would not return to the minors until 1987. In 1983, he saw action in a career-high 146 games. He posted a .284 batting average, 8 homers, and 39 RBI, and he also recorded 34 stolen bases and 10 triples.

Green played in 126 games during the 1984 season. His average fell slightly to .268, and his stolen bases and triples decreased to 17 and 4, respectively. However, his home run total nearly doubled from the previous year, as he connected for 15 home runs and drove in 65 runs.
