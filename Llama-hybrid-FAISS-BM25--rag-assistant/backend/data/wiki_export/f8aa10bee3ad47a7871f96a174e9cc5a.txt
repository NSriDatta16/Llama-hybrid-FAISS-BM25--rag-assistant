Larry Doyle is an American novelist, television writer, and producer.

Career
Doyle got his start in 1989–1991 as an editor at Chicago-based First Comics. He started writing for television, with a 1993 and a 1994 episode of Rugrats, then regularly working on Beavis and Butt-head between 1994 and 1997,  when he joined The Simpsons as a writer and producer for seasons nine through twelve (1997–2001). Other television writing credits include one episode for Daria and two episodes for Liquid Television.

Doyle wrote the screenplays for the 2003 film releases Duplex and Looney Tunes: Back in Action. He also produced some Looney Tunes shorts that were completed in 2003. However, due to the box-office bomb of Looney Tunes: Back in Action, Warner Bros. decided not to release the shorts theatrically, releasing them  direct-to-video instead.

Doyle is a frequent contributor to The New Yorker and has also had columns in Esquire magazine, New York Magazine, and the New York Observer.

Doyle's first novel, I Love You, Beth Cooper, was published in May 2007. The setting is graduation night at Buffalo Grove High School, Doyle's alma mater. This novel won the 2008 Thurber prize for American Humor. Doyle wrote the screenplay for the film based on his novel, which was released in 2009.  Also in 2009, the book I Love You, Beth Cooper was re-released as an extended movie tie-in edition.  His second novel, Go Mutants!, was published in 2010. This novel had its film rights acquired by Imagine Entertainment/Universal Studios the same year, with the screenplay written by Doyle. Deliriously Happy (and Other Bad Thoughts), a collection of humor pieces from the New Yorker and elsewhere, was published in 2011.
