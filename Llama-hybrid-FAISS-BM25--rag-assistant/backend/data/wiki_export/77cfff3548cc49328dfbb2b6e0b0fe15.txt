Football: Best & Fairest Award / Goalkicking
Seniors
In 1929, the Bendigo Football League (BFL) decided to perpetuate the memory of the late BFL President, Mr. Fred A. Wood, with a gold medal for the best and fairest player from 1930 to 1939.

In 1946, the BFL best and fairest award was named the Arthur E. Cook Medal, in memory of the late Bendigo MLA, who died suddenly at the Victorian Parliament House in April, 1945,. For many years, Cook was associated with the administration of the BFL.

Between 1947 and 1951 the award was known as the Thomas Rees Davies Medal, after a former Bendigo Councillor, Eaglehawk Mayor and BFL President from 1935 to 1939. Davies was a former Eaglehawk footballer and club Secretary and also Secretary of the BFL too. He was made a life member of the BFL in 1926.

The Jack Michelsen Medal was first awarded in 1952, after a prominent Bendigo Mayor, long-term Councillor and BFL President from 1923 to 1925, John Andrew Michelsen, OBE. Michelsen was a journalist at the Bendigo Advertiser for many years.
