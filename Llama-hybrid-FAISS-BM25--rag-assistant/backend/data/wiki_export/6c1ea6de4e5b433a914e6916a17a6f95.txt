Haunt Me, Haunt Me Do It Again is the debut studio album by Canadian electronic musician Tim Hecker, released on November 20, 2001, on Substractif, a sub-label of Alien8 Recordings. The album mixes the digital signal processing of glitch with post-rock structures and melodies. The sounds used for this album, as well as most of Tim Heckerâ€™s other works, originate from a guitar, piano, and laptop. The title of the song "The Work of Art in the Age of Cultural Overproduction" is a reference to Walter Benjamin's essay, "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction". The track "Ghost Writing Pt. 1" samples the American television show Who Wants to be a Millionaire?.

In 2010, the album was re-released on vinyl and digipack CD.
