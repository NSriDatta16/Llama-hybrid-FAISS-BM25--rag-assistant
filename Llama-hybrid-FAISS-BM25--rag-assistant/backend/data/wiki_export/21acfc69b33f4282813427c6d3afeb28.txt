Victor Merrick Ripley (May 30, 1906 – March 26, 1962) was a Canadian hockey centerman who played seven seasons in the National Hockey League for the Chicago Black Hawks, Boston Bruins, New York Rangers, and St. Louis Eagles. He also played several years in various minor leagues during his career, which lasted from 1925 to 1944. Ripley was later a golf pro at the Desert Inn Country Club in Las Vegas. He was born in Elgin, Ontario. Ripley died of a heart attack on March 26, 1962.

Ripley scored the 1,000th regular-season goal in Boston Bruins' history. It was Boston's lone goal in a 4-1 loss to the Toronto Maple Leafs at Boston Garden on December 12, 1933. It was the same game in which Toronto's Ace Bailey suffered a horrific career-ending head injury.
