F.C. Copenhagen Handball (or simply FCK Handball) was a Danish handball team, playing in Copenhagen. They had both a male and a female team, both playing in the best Danish leagues, the Danish Handball League (men) and Danish Women's Handball League (women). FCK Handball was owned by Parken Sport & Entertainment - the same company behind the football team, F.C. Copenhagen.

After the 2009–10 season, Parken Sport & Entertainment returned the license to Frederiksberg IF. The male team squad became a part of AG København.
