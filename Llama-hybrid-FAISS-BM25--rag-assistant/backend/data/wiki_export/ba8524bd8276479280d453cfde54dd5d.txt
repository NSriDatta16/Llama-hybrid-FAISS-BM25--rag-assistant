Events

January–March
February 27 – The sacrifice fly rule is adopted. No time at bat is charged if a run scores after the catch of a fly ball. The rule will be repealed in 1931, then reinstated (or changed) several times before gaining permanent acceptance in .

April–June
June 30 – Cy Young pitches the third, and final, no-hitter of his career as the Boston Red Sox defeat the New York Highlanders, 8–0.

July–September
July 4 – One batter away from a perfect game, New York Giants pitcher Hooks Wiltse hits George McQuillan with two outs in the ninth inning.  Wiltse continues to pitch and tosses a no-hitter against the Philadelphia Phillies.  The Giants win, 1–0, in 10 innings.
August 4 – In a game between the St. Louis Cardinals and the Brooklyn Superbas only one baseball was used for the entire game. Brooklyn wins, 3–0.
September 5 – Nap Rucker pitches a no-hitter as the Brooklyn Superbas defeat the Boston Doves, 6–0.
September 18 – Cleveland Naps pitcher Bob Rhoads tosses a no-hitter against the Boston Red Sox, Cleveland wins, 2–1.
September 20 – Frank Smith of the Chicago White Sox throws a no-hitter against the Philadelphia Athletics, the White Sox win, 1–0.  It is the second no-hitter of Smith's career.
September 23 – The Chicago Cubs and New York Giants, involved in a tight pennant race, (also involving the Pittsburgh Pirates) were tied in the bottom of the ninth inning at the Polo Grounds. The Giants had runners on first and third and two outs when Al Bridwell hit a single to center field, scoring Moose McCormick from third with the Giants' apparent winning run, but the runner on first base, rookie Fred Merkle, thinking the game was over, went half way to second and then sprinted to the clubhouse after McCormick touched home plate.  As fans swarmed the field, Cub infielder Johnny Evers retrieved the ball and touched second.  A forceout was called at second base, nullifying the single, and since there were 2 outs when the play started, the run was also nullified and the inning ended.  The game was declared a tie and would be made up at the end of the season if the Cubs and Giants were tied for first place.  The incident became known as "Merkle's Boner".
September 26 – Ed Reulbach of the Chicago Cubs pitches two shutouts in the same day, whitewashing the Brooklyn Superbas 5–0 on a five-hitter and 3–0 on a three-hitter. The entire doubleheader is played in less than three hours. Reulbach allows five hits in the a.m. game, and is even stingier in the afternoon, yielding three hits and a walk. Kaiser Wilhelm and Jim Pastorius are the losing pitchers.

October–December
October 2
In a game involving the Cleveland Naps and the Chicago White Sox, Ed Walsh struck out 15 Naps and walked one batter, pitching a complete game, but it was not enough as Addie Joss pitched a perfect game, as the Naps beat the White Sox, 1–0, during the heat of a pennant race. Cleveland center fielder Joe Birmingham scored the game's only run.  Joss' perfect game is the second in the modern era and fourth all time.  It is perhaps the finest pitching duel in baseball history.
Washington Senators outfielder Otis Clymer hits for the cycle in a 12–2 Washington victory over the New York Highlanders.
October 6 – The Detroit Tigers defeat the Chicago White Sox, 7–0, to win the American League pennant on the last day of the season.
October 8 – The Chicago Cubs defeat the New York Giants, 4–2, in the make-up of "The Merkle's Boner" game, giving the Cubs the National League pennant.
October 14 – The Chicago Cubs defeat the Detroit Tigers, 2–0, in Game 5 of the World Series to win the series four games to one.  It is the second consecutive World Championship for the Cubs and the second year in a row they have defeated the Tigers in the World Series.  The Cubs did not win another World Series until 2016, when they defeated Cleveland Indians in seven games, this ended its 108 year championship drought.
October 14 – The baseball season of 1908 ends with the lowest runs per game average in major league baseball history at 3.38. This outcome was likely an important factor in the decision to trial a livelier "cork center" ball in both leagues the following season.
October 24 – "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" is introduced by singer Billy Murray. The songwriting team of Albert Von Tilzer (music) and Jack Norworth (lyrics) who created the immortal tune have never seen a game. Over the past 100 years, more than 400 musicians from every conceivable genre have recorded the song.
November 22 – In the first game ever between a Japanese and an American professional team, the Reach All-Americans defeat Waseda University in Tokyo, 5 – 0.
