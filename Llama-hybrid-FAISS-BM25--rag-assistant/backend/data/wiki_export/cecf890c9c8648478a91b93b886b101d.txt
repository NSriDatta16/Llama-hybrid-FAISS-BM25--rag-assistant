Fireworks is the third studio album by the heavy metal band Angra. It was released in 1998 on Lucretia Records. It was their last album to feature Andre Matos on vocals and Lu√≠s Mariutti on bass, and the last to feature drummer Ricardo Confessori until Aqua in 2010.

Background 

According to guitarist Kiko Loureiro, vocalist Andre Matos had decided to leave Angra right after the Holy Live tour to work on his solo project Virgo (a collaboration with Sascha Paeth), and the band had started to rehearse with Edu Falaschi as his probable replacement. However, a French executive from the record company talked to them over dinner to help patch their differences. Even so, Kiko recalls feeling that Andre was distant, mostly working on his own compositions alone instead of collaborating with the other members.
