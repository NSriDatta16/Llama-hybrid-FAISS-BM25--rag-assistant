RVHS has a choir, a concert band, a jazz band, and a vocal jazz ensemble. The music department presents a concert series each year to demonstrate student learning. There are two concerts with the concert band and concert choir and two jazz concerts. The concert band is also part of the district band concert, which includes the 5/6, 7/8 and RVHS bands.

The school's music program has collaborated with musicians such as Roswell Rudd, with the choir and jazz band performing with Roswell and his trombone shout band. The concert band commissioned and performed the world premiere of "Sinfonia Brevis" by Sean Doyle in 2008. In 2012 the concert band joined forces with The Ulster County Community Band in a program titled "Music for the Ages".

The Vocal Jazz Ensemble was invited to The LeMoyne Jazz Festival for three consecutive years, from 2011 to 2013.
