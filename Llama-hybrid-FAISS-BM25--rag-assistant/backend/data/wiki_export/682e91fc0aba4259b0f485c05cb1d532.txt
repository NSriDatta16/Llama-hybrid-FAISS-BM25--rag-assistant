History
The Howard Johnson's Regency Motor Hotel first opened in 1966. In 1977, Caesars purchased the hotel and announced it would renovate the 11-story, 425-room structure and add seven floors to the building, expanding the room count to 548, plus a 52,000 sq.ft. casino at an estimated cost of $300 million. Despite the governor of New Jersey's demands, the Casino Control Commission allowed Caesars to use the Howard Johnson building due to it being relatively new construction. The casino opened on June 26, 1979, being the second casino to open after Resorts International in 1978. The casino first opened as the Boardwalk Regency, omitting the Caesars name, as the Casino Control Commission continued to investigate the corporation. In 1983 Caesars was added to the name and it became Caesars Boardwalk Regency.

A 1985 expansion of the property included the erection of the 1100-seat Circus Maximus Showroom, replacing the 440-seat Cabaret Theater. Both venues have hosted names such as Diana Ross, Liza Minnelli, Mary J. Blige, Buddy Hackett, Ann-Margret, Paul Anka, Lionel Richie, Tina Turner, Donny and Marie Osmond, and Celine Dion. The Showroom has also held many professional boxing events.

In 1987, the name of the resort was changed to Caesars Atlantic City. Throughout the late 1990s and 2000s, Caesars expanded the Roman theme to the exterior, which originally had an art deco look. Renovations were completed in 2008, with the Boardwalk and street sides of the casino being renovated into Roman facades, along with a new parking garage and a new hotel tower.

The 25-floor Centurion Tower, added in 1997, has 610 rooms and a height of 299 ft (91 m).

In October 2017, ownership of Caesars was transferred to Vici Properties as part of a corporate spin-off, and the property was leased back to Caesars Entertainment.

On November 18, 2020, Caesars Atlantic City owner Vici Properties, which also owned the adjoining sister property Bally's Atlantic City, sold the Bally's property, but retained Bally's Wild Wild West casino to operate as part of the Caesars property. In addition to some table games and slot machines, The Wild Wild West Casino has a sports betting area which includes a bar, a jumbo-sized wrap-around video wall, and private party rooms. At the Boardwalk entrance, there is an entertainment area consisting of a performance stage before an open area that can be used as a dance floor or as dining space for the adjoining food and beverage outlets. They include the Boardwalk Saloon, which is a bar with convertible indoor/outdoor seating, and a fast food outlet, Guy's Bar-B-Que Joint. At the Pacific Avenue end of the casino, there is a World Series of Poker branded poker room which Bally's closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Under Caesars Atlantic City, the room has not reopened, its future in question.
