Editions
In 1570 the first edition of Aquinas's opera omnia, the so-called editio Piana (from Pius V, the Dominican pope who commissioned it), was produced at the studium of the Roman convent at Santa Maria sopra Minerva, the forerunner of the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum. The critical edition of Aquinas's works is the ongoing edition commissioned by Pope Leo XIII (1882-1903), the so-called Leonine Edition. Abbé Migne published an edition of the Summa Theologiae, in four volumes, as an appendix to his Patrologiae Cursus Completus.  English editions: Joseph Rickaby (London, 1872), J. M. Ashley (London, 1888).
