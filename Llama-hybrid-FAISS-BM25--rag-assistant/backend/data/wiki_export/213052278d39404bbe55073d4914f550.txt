Design details
The Kefefs rifle contains the following features:
 It has a cold-hammered, high-precision, free-floating, exposed barrel made of special high-grade steel while its receiver, bolt and all metal components are also made of special steel. 
 It uses a simple and robust bolt-action mechanism with a 50° opening angle, enables the bolt to be flexible and easy to open. The third lug of the three locking lugs located at the front of the bolt acts as a rail which gives the bolt a friction-free and smooth movement. 
 The firing mechanism incorporates an extremely quiet, thumb-operated safety the stiffness of which is adjustable.
 Designed by Athan Calligeris Ph.D. with an ergonomically and elegantly designed stock, which is made of high-quality walnut with cross-knurling, is of the Monte Carlo model.
 The trigger pull and travel can also be adjusted. A wide range of telescopic sights and sight mounts is available to suit the user's requirements, since it is the sighting system which plays an important role in sniping.
