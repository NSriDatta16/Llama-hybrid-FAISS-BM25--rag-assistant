Buarbreen or Buerbreen is a glacier in Ullensvang Municipality in Vestland county, Norway. It is an offshoot of the large Folgefonna glacier. The small glacial arm reaches down into the Buardalen valley, just  southwest of the town of Odda. The glacier is split into two parts, one on either side of a small mountain peak. Both sides drain into the Jordalselvi river which flows out through the valley into the lake Sandvinvatnet.
