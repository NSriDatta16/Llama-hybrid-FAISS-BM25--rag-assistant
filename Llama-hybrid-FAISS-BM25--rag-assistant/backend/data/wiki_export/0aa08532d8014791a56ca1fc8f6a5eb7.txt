Marten Andersson (born Mårten Andersson, 26 November 1974) is a Swedish American bass guitarist and a member of the hard rock and heavy metal groups Lita Ford, Steelheart, Lizzy Borden, George Lynch's Lynch Mob, Dario Lorina (Black Label Society).

Career 
Born as an only child, it was in the outskirts of Stockholm, that Marten developed an interest in becoming a musician after being exposed to bands such as KISS and Iron Maiden. Marten had a passion for playing various different musical instruments but soon considered bass his main instrument. Marten once asked his father to buy him a guitar only to have the guitar traded in for a bass two weeks later. At the age of 16 he had already performed shows and recorded with various local bands but he had bigger aspirations. He wanted to take on Hollywood. By the age of 18 Marten moved to Los Angeles to study music and it did not take long before he started touring the world and recording with the heavy metal band Lizzy Borden. Named after the band's lead vocalist and known for their outrageous and theatrical stage shows.

Marten Andersson spent the next decade with Lizzy Borden, recording CDs and playing/touring together with bands such as: Deep Purple, Kings X, Dio, Yngwie Malmsteen, W.A.S.P. and Motörhead. Lizzy Borden released 9 albums and toured across the U.S. South America, Canada, Europe and Asia. Hitting the top 100 4 times in the U.S., #1 on CMJ (radio). Lizzy Borden previewed their CD 'Deal With the Devil' at the 'Wacken open air Festival Germany', in front of 35 thousand people followed by a worldwide tour. Longtime Lizzy Borden fan, artist and multimedia entrepreneur Todd McFarlane (best known for his creation of Spawn and stylistic revision of Spider-Man) was enlisted to capture the essence of Lizzy Borden for the Stage show and the CD cover art. Tragedy struck the band when guitarists Alex Nelson (2004) and Corey James (2009) were killed in separate car accidents, with Nelson's resulting in the band disbanding between 2004 and 2006.

In the late 1990s Andersson played with Jessica Simpson's and Jennifer Lopez guitarist Joy Basu, as well as recording two CDs entitled 'Second to None' (1996) and 'The Rocks' (2000) with "The Jonas Hansson Band", fronted by Swedish guitar player Jonas Hansson. Hansson was considered by many as one of the first guitar heroes to emerge from Scandinavia. The group featured members from Alice Cooper, Alcatrazz, Marty Friedman Band (Megadeth) and Silver Mountain.

In 2001, Marten Andersson released a solo project entitled, Legacy with various guest musicians, including Jonas Hansson co-producing and playing lead guitar. Andersson was handling bass and rhythm guitar duties. The CD was mixed and produced by Andersson and Hansson at Mastergroove Studio's in Granada Hills, California with the assistance of Mastergroove studio owner Dave Morse (Aerosmith, Guns N' Roses, Van Halen and Warrant). The CD received excellent reviews in the hardrock, Heavy Metal press but did not generate much noise in mainstreet media.

In 2003, Marten co-founded the Hollywood rock outfit Starwood with Lizzy (Borden), Joey Scott and Joe Steals. The band, (considered by some an updated, more modern version of Lizzy Borden) released their debut CD "If It Ain't Broke, Break It!" worldwide on Metalblade Records (2005). Their signature high energy rock in the vein of Velvet Revolver, Guns N' Roses and The Darkness made Starwood popular after just only one album and has gathered airplay in many places over the World with videos for the songs 'Subculture' and 'Bad Machine'. The band did a series of successful concerts in 2005 and are said to be working on a follow-up CD but this has never been confirmed.

Bass equipment and more 
Marten has been a long time user and endorser of companies such as ESP Basses. Marten switches between 4-string electric basses and 8 string basses, mainly because of the fuller sound and his influence of bass players such as Tom Pedersson of Cheap Trick and Doug Pinnick of Kings X. "I have played ESP's for most of my life," explained Marten Andersson. "Working together with ESP, and based on my ideas and specs we have created a prototype of my first custom bass. This is a true, unique 8 string bass that has been refined in my head for a couple of years. I chose top components and the highest standards and craftsmanship that ESP offers. This bass stays in tune throughout a full headlining set and it is one of the loudest, most powerful basses I have ever heard."

This bass was supposedly designed on Marten's specifications but can be outfitted with either EMG or Seymour Duncan pickups, Schaller or Dunlop Straplocks, and Black or Chrome hardware. Featuring a standard 8 string ESP B Series neck (with a different headstock), 34" scale with 24 frets. The model incorporates a metallic red sparkle finish with star inlays as fret markers. Fretboard/inlay: rosewood/stars and Gotoh Tuners.

Marten holds bass clinics, music seminars, performs at music trade shows. Marten was the musical director for the Fender Namm Jam in Anaheim California 2006.

Marten's book "Make Label Contact" (SCI Publishing), a reference and musicians guide, aimed towards musicians for record companies and demo submissions was considered by some to be a great guide for new and upcoming musicians.
