Career

Bolton Wanderers
Ashton began his professional football career at Bolton Wanderers and, on 7 January 2006, was named as the substitute goalkeeper for Bolton's FA Cup Third Round tie against Watford. However, he came on for the last few minutes of the match as a striker, replacing Jared Borgetti. Ashton also made 18 appearances for the Bolton Wanderers Reserves during his time at the Reebok.

Described by his boss as "the best and most staunch Bolton Wanderers fan in our camp", then Bolton manager Sam Allardyce explained: "He wears a massive tattoo with the club badge on it. He comes from the heart of Bolton and he loves the club so much and is so passionate. He just asked if he could get on for a couple of minutes. We were always ready to play him outfield as he has played at right-back and centre-back for the youth team. I thought it would be a perfect late Christmas present."

Towards the end of the 2005–06 season he was told that he was free to leave Bolton and spent considerable time on trial with non-League sides such as Cambridge United and Radcliffe Borough.

F.C. United of Manchester
On 26 July 2006, he made his debut for FC United of Manchester in a friendly against Bury. He has since made his competitive debut for United of Manchester against St Helens Town, in the first game of the 2006–07 North West Counties Football League Division One season, keeping a clean sheet in a 2–0 victory for the away team, played at Knowsley Road. After 140 appearances for the club, he reached a landmark 50th clean sheet on 4 April 2009 against North Ferriby United. Against Brighton & Hove Albion in the FA Cup second round he saved a penalty in the last minute to earn United of Manchester a replay.

He scored his first career goal in a 4–0 win away to Retford United on 15 January 2011. The ball got caught up in the wind and lobbed the opposing goalkeeper.

He left the club in July 2011 in order to secure more first team football.
