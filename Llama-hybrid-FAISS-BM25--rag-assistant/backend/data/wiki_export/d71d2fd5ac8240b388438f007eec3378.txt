The 1995–96 UEFA Cup was the 25th season of Europe's then-tertiary club football tournament organised by UEFA. It was won by German club Bayern Munich on aggregate over Bordeaux of France. Girondins de Bordeaux went to the finals all the way from the 1995 UEFA Intertoto Cup, its first season, being the only Intertoto Cup entrant to reach this far of the UEFA Cup. With this victory, Bayern became the third club to have won all three major European trophies (European Cup/UEFA Champions League, UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League, and the Cup Winners' Cup). The finals itself was the only UEFA Cup final during the 1990s to not feature any Italian sides.

The 1995–96 season also saw the return of Yugoslav clubs on the international scene after three years of ban due to UN embargo. However, Yugoslav national champion, Red Star Belgrade, was eliminated as early as in the qualifying round.

Format
According to 1994 UEFA ranking, the Netherlands and Hungary lost a slot, while Israel gained one. Under a UEFA special decision, Czech Republic and Slovakia were still considered as a single country.

The access list was finally increased to 96 clubs:
 the federations with a UEFA place rose from the traditional number of 32 to 36,
 the national champions excluded from the Champions League were 23,
 two winners of the new UEFA Intertoto Cup entered into the UEFA Cup,
 3 clubs of the UEFA Fair Play ranking were added.
