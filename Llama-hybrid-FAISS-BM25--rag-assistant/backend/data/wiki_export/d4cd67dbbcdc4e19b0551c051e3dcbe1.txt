History 
In 1966, the Sisters, Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, from Pennsylvania, came to St. Cyprian Parish at the request of Rev. John Gallagher. The IHM community provided the pastor with three sisters to open the school in September 1968, with an enrollment of sixty-two students in Grades 1–3.

Adding a new grade each year, the first graduation was held in 1974. In 1985, a multi-purpose hall was constructed and, in 1986, a library was added to this facility and the Church sacristy was converted for use as a Kindergarten.

The Extended Care program was begun in 1990 and in the fall of 1991, the outdoor eating area for the students had concrete padding installed. Art classes with specialists were also begun.

A major facilities expansion was completed in 2002, including a new kindergarten room, library, science lab, computer lab, counseling and tutoring rooms, and extended care facility.  In addition, a new parish center and a renovated gymnasium complete the major overhaul of the school.
