Transmission
The DBS is equipped with a Graziano six-speed manual transaxle (initial 'launch' gearbox) and the optional 'Touchtronic 2' six-speed automatic transmission, based on the same ZF transaxle unit that was developed for the DB9, was introduced in 2008. When fitted with the Touchtronic 2 transmission, the DBS has a heavier kerb weight of .

Performance
The DBS is equipped with the 5.9-litre, 60° AM08/AM11 V12 with four valves per cylinder. The same basic engine is also used in the DBR9 and DBRS9 racing cars albeit with extensive modifications. The engine of the DBS has a power output of  at 6,500 rpm and  of torque at 5,750 rpm with a compression ratio of 10.9:1. The engine also includes an active bypass valve which above 5,500 rpm opens and lets more air into the engine resulting in increased performance and propels the car from 0 to  in 4.3 seconds and has a maximum speed of . In 2007, the British motoring show Top Gear tested the DBS around their Top Gear test track with a lap time of 1:23.9; 3.2 seconds faster than its predecessor, the Vanquish S and a second faster than the comparable Bentley Continental Supersports.

Handling
The DBS uses the Aston Martin VH platform. Due to the structure, 85% of the weight of the car is kept between the wheelbase, which results in increased handling, responsiveness and feel during tight cornering.

Aston Martin has also developed an Adaptive Damping System, or ADS, which alters the suspension in order for the car to cope with the driver's desired driving mode according to the road/weather conditions. When turned on, the ADS automatically alters the suspension settings to ensure the driver has high levels of control at all times. Apart from the suspension getting stiffer, throttle and braking response is increased and steering is sharpened.

The DBS is fitted with Pirelli P-Zero tyres developed especially for the car, along with lightweight, aluminium 20-inch wheels.

To reduce weight, Aston Martin made extensive use of carbon fibre throughout the car. The bonnet, the boot, the front wings, the door opening surrounds and the boot compartment are all made of carbon fibre. The carpets are also made by special thin layers made from carbon fibre. The roof and the doors are made of aluminium. The result is a  weight reduction as compared to the DB9.
The car is also fitted with a carbon fibre splitter at the front wings to increase handling and a carbon fibre rear diffuser to increase high-speed stability.

The brake discs are carbon ceramic, which reduces a significant  from the unsprung weight. At the front, there are  ventilated and drilled brakes with 6-piston alloy monobloc calipers. At the back, there are  ventilated and drilled brakes with 4-piston alloy monobloc calipers.

Interior
The interior of the DBS is a blend of carbon fibre, Alcantara, leather, wood, stainless steel and aluminium surfaces, depending on the buyer's specified options. The door panels are capped with carbon fibre, wood or leather, and utilise carbon fibre door pulls. The fascia is, as standard, matrix alloy and iridium silver centre console or, as an optional extra, piano black fascia and centre console. To achieve even greater weight savings, the carpet has a special lightweight weave. The car is started by means of the "Emotion Control Unit", which was initially developed especially for the DBS but became available for the DB9 and the V8 Vantage as well. The key is made from stainless steel and glass and is inserted into a special slot in the dashboard.

Film appearances

The DBS was first seen in the 2006 James Bond film Casino Royale, the first film in which Bond was played by Daniel Craig, as a result of Eon Production's desire to tie the new Bond actor to the franchise heritage with Aston Martin. The only in-car gadget featured in the film is a glovebox/safe that contains a spare pistol, silencer, and a medical kit with a defibrillator in its compartment. Bond uses the car to go to Casino Royale in Montenegro so he can find Le Chiffre. The car is later destroyed when James Bond swerves to avoid hitting Vesper, who had been used as a bait by Le Chiffre to lure Bond after being kidnapped. The cars used in the production were actually prototypes, based on DB9 test vehicles, as the film was produced well before the DBS entered production.

The DBS returned for the pre-credits car chase around Lake Garda in the 2008 Bond film Quantum of Solace. The vehicle is colored a dark metallic dark grey, referred to as "Quantum Silver" in Aston Martin's options list, and doesn't have any gadgets. In the film, Bond uses the vehicle to deliver Mr. White to M while trying to avoid his pursuers, but is later damaged as a result. The cars used in the film are 2009 model year, German-market spec DBS production vehicles.

Naming confusion
Some confusion over the name of the production version occurred when some test mules running around the Nürburgring were given DBRS9 badges. However, it would seem that this was only a trick played by the company to confuse spy photographers. The official name of the vehicle was declared to be DBS.

Production
The DBS was built in Gaydon, Warwickshire. Its engine was built at the Aston Martin engine plant in Cologne, Germany.

Production of the DBS totalled 3,400 units.
