Manfred Frederick Jaeger (9 May 1928 – 18 June 2004) was a German-born British film, television, theatre and radio character actor.

Biography
Jaeger was born in Berlin, Germany, but moved to England following Adolf Hitler's rise to power. He was educated at Lord Weymouth's Grammar School, Warminster, and the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, from which he graduated in 1948, becoming a British subject two years later. He made his first theatre appearance in 1949, and his film debut, The Black Tent, in 1956. He went on to make further film, television and radio appearances until retiring in 1996. He died in June 2004 aged 76.

He is well remembered by fans of the science fiction series Doctor Who for his roles in three serials. He appeared as Jano in The Savages in 1966, and as Professor Sorenson in Planet of Evil in 1975. In 1977's The Invisible Enemy, he appeared as Professor Marius, creator of the robot dog K-9; his performance was described by reviewer John Peel as "superb".
