"Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves" is a song by British pop duo Eurythmics and American singer Aretha Franklin. A modern feminist anthem, it was written by Eurythmics members Annie Lennox and David A. Stewart and featured on both Eurythmics' Be Yourself Tonight (1985) and Franklin's Who's Zoomin' Who? (1985) albums. The duo originally intended to perform with Tina Turner, who was unavailable at the time and so they flew to Detroit and recorded with Franklin instead. The track also features three of Tom Petty's Heartbreakers: Stan Lynch on drums, Benmont Tench on organ, and Mike Campbell on lead guitar, plus session bassist Nathan East.

Reception
Released as a single by RCA Records in October 1985, "Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves" was highly successful, reaching number 9 on the UK Singles Chart and number 18 on the US Billboard Hot 100. The song was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.

Cash Box said that the song is "a rousing, soulful tune with a driving R&B feel."  Billboard said it has "two varieties of charisma plus a furious funk production." Spin wrote, "That this hard-driving feminist anthem works so wonderfully for both women is a testament to the talent of Lennnox. Any lesser singer would have wilted and died in such company."

Music video
This music video was taped at Detroit's Music Hall. The video is interspersed with clips from old black and white films, including 1962's A Kind of Loving. The video uses the single version of the song, as opposed to the album version.
