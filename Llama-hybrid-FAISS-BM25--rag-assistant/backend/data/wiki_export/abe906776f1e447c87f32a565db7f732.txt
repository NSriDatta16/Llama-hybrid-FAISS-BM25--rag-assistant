In mathematics, two real numbers   are called conjugate indices (or Hölder conjugates) if 

  

Formally, we also define   as conjugate to  and vice versa. 

Conjugate indices are used in Hölder's inequality, as well as Young's inequality for products; the latter can be used to prove the former. If  are conjugate indices, the spaces Lp and Lq are dual to each other (see Lp space).
