The Depaldo Stone Steps (, also ) in Taganrog in Russia were constructed in 1823. They were the project of the swiss architect Francesco Boffo, with the funding of Taganrog's Greek merchant Gerasim Depaldo, at the crossroads of Greek Street (near Tchaikovsky House in Taganrog) and Depaldo Street (now Turgenevskaya Street) in Taganrog. The stairway begins up on the hill in downtown and goes down ending near the Sea of Azov foreshore (Pushkin Embankment).

In World War II, the Old Stone Steps were heavily damaged. In the 1970s they were reconstructed, but not finished. The new reconstruction was made in 2005. During the latest reconstruction all the old stone steps were replaced by new stones.
