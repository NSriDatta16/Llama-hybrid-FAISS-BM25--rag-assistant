Bulgaria has been producing films since 1915. Bulgarian cinema is known for the pioneering work of directors like Donyo Donev in the field of animation. The filming and screening of Vasil Gendov's film Bulgaran are Gallant (1915) is considered to be the beginning of Bulgarian cinematography. Historically, Bulgarian films have been noted for their realism, social themes and technical innovation.

From 1915 to 1948, when film production was nationalized, 55 films were made, but production slowed down after the beginning of World War II. During the time of the Fatherland Front government, films with a historical focus were given bigger funding. The biggest studio at that time was the Boyana Film Studio.

Notable Bulgarian film directors are Rangel Vulchanov, Christo Christov, and Georgi Djulgerov. Other filmmakers of note are Kristina Grozeva and Petar Valchanov, who directed the Crystal Globe-winning film The Father (2019), and Theodore Ushev whose film Blind Vaysha (2016) was nominated for an Academy Award. Bulgarian actors who have accrued critical success and worldwide recognition include Nina Dobrev and Maria Bakalova.

The Golden Rose Film Festival was first held in 1961 and was the biggest Bulgarian film festival throughout the 20th century. In 1997, the Sofia Film Fest was held for the first time. In 2007, Variety included it in its list of the 50 best film festivals.
