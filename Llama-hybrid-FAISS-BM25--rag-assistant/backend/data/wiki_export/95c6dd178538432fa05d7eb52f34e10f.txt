Fishing

In 2023, Norwegian authorities constructed a barrier with a trap that has sorted out hundreds of humpback salmon (on some days), while allowing other fish to pass. The installation is in the vicinity of Seidaholmen - and downstream of it. In August that year, media said that disassembly of the barrier had started.

Transportation

The Sami Bridge at Utsjoki was constructed in 1993. The European route E6 highway follows the western shoreline of the river for most of the length of the river.

In winter, there are usually two ice roads that are in use from December to April. These roads are located near Rustefjelbma and near Polmak and have a weight limit of , but few other limitations.
