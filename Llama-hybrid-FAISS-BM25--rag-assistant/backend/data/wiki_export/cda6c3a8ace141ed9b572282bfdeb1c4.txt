State Highway 84  (SH 84) is a proposed state highway in Webb County in the U.S. state of Texas. The  route is planned to connect Farm to Market Road 1472 (FM 1472) to Interstate 35 (I-35) in Laredo. The proposed road is also known as the Hachar-Reuthinger Road.

History

Former route
A previous route numbered SH 84 was designated on August 21, 1923, as a route across West Texas from the New Mexico state line through Brownfield and Post to Jayton, replacing portions of SH 18 and SH 39. On December 1, 1930, the section from Clairemont to Jayton was transferred to SH 70 when that highway was rerouted. In 1932, the route was co-located with US Highway 380 (US 380). In 1939, the co-designation with US 380 was completely removed.

SH 84A was a spur route designated on May 25, 1925, from SH 84 in Clairemont to Rotan. On March 19, 1930, it was renumbered as SH 161 (now SH 70).

Current route
Construction of the Hachar-Reuthinger Road has been considered critical by the city of Laredo due to increasing truck traffic counts on the World Trade Bridge. While the road has been proposed since 2014, progress was stalled in 2017. In February 2023, the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) assumed responsibility for the maintenance and operation of the corridor, and the SH 84 designation was applied to it on May 25, 2023. Construction is expected to begin in 2023 and is projected to take 18 to 22 months.
