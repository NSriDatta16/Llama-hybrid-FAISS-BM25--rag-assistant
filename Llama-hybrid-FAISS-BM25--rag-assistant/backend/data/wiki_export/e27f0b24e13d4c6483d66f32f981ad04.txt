What Should Then Be Done O People of the East; Traveller (; ) was a philosophical poetry book in Persian of Muhammad Iqbal, a poet-philosopher of the Indian subcontinent. It was published in 1936. A translation, commentary and literary appreciation in Urdu by Elahi Bakhsh Akhtar Awan was published by University Book Agency Khyber Bazar, Peshawar, Pakistan in 1960.

The book includes the mathnavi Musafir. Iqbal's Rumi, the master, utters this glad tiding "East awakes from its slumbers" (Khwab-i ghaflat). Inspiring detailed commentary on voluntary poverty and free man, followed by an exposition of the mysteries of Islamic laws and sufic perceptions is given. He laments the dissention among the South Asians as well as Muslim nations. The book is an account of a journey to Afghanistan. In the Mathnavi, the people of the Sob'ha Sarhat region (Afghans) are counseled to learn the "secret of Islam" and to "build up the self" within themselves because they are a great righteous people. The title has also been translated as What Then Is to Be Done, O Nations of the East.
