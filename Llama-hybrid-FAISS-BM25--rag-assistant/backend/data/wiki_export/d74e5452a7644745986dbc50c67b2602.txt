College career
Manning originally signed with the University of Nebraska, but he never enrolled there, choosing to attend Abilene Christian University. For the Abilene Christian Wildcats football, as a sophomore he was named Division II third-team All-American at defensive back, as a junior first-team All-American as a return specialist, and as a senior first-team All-American as a defensive back.

Professional career
Manning was ranked as the ninth best safety available in the 2006 NFL Draft by Sports Illustrated.

Chicago Bears
The Chicago Bears selected Manning in the second round (42nd overall) of the 2006 NFL Draft. He was the highest selection from Abilene Christian University since Johnny Perkins in 1977) and was also the first player from a non-Division I in 2006.

Midway through the 2008 NFL season, Manning took over Devin Hester's duties as the Bears' kick returner. On December 11, 2008, he returned a kickoff 83 yards for a touchdown, making it the first regular season opening kickoff returned for a touchdown for the Bears since 1972. A week before this touchdown, Manning picked off David Garrard's pass on the Jaguars opening drive, and returned it to the Jaguars five-yard line.

Manning led the league in return average and number of 30+-yard returns, despite only starting half the season.
Manning was Bears starting nickelback in 2008, and  competed with Josh Bullocks, Corey Graham, Kevin Payne, and Craig Steltz for starting free safety. Manning won the starting position before the start of the Bears 2009 summer training camp. On passing downs, Manning played nickelback, while Steltz filled in for him at free safety. Due to Manning's larger role on defense, the Bears chose second-year wide receiver Johnny Knox to take over kick-returning duties.
