History

Early years and World War II
The Second Battalion, Second Marines was activated at Cap-Haitien, Haiti, on July 1, 1925, and assigned to 1st Brigade serving at the time with Garde d’Haiti. Throughout 1925 and 1926, Marines of the battalion were employed to quell political disturbances in Haiti. During the period 1929 through 1933, the battalion assisted in building roads and schools, improving sanitary conditions and training the native Haitian constabulary. Second Battalion was deactivated on January 1, 1933.

Second Battalion was reactivated on January 14, 1941. On August 9, 1942, the Battle of Guadalcanal began with Marines landing on the Tulagi Island Complex. On October 10, elements of the 2nd Battalion conducted a two-day raid on the villages of Koilotamaria and Garabaus. During January 1943, 2d Battalion participated in the final assault to clear Guadalcanal of the remaining Japanese resistance. For its participation in the battle, it was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation.

As part of the 2nd Marine Division, 2/2 deployed and was one of three battalions spearheading the attack on Tarawa (along with the 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marines and the 2nd Battalion, 8th Marines). The Japanese resistance was fierce, and the initial losses to the battalion were heavy. The battalion commander, Lt. Col. Herbert R. Amey, Jr., was killed by Japanese machine gun fire before reaching the beach. Throughout the battle, Marines of the battalion distinguished themselves: there were two Navy Cross recipients and numerous lesser medals awarded for individual actions. The battalion was again awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for its heroic assault at Tarawa. The 2nd Battalion conducted similar operations during Saipan, Tinian and Okinawa campaigns.
