"J'ai pas vingt ans" (English: "I'm Not Twenty") is the sixth single by Alizée, released in June 2003. The single featured, in addition to the solo version of the song, an instrumental version as well as "I'm Fed Up!", which is the English version of "J'en ai marre!". The English version of "J'ai pas vingt ans" is "I'm Not Twenty". "J'ai pas vingt ans" was remixed by Benny Benassi.

"J'ai pas" is informal colloquial French shortening for "je n'ai pas" in "I don't have twenty years". Dropping the "ne" is roughly similar in style to saying "I ain't twenty" in American English.
