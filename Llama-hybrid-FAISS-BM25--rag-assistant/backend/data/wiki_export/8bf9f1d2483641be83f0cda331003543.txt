Club career

Chievo
A product of European giants A.C. Milan's youth system, Sammarco never played a game for the side, serving consecutive loans: from 2002 to 2004 in Serie C1, and from 2004 to 2007 with first division side A.C. ChievoVerona. Cheivo also purchased half of the registration rights for €1.1 million (Martino Olivetti plus €100,000) in June 2003. In June 2006 Milan bought back Sammarco for undisclosed fee, with Olivetti moved back to Chievo for €250,000.

Sampdoria
On 22 June 2007, U.C. Sampdoria announced Sammarco, in another co-ownership deal with Milan, for €1.5 million fee and a reported €400,000 wage. In Sampdoria, he broke through, playing almost every league game in a team that achieved UEFA Cup qualification, under coach Walter Mazzarri.

In June 2008, Sampdoria gained full ownership of Sammarco for another €2.5 million, made his valued increased to €4 million (made Milan register a financial income of €1 million as the half retained had increased from €1.5 million to €2.5 million) Sammarco also signed a new contract which lasted until 30 June 2013 during 2009–10 season. On 25 August 2009 he was loaned to Udinese for one season, for a reported wage of €250,000. Sammarco was a sub under Luigi Delneri at the first match of 2009–10 Serie A.

On returning to Sampdoria for the beginning of the 2010–11 season, he did not appear in any games, as the club now hired Domenico Di Carlo as coach. However, his wage was increased to €700,000. He was loaned to Cesena on 30 December 2010 for the rest of the season.

He scored a goal in the first two games of 2011–12 Coppa Italia for Doria, however on 24 August he returned to Chievo in exchange with Simone Bentivoglio, re-uniting Di Carlo. Sammarco's wage was also reduced to €250,000 again.
