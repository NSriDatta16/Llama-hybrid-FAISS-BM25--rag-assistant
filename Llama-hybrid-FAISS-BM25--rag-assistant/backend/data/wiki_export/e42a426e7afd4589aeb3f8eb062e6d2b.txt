Jeffrey Owen Hawkes (born 3 September 1953) is a South African professional golfer.

Early life 
Hawkes was born in Mthatha (then Umtata), Eastern Cape. In addition to his home in Bruma near Johannesburg, he also resides in Bracknell, England.

Professional career 
In 1974, Hawkes turned professional. He played on the European Tour for over twenty years, making the top one hundred on the European Tour Order of Merit every year from 1977 to 1991, with a best ranking of 34th in 1987. His sole European Tour win came at the 1991 Canon European Masters Swiss Open. He has also won three tournaments on the Southern Africa Tour, now the Sunshine Tour.

Hawkes joined the European Seniors Tour in 2004, but has yet to win at that level, although his playing schedule is rather limited as he also works as a golf commentator and analyst for Sky Sports in the United Kingdom.
