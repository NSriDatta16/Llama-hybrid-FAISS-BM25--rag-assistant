"Hit 'Em Up Style (Oops!)" is the debut single of American R&B singer Blu Cantrell, written and produced by Dallas Austin and featured on Cantrell's debut album, So Blu (2001). The song was released in the United States on April 23, 2001, and was issued in other regions later that year. It is Cantrell's most successful single in the US and her only single to enter the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number two (where it spent two consecutive weeks) on the issue date of July 21, 2001. It enjoyed similar success in Europe and Oceania.

Composition
The lyrics propose that women should take revenge on cheating men by draining them of their available assets, both monetary assets and property. Cantrell has said that she did not particularly care for the song artistically, but the bitter feelings she was experiencing at the time led her to include it on the album anyway. "Hit 'Em Up Style (Oops!)" takes a small snippet sample from Frank Sinatra’s "Boys' Night Out". The song is written in the key of F minor and is written in half time with a tempo of 90 beats per minute.  The song features the chords Fm and Bm6, and Cantrell's vocals span from B3 to A5.
