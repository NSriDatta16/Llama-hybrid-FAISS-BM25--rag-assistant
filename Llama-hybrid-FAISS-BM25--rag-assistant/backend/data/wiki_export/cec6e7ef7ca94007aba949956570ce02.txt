Illis quorum (Illis quorum meruere labores) (English: "For Those Whose Labors Have Deserved It") is a gold medal awarded for outstanding contributions to Swedish culture, science or society.

The award was introduced in 1784 by King Gustav III, and was first awarded in 1785. Prior to 1975, the medal was awarded by the King of Sweden. Illis quorum is now awarded by the Government of Sweden, and it is currently the highest award that can be conferred upon an individual Swedish citizen by the Government. It is awarded, on average, to seven people per year.
