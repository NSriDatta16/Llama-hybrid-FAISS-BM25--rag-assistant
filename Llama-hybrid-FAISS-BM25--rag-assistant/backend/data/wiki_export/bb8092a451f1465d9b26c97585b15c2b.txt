The Gbagyi or Gbari (plural - Agbagyi/Agbari) are an ethnic group found predominantly in Central Nigeria, with an estimated population figure put at 5.8 million, spread in four States, including the FCT, and located in thirty local Government areas, according to the 2006 National Population Census figures. It is also the name of their language. Members of the ethnic group speak two dialects. While speakers of the dialects were loosely called Gwari by both the Hausa Fulani and Europeans during pre-colonial Nigeria they prefer to be known as Gbagyi/Gbari. They live in the Niger, the Federal Capital Territory - Abuja, and Kaduna State. They are also found in Nasarawa central Nigeria Area. Gbagyi/Gbari is one of the most populated ethnic groups in the middle belt and indigenous in the Federal Capital Territory of Nigeria. This means Gbagyi people are the bonafide owners of the Nigerian capital city, Abuja.

History

Social-political structure
Historically, the Gbagyi practice a patrilineal kinship system. The lowest tier of authority is found in the extended family compound led by the oldest male. Being a patriarchal community, the Osu (king) is the highest tier of authority in a Gbagyi/Gbari settlement and he is assisted by a group of elders who are charged with the responsibility of ensuring peace in the land.

Additionally, Gbagyi familiarity with the lapis lazuli stone has been taken in some quarters as indication of Egyptian origin. The question of Gbagyi origin is further complicated by the fact that the Nupe and Gbagyi languages have recognised affinity and the Koro, whose history seems to have been intricately linked with that of the Gbagyi, actually claim linkage with Wukari and the Kwarafara empire .they first started to attend the Evangelical church Africa now know as Evangelical church winning all (ECWA) (Cadman, 1913).

Settlement
The Gbagyi people are found in various locations in Middle Belt (Central) Nigeria. They inhabit the western parts of Abuja, southern Niger State, Chikun Local Government Area with its headquarters at Kujama in Kaduna state and Nassarawa states. Significant Gbagyi towns include Minna, Karu, Kuta, Kwakuti, Kwali, Gawu, (Gusolo) Gussoro, (Gbada) Gwada, Guni, Fuka, Galkogo, Maikunle, Manta, Wushapa (Ushafa), Bisi, Bwaya (Bwari), Suleja, Shiroro (Shilolo), Beji, Diko, Alawa, Erena, Paiko/ paigo lanbata, zugba, Nuku, Gbogo and Farin doki. There are some theories that posits a reason for the scattered settlements and migration of the Gbagyi people. Some historians believe the Gbagyi were displaced from their original settlements during the Fulani Jihad, while some local historians link migration with the need for farmland by the Gbagyi. Chigudu, pp. 1–2

Gbagyi settlements can be both large and small. In locations where farming is the dominant occupation, the settlements tend to be small so that enough land is available for farming.

Displacement from lands in Abuja
The Gbagyi were the largest among the ethnic groups that inhabited the land proposed for development when Abuja was chosen as Nigeria's new federal capital. The result of the dislocation was the removal of people from their ancestral homes, from spiritual symbols such as Zuma Rock, seeing their ancestral land be referred to as no-man's land and issues about adjusting to the new environment given by the government. However, many displaced families were given housing, but some lived in transit and settlements camps for a long while.

Culture

The Gbagyi people are known to be peace-loving, transparent and accommodating people.  Northerners are fond of saying in Hausa language muyi shi Gwari Gwari, "let’s do it like the Gbagyi" or "in the Gbagyi way". According to Tanko Chigudu, the Gbagyi people have emerged as a unique breed among Nigerians: their culture shows how much they have come to terms with the universe. Daily they aspire to give life a meaning no matter the situation in which they find themselves.

Language

The Gbagyi language is part of the Kwa sub-division of the Niger-Congo language family, however, some researchers such as Kay Williamson put the language in the Benue-Congo family. The people speak two dialects that are sometimes called Gbari (Gwari yamma) and Gbagyi dialects.

Religion
The Gbagyi people are typically adherents of the Christian faith, however a growing subset practice Islam and their own traditional religion. In their traditional religion, some Gbagyi believe in a God called Shekwoyi (one who was there before their ancestors) but they also devote themselves to appeasing deities of the god such as Maigiro. Many Agbagyi believe in reincarnation.

Islam began to become more prominent among the people after the Fulani jihad but the colonial and post-colonial period saw the growth of Christianity. The rapid growth of Christianity was also due to the Sudan Interior Mission (which also came to be known locally as Evangelical Church of West Africa now Evangelical Church Winning All) and the Baptist Missionaries from the south western part of Nigeria.
