Biography 

The Assyrian Malek family claims to trace its roots back eleven centuries. During the Assyrian genocide of 1914â€“1918, Malek-Yonan's family fled to Baghdad, in the Great Exodus from Urmia where he was born on 11 October 1924.  When still a young child, his family migrated back to Iran and finally settled in Tehran. His parents were Yosip (Joseph) and Suriya, both Assyrian.  His older sister, Florence, was Knighted in the early 70s and lived in Switzerland where she died on 18 February 2007.  His older brother, David, was an engineer in Iran who built many of Iran's major freeways and roadways as well as numerous silos in Russia.  His younger brother, Cyrus, left Iran for England when he was only seventeen to study at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London and eventually settled in Paris.
