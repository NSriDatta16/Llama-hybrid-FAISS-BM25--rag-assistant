She Wants Revenge is the debut studio album by American rock band She Wants Revenge. Mixed by Michael Patterson, it was released on January 31, 2006 by Perfect Kiss, a subsidiary of Geffen Records.

The album cover shows a female model wearing white underwear, while the back cover reveals that she's holding a very large knife behind her back (i.e. "she wants revenge").

Critical reception

Barry Walters, writing for Rolling Stone, noted how the duo's musicianship sounded similar to other new wave bands like Joy Division and The Cure, concluding that "She Wants Revenge steal from the best, and steal well." James Christopher Monger of AllMusic was mixed on Warfield and Bravin's post-punk homage to their new wave inspirations, saying, "[T]here's nothing wrong with honoring your influences by copping a few moves and singing in a fake British accent like Green Day with the intentions of updating a genre that many potential listeners are too young to have experienced first-hand, but it's another thing to do it without even the slightest deviation." Adam Moerder from Pitchfork was critical of the album, describing the song titles as "lazy permutations of post-punk poetry," found the melodies on the rock tracks too repetitive, and saw the highlights as being "eerily predictable." He concluded by calling the record, "Too ugly and inaccessible to suggest some sort of post-punk cash-out, they stick out in a batch of songs too bent on edifying studio wizardry over musicianship." Dave Gurney of Tiny Mix Tapes heavily panned the album's overall sound for lacking the energy their '80s influences had and the duo's lyricism feeling like high school poetry, saying "these guys sound like an incredibly desperate attempt to cash in on the neo-post-punk bandwagon."
