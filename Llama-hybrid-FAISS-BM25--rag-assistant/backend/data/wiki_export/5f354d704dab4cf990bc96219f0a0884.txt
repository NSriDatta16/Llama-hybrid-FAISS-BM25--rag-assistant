History
In the Ayutthaya period, the area of Amphawa was known as Khwaeng Bang Chang (or just Bang Chang), a small agricultural and commercial community. During the reign of King Prasat Thong the existence of a market is confirmed by sources.

In early Rattanakosin period, Bang Chang was dubbed "Suan Nok" (outer garden), paired with "Suan Nai" (inner garden) or Bangkok. Because they have a very similar terrain, which was filled with orchards and there was many watercourses flowing through the areas.

In those days, the  territory of Bang Chang extended to parts of Bang Khonthi, Mueang Samut Songkhram Districts and Damnoen Saduak District in Ratchaburi Province in present day.

The name "Bang Chang" meaning "place of elephants", because it used to be a habitat for many herd of wild elephants and was also a hideout for the white elephants as well. While "Amphawa" after the canal Khlong Amphawa that runs through the district. This word "Amphawa",  it is assumed to mean "mango forest" in order to reflect the condition of the area in those days which was full of various orchards such as mango etc. Hence the seal of the district is an elephant in the mango forest.

In 1766, the later King Buddha Loetla Nabhalai (Rama II) was born in the area, as his father was serving as governor of Ratchaburi at that time. At his birthplace is now a memorial park with four buildings in the traditional style of that area, displaying art as well as lifestyle of that time.
