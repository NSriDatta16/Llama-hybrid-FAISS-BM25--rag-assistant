Click-B (클릭비) is a South Korean boy group and band formed in August 1999 under DSP Media. Click-B started out as a band combining rock and dance beats in their music. They became a four member group in 2002, with several member changes over the next few years. In 2015, the group made a seven member comeback with the single album Reborn.

History
Click-B formed in August 1999 under Daesung Entertainment (now DSP Media).

The band split in 2002, with 4 members remaining. In 2003, the 4th album was released with Woo Yun-suk, Oh Jong-hyuk, Kim Sang-hyuk, and Kim Tae-hyung. In 2004, they joined the k-pop duo, J-Walk (consisting of two previous Sechskies members Jang Suwon and Kim Jaeduck) to form a project band, JnC. After JnC, member Kim Tae Hyung left the group to pursue personal interests.

In 2006, Click-B (with the previous arrangement of 3 remaining members Oh Jong-hyuk, Woo Yun-suk and Kim Sang-hyuk) released their 5th album "Smile".

In 2011, Click-B (with all seven members) got together for a brief comeback with two new singles, "To Be Continued" in April and "빈 자리 (Empty Seat)" in November.

On December 14, 2013, DSP Media organized a concert 'DSP Festival' at Jamshil Arena where Click-B performed as a group along with other artists under the same management. A few members were absent for various reasons: Evan (Yoo Ho-suk) was still serving his military obligation, Kim Sang-hyuk was on hiatus from the entertainment industry and Kang Hoo (Kim Tae-hyung) was busy with his acting career.

In August 2015, a comeback with all seven members was announced, later confirmed for October. DSP Media announced the group would hold its first concert after thirteen years since debut, "7-3=7" on November 21. The group released "Reborn" on October 21.
