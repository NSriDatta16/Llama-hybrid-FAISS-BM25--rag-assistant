Klover was an American, short-lived Boston punk band, consisting of Mike Stone (later a Queensr√øche guitarist) on vocals and guitar, Chris Doherty (ex-Gang Green) on lead guitar, Darren Hill (ex-Red Rockers, Paul Westerberg) on bass and Brian Betzger (ex-Jerry's Kids, Gang Green) on drums.

They released only one album, Feel Lucky Punk?, and an EP, Beginning to End, on Mercury Records in 1995 and disbanded after the subsequent tour. "Beginning to End" was used in the soundtrack for the 1995 Sylvester Stallone film Assassins.
