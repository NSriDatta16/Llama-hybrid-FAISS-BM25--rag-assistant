Graham Maby (born 1 September 1952) is an English bass guitar player. He has recorded and toured with Joe Jackson since his first album, appearing on most of Jackson's albums and tours.  He has continued to record and tour with Jackson even while working with other artists.

Graham was born and raised in the central south coast town of Gosport. Working exclusively with Joe Jackson since the late seventies, in the mid 1980s he began working live and in the studio with Marshall Crenshaw. In the early 90s he toured with Graham Parker, Garland Jeffreys, the Silos, and Darden Smith, among others. In 1996, Maby joined They Might Be Giants, and from 1998 until 2002, he recorded and toured with Natalie Merchant. Maby has also recorded and toured with Joan Baez, Freedy Johnston, Henry Lee Summer, Ian Hunter, Regina Spektor, Chris Stamey, Shivaree, and Dar Williams.

Along with playing bass, Maby also produced  several tracks on Johnston's 1992 album, Can You Fly. He can be seen in the 1986 movie Peggy Sue Got Married as a member of Marshall Crenshaw's band, and very briefly in the 2019 Todd Phillips movie Joker as a member of the "Murray Franklin Show" band.

Graham lived in New Jersey for many years, where he met and worked with many outstanding musicians. Guitarist Bobby Bandiera introduced Graham to Bruce Springsteen and Jon Bon Jovi, both of whom Graham has appeared with live.

Graham's second wife, Mary Beth (n√©e Bernard) Maby, died on 12 January 2012 after a two-year battle with bladder cancer. He has two children, Claire and Pierce.

His first-born son Christopher, also an aspiring musician and actor, died in 1998.

Remarried in 2017, Graham now lives with his wife, Maureen Magee Shannon Maby, on Long Island, NY, where he continues to work on a memoir.
