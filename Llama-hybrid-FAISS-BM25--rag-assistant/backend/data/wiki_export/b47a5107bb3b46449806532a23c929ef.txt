(lit. "The Express") was a Swiss regional French-language daily newspaper published in Neuchâtel.

Originally founded in 1738 as Feuille d'avis de Neuchatel, it was the oldest still-published French-language newspaper in the world, before it was merged in 2018 with L'Impartial ("The Impartial"), another Swiss French-language paper, to form ArcInfo.
 
L'Express covered international, national and local issues, including local exhibitions. The newspaper's circulation was 28,490 in 2003.
