"All or Nothing" is a song by American singer and actress Cher from her 22nd studio album, Believe (1998). It was released as the third international single from Believe on June 7, 1999, by WEA and Warner Bros. Records. "All or Nothing" reached the top 40 of the US Billboard Hot 100 Singles Sales chart at number 38 and peaked at number one on the Billboard Dance Club Play chart. In Europe, the single was a top-10 hit in the Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, and Scotland.

Critical reception
Larry Flick from Billboard wrote that the song "leans closer to the pop side—like the No. 1 "Believe"—but is still the kind of pure dance extravaganza that brings nothing but exalted exuberance to the radio airwaves." He described it as a song "that is so joyous and well-executed that it makes life a little more satisfying than it was four minutes before." Can't Stop the Pop described it as "one of her most beautifully melancholic moments", adding that "it embraces the disco-heartbreak mood and carves its own identity." Bob Waliszewski of Plugged In stated that on "All or Nothing", "the artist tries to determine whether she should continue the seemingly futile pursuit of a love ("I'm chasing shadows/We keep falling further apart/Do you care now?")."

Music video

The music video for "All or Nothing" was shot while Cher was on tour for her album, Believe. Although most of the video features random clips of some of Cher's Do You Believe? tour performances, new footage was filmed in which Cher sang the song, wore a red wig and a silver outfit rather than the tour costume which Cher herself described as "Bozo the Clown-meets-Braveheart look." In 1999, the video was released as a VHS and CD-R promos in North America, but later that year, it was included in the Taiwanese release of the Believe album. Prior to the release of the video in the UK and Europe, a video composed of scenes from the previous two videos—"Believe" and "Strong Enough"—was used as the official video was not completed in time.

A remix video was made which is very similar to the original version. The main difference is that the remix video is in black and white. Although Dan Rux most famously known as Dan-O-Rama made all the remix videos for the Believe album's singles (including a tour-only video mix), it is unknown whether he created the "All or Nothing" remix video. The remix used in the video is the Almighty Definitive mix.
