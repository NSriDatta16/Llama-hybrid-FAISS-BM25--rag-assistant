Spin the Wheel is the second album by the Irish girl group, Bellefire. It was released in Asia around July 2004 and the singles garnered high radio airplay and chart positioning. This led to the band touring Southeast Asian countries including the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, and Hong Kong. Although the band enjoyed some success in Europe with their singles, they parted ways with their record label EastWest before the album was scheduled for release there.

The album features many covers of famous songs like "You Were Meant for Me", the hit originally performed by Jewel, and "Need to Be Next to You", penned by Diane Warren and sung by Leigh Nash, lead vocalist of Sixpence None the Richer, for the film Bounce. Also included is a cover of Mark Wills' "What Hurts the Most", which was later covered by Jo O'Meara and Rascal Flatts.
