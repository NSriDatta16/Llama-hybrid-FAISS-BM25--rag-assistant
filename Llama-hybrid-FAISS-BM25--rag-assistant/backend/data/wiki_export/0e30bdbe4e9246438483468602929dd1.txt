Kustaa Adolf Simonpoika Rovio (23 January 1887 in Saint Petersburg â€“ 21 April 1938) also known as Gustav Ravelin, was a Finnish Communist politician who fled to the Russian SFSR after the Finnish Civil War. Rovio was executed during the Great Purge.

Considerable material on the activity and eventual destruction of Rovio may be found in "The Bells of the Kremlin" (University Press of New England, 1983) by Arvo Tuominen, a member of the Presidium of the Comintern, and a miraculous survivor of the purges, who escaped by becoming a representative of the Comintern in Sweden in 1938, then refused a summons to return to Moscow in 1939.
