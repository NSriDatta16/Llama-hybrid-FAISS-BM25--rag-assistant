In geometry, Apollonius's theorem is a theorem relating the length of a median of a triangle to the lengths of its sides. 
It states that "the sum of the squares of any two sides of any triangle equals twice the square on half the third side, together with twice the square on the median bisecting the third side".

Specifically, in any triangle  if  is a median, then 

It is a special case of Stewart's theorem. For an isosceles triangle with  the median  is perpendicular to  and the theorem reduces to the Pythagorean theorem for triangle  (or triangle ). From the fact that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other, the theorem is equivalent to the parallelogram law.

The theorem is named for the ancient Greek mathematician Apollonius of Perga.

Proof 

The theorem can be proved as a special case of Stewart's theorem, or can be proved using vectors (see parallelogram law). The following is an independent proof using the law of cosines.

Let the triangle have sides  with a median  drawn to side  Let  be the length of the segments of  formed by the median, so  is half of  Let the angles formed between  and  be  and  where  includes  and  includes  Then  is the supplement of  and  The law of cosines for  and  states that

Add the first and third equations to obtain

as required.
