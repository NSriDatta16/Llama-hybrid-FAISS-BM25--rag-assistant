The Draconettidae, slope dragonets, are a small family (about 12-14 species) of fish in the order Perciformes. They are found in temperate to tropical waters of the Atlantic, Indian and western Pacific Oceans. They are closely related to, and appear similar to, the fish of the Callionymidae. They are small fish, the largest species reaching  long. Like the callionymids, they are bottom-dwelling fish, and usually sexually dimorphic.

Ecology and behavior
Not much is known about the ecology of slope dragonets. The larvae are planktonic, while adults live in the benthic zone on soft bottoms from the edge of the outer continental shelf and on seamounts down to around  deep.
