Views

Yulia Latynina is known for her sharp and polemic statements. She proclaims herself a libertarian.

For some time she openly denied global warming and called Michael E. Mann's hockey stick graph a fake. However, in 2022 Latynina agreed that "global warming is real".

Latynina was a member of the Committee 2008.

She voiced an opinion that universal suffrage was bad for poor countries. She also criticized western liberalism and human rights organizations which she thinks are used by Muslim extremists as useful idiots to prevent winning the War on Terror.

In her opinion, Moscow Helsinki Group was wrong in supporting Russian scientist Igor Sutyagin, who she suggested could actually be involved in espionage. She argued that although communications of Sutyagin with foreign spy agencies have never been proven, the foreign agency that he passed information on was indeed highly suspicious.

Latynina has been a consistent critic of leftist politics. In September 2020, she said: "I. e, the owners of Sargon-like countries are witnessing the same propaganda, a similar technology of total lies combined with socialism and leftist ideas. It penetrates all the structures of Western society... Here, the USSR used to be creating socialism for everyone, and, in the United States, the politicians were a lot smarter. Even those with the left [political] orientation have been creating socialism only for the poor".

Attacks

In retaliation for her political stance and categorical statements, Latynina became a victim of several attacks. On August 20, 2016, she was assaulted by two men in motorcycle helmets who poured feces on her. On the night of 18 and 19 July 2017, unknown assailants attacked Latynina's house and sprayed it with a very pungent and caustic type of gas of unknown composition. Along with herself, 8 people were additionally injured in the gas attack, including four elderly people and two children. She said that she would not bring the case to the officials as police had not investigated some attacks on opposition politicians, however, Dmitry Muratov reported the attack to the police.

On 9 September, Latynina announced that she and her family are leaving Russia and would not return "in the near future". She called the car's arson an attempted murder. According to her father, Latynina had been under surveillance for some time, and the attackers were not bandits but an organized group that received commands from certain influential people.
