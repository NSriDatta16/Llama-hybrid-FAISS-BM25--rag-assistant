History
Before Thousand Oaks High School opened, high school students in the Conejo Valley attended Oxnard High School and later Adolfo Camarillo High School, both campuses of the Oxnard Union High School District (OUHSD). In response to rapid population growth throughout the district in the postwar years, OUHSD superintendent Joseph W. Crosby began an ambitious school construction program. In 1960, voters approved a school bond measure that enabled the building of several new high school campuses. OUHSD purchased a  site on Moorpark Road from Janss Corporation for $245,693.45 and awarded a $2.275 million building contract to Viola Incorporated, more than $200,000 over budget. Thousand Oaks High School opened in 1962 with a student body of 895; the first principal was Tom Roser, a former social science teacher at Oxnard High School. The campus was shared with the Valley Oaks School District, educating 300 students in grades K–8 while Meadows Elementary of the Arts and Sciences was being built.

On July 1, 1974, the Conejo Valley Unified School District (CVUSD) was formed from the easternmost territory of OUHSD, merging with two elementary school districts serving the Conejo Valley. The new district took control of TOHS and Newbury Park High School, the latter which opened in 1967.

A 350-seat performing arts center opened at Thousand Oaks High School in 1999. In 2000, the campus underwent a major modernization project, addressing heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) and ADA accessibility issues. 

Thousand Oaks High School had its HVAC replaced in 2018 and the school library was renovated in 2019.

In January 2020, Schneider Electric donated an outdoor classroom shade structure and solar panels to the school. Called the Sustainable Outdoor Learning Environment (SOLE), the  structure seats 40 students, is powered entirely by renewable energy, and features outdoor furniture and an interactive white board. Construction concluded in April 2021.
