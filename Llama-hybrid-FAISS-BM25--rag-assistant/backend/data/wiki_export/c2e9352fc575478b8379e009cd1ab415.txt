Critical reception

The Gazette wrote that "'Kel Kweyo', 'Lapwony' and 'Lajok' are stunning examples of modern African pop at its best," but noted that Oryema may regret "his own creative concessions with the Real World gang." The Edmonton Journal determined that Oryema's "soft, English delivery, gentle, funky beats and melodic hooks offer the most easily accessible sounds on the [Real World] label."

The Press-Enterprise opined that "Oryema's golden voice hovers like a mythic bird over songs that play like shafts of light and rhythm falling on the floor of a rainforest." The Tampa Tribune concluded that "the singer's rich vocals—alternately deep and soaring—are the continuous, seductive cord around which this variegated music is wrapped."

AllMusic wrote: "This highly creative mix of Ugandan songs and laid-back rock should have been a disaster, since the genres meet on the field of ambient dreams ... But expat Ugandan Geoffrey Oryema neither tries mainstreaming African sources to fit rock fissures nor piles extra beats and instruments on the heads of reluctant Western forms." The Toronto Sun listed Beat the Border as the 8th best album of 1993.
