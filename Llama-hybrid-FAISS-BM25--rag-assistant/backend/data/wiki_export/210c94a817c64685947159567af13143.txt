West Somerset College (is sometimes abbreviated to WSC and was previously known as West Somerset Community College prior to the college re-brand in September 2013) is a fairly large secondary school in Minehead, Somerset, England. It provides education for pupils aged 13 to 16 (school years 9–11) in the main school and 16 to 18 (school years 12–13) in the sixth form (West Somerset uses a three-tier school system). WSC has had Technology College status for several years, meaning the college receives additional funding. In June 2011, the school became an Academy. The school has a partnership with a secondary school (Gymnasium) in Bünde, Germany.

The College was placed into special measures following an October 2014 Ofsted report judging the College to be 'inadequate.' This status was lifted in May 2016 following 'significant improvements.'

The College was subsequently placed third best in Somerset for progress in GCSE results in the DFE 2017 league table.
