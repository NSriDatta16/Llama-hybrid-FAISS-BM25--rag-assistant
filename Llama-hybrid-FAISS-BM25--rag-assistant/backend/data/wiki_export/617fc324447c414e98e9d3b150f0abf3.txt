The station is served only by the Amtrak Hiawatha Service, and sees fourteen daily arrivals, seven each from Milwaukee and Chicago Union Station. The station is the first stop enroute to Chicago,  from Milwaukee with a with a travel time of about 10 minutes.

Passengers needing checked baggage service are advised to use the downtown station. The station parking lot contains 300 spaces and a fee is charged to park. All revenue generated from parking fees is used to finance the station's operating costs. Transport to and from the airport terminal is provided by the free shuttle buses operated by the airport.

History 
The idea of opening an Amtrak station in the vicinity of Mitchell Airport had been discussed since the mid-1970s. The justification for not building the station at the time was based on infrequent Amtrak service and relatively congestion-free access to the airport from the south via I-94 and WI 119. By the late 1990s, a station at the airport was proposed as part of the Midwest Regional Rail Initiative. In June 2001, the Wisconsin Department of Transportation authorized $100,000 to start the preliminary design for the station, with an original opening slated for late-2003.

How to fund construction of the station became an issue following objections from both airport and Milwaukee County officials. Although supported by both airport and local officials, they stated that financing a facility to transport persons primarily away from Milwaukee should not be done with local, but rather state and federal sources. As a result of this sentiment, Senator Herb Kohl requested $5 million for its construction as part of a federal transportation appropriations bill in July, only to see it reduced to $2.5 million in the final bill in December. With an additional $4 million in funding secured by Kohl in February 2003, combined with the $2.5 million previously appropriated, construction of the $6.5 million station could commence.

Groundbreaking for the facility occurred on June 28, 2004. Included in the $6.8 million project budget were funds for the construction of the station and track improvements to reduce delays between Milwaukee and Chicago. State and local economic development officials saw its construction as an opportunity for travelers from the Chicago metropolitan area to use the station as a rail link to reach Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport as an alternative for both Chicago's Midway and O'Hare airports. The station opened for Hiawatha Service trains on January 18, 2005, as a regular stop along Amtrak's . At the time of its opening, this became only the fourth Amtrak station to have direct service to an airport, after Baltimore, Newark and Burbank.

The station was designed for trains carrying only four coach cars, but service was expanded to five cars by 2009, with a sixth proposed. In 2010, the Wisconsin Department of Transportation was awarded $678,000 in ARRA funds to double the length of the -long platform. The work was completed in October 2012. From March 21 to June 29, 2020, the Empire Builder temporarily stopped at Milwaukee Airport and Sturtevant while Hiawatha Service trains were suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In February 2019, the Federal Railroad Administration awarded $5 million in Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements funds to the Wisconsin Department of Transportation to add a second  platform and a footbridge at the station. Construction on the $17.2 million project began in June 2023, with completion expected in June 2025.
