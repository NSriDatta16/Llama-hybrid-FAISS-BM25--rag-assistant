Echoes O' Faith is the title of The 77s' second live album, released in 1996 on the band's own Fools of the World label. This album was recorded live at Echoes Of Faith Church in Ontario, California on November 28, 1992.

This performance was a rare acoustic "unplugged" performance of the 77s, which prompted producer Brian Healy to start recording. Everyone involved was happy enough with the overall sound of the recording that it was decided to make it into a live album.
