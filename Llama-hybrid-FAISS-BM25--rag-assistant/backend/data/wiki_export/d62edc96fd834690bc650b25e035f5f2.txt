Carnalea railway station is located in the townland of Carnalea in northwest Bangor, County Down, Northern Ireland.

It was first opened by the B.C.D.R. (Belfast and County Down Railway) on its present site at Station Walk on 1 June 1877 with only an up platform, and a brake van as an office.

Through the advent of wooden villas in the late 19th century, the B.C.D.R. (Belfast and County Down Railway) built a station house on the upside in 1897, most of which still stands. The station master's former dwelling is the oldest building in the area.

The station's low-set signal cabin (disused since the 1930s) and downside shelter have been demolished since the Northern Ireland Railways takeover in 1967. Glass shelters exist on the sites of the former waiting areas.

The station remains popular and many locals commute to Belfast via the station each morning.
