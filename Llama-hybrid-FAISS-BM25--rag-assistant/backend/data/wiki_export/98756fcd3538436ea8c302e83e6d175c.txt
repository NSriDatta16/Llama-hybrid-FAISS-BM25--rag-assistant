Ghetto Classics is the third studio album by American R&B singer Jaheim. It was released by Warner Bros. Records on February 13, 2006 in the United States. As with his previous albums, production and songwriting duties were handled by former Naughty by Nature DJ KayGee as well as Terence "Tramp Baby" Abney, Darren Lighty, Eddie F, Bink, Scott Storch, Balewa Muhammad, Wesley Hogges, Eric Williams, and The Co-Stars.

It debuted at number one on both the US Billboard 200 and the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums, selling 153,000 copies in its first week of release. Ghetto Classics spawned the moderate hit "Everytime I Think about Her", featuring Jadakiss. Although the album stayed on the album charts for only thirteen weeks, it was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on March 21, 2006.

Critical reception

At Metacritic, which assigns a rated mean out of 100 from mainstream critics, the album received a score of 67, which indicates "generally favorable reviews," based on 13 reviews. Allmusic editor John Bush found that "Ghetto Classics may boast nothing as ambitious as 2002's [single] "Fabulous", and it may amp up the rapper collaborations in search of hits (Jadakiss and Styles P have appearances), but overall very little distracts from the qualities that have made him the most durable talent in commercial yet traditional R&B music [...] The final three songs ditch the samples for straight R&B, and while the absence is missed, it represents an intriguing direction for Jaheim in the future. Classic R&B may seem like just a memory to some, but with artists like Heather Headley and Jaheim in action, it doesn't have to be about the past."
