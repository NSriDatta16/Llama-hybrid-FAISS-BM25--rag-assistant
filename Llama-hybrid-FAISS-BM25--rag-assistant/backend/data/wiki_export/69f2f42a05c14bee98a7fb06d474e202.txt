History

On 1 February 1965, initial programmes in the Tsonga language were broadcast for listeners in the then Northern Transvaal, from the Johannesburg studios of the South African Broadcasting Corporation, at that time situated in Broadcast House, Commissioner Street. This service later became known as Radio Tsonga. On 1 February 1984 Radio Tsonga was also broadcast on medium wave from Pietersburg (now Polokwane). On 1 May of the same year, coverage was extended to listeners in Soweto via a low power FM transmitter atop the SABC building at Auckland Park.

Amongst those who managed the station is  former presenter and Radio 2000 manager, James Shikwamabane after Tsakani Baloyi left the station in 2011. Former sports presenter James Swikwambane has won more National and International Awards; he was the station manager from May 2012 to September 2016.
