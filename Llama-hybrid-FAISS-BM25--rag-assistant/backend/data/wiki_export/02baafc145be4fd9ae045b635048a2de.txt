Walter Michael Poddubny (February 14, 1960 – March 21, 2009) was a Canadian professional ice hockey left winger and coach who played eleven seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) from 1981–82 until 1991–92. He played 468 career NHL games, scoring 184 goals and 238 assists for 422 points.

Career
Poddubny was drafted 90th overall by the Edmonton Oilers in the 1980 NHL Entry Draft. He spent most of the 1981–82 season with the Wichita Wind where he had 35 goals and 46 assists in 60 games. He was traded along with Phil Drouillard from the Oilers to the Toronto Maple Leafs for Laurie Boschman on March 8, 1982.

He was acquired by the New York Rangers from the Maple Leafs for Mike Allison on August 18, 1986, in a trade considered to be Phil Esposito's best during his three years as the team's general manager. Poddubny was the leading scorer in each of his only two Rangers campaigns, with 87 points (40 goals, 47 assists) in 1986–87 and 88 (38 goals, 50 assists) the following season. He was the recipient of the New York Rangers Fan Club's Frank Boucher Trophy for the most popular player on and off the ice in both years, and the team's Most Valuable Player Award from the Professional Hockey Writers Association in 1987.

Despite coming off a season as the Rangers' top scorer, he was traded along with Jari Grönstrand, Bruce Bell and a fourth-round selection in the 1989 NHL Entry Draft (76th overall–Éric Dubois) to the Quebec Nordiques for Normand Rochefort and Jason Lafreniere on August 1, 1988. Esposito felt the team needed to improve its defense after losing 17 games by one goal and missing the playoffs. He was also disappointed with Poddubny's failure to win face-offs, while head coach Michel Bergeron expressed displeasure with the quality of his checking game. Following a productive season in 1988–89 with the Nordiques that saw Poddubny score 38 goals in 72 games played, his playing career began to decline from damaged knees.

After his lone season with the Nordiques, Poddubny was sent to the New Jersey Devils for Claude Loiselle and Joe Cirella on June 17, 1989.

After his career in the NHL, Poddubny coached several hockey teams including six seasons as head coach of the  Anchorage Aces. Life after the NHL wasn't easy for him, and he once said, "People think if you played in the NHL, you're set for life. It's not like that for everyone."

Poddubny died of a heart attack at the age of 49, after collapsing at his sister's house in Thunder Bay.
