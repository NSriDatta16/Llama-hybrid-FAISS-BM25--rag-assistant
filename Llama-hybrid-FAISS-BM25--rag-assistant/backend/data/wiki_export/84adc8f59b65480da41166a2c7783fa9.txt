Background

Fantasia sang "I Believe" on the third-season finale of American Idol as her last performance within the competition. Diana DeGarmo, the runner up of American Idol, sang the song first on the finale, for her first performance of the night. The judges unanimously acclaimed Fantasia the winner, a prediction that came true when she was crowned the following evening. An ecstatic and tearful Fantasia performed her new single "I Believe" minutes after the announcement. DeGarmo's performance was also well received by the judges.
