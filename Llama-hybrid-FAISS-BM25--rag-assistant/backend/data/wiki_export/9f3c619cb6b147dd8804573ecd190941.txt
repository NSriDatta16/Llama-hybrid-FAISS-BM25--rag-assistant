is a manga collection of gaiden (side stories) set in the Cosmic Era of Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny, and is a follow-up to Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny Astray. It is a tie in to the 2006 ONA side story Mobile Suit Gundam SEED C.E. 73: Stargazer.

Plot
Δ Astray follows a team dispatched from Mars to Earth to establish contact with the coordinators of the ZAFT colonies and the humans on earth and bring an understanding to their constant warring. The team is led by Ergnes Brahe, a 16-year-old Coordinator. The main crew consists of Ergnes and his second in command Nahe Herschel, a 19-year-old Coordinator. They are joined later by Diego Lowell, a 16-year-old of unspecified genetic type who came to Earth ahead of the rest of the team, aboard Lowe Guele's ship ReHOME.

The team is met with kind greetings at ZAFT but when they try to talk to the leaders of the Earth federation they are set up with the radical division known as Phantom Pain. Ergnes is subjected to a beating and is interrogated of the martians possible intentions. They escape from the Phantom Pain and heads of to meet with the leaders of the Neutral country of Orb.
The country is currently in a leadership crisis, and more radical leaders take control during the team's visit. The new leaders are in league with the racist terrorist organization known as the Blue Cosmos and issue the command to eliminate the genetically enhanced martians. 

The martians face of against a team of Ace pilots from Orb that is aided by Sven Cal Payang, one of the main characters in Mobile Suit Gundam SEED C.E. 73: Stargazer. Ergnes and Nahe manage to fend off the attackers, but in Ergnes battle with Sven, the martian is defeated.

After the Δ Astray became heavily damaged, a new mobile suit called the ∇ Astray (Turn Delta Astray) was introduced as the new title suit. Like the Δ Astray, the ∇ Astray utilizes the Voiture Lumiere technology.

Production
Japanese pop-idol Nami Tamaki produced the song "Identity" as a part of the Delta Astray project.
