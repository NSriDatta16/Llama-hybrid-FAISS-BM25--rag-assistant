The MIÉP–Jobbik Third Way Alliance of Parties (MIÉP–Jobbik a Harmadik Út pártszövetség) was an electoral alliance in Hungary led by István Csurka (Hungarian Justice and Life Party) and Dávid Kovács (Jobbik). In 2005, the Hungarian Justice and Life Party (MIÉP) joined forces with a newer political party, namely the Jobbik (Movement for a Better Hungary), and some members of the agricultural Independent Smallholders Party. The new political formation was registered under the name "Third Way" (Harmadik Út).
