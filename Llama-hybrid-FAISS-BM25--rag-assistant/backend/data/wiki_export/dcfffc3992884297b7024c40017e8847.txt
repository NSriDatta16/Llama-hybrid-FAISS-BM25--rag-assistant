WOOH-LD (channel 29) is a low-power television station licensed to Zanesville, Ohio, United States, but serving the Columbus area with programming from the digital multicast network Heartland. The station is owned and operated by Get After It Media, and maintains a transmitter on Alton-Darby Road near Hilliard, Ohio. 

It was most recently a repeater that broadcast programming from the Trinity Broadcasting Network, via satellite. TBN took the then-W16BT silent on March 26, 2010, due to Trinity's purchase of WSFJ-TV (channel 51), a full power station broadcasting from neighboring Licking County. The station changed its call sign to WOOH-LP on September 20, 2017.
