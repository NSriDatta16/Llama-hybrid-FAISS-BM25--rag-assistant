The Family II is a straight-4 piston engine that was originally developed by Opel in the 1970s, debuting in 1981. Available in a wide range of cubic capacities ranging from 1598 to 2405 cc, it simultaneously replaced the Opel CIH and Vauxhall Slant-4 engines, and was GM Europe's core mid-sized powerplant design for much of the 1980s, and provided the basis for the later Ecotec series of engines in the 1990s.  

The Family II shares its basic design and architecture with the smaller Family I engine (which covered capacities from 1.0 to 1.6 litres) - and for this reason the Family I and Family II engines are also known informally as the "small block" and "big block", respectively - although the 1.6 L capacity was available in either type depending on its fuelling system.

The engine also spawned two diesel variants, the 1.6 L and 1.7 L. 

The engine features a cast iron block, an aluminium head, and a timing belt driven valvetrain. The timing belt also drives the water pump. It was first used in the Opel Kadett D, Ascona C, and their corresponding Vauxhall sister models, the Astra and Cavalier II. Many General Motors subsidiaries, including Daewoo, GM do Brasil, GM Powertrain, and Holden have used this design.

Family II engines for the European and Australasian markets were manufactured by Holden at its Fisherman's Bend plant in Melbourne until 2009, whilst the Americas were supplied from the São José dos Campos plant in the São Paulo region of Brazil.

By 1986, the Family II unit had almost completely replaced the CIH engine as Opel/Vauxhall's core 4-cylinder engine - the CIH continuing only in 2.4L 4-cylinder format,  and in all 6-cylinder applications in the Omega and Senator models until 1994.

The development track of these engines split in 1987, with the introduction of the 20XE; which featured a 16-valve DOHC head, with Holden production of the SOHC versions ending in 2009.  Although SOHC versions stayed in production in Brazil, most DOHC engines were replaced by the all-aluminium GM Ecotec engine family. 

In 2004, a 2.0 L MultiPower engine was made available for the taxi market which could use gasoline, alcohol, and natural gas.

SOHC

These engines formed the basis of the modern Family II lineup, starting with the 16SH (1600S) version in the Opel Kadett D/Ascona C (Vauxhall Astra Mk1/Cavalier Mk2) in 1981. Configuration was limited to a single over head cam, and two valves per cylinder in a cross flow layout (8 valves total). Superficially these engines look similar to the "small block" Family I engine; the key difference to aid identification is the position of the oil filter - on the Family I it is on the front face of the cylinder block, pointing towards front of the car, on the Family II it is adjacent to the crankshaft pulley pointing downwards. The Family II also has a more sophisticated crankcase breathing circuit, with an additional pipe that runs from the crankcase to the camshaft box, with a further pipe running from a small plenum chamber on the rocker cover.

The 1.8-liter versions appeared first in carburetted form (18N) in 1982 and later also in injected (18LE) and further forms. The 2-liter 20NE was introduced in 1986 for the Opel Omega A (Vauxhall Carlton Mk2) and Ascona C3 (Vauxhall Cavalier Mk2c) and served as the base from which the updated 20SEH, and ultimately the 20XE/C20XE "Red Top". The final versions of this engine, labelled Ecotec, evolved from this engine as well.

Early Family II engines had a reputation for rapid camshaft and follower wear (a trait shared with the smaller Family I engine), the problem afflicted Kadett D/Astra I and Ascona C/Cavalier II vehicles fitted with the engine. Improved metallurgy of both the cam lobes and followers, combined with a change to the lubrication specification eventually solved the issue.

Another known issue on the Family II was for the water pump to become jammed into its mounting due to corrosion if the engine was run with no antifreeze; the pump is mounted into an eccentric shaped aperture so it can also function as the timing belt tensioner. If the pump cannot turn then the belt cannot be tensioned. Later versions of the engine were equipped with a separate jockey pulley to combat the issue.

1.6
The 1.6-liter iteration () has an  bore and a  stroke. Opel began production of the 1.6-liter engine in 1980. A diesel fueled version also became available. The diesel produced  at 4600 rpm and  of torque at 2400 rpm. It also had a 23:1 compression ratio and a Bosch injection pump. The diesel featured valves that rotate, increasing durability.

1.7
The 1.7-liter iteration () has an  bore and a  stroke. The 1.7 L version uses diesel fuel. It was developed by Isuzu.

1.8
The 1.8-liter iteration () has an  bore and a  stroke. It was first available in the facelifted Opel Manta B in May 1982, and quickly made its way into a number of other Opel and GM cars. It was originally available as the 18N and the 18S, for low and high octane petrol respectively. The C18NV was first installed in the Opel Rekord E2 from May 1985 and was one of the first catalysed mass market automobiles sold in Germany (and Europe). The Family II engines in a longitudinal installation (for rear-wheel drive) have one major design difference from their transverse mounted counterparts - the distributor is driven by a small drivebelt from the camshaft timing sprocket rather than directly off the transmission end of the camshaft, which on the Manta B and Rekord E2 (both older vehicles that had orginnally been designed around the CIH engine) would have meant the distributor fouling the firewall or being impossible to service.

In 1983, the 1.8 L engine was added to certain North American market J-cars; the engines were imported from Brazil. The LA5 (RPO code) is a turbocharged version that was optional in the North American market from 1984.

2.0
The single overhead camshaft  inline four cylinder engines feature a square  bore and stroke. They also feature fuel injection, an aluminum crossflow cylinder head with a belt-driven overhead camshaft, electronic ignition, a six-bolt flywheel, and a 6,400 rpm redline. Originally, developed by Opel, these engines have been used in Brazilian market vehicles, Korean market vehicles and North American market vehicles; with the first versions appearing in 1981., although did not start appearing in European Opel/Vauxhall models until 1986 - firstly in the Omega A and then in the facelift Ascona C3 for the 1987 model year. 

The North American versions were used primarily in the J-body compact cars from 1983 through 1994 although the turbocharged version did make a brief appearance in the N-body Pontiac Grand Am. The SOHC version also appeared in the Opel Kadett E-based, Daewoo produced, Pontiac LeMans for the US market. In the Brazilian market these engines are still built under the FlexPower name. Differences between the engines are usually emissions related. However, the 20SEH version was more powerful version produced for Opel's sportier models such as the Ascona GT and Kadett GSi, (their corresponding Vauxhall sisters being the Cavalier SRi 130 and the Astra GTE); it featured a more aggressive camshaft, and high compression pistons.

The LT3 (RPO code) or C20GET is a turbocharged version produced in Brazil for the North American market. It featured brilliant red powder coating on the camshaft cover, intake manifold and boost pipe. The engine was equipped with a water-cooled Garrett T-25 turbocharger; however it did not utilize an intercooler. Maximum boost at WOT was .

2.2 
The 2.2 L or  version has an 86mm (3.38 in) bore and a 94.6mm (3.7 in) stroke. It is codenamed C22NE and 22LE.

It was mainly used in the Brazilian market, in the Opel Omega A (Chevrolet Omega in Brazil) with 116 hp and the Opel Vectra B (Chevrolet Vectra in Brazil) with 123 hp. This engine replaced the 2.0 8v C20NE (116 hp) version that was considered weak when fitted to cars like Omega and Vectra, by the Brazilian market, however 2.2L Omega A's for the European market continued to use the older CIH engine, rather than the Family II.

DOHC

The first naturally aspirated DOHC 16-valve version of the 2.0 L— —cast-iron-block engine was introduced in 1988 - derived from the  SOHC 2.0L (20SEH) engines (appearing first in the Opel Kadett E GSi/Vauxhall Astra Mk2 GTE, and later the Opel Vectra A/Vauxhall Cavalier Mk3 GSi 2000) - coming in either non-catalysed (20XE) or catalysed (C20XE) versions.    The engine is commonly nicknamed the Red Top (or just "XE") because of the appearance of the red L-shaped spark plug cover (black colours were available too; the rocker cover was available in silver only).

1994 saw the introduction of the Ecotec series - which again consisted of a DOHC 16-valve cylinder head (this time co-developed with Lotus) mounted atop a development of the Family II block.  The 2-liter versions therefore became the X20XEV, now producing  and taking on the GM Ecotec name. In its final, 1999 iteration, it became the X20XER.  unlike the original 20XE/C20XE these were intended more for mainstream application (as opposed to racing and high-performance applications) in response to tightening emissions standards, and to reflect the overall family car market moving towards multivalve technology as was being increasingly found in competing vehicles.  

Again, these engines have no commonality with the later GM Ecotec engine introduced in 1999, and first used in the Opel Vectra B, which are to a completely different design to the Family II.

Coscast 
This lineup features the same block as the SOHC engines with an  bore and stroke and a Cosworth-developed timing belt-driven double overhead camshaft (DOHC) 16 valve cylinder head (Cosworth Project KB). The cylinder heads were cast and assembled by either Cosworth or, as demand increased, Kolbenschmidt. In general, the heads from this lineup are supposed to flow appreciablу better than their Lotus successors.

The 20XE came into production in 1987. The engine was designed by Cosworth, UK. The engine was originally intended for race application, hence Cosworth's involvement.  At the time of its launch, this engine was something of a milestone unit in Europe and was widely used in motorsport in many specialist race versions.

The engine had a low optimum specific fuel consumption of 232 g/kWh which is equivalent to a maximum efficiency of 37%; a better efficiency than some of the diesel engines that were available at the time of its release. The valves are set at 46° and are accompanied by pistons with shallow valve pockets – thereby eliminating the need for a shorter connecting rod hence, allowing a suitable compression ratio to be achieved. Long spark plugs are used and positioned concentric to the cylinder. Power output was rated at 157 bhp. The later engine were suffixed C20XELN to indicate "Low Noise" revisions (smaller cylinder head port, cast pistons, and different crank bearing size) in line with EU regulations

In 1988 the C20XE was introduced, and was fitted with a catalyst and oxygen sensor in the exhaust. This was due to new emission standards, which forced manufacturers to equip their cars with a catalytic converter and a lambda or oxygen sensor – this requirement permitted the fitment of the Bosch Motronic 2.5 engine management system. Engine power output dropped to 150 bhp. Vauxhall complied with the new emission controls in 1988, although the legislation wasn't law until 1991. Vehicles fitted with the C20XE engine produced before 1991 can have their catalytic converter legally removed, and the vehicle will still comply with MOT regulations.

The C20LET engine was introduced in 1992, and was fitted to the Opel/Vauxhall Vectra Turbo/Cavalier Turbo, Calibra Turbo, and the South African made Opel Astra 200t S. It is similar to the C20XE, apart from the primary addition of a KKK-16 turbocharger, forged Mahle pistons, Bosch Motronic M2.7 electronic engine control unit, and black plastic plenum/'top hat' shroud with a "turbo" script. It produces a DIN rated output of , and generates  of torque. Boost pressure is  continuous with a  overboost.

Some versions of the engine implemented switchable Traction Control (commonly included in the early Astra GSi models). The inlet had a secondary throttle valve sandwiched underneath the primary throttle body. This is closed by a motor/arm assembly when the traction control ECU senses loss of grip/spin at the wheels. The engine was also equipped with a different throttle position sensor (six pin, as opposed to three), and a different coolant temperature sensor (which was black, as opposed to the normal light blue colour).

The engines that appeared in the early 1990s also swapped the cast metal spark plug cover for a cheaper (and less regarded) plastic version. Those used round tooth cambelts while the later used square (with a plastic pre-tensioner). There are also subtle differences between the crankshaft, and visible difference in the pattern of the SFi airbox.

In its last version before production ended, the C20XE came with a new engine management system which included a distributorless ignition system, namely Bosch Motronic 2.8. The last version was called C20LN (Low Noise) and has a stronger engine block.

Porosity issues
In 1991, the Coscast cylinder head was replaced with the GM cylinder head which was manufactured by Kolben-Schmidt. One of the most prominently recognized qualities of the Coscast head is its inherent lack of porosity; this was achieved by pumping the liquid metal into the mold rather than pouring it, hence, minimizing the presence of tiny air bubbles that usually form during the standard casting process. The Coscast head can be identified by a Coscast logo which is stamped under the 3rd exhaust port and a ridge on the head under the distributor.

The GM head was a poured casting, and featured a slightly different oil/water gallery design. These design changes required that a pair of Welch plugs be pressed in at either end of the head. In situations where a complete C20XE is still fitted to a vehicle, the presence of Welch plugs (or lack of) has proven to be the sole means of differentiating between GM and Coscast heads. A reinforced version of the GM head became available in the later years of the C20XE; however, these reinforcements meant that it had smaller inlet/exhaust channels than the other two.

Since an engine's oil circulates at much higher pressures than its coolant, oil in a porous head has a tendency to gradually seep into the coolant galleries. A typical symptom of a porous head is usually a 'mayonnaise'-like substance forming somewhere inside the cooling system (usually, this can be found residing on the coolant reservoir cap). However, depending on the degree of porosity, symptoms of a porous head have a tendency to vary. Many C20XE operators have described the symptom as a curry-like residue or in more severe cases, a thick brown sludge which may overcome the entire cooling system. In such instances, engine oil will readily react with the sulfur in rubber components, hence quickly degrading coolant pipes and hoses to the point of failure. During the porous head debacle, GM faced bankruptcy – therefore dealers failed to recall affected models. Due in part, to the engine's immense prominence and demand, many businesses now specialize in the repair of porous GM C20XE/LET heads – by either sleeving the affected gallery or by injecting a polymer based substance into the porous region. Reportedly, a small number of total GM C20XE cylinder heads ever exhibited significant symptoms of porosity.

Motorsport
The C20XE has seen extensive use in motorsport. Typical uses for the engine have ranged from hillclimb events, to open wheel racing categories. Despite its age, it remains the powerplant of choice for many Formula 3 teams and has most recently found acclaim in the Australian F3 scene where Tim Macrow, the 2007 Australian F3 champion, drove an Opel-Spiess powered car to claim victory. Tuned by Spiess, an F3 grade C20XE is easily capable of producing  in its naturally aspirated form. Many aftermarket tuners have further developed the C20XE for racing purposes. The C20XE was used by the Chevrolet WTCC (World Touring Car Championship) team and the Lada WTCC team. The engine was also an option in Westfield kitcars. The engine is a favourite for both N/A and turbo motoring enthusiasts for its robust design, materials and construction

Ecotec branded models (in association with Lotus)

1.8
The X18XE was branded as Ecotec. All these engines feature an  bore and an  stroke.

2.0
The X20XEV is the first Family II engine branded as Ecotec, a mass-market successor to the C20XE with a Lotus-developed cylinder head. The new cylinder head had a smaller valve angle compared to the older C20XE, to give more torque in the lower revs. It is a  naturally aspirated engine with 16 valves and belt driven double overhead camshafts (DOHC).  bore and stroke in cast-iron OHC-derived cylinder block and aluminium cylinder head. The X20XEV was equipped with exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) to reduce nitrogen dioxide emissions and air injection reactor (AIR) to speed up the warming up of the catalytic converter and to reduce unburnt hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. The engine is capable of producing . A higher output version called the X20XER produced  at 6500 rpm and  at 4300 rpm.

The Z20LET is a turbocharged version of the X20XEV for the Opel Astra G and features an 8.8:1 compression,  and  of torque. From 2005, the Z20LET engine was revised for the Astra H and Zafira B, to three different model designations, Z20LEL, Z20LER and Z20LEH. The differing designations denote the engine power output, ,  and . Further revisions to the original design include under-piston oil cooling, a revised turbocharger unit and the deletion of the contra-rotating balancer shafts in the  Z20LEH engine (as used in the Astra VXR), to reduce mechanical losses. The Z20LEH also features high quality Mahle forged pistons, which are much stronger than the cast pistons fitted to the Z20LET, Z20LEL and Z20LER.

The 2.0-litre X20SED D-TEC 16 Valve DOHC MPFi was built by Holden and used in the Daewoo Nubira.

The L34 also known as the U20SED is a 2.0 L () engine that was built until 2009 by Holden in Australia, dubbed D-TEC by GMDAT (the new Daewoo after the buyout from GM) or E-TEC II by Chevrolet (GM). It has an  bore and stroke. Power is rated at  in South America and Europe,  in Canada, and  in the United States; all are at 5400 rpm and torque is rated at . The engine has been used on the Daewoo Lacetti and its various rebadged models, such as the Chevrolet Optra, Suzuki Reno, and Suzuki Forenza.
