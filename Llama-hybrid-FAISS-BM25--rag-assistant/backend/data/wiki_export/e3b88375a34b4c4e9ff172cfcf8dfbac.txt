History
Before 1947 Malbazar was a very small place, mainly known for its tea gardens mostly owned by British people. Those tea gardens had a few Bengali white collar employees and the work force consisted of tribal people.

After independence of India as well as partition of Bengal refugees from the then East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) started to settle here by cutting down forests. By that time, Narayan Chandra Bannerjee, Dr Amalendu Biswas (came from Pabna), Debaprasad Ghosh(Patal Babu),Dr Tarak Mukherjee, Nripendra nath Choudhary who came there from Dhaka established this city. Bannerjee had earned a lot of respect for his effective medical treatments and social services. He took initiatives to get the refugees settled there in an organised way. As a result, some colonies came up.

Later, due to efforts of Bannerjee, Amalendu Biswas, Nripendra nath Choudhary, Debaprasad Ghosh (Patal Ghosh),Sarat ch Ghosh, Dulal Sengupta, Makhan Bose established Adarsha Bidya Bhaban (a boys' high school). Narayan Chandra Bannerjee and Bipin Bihari Bandyopadhyay established Subhasini Balika Vidyalay (a girls' high school) in the 1950s. The Government Mal Grameen Hospital was established. Biswas contributed a lot as the only dentist of Malbazar. Nath Choudhury had helped the refugees get settled. Soon, the police station was shifted to Malbazar from nearby Kranti.

During that time, Jogesh Chandra Dutta was closely associated with  Narayan Chandra Bannerjee, Amalendu Biswas, Nripendra nath Choudhary and others. Jogesh Chandra Dutta was the only practising ophthalmologist in that area. He was also closely associated with development of Mal RR Primary School.

In the 1970s Malbazar got its fire service station. Later, a street was named after Narayan Chandra Bannerjee. The street is called "Dr. Narayan Banerjee Sarani" just behind Subhasini Balika Vidyalaya and Mal Adarsha Bidya Bhaban.
