History 

GOD TV was founded by Rory and Wendy Alec in England in 1995 as the Christian Channel Europe, the Continent's first daily Christian television network. It started broadcasting on 1 October and was on air for three hours each day, broadcasting between 4am and 7am. This increased to seven hours (4am to 11am) in 1997 and 24-hours in 1999. The 'GOD' logo appeared in 1997 and the Christian Channel was rebranded as the GOD Channel. The GOD Channel became part of the Dream Family Network, later known as GOD Digital and then GOD TV in 2002. The same year GOD TV's broadcast uplink was moved to Israel. This provided for international expansion via satellite and GOD TV was launched across Africa and Asia with new offices in Cape Town and Chennai.

In 2003 a GOD TV office was established in the US in Orlando, FL and in 2005 GOD TV launched across Australia and New Zealand. GOD TV launched on DIRECTV, America's largest satellite platform in 2006 and opened a new office in Colombo, Sri Lanka in 2008. GOD TV also expanded into China during 2008. Further offices were opened in Nairobi and Melbourne in 2009.

Rory Alec was the network's CEO from 1995 to 2014, when GOD TV announced his resignation due to "moral failure." The couple divorced in 2015. Wendy Alec attributed the end of their marriage to Satan leading her husband to have an affair. Wendy Alec took over as president and CEO, a position she held for two years, before appointing Ward Simpson.

Communications scholar Pradip N. Thomas places the history of GOD TV into the larger context of a neo-imperialist project within Christian fundamentalism, comparing GOD TV's Christian Zionist messages to Franklin Graham's travel to wartime Baghdad, which Graham presented as a triumph of Christianity over Islam. Thomas notes that in India, GOD TV provides a platform for a "closing of ranks" among different Indian Christian groups, allowing an expression of Christian unity which is partly a reaction against Hindu nationalism.

In 2014, the network can reach 262 million homes worldwide including 93 million homes in India and employs 200 people with Ward Simpson as president and CEO

David Amsalem, Israeli Minister of Communications, warned GOD TV's Israeli affiliate in May 2020 that it may be in violation of a law against proselytising and risks being shut down. It was later determined to violate said law and was ordered off Israeli airspace a month later in June.

Television satirist and critic Victor Lewis-Smith described GOD TV's programming as "hour upon hour of hate-filled, rabble-rousing, homophobic bigotry, much of it featuring (and funded by) right-wing American evangelists" in 2002.

A coalition of Jewish and Arab human rights groups denounced the project, accusing GOD TV and the JNF of teaming up to force the Bedouin out of the area to make way for Jewish communities.
