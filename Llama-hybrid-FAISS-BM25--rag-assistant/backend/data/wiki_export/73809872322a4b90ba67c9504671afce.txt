Cambridge Seven Associates, Inc. (stylized as CambridgeSeven, and sometimes as C7A) is an American architecture firm based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Buildings designed by the firm have included academic, museum, exhibit, hospitality, transportation, retail, office, and aquarium facilities, and have been built in North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. Besides architecture, it operates in the areas of urban design, planning, exhibitions, graphic, and interior design.

The company was founded in 1962. The original seven partners were Lou Bakanowsky, Ivan Chermayeff, Peter Chermayeff, Alden Christie, Paul Dietrich, Tom Geismar, and Terry Rankine.

CambridgeSeven won the American Institute of Architects Architecture Firm Award in 1993, and was described by the AIA Committee on Design as "an influential and stimulating example, demonstrating new directions of professional practice."
