HMS Example is an  patrol and training vessel of the Royal Navy, based at  in Gateshead, England. Example was originally built for the Royal Naval Auxiliary Service, and was transferred to the Royal Navy when the RNXS disbanded in 1994. On transfer, she retained her name, and became the first ship in the Royal Navy to bear that name.

HMS Example is currently part of the Coastal Forces Squadron, formerly 1st Patrol Boat Squadron. The mission statement of the CFS is to "provide support to allow the conduct of safe and effective P2000 operations in support of the URNU sea-training syllabus"; URNU is acronym for University Royal Naval Unit. Example is attached to the Northumbrian URNU, is based at the shore establishment HMS Calliope in Gateshead, and has a crew of 5 (plus up to 12 students).

Example acts as a training ship for students at Durham, Newcastle, Northumbria, Teesside and Sunderland universities. The ship takes part in deployments over the university summer and Easter holidays, giving the students an opportunity to spend a longer amount of time living on board the ship and to experience larger scale naval operations with other URNUs.

Operational history
Example was built by Watercraft Ltd of Shoreham by Sea and launched in 1985. She was initially delivered to the Royal Navy Auxiliary Service (RNXS) as an auxiliary service vessel with the pennant number A153.
