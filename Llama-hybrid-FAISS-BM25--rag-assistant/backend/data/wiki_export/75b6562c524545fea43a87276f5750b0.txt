The Clarence Schmalz Cup is the Ontario Hockey Association's Junior "C" ice hockey championship and championship trophy. The champions of the Provincial Junior Hockey League (PJHL) are awarded the Cup.  The PJHL was formed in 2016 from the former 8 provincial leagues that previously competed in a tournament, commonly called the All-Ontario Championships, to determine the winner of the Cup.

Tubby Schmalz
The trophy was named in honour of Clarence "Tubby" Schmalz, an administrator from Walkerton, Ontario. He served as the Ontario Hockey Association president from 1969 to 1972. In 1974, the Major Junior A program began operating independently of the association as the Ontario Major Junior Hockey League; Schmalz became the league's first commissioner, a post he held until 1978. He served as vice-chairman of the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association from 1979 to 1981, and as chairman in 1981. The association renamed the OHA Junior C Cup in his memory in 1982, then collaborated with Schmalz's family in the creation of a commemorative trophy case in the lobby of the Walkerton Community Centre.

George S. Dudley Trophy Super "C" champions
This trophy was awarded during the 1970s to a new class of junior hockey known as Super "C".  The teams that competed were deemed to be from centres too small for Junior "B" but yet too big for Junior "C".  The cities that competed for it: Barrie, Woodstock, Kitchener, Owen Sound, and Brantford; struggled throughout that decade to find Junior "B" leagues that suited their needs.  While waiting, these teams generally played "down" in the Junior "C" or "D" level and awaited the Super "C" playoffs.   The class was disbanded by 1976 as the only teams eligible for the championship had found homes in Junior "B".
