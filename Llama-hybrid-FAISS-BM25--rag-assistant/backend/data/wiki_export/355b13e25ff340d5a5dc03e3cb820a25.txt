translated as Super Star Fleet Sazer-X is a tokusatsu superhero TV series produced by Toho Company Ltd., and Konami.  This series is the third in Toho's Seishin (Star God) series. The series lasted 38 episodes and was the last of the Chouseishin franchise. It deviates from its predecessors in several ways, in that it is more comedic in nature and is much more science fiction-orientated in contrast to fantasy.

Synopsis
In the year 2500, Earth has been taken over and covered in darkness by a race known as the Neo-Descal. The remaining members of the human resistance send their trump card weapons, the three Meteor God warships to the past to try to change the future by stopping Neo-Descal in 2005, when their attacks began. Along with the Meteor God warships comes Ad, captain of the Adle Eagle squad and his right-hand man, Gordo, Kane, captain of the Beet-Vizor squad, and the twin Sazers Ein and Zwein, and Remy, who pilots Lio Carrier. Ad and Kane are joined by Takuto Ando, whose grandfather met Captain Shark, leader of the resistance, as a young man and was left with a Knuckle Cross to allow his grandson in 2005 to become the third member of the team known as Sazer X.

Sazer X fight the space pirates known as Descal, and later Neo-Descal when they arrive from the future after the defeat of their ancestors. Captain Shark, known as the Shark Sazer, arrives later from the future, along with his rival, Jackall, a mysterious Sazer-like being who holds one of Shark's greatest secrets.

The Three Shoguns
In episode 38 (final), their Cosmo Capsules first shine and guide them to their home space pirates and they are chosen by Cosmo Capsules to become three of 12 warriors to make a glorious future.

The Three Shoguns
A legendary trio of Space Pirates who gained the nickname of "The Three Shoguns". The first enemies of Sazer-X, they came to Earth under the command of Captain Barder of the Space Pirate Descal fleet with the intent of taking over the Earth, which had once been populated by their ancestors. In the original timeline, they were successful in gathering the twelve Cosmo Capsules, and their wish to take over the Earth plunged it into eternal darkness. Thus, they are the ancestors of the future Space Pirates that rule over Earth.

Fire Shogun Blaird
The leader of the Three Shoguns,  is the strongest fighter of the trio, but he is the least intelligent and tends to become riled up easily. He quickly develops a one-sided rivalry with Takato/Lio-Sazer, vowing to someday "settle the score" and defeat him. After Barder is revealed to be an android, he begins to question the mission of the Three Shogun on Earth. His rivalry with Takuto becomes a grudging friendship, and he joins forces with Sazer-X with the goal of reuniting the Three Shogun and returning to space.

He temporarily joins Jackall against Sazer-X and especially Shark-Sazer. Jackall's eventual death teaches Blaird the folly of a life consumed completely by revenge and combat, and he returns to the side of Sazer-X piloting Jackall's Drill-Angler.

Water Shogun Aqual
The female of the Three Shoguns,  likes to believe that she is the most intelligent of the Three Shogun, and while she is quite smart she is also extremely vain and prideful. She is the one most dedicated to the Three Shogun's original mission to take over Earth, mainly because she loves power and praise. As a result, she is the one that formally breaks up the Three Shogun by discarding Blaird from the group when he begins to question their mission.

When Neo Descal appears, they begin by flattering Aqual as their honored descendant to gain her trust, but this is simply because they cannot kill her without erasing themselves from history. As time goes on, she is relentlessly bullied and humiliated by Neo Descal- especially Grouza until Aqual snaps and attempts to assassinate both leaders. She fails in killing Grouza, and only manages to wound Garade. She is saved from a vengeful Garade by the arrival of King Neo Descal himself.

Aqual soon grows wise to the schemes of the new leaders, and how they have used Cyclead and herself to further their plans. However, she still has to fight against her own pride before she can accept the trust of Sazer-X and finally side with them.
She is jealous at Thundera because of Blaird liking her. She is secretly in love with Blaird.

Wind Shogun Cyclead
The inventor of the Three Shoguns,  is clearly the most intelligent of them, and invents many of the devices that they use in their plans. However, he is also the least dedicated to the plan to take over Earth.

After their original pirate ship is destroyed, he constantly advocates abandoning the whole plan and returning to space. However, he is bullied into staying by Aqual's forceful personality. Because of his inventing abilities, he constantly gets all the credit for the plans implemented by Neo Descal, because even if Aqual came up with the plan it is his machines that get the attention.

When Neo Descal himself arrives to the present, Cyclead is brainwashed with a more aggressive, sadistic personality in order to serve as a distraction while King Neo Descal's real plan is put into motion. He is eventually rescued by Sazer-X, and sides with them and the other two Shoguns.

Allies and Friends

Lightning Shogun Thundera
The fourth Shogun,  is the direct descendant of the shoguns that chose to stay on Earth and live underground, as opposed to the shoguns that chose to flee to space. The door to the surface would only open every million years. A legend in her home stated that the first man she met on the surface world would be her destined man.

According to history, that man was supposed to be Fire Shogun Blaird. He would have obtained the last Cosmo Capsule from her, and that would have plunged the world into darkness. However, due to a mixup, the first man she saw was instead Takuto, and she instantly fell in love with him.

Though Takuto played along at first to obtain the Cosmo Capsule, he eventually confesses that he does not love her and can not live with her. Though she is heartbroken, Takuto apologizes and convinces her that he only had good intentions for his actions. Her heart is moved, and she gives him the last Cosmo Capsule before returning to the underground world.

Future Space Pirate Fleet Neo Descal
Space Pirates from the future, who forced their way through the wormhole in order to back up Descal's Three Shoguns after Barder was destroyed and ensure that their plan to take over the Earth in the past was successful. Although they had open disdain for the Three Shoguns, they risk not killing them as it would erase themselves from history.

 : Neo Descal's ruler, he sent Garade and Grouza to the past to ensure the Neo Descal fleet's existence. But due to their failures, he personally travelled back in time to ensure a future of darkness. Instead of using the Cosmo Capsules to plunge the world into darkness as history dictated, he planned on constructing a massive machine on the Moon called the Dark-Alumer (Dark Armor in Filipino dubbed version) to accomplish this task. He transformed into Black Lio to battle against Lio-Sazer inside the giant monster. He was defeated by Lio-Sazer, however, his memory was still alive. Lio-Sazer, Eagle-Sazer, Beetle-Sazer, and Blaird destroyed the inside part of the monster (Neo Descal's memory) while Remy piloted Great Lio to use the finishing move "Howling Crush" to destroy Neo Descal's monster to make darkness disappear.
 : Barreda was his loyal second-in-command. Her power is icy wind from her breath to freeze victims.  She was killed by Neo Descal in Episode 37 when she was of no further use to him.
 : Garade was the commander of the fleet, and an extremely powerful, though grumpy warrior. He possessed the ability to split into three clones of himself, each equal in power to a member of Sazer-X. He is killed when King Neo Descal arrives from the future and kills Garade for his failures.

Despite working as part of Neo-Descal, he frequently disobeys orders in his quest for vengeance. He keeps losing against Shark but refuses to give up no matter how beaten up he is.

Ryuuseishin

Core-Caliber
The center of the main three Sazer-X mecha formations. It is a humanoid black-and-white fighter (Core-Braver) which is stored upon Lio-Carrier. It is armed with various attacks such as "Core Lasers", 'Brave Shot' which involves firing missiles and its finishing move 'Core Buster'. When hit by an "Optimize Beam" from one of the three Sazer ships, the Core-Caliber can combine with that ship to form a new, more powerful mecha called a Ryuuseishin (Shooting Star God). The transformation/combination call is "X Formation!"

For most of the series, only one Core-Caliber exists. However, towards the end two more are created, allowing all four Ryuuseishin to be formed at the same time.

Ryuuseishin Great-Lio
Formed when the Lio-Carrier ship combines with the Core-Caliber. Piloted by Lio-Sazer and crewed by Capsazer G2 and Remy, Great-Lio specializes in close combat and grappling. Its weapon is the Lio-Cutter, a pair of longswords which can be combined to form the Lio-Javelin, a double-bladed spear.

Its powerful attack is Lio-Impact, where it fires devastating shockwaves from the lion's mouth on its chest.

Its finishing move is the massively powerful Howling Crush, where the Fire energy from the Lio-Javelin smashes into the enemy and obliterates it.

Ryuuseishin Wind-Eagle
Formed when the Adle-Eagle ship combines with the Core-Caliber. Piloted by Eagle-Sazer and crewed by Gordo, Wind-Eagle specializes in fast, mid-range attacks. Its weapon is the Eagle-Rifle and its finishing move is "Twister Shoot", a series of powered rapid-fire shots from the Eagle-Rifle.

Ryuuseishin Magna-Beet
Formed when the Beet-Vizor ship combines with the Core-Caliber. Piloted by Beetle-Sazer and crewed by Twin-Sazer Ein and Twin-Sazer Zwein, Magna-Beet specializes in powerful long range attacks.

Its many weapons include the Megaro-Cannon, the large power cannon on its head. Impact-Cannon, the series of blaster cannons that make up its fingers, Beet Cannon, a pair of larger cannons located on either side of its head, and Beet Missile, a set of missile launchers located on each arm.

Its finishing move is "Beet Buster", where it fires a continuous, charged burst of energy from the cannon on its navel.

Ryuuseishin Shark-Leaguer
Shark-Sazer's personal Ryuuseishin. Unlike the other members of Sazer-X, he does not need to combine his ship with a Core-Calibur in order to form a Ryuuseishin. Instead, the Shark Leaguer takes off from Commander Shark's ship, the Shark-Base, and undergoes a simple transformation into its Ryuuseishin form with the command "X Formation!". Its weapon is Sword-Pressure and its finishing move is "Hydro Slash".

Drill-Angler
The personal mecha of Jackall. Like the Shark-Leaguer, it functions both as a ship and as a combat mecha, undergoing a transformation activated by the call "Battle Formation!".  Its specialty is close-range combat, and its main weapons are the massive, powerful drill mounted on its chest and the jagged cutters on its arms.

Fire Shogun Blaird inherits the machine after Jackall, using it to assist Sazer-X and their mecha.
