The 1992â€“93 OHL season was the 13th season of the Ontario Hockey League. The Cornwall Royals become the Newmarket Royals. The Detroit Compuware Ambassadors are renamed the Detroit Junior Red Wings. The inaugural OHL Humanitarian of the Year is awarded. Sixteen teams each played 66 games. The Peterborough Petes won the J. Ross Robertson Cup, defeating the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds.

Relocation and Rebranding

Cornwall Royals to Newmarket Royals

The Cornwall Royals relocated to the city of Newmarket, Ontario and were named the Newmarket Royals. The team would play at the Newmarket Recreational Complex.

The club was established in 1969 in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, as Cornwall won the Memorial Cup three times, in 1972, 1980 and 1981. Prior to the 1981-82, the Royals transferred to the Ontario Hockey League. After joining the OHL, the club was made the post-season in ten of their eleven seasons.

Newmarket would remain in the Leyden Division following the relocation.

Detroit Compuware Ambassadors to Detroit Junior Red Wings

The Detroit Compuware Ambassadors rebranded their team into the Detroit Junior Red Wings. The Junior Red Wings would continue to share Joe Louis Arena with the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League.

The club would use the familiar Red Wings logo and change their colours to red and white to match the NHL team.
