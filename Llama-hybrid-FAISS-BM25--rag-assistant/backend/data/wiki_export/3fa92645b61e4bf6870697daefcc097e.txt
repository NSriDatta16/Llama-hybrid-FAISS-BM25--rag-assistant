On 18 February 2021, Universal Music Group announced Virgin Music Label & Artist Services, a new global network to deliver premium and flexible artist and label services.

Following its launch, Universal Music Group retained Caroline Distribution president Jacqueline Saturn, to head Virgin Music label and artist services division of Virgin Music Group. On 15 June 2022, Virgin Music launched its flagship in Africa, under the leadership of Franck Kacou, the current general manager, who serves as the managing director of Universal Music Africa as Virgin Music Africa. In September 2022, Universal Music Group announced the launch of Virgin Music Group. Following its launch, its Label & Artist Services began operating as Virgin Music. On 22 September 2022, Sumerian Records signed a distribution deal with Virgin Music.
