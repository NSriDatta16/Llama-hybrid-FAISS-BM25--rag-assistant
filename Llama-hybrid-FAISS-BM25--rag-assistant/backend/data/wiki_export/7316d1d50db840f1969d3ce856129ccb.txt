Bjørn Richard Sundquist (born 16 June 1948) is a Norwegian actor, famous for TV, theatre, and movie roles.

For many years he worked at Det Norske Teatret and Nationaltheateret in Oslo. Sundquist is especially famous for the roles as Merlin and Hamlet.

When he received the Honorary Amanda Award (Norway's answer to Oscar) in 2000, he became the youngest ever recipient of the greatest honor in Norwegian film. He was 52 at the time and only a few months younger than Liv Ullmann, who received the honorary award in 1992.

He is of Sami heritage on his mother's side (a minority originating mainly from the northern parts of the Scandinavian peninsula often referred to as Sápmi). He has had several TV-roles for both NRK, the biggest Norwegian television channel, and Norway's largest commercial channel, TV2. Sundquist has been awarded both a Gullruten and an Amanda award for his leading role as police chief Inspector Konrad Sejer in the television miniseries Sejer.

Sundquist is humorously said to appear in every single Norwegian movie, due to his popularity and versatility.
