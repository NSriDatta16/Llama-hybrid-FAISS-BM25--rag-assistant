Origin and history
Bakmi consists of two Hokkien Chinese words, which literally translates to English as "meat noodles" (, ). 

Chinese influences is evident in Indonesian food, such as bakmi, mie ayam, pangsit, mie goreng, and kwetiau goreng. The words mie and bami, used in Dutch, come from bakmi and were introduced into the Dutch language during the Dutch colonial period in Indonesia. Indonesian food is very popular in the Netherlands, and bami goreng (fried bakmi) is a popular dish. 

In Thailand, wheat-based egg noodles are known as bami, which  may be ordered as bami nam or bami haeng (egg noodles with soup and without soup respectively), and the noodles may be used in Chinese style stir-fried dishes.

In the Philippines, there is a similar noodles dish called Pancit Bam-i or Pancit Mami, where it is called bam-i in Cebuano Bisaya, or mami / bami in Tagalog (Filipino).

Ingredients

The most common type of bakmi in Indonesia is mi kuning or 'yellow noodles' made from finely ground wheat, sometimes enriched with eggs as mi telur (egg noodle) made into dough, ground and run through holes to create noodle strings. The traditional way to create bakmi is by pulling the dough several times coated with flour to create the noodle strings, similar to the method to make lamian.

Bakmi is normally boiled for serving. When bakmi is intended for use in soup, it is usually boiled separately from the broth. The noodles are usually mixed with animal fats, either from pork, chicken or beef. The noodles are then served with various toppings: an example would include a few slices of char siu (叉燒) or barbecued pork, with addition of Chinese green vegetables and a bowl of broth.
