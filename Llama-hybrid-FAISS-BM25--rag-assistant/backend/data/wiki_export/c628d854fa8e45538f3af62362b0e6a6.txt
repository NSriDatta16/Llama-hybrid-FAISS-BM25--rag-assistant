Karunas first appeared in the lead role in the comedy drama, Dindigul Sarathy (2008), portraying an insecure man with an inferiority complex.

In between the films, he also essayed serious performances, and was briefly involved in the making of Thanga Meengal (2013) before it underwent a change of cast, while he was successful for his role in Santosh Sivan's war drama film, Ceylon (2014). His films as the lead hero, gradually had lower key promotions than the previous ones, and in 2015, Karunas announced he would not appear in any further lead roles. He subsequently made a return to starring supporting roles thereafter, being successful for his performance of a suicidal man in Darling (2015) and as a villager in Komban (2015), which became his hundredth film.
