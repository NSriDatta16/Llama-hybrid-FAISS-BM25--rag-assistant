As a Division of Applied Research Associates, Inc. 
In 2009, Virtual Heroes was acquired by Applied Research Associates, Inc. (ARA), a New Mexico-based scientific engineering and research firm. In 2012, Virtual Heroes became the Virtual Heroes Division of ARA managed by Virtual Heroes CTO Randy Brown. 

As part of ARA, Virtual Heroes developed several serious games for medical and science training. In 2009, Virtual Heroes released Zero Hour: America's Medic, which was described by Wired Magazine as "training first responders for real-life natural disasters and terrorist attacks". The project was developed with George Washington University's Office of Homeland Security on a 4.8 Million dollar grant from the Department of Homeland Security.

In July, 2010 Virtual Heroes released Moonbase Alpha as a free download on Steam.  Moonbase Alpha provides gameplay on the moon based on accurate NASA equipment at the time for the Constellation Program. The game was made by Virtual Heroes and the Army Game Studio, developers of America's Army, in conjunction with NASA Learning Technologies. Moonbase Alpha was designed as a tech demo to test ideas to be used in Astronaut: Moon, Mars and Beyond, NASA's massively multiplayer online game. It was also designed to encourage an interest in space exploration in school children. [ref: https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/526940main_Moonbase_Alpha_Educator_Guide_v1.pdf]

In 2014 Virtual Heroes developed the Combat Medic serious game for the U.S. Army's Simulation and Training Technology Center. The game trains medics to treat internal bleeding, lung collapse, and tracheobronchial injury (airway trauma), the top three causes of battlefield deaths. It incorporates material from the US Army Medical Department's 68W Advanced Field Craft Combat Medic Skills textbook. The game is available for use by all U.S. military branches.

In 2018, Virtual Heroes won a $2.6M contract with the US Army to develop a 3D trainer for medics to treat serious burn injuries.
