The unit was renamed from its former title 39th (Personnel Support) Battalion (39 PSB) on 27 March 2014. 39 PSB was formerly known as the Deployed Forces Support Unit until being formally renamed at a special ceremony on 8 August 2006 at the Shrine of Remembrance in Melbourne.

The unit perpetuates the name of the famous 39th Battalion, an infantry battalion that fought during both World War I and World War II, which played a significant part in the Kokoda Track Campaign in 1942â€“43, fighting against the Japanese. It is a Tri-Service Direct Command Unit of Forces Command, and is based at Randwick, New South Wales.
