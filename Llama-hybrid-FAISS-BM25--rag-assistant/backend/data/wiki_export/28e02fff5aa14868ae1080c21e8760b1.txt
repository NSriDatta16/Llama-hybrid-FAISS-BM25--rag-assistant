The Detroit Diesel Series 92 is a two-stroke cycle, V-block diesel engine, produced with versions ranging from six to 16 cylinders. Among these, the most popular were the 6V92 and 8V92, which were V6 and V8 configurations of the same engine respectively. The series was introduced in 1974 as a rebored version of its then-popular sister series, the Series 71. Both the Series 71 and Series 92 engines were popularly used in on-highway vehicle applications.

History
The Series 92 engines were introduced in 1974. Compared to the Series 71 engines they were derived from, the Series 92 featured a larger bore of  and an identical stroke of  for a nominal displacement per cylinder of , from which the Series 92 derives its name.

While the basic mechanics of the 92 series indicated superior performance and durability, early prototypes were challenged by breakdowns resulting from the torque inherent in the design. Carl Kamradt, the senior engineer in Detroit Diesel Allison's E5, or Experimental Department, was responsible for working through the practical applications of the engine, resulting in the 92 Series becoming the favored choice for applications requiring high torque and dependability. Upon Mr. Kamradt's retirement in 1984, the E-5 division was eliminated as the 92 Series ran its course.
In the 1980s and early 1990s, the Series 92 was used as a major bus engine in North America. It was also available for several other applications: Trucks, buses, motor homes, construction, fire trucks/apparatus, industrial equipment, several military vehicles, aircraft and marine applications.

The Series 92 left the market in the summer of 1995 and the four stroke Detroit Diesel engine Series 60 was introduced as a replacement.

Model number
The model number indicates the basic configuration of the engine. The model designator consists of the number of cylinders (6, 8, 12, or 16), the block layout (V), engine series (92), and a lettered suffix which provides information about forced induction (T for turbocharged, A for aftercooled), so for instance, an 8V92TA designates a Series 92 V8 engine that is turbocharged and aftercooled.
