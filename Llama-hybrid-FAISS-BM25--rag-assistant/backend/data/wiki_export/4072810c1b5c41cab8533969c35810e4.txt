Plot summary 
Several months have passed since the events of the first novel, when Gregor and his baby sister Boots first fell into the subterranean kingdom of Regalia (a part of the "Underland") and undertook a quest to save their father, who was being held prisoner by a group of Underland rats. The Underland humans supported the siblings' mission because they believed it was prophesied by their founder, Bartholomew of Sandwich. At the beginning of the second novel, the Underland humans kidnap Boots to force her and Gregor (whom they call the "Warrior") to participate in another one of their prophecies. They interpret "The Prophecy of Bane" to mean that Gregor must kill a white rat (the "Bane") in order to prevent the humans' main enemies, the rats, from taking over the realm. A set of lines about a dying baby "turn[ing] the Warrior weak" convince the humans that Boots is in danger, and so the Regalians offer to protect Boots in within the walls of their castle. Gregor sails off on an underground ocean with only a few soldiers and their giant bats to hunt the Bane in the Labyrinth, an uncharted maze of caverns deep in the Underland's rat lands.

During their journey, the quest members are caught in a whirlpool, encounter an island of carnivorous insects, which results in Howard's bat, Pandora, being eaten alive, and are betrayed by the two shiners (fireflies) who were hired to provide them with light. Gregor himself begins to struggle with a new "power" that manifests when he is in battle. He is what the Underland creatures call a "rager", a person who is overcome by a kind of "battle-fury" when they fight, making them completely deadly even without training. Gregor and his bond Ares' worst trouble, however, is when they and the remaining questers become separated from the human queen Luxa, the cockroach Temp, and Boots during a fight with some serpents. The three missing are assumed dead, and Gregor finds himself emotionally frozen at the thought of having lost his baby sister.

When he and Ares finally find the Bane, he learns that it is not an adult monster, as was assumed, but instead a baby rat whose parents killed each other in battle. He can not bring himself to kill it, and so he and Ares take it to be raised by the only friendly rat they know: Ripred. After this, the two return to Regalia, where Nerissa, Luxa's cousin, has just been crowned queen. The surviving quest members - the bat Andromeda, human Howard, Ares, and Gregor - are tried for treason because they failed to kill the Bane. They are saved, though, by Nerissa, who controversially decrees it is good that Gregor was not heartless enough to kill a baby. Shortly thereafter, Gregor is trying to finally face the reality of going home without Boots when she is suddenly returned to the palace, having been saved in turn by Luxa, Temp, and an unnamed moth. The two then return to the surface world.

Reception

Gregor and the Prophecy of Bane received critical acclaim, especially for its treatment of difficult issues in a way that is accessible for young readers. VOYA reviewer Nancy K. Wallace notes the discussions of revenge, murder, and betrayal. She remarks on how Gregor is "prepared to heartlessly slaughter The Bane" yet overcomes his "hatred for the rats that killed his sister", but must still "face charges of treason" for his apparent betrayal of his duties. Timnah Card of the Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books describes how Gregor is "disturbed to discover his unsuspected capacities as a warrior". In a similar way, the book's Kirkus Reviews review notes the way that "humor and terror alternate" throughout the story. The Children's Cooperative Book Center (CCBC) of the University of Wisconsin–Madison wrote "Scenes...range from fast to funny to deliciously frightening. Gregor also faces several moral choices. As in the first volume of The Underland Chronicles, there is plenty of humor and plenty of intense action in this riveting, fast-paced novel."

More generally, School Library Journal said, "This is a strong choice for fantasy fans, including reluctant readers, even if they're not familiar with Gregor's first adventure." Kathy L. Fiedler of the Kutztown University Book Review called the novel "a hit with young readers, especially those who've enjoyed The City of Ember by Jeanne DuPrau". Several critics, including Publishers Weekly, lauded the novel specifically as a sequel to the well-received Gregor the Overlander. Wallace calls Gregor and the Prophecy of Bane a "welcome sequel", going on to state that "on the last page, the scene is skillfully set for [further sequels]". The Horn Book Magazine similarly stated, "Gregor’s fans will cheer the promise of future visits." On a more negative note, Peg Glisson writes for Children's Literature that "those who have not read the first Gregor will be at a slight disadvantage. Collins tries to weave necessary details from Gregor's first visit to the Underworld into this one, but it definitely slows the early chapters down and is not completely satisfying." Ed Sullivan of Booklist claims "...fans will not be disappointed with this exciting, action-packed sequel", although he also warns "readers unfamiliar with the first novel will be at a disadvantage [as] Collins assumes knowledge of the characters and developments from the first book".

The CCBC also praised the book for its portrayal of strong and healthy sibling relationships as it "[continued] the saga of two contemporary siblings navigating their way through unfamiliar territory". Card says, "Gregor's parents' inability to care for their children after the return of his father in the first book sets the stage for this second journey, in which the counsel of adults is well meant but morally ambiguous and Gregor's own wisdom must carry the day. That continuing realism wraps the mile-a-minute adventure in a satisfyingly complex political and social network and provides the whole with a compelling emotional foundation. Throughout, the motivations and growth of individual characters drive the action..." Glisson writes as well of how Gregor has "matured since his last adventure" and "learns to deal with the fact that he is a "rager," a deadly and efficient fighter."

Gregor and the Prophecy of Bane was on the New York Times and Book Sense Bestseller lists. It was also a Book Sense Children's Pick for 2005. The book has received several other awards as well. In 2005, it was a Connecticut Book Award Finalist and a Cooperative Children's Book Center recommended book. In 2007, it was nominated for the Sequoyah Children's Book Award, but did not win.
