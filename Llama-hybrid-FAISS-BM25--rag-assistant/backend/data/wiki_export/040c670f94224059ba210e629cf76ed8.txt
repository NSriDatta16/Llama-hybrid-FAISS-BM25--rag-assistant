Music career

Animal Logic (1987–1991)
In 1987, Holland won the audition to be the lead singer and songwriter of Animal Logic, after a two-song demo tape was forwarded to Police drummer Stewart Copeland by publisher Dan Howell. She was selected over hundreds of other singers who auditioned for the band. Holland is credited with writing nearly all the songs recorded by the group.

Animal Logic released their debut album Animal Logic in 1989, peaking at No. 106 on the Billboard 200. A second album, Animal Logic II was released in 1991.

Both albums featured guest appearances from well-known musicians, including: Jackson Browne, David Lindley, George Duke, Steve Howe and Freddie Hubbard.

The band toured and appeared on The David Letterman Show, The Tonight Show, and had videos on MTV and VH1.

In a March 2020 interview with sterwartcopeland.com, Deborah confirmed that Animal Logic has been working on material for a new EP: “We’re in the process of finishing up five songs though the bulk of the work is now on Stanley’s shoulders and he has a crazy schedule so it may take a while.”

Solo recordings (1988–2007)
In the years following the demise of Animal Logic, Holland released five solo albums, and has recorded and performed music for movies, television and commercials.

In 1988 Deborah recorded "Come To Me" from the movie Fright Night Part 2. She also contributed to the I.R.S. Records compilation Just In Time For Christmas (1990), providing the song "It Only Comes Once a Year".

She has scored five films, including Circuitry Man, and has had two collaborations with Stewart Copeland used in films; "Heaven is a Place" in the 1991 movie Highlander II: The Quickening, and "For One Moment" in the 1992 television movie Afterburn.

More recently, Holland's songs have appeared in the television shows Keeping Up with the Kardashians, My Name Is Earl, and Longmire.

The Refugees (2007–2012)
In 2007 Holland formed a folk supergroup called The Refugees, with Wendy Waldman and Cidny Bullens.  The group released their first album Unbound in 2009, which won the International Acoustic Music Award for Best Album. The Refugees' second album, Three, was released in 2012 and made the Folk DJs' Top 20 charts as well as charting on Roots Music Report's TOP 50 Folk charts. The trio toured extensively throughout the U.S. and in Canada appearing at venues, arts centers, folk clubs, and festivals, including the Philadelphia Folk Festival, Wheatland Music Festival, Canmore Folk Festival, the Iowa Women's Music Festival and more.

Vancouver (2013)
Holland's most recent album, Vancouver, was released June 2013. The album is her first CanCon recording and received international radio play.
