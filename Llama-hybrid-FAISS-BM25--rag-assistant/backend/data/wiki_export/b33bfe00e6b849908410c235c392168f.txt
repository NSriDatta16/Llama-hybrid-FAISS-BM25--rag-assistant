April – Massachusetts mafia captain Vincent M. Ferrara has his jail sentence ended by a US District Court six years before the original set date due to prosecutor Jeffrey Auerhahn using an illegal court tactic. In 1992 Ferrara pleaded guilty to racketeering, extortion, gambling and ordering the 1985 murder of Vincent "Jimmy" Limoli. Ferrara had only agreed to plead guilty to the murder because he was presented with a witness, one Walter Jordan. The witness, however, recanted his testimony before Ferrara testified. Auerhahn did not tell Ferrara this and so the District Court overturned the sentence.
