Fengsu Tongyi (), also known as Fengsu Tong (风俗通), is a book written about 195 AD by Ying Shao, who lived during the later Eastern Han period. The manuscript is similar to an almanac, which describes various strange and exotic matters of interest to the literati of the period, such as cultural practices, mystical beliefs, and musical instruments.

Chapters
There were originally a total of 30 chapters, but only 10 remain. These chapters were recompiled by the Northern Song scientist Su Song (蘇頌) from the works of Yu Zhongrong (庾仲容) and Ma Zong (馬總). Some fragments of the lost chapters exist as quotations in other Chinese texts.
