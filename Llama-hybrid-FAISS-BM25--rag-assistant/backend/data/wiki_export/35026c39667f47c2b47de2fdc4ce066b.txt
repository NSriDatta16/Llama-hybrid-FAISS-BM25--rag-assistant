Pumpkinhead: Ashes to Ashes is a 2006 made-for-television supernatural slasher horror film and the third installment in the Pumpkinhead film series of horror films. The film is directed by Jake West (Evil Aliens), who co-wrote the screenplay with Barbara Werner.

Plot 
Pumpkinhead: Ashes to Ashes plotline follows more closely to the first film, with townspeople angered over the local mortician stealing and selling the organs of their loved ones and then dumping the corpses in a swamp, rather than cremating them. When the townspeople find out, they have the old witch Haggis summon Pumpkinhead through the mummified body of Ed Harley (played by Lance Henriksen, who reprises his role from the first film). Pumpkinhead then proceeds to go on his killing rampage murdering all those responsible for the desecration, while Doc Frasier (Doug Bradley) hurries to murder those who summoned Pumpkinhead, which will effectively kill the demon in the process.

Reception 

Ian Jane of DVD Talk rated it 2/5 stars and criticized its "cheap, shoddy filmmaking". Dread Central rated it 2/5 stars and wrote: "Despite the cast and crew's obvious devotion to the original, Ashes to Ashes hits every pitfall in the low-budget realm". Virginia Heffernan of The New York Times called it unmemorable and "rote slasher stuff". In an interview with YouTuber Comic Book Girl 19, Lance Henriksen expressed his disappointment with the film.
