History

Today, students attending Burnaby South go to school in a modern building constructed in 1993 at 5455 Rumble Street.

The first Burnaby South Secondary school opened with 175 students in 1922 at 6626 Kingsway, in an old building built in 1913 that previously served as Kingsway East Elementary school.

Over the years, the school expanded to accommodate more students. A new stucco building was constructed on the grounds in 1940, and in the 1960s, a new vocational wing was added, with a cafeteria and room for vocational programs.

The decision was made in 1991 to construct a new school which was built in time for the start of the school year in September 1993.

Developed as a Year 2000 school, the building incorporated a significant amount of technology, including monitors in all the halls and classrooms in place of PAs and a card swipe attendance system. 
Former B.C. Premier Christy Clark graduated from Burnaby South in 1983.

Feeder schools include Clinton, Glenwood, Maywood, Nelson, South Slope/BC School for the Deaf, Stride Avenue, Suncrest, Taylor Park, and Windsor.

Facilities include two tournament sized gymnasiums, a fitness/dance room, a weight room, a wrestling room, and a large indoor running track encircling the physical education facility; a professional 600 seat community theatre, called The Michael J. Fox Theatre; lab facilities in science, home economics, art, drama, business education, and technology education; and Southpoint, the school store run by Marketing students.
