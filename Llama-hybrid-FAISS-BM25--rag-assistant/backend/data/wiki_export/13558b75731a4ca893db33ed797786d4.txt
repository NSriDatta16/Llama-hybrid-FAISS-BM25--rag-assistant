The Abhira kingdom in the Mahabharata is either of two kingdoms near the Sarasvati river.
They were dominated by the Abhiras, sometimes referred to as Surabhira also, combining both Sura and Abhira kingdoms. Modern day Abhira territory lies within Northern areas of Gujarat and Southern Rajasthan, India.

Reference to Abhiras in literature
The Sabha-parva and Bhisma-parva sections of the Mahabharata mention the province of Abhira, situated near what once was the Sarasvati River in ancient Sind. According to sage Markandeya, the Abhiras rule the earth in Kaliyuga. Vātsyāyana also mentions the Abhira kingdoms in the Kama Sutra. References of Abhira being residents of kingdom ruled by Yudhisthira is found in Bhagwatam.

Abhiras are mentioned as warriors in support of Duryodhana in Mahabharta war. The Gopas, whom Krishna had offered to Duryodhana to fight in his support when he himself joined Arjuna's side, were no other than the Yadavas themselves, who were also the Abhiras. Their king Chitra, was killed by Prativindhya, the son of Yudhishthira and Draupadi. The Abhiras also have been described as Vratya Kshatriyas. The Abhir, Gopa, Gopal. and Yadavas are all synonyms. They defeated the hero of Mahabharatha war, sparing him when he disclosed the identity of the members of the family of Sri Krishna. Arjuna had killed all Kauravas and was defeated by Gopas (Abhiras) was only Hari's play.
