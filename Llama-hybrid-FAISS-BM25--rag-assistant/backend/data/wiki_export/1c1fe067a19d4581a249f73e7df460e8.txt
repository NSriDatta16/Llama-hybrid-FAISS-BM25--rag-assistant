Steven George Andrascik (born November 6, 1948) is a Canadian retired professional ice hockey right winger. He played one game in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the New York Rangers during the 1972 Stanley Cup playoffs, and 97 games in the World Hockey Association with the Indianapolis Racers, Michigan Stags/Baltimore Blades, and Cincinnati Stingers from 1974 to 1976.

Playing career
Andrascik was born in Sherridon, Manitoba. He was drafted by the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League (NHL) in the 1968 NHL Amateur Draft in the first round, eleventh overall. On November 1, 1970, the Red Wings traded Andrascik to the New York Rangers for Don Luce. After five years in the Central Hockey League and American Hockey League, Andrascik made it to the NHL for one game in the 1972 playoffs for the Rangers, on April 23, 1972 against the Chicago Black Hawks; he recorded no points and no penalty minutes.

About a year after playing his single NHL game, the Rangers traded him to the Pittsburgh Penguins. Instead of joining Pittsburgh, he joined the Indianapolis Racers of the World Hockey Association (WHA) for the 1974–75 season. Only 20 games into the season, he, along with Steve Richardson, were traded to the Michigan Stags for Jacques Locas and Brian McDonald. In the 1975–76 season, Andrascik played for yet another WHA team, the Cincinnati Stingers.

In total, Andrascik played one NHL game and 97 WHA games, scoring 9 goals, 13 assists and 22 points.
