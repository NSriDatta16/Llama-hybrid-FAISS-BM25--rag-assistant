The 17th congressional district of Ohio is an obsolete congressional district last represented by Representative Tim Ryan.

This district became obsolete for the 113th Congress in 2013 as congressional district lines were redrawn to accommodate the loss of the seat as a result of the 2010 Census. Most of the territory within the current 17th district has been merged into the Akron-based 13th district.
