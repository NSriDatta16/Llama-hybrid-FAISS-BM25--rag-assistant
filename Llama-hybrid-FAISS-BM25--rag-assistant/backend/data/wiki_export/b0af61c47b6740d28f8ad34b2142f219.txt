Bavaria used the South German gulden (also called 'Florin') as its currency until 1873. Between 1754 and 1837 it was a unit of account, worth  of a Conventionsthaler, used to denominate banknotes but not issued as a coin. The Gulden was worth 50 Conventionskreuzer or 60 Kreuzer Landm√ºnze.

The first Gulden coins were issued in 1837, when Bavaria entered into the South German Monetary Union, setting the Gulden equal to four sevenths of a Prussian Thaler. The Gulden was subdivided into 60 Kreuzer. In 1857, the Gulden was set equal to four sevenths of a Vereinsthaler.

The Gulden was replaced by the Mark at a rate of 1 Mark = 35 Kreuzer.
