A by-election was held in the Welsh parliamentary constituency of Islwyn on 16 February 1995 following the resignation on 20 January of Neil Kinnock who was appointed as a European Commissioner.

Whilst being a safe Labour seat and a comfortable victory, the Conservative party suffered a serious drop in support which saw them lose their deposit, gaining less than 5% of the vote. The Conservative candidate, Robert Buckland, would later be elected as MP for South Swindon 15 years later, and would go on to serve in the cabinet.
