Lap Quilting with Georgia Bonesteel is a "how to" show on PBS hosted by Georgia Bonesteel. The show debuted in 1979 on UNC-TV and has been on the air for over 40 years. By 1983, it was being distributed out of Boston to 120 major PBS stations, including Chicago's WYCC. The show shares different quilting techniques and styles from around the United States and the world.

Overview
The series shows viewers how to make quilts using a particular type of quilting known as lap quilting. Traditional quilting uses a hoop or frame which the fabric is stretched across. Lap quilting does not use a frame.

Viewers are shown various project ideas and different quilting and sewing techniques they can try at home. Tips and tricks are also provided, such as how often to replace the  needle in their sewing machines.

The series was one of the first how-to shows produced by UNC-TV—along with The Woodwright's Shop—to be broadcast around the United States. The show has been broadcast on over 200 PBS stations across the country. This series was started after Bonesteel had been a guest on an early PBS series Sewing Is Fun.
