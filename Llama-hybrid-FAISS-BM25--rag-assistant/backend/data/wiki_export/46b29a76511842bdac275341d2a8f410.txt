Vinkenbuurt is a hamlet in the Dutch province of Overijssel. It is part of the municipality of Ommen, and lies about 18Â km south of Hoogeveen.

It was first mentioned in 1867 as Vinkenbuurt. The romantic explanation is "neighbourhood with chaffinchs" or it might mean "neighbourhood with bad peat". In 1927, a church was constructed, and given its population, it could qualify as a village, but probably remained a hamlet due its spread out farms.
