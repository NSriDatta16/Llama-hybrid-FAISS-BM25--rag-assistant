Mont Kiara, often stylized as Mont' Kiara and MK, is an affluent suburb at the northwest of downtown Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in the constituency of Segambut. It consists mainly of high-rise residential condominiums and office complexes which were mostly developed by UEM Sunrise Berhad, a well-known property development arm of UEM Group. It is located in the heart of Klang Valley, halfway between Kepong and downtown Kuala Lumpur. It is adjacent to Sri Hartamas in the south and KL Metropolis in the east, and is heavily populated by expats.

While the name "North Kiara" refers to the area near Bukit Segambut as it is located north of Mont Kiara, the name has been used by developers up till now to link their property developments to the suburb.

Plaza Mont Kiara

Plaza Mont Kiara is a resort office-retail complex in Mont Kiara that attracts a high number of expatriates, representing more than 30 nationalities; particularly the Japanese, Koreans and Singaporeans, who comprise almost half the total residential population in Mont Kiara. Plaza Mont Kiara is made up of restaurants, cafes, gyms as well as several banks serving the neighborhood. 

Plaza Mont Kiara organises the Mont Kiara Funday "Arts, Bric-a-Brac & Crafts" (ABC) Market launched in March 2000, showcasing 100 exhibitor stalls spread over a  fountain courtyard in its plaza. The ABC Market epitomises the "Made-in-Asia" dream featuring an amalgam of culture, arts and crafts where there are antiques, books, vintage apparel, clothing, household decorative items, educational toys, children wears, crafts, jewellery, bags and shoes, potted plants, fruits, and Asian food. The daytime market is held on Sundays. The ABC Market attracts at least 3,000 people throughout the day. Operated by Sunrise Berhad, it serves mainly to promote Malaysian arts and crafts to the public. Over the years the market has become part of the lifestyle of residents in Plaza Mont Kiara. A night market called Fiesta Nite at Plaza Mont Kiara is held at the fountain courtyard every Thursday.

Accessibility

Car
Mont Kiara is located right next to the intersection of four expressways – New Klang Valley Expressway E1, North–South Expressway Northern Route E1, Duta–Ulu Klang Expressway (DUKE) E33 and Sprint Expressway E23. The Jalan Duta toll plaza, the beginning of the northern sector of PLUS Expressway, is located just outside the northern end of Mont Kiara. The DUKE expressway connects Mont' Kiara to either Ampang, Ulu Klang or Gombak, which interchanges with the Kuala Lumpur Middle Ring Road 2 28 and East Coast Expressway E8. The Kerinchi Link, part of the Sprint network, enables motorists travelling from Mont Kiara or Kepong to reach the industrial city of Petaling Jaya while bypassing downtown Kuala Lumpur completely.

Public transport
The nearest rail station to Mont Kiara is the  Segambut Komuter station, about 10–15 minutes' drive away. RapidKL bus route 190 (formerly U7) links Mont Kiara to Segambut KTM Komuter station. However, pursuant to track upgrading works on the KTM tracks, services at Segambut station are reduced to 13 trains a day only. 

Alternately, RapidKL bus route T818 connects Desa Sri Hartamas (across the Sprint Expressway from Mont Kiara proper) to the  Pusat Bandar Damansara MRT station. 

Since 1 December 2017 Mont Kiara is directly served by RapidKL bus route T852, also to Pusat Bandar Damansara MRT station. This route however runs from 06:00 to 22:30 only, while the aforementioned 190 and T818 routes serve until midnight.

The area is planned to be served by the  Mont Kiara MRT station in the future which will be an underground station as part of the proposed MRT Circle Line.
