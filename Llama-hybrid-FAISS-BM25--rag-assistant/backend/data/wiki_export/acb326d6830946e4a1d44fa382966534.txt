John Jay High School is a public high school in the Northside Independent School District of San Antonio, Texas, United States, which generally serves the northwest portion of the city.

History 
All high schools in the Northside Independent School District (NISD) are named for US Supreme Court Justices, and the first Supreme Court Chief Justice was John Jay.  John Jay High also contains a magnet school, the John Jay Science and Engineering Academy.

Student Locator Project 
On October 1, 2012, the high school and Anson Jones Middle School began the controversial "Student Locator Project."  Students were required to wear school IDs embedded with RFID microchips at all times. Student Andrea Hernandez was suspended from the school for refusing to wear the badge for religious reasons, linking it to the "mark of the beast" in the biblical book of Revelation. The Rutherford Institute filed a suit on behalf of Hernandez, and on November 21, 2012, a judge tentatively blocked the suspension. Hernandez was expelled from the school in January 2013. In July 2013, she was allowed to re-enter the school, which had abandoned the RFID project.

2015 football incident 
On September 4, 2015, the athletic program attracted national attention after a game in which two players, identified as Victor Rojas and Michael Moreno, drove into the back of umpire Robert Watts during the final moments of the event. Rojas was ejected from the game and both were suspended from the team the next day. The two players were later suspended from school and an assistant coach, Mack Breed, who may have provoked the incident, was also suspended. The incident made national news.  Breed admitted to ordering the hit, although he later recanted the statement. He resigned that same month. He later pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault. Part of his sentencing included permanently surrendering his teaching license.
