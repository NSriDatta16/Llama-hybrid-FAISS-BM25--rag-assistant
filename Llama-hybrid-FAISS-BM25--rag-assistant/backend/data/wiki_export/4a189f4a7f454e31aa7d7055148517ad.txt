Zapp is the debut studio album by the American funk band Zapp, released on July 30, 1980, by Warner Bros. Records. The album's style and sound bears a striking resemblance to Parliament-Funkadelic, as the band was working with and being mentored by P-Funk members William Earl "Bootsy" Collins and George Clinton during the album's production. Produced by frontman Roger Troutman along with funk musician Bootsy Collins, who also provided the guitar work for the album, Zapp was recorded between late 1979 and early 1980 at the United Sound Studios in Detroit, Michigan, of which Parliament-Funkadelic frequented.

Topping the US Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart for 2 weeks in fall 1980  and certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) that November, the album has been cited as one of the definitive albums of early 1980s electro funk, bringing the genre to mainstream attention, and has also partially influenced the creation of the G-funk sound of hip hop music, which became popular on the West Coast of the United States during the early and mid 1990s.

Background and recording
During the late 1970s, Zapp was noticed by two longstanding friends of the Troutman family, fellow Ohio natives Phelps "Catfish" Collins and William Earl "Bootsy" Collins, both of whom were members of Parliament-Funkadelic since the early 1970s. Earlier, Roger Troutman and his brothers played frequently in the Ohio area, originally forming the band "Roger and His Fabulous Vels" in 1966.

Impressed with Zapp's musical abilities upon seeing their live performance, Catfish and Bootsy invited Zapp to visit Detroit's United Sound Studios, where they went on to write and record the demo for "More Bounce to the Ounce," which would later appear on the debut album. Parliament-Funkadelic front-man George Clinton encouraged the band to present the demo tape to Warner Bros. Records, which ultimately led to the band's signing to the label in early 1979.

In popular culture
"More Bounce to the Ounce" is featured in the films Boyz n the Hood, Mi Vida Loca, Losing Isaiah, Hate, Any Given Sunday, Blue Hill Avenue and Straight Outta Compton, the 2002 Rockstar video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, and the 2018 South Park episode "A Boy and a Priest". It was also in an episode of "New Girl" (Season 4, episode 20).
