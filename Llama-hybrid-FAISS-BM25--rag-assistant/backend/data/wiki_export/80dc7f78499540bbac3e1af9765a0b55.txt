Sidney or Sydney is an English surname.
It is probably derived from an Anglo-Saxon locational name, [æt þǣre] sīdan īege, "[at the] wide island/watermeadow" (in the dative case).
There is also a folk etymological derivation from the French place name Saint Denis.

The name has also been used as a given name since the 19th century.
