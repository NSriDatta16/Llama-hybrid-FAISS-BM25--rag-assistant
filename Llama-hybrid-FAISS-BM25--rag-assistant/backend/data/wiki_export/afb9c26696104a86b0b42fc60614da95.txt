The Turf Paradise Derby is an American Thoroughbred horse race held annually between early and mid February at Turf Paradise Race Course in Phoenix, Arizona. The race is open to three-year-old horses and is competed over a distance of one and one-sixteenth miles on the dirt. It is an ungraded stakes race that is a prep for the Kentucky Derby, although it does not offer Derby qualifying points.

Inaugurated in 1986, the Turf Paradise Derby was run at a distance of one mile but the following year was modified to its present distance of one and one-sixteenth miles.
