The Staffordshire County Senior League is a football competition based in Staffordshire, England. It was formed in 2005 as a merger of the Midland League (formerly known as the Staffordshire Senior League) and the Staffordshire County League.

The former Midland League clubs formed the new Premier Division, which is a feeder to the North West Counties Football League and sits at step 7 (or level 11) of the National League System. The former Staffordshire County League sides formed Division One and Division Two, which are at levels 12 and 13 of the English football league system.

The league operates three divisions, the Premier Division, which sits at Step 7 of the English football league system, Division One, and Division Two. For three seasons, 2014–15 to 2016–17, Division Two was regionalised into separate North and South divisions, but these were merged back into a single division for season 2017–18. As of the 2022-23 season, however, the merger was reversed and Division Two split back into North and South subdivisions.

Tunstall Town received national and even international attention in the 2010–11 season, after losing all of their games, and conceding an average of close to ten goals a game; however the team's first eleven did consist of players as old as 75. On 22 February 2014, they ended a 171-game winless run with a 3-2 victory over Betley Reserves.
