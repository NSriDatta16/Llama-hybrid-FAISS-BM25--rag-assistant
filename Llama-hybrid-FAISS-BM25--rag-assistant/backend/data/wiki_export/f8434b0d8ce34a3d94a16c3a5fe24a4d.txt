Marvel Select is a line of action figures from the Marvel Universe and Marvel Cinematic Universe manufactured by Diamond Select Toys.

Diamond Select uses the "Select" label for other brands, including Universal Monsters, Star Trek and The Munsters, to indicate the 1:10 scale and comes in similar packaging.

Figures are sculpted in a strict 1:10 scale. Larger characters can stand as tall as 9-10 inches.

History
At its inception in 2002, the line was designed, sold, and marketed by Diamond Select Toys. Development and production was handled by Toy Biz until the company went defunct. Figures were originally limited to Ultimate Marvel and Marvel Knights. Focus was on sculpting over articulation and included large display bases and accessories, sometimes an additional figure, which necessitated large display packaging in the beginning. These pack-ins helped establish a collector-targeted line, although the dioramas were minimized or eliminated once the line began to tackle larger characters such as the Hulk. Packaging features distinctive decoration with comic artwork of each character.
