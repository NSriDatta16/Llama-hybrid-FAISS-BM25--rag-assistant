History

In its early days, Oregan provided web browser and media streaming software to Sony Computer Entertainment Europe for enabling PlayStation 2 to render the Sony games portal, Central Station.

In December 2009 Oregan launched Onyx, an Oregan branded solution for Connected TVs, which was deployed by UK based LCD TV manufacturer Cello Electronics for distribution by UK retailers such as Marks & Spencers and Dixons. These Onyx powered TVs are understood to be the first Connected TVs to deliver BBC iPlayer content as well as YouTube and other OTT video services into UK homes, but were quickly followed by similar products from LCD TV market behemoths Samsung, Sony and LG due to significant market demand for accessing BBC iPlayer on Connected TVs.

In more recent years, Oregan has seemingly focused on providing technology and professional services to telecoms and broadcast operators, for delivery of Pay TV solutions over DVB and IP networks. Aside from providing software for the BT Vision 2.0 STB from British Telecom in the UK, the company is active in emerging market territories including South America, SE Asia and the Middle East.

In May 2018, Oregan launched advanced set-top box SparQ middleware for Linux and Android TV.
