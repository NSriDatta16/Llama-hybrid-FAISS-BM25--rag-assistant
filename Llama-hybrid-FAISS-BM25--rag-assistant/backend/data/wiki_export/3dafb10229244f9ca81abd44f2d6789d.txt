Controversy 
In 2018, former Vice Principal Jennifer Cho of Carlmont High School was investigated by the district for inappropriate relationships with male students. During this investigation, spurred by a Change.org petition signed by thousands of Carlmont High School students, Cho was placed on administrative leave before being relocated elsewhere in the district.

On August 3, 2020, the Sequoia District Teachers Association announced a vote of no-confidence in Sequoia Union High School District Superintendent Mary Streshly's leadership, and asked for her removal from office. In the letter, teachers and administrators accused Streshly of mishandling the district's Covid-19 response. Along with this, it cited her inability to make and communicate plans and her dismissal of racial tensions in the district. The resolution received 200 staff signatures in the first 24 hours and 300 in total, accounting for roughly 60% of the union staff. In September 2020, Streshly resigned from her post and was succeeded by Crystal Leach who served as interim superintendent for the remainder of the school year while the district searched for a replacement.

On Friday, December 9, 2022, the Sequoia Union High School District called a special meeting and swore in two board members so they could participate in the private meeting that immediately followed. In that meeting they voted 4-1 to hire attorney Eugene Whitlock as their legal representative. This exasperated rumors that the new board was planning to fire Superintendent Dr. Darnise Williams. On Monday, December 12, 2022, the board heard public comment on the matter. They faced criticism from Sequoia District Teachers Association president Edith Salvatore for violating community trust. No community member expressed support for the board's actions. On Wednesday, December 14, 2022, the board announced Williams' resignation, confirming rumors. Many expressed their anger and frustration for the lack of communication about Williams' resignation. Williams received a $299,000 severance package—the same package she would have received under her contract had she been fired. Following the board's actions, the M-A Chronicle, Menlo Atherton High School's newspaper, published an editorial criticizing the board's secrecy on their website, machronicle.com, and as a guest opinion on the Almanac.
