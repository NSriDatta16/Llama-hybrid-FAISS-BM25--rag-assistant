Music video and criticism
The video clip's protagonist, played by the singer, discovers that her boyfriend is cheating on her. She leaves the hotel, kicks parked cars and leaves. Her purse is stolen out of her convertible by a thief on a motorbike, and she leaves a gas station without paying to chase after him. She is then pursued by the police and arrested, but escapes and hitchhikes a lorry the driver of which feels her leg.

Resembling a road movie, the clip was criticized for displaying negativity with regards to Greece. Greek politician Georgios Karatzaferis criticized the video clip as "defamatory to Greece" in a speech in the European Parliament. More specifically, Karatzaferis argued that the video harmed the country's reputation in the eyes of future tourists, and that was reason enough for the European Parliament to hold an inquiry into the matter. No such inquiry was planned or ever undertaken.

Cover versions
The song was covered by Conchita Wurst in the final of the Austrian talent show Starmania 2007. Wurst performed it under his real name Tom Neuwirth. Wurst would later have the good fortune of performing the song as a duet with Vissi herself during Vissi's 40th Anniversary concert in July 2014—two months after winning the —in Copenhagen.
