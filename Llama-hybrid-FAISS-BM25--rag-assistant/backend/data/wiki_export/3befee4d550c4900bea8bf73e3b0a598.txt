Background
Bishop Druitt College is an independent, co-educational Kindergarten to Year 12 Anglican school situated in North Boambee on the Mid North Coast of New South Wales.

The College commenced operations in 1994 with an enrolment of 57 primary school students. The original plan was for a school of just 600, but this has expanded through a building program to cater for an enrolment of over 1200 students.

Secondary curriculum

As well as compulsory study in English, Mathematics, Science, Personal Development and Health, the school provides opportunities for students to undertake electives in Technology and Applied Science, Geography, Creative and Performing Arts and Languages (including French, Italian and Japanese courses, which can be taken within the college campus.)

School houses

Each student belongs to a tutor group and a house. The tutor group is horizontal (the same Year level) and the house is vertical (K-12).  Students usually remain in the same tutor group and house for the duration of their secondary enrolment.  Students participate in sporting events and pastoral care in these house groups.
