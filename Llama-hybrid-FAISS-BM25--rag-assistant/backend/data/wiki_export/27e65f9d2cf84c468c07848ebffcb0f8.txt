History
It was built by the Midland Railway in 1870 on its extension to St. Pancras. The original station buildings were restored in the early 1980s.

There were originally platforms for two lines. This remained the case when the line was quadrupled. The up goods opened in 1893 and extended to Harlington in 1894; and the down goods opened in 1895. It was not until 1960 that British Railways added extra platforms to cater for extended stopping services between Bedford and London.
