The Cambridge Winter Hawks were a Canadian junior ice hockey team based in Cambridge, Ontario, Canada.  They played in the Mid-Western division of the Greater Ontario Junior Hockey League.

History
Created in 1982, the team was made to replace the last Cambridge team that was bought out by the Guelph Platers and moved out of town.  Their first season was in the OHA Junior "A" League.  The Winter Hawks have been a charter member of the Midwestern "B" since 1983, and are currently the 2006 Sutherland Cup Champions, defeating the Niagara Falls Canucks; they also repeated as 2007 Sutherland Cup champions.

The Winter Hawks have applied but were denied to move up to the Junior A Ontario Junior Hockey League for the 2013-14 season.

In 2017 the Cambridge Winter Hawks announced they were parting ways with OHA (but not Hockey Canada) and emphasized that they would no longer be of the GOJHL.  Options being explored included finding a Junior A league, creating their own Jr. A league, but are not considering joining an outlaw league (i.e. GMHL).
