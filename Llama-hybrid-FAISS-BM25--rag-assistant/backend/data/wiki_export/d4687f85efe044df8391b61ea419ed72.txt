"Funny How Time Flies (When You're Having Fun)" is a song by American singer Janet Jackson from her third studio album, Control (1986). It was released on November 25, 1987, by A&M Records as the album's seventh and final single.  The song was written and produced by Jackson and collaborators Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. While "Funny How Time Flies (When You're Having Fun)" was officially released in the United Kingdom and Australia, it was released solely for airplay in the United States in 1987. The single reached number 59 on the UK Singles Chart and number 24 on the Irish Singles Chart. In the US, it was ineligible to chart. No music video was filmed for the single.

Jazz musician Stanley Clarke covered the song for his 1988 album If This Bass Could Only Talk. The song was also sampled on The Lost Boyz's "Renee" and on Camp Lo's "Coolie High", both from 1996. In 2014, it was sampled on Tinashe's "How Many Times" from her debut album Aquarius. Two years later, it was sampled on SWV's "MCE (Man Crush Everyday)".
