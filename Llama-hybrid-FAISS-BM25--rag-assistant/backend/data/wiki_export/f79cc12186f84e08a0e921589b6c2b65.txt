Decatur station is a transit station in Decatur, Georgia, on the Blue Line of the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) rail system. This station opened on June 30, 1979. In 2005, a major renovation of the Church Street entrance to the station was begun that was completed in 2006. The redesign was intended to allow the station to fit in better with the stores and restaurants in the Decatur square. It has 2 tracks and side platforms that serve each track. It is one of the only stations on the Blue Line (besides those located in downtown Atlanta) that is completely underground.

Decatur mainly serves the City of Decatur and South Dekalb County. It provides access to Downtown Decatur-Historic Shopping and Dining District, Atlanta's Dekalb Conventional Visitor's Bureau, Decatur Main Library, Dekalb County Court House, Decatur City Hall, Devry University, Holiday Inn Plaza Decatur and the Emory-Cliff Shuttle.

Bus service is provided at this station to: South Dekalb Mall, North Dekalb Mall, Agnes Scott College, Georgia State University- Decatur, Emory Hospital-Decatur, North Dekalb Health Center, Decatur Main Post Office, Virginia-Highlands and the Atlanta VA Medical Center.

Green Line service, which currently terminates at Edgewood/Candler Park station, is expected to be extended to Avondale with stops at East Lake and Decatur when the platform at Bankhead is expanded to accommodate 8-car trains. This is being done to increase the levels of service on MARTA's eastâ€“west trunk line.
