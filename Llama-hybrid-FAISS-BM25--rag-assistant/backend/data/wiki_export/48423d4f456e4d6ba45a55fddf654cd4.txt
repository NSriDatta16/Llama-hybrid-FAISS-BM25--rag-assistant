In 1792, he married  Johanna Christiane Louise von Schulthes (1771–1856, daughter of Johann Adolf von Schultes), in Themar, Thüringen. They had several children.

He composed orchestral and chamber works, songs and singspiele. His main work was the singspiel Die Geisterinsel after Shakespeare's The Tempest, that premiered in 1798 in Weimar.

According to Goretzki/Krickenberg (see sources below), the song "Schlafe mein Prinzchen Schlaf ein", often attributed to Mozart (KV 350) or Bernhard Flies, was composed by Fleischmann.

He died in Meiningen.
