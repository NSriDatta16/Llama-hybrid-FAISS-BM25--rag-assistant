Pink is the New Blog

The website's signature is in the large block pink letters that are used to add comments to paparazzi photos. Some celebrities like John Mayer have copied the idea to give props to Vanegas and his site by using the large pink blocks in the pictures they take themselves. Vanegas also has pictures of himself with celebrities and celebrities with their pinkisthenewblog.com stickers.
