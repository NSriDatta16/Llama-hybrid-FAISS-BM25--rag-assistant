History
Kingston Technology was founded on October 17, 1987, in response to a severe shortage of 1Mbit surface-mount memory chips, Chinese immigrant John Tu designed a new single in-line memory module (SIMM) that used readily available, older-technology through-hole components.  In 1990 the company branched out into its first non-memory product line, processor upgrades. By 1992, the firm was ranked #1 by Inc. as the fastest-growing privately held company in America. The company expanded into networking and storage product lines, and introduced DataTraveler and DataPak portable products.
