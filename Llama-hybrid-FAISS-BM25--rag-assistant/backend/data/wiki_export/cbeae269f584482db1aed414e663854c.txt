Skyler Levon Green (born September 12, 1984) is a former American football wide receiver and return specialist in the National Football League (NFL) for the Dallas Cowboys, Cincinnati Bengals and New Orleans Saints. He also was a member of the Edmonton Eskimos in the Canadian Football League (CFL) and the New Orleans VooDoo of the Arena Football League (AFL). He played college football at Louisiana State University.

Early years
Green was born and raised in the New Orleans suburb of Westwego. He attended L.W. Higgins High School, where he played as a multi-threat quarterback. As a senior, he rushed for 2,174 yards on 194 carries, while receiving All-State, MVP of district and MVP of the All-New Orleans Metro team. He had 224 rushing yards and 124 passing yards in a first round 5A state playoff loss against Catholic High School.

College career
Green accepted a football scholarship from  Louisiana State University, over Alabama and Louisiana Tech. He was originally recruited as a running back, but switched to wide receiver to get more playing time.

During his career, Green was also particularly dangerous as a punt returner, returning his first punt as a Tiger for a touchdown at Arizona in 2003. He finished his LSU career with four punt returns for touchdowns, also scoring against the Florida Gators in 2003, the Vanderbilt Commodores in 2004, and the Auburn Tigers in 2005. On LSU's 2003 National Championship Team, Green led the nation in yards-per-return, at 18.5.

He played for LSU for four seasons and caught 111 passes for 1,129 yards and nine touchdowns. He finished ranked No. 1 in school history for punts returned for touchdowns (4), No. 2 in punt return yards (1,064) and just outside the top 10 in all-purpose yards (3,243). He led the nation in punt returns with an 18.5 average in 2003.

2002 season
As a true freshman, he stepped in as one of LSU's three primary receivers after Devery Henderson broke his arm in the 11th game of the season against the University of Mississippi. The next week, at Arkansas, Green took a Marcus Randall screen pass 67 yards for a touchdown and had a total of 92 receiving yards. He appeared in 7 games, making 7 receptions for 123 yards, one touchdown and 3 carries for 28 yards.

2003 season
As a sophomore, he remained one of the Tigers' three primary receivers, after Jerel Myers graduated. Green caught 48 passes for 519 yards and 5 touchdowns. He was considered one of the best college punt returners, leading the nation in punt returns with an 18.5-yard average on 25 returns, for a total of 462 punt returns yards. He had an 80-yard touchdown return against the University of Florida and a 62-yard touchdown return against the University of Arizona.

His best play of the year was against #7 Georgia (televised by CBS). With the score tied 10–10 with 1:22 left in the game, LSU faced a third and four from Georgia's 34. On what looked like a busted play, Green sprinted free for quarterback Matt Mauck, who lofted the ball toward Green just as he was getting hit by Georgia linebacker Odell Thurman. Green sprinted under the ball, dove to the ground in the end zone and caught the pass for a game-winning touchdown, sending the LSU-record crowd of 92,251 into a frenzy. A photo of catch was featured the next week in Sports Illustrated.

2004 season
As a junior, even though Michael Clayton and Devery Henderson graduated, Green still had to compete with Craig Davis, Dwayne Bowe, and Early Doucet for time as one of LSU's three primary receivers.

Green suffered a high ankle sprain in the team's second scrimmage of fall camp and then re-injured it in the season-opener against Oregon State University. He was limited the rest of the season. He had 6 receptions for 59 yards and 2 touchdowns in the loss against the University of Iowa in the 2005 Capital One Bowl. He finished with 24 catches, 219 yards, and 3 touchdowns.

He returned 11 kickoffs for 249 yards, 25 punts for 243 yards and one touchdown. He ranked fourth in the SEC with a 9.7-yard average. He returned a punt 65 yards for a touchdown against Vanderbilt University.

2005 season
As a senior, he appeared in 13 games with 4 starts. He caught 32 passes for 268 yards and 16 carries for 126 yards. He returned 27 punts for 359 yards (13.3-yard average) and 18 kickoffs for 355 yards (19.7-yard average). He set the school record for punt returns for touchdowns, with his fourth on a 66-yarder in a win over Auburn University. He was named the SEC Special Teams Player of the Year after ranking third in the conference in punt returns with a 13.3-yard average. He was named third-team All-American by the Associated Press.

Green had 9 receptions for 63 yards, 5 punt returns for 78 yards, including a 37-yarder that set up a touchdown and returned a kickoff 30 yards in a win over Mississippi State University. He was used in multiple positions in LSU's 40–3 win against the University of Miami in the 2005 Peach Bowl. He returned punts and kickoffs, as well as playing a few snaps at quarterback and his usual position of wide receiver.
