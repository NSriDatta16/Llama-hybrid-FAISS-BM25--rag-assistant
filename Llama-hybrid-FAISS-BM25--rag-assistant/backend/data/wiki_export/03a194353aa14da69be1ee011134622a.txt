History
Sanford High School was built in 1902.  In 1911 the student population necessitated the building of a new Sanford High School on Sanford Avenue.  In 1927 a much larger building opened on French Avenue, and the school was renamed Seminole High School.  By 1961 a new sprawling campus was opened at the present location on Ridgewood Avenue, and the old building on French Avenue became Sanford Junior High School (later renamed Sanford Middle School).  Seminole High School has grown not only in the size of the campus, but also in student population – in 1907, only four students attended and graduated Seminole High School. Today, the graduation rate in Seminole High School is 86%. The original building on 7th Street was for a time used as the Student Museum, open to elementary field trips to represent the rich history of education in Seminole County. In 2012 that building was reopened, in a partnership between Seminole County and the University of Central Florida as the Public History Museum; this made it open to the general public, as well as laboratory for university students to gain hands-on experience displaying history to the public.

Renovation
In 2004, the school began renovations costing over $10 million, including the construction of new classroom halls; a new media center was opened  in 2006, a new gym was opened at  the beginning of the 2007-2008 school year, and a new auditorium.  The renovation was completed in 2010. Tomahawk Hall opened at the beginning of the second quarter of the 2006-07 school year. A performing arts center, later to be named in honor of former principal Karen W. Coleman, opened in March 2008. Seminole High's Thespians were the first to use the center, producing The Pink Panther Strikes Again that month. Construction on a new building, now called Renegade, was completed in Spring 2009.

Renovations on the cafeteria began in early 2009 and were finished at the beginning of the 2009–10 school year. and the construction on a new building, now called Warrior Hall in the east side of the campus. The current amount of renovations completed, and to be built, total about $55 million.
