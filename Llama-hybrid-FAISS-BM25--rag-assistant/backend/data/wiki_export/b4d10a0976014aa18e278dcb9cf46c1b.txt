Me Mammy is a British sitcom that aired on BBC1 from 1968 to 1971. Starring Milo O'Shea, it was written by Hugh Leonard.

Background
Me Mammy first aired as pilot within the seventh series of the BBC's Comedy Playhouse. The pilot and first series were made in black-and-white. Despite playing his mother, Anna Manahan was only two years older than her on-screen son played by Milo O'Shea. Many of the episodes are missing and presumed wiped. Only the first episode of the first series and the entire third series survive, However, although recorded in colour, the last series only survives in black and white.

Cast
Milo O'Shea as Benjamin "Bunjy" Kennefick
Anna Manahan as Mrs Kennefick
Yootha Joyce as Miss Argyll
Ray McAnally as Father Patrick
David Kelly as Cousin Enda

Plot
Bunjy Kennefick is an Irish mother's boy living in London. He is a top executive of a company and aspires to live a bachelor lifestyle. However, his old-fashioned Catholic mother often puts a stop to his plans, many of them involving his secretary and girlfriend, Miss Argyll. Other characters include Father Patrick, often mocked for his dubious morality, and Cousin Enda.

The episodes feature some surreal elements, such as "Catholic Chess", which pits pieces modelled on prominent Catholic figures against one modelled on prominent Protestant figures. On the Catholic side of the board are buttons which can drop opposing pieces through trapdoors, "sending them to Hell". Another example was the board game 'Popopoly' ("Hold your own Papal elections".). Bunjy's mother would pray to bizarrely named saints.
