Red Deer Hill (formerly named Aaskana) is a community in Saskatchewan, Canada south of Prince Albert and north of St. Louis. First settlement occurred in the 1870s and 1880s by Anglo-Metis from Manitoba, and the area took its name from a large hill which in the early days was populated by many elk or "red deer". The area is part of the aspen parkland biome.

Red Deer Hill used to have a gas station at the bottom of the hill going south.  It would close down some years later and a house would be built.

The Red Deer Hill post office was previously known as Aaskana, and was founded in 1888. At the time, it was part of the District of Saskatchewan in the Northwest Territories, a precursor to the province. It changed name in 1897, and was located at the legal land description of Section 32, Township 46, Range 26, West of the 2nd Meridian.  Later the post office was located at the North West 1/4 Section .18, Township 46, Range 26, West of the 2nd Meridian.

The Red Deer Hill area is mainly a farming community.  Grain, cattle, and horses are the main items farmed in the area.
