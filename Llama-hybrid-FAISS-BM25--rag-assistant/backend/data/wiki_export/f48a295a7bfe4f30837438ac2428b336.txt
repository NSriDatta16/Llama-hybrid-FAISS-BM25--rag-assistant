The Magalloway River is a river in northwestern Maine and northern New Hampshire in the United States. It is a tributary of the Androscoggin River, which flows to the Kennebec River at Merrymeeting Bay in Maine, near the Atlantic Ocean. The total length of the river is , or  if the distances across intervening lakes are included.

The Magalloway River rises near the extreme northwestern corner of Maine, at the juncture of the West Branch and the Third East Branch of the Magalloway. The river flows south through logging country to  Parmachenee Lake, then descends for another  to the  Aziscohos Lake. Below the lake dam, the Magalloway turns west and descends  in  to the village of Wilsons Mills, Maine, before once again turning south, now along the New Hampshire–Maine border. The river ends where it joins the outlet of Umbagog Lake, forming the Androscoggin River.

Tributaries of the Magalloway include the West Branch, the First, Second, and Third East Branches, the Little Magalloway River, and the Dead Diamond River.  The Magalloway passes through the townships of Parmachenee, Lynchtown, Parkertown, Lincoln, and Magalloway Plantation in Maine, and the townships of Second College Grant and Wentworth Location in New Hampshire.

Its name is from some Native American language, meaning "large tail".

Aziscohos Lake

Aziscohos Lake extends upstream from Aziscohos Dam in Lincoln Plantation through Parkertown township into Lynchtown township. The reservoir is good habitat for brook trout and land-locked Atlantic salmon. There is a public boat launch site at the south end of the reservoir off Maine State Route 16.
