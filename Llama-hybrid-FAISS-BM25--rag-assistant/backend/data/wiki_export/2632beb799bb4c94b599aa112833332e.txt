The CESifo's website notes that "Roger Gordon's work has contributed to the understanding of a wide range of economic issues, with a focus on public finance and development economics. His contributions examine, for example, the role of tax policy in the development process, both in general contexts and in the special case of China. His research also focuses on tax policy issues in open economies. In general, many of his papers deal with the effects of taxation on corporate and individual behavior and their implications for tax policy."
