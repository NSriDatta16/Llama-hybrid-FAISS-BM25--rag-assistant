Rocky Dennis in Heaven is an extended play by Swedish indie pop musician Jens Lekman. It was released on 21 January 2004 on Service. The EP was later released as simply Rocky Dennis on 6 April 2004 on Secretly Canadian. The EP's songs were written about the life and artistic biographies of Roy L. Dennis, who suffered from the extremely rare medical condition known as craniodiaphyseal dysplasia.

The Swedish release showed a sky blue cover with the words, "Someday I'll be stuffed in a museum, scaring little kids / With the inscription Carpe diem, something I never did". The songs on the EP can also be found on Lekman's 2005 release, Oh You're So Silent Jens.
