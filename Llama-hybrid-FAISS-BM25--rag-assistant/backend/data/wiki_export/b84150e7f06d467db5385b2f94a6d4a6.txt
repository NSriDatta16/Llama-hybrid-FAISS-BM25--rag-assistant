The zygomaticofacial foramen is a small opening upon the lateral (facial) surface of the zygomatic bone near the bone's orbital border. It gives passage to the zygomaticofacial nerve, artery, and vein. It is often doubled; it is sometimes absent.

Inferior to the foramen is a slight elevation which gives origin to the zygomaticus muscle.
