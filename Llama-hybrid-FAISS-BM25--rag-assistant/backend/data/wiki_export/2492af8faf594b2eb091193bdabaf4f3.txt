The rest of his career, which lasted from 1927 to 1931, and then from 1934 to 1036, was mainly spent in the amateur Ottawa City Hockey League.

He was born in Sudbury, Ontario, he first played for the Ottawa Shamrocks of the OCHL in 1927. He played for the Quakers in the 1930–31 season, scoring no goals in the NHL but ranking third in the league in penalty minutes with 103.
