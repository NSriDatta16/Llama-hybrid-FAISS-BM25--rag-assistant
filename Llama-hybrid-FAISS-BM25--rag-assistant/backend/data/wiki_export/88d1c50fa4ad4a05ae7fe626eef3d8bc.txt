History
Pilar de Goiás is a Brazilian municipality in the state of Goiás. Situated in the region of the São Patrício Valley, its population according to IBGE Census in 2010 was 2,733 inhabitants. At the bottom of a valley, Pilar de Goiás was born in 1736 through the initiative of a redoubt of fugitive slaves who found in this place a shelter, and also a great source of gold. In order to recover these slaves, the bandeirante Joao de Godoy Pinto Silveira was entrusted with this task. Without knowing what he was going to find, the brave left in the middle of cerrado (local vegetation) searching for these slaves and when he found them, they have already dug the gold and offered this gold in exchange for freedom.
At that moment, the large-scale settlement of the area that until then was called by the quilombolas of Quilombo de Papuã, name which means: marmalade grass (a very abundant plant at that time). With the beginning of the gold exploration many people came from several parts in the search for the gold ore, but in the region where it was more abundant lacked water and to dig it was more difficult. Then one of the garimpeiros made a promise to a saint: Saint Lady of Pilar, if sprout water in that region so that he could work, as a form of gratitude he would give a golden bell to the church that would be built in that village. The promise was answered and in that region sprout water. The garimpeiro paid his pledge and donated a golden bell to the church that because of the miracle was done in devotion to the saint who had attended to it. From there, the village of Papuã became known as Pilar de Goiás, to remind everyone that the saint helps those who turn to her. Pilar has as main tourist attractions the Feast of Saint Lady of Pilar and the Cavalhadas. In the city, there is one biggest bell, 900 kilos and in whose league has spent an arroba of gold.
