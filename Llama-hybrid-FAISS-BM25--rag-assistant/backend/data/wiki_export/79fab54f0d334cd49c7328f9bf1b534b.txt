Tourist attractions
Tourists discovered Kerpe when it was a small fishing port. It boasts a calm sea and sandy beaches, and is close to urban centers such as Istanbul, İzmit, and Adapazarı.

Kefken is 20 km away from Kandıra, and 8 km away from Kerpe. Kefken is the most advanced town among the coastal settlements of the district. Sea, beach and pine forests are the most important features. Kefken harbor is a typical fishing town. In the summertime the town gets 3 times crowded. 2 hours more or less, or 150 km away from Istanbul on the Black Sea coast, is this fairly secluded, quiet, and relatively unspoilt part of the region. The sea is suitable for swimming and there are unspoilt bays for picnics.
Kefken Island is one of the few islands on the Turkish Black Sea coast. The island is at a close distance to the shores of Cebeci village. Genoese era fortress walls and water wells are worth to mention as the historical heritage of the island.
