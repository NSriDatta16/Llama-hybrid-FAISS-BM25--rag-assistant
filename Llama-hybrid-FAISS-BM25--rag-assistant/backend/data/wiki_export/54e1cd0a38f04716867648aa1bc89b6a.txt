Fridolin Heer (July 30, 1834 â€“ September 19, 1910) was a Swiss-born and trained architect who immigrated to the United States in 1864 and set up a practice in Dubuque, Iowa shortly thereafter. He was joined in his practice by his son, Fridolin Heer Jr.

Fridolin Heer Jr. studied architecture in Germany and worked in Chicago in the offices of Adler and Sullivan before returning to Dubuque to work with his father.

Heer died at his home in Dubuque in 1910.
