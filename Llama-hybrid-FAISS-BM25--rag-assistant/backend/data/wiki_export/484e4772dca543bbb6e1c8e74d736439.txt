The Swift River is an  river located in eastern New Hampshire in the United States. It is a tributary of the Bearcamp River, part of the Ossipee Lake / Saco River watershed leading to the Atlantic Ocean. The Swift River is located only four miles south of the larger and longer Swift River which parallels the Kancamagus Highway in the White Mountain National Forest.

The Swift River begins at the confluence of Paugus Brook and the Wonalancet River in the northern part of Tamworth, New Hampshire, south of Mount Chocorua. The river flows southeast through a narrow valley, which opens up as it reaches Tamworth village. The Swift River slows before joining the Bearcamp River between the villages of Whittier and West Ossipee. Mill Brook joins near the Swift River's mouth.
