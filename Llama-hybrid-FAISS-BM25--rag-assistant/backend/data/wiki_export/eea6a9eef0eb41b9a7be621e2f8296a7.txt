The Southern Football League (SFL) is an Australian rules football league in South Australia. The League was formed, as the Southern Football Association, in 1886. The league is a not-for-profit organisation.

The league is a suburban competition which also acts as a feeder competition for the South Australian National Football League (SANFL) and in turn the Australian Football League (AFL). Some AFL players from the SFL are Adam Cooney, Nathan Eagleton, Ben Rutten, Dean Brogan and Andrew Mackie. SANFL clubs that have recruitment zones linked to the Southern Football League are West Adelaide Football Club, Glenelg Football Club and South Adelaide Football Club.

League history 
The Southern Football League was previously known as the Southern Football Association until 1963.  Originally a country league, with urban expansion it has more recently become a suburban league in Adelaide's far southern suburbs.

The League was formed (as Southern Football Association) in 1886 with competing clubs being Aldinga, McLaren Vale, Sellicks Hill and Willunga. In the early 1900s the participating clubs were Aldinga, Hillside (called McLaren Flat from 1946), McLaren Vale, Morphett Vale, Noarlunga and Willunga.

In 1919 the participating clubs were Aldinga, Hillside, McLaren Vale, Morphett Vale, Noarlunga, Reynella and Willunga.

In 1964 the Association changed its name to Southern Football League and participating clubs were Aldinga, McLaren Flat, McLaren Vale, Morphett Vale, Mount Bold, Myponga, Noarlunga, Port Noarlunga, Reynella, Willunga, Yankalilla and Christies Beach Juniors.

The League came to national attention on 11 July 2009, when an SFL match between Port Noarlunga and Reynella was abandoned as a result of a freak tornado.

The League once again came to attention in 2012 when it cancelled its Junior Carnivals due to umpire abuse and poor spectator behavior.   This led to a campaign based around respect and protection of umpires.

2015 was Edwardstown last season in the league, they transferred to the Channel 9 Adelaide Football League.
2016 was Morphettville Park and Brighton D&OS last season in the league, they transferred to the Channel 9 Adelaide Football League.
2017 Hackham were in recess. Port Noarlunga got ejected from the finals after playing an ineligible player in the semi-final.
