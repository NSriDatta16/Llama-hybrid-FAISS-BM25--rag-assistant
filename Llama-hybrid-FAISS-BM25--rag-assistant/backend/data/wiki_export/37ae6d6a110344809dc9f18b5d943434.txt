Caprock High School is located in Amarillo, Texas in Potter, County, which is part of the Texas Panhandle. Caprock is one of four high schools in the Amarillo Independent School District and classified as a 5A school by the UIL.  Caprock was built in 1964 and celebrated its 50th graduating class in 2014.   In 2015, the school was rated "Met Standard" by the Texas Education Agency.

Athletics
The Caprock Longhorns compete in cross country, volleyball, football, wrestling, basketball, swimming, soccer, golf, tennis, track, softball, baseball, choir, and band.

Football
In 2010, Caprock ended a 35-year playoff drought, dating back to 1975 with an 8-2 overall record, going 5–2 in district, recording their first shutout in a decade over rival Palo Duro High School, and winning a district title (Shared with Hereford High School and Randall High School). This resulted in a first round matchup with Rider High School, which resulted in a 35-14 loss. This season marked a quick turnaround from a soccer program that had a 29-game losing streak spanning nearly three entire seasons earlier in the decade. The success came after Caprock hired Seth Parr (son of then Palo Duro coach Steve Parr) in 2007, who implemented an air raid offence in the footsteps of Mike Leach. This markedly improved the offensive production of the Longhorns' offense from 2007 to 2013. In 2014, Coach Parr left Caprock for Coronado High School, and Caprock promoted Defensive Coordinator Dan Sherwood to Head Coach. In seven seasons at Caprock, Parr went 35-37 with no playoff wins.

After a string of playoff appearances in 2011 (L 43-21 to Ryan High School), 2015 (L 45-43 to Cooper High School), 2016 (L 41-40 to Coronado High School and former coach Seth Parr), Caprock ended a 43-year playoff win drought in a 42-17 win over Eastlake High School (The 1975 playoff win over Lubbock High School was vacated soon after the game was played). The following week, the Longhorns would fall to a high octane Grapevine High School 47-28. This capped off a historic season for Caprock, winning 8 games en route to the second district title (shared with Coronado High School) in 8 years. At the conclusion of the 2018 season, Coach Sherwood has a record of 23-31 with one playoff victory.

Caprock has a greatly improved TAKS record. It has a met the required passing rate. The best portion of the TAKS test that Caprock does well on is the English-Language Arts (ELA). Out of the four Amarillo high schools, Caprock scores the lowest, causing the state of Texas to intervene. Now for a week in January, 9th, 10th, and 11th graders  as well as 12th graders who didn't pass the exit out exam in the 11th grade have to take a diagnostic TAKS and act like it is the real test in order to be prepared for the tests in February or March for the ELA portion and April or May for the Math, Social Studies, and Science portions. Caprock has also inserted an additional class period during the day called IMPACT.  IMPACT is directed at improving TAKS scores for all who are involved in upcoming testing.  Those student who are preparing for graduation and college use the time for ST/ACT preparation, scholarship applications, enrollment applications, and other future-planning activities.
