Ahmad Ibrahim Kulliyyah of Laws (AIKOL) is the law faculty of International Islamic University Malaysia. Previously known as the Kulliyyah of Laws, it was renamed in 2000 in honour of its founding father and ex-Dean, professor Ahmad Mohamed Ibrahim. Being the first Kulliyyah (faculty) to be formed together with the university, it is now one of the largest law schools in Malaysia and has produced thousands of law graduates since 1983: legal practitioners, shariah lawyers, academicians, legal advisors, deputy public prosecutors, judiciary members, ministers and politicians. The current Dean is Professor Dr. Farid Sufian bin Shuaib.

Due to its international status, the medium for teaching in AIKOL is English and Arabic. However, Bahasa Melayu is also taught to students to equip them with the understanding of legal jargons in the national language. It does receive a small group of foreign law students every year whilst the majority of the students are Malaysians.

Courses offered

AIKOL offers a variety of courses ranging from LL.B (Honours), LL.B-S (Honours) for Shariah law students, MCL (Master of Comparative Laws) and up to PhD (Doctor of Philosophy) level. It also provides for programmes like Diploma in Shariah Law And Practice (DSLP) and Diploma in Law and Administration of Islamic Judiciary (DAIJ). Under the Legal Profession Act 1976, a person who has been awarded an LL.B (Honours) degree from AIKOL of IIUM is recognised as a 'qualified person' that may be admitted as an Advocate & Solicitor in the High Court, Malaysia, and is exempted from taking the Certificate of Legal Practice (Malaysia).

Harun M. Hashim Law Centre of AIKOL offers several programmes, including LL.M Business Law, LL.M Islamic Banking & Finance Law, LL.M in Administration of Islamic Law and LL.M in International Law. In addition, it also offers certificate programmes in Company Secretarial Practice, Competition Policy Law, and Islamic Banking & Finance Law.

Events

The Ahmad Ibrahim Memorial Lecture series is conducted annually by inviting experts and scholars to speak on diverse legal issues. The eminent speakers previously invited to speak in the event include Tun Salleh Abas, Tun Zaki Azmi, Tun Abdul Hamid Mohamad, Richard Malanjum, Gordon Woodman, Andrew Harding, Mohamad Ariff Yusof, and Rais Yatim.

IIUM Mock Trial is an annual theatrical play conducted by the Law Society of AIKOL, traditionally held during the Convocation Week commonly known as Convest, at the AIKOL Moot Court or the IIUM Main Auditorium. Students reenact famous legal trials, with added dramatic elements like humour, suspense, horror and patriotism, as well as extensive stage props, costumes and gimmicks. Among the real cases that have been chosen for the IIUM Mock Trial in the past include Mona Fandey, Maria Hertogh, Botak Chin and Al-Ma'unah.

Publications
The IIUM Law Journal is a peer-reviewed journal, published twice a year by AIKOL, with a dedicated mission of ideas and information about legal developments relating to civil and Shariah laws.

The Law Majalla is the first student-run law journal in Malaysia. It was published in 1985 as a way for the students of the AIKOL to contribute to the ever-growing body of legal scholarship. The Law Society of AIKOL is also in charge of the student-run newsletter called The Lexicon.

AIKOL professors and lecturers have published numerous books via IIUM Press, the university's press, on various legal areas including Islamic banking and finance law, family law, international law, environmental law, dispute resolution and contract law.

Achievements
AIKOL actively participates in various public speaking, debating, client counseling and mooting competitions, both nationally and internationally. 

Irma Nur Zahrah of AIKOL became the first Asian to win the public speaking competition at the World Universities Debating Championships 2004 held at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.
One of AIKOL's major achievements was when it became the runner-up in the prestigious Philip C. Jessup International Law Moot Court Competition 2005 held at Washington, D.C. and Melati Abdul Hamid was awarded the Best Oralist in the Championship Round. Another major achievement was in 2008, where the IIUM mooting team represented Malaysia and managed to garner a clean sweep of the awards in the Inaugural Monroe E. Price Media Law Moot Court Competition held at University of Oxford. The IIUM team was crowned the inaugural champion, merited the Best Memorial Award and Best Oralist of the said competition.
