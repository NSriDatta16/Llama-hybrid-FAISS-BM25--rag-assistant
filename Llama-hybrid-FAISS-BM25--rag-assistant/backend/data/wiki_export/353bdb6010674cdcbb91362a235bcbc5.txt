History 

Newmarket was originally known as "The Three Mile Scrub" due to its distance from the city, and Ashgrove Avenue, which links Enoggera Road with Waterworks Road to the west, was known as Three Mile Scrub Road. As Brisbane continued to grow northward along Kelvin Grove Road, in about 1880 it was decided to relocated Brisbane's livestock saleyards from Normanby to an outer location, the area now bordered by Enoggera Road, Newmarket Road, Wilston Road and Alderson Street. This area became known as the "new market" given the suburb its name. The new sale yards were serviced by Newmarket railway station after the rail line was extended from Mayne Junction in 1899.

In 1900, local residents were agitating to have the Kelvin Grove tramway extended along Enoggera Road to the Newmarket Hotel. However, a new bridge over Enoggera Creek would be required. Also there were concerns that the close proximity of the proposed tramway would take revenue away from the railway line. However these concerns were resolved and the tramway extension to the Newmarket Hotel was opened on Monday 27 July 1903.

On 20 April 1901, Bishop William Webber laid the foundation stone of St James' Anglican Church. The church was designed by architects John H. Buckeridge and Hall & Dods and built by G. Marshall and could seat 120 people. It was dedicated on Sunday 20 July 1901 by Bishop Webber. It is located at 58 Enoggera Road ().

Newmarket State School opened on 4 July 1904.

The Newmarket Brickworks were constructed in Mina Parade in 1912 with a chimney over  tall. The brickwords were demolished in 1987 but the Newmarket Brickworks chimney remains and is now heritage-listed. However, due to changes in the suburb boundaries, the chimney is now officially in the neighbouring suburb of Alderley.

The Ruby Estate, Kelvin Grove (now known as Newmarket), being re-subdivision of subdivision 43 of suburban portion, 25 parish of Enoggera were auctioned on site by G.T Bell Auctioneer on 22 August 1914, at 3pm. The terms of the sale required a £2 deposit and £1 per month per lot with the interest rate at 5%. The 22 building sites situated between Foster street and Ruby street, Kelvin Grove (Newmarket) Brisbane, were advertised as consisting of 16 perches and two minutes from the Kelvin Grove tram terminus. The original advertisement showed that between blocks 2 and 3 held a house on site, for removal. The following Monday 24 August 1914, it was published in The Telegraph newspaper, that 16 allotments of the Ruby Estate, Kelvin Grove (Newmarket) were sold during the auction.

In about March 1918, a block of land was purchased for £100 to build a Baptist church in Newmarket/Grange. The church opened on Saturday 21 June 1919. The church was at 197 Wilston Road (corner of Carberry Street) in the suburb of Grange and is known as Grange Baptist Church.

The sale of the McCook Estate, at the time part of the suburb Kelvin Grove, now Newmarket, by Auctioneers, Martin Snelling & Co, occurred on 3 March 1928 at 3 pm on the grounds. It was offered again for sale by auction on 14 April 1928. The Estate comprised 19 splendid business and residential sites, located on the corner of Kelvin Grove Road and Parker street and backing onto Foster street. The advertisement stressed the convenience of location on the tram-line, within 15 minutes ride to the GPO and close to the shopping centre, picture theatre, churches and state schools.

As urban development continued in Newmarket, the saleyards were moved to Cannon Hill in 1931. Evidence of the saleyards can still be seen in a number of narrow laneways including one known as Saleyards Lane, most likely old cattle tracks between stockyards, that still exist in this neighbourhood.

St Ambrose's Catholic School opened in 1936.

Newmarket State High School opened on 29 January 1963 and closed on 13 December 1996. it was located immediately west of Newmarket State School, extending from Brent Street south towards Banks Street (). The school's site has been redeveloped for housing with the creation of Nelson Place, Laurence Street, and Daniel Place.

Until December 1968 trams operated by the Brisbane City Council plied along Enoggera Road.  A former tramway electrical substation still stands on the corner of Kate Street and Enoggera Road and has been transformed into a contemporary dwelling.
