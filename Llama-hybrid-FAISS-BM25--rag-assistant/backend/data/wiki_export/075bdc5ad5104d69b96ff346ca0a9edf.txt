Echesortu is a barrio (neighborhood) in Rosario, Argentina. It is unofficially known by that name even though, from the administrative point of view, its name is Remedios Escalada de San Martín. The neighborhood was formerly a town on its own, named after Ciro Echesortu, the original owner of the land; it was absorbed into the city later.
