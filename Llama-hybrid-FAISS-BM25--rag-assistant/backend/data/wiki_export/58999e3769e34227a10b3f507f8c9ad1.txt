Office is a Chicago-based pop band that was active in the 2000s.

History
The band was founded by Scott Masson while attending College of Goldsmiths, in London, UK. Upon returning to America after his student exchange program ended, Masson continued to use Office as a vehicle for his songwriting and art at Kalamazoo College in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Masson maintained the band with various friends and performers as collaborators, preferring to call it a "project" or "hallucination." The latest iteration of the project appeared onstage at SXSW, on MTV, at Lollapalooza, and elsewhere dressed as if going to work in "business attire and black mini dresses."

Office developed a cult following in the 2000s, particularly in and around Kalamazoo, Michigan and later in Chicago, Illinois, promoting a sound that has been described by Spin as "handclaps and sunny harmonies." Masson recorded and self-released the debut Office album under his own publishing company, Public Treatments, and began promoting it in Kalamazoo in 2001. At its peak, he said people were coming to his house at 2 a.m. asking for a copy. In 2004, Masson recruited guitarist Tom Smith, bassist Alissa Noonan-Hacker, and drummer Erica Corniel to the band.

In 2006, the band was performing shows at South by Southwest music festival, CMJ, Mobfest, Midwest Music Conference, a set at Lollapalooza. In October that year, the group signed with Scratchie Records, an independent label owned by James Iha, former guitarist of the Smashing Pumpkins.

The band's first album under the Scratchie label, A Night at the Ritz, was released on September 25, 2007. The album contains both previously unreleased and older material from the group's early records. It also includes the singles from Q&A, which were remastered, remixed, reproduced for commercial release by the label. By the time A Night At The Ritz was released, many of the audience and critical reactions were lukewarm or mixed. Office produced a music video for the song "Oh My," which was featured on MTV in 2007. When bassist Alissa Noonan Hacker left the group In 2007, she was replaced by Chicago-based indie artist and longtime friend of Masson's from Kalamazoo College, Justin Petertil. He would later be succeeded by Colin DeKuiper from the popular instrumental band, Russian Circles, until the band's hiatus in late 2008.

Following the completion of the album Mecca in late 2008, Masson moved to the Detroit area to be near his family, and was treated for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder from his experiences in the music industry. This marked the beginning of an indefinite hiatus for Office. Masson eventually made a full recovery, and began recording and performing experimental music around the mid-west under his own name, and occasionally with a group called Glossies. He resides in Ferndale, MI, where he works full-time as a producer, engineer, and creative consultant for artists, musicians, and ad agencies around the Detroit area. He also paints.

Office signed with Ann Arbor-based media conglomerate Quack!Media in January 2009, releasing "Mecca" on limited-edition vinyl and digital download. The band made the album available for free via the internet.

The song "Ridiculous Plans" was included in the teen indie film "The Virginity Hit". Office's song 'Dominoes' was included on the indie compilation in August 2009. The song "Enter Me, Exit You" was licensed by Abercrombie & Fitch, and Hollister Co. stores across the US and UK. In 2017 Scott Masson removed Office songs from all streaming services. They were replaced with remixed/remastered versions in 2020.
