Harbinger is the debut album by American singer Paula Cole. It was released through Imago Records, but, just months after its release, the company folded, so promotion for Harbinger was almost non-existent. A video was shot for the first single, "I Am So Ordinary", and is available on iTunes. There are two different covers for the album, which was re-released by Warner Brothers, who picked up Cole's contract in 1995 after absorbing Imago when it folded.
