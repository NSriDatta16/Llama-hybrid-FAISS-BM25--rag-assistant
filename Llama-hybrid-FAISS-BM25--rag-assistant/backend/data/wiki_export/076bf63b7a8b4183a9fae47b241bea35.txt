International career
A central defender, Guagua had a promising start to his career. His quick, technical abilities meant he was included in Ecuador’s squad for the 2001 FIFA World Youth Championship. In the same year, he made his debut for Ecuador’s senior side and he was named in his country’s squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. He also played in the 2007 Copa América held in Venezuela.

However, Guagua, who captained Club Deportivo El Nacional to the 2005 league championship, is generally used as a substitute behind record appearance maker Ivan Hurtado in Ecuador’s current side. He has 16 international caps and one goal as at May 19, 2006  against Mexico.
