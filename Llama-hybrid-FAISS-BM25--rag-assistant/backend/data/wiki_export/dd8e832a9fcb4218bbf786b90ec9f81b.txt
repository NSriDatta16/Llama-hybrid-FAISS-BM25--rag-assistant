Central High School is a public high school (grades 9-12) in Memphis, Tennessee, United States.  Founded in the early 1900s, it is popularly considered the first high school in Memphis. This, however, is not accurate; in fact, 3 High Schools in Memphis were established before Central:  Booker T Washington in 1873 (with the same colors and mascot), Manassas HS in 1899, and Melrose in 1894. 

Central is often called "THE" High School. It is a part of the Shelby County Optional School system where it is recognized as a school specializing in college preparatory programs. The principal is Gregory McCullough. Central's mascot is the Warrior and the school colors are green and gold. For recognition as the successor to Memphis High School, the first high school for whites in Memphis, Central High's football team, rather than having artwork denoting the "Warrior" mascot, simply has a capital "H", for THE High School
