atm⁵ is an interbank network in Singapore, connecting the ATMs of six of Singapore's eight qualifying full banks, QFB.  , there are 230+ atm⁵ ATMs island-wide. The network was established in April 2005.

atm⁵ is also one of the few interbank networks that does not charge its customers for transactions via another member bank's ATM, having removed all interbank transaction charges on April 4, 2006.

One of the six atm5 members, Citibank has numerous ATMs, but only a small percentage of them can be used for atm⁵ transactions. Hence, banks usually recommend customers to make sure that the atm⁵ logo is present on the members' ATM before they carry out their transaction(s).
