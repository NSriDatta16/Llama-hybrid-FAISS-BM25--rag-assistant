The 10th Parachute Brigade (, Jawi: ١٠ بريڬيد ڤارا), commonly known as 10 Para, is an elite brigade-sized airborne unit within the Malaysian Army tasked with being rapidly deployed inside or outside the boundaries of Malaysia. 10 Para is the key element of the Rapid Deployment Force ().

10 Para is the only elite unit in the Malaysian Armed Forces to open its membership to women. The other elite unit to open its membership to women is the Unit Tindakhas (UTK; 'Special Actions Unit') of the Royal Malaysia Police.

History

10 Para's primary role is to be the nation's main offensive force in time of war or emergencies. The creation of the Parachute Brigade was proposed by Malaysia's defence planners in the late 1970s as a part of the modernisation plan for the military. The plan originally did not receive much support from the government due to concerns that the formation of such a brigade would be looked with suspicion by its neighbour, Singapore.

In November 1988, Malaysia was unable to respond to a request for assistance by Maldives when that country was invaded by Tamil mercenaries. This inability to render timely help to prompt Malaysian leaders to move to form paratrooper units within the Malaysian Army.

Timeline
 1988 – A single Malaysian Army infantry battalion from the 8th Royal Ranger Regiment is parachute trained and converted from their traditional infantry role into a parachute battalion. This battalion becomes the first members of the new rapid deployment force.
 1990 – The 17th Royal Malay Regiment and 9th Royal Malay Regiment are jump qualified and join the rapid deployment force.
 10 October 1994 – Malaysian Prime Minister Datuk Seri Mahathir Mohamad formally redesignates the 10 Malaysian Infantry Brigade as the 10 Parachute Brigade and in the same time given its Rapid Deployment Force status.
 October 1994 – 10 Para undertakes a rapid deployment exercise, supported by elements of the Malaysian 21 Gerup Gerak Khas ('21st Special Service Group') and PASKAL and with operational support provided by the Royal Malaysian Navy and Royal Malaysian Air Force. The Halilintar Exercise 1994 centres on a scenario of the retaking of Langkawi International Airport from an invading force by the Rapid Deployment Force spearheaded by 8th Rangers (Para).
21 February 2018 – The 18th Royal Malay Regiment was upgraded into an airborne battalion. Based at Seberang Takir Camp, Kuala Nerus, Terengganu, the 18 RAMD (Para) is entrusted to cover the east peninsular region.

Roles
10 Parachute Brigade is highly skilled in accordance with its status as a Rapid Deployment Force. The paratroopers are vigorously trained for specialised combat operations and rapid deployment in alignment with the brigade's motto  (English: Act Fast). The 10 Para can be deployed from land, air and sea.

Identities

Maroon beret
The maroon beret worn by the 10 Parachute Brigade is known as 'Pegasus'. The conditions for wearing the maroon beret are to pass the basic parachute course and to APAC course. This is an imitation of the British Parachute Regiment, as is the way the beret is worn and the cap badge. Much of their training is based on the British paras due to their reputation of being the best airborne force in the world.

Cap badge
Parachute wings with Kris on a black triangle backing pointing downwards.

Parachutist badge
For 10 Para members, the parachute wings are titled Sayap Berdarah meaning 'The Bleeding Wings'. During graduation ceremony, VIPs (usually the Chief of Army or the Commander of 10 Para) or instructors will punch the metal parachute wing into graduates' chest. The sharp pins from the wing will make graduates bleed with their wings.

PAC shoulder tab
This tab is only worn by the members of 10 Para on their left shoulder both at service dress uniform and battledress. The tab is in maroon colour and embroidered with black letters 'PAC' which an acronym for Pasukan Aturgerak Cepat.

Airborne shoulder tab
This tab is worn by any soldiers who passed the Basic Parachute Course held by the PULPAK. The tab is similar to the US Army 101st Airborne Division tab; yellow/gold 'AIRBORNE' letters embroidered on black background, and worn on the right shoulder of the service dress uniform. The black and olive version is worn at the combat uniform.

Slogan
Tiada Misi Terlalu Sukar, Tiada Pengorbanan Terlalu Besar, Tugas Diutamakan ('No Mission Is Too Difficult, No Sacrifice Is Too Great, Duty Becomes Priority')
