The Honda Wave – also marketed as the Honda NF series (codename),  Honda Innova in Europe, and Honda Supra in Indonesia – are a series of motorcycles manufactured by Honda that debuted in 1995 with an underbone design, having separate cosmetic plastic body panels over a structural steel tube chassis. The Wave series succeeds the Super Cub which used pressed steel frame acting as both the structural chassis and cosmetic bodywork. It serves as the Southeast Asian model of the historic Honda Cub.

The Wave is available with three displacements - 100 cc, 110 cc and 125 cc. The 100 and 110 cc models' engine is physically similar in size to the Cub engine, sharing mountings, while the 125 cc models use a larger engine, incompatible with the Cub and 100/110 mountings. In addition to the three models that use carburetors, Honda also produces the fuel-injected model starting in 2008 for 110 cc and 125 cc models. The 100 cc model was discontinued in 2008, except in Laos where it's still produced and sold in 2020.

In 2006, the Wave received a facelift. In addition, the 125 cc model includes a key slot cover for better protection against theft. Starting from 2007, the Innova 125 in Europe began using fuel injection system to replace the carburetors used by most of the Wave series.

In Indonesia and Vietnam, the Honda Supra X150 / Honda Winner X shared the same engine with CBR150i. It come with 6speed manual transmission multi plate wet clutch with clutch leaver unlike semi-automatic like the normal one 100/110/125 the 150cc was a very special.

In Indonesia, the 110 cc model is marketed as the Honda Revo, and unlike the original Wave 110, it was not offered in the market until 2008, when it replaced the previous 100 cc model, known as Supra Fit. A sporty variant called Honda Blade is launched alongside 110cc variant of Honda Revo, however, Honda Blade was discontinued in 2019 due to low demand.
