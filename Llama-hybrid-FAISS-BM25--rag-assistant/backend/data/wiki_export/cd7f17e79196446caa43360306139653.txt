Course and features

Rising in Lamington National Park below the Lamington plateau in the locality of Binna Burra and a few kilometres north of the New South Wales/Queensland border, the Coomera River descends over the spectacular Coomera Falls in the Coomera Gorge. The river flows generally north through large rural properties in the upper reaches, joined by ten minor tributaries before flowing through high density residential and riverside development, particularly in the lower estuary where it flows into the Broadwater near Coomera Island and . Prior to reaching the Broadwater the river diverts into two streams to form the North Branch of the river that flows to the west and north of Coomera Island and heads towards Jumpinpin Channel to join the Pimpama River.

History
In May 1827 Patrick Logan was the first non-Indigenous person to discover the river. The waterway was originally named the Arrowsmith after a London cartographic firm by Robert Dixon, a government surveyor.  However Thomas Mitchell, the Colonial Surveyor General, overruled this and other names, replacing them with Aboriginal names. It was also known as the Kumera Kumera.

The name Coomera comes from a Bundjalung language (Ngaraangbal dialect) word kumera referring to a wattle tree, whose bark was used to stupify fish.
