Biography
Edward Kmiec was born in Trenton, New Jersey, on June 4, 1936.  At age 25, Kmiec was ordained a priest for the Diocese of Trenton by Archbishop Martin O’Connor in Rome on December 20, 1961.

Auxiliary Bishop of Trenton 

Pope John Paul II appointed Kmiec on August 26, 1982, as an auxiliary bishop of the Diocese of Trenton and Titular Bishop of Simidicca.  He was consecrated on November 3, 1982 by Bishop John C. Reiss.

Bishop of Nashville

John Paul II appointed Kmiec as bishop of the Diocese of Nashville on October 13, 1992; he was installed on December 3, 1992. He was heavily criticized for his diocese’s handling of sexual abuse allegations, particularly those against Edward McKeown, who was convicted of raping a 12-year-old boy.

Bishop of Buffalo, New York
On August 12, 2004, Kmiec was appointed by John Paul II as bishop of the Diocese of Buffalo.  He was installed on October 28, 2004. In 2007, Kmiec announced that the diocese had a balanced budget, after spending cuts reduced a $2.1 million deficit from the previous year.

In August 2009, the Buffalo News reported the removal of Monsignor Fred R. Voorhes, as Administrator of St. Teresa's Parish in South Buffalo and the subsequent dismissal of Marc J. Pasquale, as business administrator and director of religious education at St. Teresa's. Parishioners expressed in interviews their discontent with these removals. Pasquale had gone to the Erie County District Attorney's Office prior to his dismissal to raise concerns about questionable financial practices. 

Kmiec was heavily criticized for downsizing the diocese from 274 parishes and missions in 2005 to 170 in 2011. He also oversaw the closures of 25 elementary schools. The Diocese under Kmiec ordained only 18 priests from 2004-11.

On May 29, 2012, Pope Benedict XVI accepted Kmiec's resignation as bishop of the Diocese of Buffalo. Bishop Richard Malone from the Diocese of Portland in Maine replaced him.

Edward Kmiec died in Buffalo on July 11, 2020, at age 84.
