New York's 23rd congressional district is located in Upstate New York, and covers part of Buffalo's Northtowns, all of the Southtowns, and much of the Southern Tier. The district includes two of the eleven Finger Lakes: Keuka Lake and Seneca Lake.

The district comprises six entire counties: Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Chemung, Schuyler, and Steuben Counties, along with parts of Erie County. The largest cities in the district are Jamestown, and Elmira. With a Cook Partisan Voting Index rating of R+12, it is the most Republican district in New York.

Democrat Tracy Mitrano challenged Republican incumbent Tom Reed in the November 6, 2018 election. Reed won reelection on November 6, 2018, retaining his seat for a fourth term. Reed's 8.4% margin of victory was his smallest since his first election in 2012. Reed and Mitrano also faced off in 2020, where Reed won again, this time with a margin of 16.6%.

On March 21, 2021, in light of recent sexual harassment allegations, Reed announced that he would not be seeking reelection in 2022. He resigned on May 10, 2022, leaving the seat vacant. A special election was held on August 23, which was won by Republican Joe Sempolinski. Sempolinski opted not to run for a full term in the regularly scheduled 2022 election, which was won by Nick Langworthy.

Recent election results
In New York, there are numerous minor parties at various points on the political spectrum. Certain parties often endorse either the Republican or Democratic candidate for every office, hence the state electoral results contain both the party votes, and the final candidate votes.

Scozzafava dropped out of the race just prior to the election and endorsed Democrat Bill Owens. The results were not certified by the New York State Board of Elections until December 15, 2009.
