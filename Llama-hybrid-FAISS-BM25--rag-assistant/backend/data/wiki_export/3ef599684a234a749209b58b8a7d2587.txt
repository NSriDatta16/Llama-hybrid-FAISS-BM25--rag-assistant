Mary Jane Shannon 
Mary Jane Shannon was born in the Surrey area in 1876, making her one of the first and perhaps most famous pioneers to be born in Surrey, BC. Her father, Thomas, was an Irishman and a sailor by trade. In the early 1860s he emigrated from the US and established a homestead on the Fraser River. 
Her mother, Mary Robertson, was Indian-English, and from Saskatchewan.

The young Miss Shannon was eager to find organized Women's Groups. During the Boer War and the First World War she organized overseas aid and a Women's Army Auxiliary. She was also an advocate of giving women the vote.

Her literary career began early with some small booklets that gained moderate success. She also wrote a series of books on this area and won the vote of most of the people across Canada. She soon became noted in literary societies abroad for her speeches.

On January 19, 1959, she was on hand with local dignitaries for the opening of Mary Jane Shannon Elementary School. Shortly afterward she was forced into retirement because of failing health and died soon after.
