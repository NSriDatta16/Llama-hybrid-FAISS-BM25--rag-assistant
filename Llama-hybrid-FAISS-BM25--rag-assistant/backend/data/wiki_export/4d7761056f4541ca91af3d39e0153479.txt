During the second world war the club became a munitions factory producing bullets for the nearby RAF camp in Sealand. After the war it became a Conservative Club and a place for many Mancot villagers to socialise. It was well known for its snooker tables and cabaret nights. Both the club and fish shop were demolished for housing.
