Hope railway station serves the village of Hope in Flintshire, Wales. The station is  north of Wrexham Central on the Borderlands Line. The name of the station in Welsh is Yr HÃ´b.

History
The station was originally known as Caergwrle, with the name changing to Hope Village on 1 January 1899, to differentiate it from Caergwrle and Hope Exchange stations, with the latter being just north of Penyffordd. The station had a 17-lever signal box at the northern end of the Wrexham-bound platform, with an adjacent third through line around the outside of the platform, and a goods yard with a cattle pen and one-ton crane. The signal box was opened in 1885 and closed on 1 August 1965, and the goods yard closed on 4 May 1964.  The station buildings here have been demolished since the station became unstaffed in 1969.

Facilities
Each of the two platforms has an electronic timetable (CIS screen), timetable poster board, a waiting shelter and CCTV. There is a cycle rack and lock-up on platform 1 and a payphone on platform 2. Entry to the station is by a ramp. Access to each platform is straightforward, with a pedestrian level crossing at the southern end of the platforms. However, neither platform has any seating.
