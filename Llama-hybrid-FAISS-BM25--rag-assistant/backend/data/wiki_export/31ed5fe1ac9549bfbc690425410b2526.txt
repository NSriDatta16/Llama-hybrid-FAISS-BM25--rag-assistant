Milly-Molly-Mandy is a set of six children's books written and illustrated by English writer Joyce Lankester Brisley published over the period 1928 to 1967. The books follow a little girl, Milly-Molly-Mandy, who wears a pink-and-white striped dress. The illustrations show Milly-Molly-Mandy growing from about age four through to age eight. Translations have been published in at least nine languages, including Finnish, Polish and Icelandic.

Milly-Molly-Mandy's real name is Millicent Margaret Amanda, but she was given the nickname because of the length of her full name. Her adventures are the everyday events of village life: running errands, going to school, making presents, fishing, picnicking, and so on. She lives in "the nice white cottage with the thatched roof" on the edge of a small village. Her parents, grandparents, aunt and uncle also live in the cottage. Her friends are Billy Blunt, a slightly older boy whose parents run a corn shop and Little-Friend-Susan, who lives in the cottage down the road. Occasionally, the stories include other friends such as Miss Muggin's niece Jilly; Bunchy, a slightly younger girl who first appears in the story 'Milly-Molly-Mandy gets a New Dress, and Jessamine, a wealthy girl whose family often vacations at The House with the Iron Railings.

Origin
The stories were originally published in the Christian Science Monitor, beginning in 1925. They were first published as a collection, Milly-Molly-Mandy Stories, in 1928.

Setting
The stories take place in south east England, and because of the proximity to the sea and the downs, and the chalk roads in the village, they would appear to take place near to the south coast.  There are map illustrations inside the front covers of each book. Each differs slightly to indicate the different events in the stories. When they take a trip to the seaside by train, another illustration has white cliffs which would suggest Kent or Sussex, and is visually rather akin to Eastbourne.  The author was born in Bexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex, which is the next town east of Eastbourne.  Both Bexhill and Eastbourne have railway stations.  Milly-Molly-Mandy's village (possibly based on picturesque Alfriston or similar in East Sussex) does not have a railway station but she goes to a nearby town via pony and trap to take the train, these could be akin to Polegate, Berwick or Glynde which are close to Alfriston (if the author did base the stories on her own nearby area).  The year is the late 1920s, given the state of inventions; cars are just spreading into general use but there are no telephones, household electricity or aeroplanes as a rule.

Because she was moving from the town into the cottage, Miss Edwards writes to Milly-Molly-Mandy's mother to ask if she might stay for a few days while she gets the cottage sorted out.

Joyce Lankester Brisley illustrated her stories with pen and ink line drawings which continue to be featured in current editions. Color frontispieces with Brisley's watercolors were featured in the six original books published by George G. Harrap & Co. Brisley's original artwork is heId at the V&A Archive of Art and Design.

In 2000, Clara Vulliamy illustrations were featured throughout the 75th anniversary edition, The Big Milly-Molly-Mandy Storybook, released by Kingfisher-Macmillian. The Vulliamy watercolors were also used as cover art for both Kingfisher's Milly-Molly-Mandy Stories (2001) and The Best of Milly-Molly-Mandy 2005 series, with Brisley's original pen and ink drawings within these books.

Reception
While acknowledging that the stories have been sometimes represented as twee and sentimental, Lucy Mangan, writing in The Guardian, describes them as delightful and comforting: "each story is a miniature masterpiece, as clear, warm and precise as the illustrations by the author that accompanied them".

In a review for Girl Museum'', Rebecca Taylor noted the "pure innocence of the tales" depicting an idealized rural England illustrated "how country life for girls was very different from city life." She also described Milly-Molly-Mandy character as "kind, strong, adventurous and brave" justifying her positive generational appeal.
