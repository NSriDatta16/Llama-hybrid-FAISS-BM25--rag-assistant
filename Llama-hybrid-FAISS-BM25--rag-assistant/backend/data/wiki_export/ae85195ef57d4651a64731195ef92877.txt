History 
Remains of I. amancaes have been found in archaeological sites near the city of Lima.

The flowering of this species was the subject of a festival ("Festival de Amancaise") celebrated in June in Lima, until the first half of the 1800s. In a place among the hills surrounding Lima, people from the city gathered annually to celebrate the flowering of the plant in a festival with music and dance, similar to May Day. The festival attracted people from all classes of the society then, while a common sight was people sporting the flowers in their garments.

I. amancaes is considered an endangered species by the IUCN since 1997.
