Biography
David Loiseau was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada to Haitian parents. He had expressed his concern for the people of Haiti and for his grandparents who were still residing in Haiti at the time of the earthquake of 2010. He has urged people to donate and to help the country as much as they can. "I don't want to sleep," he said.  "I want to get the message out."

MMA career

UCC
Loiseau began his MMA career fighting for the Canadian-based Universal Combat Challenge (UCC) (later sold and renamed TKO Major League MMA.) He earned a record of 8–2, including wins over Shawn Tompkins, Joe Doerksen and Tony Fryklund.

Ultimate Fighting Championship
Loiseau made his UFC debut in April 2003 at UFC 42, defeating Mark Weir by KO. Later in the year, at UFC 44, he lost a unanimous decision to Jorge Rivera.

After going 2–1 in the TKO promotion, Loiseau returned to the UFC in 2005 with TKO wins of Gideon Ray, Charles McCarthy and Evan Tanner. He then lost back-to-back unanimous decisions in 2006, to Rich Franklin at UFC 58 and to Mike Swick at UFC 63.

In 2009, after going 4–2 in smaller promotions, Loiseau returned again, losing another unanimous decision to Ed Herman at UFC 97. He was subsequently released from the UFC.

After a TKO win over Chester Post at 	MFL 2 - Battleground, Loiseau returned to the UFC and lost to Mario Miranda via TKO on June 12, 2010, at UFC 115. He was again released from the UFC following this loss.

Independent Promotions
In his first fight after his last UFC release, Loiseau defeated Leopoldo Serao at Tachi Palace Fights 8: All or Nothing for the TPF Middleweight Championship via TKO in the fifth round, when the doctor declared Serao too badly cut to continue.

Loiseau was expected to defend the title at TPF 10 on Aug 5, against Givanildo Santana. But on July 28, 2011, Loiseau's agent announced he had sustained an injury which would require surgery, and would not be able to fight. Loiseau later revealed in an interview with KORE Vision that he underwent two surgeries, one in September and the other in November 2011, for an inside and outside meniscus repair in his left elbow.

Loiseau made his return to the cage to defeat Christopher McNally by TKO at the CES event Real Pain on October 6, 2012, at the Dunkin’ Donuts Center in Providence, Rhode Island.

Loiseau was scheduled to fight in Calgary on July 12, 2013, against Marcus Vinicius for Aggression Fighting Championship 20, but the Calgary commission did not allow that fight. He instead fought in Montreal at Challenge MMA 2 on August 17, taking a unanimous decision from Caleb Grummet.

Loiseau was scheduled to fight Mike Kent on October 25, in the main event of ECC 18 in Halifax, Nova Scotia.  Loiseau won the ECC Light-Heavyweight title with a quick TKO over Kent.

Loiseau faced Dwayne Lewis on June 7, 2014, in the main event at WSOF Canada 2. Loiseau lost via unanimous decision.

Filmography
Loiseau was co-featured in a mixed martial arts documentary The Striking Truth (2010) alongside Georges St-Pierre.

In 2012, Loiseau was the main character in a reality TV show Crowtime, focusing on following Loiseau around the world searching for training.

Personal life
