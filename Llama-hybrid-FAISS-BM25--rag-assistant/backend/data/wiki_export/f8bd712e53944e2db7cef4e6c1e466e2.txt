Herzlinger's love for film began at a young age with his first viewing of the film E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial, said the director in an interview for The Film That Changed My Life by Robert K. Elder.

I think it gave us permission to believe, and I’ll tell you right now, one of my biggest things as a person, as a filmmaker, is being able to believe. If I didn’t have that and didn’t have that ability, I would have failed at this business.
