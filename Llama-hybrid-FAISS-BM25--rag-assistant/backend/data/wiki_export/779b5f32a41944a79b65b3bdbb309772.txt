The city of Sydney, Australia, is home to some of the finest and most famous beaches in the world. There are well over 100 beaches in the city, stretching from Palm Beach in the north to Garie Beach in the south, ranging in size from a few metres to several kilometres, located along the city's Pacific Ocean coastline and its harbours, bays and rivers.

With around 70 surf beaches and dozens of harbour coves, Sydney is almost unrivalled in the world for the number and quality of beaches available. The water and sand among the city beaches, despite their popularity, are remarkably clean. The beach watch program was established in 1989 in response to community concern about the impact of sewage pollution on human health and the environment at Sydney's ocean beaches.

Ocean beaches
Sydney's ocean beaches include the internationally renowned Bondi, Coogee, Cronulla and Manly. The ocean beaches are usually divided into the Northern Beaches, located north of the entrance to Sydney Harbour and the southern beaches which are in the Eastern Suburbs and Sutherland Shire area. Most beach suburbs have one beach but some have more. Manly has eight beaches that range from the large 1.6Â km Ocean Beach to the tiny Fairy Bower Beach.
