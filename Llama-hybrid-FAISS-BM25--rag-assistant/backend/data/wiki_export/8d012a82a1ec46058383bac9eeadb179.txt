Spackling paste or spackle is a putty used to fill holes, small cracks, and other minor surface defects in wood, drywall, and plaster. Typically, spackling is composed of gypsum plaster from hydrated calcium sulfate and glue.

Comparison with joint compound

Spackling paste is comparable and contrastable with joint compound as both look similar and serve the similar purpose of filling in low spots in walls and ceilings. The chief differences are that spackling paste typically dries faster, shrinks less during drying, and is meant for smaller repairs, and not for a whole room or house. It is not uncommon for the general public to call any of these products "spackle", but tradespersons usually specify joint compound (drywall mud) when that is specifically meant.

Spackle trademark
Spackle is an abandoned trademark of the Muralo Company, located in Bayonne, New Jersey.  Muralo's product is dry powder, to be mixed with water by the user to form putty or paste brought to market in 1927, then patented and trademarked in 1928. The term spackle has since become a genericized trademark applied in the United States to a variety of household hole-filling products.

The first written appearance of the generic use of the word spackle was around 1940. The product name was likely derived from the German word , meaning "putty knife" or "filler." Other possible origins include Russian  (tr. ; to fill holes with putty or caulk), Polish  (spatula or putty knife), and Yiddish  (to fill in small holes in plaster), all of which are likely derived from German.

Polyfilla
In the UK, Ireland, South Africa, Australia, and Canada, the brand "Polyfilla", multipurpose filler, is used as a generic term for spackling paste, even though it differs from spackle in being cellulose based. The manufacturers claim that it has an advantage over spackle in that it does not shrink or crack.
