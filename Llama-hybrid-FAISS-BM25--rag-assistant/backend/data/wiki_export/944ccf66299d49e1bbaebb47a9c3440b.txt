Kizhakke Kotta, also known by its English name East Fort, is a busy commercial street located at the heart of the central business district of Thiruvananthapuram city in Kerala. Since Trivandrum was the capital of the kingdom of Travancore, East Fort has been a commercial centre. It also has the city's main bus stand, multiple theatres and the famous Padmanabha Swamy Temple.

History

East Fort got its name from the eastern entrance to the fort built by the Kings of Travancore. The old city was all inside the fort on four sides with the Sri Padmanabha Swamy temple at the center. It is said that there were huge metal gates on this entrance to the Fort which was decorated with the symbol of a conch, which was the insignia of the Royal Family of Travancore.

Significance

East Fort  is today the heart of Thiruvananthapuram city. It is the central bus depot for the city bus services run by the state-run KSRTC. It is linked by MG Road to the rest of downtown Thiruvananthapuram, and is the point of diversion to other parts of the city, as well as to the famed Kovalam beach. The city's Central railway station, as well as the Central Bus Stand (for long distance buses) are both a few minutes walk from East Fort, as are most of Thiruvananthapuram's cinemas, as well as top cultural venues and shopping malls. Padmanabha Swamy Temple, from which the city takes its name (Thiru Anantha Puram means 'the city (puram) of Holy (Thiru) Anantha, another name for Vishnu, who is the deity of Padmanabha Swamy Temple), are situated inside the East fort entrance.

Another important landmark is the 125-year-old Attakulangara Government Central High School (situated near Gandhi park), which was established in the year 1889 by social activist Marthandan Thampi during the reign of Ayilyam Tirunal.

Parameswara Iyer, former Chief Minister Pattom Thanu Pillai (chemistry), social reformer Sahodaran Ayyappan, former Chief Justice of erstwhile Travancore, U.
