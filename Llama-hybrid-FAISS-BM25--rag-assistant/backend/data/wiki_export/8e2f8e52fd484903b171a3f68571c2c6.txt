Beetletron
 First Appearance: "Escape from Edenoi" Pt. 2 (9/16/95)
 Voice Actor: Richard George

A large robot with hand-mounted cannons and tank treads instead of legs and feet. He spoke in a robotic monotone. His mission was to eliminate Combat Chopper and Magno so Dex could be outnumbered by Dregon's forces. He can attack with the guns on his body called Beetle Blasters.

A robotic Insectovore that impersonated Dex's driving instructor Mr. Li (portrayed by Billy Matsuda too). He can attack with his laser cannon arm and shoot a red beam from the red part of his head. Passing off as Mr. Li, Larvatron tried to run Dex over, but Dex held onto the car until he found a safe place to let go. After Larvatron dropped his disguise, Dex became Masked Rider and severed the robot's head with the Rider Kick. However, Larvatron had a backup head: a powerful four-way cannon. He fired the cannons on Dex, who then enlisted the aid of Combat Chopper. While on Combat Chopper, Dex managed to destroy him with his Electro Saber.

A three-eyed green moth monster who has the ability to use moths to turn humans into Insectovores. He can also shoot lasers from his eye and wrap anyone in his long tongue. Count Dregon had Nefaria send the Maggots to lure Hal and Albee towards Mothitron during their bug hunt. Once that plan worked, Mothitron used his moths to infect the two of them. Slowly, Hal and Albee, who were immobilized by the attack, took on the characteristics of an Insectovore (claws, green skin, bug eyes, etc.). Ferbus, though, was able to escape and warn Dex. Using a butterfly Ferbus had caught, Dex created an antidote. As Masked Rider, Dex took Magno and the antidote to Hal and Albee's location, but then he was ambushed by Mothitron. During the battle, Magno tackled Mothitron and took Masked Rider to the cave. Once inside, while looking for Hal and Albee, Dex was attacked by Mothitron again. Dex chopped off Mothitron's tongue, but Mothitron still overwhelmed Dex. Magno tunneled into the cave to save Dex.

Dex's friend Donais was sent to Earth to give him the Super Gold upgrade. However, Donais was captured by the Maggots and taken to the Spiderbase, where he was then brainwashed into becoming Dregon's loyal servant. Dregon had been working on an artificial Masked Rider power, but it was too dangerous to test on himself, so he used it on Donais to turn him into Robo Rider. Robo Rider was silver and black with green eyes. He also held two swords in battle. Robo Rider attacked the school causing Dex to transform and fight him. Robo Rider retreated and confronted Count Dregon on why he sent Edentada down to Earth. After attacking Gork, Count Dregon instructed Robo Rider to keep the Edentada in its cave...which Robo Rider does. After Masked Rider escapes the cave that Edentada was in, Robo Rider attacked as Masked Rider warns him that Edentada is starting to make the area destabilized.

 Voice Actor: Bob Papenbrook

A savage anteater-like creature with crab-like claws. Edentada is a creature that feasted on Edenoites and acquired their powers. The Edentada was a fierce digger.

During the confrontation, Robo Rider forced it back in the cave. It starts to cause earthquakes when it starts to get hungry for Masked Rider causing Count Dregon to send Nefaria to stop its hunger strike. Masked Rider finds the cave that Edentada is in and fights it before Nefaria arrives with Cyclopter, Double Face, and Gork to bring Edentada back. However, Edentada attacked them which caused some magma to be released. As Masked Rider headed to the surface, Edentada started digging fast causing the entire area to become destabilized. After defeating Robo Rider and obtaining the Super Gold powers, Dex transformed into Masked Rider and then transforms into his Super Gold form to fight Edentada. Dex discovers that Edentada has planted a bomb. After disarming the bomb, Dex had Combat Chopper tackle Edentada. Dex then used his Ecto-Ray blaster to destroy Edentada.

 Voice Actor: John C. Hyke

A blue robotic monster who can shoot lasers from his eyes and fingers. After the Maggots mistakenly capture the Stewarts' grandmother instead of Molly and Albee, Grandma Stewart mistook the case that Termasect was in for trash and discarded it down the launch tube (which she thought was a garbage disposal) sending it down to Earth. Cycloptor said that it would be out of control, but Count Dregon says that he'll see how Termasect does with Masked Rider. Dex as the Masked Rider found Termasect and confronted him. After an attack from Termasect, Dex changed into his Super Gold form and summoned Combat Chopper (who was then transformed into Super Chopper).

Following Termasect's destruction, Count Dregon had Nefaria place Grandma Stewart (who accidentally got petrified) near Slimeasect as bait. Dex arrived at the scene as Masked Rider and battled Slimeasect. When Slimeasect started to eat him, Dex called Magno whom Slimeasect moved out of the way of. After Dex destroyed Slimeasect with the Electro Saber, he restored his family's grandmother.

Recyclotron
 First Appearance: "Something's Trashy" (11/18/95)
 Voice Actor: Sparky Thornton

During a clean-up campaign in Leawood, Cyclopter's Reanimator Ray revived a fallen robot called Cyclotron. When upgraded to Recyclotron, his head was modified with a cooling helmet that kept the monster from overheating (which was the one flaw that led to his destruction in an earlier fight with Masked Rider). In addition to interchangeable arms, leg cannons, and metallic wrappings emitted from a compartment in his torso, he also had the power to control any electrical appliance. Using two cars, he seemingly killed Masked Rider with a missile launched from his right leg cannon. Recyclotron then attacked Leawood with reanimated appliances. Hal took it upon himself to go after Recyclotron with a Catho-Destabilizer weapon he invented. Unfortunately for Hal, Recyclotron took control of the Catho-Destabilizer until Masked Rider arrived. After a fierce fight, Dex managed to kick off his cooling helmet and knock him down with the Rider Kick. Dex then destroyed Recyclotron with the Electro Saber.

Dex transformed into Masked Rider and used Magno to trace the mist back to the source. Dex engaged Fire Bug at the factory. Fire Bug dragged Dex into a room where it started a fire.

Hydrasect is a colorful female bee-like monster with wings on her head. Hydrasect had the ability to fly with her wings and shoot needles from her hands. When Nefaria told Count Dregon that they need an Insectivore that is cunning, Count Dregon considered using a shapeshifter called Hydrasect. When launched from the Spiderbase, Nefaria, the Maggots and later some Commandoids accompanied Hydrasect to monitor the progress. The Commandoids mistook a Scandislavian exchange student named Bjorgy as Dex (due to him wearing one of Dex's Jackets) and took him to the quarry where Hydrasect was waiting. Upon learning this, Dex transformed and went after them. When Bjorgy encountered Hydrasect, she thought he was Dex until he arrived. While Bjorgy hid, Dex engaged Hydrasect and managed to knock out her out of the sky for a short time. Upon throwing Dex into her chamber, Hydrasect shapeshifted into an even more powerful form known as Arachnida: a large 4-legged inhuman female drider who had a set of spider legs on her back and two spider legs for a left arm.

During the fight, Dex ends up hitting the Red Fusion Beam and ends up in the Spiderbase's tractor beam with Robosect. Dex broke free from Robosect's grasp only to be blasted from the tractor beam by Robosect. After being located by Ferbus, Magno, and Combat Chopper, Dex is informed by Magno that Robosect is detected in the sub-basement of Leawood's Ancient History Museum.

The leader could also blast an electric forcefield from his scythe to bind Dex in battle. In Count Dregon's latest attempt to steal the Masked Rider powers, Double Face stumbled upon an idea to use a tractor beam to bring Dex up to the Spiderbase. To help out, Count Dregon has Nefaria have the Skull Reapers "escort" Dex into the tractor beam. When Ferbus is left behind at the motocross park, Dex heads there to save him only to be ambushed by the Skull Reapers. This tactic works as Dex ends up a prisoner of Count Dregon. Upon learning of Dex's capture, Magno and Combat Chopper emit some energy to overload the Spiderbase enough for Dex to escape. Count Dregon orders his minions to send the Skull Reapers down to help recapture Dex. As the Skull Reapers show up on their motorcycles, Dex transforms and fights them on board Combat Chopper. After knocking the Skull Reapers off their motorcycles, Dex is bound by the lead Skull Reaper's attack. Magno discovers that the Skull Reapers can't stand water and tells this to Dex.

In "The Heat is On," two Skull Reapers helped Heliotoid fight Dex until they were knocked down by Magno.

Heliotoid
 First Appearance: "The Heat is On" (2/17/96)
 Voice Actor: Ed Neal

A robotic insectoid monster whose heat manipulation abilities caused an immense heat wave which caused Ferbus to fall ill. Heliotoid does this by getting its energy from the sun in which Count Dregon hopes that Heliotoid will become strong enough to destroy Masked Rider. To counteract with Count Dregon's plot, Hal started inventing the Quantum Cooler to help make things cooler. To keep it from being complete and thwarting Heliotoid, Nefaria and the Maggots were sent to make sure it isn't completed which doesn't go well for the Maggots. When Heliotoid has gathered enough energy, Count Dregon has Nefaria send Heliotoid to attack. Dex detected Heliotoid attacking the power plant and transforms. Upon fighting him and two Skull Reapers, Dex fought them alongside Magno and Combat Chopper. Upon fighting Heliotoid, Dex transformed into his Super Gold form where Heliotoid's solar attacks wouldn't work on him. Heliotoid locked his arms around Masked Rider so that the sun could weaken him.

For that, he had the Maggots lure Dex to Cycloptor so that he can take him on in battle. After the first fight, Count Dregon sent Electrosect down to assist Cycloptor. During the second fight, Dex fought Cycloptor and Electrosect. While Cycloptor retreated, Electrosect started to drain Dex of his powers.

To assist in a plot to capture the population of Leawood and enslave them on Edenoi, Count Dregon unleashed Tentaclon to hide the machine from Dex until it was ready. When Dex detected the activity, he arrived only to be ambushed by the Maggots unleashed by Tentaclon. After the Maggots were defeated, Tentaclon attacked. After a brief fight, Tentaclon disappeared alongside the Maggots, the Commandoids, and the Mass-Molecular Transfer Machine. When the crystal was charged up, Tentaclon had the Commandoids install the crystal into the Mass-Molecular Transfer Machine. When the test run is complete, it is sensed by Dex who manages to slip away. Dex ended up fighting Tentaclon again who kept teleporting in battle. When Tentaclon gets Dex in his tentacles, Combat Chopper saves Dex. When Tentaclon disappears again, Combat Chopper managed to detect him.

Dex detected Blue-Fanged Louse at the power plant and became Masked Rider to fight him. Dex managed to get overwhelmed by Blue-Fanged Louse even when Dex's Rider Kick energy is absorbed. When it absorbed the Masked Rider powers upon Gork's arrival, it was too much for the Blue-Fanged Louse enough to regress it to the size of a louse. This enabled Dex to get away on Magno. Upon hearing a suggestion from Gork, Dregon sent Blue-Fanged Louse and three Commandoids incognito as a band named "Battle Cry" at the Battle of the Bands contest. Battle Cry's music was causing immense tremors around the arcade. Dex discovered their true forms and cut the power enough for Blue-Fanged Louse and the Commandoids to escape. When Dex catches up to them, Blue-Fanged Louse assumes his true form and ends up attacking the city as it absorbs the energy attacks from the Spiderbase. Dex transforms and fights Blue-Fanged Louse.

As a diversion, Nefaria disguises the root of the Ball Tree of Edenoi (which has some side effects on Ferbus' kind) as a cupcake to deal with Ferbus. While the Stewarts try to coral Ferbus even when he grows, Dex and Combat Chopper end up fighting Cycloptor on his upgraded Cannon Wheels. When Dex is on the defensive, Count Dregon sends Cyborsect to assist Cycloptor. The attacks of Cyborsect and Cycloptor's Cannon Wheels was enough to knock Dex off of Combat Chopper. Dex called on Magno to get him and Combat Chopper away from Cycloptor and Cyborsect.

Count Dregon launches Tripron down to Earth. Meanwhile, Donais comes back to Earth to give Dex the Super Blue upgrade. While Donais works on the upgrade, Dex traces Tripron's signal and ends up attacked by the Tripron Units. After Donais arrived upon completing the upgrade, Dex transforms only to be captured by Nefaria. She and Tripron trapped Dex in a room with spikes on the walls that are closing in on him.

When it spills, Dex follows Liquisect's liquified form to the boat yard. Dex transforms into Masked Rider and manages to knock him down with the Rider Kick. Liquisect shapeshifts into a shadow and ambushes Dex. After Dex broke free, Liquisect escaped after being knocked down by Magno.

As Super Blue, Dex could easily maneuver against Twister Bug who managed to escape. During their second fight at the quarry, Twister Bug almost had Dex in his Super Blue form trapped by burying him alive in a large ant hill.

Since Dex was going to be on a plane, it meant that he wouldn't be able to protect the city from Solarsect without revealing his identity. Eventually, Dex was able to engage in battle with Solarsect while Ferbus flew the plane. As Solarsect gets Dex trapped in his grip, Dex called Combat Chopper who managed to save Dex.
