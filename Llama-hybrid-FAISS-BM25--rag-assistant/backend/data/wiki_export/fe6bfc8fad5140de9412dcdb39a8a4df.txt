In fact, there was a large controversy in Canada surrounding the banning of the children's book.

Background

Summary 
The story begins with the protagonist, an unnamed elementary school girl, exclaiming, "I don't know who has dads that are blue!" From there, another character named "Lou" is introduced. Lou has two "blue" dads, and proceeds to describe how "blue" they are. The plot then goes back and forth between the protagonist and Lou, with the protagonist asking all sorts of questions about Lou's dads. After all of the questions are asked by the protagonist, Lou explains his dads are "blue", and "they're just like all other dads---- black, white, or green." It is at this point that the protagonist realizes that even though Lou's dads are "blue", they can still do all of the things that a typical dad would do. At the end of the book, another character is brought in, named Jean. Jean invites the protagonist and Lou to come see her dad, who is green.

Reception

Book reviews 
According to Book Links, One Dad, Two Dads, Brown Dad, Blue Dads is a warming story that uses rhymes and goofiness to expose prejudice. On the contrary, Louise L. Sherman of the Anna C. Scott School, claims that young children would take the book at "face value", seeing only the silly aspect of the book, whereas older kids would be better off with a more clear-cut explanation of the material. This review points out the potential issues that One Dad, Two Dads, Brown Dad, Blue Dads presents to differently aged children. Anne Kingston of The National Post points out the book’s “didactic messages and uninspired illustrations,” concluding that the book will not be harmful due to the fact that “five-year-olds don’t filter information through a sexually aware consciousness”.

Controversy 
The picture book was met with challenges primarily for its inclusion of homosexual parents. One such example was when One Dad, Two Dads, Brown Dad, Blue Dads, Asha's Mums, and Belinda's Bouquet were brought into question in the Canadian school system. The book was initially banned by the Surrey School Board based on the contents of its dedication, which reads: "To Jacob, who has only one mom and one dad, But don't feel sorry for him - they are both pretty great parents." James Chamberlain, a gay teacher within the Surrey School District, fought to have these three books approved by the school district. Chamberlain and four fellow litigants spent $400,000 of their own money to challenge the banning of the book. When brought forward to the Supreme Court of Canada, the following was stated: "No age is too tender for children to learn the value of tolerance." The resulting challenge has allowed free access to the book, as the morals teach tolerance, regardless of how different one is from another.
