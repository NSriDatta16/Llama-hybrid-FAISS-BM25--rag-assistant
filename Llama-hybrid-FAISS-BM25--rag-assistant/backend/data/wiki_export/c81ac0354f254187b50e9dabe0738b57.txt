Figure skating has been part of the Olympic Games since 1908 and has been included in 26 Olympic Games. There have been 286 medals (96 gold, 95 silver, and 95 bronze) awarded to figure skaters representing 29 representing National Olympic Committees. Six events have been contested but one, men's special figures, was discontinued after a single Olympics.

Canadian ice dancers Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir are the only figure skaters to win five Olympic medals (3 gold, 2 silver). Swedish figure skater Gillis Grafström (3 gold, 1 silver) and Russian figure skater Evgeni Plushenko (2 gold, 2 silver) each have four medals. Seventeen figure skaters have won three medals. The only skaters with three consecutive titles are Grafström in men's singles, Sonja Henie (Norway) in ladies' singles, and Irina Rodnina (Soviet Union) in pairs. Sixteen figure skaters have earned two golds within the same discipline and five skaters have earned gold in two separate Olympic events.

On two occasions, there has been a podium sweep. Russian figure skaters hold the unique record for earning gold medals in all six Olympic figure skating events. Three skaters won Olympic medals in multiple figure skating disciplines.

Medalists

Men's singles

Men's special figures

Men's special figures was only included in one Olympic Games before being discontinued. The sole winner of the event was Russian Nikolai Panin, who gave his country its first ever Olympic gold medal.

Ladies' singles

Pairs

Ice dance

Team event
The team event is the newest Olympic figure skating event, first contested in the 2014 Games. It combines the four Olympic figure skating disciplines (men's singles, ladies' singles, pairs, and ice dance) into a single event; gold is awarded to the team that earns the most placement points. The results of the team event from 2022 Beijing Olympics are not final and no medals have been awarded. This is due to the ongoing investigation of ROC skater Kamila Valieva and allegations of doping and misconduct.

Multiple events
Only three skaters have won Olympic medals in multiple figure skating disciplines. All other multi-event medalists won medals in their discipline plus the team event (which, while being a separate event, is not considered its own skating discipline).

Two disciplines
In 1908, Madge Syers became the first skater to medal in multiple figure skating disciplines at a single Olympics. The only skater to match this feat was Ernst Baier in 1936. The only other skater to medal in multiple disciplines was Beatrix Loughran who did so at separate Olympics.

No skater has won gold medals in multiple disciplines.

One discipline plus team event
The team event was introduced at the 2014 Winter Olympics. It allowed skaters to medal twice while skating one discipline.

On 9 February 2014, Evgeni Plushenko became the first skater to win multiple figure skating events. On 12 February 2014, Tatiana Volosozhar and Maxim Trankov became the first skaters to win multiple events at a single Olympics. Four years later, Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir matched this feat.

The below table lists all skaters who have medaled in their own discipline and in the team event. (The number of team event medals are listed in parentheses with a "T".)

Summer and Winter Games
Since figure skating was held during the Summer Olympic Games in 1908 and 1920 before being moved to the Winter Olympic Games, three skaters medaled in figure skating in both the Summer and Winter Games.

Men's singles skater Gillis Grafström's first gold medal was earned at the 1920 Summer Olympics. His other three medals were won at the 1924–1932 Winter Games. Pair skaters Ludowika Jakobsson and Walter Jakobsson also earned gold during the 1920 Summer Olympics. They later medaled at the 1924 Winter Games.

Country records
