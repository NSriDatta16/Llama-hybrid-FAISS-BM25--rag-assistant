Aert de Gelder ( or Arent; October 26, 1645 – August 27, 1727) was a Dutch painter. He was the only Dutch artist to paint in the tradition of Rembrandt's late style into the 18th century.

Biography
De Gelder was born and died in Dordrecht.  He was one of Rembrandt’s last pupils while in Amsterdam, studying in his studio from 1661 to 1663. He was not only one of the most talented of Rembrandt’s pupils, but also one of his most devoted followers. Following Rembrandt's lead, de Gelder would paint such works as The Baptism of Christ and Ahimelech Giving the Sword of Goliath to David.  Story telling, transparent emotionalism, and an emphasis on the humanity of biblical characters are the distinguishing elements of his style.

Style

Inspired by Rembrandt's style, Gelder painted biblical scenes and portraits using his artistic ideas, well into the 18th century, without being influenced by contemporary new fashions. From the artistic point of view, his work cannot be considered as passive imitation of the master. He expresses inventiveness in the narrative, a taste for the theatrical and a strong emotional charge through the characters. All these traits made him one of the most important interpreters of Dutch painting of the late seventeenth century.
