History

 as seen with the JUST Medical Faculties Complex. Built by Acciona at a cost of approximately $120 million, the King Abdullah University Hospital was the culmination of efforts inaugurated by the late King Hussein bin Talal to address the critical lack of central, advanced medical facilities serving the population of Northern Jordan.  Though King Hussein laid the cornerstone in a 1994 ceremony, he himself did not live to see the completion of the massive hospital, named after his grandfather, the founder of Transjordan, King Abdullah I.  KAUH which was inaugurated by his Majesty King Abdullah II on 28 November 2002, has become, within short period of time, one of the most prominent and reputable non-profit hospitals in Jordan and the region. It opened with founding departments in obstetrics - gynecology, pediatrics, internal medicine, and general and special surgery, in addition to emergency facilities including a medevac heliport.  JUST medical, dentistry, and nursing students complete laboratories, practicals, internship, and residency at or in close conjunction with KAUH and its extensive facilities.
