The Kyabram District Football League (KDL) is an Australian rules football league in Victoria. It is made up of 15 teams; the most recent additions include Dookie United in 2018 and Shepparton East in 2019. The KDL is made up of smaller country town football clubs in the Goulburn Valley. The majority of these towns have a population base of around 1000 people, each of these clubs aims to field four football sides in the Senior, Reserve, Under 18 and Under 13 divisions of the KDFL as well as eight netball sides in A-Grade, B-Grade, C-Grade, C Reserve, 17 & Under, 15 & Under, 13 & Under and 11 & Under divisions,

The KDL season is made up of 18 rounds in the home and away season, with each side playing 16 games, at the conclusion of the home and away season, the top six teams in each division face off in the finals series. The top two teams in this series are assured a second chance at making the Grand Final, however the third, fourth, fifth and sixth placed teams have no such luxury and are eliminated after any loss, this system works to reward the teams who have performed better over the home and away season.

During the season, each club will play eight home games and eight away games, in finals however, venues are designated to different clubs on a cycle. For over a decade the Grand Final has been hosted by Goulburn Valley Football League ground, Mooroopna hosting on most occasions and Tatura being the venue in 2013.

History
The Kyabram District Football Association was formed in 1932, changing its name to Kyabram District Football League in 1960.
