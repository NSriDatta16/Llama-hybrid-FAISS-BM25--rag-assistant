Tovdal (historic: Lille Topdal) is a former municipality in the old Aust-Agder county in Norway. The  municipality existed from 1908 until its dissolution in 1967.  Tovdal municipality was made up of the valley surrounding the river Tovdalselva and since 1967 it has been a part of the present-day municipality of Åmli which is now in Agder county. The administrative centre of the municipality was the village of Hillestad where the Tovdal Church is located.

History
The parish of Lille Topdal was a part of the municipality of Åmli when civil municipalities were created in Norway on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). The municipality of Lille Topdal was established on 1 January 1908 when the municipality of Åmli was split into three separate municipalities: Lille Topdal (population: 389), Gjevedal (population: 590), and Åmli (population: 2,024). In 1922, the name of the municipality was changed from Lille Topdal to Tovdal. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1967, Tovdal (population: 161) was merged back into the municipality of Åmli. At the time of its dissolution, Tovdal was the smallest municipality in Norway by population.

Name
The municipality (originally the parish) was first named "Lille Topdal" after the Topdalen valley (). The first element comes from the old name for the local river Tovdalselva. That name is likely derived from the word  which means "mound" or "tuft". The last element is  which means "valley" or "dale". The prefix of the name is  which means "little". In 1922, the name was changed to "Tovdal" to more accurately represent the local pronunciation of the name.

Government

During its existence, this municipality was governed by a municipal council of directly elected representatives. The mayor was indirectly elected by a vote of the municipal council.
