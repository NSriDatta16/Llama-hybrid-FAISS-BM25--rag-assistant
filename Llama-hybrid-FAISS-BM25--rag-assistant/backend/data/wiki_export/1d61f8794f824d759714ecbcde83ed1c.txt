South Kensington is north of Northern Liberties, south of Norris Square, east of Ludlow, and west of Fishtown. The boundaries of the neighborhood are Berks St. (north), Girard Ave (south), Front St (east) and 6th St. (west).

After World War II, many neighborhoods in Philadelphia experienced a long period of decline, deindustrialization, and residential abandonment. In recent years, however, South Kensington has been increasingly gentrified,  following a similar pattern observed in adjacent Northern Liberties and Fishtown.  Although some industrial activity has continued along the American Street corridor, a historic location for heavy industry, a growing number of formerly vacant factories are being turned into lofts, condos, and artist workspaces.

The zip code for the area is 19122. There are two associations that serve the neighborhood: South Kensington Community Partners (SKCP)  and Olde Kensington Neighbors Association (OKNA).
