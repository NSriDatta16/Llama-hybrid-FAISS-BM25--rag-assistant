Lyrics
The lyrics feature Nilsson singing three characters (a narrator, a woman, and a doctor), each in a different voice. The woman drinks a mixture of lime juice and coconut milk, becomes sick, and calls the doctor. The doctor, annoyed at being woken up, tells her to drink the same thing again and call in the morning.

Music
An arpeggiated C7 chord accompanies the song throughout.
