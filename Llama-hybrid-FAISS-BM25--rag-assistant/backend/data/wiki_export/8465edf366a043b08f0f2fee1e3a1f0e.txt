Known as "Moon," Mullins was drafted in the fourth round of the 1971 NFL Draft and went on to win four Super Bowls with the Steelers (Super Bowls IX, X, XIII, and XIV). He can be remembered for a play in Super Bowl IX when he pulled on a sweep leaving an uncontested path for Franco Harris to trot in the end zone. Mullins also recovered an onside kick in Super Bowl X and recovered a fumble for a touchdown during the 1972 AFC Championship Game against the Miami Dolphins. Mullins retired after Super Bowl XIV.
