Wyre Forest is a local government district in Worcestershire, England. The district includes the towns of Kidderminster, Stourport-on-Severn and Bewdley, along with several villages and surrounding rural areas. The district is named after the ancient woodland of Wyre Forest.

The neighbouring districts are Bromsgrove, Wychavon, Malvern Hills, Shropshire and South Staffordshire.

History

The new district was named after the ancient woodland of Wyre Forest, much of which lies within the area.
