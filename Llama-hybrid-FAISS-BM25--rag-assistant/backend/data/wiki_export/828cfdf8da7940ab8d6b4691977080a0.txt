It continues for  to Highway 12 in Bentley, passing the southeastern shore of Sylvan Lake at Jarvis Bay as well as the Jarvis Bay Provincial Park. It intersects Highway 771  north of Bentley, which provides access to the west side of Gull Lake and Parkland Beach, and travels for  in a northwesterly direction to Rimbey; Highway 20 bypasses Rimbey while Highway 20A is a business route through the town and connects with Highway 53 west.

History 
Highway 20 was originally a short,  long highway that ran from Highway 11 in Sylvan Lake to the Highway 12 / Highway 51 intersection in Bentley. From this intersection, Highway 12 continued north to Rimbey, Breton, and Alsike. In the mid-1980s, when Highway 11 was realigned to bypass Sylvan Lake, Highway 20 was extended  to the south to connect with the new alignment. In January 1988, the  section of Highway 12 between Bentley and Alsike was redesignated as Highway 20, while Highway 51 was decommissioned and redesignated as the new western section of Highway 12.
