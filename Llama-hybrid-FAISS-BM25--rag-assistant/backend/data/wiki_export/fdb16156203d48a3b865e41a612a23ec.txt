History

Colonial times

In colonial times, Munali was intended as Northern Rhodesia's principal school for talented native Zambians. The school was first established in 1938 as Entral Trade School. Founded in its own right in 1947 as "Munali secondary School" with about 40 pupils, it was originally situated at the David Kaunda campus at "Old Munali". In 1953 the school moved from Old Munali to its current campus at "New Munali".

After independence in 1964, the new Government Cabinet was composed almost entirely of alumni of Munali Secondary School. Notable amongst this cohort were Kenneth Kaunda, and brothers Sikota and Arthur Wina (dcd), the latter having been the husband of Zambia's former vice-president, Inonge Wina. Other famous alumni include former mayors of Lusaka and several businessmen.

Although all the students were black Zambians, the teachers in the early days were European. Early members of the original teaching staff included: W.C.Little, P.K.Stevenson, Bill Shakspere and H.T. Lyons.

(There was no apartheid as such in Northern Rhodesia, but until 1964 education was racially segregated, with separate schools for whites, blacks, "Indians" and "Cape Coloureds").

Modern times

The head teacher was Esau Nkhoma from (2021 - 2022) till  [N/A] and Mrs Mulenga who is currently the Deputy Head. The school's pass rate now one of highest in country: 88% in 2006. All standard school subjects are taught.

Munali Secondary School now has three branches: Munali Boys Secondary School, Munali Girls Secondary School and Munali School for the Deaf and Blind. The school's slogan is "Only the best is good enough for Munali." The school produced the entire 1964 Independence Cabinet of the first Republican President of Zambia, Dr. Kenneth Kaunda, who himself is a former "Munalian".  The former President Mr. Rupiah Banda is also a former "Munalian". One unofficial slogan is "Once a Munalian, always a Munalian".

Classes are called M, U, N, A from Grade 8 to Grade 9 and M, U, N, A, L, I, S, E, C from grades 10 to 12. This nomenclature is derived from the name of the school: Munali Secondary School. 12M was known as the Kim Jong Il Class, named after the first President of the North Korea. The class had temporarily received financial support from the North Korean Embassy. The University of Zambia receives many students from Munali School. The school was a secondary school until 2001 when it became a high school. It only recently became a secondary school again after the education system was reorganised by the late President Michael Sata.
