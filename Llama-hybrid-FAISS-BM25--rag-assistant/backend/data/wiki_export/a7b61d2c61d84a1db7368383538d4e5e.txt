Nichya (Ничья in Russian Cyrillic; translates as "No one's"), is a singing, songwriting and producing duet consisting of Elena Kiper and Oleg Borschevsky. The group has released four singles, and one album to date.

History
Elena Kiper became known for her songwriting talents as a songwriter for another duo, t.A.T.u.

Kiper had written one last song for t.A.T.u., however it was discarded by the group. So, she decided to record it on her own. The song is known as "Ya Ne Glotayu" and sometimes "Ty Soshel S Uma". When Kiper met up with Oleg Borschevsky, they recorded a final version of the song with new music and lyrics and titled it "Nichya", which would become the duo's name.
