Mat P. Jarvis is a British electronic musician, who released one full-length CD and several other tracks on the Em:t Records label under the name Gas. Jarvis later released material under the name "Jarman".

Jarvis' work as Gas is often mistakenly credited to an alias used by unrelated German electronic musician Wolfgang Voigt.

His album Gas 0095, which includes "Microscopic", "Experiments on Live Electricity" and "Discovery", is noted for the inclusion of the track "Timestretch", which is rumoured to be a complete four-minute track shrunk down to one second.

Em:t Records went out of business before the follow-up album Gas 2298 could be released.
