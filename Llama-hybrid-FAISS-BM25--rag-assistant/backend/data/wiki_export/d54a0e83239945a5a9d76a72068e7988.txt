History
Starting point of Neuhofen was the declined village Medenheim, east of Neuhofen. Being property of the monastery Wissembourg since the 10th century, 1194 Medenheim was sold to the Cistercian monastery Himmerod. The Cistercians founded the farm Nova Curia („New Farm“ or „Neuer Hof“ in German) near Medenheim. More and more people from Medenheim moved to the new farm, and Medenheim declined.
