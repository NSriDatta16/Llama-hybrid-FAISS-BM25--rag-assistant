In 2005 Sanders completed a 2nd circumnavigation by motorbike taking 19 days 4 hours on a Yamaha R1.

In the summer of 2011, Sanders became the first person to ride from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego and back in under 49 days, 17 hours, a ride he completed on a Yamaha XT1200Z Super Ténéré. The first leg of the trip was completed in 21 days, just a few hours short of Dick Fish's record ride and easily outpacing the Guinness World Record of 35 days, currently held by Globebusters' Kevin and Julia Sanders.

In 1984 he repeated the world cycling circumnavigation riding about 22,000 km in a time of 79 days. Guinness World Records set the rules in 2003 and did not record Sanders' time as he did not cross antipodal points on the globe
Sanders still holds the Guinness World Record for fastest ride around the coast of Great Britain, riding a verified 4,800 miles (7,720 km) in 22 days.
Sanders has also cycled to the source of the White Nile, across the Sahara to Timbuktu and the length of South America.
