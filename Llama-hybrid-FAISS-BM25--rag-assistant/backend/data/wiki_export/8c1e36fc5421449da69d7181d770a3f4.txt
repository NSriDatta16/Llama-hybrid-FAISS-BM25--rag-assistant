Desire Walks On is the eleventh studio album by American rock band Heart, released on November 16, 1993, by Capitol Records. The majority of the album was co-written by lead members Ann and Nancy Wilson. It is Heart's final studio album to feature longtime members Howard Leese, who joined in 1975 and, aside from the Wilson sisters, is the band's longest-serving member, and Denny Carmassi, who had been its drummer since 1982. Layne Staley, lead vocalist of the Seattle grunge band Alice in Chains, sings with the Wilson sisters on the cover of Bob Dylan's "Ring Them Bells".

The album peaked at number 48 on the US Billboard 200, and on August 24, 1995, it was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments in excess of 500,000 copies in the United States. Desire Walks On spawned three charting singles: "Will You Be There (In the Morning)", which reached number 39 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, "Black on Black II" (a cover of a Dalbello song originally recorded for the 9½ Weeks film soundtrack), which peaked at number four on Billboards Mainstream Rock chart, and "The Woman in Me", which peaked at number 24 on Billboards Adult Contemporary chart.

The original 1993 European release and the 2001 US re-release were expanded to add Spanish-language versions of "The Woman in Me" and "Will You Be There (In the Morning)", the latter in a remixed format.
