In human mitochondrial genetics, Haplogroup Z is a human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroup.

Origin
Haplogroup Z is believed to have arisen in Central Asia, and is a descendant of haplogroup CZ.

Distribution
The greatest clade diversity of haplogroup Z is found in East Asia and Central Asia.  However, its greatest frequency appears in some peoples of Russia, such as Evens from Kamchatka (8/39 Z1a2a, 3/39 Z1a3, 11/39 = 28.2% Z total) and from Berezovka, Srednekolymsky District, Sakha Republic (3/15 Z1a3, 1/15 Z1a2a, 4/15 = 26.7% Z total), and among the Saami people of northern Scandinavia. With the exception of three Khakasses who belong to Z4, two Yakut who belong to Z3a1, two Yakut, a Yakutian Evenk, a Buryat, and an Altai Kizhi who belong to Z3(xZ3a, Z3c), and the presence of the Z3c clade among populations of Altai Republic, nearly all members of haplogroup Z in North Asia and Europe belong to subclades of Z1. The TMRCA of Z1 is 20,400 [95% CI 7,400 <-> 34,000] ybp according to Sukernik et al. 2012, 20,400 [95% CI 7,800 <-> 33,800] ybp according to Fedorova et al. 2013, or 19,600 [95% CI 12,500 <-> 29,300] ybp according to YFull. Among the members (Z1, Z2, Z3, Z4, and Z7) of haplogroup Z, Nepalese populations were characterized by rare clades Z3a1a and Z7, of which Z3a1a was the most frequent sub-clade in Newar, with a frequency of 16.5%. Z3, found in East Asia, North Asia, and MSEA, is the oldest member of haplogroup Z with an estimated age of ~ 25.4 Kya.  Haplogroup Z3a1a is also detected in other Nepalese populations, such as Magar (5.4%), Tharu, Kathmandu (mixed population) and Nepali-other (mixed population from Kathmandu and Eastern Nepal). S6).  Z3a1a1 detected in Tibet, Myanmar, Nepal, India, Thai-Laos and Vietnam trace their ancestral roots to China with a coalescent age of ~ 8.4 Kya

Fedorova et al. 2013 have reported finding Z*(xZ1a, Z3, Z4) in 1/388 Turks and 1/491 Kazakhs. These individuals should belong to Z1* (elsewhere observed in a Tofalar), Z2 (observed in Japanese), Z7 (observed in the Himalaya), Z5 (observed in Japanese), or basal Z* (observed in a Blang individual in Northern Thailand).
