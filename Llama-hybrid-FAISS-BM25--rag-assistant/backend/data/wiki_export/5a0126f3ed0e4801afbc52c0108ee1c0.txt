The Catholic Church in San Marino is part of the worldwide Catholic Church, under the leadership of the Pope in Rome.

Overview
San Marino is a predominantly Catholic state.

According to a 2021 report on religious freedom in the country, the population is 91.5% Christian. The country does not provide exact statistics of the religious affiliations of its people, but estimates in 2020 suggested that 85.45% of the population were Catholic, while 6% belonged to other Christian denominations.

In 2020, there were 19 priests and 21 nuns serving across 12 parishes.

There is no episcopal see in San Marino. Historically, the various parishes in San Marino were divided between two Italian dioceses, mostly in the Diocese of Montefeltro, and partly in the Diocese of Rimini. In 1977, the border between Montefeltro and Rimini was readjusted so that all of San Marino fell within the diocese of Montefeltro. 

In 2023, the bishop of Montefeltro-San Marino is Andrea Turazzi, and he resides in Pennabilli, in Italy.
