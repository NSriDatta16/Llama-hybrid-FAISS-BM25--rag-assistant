Hyoseong of Silla (r. 737–742, died 742) was the 34th to rule the Korean kingdom of Silla.  He was the second son of King Seondeok and Queen Sodeok.

Hyoseong took the daughter of the pajinchan Yeongjong as a concubine.  This led to palace strife, as the jealous queen killed the concubine and Yeongjong plotted to kill her.  Hyoseong had Yeongjong put to death.

After he died in 742, Hyoseong was cremated to the south of Beomnyusa temple, and his ashes were buried in the Sea of Japan (East Sea).
