Drees is an Ortsgemeinde – a municipality belonging to a Verbandsgemeinde, a kind of collective municipality – in the Vulkaneifel district in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Kelberg, whose seat is in the like-named municipality.

Geography

Location 
The municipality lies in the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth.

Neighbouring municipalities 
Drees borders in the north on Döttingen, in the northeast on Herresbach, Baar and Mittelbaar, in the east on Niederbaar, in the southeast on Nitz, in the south on Kirsbach, in the southwest on Welcherath, in the west on Nürburg and in the northwest on Meuspath.

History 
In 1222, Drees had its first documentary mention under the name Dreyse. The word comes from the Celtic term for "bubbling spring". This is akin to the old Germanic word Thrais, for "bubbles", "to bubble" or "to swirl". The namesake mineral spring, the result of volcanic activity in the area, no longer exists.

The village belonged to the Electorate of Cologne until 1794.

Politics

Municipal council 
The council is made up of 6 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.

Mayor 
Drees's mayor is Klaus Brachthäuser.

Coat of arms 
The German blazon reads: 

The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Per fess embattled of seven, azure a fountain with four streams argent, and argent a cross tau, hanging from each arm a bell, gules.

The partition horizontally across the middle in the pattern of a crenellated wall ("Per fess embattled") refers to the time when Drees belonged to the Electorate of Cologne Amt of Nürburg. The fountain is, in a way, a canting charge, referring to the municipality's name, which comes from an old Celtic word for a spring (although it hardly resembles the modern German word for this, Brunnen). The "cross tau" – one without an upper arm – is Saint Anthony's Cross and thus a reference to the municipality's patron saint, whose attributes include this cross and a bell, two of which also appear in these arms.
