DCLXVI: To Ride, Shoot Straight and Speak the Truth is the fourth album by the Swedish metal band Entombed, released in 1997.

DCLXVI is 666 in Roman numerals. The cover art features a statuette of the Aztec god Mictlantecuhtli.

This album shows a continuation of the death 'n' roll sound previously established on 1993's "Wolverine Blues", but eschews most traces of hardcore punk and traditional death metal in favor of a stoner rock and garage rock influenced sound.

The album was Metal Hammer magazine's #2 album of 1997. It was beaten by UK band Feeder's debut album Polythene.
