Blow Your Cool! is the third studio album by Australian rock group Hoodoo Gurus. It was released in April 1987 and peaked at number 2 on the Australian chart.

In 2009, Dave Faulkner said "When the Blow Your Cool! touring was over Clyde retired from the road and the band. At this point we persuaded Rick Grossman to join, contributing his tremendous bass skills to the band, and so we had reached what was to be our ultimate line-up. After that we only changed our haircuts (and underwear)." .

EMI re-released the album on February 6, 2005 with four additional tracks, a fold out poster and liner notes by Vicki Peterson of the Bangles. One of the additional tracks, "The Generation Gap" was their first recording with Grossman, and had been released as a single-only in 1988; it was their cover of Jeannie C. Riley's 1970 country song.

Reception
Cash Box magazine said "Australia's good rocking band is back with their most cohesive set to date. With help from LA’s Bangles and Dream Syndicate, the LP has an American flavor likely to touch off a tidal wave of interest at progressive retail outlets and alternative and/or adventurous radio."
