Zubov's method is a technique for computing the basin of attraction for a set of ordinary differential equations (a dynamical system). The domain of attraction is the set , where  is the solution to a partial differential equation known as the Zubov equation. Zubov's method can be used in a number of ways.

Statement

Zubov's theorem states that:

If  is an ordinary differential equation in  with , a set  containing 0 in its interior is the domain of attraction of zero if and only if there exist continuous functions  such that:
 ,  for ,  on 
 for every  there exist  such that  , if 
  for  or 
 

If f is continuously differentiable, then the differential equation has at most one continuously differentiable solution satisfying .
