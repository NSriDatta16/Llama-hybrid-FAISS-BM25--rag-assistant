Legislative history
National Assembly was established in 1960 by the Constitution of Gabon as an unicameral legislature. The members were elected by direct universal suffrage for a seven-year term. During the single-party rule from 1967 to 1990, all members were from Gabonese Democratic Party (PDG), the sole legal party. In 1979 the mandate of the members was reduced from seven years to five years. Single-party system was dropped in 1990. Bicameral system was introduced, and Senate of Gabon was established in 1997.
