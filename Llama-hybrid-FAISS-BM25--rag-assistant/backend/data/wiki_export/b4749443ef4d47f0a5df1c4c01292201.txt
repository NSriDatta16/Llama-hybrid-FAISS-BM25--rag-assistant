Shah Mohammad ( ;  ; 1780–1862), was a Punjabi poet who lived during the reign of Maharaja Ranjit Singh (1780 – 1839) and is best known for his book Jangnama (Book of War) written around 1846, which depicts  the First Anglo-Sikh War (1845 – 1846) that took place after the death of Maharaja Ranjit Singh in 1839.

It is widely believed by historians that Shah Mohammad had gathered his book material from many eye-witness accounts of his relatives employed in Maharaja Ranjit Singh's army. That's how he could piece together a complete picture of the battle between the Punjabis and the British. Therefore, Shah Mohammad's book explains reasons for the fall of Sikh rule in the Punjab.
