History
The area around Withypool has been inhabited since the Bronze Age and the Withypool Stone Circle can still be seen on top of Withypool Hill. The Brightworthy barrows lie on the Common; of three original, two survive.

Withypool is mentioned in the Domesday Book as being tended by three foresters: Dodo, Almer and Godric. The parishes of Hawkridge and Withypool were part of the Williton and Freemanners Hundred.

In the 14th century, Geoffrey Chaucer was in charge of the village in his duties as forester of North Petherton.

The red sandstone Withypool Bridge (or New Bridge) carries a small road over the River Barle. It was built in the 19th century and is a Grade II* listed building.

Civil parish 
On 1 April 1933 part of the parish of Hawkridge was merged with Withypool, on 1 June 1992 the merged parish was renamed "Withypool & Hawkridge". In 1931 the parish of Withypool (prior to the merge) had a population of 222.

Governance
The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council’s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.

Until 2023 The village fell within the non-metropolitan district of Somerset West and Taunton, which was established on 1 April 2019. It was previously in the district of West Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, and part of Dulverton Rural District before that. The district council was responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism.

Somerset Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and  fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning.

As Withypool falls within the Exmoor National Park some functions normally administered by district or county councils have, since 1997, fallen under the Exmoor National Park Authority, which is known as a ‘single purpose’ authority, which aims to "conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the National Parks" and "promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of the special qualities of the Parks by the public", including responsibility for the conservation of the historic environment.

It is also part of the Bridgwater and West Somerset county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election.

Landmarks

The Royal Oak Inn
The village's Royal Oak Inn has seen its share of history since its construction in the late 17th century.  R. D. Blackmore wrote part of Lorna Doone in the bar, and artist Alfred Munnings had a studio in the loft.  In the 1930s, the inn was owned by Gwladys and Maxwell Knight, a spy-ring leader and radio broadcaster upon whom Ian Fleming based the character of James Bond's boss, M.  During World War II, the nearby Woolacombe beach was used to simulate the invasion of Normandy, and General Dwight Eisenhower planned some of the operation from the Royal Oak.

Religious sites
The late medieval Church of St Andrew is a Grade II* listed building. The tower was rebuilt in the early 17th century, restored and refitted in 1887, and restored extensively and rebuilt again in 1902.

The Norman Church of St Giles in Hawkridge has 14th-century origins.
