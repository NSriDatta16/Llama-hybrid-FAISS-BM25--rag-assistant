Company history
Music World was incorporated on January 8, 1958 in the state of California.  Within its first year, the company became the first music publisher to cobrand with Wonderland Music Company, Walt Disney Company's then fledgling BMI music publishing subsidiary.  Some of Music World's hit song titles include:  "Tall Paul", "Bright and Shiny" the Billboard #1 song, "You're Sixteen".  "Tall Paul" reached #6 on the Billboard charts in 1959 making it the first top ten single for a solo female rock and roll singer.

In 2000 the company branched into corporate "jingle" publishing, writing and production.  Clientele includes Time Warner, Disney, Aero California and others.

Upon the death of founder, Robert B. Sherman on March 6, 2012, his son, Robert J. Sherman succeeded him as CEO and President of the company.
