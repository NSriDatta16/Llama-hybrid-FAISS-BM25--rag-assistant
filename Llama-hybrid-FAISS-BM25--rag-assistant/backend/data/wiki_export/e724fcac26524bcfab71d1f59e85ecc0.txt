"Girlfriend" is a song by British rock band The Darkness, released as the third and final single from their second studio album, One Way Ticket to Hell... And Back. Released on 22 May 2006, it was the band's last single before their five-year disbandment later that year. The song is written from the perspective of a man who has cheated on his girlfriend with another woman. He tells his now angry girlfriend in the first verse that the other girl meant nothing to him. In the second verse he admits that the relationship is over and his once girlfriend is now his ex. The music video for the song is inspired by the film Flashdance. The song charted at number 39 on the UK Singles Chart. This was the band's lowest charting single since 2003 single "Get Your Hands off My Woman".
