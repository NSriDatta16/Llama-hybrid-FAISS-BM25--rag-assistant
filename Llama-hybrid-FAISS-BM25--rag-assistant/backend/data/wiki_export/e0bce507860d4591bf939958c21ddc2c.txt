Delon Anthony Armitage (born 15 December 1983) is a rugby union coach and former player who played at wing or fullback for Lyon OU and is capped for England. He also occasionally played centre. Armitage started out at London Irish and Toulon. He sometimes did place kicking, mainly from a distance or if the regular kicker was unable to take it. He left Toulon at the end of the 2015/2016 season to join French Top 14 side Lyon. He retired at the end of the 2018/2019 season.

Early career
From 1996 to 2002, Armitage lived in Roquefort-les-Pins on the French Riviera and from the age of 12 Armitage began playing for Rugby Nice Côte d'Azur Université-Racing. Armitage was rejected by the France Under-16s, who claimed he was too tall and skinny. On his return to London, Armitage joined Richmond before joining London Irish. Armitage joined the Academy in 2002, where he played for the England U19's and was involved in the team that won the U19's National Cup (02-03). From there he progressed to the U21 squad. His talent was recognised and Armitage played for England in the IRB World Sevens tournament 2005. In August 2009 he took part in the Middlesex Sevens tournament in Twickenham where he helped London Irish to victory over Samerai International to take the championship.
In May 2013 he scored Toulon's only try of the match as they won the 2013 Heineken Cup Final by 16-15 against Clermont Auvergne.

England career 

On 8 November 2008 Armitage made his full England debut against the Pacific Islanders at fullback following injuries to Mathew Tait and Nick Abendanon. He put in a man of the match winning performance setting up a try for winger Paul Sackey. English Rugby legend and team manager Martin Johnson described Armitage's debut performance as outstanding. Armitage was one of the few England players to warrant any praise during the 2008 Autumn Internationals in which England lost three out of their four matches. Armitage scored his first international points with a 45-meter drop goal against Australia.

On 3 February 2009, Armitage and his brother, Steffon Armitage, were both named in England's starting XV to take on Italy in the opening game of the 2009 Six Nations. The ninth pair and the first time since Rory Underwood and Tony Underwood stepped onto the field together in 1995 that two brothers have played in the same England team.

In the next match, in the 2009 Six Nations Championship he scored his first try against Wales at the Millennium Stadium. He also scored a penalty and a try in England's 14–13 loss against Ireland at Croke Park. Armitage scored his third England try in as many games when he touched down against France at Twickenham, in a match England went on to win 34–10. He celebrated his try by kissing the England badge on his shirt, quite possibly to highlight his snub by the France Under-16s.

He played in England's two test matches against Argentina, scoring two tries in the first test.

International Tries

Coaching career
In July 2020 it was confirmed that Armitage had returned to England to become backs coach at National League 1 side Chinnor

Personal life 

Armitage's stepfather John played rugby for Hatfield and encouraged his sons to such an extent that four of them are now professional players. Guy plays for Wasps RFC while Steffon plays for Section Paloise. Bevon left RFU Championship club Doncaster Knights in 2010 for his brothers' youth club Rugby Nice Côte d'Azur Université-Racing; however, he returned to Doncaster from the 2013-14 season.
Armitage was the first native West Indian to play rugby union for England.
He has two children with Jemma, whom he married in May 2012, a son Cameron (born 2007) and a daughter Chloe (born May 2009). He is a Queens Park Rangers fan.
