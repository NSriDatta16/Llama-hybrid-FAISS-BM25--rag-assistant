Radio stations 

Radio Humsafar owns Laval, Quebec-based radio station CJLV 1570 AM; that station carries a French-language full-service format, including oldies music, talk programs and news updates throughout the day.

On March 16, 2011, Radio Humsafar would pursue a second radio station in the Montreal area when it applied with the CRTC to operate a terrestrial ethnic radio station in Montreal, which would have operated at 1400 kHz with a universal transmitter power of 1,000 watts. On May 10, 2011, the application was withdrawn, for unknown reasons.   Radio Humsafar would reapply again, this time at 1610 kHz, also broadcasting at 1,000 watts at all times; this application was approved by the CRTC on May 16, 2014. This station, whose call letters will be CHRN, will serve as a flagship for the Radio Humsafar network.

On October 21, 2015, Radio Humsafar received a license for a new radio station in the Toronto suburb of Brampton, Ontario, CIRF, which will broadcast on 1350 kHz.
