History

On September 8, 2011 the bridge at the eastern end of the highway over Loyalsock Creek (known as the Slabtown Bridge) was destroyed by flooding. Heavy rain from the remnants of Tropical Storm Lee raised the creek "higher than anything we've seen in recorded history", according to a Lycoming County official. The western portion of the bridge collapsed. A replacement bridge was completed in November 2012 at a cost of $3 million.
