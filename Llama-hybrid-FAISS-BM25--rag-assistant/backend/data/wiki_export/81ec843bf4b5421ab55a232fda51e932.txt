James Corsi (born June 19, 1954) is a Canadian-Italian former professional ice hockey goaltender and the current goaltending coach for the Columbus Blue Jackets. He was previously the goaltender coach of the St. Louis Blues and the Buffalo Sabres. Before beginning his hockey career, Corsi also played soccer at the professional level as a forward in the North American Soccer League for the Montreal Olympique. The following season he played in the National Soccer League with the Quebec Selects.

Playing career
Corsi played in the World Hockey Association for the Quebec Nordiques and the National Hockey League for the Edmonton Oilers. He has dual Italian and Canadian citizenship. He became the goaltender of the nazionale (Italian national ice hockey team) and spent the majority of his career with Varese. He also played for HC Gherdëina, SG Cortina and HC Bolzano during his time in Italy's Serie A league. Corsi played on the Italian team at the 1982 World Championship that stunned a Team Canada that had Wayne Gretzky on it by tying Canada 3-3 and went on to beat the US at the same tournament relegating them to the B-Pool for 1983.

Post-playing career
Corsi is also known as being the namesake for the development of the Corsi rating. This indicator is essentially a plus-minus statistic that measures shot attempts (usually only counting those at even strength). A player receives a plus for any shot attempt (on net, missed, or blocked) that his team directs at 
the opponent's net, and a minus for any shot attempt against his own net. This indicator is widely used in most NHL teams as it has shown a strong correlation to player and team success. The person credited with popularizing the statistic, Vic Ferrari, attributed the stat to then-Sabres general manager Darcy Regier, but named it after Corsi because he thought Corsi's name had a better ring to it (he was inadvertently correct since Corsi did create the statistic). Corsi himself has stated he is flattered to be associated with the statistic.

He was relieved of his duties with the St. Louis Blues on February 1, 2017.
