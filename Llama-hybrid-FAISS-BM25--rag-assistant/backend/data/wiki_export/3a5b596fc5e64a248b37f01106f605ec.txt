Doc McGhee (born September 5, 1950) is an American music manager, best known for working with hard rock bands Kiss, Bon Jovi and Mötley Crüe. The latter two groups experienced their rise to stardom under his management. He has also worked with Hootie & the Blowfish.

He was in a reality series for VH1 called Supergroup along with Scott Ian, Ted Nugent, Evan Seinfeld, Sebastian Bach and Jason Bonham.  He was also seen on the AMC reality series 4th and Loud, which chronicled his, Gene Simmons', and Paul Stanley's roles as owners of the Los Angeles Kiss Arena Football League team.

Moscow Music Peace Festival 
In 1989 McGhee joined with Russian musician and promotor Stas Namin to create the Moscow Music Peace Festival which brought together hard rock and metal bands from the United States, Europe and Russia to benefit programs to help drug addicts. Over 100,000 people attended and it was broadcast in 59 countries. The concert inspired one of the bands, the McGhee-managed Scorpions, to write the top-selling song Wind of Change. McGhee's life and involvement in the Festival is featured in episodes 5 and 6 of the podcast Wind of Change.

Drug smuggling conviction
In November 1982, McGhee was arrested for contributing to the import of 20 tons of marijuana into North Carolina via shrimp boat. The 21-count indictment said that McGhee and the smugglers had the intent to distribute the marijuana. McGhee would have to serve 30 years in jail and be fined $140,000, but the possession-with-intent-to-sell charge was changed. Identified as a link between US smugglers and the Colombian drug suppliers, McGhee pleaded guilty and was ordered to spend $250,000 and 3,000 hours dedicated to his Make a Difference Foundation, a non-profit aimed at deterring youth drug use. After the sentence, neither McGhee nor his office would comment on the sentencing.
