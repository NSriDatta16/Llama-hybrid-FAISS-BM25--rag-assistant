New York's 2nd congressional district is a congressional district for the United States House of Representatives along the South Shore of Long Island, New York. It includes southwestern Suffolk County and a small portion of southeastern Nassau County. The district is currently represented by Republican Andrew Garbarino. 

From 2003 to 2013 it included all of the town of Huntington and parts of the towns of Babylon, Islip and Smithtown in Suffolk County as well as part of the town of Oyster Bay in Nassau County. It comprised such communities as Bay Shore, Brentwood, Central Islip, Commack, Deer Park, Dix Hills, Huntington, Melville, North Amityville, Northport, Oakdale, Plainview, Ronkonkoma, Sayville and Wyandanch.  Much of this area is now the 3rd congressional district, while most of the territory currently in the 2nd district was located in the 3rd district.

According to the APM Research Lab's Voter Profile Tools (featuring the U.S. Census Bureau's 2019 American Community Survey), the district contained about 512,000 potential voters (citizens, age 18+). Of these, 68% are White, 17% Latino, and 10% Black. Immigrants make up 15% of the district's potential voters. The median income among households (with one or more potential voter) in the district is about $109,400. As for the educational attainment of potential voters in the district, 32% hold a bachelor's or higher degree.

List of members representing the district

1789–1805: one seat

1805–1809: two seats on general ticket with 3rd district 

Gurdon S. Mumford is usually listed as member from the 2nd district, and George Clinton Jr. from the 3rd district, because Clinton was elected to fill the vacancy caused by the election of Mitchill to the U.S. Senate, and Mitchill had been elected previously in the 3rd district. However, in 1804 Mitchill was already re-elected on the 2nd/3rd general ticket, and both Clinton and Mumford were elected in special elections, receiving votes in both districts.

The districts were separated in 1809.

1809–1823: two seats
From 1809 to 1823, two seats were apportioned to the second district, elected at-large on a general ticket.

1823–present: one seat
