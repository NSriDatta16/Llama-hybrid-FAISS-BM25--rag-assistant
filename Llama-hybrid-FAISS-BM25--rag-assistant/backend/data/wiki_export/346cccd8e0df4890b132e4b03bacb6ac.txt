Stadium

The venue name, Champions of 1936, is misleading. No Peruvian League was actually played in 1936 as the national team was preparing itself to compete in the 1936 Summer Olympics in Germany. Two main theories as of the origin of the name exist. The first is that Alianza Atlético won a special national tournament (representing their home state, Piura) governed by the Peruvian Football Federation, and the name stuck despite not being recognized officially as national champions thereafter. The second is that it was named as such for the heroic campaign of the Peru national football team at the 1936 Olympic football tournament over the controversial Peru vs. Austria quarterfinals match.

Estadio Campeones del 36 is currently undergoing renovations. Estadio Melanio Coloma which is found at the opposite end of the city of Sullana is the club's current stadium for matches during the 2017 season.
