Road Trip is the soundtrack to the comedy film, Road Trip.

Album information 
The main title music for the movie, "The University of Ithaca Alma Mater", was not included in the soundtrack album. It was composed by Gordon Henderson, director of the UCLA Bruin Marching Band, and it was recorded by 30 members of the UCLA Band late one night in the UCLA Band Room. For legal reasons, the UCLA name could not be used in the film's credits, so "Gordon Henderson and his Midnight Music Makers" is listed in the closing credits.
