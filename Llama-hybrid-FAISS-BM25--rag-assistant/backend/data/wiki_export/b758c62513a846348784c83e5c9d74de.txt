Political activity 

In December 2005, Kazulin registered registered his candidacy for 2006 presidential election. His election campaign was the most censored of all candidates, and Lukashenko marked Kazulin as his main personal enemy.

Several weeks before the 2006 presidential election, on 2 March 2006, Kazulin was beaten and detained by police after attempting to enter the All Belarusian People's Assembly. Witnesses testified that police fired into the air to stop a car carrying journalists and members of Kazulin's election team. Kazulin was charged with disorderly conduct and released after being held in custody for eight hours.

During the events following the 19 March 2006 presidential election, on 25 March, Kazulin was present in a confrontation between demonstrators and police. Reportedly he walked to the commanding officer with flowers in his hand, and police knocked him off his feet, beat him up, and then detained him. In a post-election interview Kazulin said, "We're not afraid of tanks and violence; we're afraid of prisons and having no freedom. We're tired of living in a spiritual prison."

On 13 July 2006, Kazulin was sentenced to jail for five and a half years at a court in Minsk. He was convicted for his role in the March protests with the official charge being of hooliganism and incitement to mass disorder during the events of 25 March. Amnesty International recognized him as a prisoner of conscience.

On 26 February 2008, he was allowed to attend his wife's funeral, after threatening to go on hunger strike and with significant pressure from EU and US officials onto Belarusian government.

On March 7, 2008, the US announced sanctions against all state enterprises of the petrochemical complex of Belarus. As David Kramer openly stated, the reason was "the unwillingness of the Belarusian government to release Alexander Kozulin". On 16 August 2008, Kazulin was released from prison.

Since 2008, Kazulin has refused any offers to return to politics.
