Edson Rolando Silva Sousa (born 9 March 1983 in São Vicente, Cape Verde)
is a Portuguese football manager and former player. He is the head coach of Falcões do Norte in Cape Verde. He played as a forward.

Edson Silva signed for Tottenham from PSV Eindhoven shortly before the 2004/05 season got underway. Tottenham's Sporting Director Frank Arnesen had signed him for PSV after spotting him playing for Portugal's youth teams. The attacking midfielder signed a one-year deal with an option to extend that at the end of the season.

Unfortunately, he did not reach the first team but was named on the bench for a number of Premier League games.  He left Spurs in January 2005 to join Den Haag. After scoring 3 goals for Den Haag, Egyptian side Zamalek signed him.

In the beginning of 2007 he was signed by Romanian Liga I side UTA Arad. After the 2008 season and relegation with UTA, he then left Romania and trained with Finnish Veikkausliiga club TPS Turku. Afterwards, he returned to Romania and signed a contract with Ceahlăul Piatra Neamț.
