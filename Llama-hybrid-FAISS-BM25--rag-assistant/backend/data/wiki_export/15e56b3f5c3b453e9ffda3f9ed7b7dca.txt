"Bla Bla Bla" is a song written and recorded by Italian DJ Gigi D'Agostino. It was released in May 1999 as the third single from the album L'Amour Toujours. It reached number 3 in Austria and number 15 in France.

This song is made with a sample from the British band Stretch's song "Why did you do it". The beginning of the second complete: "I've been thinking about what..." is used to create the vocal loop of the track.

Music video
The song also featured a popular music video, which was directed by Andreas Hykade and Ged Haney at Studio Film Bilder GmbH, in the style of Italian animated series La Linea. The music video shows a boy with a floating head and no arms walking toward what appears to be a shark that multiplies itself and can change direction. This style was also used in "The Riddle", another song by Gigi D'Agostino, originally by British singer Nik Kershaw.
