Eggen listed it as a probable member of the Hyades group.

The stellar classification of HD 110458 is K0III, which indicates this is an aging giant star that has exhausted the supply of hydrogen at its core. It is estimated to be 2.6 billion years old with 1.7 times the mass of the Sun and has expanded to 11.6 times the girth of the Sun.
