Live Phish 04.03.98 is the second night of the four-night "Island Tour", recorded live at the Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, New York, on April 3, 1998.

The short mini-run quickly became one of the most popular Phish performances of all time, with the band mixing the funk of 1997 with the high-energy jams of the mid-1990s along with brand new compositions.

The second and final night of shows in New York is highlighted by a large-scale jam following Ween's "Roses are Free", rated by Phish fans as one of the group's greatest jams of all time. Other highlights include a fan running onstage during "Loving Cup" and being tackled by stage manager Pete Carini, all of which is reported during "Run Like an Antelope" by guitarist Trey Anastasio, who then rightfully begins the encore with a version of "Carini".

Bonus tracks include various soundcheck excerpts from the "Island Tour"

In addition to being a CD release, this concert is available as a download in FLAC and MP3 formats at LivePhish.com.
