Legacy of Brutality is a compilation album of early songs by the American punk rock band Misfits, released in September 1985. It contains overdubbed mixes of previously unreleased songs, mainly from the January–February 1978 Static Age sessions. Besides The Misfits box set, this is the only official album containing the songs "Who Killed Marilyn?" and "American Nightmare".

This compilation was the first (aside from bootlegs) to release many of the then-unreleased Static Age songs to the public. Glenn Danzig, the songwriter, mixed and produced it, overdubbing new instrumentation.
