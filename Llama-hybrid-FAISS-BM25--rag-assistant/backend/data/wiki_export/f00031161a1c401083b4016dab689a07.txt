Plot
Somewhere in Japan, a bright light suddenly blasted from the ground. The light in a blink destroyed everything within a hundred-mile radius. People argued that falling space debris caused it, but  others felt that the unusual movement of terrestrial magnetism caused the light. The truth, however, remained hidden and blurred from people's memories. A little girl named Miya is the only one that knows what the light is.

Ten years later, an army of giant robots suddenly appear and devastates the Earth. They call themselves "EX Tartaro," whom pilot four major robots - the Four Kyokuohand. Their mission is to "purify the world". Three battle robots, the Dangaioh, defeated the enemy with ease. Sensing the strength of their enemy, the Ex Tartao united to form one giant robot. The three members of the Dangaioh team united into Dangaioh to reveal their true powers and eventually destroyed the invading force. The plot was devised by madman Dr. Katou, who was once the co-planner of the Dangaioh. The Dangai Project began preparations for a battle from a threat from the outer space pirate "Bunker". Dr. Katou and Yonamine had a big dispute, leading to Dr. Katou's betrayal. Now, in a secret underground organization, Dr. Yonamine and the Dangaioh are prepared to face off against Dr. Katou and his robotic troops.

The Exception are easily tracked by espers such as Miya.

Mechanics
Dangaioh was created by Gunji Yonamine and Dr. Miya Shikitani. It is formed by 3 separate robots codenamed Dangai-numbers; the Dangaioh B, Dangaioh F, and Dangaioh X.

Dangaioh B (Burst)
 Dangaioh B is piloted by Kuya Amagi. Because this unit places the most stress upon a pilot, it was given to Kuya, who was seen as physically strong enough to handle the unit. Burst forms the head and chest of Dangaioh when merged and gives the pilot of Dangaioh Burst primary control of Dangaioh itself. Alone, it primarily uses an automatic rifle with sniper-like range.

Dangaioh F (Flail)
 Dangaioh F is piloted by Manami Mishio. Not built for physical combat, Flail's role is electronic warfare, jamming, analysis, and recon. When merged into Dangaioh, Flail forms the body. In combat, its primary weapon is a cloud of electronic beacons that disrupts enemy functions. Dangaioh F is also the most fragile of the three.

Dangaioh X (Cross)
 The Dangaioh X is piloted by Hitomi Chidou. Of the three Dangai Numbers, Cross has the heaviest armor and highest power output, due to the fact it houses the main engine for the merged Dangaioh, of which it forms the legs. In battle, X excels mainly on close combat, using kicks and punches that are augmented by Dangaioh's engine. It is equipped with a single edge combat knife stored in the left wrist and a grappling hook launcher in the right wrist; at one point it was equipped with a pair of sais.

Dangaioh
When all three Dangai-numbers are put together, they form Dangaioh. Dangaioh excels at fighting opponents accordingly using high-speed maneuvers and its powerful weapons. However, its overall strengths cannot fully function in an underwater environment. The battle abilities of the Dangaioh require high human tolerances. The pilots of the Dangaioh are subject to constant physical stress, even the possibility of death if they stay in their units for too long. Therefore, the Dangaioh requires its pilots to be physically and psychologically strong and have excellent teamwork abilities.

With various weapons equipped, this makes Dangaioh have various attacks to help defeat its enemies:
Burning Gloves: Dangaioh's forearms are fired out with high-powered rockets and still be controlled to grab or subdue the opponent.
Burning Pressure (Pressure Burning Glove): Extra boosters on the rocketing forearms are fired to increase speed and power.
Flame Arrow: A blue stream of energy is fired from a particle beam cannon mounted on the chest.
Dangai Blade: A pair of blue beam sabers are released from the upper arm slots where the forearm used to be.
Cross Tornado: With a pair of high-powered boosters fired on each side of the body, Dangaioh spins at high speeds while holding the Dangai Blades high. Then launches itself towards the opponent either punching a hole through or slice them in half. This attack it often performed while having the Burning Gloves holding the enemy in place.
Stream Blaster: The newest and most powerful weapon equipped onto Dangaioh. The red chest plate would fire a wave of red energy that would obliterate everything in its path including enemies as strong as Bucharu. However, its power was too much for the pilots to handle that it risks their safety and takes a long time to charge.
Acid Resistant Armor: As demonstrated against its battle with Timur, Dangaioh's armor is thick enough to withstand highly acidic attacks.

Dangaioh Ur
A prototype of Dangaioh more closely related to the Dangaioh from the original OVA. After a freak accident during a test run, Dr. Kadou used the brain cells of the pilot, allowing it to run indefinitely before the doctor was expelled. Somehow awakening after the arrival of the Exception, Dangaioh Ur revealed itself to the Dangaioh team to destroy it in the final three episodes. Due to Ur's AI, it cannot stop fighting and therefore will continually deteriorate until it ceases to function.

God's Wings: Retractable wings that allows it to fly at super sonic speeds and encase itself in flames.
Distortion Punch: Launching its arms against enemies with more force than the Burning Gloves.
Dan Flame: A flamethrower in the mouth.
Hyper Laser: A laser concentrated from the panels on its shoulders and thighs.
Zero Excalibur: A large katana stored into a dimensional pocket until Ur summons it.
Dangai Beam: An energy beam similar to the Flame Arrow fired from the forehead and eyes.
Gaioh Cutter Boomerangs: A pair of sharp boomerangs.
Armed Missiles: Homing missiles from the left knee.
Counter Chain: A restraining chain from the right wrist.
Distortion Phaser: Energy balls spawned and thrown with tremendous force.
God's Tornado: An attack similar to the Cross Tornado used when God's Wings are extended.

Episodes

The series was originally intended to be 26 episodes long, but was cancelled halfway due to poor reviews and low ratings. This prompted creator Toshiki Hirano to state at an anime event that "Any series called Dangaioh seems destined to not be completed", as the original Dangaioh OVA series was also left unfinished. Though this series did seem to try and resolve the cliffhanger of the OVA by including at least one character from it in this series.
