The Sony Vaio UX Micro PC is an  Ultra-Mobile Portable Computer (UMPC) first marketed in 2006. It weighs around 490–544 g (1.20–1.27 lb), and has a slide-out QWERTY keyboard, touchscreen, Intel Core 2 Solo processor, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and WWAN. Though not officially stated as such, and even to a point implied by Sony that the UX is a move in a new direction and not a specific continuation of such, the Sony UX is speculated by some to be the newest model in the popular Sony U-series. 

NOTE : Japanese models include 533 MHz memory and so do the minority markets ( Europe, Australia etc. ) models. The US ones do not have 533 MHz but slower 400 MHz.

All models share these features:
 4.5" XBrite TFT LCD touchscreen with 1024x600 display resolution.
