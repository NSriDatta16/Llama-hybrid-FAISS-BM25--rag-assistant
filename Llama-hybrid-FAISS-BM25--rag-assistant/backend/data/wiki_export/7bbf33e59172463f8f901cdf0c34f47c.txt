The Abidin Mosque () is Terengganu's old state royal mosque built by Sultan Zainal Abidin II between 1793 and 1808. The mosque, which is also known as the White Mosque or the Big Mosque, is located in Kuala Terengganu, Terengganu, Malaysia. The old Royal Mausoleum is situated near the mosque.

History
This mosque was built by the late Sultan Zainal Abidin II (also known as Marhum Masjid) between 1793 until 1808. The original building material of the mosque was wood, but during the reign of Sultan Umar at around 1852, the mosque was replaced with one made out of bricks. In 1881, Sultan Ahmad II ibni Yang Dipertua Muda Tengku Mahmud constructed a new dome to replace the old one erected under Sultan Zainal Abidin II. A ceremony was conducted at 7.00am, Saturday, 1 Jumada al-Thani 1298AH (1881AD). In 1901 during the reign of Sultan Zainal Abidin III, the mosque went through another renovation. The mosque was enlarged to accommodate the growing number of people. Besides that, circular stone pillars were also erected, while three minarets were built.

The mosque is again renovated during the reign of Al-Sultan Ismail Nasiruddin Shah in 1972. The size of the mosque was now twice the size of the original building. A tall minaret and new domes were constructed. Decorations such as several calligraphic carvings of verses from the Quran, prayers and arabesques were carved on the mosque’s entrance doors and grills. The current uniquely carved mimbar was crafted by Mister Abdul Kadir.
