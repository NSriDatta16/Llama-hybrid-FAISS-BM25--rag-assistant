Om Prakash Chibber (19 December 1919 â€“ 21 February 1998) was an Indian film actor. He was born in Jammu and was a well known character actor of Hindi Cinema. His most well-known movies are Gopi (1970), Hulchul (1971), Namak Halaal (1982), and Sharaabi (1984).

He also produced Jahanaara, starring Bharat Bhushan, Shashikala, Prithviraj Kapoor, and Mala Sinha, playing the title role.

Prakash played major characters in films including Dus Lakh, Annadata, Charandas, and Sadhu aur Shaitan. His pivotal roles in the films Dil Daulat Duniya, Gopi, Apna Desh, Chupke Chupke, Julie, Joroo Ka Ghulam, Aa Gale Lag Jaa, Pyar Kiye Jaa, Padosan, and Buddha Mil Gaya are considered to be among his best, along with Daddu in Namak Halaal and De Silva in Zanjeer. His roles in Sharaabi, Bharosa, Tere Ghar Ke Samne, Mere Hamdam Mere Dost, Loafer and Dil Tera Diwana were also appreciated.

Prakash has played in many comedy films. One of his best performances were in Naukar Biwi Ka (1983), Sharaabi (1984) and Chameli Ki Shaadi, where he played a pivotal role. His role in Gopi with Dilip Kumar is considered best in terms of acting. Critics still think he gave better performance in tragic scenes in front of Dilip Kumar. Once Dilip Kumar revealed the fact, "I was only afraid once in my acting career and it was during Gopi when Om Prakashji's performance overshadowed mine".

Early life and education

Prakash was fascinated by theatre, music and films. He started taking lessons in classical music when he was twelve years old.

Career

Prakash joined All India Radio in 1937 on a monthly salary of Rs 25. He was known as "Fateh Din", a radio personality, and his programmes made him popular across Punjab.

He was regaling people at a wedding one day when filmmaker Dalsukh Pancholi asked to see him in his Lahore office. Pancholi gave Prakash his first break as an actor in the film Daasi. He was paid only Rs 80, but the film earned him fame. It was his first major role; he had played a bit role in Sharif Badmash, a silent film. He later played in Daasi and with Pancholi's Dhamki and Aayee Bahar.

Soon after the Partition, he came to Delhi and then to Bombay (now Mumbai). Baldev Raj Chopra noticed his talent when he was a film journalist and critic; he urged Prakash to carry on with his acting career. He was sure Om Prakash had the talent to prove himself a versatile actor, later winning acclaim and later had roles in films including Lahore, Char Din, and Raat Ki Rani. It was during this phase in his career that he played in Azaad with Dilip Kumar, Mera Naam Joker with Raj Kapoor; Miss Mary, Bahar, Pehli Jhalak, Asha, and Man-Mauji with Kishore Kumar; followed by Howrah Bridge with Ashok Kumar; and then Tere Ghar Ke Samne with Dev Anand. He was noted for his performance in both films in spite of celebrities like Kishore Kumar, Dilip Kumar, Raj Kapoor, Ashok Kumar and Dev Anand. He had developed his own style, which prompted him to work in the entertainment industry for the next forty years.

Om Prakash acted in 307 films. He won his first major award acting in Dus Lakh (1966). He has also played inHowrah Bridge (1958), Pyar Kiye Jaa (1966), Padosan (1968), Sadhu Aur Shaitaan (1968), Dil Daulat Duniya (1972), Chupke Chupke (1975), Gol Maal (1979), Namak Halaal (1982), and Chameli Ki Shaadi (1986). He proved that he could play mature roles with equal ease and depth, as shown in Chacha Zindabad, Khandan, Haryali Aur Raasta, Dil Apna Aur Preet Parai, Pati Patni, Neend Hamari Khwab Tumhare, Mere Hamdam Mere Dost, Annadata, Ek Shriman Ek Shrimati, Doli, Chirag, Amar Prem, Aankh Micholi, Ek Hasina Do Diwane, Anuraag, Zanjeer, Sagina, Aa Gale Lag Jaa, Loafer, Roti, Julie, Khushboo, Lawaaris, Bandish, Sharaabi and Chameli Ki Shaadi.

Outside of acting, Prakash produced films including Sanjog (1961), Jahan Ara (1964) and Gateway of India (1957).

Death

Om Prakash suffered a massive heart attack in his home and was rushed to Lilavati Hospital in Mumbai. In there, Prakash suffered another heart attack and went into a coma from which he never recovered. He died on 21 February 1998.
