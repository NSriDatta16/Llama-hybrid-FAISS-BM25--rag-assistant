Under Age is a 1964 black-and-white film written and directed by Larry Buchanan and starring Annabelle Weenick, Judy Adler and Roland Royter. The film was shot in Dallas, Texas.

Plot
A woman from Dallas goes on trial, charged with encouraging her 14-year-old daughter to have sex with a 16-year-old Mexican boy.

Production 
Under Age was produced by American International Pictures (AIP). Following the success of Buchanan's previous courtroom drama Free, White and 21, AIP co-founder Samuel Z. Arkoff encouraged the filmmakers to create a similar film specifically targeted at young people. The plot was based on a real-life court case in which a woman, Wanda Duckworth, was found guilty of rape and jailed for encouraging her 15-year-old daughter to have sex with a 17-year-old male. A number of actors from Free, White and 21 returned for this film, playing the same characters.

Reception 
Under Age was given a minor release by AIP. When the film did poorly in theaters, Buchanan said he would never again do a "courtroom picture," though due to current events he soon made The Trial of Lee Harvey Oswald.
