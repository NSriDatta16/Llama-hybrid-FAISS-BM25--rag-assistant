"Amsterdam" is a song by Jacques Brel.  It combines a powerful melancholic crescendo with a rich poetic account of the exploits of sailors on shore leave in Amsterdam. Musically, it takes its base melody line from the melody of the English folk song Greensleeves.

Brel never recorded this for a studio album, and his only version was released on the live album Olympia 1964.  Despite this, it has been one of his most enduringly popular works.  It was one of the songs Mort Shuman translated into English for the musical Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and Living in Paris.

Brel worked on the song at his house overlooking the Mediterranean at Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, the house he shared with Sylvie Rivet, a publicist for Philips; a place she had introduced him to in 1960. "It was the ideal place for him to create, and to indulge his passion for boats and planes. One morning at six o'clock he read the words of Amsterdam to Fernand, a restaurateur who was about to set off fishing for scorpion fish and conger eels for the bouillabaisse. Overcome, Fernand broke out in sobs and cut open some sea urchins to help control his emotion."

Originally the song was situated in Zeebrugge, but moved to Amsterdam as "it sounded better to the ear".

Cover versions

David Bowie version
Scott Walker recorded several of these translated Brel songs in the late 1960s. This inspired David Bowie to record his own versions of "Amsterdam" in the early 1970s. Bowie's studio version was released as the B-side to his single "Sorrow", released in September 1973. (This recording may have been made in the summer of 1973 or in late 1971.)  Brel refused to meet Bowie when he visited Paris, saying he did not wish to meet a "pédé" ("faggot"), but the latter nevertheless still admired him.

Bowie's version is also found on several other releases:
 The original mix, as heard on the 1973 single B-side, was included on the RCA Records compilation album Rare, in December 1982, and on Re:Call 1, part of the Five Years (1969–1973) compilation, in September 2015.
 Bowie's recording was released as picture discs in both the RCA Life Time picture disc set and the Fashion Picture Disc Set.
 A remix was included as a bonus track on the 1990 Rykodisc CD release of Bowie's 1973 album Pin Ups under the title "Port of Amsterdam", and on the bonus disc of the 2002 Ziggy Stardust - 30th Anniversary Reissue. 
 The July 1982 German rerelease of the single "Alabama Song" had "Amsterdam" as the B-side.
 On the 1989 Living Legend Records Publishing CD Chameleon Chronicles Vol.3 (LLRCD 050) "Amsterdam" was recorded for D.L.T. (Dave Lee Travis Show) as "David Bowie and Junior's Eyes" 20 October 1969; broadcast date 26 October 1969.
