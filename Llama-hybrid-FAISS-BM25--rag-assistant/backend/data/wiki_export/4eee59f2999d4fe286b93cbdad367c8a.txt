Dagmar Hase (born 22 December 1969 in Quedlinburg, Saxony-Anhalt, East Germany) is a former German swimmer, specialised in the freestyle and backstroke. She won seven Olympic medals in her career, including a gold medal in the 400Â m freestyle at the 1992 Summer Olympics.

Her defeat of American swimmer Janet Evans in the 400 metre freestyle at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics was Evans's only loss in a 400 or 800 metre freestyle between 1986 and 1994.   She also defeated the greatest backstroker ever, Hungary's Krisztina Egerszegi, in her strongest event the 200 metre backstroke at the 1989 European Aquatics Championships.  This was Egerszegi's only defeat in a 200-metre backstroke from 1987 to her retirement in 1996, and her only defeat in any backstroke event from 1989 to 1994.   Hase was a highly versatile swimmer, having won at least 1 Olympic and numerous other major event medals in each of the 200 freestyle, 400 freestyle, 800 freestyle, and 200 backstroke.
