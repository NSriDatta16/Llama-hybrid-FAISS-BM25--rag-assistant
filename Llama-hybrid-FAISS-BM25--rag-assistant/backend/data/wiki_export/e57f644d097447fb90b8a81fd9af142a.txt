Lincoln Minster School (Known locally as "LMS" or "The Minster") is an independent co-educational day and boarding school in Lincoln, England.

It comprises three schools: the pre-preparatory, preparatory, and senior school. While the school is now open to pupils from the community it continues to educate a small number of the choristers of Lincoln Cathedral, though the formal association with the cathedral was ended by Lincoln Minster School in 2016 and most choristers are now drawn from other local schools. It is a member of the United Church Schools Trust and the Choir Schools' Association.

History
In 1265 Richard of Gravesend, Bishop of Lincoln, decreed that there should be twelve boys, two of whom were to be incense bearers, living in one house under a master who appropriated certain revenues for their support. They were to be taught lessons in their house in addition to their choral duties. Even before the Bishop's ordinance, boys were known to have been taught music in the Cathedral Close.

Lincoln Minster School was formed in 1996 with the amalgamation of four schools:

The Cathedral School for the choristers (girls and boys) of Lincoln Minster
St Joseph's School for Girls, a day and boarding school
Stonefield House School which taught children up to the age of 16

In 2011 St Mary's Preparatory School merged with the school to become its preparatory department.

Music
Pupils are encouraged to be involved in music. There are opportunities to perform in school concerts or lead worship services. Many are selected for the National Youth Choirs of Great Britain, National Children's Orchestra and other groups.

Boarding
Across all the schools there are four boarding houses:
Hillside (Senior boys)
Lindum View (Junior boys)
Eastgate (Senior Girls)
James Street (Junior boys and girls)
