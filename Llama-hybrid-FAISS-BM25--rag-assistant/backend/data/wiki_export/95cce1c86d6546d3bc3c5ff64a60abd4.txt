Muddy Water Blues: A Tribute to Muddy Waters is the second solo album by Paul Rodgers (of Free and Bad Company fame), consisting predominantly of covers of songs made famous by blues artist Muddy Waters. Although attributed solely to Rodgers, the album features many guest musicians including Jeff Beck, Jason Bonham, David Gilmour, Buddy Guy, Brian May, Steve Miller, Gary Moore, Trevor Rabin, Richie Sambora, Neal Schon, Brian Setzer and Slash. It was released in 1993.

Among the tracks covered on the album is the Albert King song "The Hunter", which Rodgers had previously recorded with Free on their debut album Tons of Sobs. As well as the standard one-disc edition, a limited edition version was also released featuring a bonus disc of re-recordings of Free and Bad Company hits.
