Brain Game is a weekly quiz bowl-type show for high school students that airs on NBC affiliate WRAL-TV in Raleigh, North Carolina. The program debuted January 11, 1997, when WRAL-TV was a CBS affiliate. It currently airs at 11 a.m. on Saturdays, and the current host is former WRAL traffic reporter Mark Roberts. Early programs were hosted by WRAL weathercaster Greg Fishel.

Rules
Each Brain Game show is contested by three teams of three players each.  Teams may buzz in and attempt to answer at any time while the question is being read.  Team members may confer with one another prior to answering.  Academic-based questions in the games come from the standard North Carolina curriculum for ninth and tenth graders.

Prior to fall 2008, the teams with the nine best scores advanced to a playoff of three semifinal games, with the winners advancing to a championship game. Teams could advance to the semifinals without winning their regular season games - only the score accumulated during the regular season game determined the playoff teams.

In the fall of 2008, the rules were changed so that the winners of each game would automatically advance to the playoffs. The best non-winning high score qualified a team as a "wild card" in the playoffs.

The format used in Brain Game differs from other quiz bowl formats in some ways:
Brain Game allows three players to compete at a time, other formats permit four players
Regardless of who buzzes in on a team, anyone on the team may answer the question
Three teams compete at a time, other formats have two teams compete at a time
Brain game includes audio or visual clues via monitors visible to contestants

Starting in 2009, regular-season matches were played with three teams competing. The top 6 teams advance to the playoffs, which have two teams competing. The winners of the three head-to-head matches in the first round advance to the second round, along with the highest scoring losing team, leaving four teams. At this point, a champion is chosen based on single-elimination rules.
