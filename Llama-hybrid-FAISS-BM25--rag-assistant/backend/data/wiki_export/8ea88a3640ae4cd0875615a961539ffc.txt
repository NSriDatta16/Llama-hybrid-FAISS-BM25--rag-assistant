2015–Present 
In early 2015, Bernaldo started playing for Parokya ni Edgar when their bassist Buwi Meneses announced a hiatus from the band due to relocating with his family in USA. Bernaldo was asked to leave from the group without a formal announcement from any member of the band that he was already dismissed. Bubby Zabala of Eraserheads took his place and is currently playing and recording for the band recently. Although it is still unclear, no formal announcement was made.
