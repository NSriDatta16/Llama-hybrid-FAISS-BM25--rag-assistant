Elvis is the eighteenth studio album by American singer and musician Elvis Presley, released on July 16, 1973. It sold over 1 million copies worldwide. To differentiate it from his eponymous 1956 release, it is sometimes called The "Fool" Album, after its first track which appears just below Elvis' name on the front cover. In the US, "Fool" was issued as the B-side of "Steamroller Blues" from the Aloha from Hawaii Via Satellite album. In the UK the sides were flipped and "Fool" was issued as the A-side. It reached No. 15.

Content
The album tracks "Fool" and "Where Do I Go From Here" were recorded in March 1972. "It's Impossible" is a live recording from the Hilton Hotel in Las Vegas from February 1972, recorded during a successful fifty-seven show season. The remaining tracks were leftovers from the March and May 1971 recording sessions at RCA's Studio B in Nashville. Three songs feature Presley on piano:  "It's Still Here", "I'll Take You Home Again, Kathleen" and "I Will Be True". These three selections were all released together for a second time as part of the 1980 boxed set, Elvis Aron Presley. The song "Fool" was also released in this collection. Four other songs in this album were also reissued in other albums: "It's Impossible" (Pure Gold, 1975), "Padre" (He Walks Beside Me, 1978), "(That's What You Get) For Lovin' Me" (A Canadian Tribute, 1978) and "Don't Think Twice, It's All Right" (Our Memories Of Elvis Volume 2, 1979).
