Le Lycée Razi (), translated in English as Razi High School, was a French-language co-ed school located on Pahlavi Street (now renamed Valiasr Street after the revolution of 79 ) in Tehran, Iran. The school is named after Razi a Persian physician, philosopher, and scholar. The first Razi school was built during the 1950s in a different area of the city of Teheran, and at the beginning of the 60s a new campus was built north of Vanak Square in Teheran.

Prior to the 1979 Revolution, the school was one of two French-language schools in Tehran along with Lycée Jeanne d'Arc. In contrast to the more rigiorous and religious association at Jeanne d'Arc, Razi was associated with upper-middle class families in Tehran due to the fact that members of the Shah's family attended the school.
