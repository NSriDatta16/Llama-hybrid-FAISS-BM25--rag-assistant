History

The Bella Coola Valley was already the ancient home to the Nuxálk people when European explorers arrived. Norwegian settlers from Minnesota and Wisconsin arrived in 1894, and under the guidance of the Reverend Christian Saugstad established a colony. The colony was named "Hagen's Borg" after Hagen B. Christensen, the first storekeeper in the area and postmaster from April 1, 1896 to October 14, 1910. ("borg" is Norwegian for a fortress or castle).

Transportation

Hagensborg is served by Highway 20, which runs from Williams Lake to Bella Coola, at the mouth of the Bella Coola River on North Bentinck Arm. In order to access the Bella Coola Valley via Highway 20, a portion of the drive known as "The Hill" or "The Precipice" must be traversed. This route is sitting at an elevation of 1487 metres and contains treacherous switchbacks and hairpin turns, shared by a single-lane gravel road.The Bella Coola Airport is located in Hagensborg, just East of Bella Coola.

Services and locations of note

Hagensborg is located centrally with regard to the population distribution of the Bella Coola Valley.  As such, it provides some services, such as the airport, ambulance station, cemetery, swimming pool (summer only), Royal Canadian Legion hall and some accommodation and retail that serve the entire Valley.  In addition, it is the primary service centre for the eastern end of the Bella Coola Valley, and thus is home to a full-service grocery store, gas station, bed and breakfast, and other commercial services. Hagensborg is home to the Norwegian Heritage House, a preserved house built prior to 1900 by Andrew Svisdahl, an early Norwegian settler in the area.  The House has been outfitted as an interpretive centre.
