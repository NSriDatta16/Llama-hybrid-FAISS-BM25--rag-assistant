History
Established in 1927 as SK Staré Město, the club played exclusively in the lower levels of Czechoslovak and later Czech football.

Staré Město won the Moravian–Silesian Football League in the 1996–97 season and were promoted to the Czech 2. Liga in 1997. The club won promotion from the Czech 2. Liga in 2000, clinching promotion five matches before the end of the season. This marked the start of the club's first-ever spell in the country's top flight. The club merged with Slovácká Slavia Uherské Hradiště in 2000, the resultant club becoming 1. FC Synot. During the club's first seasons in the Czech First League, they took part in European competition a number of times, playing in the UEFA Intertoto Cup on three occasions. In the summer of 2004, the club officially changed its name to 1. FC Slovácko. Slovácko reached the final of the 2004–05 Czech Cup, losing 2–1 to winners Baník Ostrava.

The club played for seven years in the Czech First League before being relegated in 2007. The club went on to play two years in the second division, being promoted despite finishing 10th in the 2008–09 Czech 2. Liga, as second-placed side that season, Čáslav, sold Slovácko their license for the top flight. The same season, the club again reached the final of the Czech Cup, losing the final of the 2008–09 Czech Cup to Teplice.

In the 2021/22 season, the club finished in 4th place on 68 points ahead of FC Banik Ostrava in 5th. They also won the Czech Cup for the first time in the club's history after defeating Sparta Prague 3–1 with goals from Václav Jurečka and Petr Reinberk who scored twice, and qualified for the UEFA Europa League.
