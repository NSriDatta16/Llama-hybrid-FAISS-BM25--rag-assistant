The Runaway Mine Train is a powered steel roller coaster made by MACK Rides of Germany.  The ride is located in the Katanga Canyon area of Alton Towers in Staffordshire, England.

The train normally makes two circuits for each ride, although on quiet days it has been known to run for three or more circuits. On 18 July 2021, the ride ran for 24 consecutive circuits after the park closed. Most passengers were guests, but after several circuits, some of the guests alighted the train, and ride operators from other areas of the park took their places. It is believed to be the record number of times anyone has ever gone around the track without getting off. 

The ride runs alongside the Congo River Rapids, with which it shares a tunnel section.  Passengers on the two rides occasionally wave to each other if they pass in the shared tunnel. Passengers must be at least 0.9 m tall to ride with an adult, and over 1.1 m tall to ride separately.

As of 2013, it is officially the park's oldest roller coaster, after The Beastie was removed prior to the 2013 season. The runaway mine train gets more intense in the cave area

Incidents 
On 20 July 2006, the failure of a coupling on the train caused it to split into two sections, which then collided in the tunnel. 20 people were injured, 6 of whom were taken to a hospital; 4 of the 6 were sent home, and 2 were kept in overnight.
