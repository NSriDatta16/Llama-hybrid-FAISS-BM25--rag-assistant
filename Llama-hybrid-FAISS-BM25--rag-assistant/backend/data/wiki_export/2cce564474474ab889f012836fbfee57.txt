Critical reception
Paul Moody from NME named "You Know How We Do It" Big Funky Single of the Week, adding, "A deep, oven-baked rhythm, a sample stolen from the wonderful "The Show is Over" by Evelyn Champagne King and then Ice himself, grumbling about how ...They wanna have me in stripes, like Dennis the Menace and mumbling incoherently about the 'West Side'. [...] A funk record for people scared to funk and a rap record for people who... yeah, yeah, you know. A monster hit."
