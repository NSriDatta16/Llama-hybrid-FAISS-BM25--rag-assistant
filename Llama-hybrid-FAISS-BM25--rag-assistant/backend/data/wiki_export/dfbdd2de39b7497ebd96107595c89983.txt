In 1995–96 they won the Premier Division title but were not promoted, however the following year they repeated their title success and this time moved up to the Midland Football Alliance, where they remained for six seasons before a last place finish in 2002–03 saw them relegated back to the West Midlands League, where they have struggled. In fact in 2004–05 they finished bottom but were spared relegation.
