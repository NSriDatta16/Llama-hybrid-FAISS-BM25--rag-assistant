Bailando por un Sueño ("Dancing for a dream") is a reality series on the Mexican television network Canal de las Estrellas, in which many famous Latin American actors and actresses and celebrities are partnered with common, everyday people who have a dream they want to fulfill with the help of this program. Each week, the pairs of contestants compete against each other to impress a panel of judges. After each show, the two couples who receive the lowest scores compete against each other to avoid being eliminated from the competition. Through a telephone poll, viewers can also contribute to the success of the dancers. The votes of the viewers are combined with the panel's scores to decide on the ranking of the dancers. The process continues until there are only two couples standing. Rather than the promise of a large cash prize, the winner gets a previously stated wish granted. The show is also broadcast in the US on Univision.
