The Constitutionalist Party of Iran–Liberal Democrat (, Hezbé Mashruté Iran-Liberal Demokrat) is an Iranian exiled monarchist political party. The party condemns the Iranian Revolution and awaits for the return of the monarchy under Reza Pahlavi.

German authorities believe the group "is not a serious danger to Iran since its activities are limited to propaganda against the regime."
