Cell were a New York–based rock band. They were often labeled as a grunge band due to the time frame of their existence, though they could be considered college rock or alternative rock.  The band formed in 1990 and disbanded in 1995.  Championed by Sonic Youth's Thurston Moore, they released a 7 inch on his Ecstatic Peace label, and later signed to Geffen.
