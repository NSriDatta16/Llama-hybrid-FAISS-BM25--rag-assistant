History 

Valuyki was founded in 1593 as a fortress for protection against the Crimean and Nogai Tatar raids along the Muravsky Trail.

In January 1943, during ARMIR's retreat from the Don front, after days of continuous fighting, exhausted by cold and hunger, numerous men from various units of the 4th Alpine Division "Cuneense", commanded by General Emilio Battisti, converged in Valuyki. Despite their attempt to break out of encirclement and open a way to the west, the Alpini were surrounded and blocked by Soviet troops and finally forced to surrender.

In early September 2015 Reuters reported that Russia was building a new army base "near Valuyki, a small town not far from Soloti." Established in connection with the war in Ukraine, the base was to have barracks for 3,500 soldiers.  During the Russian invasion of Ukraine there were reports that Ukrainian artillery shelled the base of the Russian 3rd Motor Rifle Division in September 2022.
