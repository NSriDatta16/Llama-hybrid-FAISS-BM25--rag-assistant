How I Quit Smoking is the second studio album by the American rock band Lambchop, released on January 30, 1996, by Merge Records.

The song "The Man Who Loved Beer" is an adaptation of the poem "The Man Who Was Tired of Life" from the ancient Egyptian text Dispute between a man and his Ba (c. 2000â€“1700 BC). The song was in turn later covered by David Byrne.
