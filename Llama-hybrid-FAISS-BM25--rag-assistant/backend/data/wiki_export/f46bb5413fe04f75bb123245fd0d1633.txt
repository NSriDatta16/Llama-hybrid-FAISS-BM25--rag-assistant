On 31 January 2017, Murray re-signed permanently for Brighton & Hove Albion on a deal until June 2019. He had scored 15 goals in 28 appearances while on loan to the club in the first half of the season. He contributed 8 more league goals in the remainder of the season, including the opening goal in a 2–1 home win against Wigan Athletic on 17 April that sealed Brighton's promotion to the Premier League for the first time in their history.

Newly promoted Brighton made a positive start to their inaugural Premier League season, sitting in 8th place after eleven games. An unbeaten run of four games from mid-October coincided with Murray hitting a good run of form, with the striker scoring four goals in the three games preceding the November international break. His scoring run began with two against West Ham United in a 3–0 away win, and he followed it up with goals against Southampton at home and Swansea City away, earning Brighton four points. On 8 January 2018, Murray scored the winning goal in Brighton's 2–1 victory over arch rivals and former club Crystal Palace to eliminate them from the FA Cup at the third-round stage. After impressive form scoring 5 in his last 6 games in the run up to England's friendlies in March many fans believed that Murray and Albion captain Lewis Dunk should've been called for the first time, however he and Dunk were overlooked by Gareth Southgate. Murray took the omission with  humour and posted a picture on Twitter of him and Dunk with their hands on their heads in disbelief – taken in a previous match – with a caption of laughing emojis.

On 1 September 2018 Murray scored twice to take Brighton from 2–0 down to draw 2–2 with Fulham. His 100th goal for Albion, the only goal of the match at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers on 27 October, made him just the second manafter Tommy Cook with 123to reach that milestone. In October after being linked with the England set up again after a run of decent form Murray played down the England talk but would welcome a call-up, however he was not selected in the upcoming squad and from then on the England talk evaporated.  Murray signed a one-year contract extension on 13 November that runs to the summer of 2020. After 9 games without scoring, on 29 January 2019 Murray scored another two goals against Fulham in a 4–2 away defeat. This time Fulham came back from 2 goals behind, and won. On 6 February 2019 Murray scored another two goals this time coming off the bench in a fourth round FA Cup replay against West Brom where his goals put Brighton 2–1 and 3–1 up in the 3–1 victory. On 9 March 2019 Murray scored his 100th league goal for The Seagulls at his former club and bitter rivals Crystal Palace in a 2–1 away victory. This win meant Brighton won the double over Palace. 

Murray scored his first goal of the 2019–20 season in a 2–1 away win over Bristol Rovers in the EFL Cup on 27 August. His first league goal didn't come until 1 February 2020, scoring Brighton's third and the last of the goals in the 3–3 draw at West Ham. In April 2020, Murray alongside captain Lewis Dunk were in pay cuts talks as a result of the impact of COVID-19 with Murray stating, "It's bringing the club together even more" describing the talks with the board as "very positive" and an "eye-opener." Murray only scored one league goal in Brighton's third year in the top flight starting 7 of his 23 appearances in which he also provided one assist. Although Murray had a frustrating season he was still well trusted and remained popular amongst the fans.

Loan to Watford and Brighton departure
On 1 September 2020, Murray signed for Championship club Watford on a one-year loan deal. 10 days later he made his debut in Watford's opening game of the season coming on as a sub in a 1–0 home win over Middlesbrough.

After making 6 appearances on loan at Watford, Murray returned to Brighton and 2 days after his return it was announced that he had signed for Nottingham Forest. Murray scored a total of 111 goals in 287 appearances across both of his spells at the club, helping The Seagulls achieve promotion from League One to the Premier League and to the 2018–19 FA Cup semi final. He sits in second place in Brighton's all time top goalscorers list 12 goals behind Tommy Cook from 1921–1929.

Nottingham Forest

He made his debut a day later coming on as a substitute in the 76th minute for goalscorer Lewis Grabban in a 2–1 away win over Coventry City. Murray made his first start for Forest 4 days later, scoring his first goals for the club with a brace in a 3–0 away win at league strugglers Wycombe Wanderers, in a match where former Brighton team mate Knockaert also scored with another former Brighton team mate Bong assisting Murray's first goal. He managed 2 goals in his 16 league appearances for Forest.
