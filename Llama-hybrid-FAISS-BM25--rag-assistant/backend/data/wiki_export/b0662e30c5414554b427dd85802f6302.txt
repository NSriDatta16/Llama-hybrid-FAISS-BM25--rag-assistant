During the 1976 Major League Baseball expansion draft, McMillan was selected by the Seattle Mariners. Before the start of the 1977 season, the Mariners sent him to the Triple-A Rochester Red Wings.

His offensive debut would come on September 21, against the Milwaukee Brewers at County Stadium. In five at-bats, McMillan went hitless. It would prove to be his final MLB game. Defensively during his two games with the Mariners, McMillan played shortstop, committing no errors, while making one assist and two putouts.
