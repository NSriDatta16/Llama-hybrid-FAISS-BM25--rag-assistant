Qambar Shahdadkot District (, ) is a district of Sindh, Pakistan, originally named after Shahdad Khan Khuhawar the official founder.  District Qambar Shahdadkot, with headquarters at Qambar, was established on 13 December 2004.

Taluka Qambar and Shahdadkot Tehsil were part of Larkana district since long before they were combined and made one district for administrative purposes. At first it was named only Qambar but because of dissent from the people of Shahdadkot city, the name Shahdadkot was added. Today, however, the locals of Shahdadkot demand a separate district comprising Shahdadkot, Qubo Saeed Khan and Sijawal Junejo as they face difficulties in governmental work because they must go a long distance to Qambar to get the work done because most government offices are there. The district was created in the tenure of Chief Minister Arbab Ghulam Rahim, who is accused of creating this district for political gains and to weaken the stronghold of Pakistan People's Party in the area because Shahdadkot has been the electoral constituency for Shaheed Benazir Bhutto. The creation of the district benefited family, who are the landlords of Qambar Shahdadkot. In 2005, Nawab Shabbir Khan Chandio became the first elected nazim of the newly created district.

History
The district was split from Larkana District in December 2005. There was some controversy over the name of the district, with Qambar being favoured initially, but after protests from residents of Shahdadkot, it was renamed to Qambar-Shahdadkot District. The headquarters of the district is Qambar city.

Administrative divisions
The total area of District Qambar Shahdadkot is 1453383 acres. The district is divided into seven tehsils: Qambar, Miro Khan, Shahdadkot, Warah, Sija Wal Junejo, Nasirabad and Qubo Saeed Khan. Taluka Qambar has the largest area, 522,462 acres. District Council Qambar Shahdadkot has 52 union councils, two municipal committees and seven town committees.

Geography

Qambar Shahdakot shares its borders with three districts of Balochistan on the west, Khuzdar, Jaffarabad and Jhal Magsi. Its southern borders are connected with district Dadu. District Larkana is on the east and district Jacobabad is on the north.

The district has a variety of features with its vast plains, agricultural land, the mighty mountain range of Kirthar and a number of wetlands including Hamal, Drigh and Langh lakes. The Khirthar extends southward for almost 300 km from the Mula River in east-central Balochistan to Cape Muari (Monze) west of Karachi on the Arabian Sea. Khirthar in Sindhi means 'milk-cream', which is contrary to the environment of the place. It is a range of limestone hills and mountains which is referred to as Hallar by the old writers, but it is commonly known as Kirthar today.

The Khirthar range also has a national park, which is the second largest wildlife park in the area. It is located between Karachi and Balochistan. This area is covered with limestone hills which rise from 4000 to nearly 8000 feet and are surrounded by the fossilized remnants of different times of history.

The inhabitants of the region are chiefly Balochi and Sindhi who belong to Brahui tribe and they survive by flock graze. Chhuttas of Balochistan, Chandios and Gainchos of Sindh also live in this area.

Rare species of animals are found in Khirthar National Park, including the Sindh wild goat, Indian fox, Egyptian vulture, Indian pangolin, desert wolf, Chinkara gazelle, honey badger, jackal, Asiatic leopard, Bonnelli's eagle, striped hyena, jungle cat, and a number of reptile and bird species.

Demographics
At the time of the 2017 census, Qambar Shahdadkot district had a population of 1,338,035, of which 680,567 were males and 657,290 females. The rural population was 941,232 (70.34%) and urban 396,803 (29.66%). The literacy rate is 38.08%: 48.59% for males and 27.28% for females.

The majority religion is Islam, with 99.21% of the population. Hinduism (including those from Scheduled Castes) is practiced by 0.74% of the population.

At the time of the 2017 census, 90.00% of the population spoke Sindhi and 8.00% Brahui as their first language.

Industry
The Shahdadkot Textile Mills was situated in the north of Shahdadkot City. It employed around 4,500 workers in the district which was previously part of Larkana. The mill was established in 1974 under the orders of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, then prime minister of Pakistan. Iran had assisted Pakistan for the installation of the mill in Shahdadkot. The mill was started in 1978 and became the source of livelihood of many people living in all four provinces. The cloth from here was sent to Punjab for sale. The mill produced export quality cloth.

Due to political problems after Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's time and financial crisis to the mill, it could not pay salaries to its 4000 workers and this led to the downfall of the mill during Zia's regime. When Benazir Bhutto returned to the government in 1990, the mill again started to produce fine polyester productions of various designs. Abdul Fatah Bhatti, funded by Nisar Memon, a contractor from Karachi, was given complete authorization to operate in the mills. He even expelled the few remaining workers from the Mills and put up a notice of shutting down of the mills on July 8, 2007. Because of political and economic crisis, the mills and the industry in the district suffered and its infrastructure was sold for a petty amount. Now it wears a deserted look.

The present small industries are as follows: electronic goods, agricultural tools, construction material and food processing through bakeries and shops. The cottage industry of embroidery caps particularly in Shahdadkot Taluka has a good market in the district as well as outside the district.
