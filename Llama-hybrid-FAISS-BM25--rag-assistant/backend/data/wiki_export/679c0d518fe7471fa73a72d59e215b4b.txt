History
In the 18th century, the Franco-Canadian merchant Louis Fornel landed near the present site of Rigolet and claimed the land for France in 1743. The Franco-Canadians established trading posts in Kaipokok Bay at that time.

The English took control of the Labrador coast in 1763 after the Seven Years' War. This brought a flood of European fishermen and whalers to settle on the Labrador coast.

Around 1784, Pierre Marcoux and Louis Marchand reopened the old Kaipokok trading post. In 1795, the Moravian Brothers of Hopedale observed that Pierre Marcoux and the former partner of George Cartwright Collingham were the first Europeans to settle in Kaipokok Bay.

In order to compete with the Moravians, the Hudson's Bay Company established a coastal trading post on Kaipokok Bay in 1837 shortly after Rigolet. It operated until 1880.

The village was first known as The Post because of the Hudson's Bay Company trading post located in the area. Inuit families traded in the fall, winter and spring before returning to the coastal camps in the summer. The village was renamed Postville in the 1940s by Pentecostal pastor William Gillet who helped establish the community by building a school and a church. Through the 1940s it was mostly a winter residence for settlers who were scattered around the bay and coast in the summer. In 1949, Gillet opened a store in Postville and built a sawmill in Shanty Brook across the bay (which burnt down in 1957). From then, the population gradually began to concentrate in Postville. In 1961, its population was 84. Permanent settlement was further boosted by the opening of a shipyard in 1974. Although the shipyard closed a few years later, a new sawmill opened in 1990.

An uncommon magnitude 4.3 earthquake was measured in Labrador on February 5, 2020, with its epicentre about  east of Postville. It was the strongest quake on the Labrador coast in 40 years.
