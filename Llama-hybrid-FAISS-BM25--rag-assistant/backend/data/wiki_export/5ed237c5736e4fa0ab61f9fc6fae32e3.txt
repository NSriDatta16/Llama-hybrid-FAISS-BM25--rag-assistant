Since the route was established, it has served as the major route between Quincy, IL and Macomb, IL, bypassing Carthage, Illinois.  The route crosses the LaMoine River south of Colmar and parallels the Quincy branch of the old Chicago, Burlington & Quincy railroad along sections of its route.

The route is currently designated as a Class II Truck Route.
