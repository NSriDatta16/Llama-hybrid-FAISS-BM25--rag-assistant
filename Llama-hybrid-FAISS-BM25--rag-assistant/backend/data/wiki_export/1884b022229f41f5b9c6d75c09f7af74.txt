The Faculty of Veterinary Medicine () at Université de Montréal is one of five veterinary medical schools in Canada. It is the only French-language veterinary college in North America. The faculty is part of the Université de Montréal and is located in Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec near Montreal.

The veterinary college was located in Oka, Quebec before moving to Saint-Hyacinthe in 1947. In Oka, the veterinary college formed part of an agricultural-veterinary educational centre operated by the Trappists. This centre was financed by the Quebec Department of Agriculture.

The Centre became the direct responsibility of the Québec Department of Agriculture from 1947 to 1969. In 1969, the Centre became a Université de Montréal faculty. Considerable development in staff and facilities has taken place.

The FMV holds a full accreditation of the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) and is one of 15 faculties and affiliated schools of Université de Montréal
