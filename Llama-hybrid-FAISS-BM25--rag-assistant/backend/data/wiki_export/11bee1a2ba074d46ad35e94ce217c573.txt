Gitanae or Gitana (), or Gitona (Γίτωνα), or Titana (Τίτανα or Τιτάνα), was a city of ancient Epirus, described by Livy as being near Corcyra, and about 10 miles from the coast. as a place of meeting of the Epirote League (Concillio Epirotarum). It is not mentioned by any other ancient writer, and it was conjectured that the word is a corrupt form of Chyton, which Ephorus spoke of as a place in Epirus colonised by Ionians from Klazomenai.

However, its site has been located as the place bearing the modern name Gkoumani, near the village of Fragma Kalama in Greece.
