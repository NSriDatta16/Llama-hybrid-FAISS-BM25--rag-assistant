Miss Modular is a 1997 EP by the post-rock band Stereolab. The title track served as the lead single from their album Dots and Loops. It was produced in collaboration with the group Mouse on Mars. Dan the Automator remixed the title track.

All four of its tracks were re-released on the Oscillons from the Anti-Sun compilation.

Critical reception
AllMusic wrote: "Digitally assembled from isolated studio elements, the aptly titled 'Miss Modular' is musique concrète pop, a bubbly yet plainly synthetic effort that walks the tightrope between art and artifice."
