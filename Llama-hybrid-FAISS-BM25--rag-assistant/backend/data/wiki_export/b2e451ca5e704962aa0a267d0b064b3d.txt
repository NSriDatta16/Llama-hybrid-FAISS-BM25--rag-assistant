The airport resides at an elevation of  above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 05/23 with an asphalt surface measuring .

French military base
What would become Fort-Lamy Base Aerienne 172 was occupied by a permanent detachment of French Air Force aircraft from 1939 until its abandonment in 1975.

There has been a French base here since independence, the only lapses being in 1975 and again for a couple of years beginning in 1978. After Operation Epervier started, it has been extensively used by French Air Force and Army during various operations.  In 2016, Epervier is composed of about 1500 men, a dozen Mirage 2000 fighters, Puma and Caiman helicopters, and transport and tankers aircraft (C-160 Transall, Boeing KC-135, C-130 Hercules) Operations are undertaken over neighbouring Mali and Niger for Operation Barkhane, combating militant groups throughout the southern Sahara. The entire area is under the authority of COMELEF [commandement des élément français], typically a French Air Force colonel. The importance of the operation does mean that the runway is always open, and that excellent primary radar coverage is provided, as well as other facilities (military hospital, rescue and fire services, assistance with ATC)

On September 7, 1987 a Tupolev Tu-22 of the Libyan Arab Air Force was shot down as it was bombing the French base. French Army Hawk missiles downed this aircraft, three crew members being killed - and the bombs missed their targets, falling in sandy areas.

The French base is also shared by the Chadian Air Force with Su-25 Frogfoot, Mi-24 Hind helicopters, and C-130 Hercules stationed there.
