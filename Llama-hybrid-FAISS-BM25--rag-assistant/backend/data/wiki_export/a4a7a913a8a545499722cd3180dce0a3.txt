Leif Hoste (born 17 July 1977) is a retired Belgian professional road racing cyclist, who last rode for UCI Professional Continental Team team . Born in Kortrijk, Hoste's career highlights included winning two stages and the overall title at the 2006 Three Days of De Panne, the 2001, 2006 and 2007 Belgian national time trial championships, and a second-place finish at the 2004, 2006 and 2007 one-day classic Tour of Flanders.

At the 2006 Paris–Roubaix, after finishing second, Hoste was disqualified by the race jury for illegally riding through a closed level crossing along with Peter Van Petegem and Vladimir Gusev (who were also disqualified).

On 29 March 2013, the Belgian cycling federation began a doping case against Hoste. On 13 July 2014 it was confirmed by the UCI that Hoste had been banned for two years until 29 December 2015 for biological passport irregularities.
