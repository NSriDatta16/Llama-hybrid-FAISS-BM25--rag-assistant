"Sólo Quédate En Silencio" is a song recorded by Mexican pop group RBD. It was released on December 2, 2004, as the second single from group's debut album Rebelde. The song peaked at number 1 on the charts in Mexico and at number 2 on Billboard's Hot Latin Songs Chart. It served as the third opening theme song for the Mexican telenovela Rebelde, where the group originated from. Its music video has over 36 million views on YouTube.

Background and release 
Production of the telenovela Rebelde began in 2004, and the main young lead actors, Anahí, Alfonso Herrera, Dulce María, Christopher von Uckermann, Maite Perroni, and Christian Chávez, were put together to form the band RBD. The group released their debut single "Rebelde" on September 30, followed by their debut album of the same name two months later. Both the show, the song, and the album enjoyed great success, with the latter two topping the charts in Mexico. For the second single, the first option was "Un Poco De Tu Amor", but "Sólo Quédate En Silencio" was receiving heavy rotation, and it was chosen as the next single instead. The song was one of the seven tracks on the album to have a Portuguese version; it was called "Fique Em Silêncio" ("Stay In Silence") and released as the second single in Brazil. An English version of the song was also recorded in 2006, titled "Keep It Down Low" and released on RBD's first English studio album, Rebels. This makes it one of the five songs, along with "Sálvame", "Tenerte Y Quererte", "Nuestro Amor", "Feliz Cumpleaños" and "Dame" to be recorded in Spanish, English and Portuguese.

Composition and lyrics 
"Sólo Quédate En Silencio" was written by Maurcio Arriaga and produced by Armando Ávila, Carlos Lara, Max di Carlo, and the telenovela's producer Pedro Damián. It is a Latin pop and soft rock song that lasts for 3 minutes and 37 seconds. It follows the verse-refrain-pre-chorus-chorus structure, with Anahí, Dulce María, and Christian being the main vocalists. Throughout the chorus, Maite is present, while Christopher finishes each phrase, and Alfonso is only heard on the last line. The latter two also provide backing vocals for Anahí (refrain), and Dulce (second pre-chorus, alongside Christian), respectively. Lyrically, the song finds the group asking their partners to remain silent during their last moments before they part ways. Several fans noted that the problems presented on the track stemmed from the other person being unfaithful.

The song opens with Anahí finding her lover awake and asking for forgiveness. In the second verse, Chrisitan feels scared and asks his significant other what he "ha[s] done wrong". During the refrains, both singers talk about "freezing" in place as their partners hug them and ask for a kiss. During the pre-chorus, Dulce asks for her boyfriend to tell her that the situation is not happening. The bridge has Christian and Dulce wanting their partners to "say that you love [them]" as they hold their hands. The chorus sees the band asks "Sólo quédate en silencio, cinco minutos" ("Just stay in silence, five minutes"), and promising to leave after giving "the last kiss" to their lovers.

Chart performance
The song became RBD's first successful single internationally. The song peaked at number two on Billboard's Hot Latin Songs, as well as number 23 on the U.S. Hot Ringtones chart and number one on the Hot Latin Pop Airplay chart. The Brazilian version of the song peaked at number 2 on Billboard's Hot Latin Songs.

It received good reviews by critics and gave RBD mainstream radio airplay in the U.S.

In November 2008, "Sólo Quédate En Silencio" was promoted in Argentina and Uruguay, as well as Equatorial Guinea in Africa.

Music video
The video was the second RBD video directed by Pedro Damián. Similar to "Rebelde," it was shot in Desierto de los Leones in Mexico. While the band was shooting the music video for "Rebelde," they shot some additional takes of "Sólo Quédate en Silencio."

The video features the band performing on a famous avenue in Mexico City, extra footage from their radio station concerts, and different scenes of them in various parts of Mexico performing.
