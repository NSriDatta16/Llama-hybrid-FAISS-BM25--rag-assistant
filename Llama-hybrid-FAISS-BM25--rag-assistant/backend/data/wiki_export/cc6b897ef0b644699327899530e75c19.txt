AdHouse Books was an independent comic book publisher based in Richmond, Virginia. It was founded in 2002 by graphic designer Chris Pitzer. 

AdHouse was known primarily as a publisher of graphic novels, beginning with 2002's Pulpatoon: Pilgrimage, traditional comic book series, and art books, including James Jean's Process Recess;

The company announced on July 14, 2021, that it would cease publications after its 101st book. The company would then take 2022 to visit as many shows, conventions, festivals, etc., as they could. Among the reasons, Pitzer mentioned his older age, as well as "low sales on recent releases, uneasiness about the crowdfunding model, and the lack of conventions due to the COVID-19 pandemic."
