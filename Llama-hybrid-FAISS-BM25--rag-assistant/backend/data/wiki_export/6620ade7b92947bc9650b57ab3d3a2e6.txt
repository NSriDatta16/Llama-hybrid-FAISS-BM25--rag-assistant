Harder Than You is the debut album by 24-7 Spyz. It was released in 1989 via In-Effect. The album contains elements of several genres. The group flirts with polka on "Tango Skin Polka," introspective political reggae on "Ballots Not Bullets," and speed metal with "Spill My Guts."

The band made a video for MTV for their cover of Kool & the Gang's "Jungle Boogie." The song was remixed into a dance version with extended electronic instrumental passages, and was popular on the club circuit.

Like many 24-7 Spyz albums, the recording is out of print.

Critical reception
Trouser Press wrote that the band "mixes and matches hardcore punk and tough-minded funk on Harder Than You to achieve a singularly potent blend ... It’s the band’s freewheeling sense of fun that makes [the album] such a visceral joy." The Orlando Sentinel deemed the album "rock-ska-punk-funk-soul-reggae-hip/hop-metal-jazz-polka core." The Encyclopedia of Popular Music praised the "stunning performances from the Jimi Hendrix-worshipping Hazel and the energetic Fluid."
