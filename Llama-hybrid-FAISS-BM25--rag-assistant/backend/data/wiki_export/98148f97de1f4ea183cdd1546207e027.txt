In recognition of the best players in the UEFA Champions League each year, UEFA gives out several awards to the most outstanding performers of the European club football season. The awards are presented in August each year at a special gala in Monaco; previously, the ceremony would coincide with the UEFA Super Cup, but since the Super Cup was moved to early August in 2014, the UEFA awards ceremony has been combined with the UEFA Champions League group stage draw. Internazionale and Real Madrid are the only teams whose players won all of the available awards in the same season (in the 2009–10 and 2017–18 seasons, respectively).

For the 2010–11 season, the UEFA Club Footballer of the Year award was replaced by the UEFA Best Player in Europe Award, but the positional awards returned in 2016–17. Positional awards for players in the UEFA Women's Champions League were introduced in 2019–20.
