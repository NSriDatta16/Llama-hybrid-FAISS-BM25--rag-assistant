All-Time Statistical Leaders (Strikeouts)
The 1886 season was memorable as the top two all-time Major League Baseball single season strikeout totals were established that year:

Notable seasons
Guy Hecker of the Louisville Colonels not only compiled a 26–23 record with a 2.87 Earned Run Average as the Colonels number 2 pitcher, he also won the American Association batting crown with a .341 average.  Hecker remains the only pitcher to ever win a batting title.
Matt Kilroy of the Baltimore Orioles throws 4 2-hitters, 3 1-hitters and a no-hitter in his rookie season in 1886.  Kilroy also sets the single season major league record with 513 strikeouts.
Jocko Flynn of the Chicago White Stockings goes 23–6 in his rookie season in 1886.  Flynn develops arm trouble and never pitches again in the major leagues.  His 23 wins are still a record for a pitcher who only pitched in 1 season.

Events

January–March
January 4 – St. Louis Browns owner Chris von der Ahe sells the reserve rights of Sam Barkley to the Pittsburgh Alleghenys for $1,000.  von der Ahe had previously sold the rights to the Baltimore Orioles on December 24, 1885 but had not received payment from Baltimore.  Barkley, in the interim, had already signed a contract with Baltimore.  The resulting power struggle within the American Association to resolve the situation would lead to the ouster of league president, Denny McKnight.
January 16 – The Washington Nationals are admitted to the National League.
February 5 – The lawsuit brought by Fred Thayer and George Wright against Albert Spalding and his Spalding sporting goods company for infringement upon Thayer's patent rights to the catching mask goes to trial.  Spalding will be forced to pay royalties to Thayer and Wright when the case is settled.
