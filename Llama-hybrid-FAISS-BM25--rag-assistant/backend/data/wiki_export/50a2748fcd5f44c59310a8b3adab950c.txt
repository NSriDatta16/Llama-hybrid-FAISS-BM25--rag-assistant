Tails of Illusion is the second album by glam rock band Fox released in 1975.

Recording and production 

Kenny Young and company were overwhelmed after the whirlwind success of their eponymous debut album, and spent a significant while recovering in Bali. The experience revitalized him, and he wanted to do more than write silly love songs; he wanted to share his enlightenment and his Bali with the world, and it's evident throughout the album, from the cover art, to snippets of gamelan concerts, to song names ("Kupu-kupu" means butterfly).
