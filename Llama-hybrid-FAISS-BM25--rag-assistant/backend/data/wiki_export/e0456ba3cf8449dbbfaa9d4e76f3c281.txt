The Caesar Rodney School District (CRSD) is a public school district based in Wyoming, Delaware (USA). The current superintendent is Dr. Corey Miklus.

History
It was established on July 1, 1915, as State Consolidated District No. 1. The school board later chose the name Caesar Rodney as its namesake and it became the Caesar Rodney Consolidated School District. It merged with six other school districts to form the Caesar Rodney Special School District on July 1, 1919. The Comegys District merged into the Caesar Rodney district in 1937, and 11 other school districts merged into Caesar Rodney from 1919 until 1969. In 1969 the district assumed its current name as the Delaware Legislature forced the Magnolia and Oak Point school districts to merge into Caesar Rodney.
