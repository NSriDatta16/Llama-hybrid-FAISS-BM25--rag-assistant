History 
During World War II, the facility was known as Herington Army Airfield and was used as a United States Army Air Forces Second Air Force as a staging area for overseas deployment of heavy bombers and their crews. These bombers included the models B-17, B-24, and B-29. The facilities at the field included runways, hangars, fuel storage tanks, barracks, administration buildings, and other related structures necessary for airfield operations. Construction started in 1942, and the field was completed over a 14-month period.

In 1945 Herington AAF was deactivated and then declared surplus in 1946. All the property was eventually disposed of and became the Herington Municipal Airport.
