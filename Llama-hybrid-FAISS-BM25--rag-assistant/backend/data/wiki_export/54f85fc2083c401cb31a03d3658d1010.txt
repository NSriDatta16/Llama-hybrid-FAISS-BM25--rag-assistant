Political life
Early in his career, he served as Staff Assistant to U.S. Senator Edward W. Brooke.

In 1986 Lees ran unsuccessfully for U.S. Congress against Congressman Edward Boland, (D), Springfield. Two years later he won an upset victory over Springfield City Council President Frank Keough for the State Senate.  Lees survived re-election in 1990 in a race against Democrat Edward Ryan and in 1992 against Timothy Rooke. Lees did not face serious competition after 1992 and had been unopposed in his two previous elections before deciding to retire in 2006.

The leader of the Massachusetts Republican caucus since 1993, Lees was just one of six Republicans in the State Senate in his final term, which is made up of forty senators.

Within the walls of the State House, Lees is known as a consensus builder by creating and sustaining debate in the Senate chamber. Lees was instrumental in the installation of television cameras inside the Senate chamber, so that the proceedings could be viewed by the public.

His yearly "Senior Forum" event drew large crowds of senior citizens.

Committee memberships
Lees served on the Senate committee on Ethics & Rules, The Judiciary Committee, The Telecommunication Committee, Utilities & Energy Committee and the  Tourism, Arts & Cultural Development Committee.

Future moves
He did not seek a 10th term in the Massachusetts Senate in 2008, instead running for Hampden County Clerk of Courts as a write-in during the Republican primary.  He went on to win the general election in November. In early 2012, Lees announced he would not seek re-election, signaling his retirement from the Clerk position and from public office.
