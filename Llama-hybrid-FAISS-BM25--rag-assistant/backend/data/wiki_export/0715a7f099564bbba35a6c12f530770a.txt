For ninth through twelfth grades, students from North Wildwood, West Wildwood and Wildwood Crest attend Wildwood High School as part of sending/receiving relationships.

History
The district formed in 1912 with the merger of Wildwood Borough and Holly Beach Borough school systems. The first school in the Wildwoods opened in 1882. After 1934, the city was at that time divided between the Glenwood Avenue and Wildwood High building zones for elementary school, with Garfield Avenue as the boundary; the Wildwood High building had grades 1-12 at the time. Now all areas of Wildwood City are zoned to the same two schools.

Former schools
Previously the district maintained Elementary School #1, for grades 5 and 6, at 4300 Pacific Avenue (at the site of the high school).

There was the Andrew Avenue School, a K-8 school which opened in 1886 and closed in 1934. A park was placed where it was.

Beginning in 1915, in the era of de jure educational segregation in the United States, Arctic Avenue School #4, with four classrooms, had segregated facilities for black children for grades 1-6. It stopped operations in 1949. By 1948 Wildwood's elementary took both white and black students but maintained separate classrooms on the basis of race.

Administration
Core members of the district's administration are:
John K. Kummings, Superintendent
Jason Fuscellaro, business administrator and board secretary

Board of education
The district's board of education, comprised of nine members, sets policy and oversees the fiscal and educational operation of the district through its administration. As a Type II school district, the board's trustees are elected directly by voters to serve three-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with three seats up for election each year held (since 2012) as part of the November general election. The board appoints a superintendent to oversee the day-to-day operation of the district. A non-voting board member represents North Wildwood
