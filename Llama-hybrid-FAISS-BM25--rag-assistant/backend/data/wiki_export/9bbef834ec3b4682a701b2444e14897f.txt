The Nangun () is a variation of the application of the "northern Chinese staff", which is featured in contemporary wushu exercises and forms.  It is based on staff techniques coming from Southern Chinese martial arts. Its movements stress hitting, in contrast to the cutting and swinging techniques of the northern staff.
