is a progressive rock band from Japan which began in 1973. They gained some attention when they performed the soundtrack to Cromartie High School (under the pseudonym of Bikyoran). They also performed the ending theme for the show (entitled "Trust Me"); however the opening theme was by Yoshida Takuro.

Their sound is often compared with King Crimson (they started as a King Crimson tribute band) which is understandable given guitarist Kunio Suma's emulation of Fripp's renowned style and some similarity in song titles ("Vision of the City", "21st Century Africa").
