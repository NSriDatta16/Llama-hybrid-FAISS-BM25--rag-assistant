In mathematics, in the field of group theory, a subgroup of a group is termed a retract if there is an endomorphism of the group that maps surjectively to the subgroup and is the identity on the subgroup. In symbols,  is a retract of  if and only if there is an endomorphism  such that  for all  and  for all .

The endomorphism  is an idempotent element in the transformation monoid of endomorphisms, so it is called an idempotent endomorphism or a retraction.

The following is known about retracts:

 A subgroup is a retract if and only if it has a normal complement. The normal complement, specifically, is the kernel of the retraction.
 Every direct factor is a retract. Conversely, any retract which is a normal subgroup is a direct factor.
 Every retract has the congruence extension property.
 Every regular factor, and in particular, every free factor, is a retract.
