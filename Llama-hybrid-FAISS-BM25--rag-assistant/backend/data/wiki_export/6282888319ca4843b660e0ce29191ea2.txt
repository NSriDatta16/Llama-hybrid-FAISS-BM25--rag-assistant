Robert Bodanzky, also known as Danton (born Isidor Bodanskie, 8 March 1879 – 2 November 1923), was an Austrian journalist, playwright, poet and artist. While he became famous for his apolitical poems before World War I, he turned an anarchist communist afterwards, writing political essays, plays and poems. He was the brother of the opera conductor Artur Bodanzky.
