Pakistan Press International (PPI) () is a Pakistani news agency first founded in June 1956 as the Pakistan Press Association (PPA). 

The name Pakistan Press Association (PPA) was changed in 1968. It was first started by  Muazzam Ali, the Chief Editor of Associated Press of Pakistan (APP). The agency objective was to provide competition to APP's monopoly in Pakistan. PPA also built up a network of correspondents in the smaller cities and towns in Pakistan. This was in contrast to APP, which had news coverage only in a limited number of large cities. For foreign news, the agency signed up with the Agence France-Presse (AFP) in 1957, and a year later became the first Asian partner of DPA. PPA also posted a correspondent in the Middle East, an area of special interest to Pakistani newspapers.
