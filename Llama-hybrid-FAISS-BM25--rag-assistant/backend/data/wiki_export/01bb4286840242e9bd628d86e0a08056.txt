Khartoum International Airport  () is the principal airport in Khartoum, the capital of Sudan.

 
The current airport will be replaced by the New Khartoum International Airport in Omdourman  south of the centre of Khartoum. This is planned to have two  runways, a passenger terminal of  and a 300-room international hotel. Construction is to be carried out by China Harbour Engineering Co. (CHEC). On 4 March 2021, the airport's ICAO code was changed from HSSS to HSSK.

The current airport originated as the Royal Air Force airfield Gordon's Tree. By January 1940, No. 223 Squadron RAF was located at Gordon's Tree, in the south of Khartoum. Later the area became known as El Shajjara ('The Tree'). By January 1942, No. 71 Operational Training Unit RAF was operating from the airfield; among aircraft operated were Curtiss Tomahawks and Vickers Wellesleys. Reportedly the OTU had at one stage 50 Harvards and 20 Hurricane fighters on strength.

Sudanese independence was granted in January 1956. The last Royal Air Force flying unit reported at Khartoum was No. 8 Squadron RAF, which arrived in November 1953, and stayed until July 1956.

The airport has been shut down since it was stormed and occupied on 15 April 2023 during the Battle of Khartoum.
