Dog Bites Man is a partially improvised comedy television show on Comedy Central that aired in summer 2006.  It began airing on The Comedy Channel in Australia in June 2007.  The series was produced by DreamWorks Television.

Premise 
Dog Bites Man is a parody of local news coverage, and follows the misadventures of a struggling news team from Spokane, Washington as they travel around the country producing news segments.  A mockumentary, the show incorporates scenes with the cast in traditional skits as well as them improvising with non-actors, who believe that they are an actual (albeit unusual) news crew.

Disclaimer 
Perhaps to lessen confusion pertaining to the true reality of the show, starting with episode five each episode began with the following message: "With the exception of the news team, the following episode contains real people who were not made aware they were being filmed as part of a comedy show."

Cast
 Zach Galifianakis as Alan Finger, the show's incompetent director.  Also a musician, in episode three he scores a hit song in Panama City, titled “Come on and Get It (Up in Dem Guts),” under the name “The Finger.”
 A.D. Miles as Marty Shonson, an intern who serves as a production assistant.
 Andrea Savage as Tillie Sullivan, the team's producer.
 Matt Walsh as Kevin Beekin, the star reporter for the news show, who used to date Tillie the producer and still has feelings for her.

Cancellation
When asked on Michael Showalter's webisode series The Michael Showalter Showalter if Comedy Central had cancelled the show, Zach Galifianakis replied “Yes, thank God.” He went on to explain that “messing with people” made him uncomfortable.
