Paul Palmer (born 18 October 1974 in Lincoln, England) is a former international freestyle swimmer for England and Great Britain.

Swimming career
Coached by Ian Turner at the City of Lincoln Pentaqua Swimming Club, Palmer qualified for the 200 m, 400 m and 1500 m freestyle at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, finishing a respectable 9th position (winning the "B" final) in the 200 m, and 10th position in the 400 m. After this success, in order to increase his chances of a medal at the following Atlanta games, Palmer relocated to Bath, along with Turner. Training in a 50 m pool, alongside other Olympic hopefuls at the performance centre allowed Palmer to further increase his swimming skills.

Palmer won the silver medal in the 400 m freestyle at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. A year later, at the 1997 European Aquatics Championships in Seville, he won gold in the 200 m freestyle.

He won the 2001 British Championship in the 100 metres freestyle, was six times winner of the 200 metres freestyle (1993, 1995, 1998–2001) and a six times winner of the 400 metres freestyle in (1992, 1993, 1998–2001).
