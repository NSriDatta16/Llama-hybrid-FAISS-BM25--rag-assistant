The 1988â€“89 OHL season was the ninth season of the Ontario Hockey League. The Hamilton Steelhawks move to Niagara Falls becoming the Niagara Falls Thunder. The Kingston Canadians rename themselves to the Kingston Raiders. The OHL awards the inaugural Bill Long Award for distinguished service to the OHL. Fifteen teams each played 66 games. The Peterborough Petes won the J. Ross Robertson Cup, defeating the Niagara Falls Thunder.

Relocation/Team Name Change

Hamilton Steelhawks to Niagara Falls Thunder

The Hamilton Steelhawks relocated their franchise to the city of Niagara Falls after four seasons in Hamilton. The club was renamed as the Niagara Falls Thunder and would play out of the Niagara Falls Memorial Arena. The Thunder would remain in the Emms Division.

This would be the first club since the Niagara Falls Flyers, who relocated to North Bay in 1982, to be based out of the city.

Kingston Canadians to Kingston Raiders

The Kingston Canadians were rebranded as the Kingston Raiders for the 1988-89 season. Kingston had used the Canadians name since they were announced as an expansion club in 1973. The club changed their colour scheme from red, blue and white to black, silver and white, effectively stealing the NFL's Los Angeles Raiders' name and color scheme.
