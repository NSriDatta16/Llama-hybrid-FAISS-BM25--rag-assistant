Alita is a brewing company based in Alytus, Lithuania, established in 1963.

Alita is one of the largest producers of alcoholic beverages in Lithuania. In 2004, when the state monopoly of liquor production in Lithuania was lifted, the company was privatised. In the same year, Alita acquired 95% stake of Lithuanian company Anykščių vynas, the oldest wine producer in Eastern Baltic region.

Alita produces naturally fermented sparkling grape vines, alcoholic cocktails, ciders, vodka, brandy, concentrated fruit juice and exports its products around the world.

In 2000, the distillery released a vodka named Putin Vodka, with a red, white, and blue label, which are the colours of the Russian flag. Sold only in Lithuania at that time, a company spokesperson said that the name  had its origin in the tree "putinas" (the Lithuanian name for the genus Viburnum).
