History
Stainton was named in the Domesday Book of 1086, when its manors were held by Earl Hugh of Acklam. It has been a settlement since pre-Anglo-Saxon times, its name is of mixed origin with Old Norse "stan" and Old English "tun", in Modern English stone-town.

St Peter and St Paul Church dates back to the 12th century and is grade II* listed. The former vicarage, Stainton House, dates from the 19th century and is Grade II listed. Stainton Methodist Church, on Meldyke Lane, dates from 1840. The original village school, now the Memorial Hall, dates from 1844.

The Stainton public house, on Meldyke Lane, was first licensed in 1897, celebrating its centenary in 1997.
