Alejandro Wiebe (born 1 June 1970), also known as  Marley, is an Argentine television host, comedian and producer.

Early life 
Wiebe and his older brother went to a private school. At one point, his mother had to ask for half a scholarship to keep Marley at that school. Marley repeated the second year of high school, because he failed in English.

Career 
In 2002 he worked at the Telefe channel, with the program MundoShow. The show was about trips to different parts of the world, accompanied by celebrities from the country and ended in 2003.

Throughout 2003 he hosted the program El show de la tarde, together with Florencia Peña. That same year, after having made the first season of his celebrity biographies program called Protagonistas únicos, he was chosen to host the galas of the first season of the reality show Operación triunfo. At the end of 2003, he began Por el mundo, as a replacement to MundoShow and that would last until 2007. In 2004, he made Odisea, en busca del escarabajo dorado, from Costa Rica, which would later have two more seasons: Odisea, en busca del tesoro perdido (2005) and Odisea, aventura argentina (2007). He was called to do three more seasons of Operación triunfo: 2004–2005, 2005–2006 and 2009.

Personal life 
On October 27, 2017, in Chicago, United States, his son Mirko Wiebe was born, through surrogacy. Marley chose the egg from a Russian donor and the womb from an African-American.
