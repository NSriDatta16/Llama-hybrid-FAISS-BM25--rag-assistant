History
In the 1920s, a loop route of New England Route 12 from south of Taftville to Jewett City via the village of Newent was a secondary state highway known as Highway 356. At the same time, the road connecting Jewett City and the town center of Voluntown was known as Highway 321. In the 1932 state highway renumbering, Route 138 was established from the piece of old Highway 356 from Newent to Jewett City and from the entire length of old Highway 321. Route 138 was extended to the Rhode Island state line in 1938 along former SR 420, where it connected with the westward extension of Rhode Island Route 138, which had originally ended in Newport. This resulted in a three-state Route 138 all the way to the Boston area. Route 138 in Connecticut was extended west to its current western terminus located at Route 97 in 1962 as part of the Route Reclassification Act.
