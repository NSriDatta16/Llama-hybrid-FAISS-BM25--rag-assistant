Yonkers Public Schools is a school district that serves all of Yonkers, New York, United States. It is governed by a mayorally appointed Board of Trustees.

Organization
The school district is organized and governed according to New York State Education Law. The Board of Education is the governing body of the school district. It consists of nine unpaid trustees, appointed by the mayor for five year terms. The trustees submit a budget to the city government, but have no taxing authority of their own. The Superintendent of Schools serves "subject to the pleasure of the Board of Education" for up to five years (contract can be extended). As the chief executive of the school district, they supervise and direct all other employees, makes decisions regarding curriculum and examination, and has a non-voting seat on the Board.

The current superintendent is Edwin M. Quezada, named interim after the sudden resignation of Michael V. Yazurlo in November 2015. In March 2015, Quezada was appointed as the new superintendent of schools at a Board of Education meeting.

Current board members include Steve Lopez, president; Rosalba Corrado Del Vecchio, vice-president; Gail Burns; Kevin Cacace; John Castanaro; Sheila Greenwald; Amjed I. Kuri, Rosemarie P. Linton, and Lawrence R. Sykes.
