The  Miss Idaho USA  pageant is a competition that selects the representative for the state of Idaho in the Miss USA pageant and the name of the title held by that winner. It is currently produced by Pageants NW Productions based in Puyallup, Washington since 2007.

Idaho's first placement at Miss USA came in 1964 with Dorothy Johnson, the first African-American semi-finalist. Their second placement came in 1997 when former Miss Idaho Teen USA and Miss Teen USA 1989 Brandi Sherwood placed first runner-up. She later became the first woman to be crowned both Miss USA and Miss Teen USA when she succeeded winner Brook Lee who became Miss Universe.  Sherwood has since pursued a career as an actress, and is a rotating model on The Price Is Right. The third came in 2004 when former Miss Idaho Teen USA 1999 Kimberly Glyn Weible made the top 10.  Their fourth was in 2009, when Melissa Weber placed in the top 15.

Idaho is currently third tied with North Carolina in number of former teens have competed in this pageant: nine, including Sherwood, and they are all from the same state.
