The Engineering Services Examination (ESE) is a combined standardized exam conducted annually by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) to recruit officers to various engineering services under the Government of India. It is held in four categories: Civil, Mechanical, Electrical, and Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering. The exam has three stages comprising objective, subjective and personality tests. Informally, the various services are often collectively known as Indian Engineering Services (IES). 

Officers recruited through ESE are mandated to manage and conduct activities in diverse technical fields. Government infrastructure includes railways, roads, defence, manufacturing, inspection, supply, construction, public works, power, and telecommunications. Appointments to these services are made by the President of India.

However, they can move to any cadre, organization, agency, department, ministry or public sector undertaking of the government of India. They are appointed to posts analogous to their present one, either on a fixed-term deputation basis (at least five years and extensible, after which the officer returns to their parent cadre) or an absorption basis where the official leaves the parent cadre for the new one.
