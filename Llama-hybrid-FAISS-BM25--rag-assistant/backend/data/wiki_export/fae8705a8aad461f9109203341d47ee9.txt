Founded in 1908, Al-Merrikh is one of the oldest football clubs in Africa, and have won the Sudan Premier League 22 times and Sudan Cup 26 times. The club shares a fierce rivalry with Al-Hilal, the games between them regularly selling out, as well as being the only other realistic challenger to the league crown.
