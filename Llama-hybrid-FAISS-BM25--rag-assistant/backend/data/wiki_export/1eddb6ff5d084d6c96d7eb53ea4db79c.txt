Location
The second stop on the Red Line north of the Chicago River, Chicago station lies in the central portion of the Near North Side.

History
The Chicago station opened on October 17, 1943, as part of the State Street subway, which forms the central portion of what is now the Red Line between  and  stations.

During the 1950s, the CTA implemented skip-stop service throughout the 'L' system. Under this service pattern, Chicago was designated as AB along with all other downtown stations (on the Red Line, those stops south of  and north of  were given AB designations). As a result, all trains stopped at these stations. The skip-stop service was ended due to budget cuts in the 1990s.

Renovation
From 1999 until 2001, Chicago underwent renovation and refurbishment, in line with other stations of the State Street subway. Work included making the station accessible to people with disabilities, with new elevators, redone flooring, retiling, and increased mezzanine space.

Unlike most State Street Subway stations, Chicago uses a side platform configuration with two tracks, also used at Grand/State and . There are entrances from street level at all corners of the intersection of North State Street and Chicago Avenue. One level below street level is a mezzanine containing fare controls and turnstiles, and the platforms are located beneath the mezzanine.
