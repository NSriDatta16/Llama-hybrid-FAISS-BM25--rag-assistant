 August 1 – The American Federation of Musicians authorizes a ban on recording by bands following a dispute over musicians' royalties; many country and popular music singers opt to continue recording without musical backing.

The former published four songs on January 28, 1943, all Fred Rose compositions under the pseudonym "Floyd Jenkins." "Low and lonely" and "Pins and Needles (In My Heart)" were two of the songs (see 1943 Top Hits of the Year).

Supplemental information came from 'Joel Whitburn's Pop Memories 1890-1954', record sales reported on the "Discography of American Historical Recordings" website, and other sources as specified.
