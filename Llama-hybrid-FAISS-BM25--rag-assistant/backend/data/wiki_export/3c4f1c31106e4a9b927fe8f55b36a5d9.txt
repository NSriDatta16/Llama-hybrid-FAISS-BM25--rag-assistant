Ubicom was a company which developed communications and media processor (CMP) and software platforms for real-time interactive applications and multimedia content delivery in the digital home. The company provided optimized system-level solutions to OEMs for a wide range of products including wireless routers, access points, VoIP gateways, streaming media devices, print servers and other network devices. Ubicom was a venture-backed, privately held company with corporate headquarters in San Jose, California.

History 
Ubicom was founded as Scenix Semiconductor in 1996. The company operated under that name until 1999. In 2000, Scenix became "Ubicom," a word derived from "ubiquitous communications".

 April 1999: Mayfield Fund leads $10 million equity investment in Scenix.
 November  2000: Scenix changes its name to Ubicom.
 November  2002: Intersil and Ubicom demonstrate world's first 802.11g wireless access point.
 March 2006: Ubicom secures $20 million in Series 3 funding, led by Investcorp Technology Ventures.
 March 2012: Ubicom is taken over by Qualcomm Atheros.

Products 
As Scenix and Ubicom, the company designed several families of microcontrollers, including:

 The SX Series of 8-bit microcontrollers, a product line which was partially compatible with Arizona Microchip devices and ran at up to 100 MHz, single cycle. This product was eventually sold to Parallax, who continued its production.
 The IP series of high performance media and Internet processors. These devices were designed to act as gateways for streaming media and data over wired and wireless links.

The Scenix/Ubicom processors relied on very high speed and low latency processing to emulate hardware interfaces in software such as interrupt-polled soft-UARTS. This reduced the size of the silicon chip and therefore the cost, but increased the complexity of the software required on the chip.

Ubicom developed its own architecture, the Ubicom32, and a real-time operating system (RTOS) for it. For example, the D-Link HD Media Router 3000 DIR-857 contains the Ubicom IP8000AU and the Western Digital WD N900 the Ubicom IP8260U CPU. The firmware is most probably Linux-based, maybe even OpenWrt-based, rather than Ubicom RTOS-based.

so it appears as some sort of low-frequency (600 MHz) multithreaded CPU (5 threads).
