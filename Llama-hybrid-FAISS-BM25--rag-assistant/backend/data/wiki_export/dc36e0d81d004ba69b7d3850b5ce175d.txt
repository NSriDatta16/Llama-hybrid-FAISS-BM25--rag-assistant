Felona e Sorona is an album by the Italian progressive rock band Le Orme. It was released in 1973.

Named one of the "finest examples of Italian progressive rock", it is a concept album pivoting on the story of two planets which revolve one around the other, without ever coming in contact. While Felona is shiny and flourishing, Sorona is dark and home to plagues and catastrophes; however, in the second part of the suite, the fate of the two planets is inverted.

Apart from two acoustic interludes, the music is mainly keyboard- and synth-driven, producing gloomy and spacey effects, especially in the opening "Sospesi nell'incredibile" and in the instrumental ending piece, "Ritorno al nulla" ("Return to Naught").

A version with English lyrics written by Peter Hammill of Van der Graaf Generator was issued in the U.K. by Charisma Records in 1974. The English title is Felona and Sorona.

The album was re-recorded in 2016.

Reception

Paul Stump, in his History of Progressive Rock, said Felona e Sorona is "a run-of-the-mill B-movie melodrama about warring planets, and didn't deserve [Peter] Hammill's (dashed-off) input."
