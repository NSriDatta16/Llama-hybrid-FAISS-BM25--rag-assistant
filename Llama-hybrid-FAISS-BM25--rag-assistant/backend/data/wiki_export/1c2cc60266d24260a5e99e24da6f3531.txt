"Dear Mr. President" is a song recorded by American singer Pink, featuring the Indigo Girls, for her fourth studio album I'm Not Dead (2006). It was written and produced by Pink and Billy Mann. The song is an open letter to the then-President of the United States, George W. Bush, criticizing several areas of his administration and terms in office, including the Iraq War, No Child Left Behind Act, opposition to same-sex marriage and the LGBT rights in general, perceived lack of empathy for poor and middle-class citizens, and his drinking and drug usage in college. Pink felt that it was one of the most important songs she had ever written.

Critically acclaimed, "Dear Mr. President" was released as the sixth and final international single from I'm Not Dead on April 2, 2007, by LaFace Records. A commercial success, it peaked atop the charts in Austria and Belgium, while reaching the top five in Australia, the Czech Republic, Germany and Switzerland.

Critical response
"Dear Mr. President" received mostly positive reviews from music critics. Entertainment Weekly's Chris Williams described the song "with its incongruous folkie social concern and Bush-baiting applause lines." The Los Angeles Times Natalie Nichols said that Pink taps her inner Ani DiFranco on the confrontational "Dear Mr. President". The New York Times Jon Pareles noted that the song is "well meaning", "hectoring" and that it "grow[s] even more sententious". PopMatters praised the single with long overview:  Rolling Stone's Barry Walters praises Pink for "writ[ing] a scathing letter in 'Dear Mr. President and "cooing righteous folk harmonies with Indigo Girls." Sal Cinquemani was mixed, writing that Dear Mr. President', which cleverly uses George W. Bush's own words against him, pales next to Missundaztoods 'My Vietnam.
