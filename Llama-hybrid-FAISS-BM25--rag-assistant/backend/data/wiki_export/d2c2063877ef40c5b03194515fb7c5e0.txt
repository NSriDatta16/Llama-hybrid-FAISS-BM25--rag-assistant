Academics

Undergraduate programs
Undergraduate programs are offered through the Heavener School of Business (Finance, General Studies, Information Systems, Management, and Marketing.) and the Fisher School of Accounting (Accounting). The Hough Graduate School of Business offers ten options for its MBA degree program (three full-time, three professional, 3 online and executive). One of UF MBA's three Professional options is a satellite program in South Florida at the UF MBA Sunrise Center in Sunrise, Florida.

Hough Graduate School of Business
William R. Hough of St. Petersburg, Florida, founder of the investment firm bearing his name and an alumnus of the college's first MBA class in 1948, donated $30 million to the college in 2007. It was the largest private gift ever received by the University of Florida at that time. The funds established an endowment to support teaching, academic programs, and enhancements in the graduate school of business, and provided a lead gift to construct a new building to house the graduate business programs named after Mr. Hough himself. The gift is also eligible for matching funds from the State of Florida Major Gifts Trust Fund and from the Alec P. Courtelis Facilities Enhancement Challenge Grant Program, potentially increasing the total value of the gift to $50 million.

International programs
International programs in more than 20 countries are offered to undergraduate and graduate students. The Master of International Business is the international graduate program offered. Students in this program may spend six weeks in a foreign country studying a specific industry, country, or global operation issue, but a study of at least one week abroad is required.

Entrepreneurship & Innovation Center
The college is home to the Entrepreneurship & Innovation Center. The center was founded in 2000 with the mission to introduce the concept of entrepreneurship to students and faculty, and offers one of the nation's only Master's of Science degrees in Entrepreneurship.

Ethics program
The ethics program at the Warrington College of Business is conducted by the Elizabeth B. & William F. Poe, Sr. Center for Business Ethics Education and Research.
