It was incorporated as a town by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 18, 1873, from portions of Franklin Township, and existed on its own until December 31, 1949, when it was returned to Franklin Township. The residents voted 119–28 in favor of dissolution on March 9, 1949.

The independent municipality of Millstone, New Jersey, a borough which is not part of Franklin Township, is located across the Millstone River, which is directly west of the Delaware and Raritan Canal.

East Millstone maintains its rural character into the 21st Century, with a firehouse, a post office and just a handful of local businesses.  The housing stock is also quite old, with no new development in the East Millstone section of Franklin Township in recent years.
