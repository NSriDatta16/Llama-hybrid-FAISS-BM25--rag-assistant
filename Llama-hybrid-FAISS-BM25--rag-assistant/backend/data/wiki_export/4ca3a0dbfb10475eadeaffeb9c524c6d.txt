The Colorado Convention Center (CCC) is a multi-purpose convention center located in Downtown Denver, Colorado.  At 2,200,000 square feet (total space) it is currently the 12th largest convention center in the United States. It opened in June 1990; the first event being the NBA draft for the Denver Nuggets. The convention center was expanded in 2004 to include several meeting rooms, two ballrooms and an indoor amphitheater. Since opening, the center hosts an average of around 400 events per year. Centrally located in the city, it has become one of Denver's many landmarks due to its architecture and is adjacent to the Denver Performing Arts Complex and is just blocks away from the Colorado State Capitol, Auraria Campus and the 16th Street Mall.  The CCC is directly served via light rail by RTD's Theatre District–Convention Center station.

Background

 The convention center opened in June 1990 with an exhibition hall, five meeting rooms and a main ballroom, totaling .

2004 expansion

Across Welton Street, on the historic registry, is the Denver Athletic Club.

2021 to 2023 expansion
Starting in mid-2021 the convention center began construction on a new expansion project.  Upon completion this will include new flexible meeting and ballroom space of approximately 85,000 square feet, 100,000 square feet of new pre-function and service space, and a 50,000 square foot outdoor terrace to be located on the roof of the existing convention center which will provide unobstructed views of both downtown and the mountains.  In all, approximately 235,000 square feet of usable space will be added bringing the total usable floor area to around 2.5 million when the project is completed in 2023.  This would make the facility the seventh largest in the U.S. using today's convention center statistics. The expansion will be completely integrated into the existing CCC footprint and involves no outward expansion of the current facility.

Public art
A public art collection is featured throughout the interior and exterior of the convention center. The most visible work is I See What You Mean by Lawrence Argent, located on the north east side of the convention center just to the left of the main entrance on 14th Street.

Bellco Theatre

The Bellco Theatre (formerly the Wells Fargo Theatre and The Lecture Hall) is an indoor amphitheatre located in the rear of the Colorado Convention Center. The venue opened March 1, 2005, with its first event by Ron White on March 5, 2005. The amphitheater was a part of the convention center's 2004 expansion plan. Originally known as The Lecture Hall, the venue was renamed in 2007 after banking and financial services company Wells Fargo. The bank purchased naming rights in September 2006 for nearly US$3 million, for a five-year period; beginning January 1, 2007. Beginning November 29, 2012, it was renamed from Wells Fargo Theatre after Bellco Credit Union, one of the largest credit unions in Colorado, purchased the naming rights in 2012.

Initially, the owner of the Paramount Theatre protested construction of the venue (along with the City Lights Pavilion) as he believed it would draw business away from the historic landmark. Since its opening, the venue has become one of the busiest mid-sized concert venues in Metro Denver, alongside the Fillmore Auditorium and 1stBank Center. It is primarily used for concerts desiring an "intimate" setting. The venue was named one of the "Top 100 Worldwide Theatres" by Pollstar in 2007 and 2011. The sculpture Indeterminate Line (2004) by Bernar Venet is located in front of the theatre.
