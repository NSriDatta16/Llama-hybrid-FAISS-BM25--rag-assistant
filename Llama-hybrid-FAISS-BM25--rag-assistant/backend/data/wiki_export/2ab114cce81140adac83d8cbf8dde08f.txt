Live Phish Vol. 10 was recorded live at the Veterans Memorial Auditorium in Columbus, Ohio on June 22, 1994. Some Phish hobbyists advance that the concert ranks among the five best the band has ever played, although the weight of reliable authority holds otherwise.

It features the band on their 1994 summer tour.  The group plays an experimental version of "Mike's Song," interpolating an early version of the Mike Gordon staple "Simple" and a jam based on the bass line and melody of The Allman Brothers Band's "Midnight Rider," as well as a version of the rarely-played "Icculus."

Bonus tracks include two songs from the Murat Theater in Indianapolis, Indiana on June 24, 1994.

Before the second set begins with "2001", Trey Anastasio informs the audience of the current score of Game 7 of the 1994 NBA Finals ("First quarter, Houston by 5"). The game is also mentioned during the Icculus narration ("Even if you're playing in the NBA finals, and you're winning by 5 points, [...] you'd damn well better read the book!"), and once more at the very end of the show ("After the third quarter: the Knicks 60, Houston 63!"). Apparently, this was in reference to a particularly tall (6'10"), and stoic fan in a Rockets jersey in the guitaristâ€™s sightline who had been jotting notes down throughout the show.
