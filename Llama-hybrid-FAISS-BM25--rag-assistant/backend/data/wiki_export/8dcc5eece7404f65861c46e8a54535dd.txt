The EMD F69PHAC was an experimental locomotive built in 1989 in a joint venture between EMD and Siemens. It was designed to test AC locomotive technology. Only two examples of this locomotive were made. The engine used the same carbody as the EMD F40PHM-2, with just a few spotting differences.

They were built for the United States Department of Transportation and loaned to Amtrak in 1990, sporting Phase III paint. They were returned to EMD and later used with the German ICE train demonstration that was on loan to Amtrak in 1992â€“1993. They were repainted in ICE paint. The two F69PHAC locomotives were again returned to EMD, where they were finally retired in 1999. Both of the locomotives still exist in a scrap yard, more specifically National Railway Equipment, in Mount Vernon, Illinois, stripped of numerous parts.
