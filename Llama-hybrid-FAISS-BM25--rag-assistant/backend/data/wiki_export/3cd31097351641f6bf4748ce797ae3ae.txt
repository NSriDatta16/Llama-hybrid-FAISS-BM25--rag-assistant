"Free Your Mind" is a song by American female group En Vogue from their second album, Funky Divas (1992). The track was recorded between December 1991 and January 1992, and it was composed and produced by Foster and McElroy. They were inspired by the Funkadelic song "Free Your Mind and Your Ass Will Follow." The guitar and bass tracks for the song were written and recorded by San Francisco-based guitarist Jinx Jones. The opening line: "Prejudice, wrote a song about it. Like to hear it? Here it go!", is adapted from a line originally used by David Alan Grier's character Calhoun Tubbs from Fox's In Living Color.

Issued as the third single from Funky Divas on September 24, 1992, "Free Your Mind" became a top-10 hit on the US Billboard Hot 100 and a top-20 hit on the UK Singles Chart. Billboard named the song No. 41 on their list of "100 Greatest Girl Group Songs of All Time". An alternative version of the song with different lyrics appears on the 1992 Summer Olympics compilation album Barcelona Gold.

Critical reception
Upon the release, Jennifer Bowles from Associated Press declared the song as a "plea for racial tolerance". Larry Flick from Billboard felt that it takes in "a more edgy direction" than in the past for the group. He remarked that placed "within a driving, guitar-anchored pop/rock setting, the group attacks well-crafted lyrics on racism with unrelenting passion and its trademark harmonies. Will jolt many at first, but will ultimately open many eyes." Dave Sholin from the Gavin Report commented, "Attacking prejudice head on, The Funky Divas offer advice to those who judge others by looks rather than action. Harmonies don't get any better than when these four incredible voices combine their talents." Connie Johnson from Los Angeles Times felt the song was a "pleasant surprise", "which confronts the prejudice even a funky diva faces, be it from store clerks--"I can't look without being watched!"—or those who don't understand that while they "might date another race or color, that doesn't mean I don't like my strong black brothers"." Pan-European magazine Music & Media noted that "the "Jackies" of all trades are breaking all the barriers in radio land", describing the song as "funk rock" and a "George Clinton cover as colourful as his dyed hair". 

Gerald Martinez from New Sunday Times called the song "storming", and said it "combines hard rock riffng with funk while En Vogue wail away with awesome power." Parry Gettelman from Orlando Sentinel wrote, "'Free Your Mind' owes a small lyrical debt to George Clinton and a large musical debt to LaBelle - not bad places from which to borrow. There's a brief, funny spoken intro that parodies an In Living Color sketch, and the quartet slams into a denunciation of prejudice of all sorts: "I might date another race or color/ Doesn't mean I don't like my strong black brothers"." A reviewer from People Magazine viewed it as a "the Pointer Sisters-meet-Van Halen rocker". Danyel Smith from Rolling Stone described it as "guitar-ravaged" Cheo H. Coker from Stanford Daily felt that En Vogue's "foray into rock 'n' roll [is] completely unsuited for the group, reminiscent of Janet Jackson's "Black Cat". While the song has great message, black rock is better left to the black rockers."

Retrospective response
In an 2017 retrospective review, Quentin Harrison from Albumism described "Free Your Mind" as "a searing rock number that challenged racism, sexism and other social phobias head on was all at once, smart, sexy and provocative." AllMusic's review critic, Jose F. Promis, voted the single very favorable and rated the Funky Divas album its highest rating at five. He also declared the track as a "hard rock smash". Another editor, Stephen Thomas Erlewine, described it as "swaggering". In his 2009 review, Daryl Easlea for BBC remarked that the song borrows from "heavy metal". In 2007, Laura Checkoway from Vibe called it a "rock-ish anthem with a George Clinton-lifted chorus".

Commercial performance
"Free Your Mind" debuted at number 89 on the US Billboard Hot 100 the week of September 12, 1992. Within one week, it jumped to number 45, then to number 25, and continued to make impressive strides until it eventually peaked at number 8 the week of October 31, 1992. Altogether, "Free Your Mind" spent 16 weeks in the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100. It reached the top twenty in the UK, where it was released as a double A-side single with "Giving Him Something He Can Feel". It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in late 1992.

Music video and other notable performances
The song is known for its innovative, award-winning music video, directed by Mark Romanek with production design by Nigel Phelps and art direction by Brad Hartmaier. On March 21, 1992, En Vogue performed "Free Your Mind" on Saturday Night Live. On January 21, 1993, En Vogue performed the song on a sixth-season episode of the NBC sitcom A Different World, where they guest-starred as Vernon Gaines' nieces.
