Ski resort 
Limone Piemonte is one of the oldest ski resorts in Italy. The Riserva Bianca (eng: White Reserve) consists in about 80 kilometres of trails, served by 1 gondola lift, 10 chairlifts, 3 ski lifts and 2 carpets: it connects three different ski areas (Limone-Sole, Tre Amis, Limonetto) while a fourth one (Limone-Cros), too far from the other three, was abandoned in 1998. The resort hosted several editions of the FIS Alpine Ski World Cup and the FIS Snowboard World Cup. Before the beginning of the 2006 Winter Olympics its trails had been chosen as an alternative location for skiing and snowboarding training and competitions, in case of lack of snow in the Susa Valley, so they had been homologated to the standards and equipped with newer chairlifts.
Moreover, thanks to the presence of untouched fields and to the heavy winter snowfall of this section of the Alps, Limone is becoming more and more famous for off-piste skiing.
