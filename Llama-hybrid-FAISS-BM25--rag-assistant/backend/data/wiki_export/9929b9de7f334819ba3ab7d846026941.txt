Les Maroons de Lachine were a Canadian Junior ice hockey team from Lachine, Quebec, Canada.  It started as a franchise in the Metropolitaine leagues in 1953 in both the Junior A and Junior B divisions.  Later, in 1995, the Pierrefonds Lions of the Quebec Junior A league moved to Lachine and resumed use of the name.

Following the 2014â€“15 season the Maroon franchise was sold to investors of the Gatineau Mustangs. The Mustangs were former members of the Eastern Ontario Junior B Hockey League. This league re-organized and re-branded itself as the Central Canada Hockey League Tier 2 and eliminated 6 teams, one of which was the Gatineau Mustangs. The re-located Maroons became known as the Gatineau Flames.
