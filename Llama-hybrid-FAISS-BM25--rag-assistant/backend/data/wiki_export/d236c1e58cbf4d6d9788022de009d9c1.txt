History

The station was designed by Murdoch Paterson and built by the Sutherland and Caithness Railway, opening the line in 1874. A wrought-iron turntable,  in diameter, was installed at the station by the Railway Steel and Plant Company of Manchester, along with an engine shed capable of housing four engines and a special loading bank for the loading of herring for the southern markets.

On 1 July 1903, the Wick and Lybster Light Railway was opened, and Wick became a junction station. The last trains to Lybster ran in 1944, although the line was not officially closed until 1951.

Until 2000, trains from  would split in half at , with one portion going to Wick and the other to . This practice ended when s were introduced on the line  since then all services run in full between Inverness and Wick via Thurso, in both directions, adding up to 30 minutes to journey times to and from Wick.

Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip visited the station in 2002, as part of a tour for Elizabeth's Golden Jubilee.
