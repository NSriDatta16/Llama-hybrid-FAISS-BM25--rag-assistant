Release
The game was released on March 31, 1997, for Windows and Macintosh.

Reception

All Game Guide gave the game a score of 3 out of 5, stating: "This program makes typing into a computer game, but it is definitely more suited for kids than adults. To kids, Mario is friendly and funny, to adults, he is sugary and overdone. Good for kids, but adults should probably find a more mature typing program". MacWorld heavily criticized the game's gameplay and graphics, and recommended that players play Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing instead.
