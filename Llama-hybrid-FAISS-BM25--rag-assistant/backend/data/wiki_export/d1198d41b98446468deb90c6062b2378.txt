Game summary
After both sides failed to put up a single point in the first quarter, the Admirals drew first blood by blocking a 36-yard field goal attempt by Galaxy kicker Daron Alcorn. Afterwards, Admirals' quarterback Will Furrer put together a 12-play, 73-yard drive that was capped off with a five-yard pass to wide receiver Ernie Jones. However, the Galaxy managed to set up a good kick return to put themselves on Amsterdam's 46-yard line. On just the third play of the drive, Galaxy quarterback Paul Justin connected with fellow wide receiver Bobby Olive on an 11-yard pass. Unfortunately, the extra point attempt was no good, as Amsterdam led Frankfurt 7–6 at halftime. In the third quarter, the Galaxy managed to take the lead for the first time of the game, with a 4-play, 26-yard drive that ended with a 4-yard pass to Olive. Afterward, the Galaxy increased their lead with a 4-play, 38-yard drive that ended with a 31-yard pass from Paul Justin to Mike Bellamy. In the fourth quarter, Admirals running back T. C. Wright fumbled the ball, setting up a 3-play, 44-yard drive that helped increase Frankfurt's lead, with a 30-yard run by Nathaniel Bolton (extra point attempt missed). Down 26–7, the Admirals needed points and they needed them fast. Furrer was able to put up a 9-play, 78-yard drive that ended with a one-yard touchdown run by T. C. Wright. Afterwards, the Admirals got a 13-play, 58-yard drive that ended with a nine-yard pass to Wright. Following the touchdown, Furrer connected with wide receiver Sanjay Beach for the two-point conversion. Amsterdam recovered the onside kick and had 34 seconds to come up with a touchdown; however, key passes into the endzone fell incomplete, preserving Frankfurt's four-point lead and giving the Galaxy their first World Bowl title.
