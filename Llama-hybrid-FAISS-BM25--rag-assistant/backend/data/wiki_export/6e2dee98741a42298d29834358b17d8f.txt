Synopsis 
The show is a "series of self-contained vignettes".

Act I
As the curtain rises, each character enters and finds Snoopy atop his doghouse, and they all describe "The World According To Snoopy". Later, Lucy and Charlie Brown have a brief discussion of why he has chosen Snoopy for a pet ("Snoopy's Song"), which almost leads to Lucy getting Charlie Brown to buy a new pet. Snoopy, hoping to please his owner, decides to try to follow Charlie Brown's directions better. Meanwhile, Woodstock begins his day ("Woodstock's Theme"), but to his dismay, he seems to have fallen in love with a worm. Peppermint Patty has similar problems with love, wishing that she could be prettier to impress Charlie Brown ("Hurry Up, Face").

In school, the group hopes that the teacher will not call on them to answer a question about the famous poet Edgar Allan Poe. The girls are having trouble, while the boys are confident ("Edgar Allan Poe"). Linus says everything correct, with Charlie Brown saying the opposite.  On Mother's Day, Snoopy reflects on how much he misses his lost mother ("Mother's Day"). Meanwhile, Sally, Peppermint Patty, and Lucy have a happy discussion on what they've learned in their lives ("I Know Now").

On Halloween, Linus, along with a reluctant Snoopy, awaits the arrival of the Great Pumpkin in the pumpkin patch ("The Vigil"). To his dismay, the great pumpkin never arrives, like every year. The next morning, the group looks up at the clouds where they imagine Mount Rushmore, dragons and twenty milk-white horses ("Clouds"), but when asked what he sees, Charlie Brown can only sadly say, "A horsie and a duckie."

Snoopy enters as the Easter Beagle to hand out bright Easter eggs to everyone, except Charlie Brown. A dejected Charlie Brown, musing on the new independence of his pet, is left alone ("Where Did That Little Dog Go?"). Similar events progress, and Lucy, Peppermint Patty, and Sally try to sell Snoopy for less than a dime ("Dime a Dozen"), though Snoopy is quick to realize that he must mend his ways and wishes that he could start over ("Daisy Hill").

Life soon goes back to normal and the gang seems to have forgotten those events. They are however, beginning to think, as Lucy says, that they live "in the most boring place in the whole stupid world!", all of them asking the same question, if anything good will happen. They decide to organize a party, but Snoopy isn't allowed. Snoopy decides he will have his own party and still will have a fun time ("When Do the Good Things Start?")

Act II
The show reopens with the whole gang thinking about how friends help each other all the time ("Friend"). Unfortunately, Playbeagle (a play on Playboy) has decided not to publish Snoopy's manuscript, but Snoopy's spirits remain undaunted even amid the throes of rejection, as he begins his new story ("The Great Writer"). The story is only a spoof off classic movies, and is rejected by the writers.
Later, Peppermint Patty sarcastically expresses her love for Charlie Brown ("Poor Sweet Baby"), but soon says that "it'll never happen". Sally asks Linus if he can go to the movies, but he rejects. However, Sally is still confident that one day Linus will marry her ("Husband Material")

Sally, seeing leaves fall from a tree, remarks that there is something to learn from the cycle of life ("Don't Be Anything Less Than Everything You Can Be"). While sitting atop his doghouse, Snoopy receives a letter delivered by Woodstock: he has become Head Beagle. Snoopy celebrates his success happily, ready for anything ("The Big Bow-Wow").

Later, the gang begins a discussion of Christmas and innocence. Then, looking up at the starry sky, Charlie Brown remarks "I think that there must be a tiny star out there that is my star." They reflect on their friendships and realize that if one person changes their world, they might as well be friends forever ("Just One Person"). Linus remarks to Charlie Brown, "Well, as Lucy always says, he isn't much of a dog." Snoopy replies, "But, after all, who is?" After the show, a bow is sung with a reprise of "Don't Be Anything Less Than Everything You Can Be".

Response
In his review of the 1982 Lamb's Theatre production, Mel Gussow wrote: "If the musical [Snoopy!!!] were nose-to-nose with Mr. (David) Garrison's performance, it would be a subject for celebration. Sadly, this sequel ...is a hand-me-down...the show meanders all over play-school country. The book, which is credited to three individual writers as well as a task force called 'Charles M. Schulz Creative Associates' is a pastepot of Peanuts dialogue that wanders into various other neighborhoods in order to accommodate the score."

In the 1983 West End production The Guardian reviewed "The astringency of the jokes is belied by Hal Hackady's lyrics which place great stress on the American success ethic... This innocent-looking revue certainly makes its point that the child is father of the wisecracking man; but I still can't help feeling that brevity is the soul of strip".

In reviewing the 2004 London production, the Whats On Stage reviewer noted "...this is a show for all ages and all seasons - and as a sunny summer's entertainment, could hardly be bettered. The musical retains the fast, sharp comic appeal and instantly recognisable characterisations of the line-drawing originals, but also irresistibly brings it to human form by buoying up its snapshot scenes with the tuneful ease of the light, bright melodies of composer Larry Grossman's settings to Hal Hackaday's apt, witty lyrics."
