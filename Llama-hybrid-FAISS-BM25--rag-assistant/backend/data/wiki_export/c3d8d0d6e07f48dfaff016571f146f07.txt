In 1995, upon celebrating the 50th anniversary of his ordination, Head reflected on his appointment as Bishop of Buffalo. Head is re-quoted in a WBFO article by Eileen Buckley, as well as on a page announcing his death on the Diocese of Buffalo website, in regard to his appointment as Bishop of Buffalo by Pope Paul VI, stating:

 In 1973, Pope Paul, VI, could have sent this church of Buffalo a wiser bishop, a holier bishop, a bishop more astute in administration, or a bishop more gifted in public speaking. But, I don't think Pope Paul could have sent the Diocese a bishop who had tried harder to love you and to serve you.

Head ordained 124 men to the priesthood during his time as Bishop of Buffalo.  It has been estimated that Head confirmed 50,000 young people to the Church during his 22 years of service in Buffalo.

He continued to be active in health care ministry, and other ministries throughout his retirement.   Prior to his death, Head was honored with a retirement home for priests that was named  the Bishop Edward D. Head Residence, in Lackawanna, New York.
