Spanish Train and Other Stories is the second album by Chris de Burgh, released by A&M Records in 1975.

Releases in some markets, like in North America, used different cover art from those in Europe. Rather than the simple white-on-black text of the European releases, the North American releases depicted an image of a distant train moving along under an evening sky.

Ban in South Africa
The title track is a story about a train carrying the souls of the dead to the Underworld. God and Lucifer are playing Poker – gambling with the souls. Lucifer cheats and wins the game. The song finishes with the stanza:

The song was deemed blasphemous in South Africa, and a ban was ordered. A&M records sued to get the ban overturned – the suit was eventually successful. However, while the suit was in progress, A&M released the album under the title Lonely Sky and Other Stories (without "Spanish Train"). This album is considered a collector's item today – copies are extremely rare. Perversely, the ban only applied to the LP record, so the cassette issue of "Spanish Train" was always freely available.
