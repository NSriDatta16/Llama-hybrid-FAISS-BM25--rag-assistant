EEVIAC Operational Index and Reference Guide, Including Other Modern Computational Devices is the 5th full-length studio album by Man or Astroman?. E.E.V.I.A.C. is an acronym and stands for "Embedded Electronic Variably Integrated Astro Console" (also known as the "EEVIAC Mainframe Supercomputer") and is a play on ENIAC, which is sometimes hailed as the first modern computer.

Man or Astroman? actually built a mockup of a supercomputer to have onstage for this album.
