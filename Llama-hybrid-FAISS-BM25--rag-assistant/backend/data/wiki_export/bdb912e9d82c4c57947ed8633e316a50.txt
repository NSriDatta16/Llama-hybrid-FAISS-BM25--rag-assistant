Straffan Gaelic Football Club is a Gaelic football club in Straffan, County Kildare, Ireland.

History

A revival occurred with the appointment of Billy Farrell as first team manager in 1999, and the team won the Junior B championship in 2001. In 2005 the first team won promotion to division 2 of the Kildare Senior Football League, while the second team also won promotion to division 2 of the Junior Football League. Straffan began to gather momentum ever since promotion to division 2. priority for the club was to win the Junior football championship which had been a scorn for the club over the years. A junior final appearance was made in 2006 but Straffan were narrowly beaten by Nurney GFC. Numerous semi final appearances were made after that but with little success. However, in 2009 under the management of Liam McLoughlin Straffan finally broke the hoodoo and won the Junior football championship with a last minute goal by Andy O'Neill.  Straffan fields 2 adult teams at the moment and forms St Edward’s along with Ardclough and Rathcoffey for underage purposes and St Edwards fields teams at all levels from Under 9 to Under 21.
