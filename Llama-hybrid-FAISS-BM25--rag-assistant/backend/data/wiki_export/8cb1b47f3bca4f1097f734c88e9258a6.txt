Academic programs

As a part of the Downcounty Consortium, Einstein offers five "academies", which are academic programs that concentrate in specific fields. These include the Academy of Finance, Business, and Marketing; the International Baccalaureate Program; the Visual and Performing Arts Academy; the Renaissance Academy; and recently the Teacher's Academy. It is also home to Montgomery County's Visual Art Center.

Einstein is home to an International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Program, which approaches education from a global perspective and allows students to take high-level classes in pursuit of a specialized diploma.
