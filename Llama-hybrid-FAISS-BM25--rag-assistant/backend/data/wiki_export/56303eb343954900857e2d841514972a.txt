Biography 
He was elected Metropolitan of Kos (1867), Rhodes (1876–1888), Iraklia (1888–1897) and Chalkedon (1897–1913).  On 28 January 1913, he was elected Ecumenical Patriarch.

He was one of the pioneers, in the years 1886–1897, of the efforts for the return of the exiled Patriarch Ioakim III the Magnificent.

He was forced to resign from the throne on 12 October 1918, retiring to Kadikoy, where he died and was buried in December 1920. He was the last Patriarch who received the imperial veranda, the state's recognition of the Sultan.
