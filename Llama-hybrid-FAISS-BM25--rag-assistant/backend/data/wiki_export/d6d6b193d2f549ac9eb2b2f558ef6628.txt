Kudos was a milk chocolate granola cereal bar produced by Mars, Incorporated. 

When initially launched in 1986, there were three varieties: nutty fudge, chocolate chip, and peanut butter. Other future flavors would include bits of Mars candy including Snickers, M&Ms, and Dove chocolate. The original formulation of the bar was much more candy bar-like with less focus on the granola, although the original intention was to offer a healthier candy bar alternative.

The original slogan was "Kudos, I'm yours!"

Mars, Incorporated, stated in a 2017 Facebook post that the bars had officially been discontinued. As of 2020, there were no plans to revive the product.
