Notting Hill and Ealing High School is an independent school for girls aged 4 – 18 in Ealing, London. Founded in 1873, it is one of the 26 schools that make up the Girls' Day School Trust.  It has a Junior Department of 310 girls (ages 4–11) and a Senior Department of 600 girls (ages 11–18). The current Headmaster is Mr Matthew Shoults. Ms Bevan is Head of the Junior School.

History 
Since being founded in 1873, the school has changed both its location and its name.  When the Girls' Day School Trust, then the Girls' Public Day School Trust, was formed in 1872, it established its first two schools in West London. In January 1873, the Trust opened Chelsea High School (a predecessor of Kensington Preparatory School) to serve the area immediately to the west of the centre of the city and nine months later, Notting Hill High School which was to serve families in the area to the north of Hyde Park. Harriet Morant Jones was the founding head who looked after ten pupils assisted by her sister. Harriet Jones retired in 1900. Controversially, Ethel Gavin was appointed instead of an internal heir apparent and resignations followed. Gavin was a "capable and experienced headmistress" until 1908 when she moved to the GPDST school at Wimbledon.

The school originally occupied premises in Norland Square but outgrew these and moved to Ealing in 1931 when it became known as Notting Hill and Ealing High School for Girls. Following the Education Act 1944 it became a direct grant grammar school in 1946. When the direct grant scheme was abolished in 1976, it became an independent school.

Present day 
The school numbers 910 girls in 2018/19. Entry to the school is by assessment normally at ages 4+, 7+, 11+ or 16+. The school has a strong academic tradition. In 2018, 91.65% of grades at GCSE were A*/A and 98.84% were A*-B. At A Level 65% of grades were A*/A and 94% were A*-B.

In the 2019 Times School League Tables, NHEHS featured in the Top 20 for both GCSE and A-Levels and is one of only 10 schools in the country to achieve this accolade.

In 2017 the Junior School was awarded "Independent Prep School of the Year" by the Sunday Times' Parent Power Guide, observing that the school "proves you can have both outstanding academic success and a relaxed, happy school where girls are encouraged to be individuals and to express themselves".

And in their last report, the ISI inspectors reported, "pupils' achievement in curricular and extra-curricular activities and their learning is exceptional as is their attainment in national tests at age 11 and at A Level".

Former pupils keep in touch with each other through the Old Girls' Association.

School fees
In 2018/19 fees are £4,771 per term (Junior School) and £6,187 per term (Senior School). Academic and Music Scholarships are awarded at 11+ and 16+ and there are further scholarships at 16+.
