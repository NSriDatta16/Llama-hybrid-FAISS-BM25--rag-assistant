James Patrick Keeler is an American rock music drummer from Cincinnati, who is best known for playing in The Greenhornes, The Raconteurs, and The Afghan Whigs. He plays with both traditional and matched grips.

Recording career
Keeler has played with garage rock band The Greenhornes along with vocalist Craig Fox and Jack Lawrence, since 1996. The Greenhornes have released five albums to date, 'The Greenhornes', 'Gun for You', 'Dual Mono', 'East Grand Blues EP' and '★★★★'. Their song 'There Is an End', featuring Holly Golightly, was used in the Jim Jarmusch film 'Broken Flowers', starring Bill Murray.

In 2004, Keeler played drums on the  Loretta Lynn album Van Lear Rose in the band that album producer Jack White put together. The band called themselves The Do Whaters, and also featured Lawrence on bass and Dave Feeny on pedal steel guitar. Despite containing three future Raconteurs, The Do Whaters share little in terms of musical styling. The Raconteurs are a band formed with long-time friends Brendan Benson, Jack White of The White Stripes and "Little" Jack Lawrence. They released their debut album, Broken Boy Soldiers, in April 2006 and its follow-up Consolers of the Lonely in March 2008.

Keeler also played two shows with fellow garage rockers The Dirtbombs in 2004. At one point, Keeler could have been a candidate as the drummer of Wolfmother, but the band's record company asked guitarist/vocalist Andrew Stockdale to hold auditions.

As of March 2015, Keeler is touring with the Afghan Whigs.

Keeler plays Ludwig drums and uses DW stands and Tama Speed Cobra pedals. He also recently switched to using Zildjian A and K Dark and Light cymbals, having previously used Paiste Giant Beat cymbals.
