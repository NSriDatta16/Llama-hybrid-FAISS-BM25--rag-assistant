John Allen Kuhn (born September 9, 1982) is an American former professional football player who was a fullback in the National Football League (NFL). After playing college football for Shippensburg University, he was signed by the Pittsburgh Steelers as an undrafted free agent in 2005. Kuhn earned a Super Bowl ring in his first year with the Steelers in Super Bowl XL over the Seattle Seahawks, and another as a member of the Green Bay Packers, against his former team, five years later in Super Bowl XLV. He was named to three Pro Bowls, all as a Packer.

Early life
Kuhn is the son of John Kuhn and Patti Duffy. He was a four-sport athlete at Dover Area High School in York County, Pennsylvania, playing football, basketball, baseball and track. In football, he played both offense and defense for the Eagles, rushing for 2,242 yards and 20 touchdowns while also playing inside linebacker. He was the first Dover player to rush for over 1,000 yards in back-to-back seasons. Kuhn did not receive any Division I scholarship offers to play college football.

College career
A Northeast Region finalist for the Harlon Hill Trophy given to the top player in NCAA Division II as a senior, Kuhn was selected to play in the 2005 Whataburger Cactus Bowl on January 7 as a Division II all-star for the North team. He was named PSAC Western Division Offensive Player of the Year in 2003 and was a three-time First-team All-Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference (PSAC) Western Division selection.

In 2004, the Raiders won their first PSAC Western Division Championship since 1988 and advanced to the NCAA Division II national football championship second round with a 10–2 record, marking the team's first 10-win regular season since 1981.

Kuhn holds 27 school records and six PSAC records. He finished his career with 4,685 yards rushing, 910 carries, 53 touchdowns, 5,300 all-purpose yards and 26 games with at least 100 yards rushing, all school records. Kuhn led the team in rushing for the third-straight season as a senior and is the only player in team history to total over 1,000 yards rushing in three-straight seasons.

A standout in the classroom, Kuhn was a First-team ESPN The Magazine/College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA) Academic All-America in both 2003 and 2004 and was named First-team Academic All-District II three-straight years. He was also chosen as a PSAC Fall Top Ten Award winner as both a junior and senior, the first Shippensburg male student-athlete to have received the award twice.

Kuhn ranked 17th in Division II in rushing yards per game and was 34th in all-purpose yards. He was chosen as a First-team American Football Coaches Association (AFCA) All-American and Third-team Associated Press (AP) Little All-American.

Kuhn graduated with a chemistry degree in December 2004. During the summer of 2003, he had worked as a lab technician for the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, and during the summer of 2004 he worked for Johnson & Johnson.

In 2013, he was inducted into the Shippensburg University athletic hall of fame by his long time friend, roommate, and 3rd string safety Kevin Boyle.

Professional career

Pittsburgh Steelers

2005
He was signed by the Pittsburgh Steelers as an undrafted free agent on April 29, 2005. He was released prior to the season, but on November 30 was assigned to the team's practice squad for the final five games.

2006
Kuhn won a Super Bowl ring on February 5, 2006 as a member of the Steelers in Super Bowl XL with their 21–10 win over the Seattle Seahawks.

On October 6, 2006, he was selected in the 8th round of the Arena Football League's Expansion Draft by the New Orleans VooDoo. His rights had been owned by the San Jose SaberCats, although he never played for them or in the Arena League.

Green Bay Packers

2007
In 2007, Kuhn was signed to the active roster of the Green Bay Packers on September 2, a day after being released by the Steelers. He joined Rob Davis as Shippensburg University graduates on the Packers roster. Davis has subsequently retired and joined the Packers front office staff. Kuhn played in all 16 games for the Packers, primarily on special teams and as a blocking fullback, starting one game, on December 30 versus the Detroit Lions. He had no carries for the year, with two passes caught for seven yards. However, he recorded 11 special teams tackles.

The Packers re-signed Kuhn, who was an exclusive rights free agent, on March 19, 2008.

2008
In 2008, he again played in all 16 games, including three starts. For the season, he ran eight times for 10 yards and caught four passes for 21 yards and scored his first two NFL touchdowns. The first was on October 12 on a one-yard pass from Aaron Rodgers to put the Packers up 24–10 on the Seahawks. He scored his first rushing touchdown on a one-yard run on November 24 against the New Orleans Saints to put the Packers up 7–0. Also for the season, he recorded 12 special teams tackles.

2009
In 2009, Kuhn played in 14 games, including six starts, rushing eight times for 18 yards with seven receptions for 47 yards, and he scored three touchdowns. Two came in one game on September 27 against the St. Louis Rams, with a 1-yard TD run and a 10-yard pass from Rodgers. He recorded 11 special teams tackles.

2010
In 2010, Kuhn played in all 16 games again, with two starts, and put up his most productive season to date. Kuhn was selected to his first Pro Bowl, while he rushed 84 times for 281 yards and four touchdowns and had 15 receptions for 97 yards for another two touchdowns. He recorded seven special teams tackles.

He also appeared in all four Packers postseason games with one start, with a total of six rushes for eight yards and one touchdown and six receptions for 53 yards and one touchdown. He also became the first Packer to have both a rushing and a receiving touchdown in one playoff game since James Lofton in 1983.

2011

In 2011, he appeared in all 16 games for the fourth time in five seasons, with three starts. He was named a starting fullback for the Pro Bowl and was named second-team All-Pro by the Associated Press. He rushed 30 times for 78 yards with 15 receptions for 77 yards, and matched his career high with six total touchdowns. In the Packers NFC Divisional game versus the New York Giants, he scored the Packers' first touchdown with an eight-yard catch from Rodgers. He left the game in the third quarter with a knee injury.

2012
In 2012, Kuhn played 14 games (missing two games with a hamstring injury) with three starts, rushing 23 times for 63 yards and tying his career high with 15 receptions for a career-high 148 yards while adding three special teams tackles.

In the NFC Wild Card game versus the Minnesota Vikings, he scored touchdowns on consecutive possessions, one via the ground and one on a pass. He was named a Pro Bowl alternate.

2013
In 2013, Kuhn played in 15 games with six starts. He rushed 10 times for 38 yards with one touchdown and caught 13 passes for 81 yards. He gained national recognition in the season's finale versus the Chicago Bears to decide the NFC North championship and a berth in the playoffs. With the Packers trailing 28–27, facing a fourth-and-8 from the Bears 48 yard line, it appeared that Bears defensive end Julius Peppers would sack Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers. However, Kuhn quickly shifted across the formation and made a cut block on Peppers, allowing Rodgers to escape and throw a game-winning touchdown pass to Randall Cobb.

During the January 5 wild card game against the San Francisco 49ers, Kuhn had a one-yard run touchdown run in the fourth quarter to give the Packers a 17–13 lead. However, the 49ers eventually won the game, 23–20. This marked the 5th consecutive postseason in which Kuhn has scored either a passing or rushing TD.

2014
Kuhn became a free agent after the 2013 season; however, on April 3, 2014, he signed a one-year contract with the Packers. In the regular season, he played in all 16 games with 24 carries for 85 yards and one touchdown, plus four receptions for 23 yards. He was named 2014 first-team All-Pro fullback by the Associated Press.

2015
On April 13, 2015, Kuhn re-signed with the Packers on a one-year deal.

New Orleans Saints
On August 5, 2016, Kuhn was signed by the New Orleans Saints.

During a Week 3 loss, Kuhn scored his first touchdown as a Saint on a 3-yard rush against the Atlanta Falcons. On October 2, 2016, he scored 2 rushing touchdowns and added his first receiving touchdown as a Saint in a 35–34 comeback win over the San Diego Chargers. 

On February 3, 2017, Kuhn re-signed a one-year contract with the Saints. On September 3, 2017, Kuhn was released by the Saints, but was re-signed three days later. He was again released on September 21, 2017, but re-signed four-days later. On September 28, 2017, he was placed on injured reserve after tearing his biceps in practice.

Retirement
On March 6, 2019, Packers general manager Brian Gutekunst announced that Kuhn had informed the team of his decision to retire, and his wish to do so as a Packer.  The team signed him to a one-day contract and Kuhn filed for retirement.

Personal life
Kuhn's wife, Lindsey (Incorvati), is a former soccer player and sprinter on the track team at Shippensburg University. They live in Wisconsin together.

Kuhn is active in Packers charitable events and is a two-time participant in the NFL's Business Management and Entrepreneur Program at the Harvard Business School and the Wharton School of Business.

Kuhn became a fan favorite in Green Bay. Whenever Kuhn carried the ball, Packers' fans called out his surname "Kuuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhn," which was sometimes mistaken for booing. This continued during his time as a New Orleans Saint. The chant originated at Shippensburg each time he touched the ball, but Kuhn gained national fame after scoring three touchdowns in week 16 of 2010 against the New York Giants. The Packers won, 45–17.

In 2013, he co-starred in a national Campbell's Soup commercial with teammate Clay Matthews, with both in full Packers uniforms.

In 2019, Kuhn joined the Packers TV Network as a commentator.
