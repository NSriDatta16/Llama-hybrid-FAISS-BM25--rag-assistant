No One Rides for Free is the debut album by the stoner rock band Fu Manchu. The album was produced by former Kyuss member Brant Bjork, who would eventually become Fu Manchu's drummer for a short tenure. It was the band's only album to feature bassist Mark Abshire. A twenty-year anniversary edition was released in 2014.

Reception

Drowned in Sound reckoned it inferior to Daredevil, but still authentic stoner rock. Debaser also gave the reissue a positive review.  The Rough Guide to Rock called it a "classic".
