Burladingen had a seal as early as 1534, making it the oldest in the County of Zollern, but it vanished from usage by 1541. The township was given the right to use a seal again in 1710 after an appeal to the Prince of Hohenzollern-Hechingen in 1702. The 1930 pattern was approved as the municipal coat of arms, with Zollern's black-white tincture, by the Federal Ministry of the Interior on 1 June 1956.
