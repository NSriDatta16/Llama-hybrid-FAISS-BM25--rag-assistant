A Long Hot Summer is the third solo and fifth overall studio album by American rapper Masta Ace. It was released on August 3, 2004 via M3 Macmil Music. Production was handled by Dams & Sla, Dug Infinite, Xplicit, 9th Wonder, DJ Serious, DJ Spinna, DR Period, Marco Polo, Khrysis, Koolade, and Ace himself. It features guest appearances from eMC, Leschea, Apocalypse, Big Noyd, Ed O.G., Jean Grae, Mr. Lee G, The Beatnuts and Rahzel.

The concept story follows Ace, an underground rapper through his "Long Hot Summer" in Brooklyn, accompanied by buddy Fats Belvedere. Ace ventures through the Brooklyn streets and goes out on tour with Fats as his unofficial manager.

Critical reception
A Long Hot Summer was met with generally favorable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 78, based on ten reviews.

Matt Jost of RapReviews.com wrote: "shorter than its predecessor, it is also a more cohesive and even effort, making Ace and Brooklyn the focal points of this hour plus narrative told in the now trademark laid-back manner". Noah Callahan-Bever of Vibe stated: "though his singles may not rule radio, as far as full-lengths go, this is how it should be done". Chet Betz of Cokemachineglow found "Masta Ace's maturity informs his simplicity; experience strengthens the straightforward so that his words come methodically and sincerely". Jamin Warren of Pitchfork recommended: "unfortunately, A Long Hot Summer starts slowly. In fact, when you cop this album, do yourself a favor and skip the first five tracks". Robert Gabriel of The Austin Chronicle resumed: "wise beyond his decades, Masta Ace stands at the altar with lyrical depth as his bride". Urb reviewer wrote: "the record falters only when Ace recounts a gangster parable about shady dealings with a certain Fats Belvedere".

Stylus Magazine gave the album mixing review: "his new album isn't quite as good as Disposable Arts, but it's similarly engaging--he is both confident and insecure, and this incongruity defines his music". Veteran critic Robert Christgau summed it up with: "old-schooler as working stiff--craftsmanlike rhymer and plotter, much heart", highlighting songs "Da Grind" and "Bklyn Masala".
