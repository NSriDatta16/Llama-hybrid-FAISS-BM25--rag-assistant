Beat Konducta is an 8-album series released by hip hop musician Madlib.  "Beat Konducta" is also an alias which Madlib uses.  The series began officially in 2006 with the release of Beat Konducta Vol 1-2: Movie Scenes.  The album was stylistically a companion to (James Yancey) J Dilla's Donuts, which was released the month before, 3 days prior to Yancey's death. He has since followed with Beat Konducta Vol 3-4: Beat Konducta in India in 2007 and Beat Konducta Vol. 5-6: A Tribute to...(Dil Cosby and Dil Withers Suite) in 2008, which is a tribute to Yancey. Although the 2010 release Beat Konducta in Africa is an installment of the Madlib Medicine Show series, it is also considered a part of the Beat Konducta series.
