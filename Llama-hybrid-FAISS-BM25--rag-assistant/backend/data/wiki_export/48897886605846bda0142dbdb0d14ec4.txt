The speedometer was upped to 105 mph. Two Nighthawk 450 models were produced in 1985. The regular CB450SC, and the CB450SCL (California only). 
In 1986, its last year of production, the changes were minor, including the fender which was changed from chrome to "body color". Available options were: Nylon luggage (saddlebags, trunk bag, tank bag), leather saddlebags, engine guard, luggage rack and backrest.
