Middletown is a small village and townland in County Armagh, Northern Ireland. It lies near the border with County Monaghan, between Armagh and Monaghan along the A3. It had a population of 237 people (91 households) in the 2011 Census.

Geography

Middletown was built in the townland of Middletown, which was known throughout the 17th century under variants of the name Killecannagan (). It is known for its picturesque countryside and its rolling green hills. The hills are made up of numerous drumlins that make up the countryside. At the bottom of the valleys that many of these drumlins form, glens can be found with many tributaries of the River Blackwater flowing through them. The River Cor flows through the Middletown countryside and right by the village. It is the most prominent river in Middletown; once a canal system operated on it, namely the Ulster Canal.

History
Middletown was one of several Catholic border villages in Armagh that would have been transferred to the Irish Free State had the recommendations of the Irish Boundary Commission been enacted in 1925.

Education
Children from Middletown formerly went to three different primary schools: St John's Boys' School, St Louis Convent School for girls, and Glasdrummond Primary School (boys and girls). Due to low numbers in the mid-1990s, a new school was built on the site of St John's Boys' School and was opened in June 1999, whereupon all three primary schools were amalgamated.
