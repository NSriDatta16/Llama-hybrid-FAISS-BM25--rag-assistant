History
The 92.5 spot on the FM dial in North Alabama was first the home of WHOS-FM, which signed on in 1951.  It was originally licensed to Decatur and was owned by the North Alabama Broadcasting Company, along with AM 800 WHOS.  WHOS-FM later moved to 102.1 and today is WDRM, playing country music and usually ranked #1 in the market.

On October 4, 1992, the 92.5 frequency returned to the air with a new station, WAZK.  It was owned by Radio 92, Inc. and aired a classic rock format.  The new city of license is Trinity.

In 1994, the station was acquired by Griffith Broadcasting for $709,000.  In March 1995 the station went to a "Mix" adult contemporary format as WMHX.  Two months later, in May 1995, the station became WWXQ, as a Top 40 outlet.

In 2000, Capstar Broadcasting acquired WWXQ.  Capstar later merged into Clear Channel Communications.  Clear Channel simulcast an oldies format on both 94.1 WXQW (now WHRP) and WWXQ.  Later, Clear Channel moved that station to 100.3 FM, with the call sign WQRV.  Clear Channel is now called iHeartMedia, Inc.

The station changed hands again in April 2006, as part of a two-station deal that also included WXQW.  Cumulus Media, the current owner, paid $3.3 million for the two stations.  92.5 became WVNN-FM on April 6, 2006.  WVNN-FM began simulcasting the talk programming on 770 WVNN. It primarily serves to improve WVNN's coverage at night. The AM signal must reduce its power to 250 watts at night in order to protect WABC in New York.
