Age of Pirates: Caribbean Tales, known in Russia as Corsairs III (Корсары III), is a video game developed by Akella. Due to legal issues, it does not bear the name of the developers' previous pirate games Sea Dogs or Pirates of the Caribbean. Unlike Pirates of the Caribbean, Age Of Pirates was developed with the intent of serving as a true sequel to Sea Dogs despite the name change, and chronicles the story of the children of the main character from the original. The sequel of the game was released on May 26, 2009 titled Age of Pirates 2: City of Abandoned Ships.

In 2017, the game was digitally released on GOG and Steam as Sea Dogs: Caribbean Tales.

Gameplay
The player can choose to play as Blaze Shark or his step sister Beatrice Shark. When sailing on the map, time is accelerated to account for the travel across the Caribbean islands. Players have the freedom to enter ports, engage in ship-to-ship combat, or brave treacherous storms. Non-accelerated sailing and naval battles occur while navigating the open seas. On foot, players can partake in a range of activities, such as engaging in boarding actions, dueling enemy captains one-on-one, and exploring towns to recruit sailors and gather supplies.

Reception

IGN Spain's David Soriano criticized the Spanish dub of the game by ranking it one of the ten worst video games dub for the Spanish language and calling it the worst dubbing for a video game, at least in Spain. He commented: "We do not know what kind of substances were in the study [in which the game was dubbed]".
