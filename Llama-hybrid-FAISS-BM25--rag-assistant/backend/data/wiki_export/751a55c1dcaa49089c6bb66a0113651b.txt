Teuffenthal is a municipality in the administrative district of Thun in the canton of Bern in Switzerland.

History
Teuffenthal is first mentioned in 1344 as Toeffental.

The land around the modern village and what ever settlements were there belonged to the Herrschaft of Heimberg in the 13th century.  The Heimberg's were under the authority of the Counts of Kyburg.  On 11 November 1382, Rudolf II von Kyburg, attempted unsuccessfully to attack Solothurn.  His attack started the Burgdorferkrieg (also Kyburgerkrieg) with the Old Swiss Confederacy.  Bern used the war to expand north into the Aargau and south into the Oberland.  After the Kyburg defeat, as part of the peace treaty, Bern bought the city of Thun and all its surrounding lands including Teuffenthal.  Under Bernese rule, the small farming village was part of the distant parish of Hilterfingen until 1928 when it joined the parish of Buchen.  In 1935 Teuffenthal became an independent parish.

In 1989 a school was founded in the municipality, however in 2008 it closed and the students traveled to the school in Buchen for their education.

Traditionally the rural, agrarian village raised crops and livestock on the valley floor, summered livestock in alpine meadows and cut timber.  Agriculture still remains a major part of the local economy.  In 2005 a total of 62% of all jobs in the municipality were in agriculture.
