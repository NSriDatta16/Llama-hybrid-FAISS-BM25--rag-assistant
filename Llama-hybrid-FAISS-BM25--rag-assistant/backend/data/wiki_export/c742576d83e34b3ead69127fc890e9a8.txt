Born in Grande Prairie, Wharton later spent part of his teen years living in Jasper.

Wharton's first novel, Icefields, was published in 1995. It was awarded Best First Book in the Canada and Caribbean division of the Commonwealth Writers Prize, the Writers Guild of Alberta's Henry Kreisel Award for Best First Book, and the Banff Mountain Book Festival Grand Prize. It was selected for inclusion in the 2008 Canada Reads competition, where it was advocated by astronaut Steve MacLean.
