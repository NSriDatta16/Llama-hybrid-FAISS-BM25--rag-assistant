In 1944, the city was again rejoined to Croatia in new Yugoslavia. Many Italian families left already after the fall of Mussolini, after they realized that things were going badly in the country. Some Italian and mixed remained, part of them used the opportunity to opt for Italian citizenship. New authorities were interested in dealing with those who were collaborating with the occupiers, and all others whom they considered as the "enemy of people", either Croats, Italians or others. Their assets were nationalized. Bettiza moved to Gorizia after the end of World War II and the re-annexation of his native land to Croatia, at the age of 18.
