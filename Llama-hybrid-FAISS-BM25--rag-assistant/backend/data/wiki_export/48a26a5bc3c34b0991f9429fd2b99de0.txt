Stigma is the second studio album by English alternative band EMF, released in 1992. It yielded two UK hit singles: "They’re Here" (no. 29) and "It’s You" (no. 23).

The follow-up to the commercially successful Schubert Dip, Stigma failed to make the UK top 10 Album Charts (peaking at no. 19), and perhaps worse, was only in the charts for two weeks (its predecessor reached no. 3 and charted for 19 weeks).

"It's You That Leaves Me Dry" was re-mixed and re-titled "It's You" for the single release.

Reception
Geoff Orens of AllMusic gave the album three-and-a-half stars out of five, feeling that the overall mood and lyrical themes of the album were different from what would have been expected by fans: "For a fan base ready for more 'Unbelievable's however, Stigma was far from enticing and unfortunately sold less than hoped, leading to EMF's less-than-grand return to the foray of pop on Cha Cha Cha."
