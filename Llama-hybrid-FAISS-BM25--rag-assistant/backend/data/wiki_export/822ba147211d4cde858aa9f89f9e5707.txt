Education and career
Funk grew up in Indianapolis and attended Syracuse University, graduating in 1969. His first broadcasting job was covering high school and college sports for a small radio station in Danville, Illinois. He quickly moved up the ranks to acquire a job with the Philadelphia 76ers' WIBG-radio broadcasting crew in 1976.

Quotes
Funk is known for using his signature phrase "Ka-Boom!" whenever a Bulls player hits a three-point shot.  He is also well known for his dramatic call "Bang, down the well it goes!"

A typical sampling of Funk's play-by-play call: "Dennis inbounds to Scottie, who brings the ball up. Pippen across the timeline with Stockton on him. Scottie left side for Michael. Michael backing Russell, backing, backing now swings it down to Luc. Over to Scottie with 10 on the 24. Scottie to Steve Kerr for three—ka-boom!"

Funk once said while announcing a Sixers game “Cheeks to Barkley  Barkley back to Cheeks.  Cheeks-twisting, turning, wheeling, dealing, hanging, firing, scoring.”

Other activities
Funk was featured as the play-by-play announcer for the 1996 Midway Games arcade game NBA Hangtime. Among many NBA players of the time and members of the game's development team, Funk is accessible as a hidden character by using the name NFUNK along with pin 0101.
