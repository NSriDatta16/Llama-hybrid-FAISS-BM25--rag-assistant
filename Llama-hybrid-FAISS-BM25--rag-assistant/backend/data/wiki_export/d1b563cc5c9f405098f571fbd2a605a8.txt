Nobody Wants to Be Alone is the twelfth studio album by American country music singer Crystal Gayle. Released in April 1985, it peaked at #17 on the Billboard Country albums chart.

In a front page New York Times article titled, "Country Music in Decline," this album was noted as one of many that were indicative of a trend, marking "the end of an era" for the genre: despite two top 5 hits, "Crystal Gayle's latest album sold fewer than 80,000 copies" six months after its release.

Two singles from the album also made the Country singles charts; the title track reached #3 in early 1985, and "A Long and Lasting Love" reached #5 later that year. Though the song wasn't released as a single to Country radio, a video was produced for "Touch and Go."
