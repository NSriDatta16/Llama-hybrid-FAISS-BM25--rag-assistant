This is a complete list of short subjects and feature films that featured The Three Stooges released between 1930 and 1970.

Moe Howard, Larry Fine and Shemp Howard appeared in a single feature film with Ted Healy released by Fox Film Corporation entitled Soup to Nuts (1930). Shemp departed the act in 1932 to pursue a solo career and was replaced by his younger brother Curly Howard. This incarnation of the team appeared in several shorts and feature films with Healy at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1933 and 1934.
Moe and Shemp appeared without Larry or Healy in a 1929 Fox Movietone Newsreel.
Moe appeared without Larry, Curly, or Healy in the 1933 MGM PSA Give a Man a Job.
Moe and Curly appeared without Healy or Larry in the MGM feature film Broadway to Hollywood (1933).
Shemp appeared without the Stooges in the 1934 Vitaphone short Smoked Hams with Lionel Stander and Daphne Pollard.
Moe and Curly appeared without Healy or Larry in the MGM short subject Jail Birds of Paradise (1934).
Curly appeared in the MGM short subject Roast Beef and Movies (1934) without Healy, Moe, or Larry.
Larry and Healy appeared without Moe or Curly in the MGM feature Stage Mother (1933).
Curly and Healy appeared without Moe or Larry in the MGM feature Operator 13 (1934).

Moe, Larry and Curly left Healy in 1934 and moved to Columbia Pictures to begin their successful series of 190 shorts, with their contract extended each year until the final one expired on December 31, 1957. The final 8 of the 16 shorts with Joe Besser were released afterwards over the next 1⅓ years. The Stooges would continue afterwards with Moe, Larry, and Joe DeRita (as "Curly Joe"), and make several full-length feature films between 1959 and 1970.

Feature films

Joe Besser never appeared with the Stooges in a feature film.

Three feature-length Columbia releases were actually packages of older Columbia shorts. Columbia Laff Hour (introduced in 1956) was a random assortment that included the Stooges among other Columbia comedians like Andy Clyde, Hugh Herbert, and Vera Vague; the content and length varied from one theater to the next. Three Stooges Fun-o-Rama (introduced in 1959) was an all-Stooges show capitalizing on their TV fame, again with shorts chosen at random for individual theaters. The Three Stooges Follies (1974) was similar to Laff Hour, with a trio of Stooge comedies augmented by actor, comedian and filmmaker Buster Keaton and Vera Vague shorts, a Batman serial chapter, and a Kate Smith musical.
