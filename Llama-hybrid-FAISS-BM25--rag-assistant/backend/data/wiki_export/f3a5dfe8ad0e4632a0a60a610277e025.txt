David B. Chyzowski (born July 11, 1971) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey left winger. He was selected second overall in the 1989 NHL Entry Draft by the New York Islanders after playing major junior with the Kamloops Blazers. He spent parts of six seasons in the National Hockey League with the Islanders and Chicago Blackhawks between 1989 and 1997, with the rest of his career spent in various minor leagues and in Europe.

Playing career
Chyzowski is generally recognized as a draft bust as he only played 126 NHL games between 1989 and 1995, scoring 31 points. He was chosen ahead of fellow first-round picks Bill Guerin, Stu Barnes, and Bobby Holik. Chyzowski spent his career with the Islanders and Chicago Blackhawks. While Chyzowski did not have an impact at the NHL level, he did carve out a nice career in the minor leagues, particularly the AHL and IHL. His best minor league season was 1995–96, when he had 83 points on 44 goals and 39 assists, along with 160 penalty minutes, for Adirondack Red Wings.

In 2006, he was playing for Linz EHC in the Austrian League. After his playing career, he took on the position of Marketing Coordinator for the Kamloops Blazers Hockey Club.
