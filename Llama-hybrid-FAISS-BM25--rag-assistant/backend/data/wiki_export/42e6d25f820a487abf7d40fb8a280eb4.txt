Career
Ré began his career in Asunción, playing for Cerro Porteño before signing for Spanish side Elche CF in 1959. After three seasons with Elche, Ré was signed by FC Barcelona where he spent the best years of his career, especially in the 1964–1965 season in which he scored 26 goals and won the Pichichi Trophy (awarded to the top scorer of the league). After playing for four years in Barcelona (where he scored 90 goals in total) he moved to RCD Espanyol.

Ré also played for the Paraguay national team (25 caps), most importantly in the 1958 FIFA World Cup.

After retiring from football, Ré became a football coach. His best coaching job was leading the Paraguay national team to the knock-out stage in the 1986 FIFA World Cup.
