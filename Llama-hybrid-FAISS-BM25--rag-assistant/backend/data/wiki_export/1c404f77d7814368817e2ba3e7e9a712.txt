Pacific Coast University School of Law (Pacific Coast University or PCU School of Law) is an unaccredited private law school in Long Beach, California.

Accreditation

The PCU School of Law was originally granted accreditation by the Committee of Bar Examiners of the State Bar of California on September 25, 2010. Due to its mission as an evening-only law school, PCU is not eligible to apply for accreditation by the American Bar Association.  As a result, while PCU graduates may sit for the California Bar Exam, and should they pass, join the California Bar, they are generally ineligible to practice law in other states.
On June 22, 2020, Pacific Coast University, School of Law was officially notified by the Committee of Bar Examiners (CBE) of the State of California that its accreditation and degree-granting authority has been terminated effective August 20, 2020 due to non-compliance with the minimum California Bar pass rate.
