This is the discography of Dir En Grey, a Japanese heavy metal band. They have recorded eleven original studio albums, three EPs and thirty one singles in their twenty four years together. Each of the band's releases has charted on Japan's Oricon charts.

Dir En Grey made their earliest releases as an independent band with Free-Will, eventually signing a temporary deal with Warner Music Japan. Dir En Grey's earliest releases were self-produced, however, they worked with a producer, X Japan drummer Yoshiki Hayashi, for a series of five singles preceding Gauze.

With the release of Macabre, Dir En Grey began to release cooperatively between Firewall Division, a subsidiary of Free-Will, and Sony Music Entertainment Japan. In 2005, Dir En Grey signed to the Europe label, Gan-Shin. The following year, they would release in the United States under Warcon Enterprises and Fontana Distribution, while being managed by Free-Will's American branch.  On both foreign labels, the band's initial release was Withering to Death, and followed by The Marrow of a Bone. Their seventh album Uroboros is planned for both a European (Gan-Shin) and American release (The End Records).

Dir En Grey have made only one release on their independent label, Free-Will, since the major label debut; they released their music video compilation, Average Psycho through the independent label due to graphic content, not allowed by Sony.
