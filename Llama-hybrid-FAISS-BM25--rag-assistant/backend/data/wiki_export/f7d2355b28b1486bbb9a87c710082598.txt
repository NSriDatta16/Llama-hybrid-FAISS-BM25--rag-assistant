History
The house was built in a Western English style of post-medieval architecture by James Blake, an immigrant from England.  The Blake family owned the house until 1825 when it was acquired by the Williams family. In 1891, the City of Boston acquired the house. In order to save the house from demolition in 1896, the Dorchester Historical Society acquired the property from the city and moved the house less than 500 feet from its original location by Massachusetts Avenue to its current location. In 1978, the interior and exterior of the house were designated as a Boston Landmark by the Boston Landmarks Commission.

The immediate area, as well as the house, have been undergoing an extensive renovation and preservation. The house was completely re-shingled and the grounds improved.
