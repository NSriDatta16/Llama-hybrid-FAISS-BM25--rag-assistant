Singles
 "Shut Up" was the debut single from Nick Lachey's debut solo album SoulO. The single was a commercial failure in the United States, failing to chart. Video directed by Constantine Paraskevopoulos.

The first version of the music video featured a group of female dancers (including Kimberly Wyatt from The Pussycat Dolls) dancing around Lachey and featured several close-ups of him. Lachey filmed the video, and later won the right to redo it.

The second video featured Dax Shepard and Jennifer Morrison living in a trailer outside of Lachey's real-life home.

 "This I Swear" was the second single from Nick Lachey's debut album SoulO. The ballad has lyrics in which he expressed how he felt about the marriage and love he had for his then wife, Jessica Simpson. Part of the song lyrics includes "I will love you, until forever, until death do us part we'll be together". The song was also the theme song to the hit reality TV show Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica. It was sent to radio in the United States on September 28, 2003.

"This I Swear" reached #11 on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100. Despite being heavily promoted, the single became Lachey's second single to not chart on the Billboard Hot 100.

Chart performance
The album was expected to be successful because the album was released during the popularity of Lachey's television show, Newlyweds. However, despite being heavily promoted, the album debuted at #51 on the Billboard 200, selling only 28,000 copies in its first week. The album was considered a commercial failure, both in terms of sales and chart performance; the album sold 171,000 copies in the United States and stayed on the Billboard 200 for just 11 weeks.
