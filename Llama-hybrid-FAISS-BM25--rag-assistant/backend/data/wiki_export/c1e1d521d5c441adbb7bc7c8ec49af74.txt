The Generic Modeling Environment (GME) is a domain-specific, model-integrated program synthesis tool for creating domain-specific models of large-scale systems. GME development started in 2000 at Vanderbilt University, US and continues well into 2022. Initially it only supported MS Windows OS, but later evolved into WebGME, a web- and Node.js- based software. Its primary purpose is model-building.

Overview 
GME allows users to define new modeling languages using UML-based metamodels. GME was developed in 2000 by the Institute for Software Integrated Systems at Vanderbilt University. GME is a part of the META Tool Suite and the Adaptive Vehicle Make program. The main language it uses is CyPhyML. 

hierarchy, multiple aspects, sets, references, and explicit constraints

WebGME 
The new version of GME, called WebGME, is entirely web-browser based. It supports simultaneous distributed collaborative editing of models and has a version controlled database backend in the cloud. The native file format is .
