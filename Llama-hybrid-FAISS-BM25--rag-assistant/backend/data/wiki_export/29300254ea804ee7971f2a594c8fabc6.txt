Colac Bay / Ōraka is a small township situated on the bay of the same name facing Foveaux Strait, and located on the Southern Scenic Route, 10 minutes from Riverton, New Zealand. Surrounding areas include Longwood, Tihaka, Waipango, Round Hill, Wakapatu, Ruahine, Pahia and Orepuki.

The town hugs the bay, with sandy beaches, and has a popular surf spot known as Trees.  It is a beach break that breaks to the left and right.  The northern end of the bay is generally good for swimming. 
The town has a well appointed cafe, craft shop, pub, caravan park, community hall and Marae. 
The town also features a statue of a surfer riding a wave, which is popular with tourists.

The hills behind Colac are part of the Longwood Range, which were popular in early days for gold mining.  Further west shale was also mined for a short time.  In the gold mining days there was a significant Chinese village towards Orepuki called Canton.

Colac Bay Hill, Lake George, Howell's Hills and the Longwood Range make up the geographic landmarks. In some places Raratoka Island or Centre Island and Stewart Island/Rakiura can be seen by looking across Foveaux Strait.
