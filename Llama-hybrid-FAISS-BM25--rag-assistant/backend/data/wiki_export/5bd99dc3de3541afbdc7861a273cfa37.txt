Paul Evans (1945 â€“ 1991) was a Welsh poet associated with the British Poetry Revival.  He is included in the anthology British Poetry since 1945 and the 1969 anthology Children of Albion: Poetry of the Underground in Britain.

His work has been described as similar to that of Lee Harwood, with a dreamy tone and surrealist images.  His poems have no definite meaning, but alter each time they are read.
