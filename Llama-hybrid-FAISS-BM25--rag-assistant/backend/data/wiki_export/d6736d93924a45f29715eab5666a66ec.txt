Fähnrich () is an officer candidate rank in the Austrian Bundesheer and German Bundeswehr.  The word  comes from an older German military title,  (flag bearer), and first became a distinct military rank in Germany on 1 January 1899.  However,  ranks are often incorrectly compared with the rank of ensign, which shares a similar etymology but is a full-fledged (albeit junior) commissioned officer rank.

In the German Landsknecht armies, recorded from ca. 1480, the equivalent rank of a Cornet existed. The cornet carried the troop standard, also known as a "cornet".

The rank also exists in a few other European military organizations, often with historical ties to the German system. Examples are the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland (see Fänrik). The French Army has a similar position called an Aspirant.

In the Finnish landforces and airforce,  () is the lowest commissioned officer rank, which is granted to the soldiers in the national service on the day they are released from their 347-day service. Finnish  are thus of equal rank to the German lieutenant (also a platoon leader).
