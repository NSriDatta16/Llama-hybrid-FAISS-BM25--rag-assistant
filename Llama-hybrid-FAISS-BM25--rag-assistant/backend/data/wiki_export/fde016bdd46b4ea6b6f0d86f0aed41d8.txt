Judith A. Hunt is an American illustrator, painter, cartoonist, and designer, who has produced a diverse array of artwork for books, magazines, television, comics, videos, and toys. She has worked as an art director and staff illustrator/designer for magazine companies. As of 2018, she illustrates educational texts and children's books from her studio in Kennebunk, Maine, and  showcases her fine art in local art shows.

Hunt's artwork has taken many twists and turns to adapt to the constantly changing demands of the commercial art market. She has done educational book development, children’s book illustration, book cover illustration, and magazine illustration. Her knowledge of botany and ecology has led her to illustrating botanical and wildlife conservation signs and posters for many conservation organizations, including the United States Forestry Service and the Maine Department of Conservation. Other work includes fantasy illustration, commercial licensed character picture book illustration, and video work for Andrew Gutelle's What's a Gonzo and Baby Kermit's Birthday Surprise. She created model sheets, templates, and character designs of Johnny Gruelle’s Raggedy Ann and Andy for Macmillan Publishing and the Highlights for Children characters, Timbertoes, and cartoon model books for characters appearing in Highlights for Children's "Funzone" and "Which Way USA" educational puzzle series.

Comics 
From 1980–1985, Hunt co-created and wrote cartoon and comic books with her then-husband, Chuck Dixon, including Evangeline and Winnie-the-Pooh word books, besides being the designer and illustrator on these projects.

In 1987 Hunt pencilled three issues of Conan the King, including an entire issue inked by Al Williamson; issues #3 and #4 of First Comics' Evangeline, and a few supplemental comics done for First Comics.

In addition, Hunt completed updated model sheets for Macmillan's Raggedy Ann and Andy, and illustrated many children books, including Henson Associates' What's a Gonzo and Baby Kermit's Birthday Surprise, and packaging design for toys.
