Philip Avery (born 15 November 1959) is a British meteorologist and BBC Weather forecaster.

Career
After his initial training with the Royal Navy, Avery spent time at a naval air station before joining a helicopter squadron embarked in HMS Ark Royal. Over the following two years he forecasted across the world, after which he joined a Search and Rescue squadron, based at Prestwick in Scotland. Within four years, he completed his time in the Navy and achieved an MBA.

He helped to launch The Weather Network, a 24-hour cable-channel based in Birmingham, before moving to London to work with the Weather Channel. After a year he joined the BBC Weather Centre, in April 1998, becoming a household name appearing regularly on BBC News, BBC World News, BBC Red Button, BBC Radio 2, BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Radio 4, where he was a regular forecaster on the Today programme.

He took time out from presenting between September 2004 and July 2005 to take part in the Global Challenge 2004-2005 yacht race.

In October 2010 it was announced that Avery would no longer be presenting BBC weather forecasts. Despite this, he returned to broadcasting on the BBC a few years later. Avery has since presented weather for BBC's Gardeners' World and is now a regular presenter on BBC One.
