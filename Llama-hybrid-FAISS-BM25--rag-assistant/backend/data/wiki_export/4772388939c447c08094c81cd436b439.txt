Seeds of Change is Kerry Livgren's first solo album. Released in 1980 while he still was a member of Kansas, it features guest appearances by three fellow Kansas members: Steve Walsh, Phil Ehart and Robby Steinhardt. Singer Ronnie James Dio and members of LeRoux, Jethro Tull, Ambrosia, and Atlanta Rhythm Section are also featured. In 1996, Seeds of Change was reissued by Renaissance Records with an interview with Livgren as a bonus track.

Background
Seeds of Change marked a new chapter in Livgren's music. It was recorded after Kerry Livgren had converted to Christianity in 1979. His religious beliefs began to be reflected in the song lyrics of Kansas album Vinyl Confessions as well as Seeds of Change. This eventually would cause tension within the band.

The inclusion of Ronnie James Dio, who was Black Sabbath's lead vocalist at the time, caused controversy, as Black Sabbath is considered satanic by some Christians. Livgren wrote that he chose Dio "strictly on the basis of his vocal abilities" as well as stating in the liner notes for Seeds Of Change that Dio "is no Satanist".
