In a corner of the Taneyamagahara plateau in the Kitakami Mountains of Iwate Prefecture, Ito, who spends the night with three farmers preparing for mowing from the early morning, dreams. In a dream, Youth Ito interacts with the staff of the Forestry Office about the place where he can be paid to burn charcoal. Suddenly, oak, kashiwa, and birch tree spirits appear. Kodama and the youth Ito interact with each other over whether to cut down the trees in the mountains. For Ito youth, the mountain where the trees were squeezed and "komon" was a rich and "good" landscape where water boiled and akebi and mushrooms could be removed. However, if you don't cut the tree and burn the charcoal, you won't be able to make a living. Kodama, who had been disagreeing with cutting trees, finally answered, "Then there is no point in cutting trees, but burn good charcoal." A mysterious overnight dream story that Kenji Miyazawa tells us that humans are not the only ones living in this world.The movie describes the daily life of mountains farmers and their struggles to keep moving while deepening their understanding of nature and the world they live in, as they encounter mysterious figures and appearances that may change their perspective on everything they have yet experienced.
