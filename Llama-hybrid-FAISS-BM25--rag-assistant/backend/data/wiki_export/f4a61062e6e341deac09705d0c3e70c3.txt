Overview
Tzu Chi Singapore was founded in September 1993 advocating several Buddhist and humanitarian causes within Singapore. Some regular activities being offered and provided in Singapore include free clinics, health checkups and monthly recycling at specific hotspots. A localized journal is also published on a monthly basis by the organization. Tzu Chi members are recognisable via their navy blue collared shirts with white pants. The charity is also represented in local tertiary institutions - also known as the Tzu Chi Collegiate Association Singapore - with youth members typically donning lighter blue collared shirts.
