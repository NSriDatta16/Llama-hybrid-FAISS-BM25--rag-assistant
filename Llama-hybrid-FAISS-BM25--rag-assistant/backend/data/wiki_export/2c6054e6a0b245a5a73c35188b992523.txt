The prefix  means "upper" (since this was created from the upper part of the old Sirdal municipality). The first element of the name is the genitive case of the river name Síra (now the Sira river). The river name has an unknown meaning, but it could be something like "strong stream". The last element is  which means "valley" or "dale".
