Biography 
Nikolay Adlerberg graduated from the Page Corps of His Majesty in 1837, and in 1838 was appointed aide-de-camp to the Emperor; he participated in wars led by Russia in Caucasus (1841–1842) and Hungary in 1849. After the Hungarian campaign he was promoted to the rank of colonel and awarded with golden weapons.

Adlerberg resigned in 1852 and was attached to the Russian Ministry of the Interior, receiving the title of chamberlain in the court of His Majesty. On 10 June 1853 Adlerberg was appointed Governor of Taganrog, but he left the Governor's office in the hands of general Yegor Tolstoy in spring 1854 due to a declared state of war in Taganrog and the proximity of Crimean War actions. In 1852-1870 he was President of the Russian Imperial Post Department, who introduced the first Russian post stamps.

In 1855, Nikolay Adlerberg was promoted to the rank of mayor-general and married Amalie Gräfin of Lerchenfeld (1808–1888) (in the first marriage Baroness Amalie von Krüdener).

Count Adlerberg served as governor-general of Simferopol and Taurida Governorate (1854–1856) during an uneasy period of the Crimean War. Later he served at the Imperial Russian Diplomatic Mission in Berlin in 1856–1866. Nikolay Adlerberg was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general in 1861 and infantry-general in 1870, and during sixteen years served as Governor-General of Finland (1866–1881). Being a theater enthusiast, he established the Russian Theater in Helsingfors in 1868, which was named Alexandre Theater in 1879 after Alexander II of Russia.

On 22 May 1881 the Count was named member of the State Council, but was pensioned off from this post after assassination of his protector, Emperor Alexander II of Russia. Nikolay and Amalie Adlerberg moved to Germany, where they settled at Maximilian Lerchenfeld's estate in Tegernsee near Munich.
