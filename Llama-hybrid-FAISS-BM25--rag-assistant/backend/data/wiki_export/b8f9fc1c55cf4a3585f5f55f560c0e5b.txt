History
Construction of the M-Wave was completed on November 21, 1996. It was the fourth Nagano Winter Olympic venue to be completed.

In 1998, The M-Wave had projected annual maintenance costs of 524 million yen. Nagano City commissioned a public–private partnership company, M-Wave Corporation, to operate the arena. In a report of venue costs and usage 20 years after the Olympics, M-Wave and Spiral, which was used for bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton were singled out as examples of successful usage. In particular, M-Wave remains profitable. The economic ripple effect from the National Junior High School Skating Championships, which have taken place at M-Wave and Big Hat every year since 2008, alone brings in 250 million yen.

M-Wave Corporation operates M-Wave and Big Hat, which is now a multipurpose sport, theatre, and meeting venue. Since January, 2019, the president of M-Wave Corporation is Shinichi Takizawa, formerly of JTB Corporation and past managing director of the Nagano Convention and Visitors Bureau.
