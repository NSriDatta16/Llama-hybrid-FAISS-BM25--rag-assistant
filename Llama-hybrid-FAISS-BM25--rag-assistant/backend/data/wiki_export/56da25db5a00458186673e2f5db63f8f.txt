History 
The village was first mentioned in 1289 as Niewenniedorp, and means "new new village". The extra Nieuwe (new) was added to distinguish from Oude Niedorp. Nieuwe Niedorp developed in the Middle Ages as a peat excavation area.

The Catholic Our Lady of Immaculate Conception Church was built between 1905 and 1906 as part of a U-shaped Franciscan monastery. The Dutch Reformed Fenix church from 1966, has a leaning church tower.

Nieuwe Niedorp was home to 534 people in 1840. It was a separate municipality until 1970, when it merged with Oude Niedorp and Winkel. In 2012, it became part of the municipality of Hollands Kroon.
