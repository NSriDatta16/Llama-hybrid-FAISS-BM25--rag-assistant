Miroslav Deronjić (; 6 June 1954 – 19 May 2007) was a Bosnian Serb who was charged with persecution, a crime against humanity, by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) for his actions related to the Glogova massacre in the Bosnian village of Glogova.

Deronjić held the post of President of the Bratunac Municipal Board of the Serbian Democratic Party from 1990 to 1992, and was later a member of its main board.

On 30 March 2004, he was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment.

Deronjić was serving his sentence in Sweden where he died, aged 52, from cancer, in a hospital.
