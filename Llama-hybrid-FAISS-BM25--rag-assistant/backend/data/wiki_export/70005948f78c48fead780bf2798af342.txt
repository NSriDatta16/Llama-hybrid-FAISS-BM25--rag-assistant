My Scene (stylized in all lowercase) is an American series of fashion dolls that Mattel released in 2002. 
They were discontinued in the US in 2008, and worldwide in 2011. Mattel's Barbie character is one of the dolls in the toy line. The My Scene dolls' bodies are slim, similar to earlier Barbie dolls, but their heads are larger. The New York Times described their features as "exaggerated lips and bulging, makeup-caked eyes." My Scene were designed to appeal to the tween market and compete with the Bratz dolls from MGA Entertainment.

Products and history 

Mattel introduced My Scene dolls in the fall season of 2002 to compete with MGA's Bratz. The series originally consisted of three female characters with diverse ethnicities and personalities; Mattel added more dolls over time. Its three original dolls, Barbie, Madison, and Chelsea, each came with two extra fashions. Except for Barbie, the characters were named after New York City locations. Mattel added more dolls to the series, starting with Nolee and three male characters, Bryant, River, and Hudson, in the year of 2003. Delancey and Ellis also premiered in the "Hanging Out" line, which introduced in late 2003. Kenzie introduced in 2004's "Getting Ready Line," and Nia introduced in the year of 2008. There are seven characters in the My Scene series (Kennedy, Madison, Chelsea, Delancey, Nia, Hudson, and River), six discontinued characters (Barbie, Nolee, Kenzie, Bryant, Ellis, and Sutton) and four special edition dolls (Lindsay, Jai, Tyson and Ryan). Each of the My Scene girls (and three of the boys) own pets.

Female My Scene dolls have a non-twisting, navel-sculpted body mold and share a face mold, developed specifically for the brand, that dons a small nose, wide cheekbones, and large, pouty lips. Some lines' dolls (beginning with "Night on the Town") have rooted eyelashes and glittery eyes. Like the Bratz, these dolls have large shoes that serve as feet, but they also have traditional Barbie feet and can wear regular Barbie shoes. Male dolls also feature My Scene-exclusive face molds; their body molds originated with previous male dolls.

In 2004, Mattel produced new smiling face molds for both male and female characters, which were present for only a short while on the female dolls, whereas male dolls featured these molds until early 2005. Beginning with the "Club Birthday" line, the My Scene dolls' face molds changed to non-smiling molds that more closely resembled the "Bratz Boyz" line of dolls.

In late 2005, Mattel released a My Scene line called "My Bling Bling", which introduced a new eye screening that looked more sultry compared to previous releases. Later, in mid-2006, Barbie was dropped from the line in favor of a new character named Kennedy, who would be introduced in the "Fab Faces" line.

Beginning with the "Swappin' Styles" line of 2006, Mattel produced two more new face molds for female dolls—one with a half-open smile and the other, a closed smirk. This line also re-released the "Getting Ready" smiling face mold.

In 2007, a somewhat controversial line was launched, called "Growing Up Glam". These dolls feature a turnable key on their back that can make the doll grow taller and grow breasts, similar to the infamous "Growing Up Skipper" doll.

Mattel ceased selling My Scene dolls in the US in 2008, but continued to sell the dolls internationally, until Mattel ceased production on the My Scene line as a whole in the year of 2011.

Legal issues 
On April 13, 2005, Mattel's competing toy company, MGA Entertainment, filed a lawsuit against Mattel for its My Scene brand, alleging duplication of its Bratz dolls'  multi-ethnic looks, fashions, and packaging. The suit further accused Mattel of "engaging in acts of unfair competition and intellectual property infringement intended to damage its market share, confuse consumers and trade on the company's goodwill."

In 2006, Mattel countersued MGA Entertainment, alleging that Bratz creator Carter Bryant had been working for Mattel when he developed the idea for Bratz in 1999 and had taken the idea to MGA secretly, with MGA in turn developing the first-generation Bratz dolls while obscuring Bryant's involvement. Bryant and Mattel reached a settlement before trial, at which a federal jury awarded Mattel $100million in damages for the violation of their intellectual property in 2008, and further issued an injunction that forced MGA to stop producing Bratz.

In a 2011 retrial, however, MGA toy makers claimed that in producing the My Scene dolls, Mattel had stolen their trade secrets and violated antitrust laws, and sought $1billion in damages. The judge found in favor of MGA, and MGA received an award totaling $309.9million, freeing the company to produce Bratz once again—at which time Mattel retired the My Scene line.

Media franchise 
Starting in the year of 2003 with the "Hanging Out" line, Mattel began packaging My Scene dolls with DVDs that contained short video clips, music, and activities. This began a trend that sparked three My Scene films, all of which aired on the Nickelodeon cable network. The My Scene line also features four special edition dolls present only in the My Scene films. These include the Jamaican-American characters Jai and Tyson from Jammin' in Jamaica, and Ryan Ridley (a new fictional character) and Lindsay Lohan from My Scene Goes Hollywood. Mattel received special rights to create the only likeness of Lohan for the line.

Films 
Mattel released three My Scene films between 2004 and 2005 as follows:

My Scene: Jammin' in Jamaica (2004) 
My Scene: Jammin' in Jamaica was released to DVD on May 15, 2004, and later premiered on Nickelodeon on June 6, 2004. It was sold with the "Jammin' in Jamaica" dolls and was directed by Eric Fogel, the creator of Celebrity Deathmatch. The plot involves Madison who is the manager of a band called Urban Desire, which is made up of the four male characters. When the band wins a contest, they make a trip to Jamaica for the finals, but Barbie, Nolee, and Chelsea must raise the money to travel to Jamaica.  After all the characters arrive in Jamaica, Barbie feels left out as her boyfriend, the lead guitarist, begins spending more time with Madison. This causes a rift between the friends but is eventually resolved.

My Scene: Masquerade Madness (2004) 
My Scene: Masquerade Madness was the second My Scene film, released to DVD on June 1, 2004, and later premiered on Nickelodeon on October 24, 2004. It runs 28 minutes long, half the length of Jammin' in Jamaica. The plot revolves around the Masquerade Madness fashion show, a fundraiser for the local animal shelter. Chelsea designs the fashions for the show all on her own, causing strain on her schoolwork. Failing in geometry and too embarrassed to tell her friends, she calls on Hudson's help in tutoring. As a result, her friends begin to think they are secretly dating. In the end, Chelsea has aced her geometry test and coordinated a successful fashion show. This film was sold with the My Scene "Masquerade Madness" dolls.

My Scene Goes Hollywood: The Movie (2005) 
My Scene Goes Hollywood: The Movie, was the first and only film to be sold apart from the dolls and the only full-length film. Eric Fogel reprised his role as director. It was released to DVD on August 30, 2005 by Buena Vista Home Entertainment under the Miramax Family label, and later premiered on Nickelodeon on October 23, 2005. It featured a voice-over by actress and singer Lindsay Lohan, who plays as herself. Kelly Sheridan of the Barbie film series reprised her role as Barbie. The plot involves the My Scene girls pretending to be extras in a spy action movie being filmed in New York City, in order to see it up close. When one of the actresses is injured, Madison is called upon to take her place. She begins spending less and less time with her friends and develops a crush on the leading actor, Ryan Ridley. Madison ends up fighting with her friends because they embarrass her. In the end, Lohan convinces Madison that friends are the most important thing to have, and the girls make up.  Although the title suggests a trip to Hollywood, the setting of the film actually takes place in New York City.

 Bryant has green eyes and strawberry blonde hair. He was introduced in Game On along with Hudson and made his last appearance in Rumor Has It before moving to London. According to the official website, he is an Aquarius born on February 6, snacks on wasabi green peas, loves video cameras, likes to skateboard, and would not watch a buddy cop movie. He is probably happiest when he's behind a camera, as he loves documenting every moment. He was marketed as Nolee's boyfriend. It is rumored he was created to look like American Idol runner-up Justin Guarini. Recently, a character identical in appearance to Bryant was featured in a webisode on Kennedy's homepage. He is never supposed to be Bryant, but a rock star who went to school with Kennedy in Hollywood. Bryant was named after New York's Bryant Park. Bryant was the least produced of the boys and discontinued in 2003.
 Hudson is Caucasian with light blue eyes, pale skin, and blonde hair. He was one of the first male dolls to be introduced in the My Scene line and is often romantically paired with Chelsea. According to the official website, his favorite sport is soccer, he likes to hang out in Central Park, he gets around on foot, and cell phones are his pet peeve. He is named after the Hudson River in New York, and his sign is Capricorn due to his December 23 birthday. Hudson is voiced by Kirby Morrow.
 River has dark hair, a fair skin tone, and brown eyes. He is Barbie's boyfriend. According to the official website, he is a rock musician, his birthday is on December 3 (or 6) and his sign is Sagittarius. His favorite music is the post-punk genre, he snacks on tofu dogs and likes girls with a great smile. He lives for music, as he feels it's the only way he can express himself, so he plays with a few different bands. He is also named after the Hudson River in New York. River is voiced by Alessandro Juliani.
 Sutton is African-British with dark brown hair, brown skin, and eyes, and he's from London. His character is less developed than those of Hudson and River; the original Sutton doll came with art supplies, while later dolls came variably with musical and computer accessories. He's sometimes romantically paired with Madison and, according to the official website, he has an urban look. He was born on April 17 and his sign is Aries. His favorite food is french fries, although "[he] calls 'em "chips," he makes his own music, and looks for a girl who's "sweet...but can get sassy, too!" He likes New York City. He's supposed to be a bit of a ladies' man, as well as a fantastic dancer. He's named after Sutton in South London. Sutton is voiced by Mark Hildreth.
 Ellis is characterized as Caucasian, with brown hair, a pale skin tone, and green eyes. He is Delancey's boyfriend. According to the official website, his birthday is March 1 and his sign is Pisces. His favorite food is New York pizza, he drinks chai tea and takes acting lessons with the hope of one day being in movies, although he does not want to become a shallow Hollywood movie star. He was somewhat scared of acting at first, but now he enjoys it, saying "performing is such a rush". Ellis was the second least produced of the My Scene boys and was discontinued in 2004 after he moved. He is named after Ellis Island in New York. Ellis is voiced by Shane Meier.
 Tyson is Jamaican with brown skin, blonde hair, and hazel eyes. He likes surfing and flirting with girls. His astrological sign is Scorpio. He owns a 5-star hotel named Jamaican Palms. His love interest is Chelsea, and was sold in the "Jammin' in Jamaica: Surfrider" line.
 Ryan Ridley - like Lindsay Lohan, he's an actor and also a screenwriter and producer. Despite he has dark brown hair with matching eye color and a pale skin tone, the "My Scene Goes Hollywood" film has a tanned one. Ryan is voiced by Samuel Vincent.

Pets 
Each of the My Scene girls (and three of the boys) own pets. Barbie/Kennedy's, Chelsea's, Madison's, and Nolee's are all introduced in Wave 2. Delancey's kittens were introduced in the "Getting Ready" wave, and her adult cat was introduced in "Masquerade Madness". Kenzie's unnamed brown Yorkie is introduced in "Masquerade Madness". Hudson's dog is introduced in "Getting Ready", while River's and Sutton's are introduced in "Masquerade Madness".

 Yorkie, is a Yorkshire Terrier owned by Barbie (and later, Kennedy). According to the My Scene website, Yorkie is a female. However, since Yorkie is presented as a white dog, she could well be a West Highland Terrier (Westie) but her breed is uncertain.
 Mambo, also known as Churro, is a chihuahua owned by Chelsea. The My Scene website stated that he is male, but he is shown wearing female clothing in the "Teen T-Shirts" line.
 Bella is a Carlin Pinscher owned by Madison. Bella is a female, confirmed by the My Scene website, and by her name.
 Cookie is a Pug owned by Nolee(and later, Nia).  He is male.
 Sugar is an adult female cat owned by Delancey. Sugar gave birth to kittens in the "Getting Ready" line, including Pinky, the only kitten that Delancey kept.
 Coco is Kenzie's brown Yorkshire Terrier.
 Blanca is Jai's Carlin Pinscher.
 St. Bernard, is Hudson's' unnamed St. Bernard. It was the only male-owned pet to introduce before "Masquerade Madness", and it is the only one of the male's dogs to be produced twice. The dog was quite large in "Getting Ready", where it was introduced. It was shrunk to the other pet's sizes in its second appearance ("Masquerade Madness"), however.
 Bull Mastiff, is River's unnamed Bull Mastiff. It was introduced in "Masquerade Madness".
 Husky, is Sutton's unnamed Husky. It was introduced in "Masquerade Madness".
