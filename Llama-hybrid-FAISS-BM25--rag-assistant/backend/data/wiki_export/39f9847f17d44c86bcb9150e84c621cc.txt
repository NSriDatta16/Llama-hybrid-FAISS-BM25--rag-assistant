Kekeya Kingdom (also known as Kekaya, Kaikaya, Kaikeya etc.) was a kingdom mentioned in the ancient Indian epic Mahabharata among the western kingdoms of then India. The epic Ramayana mentions one of the wives of Dasharatha, the king of Kosala and father of Rama, was from Kekeya kingdom and was known as Kaikeyi. Her son Bharata conquered the neighbouring kingdom of Gandhara and built the city of Takshasila. Later the sons and descendants of Bharata ruled this region from Takshasila in modern day Pakistan.

In Mahabharata, a Kekaya prince was mentioned, who joined the Pandavas in the Kurukshetra War. He was the eldest among the six brothers and was described as a king known as Vrihatkshatra who is banished from his kingdom by his own kinsmen, like the Pandavas who were banished from their Kuru Kingdom, by their cousin brothers viz the Kauravas headed by Duryodhana. Thus this Kekaya brother was circumstantially inclined to ally with the Pandavas. Besides this, the 6 Kekaya brothers were sons of the sister of Kunti, the mother of the Pandavas, making them cousins. In the Kurukshetra War, the Kekaya brother fought against his own kinsmen, viz the other 5 Kekaya brothers who sided with Duryodhana.

References in Valmiki Ramayana

There are several references to Kaikeyi in the epic Ramayana. Kaikeyi was one of the three queens of Dasharatha, the king of Ayodhya.  She was a Kekaya princess, and the daughter of Ashwapati. Ramayana testifies that the capital of Kekayas lay beyond river Sudama. River Sudama has been identified with river Saranges of Arrian which flowed also flowed through Kekians.  The Vedic texts do not mention  name of the capital of Kekaya but Ramayana does  inform us that the Kekaya metropolis was Rajagriha or Girivraja.  which  A. Cunningham  has identified with Girjak or Jalalpur on river Jhelum in the Jhelum district  but this view has not been accepted by scholars. Ramayana further attests that Kekaya lay beyond Vipasa or Beas  and abutted with the country of Gandharava or Gandhara vishaya (country). Ravana, the son of Vishrava and Kaikesi (Princess of Kaikeya may be an early predecessor of Bhagawan Rama’s Step mother) was born in Devagana.

References in Vishnu-Dharmottara Mahapurana
According to Vishnu-Dharmottara Mahapurana also, the capital of  the Kekayas lay beyond river Sudama which flowed some distance westwards from the Vitasta or Jhelum river. Prince Bharata, son of princess Kekayi,  while going to Kekaya country from  Ayodhya had to cross river Vitasta and then after crossing river Sudama, he reached the land of the Kekayas.

Kekaya and Avanti 

At some places in Mahabharata, people of Avanti is mentioned as Kekayas. This could be an oral-transmission error crept into Mahabharata, or a translation error, or could mean some tribal-link between Avanti and Kekaya. Similar to other western rulers, like the Kambojas, the Kekayas also had migrated to east, hence in principle, could reach Avanti. In fact, in Ramayana, there is some indication of a Kekaya kingdom in the eastern sea-shore !

Vinda and Anuvinda of Avanti, with their troops encountered Virata, the ruler of Matsyas at the head of his forces. That awful encounter between the Matsyas and the Kekayas was terrible. (7,23).
Satyaki (a Pandava general, belonging to the Yadava clan, who was a disciple in arms, of Arjuna) checked the Kaikaya princes Vinda and Anuvinda. The two Kaikaya princes, in that battle, shrouded Satyaki. Satyaki shrouded the Kaikaya brothers. Satyaki cut the head of Anuvinda with a razor arrow, sorrowing the Kaikeyas. Satyaki next slew Vinda in a sword fight. Amazingly these Vinda and Anuvinda resemble in name to the two other princes named Vinda and Anuvinda who were from Avanti. They however were slain by Arjuna (7,96)
