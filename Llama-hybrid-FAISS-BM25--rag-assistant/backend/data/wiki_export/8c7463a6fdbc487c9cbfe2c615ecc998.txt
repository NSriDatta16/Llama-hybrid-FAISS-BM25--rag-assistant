Anthony of Sienna (?–2 January 1585) was a Portuguese Dominican theologian, so called because of his great veneration for Saint Catherine of Siena. He was born near Braga in Portugal. He studied at Lisbon, Coimbra, and Louvain, eventually coming to teach philosophy at Louvain. There he was made Doctor of Theology in 1571, and in 1574 was put in charge of the Dominican college there.

He was a supporter of António, Prior of Crato, in his claim to the throne of Portugal during the Portuguese succession crisis of 1580; because of this, he was banished from the Spanish dominions. He travelled through Italy, England, and France, studying and writing, until his death at Nantes on 2 January 1585.
