The Sawtooth is a jagged arête joining Mount Bierstadt to (eventually) Mount Blue Sky in the Front Range of central Colorado. The three points along this arête resemble the teeth of a saw, leading to its name. The southeast wall of the arête is the head of the cirque above Abyss Lake, while its northwest wall is the cirque at the head of a valley above Guanella Pass. The northeast end of the sawtooth joins directly to the shoulder of Mount Spalding, from which a second (and slightly less abrupt) arête leads southeast to Mount Blue Sky. This second arête divides the glacial valley of Abyss Lake to the southwest from the cirque of Summit Lake to the northeast.
