Mirabel-aux-Baronnies (; ) is a commune in the  Drôme department in the  Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region in southeastern France.

Perched on top of a hill, Mirabel is renowned for its mild climate and scenery. It was first mentioned in 1059 as Mirabello Castello.

Mirabel-aux-Baronnies is situated next to the river Gaude on a hill halfways between Nyons and Vaison-la-Romaine and had a castle with a tower so high that one could see Orange in Vaucluse. The castle incorporated the chapel of Saint Julien.

History
Mirabel-aux-Baronnies is the former capital of a Vocontii tribe, the Gaudenses. It is said that Mirabel has its name from the previously mentioned high tower of the former castle, the tower was named Turris Mirabellis. Later known as Castrum Mirabellum, it was part of the county of the Montauban-family. 9 October 1206, baron Dragonet de Montauban and his son Raymond exchanged with Eliarde, abesse of Saint-Cesaire of Arles, Mirabel and its surroundings for the signeurship of Vinsobres. 
After annexation of the baronies by the Dauphin, Mirabel grew in importance (it had even its own money) and in number of inhabitants. The castle was fortified  and enlarged, the chapel of St-Julien was rebuilt. The domaine de Beaulieu, at the south of Mirabel became one of the principal residences of the Dauphin. In the 14th century Mirabel was heavily damaged by the religion-based wars. 
Until 1348 Mirabel-aux-Baronnies did have a Jewish quarter called Les Josiols, positioned outside the walls on the north next to the creek Françonne. Due to the suspicion they caused the Black Death, the Jews were either expelled or assassinated in 1348. The houses in the quarter were destroyed.

After the arrival of Protestantism in the region, Mirabel-aux-Baronnies changed a lot. First, the chapel of St-Julien was destroyed and in 1633 the castle and a part of the walls. Those walls were restored in 1652 because again the pest was feared, and equipped with 4 new gates. The present church is reconstructed on the remains of the old chapel during 1645-1651.
Between 1790 en 1800, Mirabel was chief-lieu of the Canton. After July 1794 (murder of Robespierre) Mirabel was a major centre of royalist parties.

Mirabel-aux-Baronnies was one of the first villages having a public water system. In 1876, Italian specialists were hired. They lived for several years in Mirabel and even had an own school for their children. The water coming from the source Tune, more than  outside the village, was captured and fed into a system of in-situ made concrete tubes of 20 cm diameter (see figure), alimenting 2 fountains and 4 reservoirs (F: lavoir) with fresh drinking water. The fountains, one of which originated in the 13th century and was later adapted for use with the water system, are still in good condition. Those eldest fountain is situated on the old market-square.
