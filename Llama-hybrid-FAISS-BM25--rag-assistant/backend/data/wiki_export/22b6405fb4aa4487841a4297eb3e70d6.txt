Mome was a quarterly full-color comics anthology edited by Eric Reynolds and published by Fantagraphics Books. ("Mome" is an archaic term for a fool or a blockhead.)

Mome was conceived as a contemporary literary journal, albeit one that tells its stories via the medium of comics rather than prose. It features stories by a core roster of young cartoonists, including Andrice Arp, Gabrielle Bell, Jonathan Bennett, Jeffrey Brown, Martin Cendreda, Sophie Crumb, Eleanor Davis, David Heatley, Paul Hornschemeier, Anders Nilsen, John Pham, and Kurt Wolfgang; as well as irregular contributions from other cartoonists such as Al Columbia, Jim Woodring and Tim Hensley. Each issue also includes an interview with one of the contributors conducted by Gary Groth.

Mome's final issue, #22, was published in 2011 and was a 240-page double-sized issue.
