Ludo is a 1967 album by Ivor Cutler, credited to the 'Ivor Cutler Trio' comprising Cutler with bassist Gill Lyons and percussionist Trevor Tomkins. The album was produced by George Martin, famous for his work with the Beatles, in a collaboration that came about after Cutler had appeared in the Beatles' Magical Mystery Tour film earlier that year. The album's title and cover allude to the board game of the same name. The music takes inspiration from trad jazz and boogie-woogie and draws comparisons to The Goon Show. Four of the album's tracks are spoken stories, some backed with Cutler's ambient harmonium music.
