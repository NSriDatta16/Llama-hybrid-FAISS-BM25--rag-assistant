Ann Elise Strother (born December 11, 1983) is an American  basketball coach, and former professional player, most recently for the Indiana Fever. Strother played at the collegiate level for the Connecticut Huskies, helping the team to two national titles.

Early life
Strother spent her childhood in eastern Iowa. Her family moved to Castle Rock, Colorado when she was in 8th grade.  Strother was introduced to basketball by her father Kenneth, who played at the University of Northern Iowa for a semester.  She became so good at basketball that she received her first college-recruiting letter from the University of Iowa, when she was only in eighth grade.

High school
She went to Heritage High School for two years then transferred to Highlands Ranch High School where she helped the basketball team to win two Colorado State Championships. Strother was named a WBCA All-American. She participated in the 2002 WBCA High School All-America Game, where she scored nine points. Strother was also named to play in the inaugural (2002) McDonald's All-American Game, where she was named co-MVP.   During the summer after her freshman and sophomore years of high school, Strother played for a team that went to Paris for two weeks to play in a tournament.  Strother played on an Athletic Amateur Union team and while traveling to tournaments, she used her time wisely visiting schools that would later help her in making her college selection decision.  During the summer before her senior year of high school, Strother was selected to play on the USA Junior World Championship Team (now known as U19) in the Czech Republic. Strother was the leading scorer in the win over China, and fifth leading scorer over all, helping the US to a 6–1 record and a bronze medal. Strother became only the second high school player in USA Basketball history to receive the honor of playing for the Junior World Championship Team, the other being Lisa Leslie in 1989. Geno Auriemma coached the USA team that year.   After that she decided to commit to UConn. Strother was named the Naismith High School National Player of the Year in her senior year (2002) and was the 2001-02 girls' basketball Gatorade National Player of the Year.

College

Strother was recruited by national powerhouses such as the University of Connecticut (UConn), the University of Tennessee, the University of Georgia, Stanford University, Notre Dame University, and Purdue University before ultimately committing to Connecticut. At UConn, Strother would play for future Hall of Fame inductee Geno Auriemma and alongside two-time National Player of the Year Diana Taurasi while helping Connecticut to its fourth and fifth national titles. Strother played in all 143 games of her collegiate career and started in 142. She averaged 12.9 points per game in her career and 14.0 in her senior season despite festering foot problems. Strother would eventually finish seventh all-time among UConn scorers with 1699 career points, and second all-time in career three-point field goals with 290. Strother joined some elite company when she became only the second player in UConn history to amass more than 1600 points, 600 rebounds, 400 assists, 100 steals, and 100 blocks- the other being Diana Taurasi. Strother also excelled in the classroom as she was a Dean's List student all four of her years at UConn.  In December 2006, Strother graduated from UConn with a degree in psychology.

While just a freshman, Strother was invited to play on the 2003 Pan American team (along with freshman classmate Barbara Turner. The young team would earn a silver medal, going 5–2, both losses to gold medal winner Cuba. Strother started six of seven games, and averaged 7.9 points per games, fifth best on her team.

Although the UConn faithful normally embrace former players, Strother attended a UConn vs. Notre Dame basketball game in early 2010 wearing a Notre Dame sweatshirt, leading to some ridicule from current UConn students (her boyfriend's brother was playing for Notre Dame at the time).
