Tenebre is the soundtrack to Dario Argento's film of the same title, first released as an album in 1982, and reissued most recently in 2006 with multiple bonus tracks. The score was composed and performed by Claudio Simonetti, Fabio Pignatelli, and Massimo Morante, three former members of the defunct rock group Goblin who briefly reunited at the request of Argento. Although the movie itself credits the score to "Simonetti-Pignatelli-Morante", the soundtrack album is credited to "Simonetti-Morante-Pignatelli".

In 2007, "Tenebre", the first track, was sampled by French electronic music duo Justice on their album Cross, in the songs "Phantom" and "Phantom Pt. II".

In April 2018, a double vinyl edition of the soundtrack was released by Waxwork Records in a limited edition.
