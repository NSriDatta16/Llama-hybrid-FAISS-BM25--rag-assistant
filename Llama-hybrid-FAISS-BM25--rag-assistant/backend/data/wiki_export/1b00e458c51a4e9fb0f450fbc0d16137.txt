Biography

Early life
Spike Dawbarn was born in Warrington, Cheshire to parents Mo and Mike Dawbarn. He also has two brothers. Although he attended some dance college afterwards, his secondary education at Beamont Collegiate Academy ended at the age of sixteen when he could not get a grant to go to a London stage school. He had a brief spell as a bricklayer on a building site, a position from which he was sacked. He acquired the nickname 'Spike' because of his hairstyle.

The Hit Man and Her and 911
