The  is a lamp consisting of paper stretched over a frame of bamboo, wood or metal. The paper protected the flame from the wind. Burning oil in a stone, metal, or ceramic holder, with a wick of cotton or pith, provided the light. They were usually open on the top and bottom, with one side that could be lifted to provide access. Rapeseed oil was popular. Candles were also used, but their higher price made them less popular. A lower-priced alternative was sardine oil.

The  became popular in the Edo period (1603–1867). Early on, the  was handheld; it could also be placed on a stand or hung on a wall. The  was most common indoors. Many had a vertical box shape with an inner stand for the light. Some had a drawer on the bottom to facilitate refilling and lighting. A handle on top made it portable. A variety was the .

The spiral structure permits it to be collapsed into the basket at the bottom. The  is used outdoors, either carried or hung outside the house.
