The Regius Chair of Medicine and Therapeutics is considered the oldest chair at the University of Glasgow, Scotland. It was formed in 1989 from the merge of the Regius Chairs of the Practice of Medicine (founded in 1637) and of Materia Medica (founded in 1831). The chair has so far had two occupants, Professor John Reid, who was previously Regius Professor of Materia Medica and - since 2010 - Professor Anna Felicja Dominiczak, the first woman to have ever held the post.

Regius Professor of the Practice of Medicine
The Chair of the Practice of Medicine was founded in 1637 and, after a lapse, revived in 1712. It was endowed by Queen Anne in 1713, becoming the Regius Chair.
