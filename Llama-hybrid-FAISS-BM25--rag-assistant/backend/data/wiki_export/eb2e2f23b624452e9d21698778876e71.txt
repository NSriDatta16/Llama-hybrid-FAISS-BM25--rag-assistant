Angelina Ballerina is a children's book series by author Katharine Holabird and illustrator Helen Craig about a fictional mouse named Angelina Jeanette Mouseling who is training to become a ballerina.

History
The first book in the series was published in 1983, and since then, there have been over 20 books in the series. The series is set in Chipping Cheddar, a place that is similar to 1920s London, and is inhabited by anthropomorphic mice. The name Angelina was inspired by an editor named Angela at Aurum Press.

The books have been adapted by HIT Entertainment into two animated television series: Angelina Ballerina (2001-2006) and the CGI-animated Angelina Ballerina: The Next Steps (2009-2010). It has also been adapted as a touring ballet.
