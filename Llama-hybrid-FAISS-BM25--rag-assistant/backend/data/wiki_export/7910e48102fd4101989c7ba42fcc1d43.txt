History 

The station was opened in April 1863, and was then part of the Glasgow and Milngavie Junction Railway. Originally built with three platforms, one platform has since been removed. The land where the third platform once stood has been sold. The line was doubled in 1900, but was singled again in 1990.

During December 2020, the 141 metre long platforms were extended to 205 metres by reinstating 39 metres of unused platform and adding a further 25 metres of new platform. The project cost Â£5 million.

Location 

The station is the usual access point for the  long West Highland Way, a long-distance trail which officially starts in Milngavie town centre marked by a granite obelisk. The first few hundred yards of the way follow the line of short spur along railway originally built to serve the Ellangowan Paper Mills.

A pedestrian underpass links the station to the town centre, which is also pedestrianised, and the southern end of the West Highland Way long-distance footpath to Fort William.
