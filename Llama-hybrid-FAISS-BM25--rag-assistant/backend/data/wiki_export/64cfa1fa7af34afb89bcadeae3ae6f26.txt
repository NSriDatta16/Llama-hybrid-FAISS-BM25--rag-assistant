The EcoTarium is a science and nature museum located in Worcester, Massachusetts. Previously known as the New England Science Center, the museum features several permanent and traveling exhibits, the Alden Planetarium, a narrow-gauge train pulled by a scale model of an 1860s steam engine, and a variety of wildlife.

History
The EcoTarium was founded in 1825 as the Worcester Lyceum of Natural History. The first spaces dedicated to the museum were the Natural History Rooms on the third floor of the Worcester Bank Block on Foster Street, which opened on October 1, 1867. In 1891 the museum and its collection moved to the Old Edwin Conant Mansion at the corner of State and Harvard streets.

As the collection grew more and more space was needed. In 1954 the museum moved exhibits to the Daniels House and the Rice House at 41 Elm street, both in Worcester. The final move took place in 1971 to a new building, designed by Edward Durell Stone, built on  of donated land. At this point the name of the museum was changed to the Worcester Science Center, then changed again in 1986 to the New England Science Center.

In 1998 the museum yet again changed its name to the EcoTarium, and began an $18 million expansion and renovation project which was completed in 2000.

On June 13, 2011, Kenda the Polar Bear, a mainstay at the museum, died after developing kidney disease, a degenerative disease commonly found in older polar bears. After a steep decline in her health, the museum made the decision to euthanize Kenda. Following the launch of its "Third Century Plan," the museum announced it would transform the area formerly occupied by Kenda into "Wildcat Station."

In June 2016, the museum unveiled its "Third Century Plan," a $9.1 million capital campaign which will fund improvements to both its indoor and outdoor exhibits, programming, and infrastructure. Major components of this capital campaign include two new permanent exhibits ("City Science" and "Wildcat Station"), a new modern energy-efficient mechanical plant to replace its aged co-generation plant, and enhancements to its Explorer Express Train (including a new station that will be contracted at Wildcat Station).

On January 17, 2017, the museum opened "City Science," one of two new exhibits being funded by its capital campaign.
