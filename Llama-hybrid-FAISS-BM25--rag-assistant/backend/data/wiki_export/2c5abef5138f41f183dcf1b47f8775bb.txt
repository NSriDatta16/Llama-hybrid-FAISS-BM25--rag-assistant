The Lamborghini Bravo is a concept car designed by Marcello Gandini at Bertone for Lamborghini. It was first presented in 1974 at the Turin Auto Show.

The Bravo was designed to showcase ideas for a replacement to the Urraco. The completely working prototype was built on a Urraco chassis, with the wheelbase shortened by 175mm, and featured a 3.0L  V8 that powered the rear wheels, undergoing nearly  of testing before it was placed in the Bertone museum. It was never put into production, but many styling features were inspired by the Countach, including the angular features and the window arrangement.

The Bravo was sold at auction for â‚¬588,000 on 21 May 2011. The Bravo has had several different paints, first a pearlescent yellow, then green, followed by champagne and lastly white.  These colour changes have led to incorrect speculation that multiple cars were produced, but official sources confirm only one was made.
