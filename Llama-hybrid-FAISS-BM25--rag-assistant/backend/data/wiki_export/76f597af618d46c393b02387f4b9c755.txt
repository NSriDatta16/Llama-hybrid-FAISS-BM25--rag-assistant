The East Bengal Ground, also known as East Bengal–Aryan Ground, is the home stadium of East Bengal and Aryan. The stadium has a capacity of 23,500 people. It is one of the venues for Calcutta Football League.

The stadium lies in the Kolkata Maidan area on the northern side of Fort William and it is near the Eden Gardens. The Esplanade metro station on the North-South Corridor of the Kolkata Metro is also nearby.

History
When East Bengal Club was formed in 1920, they used to play at the Kumortuli Park Ground in the initial days. In 1921, East Bengal Club started playing in the Calcutta Football League Second Division. Most of the matches were held at the Calcutta FC Ground.

After the 1923 season, East Bengal Club owners were in the lookout for a club ground of their own where the team can play their matches. According to the existing rule of the maidan, two clubs used to share one common ground. Club's founders and then vice-presidents, Shri Sureshchandra Choudhury and Raybahadur Taritbhushan Ray came to learn that Mohun Bagan shared its ground with National Association, which by that time had ceased to exist. They referred this discrepancy to the police authorities and subsequently demanded the share for East Bengal. It was then that Police Commissioner Charles Tegart ordered Mohun Bagan to share its ground with East Bengal. This sudden decision enraged the Mohun Bagan officials. However, despite their protests, East Bengal Club got the ground for their own in 1924, which they co-shared with their arch-rivals Mohun Bagan until 1963, when finally Mohun Bagan moved out to their own Mohun Bagan Ground. In those days, the goalposts were placed east–west and East Bengal took possession of the half towards the Red Road. Another century-old Kolkata club, Aryan F.C. started sharing the club ground since then.

About

The East Bengal Ground has galleries on three sides. The west side is the member's gallery with modern facilities like bucket seats and elevators installed. The half of west side is also shared with Aryan F.C. who have their member's gallery as well, covered in bucket seats which acts as an away gallery for the matches which East Bengal F.C. plays. The east side and north side galleries are still made of a temporary wooden and steel structure and are designated for non-member supporters. The playing pitch is about 100 metres x 60 metres in dimension. Just adjacent the stadium, below the member's gallery is the club tent and the main office located. In 2014, the club tent opened its own cafe lounge for the fans, just beside the members' gallery.

Renovations

First Renovation in 1996
On 12 July 1996, the new Club Office or "Tent", which is popularly known in Kolkata maidan, was inaugurated by the oldest member of the East Bengal Club. The then club secretary Mr. Dipak "Poltu" Das gave the honour to Mr. Shankar Pillai (popularly known as Shankar Mali) who was the oldest groundsman and caretaker of the club, to inaugurate the new club tent in the presence of club legends like Ahmed Khan and Byomkesh Bose.

The club ground was renovated and a new office was setup at the place where it is currently situated. The playing field was relaid North to South and the new fans gallery was constructed.

Second Renovation post 2016
In 2016, renovations were done at the ground with entire playing field being relaid and galleries being renovated with member's gallery being filled in with Red and Gold bucket seats. Elevators were installed and the commentary box was modernised. The playing turf was relaid and drainage was improved for the ground. East Bengal FC officials informed the AIFF that they wanted to host I-League matches at the club ground after the heavy renovations.

In 2018, floodlights were installed at the East Bengal Ground. The flood lights would be the biggest among the three Maidan clubs of Kolkata. The first match under floodlights was played in the 2018–19 Calcutta Premier Division when East Bengal faced Tollygunge Agragami in the season opener, which was however abandoned due to heavy rains as the match was tied 1–1 at half time.

In 2023, East Bengal built a luxurious VVIP lounge at the East Bengal Ground and named it after Krishanu Dey.
