This list of the oldest schools in the United Kingdom contains extant schools in the United Kingdom established prior to 1700 and a few former schools established prior to the Reformation. The dates refer to the foundation or the earliest documented contemporary reference to the school. In many cases the date of the original foundation is uncertain. For conciseness schools whose date is cited on their own page in Wikipedia are not cited again here. Though not technically in the United Kingdom, one school (Elizabeth College) in Guernsey – which forms part of the British Isles – is included in this list.
