The LSU Tigers and Lady Tigers are the athletic teams representing Louisiana State University (LSU), a state university located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. LSU competes in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) as a member of the Southeastern Conference (SEC).

Nickname
The Louisiana State University official team nickname is the Fighting Tigers, Tigers or Lady Tigers. At one time, the "Lady Tigers" nickname was used only in sports that have teams for both men and women—specifically basketball, cross country, golf, swimming and diving, tennis, and track and field (indoor and outdoor); however, since 2017, only women's basketball, cross country, and track and field use the "Lady Tigers" moniker.

Sports sponsored

With LSU primarily competing in the Southeastern Conference and the women's beach volleyball program competing in the Coastal Collegiate Sports Association, LSU sponsors teams in nine men's and twelve women's NCAA sanctioned sports.

By winning the SEC championship in men's basketball for the 2008–2009 season, LSU became the first SEC school to win at least 10 SEC championships in each of the big three sports of football, men's basketball, and baseball. LSU was the first SEC school to win at least one national championship in each of the big three sports.

LSU won their second national championship during the 2003 season by defeating the Oklahoma Sooners in the 2004 BCS National Championship Game.

Former varsity sports

Boxing

LSU boxing started as a club sport in 1929 and enjoyed its first varsity season in 1930. The Tigers held matches at the Huey P. Long Field House and starting in 1937 at the John M. Parker Agricultural Coliseum.

In LSU's first season, the team had a record of 5–2; they went 6–1 in the ensuing 1931 campaign. In 1934, LSU won its first Southeastern Conference title by beating rival Tulane. Late in the 1930s, LSU won additional SEC titles and finished with a second-place finish in the 1939 NCAA Tournament and a third-place finish in 1940 NCAA Tournament. Some Tiger stalwarts during this period were Heston Daniel, Al Michael, Snyder Parham and Dub Robinson. World War II interrupted the sport, but LSU returned to varsity boxing in 1948.

The 1949 campaign, LSU's second season after the war, proved to be its best. Paced by individual national champions Wilbert "Pee Wee" Moss and Edsel "Tad" Thrash and coached by Jim Owen, the Tigers went undefeated in regular season play. They finished the year by beating South Carolina in front of 11,000 fans in Parker Coliseum, en route to its first and only national title. Boxing at LSU continued as a varsity sport during the early 1950s as LSU fans watched LSU greats Calvin Clary, Crowe Peele and Bobby Freeman. Late in the decade, a dwindling number of schools in the region that sponsored boxing as a varsity sport led to higher travel costs for the LSU team. Ultimately, LSU announced in 1956 it would no longer support boxing on the varsity level.

LSU recorded an all-time dual meet record of 101–22–6, one national championship, 31 individual conference champions, 11 individual NCAA champions and 12 NCAA runners-up.

Men's wrestling
LSU fielded a varsity men's wrestling team from 1968 to 1985. It won seven Southeastern Conference titles. The team also had two eighth-place finishes in the NCAA Tournament in 1983 and 1984. The wrestling program was dropped as a result of Title IX compliance in 1985.

From 1968 to 1978, LSU was coached by Dale Ketelsen. His teams won two Southeastern Conference wrestling tournament titles. He produced 15 individual conference champions and was also a member of the NCAA wrestling rules committee while at LSU. From 1979 to 1985, the team was coached by Larry Sciacchetano. His teams won five Southeastern Conference titles.

Men's wrestlers
 Phil Bode was the 1971 and 1972 SEC champion.
 Jules Plaisance enrolled at LSU in 1969 and won three Southeastern Conference championships at 142, 150, & 158 lb. weight classes. He finished second once.
 John Tenta, who went on to fame in the World Wrestling Federation, was a heavyweight wrestler at LSU.

More recently, LSU rugby has been successful in conference play and in national competition. LSU plays in the Southeastern Conference against its traditional SEC rivals.

Tiger Stadium is the home stadium of the LSU football team. The stadium is also known by its nickname, "Death Valley". It opened in 1924 with an original seating capacity of 12,000. Tiger Stadium currently has a seating capacity of 102,321, making it the sixth largest stadium in the NCAA and the ninth largest stadium in the world.

Tiger Stadium also has some unique features. Unlike most football fields, where only the yard lines ending in "0" are marked, Tiger Stadium also marks the yard lines ending in "5". It also has "H" style (or "offset") goal posts, as opposed to the more modern "Y" ("slingshot" or "tuning fork") style used by other schools today, although they are not the true "H" goal posts which were once ubiquitous on American football fields, since the posts are behind the uprights and connected to the uprights by curved bars. This "H" style allows the team to run through the goal post in the north end zone. The crossbar from the goalposts which stood in the north end zone of Tiger Stadium from 1955 through 1984 is now mounted above the door which leads from LSU's locker room onto the playing field. The crossbar is painted with the word "WIN!", and superstition dictates every player entering the field touch the bar on his way out the door.

LSU traditions

Mike the Tiger

Mike the Tiger is the official mascot of Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and serves as the graphic image of LSU athletics. Mike is the name of both the live and costumed mascots. Mike the Tiger lives in a habitat (situated between Tiger Stadium and the Pete Maravich Assembly Center) which includes among its amenities lush plantings, a waterfall, a flowing stream that empties into a wading pond, and rocky plateaus.

School colors
LSU's official colors are Royal Purple and Old Gold. There is some discrepancy in the origin of LSU's current official colors. It is believed that purple and gold were first worn by an LSU team in the spring of 1893 when the LSU baseball squad beat Tulane in the first intercollegiate contest played in any sport by Louisiana State University.

In another story, before LSU's first ever football game, football coach/chemistry professor Dr. Charles E. Coates and some of his players purchased ribbon to adorn their gray jerseys as they prepared to play the first LSU football game versus Tulane. Stores were stocking ribbons in the colors of Mardi Gras—purple, gold and green—for the coming Carnival season. However, none of the green had arrived, so all of the purple and gold stock were purchased.

LSU's original school colors were white and blue chosen by Superintendent/President David F. Boyd (1865–1880).

"Fight for LSU"

"Fight for LSU" is the university's official fight song. The band plays "Fight for LSU" often, most notably when the team enters the field (while the band is in a tunnel formation at the end of its pregame performance), successfully kicks a field goal, scores an extra point, or completes a two-point conversion. Following a halftime performance, the band often exits the field while playing "Fight for LSU."

Louisiana State University Tiger Marching Band

The Louisiana State University Tiger Marching Band (also called The Golden Band from Tigerland or simply the Tiger Band) is known by LSU fans and foes alike for the first four notes of its pregame salute sounded on Saturday nights in Tiger Stadium. This 325-member marching band performs at all LSU football home games, all bowl games, and select away games and represents the university at other functions as one of its most recognizable student and spirit organizations.

On football game days, the band marches from the band hall to Tiger Stadium, stopping along the way at Victory Hill, located right outside the stadium. "Thousands of fans lining North Stadium Drive listen for the cadence of drums announcing the band's departure from the Greek Theatre" and await the impending arrival of the band. The band stops on the hill and begins to play the opening strains of the "Pregame Salute." Then, while playing the introduction to "Touchdown for LSU," the band begins to run in tempo through the streets and down the hill amidst the crowd of cheering fans. The band also marches from the stadium to the band hall upon the conclusion of the game, a practice not usually employed by other bands.

One of the most celebrated traditions carried on by the band is its pregame performance at each home football game. The performance includes pieces from the band's expansive repertoire of school songs, including "Pregame Salute"/"Touchdown for LSU". The band begins the performance in the south end zone of the stadium and is called to attention by the drum major right before he marches out across the end zone in front of the band. Stopping at the goal line, the drum major wields his mace and uses his whistle to signal the band to take the field. The band marches out of the end zone to the beat of a single bass drum. The Golden Girls and color guard accompany the band on the field. The band stands at attention and then plays the opening chords of the salute (which are taken from the tune "Tiger Rag"), the band turns to face all four corners of the stadium. The crowd explodes in cheers. Once the band salutes each part of the stadium, the pace of the music and the marching picks up, the music transitions into Long's "Touchdown for LSU," and the band sweeps the field. Toward the end of the song, the band breaks the fronts and spells out "LSU."

In the "LSU" formation, the band plays the "LSU Alma Mater" and the "Star-Spangled Banner. The band then plays LSU's official fight song, "Fight for LSU" as it salutes both sides of the stadium. Upon switching formations, the band plays the second half of "Tiger Rag," which culminates in the crowd chanting "T-I-G-E-R-S, TIGERS!' in unison. This is followed the "First Down Cheer," to which the crowd in unison responds to each of the three refrains with "GEAUX! TIGERS!" and to the final refrain with "LSU!" The band immediately breaks into an encore performance of "Touchdown for LSU" as it marches to the north end zone, and then breaks to form a tunnel through which the football team will enter the field.

The band also performs on first, second, and third down when the Tigers are on offense. The "First Down Cheer" includes the "Hold that Tiger" musical phrase from "Tiger Rag." The "Third Down Cheer" is based on the song "Eye of the Tiger" made famous by Survivor. The piece, "Tiger Bandits" was created to pay homage to the defensive unit from the 1958 national championship football team. Coach Paul Dietzel called the unit the "Chinese Bandits." The title of the song was eventually changed to "Tiger Bandits" (or just simply "Bandits"). The band plays the song when the LSU defense forces the opposing team to give up possession of the football. With arms extended out, LSU fans bow to pay homage to the defensive stop.

Bengal Brass
The Bengal Brass is a group of 60 members selected from the ranks of the band constitute the Bengal Brass Basketball Band, often simply referred to as Bengal Brass. This group of all-brass musicians (and percussionist on a trap set) is often split into two squads—purple and gold—and performs at LSU select home volleyball matches, many home gymnastics meets, all home men's basketball, and all home women's basketball games in the Pete Maravich Assembly Center. Bengal Brass also travels with the men's and women's basketball teams during postseason play.

Golden Girls and Colorguard

The LSU Golden Girls, a feature unit with the Tiger Band and the oldest and most established danceline on the LSU campus, was created in 1959 as the Ballet Corps by then director of bands Thomas Tyra. The Golden Girl moniker became official in 1965. Today, the line includes 14 to 18 dancers who audition each year to make the line and who are often members of private dance studios. The Golden Girls fall under the Department of Bands in the School of Music. Blair Buras Guillaume is the director of the team. Members must audition every year, and receive college credit for participation.

The LSU Colorguard, a flag twirling unit not to be confused with a traditional military colorguard, was established in 1971. Twenty-four to twenty- eight female twirlers are selected from an audition process.

LSU Cheerleaders

The LSU Cheerleaders consist of both male and female cheerleaders that perform at LSU football and men's and women's basketball games. The cheerleaders lead the crowd in numerous cheers during game play and breaks. Prior to home football games the LSU cheerleaders ride atop Mike the Tiger's mobile unit, lead the crowd in cheers such as the "Geaux Tigers" cheer and lead the football team onto the field prior to the game and after halftime. The cheerleaders are located on both sidelines during football games and are located along the baseline for home basketball games. LSU's cheerleaders also compete against other universities cheerleading squads in competitions sanctioned by the Universal Cheerleaders Association (UCA). The 1989 Tiger cheerleaders won the UCA National Championship.

LSU Tiger Girls
