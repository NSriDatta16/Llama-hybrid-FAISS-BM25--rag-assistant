History

The main road crossing the suburb, today known as Vicars Cross Road (A51), once made up part of the Roman roads of Watling Street and Via Devana.  For most of Chester's history, the area which now makes up Vicars Cross consisted of farmland situated just over a mile away from the city centre (with Brook House and Crow Farm being noteworthy). During the industrial revolution, the westernmost part of the area became the site of a brick factory. It first became a residential settlement of the city of Chester during the mid 20th century, as more homes were needed to support the growing population of the United Kingdom.
