Martin Davis Eichelberger, Jr. (born September 3, 1943) is an American professional golfer who has won several tournaments at both the PGA Tour and Champions Tour levels.

Eichelberger was born in Waco, Texas. He started in the game at the age of 13 in the junior programs at his family's golf club in Waco. He attended Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, Oklahoma; and while there blossomed into an outstanding amateur. He led the Oklahoma State Cowboys to the 1963 NCAA Championship. He graduated in 1965 and turned pro in 1966.

Eichelberger has twelve professional victories. Four of which came on the PGA Tour, plus six Champions Tour triumphs. On his way to a win at the 2002 Emerald Coast Classic, Eichelberger made a hole-in-one from 185 yards at the par 3 eighth hole during the first round of play.

Although he is a native Texan, Eichelberger lived most of his adult life in New Canaan, Connecticut. In 2003, he moved to Honolulu, Hawaii, where he lives today with his wife, son and daughter – fraternal twins.
