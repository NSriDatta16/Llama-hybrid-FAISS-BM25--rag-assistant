Brent Arthur Titcomb (born August 10, 1940) is a Canadian actor and musician.  He plays guitar, percussion, harmonica, and jaw harp.

Music career
Titcomb was the original member of the folk-rock group 3's A Crowd.  They began in 1965, in Vancouver, and later moved to Toronto.  They played coffeehouses and festivals.  In concert, he was the comic of the group where he used an odd-sounding vacuum cleaner as part of the routine.  They released an album titled Christopher's Movie Matinee, with the help of Cass Elliott.

In 1968, Titcomb went solo and toured Canada and parts of Europe.  His songs were recorded by Anne Murray, Andy Williams, Glen Campbell, and The Osmond Brothers.  He was a member of Murray's touring band.  He performed with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra.

Starting in 1976, Titcomb became a mainstay performer at Festival of Friends in Hamilton, Ontario.  Over the years, he has appeared there twenty five times and has headlined the event a record five times.  He also appeared at the New Orleans World's Fair and in Mexico in 1984.  Titcomb became involved in environmental and human rights causes.  He sang before the Dalai Lama during one of the religious leader's rare Toronto visits.  He also played at the Jacques Cousteau Festival in Hamilton.

In 1980, he released the album Time Traveler, which gained attention as far away as Australia.  In 1993, he released a greatest hits CD titled Healing Of Her Heart.  In 2001, he released Beyond Appearances.  These two CDs have different versions of his song Tibetan Bells.  He did Tibetan throat singing in both versions.  In many of his songs, he used his own unique musical language.  He also performed the songs of Doug Carpenter and Ian Tamblyn.

In 2009, he joined the folk rock group Lee Harvey Osmond, with Tom Wilson as frontman.  He is on two of the group's CDs.
