Theory in Practice is a Swedish technical death metal band founded in 1995, which borrows heavily from progressive metal. The band writes technical and complex songs consisting of a lot of time and tempo changes. After a year of rehearsals and gigs, they recorded a demo called Submissive in the Abyss Studio, and three full-length albums after that. In December 2002, the band went on hiatus and began recording again in February 2003.
