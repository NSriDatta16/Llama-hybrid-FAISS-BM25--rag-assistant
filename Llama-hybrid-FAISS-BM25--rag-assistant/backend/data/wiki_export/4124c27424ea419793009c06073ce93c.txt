Shettleston railway station serves the Shettleston area of Glasgow, Scotland and is 3½ miles (5 km) east of Glasgow Queen Street railway station on the North Clyde Line. The station is managed by ScotRail.

History 
Shettleston was opened on 1 February 1871 when the Coatbridge Branch of the North British Railway opened. In 1877, the station became a junction with the opening of the Glasgow, Bothwell, Hamilton and Coatbridge Railway with the commencement of freight services to Bothwell on 1 November 1877 and passenger services on 1 April 1878. The line closed to passenger traffic in July 1955 and completely in 1961 (except for a short section to Mount Vernon that survived for a further four years).

In 2010, Shettleston station received bilingual name boards, in English and Gaelic, the Gaelic reading "Baile Nighean Sheadna". Shettleston station facilities include a ticket office, ticket vending machine, waiting shelter, footbridge, clock, train information displays and seating. The station has two platforms. There is also a car park and a cycle parking stand.

In 2011, the footbridge was replaced - like many others on the North Clyde Line the previous structure had been built as part of the 1959 electrification and was in very poor structural condition.
