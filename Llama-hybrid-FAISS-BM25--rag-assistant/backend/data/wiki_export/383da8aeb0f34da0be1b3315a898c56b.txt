Foxdale mines

In the 19th century there were 13 mines and workings in the area of Foxdale, which included five mines working the Foxdale shear. The mines yielded a rich output of zinc blende, lead ore and silver. In time, the mines came under the ownership of the Isle of Man Mining Company who operated the mines until their closure in 1911.
The mines ceased operation after many incidents, including a member of the Lalor smith family dying inside due to sulphur dioxide poisoning from the air.

Victoria Clock Tower

Today, the most prominent feature in the village is the Victoria Clock Tower, built and paid for by the Isle of Man Mining Company. Designed by Foxdale mine engineer John Nicholls the structure is  in height and is visible across the valley. The Dedication Ceremony took place on Thursday 16 May 1901 and was an occasion of immense civic pride for the village of Foxdale.
