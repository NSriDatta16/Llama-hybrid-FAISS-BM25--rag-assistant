1999 Armenian parliament shooting 

On 27 October 1999, Hunanyan and four other gunmen, including his brother Karen Hunanyan and his uncle Vram Galstyan, entered the Armenian parliament building and killed the prime minister Vazgen Sargsyan, speaker of parliament Karen Demirchyan and six other officials. In his statement, Nairi Hunanyan accused the government of leading Armenia into political and economic ruin. The attackers surrendered on 28 October. The five gunmen were later each sentenced to eight life sentences.

Hunanyan claimed that he made the decision to attack parliament by himself and did not receive orders from anyone, although there was much speculation about the true organizers of the attack.
