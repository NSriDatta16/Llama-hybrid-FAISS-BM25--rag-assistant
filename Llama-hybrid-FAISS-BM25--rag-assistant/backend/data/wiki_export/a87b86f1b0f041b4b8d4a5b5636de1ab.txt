Travel Channel International (stylized as Trvl Channel in Asia and Australia since 2021) is a commercial television channel owned by Warner Bros. Discovery and broadcasting travel-themed programmes in the EMEA regions and Asia Pacific, spanning 21 on-air languages.

The channel was formally operated by Travel Channel International Limited (TCI) and, despite the name, it had no relation with the American television channel of the same name. TCI was acquired by Scripps Networks Interactive, owners of the American channel, in May 2012. In March 2018, Discovery, Inc. acquired Scripps Networks Interactive. Beginning in October 2018, the International service has again diverged from the American network in its programming as the latter network was relaunched as a destination for paranormal and supernatural programming.
