Tasos Mitropoulos (, born 23 August 1957) is a Greek politician and former professional footballer who played as a midfielder.

Playing career
Mitropoulos was born in Volos, and started his football career at local team Aris Petroupoli. In 1976, he joined Ethnikos Piraeus, where he played five seasons. In 1981, he moved on to the largest Piraeus club, Olympiacos, winning three league titles and two Greek cup titles with the team.

Mitropoulos later played two seasons for AEK, winning two league titles with them, and for Olympiacos' fierce rivals Panathinaikos, albeit only one game. He returned to Olympiacos in 1997 for a final season, retiring at almost 41. He was given the nickname "Rambo" by Olympiacos fans.
