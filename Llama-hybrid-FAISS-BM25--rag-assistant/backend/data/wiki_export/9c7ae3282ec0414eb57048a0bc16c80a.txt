 Saturdays Alpha, specialist and leadership jobs
 Saturdays Das Magazin (see below)

Das Magazin
Das Magazin (English: The Magazine) is a supplement to the newspaper's Saturday edition. Added in 1970, it mainly features comments and reports on politics and culture. Patterned after The New York Times Magazine, the magazine employs a style and language of its own.

In its early years, the magazine featured articles by writers including Niklaus Meienberg, Peter Bichsel and Laure Wyss, and, as a bastion of journalistic enlightenment in the 1970s, it heavily defined cultural and political discourse in Switzerland.

In 2005, it was added to two other newspapers, the Basler Zeitung and the Berner Zeitung, reaching around 730,000 readers each weekend (approximately ten percent of the Swiss population).  Its main competitor is the weekly Die Weltwoche magazine.
