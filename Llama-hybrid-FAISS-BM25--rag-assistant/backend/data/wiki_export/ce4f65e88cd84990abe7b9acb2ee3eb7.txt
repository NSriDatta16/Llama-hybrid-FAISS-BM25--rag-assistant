Bhola was a part of the Government Model High School Field Hockey team that won the Interschool XI Championship. When he moved to New Delhi, for higher studies, he represented D.A.V High School, Paharganj. He also played hockey for the Brothers Club at the intercollegiate level. While undergoing training at the Air Force Technical College, Banglore he was inducted into the Services Hockey team to play in the National Hockey Championship in March 1953.
