Critical response 
"Gone" received generally positive reviews from critics, who compared the song to  "Since U Been Gone", which is also a track from Breakaway. Charles Merwin of Stylus Magazine wrote that "Gone" "sounds like as though it's grafted the most tame version of Akufen, Christina Aguilera, and latin guitar on top of one another into a hugely satisfying pop masterpiece". The music site, Popservations.com, included it as one of "Clarkson's Best Non-Singles", they wrote that the song "has all the makings of another Clarkson smash, a solid pop-rock production (the stop-start guitar, the filtered drum loop as the chorus kicks in) in which she pointedly tells some loser ex that she's now 'Miss Independent'."
