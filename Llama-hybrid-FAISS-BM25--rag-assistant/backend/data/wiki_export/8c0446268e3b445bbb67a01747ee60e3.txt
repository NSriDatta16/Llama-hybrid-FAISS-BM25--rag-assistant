The 77s is the third album by The 77s, released in 1987 on the Exit and Island Records labels.

The album contains the band's biggest hit single to date, which was "The Lust, The Flesh, The Eyes and the Pride of Life." Years later, the song would be covered by Roe's other band The Lost Dogs (on the album, MUTT), and the band 311 would even "borrow" a few lines from the song for one of their own singles.

The album was listed at No. 82 in the 2001 book, CCM Presents: The 100 Greatest Albums in Christian Music.
