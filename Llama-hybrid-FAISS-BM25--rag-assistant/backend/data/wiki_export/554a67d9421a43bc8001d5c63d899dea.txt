Fatherfucker is the third studio album by Canadian singer Peaches, released on September 23, 2003 by XL Recordings. Cover versions of Electric Six's "Gay Bar" and Berlin's "Sex (I'm a ...)" are included as bonus tracks.

Writing and development
Peaches penned and programmed all the music for Fatherfucker herself. She wrote "Kick It" specifically for Iggy Pop, and the two teamed up in Miami in March 2003 to record it. Peaches told Rolling Stone, "The song is more about rock 'n' roll than sex."

Composition
Musically, Fatherfucker is more rock-oriented than The Teaches of Peaches. "I Don't Give A..." samples the Joan Jett song "Bad Reputation" as Peaches yells, "I don't give a fuck!" and "I don't give a shit!" during the song.

Promotion
To promote Fatherfucker, Peaches toured as the opening act on Marilyn Manson's 2003 European tour. Peaches also toured as part of the 2004 State of Exit festival in Novi Sad, Serbia. "Operate" is played during the Halloween house party scene in the 2004 film Mean Girls. On May 8, 2005, Peaches performed the song "I U She" in an episode of season two of The L Word, titled "L'Chaim".

Peaches and Maxx Ginnane directed a promotional video for "Tombstone, Baby" that features Ella Ferrante and Billi Lime dancing with knives and cutting each other's clothing. "Tombstone, Baby" was included on the compilation album FM4 Sound Selection 9. "The Inch" was used in the 2007 comedy films Itty Bitty Titty Committee and Young People Fucking, as well as in the 2011 romantic comedy film Getting That Girl.

Singles
"Operate"/"Shake Yer Dix" was released as a limited-edition 12-inch single on September 8, 2003. It peaked at number 112 on the UK Singles Chart.

"Kick It" was released as the album's second single on January 5, 2004. It features Iggy Pop and received positive reviews from the NME. It became Peaches' second top 40 entry in the United Kingdom, peaking at number 39.

"Shake Yer Dix" was remixed by Tiga and re-released as the album's third and final single on May 24, 2004.

Critical reception

Fatherfucker received generally favorable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 70, based on 20 reviews, which indicates "generally favorable reviews". Heather Phares of AllMusic described Fatherfucker as "neither the triumph or the disaster that it could've been." Similarly, Andy Battaglia of The A.V.
