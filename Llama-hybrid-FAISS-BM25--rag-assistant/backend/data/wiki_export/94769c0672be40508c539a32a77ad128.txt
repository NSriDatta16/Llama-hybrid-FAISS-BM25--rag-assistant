It can be seen with the naked eye, having an apparent visual magnitude of 4.49. The approximate distance to this star, , is known from parallax measurements taken during the Hipparcos mission.

The primary component of this system is a massive, B-type main-sequence star with a stellar classification of B9 V. This star has nearly double the radius of the Sun and is spinning rapidly with a projected rotational velocity of 148 km/s. The outer atmosphere has an effective temperature of , giving it the blue-white hue of a B-type star.

There is a close orbiting stellar companion of unknown type, with a third component at an angular separation of 5.7 arcseconds. The latter is a K-type main-sequence star with a visual magnitude of 9.5. This system is among the 100 strongest stellar X-ray sources within  of the Sun. It is emitting an X-ray luminosity of  s−1.
