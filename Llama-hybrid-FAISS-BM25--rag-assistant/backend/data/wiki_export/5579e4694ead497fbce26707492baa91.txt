Waynehead is an animated television series created by actor/comedian Damon Wayans and ran from 1996 to 1997 on Kids' WB, and on YTV from 1996 to 1998. It was a co-production of Warner Bros. Animation and Nelvana, with overseas animation by TMS-Kyokuchi Corporation, Hanho Heung-Up Co., Ltd., and Philippine Animation Studio, Inc.

Waynehead lasted for 13 episodes for one season; Wayans stated that he was told by Warner Bros. that the show wasn't black enough or funny enough, to which a WB executive replied by insisting that the show was merely low-rated. It is about a young boy named Damey Wayne from a poor background with a club foot and was based on Wayans' own childhood in the Chelsea neighborhood in the New York City borough of Manhattan. Actors who provided voices for the show included Gary Coleman, Orlando Brown, and Marlon Wayans.
