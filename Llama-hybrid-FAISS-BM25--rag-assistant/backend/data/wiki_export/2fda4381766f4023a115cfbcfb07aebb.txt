History
The Grove is one of the oldest schools in South Africa and was founded in 1885 as the Feldhausen School, named after Feldhausen Estate, which was a farm prior to the founding of the school. The school is still adjacent to Feldhausen Road.

The premises contain the Sir John Frederick William Herschel obelisk, dedicated to the famous British astronomer who visited  South Africa in 1833 to catalogue the stars of the southern skies, returning to Britain in 1838.

The school celebrated its 125 birthday in 2010. The school celebrates it with musical concerts and a soccer festival, which still runs to date.

Helen Zille, controversial  leader of the DA, started her political career while a parent at the school. She spearheaded a campaign which resulted in the school taking the government to court.
