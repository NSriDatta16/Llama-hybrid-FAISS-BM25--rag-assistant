This is a list of Bundesliga top scorers season by season. Since 1966, a trophy sponsored by the German football magazine Kicker, shaped in the form of a miniature artillery piece, has been awarded to the top scorer at the end of each season. It is formally named the "Kicker-Torjägerkanone" (literally "kicker top scorer cannon"). Robert Lewandowski holds the record for most goals in a single season, with 41 goals scored in the 2020–21 campaign. Lewandowski and Gerd Müller are the record holders for the most awards won, with seven. The latest recipients of the award are Niclas Füllkrug of Werder Bremen and Christopher Nkunku of RB Leipzig.
