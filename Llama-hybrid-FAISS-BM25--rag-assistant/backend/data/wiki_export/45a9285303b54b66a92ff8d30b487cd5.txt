The Sarkhej–Gandhinagar Highway, colloquially the S.G. Road or S.G. Highway, connects the city of Ahmedabad with Gandhinagar, the capital of the state of Gujarat, India. It forms the major part of NH 8C that connects Sarkhej with Chiloda near Gandhinagar. It is a major artery road for commercial and public transport and is witnessing a major construction boom along its route towards Gandhinagar.

History

The highway was primarily built as a mean to bypass the traffic from the city of Ahmedabad. But the lower land prices lead to a boom in the real estate and retail industry. Presently, the prices of land within the vicinity of the highway are more comparable to those in the downtown areas. It has emerged as a hub for educational, entertainment and corporate parks.

In 2015 the National Highways Authority of India transferred the administrative control of the highway to the Government of Gujarat.

Transportation
The highway is dotted with Ahmedabad Municipal Transport Service (AMTS) bus stops which connect the highway with the interior of the city. Also, AMTS has started a feeder air conditioning bus service in association with Airports Authority of India, connecting Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport with the city, having the last stop at Karnavati Club on Sarkhej–Gandhinagar Highway.

By the estimation, a minimum of one lakh PCUs (passenger car units) travels per day on this highway. And, during the festivals and on Mondays and Tuesdays, there is a sharp jump in the volume of traffic.

In the year 2015, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) started earmarking paid parking spots for various categories of vehicles on 4.7 km stretch between Karnavati Club and Hebatpur-Sola on the Highway, where a number of offices and shopping complexes are located.

Landmarks
The highway is dotted with large-scale retail outlets like Lifestyle, Globus, Croma, and Westside. Various automotive dealership showrooms including Porsche, BMW, Audi, Triumph, Jaguar, Land Rover, Range Rover, Nissan, Volvo, Toyota, Rolls-Royce, Harley-Davidson, Honda, Skoda, Jeep, Ducati and Mercedes are located on this road.

Accidents 
The Times of India reports during 22 July 2023 a significant increase in road traffic accidents on SG Road in Ahmedabad, India, according to data from emergency service provider EMRI 108. The 2022–23 period saw an average of eight accidents daily, a 65% rise from the previous year. This surge has led to a doubling of ambulance services in the area. The high accident rate is attributed to SG Road's nature as a city-passing highway with heavy converging traffic and higher average vehicle speeds. Implementing speed calming measures, proper signage, lane demarcation, and adequate lighting are suggested as potential solutions to reduce accidents.

 A fatal incident occurred on Ahmedabad's ISKCON Bridge when a vehicle, driven by Tathya Patel, struck a crowd that had gathered due to a previous collision, resulting in nine deaths. Following the tragic event, Patel was promptly arrested by local authorities.
