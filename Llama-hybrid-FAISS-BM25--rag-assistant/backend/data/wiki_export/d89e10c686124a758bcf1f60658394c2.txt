History

Røra lies between Stiklestad and Mære, and is in an area of rich historical monuments. An early highway, The King's Road (), was at a higher elevation than the current highway.  Along this route there are several minor finds from earlier habitation. On the boundary between Nedre Vådal and Røflo remains have been found from a very old habitation, probably from the Iron Age.  Defense works indicate that the habitation must have been over a long period and been substantial.

The entire landscape has been changed after a major landslide in the 14th century.  Most of the disturbed mass slid into Hylla fjord, but some was diverted to Borgen fjord. The source of the slide is thought to be in the area near the Øvre Vådal farms near the border with Sparbu. Much of the agricultural area lies in the disturbed area.

The coastal settlement at Hylla which had steamship connections was the original centre of the area, but when the railway arrived in 1905 a new centre grew up around the station that took over most of the functions.
