Advanced Placement (AP) Art History (also known as AP Art or APAH) is an Advanced Placement art history course and exam offered by the College Board.

AP Art History is designed to allow students to examine major forms of artistic expression relevant to a variety of cultures evident in a wide variety of periods from the present to the past. Students acquire an ability to examine works of art critically, with intelligence and sensitivity, and to articulate their thoughts and experiences. The course content covers prehistoric, Mediterranean, European, American, Native American, African, Asian, Pacific, and contemporary art and architecture.

Course 
The course is designed to teach the following art historical skills: 
Visual Analysis
Contextual Analysis
Comparisons of Works of Art
Artistic Traditions
Visual Analysis of Unknown Works
Attribution of Unknown Works
Art Historical Interpretations
Argumentation

The course is also built on five core "Big Ideas": 
Culture
Interactions with Other Cultures
Theories and Interpretations
Materials, Processes, and Techniques
Purpose and Audience

Starting in the 2015–2016 school year, College Board has introduced a new curriculum and exam for students to apply art historical skills to questions.

Exam

Score distribution
The multiple-choice section of the exam is worth 50% of a student's score and the free response is worth 50%. Each correctly answered multiple choice question is worth one point. Wrong and omitted questions do not affect the raw score. For the free-response section, the four short essays are each graded on a scale of 0 to 5 and the two long essays are each graded on a scale of 0 to 7.

Works studied 
The current curriculum, which began in 2015, focuses on 250 works of art and architecture across 10 units, beginning with prehistoric art and ending with contemporary art.
