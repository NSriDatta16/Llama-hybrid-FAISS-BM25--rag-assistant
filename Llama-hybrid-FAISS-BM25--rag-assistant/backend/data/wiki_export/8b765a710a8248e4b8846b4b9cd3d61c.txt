The Association of Conservative Clubs is an organisation associated with the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom.  It represents and provides support to the largest association of political clubs in the country estimated at 1,100.

The Association of Conservative Clubs was formed in 1894. Its objects are to assist and encourage the formation of clubs and to support the principles of Conservatism and aims of the Conservative Party. From 1895 to 1941, the association published The Clubman. It was succeeded by Conservative Clubs' Gazette and Conservative Clubs' Magazine.

Such clubs can vary from Conservative working men's clubs to more prestigious clubs known as constitutional clubs. Significantly, constitutional clubs are under no obligation to contribute to Conservative Party funds. Reflecting the dual origins of the modern Conservative and Unionist Party, some affiliates are called unionist clubs. They may also be known as Beaconsfield clubs (after Benjamin Disraeli), Salisbury clubs or any combination of these titles. These affiliates can offer a wide range of facilities, including snooker, bar games and entertainment.

The vast majority of Conservative clubs offer full membership to both men and women.
