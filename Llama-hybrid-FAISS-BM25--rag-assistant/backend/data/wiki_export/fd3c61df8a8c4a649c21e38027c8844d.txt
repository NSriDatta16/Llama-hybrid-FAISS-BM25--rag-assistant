Work in academia

She has taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Johnson State College, and Tufts University.

Ochs worked as an administrator at Harvard University from 1983 until she retired in 2009.

Work as a bisexual activist

Ochs helped found the Boston Bisexual Network in 1983, and the Bisexual Resource Center in 1985. In 1987, The East Coast Bisexual Network established the first Bisexual History Archives with Ochs' initial collection; archivist Clare Morton hosted researchers. The group became the Bisexual Resource Center in 1993.

In 2002 she delivered the first bi-focused keynote during the National Association of Lesbian and Gay Addiction Professionals. In 2004 and in 2007, she keynoted the Midwest Gay Lesbian Bisexual Transgender Campus Conference, the largest gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender student conference in the United States.

Ochs has served on the Board of Directors of MassEquality, Massachusetts's statewide equality organization, from 2004-2016.

She has written frequently on bisexuality and LGBT rights and her writings have been published in numerous bisexual, women's studies, multicultural and LGBT anthologies.

Awards and recognitions

In 1997, she received the Reinaldo dos Santos Memorial Award for Bisexual Activism.

In 2009 at the Creating Change Conference, the National Gay & Lesbian Task Force awarded Ochs the Susan J. Hyde Activism Award for Longevity in the Movement.  As she presented the award Creating Change Director Sue Hyde told Ochs: "We hear your clear voice, we see your staunch advocacy and we respond to your loving insistence that our movement includes all of us."

Also in 2009, Ochs received the Harvard Gay & Lesbian Caucus's Lifetime Achievement Award for advocacy on the Harvard University Campus.
 
Ochs received the 2011 Brenda Howard Award at the Queens NYC PFLAG chapter's annual awards luncheon on February 5, 2012.

Personal life

On May 17, 2004, the first day it was legal for same-sex couples to marry in Massachusetts
, Ochs and her long-time partner Peg Preble (a self-identified lesbian), were among the first same-sex couples to legally marry. When early news reports spoke of the marriage as a "lesbian wedding", Ochs objected strongly to being classified as a lesbian rather than a bisexual. In follow-up news coverage, Ochs publicly denounced this as an example of exactly the type of bisexual erasure she has been calling attention to for much of her life.

She is the daughter of music producer and radio host Sonny Ochs and niece of folk singer Phil Ochs.
