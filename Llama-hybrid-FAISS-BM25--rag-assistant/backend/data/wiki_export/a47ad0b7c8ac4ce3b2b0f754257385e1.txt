Phish: Live in Vegas (2000) is a video of a complete live performance by the rock band Phish recorded at the Thomas & Mack Center on September 30, 2000, bandleader Trey Anastasio's 36th birthday. It includes many rarities and songs that were brought out of "retirement" after long periods of inactivity.

The performance was originally a live Internet webcast that came just days after Phish officially announced an indefinite break from recording and touring. Anastasio used the narration segment that bridges "Colonel Forbin's Ascent" and "Fly Famous Mockingbird" to officially announce the hiatus to audiences across the globe via the Internet.

Also included are tracks from the following night's performance in Phoenix, Arizona. 

This was the first uncut concert DVD released by Phish, the second being Phish: Live in Brooklyn, released on July 11, 2006.
