"Cowboys & Kisses" is a song by American singer Anastacia from her debut studio album Not That Kind (2000). Written by Anastacia, JIVE, and Charlie Pennachio, the song was released as the album's third single on January 22, 2001, by Daylight Records and Epic Records.

Critical reception
Tricia Beoy of MTVAsia.com called this song "a simple, anthem-ic, country-flavoured soft rock tune that doesn't work with Anastacia's voice."

Music video
The music video for "Cowboys & Kisses" was filmed on January 8–9, 2001, at the Camarillo Airport in Camarillo, California. It is Anastacia's second video to be directed by Nigel Dick, who also director her debut song "I'm Outta Love". In the video, Anastacia is shown driving to an airplane hangar, while a strange unknown man, who is wearing the same ring as Anastacia, is watching her (on the TV screen). At the airport, she is lip-synching the song together with her background singers. While Anastacia is dressed like a cowgirl, the background singers play operators. The unknown man looks at Anastacia and browses through some files about her. At the end, Anastacia sings on an airplane, whereafter the stranger turns off his TV and Anastacia drives away.
