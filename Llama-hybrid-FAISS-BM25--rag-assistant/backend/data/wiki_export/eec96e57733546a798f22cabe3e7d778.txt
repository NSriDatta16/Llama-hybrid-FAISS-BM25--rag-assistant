Brett Milton Wetterich (born August 9, 1973) is an American professional golfer.

Wetterich was born in Cincinnati, Ohio. He attended Oak Hills High School and Wallace State Community College. He turned professional in 1994.

Wetterich was a PGA Tour rookie in 2000, but injury truncated his season and he spent the next few seasons playing mainly on the Nationwide Tour, where he won in 2003 and 2004. He returned to the PGA Tour in 2005 and in 2006, and he won the EDS Byron Nelson Championship. This win helped him secure a place in the 2006 U.S. Ryder Cup team by finishing tenth on the points list. He became the first (and as of 2018, the only) player to go from Q-School to making the Ryder Cup team in the following year. He also finished tenth on the 2006 year-end PGA Tour money list with earnings of $3,023,185.

Wetterich led the 2007 Masters Tournament at the mid-way point, but collapsed on Saturday, shooting an 83, the highest score posted by any weekend leader in the storied tournament's history. He finished the tournament T37.

Shoulder injuries cut Wetterich's 2008 season short, kept him off the course in 2009, and cost him significant Tour status in 2010 after he failed to satisfy his medical exemption. He finished 156th on the money list and was demoted to the Past Champions category, among the lowest priority rankings on Tour. He won his third event on the Nationwide Tour in 2011, but finished 29th on the money list, four places short of a PGA Tour card. Wetterich has not played a full PGA Tour season since 2010.

Wetterich has been featured in the top 25 of the Official World Golf Ranking, reaching a career high of 21st in 2007.
