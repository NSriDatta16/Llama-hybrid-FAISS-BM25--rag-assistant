Emergenza is an annual music festival for unsigned bands. Its concerts have been held in more than 150 cities around the world.

Annually, a series of global elimination rounds takes place in various countries. Advancing bands are selected based on audience reception of their performances, with the ultimate winners determined by Emergenza judges during regional and final concerts.

History
The Emergenza Festival had its origins in 1992 when a group of musician friends organized its inaugural event in Rome, Italy, with an initial audience of 245 attendees. Over the course of five months, attendance grew significantly, reaching three thousand. During the same year, the festival released its first compilation album.

From 1993 to 2003, Emergenza produced a total of 54 albums, including both live and studio recordings. In 1995, the official Emergenza logo was introduced.

The festival expanded beyond Italy on January 7, 1996, with its first concert held at the Gibus Club in Paris, France, attracting 113 participating bands. The following year marked the debut of the Emergenza European Final at the London Astoria in the United Kingdom, drawing an audience of 2,500.

In 2001, the festival crossed the Atlantic Ocean and landed in Montreal, Canada. By 2002, Emergenza had expanded to five cities, and in 2003, it featured over 700 bands across 190 events during its first U.S. season. The following year, 2,876 musicians participated in the United States, and an impressive sixteen thousand performed for audiences in Europe and Canada. By 2005, the festival had reached seventy North American cities.

Emergenza continued to grow, extending its reach to Japan and Australia in 2006, with shows in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, and Tokyo. Later, Perth in Western Australia and Brisbane were included in Australia's roster. From 2008 to 2010, the festival expanded its presence to the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Russia, and New Zealand.
