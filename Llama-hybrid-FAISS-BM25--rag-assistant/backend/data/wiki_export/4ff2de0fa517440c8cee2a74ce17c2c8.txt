Dead Like Me is an American comedy-drama television series created by Bryan Fuller that premiered on June 27, 2003, on Showtime in the United States and ended on October 31, 2004. The show spans two seasons, with a total of 29 episodes. The original pilot is 74 minutes long, while the episodes that follow are 40 to 50 minutes. Showtime canceled the series due to declining ratings in the second season, even though originally they claimed the show had three times higher ratings than the network's primetime average. Various actors also mentioned that the show had backstage problems, which was one of the reasons the creator left the series during the first season.

Both seasons of Dead Like Me were released on DVD in United States and United Kingdom in 2004 and 2005, respectively. A direct-to-DVD film titled Dead Like Me: Life After Death was released on February 17, 2009. The episodes were filmed primarily in Vancouver, British Columbia.
