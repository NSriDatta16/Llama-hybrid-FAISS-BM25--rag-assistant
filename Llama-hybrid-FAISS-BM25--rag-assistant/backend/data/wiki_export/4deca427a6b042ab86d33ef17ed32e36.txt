History

Initially, the village was called Beek. The Prinsenhoeve (princes' farm) at Beek was built in the 14th century, and that is the first mention of this village. Beek became a parish in 1796. On 1 July 1866 the train station Prinsenbeek was opened.

The municipality Beek was founded in 1942, during World War II, when the town Princenhage was added to the town Breda. The village, with a church, became a separate municipality. In 1951 the name was changed into Prinsenbeek, because there were several more towns called Beek, one in Limburg and one in Gelderland. By royal decree Prinsenbeek was given a town arms on 12 January 1951 and on 11 October 1963 the town council decided to have a town flag. On 1 July 1976 the area east of the railway was added to Breda to construct the district of Haagse Beemden. Finally at the municipal redivision on 1 January 1997 Prinsenbeek was added to Breda.
