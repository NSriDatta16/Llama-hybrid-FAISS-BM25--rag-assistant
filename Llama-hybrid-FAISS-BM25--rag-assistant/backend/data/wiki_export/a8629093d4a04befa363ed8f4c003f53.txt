The Markham Waxers were an Ontario Junior Hockey League (OJHL) Junior "A" ice hockey team based in Markham, Ontario, Canada.  The Waxers name is still used by the Markham Waxers minor hockey club with the Eastern AAA Hockey League, a sub league of the Ontario Minor Hockey Association.

History
Originally known as the Markham Jets, the Waxers organization changed names in 1961, named after The International Group, a privately owned wax and oil refinery that originated in Agincourt, ON.  The team won the 1941 Ontario Junior "C" Championship and won the Ontario Junior "B" Sutherland Cup Championship in 1969 and 1972.  At one point, the Waxers were the farm team of the National Hockey League's Toronto Maple Leafs and boasts over 100 NHL and World Hockey Association graduates.  The Waxers were formerly a part of the Metro Junior A Hockey League before joining the Ontario Provincial Junior A Hockey League.

During the 2002 Season the Waxers celebrated 100 years of association with the OHA. They had special 3rd jerseys made up and all players were numbered from 100–198, by adding a 1 to the front of the player's regular number. One of these jerseys was donated to the Hockey Hall of Fame, as they believe only one other team in history has ever used such numbering for its players. They finished that season by winning the South Division championship the franchise's first Championship in many years.

On August 1, 2012, the Waxers announced they were suspending operations for the 2012–13 season.

On June 15, 2013, the Ontario Junior Hockey League announced that the Markham Waxers had their membership terminated. The Waxers failed to fulfill several obligations required by the league and the governing Ontario Hockey Association.  The OJHL mentioned that Markham has a rich tradition in junior hockey and would like to see a team back in Markham for the 2014–15.

On April 29. 2015, the City of Markham held a major Press conference and the Mayor announced, to a large jubilant crowd, that the Hamilton Red Wings Jr A Hockey Club was relocating to Markham. The Hockey Club acquired the rights to the Waxers Junior A, and has opted to play in the OJHL as the Markham Royals. The Royals were the sister club of the Waxers dating back to the 1970s.

The OJHL's Markham Royals will begin league play in the 2015–16 season reviving the rich tradition of Junior hockey in the City of Markham.
