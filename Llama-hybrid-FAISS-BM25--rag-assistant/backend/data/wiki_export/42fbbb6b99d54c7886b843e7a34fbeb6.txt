Littlethorpe is a small village approximately  south of Leicester, separated from the village of Narborough by the Leicester to Birmingham railway line, and the River Soar of which it is the true discharge.

The village has expanded since the Second World War most noticeably through the creation of two housing estates, the Jelson estate and Barratt estate. Housing continues to be built, Parnell Close being completed during 2005.

Services
The village has two pubs, the Plough Inn and the Old Inn.

Other services include a garden centre, funeral directors and a beauty salon.

Narborough railway station is situated close to Littlethorpe, on the edge of Narborough, and services run between Leicester and Birmingham.

Littlethorpe Community Association
The Littlethorpe Community Association meets in the skittle alley of one of the pubs. The Association organises the annual gala on Littlethorpe Park and Thorpe meadows, as well as holding monthly coffee mornings at the village hall and operating the Santa Run each Christmas. More recently the association has organised Easter Egg Hunts and a Christmas decoration morning at the village hall.

The village has no church of its own, but is part of the parish of Narborough, along with Huncote. Previously Littlethorpe was part of Cosby parish.
