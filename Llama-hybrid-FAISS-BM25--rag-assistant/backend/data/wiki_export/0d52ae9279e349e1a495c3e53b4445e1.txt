Live Phish Vol. 11 was recorded live at the McNichols Sports Arena in Denver, Colorado on November 17, 1997.

The 1997 fall tour will always be remembered by fans as the funky era of Phish, during which the band de-emphasized their often technical approach in favor of more ambient, groove-based jams and extended space improvisations. Some of this was predicated on their transition from a club band, then to medium theaters, and finally to arena rock which required a change in the band's approach and overall sound.  This show from Denver was instantly a band and fan favorite, and Phish had plans to release the show as an album long before the Live Phish Series was conceived.

The concert is considered to be one of the best of Phish's career by the band's fans. On the website Phish.net, the largest Phish fan community on the internet, the show is rated the band's seventh best out of the nearly 1500 concerts they have played since 1983.

Bonus tracks include two songs from the concert at Assembly Hall in Champaign, Illinois on November 19, 1997, featuring a 28-minute version of "Wolfman's Brother".
