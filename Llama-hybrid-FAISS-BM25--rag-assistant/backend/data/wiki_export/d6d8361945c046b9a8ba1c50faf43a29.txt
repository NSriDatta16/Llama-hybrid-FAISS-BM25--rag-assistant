Azure Ray is the debut and eponymous studio album by American duo Azure Ray, consisting of Maria Taylor and Orenda Fink. It was originally released on January 16, 2001 by Warm Electronic Recordings.

Background 
After their previous band disbanded, Taylor and Fink moved to Athens, Georgia where they formed Azure Ray. They signed to WARM and recorded the self-titled record with Eric Bachmann (Crooked Fingers and Archers of Loaf). Pitchfork praised the duo's debut, giving it a 7 out of 10, calling their debut "maudlin but beautiful, expertly crafted pop songs." The song "Sleep" was later featured in the 2006 Academy Award-nominated movie, The Devil Wears Prada featuring Anne Hathaway. DJ Paul Kalkbrenner sampled "Rise" in his 2008 hit song "Azure." In 2015, Taylor Swift included "Sleep" in a 6-song "breakup playlist" made for a fan via her official Tumblr. In 2018, it was re-released on Taylor's label, Flower Moon Records.
