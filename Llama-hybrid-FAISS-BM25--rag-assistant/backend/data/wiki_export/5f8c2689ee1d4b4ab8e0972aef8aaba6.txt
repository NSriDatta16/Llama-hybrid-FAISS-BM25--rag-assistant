The Champions Cup, formerly called European Cup, is an annual baseball tournament, sanctioned and created by the Confederation of European Baseball (CEB). The tournament features the top teams of the professional baseball leagues in Europe, and is the first tier of the four competitions organized by WBSC Europe, alongside the second-tier Confederation Cup, third-tier Federation Cup, and fourth-tier Federation Cup Qualifiers, all of which operate with a promotion and relegation system for its federations. 

Starting in 2008, the tournament is now held in two locations. The best two teams from each tournament then compete in the European Champion Cup "Final Four", with the winner receiving the European Champion Cup.

Between 2013 and 2015, the "Final Four" format was replaced with a best-of-three series between the winners of each tournament. In the 2015 tournament, six teams competed in the Paris group, while six other teams competed in Rotterdam. The best two teams then competed in the "Final Four" in Italy, in a best-of-three series, for the championship.

The first season of the tournament was held in  and was won by the Picadero Jockey Club Barcelona.
