"From Out of Nowhere" is the first track on Faith No More's third studio album, The Real Thing (1989). It was also the first single to be released from it and to feature Mike Patton on vocals. It was first released in the United Kingdom on October 30, 1989, but did not appear on the UK Singles Chart. It was re-released on April 2, 1990, after the success of "Epic", and it reached number 23 on the UK chart.

Music video
There are two very different versions of this video. The first version features Mike Patton in camouflage shorts, a black undershirt, and sunglasses. Words come across the screen a few times during the video, and there are a few shots of exteriors at the beginning and end. In the second version, Patton is wearing spandex shorts and a black and blue coat. Billy Gould is using a different bass, and there are many more exterior shots, as well as more words going across the screen. Only a few shots are kept from the first version, being some of the shots of Mike Bordin. This latter version was used on the video releases. The band has said of the video that "[They] didn't know what [they] were doing".
