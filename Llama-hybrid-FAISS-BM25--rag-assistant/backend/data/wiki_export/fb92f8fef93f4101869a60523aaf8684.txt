Kirkby-in-Ashfield railway station serves the town of Kirkby-in-Ashfield in Nottinghamshire, England. The station is on the Robin Hood Line and is operated by East Midlands Railway between Nottingham and Worksop.

History

Kirkby-in-Ashfield was served by three railway stations:
Kirkby-in-Ashfield Central station (closed 1962) was located 700m to the west of the present station on the former Great Central Railway Mansfield Central branch.
Kirkby-in-Ashfield East station (closed 1964) was 350m to the east of the present station on the former Midland Railway Nottingham to Worksop line.
Kirkby Bentinck station (closed 1963) was located in Bentinck Town to the south west of Kirkby-in-Ashfield, on the former Great Central Railway London to Manchester main line.

The closures of these lines left the area with no passenger rail services until the reopening of the former Midland Railway route, now known as the 'Robin Hood Line', in the 1990s.  However, by this time British Rail had abandoned the original Midland alignment through Kirkby-in-Ashfield town centre, and the remaining freight trains instead passed through the town by way of a short remnant of yet another line.
The town's new station is therefore located on part of the former Great Northern Railway Nottingham to Shirebrook line, which had not previously had a station at this location.
