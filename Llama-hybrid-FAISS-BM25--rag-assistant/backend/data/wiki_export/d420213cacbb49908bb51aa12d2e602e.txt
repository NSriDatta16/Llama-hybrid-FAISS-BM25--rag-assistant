Present day

Choirs 
The school has seen success with its choirs, its Chamber Choir winning the BBC Ulster School Choir Of The Year Competition in 2016.

Debating

In 2010/2011, the Society entered the UK Wide Debating Matters Championship. A team of six debaters won the Derry Qualifying Heat to make it through the Northern Ireland and Scotland final in Edinburgh, where they triumphed over schools from across the two countries. This allowed them to then qualify for the National Final held at the Royal Society of Medicine where they were defeated in a debate on the Banning of the Burqa.

Bar Mock
Dalriada also competes in the annual Bar Mock Trial Competition. The team prepares mock legal cases for the regional finals each year in the Royal Courts of Justice in Belfast, winning this competition three times. After winning the National Championships in London in 2016 for the first time, Dalriada pupils went on to compete in the Empire Mock Trial World Championships in New York for the third time. At this event Dalriada had the experience of litigating in a different jurisdiction, and a student received an award for Outstanding Witness.

Sporting Success
Dalriada competes in many sports. Its most recent achievement is winning the All-Ireland Volleyball Title for a record 8th time. The Volleyball Programme for Girls is amongst the highest ranking in Ireland.
