The fourth season of America's Next Top Model aired in spring 2005, with the shooting location being moved from New York City to Los Angeles. The catchphrase of the season was "Dive In."

These were the last appearances of Janice Dickinson and Nolé Marin as judges and the Beauty Tip of the Week was replaced by the My Life as a CoverGirl segment. The house that the girls stayed in the first half of the competition was later used in The CW TV series (successor to UPN with the WB) The Pussycat Dolls Present: Girlicious and the  Oxygen TV series Pretty Wicked.

The international destination for the cycle was Cape Town, South Africa, the show's first visit to Africa and only visit to Southern Africa. 

The winner was 20-year-old Naima Mora from Detroit, Michigan with Kahlen Rondot placing as the runner up.

The prizes for this cycle were a modeling contract with Ford Models, a fashion spread and cover in Elle magazine, and a 100,000 contract with CoverGirl cosmetics.
