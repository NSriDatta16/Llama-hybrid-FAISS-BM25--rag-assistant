Kudelstaart is a town in the Dutch province of North Holland. It is a part of the municipality of Aalsmeer, and lies about 10Â km southeast of Hoofddorp.

The village was first mentioned in 1237 as Sconedorpe. The current name is a combination of "fish net" and "long, thin piece of land". Kudelstaart developed around 1200 as a peat excavation settlement. In the 13th century, it was split between Holland and Utrecht. In 1724, the heerlijkheid was bought by the city of Amsterdam.
