Vadim Valentinovich Yevseyev (; born 8 January 1976) is a Russian football coach and a former Russian international player. He is the manager of Kuban Krasnodar.

Playing career

Club
Yevseyev started to play for the Dynamo football school. In 1990, after having been left out of the international tournament in France, he moved to the Lokomotiv school. After two years at Spartak Mytishchi, in 1993 he was invited to play for the reserve team of Spartak Moscow.

He debuted for the Spartak's first team on 6 March 1996, in the Champions League quarterfinal against Nantes. In 1998 Yevseyev spent the second half of the season on loan in Torpedo Moscow.

Yevseyev played in Lokomotiv Moscow since 2000. He was then dropped to the reserve team in 2006 after having an argument with the new manager Anatoly Byshovets. By the start of the 2007 Russian Premier League he was in newly relegated to the First Division Torpedo Moscow, but failed to accommodate and was subsequently sold to Saturn Moscow Oblast in the summer of 2007.

In his farewell friendly match he was substituted for the 5-year-old son of a children's charity director, who went on to score.

International
Yevseyev debuted in the national team on 31 March 1999 in a match against Andorra. His only goal for Russia was scored on 19 November 2003 in a Euro 2004 qualification playoff against Wales at the Millennium Stadium. This goal was the only one in a two-leg tie. Yevseyev's post-match reaction (namely, shouting Russian profanities into the camera) has been subject of much media attention.

Coaching career
On 27 March 2019, he signed a 2-year contract as a manager of Russian Premier League FC Ufa. On 7 October 2020, he left Ufa by mutual consent.

On 1 June 2021 he signed with Shinnik Yaroslavl, freshly relegated to the third-tier FNL 2. On 16 May 2022, Shinnik secured their promotion back to Russian Football National League after one season down.

On 1 May 2023, five rounds before the end of the 2022–23 Russian Premier League season, Yevseyev was appointed as the manager of Fakel Voronezh, hoping to secure the club from relegation. Fakel avoided relegation by defeating Yenisey Krasnoyarsk in the relegation play-offs. Yevseyev was dismissed by Fakel on 5 September 2023, following weak start to the 2023–24 season.

On 12 September 2023, Yevseyev was hired by Russian First League club Kuban Krasnodar.
