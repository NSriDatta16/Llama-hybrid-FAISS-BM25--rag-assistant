, born on September 20, 1965, in Tokyo, Japan,  is a Japanese manga artist, who is well known for his manga Jiraishin. As of March 2006, he is currently married and has one child. His alias is Ichigo Nekota.

History
He began his involvement in the manga work with the creation of Jiraishin, published and serialized in Afternoon magazine and published in Kodansha, which made him a popular icon in Japan from 1992 to 1999. In late 1999, he published a single manga volume called ALIVE, published by Shueisha. Shortly afterwards, he published Tetsuwan Girl, which is also carried by Kodansha as well.

Takahashi was a guest lecturer at Ritsumeikan University back in 1998, giving a talk on "Expression". Many of the students and teachers have said that he is well liked and popular due to his sense of humor and his looks. His former assistant was Tsutomu Nihei, who went to create the manga BLAME!. Takahashi's travels to the United States, New York City in particular, enabled him to create scenes in Jiraishin that had English conversations. His travels also influenced him to make Kyoya, Eriko and other Jiraishin characters speak fluent English.

Takahashi provided the cover art for Galneryus' 2017 album Ultimate Sacrifice.
