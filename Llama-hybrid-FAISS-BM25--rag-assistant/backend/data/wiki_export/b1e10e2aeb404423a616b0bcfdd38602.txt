History
WOKQ was put on the air in August 1970 by Eastminster Broadcasting Company under the call letters WDNH.  Its country format was in place by 1972.  Eastminster sold WDNH to Fuller-Jeffrey Broadcasting in 1977, at which point it became WOKQ. Fuller-Jeffrey was sold to Citadel Broadcasting in 1999. Citadel merged with Cumulus Media on September 16, 2011.

On August 30, 2013, a deal was announced in which Townsquare Media would acquire 53 Cumulus stations, including WOKQ and WPKQ, for $238 million. The deal was part of Cumulus' acquisition of Dial Global; Townsquare and Dial Global are both controlled by Oaktree Capital Management. The sale to Townsquare was completed on November 14, 2013.
