Dah Shinin' is the debut studio album by American East Coast hip hop duo Smif-N-Wessun. It was released on January 10, 1995, via Wreck/Nervous Records. Recording sessions took place at D&D Studios in New York City. Production was handled by Da Beatminerz. It features a guest appearance from the Boot Camp Clik. The album peaked at number 59 on the Billboard 200. The production is the signature Beatminerz sound which is elevated from their work on Black Moon’s 1993 effort ‘Enta da Stage’. The album spawned 4 singles: Bucktown/Let’s Git It On, Wrekonize/Sound Bwoy Burriel, Wrekonize (Remix)/Sound Bwoy Burriel (edit) and Wontime. A track known as ‘Nothin’ Move but The Money’ was left of the release of the album due to sample clearance issues and was released on white label as a result.

Background 
Members Tek and Steele made their debut previously on Black Moon's classic 1993 album Enta da Stage. Dah Shinin''' was noted for its hardcore lyrical content and production, which was provided by Da Beatminerz members DJ Evil Dee, Mr. Walt, Rich Blak and Baby Paul.

The album marked the arrival of hip hop supergroup, the Boot Camp Clik, a prominent rap crew of the 1990s. The group includes Black Moon member Buckshot, Heltah Skeltah and Originoo Gunn Clappaz, as well as Tek and Steele. All members make an appearance on the posse cut "Cession at da Doghillee".

The album has gone on to sell over 300,000 copies in the United States, and includes the underground single "Bucktown". In 1998, the album was selected as one of The Source's 100 Best Rap Albums.

The album's cover draws its inspiration from Roy Ayers Ubiquity's 1972 album He's Coming''.
