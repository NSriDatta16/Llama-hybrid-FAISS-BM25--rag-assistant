The Robert Sangster Stakes, is a South Australian Jockey Club Group 1 Thoroughbred Weight for Age horse race for fillies and mares two (2) years old and upwards, over a distance of 1200 metres at the Morphettville Racecourse Adelaide, Australia in the Autumn Carnival. Prize money is A$502,250

History
The race was held in February prior to 2006. After rescheduling of the Adelaide Cup Carnival the SAJC moved the race to the autumn.

In 2005 the race was renamed the Robert Sangster Stakes after prolific owner and breeder Robert Sangster who died in 2004.

Robert Sangster was the principal of Swettenham Stud and the renaming recognises his contribution to the Australian thoroughbred industry.
