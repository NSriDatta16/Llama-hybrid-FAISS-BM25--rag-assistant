United Animal Nations is an animal rights organization founded in 1979, in Geneva, by the Franz Weber Foundation, based in Switzerland.

History 

United Animal Nations was founded by Franz Weber on 8 November 1979 in Geneva, Switzerland.

Purpose  
The purpose of the UAN is to obtain legal status for animal populations as well as to enhance the impact and political weight of the UAN member organizations. The forum was initiated by the Swiss environmentalist and animal activist Franz Weber. The charter and declaration was deliberately designed to mirror that of the United Nations. The members are established organizations and institutions, whose aims are the protection of animal life and the preservation of nature. Weber complemented the structure of the UN by adding a protection committee and the International Court of Animal Rights to the UAN. The Statutes, Charter and Declaration were put together with Swiss philosopher and author Denis de Rougemont from Ferney-Voltaire, and a lawyer from Zürich, Anton Flachsmann. On 8 November 1979, Franz Weber presented them to the international press.

Court 
The UAN's most important organ, The International Court of Justice for Animal Rights has its seat in Geneva. Its duties are to bring to the notice of the public, by means of morally symbolic prosecutions, cruel human actions against the animal kingdom that cannot be legally dealt with under normal human rights legislature.  The court publicly announces its verdict, if need be by naming ministers and government leaders. The court has a president, two presidential assistants, and six to twelve further members representing the partaking animal protection associations. Only established bodies can act as plaintiffs. Since its foundation in 1979 the court has proceeded in more than 25 international cases.
