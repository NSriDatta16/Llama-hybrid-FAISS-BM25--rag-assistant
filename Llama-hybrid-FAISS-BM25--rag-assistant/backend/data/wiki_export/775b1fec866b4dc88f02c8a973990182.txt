San Luis Peak is the highest summit of the La Garita Mountains range in the Rocky Mountains of North America.  The prominent  fourteener is located in the Gunnison National Forest portion of the La Garita Wilderness in Saguache County approximately  north of Creede. It is situated rather far to the east of the other fourteeners in the San Juans, and has more of a wilderness setting than many of the others.

San Luis Peak is a relatively straightforward climb, with two hiking routes to the summit. The Northeast Ridge route begins at the Stewart Creek Trailhead and is  round trip. The South Ridge route begins at the West Willow Creek Trailhead north of Creede. This route is almost entirely above treeline and is  round trip.
