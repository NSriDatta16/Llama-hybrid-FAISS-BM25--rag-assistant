The 1985–86 UEFA Cup was the 15th season of the UEFA Cup, an annual club football tournament organised by UEFA. It was won by Real Madrid, who beat 1. FC Köln 5–3 on aggregate in the final. It was the first season in which English clubs were serving an indefinite ban from European football competitions, which meant two-time UEFA Cup winners Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur, as well as Southampton and Norwich City were unable to compete.

Slot Allocation
Following UEFA ranking changes and the English ban, Italy, Portugal, Soviet Union and Netherlands gained a third berth. Greece took a place from Denmark.

For the 1985–86 UEFA Cup, the associations are allocated places according to their 1984 UEFA country coefficients, which takes into account their performance in European competitions from 1979–80 to 1983–84.
