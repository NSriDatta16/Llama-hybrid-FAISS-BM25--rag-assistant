Guilderland High School is a public senior high school, located in Guilderland Center, New York.  It is part of the Guilderland Central School District.  Constructed in 1953, the high school has since undergone additions in 1955, 1960, 1997, 2010, and 2021.  Originally, the building functioned as a Junior-Senior High School, but after the construction of Farnsworth Middle School in 1970, the district divided the schools into two. As a school, Guilderland High School's enrollment jurisdiction also includes the village of Altamont, NY and the North Bethlehem neighborhood of Bethlehem, NY.

Currently, the school runs on block scheduling.

Course levels 

Guilderland High School boasts a variety of different course levels and types to accommodate the different needs of students.  Types include Advanced Placement, SUPA (Syracuse University Project Advance), Honors, Regents, Core, Focus, Vo-Tech, ESL, as well as various additional college programs. This school also is included in the Project Lead The Way course (PLTW) along with other schools in the United States.

Courses in advanced study 

Guilderland High School offers numerous opportunities for students to take Advanced Placement examinations, as well as place a year ahead in various courses.  Advanced course standing may first be attained when a student is in eighth grade.

Accelerated foreign language study is available for students in French and Spanish during a student's freshman year.  The "2A" course selection allows for two years of study condensed into one year.  Therefore, a student is able to progress from "French 2A" directly to "French 4." Effectively the acceleration allows for a one-year advancement in foreign language study.

Additionally, Guilderland High School offers numerous Advanced Placement courses to its students. Decision to enroll in AP courses is at the discretion of the student and his or her guidance counselor, though teacher recommendations may also be influential.  At present, AP courses available to GHS students include European History, American History, English Language, English Literature, Calculus AB, Calculus BC, Chemistry, Music Theory, Studio Art, US Government and Politics, Physics, and Computer Science, but students have been known to take the Microeconomics, Macroeconomics, Biology, Statistics, Psychology, and Human Geography exams after self-preparation and/or preparation in non-AP classes.

The Guilderland Players 

Guilderland High School is also known for its theatre program.  The group, called the Guilderland Players, was organized in the 1968-69 school year by English teacher Bob Scrafford, but did not put on their first performance, Bye Bye Birdie, until the next year. Musicals were directed for many years by the inimitable Fred Heitkamp. Producing two shows each year, a drama in the fall and a musical in the spring, the Guilderland Players, known as 'GP' by its members, is one of the largest extracurricular activities at Guilderland High School, including more than one hundred students in its cast, stage crew, and pit. It is staffed by John Fatuzzo (Pit Conductor), Claudia Golub (music director), and Andy Maycock (director). The Guilderland Players' 2006 production of Steel Pier won the SLOC Award for 'Best Choreography.' Various alumni of the Guilderland Players have also gone on to other acting opportunities, including appearing on the TV show American Dreams, the Original Broadway Cast of La Boh√®me, and in the cast of multiple seasons of Park Playhouse.
Lyle E Warner, English teacher, also directed plays 1971-1973, one I remember was Lost Horizons.

GreatSchools.org rating 

In 2009, GHS earned a 6 out of 10 rating according to metrics measured by the website GreatSchools.org.  Though the school continues to achieve parity in state testing scores relative to other high schools across the state of NY, only 50% of the students passed the Mathematics A examination in 2009, which led to the school's diminished rating.

In 2018, GHS earned an 8 out of 10 rating according to metrics measured by the website GreatSchools.org. The school is above average in academics receiving a 10/10 in college readiness. Where the school loses points is its equity overview.
