The Sturgeon River is a  river in central Alberta. It is a major tributary of the North Saskatchewan River. The river crosses Sturgeon County, which was named for this river. For much of its length, the Sturgeon is the northwestern-most major river in the Hudson Bay drainage basin, as the river runs close to and parallel to the Arctic Divide.

At the Villeneuve station, Sturgeon River has a discharge of 0.4 to 3 m3/s.

Fish species which may be found in the river include:  walleye, pike, perch, burbot, goldeye, sturgeon, whitefish, and sauger.
