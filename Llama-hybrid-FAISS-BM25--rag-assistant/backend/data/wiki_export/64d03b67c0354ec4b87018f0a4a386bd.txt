ART.Welten is an Austrian association for independent artists.  It was founded in 2005 by Monja Art, an Austrian film-maker and author, with the stated goal of being a place for artists to meet connected only by the "love of art".

ART.Welten focuses on the spreading of non-mainstream art, especially that which is of queer-interest or opposes to discrimination due to race, religion, sexual orientation, or disability.
