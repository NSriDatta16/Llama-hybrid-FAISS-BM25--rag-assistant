Brush High School opened in 1927, providing students in South Euclid and Lyndhurst with a centralized high school.

In 1961, Korb Field became the brightest nighttime football field in the country as General Electric engineers from Nela Park installed experimental mercury floodlights.
In 1962 the B wing and John C. Welser Gymnasium were added, giving the school a new library and gym.
In 1974 the C wing, which houses mostly the art and business departments, and the D wing, housing a new cafeteria and the science and math departments were added.
