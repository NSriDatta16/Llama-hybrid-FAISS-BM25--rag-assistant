Yao Séyram Junior Sènaya (born April 19, 1984, in Lomé) is a Togolese former football player who played as a striker or a midfielder. He is the younger brother of Yao Mawuko Sènaya.

Football career
Sènaya spent his entire professional career in Switzerland, playing for many teams, including FC Basel.

He was released by FC La Chaux-de-Fonds in summer 2008.

International
He is a key part of the Togo national team, having played in both the 2006 African Cup of Nations and the 2006 World Cup in Germany, where he appeared in all three games in which Togo competed.

Yao Junior Sènaya is easily identified on the field due to his more "exotic" haircuts. He wore bleach blonde hair to the African Nations Cup in 2006.

He is a well-liked personality among Togo fans. Because of his popularity, former Togo coach Tchalile Bana was obliged to seek police protection after Sènaya was substituted during a 2002 World Cup qualifier against rival Angola.
