Joyce Irene Ackroyd,   (23 November 1918 – 30 August 1991) was an Australian academic, translator, author and editor. She was a scholar of Japanese language and literature.

Early life
Ackroyd apparently acquired an interest Japan during her childhood, but she was not permitted to study Japanese at the University of Sydney on a teacher’s scholarship in 1936 because there was insufficient demand for Japanese in secondary schools. She graduated with honours in English and history and a major in mathematics (BA, 1940; DipEd, 1941). Ackroyd studied Japanese part-time at the University of Sydney while teaching mathematics at a Sydney boys’ school. In 1944 she began teaching Japanese at the Royal Australian Air Force language school in Sydney. She lectured in Japanese at the University of Sydney from 1944 to 1947, and then went to the University of Cambridge, where she awas awarded a PhD in Japanese Studies in 1951. Her doctoral thesis investigated the political career and writings of the Edo period Confucianist Arai Hakuseki.

In 1969, she showed prescience when she introduced a course in standard Chinese, which was not then considered to be a priority language at Australian universities.
