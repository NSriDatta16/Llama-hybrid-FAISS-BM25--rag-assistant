History
The mall which opened in 2004 was constructed under the development of CBL & Associates Properties in partnership with Burroughs and Chapin, who also owned the former Myrtle Square Mall, which closed upon the opening of Coastal Grand.  The mall was designed by the architectural firm MSTSD from Atlanta, GA. The original planned name for the mall was "Mall Of South Carolina." It quickly became the dominant mall in the Myrtle Beach area.

In March 2008, JCPenney opened a new  store. This was the chain's second store in Myrtle Beach, as it continues to operate its older store at Myrtle Beach Mall, but will be closing in April 2020.

In 2019, Dicks Sporting Goods announced it will be relocating to a new wing near Dillard's, it will also receive a Golf Galaxy location as well. The former Dicks building will be occupied by Wilmington-based Flip N Fly Trampoline Park, this will be the second location of the trampoline park chain as they have a location at Mayfaire Town Center (also owned and managed by CBL Properties) in Wilmington, NC.

On July 6, 2020 it was announced that the mall has filed a lawsuit against Bed Bath and Beyond saying that the retailer  owes about $72,000 worth of rent which it hasn't paid in April, May or June. The store occupies more than 25,000 square feet of the mall.

On November 8, 2020, it was announced that Sears would be closing as part of a plan to close 7 stores nationwide. The store closed on January 24, 2021.
