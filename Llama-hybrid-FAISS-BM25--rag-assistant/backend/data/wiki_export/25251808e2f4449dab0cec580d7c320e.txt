Browne Lake Provincial Park is a provincial park in British Columbia, Canada, located 22Â km east-southeast of Kelowna in the Okanagan Highland, near Big White Ski Resort and between the heads of Hydraulic and Grouse Creeks.

The park was established in 2004 by Order-in-Council, to protect the Interior Douglas-fir-Montane Spruce transition forest.

Browne Lake Ecological Reserve, comprising 114 hectares, lies to its northwest, and had been established in 1973, to protect a wet meadow ecosystem and surrounding forest in the Interior Cedar Hemlock zone.
