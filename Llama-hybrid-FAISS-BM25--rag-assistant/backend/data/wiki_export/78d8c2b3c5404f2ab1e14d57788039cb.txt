Lake Mary High School is a public high school located in Seminole County, Florida, operating under Seminole County Public Schools. It was opened in 1981.

Campus
Lake Mary High School was the fourth high school in Seminole County, opening for the 1981–82 academic year which is recent. Seminole High School was opened in 1902. The  physical plant includes an 800-seat auditorium, 890-seat cafeteria, 2,200-seat gymnasium, a media center, and 13 computer labs. The high school grounds contain a 4,500-seat stadium, lighted baseball field, softball field, track, tennis and handball courts, and an indoor practice building. Since 2002, the campus has undergone a $20 million project involving both new construction and remodeling, funded by a county-wide sales tax. A new  auditorium with modern band, chorus, dance and drama facilities opened in July 2003, along with a  multipurpose fieldhouse. The main building remodeling includes a new media center (14,500 sq ft), CCTV studios, additional classrooms, relocation of the administration, and expanded applied technology labs. The final phase, completed in 2006, provided practice fields and courts, parking and drainage improvements, and concession space.

In May 2008, the auditorium was named for Alice Ann Nilsen and Terry Pattishall, retiring choral and band directors. Nielsen served the school for 23 years; Pattishall, for 27 years.

Mascot
The ram is the Lake Mary High School mascot. In 2010, Chrysler objected to its corporate ram logo being used without permission. The Seminole County School Board ordered removal of Chrysler's logo from T-shirts, benches, wrestling mats, the school track and gym floor by June 15, 2010. Lake Mary High School responded that it would cost too much to remove the infringing logos, and local Chrysler dealers bore the brunt of local community anger. After discussions, a special agreement by Chrysler allowed Lake Mary High School to continue using the Dodge Ram logo as its athletic mascot, at least until equipment bearing the logo needs replacement. Instead of having to pay for the removal, Lake Mary High School will be a “Chrysler Business Partner” and will promote the relationship. Global Village Concerns (GVC), a branding and marketing services company founded in response to budget cuts impacting schools nationwide, has partnered with the school to create a new school image.

Demographics
Lake Mary High School has about 3,000 students.  Most are white, followed by Hispanic, Black and Asian.
