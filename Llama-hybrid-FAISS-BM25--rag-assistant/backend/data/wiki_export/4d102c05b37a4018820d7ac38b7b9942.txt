Albert Warren "Tilly" Tillinghast (May 7, 1876 – May 19, 1942) was an American golf course architect. Tillinghast was one of the most prolific architects in the history of golf; he worked on more than 265 different courses. He was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2015.

Tillinghast, along with William Flynn, George C. Thomas, Jr., Hugh Wilson, George Crump, and William Fownes together made up the "Philadelphia School" of golf course architecture. Together, the group designed over 300 courses, 27 of which are on in the top 100 golf courses in the world.

Personal life
Tillinghast was born in 1874 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of Lavinia Worell Davis and Benjamin Collins Tillinghast, owner of a successful rubber goods company there. He married 17 year old Lillian Heath Quigley in 1894 in Philadelphia. They had two daughters Marion Frances (1896-1969) and Elsie May (1898-1974). He lived with his wife Lillian in Beverly Hills, California, and died at his daughter Marion Frances's home in Toledo, Ohio, in 1942.
