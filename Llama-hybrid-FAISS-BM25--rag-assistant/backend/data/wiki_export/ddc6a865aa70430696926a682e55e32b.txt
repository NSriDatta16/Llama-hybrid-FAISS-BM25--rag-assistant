Plot
The residents of Pebbles Court in the suburb of Homesville in Melbourne are the unknowing test subjects for a new variety of "Vimuville" dietary supplement pills that arrive for free in their mailboxes. The pills are designed to produce the ultimate healthy human, but have unexpected side effects, including hallucinations and mutations. 

Despite the attempts made to warn the townsfolk from a previous test subject, who is now undergoing rapid cellular decay, he arrives too late, and crashes his car and is killed by tentacles growing out of his throat. The pills are consumed by the residents, and produce liquefying flesh, elongated tongues, exploding stomachs, exploding penises, imploding heads, monstrous births, tentacles growing out of the face, living mucus, sentient placentas, and other gruesome mutations. Ultimately more and more of the residents of the Pebbles Court mutate or die horrific deaths, until almost every character has been dispatched.

Critical reception 

Video review wrote "With over 150 ways to melt your body, it's one of the most innovative and versatile horror films ever. Guaranteed to make you squirm."
Samhain wrote "Unique and individual. A wicked and gruesome satire on the clean-living lifestyle of modern Australia as seen across the globe in various TV soaps."
Screen International described the film "As satirical as it is sick-making. A cult hit."
Star Burst wrote "Packs more mucous, phlegm, puke, snot, slime & spit than you'd ever think possible."
Time Out wrote "Despite its emetic preoccupation with exploding stomachs & bodily fluids there is also a liberal injection of black humour."
Fangoria wrote "A slime-soaked all-out shocker!"
Face described the film as "A dumb/smart satire on health fascism. The kind of movie they just don't make anymore."
According to Bloody Disgusting Magazine: «The film is a satire of extremely healthy living»
 PopHorror: "Residents of peaceful Pebbles Court, Homesville, are being used unknowingly as test experiments for a new Body Drug that causes rapid body decomposition (melting skin etc.) and painful death."
