The Pagan Federation is a UK-based voluntary neopaganist advocacy group. It was formed in 1971 as the Pagan Front, and campaigns for the religious rights of Neo-pagans with the aim of educating both civic bodies and the general public about Paganism. 

Pagan Federation is a constituted voluntary organisation, registered as a private Company limited by guarantee, with exemption for use of 'limited' with Companies House on 22 August 2000, with its nature listed as a Religious Organisation.

The Pagan Federation publishes a quarterly magazine, Pagan Dawn, that features articles, reviews, and research on both modern and historic Paganism.

Beliefs of the Pagan Federation 
The Pagan Federation believes that 'Paganism is the ancestral religion of the whole of humanity'. According the organisation, for a person to be pagan, they need only to believe in the following:
 Each person has a right to follow his or her own path, as long as it harms no one.
 There is a higher power (or powers).
 Nature is to be venerated.
