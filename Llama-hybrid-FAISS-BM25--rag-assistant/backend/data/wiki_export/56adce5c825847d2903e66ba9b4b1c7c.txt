The Valves were a punk rock band from Edinburgh, Scotland. One of the early British punk bands, they were chronicled in Henrik Poulsen's book 77: The Year of Punk and New Wave, and featured Dave Robertson as 'Dee Robot' on vocals, G. Dair / Teddy Dair a.k.a. Gordon Dair on drums, Gordon Scott or 'Pada' on bass guitar and Ronnie Mackinnon on guitar.

The Valves released three singles and then broke up in 1979. They reformed for a one-off gig in Edinburgh 21 December 2013. In 2015, Ronnie, Pada and Gordon joined up with Joe Donkin, of The Cheetahs and Gordon Mackinnon, on keyboards. They are currently touring under The Valves name, playing material from the Valves, the Cheetahs and new material. Dave/Dee now lives in Belgium. In 2020, they self released a retrospective LP, entitled Better Late... of material from 1977/78 and live versions of the singles from the reunion gig.
