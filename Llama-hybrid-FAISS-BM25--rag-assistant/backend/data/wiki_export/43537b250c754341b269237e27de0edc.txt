The title track ends with a quote from Johan Olof Wallins poem "Angel of Death".

Themes
On La Grande Danse Macabre, the theme is death. The lyrical themes are primarily reflective of this, with litterings present of the Satanic themes on which the band initially based themselves. The band's previous albums had been themed on  blood (Nightwing) and fire (Panzer Division Marduk), forming a trilogy of "Blood, Fire and Death". This trio of albums are considered as Marduk's tribute to Bathory, and their 1988 breakthrough album, "Blood Fire Death".
