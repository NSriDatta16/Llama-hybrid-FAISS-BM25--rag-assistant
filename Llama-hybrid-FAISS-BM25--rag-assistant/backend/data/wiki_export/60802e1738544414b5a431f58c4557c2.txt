History

In 1904, representatives of Wesleyan Methodist churches in South Carolina and surrounding states met at Central to consider the possibility of establishing a college. Classes at the new school began on October 15, 1906, with students from first grade through college. Initially known as the Wesleyan Methodist Bible Institute (1906–1908), subsequent names included Wesleyan Methodist College (1909–1959) and Central Wesleyan College (1959–1994). The school was renamed Southern Wesleyan University in 1994.

Beginning in 1928, the college operated as a two-year junior college, with a four-year theological program. In 1958, the pre-college programs were phased out, and the college moved to a full four-year program. The junior college program received accreditation that same year, and Central Wesleyan College (as the school was then called) was accredited to award bachelor's degrees in 1973. The university is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award associate's, bachelor's and master's degrees.

In addition to the traditional program, in 1986 a nontraditional program for working adults was added. Initially known as Leadership Education for Adult Professionals (LEAP), the program expanded to include various associate, bachelor's, and master's programs in an evening class format. The program evolved into what are now the fully online programs at SWU.

The university was granted an exception to Title IX in 2015 which allows it to legally discriminate against LGBT students for religious reasons.
