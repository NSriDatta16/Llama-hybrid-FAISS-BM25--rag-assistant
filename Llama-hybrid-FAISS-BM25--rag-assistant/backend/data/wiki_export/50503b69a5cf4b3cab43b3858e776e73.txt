In 1998, it transferred trade negotiation duties to the foreign ministry changing its name to Ministry of Industry and Energy. In 2008, it was restructured into Ministry of Knowledge Economy following newly elected president Lee Myung-bak's cabinet reorganization.

In 2017, it delegated duties related to SMEs to newly created Ministry of SMEs and Startups under President Moon Jae-in.
