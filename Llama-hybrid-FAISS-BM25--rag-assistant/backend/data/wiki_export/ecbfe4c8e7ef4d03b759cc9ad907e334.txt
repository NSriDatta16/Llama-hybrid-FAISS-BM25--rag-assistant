The Crowd was a charity supergroup formed specifically to produce a charity record for the Bradford City stadium fire, in which 56 people died on 11 May 1985. The group consisted of singers, actors, television personalities and others.

Gerry Marsden of Gerry and the Pacemakers had decided to make a charity record to aid the families of the victims of the disaster (the Bradford City Disaster Fund).  The re-recording of the 1963 number 1 hit song "You'll Never Walk Alone" from the Broadway musical Carousel, also a 'football anthem' for Liverpool supporters, entered the UK charts at No. 52, leaping to number 4 the following week and then reaching Number 1 on 15 June 1985. The record also topped the Irish Singles Chart. The single gave Gerry Marsden a 'first' in British recording history, by becoming the first person ever to top the charts with two versions of the same song.
