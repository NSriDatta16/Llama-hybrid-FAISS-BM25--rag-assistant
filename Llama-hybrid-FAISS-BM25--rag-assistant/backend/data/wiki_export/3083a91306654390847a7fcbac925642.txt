Plot
No Job for a Lady revolves around Jean Price, the newly elected, somewhat rebellious Labour MP for an inner-city constituency, and her life in the House of Commons. She is married to Geoff Price, who is a public defender and takes care of many of the household chores so that Jean pursue her new career. The show follows Jean while she balances her personal life with parliamentary duties, including "woman's issues," which Jean alternately fights for and is frustrated by, as other MPs think she cares about nothing else as she's a woman.  She often is surprised by other MPs duplicity and hypocrisy, holding them to a higher standard.

The Commons' chamber is never seen, with scenes alternating between Jean's office, which she shares with her Scottish colleague Ken Miller, the lobby, and various lounges of Westminster. Other characters include the whip Norman, and the Conservative MP Sir Godfrey Eagan, various visiting constituents, and Jean's secretary, Marc.
