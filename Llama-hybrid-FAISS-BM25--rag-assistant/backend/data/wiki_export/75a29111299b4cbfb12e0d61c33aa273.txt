KMUM-CD (channel 33) and KMMW-LD (channel 33) are low-power television stations licensed to Sacramento and Stockton, California, United States. Both stations are translators of Sacramento-licensed Telemundo owned-and-operated station KCSO-LD (channel 33).

KMUM-CD is classified as a Class A television station.

History

On September 25, 2006, these stations switched to the new MTV Tr3́s network (now simply known as Tr3́s since July 2010), which was created as a result of Viacom's acquisition of Más Música TeVe. Low-power analog station KMMK-LP (channel 14) in Sacramento used to simulcast with KMUM and KMMW.

In 2014, Serestar Communications agreed to purchase both KMUM and KMMW from Viacom for a disclosed amount. The sale of both stations was finalized on September 25, 2014. Prior to the sale, both of the stations dropped the Tr3́s affiliation and switched to Telemundo. After the sale, they became sister stations and translators to Telemundo affiliate KCSO-LD (channel 33).

Serestar agreed to sell KMUM-CD, KMMW-LD, and KCSO-LD to NBCUniversal on November 28, 2018, as part of a $21 million deal. The sale was completed on March 5, 2019.
