Coetzee () is an Afrikaans surname. It is the tenth most common family name in South Africa.

Origin
Unlike many other popular South African family names, which can often be unambiguously traced back to English, Dutch, or Huguenot French, the origin of the name Coetzee is unclear. It is known to date back to Dirk Coetzee, who came to Cape Colony from Kampen, Netherlands, in the 17th century.

Dutch linguist Jan-Wouter Zwart states the guess, in an informal essay, that the name derives from the common Dutch name Koetsier, guided by its pronunciation.
