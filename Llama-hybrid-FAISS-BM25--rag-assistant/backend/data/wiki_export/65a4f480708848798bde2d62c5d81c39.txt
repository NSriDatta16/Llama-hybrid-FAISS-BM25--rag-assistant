Charles married Elvira Latta on May 26, 1951. They had five children: Christopher, Nicholas, Emilie, Timothy, and Elvira. After his retirement in 1993, Charles publicly came out as gay, the first Christian bishop ever to take such a step. However, he told his wife that he was gay in 1976. He and his wife divorced shortly after his public announcement. Charles said, "I was ashamed of myself for remaining silent when the church was involved in an acrimonious debate about the whole question of gay people in the life of the church. I couldn't live with that any longer. I came to realize that I was only going to wither and die and it would be a destructive relationship for my wife and myself."

On April 24, 2004, he had a commitment ceremony with Felipe Sanchez-Paris (1941 – July 31, 2013). He legally married Sanchez-Paris on September 29, 2008.

Sanchez-Paris died on July 30, 2013. 

In 2013, Charles died in San Francisco, California. He is buried alongside Sanchez-Paris at St. Mark's Cathedral, Salt Lake City, Utah.
