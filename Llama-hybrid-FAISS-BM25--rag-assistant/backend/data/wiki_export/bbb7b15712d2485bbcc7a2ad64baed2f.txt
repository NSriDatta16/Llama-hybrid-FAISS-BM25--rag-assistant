Botany 500 is an American brand of menswear & suits that was originally part of a firm based in New York City. The name lives on today as a licensed property by several foreign clothing manufacturers.

Manufacturing

Botany 500 was a brand name owned by the Botany 500 Group of New York. Their men's suits and sport coats were manufactured in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, by H. Daroff and Sons, who were contracted with Botany Mills of Passaic, New Jersey, to produce products and later bought the firm outright. Their plant was located at 23rd and Walnut Streets during the 1940s, 1950s, and beyond. Until 1945, it was located in the Pitcairn Building at 1027 Arch Street. They also produced another line called Worsted-Tex that had the image of the head of a German Shepherd dog on its label. The office, on the first floor of the plant, had a stuffed German shepherd standing guard. The seventh and topmost floor contained the top coat design department and a fabric cutting floor.

Decline

Daroff and Sons and the Botany 500 group went bankrupt in August 1973. An attempt was made to turn the company over to another company, named Cohen and Sons, which was still operating profitably. Because of resistance by the company's employees, Cohen backed out of the deal by the end of September. When Daroff finally closed its doors in December 1973, Cohen and Sons bought the Botany 500 name and assets for $4 million. They planned to keep the labels, marketing, sales, and distribution of Botany as a separate Botany 500 line which was produced at 2700 N. Broad St in Philadelphia.

With the garment business taking a downturn during the second half of the decade, the Botany and Cohen and Sons operations ceased production in Philadelphia in 1986. The building was sold in 1989 for $1.75 million.  Production of the Botany label was moved to a sister company within the corporate owner's portfolio previously known as Cross Country Clothes which had facilities in Northampton and Whitehall PA.  The combined company was renamed as The 500 Fashion Group which manufactured suits and sportcoats. The Botany 500 label for men's tailored clothing was produced in Northampton/Whitehall until 1995. At that point, the decision was made by the investors in the parent corporation (E-II Corporation) to liquidate the four companies which the corporation held.  As no buyer could be found for a unionized apparel manufacturer in the Northeast, The 500 Fashion Group was closed.

The Botany 500 label was sold and manufacturing under the Botany 500 name was then outsourced to foreign companies. In 2021, the Botany 500 name resurfaced as a brand name sold by the mail-order company Haband as it appeared in their fall 2021 catalogue.
