Biography

Early life
Carruthers moved to Rugby in 1977, and joined St Mark's Junior school.

After leaving Lawrence Sheriff School at the age of 16, he went to work in a sheet metal factory in Birmingham, and it was then he began to teach himself to play bass.  He then moved back to Rugby, and became involved in the local music scene, joining the local band, The Cogs of Tyme.

Carruthers plays a 1976 Gibson Thunderbird electric bass guitar.

Spacemen 3
Carruthers joined Spacemen 3, replacing bassist Pete Bain, in 1988.  One of his first gigs was the performance that would represent the live Dreamweapon album. He performed on Spacemen 3 third studio album, Playing with Fire released in 1989. Spacemen 3 toured extensively in Europe in 1989. Carruthers contributed to Peter Kember's solo side project, album Spectrum.  He also played on Spacemen 3's fourth and final studio album, Recurring. At a time when internal conflict was rife in the band, Carruthers left the Spacemen 3 in 1990 before the album was completed.  He went to work on a building site as a labourer to pay off the debts he had incurred during his time in the band.

Spiritualized
Following the demise of Spacemen 3, Carruthers was approached by Jason Pierce to join a new band that he was forming with all of the musicians from Spacemen 3 except Peter Kember.  Carruthers was eventually persuaded to join, and the band recorded a single "Anyway That You Want Me", a cover of a song that was a hit for The Troggs. The band then began to tour rigorously around the UK and then recorded the album Lazer Guided Melodies.  Before the release of the album, Carruthers left the band due to a payment dispute, and went back to the building site.

Hiatus from music industry
Disillusioned, Carruthers quit the music industry, and moved to the Lake District.  He would not play live for four years.  Carruthers drifted around the country, doing odd-jobs, working as a waiter, a cook, a gardener, on building sites, as a roadie and doing various other menial jobs.
