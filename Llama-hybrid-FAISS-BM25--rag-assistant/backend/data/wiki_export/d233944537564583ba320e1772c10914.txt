Life and career

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, Frierson has been doing voicework for many anime series and movies since the 1980s, and has also been a voice actor for two of Saban Entertainment's most well-known shows - the Power Rangers franchise and VR Troopers. While during his tenure in the Saban shows, he only did voicework for one-shot characters in the earlier years, he was able to play a major role in 2001's Power Rangers Time Force when he did the voice of the mad robot scientist Frax. After the PR franchise moved to New Zealand in 2003 (which laid off much of the PR crew, Frierson included), Frierson has continued to do voicework for various anime series such as .hack and Robotech, as well as voicework in animated children's movies such as Curious George, Chicken Little, and The Wild. He has also done voicework for different video game franchises, such as the Medal of Honor series.

Frierson's theater work includes roles such as Horatio in Mark Ringer's staging of Hamlet, and Flute in A Midsummer Night's Dream at Nevada Shakespeare in the Park. He twice won the prestigious Maurice Scott Award for Los Angeles theatre for his performances as Dapper in Ben Jonson's The Alchemist at the Globe Playhouse and as Count Vronsky in Anna Karenina at Theatre Rapport.  He also won a New England Drama Critic's award for his portrayal of the dim-witted Red Sox pitcher Tank in Steve Kluger's acclaimed nine-inning comedy, Bullpen.

Eddie was on Tic Tac DOugh in the 1985-86 season and won $4900 in cash.

Matty

Frierson's award-winning one-man show Matty: An Evening With Christy Mathewson, directed by fellow voice actor Kerrigan Mahan, is built around Hall of Fame baseball pitcher Christy Mathewson.  Frierson has taken the show across the country, including Off-Broadway in New York, and National Public Radio named it one of the 10 best shows of the New York theatre season. He won Drama-Logue Awards as both an actor and writer during the show's Los Angeles engagement. He has performed the show in Mathewson's hometown of Factoryville, Pennsylvania, at the pitcher's alma mater Bucknell University, and at the Baseball Hall of Fame.

Frierson has formed The Mathewson Foundation, dedicated to the preservation of American History through baseball.  He plans to focus those efforts and locate the Foundation in Factoryville.  Also in the works for Frierson are the first true biographies of Christy, both in book form and for the big screen.
