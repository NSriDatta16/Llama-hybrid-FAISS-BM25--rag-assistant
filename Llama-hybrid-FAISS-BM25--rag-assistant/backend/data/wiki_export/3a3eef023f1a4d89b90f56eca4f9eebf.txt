Schwanewede is a municipality in the district of Osterholz, in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is situated approximately 14 km west of Osterholz-Scharmbeck, and 22 km northwest of Bremen.

It belonged to the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen. In 1648, the Prince-Archbishopric was transformed into the Duchy of Bremen, which first was ruled by the Swedish in personal union. In 1715, the Hanoverian Crown started to rule over Schwanwede until 1823, in which the Duchy was abolished, leading all of its territory to become part of the Stade Region.
