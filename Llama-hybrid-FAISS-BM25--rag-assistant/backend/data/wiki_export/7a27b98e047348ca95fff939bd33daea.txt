History
The Clinton Township School District undertook a project to consider the possibility of withdrawing from the North Hunterdon-Voorhees Regional High School District to form an independent K-12 school district. In February 2005, the Clinton Township Board of Education commissioned a study to consider the educational and financial effects of a proposed withdrawal scenario for Clinton Township, with a report estimating that annual savings for the district could be as high as $1.2 million.

In 2018, it was announced that Clinton Township Middle School (CTMS) and Round Valley School (RVS) would be realigning grades, with CTMS switching from grades 7 and 8 to grades 6 through 8, and Round Valley now having students from grade 3 to 5, instead of 4 to 6.
