Egne hjem was an Oslo Metro and Oslo Tramway station on the Kolsås Line located in Bærum, Norway. The station was situated between Ringstabekk and Bekkestua,  from Stortinget.

The station was opened on 3 November 1924. In 2006, it was the least busy station on the Kolsås Line and was located only  from Ringstabekk and  from Bekkestua. Owing to the low number of passengers and poor location, the station was not reopened following the upgrade of the Kolsås Line.
