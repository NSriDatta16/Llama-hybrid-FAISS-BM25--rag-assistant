Love:30 is the second studio album by American piano rock band The Visible Men, released in 2005 on Leisure King Productions.

Overview
In contrast to the minimalist approach heard on In Socks Mode, Love:30 is rooted more in psychedelic eclecticism, featuring a richer keyboard-driven sound and the inclusion of additional instruments such as accordions and electric guitars.

Love:30 was released to a generally positive reception, with much praise being given to the music and most criticism being directed at its lyrics. The Daily Emerald called the music "well-crafted and engaging", with the reviewer stating "I would hate to be any other band in town if The Visible Men ever hit their stride", and Sacramento's News Review, though deriding the tendency of the lyrics to "take themselves too seriously", summarized the album as "melancholy and beautiful".
