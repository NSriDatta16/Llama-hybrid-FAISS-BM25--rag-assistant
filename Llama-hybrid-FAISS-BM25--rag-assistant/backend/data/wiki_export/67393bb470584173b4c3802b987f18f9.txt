Dandruff is an album by Ivor Cutler, originally released in 1974. It was the first of three LPs that Cutler released through Virgin Records in the mid-1970s; Cutler had signed to the label after an appearance on Robert Wyatt's Rock Bottom, which Virgin had released earlier that year. Many of the album's 45 tracks are simple poems or brief short stories—including seven poems composed and read by Phyllis King, but there are also a number of musical pieces including the calypso-inspired "I Believe in Bugs", which became particularly well loved among Cutler's compositions. The LP was also the first to feature episodes from Cutler's Life in a Scotch Sitting Room series of autobiographical stories, which resulted in 1978's Life in a Scotch Sitting Room, Vol. 2.
