Zhang Ji (died 223), courtesy name Derong, was an official who lived during the late Eastern Han dynasty and early Three Kingdoms period of China. During the Battle of Tong Pass, Zhang Ji, Xiahou Yuan and others defended the city of Chang'an from attacks by the warlord Ma Chao and his allies. From 213 to 220, Zhang Ji served as the Inspector of Yong Province. In 220, after the Han dynasty ended and the Three Kingdoms period started, Zhang Ji served under the state of Cao Wei as the Inspector of Liang Province. In 221, he quelled a Lushuihu (盧水胡; Lushui barbarians) rebellion in the Hexi Corridor.

He earned some merit for his administration during this time. His son, Zhang Ji (Jingzhong), also served as an official in the Cao Wei state.
