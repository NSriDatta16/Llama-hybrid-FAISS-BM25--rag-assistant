Gabi Rasu, also known as Administrative Zone 3, is a zone in the Afar Region of Ethiopia. This zone is bordered on the south by the Oromia Region, on the southwest by the Amhara Region, on the west by Hari Rasu, on the north by Awsi Rasu, and on the east by the Somali Region.

This zone covers most of the territory of the former Gobaad sultanate. Towns include Awash and Gewane. Rivers include the Awash and Germama.
Gabi Rasu consists eight woredas and one town administration, including Gawane, Amibara, Galaqu, Hawaash Fantiqale, Hanruka, Dullacha, Argobba, and Hawash Subah.

History 
The Awash River flows through the south and western parts of this zone, periodically flooding during the June-to-September rainy season. During 1996, the river flooded parts of Bure Mudaytu and Gewane woredas, but a UNDP team dispatched to survey the area failed to find significant damage. However, in August 1999, a planned release of waters from the Koka Reservoir resulted in flooding by the Awashâ€”although an investigation afterwards showed the flooding was caused by dike failures and silting of the Awash, especially around Melka Were. Approximately  of cropland from 12 rural kebeles in Amibara and 3 rural kebeles in Dulecha were affected. The Awash flooded again 16 August 2006, displacing 15,000 people and damaging  planted in cotton, corn, onions and sesame.

In June 2002, the Afar, the Issa Somali, and the Ittu Oromo engaged in armed clashes in Gewane, Amibara, and Awash Fentale woredas over drought-diminished grazing resources. As a result, the traditional division of work was ignored: women no longer tended livestock and men guarded their herds with weapons. Pastoral groups from this zone concentrated in the Awash lowlands, which forced pastoral groups from Hari Rasu to move west and compete with the Argobba.
