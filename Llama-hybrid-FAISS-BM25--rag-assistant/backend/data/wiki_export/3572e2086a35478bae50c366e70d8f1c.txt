History

The JR East station opened on 25 December 1896. The Tobu station opened three years later on August 27, with through services with the Hibiya Line commencing in 1962. The Tokyo Metro platforms opened as the initial northern terminus of the Chiyoda line in 1969. The Tsukuba Express station opened on August 24, 2005.

From 17 March 2012, station numbering was introduced on all Tobu lines, with Kita-Senju Station becoming "TS-09".

The station facilities of the Hibiya and Chiyoda Lines were inherited by Tokyo Metro after the privatization of the Teito Rapid Transit Authority (TRTA) in 2004.
