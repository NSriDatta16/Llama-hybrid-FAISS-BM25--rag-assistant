Topock Gorge is a mountainous canyon and gorge section of the Colorado River, located between Interstate 40 and Lake Havasu. The town of Needles, California, to the northwest, was named for the "needle-like" vertical rock outcroppings. The natural landmarks and river crossing by them were one of the journey markers for travelers on historic Route 66.
