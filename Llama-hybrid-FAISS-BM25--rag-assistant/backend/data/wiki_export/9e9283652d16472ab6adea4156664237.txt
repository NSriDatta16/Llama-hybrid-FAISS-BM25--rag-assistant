Route description
Sheridan Street begins at US 27 (SR 25). It serves as the southern boundaries of Cooper City and Davie and the northern boundary of Pembroke Pines along the way. This carries the designation of CR 822, though it is also signed as "TO SR 822" (although it is signed at its intersections with State Road 7 and University Drive.

In Hollywood, Sheridan Street intersects US 441 and SR 7 continuing eastbound as a divided road out of a commercial area to residential housing for a few blocks before becoming a mix of residential and commercial ventures. This intersection marks the transition from CR 822 to SR 822 as well. East of Park Road, it forms the southern boundary of Topeekeegee Yugnee Park, quickly headed for an interchange with Interstate 95 (I-95), with commercial areas on both sides of the street prior to the interchange. East of I-95, Sheridan Street becomes a bit more residential, although businesses line the street, as it passes by Boggs Field Park, and intersects US 1. East of US 1, the divided street ends, and the road becomes purely residential. It enters West Lake Park, providing access to Anne Kolb Nature Center, following a crossing of West Lake. Sheridan Street then crosses the Intracoastal Waterway, terminating at SR A1A near Hollywood Beach Park.
