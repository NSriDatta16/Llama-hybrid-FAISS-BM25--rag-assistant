Shariful Haque (born 15 January 1976) is a former Bangladeshi cricketer who played one One Day International in 1998.

His career ended when he was given an indefinite ban by the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) in 2012 after he was found guilty of spot-fixing in a Bangladesh Premier League match. The Dhaka Gladiators captain Mashrafe Mortaza had earlier reported to his team management a spot-fixing approach by a cricketer.
