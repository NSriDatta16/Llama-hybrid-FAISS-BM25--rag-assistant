Malcolm Kennedy is a fictional character from the Australian television soap opera Neighbours, played by Benjamin McNair. Shortly after he was cast, McNair relocated to Melbourne to be closer to the studio. He admitted that it was a shock leaving his family and friends in Sydney. The older members of the cast eventually helped him feel more comfortable. He made his first appearance during the episode broadcast on 3 October 1994, as he arrives on Ramsay Street with his parents and siblings. An early storyline for Malcolm was a romance with Danni Stark (Eliza Szonert), to whom he lost his virginity. Other storylines explored a friendship with Stonefish Rebecchi (Anthony Engleman), a career as a handyman and later, coffee chain salesman, and marriage to Catherine O'Brien (Radha Mitchell). The character's departure aired on 11 March 1997. McNair made two brief returns in 2002 and 2004, and a year later he reprised his role for the show's 20th anniversary. In July 2011, Malcolm returns to help his parents with their marriage and has a brief affair with Jade Mitchell (Gemma Pranita). McNair returned to Neighbours in October 2014 for the 20th anniversary of the Kennedys' introduction. He also reprised his role in July 2022 for the serial's finale.

Creation and casting
In 1994, the Neighbours' storyliners decided to introduce the "solid" Kennedy family as they felt that they needed to take the show back to its roots when it seemed that all the houses on Ramsay Street were populated with misfits and distant relatives. McNair joined the cast as eldest sibling Malcolm, brother to Libby (Kym Valentine) and Billy (Jesse Spencer). Upon winning the role of Malcolm, McNair relocated from Sydney to Melbourne for filming. McNair admitted that while he was pleased to get the role, he was not so keen on moving, saying "it was a real shock leaving my family and friends to move into an apartment on my own, then having to turn up at work not knowing anybody in the cast." McNair said the older cast members helped him out, making him feel more comfortable, and after a year in the role, McNair was happier about staying on.

Development

Characterisation
Malcolm is the eldest Kennedy child. He was 17 upon his introduction, four years younger than McNair, who found the age gap made a big difference. He explained to Woman'''s Erica Goatly: "I've been through the teenage years and have sorted myself out, while Mal's still going through it." McNair also thought he was very different to his character. Malcolm is an athlete, who enjoys being in charge. Following his arrival, Malcolm quickly gets involved in Ramsay Street "shenanigans".

Relationship with Danni Stark
In a bid to increase ratings, producers plotted a Romeo and Juliet-style romance between Malcolm and Danni Stark (Eliza Szonert). Jason Herbison of Inside Soap said "Love blooms soon after Danni Stark sets eyes on Malcolm, but their road to love is a rocky one, dogged by family feuds and a dark secret! But will love conquer all?" Malcolm was initially shown to be attracted to Bianca Zanotti (Annie Gagliardi), but when he makes a romantic advance, she slaps him and he turns to Danni for comfort. As she reassures him, Malcolm realises that Danni is the one he should be dating. Malcolm soon finds himself "out of his depth" with his more sexually experienced girlfriend. McNair told Goatly that his character is a virgin and does not feel able to tell Danni, so he comes across as standoffish. Once Malcolm tells Danni the truth, she seduces him. McNair said, "After they've had sex he feels great and from then on it develops into an upfront, mature sexual relationship."

McNair admitted to being nervous when it came to kissing Szonert, as it marked his first on-screen kiss. He asked Szonert and co-star Richard Grieve for advice, and found it "wasn't such a big deal" because he got on well with Szonert. The kissing scenes also gave McNair confidence in his acting ability. He explained, "You have to feel what your character is feeling, but it was great because I was also able to separate the screen situation from myself." Malcolm and Danni become inseparable, and although their parents disapprove, they rent Number 32, so they can have some privacy. The relationship continues to develop quickly, and is soon tested by a pregnancy scare after Malcolm and Danni forget to use contraception while they spend the night at a hotel. McNair reckoned the couple were too young to be parents. The pair later live with Malcolm's best friend Stonefish Rebecchi (Anthony Engleman) after they struggle with the rent, and his mother also comes to stay. Malcolm and Danni later move back to their old homes.

Accident
During the 1996 end-of-season cliffhanger, Malcolm's windpipe is crushed during an accident at Chez Chez, where he is doing some repair work with Darren Stark (Todd MacDonald). Malcolm trips over a dustsheet and causes a plank holding paint and tools to fall on his neck. Darren and Karl pull the plank off Malcolm's neck and find Malcolm cannot breathe. Karl realises the only way to save Malcolm is to perform an emergency tracheotomy. However, Karl has not practiced medicine since Cheryl Stark's (Caroline Gillmer) death, which he believes he caused. Jason Herbison of Inside Soap said "Karl freezes, and unless he gets his nerve back, he could have more blood on his conscience." Karl manages to perform the procedure and saves Malcolm's life. McNair later called the storyline "awesome" and revealed it was his favourite.

Departure
McNair departed Neighbours in 1997. Malcolm decided to go travelling, shortly after he discovered his girlfriend Catherine O'Brien (Radha Mitchell) was having an affair with Darren. When he discovered the affair, Malcolm punched Darren and then announced his intentions to leave Erinsborough. Catherine tried to get him to change his mind, but Malcolm packed his bags and headed to the airport. Catherine then booked a ticket on the same plane and offered to come with him. Malcolm found it "tough" to forgive Catherine, as he was hurt by her betrayal, but he eventually agreed to her offer and they reunited as they left the country.

Return (2002)
In February 2002, Tim Randall of the Daily Record reported McNair had reprised his role for six weeks. The actor stated "It's been five years since Mal packed his bags and went to England and that's five full years of doing other things for me. But I learnt a lot doing Neighbours and coming back for a stint is perfect. Let's just say he's not the Mal he used to be." Malcolm's friends and family are pleased to see him again, but they soon come to realise that he is a changed man. Malcolm is no longer easygoing, instead he has become a ruthless entrepreneur and has his eyes on Harold Bishop's (Ian Smith) coffee shop. McNair explained "Mal has turned into a bit of a business tycoon. He's now married - though his wife Catherine is in England - and he works for a coffee shop chain called Cuppa Diem. He comes back to Erinsborough to open up a franchise, and he thinks that Harold's coffee shop is the perfect venue to launch it." Malcolm does not reveal his intentions for the coffee shop right away and just states that he is home for a visit. McNair told Inside Soap's Herbison that Malcolm is very happy to see everyone again and he has brought them all presents.

Malcolm is also really happy to see Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) because they used to be good friends. Toadie Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) is the first to notice that Malcolm's ego "has grown to the size of Anson's Corner" and his reasons for returning are not all personal. Toadie later overhears Malcolm talking to Harold about the coffee shop and Cuppa Diem. He suggests that Harold joins the franchise or he will regret it. Malcolm says it with a smile, but Harold is aware that he is being threatened. Toadie attempts to question Malcolm about what he saw, but they are interrupted by a phone call that reveals his true agenda to his parents. McNair revealed "Mal gets this phone call, and from the tone of his voice, it's clear he's under pressure from London to close the coffee shop deal. It's the first Karl or Susan have heard of it, and they can't believe their son is money-driven. We get the impression that this is an issue that's really going to test the family." McNair added that he had great fun catching up with his on-screen family, as they had always been very close. At the end of his guest stint in May, Doug Anderson of The Sydney Morning Herald wished Malcolm good luck.

McNair returned again in 2004 and 2005, where he joined many former cast members reprising their roles for the show's 20th anniversary episode, "Friends for Twenty Years".

Return (2011)
On 9 May 2011, it was announced that McNair would be returning to Neighbours for a four-month guest stint. The actor begin filming his first scenes the following week and Malcolm began appearing from 18 July. Malcolm returns to Ramsay Street to help repair his parents' marriage, after Susan becomes emotionally involved with another man. Of his return, McNair said "It's great to be back. While there have been a few changes and lots of new faces, Mum (Jackie Woodburne) and Dad (Alan Fletcher) are still the same, so it really is like coming home." During an interview with Digital Spy, McNair explained that Malcolm returns to Ramsay Street to see his parents after sensing that there is a problem between them. He has also been speaking to Libby and Billy and they agree that there is trouble brewing. McNair said "Malcolm is trying to get to the bottom of it without appearing too nosy. He cares about his parents deeply and wants them to live a life of harmony, so if he can help, he'll certainly try."

The actor said Malcolm is not surprised that his parents are facing marital problems, but it may be a surprise as to where the troubles are coming from. Previous problems have come from Karl and his infidelity issues, but this is something different. McNair revealed that he thinks Malcolm does have what it takes to get things back on track for his parents as he has a lot of compassion and maturity to deal with both sides of the story. When asked if Malcolm has changed since his last appearance, McNair revealed that he is very similar and still assertive in a business sense. Malcolm is now working with a large company as an area manager and he has an air of confidence about him. He is successful and travels throughout Europe. Malcolm and his wife, Catherine, have become a professional couple and have decided not to have children.

Affair with Jade Mitchell
In October 2011, Malcolm befriends Jade Mitchell (Gemma Pranita) and they begin flirting. Jade uses Malcolm to distract her from her feelings for Kyle Canning (Chris Milligan) and Susan Hill from the Daily Star said the fact Malcolm is married appeals to Jade because she knows there is no chance of a relationship. Jade needs some fun and she reckons Malcolm is the person to help her. However, the pair's innocent flirting turns into something more serious when Jade arranges a "late-night rendezvous" with Malcolm. Due to his father's history of infidelity, TV Week said Malcolm proves to be "a chip off the old block" when he kisses Jade. Of Jade's relationship with Malcolm, Pranita told the magazine, "The reason she goes to Malcolm is purely to gain some sort of control back in her life because everything's spiralling out of control due to these feelings she has for Kyle. Her default position is to go back to what she knows - which is to hook up with men who won't want anything serious, like taken men or people who are up for a one-night stand. He's like a safety harness really." Malcolm and Jade begin an affair, but they are forced to end it when Karl finds out about it and warns his son off. A source told Hill "Mal has been risking his marriage for a passionate full-on affair with Jade. She's one of the hottest babes on the street and Mal couldn't resist her. He doesn't take too kindly to Karl's lecture given his track record but he agrees to end it." Malcolm is left "a little rattled" by Jade's reaction to the end of their affair, as she does not appear to be fussed at all.

Returns (2014, 2022)
On 11 March 2014, it was announced that McNair would be returning to Neighbours to help celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Kennedys' introduction. Malcolm returned on 2 October 2014. He visits his parents to suggest that they take an early retirement and move to England to be with him and Catherine, who is pregnant. Woodburne explained, "they want Karl and Susan to help them out with the baby they're going to have. Mal and Catherine didn't think they were ever going to have any children, but surprise surprise, Catherine is pregnant and they're a bit overwhelmed! They're hoping that mum and dad can help them out." Malcolm's suggestion leads Karl and Susan to reflect on their 20-year history in Erinsborough.

McNair was one of over twenty actors who reprised their roles for the serial's final episodes, following its cancellation in early 2022. His return will air on 14 July in the UK and 21 July in Australia, as Malcolm visits his parents to tell them he and Catherine have broken up. Unbeknownst to them, he is now in a relationship with his father's former girlfriend Izzy Hoyland (Natalie Bassingthwaighte), who is hiding out at his hotel. In order to let his parents process the news about his marriage, Malcolm puts off telling them about Izzy, until she shows up on their doorstep and makes hints about their connection, leaving "a sheepish Mal" to explain that he and Izzy have fallen in love with each other.

When he returns he tries to ask Karl about Jim Dolan (Scott Parmeter), a dying man Susan befriended. Malcolm catches up with both Lou and Toadfish Rebecchi and notices Andrew Robinson (Jordan Smith) renting his house out to backpackers. Malcolm tells Karl not to make anything more out of Susan's friendship with Jim and to support her or he will end up driving her away. Malcolm tells Toadie about Andrew's scheme and then warns Summer Hoyland (Jordy Lucas) to end it, before she gets his parents into trouble.

Malcolm is angry and blames Susan, but Karl confesses it was his idea.

Malcolm begins flirting with Jade Mitchell and he begins an affair with her. Karl tells Malcolm he knows about his affair with Jade, as he saw them kissing. Karl urges Malcolm to end his relationship with Jade and he does. Susan later learns of Malcolm's affair and she is disappointed with him.

Eight years later, Malcolm makes a surprise visit to see his parents. They attend Toadie's engagement party together, where Malcolm reveals to his parents that he and Catherine have separated. He explains that he was keen to move back to Australia, but Catherine was not interested. This led to numerous issues between them, which made them both miserable. When Malcolm returns to his hotel room, Izzy is waiting for him and he tells her that he did not get to tell his parents about her yet. The following day, Malcolm is about to explain to Karl and Susan that he and Izzy are together when Izzy enters the house. Malcolm then says that they are together and in love. Karl and Susan yell at Malcolm for keeping it a secret and say that their relationship probably has an agenda. When Malcolm asks Susan and Karl to accept his relationship once more, Susan tells him that he must pick between her and Izzy. Malcolm picks Izzy. However, Izzy later reveals to him that she kissed Shane Ramsay (Peter O'Brien), so they break up. Malcolm later attends Toadie's wedding and watches his siblings give Toadie congratulation messages by video, then attends their reception on Ramsay Street.

Reception
The BBC said Malcolm's most notable moment was "having an accident at Chez Chez where Karl had to save his life." In 1996, the BBC censored the programme, when it edited out scenes involving Karl agonising over Malcolm's sexual activity with Danni. The broadcaster felt the scenes were inappropriate for the early evening timeslot. The Daily Mirror said that "things were looking up" for Malcolm when he started dating Shona (Bryony Price) and branded him as "the heartthrob handyman." Caroline Milburn of The Age called Malcolm a "larrikin." Michael Cregana of Inside Soap'' called Malcolm "the prodigal son" and said he was a "rotter" when he tried to get his hands on the Coffee Shop. In 2011, Yahoo! said that viewers should be excited that Malcolm was returning because everyone loves him. They added "you can tell from the fact that the cast always want him back that he has real chemistry with everyone on set." Malcolm received a nomination for Best Comeback from the 2012 All About Soap Awards.
