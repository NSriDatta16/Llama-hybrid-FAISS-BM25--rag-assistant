Björn Cederberg (born July 23, 1937), nicknamed "Kapten" (engl. Captain, due to his rank in the Swedish Army), is a notable Swedish rally co-driver. His most famous and successful partnership was with Stig Blomqvist, in a Saab 99 Turbo, with whom he shared success in a number of international motor rallies, from 1979–1982. Later in 1982, the pair went on to rally the Audi Quattro, with which they were again very successful until 1985.
