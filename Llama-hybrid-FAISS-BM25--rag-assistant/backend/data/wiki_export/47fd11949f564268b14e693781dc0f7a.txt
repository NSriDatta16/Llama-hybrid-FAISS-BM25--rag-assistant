Rugby league career

2002-2008: Signing with Canterbury-Bankstown
As a South Sydney junior, a young Maitua had aspirations to represent the South Sydney Rabbitohs at the highest level, however, this was soured by the club as he was dropped from a Harold Matthews Cup squad on the premise of him being a year young for the state under-16s competition.
Maitua signed with Sydney's Canterbury-Bankstown club in 2002, spending the first two years representing the Jersey Flegg U20 & reserve grade sides alongside future stars Johnathan Thurston & Sonny Bill Williams winning the 2003 Jersey Flegg Cup Premiership.

Despite the success in the lower grades, Maitua did not make his first grade début until Round 1 of the 2004 NRL season against the Parramatta Eels on 13 March. Maitua played for Canterbury-Bankstown from the interchange bench in their 2004 NRL grand final victory over cross-town rivals, the Sydney Roosters. As 2004 NRL premiers, the Canterbury club faced Super League IX champions, the Leeds Rhinos in the 2005 World Club Challenge. Maitua played at second-row forward in the Bulldogs' 32–39 loss. In season 2005, Maitua had an up and down season, suffering an ankle injury in the trial game against South Sydney Rabbitohs missing up to six games.

He was also needed to appear in Sutherland Local Court on 18 May where a plea of guilty was entered on his behalf. He will be required to make a personal appearance for sentencing on 3 August. In the meantime, his licence is suspended and the court was told that Maitua will complete a traffic offenders education program before his sentencing. But his sentencing was postponed till 17 August because complications arose as Reni's lawyer advised him not to attend the court appearance on 3 August. Though he appeared at his second court appearance for the sentencing the judge ruled that his licence was to be suspended for 18 months and a fine of $2800. 

Maitua had been named in the Australian Rugby League team for the Tri Nations series for the first time in his career after a knee injury ruled Brisbane forward Tonie Carroll out of the upcoming Tri-Nations tournament.

Controversy
In 2006, Reni Maitua was convicted of drink driving after he blew 0.165 in a random breath test in Cronulla, while on P-plates. A reading of 0.165 is more than three times the legal limit for a fully licensed driver, but the limit for P-platers is zero.
In December 2008, Maitua's contract with the Bulldogs was terminated by the club after he failed to attend training. He is also a known member of the Bra Boys.

On 20 May 2009, Maitua tested positive to a banned drug and was handed a provisional suspension. On 15 June 2009, it was announced that Maitua would be suspended for 2 years following the positive test of the second sample.

In late 2013, it was revealed that Maitua had been suffering from severe depression. In mid 2013, Maitua suffered a breakdown after a game in Brisbane, and days later attempted suicide. Maitua's best friend Willie Tonga was awake at 1:00am when he received a call from Maitua's sister, who had received a text message which scared her greatly. Tonga chose to drive to Maitua's unit, and found Maitua attempting to take his own life. Tonga believes that had he even arrived 5 seconds later, Maitua would not have survived. Maitua and Tonga told their story on the NRL Footy Show in June 2014 as an attempt to help remove the stigma around mental illness in league.
