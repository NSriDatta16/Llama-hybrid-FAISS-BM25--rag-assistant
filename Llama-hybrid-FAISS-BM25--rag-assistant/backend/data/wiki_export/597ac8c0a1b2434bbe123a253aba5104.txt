TVR 1 (; spelled out as Televiziunea Română 1, "Romanian Television 1") is the main channel of the Romanian public broadcaster TVR.

The most important show of the channel is Jurnalul TVR, whose motto is  ("The news journal as it should be"), but on 28 March 2009 was replaced by Telejurnal, which is its name till today. In 1985, Programul 1 renamed again to TVR becoming the sole television channel in Romania.

In 1989, TVR1 broadcast live the events of the revolt which triggered the fall of the Communist regime, covering almost all the main events live, starting from the last speech of Nicolae Ceauşescu (on December 21, 1989) until the new power representatives arrived. At the time, fabricated and exaggerated stories were broadcast, nevertheless TVR1 was the first television channel to cover all the events of the regime change.

After TVR HD was closed, TVR 1 has launched an HD broadcast on November 3, 2019, with its other sister channel, TVR 2. TVR is also testing HD broadcasting on its other channels, but momentarily, the HD broadcasts are only available on its on-demand service, TVR+.
