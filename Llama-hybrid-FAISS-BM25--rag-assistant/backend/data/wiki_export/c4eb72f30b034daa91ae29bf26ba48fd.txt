Arthur's Hill is a district of Newcastle upon Tyne. It lies approximately 1 mile west of Newcastle City Centre. It is bordered by Fenham to the west, Elswick to the south, and Spital Tongues to the north west. It gives name to a Newcastle City Council electoral ward with a population of 14,507. The area was part of the Westgate and Wingrove electoral wards up until 2018.

As the name suggests, Arthur's Hill is atop a large hill overlooking the city. It was known as Westgate until the 1820s.  Isaac Cookson developed an estate opposite Westgate Cemetery in 1826.  This was named after his first son Arthur, the origin of the area's current name.
