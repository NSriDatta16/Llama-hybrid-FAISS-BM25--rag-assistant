Moo, You Bloody Choir is the third studio album by the Australian indie rock band Augie March. It was released in 2006 in Australia by BMG. It entered the ARIA album charts at #10 and was nominated for Album of the Year at the ARIA Music Awards of 2006, losing to Tea & Sympathy by Bernard Fanning.

The album was re-released 19 May 2007 with a bonus CD of live and unreleased tracks. The 2006 version of "There Is No Such Place" features an orchestra. 

The title comes directly from the lyrics of "The Honey Month".

Reception
At the ARIA Music Awards of 2006, the album was nominated for five awards. It also won the Australian Music Prize in 2006. At the J Award of 2006, the album was nominated for Australian Album of the Year.

In October 2010, Moo, You Bloody Choir was listed in the top 50 in the book, 100 Best Australian Albums. In 2011, the album featured at number 93 on the Triple J Hottest 100 Albums of All Time.

The lead single, "One Crowded Hour" peaked on the ARIA singles chart at #29 and was voted #1 on the Triple J Hottest 100 chart.

Named the 98th best Australian album by Rolling Stone Australia in 2021, they said, "a gorgeous, ambitious album layered with storytelling and poetry, Augie March setting the scene carefully as if they were directors of a play. Moo, You Bloody Choir is filled with character studies and surreal imagery—of bandits and hangings, of rivers with eyes, of those in search of something larger than themselves."
