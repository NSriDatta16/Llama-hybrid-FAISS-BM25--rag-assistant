Overview
"Shining Star" was produced by Maurice White and composed by White, Larry Dunn and Philip Bailey. 

The concept for the song came to Maurice White while strolling at night during the band's recording of That's the Way of the World at Caribou Ranch. He became inspired by looking up at the starry sky and took his ideas about the song to the other band members.

Critical reception
Vibe called Shining Star a "treasure". Alex Henderson of Allmusic described the song as "sweaty funk". Gordon Fletcher of Rolling Stone wrote that the song "glow(s) with an incendiary charge that once moved record producer Sandy Pearlman to term EW&F 'the closest thing to a black heavy-metal band'." Daryl Easlea of the BBC found that "Shining Star can be seen as much an influence on Prince as anything by James Brown". Stephen Curwood of The Boston Globe noted that the tune "shows off the fabulous range and coordination of this nine-man vocal ensemble and instrumental choir.

"Shining Star" also won a Grammy for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.
