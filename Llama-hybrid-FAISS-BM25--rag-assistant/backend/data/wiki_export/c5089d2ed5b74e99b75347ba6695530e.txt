The 44th British Academy Film Awards, given by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts in 1991, honoured the best films of 1990.

Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas won five awards: Best Film, Director, Adapted Screenplay, Costume Design, and Editing. Cinema Paradiso, directed by Giuseppe Tornatore, also won five awards, including Best Actor (Philippe Noiret), Supporting Actor (Salvatore Cascio) and Film Not in the English Language.

With its five wins, Cinema Paradiso achieved a new record for the most BAFTAs for a film not in the English language; this record was surpassed by the German language anti-war epic All Quiet on the Western Front (2022), which won seven BAFTAs in 2023.
