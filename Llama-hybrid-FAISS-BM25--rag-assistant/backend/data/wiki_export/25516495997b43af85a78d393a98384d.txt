Reconstruction 

Somerville High School underwent extensive rebuilding in the late 2010s and early 2020s. Planning began in 2012, and voters passed a Proposition  override in 2016. Construction began in April 2018, displacing students. The original 1895 building was retained, as was the facade of the 1929 War Memorial. A new connected building opened to a small number of high-need students in various grades on March 4, 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Massachusetts. Construction on the auditorium and cosmetology lab was still in progress, and new athletic fields are expected to be complete by spring 2022. A new broadcast studio is shared with the city government, and the 750-person auditorium and a 100-person lecture hall will be available for community events. The new complex is  with capacity for 1,590 students.

Theater 
Highlander Theatre Company is Somerville High School's theater department. Highlander Theatre Company usually presents three to four productions per year: a musical, a full-length play a student-run fringe festival, and sometimes a touring festival play. Students participate as actors, crew, student directors, stage managers, and more. All sets, lights, and sound for productions are designed and operated by students. 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020-2021 season was changed to feature a full-length play, multiple 
works written and/or directed by students, and a one-act musical. Performances took place virtually, using both video conferencing technology and pre-recorded techniques. A modified four-show season would run for the 2021-2022 school year, signalling Highlander Theatre Company's return to in-person theatre.
