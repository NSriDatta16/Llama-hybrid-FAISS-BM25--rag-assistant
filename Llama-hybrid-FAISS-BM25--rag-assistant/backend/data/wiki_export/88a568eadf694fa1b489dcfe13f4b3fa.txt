"Peña de Arias Montano" Natural Monument 

Monumento Natural Peña de Arias Montano or Peña de Alájar is a natural monument of great historical and landscape value. The famous humanist Benito Arias Montano lived here, and the area was renamed after him so that nowadays it goes by the name of "Peña de Arias Montano." It offers incredible views of Alájar and everything south of the province of Huelva. Below is a network of caves among which is Palacio Osucro, a cave which currently remains closed.

 Reina de los Ángeles Hermitage 
The Ermita de la Reina de los Ángeles (Reina de los Ángeles Hermitage) or Ermita de Nuestra Señora de los Ángeles'' (Our lady of los Ángeles Hermitage) is located within la Peña de Alájar. This sixteenth-century chapel is a building consisting of heterogeneous aggregations to a small temple. It consists of a nave, priest and dressing room, in addition to a vestry, housing and enclosures. The nave, with strong deformations to the floor has two pointed transverse arches that spring from pillars.

Portada almohadillada 
It is located in front of the Hermitage. It consists of two semi-columns and an arc in addition to the spill nose tongs and some bursts of buttress walls. It lacks historical reference, however it has very clear affiliations within Renaissance architecture.

Espadaña y garitas 
Located at the edge of the plateau on which the Reina de los Ángeles Hermitage sits, in la Peña de Arias Montano is a picturesque steeple, accompanied by pilastered booth paths, circular and a penpal vault. The steeple has two levels: the bottom has a symmetrical composition with a base of six embedded semi-columns on each side framing a round arch, post-and-beam openings with square windows above and finally two massifs.

The columns on pedestals are independent and carry some terse chapiters. The upper floor is constituted by a parallelepipedal central bulk with a central oval window. Three bells and a picturesque bluff complete the work.
