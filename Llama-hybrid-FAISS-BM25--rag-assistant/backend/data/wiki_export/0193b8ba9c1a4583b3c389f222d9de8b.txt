Brent Hathaway Patterson (born April 9, 1963, in Hayward, California United States.) is a former American "Old School" bicycle motocross (BMX) racer.

Brent Patterson is the elder of what was the most potent sibling combinations that bicycle motocross has ever seen. With Brian, the Brothers Patterson are the only brothers to both hold the National No.1 Pro title in any major BMX sanctioning body; Brent in 1980 and Brian in 1982 and 1983 in the American Bicycle Association.

Racing career milestone

Note: Professional first are at the national level unless otherwise indicated.

Started Racing: Early 1976 at 14 years old in Hayward, California. He was exposed to it through his friends in his neighborhood.

First race result: First Place in 14 "Expert". However, at the time classes were determined by size and weight and not proficiency. Brent Patterson, being big for his age was placed with the experts.

First local win: See above. It was the beginning of a three race winning streak.

Sanctioning body: None, unaffiliated track.

Home sanctioning body district(s): National Bicycle Association (NBA) District "N" (Northern California);

First sponsor: Cyclepath 1976 

First National win:

Turned Pro: Late 1977 aged 16.

First Pro race result**: First place at the National Bicycle Association (NBA) Arizona State Fair race in Phoenix, Arizona on November 6, 1977.

First Pro win**: See above.

Height & weight at height of his career (1981–1984): Ht:6'1" Wt:~200 lbs.

Retired from the senior pro* circuit: Mid 1986, 25 years old. As is usual, many former top pro BMXers do not retire completely but race for fun or if there is a particularly large pro purse, such as the 1987 NBL World Cup. Brian and Brent occasionally raced in several large races for both reasons in 1987, but their days of seriously contending for No.1 racer title in any sanctioning body were over. Brent retired fully from BMX after not making the main at the World Cup and concentrated on Motorcycle Motocross. Patterson Racing Products went out of business in the summer of 1986 due to production problems.

*In the NBL "A" Pro/Elite; in the ABA "AA" Pro.
**At the time there was no separate pro class for pros due to the relatively small number of pros. They raced with the 16 Experts, making it a Pro/Am class essentially. This is why during the early years of the pro division the national number one racer of a sanctioning body could be either an amateur or professional. This practice continued until the NBA's 1979 season in which the pros earned separate pro points and a separate pro plate from the amateurs. The NBL and ABA followed suit a year later.

Career factory and major bicycle shop sponsors

Note: This listing only denotes the racer's primary sponsors. At any given time a racer could have numerous co-sponsors. Primary sponsorships can be verified by BMX press coverage and sponsor's advertisements at the time in question. When possible exact dates are given.

Amateur
Cyclepath: 1976
AAA Restaurant Fire Control/Champion: 1976
Speedo Racing Products: October 1976-October 1977.
Patterson Racing Products: Early November 1977 – 1986. Brent and Brian would turn pro with Patterson Racing. Detailed below.

Professional
Patterson Racing Products: Early November 1977 – 1986. This was the family owned BMX bicycle firm started by their father Vance Patterson in late 1977 after Speedo, who Vance Patterson had invested in, showed no signs of progress toward developing a BMX racing frame, the original reason why Vance Patterson invested in the first place. It was his and his brothers only factory sponsor in their Senior pro careers (discounting AAA Fire Control.). That Speedo team, despite getting offers from other firms to join their factory teams, they opted to stay together and the original Patterson team of Brian, Brent, Kevin Riding, John Crews, and Mike Koron was formed. Vance Patterson started Patterson racing also in part to fulfill his original intent with Speedo to come out with a BMX bicycle frame and signed up the ex Speedo Team and added Richie Anderson to it. Richie would virtually become part of the Patterson family and stay with Patterson for many years, much longer than the average stay a top amateur would stay with one team. In contrast, Richie Anderson would not stay long with any one sponsor after Patterson Racing.

Notable accolades
Named Rookie of the Year by Bicycle Motocross News for 1977. Also named number one of the five best riders in Northern California
Brent won Bicycle Motocross Actions Number One Racer Award (NORA) for 1980.* He received 433 out of 1622 votes cast or 26.7% of the vote. He also won US$500
He was the first to win a National No.1 plate, amateur or professional, three consecutive times and to do so consecutively in any sanctioning body (Pro cruiser 1981,'82,'83 ABA).
Brent Patterson is a 1988 ABA BMX Hall of fame inductee.*In the early years of the NORA cup the year the balloting was done and tallied was the year it was considered awarded. In 1983 it was switched to when the winner of the cup was presented to the public in BMX Action magazine of the following year (usually in the February or March issue) it was considered awarded and not during the closing months of the previous year when the voting and tally takes place. This was done to give the rider (and the winners of No.1 bicycle and No.1 Factory Team) maximum publicity and advantage financially. Therefore, under the new system Brent Patterson was awarded NORA in 1981.
