Ownership
In the 1990s, the building was owned by Tang Shing-bor (), a major property investor in Mong Kok. Alpha Investment Partners, the property investment fund of Keppel Land of Singapore, bought it for HK$750 million in January 2007.

Strikes by tenants
In February 2009, shop operators and tenants went on strikes to demand a rent cut during the economic downturn. Another strike occurred in April 2009, over complaints that computer festival bargains were cutting into their sales.
