The 1949 NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Tournament was the culmination of the 1948â€“49 NCAA men's ice hockey season, the 2nd such tournament in NCAA history. It was held between March 17 and 19, 1949, and concluded with Boston College defeating Dartmouth 4-3. All games were played at the Broadmoor Ice Palace in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

This is the first time that a consolation game was played in an NCAA tournament. The practice would continue unabated until it was abolished after the 1989 tournament.

All four teams selected for the tournament had played in the championship the previous season. This has only occurred one other time, in 1975, counting either all tournament entries or only the final four teams. (as of 2016)
