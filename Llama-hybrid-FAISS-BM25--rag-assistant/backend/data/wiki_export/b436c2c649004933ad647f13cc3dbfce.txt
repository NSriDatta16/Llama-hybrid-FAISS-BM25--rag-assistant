Many political parties were founded in the Ottoman Empire after the Young Turk Revolution. Most did not compete in elections, instead being splinters of previously existing parties. Ethnic and Islamist parties were officially banned after 1909, though Armenian political parties remained legal until 1915. While the Second Constitutional Era basically ended after 1912, new parties were founded during the Armistice Era and up until the end of the Ottoman monarchy.

Parties

Second Constitutional Era parties (1908–1912) 

 Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) – İttihad ve Terakki Cemiyeti/Fırkası (İTC/F). Originally a secret revolutionary organization and later a party by 1909, it organized the Young Turk Revolution which began the Second Constitutional Era. The most powerful Young Turk faction before and after the revolution, it espoused centralism as the way to achieve Ottomanism. Following the revolution, it came under the control of Turkish nationalists such as Mehmed Talat, İsmail Enver, Ziya Gökalp, and Mehmed Nazım. The Unionists took control of the government after 1913 and led the Ottoman Empire into World War I during which it masterminded genocides targeting the Christian Millets. Hüseyin Hilmi, İbrahim Hakkı, Mehmed Said, Said Halim, Talat, and Ahmet İzzet were Grand Viziers associated with the CUP. It was dissolved by its own members in the aftermath of the war in 1918.
  – Teşebbüs-i Şahsi ve Adem-i Merkeziyet Cemiyeti. Led by Mehmed Sabahaddin, it was the primary opposition to the CUP before and immediately after the revolution. It was succeeded by a political party: the Liberty Party. It espoused decentralization to achieve Ottomanism.
Liberty Party – Osmanlı Ahrar Fırkası. A successor to the Private Enterprise and Decentralization Association, it served as an organized political party for the decentralists to compete in the 1908 general election. Though the party was not successful in the  election, it managed to form a large parliamentary group by courting dissatisfied CUP MPs as well as Grand Vizier Kâmil Pasha. It was accused of collaborating with the 31 March incident and dissolved in 1910.
 – Osmanlı Demokrat Fırkası or Fırka-i İbad. It was founded in 1909 by two Old Unionists: Ibrahim Temo, and Abdullah Cevdet, and merged with the Freedom and Accord Party in 1911.
 – Fedakâran-ı Millet Cemiyeti. It was founded in 1908 and closed in 1909.
 – Heyet-i Müttefika-i Osmaniye. A short lived party that was founded in 1909 or 1910.

 – İslahat-ı Esasiye-ı Osmaniye Fırkası. Şerif Pasha's party. It was founded in 1909 and merged with the Freedom and Accord Party in 1913.
 – Mutedil Hürriyetperveran Fırkası. Formed in 1909, many liberals joined the party following the ban on the Liberty Party. It merged with the Freedom and Accord Party in 1911.
Ottoman Socialist Party – Osmanlı Sosyalist Fırkası (OSF). An Ottomanist socialist party that was founded by Hüseyin Hilmi the Socialist in 1910. It was banned when the CUP repressed all other parties in 1913.
 People's Party – Ahali Fırkası. Formed in 1910 by Gümülcineli İsmail, it merged with the Freedom and Accord Party in 1911.
Socialist Workers' Federation – Sosyalist İşçi Federasyonu. Both a political party and labour organization with roots in Salonica that was founded in 1909. The Federation claimed that it was not a "nationalist" socialist party, like Dashnak and Hunchak, though it held close ties to IMRO. It represented Turkey in the Second International and continued its existence in Greece following Salonica's capture in the First Balkan War.
 – Hizb-i Cedid. A right-wing splinter of the CUP, that was briefly the main opposition party, it merged with the Freedom and Accord Party in 1911.
Progress Party – Hizb-i Terakki. A left-wing splinter of the CUP,  it merged with the Freedom and Accord Party in 1911.
Freedom and Accord Party – Hürriyet ve İtilaf Fırkası (HİF). Formed to contest the 1912 general election, in addition to its decentralist current, most opposition parties merged with it to oppose the CUP. Following the CUP's rigging of the election, there was eventually an Accordist government with the return of Kâmil Pasha, who was overthrown in a CUP coup in 1913, following which the party was suppressed until the Armistice of Mudros, when its leaders were rehabilitated. Under its Grand Vizier Damat Ferid Pasha, the party cracked down on the Unionists and the Turkish nationalist movement led by Mustafa Kemal (Atatürk), and advocated a pro-British alignment to get more lenient peace terms from the Allies. The chaotic politics of the Turkish War of Independence served to divide the party until it was again effectively defunct by the end of 1919. It boycotted the 1919 general election.
 – Millî Meşrutiyet Fırkası. It was formed in 1912 as a pan-Turkist party that both the CUP and Freedom and Accord opposed, and was closed a few years later.
The 1913 coup d'état and the aftermath of Mahmud Shevket Pasha's assassination meant the CUP took full control over Ottoman politics, effectively suspending the constitution and suppressing all opposition parties. No political parties were founded between 1912 and 1918.
