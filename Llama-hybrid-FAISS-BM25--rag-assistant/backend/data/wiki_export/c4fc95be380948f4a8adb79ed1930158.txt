Career
Bergvold started playing football with small clubs Rødovre Boldklub and Boldklubben Avarta. He moved to Kjøbenhavns Boldklub (KB), the reserve team of FC Copenhagen of the top-flight Danish Superliga. Bergvold played for various Danish national teams, regularly featuring as team captain, and he won the 2000 Danish Under-17 Player of the Year award.

He made his senior debut for Copenhagen in December 2002, and was a member of the squad which won the 2002–03 Superliga championship. He scored his first goal for the club in March 2004, as the club repeated the championship win in the 2003–04 Superliga season. He also scored in the 2004 Danish Cup tournament, though he did not play the cup final, which Copenhagen won 1–0 against AaB. Bergvold played 22 of Copenhagen's 33 games in the 2005–06 Superliga season, which the club went on to win, and he was selected to represent the Danish under-21 national team at the 2006 European Under-21 Championship in May 2006. He played in all Denmark's three matches before elimination.
