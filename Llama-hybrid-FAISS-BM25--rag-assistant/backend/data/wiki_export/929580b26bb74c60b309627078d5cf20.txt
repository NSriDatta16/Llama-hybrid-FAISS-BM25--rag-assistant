Hothfield  is a village and civil parish in the Ashford Borough of Kent, England and is  3 miles north-west of Ashford on the A20. It is completely split in two by Hothfield Common.

Etymology
In Kent and East Sussex the Old English term hǣð, which became heath in Modern English, was replaced by an unmutated form, hāð, which, over time, evolved into hoath. The village's name is therefore the old local dialect form of Heathfield.

Geography
In the north west is Hothfield Common, 58 hectares (143 acres) of heathland and lowland valley bogs: a nature reserve managed by Kent Wildlife Trust,

To the immediate south is the private parkland of the former Hothfield House. This area is crossed by the Greensand Way passing the church en route to  Godinton House. A small part of the neighbourhood of Ram Lane is in the far northern point of the civil parish. Small tributaries of the West Stour rise in the parish.
