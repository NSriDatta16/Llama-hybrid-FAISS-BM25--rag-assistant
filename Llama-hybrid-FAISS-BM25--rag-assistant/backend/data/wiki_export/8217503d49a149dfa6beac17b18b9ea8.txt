Næstved Boldklub is a Danish association football team based in Næstved in the South of Zealand. Næstved Boldklub is the professional superstructure of the parent club Næstved Idræts Forening (Næstved IF) and currently plays in the Danish 1st Division, the second tier of Danish football league system.

The team's regular colours have been green and white throughout the club's history. It plays its home games at TintShop Park. The main rivals are Nykøbing FC (former B1901) and Slagelse B&I. Other rivals are Herfølge Boldklub and Køge Boldklub (the two clubs now merged to HB Køge).

Formerly a regular team in the top half of the Danish Superliga, Næstved has been tempting fate in the second and third tier since after the relegation. Since then Næstved Boldklub have been struggling financially which have been a factor in the club's struggles limiting and sometimes banning the club from signing contracts with players, however the club have recently had a lot of success and is now a top contender in the Danish 1st Division.

History
Næstved Idræts Forening (Næstved IF) was formed in 1939 as a union of Næstved Idræts Klub and Næstved Boldklub the latter which had already played a season in the Mesterskabs-serien (then the best league in Denmark). During the Second World War the Danish football leagues were replaced by geographical divisions. With the beginning of the 1945–1946 season the football pyramid was reestablished with Næstved being placed in the 3rd Division.
In 1970 Næstved won promotion to the 2nd Division finishing third the following season to secure promotion to the 1st Division (the then top division in Denmark). Again Næstved finished third in their first season after promotion winning bronze medal in 1972.

After the club's three mostly successful decades from the 1970s until the 1990s, including two time runner-up in the league (1980 in front of an all time capacity record of 20,315 spectators at Næstved Stadion and again in 1988), the club was relegated following the 1995–1996 season after finishing last.

In 1996 Næstved Boldklub became the professional superstructure of the parent club Næstved Idræts Forening (Næstved IF).

In 2000 Næstved was relegated to the 2nd Division (third tier in Danish football league structure) for the first time since 1963. Enduring financial trouble the club was then several times just about to be relegated to Danmarks Serien (non-league), and if that would have happened, it would be the first time ever for Næstved not to be in one of the three best divisions of Denmark.

The team were promoted to the 1st division and participated in NordicBetLiga season 2018/2019.
During the season Næstved was in the battle for a promotional spot, but in the last round of the season it was decided that Lyngby took 3rd place in front of Næstved, who finished 4th.

During the Summer of 2019 and as preparation for the 2019/20 season, Næstved sacked manager Michael Hemmingsen.
