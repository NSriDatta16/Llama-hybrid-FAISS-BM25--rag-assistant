Disposable Arts is the second solo and fourth overall studio album by American rapper Masta Ace. It was released on October 16, 2001 via JCOR Entertainment. Production was handled by Domingo, Luis Tineo, Xplicit, Ayatollah, Deacon the Villain, DJ 3D, DJ A. Vee, DJ Rob, Gerrard C. Baker, Koolade, Paul Nice, Rodney Hunter and Ace himself. It features guest appearances from eMC, MC Paul Barman, Jane Doe, Mr. Lee G, Apocalypse, Greg Nice, Jean Grae, J-Ro, King Tee, Leschea, Rah Digga, Young Zee and Tonedeff.

The concept of the album follows a young Brooklyn man's release from prison, his return home, and his life at "The Institute of Disposable Arts", a school in which Ace enrolls after realizing how bad the situation in Brooklyn is.

The album sold poorly compared to his previous albums, due to JCOR Entertainment folding a month after its release but it was generally well received by critics and fans alike. The cover art is an ironic nod to his "Sittin' on Chrome" days, showing Masta Ace sitting on a car seat in the street without a car. Included on the album is the song "Acknowledge", a notable diss track to rapper Boogeyman and group The High & Mighty. The song "Unfriendly Game" was used in the TV series The Wire and is included on one of its soundtracks. The song "Take A Walk" was used in the video game Saints Row, and was found on one of the various in game radio stations.

In 2013, D. Aurelius directed a documentary video of making the album, starring Ace, Rah Digga and Justin Hunte.
