Basta (Enough!/Das genügt!) is an album that was released by Quilapayún in 1969. It brings together popular and folk songs from Latin America, the former USSR, and Italy. This album included "La muralla"/The wall - one of the most popular folk songs in Latin America - based on the text of a poem by the Cuban poet Nicolás Guillén.

The vocal arrangements reach their peak in “Bella Ciao”, “Por montañas y praderas” and “Patrón.”  This album – as X Vietnam - shows the internationalism of Nueva Cancion Chilena/ New Chilean Song.
