Andy Park started his professional career as a comic book artist at Extreme Studios, a division of Image Comics. He penciled both interior work as well as cover work for several titles, most notably, "Avengelyne" and Glory/Angela: Angels in Hell. Park took a hiatus from comic books to study Illustration at Art Center College of Design.  In 1999, he returned to comic books to illustrate the new "Tomb Raider (comics)" comic book series written by Dan Jurgens and published by Top Cow Productions and was noted as one of the top 10 artists in the industry by Wizard Magazine.  Tomb Raider #1 was the highest selling comic book of 1999.  After issue #20 Andy began working at Marvel Comics as a cover artist and interior artist on titles such as Excalibur, "Weapon X", "New X-Men", Mutopia X, and "Uncanny X-Men".

Besides comic book work, Andy has also contributed interior as well as cover illustrations to several magazines including Maxim, Flex, PSM, Wizard, "Muscle & Fitness", "2D Artist Magazine", "Advanced Photoshop", "Imagine FX", "Game Informer", and many others.  He has also illustrated covers for various other comic book companies including DC Comics such as Superman Confidential, WildCats, The Authority, and God of War.

In 2005, Andy started working as a concept artist for Santa Monica Studio, a division of Sony Computer Entertainment.  He designed characters, creatures, props, and environments for the award-winning video games, God of War II, God of War: Chains of Olympus, StarHawk, and God of War III.

GameStop had a pre-order incentive of a 17X24 poster of Kratos signed by Andy Park.  He also illustrated the cover to the European release of the God of War Trilogy, coinciding with the release of the third game.  He was featured in several print and video interviews to help promote the game.

In 2010, Andy joined the Visual Development team at Marvel Studios to help develop the look and feel of its movies designing characters, costumes, and key frames for its cinematic universe.
