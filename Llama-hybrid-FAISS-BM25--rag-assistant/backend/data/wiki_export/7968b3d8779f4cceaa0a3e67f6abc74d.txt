Morning Dove White is the only studio album by Scottish electronic music group One Dove. It was originally released on Boy's Own Productions in 1993. The group primarily co-produced the album with Andrew Weatherall, with Stephen Hague later being recruited to assist with additional production and remixing.

Morning Dove White peaked at number 30 on the UK Albums Chart. The album includes three singles which appeared on the UK Singles Chart: "White Love" (No. 43), "Breakdown" (No. 24), and "Why Don't You Take Me" (No. 30).

Critical reception

Reviewing Morning Dove White in 1993, Rupert Howe of Select found that One Dove's more developed songwriting set them apart from their peers in the house music scene: "Stripped of their backing, these songs are the stuff you end up humming in the bath, with melodies that linger in the mind rather than passing through it". Frank Owen of Vibe described the group as "the best and brightest hope of the U.K. rave scene, providing a needed dose of individual glamor and pop perfection in a community that, until recently, shunned such things". NME critic Stephen Dalton was less receptive, finding that the record suffered by comparison to Weatherall's work on Primal Scream's Screamadelica (1991), despite appraising One Dove as "potentially the best post-rave pop act in Britain". The Village Voices Robert Christgau dismissed the album apart from the track "White Love (Guitar Paradise Mix)", which he named a "choice cut".

In a retrospective review, Ned Raggett of AllMusic wrote that "Dot Allison's singing, informed with everything from Siouxsie Sioux's cool clip to Dolly Parton's rich passion ... is simply marvelous, while the blend of influences in the musicians' work ranges as well from dub's deep echo to epic metal noise." In 2017, Mixmag included the album on its list of "10 Slept-On Albums That Should Have Been Absolutely Huge". Joe Muggs wrote, "The music of Glaswegian trio Allison, Ian Carmichael and Jim McKinven was the ultimate expression of the bittersweet collapse of the comedown, and was a morning-after staple for those who knew."
