History

Archeological findings suggest that the first settlers lived here over 1800 years ago when the Romans occupied the Rhineland.

The limes ran between Bad Hönningen and Rheinbrohl, opposite the Vinxtbach, the border between Germania Inferior and Superior. At this point the limes crossed the Rhine and continued on the eastern bank. On this site a small castellum was built. In 1972 a Roman watchtower was reconstructed from archeological finds.

In 1019, the town was documentary mentioned as "Besitztum Hohingen" for the first time.

During Thirty Years' War in 1632 Bad Hönningen burned down except twelve houses.

The first bathhouse for medical treatment opened in 1895.
Because of this, the town is legitimated to have the title "Bad" since 1950.

On July 12, 1969, it was granted the privileges of a town.
