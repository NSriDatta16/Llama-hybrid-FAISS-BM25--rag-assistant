Olav Økern (3 June 1911 – 11 April 2000) was a Norwegian cross-country skier who competed in the 1930s and 1940s. He won a bronze in the 4 × 10 km relay at the 1948 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz.

In addition, he won a silver in the 4 × 10 km relay at the 1938 FIS Nordic World Ski Championships and the 18 km event at the 1940 Holmenkollen ski festival. Because of those wins, Økern earned the Holmenkollen medal in 1950. His uncle, Harald Økern, had earned the same medal in 1924.
