Ben Leber (born December 7, 1978) is a retired American football linebacker in the National Football League (NFL). He was drafted by the San Diego Chargers in the third round of the 2002 NFL Draft and later played for the Minnesota Vikings.

Early years
Lining up primarily at running back, Leber was named to several high school All-America teams at Vermillion High School in Vermillion, South Dakota. As a junior, he rushed for 1,404 yards and 18 touchdowns, and notched 1,350 yards in his senior year.  That season, he was declared a Parade Magazine All-America (the only South Dakotan so honored in 1997), an honorable mention All-USA by USA Today, and was selected to play in the North-South Dakota All-Star game. An excellent student, he was also an Academic All-State selection.

College career
At Kansas State, Leber made the switch to full-time linebacker.  A two-time All-Big 12 selection, he finished his college career with 216 tackles, 46 tackles for loss, and 13.5 sacks.  His 216 career tackles were the fifth most in Kansas State history.  As a junior, he earned second-team all-conference honors.  The year later, he was an All-America third-team selection by the Associated Press, a consensus All-Big 12 Conference first-team choice, and a team captain.  He received a degree in business-general management in 2002.

Professional career

San Diego Chargers
Leber was drafted by the San Diego Chargers in the third round of the 2002 NFL Draft.  He was an immediate-impact rookie, playing in all 16 games and starting 14 of them.  He was selected to both the Pro Football Weekly and Football Digest All-Rookie teams, finishing the year with 49 tackles, 5 sacks (third on the team), and 3 forced fumbles (first on the team).

In his second season, Leber started every game at strong side linebacker for the Chargers, notching 75 tackles, 3 sacks, 1 pass defensed, and 1 forced fumble.  In his third year, he was an every-game starter for the Chargers, finishing the season with 58 tackles, 2 sacks, and 1 fumble recovery.  The next season, Leber was injured during training camp and again during the season.  This led to him losing his starting position to future Pro-Bowler Shawne Merriman.
