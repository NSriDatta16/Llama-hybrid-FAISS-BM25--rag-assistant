History

1999-2001 
In the Fall of 1999 singer-songwriter Andrew Connor and drummer Richard Gintowt met while at a concert. This led to the University of Kansas students playing together at Hashinger Hall, The Bottleneck, and eventually to the creation of Ghosty. In the Fall of 2000 bassist Mark Hurst joined the band, making it a threesome, but Hurst only lasted until December. In the Spring of 2001 Connor and Gintowt were joined by Jacob Baum on the bass and won the critic's vote at the annual KJHK Farmer's Ball. Later that year Ghosty began its first tour in support of the "Five Short Minutes EP." Sondre Lerche described their debut as “U.S., nineties, guitar-based alt-rock Prefab Sprout.”

2002-2005 
Ghosty began recording their first full-length album Grow Up or Sleep In in August 2002 at Presto! in Lincoln, Nebraska with producer Mike Mogis. After a year of school and performing they went to Bell Labs in Norman, Oklahoma to work with Trent Bell to finish the album. While in the studios they provided backing vocals, sleighbells, acoustic guitar, bass, and keyboards on the Flaming Lips' "Ego Tripping at the Gates of Hell." In return Flaming Lips lead singer Wayne Coyne lent his vocals to their album. "Grow Up or Sleep In" was released by Future Farmer Records in 2005.
