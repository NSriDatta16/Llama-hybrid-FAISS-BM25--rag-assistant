Kuban Stadium () is a multi-purpose stadium in Krasnodar, Russia. It is used mostly for football matches and is the home stadium of PFC Kuban Krasnodar, as well as the now-amateur FC Kuban Krasnodar. The stadium holds 35,200 people. 

First opened on 30 October 1960, it initially had a capacity of approximately 20,000 people. The first match was played on 14 May 1961, when FC Kuban Krasnodar (then called Spartak Krasnodar) played PFC Dynamo Stavropol (then called Spartak Stavropol). 

The capacity was later doubled with the building of a second floor, which is when floodlights were also installed.
