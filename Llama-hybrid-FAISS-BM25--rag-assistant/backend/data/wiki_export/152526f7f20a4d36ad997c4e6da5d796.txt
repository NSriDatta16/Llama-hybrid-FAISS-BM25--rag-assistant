The Fox is the name of two fictional superheroes that appear in periodicals published by MLJ Comics and later Dark Circle Comics.

Publication history
The first Fox (Paul Patten) debuted in MLJ Comic's Blue Ribbon Comics  #4 (June 1940), in a story written by Joe Blair and drawn by Irwin Hasen. He appeared in that title until the series ended with issue #22 (March 1942).

He later made a guest appearance in Mighty Crusaders #4 (April 1966), as part of a crowd scene featuring nearly every superhero published by MLJ (the story, somewhat ironically, was titled "Too Many Super Heroes!"). He returned in issue #5, where he forms a team called the Ultra-Men with heroes Captain Flag and the Web.  This was the sole appearance of that group.  Some of the Fox stories from this period were written and illustrated by Alex Toth. The first Fox's final appearance was in Black Hood #3 (Oct. 1983).

The second Fox debuted in Blue Ribbon Comics vol. 2, #6 (March 1984). The Fox appeared in several issues of Blue Ribbon during the mid-1980s.  He also appeared in issues 9 and 11-13 of Mighty Crusaders as a member of that superhero team.  His final appearance was in Mighty Crusaders vol. 2, #13 (Sept. 1985).

In October 2013, Archie Comics released The Fox under its Red Circle Comics imprint as a five issue mini-series which ended in March 2014. The series was written by Dean Haspiel and Mark Waid, with art by Haspiel; backup Shield stories were by J.M. DeMatteis, Mike Cavallaro, and Terry Austin. The mini-series was later collected into trade paperback in July 2014 under the name The Fox: Freak Magnet. 

The Fox returned in another five-issue series in April 2015 under the relaunched Dark Circle Comics imprint. Volume 2 had the same creative team from the mini-series.

The Fox will return in a one-shot titled Family Values which will be released in June 2022.

Fictional character biography
The Fox is secretly Paul Patten, a young news reporter and photographer for The Daily Globe, and a former athlete at Penn State University. He has a camera that attaches to his belt. His editor and girlfriend is named Ruth Ransom.  Patton's main reason for becoming the Fox was to further his career. As a crimefighter, he is the first on the scene with his camera. His first mission pitted himself against the hooded Night Riders, a stand-in for the Ku Klux Klan.

Whenever dangerous situations arise, Patton quickly changes into his costume, which consists of a black, skin-tight body suit, complete with pointed ears and (in some adventures) a golden fox head logo on his chest. Ron Goulart says, "It took Hasen a couple of issues to realize a hero's costume is a fantasy thing that doesn't have wrinkles or baggy knees."

Although the transformations from photographer to superhero are never illustrated (artists favored a simple panel with the caption "Paul Patton becomes the Fox!"), it is assumed that the costume is worn under Paul's street clothes.

Powers and abilities 
The Fox has no superpowers, but is a highly trained athlete.

Dark Circle Comics
Paul Patton is revealed to have been the original Fox who later passed down the identity to his son, Paul Patton Jr.

DC Comics 
In the wake of the continuity altering "Final Crisis" company-wide crossover, DC Comics licensed rights to the Red Circle and Milestone Media heroes, choosing to bring them into DC Universe continuity. It was announced that in March 2010, the Fox would appear in a back-up feature in the Shield comic book series, written by Brandon Jerwa and with art from Michael Avon Oeming.
