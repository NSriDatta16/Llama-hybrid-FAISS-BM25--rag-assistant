Flying Cloud Airport  is a public airport located in the city of Eden Prairie in Hennepin County, Minnesota, United States, about 11 miles (18 km) southwest of the central business district (CBD) of Minneapolis.

History 
The airport was created in 1941 when the United States Navy was training pilots for World War II.  The Navy made arrangements with a local farmer, Martin "Pappy" Grill, to use a grass landing strip.  Pilots flying from Wold-Chamberlain Field, now Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, would use this field for practicing approaches.  After the war, Grill sold the field and some adjoining land to American Aviation, Inc.  John Stuber named the field "Flying Cloud Airport" to reflect local Indian lore and flying.  The Metropolitan Airports Commission bought the airport in 1948 and paved the runway. The MAC built a control tower in 1963.  By 1966, it was ranked the second-busiest airport in the central United States, behind Chicago-O'Hare International Airport.  In 1968, with 446,198 takeoffs and landings, it was the ninth-busiest airport in the United States.  Today it is designated by the FAA as a reliever airport and aircraft are restricted to  or less, except in an emergency situation or when operated by the U.S. Government.

Because of the airport's proximity to the Valleyfair amusement park, the park's rides are restricted in height by FAA regulations.

In 2020 the airport received a $157,000 CARES Act award.
