The Yarrangobilly Caves are located in a  karst region along the Yarrangobilly River valley in the north of Kosciuszko National Park, New South Wales, Australia.
Discovered to British colonists by a cattleman, the Yarrangobilly Caves system includes several independent limestone caves formed over different time periods, from several million to a few hundred thousand years old. The older examples are in higher strata and have more speleothem decoration.

The caves are administered by the National Parks and Wildlife Service. Three lit show caves are regularly open to visitors, two for guided tours and the third for a self-guided tour. The caves complex also includes a  and up to   thermal pool, fed by natural warm-water springs, and a number of walking tracks.

History

The cave was formed in 440-million-year-old limestone, and was first discovered by Europeans in 1834 when a stockman John Bowman came across the complex.

Leo James Hoad was associated with the caves from 1904â€“1950, serving as the official caretaker of the caves from 1919 to 1946. He discovered the Jillabenan Cave in 1910.

The largest building on the site is Caves House, built in 1901 when the caves were the most popular resort in New South Wales. It can be booked as accommodation for groups of visitors.
