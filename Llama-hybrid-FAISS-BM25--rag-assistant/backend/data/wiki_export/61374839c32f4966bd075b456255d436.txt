The station was rebuilt slightly south of the original with two platforms in 1907, when the Great Western Railway doubled and upgraded this part of the branch line to main line standards, in order to incorporate it into the North Warwickshire Line, which created a new main line route between Birmingham and Cheltenham Spa.
