The Canadian Mining Hall of Fame was conceived by Maurice R. Brown as a way to honor Canada's mine finders and builders, in recognition of accomplishments by leaders in the Canadian mining industry.

The Hall was established in 1988; in 2023 it had 203 members.

The Hall has five physical locations.

The University of Toronto hosts the original Hall on the ground floor of the historic Mining Building on campus. The Hall contains plaques of polished Canadian granite with photos and descriptions of the Members from 1989-2008.
