The Little David Years (1971–1977) is a box set by American comedian George Carlin. It consists of his six albums recorded with the Little David record label, with an additional CD of previously unreleased bonus material, including "The Coney Island recordings"; a recording he made as a child. This seven-disc set was released on October 19, 1999, on the Atlantic Records label.

Production 

In December 1999, Carlin discussed the boxset with Scott Simon of NPR:

Scott Simon: To listen to these CDs is to understand what changed in you, the process that you went through.
George Carlin: Well, that would exclude any further growth. Uh, there has been considerable further growth since 1977.

Simon and Carlin then went on to discuss the final disc in the set: Free Complimentary Extra Bonus Disc Not for Sale Anywhere!

Carlin: There is a twentieth cut that isn't listed. The nineteenth cut is the last one listed. And down in number twenty—and this happened because of a mistake in indexing when we made this box set—these are tapes I made when I was twelve years old in little booths.
Simon: I'm embarrassed to say I didn't listen to it because I thought it was over at nineteen.
Carlin: And you would be right and I don't know how I'm going to explain this to the consumer... administration or whoever they are.
Simon: Well take a second now.
Carlin: Well what happened is before tape recorders were common, you would go to a booth in an amusement park or something and put a quarter in and for a minute you could record your voice. It used to say "Record your voice, send a letter to your loved one in the service" or something and I used to go in there and do my little routines, my childhood routines. Imitating newsmen, imitating sports announcers, imitating commercials on radio and TV. So when I was twelve years old, I made about eight of these and we've included them in the box set.
