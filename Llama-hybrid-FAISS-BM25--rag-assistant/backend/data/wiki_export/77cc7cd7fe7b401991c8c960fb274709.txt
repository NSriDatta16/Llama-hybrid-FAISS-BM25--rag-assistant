The press release declares it a voluntary transfer of power but, behind the curtains, the transfer letter had actually been wrung from the ambitious Mirza on gun point, by the 3 military members of Ayub's cabinet. General Ayub Khan, who was nominated Prime Minister by President Mirza on 24th, has taken the oath today. He has also announced his cabinet: three military officials including Lt General Azam Khan, and eight civilians including Md. Hafizur Rahman, A. K. Khan, Muhammad Ibrahim and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.

Last year's census shows that 51% of total output in large scale manufacturing is controlled by only 6% of the business houses in the country. This may be considered a result of the laissez-fair, private sector-led economy that the government has been encouraging since 1947.
An unequal rate of growth between the two wings of the country seems to have been an important feature of economic development since the independence: only one-fifth of large-scale manufacturing is located in East Pakistan

In a spree of purging the society of unwanted elements, the army regime has shortlisted 1,661 allegedly corrupt officials

The military regime has arrested Ahmad Nadeem Qasmi, Sibt-e-Hasan and Faiz Ahmad Faiz, the editors of Lail-o-Nihar, Imroze and Pakistan Times respectively. All journals belong to Progressive Papers Ltd, whose major shareholder is Mian Iftikharuddin, the veteran leftist leader
