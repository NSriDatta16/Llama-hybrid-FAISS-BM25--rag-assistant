His book, The Year I was Peter the Great, was published on October 10, 2017. Most recently, his book Enemy of the People: Trump's War on the Press, the New McCarthyism, and the Threat to American Democracy, was published by the Brookings Institution Press in 2018.His latest book is 'Assignment Russia' (2021) also published by Brookings.

He was a news analyst for Fox News, and is a contributor to National Public Radio and America Abroad. He is currently a senior adviser at the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.

Haunting Legacy
In Haunting Legacy: Vietnam and the American Presidency from Ford to Obama (Brookings Institution Press 2011), Marvin Kalb collaborated with his daughter, Deborah Kalb, in an attempt to present a history of presidential decision-making on one crucial issue: in light of the Vietnam debacle, under what circumstances should the United States go to war? The Kalbs participated in a webcast interview of the book at the Pritzker Military Library on October 27, 2011.

Trivia
Kalb's colleagues at NBC had a running joke involving an NBC affiliate in Alexandria, Louisiana – KALB-TV, referring to that affiliate as "Marvin's Station". At one point, Today co-host Bryant Gumbel, in a co-op promo for the station's upcoming feature about Today in 1985, identified the station as KALB, smiled into the camera, and then intoned, "Marvin's Station" at which point the off-camera crew broke up.

Former Fox News political commentator Bill O'Reilly was one of Kalb's students.
