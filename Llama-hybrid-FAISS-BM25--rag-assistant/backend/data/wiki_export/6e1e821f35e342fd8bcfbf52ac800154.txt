Since then he has commanded the 366th Division and the Judea and Samaria Division, where he led the Campaign against Palestinian political violence. He was promoted to head of Israeli Operations Directorate in June 2005. After the conclusions exercise "joining of forces" Eizenkot led the formulation of the concept on which the IDF must severely damage the center of gravity of Hezbollah, the Dahiya neighborhood, as a key component for creating deterrence against Hezbollah. 

After Maj. Gen. Udi Adam resigned in October 2006 amid criticism over his conduct in the 2006 Lebanon War, Eizenkot replaced him as head of the Northern Command. In his years as the head of the Northern Command he emphasizes the training of forces, strengthening the capacities of command and creating an appropriate operational response to threats from Hezbollah and Syria.

Chief of Staff of the IDF 

Eizenkot took office on 16 February 2015.

In addition he emphasizes the training of forces regarding the threat of tunnels. Eizenkot ordered the implementation of the multi-year plan "Gideon" that was formed under his direction. "Gideon" was presented in July 2015 and it was approved by the cabinet in April 2016. The plan involves a variety of issues which such as force buildup to a range of threats, strengthening and developing the IDF's maneuvering capabilities, eliminating redundant arrays and the constructing a cyber command. At the heart of multi-year plan stands "The IDF Strategy".

An essential element relates to the purpose of ending the conflict in the shortest time. "The IDF Strategy" attempts to achieve this response by changing the pattern of the use of force utilizing an immediate and simultaneous attack that combines maneuver and fire. "The IDF Strategy" also includes the strategic concept of campaigns between the wars (CBW), in which the IDF operate covertly in order to preserve and enhance the achievements of the previous campaigns, to weaken the enemy and to postpone the next conflict. 
In August 2016 Eizenkot was awarded with the Commander of the Legion of Merit by general Joseph Dunford. The award was given due to Eizenkot's "exceptionally meritorious service as chief of the General Staff of the IDF" and his "contribution to the strategic cooperation between the United States and Israel will have a lasting effect on both countries".

Political views
Eisenkot believes in a country whose vision reflects national-Jewish values. At the same time, he believes that the state must maintain equal rights for all its citizens regardless of religion, nationality, race and gender. 

Eisenkot believes in separating from the Palestinians (to a two state solution) in order to avoid a bi-national state and to maintain a Jewish-democratic state, with permanent conservation of the Jordan Valley and the settlement blocs. In the Gaza Strip, Eisenkot seeks a long-term cease-fire agreement, the return of captives, a complete demobilization of the ability to launch missiles and rockets, and under these conditions he will agree to rehabilitation measures for the Gaza Strip that include the opening of a seaport.

From an overall security perspective, he sees importance in promoting an active and uncompromising security policy to advance security interests, while demonstrating security power, in order to continue to erode enemy capabilities and deter hostile elements who have not yet come to terms with the existence of the State of Israel.

Eisenkot believes that Israel's enemies are not an existential threats to the State of Israel, but domestic polarization is. Therefore, he claims that the people of Israel must stop the campaign of boycotting each other in order to find lines of connection between political camps, and not let a distancer and a divider lead the people of Israel.

Eisenkot demands the promotion of reforms that will strengthen the separation of powers.
