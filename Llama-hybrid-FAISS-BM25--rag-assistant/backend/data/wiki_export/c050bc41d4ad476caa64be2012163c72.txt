Critical reception
AllMusic called the album "very highbrow in its pop sensibilities and general college rock aura." Exclaim! wrote that "the greatest testament to Feuerstack's accomplishment here is how rarely the urge strikes to engage in a track by track analysis - each 30-minute album works entirely on its own."
