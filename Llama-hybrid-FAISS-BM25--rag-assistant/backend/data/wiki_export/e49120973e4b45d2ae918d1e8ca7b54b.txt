The Court of Session Act 1810 was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom (50 Geo. 3. c. 112) reforming Scotland's highest court, the Court of Session. This Act was a follow-up Act to the Court of Session Act 1808 in reforming the Court of Session, creating the two divisions known as the Inner House and the Outer House.

Reform continued with the Court of Session Act 1813 which created the final form of the Outer House, and the Jury Trials (Scotland) Act 1815 which introduced trial by jury.

It was repealed by the Court of Session Act 1988.
