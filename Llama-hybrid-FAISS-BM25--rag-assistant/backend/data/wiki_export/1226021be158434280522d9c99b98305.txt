Richard Desjardins (born March 16, 1948) is a Québécois folk singer and film director.

Career
Desjardins and his friends formed the country rock ensemble Abbitibbi in the 1970s; Desjardins played piano, guitar, and sang. When the group disbanded in 1982, Desjardins pursued a solo career. He released a number of solo albums, including Tu m'aimes-tu in 1990 and Boom Boom, which appeared on the RPM 100 Top Albums list in 1998.

Desjardins also found work scoring films, especially documentaries. This involvement in the Quebec film industry even led him to co-direct a number of feature-length documentaries.  He was known for his environmental activism, especially with regards to protecting forests from over-exploitation, and to promote this he created the documentary film L'erreur boréale in 1999. In 2007 Desjardins, along with Robert Monderie, created The Invisible People, a documentary about the Algonquin nation in Quebec.

Desjardins went on tour in 2013, promoting his album L'existoire; after that he made occasional live appearances, including the 2018 Festival guitares du monde in Abitibi.

In 2017 a group of singers came together at Steve Jolin's Rouyn-Noranda record company to record Chanter Richard Desjardins, a tribute album of Desjardins' songs.

He was profiled in Lisette Marcotte's 2019 documentary film The Last Nataq (Le dernier Nataq).
