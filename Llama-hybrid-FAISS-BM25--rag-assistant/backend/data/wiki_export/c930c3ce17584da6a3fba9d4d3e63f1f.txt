History 
As with all of Kōchi Prefecture, the area of Kuroshio was part of ancient Tosa Province.  During the Edo period, the area was part of the holdings of Tosa Domain ruled by the Yamauchi clan from their seat at Kōchi Castle. Following the Meiji restoration, the village of Saga (佐賀村) was established within Hata District, Kōchi with the creation of the modern municipalities system on October 1, 1889. Saga was raised to town status on November 3, 1940. On March 20, 2006, Saga merged with the neighboring town of Ōgata to form the town of Kuroshio.

Government
Kuroshio has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral town council of 14 members. Kuroshio contributes one member to the Kōchi Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the town is part of Kōchi 2nd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

Economy
The local economy is dominated by commercial fishing, notably pole-and-line fishing for Tosa skipjack tuna, and by agriculture, including shiitake mushrooms and  greenhouse horticulture, flowers, and paddy rice. In recent years, sun-dried salt has become a representative specialty product. Seasonal tourism, particularly in the summer for camping and surfing is playing an increasing role in the local economy.

Education
Kuroshio has eight public elementary schools and two public middle schools operated by the town government, and one public high school operated by the Kōchi Prefectural Board of Education. The town participates in the JET Programme, employing two representatives who regularly visit the junior high schools and elementary schools to teach English.

Every year in late August, during the summer vacation, twelve third year students chosen from Kuroshio's two junior high schools travel to Hamilton, New Zealand. There they participate in a homestay with families of students who attend Hamilton's Fairfield Intermediate School.  The Kuroshio students are accompanied by a Kuroshio Board of Education representative, two teachers and one of the JET participants (usually a New Zealander).  The students participate in school activities and ESL classes while at Fairfield Intermediate. Occasionally Fairfield Intermediate have sent a group of students and teachers to visit Kuroshio.  The relationship between the two schools began in 1999.
