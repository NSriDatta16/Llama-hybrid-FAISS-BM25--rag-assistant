Personal life
The elder of two boys born to a chartered electrical engineer and a former Wren, he moved with his family from South London to Frinton-on-Sea, Essex, at a young age. Educated at Culford School, Bury St. Edmunds, he attended Southampton University, where he took his bachelor's degree in history in 1974, and King's College, London, where he took an M.A. in war studies in 1975.

Despite being profoundly deaf and asthmatic, White was a long-standing member of the Southsea Shakespeare Actors and a popular after-dinner speaker. He was a server at Portsmouth Cathedral, and a keen theatre and cinema goer.

In August 2006, White underwent an operation to remove a kidney, following a diagnosis of cancer. The cancer returned, however, and he died on Christmas Day 2008. As a mark of respect, all the ships in Portsmouth Harbour, including , lowered their ensigns to half-mast.
