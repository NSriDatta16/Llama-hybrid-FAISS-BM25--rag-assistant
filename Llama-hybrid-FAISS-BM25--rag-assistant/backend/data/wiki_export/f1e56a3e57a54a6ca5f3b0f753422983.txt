Woodcroft Halt railway station was a former railway halt located in the parish of Buriton between Rowlands Castle and Petersfield on the Portsmouth Direct Line.

History
During World War II, in 1940, the Admiralty requisitioned Ditcham Park, a nearby country house for use as a convalescent home for sailors (the house is now a private school). The halt was built to serve Ditcham Park, principally for trains from the extensive naval facilities in Portsmouth about  away. Woodcroft Halt, which was also known as Ditcham Park Halt, opened on 4 October 1943, and closed on 1 October 1945.

Because of its naval nature, it was featured on few maps, but some maps did mark it by a little tab without a name.

It was closed in 1945 and subsequently demolished; just a footbridge remains.

Location
The halt was located  from Waterloo, at  which is now marked on the OS 1:25000 map as "Woodcroft Farm". The stations to either side were  and .
