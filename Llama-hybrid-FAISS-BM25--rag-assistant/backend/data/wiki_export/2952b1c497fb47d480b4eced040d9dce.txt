Itihasa: Sansad TV Series 
Debroy anchors Itihasa, a show telecasted on Sansad TV, the official channel of Parliament of India. The series is a journey to discover what is "Bharata", what it means to be "Bhartiya" and what it means in terms of India's Sanatana Sanskriti.

Translations 
Debroy has translated the unabridged version of the Mahabharata into English, in a series of 10 volumes. He has also translated the Bhagavad Gita, the Harivamsa, the Vedas and Valmiki's Ramayana (in three volumes). He has translated the Bhagavata Purana (in three volumes), the Markandeya Purana (one volume), the Brahma Purana (two volumes) the Vishnu Purana (one volume) and the Shiva Purana (three volumes).  Along with Manmatha Nath Dutt, he is only the second person to have translated both the Mahabharata and the Ramayana, in unabridged form, into English. For his translations, he has been conferred with Sir Ramakrishna Gopal Bhandarkar Memorial Award in July 2023 by the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute.

Reception
The Reception by experts in the popular press has been favorable. Business Standard, reviewing his translation of Ramayana, admired Debroy's lucidity and addition of explanatory footnotes. Arshia Sattar, reviewing the same work for The Indian Express, applauded his remarkable feat of translating the two major Sanskrit epics and praised his introduction to the text as well as literal translation; notwithstanding the relatively poor scholarly apparatus vis-à-vis Goldman, Debroy's was held to be more compact and accessible. Hindustan Times, reviewing the translation of Mahabharata, commended his academic-like rigor and passion; it spoke favorably of Debroy's choice of words—modernized yet true to the Sanskrit source—, and sprinkling of mathematical details in notes. According to a review of Shiva Purana in News18, Bibek Debroy's translation is highlighted for its clarity and ease of understanding, like his previous translations of the Puranas, enriched with extensive footnotes and consistent use of terms, addressing the challenge of untranslated Sanskrit terms through explanatory footnotes and is highly recommended for those seeking an unabridged, distortion-free translation of the Shiva Purana.

Bibek Debroy's translation of the Shiva Purana is lauded by Open Magazine for its ability to capture the profound complexity and depth of this ancient text, effectively bringing its wisdom to modern readers who are not well-versed in Sanskrit. His work is not just a translation but an intellectual bridge that connects contemporary India with its rich spiritual heritage. Debroy masterfully conveys the intricate philosophies, narratives, and spiritual insights of the Shiva Purana, presenting them in a way that's comprehensive yet deeply impactful. This translation serves as a guiding light for serious readers, enabling them to explore and perhaps even experience the enigmatic essence of Shiva, encapsulated in the age-old question: "What is Shiva?" Beyond its spiritual significance, Debroy’s translation is a monumental contribution to India's cultural and intellectual discourse, providing a foundational framework for the nation's engagement with its ancient glory and spiritual inheritance.

In contrast, Willis Goth Regier, director of the University of Illinois Press, found Debroy's translation of Ramayana to be poor and lacking, if compared to that of Robert P. Goldman.
