2011 Prom 

The Shelton High School headmaster banned a senior and two friends from attending the senior prom because the students had taped a message of 12-inch high cardboard letters above the school's entrance inviting Tate's classmate, Sonali Rodrigues, to go to the dance with him. In addition to giving the students in-school suspensions for what she described as a safety issue, the headmaster described the act as trespassing and banned them from the dance.

The ban became the subject of protests on Facebook and was reported on national and international media.

Shelton Mayor Mark Lauretti and Shelton High School alumnus NFL quarterback Dan Orlovsky questioned the appropriateness of the punishment.  Connecticut governor Dannel Malloy sided with the student, saying, "While it seems that there are rules that were broken, in this case, it doesnâ€™t seem as though the punishment fits the crime." The punishment prompted state lawmakers Jason Perillo (R-Shelton) and Sean Williams (R-Waterbury) to introduce an amendment to a pending bill that, with an exception for vandalism and violence, would require schools to offer parents an alternative to banning students from school-related activities as means of punishment.

On May 12, the headmaster announced that she stood behind her decision, citing long-standing policy. Protests at the school continued the next day, with students being sent home saying they'd been told they were "inciting a riot and breach of peace". On May 14, the headmaster held a press conference reversing the decision, saying that "the level of distraction created by this incident" had "affected the culture of Shelton High School" and that "international notoriety" had forced her to reverse herself.
