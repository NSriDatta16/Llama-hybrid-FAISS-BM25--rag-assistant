Teen Summit is an American talk show for youth that aired on Black Entertainment Television (BET) from September 16, 1989 to August 31, 2002. In recent years it has returned as a very occasional special to the network's schedule.

Background
Created by Black Entertainment Television chief operating officer Sheila Johnson, and award-winning, originating broadcast producer Tony Regusters, Teen Summit dealt with the everyday issues teenagers face and attempted, often successfully, to bring them into perspective, and in a positive, uplifting light, while motivating teen viewers and their families to discuss the subjects presented on the weekly, one-hour, live show. After the original program host, Lisa Johnson, moved on in 1993, others filled the hosting vacuum, including Dajour Bullock and Ananda Lewis.

Cancellation and subsequent specials
After 13 years, Teen Summit was cancelled on August 31, 2002. Since then, it has returned twice, as a special called Teen Summit: Backstage Pass on June 21, 2007, then on June 25, 2017 as a part of that year's "BET Experience" festival in Los Angeles, hosted by Mindless Behavior's Princeton Perez.
