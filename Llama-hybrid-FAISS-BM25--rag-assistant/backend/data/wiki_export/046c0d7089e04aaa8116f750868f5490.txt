"Bunfight at the O.K. Tea Rooms" is an episode of the British comedy television series The Goodies.

This episode is also known as "Cream Cave" and as "Cream Rush Fever".

Written by The Goodies, with songs and music by Bill Oddie.

Plot
The Goodies head west (to Cornwall) to search for gold. Graeme, arriving from a dig, comments: "You'll never guess what I've just found in an old tin mine." Tim asks: "Gold?!" to which Graeme replies: "No, old tins ... and this!"  Tim, curious, asks: "What?" and Graeme answers: "Gold ore!" Tim asks: "Ore?", to which Graeme replies: "Or something else!"

Graeme takes things easy, while getting Tim and Bill to do all the work. When Bill complains, saying: "Now listen, we've been doing all the hard work, and you've just been sitting around all day!" Graeme says soothingly: "Lads, lads... somebody has to sit around all day."

The Goodies strike cream in an old mine – and Graeme files the claim for the cream in his own name, forsaking the other two, who are about to leave Cornwall broke and dejected. Tim and Bill then strike strawberry jam and scones. When Graeme finds out, he offers them a poker game, winner-takes-all, using pieces of toast rather than cards, and stakes taking the form of biscuits and later layered cakes (it is revealed that Graeme is cheating – he is using a toaster to pop slices of toast up into his hand).

Things reach a climax in a western-style shoot-out, but with tomato sauce rather than guns – and "The Ballad of the OK Tea Rooms" can then be heard: "For if you double-cross a friend, you'll get squirted in the end".
