Archbishop Ryan High School is a Roman Catholic high school located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Its namesake is Patrick John Ryan, who served as the second Archbishop of Philadelphia from 1884 to 1911.

Established in 1966, Archbishop Ryan High School is the largest Catholic secondary school in the city of Philadelphia, with a current enrollment of 848 students as of the 2023-2024 school year. Its students come from over 60 Catholic, public, and charter elementary schools located throughout Philadelphia, Bucks, and Montgomery Counties.

History
Archbishop Ryan High School first opened in 1966 as Archbishop Ryan High School for Boys and Archbishop Ryan High School for Girls; two separate single-sex high schools with their own administrations and faculties that each occupied one half of a single shared school building. Founded under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia, Archbishop Ryan was the twenty-eighth Archdiocesan high school to be established. Beginning with the 1988-1989 school year, the two schools merged to form a single co-ed Catholic secondary school; the merger was completed by the fall of 1989 and the first combined class graduated in June 1990.

Archbishop Ryan was the twenty-eighth Archdiocesan high school to be founded and the sixth begun by Cardinal John Krol, who continued the tradition of furthering Catholic education in the Philadelphia archdiocese. The  tract on Academy Road accommodates a spacious school building, and outdoor athletic fields as well as parking areas. The original design by architects, Dagit Associates, eased the merger. The central shared facilities of auditorium, library media center, and chapel serve the coeducational student body. Ryan draws students from all across the Philadelphia area extending into the surrounding suburban areas.

In the summer of 2014, Archbishop Ryan hired the current president, Denise LePera, as the previous president, Michael McArdle, was appointed to the office of Director of Financial Aid in the Office of Catholic Education within the Archdiocese of Philadelphia.  In June 2017, Denise LePera stepped down as President of Archbishop Ryan.  In November 2017, Michael Barnett '90 was appointed the newest President of Archbishop Ryan.  He resigned in May 2021. On June 16, 2022, the Archdiocese of Philadelphia's Office of Catholic Education announced that Joseph Sanginiti '75 would succeed Barnett as the current president of Archbishop Ryan.
