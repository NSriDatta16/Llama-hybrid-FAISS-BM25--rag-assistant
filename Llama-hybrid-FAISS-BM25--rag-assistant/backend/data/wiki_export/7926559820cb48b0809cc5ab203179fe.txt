History 
Oud-Wulven was originally a heerlijkheid (fiefdom). In 1545 it was combined with the neighbouring heerlijkheid Waaijen. "Oud-Wulven en Waaijen" remained a separate entity until 1811, when it merged into Houten. This didn't last long: in 1818 they were combined with the heerlijkheden Wulven, Heemstede, Grote Koppel, Kleine Koppel, Maarschalkerweerd, and Slagmaat to a single municipality called "Oud-Wulven.

Johannes Rothe was Lord of Oud-Wulven and Wayen in the Netherlands (1658–1671). He was a prophetic preacher and Fifth Monarchist. He married in 1660 in Goring House.

The municipality Oud-Wulven had an area of about 10.7 km2, and more than 250 inhabitants in the middle of the 19th century. The municipality was merged back with Houten on 8 September 1857.
