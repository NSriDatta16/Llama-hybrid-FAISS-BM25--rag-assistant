Union Station is a St. Louis MetroLink station. It is partially located underneath historic St. Louis Union Station and primarily serves the Downtown West area, including CityPark Stadium and the St. Louis Aquarium. The station is located below 18th Street at its intersection with Clark Avenue near the St. Louis Post Office and utilizes the former baggage tunnel at Union Station.

Public artwork 
In 2013, Metro's Arts in Transit program commissioned the work Spring Forth by Jim Gallucci for this station. The stainless steel sculpture depicts fantastical plant forms that leap and arch from the grassy embankment, celebrating the vitality that the MetroLink system brings to the St. Louis area.
