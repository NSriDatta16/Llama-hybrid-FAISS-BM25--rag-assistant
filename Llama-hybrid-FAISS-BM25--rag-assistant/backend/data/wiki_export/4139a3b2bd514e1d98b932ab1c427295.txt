Theatre
He made his debut as director in 1994 and since 1996 he has been a theatre playwright and director. The range of his performances belongs to the so-called Word Theatre; he developed its qualities creating drama compositions that already determine interpretation key and the work on the Text and on the Actors is essential.

In years, he carries out in his own working method and style, visionary and grotesque, and his research gives unusual reading of classic works (Anton Chekhov, Kafka, Pirandello, Shakespeare) and contemporary authors. Performances, usually located in spaces not appointed to theatre presentations, go beyond the realism dimension and they offer fantastic suggestions, irrational, with strong expressionistic tints. Original soundtracks – by musicians and bands – are always composed for every show.
