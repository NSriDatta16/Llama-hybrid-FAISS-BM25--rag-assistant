After starting out in his homeland, Petković went on to play professionally in Spain (Mallorca), Japan (Yokohama Marinos), Germany (VfL Wolfsburg and 1. FC Nürnberg), and Russia (Spartak Moscow and Saturn Ramenskoye).

In 1991, Petković was capped for Yugoslavia at under-18 level.

Between 2000 and 2004, Petković was capped seven times for Serbia and Montenegro (previously known as FR Yugoslavia). He was additionally called up to Serbia and Montenegro's 2006 FIFA World Cup squad by manager Ilija Petković, as a replacement for the injured Mirko Vučinić, but withdrew from the roster following media criticism of the fact that it was his father who selected him.
