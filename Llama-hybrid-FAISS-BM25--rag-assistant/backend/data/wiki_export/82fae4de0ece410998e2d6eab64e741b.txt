Drogosław is a Polish coat of arms. It was used by several szlachta families in the times of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

History

This shield was brought to Poland from Silesia. This took place in the year 1333, during the reign of King Kazimierz the Great. The occasion on which these arms were granted to an ancestor of the house was as follows: 
The enemy had encircled the army and enclosed it in a ring, when this ancestor, gathering his courage, used his sword to open a path and broke through the circle. A Drogoslaw is the first we know of with these arms, and they took their name from him.
