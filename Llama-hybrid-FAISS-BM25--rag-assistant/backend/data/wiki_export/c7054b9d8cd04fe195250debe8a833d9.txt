Harbrinkhoek (Tweants: ) is a village in the Dutch province of Overijssel. It is a part of the municipality of Tubbergen, and lies about 5Â km northeast of Almelo.

It was first mentioned in 1844 as Harbrink, and means "settlement of the people of Harbert (person)". In the 1950s, the hamlet turned into a little village. The village is twinned with Mariaparochie, but both still have separate place name signs, statistical entries and postal codes.
