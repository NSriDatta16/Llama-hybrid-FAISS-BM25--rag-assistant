The area consists mainly of bog but also includes primeval forests, some of which have been unmanaged for over 150 years.

Marked trails in the general area extend to over 300 km.

In early 1800s two manors bought them, but they had financially hard times and had to sell them to the state before end of the 19th century. Before selling, they logged clear all areas with easy access, but some islands in middle of mires remained unlogged.
