Andrews is a patronymic surname of English, Scottish, and Norse origin. At the time of the 1881 British Census, its relative frequency was highest in Dorset (3.6 times the British average), followed by Wiltshire, Huntingdonshire, Worcestershire, Hampshire, Suffolk, Cambridgeshire, Devon and Somerset.

The surname Andrews was first found in Caithness, North Scotland. Historically, the Andrews clan were closely associated with Clan Ross. The Andrews of Scotland dispersed during the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries and are now found worldwide in America, Canada, and Australia. Many Andrews also moved to Northern Ireland and England.
