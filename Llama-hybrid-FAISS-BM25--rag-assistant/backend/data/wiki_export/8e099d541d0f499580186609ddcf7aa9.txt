History
The area around Oissel were a common place for Viking raiders because of its location on the Seine river, during their raids on Francia. Eventually, the Vikings setteled on one of the islands near Oissel and made it into a base, calling the island "Thorhólmr" meaning "Thor's Island".

During the battle of France, 9 June 1940, the French blew up several bridges and crossings over the Seine river around Oissel to halt the German advance, including Viaduc de Oissel and Pont de Tourville-la-Rivière.
