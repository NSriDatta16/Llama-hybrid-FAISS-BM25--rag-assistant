David Eric Lloyd Morelli (born May 19, 1986) is an American actor. He is best known for work as a child actor in such roles as Charlie Calvin in Disney's The Santa Clause film trilogy and the follow-up series The Santa Clauses, as well as "Little John" Warner in the NBC television series Jesse, and Kyle Grant in Dunston Checks In.

Career
His television career began when, between ages two and five, he was cast as a young Kevin Arnold (Fred Savage) in episodes of The Wonder Years. His film credits include Batman & Robin, Dunston Checks In, My Giant, The Brave Little Toaster Goes to Mars, and The Brave Little Toaster to the Rescue.

In 2015, Lloyd opened Lloyd Production Studios. LP Studios is a production and post-production music and film space located in Glendale, California.

In 1996, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram wrote, "Eric Lloyd is a few years shy of adolescence, but already he has the credentials of a veteran actor," stating that at that time his biggest role was in The Santa Clause, but that his role in Dunston Checks In put him "back in the thick of things".
