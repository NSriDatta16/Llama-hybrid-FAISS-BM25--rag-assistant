Hyogong of Silla (885–912) (r. 897–912) was the 52nd ruler of the Korean kingdom of Silla.  He was the illegitimate son of King Heongang by Lady Uimyeong.  He married the daughter of Ichan Ugyeom.  His reign saw the expansion of Later Three Kingdoms powers Taebong and Hubaekje across what had once been the western marches of Unified Silla.

During his reign, the situation of Silla was that Gung Ye and Gyeon Hwon, who took place in the provinces, were fighting for supremacy.

In 905, Silla lost its holdings to the northeast of Jungnyeong pass. In 907, Gyeon Hwon's Hubaekje forces seized ten castles to the south of Ilseon. Faced with these defeats, the king turned to drink and neglected state affairs.  Upon his death in 912, he was buried to the north of Sajasa temple.
