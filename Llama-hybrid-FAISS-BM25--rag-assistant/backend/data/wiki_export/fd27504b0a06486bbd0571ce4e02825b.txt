Prevention is an American healthy-lifestyle magazine published by Hearst Corporation featuring articles about health conditions, wellness, food and nutrition, weight loss, fitness, and beauty.

Founded in 1950 by J. I. Rodale and published initially by Rodale, Inc., in Emmaus, Pennsylvania, Prevention grew out of J. I. Rodale's interest in exploring the connection between human health and organic agriculture. The magazine launched with approximately 50,000 subscribers. 

In 2018, Prevention was acquired by Hearst Magazines along with four other Rodale brands: Men's Health, Women's Health, Runner's World, and Bicycling. Today, Prevention is published in both the United States and Australia.
