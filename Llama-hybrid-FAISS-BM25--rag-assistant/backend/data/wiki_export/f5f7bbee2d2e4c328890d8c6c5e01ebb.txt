"I Can Hear Music" is a song written by Jeff Barry, Ellie Greenwich and Phil Spector for American girl group the Ronettes (credited as The Ronettes Featuring Veronica) in 1966.  This version spent one week on the Billboard Pop chart at number 100.  In early 1969, the Beach Boys released a cover version as a single from their album 20/20 (1969), peaking at number 24 in the US.

Cash Box said that "Ronnie sings a strong lead throughout the teen-oriented, emotion filled tune which is effectively backed by throbbing sounds." Record World described it as a "slow but torrid goodie."
