David James Paice (born 24 November 1983) is a former rugby union player. A hooker, he was a one-club man for London Irish and represented England eight times.

Career
Paice was born in Darwin and brought up in Brisbane. In 2003 during a Gap year he joined the academy of London Irish and made his club debut that same year. Paice was a member of the side that were defeated by Gloucester in extra time of the 2006 European Challenge Cup final. He also started in their loss against Toulouse at the semi-final stage of the 2007–08 Heineken Cup. The following season saw Irish finish runners up to Leicester Tigers in the 2009 Premiership final.

Paice started for the England Saxons side that defeated New Zealand Maori to win the 2007 Churchill Cup. On 1 February 2008 he started in a victory over Ireland A. Paice received his first call up to the senior England squad for their 2008 tour of New Zealand. On 14 June 2008 he made his debut in the opening test coming off the bench in a defeat at Eden Park.

In November 2012, after a four year absence, Paice returned to the England squad and played in all of their autumn internationals including a win over New Zealand. His last caps came on their 2013 tour of Argentina.

Following relegation in 2016 Paice led London Irish to promotion during the 2016–17 season. During that campaign he made his 250th appearance for the club and often captained the team on the field. In 2018 Paice retired after fifteen years at London Irish and returned to his native Australia.
