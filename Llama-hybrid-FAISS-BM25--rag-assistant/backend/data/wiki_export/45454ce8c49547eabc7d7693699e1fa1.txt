History 

The congregation of St Matthew's was founded on 29 September 1902, beginning as a Cantonese-speaking Chinese congregation under St. Peter's Church, Singapore.

Historically, the Neil Road site and the present site were near two of the places used to gather and screen Chinese men aged 18 to 55 for the Sook Ching massacre in 1942: the present Police Cantonment Complex, and the area between Singapore General Hospital and Tiong Bahru Road.

After World War II, a second building was constructed at Neil Road, which expanded to include a kindergarten.

The present building at 1K Eng Hoon Street, Singapore 169796 in Tiong Bahru was dedicated on 7 May 2006 by the John Chew Hiang Chea (周贤正大主教), who is the 3rd Archbishop of the Church of the Province of South East Asia as well as the 9th Bishop of Singapore.
