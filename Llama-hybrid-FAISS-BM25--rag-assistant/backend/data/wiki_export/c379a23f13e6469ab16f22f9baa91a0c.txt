In other countries
Space Sheriff Shaider was released in the Philippines as Shaider in the late-1980s, where it became the first tokusatsu show to be dubbed in Filipino on ABS-CBN (1988-1991), IBC (1992-1994), RPN-9 (1997-1998), GMA Network (2003-2005), Hero TV (2006-2009), TeleAsia (2014). In this release, Dai Sawamura was renamed, Alexis. Also in this version, Kojiro Oyama is called Doctor Ang, Kubilai is called Fuuma Ley-ar, Priest Poe is called Ida (voiced by a female instead of a male as in the original) and Hessler is called Drigo.

The series was aired on M6 in France under the title Capitaine Sheider. The theme song was performed by Bernard Minet.

The series was also broadcast in Brazil, also under the name Shaider, in the early 1990s. Different from other tokusatsu series in Brazil, Shaider was broadcast on a channel as unpopular as the main ones around that time in Brazil, Rede Gazeta. As a result, only a few people saw the show. Rede Globo, though one of the most popular television channels, later began broadcasting Shaider in the early morning, around 5 am, until it disappeared completely from television.

Video game
A video game based on the television series, The Space Sheriff Spirits, was released for the PlayStation 2 system on May 25, 2006, by Bandai Namco. This product was made available in Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The actors for Gavan and Sharivan reprised their roles, but Hiroshi Tsuburaya died before the game was developed, so anime voice actor Takuo Kawamura took over the role of Shaider instead.
