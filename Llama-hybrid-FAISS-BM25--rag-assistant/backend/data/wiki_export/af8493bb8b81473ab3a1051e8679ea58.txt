The flag of the Autonomous Community of the Canary Islands is a vertical tricolour of three equal bands of white, blue, and yellow. The state flag includes the Coat of arms of the Canary Islands in the central band; the civil flag omits this. The designs were made official by the Statute of Autonomy of the Canarian Autonomous Community (Organic Law 10/82) on 16 August 1982.

History and meaning 
The tricolour flag has its origins in the Canarias Libre movement of the 1960s.  It was designed by Carmen Sarmiento and her sons Arturo and Jesus Cantero Sarmiento, and first displayed (in paper form) on 8 September 1961. It combined the blue and white colours of the Province of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (Province of Canary Islands) with the blue and yellow colours of the Province of Las Palmas. The two dogs represented on flag's seal centered on the flag are Perro de Presa Canarios, or Canary Catch Dogs, that were first bred on the Canary Islands by ranchers who use them to herd and protect their cattle.

Colours 
The colours of the flag as specified by the Canarian Government are the following:
