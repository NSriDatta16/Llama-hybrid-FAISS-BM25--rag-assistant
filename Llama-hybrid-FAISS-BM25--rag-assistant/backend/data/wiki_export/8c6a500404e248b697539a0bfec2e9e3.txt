Immaculate Heart High School and Middle School is a private, Catholic, college preparatory day school for young women grades 6-12. The school is located in the Los Feliz neighborhood in Los Angeles, California, United States, at the intersection of Franklin Avenue and Western Avenue. There are approximately 200 students in the middle school (grades 6–8) and over 550 in the high school (grades 9–12).

History
The school is located in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles. It was founded by the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary  in 1906 as a girl's day and boarding school. Although the school  remains on its original site, much  of the original Spanish Mission style convent, classrooms and boarders' dormitories were torn down in 1973. The graduation ceremony for the senior class is traditionally held at the Hollywood Bowl. By far the majority of its more than 10,000 graduates have continued their education at colleges and universities across the country. They have served as artists, musicians, educators, journalists, doctors, lawyers, judges, and stars of stage and screen.
