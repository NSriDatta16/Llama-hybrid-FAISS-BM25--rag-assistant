He was a long-time creative director at Cartoon Network since 1996, and ran content development and oversaw programming for the network in the mid-2000s. Ouweleen is married with three sons.

In 2014, Ouweleen was named CMO of CNI. He was then promoted in November 27, 2019 as the interim president of CNI in addition to Turner Classic Movies, due to the departure of Christina Miller. His stint as interim president of CNI ended on July 1, 2020 with the appointment of Tom Ascheim permanently to the position, and Ouweleen took the presidency of Adult Swim. 

In May 2022, following the Warner Bros. Discovery merger close, Tom Ascheim departed CNI, and the companies under CNI (Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, and Boomerang) were moved into Warner Bros. Discovery Networks U.S., with Ouweleen regaining oversight of CNI after one year and ten months. He has also gained the role of president for Discovery Family.

In June 2023, Ouweleen gained the Business side of TCM, following another wave of layoffs at the Television part of Warner Bros. Discovery including the General Manager and President, Pola Changnon.
