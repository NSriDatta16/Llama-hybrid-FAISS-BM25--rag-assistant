"Don't Stop Movin'" is a song by British pop group S Club 7, released on 23 April 2001 as the lead single from their third studio album, Sunshine (2001). The song was written by the group, along with their regular songwriter Simon Ellis, together with Sheppard Solomon. Solomon had worked on hits in the 1990s by Eternal and Michelle Gayle.

The song reached number one in the UK Singles Chart twice in the course of one month, with Geri Halliwell's "It's Raining Men" spending two weeks at the top position in between. The song's popularity rendered it the year's seventh biggest-selling single. It was also awarded the BRIT Award for Best British Single in 2002 and ITV's Record of the Year accolade.
