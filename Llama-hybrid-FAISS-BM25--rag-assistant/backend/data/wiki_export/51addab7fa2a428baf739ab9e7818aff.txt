Musical style 

Lazuli combine progressive rock with world and electro music.
Besides guitar, keyboards and drums the band plays also léode, vibraphone and horn; until 2009, split chapman stick, marimba and warr guitar were used as well.

Claude Leonetti invented and plays the léode, because he cannot use his left arm after a motorcycle accident.

Their lyrics are entirely in French.
