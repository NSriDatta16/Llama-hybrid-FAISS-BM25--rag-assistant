Research 

Scott published highly influential work on rhetorical theory and criticism. His most famous article, “On Viewing Rhetoric As Epistemic,” became one of the most important academic articles written in rhetorical studies in the past century.

Drawing inspiration from the ancient Sophists and Stephen Toulmin, and others, Scott argued that the traditional understanding of rhetoric as an art merely for making the Truth effective was inadequate. If we acknowledge that truth is probable and contingent, then it follows that rhetoric is a central art for finding our way. Scott argued that we should “consider truth not as something fixed and final but as something to be created moment by moment” in the circumstances in which we find ourselves and with which we must cope. Humans may plot our course by fixed stars but we do not possess those stars; we proceed, more or less effectively, on our course. Furthermore, humanity has learned that the stars are fixed only in a relative sense. In human affairs, then, “rhetoric is a way of knowing; it is epistemic.” In 1978, Michael Leff noted that “rhetoric is epistemic” marked the dominant trend in contemporary rhetorical theorizing.
