Kill Trend Suicide is the third studio album by grindcore band Brutal Truth. It was labelled as a "mini-album" due to it being longer than an EP but not as long as a standard album. This release shows a shift from the grindcore sound that the band had previously played, by incorporating elements of crust punk, rock, and experimental music. Riffs that sound similar to that of Frank Zappa can also be found on this mini-album, most prominent being on the song "Zombie".
