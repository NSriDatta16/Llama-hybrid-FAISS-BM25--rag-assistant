The Leprechaun is the ninth solo album by Chick Corea, released in 1976. It features horn and string sections, and vocals from Corea’s wife Gayle Moran, formerly of Mahavishnu Orchestra.

The album was recorded during Corea's time with his jazz fusion group Return to Forever.  Though the album is more jazz oriented than anything Return to Forever had produced up to that time, the fusion edge still rings through quite clearly. Corea was awarded the Grammy Award for Best Jazz Performance by a Group for the album and the Grammy Award for the Best Instrumental Arrangement for "Leprechaun's Dream, Pt. 1" at the 19th Annual Grammy Awards in 1977.
