Critical reception
Larry Flick from Billboard described the song as "a wacky blend of guttural toasting and retro-pop shuffle beats." He felt that "the hook has the potential to take up permanent residence in your brain, while the fun array of sound effects are sure to get those shoulders shakin' out of control." He also encouraged, "Seek it out and give it a whirl." A reviewer from The Guardian called it a "cute" hit. Andy Beevers from Music Week declared it as "a bouncey Shaggy-style party track that is destined to get plenty of summertime radio play." David Quantick from NME viewed it as "so jovial and bouncy". Tony Cross from Smash Hits gave it five out of five, naming it Best New Single. He wrote, "Trying not to wind your body down to this is like trying not to chew a Rowntree's fruit pastille. Apache's belly-wriggler is fabber than Shabba and shaggier than Shaggy, and his Brummy raggamuffin beat is a dance hall dream come true. Apache invites everybody to join him in one massive ragga party, putting his Bhangra roots on the back burner for the summer. A great record that will surely mean the big time at last for the Apache..."
