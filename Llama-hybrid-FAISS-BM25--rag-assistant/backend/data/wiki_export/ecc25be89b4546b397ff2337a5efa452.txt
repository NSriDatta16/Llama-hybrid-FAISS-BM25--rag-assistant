Distribution
Early in its history, Cavity Search records were distributed by Alternative Distribution Alliance, an American company founded in 1993. In May 2012 Cavity Search was announced as one of the first nine labels to join the newly formed Frenchkiss Label Group. Frenchkiss Records, founded by Syd Butler, had started the distribution company earlier that year, which is "focused on growing visibility for indie labels in the spirit of communities such as Dischord, Rough Trade and Touch & Go."  At that point, Frenchkiss had ceased its affiliation with RED and had begun working with The Orchard.
