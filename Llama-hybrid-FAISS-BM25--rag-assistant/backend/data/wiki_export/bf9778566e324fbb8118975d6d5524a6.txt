Po Leung Kuk Lo Kit Sing (1983) College () is a Hong Kong secondary school. Located in Cheung Hong Estate, Tsing Yi, New Territories, the subsidised secondary school was founded by Po Leung Kuk, a Hong Kong charitable organisation, in 1984. It was the first secondary school on the island. The school was named as Po Leung Kuk 1983 Board of Directors' College () before 2011.

Introduction 
The school arranges numerous regular extracurricular activities for all students. Annual school events include reading activities, dance festivals, music festivals, drama performances, Chinese cultural week, swimming galas, sports days and summer camp.

The school has been a vanguard of project-based learning since the 1990s, when the approach was relatively new to many Hong Kong secondary schools. Students, divided into tetrads or pentads, have to finish a project throughout their summer vacation. Also, students need to complete various projects related to each subject they are studying.

The school adopted English as the medium of instruction (EMI) in September 2010, owing to its efforts to strengthen the role of English language in the school. For instance, one-third of the school's lessons in an academic year are conducted in English. Its morning assembly is also conducted in English.

Name change controversy

Background 
Po Leung Kuk, founder of the school, announced an identified donor, Mr Lo, donated HK$10 million to the school, in January 2010. The school then proposed a change to its name to honor the donor. The school's proposal soon sparked controversy among students and alumni of the school, which later launched a Facebook campaign to ask for withdrawal of the proposal. During the consultation period, Po Leung Kuk held discussions with different stakeholders of the school, claiming the overall response to the name change was positive. Student union of the school, in response to the controversy, held a forum on 25 January 2010 to deliberate the issue. Hui Wing-ho, then-principal of the school, was invited to the forum.

Confirmation 
Po Leung Kuk confirmed the long-speculated name change of the school after Lo Kit-sing, then-vice-chairman of Hong Kong Football Association, donated HK$7.8 million to the school, in June 2011. New name of the school, Po Leung Kuk Lo Kit Sing (1983) College, was unveiled on 14 September 2011 by a representative from Po Leung Kuk. Education Bureau approved the school's application for the name change on 28 November 2011 and informed the school can adopt the new name two days later. A naming ceremony, officiated by Michael Suen Ming-yeung, then-Secretary for Education, was held on 2 December 2011 to celebrate the name change.
