Events
April 14 – William Howard Taft became the first U.S. president to throw out the ceremonial "first pitch" after he opened the 1910 season at Washington's League Park. Washington Senators' Walter Johnson christened the tradition by pitching a one-hitter, beating the Philadelphia Athletics, 3-0.
April 20 – Addie Joss of the Cleveland Naps pitches the second no-hitter of his career defeating the Chicago White Sox, 1-0. Joss was the last major leaguer to throw a no-hitter, when he tossed a perfect game on October 2, 1908. That game was also a 1-0 win over the White Sox.
May 12 – Chief Bender throws a no-hitter for the Philadelphia Athletics, coming within one walk of a perfect game. Philadelphia beats the Cleveland Naps, 4-0.
June 28 – Chicago Cubs shortstop Joe Tinker steals home twice becoming the first major leaguer to accomplish the feat in Cubs' 11–1 home victory over the Cincinnati Reds. Mordecai Brown is the winning pitcher.
July 3 – Pittsburgh Pirates outfielder Chief Wilson hits for the cycle in a 10-2 victory over the Cincinnati Reds.
July 19 – Cleveland Naps ace Cy Young wins the 500th game of his career, defeating the Washington Senators, 5-4.
August 13 — The "baseball game of perfect symmetry" took place as Brooklyn and Pittsburgh played an 8–8 tie before the game was called because of darkness.  Each team had 8 runs, 13 hits, 2 errors, 12 assists, 5 strikeouts, 3 walks, one base hit, and one passed ball.
August 18 – Rickwood Field opens in Birmingham, Alabama, with 10,000 fans watching the Birmingham Barons defeat the Montgomery Climbers in a 3-2 pitchers' duel won by Harry Coveleski.
August 25 – Philadelphia Athletics second baseman Danny Murphy hits for the cycle in a 9-6 loss to the St. Louis Browns.
September 1 - During the league's 1910 Rule 5 draft, the Chicago White Sox select infielder Buck Weaver from York in the Tri-State league. Weaver is best remembered today as one of players banned for life regarding the 1919 World Series Fix.  
September 17 – Detroit Tigers pitcher Ed Summers, a notoriously poor hitter, bounces two home runs into the stands in a 10–3 victory over the Philadelphia Athletics. The two homers, both off Harry Krause, will comprise his career total.
October 6 – Boston Doves outfielder Bill Collins hits for the cycle as Boston crushes the Philadelphia Phillies, 20-7. Collins becomes the first player in baseball history to hit for the natural cycle.
October 9 – Detroit Tigers star Ty Cobb stayed out of the lineup to preserve his .383 batting average. Cleveland Naps' Nap Lajoie went 8-for-8 in a doubleheader where six of his hits were bunt singles. He finished with a .384 batting average and rumor has it that the St. Louis Browns gave Lajoie the singles by playing too deep. American League president Ban Johnson investigated and found no wrongdoing.
October 23 – The Philadelphia Athletics defeat the Chicago Cubs, 7–2, in Game 5 of the World Series to win their first World Championship, four games to one.
