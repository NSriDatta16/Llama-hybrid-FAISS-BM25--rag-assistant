Haplogroup B (M60) is a human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup common to paternal lineages in Africa. It is a primary branch of the haplogroup BT.

B (M60) is common in parts of Africa, especially the tropical forests of West-Central Africa.  It was the ancestral haplogroup of not only modern Pygmies like the Baka and Mbuti, but also Hadzabe from Tanzania, who often have been considered, in large part because of some typological features of their language, to be a remnant of Khoisan people in East Africa.

Distribution
According to one study of the Y-DNA of populations in Sudan, haplogroup B-M60 is found in approximately 30% (16/53) of Southern Sudanese, 16% (5/32) of local Hausa people, 14% (4/28) of the Nuba of central Sudan, 3.7% (8/216) of Northern Sudanese (but only among Copts and Nubians), and 2.2% (2/90) of Western Sudanese. According to another study, haplogroup B is found in approximately 15% of Sudanese males, including 12.5% (5/40) B2a1a1a1 (M109/M152) and 2.5% (1/40) B-M60(xM146, M150, M112).

In Madagascar, haplogroup B-M60 has been found in approximately 9% of Malagasy males, including 6% (2/35) B-M60(xB2b-50f2(P)) and 3% (1/35) B2b-50f2(P).

Family Tree DNA shows a significant number of persons of Haplogroup B-M60 (B-M181) claiming origins from the Arabian Peninsula (dominantly Saudi Arabia, but also in Kuwait, Bahrain, Yemen, Qatar, Iraq, United Arab Emirates, and Oman).  Sampling bias does not allow for meaningful percentages, but the presence of the haplogroup is solidly attested. 

In Hormozgan Province in Iran, haplogroup B-M60 has been found in 8.2% of a sample of 49 Qeshmi people, and in 2.3% of a sample of 131 Bandari people.

In Afghanistan, haplogroup B-M60 has been found in 5.1% (3/59) of a sample of Hazara males.

In United Kingdom, haplogroup B-M60(xM218) has been found by FTDNA in 1 individual.

Phylogenetics

Phylogenetic history

Prior to 2002, there were in academic literature at least seven naming systems for the Y-Chromosome Phylogenetic tree. This led to considerable confusion. In 2002, the major research groups came together and formed the Y-Chromosome Consortium (YCC). They published a joint paper that created a single new tree that all agreed to use. Later, a group of citizen scientists with an interest in population genetics and genetic genealogy formed a working group to create an amateur tree aiming at being above all timely.  The table below brings together all of these works at the point of the landmark 2002 YCC Tree. This allows a researcher reviewing older published literature to quickly move between nomenclatures.

Original research publications
The following research teams per their publications were represented in the creation of the YCC Tree.
