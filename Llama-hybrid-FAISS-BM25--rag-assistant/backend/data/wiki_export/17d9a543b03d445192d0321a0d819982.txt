Barry Manilow Live is the fifth album by the singer-songwriter Barry Manilow. The album was released in 1977, and it became Manilow's first to top the US Billboard 200.

Manilow also was among 1977 Special Tony Award winners Lily Tomlin, Diana Ross, National Theatre For the Deaf and Equity Library Theatre honored with the award that year. He received it for Barry Manilow on Broadway, his 12-day stay at the Uris Theatre from December 21, 1976 to January 2, 1977,  where this live album was recorded.

The album is known for giving the first commercial release to Manilow's VSM ("Very Strange Medley"). Before the performance Manilow refers to this as a medley of songs that he included in his act against the values of his "artsy fartsy friends". It is a medley of commercial jingles Manilow was involved with, either as a writer or performer, before he became a chart star. The products and companies these promoted include Kentucky Fried Chicken, State Farm, Stridex, Band-Aid, Bowlene, Dr. Pepper, Pepsi and McDonald's.

When first released on Compact Disc, dialogue and all movements to "Beautiful Music" were omitted for it all to fit on one disc, but the 2006 CD re-release restored all dialogue and songs, in addition to reordering the track listing to accommodate the added bonus tracks.
