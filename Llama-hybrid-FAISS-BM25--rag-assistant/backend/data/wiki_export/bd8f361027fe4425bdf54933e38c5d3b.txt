A Compact Macintosh (or Compact Mac) is an all-in-one Apple Mac computer with a display integrated in the computer case, beginning with the original Macintosh 128K. Compact Macs include the original Macintosh through to the Color Classic sold between 1984 and 1995. The larger Macintosh LC 500 series, Power Macintosh 5000 series, iMac and eMac are not described as a "Compact Mac."

Apple divides these models into five form factors: The Macintosh 128K, Macintosh SE, and Macintosh Classic (all with a  black and white screen), the modernized Macintosh Color Classic with a  color screen, and the very different Macintosh XL.
