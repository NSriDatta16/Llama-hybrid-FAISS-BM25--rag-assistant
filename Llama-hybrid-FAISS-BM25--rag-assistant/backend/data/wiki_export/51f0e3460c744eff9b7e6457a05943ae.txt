New York's 8th congressional district for the U.S. House of Representatives is in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. It is currently represented by Representative Hakeem Jeffries, the House Minority Leader.

From 1993 to 2013, the district covered much of the west side of Manhattan and western coastal sections of Brooklyn. However, after decennial redistricting, it was redrawn to take in much of the territory previously in the 10th district. It now encompasses majority African-American and Caribbean-American Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brownsville, Canarsie, East New York, Ocean Hill, Spring Creek, and East Flatbush; the mostly white neighborhoods of Bergen Beach, Gerritsen Beach, Howard Beach, Marine Park, Mill Basin and Sea Gate; and mixed neighborhoods like Clinton Hill, Flatlands, Fort Greene, Ozone Park, Brighton Beach, and Coney Island. Most of the old 8th was renumbered as the 10th.

Various New York districts have been numbered "8" over the years, including areas in New York City and various parts of upstate New York. The state's congressional districts had been redrawn in a manner that puts much of the territory of the old 10th Congressional district into the new 8th Congressional district. The election had a few competitors for what was then an open seat, with the 10th incumbent congressman Edolphus Towns retiring. State assemblyman Hakeem Jeffries faced off against New York City Councilman Charles Barron. Jeffries won the primary and ultimately the general election.

The 8th district was a Queens-based seat until the 1992 redistricting. At that time much of the old 8th district became the 5th district. The new 8th district was created by cobbling together portions of the Manhattan-based 17th district and the 13th district in Brooklyn.

Recent election results
In New York electoral politics there are numerous minor parties at various points on the political spectrum. Certain parties will invariably endorse either the Republican or Democratic candidate for every office, hence the state electoral results contain both the party votes, and the final candidate votes (Listed as "Recap").
