The Boyer River (Rivière Boyer in French) is a tributary of Chenal des Grands Voiliers, on the south shore of Saint Lawrence River. This small river of about  in length flows in the municipalities of Saint-Charles-de-Bellechasse, Saint-Michel-de-Bellechasse and Saint-Vallier, in the Bellechasse Regional County Municipality, in the administrative region of Chaudière-Appalaches, in Quebec, in Canada.

The lower part of this valley is served by the route 132 which runs along the southeast bank of the St. Lawrence River, and also by the road of the second range West (which becomes Rang Nord-Est and Avenue Royale, further south), Chemin du 3e rang Ouest (which becomes Chemin du rang Sud-Est, further south).

Apart from a few forest areas crossed by the river, agriculture is the main economic activity in this valley.

The surface of the Boyer River is generally frozen from the beginning of December until the end of March, except the rapids areas; however, safe circulation on the ice is generally done from mid-December to mid-March. The water level of the river varies with the seasons and the precipitation; the spring flood occurs in March or April.
