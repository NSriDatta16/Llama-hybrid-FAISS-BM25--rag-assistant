History

Early history
In 1654, near the site of modern Shebekino, the  fortress was built, part of the . Since then, the site of Shebekino began to be populated by workers, peasants, and Ukrainians.

Shebekino proper first appears in Russian maps in 1713. The name of the settlement originates from the original owner of the land, Ivan Dmitrievich Shibeko. Shibeko was a soldier who fought in the Battle of Poltava, who bought the land and settled there with his serfs. Shibeko died childless in 1716, leading to protracted ownership disputes over the land.

Industrial development
In 1836, Shebekino was bought by military officer . Rehbinder built several factories in the area, including a sugar factory on the river Nezhegol, which specifically is credited with beginning the industrial development of Shebekino. In 1890, construction began on a railway line from Shebekino to Kupiansk. In 1905, Alexei Rehbinder's son Alexander Rehbinder built an electric power plant near the sugar factory, which provided the factory as well as residential houses with electricity.

In 1928, Shebekino became the center of the newly created Shebekinsky District. It received town/city status in 1938. During World War II, the town was located on the frontline between opposing forces and was heavily damaged. It was occupied by Nazi Germany between 14 June 1942 and 9 February 1943. By the end of the occupation, the industry of the town was reduced to ruins.

In the postwar period, Shebekino developed a chemical industry. On 6 January 1954, Shebekinsky District was transferred to the newly created Belgorod Oblast. By 1993, Shebekino had a population of 45,100 inhabitants.

Russian invasion of Ukraine

On June 1, 2023, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Shebekino was reportedly hit by shelling from Ukrainian territory. Shebekino was described by journalists as effectively becoming a "frontline city", with little-to-no help from Russian authorities. Residents of the town described it as "destroyed" by heavy shelling. Mass evacuations took place. The shelling was the prelude to a full ground raid into Russian territory by two pro-Ukrainian militias: the Russian Volunteer Corps (RVC) and the Freedom of Russia Legion (FRL).

According to the Institute for the Study of War, the FRL and RVC reached Shebekino and Novaya Tavolzhanka on 1 June. The ISW described the attacks as raids, defining them as "small scale assault operations involving swift entry into hostile territory to secure information, disrupt hostile forces, or destroy installations". Belgorod Oblast Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said residents were being evacuated from the settlements and claimed that all "Ukrainian" forces had withdrawn from Belgorod Oblast by the end of the day.

On 4 June, the FRL posted a video online calling for Governor Gladkov to meet them "to discuss the current situation in the region and the future of Russia," in exchange for releasing two Russian soldiers they had captured. Gladkov said he would be willing to meet the group in Shebekino. The FRL leadership arrived at the checkpoint outside Shebekino at the agreed time, but Gladkov did not, claiming that the POWs had been executed. In response, the FRL said it would send the POWs to Kyiv.

As late as 17 June, there were still reports of anti-government forces sporadically operating in Belgorod Oblast, shelling pro-government positions. The number of evacuations of civilians from border regions was estimated at 6,500, with most of the civilians from Shebekino having left.

In July 2023, it was reported by locals that a box of "remains of unknown origin" had appeared on a street in Shebekino, near a local animal shelter. The meat was originally frozen, but melted and expired over time as it was left out, with Shebekino residents complaining of extremely unpleasant smells and pollution. The owner of the shelter was quoted by Russian media as saying that it was humanitarian aid for the animals which had been left out by the transport workers, and that it was impossible to drag it into the building, and they received no help from local authorities. The images, shared without context on Ukrainian social media, became the subject of online conspiracy theories speculating that the so-called "meat cube" was in fact the remains of Russian soldiers killed during the war in Ukraine.
