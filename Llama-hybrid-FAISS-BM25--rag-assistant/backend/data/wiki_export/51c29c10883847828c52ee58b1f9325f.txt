Reception 
The Hindu wrote that "certain scenes have appreciable depth while some are downright superficial and predictable", and that the film was "absorbing in parts, spontaneous in spurts, natural at times and clichéd now and then". Karthiga Rukmanykanthan of the Sri Lankan newspaper Daily News labelled it as "strictly for youth" and a "perfect choice". A critic from Chennai Online wrote that " ‘U 20 me 18’ is one more on the list of nearly a handful of such films released recently. But to debutant Jothi kirshna’s credit (its his home production) it should be mentioned that he’s begun the film nearly two years back, much before the rest of them got down to it". Idlebrain wrote that "This film is titled as 'Nee Manasu Naaku Telusu'. But contrary to it, the lovers fail to read what is there in the other heart's when they meet each other for second time".
