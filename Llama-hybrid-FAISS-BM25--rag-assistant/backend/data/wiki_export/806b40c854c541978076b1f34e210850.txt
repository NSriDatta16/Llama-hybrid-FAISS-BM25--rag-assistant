Medical Center is a metro station in Sandy Springs, Georgia, serving the Red Line of the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) rail system. It serves the Pill Hill neighborhood of Perimeter Center, the location of Northside Hospital Atlanta (the country's busiest birthplace), St. Joseph's Hospital, and Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at Scottish Rite and DeVry University. North of Medical Center is Dunwoody station and south is Buckhead station. This station's platforms are long enough to accommodate 6-car trains.

The station is located just west of the Fulton/DeKalb County line.  The portion in DeKalb County is currently not developed and is a part of MARTA's portfolio for potential transit-oriented development.  Of note, the station was constructed in 1996 when this portion of Fulton County was unincorporated; Sandy Springs was incorporated ten years later.
