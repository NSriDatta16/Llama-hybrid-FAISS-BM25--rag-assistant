Dravida is mentioned as one of the kingdoms in the southern part of present-day mainland India during the time of the Mahabharata.

Dravida in the Mahabharata 
Dravida is listed among the ancient Indian (Bharata Varsha) kingdoms:

"In the south, are the Dravidas, the Keralas, the Mushikas, and the Vanavashikas; the Karanatakas, the Mahishakas, the Vikalpas, and also the Mushakas; the Jhillikas, the Kuntalas. (6,9)"

Origin 
The Mahabharata links the origin of Dravidas with sage Vasistha. Viswamitra, a king in the Chandravanshi Amavasu clan, attacked the cow of Vasistha. Then many armies emerged for the protection of that cow and they attacked the armies of Viswamitra.

Other kingdoms that were mentioned along with the Dravidas in this incident were Sakas, Yavanas, Savaras, Kanchis, Paundras and Kiratas, Nishada, and Sinhalas, and the barbarous kingdoms of Khasas, Chivukas, Pulindas, Chinas  Hunas with Keralas, and Mleecchas.

He also vanquished the Karnatas, Pashandas, the town of Sanjayanti, the Kalinga, the Ustrakarnikas, the city of Atavi and the city of Yavanas. (2,30)
