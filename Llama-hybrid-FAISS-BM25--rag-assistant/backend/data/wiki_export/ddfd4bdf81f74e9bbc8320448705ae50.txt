Recent activity 
In spring of 2005, heavy rainfall in Southern California recharged a local aquifer, reviving a dormant spring beneath Burroughs' house. With no support from officials in her district (Los Angeles 4th) and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, her only recourse was to install a pump and divert the thousands of gallons of water issuing from the spring to the nearest storm drain.

Burroughs recently served as a panelist for the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences' "Women in Prime" event. The forum, held on March 14, 2006, focused on ageism, sexism and other concerns of women in the entertainment industry.
