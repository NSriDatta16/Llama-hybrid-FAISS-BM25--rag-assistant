The 2007 Wimbledon Championships was a tennis tournament played on grass courts at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in Wimbledon, London in the United Kingdom. It was the 121st edition of the Wimbledon Championships and were held from 25 June to 8 July 2007. It was the third Grand Slam tennis event of the year.

Reconstruction work on Centre Court was in progress and thus it had no roof. The Wimbledon Championships adopted Hawk-Eye technology for the first time on Centre Court and Court 1. The Cyclops system was still used on other courts.

The Gentlemen's final was won by Roger Federer for the fifth consecutive time, a feat only before achieved in the Open Era by Björn Borg. It was the third longest men's singles final of all time at 3 hours and 45 minutes. Venus Williams claimed the Ladies' title by defeating Frenchwoman Marion Bartoli, a surprise finalist who had defeated world number one at the time Justine Henin. For the first time in twenty years, the Championships saw a home player win a senior title as Jamie Murray won the mixed doubles with Serbian partner Jelena Janković.

Notable stories

Comebacks
Martina Hingis had to save two match points against British wild card Naomi Cavaday on Day 1, almost repeating her first-round exit from the 2001 championships. Hingis eventually went on to win the match 6–7, 7–5, 6–0.

Janko Tipsarević beat Fernando González 6–3, 3–6, 6–3, 4–6, 8–6 to advance to the fourth round. Tipsarević was ranked 64 and González was seeded 5 but ranked 6, and saved a match point over González.

Tim Henman defeated Carlos Moyá in round 1 after going down two sets to one in a match that lasted two days with a 5th set scoreline of 13–11. Henman failed to convert 6 match points before capitalizing from a double fault by Moya on the 7th match point.

Juan Carlos Ferrero also came back, this time from two sets to none down in a match suspended for 2 days, 7–5 in the 5th set against Jan Hájek.
Nikolay Davydenko made a remarkable comeback against Chris Guccione in round 2, losing the first 2 sets before winning 3–6, 5–7, 7–6, 6–4, 6–2. It was a special comeback because Davydenko, who had a previous horrific record on grass, made it into round 3 of Wimbledon for the first time.

Serena Williams made an unbelievable comeback against Daniela Hantuchová in the fourth round. Williams cramped in the second set at 5–5, 30–15 with Hantuchová serving.  She was treated and played to a tiebreak when a rain delay halted play for almost 2 hours.  Both players came back and finished the tiebreak, which Hantuchová won.  Then in the third set, Williams started off slow but powered to a 6–2, 6–7, 6–2 win to advance to the quarterfinals against Justine Henin.

Venus Williams was almost knocked out by Alla Kudryavtseva in her first round match, when she won 2–6, 6–3, 7–5. She was down a set and possible break points before finally winning her match in three sets.

Venus Williams came back from one set all to win a match tightly against Akiko Morigami 6–2, 3–6, 7–5. Morigami had been a game away from victory, but Venus was able to take control and dismiss Morigami.

Nicole Vaidišová knocked out defending champion Amélie Mauresmo in the fourth round to reach her first Wimbledon quarterfinal.  After narrowly winning a first set tie-break and losing the second set to the title holder, Vaidišová came back to win 6–1 in the third set.

Marion Bartoli beat world number one Justine Henin in the women's singles semi-final after losing the first set 6–1 and being a break down in the second. She won the final set 6–1.
Ai Sugiyama and Katarina Srebotnik beat the top seeds Lisa Raymond and Samantha Stosur 1–6, 6–3, 6–2 after being down 6–1, 3–0 in the ladies' doubles semifinal. This was Srebotnik's first Wimbledon final and Sugiyama's fifth.
Ana Ivanovic defeated Nicole Vaidišová 4–6, 6–2, 7–5 having been down a break in the second set and saving three match points at 3–5 down in the third set.
