Backlash is the second and final studio album by British/American rock band Bad English, released in 1991.

The album peaked at No. 72 on the Billboard 200.

Critical reception
Entertainment Weekly wrote that "taken together, the album — with its unceasing references to rain and rivers — inevitably bogs down, but heard one at a time over the FM in the Ford, even its platitudes, given [John] Waite’s delivery, add up to a hack-rock miracle or two." The Rolling Stone Album Guide deemed Backlash "more spirited" than the debut.
