MOD Aberporth

The nearby range, MoD Aberporth  started out as a Second World War British Army firing range. Due to the threat of Nazi Germany invasion, the Projectile Development Establishment moved from Fort Halstead to the range during 1940, with the Royal Air Force Combined Services Projectile Development Establishment being in existence between September 1943 and January 1945. With the site being an outstation of PDE Fort Halstead and Royal Arsenal Woolwich. 

The range was previously the Aberporth Anti-Aircraft Artillery Range and the Projectile Development Range along with The Aberporth Range. The Clausen Rolling Platform was built there to test radar and launchers against the rolling motion of ships at sea, without needing to go to sea.

It is used for testing rockets by the British military, as well as for launching civilian rockets for atmospheric research. The site is currently managed by QinetiQ with air traffic services provided by NATS.
