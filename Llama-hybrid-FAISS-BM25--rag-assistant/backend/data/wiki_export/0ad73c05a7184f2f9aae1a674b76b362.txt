Mrzezino railway station is a railway station serving the village of Mrzezino, in the Pomeranian Voivodeship, Poland. The station opened on 15 December 1898 and is located on the Reda–Hel railway. The train services are operated by Przewozy Regionalne.

History
The station and the town used to be known as Sellen (Kr. Neustadt).

On 26 September 1993, the last scheduled steam passenger train operated along the line.

In 1998, the line was modernised. Stations have been equipped with a remotely controlled traffic centre from Gdynia, so that the presence of service stations along the route (in addition to the ticket offices) have become redundant.

Train services
The station is served by the following services:

Regional services (R) Władysławowo - Reda - Gdynia Główna
Regional services (R) Hel - Władysławowo - Reda - Gdynia Główna

During the summer months long-distance services also operate to/from Hel.
