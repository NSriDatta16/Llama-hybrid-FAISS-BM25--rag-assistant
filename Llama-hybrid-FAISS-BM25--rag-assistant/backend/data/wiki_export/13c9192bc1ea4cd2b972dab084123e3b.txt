SOCOM U.S. Navy SEALs: Fireteam Bravo 2 is a tactical shooter video game developed by Zipper Interactive and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for PlayStation Portable. It is the sequel to SOCOM U.S. Navy SEALs: Fireteam Bravo. This game is able to sync with the PlayStation 2 game SOCOM U.S. Navy SEALs: Combined Assault in order to unlock bonus features.

Fireteam Bravo 2 features a new campaign, multiplayer maps, and new features such as Command Equity (CE) and Local Influence (LI). Fireteam Bravo 2s campaign mode offers 14 story missions, a variety of partners including the sniper LONESTAR, and two partners codenamed BRONCO and WRAITH, a support gunner and stealth/CQC specialist, from SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs: Mobile Reco which was available for cell phones, and dynamically generated instant action missions.

The game takes place solely in the fictional country of Adjikistan. The country is supposedly situated somewhere in Central Asia near Afghanistan/Pakistan and features a number of environment and climate zones, allowing for the game to feature a wide variety of landscapes and settings while working within one large, connected story. The main adversaries throughout the game are mercenaries, often abbreviated as "mercs."

The online servers for this game, along with other PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable SOCOM titles, were shut down on August 31, 2012.
