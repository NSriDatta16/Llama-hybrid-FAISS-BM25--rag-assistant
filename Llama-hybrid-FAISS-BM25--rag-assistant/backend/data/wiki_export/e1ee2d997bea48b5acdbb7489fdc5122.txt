WJSJ-CD virtual channel 51 is a low-powered television station in Tipton, Indiana.

The station was formerly WIWU-CD, owned by Indiana Wesleyan University, until it was sold to Frank Copsidas in December 2020. As WIWU-CD, it aired local entertainment, sports, and news programming for Marion and Grant County, in addition to airing religious programming from TLN, Cornerstone Television and WHT. The sale came more than a year after Indiana Wesleyan University announced its intention to drop its broadcast operations and focus on digital services.

It was purchased by 5GTV, LLC, and is now broadcasting Paranormal TV.
