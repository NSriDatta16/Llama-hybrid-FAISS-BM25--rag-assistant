is a Japanese origami artist. Kamiya began folding at age two. Kamiya began designing origami models in 1995, and has since published hundreds of creations. Kamiya has drawn inspiration for his designs from Manga, nature, and both eastern and western mythologies.

Many of Kamiya's origami designs are complex; his Divine Dragon and Ancient Dragon models require around 275 steps each and need to be made from at least 50Â cm squares of thin paper or foil. One of his notable designs is the Ryu-Zin 3.5, an elaborate dragon covered with scales and having feelers, claws, and horns. The work can take up to one month to fold properly. This model is unique in that the crease pattern is asymmetrical yet produces a symmetrical model. 

Kamiya has written three books, including Works of Satoshi Kamiya, 1995-2003 includes diagrams of nineteen models of intermediate through complex difficulty. Kamiya's second book, Works of Satoshi Kamiya 2, 2002-2009, released in 2012, includes 16 models and is a follow-up to his debut. Although most of these were previously published in convention books and magazines, it also includes new, previously unpublished diagrams for the famous feathered, long-tailed phoenix. In June 2019, Kamiya released a third volume of his designs. This book, Works of Satoshi Kamiya 3, contains models previously published in magazines and convention books, as well as models taught in origami classes, like his Tiger and Zero Fighter.
