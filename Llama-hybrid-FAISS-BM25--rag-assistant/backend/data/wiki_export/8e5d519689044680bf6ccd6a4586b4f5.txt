History 
Miamou was first inhabited during the end of the Neolithic period. The name Miamou comes from the Greek word mia which means "one" (Greek: μία) and the Greek word omou which means "team" (Greek: Ομού). The name of Miamou possibly derives from folklore tradition. It is said that during the Middle Ages there was an epidemic which forced several villagers to abandon their settlements and go to the village which was not affected by it. That village is now called Miamou. In 1583, it had 204 inhabitants (Kastrofylakas, vol. 12, pg. 103) and was known as Miamú.
