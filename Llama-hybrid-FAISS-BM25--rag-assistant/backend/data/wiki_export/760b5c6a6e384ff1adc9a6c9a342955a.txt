Uebeschi is a municipality in the administrative district of Thun in the canton of Bern in Switzerland.

History
Uebeschi is first mentioned in 1233 as Ibisshe.

The oldest traces of settlements in the area come from scattered neolithic and Bronze Age artifacts.  Part of a wall, ceramic floor tiles, a stone path and coins have been found from the Roman era, indicating that there was a small settlement in the area.

During the Middle Ages the village was part of the court and parish of Thierachern in the Strättligen Herrschaft.  While there is a Ministerialis (unfree knights in the service of a feudal overlord) family von Uebeschi, there are no records that connect them to the village.  In 1417 the village was donated to the mendicant Franciscan friars in Bern.  In 1528 Bern adopted the new faith of the Protestant Reformation and secularized all the property of the friars.  Under Bernese rule, Uebeschi became part of the low court of Amsoldingen in the district of Thun.

Traditionally the village economy relied on farming and raising cattle.  Today, agriculture remains important but about half of the working population commutes to jobs in Bern, Thun or other nearby towns.
