Saxeten is a municipality in the Interlaken-Oberhasli administrative district in the canton of Bern in Switzerland.

In 1999 it was the site of an incident where 21 tourists and local canyon guides were killed in a flash flood in Saxetenbach canyon.

History
Saxeten is first mentioned in 1303 as Sachsaton.

During the Middle Ages, the Saxetenbach valley belonged to the Unspunnen Herrschaft.  During the 13th century the Freiherr of Weissenburg inherited a half share of the village from Unspunnen.  In 1334, Weissenburg sold his share to Interlaken Abbey.  The other half share remained with Unspunnen.  In 1348–49, the village joined an unsuccessful rebellion of the Bernese Oberland against the Abbey.  In 1500, the Unspunnen half of the village was acquired by the city of Bern.  In 1528, the city of Bern adopted the new faith of the Protestant Reformation and began imposing it on the Bernese Oberland.  Iseltwald joined many other villages and the Abbey in an unsuccessful rebellion against the new faith.  After Bern imposed its will on the Oberland, they secularized the Abbey and annexed all the Abbey lands, finally combining the two shares of the village.

Saxeten has always been part of the large parish of Gsteig bei Interlaken, now a village in the municipality of Gsteigwiler.

Today the local economy is built on seasonal alpine farming and herding and some tourism.

Saxetenbach Disaster
On 27 July 1999, there was an accident in the Saxetenbach Gorge, just above the village of Saxeten, in which 21 young people from Australia, New Zealand, England, South Africa, and Switzerland died.

48 people from 2 coach tour parties had opted to do a side activity of canyoning where you float, swim and climb through an area, such as a gorge.  It was organized by Adventure World, a now defunct company who were located in Wilderswil, not far from Saxeten.

At 6pm, flash floods began pouring through the gorge and 21 people within the group were swept to their deaths.  18 were tourists and 3 were canyon guides.  By 7pm, the stories had hit the world's news screens, and the hotels people were staying in were bombarded with phone calls, but the staff only saw what was on television.

The survivors were rescued and then questioned by Swiss Polizei before being released and returned to their hotel at 1am the next morning.  Until then they had no idea how many people had died nor the enormity of the disaster.

Identifying the dead bodies was a serious problem for the Swiss authorities, the bodies were badly traumatized.  11 survivors opted to go and identify the dead at the mortuary, but many had to be identified through DNA and dental analysis.

Families were desperate to see for themselves what had happened, and Swissair along with Swiss medical services provided meet & greet sessions for families, and also much counseling for those who had been present.

Bodies of the dead washed up in Lake Brienz, a popular boating lake during peak Summer tourist season.

Since the incident, there has been much rumor released into the press about what happened.  Emergency services claim they sent someone to tell the group of the impending storms, and families of the dead claim that the company should have seen the signs of the weather.  Swiss authorities were quick to blame profit making and general negligence as the cause of the accident.

After the disaster, Adventure World went out of business.  Their former premises, near the Wilderswil Station, are now occupied by a bank.  In 2001, some of the staff at Adventure World were charged in connection to the deaths.  A total of six staff members were found guilty of manslaughter through culpable negligence and given suspended sentences of between two and five months and fined between 4,000 and 7,500 CHF.
