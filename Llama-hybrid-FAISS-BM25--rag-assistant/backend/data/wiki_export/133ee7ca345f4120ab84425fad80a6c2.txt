The first head Choristors of Tudor House were C.J.R. Arnott and J.B.C.Egan (1954).

The wall going through the garden next to the hall was built to be a memorial wall but was never finished.

In 2008–09 the Upper School classrooms changed to fully air-conditioned classrooms, with smartboards and new desks, chairs and workrooms. There are currently six classrooms in the Upper School.

In 2010 the boarding house – Medley – began a program of renovation, with open dormitories styled by Richard Allen and developed by Property Overseer Peter Burgoyne. The program includes relics from the past adorning the walls. Technology has also been incorporated with softer downlights and an audio system for each dormitory, allowing for audio books, podcasts and radio.

In 2010 a new library was completed, on the old Meyer House boarding house site. Meyer House was relocated near the tennis court and now operates as a boarding residence for parents.

The new library includes a Scholarship Classroom, Staffroom, Lecture theatre with video conferencing, interactive whiteboards, small cinema, a computer lab and glass throughout connecting the learning environment with the Wilderness space.

The playground courtyard of the Infants area was renovated with a new sandpit, play equipment focusing on concrete pipes, logs and rocks, and a 1953 Vauxhall Ute (donated by Denham Construction).

A new chicken coop was constructed, and the school now enjoys eggs from free-range hens.

In 2011, a new playspace and front of school was initiated with a focus on accessing the academic precinct. This area restores the old Meyer Oval for open play. A sandstone wall was constructed to distinguish the entry to Tudor House.

Over the 2012 Christmas holidays, the old kitchen facilities were totally renovated, providing a boys' cooking classroom alongside the commercial kitchen.

Recently, the school received an upgrade to their shower & toilet facilities for boarders.
