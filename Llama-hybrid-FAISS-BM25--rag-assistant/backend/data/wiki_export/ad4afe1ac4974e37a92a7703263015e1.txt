The Livingston Range is a mountain range located primarily in Glacier National Park in the U.S. state of Montana, and in the extreme southeastern section of the Canadian province of British Columbia. The range is  long and  wide. Over 15 summits exceed  above sea level, and the highest point is Kintla Peak at . (While these elevations are not particularly high for North American mountains, they are high compared to the roughly 4,000 foot (1,200 m) elevation of the nearby valleys, making for particularly dramatic peaks.)

The Livingston Range was initially uplifted beginning 170Â million years ago when the Lewis Overthrust fault pushed an enormous slap of precambrian rocks  thick,  wide and  long over newer rocks of the cretaceous period.
