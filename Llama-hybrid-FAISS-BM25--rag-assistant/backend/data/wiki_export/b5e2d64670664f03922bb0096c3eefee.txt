It serves the Las Margaritas and Mazurén neighborhoods.

History
After the opening of the Portal de Usme in early 2001, the Autopista Norte line was opened. This station was added as a northerly expansion of that line, which was completed with the opening of the Portal del Norte later that year.

The station is named Mazurén due to its proximity to the Centro Comercial Mazurén and the Mazurén residential area. Also near the station are the Liceo de Cervantes and Calle 153.
