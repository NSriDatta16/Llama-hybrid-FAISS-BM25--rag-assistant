Works

Roswell High
Roswell High is a young adult book series written by Melinda Metz and published by Pocket Books. The 10-book series chronicles the adventures of three teen aliens and their human friends, who attend the fictional Ulysses F. Olsen High in Roswell, New Mexico. The Roswell High books served as inspiration for the television series Roswell (1999â€“2002), also known as Roswell High in some countries, which in turn spawned a number of spin-off books of its own. The second adaptation was re-imagining for the television series Roswell, New Mexico.
