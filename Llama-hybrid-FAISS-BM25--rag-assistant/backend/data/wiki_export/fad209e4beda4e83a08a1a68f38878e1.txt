Kumara Pit
To the northern end of Hukanui Road, there is an archaeological kumara pit. The pit is 2m deep and 8m wide in a circle shape. The pits were made by Maori who used the dug out sand and gravel to cover growing kumara plants. The sand conducted heat to make an artificial tropical climate for the kumara plants which naturally grow in Southern America. Because of the archaeological significance of these pits, the construction of the Wairere Drive/Hukanui Road intersection was made so that the pits would not be affected.
