Born in Millburn, New Jersey, he joined the New York East Annual Conference of the M.E. Church in 1893.  Prior to his election to the episcopacy, he served as a pastor and as the secretary of Evangelism of the M.E. Church

As bishop he was assigned the Cincinnati Episcopal Area, making many episcopal visits throughout this area (which included Ohio and Kentucky).  Among these visits was one to the LeRoy Methodist Episcopal Church in LeRoy, Ohio (now Westfield Center, Ohio) in 1923 for the dedication of their new church building.
