Wu Daxin or Wu Ta-hsin (1933–2005) was a Chinese tai chi teacher who lived most of his life in Hong Kong. He was the great-grandson Wu-style tai chi founder Wu Quanyou and the grandson of the well-known teacher Wu Jianquan. He directed the Wu family's lineage for four years from the Wu family headquarters in Hong Kong after the death of his cousin Wu Yanxia.

Biography
Born into a Manchu military family known for their contributions towards preserving knowledge of the traditional Chinese martial arts, Wu Daxin endured strict training from his grandfather Wu Jianquan, uncle Wu Gongyi and father Wu Kung-tsao. He eventually became known as a teacher and for his expertise with the tai chi sabre and sword as well as for his qigong and pushing hands skills.
 
When Wu Gongyi moved with his family to Hong Kong in the 1940s, Wu Daxin assisted him in the promotion and teaching of tai chi. During the 1950s, at the direction of Wu Gongyi, Wu Daxin and his cousins Wu Ta-k'uei and Wu Daqi often travelled to Malaysia and Singapore to start and manage several Wu style academies. Later in his life, he also travelled extensively to North America, teaching tai chi in Toronto, Detroit and Vancouver.
