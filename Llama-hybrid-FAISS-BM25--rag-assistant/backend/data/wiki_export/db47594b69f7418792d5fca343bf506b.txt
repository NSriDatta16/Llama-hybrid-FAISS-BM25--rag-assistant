History
The current building in which houses Lehman today was built in 1954 as Holy Angels High School and five additional classrooms were added in 1965. In 1970 a second building for a football locker room and bus garage was constructed, and later in the fall Holy Angels and Piqua Catholic High School joined to form Lehman Catholic High School. A few more projects were completed, such as the construction of an observatory with a  Newtonian Telescope in 1993, and a  gymnasium, a computer center, updated science labs, media center and facilities for music in 1997.  Recently, Lehman has undergone Renovation for STEM+MM along with the addition of new classes starting in the summer of 2016, and is expected to be completed in 2017-2018.

Extracurriculars

Athletics play an integral role in the life of Lehman students.  The school fields 18 varsity sports including:  Soccer (men's & women's), volleyball (women's), football, Tennis (men's & women's), Cross-Country (men's & women's), Basketball (men's & women's), Swimming/Diving (men's & women's), Track (men's & women's), Softball, Baseball, Wrestling, and Golf (men's).  The school's mascot, the Cavalier has been in use since the school's merger in July 1970. Prior to the consolidation, the Cavaliers were the name of the former Piqua Catholic High School's football, basketball and baseball teams while the former Sidney Holy Angels High School basketball and baseball teams were known as the Wings. The original Cavalier logo was inspired by a drawn caricature in 1950 depicting Jose Ferrer as Cyrano de Bergerac noted especially for its long nose. It was used throughout the 1950s and 1960s by the former Piqua Catholic and was later incorporated during Lehman's early years. The current logo is an image of a blue broad brimmed hat above two criss-crossed swords fronted by the team's emblem...with a secondary logo, the gold colored letters "LC" (interconnected with each other) with a royal blue background is used in sporting gear such as football helmets, polo shirts, ballcaps and related promotional items.
Lehman's music program includes its marching and concert bands and the Lehman Limelighters song and dance troupe. Katie Welch is the current director.
