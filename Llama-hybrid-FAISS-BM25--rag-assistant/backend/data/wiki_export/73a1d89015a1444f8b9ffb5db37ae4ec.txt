Professional career

NBA years
After attending the University of Central Oklahoma, Robinson signed as an undrafted free agent with the NBA's Charlotte Hornets in 1999.  Known primarily for his leaping ability and athleticism, he averaged 7.2 points per game over two seasons as a reserve with the Hornets and attracted the attention of Chicago Bulls GM Jerry Krause, who felt that Robinson could become a star if given more playing time.  Krause signed Robinson to a 5-year, US$30 million contract in 2001.  In 2004, John Paxson, who replaced Krause as Bulls' general manager in 2003, convinced Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf to buy out the last two years of Robinson's contract. Robinson played his final NBA game on March 31, 2004 against the Orlando Magic.

On November 2, 2006 Robinson was selected by the Idaho Stampede with the 16th overall pick in the 2006 NBDL Draft. In the 2006-07 season Robinson averaged more than 15 points for the Idaho Stampede. After the season, he was released. On November 7, 2008, he was selected with the 14th pick in the fifth round of the 2008 NBA D-League Draft by the Albuquerque Thunderbirds. However, he did not come to a contract agreement.
