Synopsis
Christopher and Adriana meet Christopher's cousin Greg and Greg's fiancée Amy. Amy, who is working with Jon Favreau on a film project in New York City, has been eager to meet Christopher and read his screenplay, saying that mob films are popular. She quickly becomes attracted to him. Adriana has kept a copy of the screenplay Christopher threw away and persuades him to pass it to Jon and Amy. Christopher and Adriana are invited to the film set, but he goes alone. He is absorbed by what he sees and makes a dialogue suggestion that Jon adopts.

Jon wants to learn about mob customs and speech from Christopher. Christopher comes as arranged to meet him at his hotel room but he is not available, so Christopher calls on Amy instead. They talk, she begins to give advice about screenwriting, and they end up having sex. A few days later he sees her at the hotel and they go to her room to have sex again, but afterward, she is overcome by guilt. 

Christopher finds a screenplay by Jon and sees that he has stolen a mob anecdote that Christopher told him in confidence. Enraged, Christopher searches for him, but learns he has returned to California. In the following days, Amy does not reply to his messages. When he finally tracks her down; she tells him that Hollywood has lost interest in mob films and, "It was wrong, with us." In a heated argument, he calls her a "D-Girl". She replies that she is a vice president and walks away.

A.J. takes his mother's car without permission and damages it. When his parents rebuke him, he baffles them by stating that life is absurd and he does not wish to be confirmed because "God is dead." Tony consults Pussy, who is A.J.'s godfather and confirmation sponsor; Pussy says that at that age "they get broody." Tony consults Dr. Melfi, who explains that A.J. has discovered existentialism. A.J. consults his grandmother Livia, who tells him not to expect happiness and that everyone dies alone; "It's all a big nothing."

Pussy is forced by the FBI to wear a wire at A.J.'s confirmation and the ensuing reception at the Soprano residence. During the reception, Tony discovers A.J. and two friends smoking marijuana in the garage. Pussy goes up to A.J.'s room, where he is sulking, and gently tells him that his father is a good man; A.J. is young and should enjoy life. He hugs him and sends him back down to the party, but Pussy himself goes into the bathroom and sobs.

Adriana has inadvertently told Tony about Christopher's screenwriting. Christopher misses the confirmation ceremony and arrives late for the reception. Tony then tells him he has a choice: either follow his other interests (and never see him again) or give up his interests and completely commit himself to Tony. Christopher goes out and thinks it over, then goes back inside to Tony and the mob.
