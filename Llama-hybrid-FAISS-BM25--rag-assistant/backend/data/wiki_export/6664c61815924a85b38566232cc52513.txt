The German national cricket team is the men's team that represents the country of Germany in international cricket. The German Cricket Federation, which organises the team, has been an associate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) since 1999, having previously been an affiliate member from 1991. The national team made its international debut against Denmark in 1989, playing as West Germany. It has since played regularly in European Cricket Championship tournaments, as well as twice in the lower divisions of the World Cricket League. In 2001, Germany also competed in the ICC Trophy (now the World Cup Qualifier) for the first and only time. In 2022, they played their first T20 World Cup Global Qualifier.

History

Germany became an affiliate member of the ICC in 1991. As West Germany, the country had played its first internationals in 1989, a two-match series against Denmark. The team made its international tournament debut in 1990, at the European Cricketer Cup in Guernsey. They hosted that tournament (which had been renamed the European Nations Cup) in 1996, playing against France, Portugal, and Sweden, and finished as runners up in the 1997 tournament after losing to France by one run in the final, the winning run being scored by David Bordes whilst he had a skull fracture. The Wisden Cricketers' Almanack later listed the final as one of the 100 best matches of the 20th century.

In 1998, Germany competed in the European Championship for the first time and finished seventh. They became an associate member of the ICC the following year and played in Division Two of the European Championship in 2000, finishing as runners-up to Gibraltar.

They played at the 2001 ICC Trophy in Canada, their first and, to date, only appearance in the ICC Trophy. They failed to progress beyond the first round and again finished as runners up to Gibraltar in Division Two of the European Championship the following year. They also played in Division Two in 2004, finishing third, and in 2006, again finishing third.

2018–Present
In April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Germany and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 will be a full T20I.

In September 2018, Germany qualified from Group A of the 2018–19 ICC World Twenty20 Europe Qualifier to the Regional Finals of the tournament.

Germany played their first Twenty20 Internationals in May 2019, when they travelled to Brussels for three matches against Belgium, and then two matches against Italy in the Netherlands later the same month. These matches provided the team with some preparation ahead of the ICC World T20 European regional qualifier finals that were played in June 2019.
