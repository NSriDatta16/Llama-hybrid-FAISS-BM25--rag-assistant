Into the New is a studio album by the American band Vallejo, released in 2000.

It was the band's first album after signing with Emilio Estefan.

Critical reception
The Austin Chronicle wrote that it's "not that Vallejo don't have their own sound. They do. One that sounds like 30 years of classic rock radio." Texas Monthly thought that "the hooks are heavy, the power ballads are surprisingly sensitive, and the Latin percussion and Santana-inspired workouts are fluid and funky." The Morning Call wrote that "the tepid yowling, forced funkiness, grunge-lite posturing and jam-band jive that pockmarks Into The New will make you want to kick sand in Vallejo's face."
