The Texas Rangers Radio Network has stations in Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana and Oklahoma. The flagship station is 105.3 KRLD-FM The Fan in Dallas. When a Rangers game conflicts with other coverage on KRLD-FM, the baseball game moves to AM 1080 KRLD. Games have aired on Spanish radio stations KESS from 1991 to 2010, KZMP from 2011 to 2016, and KFLC since 2017. Games are also heard on other Spanish-language radio stations in Texas and Arkansas. Texas Rangers games currently air on the regional television network Bally Sports Southwest. Games also previously aired in Spanish on television station Canal de Teja.
