Brisbane City Football Club is an Australian semi-professional football club based in Newmarket, Brisbane, Queensland. Founded in 1952, the club competed in the National Soccer League until the 1986 season where they were relegated back to State League Competition. Brisbane City competed in the National Premier Leagues Queensland from 2013, until they were relegated to the lower tier Football Queensland Premier League with one match remaining in the 2020 season. They then won 20 out of 20 matches in the 2021 season to earn immediate promotion back to the National Premier Leagues Queensland. Home matches are played at Spencer Park.

National Soccer League
In 1977 City became a foundation member of the National Soccer League. City's first match was a 0–1 defeat to Marconi at Perry Park on 3 April 1977 in front of a crowd of 5,214.

Despite struggling in the first two seasons, including finishing bottom, they won the NSL Cup in those two years. In 1977 City defeated Marconi 5–3 on penalties after a 1–1 draw, and the following year they overcame Adelaide City 2–1. Both matches were played in Brisbane. City's third NSL season saw a much improved 4th-place finish which saw them qualify for the Top Four round robin series where they reached the Grand Final, losing to Sydney City 2–1 on aggregate.

1980 saw a reversal in fortunes with only four league wins recorded, but 1981 saw a battle for the NSL title, eventually finishing third, 8 points behind Champions Sydney City, with striker Paul Wilkinson weighing in with 12 goals. In those days the NSL compelled clubs to change any ethnic titles in their name, and as such City were occasionally referred to as Brisbane Gladiators around this time.

The following two seasons were a struggle, bottom of the table in 1982 was followed by third bottom in 1983, with city rivals Brisbane Lions bottom. It was tough times for NSL football in the city. For the following three seasons the NSL was increased in size but divided into two Conferences, with City finding themselves in the Southern Division alongside the Melbourne and Adelaide clubs. Fortunes didn't improve however and in 1987 with a return to a single division NSL and a reduction in clubs, City were relegated along with Brisbane Lions to the Queensland State League where they remain today bringing to an end ten successive seasons at national level.

The last NSL match at Spencer Park took place on 8 September 1986, a 0–0 draw with Sunshine George Cross in front of only 838 fans
