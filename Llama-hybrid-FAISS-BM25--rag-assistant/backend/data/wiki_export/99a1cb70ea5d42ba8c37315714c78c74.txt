Overview
Borg was the home of a Viking chieftain over 1,000 years ago. Today, Borg is the location of Lofotr, a living museum of the Viking chieftain's village.  This is the site of a reconstruction of one of the main buildings as well as visible remains within the archaeological excavation sites.

The area around Borg has many horses, most of which are Nordlandshester.
