In 1994, Kennedy attended the NSW State Open Short-Course Championships in Sydney. She set a record in every 50m and 100m event in the program, achieving 11 records in total.

Kennedy broke the world record in the 100m butterfly at the World Short-Course Swimming Championships in 1995, however was beaten in the event by fellow Australian Susie O'Neill (who took silver), and Liu Limin of China (who won gold).

She swam for most of her career at the Telopea Swimming Club in Canberra, Australia under the direction of former Australian butterfly coach Peter Freney. She was teammates to Australian representative and University of Nevada scholarship holder Anthony Rogis, Australian representative Chloe Flutter and Syracuse University scholarship holders Francis Williams and Ben Henri. She moved to Queensland in 1995 and was then coached by Scott Volkers.
