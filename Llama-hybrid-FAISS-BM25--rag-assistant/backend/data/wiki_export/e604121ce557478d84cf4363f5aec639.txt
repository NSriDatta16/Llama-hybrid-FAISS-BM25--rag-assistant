"Crash" is a song by English indie pop band the Primitives, written by band members Paul Court, Steve Dullaghan, and Tracy Cattell. The song was first recorded for the band's 1988 debut album, Lovely. "Crash" was released as a single in February 1988, peaking at number five on UK Singles Chart, number three on the US Modern Rock Tracks chart, and number two on the Swedish Singles Chart.

In 1994, the song was featured on the Dumb & Dumber movie soundtrack as "Crash (The '95 Mix)". This remix included additional guitars, percussion, organ, and backing vocals—none of which were performed by any of the Primitives. Several cover versions are based on the '95 Mix rather than the original.
