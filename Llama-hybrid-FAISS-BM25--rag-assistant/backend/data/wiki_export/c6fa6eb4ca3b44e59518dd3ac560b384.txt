Story

Yū Morisawa is an ordinary 10-year-old girl, until she sees a spaceship floating in the sky. Carried into the ship, she helps a friendly alien called Pino Pino find the Feather Star. In thanks for her assistance he grants her a magical wand, which allows her to transform into a 16-year-old girl, for one year. She is also given two cats from Feather Star, Posi and Nega, who are to watch over her while she has magical powers. While wandering around the city as a teenager, she accidentally ends up on TV and asked to sing, which the magic enables her to do remarkably well. Using the alias of Creamy Mami, she becomes an overnight success, and is soon sought to begin a professional career as an idol under Parthenon Productions. Along the way, she also meets past residents of Feather Star and supernatural beings. In addition, she must fight against Snake Joe, a shady character of the rival LP Productions, who is always trying to steal her away and Megumi-chan, another one of Parthenon Productions' top stars.

Characters
  / 
 
 A normal 10-year-old girl, Yū harbours a secret crush for her childhood friend Toshio Ōtomo. Given the ability to transform into a 16-year-old girl, she is made to fill in for the absent Megumi Ayase to sing on TV. Naming herself Creamy Mami, she becomes an overnight hit. Throughout the series, it is a running gag for Mami to frequently be late for appearances like concerts, television filmings, and signings, only to always make it perfectly in the nick of time.

 
 
 A cat-shaped creature from the Feathery Star, he is asked to watch over Yū Morisawa while she has magical powers. His name is short for negative. Nega was the one who taught Yū the spell which allows her to transform into Creamy Mami, and he also secretly knows many more spells, but is against teaching them to Yu, lest uses magic for self gain. Despite this, once Yū tricked him into saying the magical words to generate a pen which can answer any school question. Despite his brash attitude, he is really fond of Yu.

Yu and Toshio later travel to Feathery Star where Pino-Pino offers to restore Yu's powers in exchange for Toshio's memory of Yu using magic, to which he agrees. Later, he finds a tape of him recording the incident and begins to remember. In the end he finally understands that Mami was Yū all long and that he was in love with Yū all this time. In episode 47, Toshio says that he is 14, making him presumably 13 at the beginning of the series.

 A boy from a small village in Hokkaido who recently got transferred to Yû's school. He seems to be pretty rude at first, but later becomes friends with Yû due to his huge love for her cats. He says he can understand nature and is one of the few people who realized Nega and Posi aren't normal cats. Due to his upbringing, he is rather ignorant about big cities and is generally pretty outdated with news, to the point of ignoring who Creamy Mami is. Despite being a recurrimg character, Mamoru never has any real interation with Mami.

Impact and influence
Along with Wandering Sun (1971) and Super Dimensional Fortress Macross (1982),Creamy Mami is known as a pioneer of the new marketing strategy, now known as media mix.
They used an anime to promote a new, least-known idol singer.
The real idol singer, Takako Ōta, acted as an idol singer (Creamy Mami) also in the story.
The opening theme Delicate ni Suki Shite was her first song in the real world too.
Even though Ohta was a new singer and not a trained voice actress, she voiced Yū/Creamy Mami.
The result was a great success.
The anime Creamy Mami has become famous and Ohta gained a high popularity that still exists today.
In 1999, Fuji TV's show Kaishingeki TV Utaemon had a poll to decide the most popular old TV theme song for a 25-year-old audience, and Delicate ni Suki Shite was ranked first. This anime has been repeatedly broadcast over the Internet too.
As of writing (2006-08-08), people in Japan can legally watch the show on-demand for free on GyaO.

The same media mix approach was seen in Idol Densetsu Eriko (1989) and Idol Tenshi Youkoso Yōko (1990).
The anime version of Full Moon o Sagashite (2002) shared the same format too.
Another example is Lemon Angel (1987).
Using an anime to promote a singer was not a new concept, as there was Pink Lady Monogatari (1978), a popular anime at the time.

Creamy Mami set the format that would be used for future Studio Pierrot magical girl titles, and was especially influential in Fancy Lala. Creamy Mami also stars in Adesugata Mahou no Sannin Musume, along with Magical Emi and Persia, as well as Majokko Club Yoningumi A-Kukan Kara no Alien X, with Magical Emi, Persia and Pastel Yumi. The popularity of the series not only saw two feature-length sequels, but Creamy Mami also featured in five music video-based productions, starting with the 1985 OVA Lovely Serenade. The second of the feature-length sequels, Magical Angel Creamy Mami Long Goodbye, began with the short animation Mahō no Tenshi Creamy Mami VS Mahō no Princess Minky Momo Gekijou no Daikessen, and where Creamy Mami battled against Ashi Productions' Minky Momo.

Creamy Mami's companions Posi and Nega were also parodied in Gainax's 1991 OAV Otaku no Video, in which Misty May (the magical girl character created by the series' protagonist) has two lion cub companions named Posi-King and Nega-King. (The character design for both is based on King the lion cub, a companion of the title character in Gainax's 1990 TV series Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water.)

Producer Yuji Nunokawa noted that there was a substantial increase in male fans after Creamy Mami'''s broadcast due to the shows' use of transformations and enjoyed watching girls using magic to solve their problems in ways men traditionally could not.

A spin-off manga series titled, Magical Angel Creamy Mami and the Spoiled Princess, was launched Coamix's Comic Tatan website on December 21, 2018. The series is written and illustrated by Emi Mitsuki. The series focuses on the character, Megumi Ayase. The series was released in North America in March 2021 by Seven Seas Entertainment.

InternationalizationMagical Angel Creamy Mami was dubbed into Italian by Studio PV, who released it as L'incantevole Creamy from 1985-02-03. It was also broadcast in France by La Cinq (later on TMC, AB1 and Manga) as Creamy, merveilleuse Creamy from April 29, 1988, and more recently released in French DVD editions (French dub or Japanese and French subtitles) by Declic Image. It was also distributed in Spain as "El Broche Encantado" in 1992.

In these countries the musical theme was the same: in Italy it was sung by Cristina D'Avena, in France by Claude Lombard and in Spain by Soledad "Sol" Pilas.

The text and music were by Alessandra Valeri Manera - Giordano Bruno Martelli.

The musical base was partially re-orchestrated in France and Spain, and the text was translated and adapted by Charles Level for the French version.

It was dubbed into Cantonese by a Hong Kong TV Station - TVB, who released it as "我係小忌廉" (I am Creamy Mami) from January 7, 1985 showing it from Monday to Friday at 6pm, each time shown half an hour.

Harmony Gold USA (the company best known for the Robotech adaptation) was planning an English dubbed version under the name Pretty Creamy the Perfect Pop Star'', but it never saw the light of day. Had it ever been released in English, most of the characters' names would have to be changed to target an English-speaking audience.
