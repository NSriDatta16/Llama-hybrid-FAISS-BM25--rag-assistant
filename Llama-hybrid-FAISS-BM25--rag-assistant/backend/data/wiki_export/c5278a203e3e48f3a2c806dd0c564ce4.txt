The Kroger 200 was a race for the NASCAR Xfinity Series (formerly known as the Nationwide Series) which took place at Lucas Oil Raceway at Indianapolis in Clermont, Indiana.

It originally debuted as a summer night race, and was the only major NASCAR event in the state of Indiana. In previous years, USAC stock car races were held at the facility, although the two events were not associated.

In 1994, the Kroger 200 was moved to the night before the Winston Cup Series' Brickyard 400 at the nearby Indianapolis Motor Speedway. It appropriately began serving as an unofficial support race for larger Speedway's event. From 1994 to 2000, it was held on Friday night. Beginning in 2001, when the Brickyard 400 moved to Sundays, this race was held on Saturday night.

From 1995 to 2011, the race was held as a doubleheader weekend with the Truck Series AAA Insurance 200.

The race was sponsored by Kroger during its entire existence from 1982 to 2011.

In 2011, the race was held for the last time in the foreseeable future. Starting in 2012, the Nationwide Series moved to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway for the Indiana 250. An ARCA race took its place.

USAC Stock Car race
The USAC Stock Car series ran several races at IRP. Some races were held on the oval, while some were on the 2.5-mile road course. The Yankee 300, in most years held on the last weekend of April or first weekend of May, was run on the road course, and was held in high prestige for a short time. It served as an unofficial kickoff to the month of May, and sometimes attracted NASCAR regulars.
