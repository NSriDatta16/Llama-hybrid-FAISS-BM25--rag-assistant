The McLeod Center is a 7,018-seat multi-purpose arena on the campus of the University of Northern Iowa (UNI) in Cedar Falls, Iowa, USA, currently housing the university's teams in men's and women's basketball, and women's volleyball. The arena opened on November 18, 2006, with a volleyball game against Bradley. The other three UNI teams made their debuts in the facility over the next three days — men's basketball versus Milwaukee on November 19, women's basketball against Iowa State on November 20, and wrestling versus Iowa on November 21.

The McLeod Center replaced the UNI-Dome as the home of the university's basketball teams and West Gymnasium as the home of the volleyball and wrestling teams (the wrestling squad moved back to the West Gym after the 2007-2008 season). The McLeod Center is located on the west end of the campus, directly south of the UNI-Dome and connected by a covered walkway that also houses an extensive athletic hall of fame.

A video board is located on the south wall with home and visiting team scoreboards on either side showing the players' game information. There are two scoreboards on the north side and ribbon boards above the concession stands on the east and west sides.

Since opening, the arena has had quite a significant positive economic impact for the university. It brings in $20–25 million annually, doubled the attendance of basketball games, and has almost 400,000 visitors a year.

The arena also hosts commencement ceremonies throughout the year and can be used for recreation upon request.

During the 2009-2010, 2014-2015, and 2019-2020 men's basketball seasons, the team was undefeated at the McLeod Center.

For the first time in venue history, they sold out every seat for a women's basketball game against Iowa on November 12, 2023. This was primarily because of Hawkeye phenom Caitlin Clark.
