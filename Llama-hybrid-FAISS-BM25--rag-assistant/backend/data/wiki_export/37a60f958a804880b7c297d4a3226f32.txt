BBC Sound Effects No. 26: Sci-Fi Sound Effects is a 1981 compilation of sound effects and atmospheres created by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. It was the second in the BBC Sound Effects series to be credited to the Workshop. It featured sounds from popular television series Doctor Who (all from Season 18) and Blake's 7, as well as effects for the first series of the radio versions of Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and James Follett's Earthsearch. In 1991 it was re-released on CD as Essential Science Fiction Sound Effects Vol. 1. Reissued on CD with its original title and cover as part of AudioGo's "Vintage Beeb" line 4 April 2013.

Although seemingly a compilation of merely incidental effects, the album influenced pioneering electronic band The Orb enough for them to name their 1989 single "A Huge Ever Growing Pulsating Brain That Rules from the Centre of the Ultraworld" after one of its tracks.
