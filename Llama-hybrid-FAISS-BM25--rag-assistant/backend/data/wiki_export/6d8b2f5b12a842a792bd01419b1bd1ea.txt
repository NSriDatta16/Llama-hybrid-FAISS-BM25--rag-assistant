"You'll Never Be Alone" is a song by American recording artist Anastacia from her second studio album, Freak of Nature (2001). Co-written with and produced by Louis Biancaniello and Sam Watters, the ballad was released in Europe as the album's fifth and final single in November 2002. Though it was not released in the United States, it still managed to chart on the Adult Contemporary chart at number twenty-eight.

Recording and production 
"You'll Never Be Alone" was written by Anastacia and co-written and produced by Louis Biancaniello and Sam Watters. It was recorded at Homesite 13 in Novato, California, Ocean Way Recording in Los Angeles, and Right Track Recording in New York City.

Critical reception 
Jose F. Promis wrote for AllMusic that "When Anastacia slows down the tempo for the ballads (some organic and acoustic, some bordering on power ballads), she succeeds by utilizing her strong vocal chops without venturing into vocal histrionics." Louis Pattison from NME wrote that the song "drips like Celine Dion dipped in honey. Yahoo! Music's James Salmon called it "an insipid halt", while Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani named it "syrupy".

Music video
Shot in Los Angeles, the music video for "You'll Never Be Alone" was Anastacia's second to be directed by Mike Lipscombe, the first being "Why'd You Lie to Me". The video was later included on her first music DVD The Video Collection. When the video begins, Anastacia is standing in front of the camera singing the song. As the camera leaves, she and her boyfriend are shown cuddling in front of her boyfriend's house. After saying goodbye, she drives away. On her way presumably home, gray wolves are crossing the road, causing the car to get off the road. After hitting a tree, her "spirit leaves her body" to warn her boyfriend that she has been in an accident. Back at the boyfriend's house, his dog senses the spirit's presence and he wakes up his master. In the meantime, Anastacia's spirit guides them to the place where the accident happened, without him knowing the spirit is there. Together they arrive at the car, when the spirit goes back into the real body and the boyfriend carries her body back to the road. At the end, her boyfriend carries her into the ambulance.
