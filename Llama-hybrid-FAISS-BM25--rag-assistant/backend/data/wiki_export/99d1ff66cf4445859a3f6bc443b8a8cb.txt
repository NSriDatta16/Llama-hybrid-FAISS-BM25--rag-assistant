History

The first European settlers arrived from Scotland in 1755. The first arrivals were the Duthie brothers, George and John Duthie and their families. Their descendants still reside in the area today. It is one of the very few remaining municipalities on the Gaspé which still has a relatively large English-speaking population. It was originally a centre of farming, logging, and shipbuilding. In 1940 it was a German base for submarine.

Industry 
The town experienced considerable growth in the 1960s with the development of a linerboard paper mill by Bathurst paper, which became Consolidated Bathurst and after a number of name changes Smurfit Stone. Economic downturns in the region brought a reduction in mill operations and many residents left for other regions. In 2005 the mill completely shut down, leaving the town with no major industry.

There is a large wharf located to the east of the town. This was built to service cargo ships that would arrive to be loaded with kraft paper or bunker oil. It is now mainly recreational.

The town has a British Heritage Museum. There is a small shopping centre as well as an indoor swimming pool, a hockey arena, and a theatre.

Education 
There is an English-language school (New Richmond High School) located in the centre of town which serves now grades K-11. French-speaking children have their own school (Bois Vivant) and complete high school in the town of Carleton.
