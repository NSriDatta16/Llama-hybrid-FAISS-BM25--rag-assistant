Admiral Philip Affleck (  December 21, 1799) was an admiral in the Royal Navy. He was the younger brother of Sir Edmund Affleck. Affleck held various commands throughout the latter half of the 18th Century, most notably as commander-in-chief of the Jamaica Station and as a Lord of the Board of Admiralty. Early in his career he fought at the Siege of Louisbourg where he was promoted commander after carrying out a successful cutting-out mission. He was promoted to post-captain a year later after impressing Admiral Edward Boscawen during the Battle of Lagos. Later in his career he joined Admiral Sir George Rodney in the West Indies and took part in the capture of Sint Eustatius. Between 1790 and 1792 he held the position of commander-in-chief of the Jamaica Station and between 1793 and 1796 he held his position as a Lord of the Board of Admiralty. Although his career was marked with long periods of inaction and unemployment Admiral Affleck was known as a good officer and was well respected by his peers.

At the Siege of Louisbourg he distinguished himself in leading the boats that cut out the French men-of-war Prudente and  and was promoted to command. His promotion to commander was confirmed on 1 August 1759 and Affleck accompanied Edward Boscawen in the 18-gun sloop of war  to the Mediterranean.

During the blockade of Pondicherry on 1 January 1761 Panther was dismasted in a hurricane and once more Affleck impressed his superiors by his calm handling of the situation. In May 1761 he exchanged command of Panther with Captain Newsom to command the storeship  but resigned command of her in early 1762. He then became captain of , which the British had captured some two years earlier at Pondicherry. Not long thereafter he returned to England.
