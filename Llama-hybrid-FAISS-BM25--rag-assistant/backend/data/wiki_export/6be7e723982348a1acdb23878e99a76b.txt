Asım Orhan Barut (June 6, 1926 – December 5, 1994) was a Turkish-American theoretical physicist.

Education
He received both his undergraduate diploma and his Ph.D. degree from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich in 1949 and 1952, respectively. He pursued his postdoctoral studies at the University of Chicago during 1953–1954.

Academic life
Barut was an assistant professor at Reed College during 1954-55 and then joined the faculty at Syracuse University in 1956. He became a professor of physics at the University of Colorado at Boulder in 1962 and served for 32 years.

Research areas
His research interests centered on group theoretic methods in physics. His books include Theory of the Scattering Matrix, Electrodynamics and Classical Theory of Fields and Particles and Representations of Noncompact Groups and Applications. Asım Orhan Barut was elected a fellow of the American Physical Society in 1966.
