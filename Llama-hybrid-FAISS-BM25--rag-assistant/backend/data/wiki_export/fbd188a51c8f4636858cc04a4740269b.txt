Georgia's 11th congressional district is a congressional district in the U.S. state of Georgia. The district is currently represented by Republican Barry Loudermilk. The district's boundaries have been redrawn following the 2010 census, which granted an additional congressional seat to Georgia.  The first election using the new district boundaries (listed below) were the 2012 congressional elections.

Located in the northwestern portion of the Atlanta metropolitan area, the district covers the entirety of Bartow, Cherokee and Pickens counties, as well as northwestern and central Cobb County. It includes Cartersville, Kennesaw, Woodstock and most of Marietta.

From 2013 to 2023, the district also included the northern "neck" of Fulton County, including the far northern portion of Atlanta proper.
