Lorenzo Cybo de Mari  (c. 1450/1451 â€“ 21 December 1503) was an Italian Catholic cardinal. He was archbishop of Benevento.

Biography
Born in Genoa, de Mari was an illegitimate child. According to some sources his paternity was attributed to Domenico de Mari, patrician of Genoa, brother of Teodorina and uncle of Maurizio Cybo, although another source states Maurizio (d. April 1491) was his father.

He was made cardinal on 9 March 1489 by his uncle, pope Innocent VIII. He built the first Cybo Chapel in the Basilica of Santa Maria del Popolo in the beginning of the 16th century which was decorated by the frescos of Pinturicchio and the works of Andrea Bregno but was destroyed by Alderano Cybo in 1682-87.

He also was bishop of Vannes in France, bishop of Palestrina (1493), bishop of Albano (1501) and bishop of Noli (1502).
