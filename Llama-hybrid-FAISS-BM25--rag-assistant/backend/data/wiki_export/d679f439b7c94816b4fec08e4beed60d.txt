Film Music (1985) is an album originally released on vinyl by the American trumpeter and synthesizer player, Mark Isham.

It consists of extended tracks from the soundtracks of three films. The first track is from the soundtrack of the film Mrs. Soffel (1984). The second track is from the documentary The Times of Harvey Milk. This film won the 1984 Academy Award for best documentary. The material of the third track is from the Carroll Ballard film, Never Cry Wolf (1983).

Like Isham’s previous album, Vapor Drawings (1983), the material on this is deeply atmospheric and emphasizes the use of synthesizers often blended with acoustic instruments. Of the three films represented, Isham is only credited with performing trumpet on track two, "The Times of Harvey Milk".
