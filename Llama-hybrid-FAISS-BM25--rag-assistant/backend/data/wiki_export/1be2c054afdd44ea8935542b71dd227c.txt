Arthur Hindle is a Canadian actor and director.

Early life and education
Hindle was born in Halifax. For 12 years, he alternated living with his divorced parents in addition to living in foster homes. He grew up in Bowmanville, and later at The Beaches area of Toronto, attending Riverdale Collegiate and Malvern Collegiate.

Career
Before he became an actor, Hindle modeled clothes in catalogs for Canadian companies Simpsons-Sears and Eaton's. He was also a stockbroker.

Hindle has made guest appearances in a long list of television programs in North America, and has also appeared in several movies, dating from 1971.

His first major role was in a biker movie, The Proud Rider, spawned by the popularity of Easy Rider. Hindle worked with a real motorcycle gang, Satan's Choice of Oshawa. It was during the production of this film that he almost changed his professional name to Jeremy Kane, as producers thought that Hindle should have a more showbiz-sounding name. 

In 1971, he was cast as Billy Duke in the film Face-Off. This film led to offers from Hollywood which he resisted until work dried up and Hindle, who had four children by this time, finally moved to Los Angeles in 1974.

He had a supporting role in the Canadian horror film Black Christmas in 1974. He had a pivotal supporting role in the 1978 remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. He then went onto playing the lead in The Brood and appeared in the 1981 teen sex comedy film Porky's. He later played the role of Harry Dobbs in the popular Canadian TV series, North of 60.

From the early 1990s, Art has also worked as a director. He starred in, and directed, the award-winning series Paradise Falls showing on cable stations in the USA and on the Showcase channel in Canada.

Awards
Hindle has won a Gemini award.

Personal
Hindle is married and divides his time between California and Canada.
