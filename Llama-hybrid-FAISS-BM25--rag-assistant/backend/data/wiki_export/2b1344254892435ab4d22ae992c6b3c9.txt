Sindeok of Silla (died 917) (r. 912–917) was the 53rd ruler of the Korean kingdom of Silla. He was born to the Pak clan, and was the son of Daeachan Pak Ye-gyeom. He was chosen to succeed the childless King Hyogong, because he was a descendant of King Adalla (d. 184, the last Pak to sit on the Silla throne) and was also a son-in-law of King Heongang.

Reigning during the Later Three Kingdoms period, Sindeok was faced with constant attacks by the new kingdoms of Taebong and Hubaekje in the west.

Upon his death in 917, King Sindeok was buried near Juk Castle in Gyeongju.
