The Centennial of the City of Toronto was celebrated in 1934, commemorating the incorporation of York into the City of Toronto. The celebrations included numerous events, exhibitions, and commemorations. Of the most modern relevance is the "Toronto's Hundred Years" Publication Committee, which published Toronto's 100 Years, from which much historical perspective may be found.

Organization
Along with a General Centennial Committee, Toronto had at least sixteen Special Committees. They were the Music and Pageantry, Permanent Memorial, Flying, The "Toronto's Hundred Years" Publication, Travel Promotion, Veteran Reunion, Pictures, Religious Services, Stamp Exhibition, Sports, Street Decorations, Flower Show, Song Judging, Public Address, National Groups, and the Drills Corps Display Committee (which included a Mailing List Committee).

It is possible more Committees existed, as it was published "It is greatly regretted that the names of the members of other committees which are being formed are not available for this edition."

Events and ceremonies

While events occurred throughout the year, many were scheduled to happen in one of three three-day periods. The first began on Victoria Day, the second after Dominion Day (now Canada Day), and the third at the end of summer, but before the Canadian National Exhibition's annual opening.

Victoria Day Weekend, May 24, 25, 26
Of note, Toronto first proclaimed Victoria Day in 1848.

Re-opening of Fort York
Victoria Day (the 24th) was dedicated to the re-opening of Fort York.

The Empire Pageant
Running all three nights of the period was an "inspiring historic" Empire Pageant. Held at night, the outdoor performances looked at the history of the city from the establishments of Natives and M. de la Galissoniere, to then present day educational, industrial, and social developments.

Canadian Corps Reunion, August 4, 5, 6

The first-ever reunion of the Canadian Corps was held in Toronto, over a three-day period. While there was mischief reported, for the most part, the soldier's celebration went off smoothly.

While original plans called for German and Austrian veterans to be included in the parade, they were scratched on the day of. Corps reunion officials said, "They will not parade with the corps. Beyond that, we do not wish to comment."

During the reunion
After two days of hospitalization in Neudeck, East Prussia, President Paul Von Hindenburg of Germany died of uremia poisoning on 2 August 1934. Shortly after news of the 86-year-old's passing made Berlin, Chancellor Adolf Hitler was named President by Constitutional amendment. By the start of Toronto event for Great War veterans, German Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels was reported to be working on a "high-pressure drive to bring Germans in mass to the polls Aug. 19 to vote Adolf Hitler into office as... "Fuehrer and Reich Chancellor"."

The host city itself was busy dealing with the Ontario Hunger Marchers. Marchers were holding a meeting in Toronto parks without permits. While the hunger marchers had walked the highways down to the event, they were sent home via capacity-loaded trucks, as ordered by Premier Mitchell Hepburn, to remove them from the city. These Marchers were so prominent that some children mistook a veteran with a red beret for one.

Other notes
Some residents complained that "our largest hotels lack decorations of any description, and especially this week," when the veterans were in town.
