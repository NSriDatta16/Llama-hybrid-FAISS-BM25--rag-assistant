Owly is an American children's graphic novel series created since 2004 by Andy Runton and published by Top Shelf Productions.

Series overview
The series, which is largely without standard text dialogue making it a pantomime comic, is about the adventures of a gentle owl named Owly who resolves to do good and make friends in his world with the help of his good companions, the clever worm, Wormy, and Scampy, the gluttonous but good hearted chipmunk.  While he faces obstacles in the pursuit of that goal, his faith in the goodness in the world is never disappointed.
