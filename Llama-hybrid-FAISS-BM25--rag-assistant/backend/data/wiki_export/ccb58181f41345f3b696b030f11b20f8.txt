Marcelino Bernal Pérez (born 27 May 1962) is a Mexican former professional footballer who played as a midfielder.

Club career
A talented all-around midfielder who was able to win possession effectively as well as score goals, Bernal spent most of his club career with Puebla and Toluca. He won two championships: Puebla in 1990 and Pachuca in 1999. He ended his top-flight career with UNAM in 2001.

International career
Bernal got 65 caps and 5 goals for the Mexico national team between 1988 and 1998, and he participated at the World Cups in 1994 and 1998. Bernal's career developed at a relatively late stage, and he earned 58 of his 65 caps at the age of 30 or older. At the 1994 World Cup he scored a goal in the game against Italy, but he was best known for the Mexico-Bulgaria second-round game in which he cleared a shot from Krasimir Balakov, but in doing so, he fell on the net and snapped the post, causing the goal to cave in.  An eight-minute delay was needed to install a new net and play resumed.  Mexico would eventually lose in a penalty shootout, in which Bulgaria goalkeeper Borislav Mihaylov saved Bernal's attempt.

Managerial career
Bernal managed the Guerreros de Hermosillo in 2010.
