Ohio's 1st congressional district is represented by Democrat Greg Landsman. The district includes the city of Cincinnati,  all of Warren County and borders the state of Kentucky. This district was once represented by President William Henry Harrison. After redistricting in 2010, the district was widely seen as heavily gerrymandered by state Republicans to protect the incumbent, Steve Chabot. Chabot lost the seat in 2022 to Landsman, after redistricting unified the city of Cincinnati into the district. The city was previously split between the 1st and 2nd districts.

The district includes all of Warren County, a much more heavily Republican area. Previous iterations of the district (before 2013) did not include Warren County.
