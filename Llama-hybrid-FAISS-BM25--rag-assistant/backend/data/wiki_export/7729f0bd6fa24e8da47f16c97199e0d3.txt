Dragontales was a series of gamebooks written by Rhondi A. Vilott Salsitz as "Rhondi Vilott" and published by Signet in the 1980s. The books place the reader in the role of a young man or woman in various fantasy countries inhabited by a variety of extravagant creatures. The books were meant for readers somewhat older than those of most gamebooks, as romance is a common element, as are allusions to physical development in the books' heroines.

An interesting feature of the Dragontales series was that each odd-numbered book in the series had a white cover and featured a female protagonist, while each even-numbered book had a black cover and a male protagonist.

The first book was licensed and made into a visual novel video game by Hanako Games in early 2015.
