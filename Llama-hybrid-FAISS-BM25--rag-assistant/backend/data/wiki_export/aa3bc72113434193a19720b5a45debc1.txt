History 

At its founding on February 22, 1867, the paper was originally known as the Indiana Student and was published twice a month by half a dozen students. It ceased publication in 1874 due to financial difficulties but William Lowe Bryan, who was a student and would later become IU's 10th president, relaunched it in 1882. In 1897, Florence Reid Myrick became the paper's first female editor-in-chief. In 1899, the newspaper was renamed the Daily Student.

The university gained ownership of the Daily Student in 1910 and used it as a journalism lab. In 1911, the School of Journalism was formed. That same year, the school required every journalism student to work on the paper. Students received course credit and a grade for their work. Serving as editor-in-chief required 15 credit hours, but in 1905, the position became a paid job. In 1914, the paper was renamed to its current publication title, the Indiana Daily Student.

In September 1922, Ernie Pyle became editor-in-chief and later left IU a semester before graduation to work at a paper in LaPorte, Indiana.

On December 7, 1941, the IDS ran an extra on the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and is one of two known college newspapers to publish that afternoon.

The IDS moved to Ernie Pyle Hall in 1954. The building was renamed is honor of Pyle, who was shot and killed in World War II in 1945. His desk sat in the newsroom. The building was also home to the School of Journalism, until the completion of The Media School in 2014.

On July 1, 1969, the paper adopted its charter and became financially and editorially independent from the University. Journalism students were no longer required to work for the paper.

Students paid for an IDS subscription until 1973, when it became free. Due to declining revenue, the IDS began charging a quarter per issue in the spring of 1981. Up until 1995, it was only one of two college papers that still charged a fee. That fall, the IDS was once again free for students and the community. The IDS is funded exclusively through student-generated advertising and the IDS Legacy Fund.

In the summer of 1996, the IDS launched its website, the Indiana Digital Student, now known as idsnews.com

In October 2005, the IU-Bloomington Chancellor adopted a revised charter, combining the IDS and Arbutus yearbook charter, which was established in 1981, and changed the publisher's title to Director of Student Media.

In 2014, the IDS newsroom moved from Ernie Pyle Hall to the new Media School, housed in Franklin Hall on IU's campus. Pyle's desk still sits in the newsroom, near the entrance.

Staff 
The IDS employs more than 200 students; 6 professional staff members serve as advisers. The IDS is the third largest employer of students on campus.

The student editor-in-chief is selected by a publications board that includes professional journalists, student representatives, alumni, faculty and administrators. The editor changes every semester – fall, spring and summer. Once selected, the editor chooses managing editors and desk editors for the semester through an application process. Staff members are drawn from all majors, and many major in the IU Media School.

Management includes the editor-in-chief, two traditional managing editors, creative director and digital managing editor. Management chooses desk editors for the paper's news, sports, arts, opinion, photo, general assignments, design, copy, video, enterprise, digital, social media, and audience engagement sections.

New writers, photographers, page designers, copy editors and web content producers are accepted on a rolling basis. Creative, Marketing and Distribution typically hire new staffers at the end of every semester. Opinion columnists are also hired at the beginning or end of the semester. Writers are paid per story, photographers per photo assignment, designers per page they design.

The IDS photo blog, "Focus", was home to work from IDS photographers. These blogs have since been discontinued.
