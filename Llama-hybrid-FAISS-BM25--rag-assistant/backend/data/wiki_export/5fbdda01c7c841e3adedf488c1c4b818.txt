Early life

Politics 
Pierre joined the Saint Lucia Labour Party (SLP) in 1985, and served as the party treasurer from 1986 to 1992.  In 1992, he contested the general elections for the first time in Castries East, but did not win.  After serving as the SLP chairman from 1992 to 1996, Pierre ran again in 1997 and won.
