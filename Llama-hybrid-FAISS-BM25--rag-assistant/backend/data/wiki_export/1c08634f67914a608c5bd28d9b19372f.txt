The Montreal Quebec Temple is the 86th operating temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).

History
The temple was announced on August 6, 1998, and was the sixth temple to be built in Canada. It was also one of the temples announced with a long list of others, which LDS Church president Gordon B. Hinckley hoped to have completed by the end of 2000 in order to have 100 operating temples throughout the world.

Gary J. Coleman, of the Seventy, presided at a site dedication and groundbreaking ceremony held on April 9, 1999. The temple sits on a  plot in the city of Longueuil. The temple was open to the public for tours of the interior May 20–27, 2000. Despite the short duration of the open house, more than 10,000 people toured the temple.

Hinckley dedicated the Montreal Quebec Temple on June 4, 2000. Before the dedication began, a cornerstone ceremony was held to officially complete the construction of the temple. Hinckley placed the cornerstone and had help from local children in placing the mortar. Around 6,000 members attended the four dedicatory sessions of the temple. The temple serves more than 12,200 church members from the Montréal; Ottawa, Ontario; Montpelier, Vermont; and upstate New York areas.

The temple has a total of , two ordinance rooms, and two sealing rooms. The exterior finish is made of Bethel white granite from northern Vermont.

The temple closed for renovations in 2014.  A public open house was held from Thursday, 5 November 2015, through Saturday, 14 November 2015, excluding Sunday.  The temple was rededicated on Sunday, November 22, 2015, by Henry B. Eyring.

In 2020, the Montreal Quebec Temple was closed in response to the coronavirus pandemic.
