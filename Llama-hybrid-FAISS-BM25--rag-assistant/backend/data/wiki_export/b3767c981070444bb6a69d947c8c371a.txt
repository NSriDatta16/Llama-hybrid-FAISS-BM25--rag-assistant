Following his work with The Wild Cherries and The Virgil Brothers, in 1970 Robinson recorded a cover of Cat Stevens' recent song Wild World. The single was released under the name Fourth House and entered the charts nationally around Australia.

In the 1970s and 80s he played in his country band Hit & Run while he also worked as a session musician.

During the 1980s he moved to Tasmania and established a business making instruments. He is now a highly regarded Luthier based at Anglesea.

Robinson joined The Wild Cherries in 2002 when they reformed for a one-off concert at the Corner Hotel in Richmond.
