High Noon is a "best of" and rarities collection by Mark Heard, posthumously released in 1993, on Heard's own Fingerprint Records.

The album consists of primarily tracks from Heard's final three albums, 1990's Dry Bones Dance, 1991's Second Hand and 1993's Satellite Sky. The new tracks that are added are "My Redeemer Lives", from the 1992 Derri Daugherty/Steve Hindalong produced various artists album, At the Foot of the Cross, three previously unheard songs, "She's Not Afraid", "No" and "Shaky Situation" and a rough demo of "What Kind of a Friend", recorded on a poorly tuned upright piano.
