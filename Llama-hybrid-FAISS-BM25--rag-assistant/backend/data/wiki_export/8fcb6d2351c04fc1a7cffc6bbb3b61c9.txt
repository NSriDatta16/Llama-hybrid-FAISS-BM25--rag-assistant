Blister is a television show that aired on G4 in the United States from 2002 to 2004. Hosted by Bill Sindelar, the series featured action/adventure video game previews, reviews, and interviews with game designers and players.

History
Blister was the first show to air on G4 when the network launched in 2002. The series went to E3, interviewed famous industry insiders, and looked at action games.

In 2003, the first two parts of a planned three-part special titled Blister Declassified premiered. These episodes follow Bill Sindelar's quest to find the Polybius game. However, the show was abruptly cancelled due to the merger between G4 and TechTV, leaving the third part of the special unfinished. However, a complete script had been written for the episode.

The final episode to air was "Skunk'd", a parody of MTV's Punk'd.

Blister was produced by Mike Dunn and Jonathan Solin.
