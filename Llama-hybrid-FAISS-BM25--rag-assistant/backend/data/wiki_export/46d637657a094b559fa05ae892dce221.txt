Heritage Hall School is a coeducational, college-prep school located in North Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.   An independent private school not affiliated with any religious organization, the school is open to students of any race, religion, nationality, or ethnic origin.

Heritage Hall was founded in 1969 in the church basement of First Christian Church.   Heritage Hall was founded during the integration of Oklahoma City public schools as a segregation academy.

Heritage Hall serves children from preschool through 12th grade, and has about 900 students.  Racial diversity in the student body closely matches the Oklahoma state average, with an enrollment of just over 20% of students of color.  Each grade in the Upper School has about 90 students.

Heritage Hall is accredited by the Independent Schools Association of the Southwest, and is a member of the National Association of Independent Schools. The current headmaster, Aaron Fetrow, was appointed in 2021.

Heritage Hall's athletic teams are nicknamed the Chargers.  The school colors are navy blue and Gold.  As a member of the Oklahoma Secondary School Activities Association, middle school and high school students are able to participate in about a dozen competitive sports, from American football to tennis, basketball, swimming, golf, soccer, baseball and softball. 
The motto is "To Learn, To Lead, To Serve."  Heritage Hall's institutional core values are:  moral courage, personal responsibility, active kindness, and intellectual purpose.  The school symbol is a torch that burns with the letters HH.

Until 2015, Heritage Hall and Casady School held rivalries against one another.
