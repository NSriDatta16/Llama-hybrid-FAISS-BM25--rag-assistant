The Nashville Tennessee Temple is the 84th operating temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It is located in Franklin, Tennessee, United States, approximately  southwest of central Nashville.

The intent to build the Nashville Tennessee Temple was announced in 1994. The temple originally was to be built in the affluent suburb of Forest Hills, but the plan was turned down by city commissioners due to zoning rules.  It was eventually built next to an existing meetinghouse in Franklin using the church's small temple plan. The temple's exterior is constructed from Imperial Danby white marble and has a single spire topped with the familiar statue of the angel Moroni. The temple serves church members in central and eastern Tennessee and western Kentucky.

During the open house held May 6â€“13, 2000, almost 25,000 people toured the temple. James E. Faust, of the church's First Presidency, dedicated the Nashville Tennessee Temple on May 21, 2000.

The Nashville Tennessee Temple has a total floor area of , two ordinance rooms, and two sealing rooms.
