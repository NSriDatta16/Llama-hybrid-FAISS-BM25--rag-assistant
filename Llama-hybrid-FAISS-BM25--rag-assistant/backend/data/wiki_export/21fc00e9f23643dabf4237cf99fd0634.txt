Series overview

Episodes

Season 1 (1992) 
The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles debuted on ABC on March 4, 1992, with the feature-length episode Young Indiana Jones and the Curse of the Jackal, which served to introduce the character at the two ages he would be portrayed as in the show. The five subsequent episodes in season one were hour-long.

Season 2 (1992–93) 
Season Two began on September 21, 1992, with the episode "Austria, March 1917", and the seventeen subsequent episodes consisted of both new episodes and some episodes originally produced for the first season—each an hour long. Harrison Ford made a guest appearance in the feature-length episode Young Indiana Jones and the Mystery of the Blues. When the show was cancelled, four episodes remained unaired: "Florence, May 1908", "Prague, August 1917", "Palestine, October 1917", and "Transylvania, January 1918". In Australia, "Somme, Early August 1916" and "Germany, Mid-August 1916" originally aired as a two-hour television movie entitled Young Indiana Jones and the Great Escape.

TV films (1994–96) 
Four television films aired on The Family Channel from 1994 to 1996. No "Old Indy" bookend segments were filmed for the television films, although Sean Patrick Flanery bookended Young Indiana Jones: Travels with Father.

International variations 
In some territories, certain episodes were split or combined under different titles.

Film versions 
In 1996, George Lucas hired T.M. Christopher to aid in re-editing the complete series into twenty-two feature-length episodes. The series was also retitled The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones. Each chapter contains two episodes, with most of the chapters arranged in chronological order. The scenes in which an older Indiana Jones reminisces are not included in these versions, except in "Chapter 20: Mystery of the Blues", which featured Harrison Ford as an older Indiana Jones in 1950.

In 1999, only Chapters 6, 8, 10–13, 15–18, 20, and 22 were released on VHS in the "Complete Adventures of Indiana Jones" along with the re-release of the movie trilogy (credited as Chapters 23: Temple of Doom, 24: Raiders of the Lost Ark, and 25: Last Crusade). The movie trilogy also featured Chapter 18: Treasure of the Peacock's Eye as a bonus tape (Chapter 10: Phantom Train of Doom in the UK). It was promoted with the rest of the episodes set for release later in 2000, but this was canceled.

As of June, 2023, all 22 Episodes are streaming on Disney+, as a series called The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones.

Additional documentaries 

 

Additionally ninety-four critically acclaimed documentaries about the real life historical figures, events, and subject matters in the series were made for the included supplements in the DVD releases from 2007 to 2008. They were co-produced by George  Lucas and Rick McCallum.
