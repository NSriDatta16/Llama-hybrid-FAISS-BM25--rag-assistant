The Valkiri is a South African self-propelled multiple rocket launcher. It is a 127mm system with a wheeled launcher vehicle, and fire control equipment developed by Armscor. Contemporary models consist of a single launch module with five eight-cell rocket pods on a Unimog or SAMIL-100 carrier. Its mission is to engage in counter-battery strikes against hostile artillery and air defences as far as 36 km (22 mi) away. Other potential warheads include cluster and an anti-tank mine dispenser.

The system is inspired by the Soviet BM-21 Grad, which was deployed against South African expeditionary forces in Angola during Operation Savannah. Development was completed in 1971.  Valkiris played a key role in Operation Alpha Centauri and Operation Moduler during the late 1980s.
