Judith Ingolfsson (born in Reykjavík, Iceland) is a violinist. She plays a violin by Lorenzo Guadagnini made in 1750.

Early life 
She began to play violin at age three, and debuted as a soloist in Germany already at age eight. She moved to the US and in her early teens she studied with Jascha Brodsky at the Curtis Institute of Music. She then studied at the Cleveland Institute of Music under David Cerone and Donald Weilerstein.

Career 
She was a prizewinner at the Premio Paganini Competition in Genoa and at the Concert Artists Guild Competition in New York. In 1999 she was honored by National Public Radio as Debut Artist of the Year, and in 2001 received the Chamber Music America/WQXR Record Award for her debut CD with works by Bloch, Rorem, Bach, and Wieniawski. 

In 2008 Ingolfsson became Professor at the Stuttgart Hochschule für Musik und darstellende Kunst.
In 2009, together with Vladimir Stoupel, she founded the festival Aigues-Vives en Musiques in the south of France. In 2010 she was artist-in-residence in Villa Esche in Chemnitz. 

She won first prize at the International Violin Competition of Indianapolis. 
She has performed in many venues, including, the Konzerthaus Berlin, the Tokyo City Opera, the Kennedy Center, and Carnegie Hall. She appeared with the Philadelphia Orchestra, the National Symphony Orchestra, the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra, the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra, the Royal Chamber Orchestra of Tokyo, the Budapest Philharmonic Orchestra, the Jena Philharmonic, the Philharmonischen Staatsorchester Mainz, the Bollington Festival Orchestra (UK), and the Brandenburgisches Staatsorchester Frankfurt (Oder). She had collaborated with conductors such as Wolfgang Sawallisch, Raymond Leppard, Gilbert Varga, Jesús López-Cobos, Rico Saccani, Gerard Schwarz, and Leonard Slatkin.

Her concerts have taken her across the US and to countries including Germany, the Czech Republic, Russia, Japan, Hungary, Iceland, Puerto Rico, Panama, and Macau

Her discography includes four other CDs: Tchaikovsky’s Violin Concerto (BPO LIVE, 2008), Simon Laks en hommage (EDA, 2010), the Six Solo Sonatas by Eugène Ysaÿe (GENUIN, 2011), and works by Stravinsky and Shostakovich with pianist Vladimir Stoupel (AUDITE, 2011).

Ingolfsson performed at festivals in the US, Poland, Finland, Germany, Switzerland, France, and the Netherlands. 

Ingolfsson is also a chamber musician and has collaborated with the Vogler, Avalon, and Miami String Quartets, the Broyhill Chamber Ensemble, and the Ronen Chamber Ensemble. 

She performs regularly with Stoupel as the Ingolfsson-Stoupel Duo. They present unusual repertoire and programs that expand the form of the traditional violin-piano recital, and performed in the US, Switzerland, Poland, Italy, France, and Germany.

Judith has an interest in less well-known twentieth-century composers such as Simon Laks and Haflidi Hallgrimsson, and Swedish composers Amanda Maier and Laura Netzel. With the Jenaer Philharmonic and the Staatsorchester Mainz, she performed the Violin Concertos by Rautavaara and Roslawez. She plays Baroque compositions, such as works for solo violin by Telemann and Tartini, on the modern violin while considerering historical practice.

She repeatedly collaborated with music publishers as an editor, for example, of the Trois Pieces de Concert by Simon Laks, which appeared with her arrangement for violin and piano.

Reception 
The New York Times characterized her playing as producing “both fireworks and a singing tone”, The Washington Post praised her “finely honed bowing and stylistic finesse”. Strings Magazine described her tone as “gorgeous, intense, and variable, flawlessly pure and beautiful in every register.”
