Count of Osorno is a Spanish hereditary peerage which was granted on 31 August 1445 by John II of Castile to Gabriel Fernández Manrique, 1st Duke of Galisteo. The title is accompanied by the dignity of Grandee of Spain.

On the death in 1675 of Ana Apolonia Manrique de Lara, 8th countess, and in the absence of an heir, the title went to the House of Alba, who is currently still holding it.

The name of the peerage refers to the municipality of Osorno la Mayor, in the province of Palencia, Castile and León, Spain.
