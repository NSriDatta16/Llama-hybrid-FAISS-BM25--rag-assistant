History
The stadium was built in 1952. Since then, it has been used for the home matches of Levadiakos. In 2005 Levadiakos was promoted to the 1st National League (now Super League) and with his money he won from his upgrading refurbished the stadium that was then in a very bad condition. The platforms were upgraded and placed on all plastic seats, new journalism studios and suites were created, and projectors were added. In 2009, some upgrade projects were carried out and a small enclosure was built above the main platform and VIP locations. The capacity of the stadium is about 5,915 seats.
