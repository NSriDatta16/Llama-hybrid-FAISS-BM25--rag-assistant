Galla Gaulo or Galla Lupanio was the fifth traditional Doge of Venice (755â€“756).

History
Gaulo was elected to the throne after deposing and blinding his predecessor, Teodato Ipato. He came to power at a time when there were three clear factions in Venice: the pro-Byzantine faction supported a strong doge and close political relations with the Byzantine Empire; the pro-Frankish party supported moving closer to the new Carolingian dynasty (enemies of Lombards and Greeks); and the republican party wished to assert as much independence as possible and to remain outside any larger power's sphere of influence. Galla was probably pro-Frankish.

He barely survived on the throne for a year before he was deposed, blinded, and exiled as Teodato had been. He is regarded as the traditional founder of the Barozzi family.
