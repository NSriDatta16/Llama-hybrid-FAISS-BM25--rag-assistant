Louis François Marie Le Tellier, Marquis of Barbezieux (23 June 1668 – 5 January 1701) was a French statesman.

Biography
Born in Barbezieux-Saint-Hilaire (Charente), he was the third son of the Marquis de Louvois, War Minister to Louis XIV.

After the death of Louvois, Louis XIV appointed Barbezieux to succeed his father and grandfather, becoming the third Le Tellier to serve Louis XIV at the War Ministry. Although talented, the 23-year-old neglected his office in favour of his pleasures. The King complained to Barbezieux's uncle, Charles-Maurice Le Tellier, Archbishop of Reims that:Your nephew has talents, but he does not make good use of them. He prefers to dine with princes rather than work. He neglected his affairs for his pleasures. He leaves officers waiting too long in his antechamber; he speaks to them disdainfully and sometimes harshly.
