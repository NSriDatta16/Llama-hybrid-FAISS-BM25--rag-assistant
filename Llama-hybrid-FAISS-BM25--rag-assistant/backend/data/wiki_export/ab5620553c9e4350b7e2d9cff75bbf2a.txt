Bronx Community Board 11 (CB11) is a small unit of the City of New York (NYC), whose district encompasses the neighborhoods of Allerton, Indian Village, Morris Park, Pelham Gardens, Pelham Parkway (neighborhood), Van Nest and other areas in the borough of the Bronx. Coterminous with the 49th NYPD Precinct, its district is delimited by Bronx Park East and the Bronx River Parkway to the west, Adee Avenue, Boston Road and East Gun Hill Road to the north, the Hutchinson River Parkway to the east, and East Tremont Avenue to the south.

Board's role and structure
Like the 58 other NYC community boards, CB11 consists of up to 50 volunteers appointed by the Borough President, although at least one half of the board's membership is selected from nominees of the district's respective Council Members. Consisting of several committees, CB11 is headed by an executive board, which consists of a chair, first vice chair, second vice chair, treasurer, secretary, and sergeant at arms.

The board plays an advises on land-use and rezoning matters. It is responsible for identifying community needs as part of the city's budget process and working with government agencies to coordinate and improve the delivery of municipal services. The board also handles special projects, including organizing and working with tenants', homeowners' and merchants' associations, developing graffiti removal, other cleanup projects, and other matters relating to the community's general welfare. Full board meetings, which are open to the public, are usually held on the fourth Thursday of the month.

Staff history

District managers 

From 1977 until he died in 1988, the board's first district manager was Thomas "Tom" J. Brown.

From 1989 until 1995, Assistant District Manager Thomas "Tom" F. Lucania took over. At the age of seventeen, Lucania, representing Saint Lucy's School, was a member of the board's then-Youth Services Committee before he became a board member for the first time in 1987 and, also in 1987, assistant district manager.

The board's third district manager, John Fratta, retired from CB11 after 15 years of service to the board. Prior to this, Mr. Fratta was a youth coordinator for Bronx CB7 and a clerk at the City Comptroller's Office. Notable achievements during his tenure include the Pelham Parkway reconstruction project, the opening of a New York Public Library branch on Morris Park Avenue, the revamping of zoning regulations to maintain the low-density character of the neighborhood, and establishing community groups to fight crime in Pelham Parkway and Van Nest.

Additionally, Mr. Fratta was successful at making the board office more accessible to the public and surrounding neighborhood. Prior to November 1997, CB11 was located on the eleventh floor of Jacobi Medical Center, which was perceived as an inconvenience to the community. At the time, Fratta cited State Senator Guy Velella as instrumental in moving the community board to its present location on Colden and Morris Park Avenues.

In December 2010, Jeremy H. Warneke, an Iraq War veteran from Illinois, was unanimously selected by the board to succeed Mr. Fratta as the board's fourth district manager. His term began in 2011, and in 2012, with the help of board members, staff and volunteers, he launched the board's first NYC.gov website. Also in 2012, he was allowed to preliminary select the next round of staff members, two immigrants who were hired for their language as well as technical skills.

Civic groups

Operating within the purview of the board are many civic associations, which hold public meetings once a month or week throughout the year, excluding some summer or winter months. Their meetings usually feature guests from city, state or federal government offices. Groups currently active within the board include but are not limited to the 49th Precinct Community Council, Allerton Avenue Home Owners & Tenants Association, Morris Park Community Association, Northeast Bronx Association, Pelham Parkway Neighborhood Association and Van Nest Neighborhood Alliance.
