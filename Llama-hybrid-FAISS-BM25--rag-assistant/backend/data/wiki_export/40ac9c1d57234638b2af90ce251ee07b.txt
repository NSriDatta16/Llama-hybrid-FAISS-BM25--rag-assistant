The Leinster Senior League, inaugurated in 1971â€“72, is a rugby union competition for senior clubs in the Irish province of Leinster. It has traditionally been ranked second in importance to the Leinster Senior Cup. It declined in importance due to the formation of the All-Ireland League and growth in importance of the Heineken Cup and was eventually merged with the Senior Cup, sometime before 2006, before being revived in 2016.

Format
From 2023-24, the competition was restricted to teams in the second division of the All-Ireland League.
