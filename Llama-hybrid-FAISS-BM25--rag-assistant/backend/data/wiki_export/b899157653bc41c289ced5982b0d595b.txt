History

Coquimbo won the 2018 Primera B and returned to the Primera Division for the 2019 season after 14 years of absence. The club has a great return in the 2019 season, finishing fifth in the league table and qualifying to continental competitions for the first time in 28 years.  

In 2020, the club had a poor season in the Primera Division, and were eventually relegated. However they had an excellent Copa Sudamericana campaign, where they reached the semi-finals and were eliminated by the champions, Defensa y Justicia, but eliminated notable teams like Atlético Junior and Sport Huancayo on their way to this stage.
