Malone moved to California at age 19 to pursue a career in music. However, after a friend's encouragement, Malone found himself getting involved in film and working a job at Don Post Studios, doing makeup and costume work.

After attending UCLA film school, Malone soon thereafter directed his first film, Scared to Death. After which he directed television (i.e. Tales from the Crypt) and various films.
