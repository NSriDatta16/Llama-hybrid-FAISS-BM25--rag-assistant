History 
Lethbridge County encompasses an area that was originally under the jurisdiction of six municipalities. It was originally formed as the Municipal District of Lethbridge No. 25 on January 1, 1954 by amalgamating the municipal districts of Bright No. 16 and Barons No. 25 and portions of Special Area No. 4, the County of Vulcan No. 2 and the municipal districts of Warner No. 4 and Sugar City No. 5. Ten years later, on January 1, 1964, the Municipal District of Lethbridge No. 25 joined with Lethbridge School Division No. 7 to become the County of Lethbridge No. 26. It subsequently changed its name to the County of Lethbridge on September 6, 2000 and then again to Lethbridge County on December 4, 2013.
