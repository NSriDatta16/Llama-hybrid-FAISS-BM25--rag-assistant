Gas 0095 was the debut album of electronic musician Mat Jarvis (High Skies) released under his Gas moniker. It was written,
performed and recorded in his Nottingham studio during 1994 and released on Em:t Records (Emit Records) in January 1995.

The album was never advertised, yet quickly began selling by word of mouth. Before its 2008 re-release and remaster it was known to regularly sell for $400+ on auction sites, like eBay, to collectors. The album was encoded in 3D by the large and hugely expensive Roland Sound Space RSS 3D sound imaging system.

In 2008, Gas 0095 was remastered at 32bit/96Â kHz from the original studio tapes, and re-released on CD and digital download by Jarvis on the Microscopics label as Micro-000001.

Oddities
 The track "Timestretch" is a full four-minute track, shrunk down into one second of audio. Much speculation has been made over whether this track can be stretched back again to recover the full version.
 The track "Miniscule" is a four and a half minute track time-stretched down to twelve milliseconds and is intended as a "comma" between tracks.
 There are two extra unlisted tracks, "Pink" and "Doom", which appear at the end of the album. "Pink" is a short instrumental, while "Doom" is composed of sound effects from the last level of the classic 1990s computer game, DOOM.

Artwork
Em:t releases are noted for their striking graphic design, and the 0095 cover is no different. It displays a very iconographic invertebrae ctenophora zooming off like an alien spaceship. The high resolution nature photography is believed to have been chosen by an artist with layout by British design firm The Designers Republic.
