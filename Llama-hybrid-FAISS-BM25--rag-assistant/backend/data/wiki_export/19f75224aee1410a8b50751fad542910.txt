The Painter is the eighth studio album by the funk and disco group KC and the Sunshine Band. Produced by Harry Wayne Casey and Richard Finch, it was released in September 1981 on the Epic label.

History
The Painter, like its predecessor, was not successful, as the band turned to a more pop-focused music.

A notable track on this album is the ballad "All Through the Night". The song was co-written by Bruce Roberts and Donna Summer, and was first recorded by Summer for her 1979 album Bad Girls.
