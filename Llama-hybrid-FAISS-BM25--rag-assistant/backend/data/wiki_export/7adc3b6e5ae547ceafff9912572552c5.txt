However, due to all five starters having played as freshmen, they were all ruled as ineligible and the team was banned from participating in the 1956 NCAA basketball tournament. The team would subsequently not become eligible for the NCAA tournament again until 1975, when the NCAA began allowing two teams from each conference in the tournament
