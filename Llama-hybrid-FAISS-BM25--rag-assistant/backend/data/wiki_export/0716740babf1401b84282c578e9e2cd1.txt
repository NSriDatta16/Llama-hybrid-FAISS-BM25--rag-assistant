TPMCafe was a center-left blog portal created by Josh Marshall as a spin-off blog to his popular Talking Points Memo. It debuted on May 31, 2005.

Johnson, Michael Lind, Kevin Phillips, Mark Schmitt, Anne-Marie Slaughter, Ruy Teixeira, Elizabeth Warren, among others.

The blog also had a Table for One blog where a notable person guest-writes for a week. Vice-Presidential candidate John Edwards was the first such guest; others have included Paul Hackett, Anthony Romero, Bernie Sanders, Tom Vilsack, Wesley Clark, Sherrod Brown, and Russ Feingold. There is also a TPM Bookclub blog, where authors discuss their works and answers questions from readers.
