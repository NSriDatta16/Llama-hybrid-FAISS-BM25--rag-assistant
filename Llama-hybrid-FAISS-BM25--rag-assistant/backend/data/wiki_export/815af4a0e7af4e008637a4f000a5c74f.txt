Travis James Snider (born February 2, 1988) is an American former professional baseball outfielder. Nicknamed Lunchbox, he played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Toronto Blue Jays, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Baltimore Orioles.

Amateur career
Snider played for the Mill Creek Little League team at 1999 Little League Western Regional Tournament in San Bernardino, California. He attended Henry M. Jackson High School, where he played as an outfielder for the baseball team and as a running back and linebacker in football.

Professional career

Toronto Blue Jays
The Toronto Blue Jays selected Snider in the first round, with the 14th overall selection, of the 2006 MLB Draft. Snider began his professional career in 2006 with the Pulaski Blue Jays in the Appalachian League. He excelled in his debut and ended up winning the Short Season Player of The Year honors for Appalachian League.

In 2007, he was promoted to the Class A Lansing Lugnuts, he spent the whole season in Lansing and ranked among the league leaders in many hitting categories, including RBI (93, first), doubles (35, first), hits (143, T-third), home runs (16, T-fifth) and batting average (.313, fifth). He represented Lansing in the 2007 Midwest League All-Star Game.

Snider began the 2008 season with the Dunedin Blue Jays of the Florida State League.  Coming out of spring training he had suffered an injury to his throwing elbow so for the first portion of the season he was the team's designated hitter exclusively.  Snider performed well in High-A and he was promoted to the Double-A New Hampshire Fisher Cats of the Eastern League on May 21, 2008.  Initially at Double-A, Snider struggled but as he regained his health and started to play in the outfield again he began hitting well.  Snider won the Eastern League Home Run Derby with an impressive performance, hitting 10 home runs in the semifinals in front of a record crowd at the Fisher Cats stadium. Snider was nicknamed "the Franchise" by New Hampshire Union Leader reporter Kevin Gray. On August 6, 2008, the Blue Jays promoted Snider to Triple-A Syracuse Chiefs of the International League.  Snider continued to play well at Triple-A and would only play 18 games at that level before being promoted. Overall, in 133 combined minor league games, he batted .275 with 23 home runs and 91 RBI.

2008–2010
Snider was promoted to the Toronto Blue Jays on August 29, 2008, and became the youngest position player in the majors. He made his debut later that day, playing left field and batting ninth at Yankee Stadium. Facing Carl Pavano, Snider lined out to shortstop in his first at-bat. He later doubled off Pavano for his first big-league hit. On September 4, 2008, Snider launched his first career home run at Rogers Centre off Kevin Slowey of the Minnesota Twins, becoming the fourth-youngest Blue Jay to hit a home run. After his first season with Toronto, he finished hitting .301 with two home runs and 13 RBI in 24 games.

Baseball America ranked Snider sixth on their annual ranking of the best baseball prospects, moving him up five spots from the previous year's rankings.

On April 6, 2009, Snider recorded a home run and double on Opening Day against the Detroit Tigers. He had his first career two home run game on April 13, 2009, against the Minnesota Twins and became the youngest player in Blue Jays history to hit two home runs in a game. He was sent back to Triple-A Las Vegas 51s in May, after a prolonged hitting slump, but was recalled by the Blue Jays in August, going on to hit a home run in his first game back.

On August 2, 2010, Snider became the first Blue Jays player since 1978 to hit two doubles in one inning against the New York Yankees (pitchers A. J. Burnett and Boone Logan). This was part of an AL record tying six doubles in an inning by the Blue Jays.

2013
Snider began 2013 in a platoon in right field with José Tábata, with Garrett Jones also getting occasional starts when he wasn't at first base. The platoon dissolved when Tábata went on the disabled list with a strained oblique, and Snider got most of the starts during Tábata's stint on the DL. To that point, Snider was hitting .252 with two home runs, 14 RBI and 31 strikeouts. After hitting .171 in June, Snider was relegated to a pinch-hitting role upon Tábata's return on July 3. On July 28, Snider was placed on the disabled list with discomfort in his left big toe, which had been bothering him for over a month. Snider was activated from the disabled list when the rosters expanded on September 1, and was used in a pinch-hitting role to finish the season. In 111 games (53 starts) in 2013, Snider hit .215/.281/.333 with five home runs and 25 RBI.
