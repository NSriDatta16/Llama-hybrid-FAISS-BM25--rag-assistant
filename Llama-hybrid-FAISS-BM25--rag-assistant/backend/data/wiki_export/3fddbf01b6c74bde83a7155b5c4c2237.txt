The Karelian Isthmus is the debut studio album by Finnish heavy metal band Amorphis, released in 1992.

Although The Karelian Isthmus took its name from a historic Finnish battleground, Karelian Isthmus, its lyrics focus on Amorphis's well known epic themes from the history of Finnish warfare and religion, but drawing more from Celtic mythology rather than the later traditions of Amorphis's own native land. The epic side is sometimes broken up by the occult lyrical themes in the tracks "Pilgrimage", "Misery Path" and "Black Embrace" that were re-recorded from the Privilege of Evil EP. The album was recorded and released between the recording and release of the EP. Both releases were combined in a 2003 reissue.

This release was the last recorded release to have the original lineup of the band as later on the band would have either additional members or original members quitting. In recent years, songs from this album have been receiving more play during Amorphis' live performances, despite being of a different style than their later works.
