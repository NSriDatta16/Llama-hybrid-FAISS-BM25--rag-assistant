Queer Boys and Girls on the Shinkansen is a 2004 Japanese movie produced by habakari-cinema+records. The English title is Queer Boys and Girls on the Bullet Train.

Description
Queer Boys and Girls on the Shinkansen brings together ten filmmakers and artists who consistently affirm what it means to be gay or lesbian in their work. Habakari chose ten filmmakers to make a five-minute work each, developed around a gay or lesbian theme, and compiled the resulting shorts in random order to create this omnibus film. The result is a queer film, by queer filmmakers, for a queer audience. Each short is its own short story, and the styles range from drama and experimental film and animation.
