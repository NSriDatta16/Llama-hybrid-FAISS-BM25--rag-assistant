Education and career

Before emigrating to Canada, Martin worked for the UK Met Office as a forecaster, responsible for South West England. She received a Higher National Certificate with distinction in Mathematics, Statistics and Physics from the Reading College in the United Kingdom while on day release from her job.

Canada 
She moved to Canada in July 1990 and worked in a support position for Environment Canada's Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) including positions as weather observer in Lethbridge, Alberta, and Fort Resolution, Northwest Territories. She attended the University of Alberta in Edmonton from 1993 until 1995, completing her Bachelor of Science with specialization in Meteorology. In March 1994, she graduated from the MSC Meteorology course. She worked on the "media bench" for Environment Canada's Northern Alberta Weather Centre.

She was identified as a surplus employee during the federal government cuts in 1995. Martin took a job as a staff meteorologist and weather presenter with CITV in Edmonton in August 1996. In 2005, she moved from Edmonton to join CBC Television's news operations in Toronto. CBC introduced nationally televised weather features at that time for its news programs The National and Canada Now. In 2007, she moved to CBC's Vancouver station CBUT to host regional weather forecasts. Martin was heavily involved in assisting with weather forecasts for the Vancouver Olympics in February 2010. In September 2012, the CBC senior management consolidated weather services, and moved Martin to CBLT in Toronto to work on the local supper-time and 10 PM national newscasts.

In February 2014, she left the CBC to move back to Vancouver and work for Anaid Productions.
