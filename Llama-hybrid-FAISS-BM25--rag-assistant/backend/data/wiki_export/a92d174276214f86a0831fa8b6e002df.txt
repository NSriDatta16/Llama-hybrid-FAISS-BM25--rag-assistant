Gung Haggis Fat Choy is a cultural event originating from Vancouver, Canada. The name is a combination wordplay on Scottish and Chinese words; haggis is a traditional Scottish food while Kung Hei Fat Choi is a traditional Cantonese greeting used during Chinese New Year.

The event originated to mark the coincidence of the Scottish cultural celebration of Robert Burns Day (January 25) with the Chinese New Year, but has come to represent a celebration of combining cultures in untraditional ways. In Vancouver, the event is characterized by music, poetry, and other performances around the city, culminating in a large banquet and party.

It has also inspired both a CBC television performance special  and the Gung Haggis Fat Choy Festival, organized by the Recreation Department at Simon Fraser University.

Origins
Gung Haggis Fat Choy was created in 1993 when a Simon Fraser University student Todd Wong was asked to help out with the University's annual Robbie Burns Day celebrations. Wong, a fifth generation Canadian, quickly learned about Scottish-Canadian culture with its traditions of men wearing kilts, carrying swords, playing bagpipes and cuisine. That year, Chinese Lunar New Year fell two days later, on January 27. Realizing that he could combine the two events, he coined the phrase and created the "Toddish McWong" persona. In 1998, Wong hosted the first Gung Haggis Fat Choy Rabbie Burns Chinese New Year Dinner as a private dinner party for 16 friends. In 1999, the first public Gung Haggis Fat Choy dinner was hosted as a fundraiser for the dragon boat team. Forty people attended.
