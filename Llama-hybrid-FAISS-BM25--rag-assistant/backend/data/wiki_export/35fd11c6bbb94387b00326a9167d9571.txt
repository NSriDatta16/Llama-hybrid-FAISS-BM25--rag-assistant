The Coast Guard Judge Advocate General oversees the delivery of legal services to the United States Coast Guard, through the Office of the Judge Advocate General in Washington, the Legal Service Command, offices in the Atlantic and Pacific Areas, nine Coast Guard Districts, the Coast Guard Academy, three training centers, and a number of other activities and commands.  Legal services are delivered by Coast Guard judge advocates and civilian counsel in ten legal practice areas: criminal law/military justice, operations, international activities, civil advocacy, environmental law, procurement law, internal organizational law, regulations and administrative law, legislative support and legal assistance.

Military Justice
The Coast Guard is subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

Judge advocates have also served in Iraq and Afghanistan and deploy for international training missions with the Coast Guard and the Department of Defense.

Civil Advocacy, Claims, and Litigation
Coast Guard attorneys actively manage an extensive claims program under several federal statutes. These involve not only adjudicating claims made against the agency, but also collecting monies owed the government due to penalties assessed for violations of federal law, for damage to Coast Guard property, and for cleanup and recovery costs.  Coast Guard attorneys are actively involved in a wide variety of civil litigation, from simple tort defense to constitutional challenges.  Coast Guard judge advocates are assigned to litigating divisions in the United States Department of Justice, and other judge advocates serve as full and part-time special assistant United States Attorneys in several locations.

Procurement Law
Coast Guard attorneys in the Office of Procurement Law at the Coast Guard headquarters, in the Surface Forces Logistics Center (formerly the Maintenance and Logistics Commands), and in some field legal offices, provide contract law advice to management, technical, and contracting officials at all levels of the Coast Guard. This ranges from daily advice to field-level contracting officers to advice on major construction, acquisition, and procurements. Advice is provided from the earliest planning stages of procurement through contract negotiation and award as well as through contract administration, which may include action on claims and contract litigation.

Environmental and Property Law
Legal services are provided in support of Coast Guard compliance with federal, state and local environmental requirements.  Lawyers advise field commanders, program managers and Headquarters units, regarding federal, state and local requirements that may affect or constrain Coast Guard activities. They represent the Coast Guard, either directly or through the Department of Justice, in environmental enforcement actions against the Coast Guard, environmental citizen suits, and challenges to Coast Guard activities brought under environmental statutes. Legal counsel is provided on matters involving the acquisition, maintenance and disposition of real property including leases and licenses.

Coast Guard attorneys provide legal advice on issues including federal fiscal law, gift acceptance and standards of ethical conduct for government employees, management, acquisition and disposal of real property, military and civilian personnel law, civil rights, health care, privacy and the release of information. To some extent, Coast Guard attorneys do this work wherever they are.  Attorneys at the Office of General Law at Headquarters and at the Maintenance and Logistics Commands provide advice and represent the Coast Guard on matters involving the Merit Systems Protection Board, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and labor relations.
