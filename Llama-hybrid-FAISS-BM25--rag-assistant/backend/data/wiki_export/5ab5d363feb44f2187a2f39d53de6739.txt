Jens Zetlitz (26 January 1761 – 14 January 1821) was a Norwegian priest and poet.

Zetlitz was born at Stavanger in Rogaland, Norway. At the close of the 18th century he traveled to the University of Copenhagen to study theology. He became a member of The Norwegian Society (Det Norske Selskab) and became well known for his entertaining songs and drinking songs. He returned to Norway after completing his studies and entering the ministry. From 1800 Zetlitz was  parish pastor and vicar  at Vikedal in Ryfylke and from 1811 at Kviteseid in Telemark  until his death in 1821.

He married Maren Elisabeth Bull (1761-1801). Their daughter Axeliane Christine (1792-1855) married businessperson and  consul Jacob Kielland (1788–1863).
The couple had five sons and five daughters. Through this marriage Jens Zetlitz had a large number of notable descendants; novelist Alexander Kielland was his great-grandnephew. The pop singer Bertine Zetlitz is the most famous currently living descendant.

A street in Stavanger is named for Jens Zetlitz, as is the Zetlitz multi-purpose hall in the Stavanger Concert Hall.
