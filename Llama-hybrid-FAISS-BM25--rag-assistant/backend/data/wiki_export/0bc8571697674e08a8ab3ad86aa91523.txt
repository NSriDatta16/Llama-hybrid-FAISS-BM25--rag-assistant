Historical sites
There are significant archaeological sites on the plain. The ancient Lesbians worshiped many of the ancient gods in great sanctuaries, parts of which are preserved today. The temple of Messa was dedicated to Zeus, Dionysus and Ira, constituted a worship and communication centre for all the Lesbians, and at the beginning of the 2nd century B.C. was the seat of the federation of all the cities of Lesbos. During the early Christian period a basilica was erected over the temple, which was succeeded by a mid-Byzantine church. There are many remains, ruins, altars and ancient remnants around the region, signs of worship of the Lesbian people who arrived there as pilgrims to the great sanctuary of Pyrra and of the entire island. Important archaeological sites are also found in Apothika, between Parakila and Agra, where the ancient retaining wall of about six meters height is located, but also in Makara, bearing the name of the first settler of Lesbos during ancient times.

Bay and lagoon
The Lagoon of Ancient Pyrrha is now the Gulf of Kalloni or Bay of Kalloni.  The Ancient city of Pyrrha is currently  Achladeri Lesvos which sits to the east of the Bay of Kalloni.  The Gulf of Kalloni is a shallow, rich wetland that hosts aquatic and avian life, including flamingos, porpoises, dolphins, and seals.  It is especially renowned for its yield of sardines.  Following his departure from Plato's Academy after being passed over for the school's headship, Aristotle spent a few years with his friend Theophrastus at the Pyrrha lagoon, now the Gulf of Kalloni. There he studied animal life: his observations formed material for the very first treatises ever written on the subject of biology or Aristotle's biology, namely his books on the "history, parts, movement, progression, and generation" of animals.
