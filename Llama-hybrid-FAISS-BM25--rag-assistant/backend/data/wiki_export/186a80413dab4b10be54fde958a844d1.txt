History 

The name probably originates from the Little Para River whose headwaters are in the area. It was settled in 1840â€“41 by John Barton Hack and John Richardson, and was a sheep station until the beginning of the 20th century. It was subdivided and, with an influx of smaller landholders, a school, post office, church and recreation hall were built, but the town did not grow much beyond this.

In 1966, work started on the Kangaroo Creek Reservoir, a dam of the River Torrens, and in 1969 it was completed at a cost of $5.3 million. Apart from supplying water to eastern Adelaide, it also serves a flood protection role and holds 19,160 megalitres.

Facilities 
Paracombe has a primary school, a recreation centre and a Country Fire Station.

Transport 
The area is not serviced by Adelaide Metro public transport. A coach is operated from Tea Tree Plaza Interchange to Gumeracha and Mount Pleasant by LinkSA.
