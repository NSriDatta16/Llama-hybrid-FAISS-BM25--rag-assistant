Choral Music Programs: Directed by Cindy Hagman

Concert Choir 
The Lincoln High School Concert Choir is the entry level choir at Lincoln High School, as it is open for enrollment for 9th-12th graders. The average class size is around 50 students,  Although there is no prior musical knowledge required, students enrolled in this choir class will learn how to sing rhythms as well as basic musical sight reading. The Concert Choir performs at least once a semester at the Winter and Spring Concerts, usually performing a variety of music.

Elite Choir 
The Lincoln High School Elite Choir is an audition-only choir at the high school. Though it is open to all grades, the majority of this class consists of grades 10–12. This higher level choir consists of around 50-60 talented students. The Elite Choir has a well-developed presence throughout the town as well as worldwide, as the choir performs regularly around the surrounding neighborhoods, as well as taking yearly spring trips to scenic destinations. Notably, the Elite Choir traveled in June 2016 to Prague, Czech Republic; Vienna and Salzburg, Austria; and Munich, Germany and performed in the esteemed St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna. Previously, the Elite Choir performed at the well-known Carnegie Hall with multiple other choirs. During the 2016–2017 school year, the Elite Choir will be performing at a competition in Disneyland. Music that has been previously performed by the Elite Choir includes "Seal Lullaby" by Eric Whitacre, "Daniel, Daniel Servant of the Lord" arranged by Undine S. Moore, and "Shut De Do" by Randy Stonehill.

Select Choir 
The Lincoln High School Select Choir consists of a handful of members only taken from the Elite Choir (usually section leaders) and performs throughout the community at fundraisers and other events. The Select Choir is known colloquially as the "Traveling Choir", as the members of this choir have been seen performing in groups of varying sizes at many events, at one point up to 8 in one week. The Select Choir meets for an hour or more every week, as this is not a class offered at Lincoln High School, but rather an extracurricular type activity.

Marching, Pep, Concert and Jazz Bands and Color Guard

Instrumental Music Programs: Directed by Mr. David Hill

Marching Band, Pep Band, and Color Guard 
The Lincoln High School Fighting Zebra Marching Band is a field band, parade band and color guard that participates in competitions throughout the Central Valley. The 2014–15 season saw about 85 members including two drum majors and 10 color guard. The 2013–14 season's show was "Mary Poppins", 2014-15 was "From the Darkness", and the 2015–16 season's show was "Anyway the Wind Blows", a compilation of Queen songs including the world-renowned "Bohemian Rhapsody". Competitions have been attended in Stockton and at Folsom, Del Oro, and Oakmont High Schools. The marching band has a large hometown presence, performing at every home football game and marching parades throughout the year. The marching band also functions as a pep band during football and basketball games, constantly filling the stands with enthusiasm, cheering, and playing pep tunes such as "Land of 1000 Dances", "Zarathustra", "Go Big Blue", "ABC" by The Jackson 5. Some pieces performed are arranged by the band members themselves. The Star Spangled Banner is played before each game's beginning, and the drum-line often plays cadences than cause spontaneous outbreaks of dancing.

Color guard enhances the visuals of the marching band. Rifle, saber, flag and ribbon techniques are taught to members of guard, and there is also a winter guard that's not affiliated with the marching band. Those who are not in marching band may join winter guard.

The band has a two-week, nine hour pre-season in July that teaches new musicians how to march and allows the band to learn the drill and music. Weekly sectionals allow each instrument section to focus completely on their own music and to work on memorizing the show. Night Rehearsals are also scheduled to perfect the drill and the small details. Joining a marching band requires tremendous practice, focus and determination, and daily practices are held before school for an hour.

All this practice and perfecting is well worth the time because being in a marching band is one of the most fun, most challenging, and most rewarding lifestyles that can be engaged in at a high school. Many of LHS' graduates continue on to play in college, join Drum Corps International, and/or pursue careers in music. Music is a lifestyle - and we're glad that LHS has such a great music program that fosters individual growth and self-improvement.

The Marching Band's 2016 theme is "The Sounds of Liberty". The drill and music are based on the events of World War II and are arranged by Mr. Albert Medina of Glen Edwards Middle School.

Concert Band and Symphonic Band 
The Lincoln High School Concert Band takes over when Marching Season ends, and students are introduced to more challenging, traditional music. The concert band has about six concerts a year, including a Christmas concert in December, District Band Day (a concert with all of the bands in the Western Placer Unified School District) in mid-March, a solo/ensemble concert in April, concerts in February and May, and graduation in early June. The ensemble also performs on their spring trips to places like Disneyland, California Adventure, San Francisco and the Pacific Western Concert Band Festival at the University of the Pacific. Throughout the year the band performs at rallies and other sporting events.

Most recently, the band performed at the Pacific Western Concert Band Festival (hosted by Dr. Eric Hammer) and received a review clinic/conductor's adjudication, watched other bands perform, and attended special-interest classes like conducting, music therapy, afro-Cuban percussion, a campus tour, yoga, and others. To end the festival, UOP's wind ensemble performs, which inspires many of the attending musicians. The band next traveled to San Francisco to tour The California Academy of Sciences and Fisherman's Wharf.

Symphonic Band is a course for more advanced players in the music program. Music will meet the California Advanced Standards, and daily practice will be expected. In addition to their own concerts, Symphonic Band may compete in competitions and other events.

Jazz Band 
Lincoln High's Jazz Band is a daily zero-period class during Semester 2. Students are taught advanced improvisation and swing skills, and have many opportunities throughout the season for solos, duets, trios, and other arrangements. The jazz band performs three concerts a year, in addition to providing entertainment at local events and fundraisers. All members of the jazz band are in concert band or marching band.
