Hammam-Lif (, pronounced hammam linf) is a coastal town about 20 km south-east of Tunis, the capital of Tunisia. It has been known since antiquity for its thermal springs originating in Mount Bou Kornine.

History 
Naro, which means fire, was Hammam-Lif's Punic name. In 1883, the French captain Ernest De Prudhomme discovered in his Hammam-lif residence the first archeological ruins of an ancient synagogue that once stood in Hammam-Lif in 3rd-5th century AD.

Hammam-Lif was once the home of Italian, Greek and Jewish communities, especially before the end of the French colonial period.

Hammam-Lif's most interesting site is probably Dar El Bey, which was the residence of Ali II Bey, the 4th bey of Tunis.

Sport
The local football team Club Sportif de Hammam-Lif won the Tunisian championship in 1952, 1954, 1955, 1956 and won the Tunisian Cup in 1946, 1947, 1948, 1949, 1950, 1985, 2001
