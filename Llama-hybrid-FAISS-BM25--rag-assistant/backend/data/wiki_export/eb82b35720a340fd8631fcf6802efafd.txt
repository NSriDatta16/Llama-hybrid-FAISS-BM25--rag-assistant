Sardauna (formerly Mambilla) Local Government Area is located in the extreme southeast of Taraba State in Nigeria. It is synonymous with the Mambilla Plateau, which is dotted by  many towns and villages. The capital of the LGA is Gembu, an ancient Mambilla settlement whose name is a corruption of "Gelmvu", the name of an ancient monarch of the area. Other ethnic groups from the mainstream Nigeria and neighbouring Cameroon Republic such as Hausa, Kanuri, Banso, Kambu, Fulani, etc can be found in the commercial centres.

Climate
In contrast to the rather steamy and humid climate of most other parts of southeastern Nigeria, the climate in this part of the country (owing to its altitude) is relatively cool; most days in the dry season the temperature will reach 20-23 C and drop to 16-18 C at night, whilst in the wet season these averages fall a couple of degrees.

Languages
Sardauna is highly linguistically diverse, with about two dozen distinct local languages (mostly Fulani languages, Jukunoid languages, Bantoid languages, and Mambiloid languages).
