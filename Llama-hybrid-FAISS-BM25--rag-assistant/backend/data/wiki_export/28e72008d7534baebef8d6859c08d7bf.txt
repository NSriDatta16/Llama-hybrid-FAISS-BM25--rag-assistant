South Texas ISD Science Academy (formerly known as The Science Academy of South Texas), also known as "SciTech", is a high school in Mercedes, Texas, United States, as part of the South Texas Independent School District. This campus is ranked among the top 1% Best Public High Schools in America.

The school serves as an alternative to high schools of local independent school districts for students interested in pursuing careers in science, technology, and engineering. The school's unique curriculum has given it national recognition. Being a public magnet school, open enrollment has been the school's policy since its creation, although application is required. The Science Academy is part of the South Texas Independent School District which is ranked #9 out of 10,758 school districts in the United States.

The South Texas ISD Science Academy has partnerships with Cornell University, Stanford University, Rice University, Rochester Institute of Technology, University of Texas-Pan American and South Texas College. Its sister school South Texas ISD Health Professions, commonly known as "Med High", resides on the same campus. Both schools are served by Biblioteca Las Américas, the campus library, which is located at equal distance from both schools.

The Science Academy has no athletics department, but students participate in academic competitions regularly. In 2008, The Science Academy gym was completed, no longer sharing with the Med High gym.

A study called The Science Academy a "dropout factory," citing a 55% retention rate.

As of the 2018-19 school year, the school had an enrollment of 731 students and 54.42 classroom teachers (on a FTE basis), for a student-teacher ratio of 13:1.

History

The school was founded in 1989 as the Math and Science Academy. Jorge Lopez, the principal of neighboring Med High served as principal. After a year, the school's name was changed to The Science Academy of South Texas. In 1992, the main building was completed and classes moved out of the portables.

In 2018, construction of The Science Academy's Congressman Rubén Hinojosa Innovation Lab was completed. A supporting beam signed by the Class of 2018 can be seen near the building's mezzanine.

A detailed history of The Science Academy can be found in Dr. Anna Rudolph Canter's dissertation entitled In the Middle of an Orange Grove, Across the Street From the Tortilla Factory: The Science Academy of South Texas.
