The 7stanes are seven mountain biking centres spanning the south of Scotland, from the heart of the Scottish Borders to Dumfries and Galloway. They are all in Forestry and Land Scotland forests and are known as the 7stanes because each venue features a 'stane' (Scots for stone), created by artist Gordon Young, somewhere along the forest trails.

Trail grades
The trails use the Forestry Commission off-road trail grades:

Green - Easy (Suitable for beginners)
Blue - Moderate (may be singletrack and include minor obstacles; suitable for cyclists with basic off-road skills)
Red - Difficult (mostly singletrack, many obstacles; suitable for proficient mountain bikers)
Black - Severe (similar to red routes, with more obstacles and large challenging area; suitable for expert riders only)
Bike Park (Orange)- Extreme (highly challenging, includes downhill sections and unavoidable jumps; suitable for expert riders only)
Forest road and similar - these routes can be waymarked or not. The difficulty of forest roads can vary widely and this grade indicates these trails not part of a progression on to green and blue level singletrack trails.
