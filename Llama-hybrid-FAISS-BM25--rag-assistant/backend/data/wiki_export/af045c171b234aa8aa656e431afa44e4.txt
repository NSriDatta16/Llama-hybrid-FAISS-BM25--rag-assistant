Jujhar Singh
(, pronunciation: ; 9 April 1691 â€“ 22 December 1704), the second son of Gobind Singh, was born to Mata Jito at Anandpur Sahib. This event is now celebrated on April 9 each year according to the Nanakshahi Calendar.

Biography 
He died in battle during the Second Battle of Chamkaur.

Legacy
Sikh hagiographer, Rattan Singh Bhangu, compared Jujhar Singh's sacrifice at the Battle of Chamkaur to the death of Abhimanyu in the Mahabharata epic, as both fought and died defending their father. He writes Jujhar Singh as thinking the following whilst engaging the Mughal forces in battle: "How can a son live while his father confronts death in battle?"

The Honourable Prime Minister Narendra Modi has paid homage to the Chaar Sahibazde on various occasions, particularly during the celebration of their bravery and sacrifice on Veer Bal Diwas (Day of Brave Children). Veer Bal Diwas is observed in honour of the Chaar Sahibzaade, who are remembered greatly amongst Sikhs across the globe.
