She was County Clare's first-ever female TD, she took her seat in the 22nd Dáil as Fine Gael leader Garret FitzGerald was elected Taoiseach, heading a Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition government.

The government fell in January 1982 when it was defeated in a vote on the budget, and at the February 1982 general election Taylor-Quinn lost her seat to Fine Gael's other candidate, Donal Carey. She was then elected to the 16th Seanad as a Senator for the Cultural and Educational Panel.

After her Dáil defeat in 1992, Taylor-Quinn was elected to the Seanad Éireann, again for the Cultural and Educational Panel, which re-elected her in 1997 to the 21st Seanad. She was defeated at the 2002 Seanad elections. She also stood as a Fine Gael candidate at the 2004 European Parliament election, for the North-West constituency, achieving over 22,000 votes in the Clare constituency, which was the highest vote of any candidate in any election in County Clare, but was defeated. She again contested the Clare constituency at the 2007 general election, winning 3,592 first preferences. Her party colleagues Pat Breen and Joe Carey won the Fine Gael seats.
