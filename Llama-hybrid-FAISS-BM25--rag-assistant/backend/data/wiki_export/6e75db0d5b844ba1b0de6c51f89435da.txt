History

Despite finishing fourth in their division and seventh overall in the league, the La Ronge Ice Wolves defeated the Humboldt Broncos, Flin Flon Bombers, Battlefords North Stars, and  Yorkton Terriers to clinch their first SJHL Credit Union Cup. Ice Wolves' forward Liam Brennan was named playoff MVP after scoring a hat-trick overtime goal winning the series. With the win, the Ice Wolves advanced to the ANAVET Cup, but had already guaranteed themselves a position in the 2010 Royal Bank Cup as their opponent, the Dauphin Kings of the Manitoba Junior Hockey League, were hosting the National Championship.  The Ice Wolves fell in five games to the Kings. The teams met again in the semi-finals of the RBC Cup, with the Kings defeating the Wolves 5–2 on home ice.

The Ice Wolves went into the 2011 SJHL playoffs as the top team in the league with 86 points and their first regular season points title in team history.  The Ice Wolves featured the top three scorers from the regular season in Travis Eggum (106), Marc-Andre Carré (106) and Doug Lindensmith (98).  After receiving a bye past the first round, La Ronge beat the Flin Flon Bombers in five games, the Melfort Mustangs in five games, and won their second consecutive SJHL championship in seven games over the Yorkton Terriers.  The Ice Wolves won the championship on home ice before a listed attendance of 1,339.  Ice Wolves defensemen Dayton Fossum and goaltender Joel Danyluk shared the playoff MVP.  The Ice Wolves again lost in the ANAVET Cup, falling in seven games to the Portage Terriers.
