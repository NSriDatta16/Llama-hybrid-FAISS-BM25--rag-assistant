Synopsis

Carmela tells Tony "that nice sales-lady" Gloria Trillo (his mistress) has committed suicide. Tony goes to the car showroom to find out more, then furiously confronts Dr. Melfi, who explains that he should not blame her, or himself, for her death.

Plagued by guilt, Tony seeks ways to prove he is a good person and performs some generous acts for his friends and family. He signs a living trust for Carmela, in place of the one he refused to sign before. He then arranges for Brian Cammarata to be provided with discounted suits, then takes Janice out for a companionable dinner. He continues his good deeds with another dinner where Furio is introduced to a blind date arranged by Carmela. She smiles uneasily, seeing them get on well.

A.J.'s friends are curious about his family's lifestyle and drive him around town to try to find out his father's actual line of work. In the lavish home of his girlfriend Devin Pillsbury, A.J. is intimidated by her family's wealth. When his friends ask why his family does not have "Don Corleone money", he has no answer.

One evening, high on heroin, Christopher receives a call from Tony instructing him to meet in twenty minutes. Tony says that to limit his own exposure, he will be giving more of his orders through Christopher, who will help "take the family into the 21st century." Christopher feels deeply honored, but continues to take heroin.

Artie has a new French hostess at Nuovo Vesuvio, Élodie, who he flirts with. Her brother, Jean Philippe, asks for a $50,000 bridge loan to conclude a deal to distribute Armagnac in the United States. Artie agrees to lend him the money at 13 percent interest. He tries to borrow the money from Ralphie, who declines but mentions it to Tony. Tony meets Artie, reminds him of their friendship, and insists that he accept the loan from him at only one-and-a-half percent interest.

Ten days pass and Jean-Philippe is not answering his phone. Artie confronts him at his home. Jean-Philippe reveals that the deal has failed and he does not have the money. Artie attacks him, but Jean-Philippe gains the upper hand, rips out his earring and throws him out. At home, Artie overdoses on alcohol and pills and calls Tony to apologize. Tony deduces that he is trying to kill himself and calls 911. At the hospital, Tony says that Artie can clear his tab at Nuovo Vesuvio in lieu of payment. Artie expresses admiration that Tony could foresee that the deal would go bad and that he would be able to profit from it; this observation infuriates Tony. Furio is sent by Tony to Jean-Philippe's apartment to collect the debt.
