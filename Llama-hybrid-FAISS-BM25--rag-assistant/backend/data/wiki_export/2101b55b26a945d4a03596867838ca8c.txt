Parviz Sayyad (; born 22 March 1939) is an Iranian-born American celebrated actor, director, translator, and screenwriter of Iranian cinema. He was one of the earliest television stars in Iran.

Early life 

Parviz Sayyad was born on March 22, 1939, in Lahijan, Pahlavi Iran.

Throughout the 1960s Sayyad starred in many plays that were adapted for television; and he was in the first Iranian television program titled Amir Arsalan alongside Mary Apick.

Career in Iran 

His first film, a comedy, Hasan Kachal (1970), or "Hasan the Bald", is well remembered. He gained more fame starring in one of the oldest Iranian television series  (1975; ) playing the role of a well mannered, diplomatic sneaky and soft-spoken board member.

He is best known for his role as Samad on the television series . The character Samad was a naive, street smart country boy (somewhat reminiscent of the American "Ernest" series). After this, Sayyad went on to star in the famous "Samad" film and television series. His character, Samad (or Samad Agha, as he demanded others call him), was a prominent comedic icon of Iran during the 1970s. The Iranian Revolution took place shortly after his 7th feature-length "Samad" film was released. Sayyad would spend the money he made on commercially successful films (such as Samad) to fund the creation of independent and intellectual films. 

His 1977 dramatic film Dead End entered the 10th Moscow International Film Festival. Other noteworthy roles include "Asdollah Mirza" on the television series, My Uncle Napoleon ().

Career in the United States 
Sayyad migrated to the United States shortly after the Iranian Revolution, where he continued to act, write, direct and produce. He received a PhD from the City University of New York (CUNY). 

In 1983, he directed and starred in the film The Mission (Ferestadeh), which was entered into the 33rd Berlin International Film Festival; and won the Jury Grand Prize award (1983) at the Locarno Film Festival.

Sayyad is married to Parvin Sayyad and has two daughters.
