Putyata () was a tysyatsky of Vladimir the Great whose name is mentioned in the Ioachim Chronicle. According to the chronicle, he forced the Novgorodians into accepting Christianity along with Dobrynya. An old proverb says: "Putyata baptized by fire, and Dobrynya by sword", or "Putyata baptized by sword, and Dobrynya by fire" (), which attributes the houses being set on fire to Dobrynya.
