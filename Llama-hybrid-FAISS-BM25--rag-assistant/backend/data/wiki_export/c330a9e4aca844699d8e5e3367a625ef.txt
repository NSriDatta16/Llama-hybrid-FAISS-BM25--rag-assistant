The Progressive Democratic Party (PDP) was a liberal conservative political party from Gibraltar.

The party was the third political party and the only party to sit on the centre-right in Gibraltar. Despite poor election results, it garnered growing support from the public and was seen as the 'alternative opposition'. The PDP was the only party campaigning for "a Gibraltar freely associated to the United Kingdom" and envisaged "a journey through the recognition of our right to independence". The party was also the only political party in Gibraltar that openly committed to implementing a means testing system in government housing.

The PDP described itself as "the only real choice for an alternative, authentic, centrist government which has vision, is progressive and is in tune with the aspirations of Gibraltarians for stable and moderate liberal politics."

History

The party was co-founded by Gibraltarian lawyers Keith Azopardi and Nick Cruz among other members in June 2006. The PDP has been described as a splinter group of the Gibraltar Social Democrats. This is because Azopardi and Cruz were both leading figures in the GSD who resigned due to disillusionment with the GSD party following a merger with the Gibraltar Labour Party.

Marie-Lou Guerrero and Leo Olivero left the party in November 2006 in opposition to the party's "yes" stance on the referendum on Gibraltar's new constitution.

The Party decided to support the constitution despite reservations "because it represented a massive leap forward from the 1969 constitution and because it put us in a much better position to then take the next steps."

On 6 June 2012, Keith Azopardi stepped down as leader of the PDP. At an AGM on 3 December 2012, Azopardi was elected as Party Chairman and Nick Cruz as Party Leader.

On 22 July, the executive committee met and decided, by overwhelming majority, to call it a day. A press release issued on 30 July 2013 confirmed that the party would be "wound up" with effect as from 31 August 2013. An EGM (Extraordinary General Meeting) will be held to pass the resolution and party funds will be donated to charity.
