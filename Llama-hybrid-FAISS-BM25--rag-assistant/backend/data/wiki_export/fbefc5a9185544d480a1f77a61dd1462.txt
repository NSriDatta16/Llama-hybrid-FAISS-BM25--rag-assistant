Controversies
The Isle of Man Newspapers has received criticism from the public for its court reporting procedures, in which defendants making court appearances are named by the press prior to a verdict being issued by the Courts. This has been widely criticised as a form of public shaming and a violation of the individual right to privacy. In 2022, a petition was circulated demanding an end to this practice, receiving over 1,000 signatures and support from politicians.
