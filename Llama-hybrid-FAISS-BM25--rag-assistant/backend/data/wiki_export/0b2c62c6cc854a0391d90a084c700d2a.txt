Count of Lucena (Condado de Lucena) is a Spanish hereditary comital title conferred on General Leopoldo O'Donnell y Joris by Queen Isabella II of Spain, on 25 July 1847. It was granted to him after defeating carlist General Ramón Cabrera in Lucena del Cid in the province of Valencia, as a victory title.

As General O'Donnell was created in 1860 Duke of Tetuan, the title Count of Lucena has been held since then by several Dukes of Tetuan. The 3rd Duke ceded this title to his elder daughter Blanca, but as her elder brother, the 4th Duke, died shortly after her father, the two titles were joined again. The 7th Duke ceded the title to his fourth and youngest son in the expectation that the two titles will definitely be disjoined in the future.
