Considering that, given the global nature of the shipping industry, seafarers need special protection, and

Recognizing the principles embodied in the Seafarers' Identity Documents Convention, 1958, concerning the facilitation of entry by seafarers into the territory of Members, for the purposes of shore leave, transit, transfer or repatriation, and..

Modifications 

This Convention revised Convention C108 Seafarers' Identity Documents Convention, 1958.

Ratifications
As of February 2023, the convention has been ratified by 38 states.

Differences between the C185 and C108 Seafarers' Identity Document Conventions 
The main difference between C185 and C108 is the use of biometric data as a reliable means of identification.
The successful application of the C185 required two main requirements:

1. the application of the necessary biometric technology;
2. the establishment of an appropriate infrastructure to control, manufacture and secure the production process of identifiers.

The requirements set out in the Convention have proved to be feasible.

E-passports and e-official travel documents have been used internationally since their introduction in 2006.
By 2018, more than 100 countries have already issued e-documents, which predicts the likelihood that these countries will ratify C185.
