Professional career

Washington Redskins
McCune was originally drafted by the Washington Redskins in the fifth round (154th overall) of the 2005 NFL Draft. He spent the majority of his rookie season on the Redskins' practice squad before being promoted to the active roster on November 6, 2005. He played in five games and two playoff games, logging seven special teams tackles. He made his professional debut in Week 9 against the Philadelphia Eagles, and led the team in special teams tackles with three in a Week 10 contest against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

McCune struggled during training camp with the Redskins in 2006, with then-linebackers coach Dale Lindsey saying his development was "not where we want it to be." McCune was once again waived prior to the regular season in 2006 and rejoined the Redskins' practice squad. He remained there until December 12, when he was signed to the active roster of the Miami Dolphins.

In 2013, McCune finished the 2013 CFL season as the Argonauts' team leader in tackles with 99, four of them as quarterback sacks. McCune was unable to play in the playoffs due to an injury.

Healthcare fraud case
Between June 5, 2017, and April 12, 2018, McCune submitted 68 false and fraudulent claims to the "Gene Upshaw NFL Player Health Reimbursement Account Plan" on his own behalf and on behalf of 51 other former NFL players. This Plan provided former players and family members reimbursements of medical care expenses that were not covered by insurance. The false claims typically sought reimbursement of $40,000 or more for expensive medical equipment such as hyperbaric oxygen chambers, ultrasound machines and electromagnetic therapy devices. None of this equipment was ever purchased or received. In total, McCune and his co-conspirators submitted approximately $2.9 million in fraudulent claims to the Plan.

On December 12, 2019, McCune was charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and health care fraud, nine counts of wire fraud, and nine counts of health care fraud by the United States Department of Justice. He pleaded not guilty to the charges on January 2, 2020. He was indicted on the same charges, plus another count of wire fraud, another three counts of health care fraud, and three counts of aggravated identity theft in a superseding case on July 24, 2020. In September 2021, the Department of Justice announced that McCune had pleaded guilty to all these charges. In February 2022, McCune was sentenced to 5 years in federal prison.
