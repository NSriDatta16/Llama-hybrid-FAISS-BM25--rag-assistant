Pinocchio 3000 (or P3K – Pinocchio 3000) is a 2004 computer-animated science fantasy film directed by Daniel Robichaud and distributed by Christal Films. The film is a futuristic science fiction interpretation of the classic 1883 novel The Adventures of Pinocchio by Carlo Collodi, with Pinocchio (voiced by Sonja Ball) being a robot brought to life by tapping into a city's power surge, rather than a puppet animated by magic.

The film centers on the basic story of Pinocchio attempting to fit into living with humans in the town of Scamboville, a futuristic city constantly under development under the reign of its namesake, Mayor Scamboli.

Plot
Geppetto, an old inventor, creates Pinocchio, a robot, as his son. Meanwhile, evil mayor Scamboli is building the technological city "Scamboville" to get rid of nature. He also hates all children, except for his beloved daughter, Marlene. When Marlene expresses concerns to Scamboli about there being no space for children to have fun, he sets out to make a kids-only theme park called "Scamboland".

That night, Geppetto and Spencer the Penguin prepare to make Pinocchio come to life. Unfortunately, Scamboli has seized control of the city mains to light up his theme park for the Grand Opening, so Geppetto has no choice but to steal his electricity. Suddenly, Scamboland has a power outage and the children leave. After Pinocchio comes to life, much to his family's delight, Cyberina the fairy appears. She decides to grant Geppetto's wish to turn Pinocchio into a real boy if he learns about right and wrong.

The next morning, Pinocchio walks his way to school with Spencer and meets Zach, Cynthia and Marlene. Marlene challenges Pinocchio to an Imagination game, hosted by Cyberina. Marlene wins, but Pinocchio, believing that he played better, snatches the medal from her. While running away, he comes across Scamboli's robotic henchmen, Cabby and Rodo, who take him to see Scamboli. In the ensuing conversation, Pinocchio says, "Life would be great if kids were more like us", sparking an idea in Scamboli's diabolical brain.

In the true opening of Scamboland, he makes Pinocchio into an attraction. When Geppetto gets word of this, he tries to convince him to come home. While Pinocchio performs at a concert, Scamboli kidnaps Geppetto. Afterward, all the children board a roller coaster ride called "A Whale of a Change", which transforms all of them into "Scambobots". Meanwhile, Pinocchio gives Marlene her medal back and befriends her, and they spend the night together at Marlene's private garden.

As they awaken the next morning, Marlene is crestfallen to find that Scambobots have destroyed her garden. Hearing Pinocchio laughing at her dismay, she gives the medal to him and revokes her vow of friendship. Pinocchio, realizing that he had accidentally helped Scamboli, leaves to find his father. He returns home and only finds Spencer. The two quickly realize that Scamboli turned Geppetto into a robot to kill Pinocchio. After stealing a remote that controls Geppetto and the other Scambobots, Pinocchio and Spencer hide out in the "Tunnel of Danger" ride, where Scamboli manages to trap them. Marlene arrives and helps Pinocchio avoid the tunnel's many dangers. However, Scamboli incapacitates Marlene to kill Pinocchio with a laser gun. Pinocchio uses the medal to shield himself from the laser, causing the beam to reflect back at Scamboli and destroy his weapon. Meanwhile, Cabby accidentally gives Geppetto the remote that controls all Scambobots. Geppetto then commands the robots to get Scamboli.
 
Scamboli attempts to escape in Cabby's shuttle, but is caught by a Scambocop. It tosses Scamboli inside a shuttle and flies down to the Whale ride. Pinocchio, Geppetto, Marlene and Spencer try to turn the robots back into children, but Scamboli presses a button to stop the machines. Pinocchio goes inside the whale and tries to fix it. Pinocchio finds the out-of-reach button. But Scamboli starts to attack him. So he begins to tell lies about how great Scamboli is. This causes Pinocchio's nose to reach long enough to hit the button, causing the carts to start moving again and Scamboli gets caught in the ride. Pinocchio then realizes that everything was his fault and breaks down. Cyberina appears, Pinocchio tells her that he has learned about Right and Wrong and turns Pinocchio into a real boy and Geppetto back into a human. Suddenly, Scamboli, turned into a robot, appears. In the end, Cyberina borrows Cynthia's "Funbrella" to make sunshine and bring back all the plants Scamboli has destroyed.

Music

The movie's theme song is What's the Difference? expressing Pinocchio's feelings regarding his life as a robot.

Cancelled TV Series
When the film was initially announced under the working title of Pinocchio 3001, it was stated the film would serve as a backdoor pilot for a 26 episode TV series depending on the success of the film.
