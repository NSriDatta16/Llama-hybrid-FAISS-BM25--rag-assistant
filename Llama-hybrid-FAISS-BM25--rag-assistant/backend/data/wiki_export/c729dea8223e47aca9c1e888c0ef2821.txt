College career

As a sophomore, Thomas averaged 4.3 points and 3.3 rebounds in 18.5 minutes in 32 games (28 starts). He posted a .505 field goal percentage and recorded at least five rebounds 12 times, including eight of Duke's 16 ACC games.

Thomas' career high in points came on November 28, 2008, when he scored 21 against Duquesne. His new career high broke his previous record of 15 points set on November 20, 2006. Thomas' ability to finish shots was a big staple of his improvement. It was said of him, "If he gets the ball within three feet of the basket, chances are he's going to put the ball in the hoop — regardless of whether he's fouled."

As a junior, Thomas averaged 5.3 points and 3.6 rebounds while shooting .626 from the field, in 37 games (16 starts). Thomas felt that the biggest difference between this year's Duke team and the ones from the last two years, was experience.

On February 10, the eighth-ranked Blue Devils held on for a 64–54 victory against rival North Carolina. However, Thomas suffered a severe bone bruise to his right knee early in the second half, forcing him to miss the next game against Maryland.

Thomas helped Duke win the 2010 NCAA championship, their fourth since 2001. In the 2010 NCAA championship game, Duke faced Butler and star swingman Gordon Hayward. The Bulldogs had a chance to win with 3.6 seconds left, but Hayward missed a half-court shot, giving Duke a 61–59 win.

Thomas was named to the 2009–10 ACC All-Defensive Team for 2010 and finished his college basketball career ranked 10th on Duke's all-time list in offensive rebounds (255). In 40 games (39 starts) as a senior, he averaged 4.8 points and 4.9 rebounds in 25.3 minutes per game.
