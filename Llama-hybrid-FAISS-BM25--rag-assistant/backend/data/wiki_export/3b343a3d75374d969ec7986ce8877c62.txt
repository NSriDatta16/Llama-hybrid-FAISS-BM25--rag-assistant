On January 18, 2011, Hennig announced that she was leaving Days of Our Lives. She was quoted in Soap Opera Digest, saying: "It just feels right. I have been preparing for this for a while, so I have said my mental good-byes. I will miss the faces I see here every day, but everybody has been really encouraging and has embraced my decision... I feel like I'm going out with a bang after last week's show airs and I feel great about it creatively and I am thankful to the writers for giving me that. It's been a lot of fun to play and I wouldn't change anything."

From 2011 to 2012, she played Diana Meade, a main character in the TV series The Secret Circle, based on the books written by L. J. Smith.
