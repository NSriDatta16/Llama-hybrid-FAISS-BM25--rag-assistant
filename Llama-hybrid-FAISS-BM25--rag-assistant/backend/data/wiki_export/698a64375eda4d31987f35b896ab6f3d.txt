2-Phenylphenol, or o-phenylphenol, is an organic compound.  In terms of structure, it is one of the monohydroxylated isomers of biphenyl.   It is a white solid. It is a biocide used as a preservative with E number E231 and under the trade names Dowicide, Torsite, Fungal, Preventol, Nipacide and many others.

Uses
The primary use of 2-phenylphenol is as an agricultural fungicide.  It is generally applied post-harvest. It is a fungicide used for waxing citrus fruits. It is no longer a permitted food additive in the European Union, but is still allowed as a post-harvest treatment in 4 EU countries.

2-Phenylphenol is found in low concentrations in some household products such as spray disinfectants and aerosol or spray underarm deodorants.

The sodium salt of orthophenyl phenol, sodium orthophenyl phenol, is a preservative, used to treat the surface of citrus fruits.

Orthophenyl phenol is also used as a fungicide in food packaging and may migrate into the contents.

Preparation
It is prepared by condensation of cyclohexanone to give cyclohexenylcyclohexanone.  The latter undergoes dehydrogenation to give 2-phenylphenol.

Safety
