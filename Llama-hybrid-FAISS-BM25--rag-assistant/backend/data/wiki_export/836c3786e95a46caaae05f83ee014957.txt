Yttrium arsenide is an inorganic compound of yttrium and arsenic with the chemical formula YAs. It can be prepared by reacting yttrium and arsenic at high temperature. Some literature has done research on the eutectic system of it and zinc arsenide.

It reacts with iron, iron(III) arsenide, iron(III) oxide and yttrium(III) fluoride (for doping) at high temperature to obtain superconducting material YFeAsO0.9F0.1 (Tc=10.2 K).
