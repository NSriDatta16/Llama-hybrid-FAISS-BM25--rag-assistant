Historic status
Within the park is the site of the Timucuan village of Nocoroco, located on the Tomoka River. Researchers suggest that the land containing the Tomoka Mound Complex just south of the Nocoroco village site was occupied as early as 5000 B.C. It was also the location of a plantation owned by Richard Oswald, a wealthy Scottish merchant, who owned the plantation throughout the British rule of Florida. It became a state park in 1945. On May 7, 1973, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.
