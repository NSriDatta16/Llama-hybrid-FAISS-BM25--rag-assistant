Peter Alan Baker (born 7 October 1967) is an English professional golfer. He had three wins on the European Tour, one in 1988 and two in 1993. He represented Europe in the 1993 Ryder Cup.

Amateur career
Baker learned golf at his father's nine-hole Himley Hall course and was taught by Sandy Lyle's father Alex. In 1985, he was the joint winner of the Brabazon Trophy, after a tie with Roger Roper. He represented Great Britain & Ireland in the 1985 Walker Cup and turned professional the following year.

Professional career
Baker was a consistent performer on the European Tour from the late 1980s until the early years of the new Millennium, with three tournament wins on the tour and a highest Order of Merit finish of seventh in 1993. His one Ryder Cup appearance for Europe came in the losing 1993 team. He won three of his four matches, winning two fourball matches, playing with Ian Woosnam, and beating Corey Pavin in the singles.

In 2007 Baker won two events on the second-tier Challenge Tour, the Credit Suisse Challenge and the Open AGF-Allianz Côtes d’Armor Bretagne on his 40th birthday. He also won the Mauritius Open at the end of 2007, beating José-Filipe Lima by three shots. In 2009 he had his third Challenge Tour success, winning the Credit Suisse Challenge for the second time.

Since reaching 50, he has played on the European Senior Tour. He won the 2019 Arras Open Senior Hauts de France, 5 strokes ahead of James Kingston.
