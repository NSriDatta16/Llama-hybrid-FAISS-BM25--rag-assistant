Students from Andover Borough, and Andover and Green townships, attend the high school as part of sending/receiving relationships.

History
Newton's residents approved a 1916 referendum to build a high school. A winning bid was accepted that year, but delays related to obtaining workers and inflated costs during World War I delayed completion of the construction. This original building is now Halsted Middle School, with a new building being constructed on Ryerson Avenue in the 1950s. Newton High School had served the region, with 13 districts paying tuition to send students as part of sending/receiving relationships.

The opening of High Point Regional High School in September 1966 ended the attendance of students from Branchville Borough, Frankford Township and Lafayette Township.

The Newton Public School District was notified in August 1974 that students from Fredon Township, Hampton Township, Sandyston Township, Stillwater Township and Walpack Township would leave Newton High School with the opening of Kittatinny Regional High School in 1975, which resulted in a drop of 400 students in the Newton district.
