Edward Ray Fiori (born April 21, 1953) is an American professional golfer who has played on the PGA and Champions Tour.

Early life and education 
Fiori was born in Lynwood, California. During his childhood, Fiori would sneak through a barbed wire fence to a nine-hole course near his home in Downey, California, to practice his game. He attended the University of Houston where he played on the golf team. He turned pro in 1977 and joined the PGA Tour in 1978.

Career 
Fiori won four tournaments on the PGA Tour. His first win was at the 1979 Southern Open. His last victory at the 1996 Quad City Classic led to the postponement of his plans to retire from the game and become a charter-boat captain. Fiori's previous PGA tour victory was at the 1982 Bob Hope Desert Classic, and Fiori beat Tiger Woods at Quad Cities for Woods's first title. This would be the only time in his career that Woods would fail to win until Y. E. Yang outplayed Fiori in the 2009 PGA Championship.

Personal life 
Fiori has been plagued with weight-related health problems, including spinal fusion surgery. He lives in the Houston suburb of Sugar Land, Texas.
