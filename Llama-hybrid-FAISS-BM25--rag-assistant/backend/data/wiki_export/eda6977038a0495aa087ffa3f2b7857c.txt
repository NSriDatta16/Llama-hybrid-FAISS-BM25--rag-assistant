Philadelphia Ballet, formerly known as Pennsylvania Ballet, was Philadelphia's largest ballet company until its rebranding in 2021. The company's annual local season features six programs of classic pieces, like George Balanchine's The Nutcracker, in addition to presentations of new works. The company's artistic director is Angel Corella.

Company history

Pennsylvania Ballet was established in 1963 by Barbara Weisberger, a protégée of George Balanchine, through a Ford Foundation initiative to develop regional professional dance companies. A Philadelphia cultural institution, the company is noted for its focus on the Balanchine repertoire.

The company performed in the national spotlight for the first time in 1968 at the New York City Center, a debut that led to a decade of national touring, appearances on PBS's Dance in America series, and a stint as the official company of the Brooklyn Academy of Music during the 1970s.

In 1982, Pennsylvania Ballet became the first major American ballet company to promote an African-American woman, Debra Austin, to principal dancer. Between 1987 and 1989, Pennsylvania Ballet forged an alliance with Milwaukee Ballet in an unprecedented venture to create one company. The new organization, with 43 dancers, was the first in the country to offer its dancers year-round employment.

In 1995, the trustees of Pennsylvania Ballet selected its first home-grown artistic director, Roy Kaiser. A former principal dancer, Kaiser had been hired as a company member in 1979 by Barbara Weisberger. Following his retirement from the stage in 1992, Kaiser served as principal ballet master and associate artistic director under Christopher d'Amboise before being named to his current position.

Under Kaiser's leadership, the company expanded its Balanchine-based repertoire to include new works from both established and emerging choreographers. New works included premieres of original ballets from choreographers Merce Cunningham, Christopher d'Amboise, Trey McIntyre, Matthew Neenan, David Parsons, Val Caniparoli, Benjamin Millepied, and Christopher Wheeldon, as well as the highly acclaimed 40th-anniversary commission of Swan Lake by Christopher Wheeldon and the 2007 world premiere of Matthew Neenan's Carmina Burana. Currently employing 37 dancers, Pennsylvania Ballet annually presents a season of six programs, which includes their annual signature production of George Balanchine's The Nutcracker. The season balances classic ballets with new works and challenges the dancers while attracting a diverse audience. The company also tours throughout Pennsylvania and elsewhere, including venues such as New York City Center and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington DC. Pennsylvania Ballet made its international debut at the Edinburgh International Festival in August 2005.

Fourteen members of the Pennsylvania Ballet appeared as the corps in the 2010 film Black Swan. In September 2014, Ángel Corella was named artistic director.

In July 2021, Pennsylvania Ballet rebranded and became the Philadelphia Ballet. After nearly 60 years of artistic legacy and performance in Philadelphia, this name change reflected the company's commitment to its history, inspiration, and identity. The Philadelphia Ballet II (the company's second company) provides outreach and educational performances.

Matthew Neenan, Philadelphia Ballet's first choreographer in residence, danced for the company from 1994 to 2007.
