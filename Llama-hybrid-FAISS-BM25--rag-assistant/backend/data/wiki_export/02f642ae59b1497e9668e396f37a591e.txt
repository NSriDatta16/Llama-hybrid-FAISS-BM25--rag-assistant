State Road 435 (SR 435), signed as Kirkman Road along its entire route, is a state highway in Florida, existing entirely within Orange County.  Kirkman Road is a major arterial on the west side of Orlando, and bounds the east side of Universal Orlando Resort.  It also connects on its south end into a Lockheed Martin research facility.

Route description
Kirkman Road begins at a trumpet interchange with Sand Lake Road. Not too long after, Kirkman Road intersects International Drive, followed by an interchange with Interstate 4 (I-4), and one of the entrances to Universal Orlando Resort. After this, Kirkman Road continues for another , passing by many hotels and resorts before its final major intersection with the tolled Eastâ€“West Expressway, and then finally terminates at State Road 50 (Colonial Drive) soon after.

Construction
Work began in April 2023 to rebuild the south terminus of Kirkman Road at Sand Lake Road to interface with Universal Epic Universe. A circle ramp will be constructed to feed into the new theme park and separate its traffic from traffic going into Lockheed Martin's research facility. Universal Studios is contributing $160 million of the total $301 million construction costs. The intersection is planned to be completed in late 2024 ahead of the 2025 opening of Epic Universe.
