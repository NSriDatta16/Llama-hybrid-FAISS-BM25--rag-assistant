Zima Blue and Other Stories (2006, , republished in 2009 as Zima Blue, ) is the first collection of short works by Alastair Reynolds. It was published in September 2006, by Night Shade Books. It includes ten stories, most of them long out of print. None of the stories in it are set in Reynolds's well-known Revelation Space universe, although Galactic North, a collection of most of Reynolds's Revelation Space short stories, was released soon after.

There is a limited edition (2006, ) with an extra story, "Digital to Analogue", and with Reynolds's signature. "Digital to Analogue" was originally published in the 1992 anthology In Dreams.

A new version of the collection was published in April 2009  and contained all the stories listed below as well as Minla's Flowers (currently available in The New Space Opera), Cardiff Afterlife (a sequel of sorts to Signal to Noise) and Everlasting (first published in Interzone, Summer 2005).
