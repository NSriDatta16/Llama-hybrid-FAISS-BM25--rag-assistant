Grant was acting commander of 2nd Division, VI Corps, at the height of its stand against the Confederate assault at Cedar Creek.
   
He was recommended August 22, 1866, for appointment as a field officer in the regular army by General Ulysses S. Grant, and was appointed August 29, 1866, as lieutenant colonel of the 36th U.S. Infantry, to date from July 28, 1866, but declined the appointment.
