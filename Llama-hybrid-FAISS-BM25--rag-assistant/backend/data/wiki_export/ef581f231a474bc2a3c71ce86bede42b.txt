Career
Desperation Band was first formed in 2001, when New Life Church pastor David Perkins suggested that Jon Egan, Jared Anderson, and Glenn Packiam play together with their bands at the first Desperation Conference. Held annually in July, Desperation Conferences draw thousands of college and high school students.

The song "I Am Free", written by band co-founder Jon Egan and recorded by the band for 2004's From the Rooftops, was later covered by the Newsboys, for whom it became a hit single.
