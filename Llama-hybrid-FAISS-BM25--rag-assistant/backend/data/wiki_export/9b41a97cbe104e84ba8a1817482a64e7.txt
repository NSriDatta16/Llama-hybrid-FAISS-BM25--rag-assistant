Former schools
Cheesequake Elementary School (287)
It was the oldest building in the district. The district felt that the building did not have sufficient parking. In 2019 it had 280 students and 25 students.
In January 2019, after the State of New Jersey reduced funding, David Cittadino, the superintendent, announced it would likely close the school. The district was to have $12,000,000 fewer dollars in its budget for a five year period, and the district leadership publicly stated that the state caused Cheesequake to close. The Cheesequake closure would mean the district would spend $750,000 fewer. It closed in 2019. Schools that took former Cheesequake students were Madison Park, McDivitt, Memorial and Shepard. In 2020 Sayreville Public Schools planned to rent the facilities temporarily after the closure.

Administration
Core members of the district's administration are:
David Cittadino, superintendent
Joseph J. Marra, business administrator and board secretary
