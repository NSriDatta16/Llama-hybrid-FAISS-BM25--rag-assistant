Deh Shiva Bar Mohe Eha (Gurmukhi: ਦੇਹ ਸਿਵਾ ਬਰ ਮੋਹਿ ਇਹੈ) is one of the most celebrated and widely quoted hymns by Guru Gobind Singh.

History 
It is taken from the Chandi Charitar Ukati Bilas composition of the Dasam Granth, and is generally understood as being composed by Guru Gobind Singh. It is written in the form of a quatrain or savaiya. Sikh groups have incorporated it as a national anthem for Sikhs. The composition has been interpreted by some, such as Rajinder Sareen, as evidence that the Guru was a Shaivist, but this has been disputed by others, such as Karnail Singh, as a misinterpretation of the meaning of the verses. Karnail Singh also claims that in-actuality, the hymn was written by Shyam, allegedly one of the fifty two poets in the court of the tenth master. The work is used as a prayer within Sikh schools and the Sikh Regiment of the Indian Army. The composition is also a jaikara (battle cry) for Sikh warriors.
