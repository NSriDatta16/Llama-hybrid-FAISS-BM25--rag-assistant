Southchurch is a suburb and former civil parish in Southend-on-Sea in the ceremonial county of Essex, England. England. In 2011 the ward had a population of 9,710.

History
In 824 AD, a Saxon thegn, Leofstan presented the manor of Southchurch to the monks of Canterbury. It is possible that the church from which the manor takes its name already existed beforehand. The name "Southchurch" originates from a Saxon church which was south of a pre-Norman minster.

In 1897 the parish of Southchurch was absorbed into the neighbouring municipal borough of Southend-on-Sea. The parish was thereafter an urban parish and so had no parish council of its own, being administered directly by Southend-on-Sea Corporation. In 1911 the parish had a population of 3,954. On 9 November 1913 the parishes within the borough were all abolished to form a single parish covering the same area as the borough.

Location 
Southchurch is bounded by Southchurch Avenue to the west (beyond which is central Southend-on-Sea), Thorpe Hall Avenue to the east (beyond which is Thorpe Bay), Eastern Avenue to the north (beyond which is Bournes Green) and Eastern Esplanade to the south (which runs along the north bank of the River Thames). Principal roads include Southchurch Road, Southchurch Boulevard, Woodgrange Drive, Ambleside Drive, Wyatts Drive and Lifstan Way.

Housing
The current local housing stock mainly dates from the first half of the twentieth century, when Southchurch expanded from a village into the residential district of Southend. To the south of the station is Southchurch Hall, a thirteenth-century moated manor house. This is now open to the public as a museum, which stands in a small park: Southchurch Hall Gardens.

It began as a mission church in Elizabeth Road, which runs from the seafront to Southchurch Park.
