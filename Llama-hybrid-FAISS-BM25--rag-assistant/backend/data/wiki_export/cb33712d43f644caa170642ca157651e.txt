Delirium Books, launched in the summer of 1999 by Shane Ryan Staley, is a horror publisher in the collector's market, producing low print-run limited editions intended for both collectors and readers alike. Delirium Books first published The Rising, the first book in a series of zombie-themed horror novels written by author Brian Keene, winning the Bram Stoker Award for Best First Novel in 2003 and helping to usher in the new era of zombie popularity in the mid-2000s.

In 2005, Delirium Books won the prestigious Bram Stoker Award for Excellence in Specialty Press Publishing, presented by the HWA (Horror Writer's Association). The same year, Delirium took home the first annual Shocker Award for Small Press of the Year, presented by Shocklines.com, one of the biggest independent horror booksellers in the U.S.
