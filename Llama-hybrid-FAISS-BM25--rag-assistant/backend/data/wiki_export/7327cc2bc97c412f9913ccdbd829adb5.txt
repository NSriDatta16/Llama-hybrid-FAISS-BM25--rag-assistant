Dipterocarpus humeratus is a species of tree in the family Dipterocarpaceae. The species name humeratus is derived from Latin ( = shoulder) and refers to the articulated petiole. D. humeratus is an emergent tree, up to 50Â m tall, found in mixed dipterocarp forests on well-drained clay soils. The species is found scattered or semi-gregarious on undulating land and clay ridges below 700 m elevation. It is found in Sumatra and Borneo (Brunei, Sabah, Sarawak and Kalimantan) and occurs in at least three protected areas (Sepilok Forest Reserve, Ulu Temburong and Gunung Mulu National Parks).
