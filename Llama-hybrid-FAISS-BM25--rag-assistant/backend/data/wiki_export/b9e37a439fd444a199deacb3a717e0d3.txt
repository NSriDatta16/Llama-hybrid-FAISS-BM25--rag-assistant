Roy Frumkes is an American independent filmmaker. Frumkes directed the 1985 documentary Document of the Dead, a film detailing the production of Dawn of the Dead.

Biography
The cooperation of George A. Romero allowed Frumkes extensive access to the creative process of the filmmaker, and the finished product is as much an overview and analysis of Romero's early career as a "making-of" documentary. In Video Watchdog magazine, critic Tim Lucas called Document of the Dead "an intelligent, arresting, and authoritative examination of Romero's working filmmaking style..." Frumkes added new codas to the film in 1989, and for the 2005 DVD release Dawn of the Dead: Ultimate Edition, which collected multiple cuts of the film and a cut of Document of the Dead. The full-length Document of the Dead was released on DVD by Synapse Films in 1998.

As a screenwriter, Frumkes has written the 1996 thriller The Substitute and three sequels, and the cult black comedy Street Trash (1987), which he also produced.

In 2006, Frumkes put the finishing touches to the documentary The Meltdown Memoirs. which depicts the production of the film Street Trash along with cast and crew interviews 20 years later.

On March 22, 2010, Frumkes claimed in Fangoria magazine that he would produce a remake of the 1958 British science fiction horror film Fiend Without a Face but it was never made.

He is the owner-editor of Films in Review, the oldest motion picture journal in the United States.

Frumkes taught film studies at New York City's School of Visual Arts but along with another teacher, Robert Haufrecht, was fired in May 2018 after an investigation into multiple accusations of sexual misconduct and harassment stretching back decades. Additionally, both men's profiles have been completely erased from the school's website. Frumkes has not responded to requests for comment on the matter and no new work or projects have appeared from him since that date.
