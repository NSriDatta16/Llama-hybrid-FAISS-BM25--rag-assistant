Steven J. Schloeder (born 1960 in Brooklyn, N.Y.) is a theologian, architect, and author.

Early life and career 
Steven Joseph Schloeder received the bachelor of architecture cum laude from Arizona State University in 1984.

After acquiring professional registration in the State of Arizona, Schloeder received the Rotary International Graduate Scholarship and completed the Master in Architecture degree at the University of Bath, studying under Prof. Michael Brawne. His thesis, The Architecture of the Vatican Two Church, established a theory of sacramental architecture in criticism and rejection of the tenets of architectural modernism, proposing a metalanguage of sacred architecture which participates in the formal structure of the human body, the tent/ house/ temple, and the city. The thesis was published as Architecture in Communion  by Ignatius Press, San Francisco, 1998.

Schloeder received the Presidential Fellowship at the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, CA, where he attained the Ph.D. in theology, working under Rev. Dr. Michael Morris, OP. His dissertation, The Church of the Year 2000: A dialogue on Catholic Architecture for the Third Millennium, critically examined the architectural competition for the Jubilee Church and the works of Richard Meier, Tadao Ando, Peter Eisenman, Günter Behnisch, Santiago Calatrava, and Frank Gehry.

Schloeder is a licensed architect (Arizona, California), practicing nationally in the United States in all aspects of Roman Catholic sacred architecture, through his firm Liturgical Environs, PC.  He currently works for the Pennsylvania Department of General Services.
