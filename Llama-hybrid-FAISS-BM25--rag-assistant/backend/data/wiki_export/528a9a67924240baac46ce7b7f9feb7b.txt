Andrew Simon Hodgson (born ) is primarily known as an auctioneer/presenter, first on the British television shopping channel bid tv, and since then as a presenter on TJC.

Bid TV 
Hodgson used to be seen presenting bid tv on Sunday between 3.00 pm and 6.30 pm, as well as being a stand-in presenter at other times of the week. He presented on the channel since its inception in the year 2000. He also provided the voice-over for the majority of their advertising, as well as appearing in-vision for several of them.

His sales technique differed to the other styles of his fellow presenters, and he has been compared with fictional Norwich chat show host Alan Partridge. He often joked with the production staff and assistants whilst presenting. One such assistant was the unseen warehouse assistant called "Bob the Warehouse".

When bidders phoned the channel to bid for an item, Hodgson's voice greeted them with a pre-recorded message detailing the item they were purchasing. Behind the scenes, he was also the Controller of Channels.

Hodgson announced in 2010, after a decade at the channel, that he would be leaving his permanent role as Controller of Channels and TV Revenue.

Other television appearances
Hodgson provided a running commentary over an episode of The Day Today on the DVD of the series. Writer and Alan Partridge co-creator Armando Iannucci (of The Friday Night Armistice fame) hired Andy to play a brutally murdered interior designer in his BBC Three show 2004: The Stupid Version as well as a Home Shopping TV presenter in his 2006 BBC Two production Time Trumpet. In 2003 he appeared on Channel 4 reality show The Salon to conduct a charity auction.

Additionally, Hodgson has been seen in 2008 on ITV1's daytime programme This Morning as a gadget expert.

In 2015 Hodgson presented Win Cash Live, an interactive gambling programme shown on STV.

In 2016 Hodgson appeared as a presenter on Create and Craft USA broadcasting across America. He also appeared on Channel 5 as a reporter for The Championship show, London Live as a football journo, and FanTV with Justin Lee Collins.

Since 2020, Hodgson has presented on shopping channel TJC.
