Benjamín Rivera Noriega Airport  is a public use airport on the island of Culebra in Puerto Rico. The airport is owned by the Puerto Rico Ports Authority. It is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015, which categorized it as a general aviation airport. However, the airport does offer scheduled passenger service.

History 
The airport of Culebra was originally built as a military airport by the United States Marine Corps, opening in 1957. In 1965, the government of Puerto Rico started flying civilians from San Juan to the island with a Legislative compensation.

After the Navy-Culebra protests, the Puerto Rico Ports Authority started administering the civilian flight operations in Culebra, inaugurating the first passenger terminal on October 24, 1976. The airport and its 80 acres were officially transferred to the Ports Authority in 1980.

A new passenger terminal was inaugurated in 1994, and its name was changed to Benjamín Rivera Noriega, in honor of a pilot from Ciales. He became a community leader recognized by his service to the residents of Culebra.

Facilities and aircraft 
Benjamín Rivera Noriega Airport covers an area of 15 acres (6 ha) at an elevation of 49 feet (15 m) above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 13/31 with an asphalt surface measuring 2,600 by 50 feet (792 x 15 m).

The airport is noted for the mountain less than  from the north end of the runway. This obstacle and the short length of the runway keep jet aircraft from using this airport. Commercial operations are currently limited to  propeller aircraft with 10 seats or less. The approach to this airport is considered good practice for pilots before flying to Saint Barthélemy Airport.

The St Thomas VOR/DME (Ident: STT) is located  east of the airport. The Roosevelt Roads TACAN (Ident: NRR) is located  west-southwest of the airport.
