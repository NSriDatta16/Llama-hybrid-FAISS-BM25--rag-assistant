Malice in Wonderland is the eleventh studio album by the Scottish hard rock band Nazareth, released in January 1980. After the heavy lurch of the previous album, the band chose to follow a more commercial path and the album produced the hit singles "Holiday" and "Heart's Grown Cold". This is the second and last studio album to feature guitarist Zal Cleminson of the Sensational Alex Harvey Band as a member of the band.

The album was re-issued on Compact Disc in June 1990.The larger 2010 edition brought a range of bonus tracks, all extracted from a concert at the legendary Hammersmith Odeon, which were broadcast by the BBC for the In Concert program in 1980. It is a very varied album, with melodic and heavy songs like "Talkin' to One of the Boys" and "Showdown at the Border" and the flirtation with a reggae feeling in "Big Boy".
