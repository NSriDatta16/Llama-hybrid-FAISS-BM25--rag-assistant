Espen Beranek Holm (born 23 March 1960) is a Norwegian pop artist and comedian.

Career
Beranek is a Norwegian solo artist. His debut single Dra te' hælvete (1981), which was a great success, caused controversy when the song was banned by NRK. It was followed up by the albums Sound of Danger (1981), X-Ray (1983), Trigger (1984), Daylight In the Dark (1986), The Red File (1988) and Tacoma Bridge (1994). He provided synth, guitar, bass, drums and vocal on all albums, and produced all albums himself. Jean Jaques Burnel from the Stranglers recorded one track together with Beranek on Trigger. He also produced a couple of tracks for Daylight In the Dark as well as providing bass and backing vocals. Dave Greenfield from the Stranglers also contributed to the album with some synth-work together with pedal steel guitarist B.J.Cole.

Beranek has been a member of the bands Dei Nye Kappelanane, Langsomt Mot Nord, Spastisk Ekstase and Ung Pike Forsvunnet. He is currently the vocalist and playing guitar in the Oslo-based power trio Oslo Plektrum.

Beranek was also one of the main participants in the satiric radio program Hallo i uken in NRK P2 until the summer of 2009, together with Are Kalvø and Else Michelet, and was very frequently on the comedy television show Løvebakken, a local version of If I Ruled The World, aired from 2002 through 2012 on NRK.

Beranek´s first release in nearly 20 years, Sensitive Dependence, was released in October 2013.
