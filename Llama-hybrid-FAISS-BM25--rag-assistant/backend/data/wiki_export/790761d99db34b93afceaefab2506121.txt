The Mosaic Company is a Fortune 500 company based in Tampa, Florida which mines phosphate, potash, and collects urea for fertilizer, through various international distribution networks, and Mosaic Fertilizantes. It is the largest U.S. producer of potash and phosphate fertilizer.

Overview
The Mosaic Company was formed in October 2004 by a merger between IMC Global, a fertilizer company formed in 1909, and Cargill's crop nutrition division.
It is a combined producer and marketer of concentrated phosphate and potash with a customer base which includes wholesalers, retail dealers and individual growers worldwide. Its headquarters are in Tampa, Florida and it employs approximately 13,000 people in eight countries.

Products

Potash

Mosaic has approximately 10.4 million tonnes of operational potash capacity. Mosaic currently owns potash mines or surface mills at; Belle Plaine, Colonsay, Esterhazy K1, Esterhazy K2, Esterhazy K3 and Carlsbad, with another potash mine recently purchased in Brazil during the Vale Fertilizantes acquisition. Colonsay mine and mill has been indefinitely idled and is currently in care and maintenance mode. Esterhazy K3, currently in development, consists of an underground mine and service/production shafts separate from the K1 and K2 underground mine that is beginning to supply the K1 and K2 surface facilities with ore. Esterhazy K3 does not have surface milling and storage facilities, instead it is intended to replace the ore currently mined from the K1 and K2 mine. This shift in production will decrease brine management costs of the K1 and K2 mine, which stood at $108.0 million for 2020.

Mosaic is a member of Canpotex, an export association of Canadian potash producers through which they sell their Canadian potash outside the U.S. and Canada.

Potash mines are located in:
 Carlsbad, New Mexico ()
 Belle Plaine, Saskatchewan ()
 Colonsay, Saskatchewan ()
 Esterhazy, Saskatchewan K1 ()
 Esterhazy, Saskatchewan K2 ()
 Esterhazy, Saskatchewan K3 ()

Phosphate
Mosaic has approximately 16.8 million tonnes of operational capacity for finished concentrated phosphates.  Mosaic is the largest producer of finished phosphate products with an annual capacity greater than the next two largest producers combined. It has a global distribution network made up of plants, port facilities, warehouses and sales offices. In 2013 Mosaic produced 7.6 million tons of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients and over 15 million tons of phosphate rock production. In October, 2013, Mosaic reached an agreement to purchase the phosphate operations of CF Industries for 1.4 billion dollars, which eliminates the need for Mosaic to spend an additional billion dollars to build a new processing facility in Hardee County, Florida to process the rock from their mines in that area.

Phosphate mines are located in the Bone Valley Formation of the Peace River watershed in Central Florida:
 Fort Meade ()
 South Pasture ()
 Four Corners ()
 Wingate Creek ()
 Fort Lonesome ()(Closed)

Mosaic owns a 25% stake of the Ma'aden Wa'ad Al Shamal Phosphate Company joint venture in Saudi Arabia.

With the completion of the Vale Fertilizantes acquisition in January, 2018, an additional 5 Brazilian phosphate rock mines, 4 chemical plants and an additional 40% economic interest in the Miski Mayo mine were purchased.

Carbon footprint
The Mosaic Company reported Total CO2e emissions (Direct + Indirect) for 31 December 2020 at 4,920 Kt (+340/+7.4% y-o-y). There is little evidence of a consistent declining trend as yet.
