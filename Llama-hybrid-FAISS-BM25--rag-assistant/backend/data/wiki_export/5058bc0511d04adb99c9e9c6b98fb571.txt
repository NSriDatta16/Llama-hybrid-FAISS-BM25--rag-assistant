Production
Truth N' Time was recorded at Green's American Music studio. Green produced the album.

Critical reception
The Bay State Banner wrote: "The inclusion of 'To Sir With Love' and 'Say A Little Prayer' can be questioned, but Al stomps and cuts through them just like a thoroughbred racer. Some really tremendous session work also, though minus the quiet excellence of drummer Howard Grimes." 

In a 2006 review of a reissue, Rolling Stone stated that Truth n' Time "contains too much filler for an album not even twenty-seven minutes long."
