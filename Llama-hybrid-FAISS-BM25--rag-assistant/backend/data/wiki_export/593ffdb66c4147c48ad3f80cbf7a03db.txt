Radoslav Látal (born 6 January 1970) is a Czech football manager and former player who played as a midfielder. He is in charge of Czech First League side Jablonec.

Club career
At a club level, Látal began to play football in SK Sigma Olomouc, where he also played most of his Czech First League career. In 1994, he moved to Germany to play for FC Schalke 04, where he stayed until 2001. In 2002, Látal moved to FC Baník Ostrava and was a member of the squad in the 2003–04 season, when Baník won the league title. He also won the Czech Cup with Baník in 2005. After that season, he ended his professional career.

International career
He played for the Czech Republic, for which he appeared in 47 matches and participated at the Euro 1996 and Euro 2000. On 11 June 2000, he was dismissed by referee Pierluigi Collina in the closing moments of the Czechs' Euro 2000 game against the Netherlands. Látal, who had already been substituted in that match, was punished for what were perceived to be inappropriate words, following Collina's decision to award the Dutch a last-minute penalty.

Látal also played for Czechoslovakia at the 1989 FIFA World Youth Championship in Saudi Arabia.

Managerial career
He became manager of SFC Opava in 2008 and went on to Sokolov in September 2010. In March 2012 he signed a contract at Baník Ostrava lasting until summer 2013, taking over from Pavel Malura. He was fired from FC Baník Ostrava in October 2012 due to a run of bad results that put his team in the last place of Czech First League.

On 10 January 2022, it was confirmed that Látal would take over from Michał Probierz at the Bruk-Bet Termalica Sports Stadium. Látal's first competitive game in charge of Bruk-Bet Termalica ended in a 2–1 home victory against Jagiellonia Białystok on 4 February 2022. On 16 June 2023, five days after losing the promotion play-offs final to Puszcza Niepołomice at home, it was announced Látal would leave the club at the end of the month. On 30 June 2023 Látal signed with Jablonec.
