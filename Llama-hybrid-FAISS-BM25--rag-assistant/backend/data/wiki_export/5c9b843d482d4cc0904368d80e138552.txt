The AMT Auto Mag V is a large single action semi-automatic pistol made by Arcadia Machine and Tool (AMT). The weapon was created by Harry Sanford, inventor of the original .44 Auto Mag pistol.

Production quantity was planned to be 3000 units, numbered 0001-3000 to 3000-3000, but this goal was never reached. The MK V used the same frame as the MK IV, and pistols with MK V frames have been discovered with MK IV slides and vice versa.

Design 
The AMT Auto Mag V was designed to fire the .50 Action Express cartridge, and its barrel had compensator ports to help keep muzzle rise to tolerable levels. It was made primarily of cast stainless steel, and was designed to accept a 5-round magazine.
