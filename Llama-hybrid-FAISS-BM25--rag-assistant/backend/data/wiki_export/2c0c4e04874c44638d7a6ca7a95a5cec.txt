The Pacific Gateway is a strategy of the Government of British Columbia to build new and upgraded road, rail, port and airport infrastructure which will provide importers with a reliable link in the North American supply chain and exporters with greater access to foreign markets. It is similar to the federal government's Asiaâ€“Pacific Gateway and Corridor Initiative.
