Jean-Pierre Maïone-Libaude was a French veteran of the Algerian War (1954–62), former member of the OAS' Commando Delta, a nationalist terrorist group. He then became the informant of police officer Lucien Aimé-Blanc, former vice chief of staff of the Antigang brigade and of the Narcotics brigade. Jean-Pierre "Maïon" was assassinated on 13 June 1982 at Argent-sur-Sauldre, in the Cher province, soon after being free from prison. In 2006, Lucien Aimé-Blanc revealed that Maïon had acknowledged having assassinated Pierre Goldman in 1979 on behalf of the GAL Spanish death squad. Aimé-Blanc also stated that he may have been responsible for the assassination of Henri Curiel in 1978.
