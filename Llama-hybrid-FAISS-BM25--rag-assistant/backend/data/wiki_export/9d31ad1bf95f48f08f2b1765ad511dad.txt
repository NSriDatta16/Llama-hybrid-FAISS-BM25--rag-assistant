Livny () is a town in Oryol Oblast, Russia. As of 2018, it had a population of 47,221.

History
The town is believed to have originated in 1586 as Ust-Livny, a wooden fort on the bank of the Livenka River, although some believe that a town had existed on the spot previous to the Mongol invasion of Rus'. The fortress was important in guarding the southern border of the Grand Duchy of Moscow in the case of a Crimean Tatar raid along the Muravsky Trail.

Thirty years later, Ivan the Terrible sent prince Masalsky to build a town of Livny under the umbrella of a garrison stationed in the fort. It was pillaged and burnt by the Tatars on many occasions. In 1606, the citizens of Livny raised a rebellion against Boris Godunov, killing his governor and proclaiming their allegiance to False Dmitry I. Two years later, Ivan Bolotnikov chose it as a base of his military operations against Vasily IV.

In 1618, the wooden town was burnt by the Cossacks of Petro Konashevych. The Crimeans again attacked the town in 1661, burning it to the ground. As soon as the Tatar attacks ceased, the period of prosperity was ushered. In the 19th century, Livny rivaled Yelets as the main trade center of the area.

During World War II, Livny was occupied by the German Army from 26 November to 25 December 1941. Germany retook Livny (Lauen), briefly in 1942–1943.
