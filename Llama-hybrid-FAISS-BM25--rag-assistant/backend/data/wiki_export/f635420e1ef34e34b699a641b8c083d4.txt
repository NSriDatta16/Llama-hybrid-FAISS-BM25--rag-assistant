A sum-product number in a given number base  is a natural number that is equal to the product of the sum of its digits and the product of its digits. 

There are a finite number of sum-product numbers in any given base . In base 10, there are exactly four  numbers : 0, 1, 135, and 144.

Definition
Let  be a natural number. We define the sum-product function for base , , to be the following:
 
where  is the number of digits in the number in base , and 
 
is the value of each digit of the number. A natural number  is a  number if it is a fixed point for , which occurs if . The natural numbers 0 and 1 are trivial  numbers for all , and all other  numbers are nontrivial  numbers.

For example, the number 144 in base 10 is a sum-product number, because , , and .

A natural number  is a sociable sum-product number if it is a periodic point for , where  for a positive integer , and forms a cycle of period . A  number is a sociable  number with , and an amicable  number is a sociable  number with 

All natural numbers  are preperiodic points for , regardless of the base. This is because for any given digit count , the minimum possible value of  is  and the maximum possible value of  is  The maximum possible digit sum is therefore  and the maximum possible digit product is  Thus, the  function value is  This suggests that  or dividing both sides by ,  Since  this means that there will be a maximum value  where  because of the exponential nature of  and the linearity of  Beyond this value ,  always. Thus, there are a finite number of  numbers, and any natural number is guaranteed to reach a periodic point or a fixed point less than  making it a preperiodic point. 

The number of iterations  needed for  to reach a fixed point is the  function's persistence of , and undefined if it never reaches a fixed point.

Any integer shown to be a sum-product number in a given base must, by definition, also be a Harshad number in that base.

Extension to negative integers
Sum-product numbers can be extended to the negative integers by use of a signed-digit representation to represent each integer.

Programming example
The example below implements the sum-product function described in the definition above to search for  numbers and cycles in Python.
def sum_product(x: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Sum-product number."""
    sum_x = 0
    product = 1
    while x > 0:
        if x % b > 0:
            sum_x = sum_x + x % b
            product = product * (x % b)
        x = x // b
    return sum_x * product

def sum_product_cycle(x: int, b: int) -> list[int]:
    seen = []
    while x not in seen:
        seen.append(x)
        x = sum_product(x, b)
    cycle = []
    while x not in cycle:
        cycle.append(x)
        x = sum_product(x, b)
    return cycle
