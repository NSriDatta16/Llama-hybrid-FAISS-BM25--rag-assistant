Kundasang Valley () is a valley where the Kundasang town is located in Sabah, Malaysia, primarily in the highlands of Sabah southeast side of Mount Kinabalu.

Environment 
The valley were known to be located at the intersection of regional fault zones of Quaternary age, where widespread ground movements pose the main hazard based on a mapped geology since 1958. As a result of extensive exploration of land for agricultural purposes, the rapid opening of new agriculture land in the valley also has caused the temperature in the area to increase significantly.

Features 
The valley is featured with terraced hill slopes planted with highlands vegetables as well a cattle dairy farm dubbed as Sabah's "Little New Zealand" where the cow breed of Holstein Friesian milk and dairy product were produced.
