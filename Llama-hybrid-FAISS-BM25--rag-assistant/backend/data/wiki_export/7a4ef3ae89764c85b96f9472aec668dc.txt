History 
Towns including Colón and Panama City in the Canal Zone had one or more clubs in which British West Indian middling classes played cricket. Cricket became a prime symbol of what Afro-Caribbeans knew made them “Britishers.” As decolonization progressed, the popularity of baseball increased in Panama. The similarity in skills required for cricket and baseball meant that an athlete who primarily practiced one sport could also excel in the other. Oscar Levy was a baseball player who had left Panama in 1920 for the United States. In 1928 the Panama Tribune reported on the success of “famous local pitcher” Chick Levy as a “hero in Cuba.”
