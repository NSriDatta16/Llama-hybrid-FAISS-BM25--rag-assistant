BAFTA Cymru (or BAFTA in Wales or WAFTA) is the Welsh branch of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) and was founded in 1987.

The British Academy Cymru Awards were established in 1991, with the first annual awards ceremony held on 30 November 1991. The annual ceremony takes place in Cardiff to recognise achievement in production, performance and craft categories in Welsh-made films and television programmes and by those of Welsh birth or residence. These are separate from the UK-wide British Academy Television Awards and British Academy Film Awards, although films and programmes recognised by BAFTA Cymru may also feature at BAFTA's national awards.
