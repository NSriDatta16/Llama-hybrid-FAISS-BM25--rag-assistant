Naming rights

The baseball park is located at 650 North Prince Street in the Northwest Corridor neighborhood of Lancaster, Pennsylvania. This agreement was extended in 2013 through the 2019 season.

In November 2015, Clipper Magazine was purchased for an undisclosed amount by Valassis Communications, a Michigan-based direct-mail company. Valassis acquired Clipper Magazine in an effort to accelerate its expansion into local business markets.
