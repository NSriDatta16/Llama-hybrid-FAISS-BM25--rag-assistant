History 
The Papillion-La Vista Public Schools District originated well over a century ago. It is reported to be the first school district to be established in Nebraska Territory, in 1872.

Papillion-La Vista High School dates back to September 1876. Originally housed in a single brick building at the corner of Halleck & Adams Streets, Papillion's only school served students in all 12 grades. In 1893 the school moved to a new brick building at 420 S. Washington Street, the present site of the district offices. The city continued to grow, and in February 1957, Papillion High School opened in a new building across Washington Street (presently Papillion Junior High) to students in grades 7-12.

The city of La Vista incorporated in 1960 and presented no education system.  The students of this new development area north of Papillion had been incorporated into the Papillion School District. Papillion's steady growth continued. By September 1969, voters in the district had passed a bond issue to build a new high school facility at 84th Street and East Centennial Road. A similar bond issue the preceding year had been defeated. The high school moved north to its present location in August 1971, serving students in grades 9 through 12. In 1987, La Vista was officially added to the district and the high school's name was officially changed to Papillion-La Vista High School.

The 1999 film Election was shot mainly in Papillion-La Vista High School.    Papillion-La Vista High School had actual classes going on during much of the filming of Election.  The background noises during much of the film are actual teachers and their students in nearby rooms.

Second high school 
Continued population growth resulted in the construction of Papillion-La Vista South High School (PLSHS), in southwest Papillion, which opened in August 2003.  PLHS had previously been a 10-12 school, and 9th graders had attended classes at the two junior high schools in the district.  After the school district opened a second high school, the freshman class was moved from the junior high schools to the two high schools.
