Paul L. David Athletic Center 

The Paul L. David Athletic Training Center located next to Paul Brown Tiger Stadium was built in 2008 by local philanthropist Jeff David in honor of his late father as part of what was known as the D.R.E.A.M. project. The $3 million, 80,000-square-foot building is the largest indoor football practice facility in the state of Ohio, 20,000-square-feet larger than the facility used by the NFL's Cleveland Browns.  It is also one of the few indoor practice facilities for a high school football team in the nation.
