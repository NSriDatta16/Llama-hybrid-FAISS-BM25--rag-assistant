Little Ocmulgee State Park & Lodge is a  Georgia state park located  north of McRae-Helena on the Little Ocmulgee River. Part of the park was initially built by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression, around the natural diversion of the Little Ocmulgee into a lake. This is a  lake with beach, and the park includes a 60 room lodge and a championship 18-hole golf course with pro shop, known as the Wallace Adams Memorial Golf Course. The soil around the Ocmulgee River and the Little Ocmulgee is a fine white sand, and therefore the lake has its own "beach sand".  Also within the park is the  long Oak Ridge Trail, allowing visitors to see native wildlife and plants.
