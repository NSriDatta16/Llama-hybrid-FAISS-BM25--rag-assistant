Du Cane Court is an Art Deco apartment block on Balham High Road, Balham, south London. A distinctive local landmark, it comprises 677 apartments and was believed to be Europe's largest privately owned apartment block when it was built in 1937.

It was a popular place to live for many music hall stars in the 1930s and 1940s and boasted a social club, on the top floor, before the area was converted into flats. Past residents have included the comedian Tommy Trinder. Currently comedian and writer Arthur Smith, the self-styled 'Bard of Balham', is a resident.

During the Second World War it was speculated that Du Cane Court had escaped bombing because it was planned for use by military officers in the event of a successful German invasion.

Similar Art Deco residential buildings in London include Florin Court, Cholmeley Lodge and Hillfield Court
