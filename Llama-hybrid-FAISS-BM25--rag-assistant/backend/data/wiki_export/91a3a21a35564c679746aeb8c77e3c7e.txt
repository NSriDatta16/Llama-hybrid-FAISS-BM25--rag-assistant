Gillan's Inn is an album by Ian Gillan in celebration of his 40 years as a singer. The first release was a DualDisc composed of both a CD and a DVD side. The CD featured re-recorded tracks from all eras of Ian Gillan's singing career. In a recent interview Gillan observed that, despite the number of participants and guest appearances, this was the easiest project he ever put together. 

A "Deluxe Tour Edition" was released in 2007 containing bonus tracks and an expanded version of the DVD side of the original DualDisc release. The correct bonus tracks included on most versions of the disc are live versions of "Have Love Will Travel" and "Wasted Sunsets", both recorded at the House of Blues in Anaheim on 14 September 2006 (the show which would later be released on the Live in Anaheim CD). There was, however, an error in the manufacturing at one of the plants, where an early version of the master tape was sent by mistake containing a previously unreleased cover version of Marvin Gaye's "Can I Get a Witness?" at track 16 and not including the live bonus tracks. The record label, Immergent, offered to send all owners of the incorrect CD a copy of the proper disc free of charge, and let them keep the original, which is now a collector's item. The CD booklet lists the live bonus tracks on all versions.  The album cover depicts an iconic bar in Buffalo, New York called "The Pink Flamingo", also known as "The Old Pink". The album cover art was created by Don Keller.

This edition also re-instates the new version of Deep Purple's "Demon's Eye" to the CD, which was previously only included on the DVD side of the DualDisc release.

A short American tour commenced to support the release of the album. The set contained various tracks from Ian Gillan's solo work, Gillan and Deep Purple numbers performed with his live band, including songs rarely performed by Deep Purple, such as 'Wasted Sunsets' and 'Not Responsible'. Metallica's Lars Ulrich guested as a drummer during a performance in San Francisco. The set "Live in Anaheim" was released in 2008 on CD & DVD. An Australian 'Gillan's Inn' tour was planned for 2007 but bassist Rodney Appleby got shot by his unsound neighbour. He later would recover in hospital. Because of this, the Australian tour was cancelled.
