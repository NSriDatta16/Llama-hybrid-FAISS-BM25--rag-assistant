The Low Back Merger Shift is a chain shift of vowel sounds found in North American English, beginning among speakers in the last quarter of the 20th century and most significantly involving the lowering and backing of the front vowels. These changes are attested in Canadian English, where they may also be known as the Canadian Shift, and in California English and some younger varieties of Western New England English, Western American English, Pacific Northwest English, and Midland American English, where they are also referred to as the California Shift; whether the similarly structured shifts in these regional dialects have a single unified cause or not is still not entirely clear. Similar, though not identical, changes to the short front vowels are attested in many English dialects as of 21st-century research, including RP, Indian English, Hiberno-English, South African English, and Australian English (the last two dialects traditionally defined by a chain shift moving in the opposite direction of the Canadian Shift). Many such dialects outside of North America lack the low back merger.

The back and downward movement of all the front vowels was first noted in some California speakers in 1987, then in some Canadian speakers in 1995
(initially reported as two separate phenomena),  and later documented among some speakers in Western and Midland U.S. cities born after 1980, based on impressionistic analysis. Assuming the similar chain shifts found in Canada and various parts of the U.S. are a phenomenon with a single common origin, a variety of names have been proposed for this trans-regional chain shift, including the Third Dialect Shift, Elsewhere Shift, Short Front Vowel Shift, North American Shift, and Low Back Merger Shift (the one used in this article).

Canadian Shift in Canada

The shift involves the lowering of the tongue in the front lax vowels  (the short-a of trap),  (the short-e of dress), and  (the short-i of kit).

It is triggered by the cot–caught merger:  (as in cot) and  (as in caught) merge as , a low back rounded vowel.  As each space opens up, the next vowel along moves into it.  Thus, the short a  retracts from a near-low front position to a low central position, with a quality similar to the vowel heard in Northern England .  The retraction of  was independently observed in Vancouver and is more advanced for Ontarians and women than for people from the Prairies or Atlantic Canada and men.  also retracts more before /l/ than other consonants. In Toronto, /æ/-retraction is inhibited by a following nasal, but it isn't in Vancouver.

However, scholars disagree on the behaviour of  and :

 According to Clarke et al. (1995), who impressionistically studied the speech of a few young Ontarians,  and  tend to lower in the direction of  and , respectively. Hence, bet and bit tend to sound, respectively, like bat and bet as pronounced by a speaker without the shift.
 Labov et al. (2006), through acoustic analysis of 33 subjects from all over the country, noted a backward and downward movement of  in apparent time in all of Canada except the Atlantic Provinces. No movement of  was detected.
 Boberg (2005) considers the primary movement of  and  to be retraction, at least in Montreal. He studied a diverse range of English-speaking Montrealers and found that younger speakers had a significantly retracted  and  compared with older speakers but did not find that the vowels were significantly lower. A small group of young people from Ontario were also studied, and there too retraction was most evident. Under this scenario, a similar group of vowels (short front) are retracting in a parallel manner, with  and  approaching each other. Therefore, with Boberg's results, bet approaches but remains different from but, and bit sounds different but remains distinct.
 Hagiwara (2006), through acoustic analysis, noted that  and  do not seem to be lowered in Winnipeg, although the lowering and retraction of  has caused a redistribution of backness values for the front lax vowels.
 Sadlier-Brown and Tamminga (2008) studied a few speakers from Vancouver and Halifax and found the shift to be active in Halifax as well, although not as advanced as in Vancouver. For these speakers, the movement of  and  in apparent time was diagonal, and Halifax had  diagonal movement too; in Vancouver, however, the retraction of  was not accompanied by lowering.

Due to the Canadian Shift, the short-a and the short-o are shifted in opposite directions to that of the Northern Cities Shift, found across the border in the Inland Northern U.S. and  Western New England, which is causing these two dialects to diverge: the Canadian short-a is very similar in quality to the Inland Northern short-o. For example, the production  would be recognized as map in Canada but mop in the Inland North.

U.S. Third Dialect Shifts 

 

In the United States, the cot-caught merger is widespread across many regions of the United States, particularly in the  Midland and  West, but speakers with the merger are often not affected by the shift, possibly due to the fact that the merged vowel is less rounded, less back and slightly lower than the Canadian vowel. This means that there is less space for the retraction of the vowel , which is a key feature of the Canadian Shift. However, there are many regions of the United States where the Canadian Shift can be observed, and this is often more closely linked to the raising or retraction of , rather than the actual low back merger.

California 

The California Shift in progress in California English contains features similar to the Canadian Shift, including the lowering/retraction of the front lax vowels. However, the retraction of  has happened in California even though the Californian  may be more centralized and not as rounded as the Canadian , leading some scholars suggest that the two phenomena are distinct, while others suggest that it was backed "just enough" to allow the shift to happen. Within speakers, the retraction of  is more correlated with the raising of  than with the low back merger.

Other Western States 

The Atlas of North American English finds that, in the Western United States, one out of every four speakers exhibits the Canadian Shift, as defined quantitatively by Labov et al. based on the formant values for , , and . More recent data, however, suggests that the shift is widespread among younger speakers throughout the West.

Stanley (2020) found evidence of the shift in Cowlitz County, Washington, where the formant trajectories of , , and  flattened, causing the onset of  to lower and slightly retract, the onset of  to lower and retract, and the onset of  to retract. However, the speakers in the study tended to pronounce  and  "close" but distinct, with  being further back and more diphthongal. Furthermore, this state of near merger had persisted for all 4 generations in the study. An explanation for this is that while the merger itself was not the trigger for the shift, the backing of  leading to the near-merger of  and  was the trigger.

The Midlands 

Durian (2008) found evidence of the Canadian Shift in the vowel systems of men born in 1965 and later in Columbus, Ohio. This is located in the U.S. Midland. The Midland dialect is a mix of Northern and Southern dialect features. In Columbus,  is undergoing fronting without lowering, while still remaining distinct from the space occupied by . At the same time, historical  (the vowel in "lot") is merged with the  class, which is raising and backing towards , such that the two are merged or "close." This allows a "free space" for the retraction of , which is also suggested as a possibility for Western U.S. dialects by Boberg (2005). In Columbus, the Canadian Shift closely resembles the version found by Boberg (2005) in Montreal, where  and  are either merged or "close," and , , and  show retraction of the nucleus without much lowering (with  also showing "rising diphthong" behavior). However, the retraction of  was not found among all speakers and is more mild among the speakers that do show it than the retraction of  among those speakers. Additionally, the outcome of low back merger-like behavior is more like the California Shift outcome noted above than the rounded variant found in most of Canada.

Western Pennsylvania 

In Pittsburgh, another region where the cot-caught merger is prevalent, the mouth vowel  is usually a monophthong that fills the lower central space, which prevents retracting. However, as  monophthongization declines, some younger speakers are retracting .

NCVS Reversal 

As noted above, the first two stages of the Northern Cities Vowel Shift (NCVS) shift  and  in the exact opposite direction of the Canadian shift. However, the NCVS is gaining stigma among younger speakers, which can trigger the lowering of  and the backing of . In fact, Savage et al. (2015) found that, while the raising of  and fronting of  are stigmatized, the lowering and backing of , a feature of both shifts, is considered prestigious. Nesbitt et al. (2019) say that the Canadian shift may be replacing the NCVS. 

Jacewicz (2011) found the shift in parts of Wisconsin, where, despite the NCVS,  is lowered and backed, and  raises, backs, and diphthongizes to approach , although, like in Columbus and in Cowlitz County, the merger isn't actually complete for most of the speakers in the study, and the lowering of  is more linked with the raising of . In addition,  is lowered and backed which is in alignment with both the NCVS and the Canadian shift.

The South 
Jacewicz (2011) also found evidence for the shift in parts of North Carolina, where the vowels , , and  lower and monophthongize, undoing the Southern shift.  raises, backs and diphthongizes to approach , although the low back merger is not complete for any of the speakers in the study.

In the ANAE, the speech of Atlanta, Georgia is classified as a typologically Midland dialect because it had already lacked the monopthongization of . However, it appears that the monopthongization of  was a feature of Atlantan speech in the early 20th century, and that much younger speakers have undone the reversal of the front lax and tense vowels that is part of the Southern shift, retracted , , and , and have a near merger  and .

New York City 

In New York City, there is evidence of the lowering and retraction of  (except before nasals), , and  particularly among younger non-white speakers. This is despite the fact that Traditional New York City English has an opaque split of the /æ/ phoneme; younger speakers are increasingly lowering  before voiceless fricatives and voiceless stops and raising it before all nasals. This also correlates with retraction of , but not necessarily with the low back merger.
