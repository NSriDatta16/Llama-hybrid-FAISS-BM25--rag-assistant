The 4R01 was a 4-speed automatic transmission from Nissan's Jatco subsidiary for rear wheel drive vehicles with longitudinal engines.

Versions

RL4R01A

The RL4R01A is a hydraulic controlled unit for its main operation. Shift timing is based on throttle cable position and governor pressure. Its only electronic parts are two solenoids, one for the torque converter clutch, and the other for the manual overdrive cancel switch, but these do not affect the gears control and passing.

It is also called JR402 by Jatco.

RE4R01A

The RE4R01A (or Jatco JR402E ) is a fully electronic controlled unit.

It is also called JR402E by Jatco and R4A-EL by Mazda.

Despite the internals are mostly the same, valve bodies, cases and housings have some divergences with the RL4R01A.

RE4R01B

The RE4R01B is a RE4R01A with some little changes, like the valve body, filter, some solenoids and the band.

Like the RE4R01A, it is also called JR402E by Jatco.

Specifications
