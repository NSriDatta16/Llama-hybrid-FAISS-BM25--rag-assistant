George Maharis (September 1, 1928 – May 24, 2023) was an American actor, singer, and visual artist who portrayed Buz Murdock in the first three seasons of the TV series Route 66. Maharis also recorded several pop music albums at the height of his fame, and later starred in the TV series The Most Deadly Game.

Early life and education
Maharis was born in Astoria, Queens, the third of six children born to Vasidos (later William) Mahairas and Demetra Stranis, both immigrants from Greece. He was raised in Hell's Kitchen. His brother Robert was a production assistant on Route 66 and became a film location manager. Maharis attended Flushing High School, where his schoolmates recognized his talent as a singer. He left before graduating and served for 18 months in the United States Marine Corps and then earned his high school diploma. He worked odd jobs while trying to launch a singing career, and appeared in musicals outside of New York City. He got his first break as an actor on the television comedy series Mister Peepers, playing a parody of Marlon Brando. He subsequently studied at the Actors Studio with Sanford Meisner and Lee Strasberg.

Early career
After a short stint at the Cincinnati Playhouse, Maharis returned to New York and won recognition in off-Broadway productions. In 1955, Maharis received critical acclaim for his roles in John Van Druten's play Dancing in the Chequered Shade, and 27 Wagons Full of Cotton. In October 1958, a New York Times critic described his performance in Jean Genet's Deathwatch as "correctly volatile, harsh, soft and cunning". In 1960 he performed in the first U.S. production of a work by Edward Albee, The Zoo Story. Brooks Atkinson wrote that Maharis' performance as the "overwrought yet searching intruder" was "a first-rate piece of acting". Maharis won the Performance award at the Theatre World Awards for his role in The Zoo Story.

He later explained that his off-Broadway experience proved a handicap when seeking Broadway roles: "Off Broadway had a stigma. It was like admitting you played the Borscht Circuit." Instead he found work in television. He appeared on Studio One, Kraft Television Theater, Goodyear Television Playhouse and Stirling Silliphant's Naked City. In Search for Tomorrow, he played a gambler who mistreated his wife. He launched his film career with roles in William Berke's The Mugger (1958) and Otto Preminger's Exodus (1960).

One assessment of his early career put him in the "tough personality" tradition of Humphrey Bogart and John Garfield. Paul Gardner said:

Route 66
Beginning in 1960, Maharis co-starred with Martin Milner in the CBS television series Route 66. His work earned him an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Series in 1962.

After appearing in 82 episodes, Maharis left the series during the third season, citing health problems, including hepatitis. He attributed his prompt recovery to the fact that he did not drink. He returned to work in the spring of 1962 and filmed several shows, but complained he was being made to work excessive hours and left again. He told an interviewer: "If I keep going at the present pace, I'm a fool. Even if you have $4,000,000 in the bank, you can't buy another liver."

A legal battle and harsh words followed. At first Maharis sought no other employment, but once the producers replaced him for the next season he began to book other engagements. He was scheduled to sing on the Ed Sullivan Show on June 16, 1963, until the Route 66 producers, claiming he was still under exclusive contract to them, prevented his appearance by legal action. They claimed he was feigning illness to get out of his contract. One claimed Maharis cared only about a film career and had "no regard for this company, his co-star, Marty Milner, and the 50 or 60 other people on the show". Maharis countered that they needed to learn that "There isn't any more Old Hollywood where a company can buy movie stars like pieces of meat." Maharis soon won the legal argument that his contract was void and although the Route 66 producers attempted a reconciliation, he made his first post-Route 66 television appearance on July 2, 1963. After Maharis' departure, the show's appeal declined. Glenn Corbett acted in the role of Milner's new sidekick, Linc Case. Route 66 was canceled in March 1964.

In November 1963, Maharis described his work on Route 66:

Later career

A string of films followed, including Quick, Before It Melts (1964), The Satan Bug and Sylvia (both 1965), A Covenant with Death and The Happening (both 1967), and The Desperados (1969).

Returning to series television in 1970, Maharis starred as criminologist Jonathan Croft in The Most Deadly Game. The series lasted 13 episodes, ending in January 1971.

Maharis modeled fully nude for the centerfold of the July 1973 issue of Playgirl magazine, one of the first celebrities to do so. It was the magazine's second issue.

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Maharis had featured roles in several television movies and also guest-starred on numerous television series, including Mission: Impossible, Fantasy Island, Kojak, McMillan & Wife, Barnaby Jones, Police Story, Cannon, Night Gallery, and The Bionic Woman. He also appeared in Murder, She Wrote.

Maharis appeared as Count Machelli in the cult classic film The Sword and the Sorcerer (1982). His occasional stage work included starring with the Kenley Players in productions of Barefoot in the Park (1967) and How the Other Half Loves (1973) and in touring company productions of Company (1972) and Guys and Dolls (1976). In the 1980s he performed in Las Vegas. Doppelganger (1993), also known as The Evil Within, was his last appearance in motion pictures.

Visual art and music
Maharis released albums and singles through Epic Records relatively early in his career. His debut album, "George Maharis Sings!", was on the Billboard's Album Chart for 29 weeks in 1962, peaking at number 10. It ended up as the number 41 album of 1962. Maharis had moderate success with his single, "Teach Me Tonight", which was on the Billboard magazine's charts for 11 weeks in 1962, reaching number 25 on the Hot 100, and number 8 on the Easy Listening chart. His single "Love Me as I Love You" charted at number 17 on the Easy Listening chart in September 1962. He made his singing debut on television in 1963, appearing on The Judy Garland Show, singing "Side by Side" with her.

Later, he performed in nightclubs and pursued a secondary career as an impressionist painter. As of 2008, Maharis was still painting, splitting his time between New York City and Beverly Hills, California.

Legal issues
Maharis was arrested in 1967 on charges of lewd conduct, and in 1974 on charges of sex perversion for using men's bathrooms as venues to cruise for sex. However, both charges were later dismissed, and he pled guilty to misdemeanor offenses of disturbing the peace in 1967, and trespassing in 1975.

Death
Maharis died at his Beverly Hills home on May 24, 2023, at the age of 94. Survivors included his brother Robert and a sister.
