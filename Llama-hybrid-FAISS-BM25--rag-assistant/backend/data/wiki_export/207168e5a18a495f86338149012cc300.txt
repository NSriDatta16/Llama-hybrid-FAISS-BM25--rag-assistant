The Aviator: Music from the Motion Picture is the original soundtrack album of the 2004 film The Aviator starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Cate Blanchett and Alan Alda. The original score and songs were composed and conducted by Howard Shore and performed by Brussels Philharmonic (former Flemish Radio Orchestra). It was recorded at Studio 4 of the Flagey Building in Brussels, Belgium.

The album won the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score. It was also nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media.

The soundtrack makes use of orchestral works, such as Johann Sebastian Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565 and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 6 (Pathétique). It also uses Artie Shaw's composition "Nightmare" when Hughes is dealing with Faith, Ava and Katherine throughout the film. This was a piece personally chosen by Scorsese himself.
