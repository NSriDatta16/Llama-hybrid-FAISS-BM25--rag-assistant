History

Early years
The institution was founded in 1911 as the New Utrecht Dispensary. Several small dispensaries merged with Utrecht in 1919 to form the Israel Hospital of Brooklyn. In 1920 Israel Hospital merged with Zion Hospital to form United Israel Zion Hospital, later renamed Israel Zion Hospital. 

Maimonides Medical Center was formed as a result of the merger of United Israel Zion Hospital and Beth Moses Hospital in 1947. The institution was named after Rabbi Moshe Ben Maimon, a 12th-century Jewish philosopher and doctor.

Expansion
The Maimonides Medical Center expanded its emergency department in 1997 with the opening of the Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Emergency Center. In September 2007, construction started on space in a new building at the corner of 48th Street and Fort Hamilton Parkway. There are two wings, the main differences being in the severity of patients seen. In 2015 Maimonides broke ground on 3.4 million square feet of medical office space to allow patients to visit an array of health care providers in the same building.

Affiliation
In February 2013, Maimonides Medical Center, the Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University, and Montefiore Medical Center signed an affiliation agreement that made Maimonides a university hospital and the Brooklyn campus of Albert Einstein College of Medicine. In July 2021, Maimonides Medical Center announced an affiliation with New York Community Hospital, fully expanding a partnership that began with a clinical services agreement in 2018. Maimonides Medical Center will co-operate the smaller, 134-bed hospital.

Innovations

The same laboratory was co-developer of the intra-aortic balloon pump in 1970. Implantation of first partial mechanical heart was performed in the hospital in 1966. The following year, the second human heart transplant in the world (and the first in the US) was performed at Maimonides by Dr. Adrian Kantrowitz. Several other technical feats were achieved by the clinicians in the hospital, such as the first needle aspiration biopsy in the US in 1981, the first robotic surgery for pediatric patients in the US in 2001, and the first angioplasty during a heart attack in 1983.

In 2007, the New York Times reported that in an analysis of about 5,000 hospitals by the Department of Health and Human services, Maimonides was one of the 50 hospitals with the lowest mortality rates. In 2010, Maimonides received the HealthGrades Distinguished Hospital Award for Clinical Excellence, ranking it among the top 5% of hospitals in the entire nation for overall quality outcomes. Maimonides was also listed among the top 5 individual hospitals in New York State for cardiology services, coronary interventional procedures, stroke treatment, and gastrointestinal medical services.
