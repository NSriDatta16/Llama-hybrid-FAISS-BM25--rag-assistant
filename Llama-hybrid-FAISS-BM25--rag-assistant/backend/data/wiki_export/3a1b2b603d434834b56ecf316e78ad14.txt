Professional career
Woods was just the fifth player in Memphis history to be selected in the opening round of the NFL Draft, when he was selected by Kansas City in 1996 with the 28th overall pick.

Woods made a remarkable comeback in 2003 to earn his initial Pro Bowl nod after missing the entire 2002 campaign with a broken right leg.

He also registered a career-best four interceptions that season as the Kansas City defense led the NFL in scoring defense by allowing just 14.5 points per game.

Upon his request, Woods was released by the Chiefs prior to the 2006 season. Woods could not find a new team to sign with for 2006, and on June 7, 2007, it was announced that the Chiefs had signed Woods to a one-day contract, allowing him to officially retire as a member of the Kansas City Chiefs.  Woods moved to the club’s Reserve/Retired list on June 8, 2007.
