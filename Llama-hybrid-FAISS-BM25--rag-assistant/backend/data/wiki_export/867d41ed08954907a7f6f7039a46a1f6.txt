The Krusha massacres (, ) near Rahovec, Kosovo, were two massacres that took place during the Kosovo War on the afternoon of 25 March 1999, the day after the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia began.

At that time, witnesses reported that special police unit entered the village and separated the men and boys, and killed around 100 men and male teenagers over the age of 13. Human Right Watch reported that more than 98 men were killed. Then, the women and children were forced out. In 2020, Darko Tasić, a local Serb from the same village and member of the police reserve forces was convicted as one of the perpetrators of the massacre. It is one of the first cases in which the trial of one of the perpetrators has concluded.

One of witnesses of the murder was British journalist John Sweeney, who was in the place of the murder in that time, saw disposal of dead bodies in the Drini river, and later was an important witness of the trials of Krusha massacres.
