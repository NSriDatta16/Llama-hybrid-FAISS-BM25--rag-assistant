Professional career
Smith's career began with the South East Melbourne Magic and was just starting to find his feet when the club folded. Smith then signed with new franchise Victoria Titans who elected to keep his contract. Smith contributed to the success of the Titans that saw them reach consecutive Grand Finals, in 1999 and 2000, of which they did not win. Victoria soon folded and Smith signed a contract with the Sydney Kings. Although Smith struggled during his first season with Sydney, he excelled during the playoff series, leading Sydney Kings to an NBL championship and Smith was named Grand Final MVP. Outside of the NBL, Smith has had a few short stints in Europe where he played on Croatian team Cibona Zagreb and two Italian teams; Rida Scafati and Scavolini Pesaro. On 18 June 2009, Smith announced his retirement from basketball.
