Geezer is a slang term for a man. 
 In the UK, it is used most often to refer simply to a man, e.g. "some geezer was here earlier", and less often as a complimentary phrase, e.g. "he is a proper geezer".
 In the US, the term typically refers to a cranky old man and can carry the connotation of either age or eccentricity; see fuddy-duddy. It began being used widely in the 1990's.
