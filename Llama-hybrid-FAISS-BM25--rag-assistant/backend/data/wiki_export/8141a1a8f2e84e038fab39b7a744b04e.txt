FK Javor Ivanjica () is a professional football club based in Ivanjica, Serbia. They compete in the Serbian SuperLiga, the top tier of the national league system.

History
In 1912, a student named Milan Radojević brought the first football ball to Ivanjica, which led to the formation of the club. The team mostly played friendly matches before the conclusion of World War II due to a lack of organized football competitions. Between 1958 and 1962, they were close to achieving promotion to the Yugoslav Second League. However, the club never reached higher than the third level until the 1990s.

In 1994, led by manager Slavenko Kuzeljević, the club earned promotion to the Second League of FR Yugoslavia after eliminating Zvezdara and Topličanin in the playoffs. They spent the next eight years in the second tier, having their best season in 1997–98, when they placed fourth in Group West.

In 2002, the club won the Second League (Group West) and took promotion to the First League of FR Yugoslavia for the first time in history. They remained for just one season in the elite division, finishing bottom of the table. During this time, the club became recognizable for featuring a number of young African footballers, mainly from Nigeria and Zimbabwe. They earned another promotion to the top flight in 2005, but again suffered relegation in the same season.

After underperforming in the 2006–07 Serbian First League, the second tier of the restructured national league system, the club managed to convincingly win first place in the 2007–08 season. Moreover, manager Radovan Ćurčić led his team to an unbeaten record and promotion to the Serbian SuperLiga. They subsequently placed fourth in the top flight, their highest league position to date. In 2012, the club celebrated its 100th anniversary.

After a total of six consecutive seasons in the SuperLiga, the club suffered relegation in 2014. However, they won promotion back in the next season. The club subsequently made its greatest success by reaching the final of the 2015–16 Serbian Cup, losing 2–0 to Partizan at the Stadion Metalac.
