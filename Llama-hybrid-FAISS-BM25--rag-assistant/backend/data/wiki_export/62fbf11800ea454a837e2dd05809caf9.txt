Career

1998: Debut with Shinhwa

Kim made his debut in 1998 as a vocalist in the boy band Shinhwa. Although he is not the lead vocalist, he began singing bigger parts on Shinhwa's 7th album, Brand New. In one song from the album "Liar", Kim is the vocalist, and he is accompanied by Eric Mun's rapping. He also wrote, composed, and arranged a song on the album, titled "Set Free". Though he had branched out as a solo artist, he is part of Shinhwa and just released Shinhwa's 9th album.

Kim was one of several Korean celebrities praised by the Japanese media for giving generous donations for flood victims in 2006.

On April 16, 2007, Kim appeared as a guest on MC Mong's "Pleasure and Pain" radio show. When asked about an incident early in his career where he injured his nose, he confessed that he had undergone plastic surgery to change its shape.

2007: Solo debut

Kim released his debut solo album, Kimdongwan Is, on July 5, 2007, which featured collaborations with his fellow Shinhwa members, including Lee Andy rapping in the song "Loving Summer", Shin Hye Sung singing a duet with Kim in "The One Left Alone", and Eric rapping in "My Love". The other members have contributed to the album as well, with Lee Min Woo writing, composing and arranging the song "My Love" and Jun Jin helping him with choreography. Kim expressed gratitude for their contributions, saying, "I’ve been working together with the group Shinhwa, thus there was a lot of pressure working on the solo album, but since the other members showed up and helped me with most of it, it has been a great big help for me". Kim's first single was the ballad, "Handkerchief", a song about a guy who consoles his girlfriend and wipes away her tears. Despite Shinhwa's musical genre being predominantly American R&B and bubblegum pop, Kim said he wanted his album to be more J-pop influenced, having redone a song by GLAY×EXILE in the album.

For the debut album, Kim also lost a lot of weight, saying that "it's not good for a ballad singer to have a muscular image. Someone singing ballads should have a lean, 'hungry-looking' image."
