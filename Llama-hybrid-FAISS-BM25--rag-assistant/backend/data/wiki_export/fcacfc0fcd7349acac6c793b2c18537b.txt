Amir Farshad Ebrahimi () (born August 14, 1975) 
is a former member of Ansar-e Hezbollah.

Ansar-e Hezbollah used violence against students which caused Ebrahimi to decide that, "No, Ansar-e Hezbollah is wrong, you the students are right."

"Confessions"

Ebrahimi was also sentenced and spent two years in prison.

Identifying paramilitaries

As of 2009 he is identifying members of plain-clothed men who beat up Iranian protesters of the disputed election. Ebrahimi "names and shames those he recognizes on the Web", publishing their names and phone numbers and sometimes even their addresses, "so people in their neighborhood know what they are doing." Some are Ansar-e Hezbollah members and former friends.

Works

On March 27, 2008, wire reports stated that he was in danger of extradition from Turkey to Iran, on charges that he "collaborated with peace activists in the flight of Ali Reza Asgari from Iran."
