Colegio Marista de Guaynabo is a private Roman Catholic school in Puerto Rico conducted by the Marist Brothers. It is one of the many Marist schools that take place within 80 countries around the world, being this one the first one to be located in the island of Puerto Rico.

History
In 1963, a group of families interested in having a catholic education for their boys, expressed their interest to the Archbishop of San Juan, Monsignor Jaime Dávila  for the creation of the school.
On September 2, 1963 Hno. David Mediavilla and Hno. Silvio Salicrup, delegates for the Order’s Superiors, arrived to evaluate the possibilities of making these families’ desires a reality.
On November 11, 1963, the news of approval for the foundation of the school arrives. The school had its first settling in the residence of the Architect Jorge Ramírez de Arellano, in Calle J, Garden Hills.
In August 1964, Colegio Marista started its educational history as boys only school, with 188 students for the first six grades. School population grew rapidly, accounting for 400 students in 1968. This growth seeded the construction of its new and actual facilities in Alturas de Torrimar, Guaynabo.

Today, Colegio Marista has excellent facilities that, along with its religious leaders, faculty and staff, provide education for 1500 boy and girl students. Their education is based on a constructivist and humanist curriculum, updated to meet the needs of current times. The Marist Brothers have a long rich tradition of excellent education around the world; locally, each year graduating students are accepted into the most prestigious colleges and universities in Puerto Rico and in the United States.

Most recently, the prestigious school has been awarded with the Iberoamerican Educational Excellence Award. This act, realized in August 2013, also proclaimed the institution as an Honorary Member of the Iberoamerican Council in recognition of the realized pro educational labor throughout the years.
