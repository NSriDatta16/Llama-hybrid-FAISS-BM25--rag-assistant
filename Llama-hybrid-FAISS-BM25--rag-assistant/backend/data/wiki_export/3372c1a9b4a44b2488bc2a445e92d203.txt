Water to the Dead is an album by the gothic rock band Ego Likeness. Released in 2004 on Dancing Ferret Discs, the album takes a more rock approach to their established electronic sound. The name Water to the Dead was, like the band's name, taken from the book Dune by Frank Herbert.

The album also marks the beginning of the band's continuing work with photographer Lauren E. Simonutti.
