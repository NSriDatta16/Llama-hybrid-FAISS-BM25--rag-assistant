History 
Atascadero High School was formerly known as Margarita Black Union High School. Work began on the original high school building designed by Colony Architect John Roth in 1920, but it wasn't until May 1921 that Atascadero Masonic Lodge No. 493 conducted the laying of the cornerstone. The original building featured a clock tower, a pitched tile roof and a large library with a fireplace on one end of the building, The clock tower was able to be viewed in all four directions. In the 1950s, the state of California decided the building was unsafe. The clock tower was taken down, the gable roof replaced with a flat one and the fireplace deemed unusable. This resulted in it becoming a square box building, which currently houses the theater rooms, and the original auditorium/gymnasium was knocked down in 1973. The last original building of the high school was recently taken down after close to 90 years of service due to safety hazards such as asbestos. The empty space is likely to be used for future facilities.
