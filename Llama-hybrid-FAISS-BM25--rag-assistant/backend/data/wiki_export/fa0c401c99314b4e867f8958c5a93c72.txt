Le temps des fleurs (The time of the flowers) is the twenty-first studio album by French singer Dalida. Named after the title song, it was first released in 1968 and became her penultimate album to be released under Barclay Records.

Described by critics as "a poetic masterpiece with very sweet, sweet music", it was also commercially successful with international sales of around 100,000 units, becoming the best selling album released in 1968 by a French artist.

The tracks in the album are based on pop music, each one making a mixture with easy listening, schlager, folk or chanson genres. Most songs are moody ballads, which gives a seriousness to album. While "Les anges noirs" (Black angels) addresses the issue of black children's position in society, there is also a child number "Le petit perroquet" (Little parrot), for which Dalida appeared on animated television series accompanied by bird cage.

Four of twelve songs on album are cover versions. "Quelques larmes de pluie" is cover of Rain and Tears, which Dalida also recorded in German as "Regenzeit-Tränenleid" and in Italian as "Lacrime e pioggia", and released them as B-side to German and Italian singles of "An jenem Tag" and "Quelli erano giorni", respectively.

Dalida's own decision was to cover her friend Patty Pravo's songs "Io per lui" as "Je m'endors dans tes bras", and La bambola, which achieved success peaking at number 6 in Spain and Germany, 20 in France and 48 in Belgium.

In 1978, Barclay reissued it again under catalog number 95 018, but with original cover. In 2002, Barclay Records, then as part of Universal Music France, reissued the album for the last time, in original vinyl format and digitally remastered in CD. Both with original French cover art and track list, it was a part of series of re issues of all Dalida's albums released under Barclay.
