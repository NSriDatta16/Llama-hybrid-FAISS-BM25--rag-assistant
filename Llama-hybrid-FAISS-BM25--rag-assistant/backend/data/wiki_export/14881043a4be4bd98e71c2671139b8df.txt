Roy High School is a 5A secondary school founded in 1965 that serves the residents of Roy, Utah, United States.

History
Prior to the establishment of Hill Air Force Base in 1940, the city of Roy had only one school that housed students of all ages. In 1943, that schoolhouse reached capacity and high school students were bused across Ogden to the north end of Washington Boulevard, a procedure practiced until 1965 when Roy High School was built. It became Weber County's largest high school at the time, and was later rated as one of the ten best in the nation. For the 2016–17 school year, Gina Butters, the former principal was promoted to the Board of Secondary Education, and Kirt Swalberg was named the new principal.

In 2008, Roy High launched a new website for viewing full length boys' basketball games.

In November 2018, the Utah High School Activities Association changed Roy High's sports classification to 6A, the highest in the state.
