The Kindersley Klippers are a junior "A" ice hockey team based in Kindersley, Saskatchewan, Canada.  They are members of the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League (SJHL) and play at the West Central Events Centre.

History
The Kindersley Klippers began as the Saskatoon Titans. The Titans played at Harold Latrace Arena and occasionally held home games at Saskatchewan Place (now known as Credit Union Centre). Due to a lack of attendance at their games in Saskatoon, the ownership decided to move the team to Kindersley, where they became known as the Klippers.

The Klippers won the Membercare Cup as SJHL champions in 2002, but were lost the Anavet Cup to the OCN Blizzard of the Manitoba Junior Hockey League. In 2004, the Klippers again won the Membercare Cup, by beating the Weyburn Red Wings. They later won their first Anavet Cup championship by winning the series in the decisive seventh game against the MJHL's Selkirk Steelers. This win sent the Klippers to the Royal Bank Cup as the western representative. They made it to the Royal Bank Cup final against the OPJHL's Aurora Tigers, where they were defeated 7–1. Their record in the 2004 playoffs was 18 wins and 11 losses.

During the 2008 playoffs, the Klippers looked to win the SJHL championship again. The Klippers first defeated the Weyburn Red Wings in five games, then knocked off the Melville Millionaires in six games. They faced the defending league champion Humboldt Broncos in the SJHL championship. The Klippers took a 3–1 series lead over the Broncos, but lost as Humboldt came back with three straight wins to claim the series and championship. The Humboldt Broncos later won the Anavet Cup and the Royal Bank Cup.

On January 8, 2010, the team's home arena, the West Central Events Centre, suffered extensive damage from a fire that destroyed the adjoining rink, Exhibition Stadium. Significant smoke and water damage, along with the loss of the building's lobby, forced the Klippers to move to nearby Eston for the rest of the season.  The team posted an 8-0-1 record in Eston to close out the regular season and finish third in the Sherwood Conference. Kindersley then swept the Notre Dame Hounds in the league quarterfinal to advance to the Sherwood final against the Yorkton Terriers, a close series that they lost in overtime of game seven.

The Klippers played their first game at the repaired West Central Events Centre on October 2, 2010.
