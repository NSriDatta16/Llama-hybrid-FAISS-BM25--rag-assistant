Anna Carin Helena Cecilia Zidek (née Olofsson, born 1 April 1973) is a Swedish former biathlete who won a silver medal in the 7.5 km sprint and a gold medal in the 12.5 km mass start event at the 2006 Winter Olympics. Originally a cross-country skier, Olofsson competed at the 2002 Winter Olympics, but in the three events she took part in she made the top 30 only once (15 km freestyle), and the following season she switched to biathlon.

On 3 May 2008 Olofsson married her then boyfriend, Tom Zidek - a serviceman in the Canadian biathlon team - in a ceremony near Canmore, Canada. Olofsson officially announced her retirement on 16 July 2011.
