Text from "Florida: The March of Progress" 
For a historical look at Lake County waters, this was written in the 1930s:

amid the slopes and waters of beautiful Lake County, are Leesburg, Eustis, Tavares, and Mount Dora, all possessed of excellent tourist accommodations and such natural and man-made beauty, combined with all sorts of sport advantages, that the sport-loving visitor is thrilled.
Bass fishing surpasses anything you have ever known in that line. Citrus fruits and other products abound. Golf courses are found in every community. As an all-year resort section, this is hard to equal.

Lake Eustis pupfish
The Lake Eustis and the nearby lakes is the sole home of a species of pupfish named the Lake Eustis pupfish (cyprinodon variegatus hubbsi). The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission list the fish as a state species of special concern that is imperiled due to its small geographic distribution in heavily populated central Florida.
