The Cost competitiveness of fuel sources is a measure of whether or not particular fuel sources are  cost competitive in the energy market, and is a primary factor in determining if a fuel source will be utilized. If a fuel source can be produced and sold lower than the price crude oil is being traded at, including taxes, then it is considered to be a cost competitive fuel source.

"Lazardâ€™s levelized cost of energy (LCOE) is the most commonly used metric for comparing cost competitiveness of fuel sources", according to the Lone Star Fuels Alliance.
