The Primera División is the premier professional futsal league in Spain. It was founded in 1989 with the name of División de Honor. Administered by Liga Nacional de Fútbol Sala, it is contested by 16 teams and is played under UEFA rules.

The Liga Nacional de Futsal includes:
Primera División de Futsal — 1st level.
Segunda División — 2nd level.

Liga championship rules
Each team of every division has to play with all the other teams of its division twice, once at home and the other at the opponent's stadium. This means that in Liga Nacional de Futbol Sala the league ends after every team plays 30 matches.

Like many other leagues in continental Europe, the Liga Nacional de Futbol Sala takes a winter break once each team has played half its schedule. One unusual feature of the league is that the two halves of the season are played in the same order—that is, the order of each team's first-half fixtures is repeated in the second half of the season, with the only difference being the stadiums used.

Each victory adds 3 points to the team in the league ranking. Each drawn adds 1 point.
At the end of the league, the winner is:
The team that has most points in the ranking.
If two or more teams are level on points, the winner is the team that has the best results head-to-head.
If there is no winner after applying the second rule, then the team with the best overall goal difference wins.
