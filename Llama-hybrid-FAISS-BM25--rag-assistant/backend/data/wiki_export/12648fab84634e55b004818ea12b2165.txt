As a high school player, he led his team to the Chicago Public League title, and was named Illinois Mr. Basketball.  As a college player at the University of Illinois, he finished his career as the all-time leading scorer in Fighting Illini history.

Professional career

Thomas played two years in Israel for Maccabi Tel Aviv, winning the Israeli championship, the Israeli cup, and the Euroleague championship twice. Thomas didn't play in the 2005 Final Four due to a  broken leg. This injury forced him to leave Maccabi Tel Aviv. He then joined the Greek team Gymnastikos S.

He is one of the most successful American pros of all time in the European leagues.  Thomas has passed on several opportunities to play in the NBA.  On 13 November 2006, in an interview for Bulgarian newspaper Tema Sport and Bulgarian television "Channel 3", Deon Thomas denied any wrongdoing and swore that he didn't receive anything from University of Illinois, as Bruce Pearl had claimed. He said the decision to play for Illinois was made by his grandmother.
