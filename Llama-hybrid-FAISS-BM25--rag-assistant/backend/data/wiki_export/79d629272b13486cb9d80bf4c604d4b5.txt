The Fort Hamilton Parkway station is a local station on the BMT Sea Beach Line of the New York City Subway, located in Borough Park, Brooklyn at the intersection of Fort Hamilton Parkway and 62nd Street. It is served by the N train at all times. During rush hours, several W and northbound Q trains also serve the station.

History
This station opened on June 22, 1915.

From January 18, 2016 to May 22, 2017, the Manhattan-bound platform at this station was closed for renovations. The Coney Island-bound platform was closed for a much longer period of time, from July 31, 2017 to July 1, 2019.

Station layout

This open-cut station has four tracks and two side platforms, but the two center express tracks are not normally used. The northbound platform has metal canopies while the southbound platform has beige concrete walls, columns, and roof (prior to renovation, the columns were blue-green).

At this point, the LIRR Bay Ridge Branch runs alongside north of the line.

Exits
Each end has a crossover. The full-time west exit leads to Fort Hamilton Parkway and 62nd Street while the HEET east exit leads to 11th Avenue and 62nd–63rd Streets. The distance between 11th Avenue and Fort Hamilton Parkway makes the platforms much longer than a typical "B" Division train. The station house's construction is stucco with tile interior.
