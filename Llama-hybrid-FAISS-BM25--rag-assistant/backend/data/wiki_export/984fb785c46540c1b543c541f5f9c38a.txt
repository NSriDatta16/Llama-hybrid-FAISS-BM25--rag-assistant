Name 
Etymologists have not reached a final conclusion, but it is believed that the name originated from the Old Slavic "mьrRs" (Ukrainian: "to fade"), which is derived from the Ukrainian merekhtyty ("to flicker; barely visible"). Another version is a hydronymic from "merecha" (Ukrainian for forest thicket; dense shrubbery in a swampy lowland), which is based on the Proto-Slavic "merRja" (Ukrainian for swampy place). Among the analogies is also merechytysya ("to be seen"), which is related to the root mereka ("delusion, ghost") derived from the Proto-Slavic morkъ (Ukrainian: морок).
