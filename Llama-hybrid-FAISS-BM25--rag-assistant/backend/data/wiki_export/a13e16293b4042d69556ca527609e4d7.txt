History

Boys Technical High School

The school was founded in 1906 as Boys Trade and Technical High School. On July 1, 1907, Tech became part of the Milwaukee public school system. Boys Tech was at one time the largest high school in Wisconsin, with an enrollment of 2900 pupils.

Milwaukee Trade and Technical High School
In 1975, Boys Technical High School changed its name to "Milwaukee Trade and Technical High School", to recognize that girls could now enroll in the school.

Lynde and Harry Bradley Technology and Trade School
In 2002, the school's name was changed to Lynde and Harry Bradley Technology and Trade School following a donation by Jane Pettit, widow of Lloyd Pettit. Renovations to the school, including a new main building directly south of the old building, were completed in 2002 and in 2006, the original Boys Technical High School building was removed. The area was converted to an athletic field.
