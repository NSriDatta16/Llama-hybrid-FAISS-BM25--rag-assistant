Merry, Merry Christmas is the third studio and only Christmas album by pop band New Kids on the Block, released in the United States by Columbia Records on September 19, 1989. It features seasonal songs, both cover versions and original material. Released at a time when the band was peaking, it went double platinum and spawned the top-ten single, "This One's for the Children", which Maurice Starr produced and recorded at Tony Roseâ€™s Hit City Recording Studio in Roxbury, Massachusetts.

The deathcore band I Declare War used the same album cover image for a Christmas themed EP they released titled Bring the Season  (2007).
