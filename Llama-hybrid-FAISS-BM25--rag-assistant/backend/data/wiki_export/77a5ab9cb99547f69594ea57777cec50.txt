Route description

MD 287 begins at an intersection with MD 313 on the northwest edge of the town of Goldsboro.  MD 313 heads south into the town as Oldtown Road and west as Goldsboro Road.  MD 287 heads east as two-lane undivided Old Line Road along the northern edge of Goldsboro.  After intersecting MD 311 (Main Street) and crossing an unused railroad grade owned by the Maryland Department of Transportation, the state highway's name changes to Sandtown Road and it leaves Goldsboro as it heads east through farmland, crossing Broadway Branch and the upper part of the Choptank River.  MD 287 reaches its eastern terminus at the Delaware state line, where the road continues east as DE 10 (Willow Grove Road) toward the town of Camden.
