Personal life
His uncle was Porsche co-founder and race car driver Adolf Rosenberger.

Charmed
Kern was hired as the showrunner when the presentation pilot became a series, and shared the job of executive producer of Charmed with the show's creator Constance M. Burge for the first two seasons, when Burge departed due to disagreements.

Book of Shadows
At the end of the series, Kern and Holly Marie Combs, who played Piper Halliwell throughout the series, took duo-ownership of the "Hero" version of the Book of Shadows; the prop versions were sold at auctions. The "Hero" version is the main, most complete Book of Shadows, and was pivotal to shooting the series. It was usually kept under lock and key.

Kern and Combs were supposed to share custody of the book, agreeing to alternate possession with each getting the book for a year. However, it has been revealed that Kern never honored this agreement, having never transferred possession to Combs.
