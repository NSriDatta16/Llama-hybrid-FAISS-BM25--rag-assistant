The Blencoe Falls is a segmented waterfall on the Blencoe Creek, located in Kirrama, Tablelands Region, in Far North Queensland, Australia.

Location and features

The falls are situated in the Girringun National Park approximately  north of a confluence with the Blencoe Creek and the Herbert River. From an elevation of  above sea level, the falls descend  in an initial drop of approximately  and they cascade for another  to the base of the gorge.

The falls can be reached by unsealed road from Mount Garnet on the Kennedy Highway. The unsealed Kirrama Range Road from Kennedy on the Bruce Highway also provides access from the coast to the falls. Access should only be attempted in dry conditions. Flooding can occur in the wetter months of December to April. Four-wheel-drive vehicles are recommended. Blencoe Falls lookout is approximately  west of Kennedy.

The traditional custodians of the land surrounding the Blencoe Falls are the Indigenous Australian Warrongo people, some of whom were driven over the ridges above Blencoe Falls to drown in the gorge.

The second season of Survivor was filmed in an area close to the falls.
