Personal life

On 18 April 1893, Lord Craven, then twenty-four years old, married sixteen-year-old Cornelia Martin (1877–1961) at Grace Church, New York City. Cornelia, who was the only daughter of Bradley Martin, a wealthy American banker, and his wife, Cornelia Sherman Martin, met Craven while her family was renting a Scottish highland estate, Balmacaan. The marriage brought him property in Mayfair and paid for the renovation of Coombe Abbey, his family estate in Warwickshire which got a new roof, structural repairs, and its first electric lights. Together, they were the parents of:

 William Craven, 5th Earl of Craven (1897–1932), who married Mary Williamina George, daughter of William George OBE, Town Clerk of Invergordon, on 14 October 1916.

In 1921, whilst racing at Cowes Week, and although a strong swimmer, Lord Craven fell overboard from his yacht Sylvia off the Isle of Wight and drowned at age 52. His body was washed ashore on 12 July 1921. He was succeeded in his titles by his son, William, Viscount Uffington upon his death in 1921.

After his death, his widow sold Coombe Abbey to a builder named John Grey in 1923, and died in 1961.
