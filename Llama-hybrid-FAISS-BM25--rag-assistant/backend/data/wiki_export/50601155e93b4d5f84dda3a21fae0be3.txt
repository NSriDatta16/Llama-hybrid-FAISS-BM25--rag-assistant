The station's digital signal is multiplexed:

Analog-to-digital conversion
Because it was granted an original construction permit after the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) finalized the DTV allotment plan on April 21, 1997 , the station did not initially receive a companion channel for a digital television station. WEPX was later assigned channel 51, and the digital signal signed on February 5, 2008. WEPX has filed a letter with the FCC requesting to move from channel 51 to channel 26. This is part of a larger move for the FCC to get TV stations off channel 51 to prevent interference with cell phone devices.
