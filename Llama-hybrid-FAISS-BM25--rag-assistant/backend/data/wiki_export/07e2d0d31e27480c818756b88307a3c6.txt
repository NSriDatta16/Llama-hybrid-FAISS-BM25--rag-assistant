The 700th Anniversary of Chiang Mai Stadium () is a multi-purpose stadium in Chiang Mai, Chiang Mai Province, Thailand, built to host the 1995 Southeast Asian Games and to commemorate the 700th anniversary of Chiang Mai's establishment at the same time. It was also used for the 1998 Asian Games. Football side Chiangmai F.C. returned to the stadium for the 2009 season, having used a municipal stadium elsewhere in the city in recent years.

Navamin Reservoir (อ่างเก็บน้ำนวมินทร์), also known as Mae Jok Luang Reservoir (อ่างเก็บน้ำแม่จอกหลวง), is located directly behind the stadium.

Architecture
Architecturally, the stadium is clearly a forebear of the 80th Birthday Stadium in Nakhon Ratchasima. A continuous single tier, almost a perfect circle, rises up on one side to form a large main stand which provides covered accommodation for 4,500 spectators. Only the main stand is covered the rest of the all seater stadium is uncovered.
