Li Feng (died 254), courtesy name Anguo, was a Chinese politician of the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period of China. He was a trusted official of the third Wei emperor Cao Fang, and did not follow the regent Sima Shi's wishes.

In 254, in company with Xiahou Xuan and Zhang Ji (張緝), he plotted to kill Sima Shi. However, Sima Shi sensed their scheme and summoned Li Feng to meet him in the palace, where he interrogated Li Feng and killed him. He was then accused of treason and his family members were executed as well.
