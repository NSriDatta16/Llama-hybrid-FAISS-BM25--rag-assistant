The University of Murcia () is the primary institute of higher education in Murcia, Spain. With a student population of approximately 38,000, it is the largest university in the Región de Murcia. Founded in 1272 AD, the University of Murcia is the third oldest university in Spain, following only the University of Salamanca (1218 AD) and the University of Valladolid (1241 AD), and the thirteenth in the world. The University of Murcia was established by the King Alfonso X of Castile under the Crown of Castile.

The majority of the University's facilities and buildings are spread over two campuses: the older is La Merced, situated in the town centre, and the larger is Espinardo, 5km to the north of Murcia. A third campus for Medical and Health Studies is currently being built next to the suburban area known as Ciudad Sanitaria Virgen de la Arrixaca, 5km south of the city. A new campus had been made in San Javier too, that hosts the Sports Science faculty.

History

The first university in Murcia was founded as the Universitas Studiorum Murciana by Alfonso X of Castile around 1272. The current modern University of Murcia was founded in 1915, making it the tenth oldest university in Spain among the modern universities, but its seal carries the date of the thirteenth century founding.

Campuses
The University of Murcia has two campuses: La Merced, the original campus in the center of the city; and the larger Espinardo, 5 km to the north, which houses most students.

A third campus for medical and health studies is currently being built in the Murcia neighborhood of El Palmar, next to the hospital Ciudad Sanitaria Virgen de la Arrixaca, 5 km south of Murcia's city center. A fourth campus is in the beginning stages in San Javier. Another one, in Lorca, is expected to open in 2007.
