The 97 B-Line was an express bus line in Metro Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It connected Coquitlam Central station on the West Coast Express system to Lougheed Town Centre station on the SkyTrain system. It was operated by Coast Mountain Bus Company and funded by TransLink. Going west, the route went along Clarke Rd., St. John's St., Ioco Rd, Guildford Way and Pinetree Way, and served Burnaby, Port Moody, and Coquitlam. The 97 B-Line was discontinued on December 18, 2016, as part of the December 2016 TransLink seasonal bus service changes, many resulting from the opening of the Evergreen Extension of the Millennium Line. The line carried 10,750 passengers on weekdays in 2011.

Unlike the other B-Line services, this route mainly used conventional  buses with no special paint scheme, instead of the  articulated buses. It took 45 minutes to complete during rush hour, and about 30 minutes off-peak.
