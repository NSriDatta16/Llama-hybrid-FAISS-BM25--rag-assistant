History 
Blue Veins was founded by Qamar Naseem in 1999 first in order to spread information about breast cancer in communities such as Khyber Pakthtunkhwa (KPK) and Federally Administrated Tribal Areas (FATA). In 2013, Blue Veins partnered with KIOS, a Finnish NGO, to document sexual harassment "hotspots" in Pakistan. This project eventually led to 46 women being able to file cases, with Blue Veins' help. Also in 2013, Blue Veins launched a "Women's Manifesto", urging women to exercise their right to vote.

Blue Veins helped establish TransAction in KPK. In 2017, Blue Veins, along with TransAction Alliance have demanded legal protections for transgender people in KPK. KPK became the first province in South Asia to have legal protections for transgender people.
