Codsall railway station  serves the village of Codsall in Staffordshire, England.

History

The original listed GWR footbridge, between the two platforms and which dated from 1883, was accidentally destroyed by contractors using a road-rail crane in June 2005. Five of the original cast iron columns have been damaged beyond repair. The replacement replica columns were cast at Barr and Grosvenor's foundry in Wolverhampton during 2007. Approximately 70% of the original wrought iron span was found to be salvageable for reuse in the replacement which has been rebuilt a little higher than the original to comply with current regulations.

The GWR signal box stood slightly to the east of Codsall station.  It was taken out of use and control of the area passed to Madeley Junction as a result of the 2006 resignalling scheme. The lever and locking frame from the signal box were recovered by Network Rail for re-use in the south-west of England. The remaining re-usable parts of the signal box have been relocated to the Dean Forest Railway.

The station house on the westbound platform has undergone a renovation in recent years and is now home to a CAMRA award-winning public house known as The Station. This opened in 1999 as a Holdens Brewery house.
