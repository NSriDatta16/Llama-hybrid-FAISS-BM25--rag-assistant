Release
Baby Monkey was released on January 27, 2004, by record labels V2 and Mute. According to the album's liner notes, Moby released the album under his pseudonym so he could concentrate on the music without having to worry about promotion or record sales.

Two singles were released: "Light Is in Your Eyes" in November 2003 and "Take It Home" in December.

Reception 

Baby Monkey has received mixed reviews from critics. Mojo wrote: "Baby Monkey has a strangely nostalgic feel – as if he's reanimated his old raver's soul, with its favourite beats and bass lines intact." Uncut called it "An interesting addition to the artist's varied oeuvre." Blender wrote: "As self-indulgent side projects go, this could be a whole lot worse."

On the other hand, AllMusic wrote that it "Often sounds virtually identical to a generic dance record circa 1992." Q wrote: "Baby Monkey has nothing of the danger, adventure or indeed chemical frisson that defined rave culture—it's just smug sonic wallpaper." Spin noted: "These tracks lack the energy to power a glow stick." Jonathan Zwickel of Pitchfork wrote: "There's no life breathing through these 12 flaccid tracks, each of which would've seemed regressive even in Moby's early-90s heyday—today, each is a total anachronism."
