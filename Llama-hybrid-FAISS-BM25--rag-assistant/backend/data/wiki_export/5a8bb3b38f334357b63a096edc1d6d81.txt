The London and Home Counties Traffic Advisory Committee was set up to make recommendations on regulating and controlling motor traffic in the LTA, and presented annual reports to Parliament. The committee's included members appointed by the Ministry of Transport and by the local authorities in the traffic area.

The LTA and the advisory committee were abolished by the London Government Act 1963. From 1965 the Greater London Council exercised the powers over traffic regulation, although its area was much smaller than the traffic area.
