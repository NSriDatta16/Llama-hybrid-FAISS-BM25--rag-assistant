Following assignments as commander of the 86th Fighter-Bomber Group and the 355th Fighter Group, Simler was assigned to the United States Air Force Academy as director of athletics. Later in his life, he would lead the campaign to establish the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy, the annual football competition between the three U.S. service academies.

Simler was next assigned overseas to Kadena Air Base, Okinawa, Japan, and became commander of the 18th Tactical Fighter Wing, which was the first Pacific Air Forces organization to convert to the F-105 Thunderchief.  In June 1965 following an assignment as commander of the Tactical Fighter Weapons Center, Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, he went to Southeast Asia. During this assignment he was director of operations of the Seventh Air Force and flew combat missions in every tactical strike aircraft assigned to the Seventh Air Force.
