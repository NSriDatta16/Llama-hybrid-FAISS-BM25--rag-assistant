Dave Cliff (born 25 June 1944) is a British jazz guitarist.

Career
Cliff was born in Hexham, Northumberland. In 1967, he moved to Leeds and gained a diploma in jazz studies from Leeds College of Music while studying with bassist Peter Ind and Bernie Cash. Ind became a mentor to him. At Leeds Cliff was influenced by listening to the music of Lennie Tristano. In 1971, after moving to London, Cliff became established on the local scene. During 1976–1977 he toured the UK with Lee Konitz and Warne Marsh, both students of Tristano and familiar to Ind. During the next  year Cliff toured the UK with Soprano Summit (Kenny Davern and Bob Wilber). Beginning in the 1980s, he worked increasingly as a freelance musician.

He recorded his first solo album, The Right Time, in 1987 with Geoff Simkins on alto saxophone. With Simkins he also recorded West Coast Blues (1991) (cassette only), Sippin' at Bell's  (1994) and The Music of Tadd Dameron (1996).

Cliff has appeared frequently at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in varied settings. He has worked with Harry Allen, Mike Carr, Buddy Childers, Richie Cole, Eddie "Lockjaw" Davis, Phil DeGreg, Georgie Fame, Allan Ganley, Herb Geller, Scott Hamilton,  Ken Peplowski, Bucky Pizzarelli, Irene Reid, Spike Robinson, Nina Simone, Lew Tabackin, and Warren Vaché.

In 1998 Cliff won the BT Jazz Awards in the guitar category.

Around 2015 Cliff retired from professional playing on the grounds of Parkinson's disease.

Influences
Cliff's influences on guitar include Charlie Christian, Wes Montgomery, and Lennie Tristano, whose influence he encountered when working and studying with Peter Ind.

Teaching
Cliff has taught at Royal Birmingham Conservatoire, Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama in Cardiff, Trinity College of Music in London, Original UK Jazz Summer School, Jamey Aebersold Summer School in London, and Kristiansand in Norway.
