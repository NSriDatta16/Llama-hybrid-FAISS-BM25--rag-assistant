Berlin Raceway is a 7/16-mile-long paved oval race track in Marne, Michigan, near Grand Rapids. The track races weekly as part of the NASCAR Advance Auto Parts Weekly Series. It has also held touring series events on the ARCA Menards Series, ARCA Menards Series East, American Speed Association National Tour, USAC Stock Cars, USAC Silver Crown, World of Outlaws Sprint cars, and World of Outlaws Late Model Series tours.

The track opened in 1950. It was originally a horse track before World War II. Berlin's current track record is 12.513 seconds, set by Brian Gerster in 2018 in a winged sprint car. Berlin Raceway takes its name from the city of Marne's original name "Berlin," which was changed due to Anti-German sentiment following World War I.

History
The track was developed by the Chester Mysliwiec family in 1950. It was purchased by the West Michigan Whitecaps in 2001. The group made numerous improvements to the facilities such as new bathrooms, updated catch fences, and a new sound system. Dirt was temporarily placed over the pavement after the 2017 regular season and three touring series visited the track in September / October - American Ethanol Late Model Tour, American Ethanol Modified Tour and Engine Pro Sprints On Dirt. Some racing scenes for the movie God Bless the Broken Road were recorded at the track in early 2016 for the 2018 film. The track dropped its Super Stock and Modified classes in 2020 and added a class of Limited Late Models. Other classes include Super Late Models, Sportsman, 4 Cylinder, and Mini-Wedges. Berlin Raceway won the 2021 Advance Auto Parts 'Advance My Track Challenge' $50,000 award beating out Hudson Speedway in New Hampshire and Alaska Raceway Park.

Some drivers that have come from the track are Jack Sprague, Tim Steele, 1967 track champion Bob Senneker, and 2017 Super Late Model track champion Carson Hocevar. 1989 track Outlaw Late Model champion Johnny Benson Jr. described the track as "one of the most difficult tracks in the country." The track has a 13-degree banking in turns and 9-degree banking on the straightaways. The track is notable for the lack of an outside wall on the back straightaway, a rare feature for a track featuring national series races. In addition, the short straights make it feel almost circular.
