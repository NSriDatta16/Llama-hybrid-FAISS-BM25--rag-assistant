Mercury(II) nitrate is an inorganic compound with the formula Hg(NO3)2.xH2O. These colorless or white soluble crystalline salts are occasionally used as a reagent. It is made by treating mercury with hot concentrated nitric acid. Neither anhydrous nor monohydrate has been confirmed by X-ray crystallography. The anhydrous material is more widely used.

Uses
Mercuric nitrate has been used in mercuration of ketones. Mercuric nitrate was formerly used in carroting felt for hats.

Health information
Mercury compounds are highly toxic.  The use of this compound by hatters and the subsequent mercury poisoning of said hatters is a common theory of where the phrase "mad as a hatter" came from.
