His best-known live-action credits include Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978), The Wanderers, The Incredible Shrinking Woman, Blade Runner, 2010, The Witches of Eastwick, Broadcast News, Lethal Weapon 2, The War of the Roses, Thelma & Louise, Bram Stoker's Dracula, Made in America, Free Willy, The Horse Whisperer, and What Dreams May Come.

From 1992 until his death from the effects of muscular dystrophy, he was married to author and film scholar Katherine Orrison.
