"Real Things" is the debut single of English singer-songwriter Javine. The single, which features a sample of M.O.P.'s "Ante Up" and a lyrical interoperation of "It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)" by Duke Ellington and Irving Mills, reached the top five on the UK Singles Chart and is the biggest hit of her career to date. The song has also featured on the SingStar games, being the 19th single featured on SingStar Party.

Background and meaning
After auditioning on the television show Popstars: The Rivals for a spot in girl group Girls Aloud, Javine missed out on a spot (finishing sixth, with five members only wanted) despite her popularity with the public and being 'too good for the band', as said by the judges. The voting claimed to be rigged by the public, as she was the show's favourite artist. Days after the show ended and the episode had aired, several record labels knocked on her door for a contract. She eventually signed to Innocent Records, home of fellow girl group Atomic Kitten.

Javine did show disappointment in the fact she did not make the cut, however said "the decision was a blessing and a curse." When asked why, she explained she could move into a more R&B-oriented career instead of the pop career the show was looking for. "Real Things" became the first piece of material to do so, and was commercially successful followed up by other tracks on her album Surrender.

"Real Things" was written by Tor Hermansen, Hallgeir Rustan, Mikkel Eriksen, Jamal Gerard Grinnage, Eric Murry, Darryl Pittman and Javine herself. Production was handled by StarGate. The song is about materialism, with the main message being someone could have everything he or she wants or needs; however, if they are out of love or are not willing to give all their love, there is no sign of interest.

Release and reception
"Real Things" was released in the United Kingdom on 7 July 2003, charting at number four on the UK Singles Chart at the end of the first sales week. It became the 96th-best-selling single of the year. After becoming commercially successful in the United Kingdom, the song became heavily noticed. It eventually became the opening act for R. Kelly's concert in the UK, and also served as the 19th track on the famous SingStar platform's Party version. The cover art, however, is the album artwork, and not the official single artwork.

Music video
The music video for "Real Things" was filmed in early 2003, but never had a commercial release. In November 2004, it appeared on the PS2 karaoke game "SingStar Party". Eight years after it was filmed, it was finally uploaded onto YouTube in late 2011. The video begins with brief shots of Javine leaving her house. She then walks down the street as people begin to notice her and point out. Several men also glance and are interested in her, however Javine does not show the same feelings back. Instead she hangs out with her friends and in the last chorus meets up with the one, covering his eyes as he closes his shop. They walk away, holding hands. During the video, she is seen dancing in a black catsuit, dancing (with two back-ups) behind a wall which has been spray-painted 'Javine'. A then unknown Kanye West makes an appearance as a man driving a yellow sports car whom Javine rejects.
