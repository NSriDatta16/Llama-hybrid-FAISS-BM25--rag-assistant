Margaret Packham Hargrave was born as Margaret Ruth Packham on 8 November 1941 and grew up in the Sydney suburb of Auburn, Beverly Hills, and Jannali. For secondary education she attended Sutherland High School and Moor-field Girls High School, Kogarah. Her tertiary studies were at New South Wales State Conservatorium of Music, where she studied voice with Raymond Beatty and viola with Georgiana Maclean, and concurrently at Sydney Hospital, where she studied nursing from January 1960 to December 1963. Subsequently, she completed a Bachelor of Arts majoring in English and Psychology, and Master of Letters in Middle English/Chaucer at the University of New England and a Diploma of Education at Mitchell College. She had an early career as a nurse from March 1964 to June 1967, including as a lecturer in Nursing Studies, publishing a research paper, "Literature in the Nursing Course", in The Australian Journal of Advanced Nursing (1985).
