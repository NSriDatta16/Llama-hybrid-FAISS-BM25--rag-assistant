Shottas is a 2002 Jamaican crime film about two young men who participate in organized crime in Kingston and Miami. It stars Ky-Mani Marley, Spragga Benz, Paul Campbell and Louie Rankin and was written and directed by Cess Silvera. Despite its low budget, the distribution of an unfinished bootleg made it a cult favourite long before its official limited release in the United States by Triumph Films and Destination Films in 2006.

Plot
Biggs (Errol) (Ky-Mani Marley) and Wayne (Spragga Benz), are two young men who grow up together in the tough and dangerous streets of Kingston. They rob a soda truck and shoot the truck driver while they are still children.

The robbery money is used to purchase visas to go the United States, where they continue their criminal activities, hustling on the streets of Miami. Twenty years later, Biggs is deported to Jamaica where Wayne and Mad Max (Paul Campbell), also deported, have continued their surge in crime by extorting money from businessmen. After facing problems with the police and politicians, the two head back to Miami alongside Mad Max. Upon returning, they are informed that Miami has a new drug kingpin, Teddy Bruck Shut (Louie Rankin).

The three pay Teddy a visit to extort him. They extort, beat, and murder their way to the top of the Miami underworld. Their dream ends in a brazen shoot out, during which Teddy's thugs kill Wayne and shoot Max. Biggs is nearly killed as he comforts Wayne at his deathbed, but Max shoots the assailant before it happens.

After taking Max to the hospital, Biggs goes to Teddy's house and murders him, his bodyguard and his girlfriend. Biggs then takes all the money and gets on a boat, presumably to Los Angeles, as he mentioned purchasing a house there prior to the massive firefight.
