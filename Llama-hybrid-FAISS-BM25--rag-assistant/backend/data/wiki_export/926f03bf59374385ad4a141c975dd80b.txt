In January 1952 Rosenstock succeeded Laszlo Halász as General Director of the NYCO. He served in that post for four seasons, continuing Halász's innovative programming of unusual repertoire mixed with standard works. He led the world premiere of Aaron Copland's The Tender Land, the New York premiere of William Walton's Troilus and Cressida, and the United States premieres of Gottfried von Einem's The Trial and Béla Bartók's Bluebeard's Castle. Rosenstock was also the first NYCO director to include musical theater in the company's repertoire with a 1954 production of Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II's Show Boat.

Rosenstock returned to the Met on  to conduct Tristan und Isolde and became a regular member of the Met conducting staff until his last performance conducting Die Meistersinger on .
