Major expansions
The site began as a Sears store; however, in 1974, it was expanded to include Champlain Place Shopping Centre, including where Walmart is now (then Woolco) and to the west (then Dominion and Consumers Distributing).

Other
Until September 2008, customers of Champlain Place were allowed to bring their shopping carts with them anywhere within the common areas of the mall. Carts have since been banned from use in the common areas, and restricted to grocery and large department stores.
Champlain Place is named after Samuel de Champlain, a French explorer of the region.
