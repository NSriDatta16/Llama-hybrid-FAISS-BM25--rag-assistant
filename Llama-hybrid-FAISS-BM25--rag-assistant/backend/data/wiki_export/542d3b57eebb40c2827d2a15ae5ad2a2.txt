Basil the Great Mouse Detective is a platform, action-adventure game designed by BobÂ Armour and published by Gremlin Graphics in 1987 for the Amstrad CPC, Atari 8-bit and Commodore 64 home computers. The game is based on the 1986 Disney animated film The Great Mouse Detective.

Plot
The protagonist of the game is a mouse named Basil who resides in the basement of the fabled 221b Baker Street home of Sherlock Holmes. The evil Professor Ratigan has abducted Basil's friend Dr. Dawson, and he now has to scour London for hints that will help him find the villain's hideout.

Gameplay

The player controls Basil by walking around the chambers, passing from one to another through the edges of the screen (if possible) or squeezing through letter slots and other holes in the walls. In the locations, in addition to numerous enemies, there are various objects. Most of them are just decorations, but in each level there are at least two types of containers in which Basil can find items. So when the player spots a container, bin, jar or something similar they should search it. Once the player has collected all the evidence in a level, they need to find the passage to the next stage, which was previously masked. The above steps must be repeated until the game is completed, and there are a total of 3 levels: London's shops and docks, the sewers and finally the hideout of the evil Ratigan.
