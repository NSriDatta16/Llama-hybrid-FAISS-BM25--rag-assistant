The Brandywine Wildflower and Native Plant Gardens are gardens at the Brandywine River Museum, located on U.S. Route 1 beside the Brandywine Creek in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania.

The gardens were established in 1974 to a design by F. M. Mooberry. In 1979 Lady Bird Johnson dedicated the gardens to Ford B. Draper and Henry A. Thouron for their contributions to the Brandywine Conservancy.

The gardens include wildflowers, trees, and shrubs set within landscaped woodlands, wetland, flood plain, and meadow.
