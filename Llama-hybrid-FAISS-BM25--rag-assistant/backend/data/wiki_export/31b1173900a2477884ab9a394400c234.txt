History 
Maji was founded around 1897 when Ras Welde Giyorgis stationed a garrison outpost of Ethiopian soldiers near the lands of the ture, a personage Garretson describes as "the most powerful and respected religious figure in the area." Garretson explains how an administrative center for the region soon followed: "Built on a commanding hill were a fortified encampment of gibbi (the personal headquarters of the governor), a church and a market. All were carefully observed and guarded by the governor and his retinue of soldiers." Richard Pankhurst records that its governor, Dejazmach Taye, amazed by the growing trade at Gambela to the west of him, during the 1920s attempted to develop exports of coffee, rubber, hides and ivory through the port town.

Prior to the Italian occupation, the British had a consulate in Maji. The town was occupied by the Italians 18 March 1937, and liberated from them by May 1941. During this period, the occupiers built roads so that vehicles could be driven to Maji and a Catholic Mission operated there which ran at least one school. An American Mission was established in 1948 near Maji, and provided education and medical care until it was closed in 1977.

When the Maji Zone was created in the mid-1990s, Maji became its administrative center.
