History
As North Carolina renumbered its state highways in 1934, NC 4 was commissioned as a short state highway, running only a few miles from US 158 to the community of Airlie, just south of Littleton. When NC 48 running from Airlie to Littleton is rerouted to the east in 1951, NC 4 was left to take its place. In 1984 NC 4 was extended southward, taking over parts of NC 561, NC 48, and the decommissioned I-95 Business to US 301. I-95 Business was intended to take traffic from US 301 to I-95, and NC 4 took over that role.
