Description
The poem "Abani Bari Acho" is a monsoon night's verse, where the poet assumes the role of Abani . However, while penning this verse, Shakti recounted that when the poet gazed upon the Meghdoot garland and a bottle of mahua in an abandoned house, he felt as though innumerable cows had traversed by. The clouds appeared like cow-herds, and Abani lay at the doorstep, as if beckoned by a visitor. Someone was calling for Abani to come closer. Yet, Abani hesitated to depart. Abani responded, "You summoned me, and I can indeed leave. But why should I go? I have a little child to whom I wish to plant a kiss on his cherubic face. The affection of this family seeks to tether the poet to Ashtepristha."

Soon, the poet may have once more comprehended that he cannot linger if he so desires. He must depart. No thread of compassion can detain the endearing countenance of the child. Contemplating all this, the poet affirmed, "I shall depart, but not immediately."
