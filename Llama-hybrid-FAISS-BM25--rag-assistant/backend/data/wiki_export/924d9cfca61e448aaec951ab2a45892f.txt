Bryn Celynnog Comprehensive School is an 11â€“18 mixed, English-medium, community secondary school and sixth form in Beddau, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Wales.

History 

Built as the Beddau Girls School and dated 1928. One of a series of schools with similarities in style by the Glamorgan County Architect, D Pugh Jones. This example is relatively small for a secondary school, perhaps because it was for girls only. Shown on an Ordnance Survey map of 1948 with the same E-shaped plan as today. A dotted line is shown across the rear, perhaps representing a fence which would have bounded a courtyard. It is possible that a rear range was planned but not built.
