He decides to employ unconventional methods to fulfill his mission and engages Siva to assist him, renaming him Paramasivan, changing his look (cutting his Jaṭā hair), and giving him a single-point agenda – trace out and erase the people responsible for the Coimbatore blasts. Unaware to Paramasivan, Nandakumar intends on killing him after the mission is completed.

The fly in the ointment is played by CBI officer Nair, who is out to trace Paramasivan and stop his unlawful activities. His assistant SI Agniputran, provides lighter moments. How Paramasivan finishes the villains and his job forms the rest of the story. Paramasivan learns of Nandakumar's idea to kill him after the mission during the last few scenes where Nair intervenes.

Production
After the success of Chandramukhi (2005), director P. Vasu announced his intentions of directing Rajinikanth again but the announcement of Rajinikanth's collaboration with Shankar in Sivaji hindered his hopes. In August 2005, he roped in Ajith Kumar to play the protagonist in his next film. The project was initially taken up by director Bala's production house, B Studios, and was titled Idi (Thunder), with Laila selected to play the leading female role. The film was launched on 10 September 2005 by Rajinikanth, while the title was changed to Paramasivan.

Following Ajith Kumar's exit from Bala's directorial venture, Naan Kadavul, this film changed producers the next month with S. Ramesh Babu agreeing to finance the film. Nisha Kothari was first requested to appear in an item number in the film but the role was later taken by Ragasya. For the film, Ajith lost 15 kg to get into shape. K. Balachandar's Kavithalaya Productions took up the distribution of Paramasivan for the Chengalpet area.
