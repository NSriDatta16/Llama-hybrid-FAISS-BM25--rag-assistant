}}Wild One: The Very Best of Thin Lizzy''  is a 1996 compilation album by Irish rock band Thin Lizzy. It was released ten years after the death of frontman Phil Lynott in 1986 as a tribute to him.

Although the album shares its title with the Thin Lizzy song of the same name, and also quotes the chorus of the song on the back of the album, the song itself is not actually included. A limited two-CD edition of the album was also released, containing rare live tracks from various limited edition releases throughout the band's career on the second disc.
