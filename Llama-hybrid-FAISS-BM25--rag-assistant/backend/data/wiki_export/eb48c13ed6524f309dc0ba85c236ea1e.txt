In August 1944, HMS Empire Battleaxe was sent to the Pacific as part of Force X. She sailed in a convoy of seven ships comprising , , HMS Empire Battleaxe, , , and . The convoy sailed from Greenock on 3 August via New York and the Panama Canal, arriving at Suva, Fiji, where the convoy dispersed, in late September.

In 1945 she was renamed HMS Donovan, under which name she served out the remainder of the war.  After the war ended she was returned to the Ministry of Transport in 1946, her name reverting to Empire Battleaxe. During this time, Empire Battleaxe was employed on trooping duties in the Mediterranean. In July 1946, the crew were told that on arrival at Naples, Italy from Alexandria, Egypt, the ship would sail for Liverpool, United Kingdom. However, on arrival at Naples, orders were received to make another return trip to Alexandria. About three-quarters of her crew refused to sail. The British Consul in Naples visited the ship to warn the strikers of the consequences of their actions. After he had departed, new orders were issued to sail to Liverpool. The explanation given was that the original orders had been issued because it was thought that ships being sent to relieve Empire Battleaxe would not reach Naples in time. Once it was realised that the relief would arrive in time, the order was cancelled.

She was returned to the United States Maritime Commission in 1947 and renamed Cape Berkeley in 1948. It was then proposed to sell her to China, where she was to be named Hai C.  The sale was subsequently cancelled. She was renamed Empire Battleaxe in 1950 and laid up in the James River, Virginia. Empire Battleaxe was scrapped at Kearny, New Jersey in May 1966.
