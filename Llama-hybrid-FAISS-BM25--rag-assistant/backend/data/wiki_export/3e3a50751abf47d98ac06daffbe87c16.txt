In France, the Concours Général is the most prestigious academic competition held every year between students of Première (11th grade) and Terminale (12th and final grade) in almost all subjects taught in both general, technological and professional high schools. Exams usually take place in March, and their results are known in June or July. Students who show great ability in one field are selected to participate by their teachers and their school principal. Most of the time, no more than one student per high school is allowed to participate in the competition, which requires strong knowledge of college level topics (Some "elite" high schools sometimes depart from this rule, presenting dozens of students, such as the Lycée Louis-Le-Grand, the Lycée Saint-Louis de Gonzague or the Lycée Henri IV in Paris). In the humanities and social sciences, the exams involve one or more essays and last 6 hours. In the sciences, the exams last almost as long and are problem-based.

In a given subject, up to 18 awards can be given:
 up to 3 Prizes. A student winning a prize takes part in a ceremony held in the main amphitheatre of the Sorbonne University, where they are given the diploma and congratulated by the Minister of Education and members of the government.
 up to 5 Accessits
 up to 10 Regional awards

A student who wins any of the above is called a "lauréat du Concours Général". In Mathematics, the "Lauréat" is invited to a series of conferences at the Institute Poincaré and is usually selected to attend the Clay Institute summer school of science.

In light of the Réforme des lycées, which went into effect with the class of 2021, students now participate in the Concours associated with one or both of their two specialized subjects. Philosophy is open to all, but is no longer separated into two exams for scientific and economic students, and literary students.

 Philosophy
 Mathematics 
 Physics and Chemistry 
 Biology and Geology 
 Engineering 
 Economics 
Language exams:
 Arabic
 Chinese (from 2007)
 English
 German
 Hebrew
 Italian
 Portuguese
 Spanish
 Russian

Students of technological and professional high schools usually attempt their main subject.
