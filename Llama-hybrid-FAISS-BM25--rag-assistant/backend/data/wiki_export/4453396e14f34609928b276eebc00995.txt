On 1 July 2005, the municipality of Bergwitz with its subdivision of Klitzschena, was amalgamated with Kemberg, as was the municipality of Ateritz (with its subdivisions of Gommlo and Lubast) on 1 January 2006 and Dorna on 1 January 2007. In 2009 The former municipality of Globig-Bleddin was also amalgamated into Kemberg. On 1 January 2010 the former municipalities Dabrun, Eutzsch, Rackith, Radis, Rotta, Schleesen, Selbitz, Uthausen and Wartenburg were merged into Kemberg.

Main sights 
The town's most striking sight is the soaring Church of Our Lady ("Unser Lieben Frauen") which can be seen far away over the Elbaue (natural polder). It is a hall church with a nave and two aisles dating from the 15th century (or so it is believed) with an 86-m-tall tower built in the 19th century. There are things there such as remnants of wall paintings from the late Middle Ages, a sacrament house made of sandstone and a carved altar (both from the 15th century) and a very nice baptismal font. Also worth seeing are the late Gothic town hall with its Renaissance additions and the old town wall from the 14th century, parts of which are still well preserved.

Kemberg's well preserved town centre takes the visitor to bygone days and is always worth seeing on foot. The town is also well placed for outings to the nearby heath, and to Wittenberg.
