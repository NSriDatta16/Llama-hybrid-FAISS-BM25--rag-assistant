The Grand Harbour of Malta tornado was one of the deadliest tornadoes on record worldwide, killing at least 600 people. It began as a waterspout, hitting the Grand Harbour of Malta where it killed hundreds of people who drowned when their ships capsized. At least four of the Order's galleys, named Santa Fè, San Michele, San Filippo and San Claudio, capsized in the tornado. The date of the tornado is unknown, as sources conflict on it being September 23, 1551 or September 23, 1556. TORRO indicates a rating of T7 on the TORRO scale, equivalent to F3 on the Fujita scale.
