Fremont High School is a co-educational, public high school in Sunnyvale, California, United States.  Fremont is currently the only open public high school located in the city of Sunnyvale and is part of the Fremont Union High School District (FUHSD).

History
Fremont High School was originally named West Side Union High School, the first school opened in the West Side Union High School District. In 1923, it opened in rooms of the Sunnyvale Grammar School as the only high school in the Sunnyvale–Cupertino (West Valley) area, and then moved to a temporary building after purchase of the school site in 1923. The school building was designed in 1925 by noted California school architect W. H. Weeks, after the necessary bond referendum passed on the third attempt. On March 27, 1925, the board of trustees unanimously voted to change the name of the school and district to Fremont Union High School.

In 1942, during the Second World War, Fremont became a temporary recruitment training ground and around half of the class of 1942 joined the military.

In 1969, a late-night fire occurred in the bell tower of the main building; the 1970 freshman class went to Monta Vista High School in Cupertino while rebuilding was done.

On July 1, 1996, after much controversy, the Fremont Union School Board did away with the original Indian mascot, replacing it with the current Firebirds mascot.

Campus
Fremont High School is located at the intersection of Fremont Avenue and Sunnyvale–Saratoga Road. The Fremont Union High School District's offices are also located on the school campus.

The original buildings are built in a Spanish mission architectural style. Three classroom buildings that were added in the 1950s on the Fremont Avenue side were demolished and replaced with new instructional and administrative space also in mission style, creating a quadrangle.
