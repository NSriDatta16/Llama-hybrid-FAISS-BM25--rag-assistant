Personal life
She was born Pam Turek on August 11, 1948, in Chicago, Illinois and graduated from Duchesne Academy in 1966. She attended the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and graduated from the University of Nebraska at Omaha in education in 1969. She married Jerry Redfield and had six children.

State legislature
Redfield won election to the Nebraska Legislature to represent the 12th legislative district in November of 1998. However, she was then appointed to the Legislature by Governor Ben Nelson on November 30, 1998, after her predecessor Chris Abboud resigned early. She was then reelected in 2002. She served as the vice chairperson of the Banking, Commerce and Insurance committee and sat on the Revenue committee. Since Nebraska voters passed Initiative Measure 415 in 2001 limiting state senators to two consecutive terms after 2001, she was unable to run for reelection in 2006.
