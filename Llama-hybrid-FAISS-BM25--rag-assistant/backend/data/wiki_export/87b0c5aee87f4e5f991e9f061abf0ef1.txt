Sutanuti was one of the three villages which were merged to form the city of Kolkata (formerly known as Calcutta) in India. The other two villages were Gobindapur and Kalikata. Sutanuti was set up along the banks of the Hooghly river which is a tributary of the Ganges river. The British had bribed mughal officials into granting rights of three cities, Gobindapur, Sutanuti and Kalikata to the British East India Company in the year 1651. The British built a factory and ware house there where goods for export were stored and many offices were built where company officials sat. This became the base for the company's trades known as factors. As trade increased the company persuaded merchants and traders to settlle there. By 1696 the British had started building fortifications there which eventually led to the Battle of Plassey in 1757. The factory eventually turned into Fort William. Eventually the village grew and merged with the other two settlements to form Kolkata. Sutanuti eventually became part of North Kolkata in the present day.
