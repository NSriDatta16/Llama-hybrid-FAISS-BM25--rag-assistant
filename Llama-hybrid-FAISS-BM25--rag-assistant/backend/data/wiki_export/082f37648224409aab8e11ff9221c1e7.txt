Carlux (; ) is a commune in the Dordogne department in Nouvelle-Aquitaine in southwestern France.

Population

The village of Carlux has a centrally located 'bourg' (fortification ruin) that dates back to the 12th century, which is currently (June 2013) in the process of repair/restoration, and many other clearly historically and/or architecturally interesting buildings.

As of June 2013, it has a bakery (boulangerie), a butcher/caterer (boucher/traiteur) and a grocery store (épicerie), plus three restaurants (one first class, one very nice if simple and another which claims to be a peasant 'halle').  All seem to be well frequented.

Also located in just outside the village is the Domaine des Bequignolles, a quality chocolate factory with a direct sale (vente directe) counter.

Tha annual village festival (fête) is normally the weekend of the first week in June.
