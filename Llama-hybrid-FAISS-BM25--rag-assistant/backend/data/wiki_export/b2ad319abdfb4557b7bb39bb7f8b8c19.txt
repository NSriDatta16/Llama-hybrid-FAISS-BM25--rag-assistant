Plot
Badal is a young man with a tragic childhood. As a child, he had witnessed his entire family, his loving father, mother, and baby sister, murdered in a village massacre by ruthless and corrupt police officer Jaisingh Rana, who kills people for fun. He is then brought up by his late father's friend Jeetram, who himself is on the run from Rana. Years later, Badal has become a dreaded terrorist work for Jeetram under the name Rajveer whose main target in life is exacting revenge on Jaisingh Rana for his family's horrible death. In this endeavor, Badal travels to a small town, where he meets a good-natured police officer, ACP Ranjeet Singh, who takes Badal under his wing, and Rani, a bubbly free spirited girl who falls madly in love with him. Ranjeet Singh and his wife Simran start considering Badal as their son and his daughters start to look up to Badal as an elder brother. Through both Singh's family and Rani, Badal is given a new lease of life and comes to understand the values of sentiments, love, and relationships, all of which he has missed out on in his life.

Meanwhile, Rana has now been promoted to DIG but still hasn't changed his old evil ways. He has Jeetram captured and tortures him to know the location of his accomplices. Badal frees Jeetram and is pursued by the police force led by Ranjeet Singh. However, Jeetram commits suicide to protect Badal's identity from getting revealed much to the latter's shock and grief.
