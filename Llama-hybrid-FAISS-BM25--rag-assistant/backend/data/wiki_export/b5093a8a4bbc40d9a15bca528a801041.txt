Dravida Brahmins, or simply Dravidulu, is a sub-caste of the Telugu Brahmins of Andhra Pradesh in South India, who migrated from Tamil-speaking regions. They are further divided into sub-sects based on the places where they have settled such as Aaraama Dravidulu, Pudur Dravidulu, Konaseema Dravidulu, Peruru Dravidulu, Tummagunta Dravidulu and Dimili Dravidulu.

Origin
During the reign of Rajaraja Narendra (), many Tamil Brahmin families settled in different parts of Andhra Pradesh. Under Narendra's son, Kulottunga I (), the first Chalukya-Chola emperor, several Brahmins migrated from the Tamil country.

His son Virachodadeva, the Viceroy of Vengi, invited 546 Brahmin families and established them at Virachoda Chaturvedimangalam. Several records of the Chalukya-Cholas register the gift of villages in the plains of Godavari river to Brahmins who migrated from Dravidadesa. These Brahmins who had settled in Andhra region are known as the Dravida Brahmins.

Classification
They fall under the Pancha Dravida Brahmin classification of the Brahmin community in India. Dravida Brahmins are divided into several sub-sects, which are named after the places in which they have settled such Aaraama Dravidulu, Puduru Dravidulu, Konaseema Dravidulu, Peruru Dravidulu, Tummagunta Dravidulu and Dimili Dravidulu.

Most of them speak Telugu as their native language, while Puduru Dravidulu (settled in Nellore district) speak Tamil at home.
