Gransherad is a former municipality in Telemark county, Norway. The  municipality existed from 1860 until its dissolution in 1964. The area is now part of Notodden Municipality (in Telemark) and Kongsberg Municipality (in Buskerud). The administrative centre was the village of Gransherad where Gransherad Church is located.

History

Grandsherred (later spelled Gransherad) was established as a municipality in 1860 after the parish of Hovin (population: 815) in southeastern Tinn Municipality and the parish of Grandsherred (population: 1,310) in western Hjartdal Municipality were merged to form the new municipality. On 1 January 1886, the growing municipality was divided based on its "old" borders, with the old parish of Hovin (population: 885) becoming its own municipality. This left the remainder of Gransherad with a population of 1,393 residents in the now-smaller municipality.

During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the upper Jondalen valley area (population: 132) of eastern Gransherad was transferred to the neighboring Kongsberg Municipality (in Buskerud county). Also on the same date, Gransherad municipality was dissolved and the following areas were merged to form a new, larger Notodden Municipality:
the rest of Gransherad Municipality (population: 1,115)
all of Heddal Municipality (population: 4,844)
the Rudsgrendi area of Hovin Municipality (population: 21)
the town of Notodden (population: 7,523)
