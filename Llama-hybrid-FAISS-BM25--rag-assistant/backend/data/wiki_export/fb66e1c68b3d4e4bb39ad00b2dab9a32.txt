Fort: Prophet of the Unexplained is a Dark Horse Comics comic book limited series created by writer Peter M. Lenkov and artist Frazer Irving. It should not be confused with the 1971 biographical study Charles Fort: Prophet of the Unexplained by Damon Knight, which apart from the title has no connection with the comic book series.

Comic
Fort, featuring the fictional adventures of the famed anomalist Charles Fort is a four-issue miniseries written by Peter M. Lenkov, with art by Frazer Irving. The series was released monthly between June and September 2002 by Dark Horse Comics.

Plot

It's 1899 and as the end of the century draws near a strange killer lurks on the streets of New York. However, only famed anomalist Charles Fort's careful analysis of his news clippings reveals the pattern and further investigation revels some strange findings. At the same time he is monitoring some strange shooting stars, ably assisted by H.P. (a young H. P. Lovecraft) which leads to his encounter with an alien. Falsely accused of the murders, he has to team up with the extraterrestrial and find the real killer.
