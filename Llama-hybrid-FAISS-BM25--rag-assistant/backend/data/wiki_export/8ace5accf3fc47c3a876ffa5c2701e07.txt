Norfolk Regional Airport  (Karl Stefan Memorial Field) is four miles southwest of Norfolk, in Madison County, Nebraska. The airport is named for Karl Stefan, a local newspaper editor and radio announcer who served several terms in the United States Congress. Until March 2011 it was known as Karl Stefan Memorial Airport. The FAA's National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011â€“2015 categorized it as a general aviation facility.

Recent airline service was subsidized by the Essential Air Service program until May 2004, when it ended due to federal law not allowing a subsidy over $200 per passenger for communities within 210 miles of the nearest large or medium hub airport (Eppley Airfield, a medium hub serving Omaha, Nebraska). Federal Aviation Administration records say Norfolk had 1,709 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2001, 1,139 enplanments in 2002, 1,254 in 2003, and 672 in 2004.

The first airline flights were Mid-West Airlines Cessna 190s in 1950-51. Mid-Continent or Braniff arrived by the end of 1952; North Central replaced Braniff in 1957, and successor Republic pulled out in 1982.
