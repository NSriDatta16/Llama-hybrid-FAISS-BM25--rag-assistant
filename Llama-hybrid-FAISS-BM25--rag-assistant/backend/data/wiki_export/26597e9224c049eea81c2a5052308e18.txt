Pray for Mojo is a 1999 album by the American ska punk band Mustard Plug. The title comes from an episode of The Simpsons (“Girly Edition”) which first aired in April 1998.

Critical reception
AllMusic wrote that "what makes this ska core group special is the fabulous horn section of trumpeter Brandon Jenison and trombonist Jim Hofer." The New Haven Register called the album "pop with sharp enough hooks and plenty of enthusiasm, and maybe a little bit of maturity..."
