Thomas More Prep-Marian (TMP-M), TMP, is a co-educational Catholic college preparatory high school located in Hays, Kansas in the United States.  The original school was founded by the Capuchin Franciscan order. Although now governed by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Salina, the order still maintains a presence in the school.

History
Thomas More Prep Marian traces its roots back to 1908 when Hays Catholic College was founded by the Capuchin Franciscans to educate local boys. It was renamed St. Joseph's College in 1931 after moving into a new school building. The following year, it began offering the ROTC program. In 1952 the junior college program was dropped and it became solely a high school. The school name became St. Joseph's Military Academy to reflect this change.

The Girls' Catholic High School was founded in 1918 by the Sisters of St. Agnes and was subsequently renamed Marian High School in 1961.

St. Francis Seminary was founded in 1948 in Victoria, a town approximately 10 miles outside of Hays. It incorporated a high school program to prepare young men for the priesthood.

Marian High, St. Francis Seminary, and St. Joseph's Military Academy all consolidated into Thomas More Prep-Marian between 1970 and 1981.  In 2003, the Diocese took over governance of the school. From the 2012–13 academic year, grades 7 and 8 were added.
