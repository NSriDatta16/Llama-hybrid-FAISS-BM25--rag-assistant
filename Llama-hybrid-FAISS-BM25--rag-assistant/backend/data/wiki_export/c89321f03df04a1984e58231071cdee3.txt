History
Station construction began in 1966 with the proposed name of Xinzhuang railway station, named after the nearby village. However, there had been a station with the same name in Tianjin. When the station opened in 1968, it was named Xinghuo railway station, after the Xinghuo People's commune () (now Liulitun Subdistrict), and the Xinghuo People's commune is named after a famous article written by Mao Zedong, A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire ().

Xinghuo railway station had been a passenger-service station for through trains on the Beijing–Baotou railway (Shuangqiao-Shahe railway), but all passenger services were canceled in 1996 with the speed-up projects. It has been an industrial freight station linking factories including a granary, a cotton depot, a thermal power plant, and the China National Railway Track Test Center (famous for the loop track).

In 2013, Xinghuo railway station was confirmed as the largest terminus of the planned Beijing–Shenyang high-speed railway and renovations began in 2017.
