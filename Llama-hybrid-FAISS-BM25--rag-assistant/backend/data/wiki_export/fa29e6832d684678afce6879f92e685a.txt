Boo! is a British computer-animated children's television series that was broadcast in the United Kingdom on the CBeebies channel, and originally on BBC Two. It features several cartoon characters who play a game similar to hide and seek in a variety of settings. The commentary is performed by adult male and female narrators and a chorus of children. It was produced by the independent production company Tell-Tale Productions, which was also responsible for Tweenies, while Universal Pictures co-funded the production and handled worldwide distribution and consumer product rights. From 2007 to 2012, reruns of the show were broadcast in the USA on Qubo.

The series aired for a total of 104 episodes and one Christmas special was nominated for the British Academy Children's Award for Pre-School Animation in 2003.

At the end of the programme, a song is sung, usually about matching characters or objects to their shapes or colours.

The visual style of Boo! is very distinctive, using 3D CGI with rounded shapes and cel-shading. The music and songs are generally in an early-70s funk/R&B idiom.

Characters
 Boo - a pear/eggplant-shaped patchwork creature with orange spiky hair. His feet are red with white spots on them. The main goal of the programme is to find Boo in his various hiding places. Half-way through each episode, Boo magically adopts attributes of his surroundings (e.g. becomes "Penguin Boo" in the Antarctic or "Pumpkin Boo" on Halloween). Boo cannot talk, although he whistles at the beginning of each episode and dances during every song.
 Laughing Duck (voiced by Kate Harbour) - a yellow duck, who laughs when "found". She has a red-orange bill that matches her legs and has abilities to fly and swim. In some episodes, she meets some people who happen to be employees. In the hospital, she has been found sad because her laugh is lost, but it is regained when Boo tickles her flipper and made her laugh again before we sing the Odd One Out song.
 Sleeping Bear (voiced by Justin Fletcher) a brown bear who is usually asleep, yawning or stretching when "found". His blanket is red with white-printed hearts on it. The catchphrase associated with him is "Shhh... Tippy-toe, tippy-toe." In some episodes, he finds a spot to sleep around anything that is so cozy. In the police station, he was lost in the park until his friends had found him sleeping and sitting on the swing set before we sing the Snap song.
 Growling Tiger (voiced by Justin Fletcher) - a friendly tiger with fluffy white ears. Despite his name, he says "Roar!" (not "Growl!") when "found". His associated catchphrase is "It's Growling Tiger! Run away! Run away!"
 
Other characters, both human and animal vary from one episode to another. The people who have speaking roles in this show are the artists, Chatty Hairdresser, Helpful Nurse, Caring Doctor, Helpful Teacher (the ice-skater), Helpful Waitress, Happy Customers (one man and one woman), Busy Chef, the woman in high stilts, the ringmaster, Careful Grownup, Smiling Santa, Graceful Teacher (the ballet dancer), Friendly Police Officers, Strong Lumberjack, Gentle Vet, Smiley Pumpkin lantern and Cheering Dad. The Blue Squawking Parakeet (actually a Cockatoo) with a red crest on it appears in a birdcage (being taken home by a customer) when we are about to enter the veterinarian.
