After the 2004 season, Williams returned to the Toronto Lynx as a free agent. He made his debut for the club on June 24, 2005, in a match against Minnesota Thunder. At the conclusion of the season the team awarded Williams with the Fan Favorite award. He returned to Toronto for the 2006 season. During the 2006 season he helped the club achieve a 10-game team record undefeated streak at home and reached the finals of the Open Canada Cup, but lost the match 2–0 against Ottawa St. Anthony Italia. For his involvement within the soccer community the club awarded him the Public Relations Award.
