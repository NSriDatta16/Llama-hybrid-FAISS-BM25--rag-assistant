The harmattan air mass (North-East Trade Winds) is usually dry and dusty as it originates from the Sahara Desert. During such periods, rainfall is virtually absent due to low relative humidity, which rarely exceeds 20 percent and low vapour pressure less than 10mb. Day temperatures are high recording 42 °C (especially between February and March) and night temperatures could be as low as 18 °C. The Municipality experiences the tropical maritime air mass between May and October. The average annual rainfall is 950mm.

Notably among these hills include Fie (280 metres), Busono (350 metres) and Zambao (360 metres) above sea level. The drainage system of the municipality is constituted mainly around the tributaries of the Sissili River – Asibelika, Afumbeli, Bukpegi and Beeyi.

Soil 
Two main types of soil are present in the municipality namely the Savannah ochrosols and groundwater laterite. The northern and eastern parts of the municipality are covered by the Savannah ochrosols, while the rest has groundwater laterite The Savannah ochrosols are porous, well drained, loamy, and mildly acidic and interspersed with patches of black or dark-grey clayey soils. The groundwater laterites are developed mainly over shale and granite and cover approximately sixty percent of the municipality's land area. This soil type is suitable for the cultivation of many crops, especially rice and vegetables and hence accounts for the arable land sites including most parts of the Tono Irrigation Project sites where both wet and dry season farming activities are concentrated (KNMA, 2010).

Social and cultural structure

Traditional authority 
There are chiefs and Tindanas/Tigatus in every community. People with these two titles in the communities wield a considerable power and authority over their people. While the chiefs are the traditional political heads in the communities, the Tindanas/Tigatus are the main custodians of the land relate the ancestral traditions and hold in trust for the people. In relation to ownership of land, individuals do not own lands but the family heads hold these in trust for the family. The chiefs oversee the distribution and sale of land. The four Tindanas/Tigatus the original owners of the land, however transfer land to other family heads.

Marriage 
The payment of bride price takes the form of cola nuts, tobacco and guinea fowls. In addition, bridegrooms pay seven sheep and a cow together with the aforementioned items. It becomes obligatory for the bridegroom to present a cow upon the death of the bride if initially he did not present one. If one was unable to pay the sheep and the cow, the children would be mandated to provide one before they can pay dowry for their own wives.

Inheritance 
The patrilineal system of inheritance is practiced. The eldest son inherits the deceased father in trust of the family. There is no form of ownership of family assets by daughters ascribed by the traditional system. Funerals constitute another major customary practice of the people. Funerals are mostly organized after the harvest (and especially during the long dry season). Funerals are performed to mark the end of the transition from earth to life after death (The spirit world).
