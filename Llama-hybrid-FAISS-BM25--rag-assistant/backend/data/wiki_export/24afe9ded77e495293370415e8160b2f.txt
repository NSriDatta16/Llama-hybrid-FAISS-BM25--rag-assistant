A food safety agency or food administration or Food Safety Authority is a government agency responsible for ensuring the safety, quality, and proper labeling of food products within a country or region. These agencies play a crucial role in protecting public health by establishing and enforcing regulations and standards to ensure that food produced, imported, processed, distributed, and sold is safe for consumption. 

Examples of Food Administrations around the world include the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), and the Swedish Food Agency (Livsmedelsverket). Each agency operates within its respective jurisdiction and collaborates with other national and international organizations to promote and maintain food safety globally.
