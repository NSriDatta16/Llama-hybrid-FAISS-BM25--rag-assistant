Shane Patrick Victorino (born November 30, 1980), nicknamed "the Flyin' Hawaiian", is an American former professional baseball outfielder. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the San Diego Padres, Philadelphia Phillies, Los Angeles Dodgers, Boston Red Sox, and Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. He was primarily a switch-hitter until the 2013 season, when discomfort from various hamstring, back, and knee problems forced him to become an exclusively right-handed batter. 

Victorino made his MLB debut with the Padres in 2003. He played for the Phillies from 2005 through 2012. With the Phillies, Victorino won three Gold Glove Awards, was named to two MLB All-Star Games, and was a member of the 2008 World Series champions. With the Red Sox, Victorino won his fourth Gold Glove Award and was a member of the 2013 World Series champions. He also won the Lou Gehrig Memorial Award in 2008 and the Branch Rickey Award in 2011.

Early life
Victorino was born on November 30, 1980, in Wailuku, Hawaii. He is the youngest son born to Mike, Sr. and Joycelyn Victorino in Hawaii. When Victorino was very young he was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

Victorino played baseball, soccer, basketball and football in his youth and ran track. As a senior at St. Anthony High School in Wailuku, he won state championships in the 100, 200 and 400 meters. His 100-meter time set a state record. On the football field, he was a placekicker and slotback for head coach Charley Ane.

Victorino signed a letter of intent to play college baseball for the Hawaii Rainbow Warriors prior to the 1999 MLB draft. After he was selected by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the sixth round, June Jones also offered Victorino a scholarship to play for the Hawaii Rainbow Warriors football team. He signed instead with Dodgers on June 8, 1999.

Victorino was again selected in the Rule 5 draft, on December 13, 2004, by the Philadelphia Phillies. He again failed to stay with the major league club, and was offered back to the Dodgers. The Dodgers declined, so the Phillies retained his contract and assigned him to their Triple-A minor league club, the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons of the International League. He hit .310 in 126 games with the Red Barons, with 18 home runs and 70 RBI, earning International League All-Star and Most Valuable Player honors. Additionally, he was selected as a Baseball America second team Minor League All-Star, a Triple-A All-Star and Phillies Minor League Player of the Year.

2005
Victorino received a September call-up to the Phillies and hit his first MLB home run on September 22 off Tim Hudson of the Atlanta Braves.

2006

Victorino became a starting player when he replaced Bobby Abreu midway through the 2006 season in right field.

2007
Victorino replaced Aaron Rowand, who left by free agency, in center field in 2008. He was a right fielder in 2007.

On June 3, 2007, the Phillies celebrated "Shane Victorino Day" with Victorino hula figurines, and flew his father in from Maui for the game. Victorino ended the day's game with a walk-off home run in the bottom of the ninth against the Giants.

2008
In the 2008 NLDS Game 2 against the Milwaukee Brewers, Victorino hit a grand slam (his first ever in the major leagues, and the Phillies' first postseason grand slam) off CC Sabathia in the bottom of the 2nd inning. Victorino also became the first player in postseason history to have a home run, a double, and two steals in a single game. In 2008, Victorino received the Lou Gehrig Memorial Award.

Victorino's success carried over into the 2008 NLCS, as he continued to make crucial hits and defensive plays for the Phillies. In Game 2, he was 2-for-5 with four RBIs. After the game, Victorino was informed that his grandmother had died. Game 3 saw Victorino in the midst of controversy. After being brushed back by Hiroki Kuroda, Victorino began to gesture towards the non-English-speaking pitcher that it was alright that he throw inside, just as long as he did not do so at his head. After grounding out to second, he continued to gesture at Kuroda and benches from both teams cleared. Victorino quickly became the villain for Dodger fans and was booed each time he came up to bat. After the game, Victorino was fined $2,500 by the league for his part in the incident. Victorino was quick to silence the crowd during Game 4 when he hit a game-tying two-run home run. In their first trip to the fall classic since 1993, the Phillies went on to win the 2008 World Series by defeating the Tampa Bay Rays.

2009

On July 9, 2009, Victorino won the All-Star Game Final Vote with a record-breaking 15.6 million votes and was named the 33rd member of the National League's 2009 All-Star team. He was the first Hawaiian-born positional player to be named to an All-Star team. On August 12, in a game against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field, Victorino was hit with a full cup of beer while making a catch. A complaint was filed with the Chicago police by Victorino and the Cubs, and the fan was charged with two misdemeanor counts. For the 2009 season, Victorino's 13 triples led the majors, and he won his second consecutive Rawlings Gold Glove Award in the outfield. After the season, the Phillies and Victorino agreed to a three-year contract extension, avoiding salary arbitration and buying out his first year of free agency.

2010
In 2010, Victorino set career highs with 18 home runs and 69 RBIs. He also led all National League outfielders with 11 assists and won his third consecutive Gold Glove Award. In the first inning of the clinching Game 3 of the 2010 NLDS against Cincinnati, Victorino made a superb running-and-reaching catch of a line drive in the alley. Without that catch, the game would have been tied, 1–1, with the hitter now on second and a possible big inning for the Reds. Instead, the catch preserved a 1–0 lead. However, in the NLCS, Victorino posted a mere .208 batting average with just two RBIs and six strikeouts against the eventual World Series Champion San Francisco Giants. In 2010, he received the Tug McGraw "Good Guy Award" from the Philadelphia chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America.

Victorino is of Portuguese, Hawaiian, Japanese, and English descent. His last name is of Portuguese origin. In an interview with The Philadelphia Inquirer in 2011, he explained: "My name is really Victorine, which is Portuguese. My great-great-grandpa, when he was in the war, they spelled his name with an O at the end instead of an E, and it became Victorino." He is a Sansei or third-generation Japanese-American on his mother's side. Former Major League pitcher Kanekoa Texeira is a distant cousin of Victorino.

Victorino is a fan of reggae musician Bob Marley and used Marley's songs "Buffalo Soldier" and "Three Little Birds" as at-bat music when he played for the Phillies and Red Sox, respectively. The crowd at Fenway Park would typically sing along with the chorus of "Three Little Birds" whenever Victorino came to bat. When Victorino was traded to the Angels, he ceased using "Three Little Birds" as his at-bat music out of respect for the Red Sox and their fans.

Victorino had a brief acting role in an episode of Hawaii Five-0, playing a character called Shaun.
