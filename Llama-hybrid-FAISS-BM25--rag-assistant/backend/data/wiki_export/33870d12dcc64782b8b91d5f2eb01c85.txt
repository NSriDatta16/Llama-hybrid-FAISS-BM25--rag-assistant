Bromheads (formerly Bromheads Jacket) are a two-piece British garage rock band originating from Sheffield, England.

History
Bromheads formed in Sheffield in 2005, following the split of a band called Fixated. Although often compared to other Sheffield bands who found fame around the same time, such as Arctic Monkeys and Milburn, the band has a somewhat heavier style. Their style also differs due to singer Tim Hampton's southern England accent (he was raised in Yateley, Hampshire).

The band released the singles "Woolley Bridge", "What Ifs + Maybes", "Trip to the Golden Arches"', "Lesley Parlafitt", and "Speaker Box", all released on the Marquis Chacha label. They went on several tours of the UK, and also played across Europe, including in Spain (at the Summercase Festival), Austria, Germany, and the Netherlands. In 2005, they joined the nationwide Club NME tour, and played at South By Southwest in Austin, Texas.

Their first album, Dits from the Commuter Belt, was released on 13 November 2006, and was followed by a tour of over 30 gigs around the UK supported by the Middlesbrough group The Oxfam Glamour Models. They have also played at the London Calling festival in Amsterdam on three occasions, twice in 2006 and once in 2008.

In 2006, the band recorded a cover of The Streets' single "When You Wasn't Famous", which was released on the b-side of the song's 7". The single reached number 8 in the UK charts.

Their song "Fight Music for the Fight" was featured in the video game Burnout Dominator, as well as its successor Burnout Paradise on PS3 and Xbox 360.

Their second album, On The Brain, was released on 22 September 2008.

In September 2009, the band released the single "Boots" (a cover of "These Boots Are Made For Walkin'") as a free download on their official website, but under the name Bromheads, dropping the name word Jacket, as a result of losing the bass player Jono West. Tim Hampton and Dan Potter said they would continue as a two-piece band. It was then confirmed that the band would release a free single every month for a year, finishing in November 2010 with their final free song, "Chocolate Factory". In December 2010, they released, as Bromheads, their third album, called The Lamp Sessions, with 10 original tracks from the last 12 months available singles.

In late 2012, the band released the EP Holding the Gun and announced that they were working on a new album to be released the following year. Their fourth album, Choro, which contained a new song "Gonna Let You Melt", was released on 15 April 2013, available to download at their website.
