Expansion

On August 14, 2014, Philippine Senate President issued statement which included Calbayog Airport in the airport budget priority for 2015 with 678 million pesos allocated.

On May 9, 2017, DOTr begins the construction of new passenger terminal and site development, which also includes a 575-meter runway extension project. It was planned to be finished on April 28, 2019. However, in a progress report announced by the Department of Transportation on November 25, 2019, the construction of the new passenger terminal was then 77% complete, which was way later than the targeted date of completion.

The completion of the new airport terminal and runway extension project was delayed in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The new airport terminal including the newly-extended runway were finally inaugurated on May 5, 2021, after almost 4 years of construction. With the new terminal and runway completed, larger jet aircraft can now land and take off from the airport, which means it can accommodate more flights direct from Manila using the Airbus A320.
