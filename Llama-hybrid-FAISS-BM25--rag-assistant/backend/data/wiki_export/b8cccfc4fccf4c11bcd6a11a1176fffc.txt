Main sights 

Castle, known from as early as the Norman period (11th century). It was held, among others, by the Carafa and Sanseverino families.
Church and convent of Santa Maria de Piano
The Sant'Antuono bridge is an arc-shaped stone structure. It is named after the little Church built by the inhabitants of the river dedicated to St. Anthony the Great, commonly known as St. Antuono. This construction was carried out at the beginning of 1200, by local craftsmen under the technical direction of Benedictine monks, skilled engineers, pontiffs and architects. The bridge had the purpose of facilitating safe exchange between the residents of Plan and those of the Sant'Antuono district, which in earlier times were accessed with uncertain and shaky walkways. The bridge was built on the river "La Terra", a stream of continuous flow; Calvello is one of the few towns in the region bathed in a watercourse of this kind. The bridge had not undergone any alterations due to weather and natural events until the early twentieth century, so that today the condition of the bridge is good, even though the interventions subsequently affected the beauty of the work as a whole.
