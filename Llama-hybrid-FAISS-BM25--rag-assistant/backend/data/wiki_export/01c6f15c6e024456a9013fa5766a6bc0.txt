Two Brothers Brewing Company is an independently owned Illinois-based microbrewery founded by brothers Jim and Jason Ebel in 1996. The brothers brought their knowledge of different brewing styles to the Chicago craft brew market after living in Europe and experiencing the variety of beers available there. Jim and Jason started the business using bulk milk tanks converted into fermenters that were donated to them by their grandfather who was a retired dairy farmer. Two Brothers Brewing has now been in business for over 20 years and has opened multiple locations throughout the Chicago metropolitan area, as well as one in Arizona.

History

Two Brothers Tap House 
The Ebel brothers started in business with their home brewing supply mail order business and retail store in Naperville, Illinois.

Two Brothers Brewing opened first in Warrenville, Illinois in the year 1996 when Jim and Jason Ebel returned to the United States after living in France. When they arrived back home they had difficulty finding the style of beers that were common in Europe. This encouraged the Ebel brothers to enter the brewing industry in order to bring the European-style brews to the Chicago market. Using their prior experience working in a brewery located in Denver, they went into production using bulk milk tanks that were donated to them from their grandfather. Two Brothers Tap House remains in Warrenville, Illinois where they offer tours of their newly equipped brewery to the public every weekend.

Two Brothers Roundhouse 
After establishing themselves in the industry Jim and Jason Ebel set their eyes on expansion. In May 2011 they announced that they had purchased America's Historic Roundhouse in Aurora, Illinois after the former owner filed for bankruptcy. Their intentions were to keep the Roundhouse a restaurant and venue but also planned to include weddings and banquet events. The Roundhouse was built in 1865 for the Chicago and Aurora Railroad. After being abandoned in 1974 it was then purchased by a group of investors led by Walter Payton in 1995 and converted into a restaurant and brewpub. The Roundhouse officially reopened in June 2011 as the Two Brothers Roundhouse.

Two Brothers Tap House and Brewery 
Two Brothers Brewing owners Jim and Jason Ebel then decided to open their first location outside of the state of Illinois in Scottsdale, Arizona. Two Brothers Tap House and Brewery opened its doors to the Arizona market in January 2015. Initially serving as a restaurant for its first 6 months, the Arizona location served its first beer brewed within its Scottsdale brewery in October 2015.

The Craftsman By Two Brothers 
In September 2016 Two Brothers opened The Craftsman in Naperville, Illinois. This multi-level dining establishment integrates a market cafe, modern tavern, and cocktail experience into one location. The Craftsmen includes a bakery, a cafe, a juice bar, a deli, a market, a butcher, a restaurant, and a cocktail bar. However, being the first restaurant the Ebel brothers opened that did not include a brewery, the beers served at this location are brewed elsewhere.

Two Brothers Social Tap 
Jim and Jason Ebel set their eyes on opening the Two Brothers Social Tap in Oak Park, Illinois sometime in June, 2017. The new location is set to open as a cafe and offer coffee, beer, and spirits along with food. The establishment will come as Two Brothers Brewing's fifth location to open and the company's second location without a brewpub.

Beers 

Two Brothers Brewing produces over twenty beers with a wide variety of styles. Their beers are brewed year-round, seasonal, or part of their Special Projects Division.

Sustainability efforts 

Two Brothers Brewing owners Jim and Jason Ebel are passionate about their efforts to promote energy-efficiency in their facilities as they “craft with a conscience.” Their practices include using green, renewable energy at all of their locations, as well as using recycled and recyclable materials in their packaging. Extra money was spent purchasing the latest energy-efficient equipment including an ultra-high efficient boiler which allows for the conservation of water during the brewing process.

To provide their customers with the most fresh produce, Two Brothers facilities grow their own ingredients in their organic rooftop gardens, as well as purchase their products locally from within 200 miles of the restaurant's locations which reduces their carbon footprint by minimizing transportation distance. In a display of their commitment to give back to local communities the brewery supplies local farmers with spent grain to aid them in feeding their cattle.

The Two Brothers Tap House and The Two Brothers Roundhouse were the first restaurants in DuPage County and Kane County respectively, to join the Green Chicago Restaurant Coalition. The mission of Green Chicago Restaurant Coalition is to "empower members of the food service industry and dedicated diners alike to reduce our collective footprint, bolstering the health of our planet and its people." Two Brothers has also joined the Natural Resources Defense Council to support the use of clean water in brewing practices.
