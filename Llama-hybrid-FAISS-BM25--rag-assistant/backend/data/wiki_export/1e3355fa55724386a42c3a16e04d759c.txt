Dunbar John Davis (June 30, 1843 â€“ March 30, 1923) was a Keeper in the United States Life-Saving Service. During his service, he was the Keeper at the Cape Fear Station and was later transferred to the Oak Island Station in 1892. Davis was known for his numerous rescues at sea but is most famous for his rescue during a hurricane in 1893.

Sea Islands Hurricane
In August of 1893, the Sea Islands Hurricane hit the Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina coasts. The historic hurricane, by modern standards, would have been a Category 3 with sustained wind speeds of . However, the hurricane had an unusually low pressure at 931 mbar making it one of the most powerful storms to ever hit the East Coast of the United States.

Davis, who was the Keeper of the Oak Island Station, set off with his few crewmen. Entering the storm and the dangerous waters of the Graveyard of the Atlantic, he and his crew rescued all crewmembers aboard the four ships: Three Sisters, Kate Giffor, Wustrow, and Enchantress.

Later life and death
After the hurricane, Davis lived on another 30 years. Davis died in 1923. He is buried at the Old Morse Cemetery in Southport. There, a row of granite tombstones marks the births and deaths of most of the Davis family. The tallest tombstone, however, is that of Dunbar Davis.
