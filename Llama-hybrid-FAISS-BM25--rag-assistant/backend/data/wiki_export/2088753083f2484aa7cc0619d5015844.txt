Greater Springfield is a private development undertaken by the Springfield City Group and one of the fastest-growing developments in Australia; it is located in Ipswich, in the south-west of the Brisbane metropolitan area in Queensland, Australia. It is the first privately built city in Australia and the country’s largest master planned community (tenth largest globally), encompassing 2,860 hectares (963 acres).

In 2021, the population of Greater Springfield was estimated around 47,000, with a projection to grow to 105,000 residents by 2030. Community development is managed and coordinated by Springfield City Group. The plan is to have a group of suburbs with the population of Darwin by 2030.

In 2019, Springfield City Group was inducted into the Queensland Business Leaders Hall of Fame in recognition of their visionary entrepreneurship in establishing Springfield, as a nation-building project and Australia's first privately-constructed city.

History
Greater Springfield was founded in 1993. In 1993. The land was originally purchased for A$7.9 million and acquired in 1991 by Maha Sinnathamby and Bob Sharpless. Sinnathamby and Sharpless assembled a team and developed Greater Springfield masterplan based on interconnected pillars of health, education and information technology.

The Local Government (Springfield Zoning) Act 1997 was gazetted in view of the long term nature of development being undertaken across Greater Springfield. This Act gave rise to a unique Planning Regime which provides certainty to the developer. The Structure Plan established a unique assessment process that ensures the intentions, provisions and understanding in and behind the Springfield Structure Plan are not to be overreached or changed through Local Planning Policies so to adversely affect the development entitlements conferred by the Structure Plan. All levels of Government recognise that the achievement of this goal is essential to ensure the certainty of the development rights. From Springfield City Group's (SCG’s) viewpoint such certainty is essential to the future proofing of the project.
