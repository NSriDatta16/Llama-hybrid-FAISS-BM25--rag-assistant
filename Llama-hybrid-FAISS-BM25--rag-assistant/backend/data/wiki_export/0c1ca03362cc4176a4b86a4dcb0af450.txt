The Shanghai Stadium () is a football-specific stadium in Shanghai, China. Between 2009 and 2019, the stadium hosted home matches of the Chinese Super League team Shanghai SIPG, and has been the current home of Shanghai Shenhua since 2023.

History
The stadium opened in 1997, when the Eighth National Games of China were held in Shanghai. It was used for football preliminaries at the 2008 Summer Olympics. Shanghai Stadium was also the venue for the opening ceremony of the 2007 Special Olympics World Summer Games. The stadium hosted the 2015 Supercoppa Italiana match between Juventus and Lazio on 8 August 2015.

Between 2020 and 2022, the stadium was completely reconstructed, and the capacity increased from 56,000 to 72,000. The running track was also removed as the venue was converted into a football-specific stadium.
