Reception of works
Bigfoot books - "The trilogy is actually the work of Toronto-based illustrator Graham Roumieu, whose version of the fabled creature is alternately vulnerable and vicious."
A really super book about squirrels - "Either author Graham Taylor and illustrator Graham Roumieu are crackpots with plenty of free time, or they are comedic geniuses with the ability to amuse both young and old." and "On the surface, this book is an inventive, wildly funny story heightened by Roumieu's drawings."
Highly Inappropriate Tales for Young People - "this collection of cruel fables will undoubtedly charm" and "Roumieu's colour illustrations, which in magazines often get to tell a story all on their own, in this book compete with Coupland's verbal wit, which itself usually gets to draw its own absurd images in language.", "Graham Roumieu's illustrations are equally as inventive, loose and surprising, and the result is a charming and also unsettling reading experience."
