Southside Story 2: International is a New Zealand compilation album released by Dawn Raid Entertainment in 2001.

History
Southside Story 2: International was released in June 2001 through Dawn Raid Entertainment as well as King Distribution. Since the release of the first compilation in 2000, Dawn Raid had expanded into a clothing business, opened a streetwear store and a barbershop.

Around this time the founders of Dawn Raid Entertainment Brotha D & Y.D.N.A had begun taking trips overseas to America to investigate the music scene, it was in this environment that the new album was created. With connections made in LA and N.Y,  Dawn Raid licensed tracks from Jymini, hooked in Canadian star Kardinal Offishall, and spent a lot of time establishing the services of underground New York artists such as Ghetto Rustlaz, Prince Domonique and Harlem's own B.A.G.S.

The Deceptikonz debuted their lyrical frenzy on "Elimination" and "Beware", which ended up getting them voted for the best new group at the bFM Awards 2001.
