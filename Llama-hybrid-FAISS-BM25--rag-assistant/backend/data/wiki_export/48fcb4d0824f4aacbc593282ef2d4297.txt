Christopher Widdows  (born 7 December 1968) is an Australian stand-up comedian and actor primarily known by the stage name Steady Eddy. Born with Cerebral palsy, his disability became a key part of his comedy, hence his performing moniker.

Steady Eddy's mainstream career began in 1992 with appearances on popular Australian TV programs like Nine Network's The Midday Show and Seven Network's Tonight Live with Steve Vizard, becoming a frequent personality throughout much of the nineties and early naughts. He was one of the first differently abled performers to be featured prominently in Australian mainstream media.

Stand-up comedy 
He began performing stand-up in 1991, with his first Australian stand-up tour kicking off in 1993 with "Ready Steady Go!". The performance recording won the ARIA Award for Best Comedy Release. He followed up in 1994 with “Quantum Limp”, which won him the Young Australian Achievers Award at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival. Steady performed internationally throughout the nineties including at the Just For Laughs Comedy Festival in Montreal, the Austrian Comedy Festival in Vienna, the Edinburgh Fringe Festival and the LA Comedy Store.

In 1999, Steady Eddy served as Master of Ceremonies for the national tour by Australian band Midnight Oil. As of 2016, he has been part of the musical-comedy duo The Jingo Brothers, with Steady Eddy and Jolly Jingo performing a mix of skits, stand-up, original songs and covers with Adelaide Fringe saying "critics compare them with Peter Cook and Dudley Moore".

Film & TV
Across his career, he has appeared in numerous film and television productions, including a 1994 episode of A Country Practice titled "There Was a Crooked Man". That same year he made his big screen debut in Ben Lewin's romantic-comedy Paperback Romance (also known as Lucky Break in the US) with Anthony LaPaglia and Rebecca Gibney.

In 2004, Steady Eddy co-starred as Trevor in the Australian-made comedy, Under the Radar, alongside Nathan Phillips, Chloe Maxwell and Clayton Watson. He appeared as a character playing himself in the 2007 ABC TV miniseries Bastard Boys.
