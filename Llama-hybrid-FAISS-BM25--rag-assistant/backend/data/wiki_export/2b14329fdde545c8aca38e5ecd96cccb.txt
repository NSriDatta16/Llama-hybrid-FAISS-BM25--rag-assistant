The Battle of Pine Bluff, also known as the Action at Pine Bluff, was an engagement fought on October 25, 1863 in Jefferson County, Arkansas during the American Civil War. The Post of Pine Bluff, a United States garrison commanded by Colonel Powell Clayton, successfully defended the town against attacks led by Confederate Brigadier-General John S. Marmaduke's cavalry division. Much of the fighting took place near Jefferson Courthouse, which the Confederates tried unsuccessfully to set ablaze. The Union victory ensured Pine Bluff was occupied by U.S. forces until the end of the war.
