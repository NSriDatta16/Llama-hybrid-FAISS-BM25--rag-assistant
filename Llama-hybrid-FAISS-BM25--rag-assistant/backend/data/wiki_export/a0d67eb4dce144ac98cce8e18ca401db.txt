Makita Engineering Germany GmbH (Dolmar) is one of the oldest manufacturers of portable gasoline chainsaws and is headquartered in Hamburg, Germany. The company founder, Emil Lerp, developed in 1927 the "type A" saw, which weighed  and required two men to operate. It was tested on Mount Dolmar in the Th√ºringer forest and the company took its name from the test site.

In 1991 the company was acquired by Japanese tool manufacturer Makita.
