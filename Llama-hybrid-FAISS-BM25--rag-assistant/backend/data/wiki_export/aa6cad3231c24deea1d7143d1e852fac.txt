History of Georgetown law newspapers 

The first newspaper at the Law Center was The Hoya, Law School Edition (1933â€“36). This was followed by Res Ipsa Loquitur, which started publishing in 1936. Res Ipsa Loquitur served as the student newspaper and alumni magazine until 1994, when it was replaced by the all-alumni publication Georgetown Law.

The Law Weekly began in 1966, and was originally part of the legal writing requirement program. Archives of these publications are available at the Edward Bennett Williams Law Library.
