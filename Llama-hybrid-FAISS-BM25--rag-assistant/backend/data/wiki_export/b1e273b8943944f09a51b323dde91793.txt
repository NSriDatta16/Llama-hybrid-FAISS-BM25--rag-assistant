Cast

Production
Unlike the previous films, the children no longer have voiceovers for their inner thoughts, since they are now old enough to talk for themselves. Danny DeVito and Diane Keaton portray the Ubriaccos' dogs. This also marked the film debuts of Tabitha Lupien, and David Gallagher, best known for his later role as Simon Camden on 7th Heaven. Charles Barkley makes a cameo appearance as himself.

George Segal, who portrayed Albert, the first film's antagonist and Mikey's biological father, reappears briefly in a dream sequence. Both Twink Caplan, who portrayed Mollie's best friend, Rona, in the previous two films, and Elias Koteas, who portrayed Mollie's brother, Stuart, in the second film, declined to return for this film.

French singer Jordy performs, alongside David Gallagher, Tabitha Lupien, and other children, in a special music video for the film, titled It's Christmas, C'est Noel, from the album of Christmas, Potion Magique.

Release
The film was released in the United Kingdom on May 27, 1994.

Reception
  Roger Ebert gave the film one star out of four and remarked that "it looks like it was chucked up by an automatic screenwriting machine". Gene Siskel gave the film zero stars and called it "an abysmal, embarrassing sequel". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale.

Dan Cox of Variety wrote: "Stretching a premise that one might say has gone to the dogs, Look Who's Talking Now runs feebly on the calculated steam of its forebears". Rita Kempley of The Washington Post wrote: "Take the 'dle' out of 'poodle' and you've pretty much got the leitmotif of Look Who's Talking Now, a crude and mawkish film in which dogs attempt to communicate with Kirstie Alley and John Travolta".

Stephen Holden of The New York Times was somewhat positive, writing that "the sound of stars mouthing the inner thoughts of dogs is somehow funnier than that of grownup actors doing wisecracking voice overs for gurgling infants". Peter Rainer of the Los Angeles Times was also somewhat positive, calling the film "borderline pleasant" because Travolta and Alley "are a marvelous team".

Leonard Maltin's film guide gave it two stars out of four, saying "the first one was cute, the second one was dreadful; this third entry in the series falls somewhere in between".

Box office
Look Who's Talking Now was a box office bomb, only earning over $10 million against its $22 million budget, making it the lowest-grossing film in the series. In its opening week, the film also faced stiff competition for an audience from The Nightmare Before Christmas.
