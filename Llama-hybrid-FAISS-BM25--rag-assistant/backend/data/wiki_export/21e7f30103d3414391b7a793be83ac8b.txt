Dutch mainland separation 
As of 18 February 2010, the village separated from the Dutch government as the republic "Horstermeerpolder", in a protest against flooding their area. As district politics did not listen to their protest, they separated from the main country. A serious act Dutch police are not allowed on their grounds, and they use military vehicles as protection.
