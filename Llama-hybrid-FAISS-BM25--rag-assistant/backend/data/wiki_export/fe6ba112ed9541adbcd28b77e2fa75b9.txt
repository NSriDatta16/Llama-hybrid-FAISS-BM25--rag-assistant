KJEO-LD (channel 39) is a low-power television station in Fresno, California, United States, affiliated with the Spanish-language religious network Canal de la Fe. It is owned by Cocola Broadcasting. Until late 2007, KJEO-LD was also seen on KBID-LP channel 31.

History
The station was first established in 1998 as KMCF-LP.

In 2000, Cocola Broadcasting acquired the call letters KJEO-LP for channel 32, after Fresno's CBS affiliate discarded those calls in favor of KGPE. This call sign was changed to KJEO-LD in September 2009.

On March 30, 2023, Bridge Media Networks, the parent company of NewsNet and Sports News Highlights (SNH) (backed by 5-hour Energy creator Manoj Bhargava), announced it would acquire KJEO-LD and six other Cocola stations for $3.2 million. Upon completion of the transaction, KJEO-LD will become a NewsNet owned-and-operated station for the Fresnoâ€“Visalia media market.

Technical information

Subchannels
The station's digital signal is multiplexed:

 KJEO-LD broadcasts from the Corlew Meadows ("Meadow Lakes") towers location near Auberry, CA (37.073838 -119.432075).
Older, Fresno-area-based terrestrial tuners may/may not receive the Channel 39 broadcast(s). Sensitive terrestrial tuners may reduce tropospheric propagation effects through lowering floor noise, and inadvertently mask one lower-power channel set (i.e. KJEO-LD) and enhance another (i.e. KSDI-LD).
