History
The location was originally called Hollenbeck's Station, (possibly after the namesake of the Sunnyvale street of the same name). It was renamed for Lafayette F. Bell, who had built a saloon at the entrance to a road over Pacheco Pass. Later, Bell bought the road over Pacheco Pass from Andrew Firebaugh and began charging a toll for passage. A Bell's Station Post Office was established by the U.S. Post Office Department, and was in use from 1873 to 1914.

Some references say the locale was a stop on the Butterfield Overland Mail stagecoach route. The stagecoach route to San Francisco from the American midwest was known to have stops every ten miles or so along its length.  Hall of Fame baseball player Harry Hooper was born here in 1887.
