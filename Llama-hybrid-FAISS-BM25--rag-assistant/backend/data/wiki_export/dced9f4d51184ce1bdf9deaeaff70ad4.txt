Laurence James Duggan (born 1949), known as Laurie Duggan, is an Australian poet, editor, and translator.

Life
Laurie Duggan was born in Melbourne and attended Monash University, where his friends included the poets Alan Wearne and John A. Scott. Both he and Scott won the Poetry Society of Australia Prize (Scott 1970, Duggan 1971). He moved to Sydney in 1972 and became involved with the poetry scene there, in particular with John Tranter, John Forbes, Ken Bolton and Pam Brown.  Duggan lectured at Swinburne College ( 1976) and Canberra College of Advanced Education (1983).

His poetry grew out of contemplation of moments and found texts. His interest in bricolage started early: while still at Monash he was working on a series of 'Merz poems', short poems about discarded objects, inspired by the work of Kurt Schwitters. His book-length poem The Ash Range (1987) uses diaries, journals of pioneers, and newspaper articles in its construction of a history of Gippsland.
