6teen is a Canadian animated teen comedy drama television series created by Jennifer Pertsch and Tom McGillis and produced by Nelvana and Fresh TV. Set mainly in the fictional Galleria Mall, the show revolves around the lives of six sixteen-year-old friends as they explore their first part-time jobs, relationships, friendships, and other teenage issues. The series premiered on November 7, 2004 on Teletoon. In the United States, the series first premiered on Nickelodeon on December 18, 2005, and was removed from the schedule on May 13, 2006. The show later relaunched on Cartoon Network in 2008, where 24 episodes were unaired for censorship reasons.
