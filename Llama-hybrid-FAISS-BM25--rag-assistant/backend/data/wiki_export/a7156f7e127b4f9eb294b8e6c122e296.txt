Governance 

Marshfield Community Council represents the area on local authorities and public bodies. It has responsibility for issues including local planning applications, community events and facilities, and protection of the local environment. It works with the police, Newport City Council and other local service providers.

Until the 2022 local elections, Marshfield was the name of an electoral ward, represented on Newport City Council by two councillors. The ward contained the parishes Coedkernew, Michaelston-y-Fedw, Wentlooge, and Marshfield. Following a boundary review, Marshfield was merged with neighbouring Tredegar Park to become Tredegar Park and Marshfield, electing three councillors.

The ward falls within the district or borough of Newport, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Magor and St Mellons Rural District. The Senedd constituency and UK Parliamentary constituency is Newport West.
