The school is located next to a science center which was built especially for Handasaim, used by all high schools in Herzliya. The science center includes advanced labs for physics, chemistry, robotics etc., and is the biggest science center used by high school students in Israel.

The school supports programs such as FRC, FLL and Nachshon.
