 Matthew 11:1 = Ministry of Jesus (continuation of Matthew 10:34-42) (; ; )

The New King James Version organises this chapter as follows:
 = John the Baptist Sends Messengers to Jesus
 = Woe to the Impenitent Cities
 = Jesus gives True Rest

John the Baptist sent messengers to Jesus
Verses 2 to 6 relate to John the Baptist's enquiry about Jesus, relayed by his messengers. Verses 7 to 19 recount Jesus' assessment of John's ministry.

Verses 2–3
Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples,
And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?
Some translations use descriptive words to refer to the expected Messiah: "the one who is to come" (English Standard Version, New Heart English Bible), or "the one we are waiting for" (Living Bible), whereas other translations render the , ho erchomenos, as a title: "the Expected One" (New American Standard Bible), "the Coming One" (Weymouth New Testament, New King James Version).

Verses 20-24

Having set out in verse 1 "to teach and to preach in their cities", verses 20-24 give an account of Jesus' condemnation of the cities of Galilee for their refusal to repent. Jesus worked most of his miracles or "deeds of power" in these cities.

Verse 25
At that time, Jesus answered and said, “I thank You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that You have hidden these things from the wise and prudent and have revealed them to babes.
German Protestant theologian Karl Theodor Keim called this text a "pearl of the sayings of Jesus". Pope Francis has noted with support that Pope Benedict XVI "often pointed out that the theologian must remain attentive to the faith lived by the humble and the small, to whom it pleased the Father to reveal that which He had hidden from the learned and the wise”.

Verse 27
All things have been delivered to Me by My Father, and no one knows the Son except the Father. Nor does anyone know the Father except the Son, and the one to whom the Son wills to reveal Him.
The Jerusalem Bible suggests that this verse has "a Johannine flavour", observing that "awareness of Christ's divine sonship exists in the deepest stratum of the synoptic tradition as well as in [John]."

Verse 28
Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden,
 and I will give you rest.
"Come unto me" (, deute pros me): also in , where the , deute opiso mou, is often translated as "follow me". In verse 28 there is less thought of the process of coming than in the very similar invitation in .
