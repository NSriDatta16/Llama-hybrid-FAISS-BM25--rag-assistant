Historical district boundaries
From 1993 to 2013, the 36th was located in southwestern Los Angeles County and included Manhattan Beach, Hermosa Beach, Torrance, Redondo Beach, and portions of Los Angeles itself. This district was largely dismantled after the 2010 census, and moved east to Riverside County and includes Palm Springs and La Quinta. The current 36th is largely the successor of the old 45th district.
