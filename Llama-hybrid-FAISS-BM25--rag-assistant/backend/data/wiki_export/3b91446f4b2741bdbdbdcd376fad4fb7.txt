"How Do You Do!"  is a pop rock song by Swedish pop duo Roxette. It was released as the lead single from their fourth studio album Tourism on 3 July 1992. The track was a commercial success upon release, topping the Norwegian Singles Chart and peaking at number two in several countries, including Austria, Belgium, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. The single was backed by several remixes created by Swedish production duo BomKrash, which consisted of Jacob Hellner and Carl-Michael Herlöfsson.

Composition and style
According to Ultimate Guitar, "How Do You Do!" is an uptempo pop rock song written in common time with a tempo of 121 beats per minute. It utilises a common trait found in Roxette compositions of the verse using a different key signature than the chorus. The verse is composed in C, and consists of three repetitions of a basic C–F–G–F sequence, followed by one shortened sequence of C–F–G. The pre-chorus makes use of a power chord structure, and consists of a sequence of Am–G–F–C–Em, which is then amended to Am–G–F–G. Following a brief pause, Marie Fredriksson takes over lead vocals for the song's chorus, which moves up from the verses by two keys to E♭. The chorus is composed almost entirely of sharp notes, and follows a sequence of D♯–A♯–D♯–G♯–A♯–Cm–G♯–A♯–Cm–G♯–A♯. The bridge consists of four short repetitions of Cm–A♯, played as power chords. The last chorus and outro are in F, following the transposed sequence F-C-F-B♭-C-Dm-B♭-C-Dm-B♭-C. American musician Tiny Tim is referenced in the song's lyrics.

Critical reception
In his review of Tourism, AllMusic editor Bryan Buss wrote that "How Do You Do!" is a "perfectly presented pop ditty, bright and sunny as summer". Larry Flick from Billboard described the song as a "peppy, guitar-anchored pop/rocker." He noted that "bopping pogo beats and Per Gessle's highly attitudinal lead vocal are strongest points in luring radio programmers." Gavin Report called it a "fun track" that "starts off with a froggy-voiced Per Gessle posing the most asked question in the English language."
