Keith Carlton Fergus (born March 3, 1954) is an American professional golfer who has played on the PGA Tour, the Nationwide Tour and the Champions Tour.

Early life and amateur career 
Fergus was born in Temple, Texas. He started playing golf at age 8. In high school, he played football and basketball but enjoyed practicing golf more than the other sports. He attended and was a member of the golf team at the University of Houston, where he was a 3-time All American and runner-up to Jay Haas at the 1975 NCAA Championship.

Professional career 
Fergus  turned pro in 1976. He had his best years on the PGA Tour in the early 1980s. During his PGA career, he had over 40 top-10 finishes and won three events. His best finish in a major was a T-3 at the 1980 U.S. Open; he also had a T-4 at the 1981 PGA Championship. He began using the long putter in 1988. Fergus took a break from the tour in 1988 when he accepted the head golf coaches job at his alma mater, the University of Houston, a position he held until 1994.

Fergus resumed tour play in the mid-1990s on both the Nationwide Tour and, on a limited basis, in PGA Tour events. In 1996, at the Nortel Open, he was attacked by a swarm of killer bees and was stung 10 to 15 times; his caddie was stung more than 50 times.

After turning 50 in March 2004, he began play on the Champions Tour. His first win was the 2007 Ginn Championship Hammock Beach Resort, where he became the second player to win on all the PGA Tour sponsored tours (PGA Tour, Nationwide Tour, and Champions Tour), the first being Ron Streck in 2005.

Fergus won the Cap Cana Championship in March 2009 where on Sunday, he shot a five-under-par 67 which included a dramatic holed out eagle 2 on the par 4 17th hole to give him the one stroke victory over Mark O'Meara and Andy Bean. It was his second Champions Tour win.

Fergus has done some course design work and starred in some television commercials. He lives in the Houston suburb of Sugar Land. In his spare time, he enjoys fishing.
