Kickstarter commissions
The band routinely offer the option for backers of their frequent Kickstarter campaigns to commission them to record an original song or cover version of a song by another artist. Although these are usually only made available to the backer, many have been made available online by their backer, leaked online or subsequently included on releases by the band.
