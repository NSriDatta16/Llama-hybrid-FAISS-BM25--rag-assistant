Ma On Shan is a new town along the eastern coast of Tolo Harbour in the New Territories of Hong Kong. Although it was initially an extension of Sha Tin New Town, it has its own town centre and various government facilities, and is now classified as a separate new town in government reports. Administratively, it belongs to Sha Tin District.

Geography 
Ma On Shan is located by the west face of the twin peaks of Ma On Shan, which can be translated as "horse saddle mountain". The town is built on the strip between Tolo Harbour and Ma On Shan mountain. The north end of the town reaches the settlement of Wu Kai Sha and the southern Tai Shui Hang.

History 
The original Ma On Shan Village still houses around 80 families. Yan Kwong Lutheran Church, one of two original churches established during the area's mining heyday, was revitalised in around 2014 as a centre to highlight the history and culture of the old village.

Deep inside the slope of Ma On Shan was an iron mine. Due to the 1970s energy crisis the progressing New Town development and unprofitability, Ma On Shan Iron Mine was closed in 1976.

Three treasures

Historically, the three treasures of Ma On Shan were:

1. Iron ore: The deposit is estimated to have comprised over 7 million tonnes. The iron extracted from the 1950s to 1970s was mainly exported to Japan.

2. Azaleas: The azalea species Rhododendron hongkongense was discovered in Hong Kong in 1851 but was mistaken for another, only acquiring its "Hongkong" name in 1930. The species, which is found only on Ma On Shan and a few nearby sites, blooms in April with colours ranging from white to light red. Since 2006, an annual "Ma On Shan Azalea Festival" has promoted the azalea as the symbol of the district, celebrating six locally native species: (Rhododendron championae, Rhododendron farrerae, Rhododendron hongkongense, Rhododendron moulmainense, Rhododendron simiarum and Rhododendron simsii) Various activities are held, including planting azaleas in housing estates and greenery areas, a photo-taking competition, painting competition, and exhibitions. The event is organised by Sha Tin East Area Committee of the District Council, Sha Tin District Office, Civil Engineering and Development Department, Leisure and Cultural Services Department, Ma On Shan Promotion of Livelihood and Recreation Association, the MTRC and various other bodies.

3. Indian muntjac (Muntiacus muntjak): The natural habitat of this deer species includes Hong Kong and goes as far west as India, Pakistan and Afghanistan. The male has short antlers and canine teeth and likes to rest in bushes or tall grass. It feeds on leaves, underground roots and tubers, and sometimes tree bark. They live alone and if they are scared or during the mating season, produce a strange bark, hence their nickname barking deer. They are timid and shy, with records showing that some local specimens died of fright when captured. 

Development of public housing estates commenced in the mid-1980s, with Heng On Estate completed in 1987, followed by Chevalier Garden in 1988. The Ma On Shan line of the MTR, previously the KCR Ma On Shan Rail, was opened in 2004. It was later merged into the Tuen Ma Line.
