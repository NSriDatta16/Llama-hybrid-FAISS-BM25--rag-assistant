"Another Day" is a song by American progressive metal band Dream Theater, released in their 1992 album Images and Words. It was released as the album's second and final single in 1993.

Background 
The song was written by guitarist John Petrucci. He wrote it about his father, John Petrucci Sr. who was diagnosed with cancer. Petrucci Sr. would be the subject of another Dream Theater song, "Take Away My Pain" following his death. The video for Another Day follows the song's lyrics, with a father and son spending time together. MRI scans are visible in the background, tying in to the cancer theme.
