Port Lambton is an unincorporated community in St. Clair Township, Lambton County, Ontario, Canada.
  According to the latest census, 1084 people live within this community.

In its early days, the village developed out of local transport and agricultural trade via rail and ship and evolved mainly into a summer resort community, serving seasonal residences and summer cottagers through much of its history. The village is now home to mostly permanent residences and commuters supported by larger cities and towns such as Sarnia and Wallaceburg.  Every Civic Holiday weekend in August the town hosts its annual Gala Days. This community is served by two elementary schools, several churches, and a small service industry. The public school is Riverview Central School and the Catholic school is Sacred Heart. Until the mid-1980s Port Lambton served as a registered port of entry into Canada by utilizing a ferry crossing from nearby Roberts Landing, Michigan, and docking facilities on much of the village's waterfront. Following the ending of ferry operations at Port Lambton, the former port facility and Customs office located at the foot of Stoddard Street on the St. Clair River was transferred to the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. The federal government through the Canadian Coast Guard continues to operate the facility as a seasonal Inshore Rescue Boat Station.

History

The village of Port Lambton has its roots in the settlement of Baby's Point. Located just south of the village of Port Lambton, in the area that is now Brander Park, Baby's Point is the extreme southern point of Lambton County. François Baby owned all the land from this point and all of the Port Lambton site.  Inherited from his grandfather in 1742.  There also was a brother, Jacques Baby.  Edward Kelly was the first postmaster at Baby's Point in 1848.

After 1812, people started to settle along the St. Clair River. Before few people lived there. They were French and didn't have legal title to the land.  When the Irish moved in, the French sold their squatter's rights to the Irish in about 1833. The Natives could sell land only with the approval of the Province.
