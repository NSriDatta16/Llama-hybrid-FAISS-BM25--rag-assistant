About 

Lake Park Estates contains 288 homes, most of which were built in the 1950s and 1960s. The neighborhood features variations on traditional ranch style houses, and it has some eclectic homes, including a notable home designed by Glenn Allen Galaway, a student of architect Philip Johnson.

All but one of the streets in the neighborhood are named after Irish locations or themes: Donegal, County Cork, Waterford, Athlone, Kilarney, Tralee, Erin, Galway, Tipperary, Bridget, Limerick, and Wicklow. The sole exception is Tranquilla, which continues up from Casa Linda Estates, a neighborhood with Spanish-inspired street names.
