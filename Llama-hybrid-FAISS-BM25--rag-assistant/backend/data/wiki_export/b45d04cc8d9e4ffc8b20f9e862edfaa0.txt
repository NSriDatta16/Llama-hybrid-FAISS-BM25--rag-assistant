The Departmental Council of Mayotte () is the local authority overseeing the Department of Mayotte. The legislative branch is composed of the council itself acting as a deliberative assembly, while the executive is composed of the President of the Council and their Vice-Presidents. The members of the council, known as Departmental Councillors and 26 in number, are directly elected for a 6-year term in single seat constituencies; half of the seats are renewed every 3 years.

Mayotte became an overseas department and an overseas region in 2011, ending its previous unique transitional status of departmental collectivity. Until March 2015 the assembly of a department of France was known as a General Council ().
