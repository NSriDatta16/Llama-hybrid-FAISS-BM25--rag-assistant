The Plainfield Curling Club (or PCC) is a nonprofit curling club located in South Plainfield, New Jersey.  It owns and operates the only dedicated curling facility in New Jersey.  It was founded in 1963, with the members initially using rented ice and curling outdoors. The current two-sheet structure was completed in 1967.

The PCC season runs from late October through early April.  As of the 2018–2019 season, the club holds league play seven days per week, hosts six annual bonspiels, and  has programs for juniors (teenagers) and “little rockers” (ages 6–12). It also hosts supervised programs for members of the public to try curling.

The club had a significant increase in membership for the 2002–2003 season, after U.S. television coverage of curling in the 2002 Winter Olympics increased awareness of the sport.  There was a similar spike in membership for the 2006–2007 season due to the 2006 Winter Olympics television coverage. Interest in the sport at the club again peaked after the 2010 Winter Olympics.

Plainfield Curling Club is part of the Grand National Curling Club  and part of the United States Curling Association.
