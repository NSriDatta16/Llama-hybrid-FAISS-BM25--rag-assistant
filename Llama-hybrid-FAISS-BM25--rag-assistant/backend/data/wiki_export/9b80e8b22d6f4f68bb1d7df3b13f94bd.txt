The Voice of the Cape is a Muslim community radio station based in Cape Town, South Africa. The first Muslim radio station in South Africa, the station started broadcasting on a special license in 1995 for the month of Ramadaan. Entirely community-owned and independent, its license is held by the Muslim Broadcasting Corporation. The idea of a Muslim radio station was born in the early 1990s by such people as Imam Noor Davids and Imam Gassan Solomon (then Secretary General of the Muslim Judicial Council), for the purpose of community advancement.

Subsequent temporary broadcast licenses were granted, permitting the station to broadcast for 24 hours, sharing the frequency with another Muslim radio station. In June 2002, the station was awarded a four-year license on the same basis, one which has been successfully renewed in 2006.According to the broadcasting authority, VOC is an interest-defined community broadcaster licensed to serve the cultural interest of the Muslim community. The station’s mandate is to inform and educate the community about Islam, with an inherent focus on religious teachings. Another focus of VOC’s programming is to report matters of cultural, political, social and economic significance.
