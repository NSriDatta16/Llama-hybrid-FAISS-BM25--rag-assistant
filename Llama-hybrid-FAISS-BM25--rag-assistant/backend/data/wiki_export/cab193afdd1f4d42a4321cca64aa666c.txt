A Pakistani boy named Ali (Shaan), who is a banker, falls in love with her. After the pilgrimage, she goes back to her country. Ali realizes that he feels lost without her and goes after her. They both are delighted to see each other, but Preety's friend in India, who is also in the Indian Army, is not able to deal with  Preety falling in love with a Pakistani as he wants to marry her.
