El-Zayat also represented Ahmad Ibrahim al-Sayyid al-Naggar in the 1999 case of the Returnees from Albania.
On 1 December 2002 the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review reported that el-Zayat "accused the United States of 'invading the region and imposing its policies â€” it wants to interfere with our life, and it wants us to modify our religious curriculum. ... This is why the people approved of what happened in Kuwait, Yemen and Bali".

El-Zayat is currently the lawyer for the Egyptian cleric, Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr. He was living in exile in Italy when he was allegedly abducted by the CIA's Special Activities Division under the direction of Robert Seldon Lady.Invited to defend a Guantanamo captive
In May 2009, Al Arabiya'' reported that el-Zayat had been invited to defend Mustafa al-Hawsawi, one of the fourteen high-value detainees held at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, before a Guantanamo military commission. El-Zayat described thinking at first that he was the target of a hoax.
