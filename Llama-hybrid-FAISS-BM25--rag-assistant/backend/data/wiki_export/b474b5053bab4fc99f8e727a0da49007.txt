League notes
The Calgary Hitmen joined the WHL as its 17th franchise, playing in the Central division.
The Tacoma Rockets relocated to Kelowna, British Columbia to become the Kelowna Rockets.
The WHL divided into three divisions: The East and Central divisions formed the Eastern Conference, and consisted of five teams per division.  The West division was made up of the seven B.C. and U.S.-based teams.
The playoff format was changed so that the top eight teams in the Eastern Conference and the top six in the West division qualified.  The 14 playoff qualifiers all played best-of-seven series in the first round.  The East semifinals were best-of-seven affairs, while the highest remaining seed in the West earned a bye.  The remaining two West teams played a best of five series.  Conference and League final series were best of seven.
 The Spokane Chiefs became the first team in WHL history to win a seven-game playoff series after being down 3 games to 0 against the Portland Winter Hawks.
