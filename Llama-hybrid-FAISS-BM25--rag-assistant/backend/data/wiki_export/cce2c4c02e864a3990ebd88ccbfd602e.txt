This was followed in 1927 by the RM-2 glider, which he tested at Sinaia. He obtained a pilot license in 1930. From 1931 to 1937 he earned an engineering degree from the University Politehnica of Bucharest, and then pursued his studies at École supérieure des techniques aéronautiques et de construction automobile (ESTACA), in Paris.
