Club career

Originating from an ethnic Aromanian family, Dan Coe, nicknamed Ministrul Apărării ("The Minister of Defence"), was born on 8 September 1941 in Bucharest and started playing football in 1956 at the junior squads of Rapid București, making his Divizia A debut on 18 March 1962 in a 1–1 against Minerul Lupeni. He remained with Rapid for ten seasons, being for a while the team's captain, winning the league title in the 1966–67 season, being used by coach Valentin Stănescu in 26 matches. He also played 4 games in the 1967–68 European Cup, four in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup and won two Balkans Cup with Rapid. In 1971 he managed to earn a transfer in Belgium at Royal Antwerp, being one of the few Romanian footballers that was allowed by the communist regime to play in Western Europe. After two years in which he played 38 games and scored 8 goals in the Belgian First Division, he came back to Romania, playing for Divizia B club, FC Galaţi, helping the club earn promotion to Divizia A, where in the following season on 8 December 1974 he made his last appearance in the competition in a 6–0 loss in front of Universitatea Craiova, having a total of 214 Divizia A matches played with 12 goals scored.

Personal life

Death
After he ended his playing career, he obtained permission from the communist regime to go on a trip in Belgium, but after he arrived there he settled in Cologne, West Germany as a political refugee. Shortly after an interview on Radio Free Europe in which he criticized Romania's communist regime, Coe was found dead in his apartment on 19 October 1981. His wife and his daughter found him hanged by the door handle with a rope around his neck and with his knees close to his mouth. The criminologist that investigated the case told them that he had never seen someone hang himself in such a way, therefore he recorded it as a suspicious death and it was subsequently believed that he was killed at the behest of the Romanian Securitate, but this has never been proven, his friend and fellow Romanian political refugee, Nora Nagy saying years later to the press:"I don't remember what Dan said at Free Europe. Anyway, once I got here I didn't pay that much attention to the station's broadcasts, but Dan was outspoken and always spoke his mind. However, I noticed one thing. After the collaboration with Free Europe began, all sorts of dubious characters began to appear around him. I suspected many of them to have connections with the Securitate".
