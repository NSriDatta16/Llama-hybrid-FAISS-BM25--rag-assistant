The Bamboozle is an annual three-day music festival which was held in New Jersey from 2003 to 2012, and was scheduled for a 2023 revival in Atlantic City by its founder. Every year, new bands competed for spots during the two days. The event evolved out of the Skate and Surf Festival. The 2012 event was the final one of its original run, as founder John D'Esposito subsequently left Bamboozle due to creative differences with organizing partners.

2012

On November 7, 2011, John D'Esposito, the founder, tweeted a picture from Asbury Park, New Jersey, hinting that the festival would return there to celebrate its 10-year anniversary. This was later confirmed on the festival website. The festival took place from May 18–20, 2012, with Incubus, Foo Fighters, Mac Miller, Skrillex, Bon Jovi, Brand New and My Chemical Romance as the headliners. Originally Blink-182 were due to perform, but were replaced by My Chemical Romance when Blink-182 cancelled due to Travis Barker's medical issues. Bamboozle refused to accept refunds after Blink-182 pulled out.
In 2012, Bamboozle offered had contactless admission with wristbands using RFID technology.

Departure of John D'Esposito and end of the festival
In 2012, festival creator John D'Esposito. announced that he was no longer a part of Bamboozle due to creative differences with LiveNation and House of Blues. He later clarified in an interview that while he was disappointed in Live Nation's support of the festival, "It wasn't LiveNation that did this – House of Blues did. House of Blues is 100% responsible for the damage of Bamboozle."

Return of John D'Esposito and 2023 revival of the festival
In 2021, John D'Esposito reacquired the rights and trademarks of Bamboozle from Live Nation. He mentioned May 5 to 7, 2023 as the date the festival would be held in a New Jersey location.  In 2022, it was stated that the location would be Bader Field in Atlantic City.  

The rebooted festival was allegedly scheduled for Bader Field in May 2023, with acts including E-Town Concrete, Coi Leray, Ice Spice, Trippie Redd, Limp Bizkit, A Boogie Wit da Hoodie, and Papa Roach.

The 2023 event, to be held May 5th-7th was canceled only one week prior. This is partly due to lies surrounding the lineup, false claims that Black Friday sale prices would be the cheapest way to purchase tickets, and lying about the amount of tickets sold. The event was mainly canceled because John managed to promote and book acts for a festival he never properly secured the permits for.
