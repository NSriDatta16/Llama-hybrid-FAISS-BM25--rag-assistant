Australian Theatre for Young People (ATYP) is a not-for-profit national youth theatre company located in Woolloomooloo, New South Wales, Australia. It was founded in 1963 by Eleanor Witcombe.

History
The first committee was formed in 1963 and consisted of Alastair Duncan as chairman, Diana Sharpe as secretary, Nigel Lovell as treasurer as well as Ellis Irving, Owen Weingott and Wendy Blacklock.

ATYP's first production was the comedy She Stoops to Conquer - Goldsmith Examined by Oliver Goldsmith, adapted and directed by Owen Weingott.

Location
Since 1997, ATYP was housed at The Wharf, Pier 4/5, but due to construction that started in July 2018, ATYP has temporarily relocated its office to Woolloomooloo.

Their performance spaces are SBW Stable's Theatre, Riverside Theatres, Parramatta and The Joan, Penrith.

ATYP productions have toured regionally, such as Sugarland, nationally, such as A Town Named War Boy, and internationally, such as Patrice Balbina's Chance Encounter with the End of the World.
