Ballyphehane () is a suburb in the south of Cork in Ireland. It is one of the oldest suburbs in Cork and was created as part of a post-World War II initiative to create a model community in Cork. Between 1948 and 1993, a total of 11 housing schemes totalling 1,316 dwellings were built by Cork Corporation, now known as Cork City Council. Many of the main roads in Ballyphehane are named after the executed leaders of the 1916 Rising.

The electoral divisions of Ballyphehane A and Ballyphehane B have a combined population of over 1400 people.

Location
Ballyphehane is bordered by the Lough Parish, South Parish, Douglas/Frankfield, and Turners Cross. The Tramore river flows through the parish. The Church of the Assumption is the Catholic church in the parish.
