Hawaii Teen USAs have been quite successful at Miss Teen USA, and are ranked fifteenth in terms of number and value of placements  and were ranked third in the 1980s .  Kelly Hu won the competition in 1985 becoming the 3rd state that won the Miss Teen USA title for the first time and Kiilani Arruda won in 2020 becoming the 38th Miss Teen USA titleholder, while two other Hawaii teens have placed as first runner-up.
