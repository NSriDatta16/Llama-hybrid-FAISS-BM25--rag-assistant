The Kiryati Brigade (the 4th Brigade in the 1948 Arab-Israeli war) was formed in 1948 by David Ben-Gurion and was one of the original nine brigades that made up the Haganah. The Kiryati Brigade was initially responsible for securing the area in and around Tel Aviv. The brigade participated in several battles during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, and also played a role in the Suez War.
