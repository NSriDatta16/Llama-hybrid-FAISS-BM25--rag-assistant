History
The origins of Beechwood House date back to 1855, located on Calverley Mile Road (now Pembury Road) amid a number of other Italian style Victorian villas of the time. The School celebrated its centenary in 2015. This was marked by alumni events and the collation of artifacts for a time capsule to be opened in 2065. Founded by the Society of the Sacred Heart in 1915, Beechwood retains its founders' traditions but today welcomes pupils of all faiths.
 
Beechwood's Headmaster is Mr Justin Foster-Gandey.
