Miller was born the son of a tavern owner in Lynchburg, Virginia. Miller studied law under Judge Archibald Stewart of Staunton before moving to Rogersville, Tennessee, in 1796. Following his move from Rogersville to Knoxville in 1800, where he practiced law with Thomas Emmerson, Miller was married to Mary Louisa Blount, daughter of Tennessee statesman William Blount. He became known as one of the best criminal trial lawyers in Tennessee because of his wit and oratorical skills.
