Counterstrike is a Canadian/French crime-fighting/espionage television series.  The series premiered on American cable channel USA Network on July 1, 1990. It ran for three seasons, airing 66 hour-long episodes in total.

Plot 
After his wife is kidnapped by terrorists, international industrialist Alexander Addington assembles a clandestine team of troubleshooters to help combat terrorism around the world.  He recruits Peter Sinclair from Scotland Yard to lead the team.  They set up a French con artist and art/jewelry thief named Nicole Beaumont and blackmail her into joining because of her valuable criminal connections.  The third team member is Luke Brenner, an American mercenary whom they rescue from a Mexican jail.  The series' other recurring characters are Bennett and J.J., Alexander's valet and pilot, respectively.

In the second season's second episode Peter and Alexander encounter a French reporter named Gabrielle Germont whom they recruit into the team to prevent her from publishing a story about them.  In the season's third episode Peter and Gabrielle rescue Hector Stone, an American CIA-operative and former Navy SEAL whose cover has been blown, and invite him to join the team.

The character of Alexander's daughter Suzanne Addington, who designed the team's computer systems, was also written out of the series at the beginning of the second season.  Suzanne appears in one third season episode, although played by a different actress.  In her stead Alexander gets a secretary/confidante named Hélène Previn.
