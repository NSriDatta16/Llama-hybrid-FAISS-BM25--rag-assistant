Minister of local government
Sande was appointed minister of local government on 16 October 2023, following a cabinet reshuffle.

2023
A week after assuming office, Sande rejected criticism from Kristiansand mayor Mathias Bernander that the government's proposed law to intervene to approve local referendums would weaken local democracy. Sande argued that in the case of SÃ¸gne and Sogndalen, they were simply listening to the local population and reiterated that the government would pay for a potential break-up of the merged municipality.

Personal life
Sande is married and has two sons.
