In December 1946, in Cochinchina a pro-French cabinet led by Dr. Le Van Hoach as Prime Minister was established, and Tran Van Huu was awarded the position of Minister of Finance. Due to the unstable political situation at this time, many civil servants quit their jobs, or left for resistance zones. In response, Tran Van Huu decided to increase wages for civil servants, calling them back to work for the government. However, the activities of the government of Le Van Hoach proved ineffective. Another government, led by Lieutenant General Nguyen Van Xuan, was established.

Hữu served as leader of the Committee for Peace and Renewal of South Vietnam, an organization that lobbied for peace and the neutralization of Vietnam in the Cold War.
