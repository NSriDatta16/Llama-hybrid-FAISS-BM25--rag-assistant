Carroll County Public Schools is a school district based in Westminster, Maryland. CCPS is the ninth largest county in the state of Maryland. Nearly 26,000 students are enrolled in the county's public schools. The school system includes all of Carroll County, Maryland.

Leadership 
The schools are administered by superintendent Mrs. Cynthia McCabe. McCabe was appointed to a four-year term as Superintendent of Carroll County Public Schools effective July 1, 2022.

In 2022, the school board announced in the April meeting that pride flags would not be permitted to be â€œflown, posted, or affixed to the grounds, walls, doors, ceilings or any other Board of Education property," after a donation of flags from the local chapter of PFLAG were raised in classrooms. The school board has voted to develop a new policy on the use of political symbols, specifically flags, in school buildings, but the heated debate continues.

The board of education consists of five elected board of education members and one non-voting student member.

As of July 2023, the members are President Marsha Herbert, Vice President Tara A. Battaglia, Patricia S. Dorsey, Donna M. Sivigny, and Stephen D. Whisler. The current student representative is Sahithya Sudhakar .
