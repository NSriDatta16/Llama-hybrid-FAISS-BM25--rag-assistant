Diamond Dave is the sixth and most recent studio album by David Lee Roth, former lead vocalist of Van Halen. It was released in 2003 on Magna Carta Records.

Background
The album was recorded at Henson Recording Studios in Hollywood, California. It consists mostly of covers of older hard rock and blues songs, and has an overall laid back bluesy sound. Two of the tracks—a remake of the 1978 Van Halen song "Ice Cream Man" and a cover of "Bad Habits"—had been recorded in 1996, but were not released at that time.
