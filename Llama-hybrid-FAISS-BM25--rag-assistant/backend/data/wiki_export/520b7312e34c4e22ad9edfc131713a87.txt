Cemetery Junction is the title of a 2010 film, directed by Stephen Merchant and Ricky Gervais, which was released in the UK on 14 April 2010 and which tackles love and class in Reading in 1973. Gervais explained that the title of the film was taken from Cemetery Junction, Reading, an area he knew as a child. Gervais also adds "[...] it's not really set in Reading, it's any small town, anywhere in the world to be honest."
