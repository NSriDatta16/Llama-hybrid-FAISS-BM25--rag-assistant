The Englewood Public School District is a comprehensive community public school district that serves students in pre-kindergarten through twelfth grade from Englewood, in Bergen County, New Jersey, United States. The district's offices are in the Administration Building at the Russell C. Major Liberty School.

As of the 2018–19 school year, the district, comprised of five schools, had an enrollment of 3,078 students and 247.0 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 12.5:1.

Students from Englewood Cliffs attend Dwight Morrow High School, as part of a sending/receiving relationship with the Englewood Cliffs Public Schools. In 2013, the Englewood Cliffs district announced plans to consider ending the sending relationship by creating its own high school, possibly in conjunction with the Englewood Cliffs campus of Saint Peter's University.

The district participates in the Interdistrict Public School Choice Program at Dwight Morrow High School, having been approved on November 2, 1999, as one of the first ten districts statewide to participate in the program. Seats in the program for non-resident students are specified by the district and are allocated by lottery, with tuition paid for participating students by the New Jersey Department of Education. The Dwight Morrow choice program has been the state's largest.

The district is classified by the New Jersey Department of Education as being in District Factor Group "DE", the fifth-highest of eight groupings. District Factor Groups organize districts statewide to allow comparison by common socioeconomic characteristics of the local districts. From lowest socioeconomic status to highest, the categories are A, B, CD, DE, FG, GH, I and J.
