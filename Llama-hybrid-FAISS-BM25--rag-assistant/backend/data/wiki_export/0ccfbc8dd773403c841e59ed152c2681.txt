Government service

Mackay was Deputy Secretary of Veterans Affairs from May 2001 to October 2003.  As the department's second in command and designated chief operating officer, he had operational authority over the department's three major agencies:  the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the nation's largest integrated healthcare system; the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA); and the National Cemetery Administration. He concentrated on departmental management initiating a Strategic Management Council, reformulating the departmental budget process, and changing the internal merit system for GS/SES personnel.  He was concentrated on the CARES project, a capital asset realignment of VHA; enhanced use leasing; lowering the backlog of pending veterans' claims; achievement and maintenance of a clean audit; the National Shrine Commitment, an effort to raise, and make standard, the condition of the national cemeteries; and VetFran, a program for transitioning veterans to aid them in starting franchise businesses.  He was also, with David Chu, a founding co-chair of the VA-DoD Joint Executive Council to increase interdepartmental collaboration and sharing. Upon his departure, then-Secretary Anthony Principi stated, "Dr. Mackay brought to VA the discipline of the business world and the compassion of a man who cares deeply for America's veterans.  His legacy is a more-focused VA better able to meet the needs of veterans."

From 1993 to 1995, Mackay served as military assistant to then-Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Policy, Ashton Carter.  During this time, the office was re-organized to focus on cooperative de-nuclearization, execution of the Nunn-Lugar threat reduction program, nuclear weapons policy, and counter-proliferation.  The office also was the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) lead for the Nuclear Posture Review of 1994-95.

2016 Presidential Transition

On January 3, 2017, Mackay met with president-elect Donald Trump at Trump Tower in New York City to discuss the cabinet post of Secretary of Veterans Affairs.  Though Mackay described their meeting as a "good discussion" he was not selected for the post.  Other reporting, citing sources internal to the campaign, said he had refused the post as he was "reluctant to leave the private sector."
