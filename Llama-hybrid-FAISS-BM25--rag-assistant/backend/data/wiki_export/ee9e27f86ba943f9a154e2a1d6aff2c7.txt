Pantai Dalam is a perfect watershed between two groups of urban Malays: the affluent and the working class. The former live mainly in gleaming, whitewashed condominiums like the Andalusia Condominium in Pantai Hillpark, or in luxury bungalows in Kampung Pantai and Pantai Halt.

For the working class, the luxury apartments located further uphill are perhaps symbols of what one can aspire to. Most of them live in the low-cost apartments.

Most of the area's residents are:
 blue-collar workers living in flats that had been sold to them under the People's Housing Project when they were resettled from their squatter homes several years ago.
 students of the University of Malaya.
 police officers/personnels, mainly in Desa Aman 1 & 2.

Some squatters are still waiting to buy homes under this project, which was announced by Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi prior to the 12th Malaysian general election, 2008.

Pantai Dalam is well connected to the other parts of Klang Valley via the New Pantai Expressway and the Federal Highway.

Other divisions which are part of the Lembah Pantai constituency are Bangsar South, Bukit Aman, Bukit Persekutuan, KL Eco City, Mid Valley City and Perdana Botanical Gardens.
