Erocktica was an American rock band which described itself as An Anti-Censorship Erotic Theatrical Musical Free Expression Rock Extravaganza. Erocktika last performed in 2010.  The band broke up after front woman, Pink Snow, left New York City to attend law school in Massachusetts. Snow died of a heart attack in November 2012.

History
Erocktica was originally named Porn Rock when formed in New York City in 2000 by frontwoman Pink Snow. The band performed their first full live show in 2000 at the legendary East Village club CBGBs. From there they built a loyal following in the United States. They were contacted by the Bold Brothers interested in bringing the band to Europe though there was initial concern regarding the band name. The Bold Brothers, uncertain of the extent of the show, suggested the name be softened, fearing European audiences would expect a more graphic show from a band called Porn Rock than an American audience would. The band decided that they would rename the band to Erocktica for performances in Europe while they continued to tour the United States as Porn Rock. In the summer of 2002, with their newly recorded EP Pink Inside in hand, Erocktica played for the first time as a band in Europe. Brought over by the Bold Brothers to tour Holland, Erocktica performed for over 3,000 people at the Oerkracht Festival on their first European tour.

In the fall of 2003 the band went back to Europe on their second tour. Due to its success, Erocktica teamed up with PJB Enterprises based in Vasa, Finland. In December 2003 Erocktica returned to Finland and recorded their first full-length album, Porn Again, including the song Porn in America.

In January 2004 band decided to no longer tour the United States as Porn Rock by officially changing their name to Erocktica.

The band now was able to add fans from Helsinki to Milan and Barcelona to Amsterdam to its growing fan base, shocking crowds with their wild antics and pleasing with their entertaining brand of rock and roll. Erocktica headlined events in the United States such as Mondo Porno, an event held in major cities across the United States such as New York City, San Francisco, Boston, and Las Vegas. They also performed at the EAT-M Convention in Las Vegas, NXNE in Toronto, Canada and the legendary Coney Island Sideshow. In Europe they headlined erotic conventions for thousands of fans such as Extasia in Zurich, Switzerland and EROTS in Riga, Latvia.

The band also performed with numerous hard rock acts such as Warrant, L.A. Guns, Faster Pussycat, Poison’s C.C. Deville and Satanicide. Erocktica formed a partnership with the Azzardato Agency in the Netherlands. They released a DVD, as well as a new album Second Cuming in 2007.

On November 5, 2012, Pink Snow died of a heart attack.
