Plot 
Somaraju is a leading businessman and crime boss in Visakhapatnam. Mysamma is a close member of Somaraju and his right hand who handles his criminal deals in Hyderabad. Mahalakshmi is Somaraju's daughter, and he dearly loves her. Bunny alias Raja joins the same college as Mahalakshmi. He impresses her on the first day itself. Slowly, she falls in love with him. Somaraju, though reluctant initially, agrees to the marriage. Now, Raja has a condition that Somaraju should give his entire property to Raja as a dowry. The rest of the story explains why Raja asks for Somaraju's property.

Raja's birth father, a king, Ranga Rao Bhupathi Raja, is Mahalakshmi's maternal uncle. Bhupathi Raja was a great man with much land and property, as well as much regard from the government and other people. In the area where he lives, there is a shortage of water for farming. As a result Bhupathi Raja starts a rally to initiate the Polavaram Project. The rally becomes so widespread, that the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, decides to meet with Bhupathi Raja. Bhupathi Raja decides to give away all of his land, 4,000 acres, to the people who lose land when the project gets initiated. When Mahalakshmi is born, her mother asks Bhupathi Raja to perform the baby naming ceremony and such. On Bhupathi Raja's way there, however, Somaraju attacks him with the help of a bunch of rowdies. Somaraju fraudulently transfer Bhupathi Raju's property to himself. They pretty much kill Bhupathi Raja and leave him to die in the forest. However, Bhupathi Raja manages to live and perform Mahalakshmi's ceremony, but he dies minutes after without telling anyone what happened.

Raja learns of this when his so-called father, Rangaswamy, explains to him that he is really his godfather and not his father. While trying to save him, his godfather and godmother give up their own son to keep him alive. To regain his rightful property, Raja fights Mysamma and wins his girl.
