History 
Mashhad School of Medecine was founded by Dr. Hossein Samirad. Dr. Samirad founded the first four-year health college in the country in 1941 with the sole mission of educating students and dispatching them to rural areas where access to medical care was desperately needed. In collaboration with the Ministry of Health and several colleagues, Dr. Samirad transformed the four-year college of health into an officially recognized School of Medecine which opened its doors on November 23, 1949 by Dr. Zangeneh, the Minister of Culture. Dr. Samirad assumed the role of Director of the Medical School which started out with 61 students, one associate professor and seven tutors. In 1956, when the School of Arts opened, the two schools merged to form the University of Mashhad.

In 1965 Badri Teymourtash and Esmael Sondoozi founded the university's School of Dentistry.

In 1989, the faculties offering Medical Sciences' degrees across the country separated from the Ministry of Culture and Higher Education. New emerging medical universities have gone under management of Ministry of Health, Treatment and Medical Education. Thus the original University of Mashhad was divided into two independent universities: Ferdowsi University of Mashhad and Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.

Mashhad University of Medical Sciences now operates with 8 faculties, 32 hospitals, 179 rural and 147 urban health centers. It covers an enormous area stretching from the northeast to the central parts of the country, which makes it the largest university of medical sciences providing health care and treatment services.
With 597 teaching staff, 1645 MDs with different specialties, 138 dentists, 123 pharmacists and 25, 402 employees, the university provides health care and medical services to the area's large population, as well as to over 25 million tourists a year.
