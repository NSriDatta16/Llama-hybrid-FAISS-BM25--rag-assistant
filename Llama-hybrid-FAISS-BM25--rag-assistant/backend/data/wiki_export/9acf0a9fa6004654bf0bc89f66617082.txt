History
The temple in Portland was the church's first in Oregon, dedicated in 1989, by Gordon B. Hinckley; with the Medford Oregon Temple completed in 2000.  In 1989, more than 314,000 people attended the public open house held before the temple was dedicated by Gordon B. Hinckley.

University of New Mexico historian, Ferenc Morton Szasz, places the temple in a group of Post-World War II temples built in western American States, calling the group of Mormon temples "the most impressive religious structures of the entire western postwar building boom."

The temple, the church's 42nd operating structure, serves members of stakes in the Portland metropolitan area, other parts of Oregon and two cities in Washington.

In 2012, the church added a visitor's center which is open to the public daily from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., which, along with the temple's grounds, continues to be enjoyed by the surrounding community.  The visitor's center was formally dedicated by Gary E. Stevenson in June 2013.

In 2014, the temple celebrated the 25th year the temple has been in operation.

In 2020, the Portland Oregon Temple was closed in response to the coronavirus pandemic.
