Mesaieed (, also transliterated as Musay'id and Umm Sa'id) is an industrial city in Al Wakrah Municipality in the State of Qatar, approximately  south of Doha. It was one of the most important cities in Qatar during the 20th century, having gained in recognition as a prime industrial zone and tanking center for petroleum received from Dukhan.

Both Mesaieed and its industrial area are administered by a subdivision of QatarEnergy called "Mesaieed Industry City Management", which was established in 1996.

Etymology
According to The Centre for Geographic Information Systems of Qatar, the city derives its name from a plant known locally as "sead" which previously grew in bountiful quantities in the area.

History
Mesaieed was established in 1949 as a tanker terminal by QatarEnergy on a previously uninhabited site along the coast. It was chosen by the company because of its proximity to the working population in Doha and Al Wakrah and because of the depth of its waters. It was the only deepwater port in Qatar for more than 20 years.

Administration

It was administered wholly by QatarEnergy at the time of its inception. After QatarEnergy transferred its headquarters from Dukhan to Mesaieed in 1956, they undertook substantial development on workers' camps and facilities. The government had agreed to the company's request to allow it full jurisdiction over the area, and additionally, until the 1960s, the government had prioritized the development of Doha rather than its oil and natural gas industry. The rapid growth of oil and natural gas revenues in the 1960s and the accession of Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani in 1972 resulted in the government assuming a portion of control over the area.

In 1997, Mesaieed Municipality was formed from the areas of Mesaieed Industrial Area, Mesaieed and Shagra. It was dissolved in 2006 and reincorporated in the municipality of Al Wakrah.

When free elections of the Central Municipal Council first took place in Qatar during 1999, Mesaieed was designated the constituency seat of constituency no. 11. It would remain constituency seat in the next three consecutive elections until the fifth municipal elections in 2015 when it was merged into constituency no. 20. In the inaugural municipal elections in 1999, Mohammed Hamad Al Shawi Al Marri won the elections, receiving 48.8%, or 60, of the votes. Runner-up that year was Saud Al Awad Al Dosari, who was trailing with 41.5%, or 51, of the votes. Mansour Salem Al-Hajri was elected in the 2002 elections. For the third municipal elections in 2007, Saeed Ali Al-Marri was elected constituency representative. Al-Marri successfully retained his seat in the 2011 elections.
