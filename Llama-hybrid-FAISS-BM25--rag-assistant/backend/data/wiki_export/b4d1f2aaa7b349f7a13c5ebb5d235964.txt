Daniele Gaither is an American actress and comedian. Gaither is most notable for her membership in the recurring cast of comedians on sketch comedy series MADtv.

Early life
 
Daniele Gaither was born in St. Paul, Minnesota. As a child, Gaither was the class clown with a knack for storytelling and mimicry. Gaither is a class of '93 alumni of Northwestern University at Evanston, Illinois. In 1993, she moved to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career and attend the Groundlings School, where aspiring sketch and improv performers are given a systematic approach to learning improvisation and writing skills.

While she studied at the Groundlings school, Gaither was trained by Michael McDonald, before his tenure on MADtv. She completed the school and became a member of The Groundlings on Melrose Avenue in Hollywood. She left the group in 2006.

In her comedy, Gaither tries to "represent people that you see in the streets and know in everyday life," and sometimes uses her family experiences as material. She does impressions of people that she grew up admiring, such as Patti LaBelle, Marla Gibbs and Isabel Sanford, but also does impressions of current celebrities like Oprah Winfrey, Star Jones and Lil' Kim.

Gaither's first regular television appearance was on Hype in 2000. After her first big break, she appeared on NBC's The Rerun Show. Gaither has a recurring role as Chandra the hairdresser on Comedy Central's Reno 911!.

MADtv
Gaither first appeared in an episode of MADtv'''s second season, which featured rap star Ice-T. The skit depicted a mock debate between U.S. President Bill Clinton (played by Bryan Callen) and U.S. Senator Bob Dole (played by David Herman) who transformed himself into a "twisted" version of the 1970s blaxploitation icon Dolemite. Gaither played one of Dole's "Dolemite girls."

Gaither officially joined the cast of MADtv in 2003, seven years after her initial appearance on the series, as a featured performer for the ninth season. She became the second black female cast member in the show's history when she replaced Debra Wilson. Gaither was promoted to repertory performer status the following season. Some of her characters were only seen once on the discussion show Real Mother****ing Talk. Other notable characters included senior citizen Dilly Mae Jackson, Taco Hell boss Loretta, and Yvoone Criddle. Criddle is a middle-aged woman who openly acknowledges her own sociopathic behavior yet simultaneously appears to be oblivious to its perversity.

Gaither portrayed offbeat impersonations of celebrities, which included Lawanda Page, Condoleezza Rice, Eve, La La Vasquez, and Tyra Banks.

Gaither was released from MADtv by FOX in June 2006.
