Carbis Bay railway station () is on the St Ives Bay Line in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom and serves the village and beach of Carbis Bay, a community that only adopted this name after the arrival of the railway in 1877. Carbis Viaduct is situated on the St Ives (west) side of the station.

History
The station was opened by the Great Western Railway on 1 June 1877 on their new branch line from  to .  The railway needed a viaduct to cross the small valley that carried Carbis Water down to the Baripper Cove.  It was decided to build a station on the east side of the valley and call it Carbis Bay.  The location proved popular with visitors and the small farms around Wheal Providence mine expanded to become the village of Carbis Bay, named after the station. The station buildings were at the top of the shallow cutting in which the station is built.  Goods traffic was withdrawn in May 1956.
