Diane Shalet (February 23, 1935 â€“ February 23, 2006) was an American Broadway and television character actress.  She was perhaps best known for her recurring role as Ms. Hawkins in the drama Matlock. She made a guest appearance on The Monkees in the season-two episode, "The Fairy Tale", as the Fairy of the Locket (January 8, 1968).

Career
Shalet's Broadway credits include Tartuffe (1965), The Changeling (1964), But For Whom Charlie (1964), and After The Fall (1964). She also had roles in the touring companies of Bloomer Girl, Brigadoon, Connecticut Yankee, and Oklahoma.

For 14 years, Shalet taught at UCLA; she also was a founder of the Actors and Writers Lab in Manhattan. A life member of The Actors Studio, she was the author of the 1994 novel Grief in a Sunny Climate, () which a review in The New York Times described as a "deceptively silly story to disguise some serious lessons about sorrow and dependency." The book received first prize for fiction writing at the Santa Barbara Writers Conference.
