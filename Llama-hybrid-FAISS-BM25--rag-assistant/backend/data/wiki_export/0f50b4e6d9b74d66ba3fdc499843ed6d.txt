Bob Brozman (March 8, 1954 – April 23, 2013) was an American guitarist and ethnomusicologist.

Biography
Brozman was born to a Jewish family in Long Island, New York, and began playing the guitar when he was six.

He was an adjunct professor in the Department of Contemporary Music Studies at Macquarie University, in Sydney, Australia.

Brozman played National resonator instruments from the 1920s and 1930s. He also used Weissenborn-style hollow-neck acoustic steel guitars. Among his National instruments were a baritone version of the tricone guitar, which was designed in conjunction with him in the mid- to late 1990s. This instrument is part of National's range of products. Brozman's book The History and Artistry of National Resonator Instruments, a guide to National Guitars from 1927 to 1941, includes a list serial numbers and production dates.

Brozman was a member of R. Crumb & His Cheap Suit Serenaders from 1978 until his death in 2013.

Brozman committed suicide on April 23, 2013, amid allegations of child molestation. He was survived by a wife and a daughter from a previous marriage.
