Blue Swords () is an international figure skating competition organized by the Deutsche Eislauf-Union. It is usually held in Chemnitz, Saxony, Germany. Medals are awarded in the disciplines of men's singles, women's singles, pair skating, and ice dance. Champions of the event win the Blue Swords Trophy.

History 
Blue Swords began as a senior international competition in East Germany, and was held annually between 1961 and 1998. In 1985, it became a junior-level event. Since 1997, it is chosen in some years by the International Skating Union to be part of the ISU Junior Grand Prix circuit. These are the only years when the event is still held.

The German name for the event is "Pokal der Blauen Schwerter", referring to the blue swords trademark of Meissen porcelain. The Blue Sword Trophy is made of that porcelain.
