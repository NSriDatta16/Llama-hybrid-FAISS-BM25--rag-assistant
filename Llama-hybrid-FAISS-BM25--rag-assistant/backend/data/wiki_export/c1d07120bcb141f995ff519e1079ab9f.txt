The school serves grades 9–12 and has an enrollment of over 340 students for the 2017–2018 school year.  It is a part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cleveland.

History

Benedictine High School was founded in 1927 by the Benedictine monks of Cleveland. The first location of the school was at East 51st Street and Superior Avenue in Cleveland.  The original focus of the founders was to teach the sons of Slovak immigrants.  The school grew quickly and in 1929 it relocated to the site of St. Andrew Abbey at 10510 Buckeye Rd.  In 1940, with even further enrollment expansion, the school moved to its current location at 2900 Martin Luther King Jr. Drive.  The 1950s saw more enrollment growth for the school and increased academic recognition.  In the 1960s and 1970s, as the population in Cleveland shifted and the costs of Catholic education rose, school enrollment shrunk.  

The school developed a focused college preparatory program, which resulted in over 96% of students going on to college.  In the 1980s, to adjust to new circumstances, the school developed an extensive bus system.  The system allowed for young men from all over the Cleveland area to attend Benedictine.  The 1980s also brought about a capital campaign that sparked improvements in classrooms, and the building of a new church and bell tower. In 2009, the school launched a multimillion-dollar campaign to create a multi-purpose field. The campaign was launched in order to honor three notable individuals affiliated with Benedictine, Coach Augie Bossu, Coach Joe Rufus, and Bishop (Abbot) Roger Gries O.S.B. This field hosts many sporting events, including football, lacrosse, soccer, as well as serving as host to summer sports camps and CYO events.
