History

The history of St. Edmund's College, Shillong is intermingled with the brave efforts of the Germans and the Irish. The Christian Brothers were invited to Shillong in 1915 and St. Edmund's College was founded by the Irish Christian Brothers in 1916 as a higher secondary school and was recognised by the Cambridge University for examination up to Higher School Certificate level. Bro. Luke Aherne was the first director and Bro. M. S. O'Brian, the first sub-director. The college finally opened on 6 October 1916 by the Chief Commissioner of Assam and an educationist, sir Archdale Earle, with 32 boarders and 8 day scholars. The institution grew rapidly and by 1918 it had 89 boarders and 23 days scholars. In 1919, the number increased to 100 boarders and 16 day scholars. Out of them, 8 boys were sent, for the first time, for Higher Cambridge Local Certificate Examinations and 3 passed which was considered a remarkable achievement at that time. When the Government of India Act 1919 was passed, the college got affiliated with Calcutta University for Intermediate Arts (I.A.) and Intermediate Science (I.Sc.) courses in 1923. The first classes of the University section of St. Edmund's College opened in 1924. Bro. J.E. McCann was the first principal of the College (he was also the Principal of the School at this time). Bro. I.O' Leary was the first Principal of the College (separate from the School). From 1924 to 1936, St. Edmund's College was a junior college for intermediate Arts and Science. Bro. J.C. Roe conceived the idea of opening up university classes up to B.A. and B.T. (Bachelor of Teaching) standards and extension of these affiliation was granted on 14 September 1935. This was the first time when a non-government college in the Assam Province got affiliation up to B.A. and B.T. standards.

With the genesis of Gauhati University on 26 January 1948, the college got affiliated with it. In 1953, with the request of The DPI of Assam and the government, the college opened up courses for B.Sc. The science stream was thus started in August 1959. Later on the college came under NEHU in 1973 for which till today its associated with.

The commerce stream was introduced in 1997 and the college celebrated its Platinum Jubilee in 1999. In 2007, the Bachelor for Social Work (BSW) course was introduced. In 2010, the Higher Secondary section was segregated into a separate section within the college. In July, 2011, postgraduate courses for master's degree in social work were introduced.

O'Leary of the Congregation of Irish Christian Brothers as a post-graduate residence for students attending Bachelor of Teaching (B.T.) courses in the St. Edmund's College. After about 14 years to support the changed need of the students, there was qualitative change of the hostel. It was converted into an undergraduate residence for the students of St. Edmund's College in 1951.

The hostel provides a conducive environment for studies. In 1998, the Hostel was dedicated, as a mark of respect and in fond memory of Bro. J. N Foley a former principal of the College, during whose tenure the hostel was opened. The hostel superintendent has been supported in their care for the students by the respective Principals: Rev. Brothers E. X. Leonard, J. N. Foley, R. B. Vieyra,  M. G. Shannon, and W. D' Souza, A. F. Pinto, E. V. Miranda and L. D. Lobo.
