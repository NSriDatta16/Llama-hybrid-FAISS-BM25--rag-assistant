Nationality words link to articles with information on the nation's poetry or literature (for instance, Irish or France).

Events
 Mark Jarman and Robert McDowell start the small magazine The Reaper to promote narrative and formal poetry.
 Conjunctions literary magazine gets its start one afternoon late this year when founding editor Bradford Morrow sits in Beat poet Kenneth Rexroth's library in Santa Barbara, California talking over the idea of assembling a publication to celebrate James Laughlin, editor of New Directions Publishing. Poets solicited for the publication promise to send in work for future issues of the magazine, not realizing that no magazine is planned at this stage. Morrow then starts the magazine, financing the first few issues himself.
 Three new Hebrew literary journals appear this year in Israel: Mahbarot, edited by Y. Kenaz, Rosh a poetry journal edited by O. Bartena, and Hazerem hehadash, founded by a group of young ex-soldiers.
