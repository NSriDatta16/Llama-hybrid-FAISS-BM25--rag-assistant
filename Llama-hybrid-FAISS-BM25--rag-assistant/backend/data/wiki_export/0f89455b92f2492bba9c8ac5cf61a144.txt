Micobie (also: Maicobi and Cassava Hill) is a village in Potaro-Siparuni, Guyana, on the right bank of the Potaro River near Tumatumari.

History
The village was established in the 19th century. During the construction of the Denham Suspension Bridge, workers of the bridge bought their bread from the village, hence the name Cassava Hill. Most villagers used to live near Tumatumari, however due to the mining operations and the destruction of the beach, the villagers moved uphill in the 1970s.

In the Official Gazette of Guyana the village was misspelt Micobie which is the current name. The village of El Paso is a satellite of Micobie located down the hill.
