Synopsis

Moby Bone 
The Great Red Dragon interrupts Fone Bone's nightmare. The following day, Fone Bone asks him about the dream, and the Dragon hints that he entered the dream on purpose. Later, the Bone cousins are absorbed in rebuilding Grandma Ben's farm.

Double or Nothing 
While Phoney, Smiley, and Lucius continue to Barrelhaven through the rain, Phoney wagers that he can better operate Lucius' tavern than can Lucius himself. When they arrive at the bar, the taverngoers immediately attack Phoney Bone and Smiley Bone, but Lucius objects, on grounds that their fiscal debts have been paid and that they earlier humiliated themselves by belief in Phoney's confidence trick. He then orders the bet to commence.

Mending Fences 
When Gran'ma Ben apologizes to Bone for accusing him of causing trouble, Fone Bone shows her the map discovered in the initial book by Smiley, and she reveals that Thorn's parents were the monarchs of the realm throughout the generation-long war with the Rat Creatures, and that Thorn was moved from the palace during the "Nights of Lightning" (a series of surprise attacks by the Rat Creatures), to safety with the Dragons; but the escort party was betrayed by an accompanying nursemaid, and Thorn's parents killed. It is revealed that a dangerous, disembodied intelligence called the Lord of the Locusts has reawoken, and has the Hooded One under its command.

Dreams
Fone Bone attempts to comfort Thorn after Gran'ma Ben's revelations. At the tavern, Smiley Bone draws all the customers to the Bones' side of the bar by giving beer for no cost; but Phoney Bone stops him. The crowd are about to attack them, when Smiley Bone wishes that Fone Bone's dragon was there to protect them, and they demand what he means by this.

Things That Go Bump in the Night 
Tales of a dragon draw the townsfolk to Phoney's side of the Barrelhaven bar, and Phoney proclaims himself a dragon slayer. A hooded stranger wearing a pendant with a royal crest visits the Barrelhaven, bringing Lucius news that a huge army of Rat Creatures is approaching. Gran'ma Ben, hearing the news from Lucius via Ted the bug, and fearing for Thorn's safety, presents Thorn with her old sword and shield and insists on departure.
