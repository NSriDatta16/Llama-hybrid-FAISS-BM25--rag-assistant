New York State Route 265 (NY 265) is a  long state highway located in the western part of New York in the United States. NY 265 is a north–south route that roughly parallels the western parts of the Niagara River in Erie County and Niagara County. For much of its southern course, it is more frequently referred to by its longtime name, Military Road, which dates back to 1801 as a road to connect the city of Black Rock (now Buffalo) and Fort Niagara near Lake Ontario.

The route begins at an intersection with NY 266 (Niagara Street) and ramps for the Scajaquada Expressway (NY 198) in the city of Buffalo. The route runs through the Black Rock and Riverside sections of Buffalo, the village of Kenmore, the town and city of Tonawanda in Erie County; as well as North Tonawanda, Wheatfield, Niagara Falls and Lewiston. The route ends at a junction with NY 104 in Lewiston.

History

Military Road, the road that would precede NY 265, was authorized in 1801 to be constructed between Fort Niagara to the area of Black Rock (future Buffalo) to General James Wilkinson to facilitate transportation. Construction began in 1802 through the town of Tonawanda. The new road, which went through settlements such as Youngstown, Lewiston, Niagara Falls, and Buffalo, due to concern about the new inhabitants of the area. The fatigue parties at the nearby Fort Niagara helped construct the new road, which went through Tonawanda from 1802 to 1809, helping to create a settlement called "Mohawk". Although Military Road was designed to defend the Niagara Frontier, it contributed to major commercial development through Erie and Niagara counties. The road, however, was muddy for the next two decades, and it was not until 1832 when the route became passable for adequate transportation all year round.

During the 1890s, trolley service through the village of Kenmore was extended along Military Road, and commuters who lived in Kenmore could now easily access the Belt Line, which would take them to the city of Buffalo for work. A station was located along Military Road to permit this access.

The surviving portions of that route are those that still carry the name. NY 265, meanwhile, was assigned  to the portion of its modern alignment south of Tonawanda. That year, a stone was installed at the junction with NY 324 (Sheridan Drive) by the town of Tonawanda to honor the Military Road during the centennial of the city. It was extended northward along NY 384 and Military Road to its current northern terminus near Lewiston in the early 1940s.
