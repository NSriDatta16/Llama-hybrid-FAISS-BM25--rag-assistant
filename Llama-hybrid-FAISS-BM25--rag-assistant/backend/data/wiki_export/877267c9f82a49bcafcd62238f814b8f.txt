History

First stage 
On 15 October 1925 Presidium of Central Council of the Kazakhstan national economy ruled to open the department of Promyshlennyi (Industrial) Bank (Prombank).

During the Soviet period the bank underwent several reorganizations. In 1991 it was re-established as Turanbank, the Kazakh Republican Bank of the State commercial industrial and construction bank. In 1991 Turanbank was established on this basis. In 1992 the bank was renamed to Alem Bank Kazakhstan, the Bank of foreign economic activities of the Republic of Kazakhstan.

On 15 January 1997, Bank TuranAlem was privatised and set up a Closed Joint-Stock Company in accordance with the Decree of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan "On reorganization of the Kazakh joint-stock bank Turanbank and joint-stock bank AlemBank Kazakhstan". On 1 October 1998 Bank TuranAlem CJSC was renamed to Bank TuranAlem OJSC and then to Bank TuranAlem JSC.

In spring 2008 the bank underwent rebranding, which resulted in the change of the name, logo and corporate identity of the bank. After this the BTA Bank JSC name was no longer perceived as an acronym.

Events between 2009–2012

Fraud & Embezzlement
It was revealed in 2009 that the bank was defrauded of up to $6 billion of cash in one of the world's biggest cases of financial fraud. The banks former chairman Mukhtar Ablyazov is alleged to have perpetrated the fraud. Ablyazov has said that under his leadership BTA did conceal assets to protect them from being seized by the government. Private investigators have been used in an attempt to recover some of the funds, who in October 2010 found documents and disc drives relating to the bank in a self-storage facility in north London. A found documents and disc drives relating to the bank in a self-storage facility in north Londonthrough which BTA had transacted.

Bankruptcy

In consideration, the creditors received $1,618 cash and $750 mln. New Notes.

BTA Bank also entered into a revised Revocable Committed Trade Finance Facility (RCTFF) with liabilities amounting to around $348 mln. as of the restructuring date. Samruk-Kazyna Fund extended $1.592 bln. loan to BTA Bank JSC subordinated to the New Notes and RCTFF.
