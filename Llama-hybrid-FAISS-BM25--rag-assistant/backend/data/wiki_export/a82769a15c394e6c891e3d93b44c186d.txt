St. Peter's is an independent brewery founded in 1996 by John Murphy in former agricultural buildings adjacent to St. Peterâ€™s Hall in St Peter, South Elmham, near Bungay in the English county of Suffolk.

The brewery produces cask ales, but is best known for its cold-filtered bottled beers. The oval shape of its signatory 500 ml bottle is based on an 18th-century gin bottle from Gibbstown, by the Delaware River near Philadelphia, but a round version is also common.

The brewery also owns The Jerusalem Tavern, a pub in Clerkenwell, London.

The beers 

The brewery produces around twelve regular beers plus another six seasonal. St Peter's is known for its organic beers. A gluten free beer, G-Free TM was launched late in 2007 and is approved and licensed by Coeliac UK.
