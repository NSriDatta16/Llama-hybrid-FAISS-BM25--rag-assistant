Nineveh is a hamlet with approximately fifty  homes on the banks of the Susquehanna River in Broome County, New York, United States. It is part of the Town of Colesville,  Binghamton metropolitan area in eastern Broome County.  Nineveh is located on the USGS Afton quadrangle at an elevation of about 960 feet.   Nineveh takes its name from ancient Nineveh, the most important city on the Tigris River in the ancient kingdom of Assyria (now Iraq).

Nineveh is located along the tracks of the Delaware and Hudson Railway and has a distinct trestle located there.

New York State Route 7 is the main road through the hamlet, with several small businesses serving the residents' basic needs located along it.

In June 2006, widespread flooding along the river basin inundated many homes along the banks of the river.
