Porva has an ancient history and is mentioned among about 40 other villages and cities in the founding document of Hungary. This document can still be seen in the library of the Pannonhalma Archabbey.

Between 1782 and 1784 the current church was erected over the ruins of the palos monastery. The building was built in a gothic baroque style. There is very little left from its rich history. The ruins were buried and the cultural treasures were stolen or moved to other places.  The old palos monastery was already deserted during the beginning of the Turkish occupation.

The churches main altar was built by Roskovitz Ignác the floor is covered with kelheim stones. The building is in gothic style with baroque sections outside and inside. On the face of the church two marble memorials were erected for the memory of the first and Second World War’s casualties from the village.

After World War II however the Russian invaders took possession of the vicarage to establish their regional headquarters. The Facade of the vicarage was destroyed as a Russian repercussion for the Hungarian revolution of 1956
