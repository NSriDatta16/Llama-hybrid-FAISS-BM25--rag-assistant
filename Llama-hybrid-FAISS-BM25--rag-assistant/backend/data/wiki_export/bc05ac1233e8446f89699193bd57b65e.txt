The Royal Philatelic Society London (RPSL) is the oldest philatelic society in the world. It was founded on 10 April 1869 as The Philatelic Society, London. The society runs a  postal museum, the Spear Museum of Philatelic History, at its headquarters in the City of London.

History 

The society was founded on 10 April 1869 at a meeting at 93 Great Russell Street in the rooms of the stamp dealer J.C. Wilson. The first officers elected were the president, Sir Daniel Cooper, the vice-president, Frederick A. Philbrick, and the secretary, W. Dudley Atlee. The committee comprised Edward Loines Pemberton, Charles W. Viner, Thomas F. Erskine, Joseph Speranza, and W. E. Hayns.

Permission to use the prefix "Royal" was granted by King Edward VII in November 1906.

Prince George, the Duke of York (future George V), was an enthusiastic stamp collector. He served as honorary vice-president of the society from 1893 to 1910. His father, King Edward VII, had a large stamp collection that he gave to Prince George, which became known as the Royal Philatelic Collection. When he was crowned King, George V stayed with the Society as its royal patron. His second son, George VI, continued to expand the royal collection.

The former patron was Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. Every September, at a special meeting of the society, part of the Royal Philatelic Collection is displayed by its keeper. Queen Elizabeth was not known to be a philatelist herself, but the royal family has maintained and added to the collection passed down by Edward VII.

The organisation celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2019. The anniversary was marked by a visit from its patron, Queen Elizabeth II, on 26 November 2019 when she opened the Society's new Headquarters in Abchurch Lane, London EC4.
