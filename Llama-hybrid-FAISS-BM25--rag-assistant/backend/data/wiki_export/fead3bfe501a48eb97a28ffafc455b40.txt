The 1998 Memorial Cup (branded as the 1998 Chrysler Memorial Cup for sponsorship reasons)  occurred May 9â€“17 at the Spokane Veterans Memorial Arena in Spokane, Washington. It was the 80th annual Memorial Cup competition and determined the major junior ice hockey champion of the Canadian Hockey League (CHL).  Participating teams were the host Spokane Chiefs and the winners of the Ontario Hockey League, Quebec Major Junior Hockey League and Western Hockey League which were the Guelph Storm, Val-d'Or Foreurs and Portland Winter Hawks.  The Winter Hawks won their second Memorial Cup defeating the Storm from a goal in overtime by Bobby Russell. , only Portland (twice) and Spokane (twice) have taken the Cup to the US.

The tournament set a new Memorial Cup attendance record.  However, that record was broken the following year in Ottawa.
