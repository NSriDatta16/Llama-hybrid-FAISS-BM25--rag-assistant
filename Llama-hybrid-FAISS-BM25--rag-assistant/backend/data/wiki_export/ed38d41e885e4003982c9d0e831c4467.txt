Weewanie Hot Springs Provincial Park is a provincial park in British Columbia, Canada, located on the east bank of Devastation Channel opposite the north end of Hawkesbury Island, in the Gardner Canal region south of Kitimat on the province's North Coast.

History

Baths were built at these hot springs by A.A. Creed, Commodore of the Kitimat Yacht Club, for the benefit of travellers, and a preserve set aside by the provincial government.  The site was created as a Class A provincial park in May 2004.

Name origin

The name derives from that of nearby Weewanie Creek, which is to the south of the hotsprings.  "Weewanie" is an adaptation of a Haisla word meaning "many creeks".  The spring's traditional uses by the Haisla are hygienic, medicinal, ritual and recreational.

Access
The park and hot springs are located approximately  south of Kitimat.  Access is by boat only.
