Overview
The World Snooker Championship is a professional tournament and the official world championship of the game of snooker. Founded in the late 19th century by British Army soldiers stationed in India, the sport was popular in the British Isles. However, in the modern era it has become increasingly popular worldwide, especially in East and Southeast Asian nations such as China, Hong Kong and Thailand.

This championship featured nine professional players competing in one-on-one snooker matches in a round-robin format, from which four players qualified to a single elimination format. Each match is played over a predetermined number of  and . Joe Davis won the first World Championship in 1927, the final match being held in Camkin's Hall, Birmingham, England.

Format 
The championship was held from 28 September to 7 November 1970 at several locations across Australia. This was the first time the championship was held outside the United Kingdom aside from two challenge matches in 1965, and it would be later hosted in Australia again in 1975. The initial stage was a round robin in which the matches were of 37 frames, played across three days, and each competitor played four of the other eight competitors. The number of frames needed to win a match increased at the semi-finals stage. The semi-finals were scheduled to be the best-of-49 and the final as the best-of-73 frames.

Knockout stage
The remaining four players contested a knockout round. The basis on which the semi-final draw was organised is not known. The 22 October edition of The Sydney Morning Herald reports that Reardon would play Spencer in the second semi-final. At the time Reardon and Spencer still had to play each other and Charlton, Owen and Simpson also had one match to play. So the final order of the group was still undecided. Snooker historian Clive Everton has speculated that the draw was changed "behind the scenes ... perhaps to ensure an Australian finalist."
