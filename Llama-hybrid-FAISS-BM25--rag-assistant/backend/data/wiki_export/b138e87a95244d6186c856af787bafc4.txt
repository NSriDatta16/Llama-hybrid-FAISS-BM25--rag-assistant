History 
In the 2011 general elections, the Jurong Central and Hong Kah division's population carved to form the new Jurong Spring division, while Yuhua became a SMC in return. In 2015, Bukit Batok was carved as a SMC while Clementi, a division under the West Coast GRC, was absorbed to the ward to maintain its five seats.

The constituency was first contested in the 2001 general election with the People's Action Party against the Singapore Democratic Party. The ward won a walkover in 2006 before facing another contest with the National Solidarity Party (2011), Singaporeans First (2015) and Red Dot United (2020); however, this GRC has always been held by the People's Action Party since its creation in 2001.

The ward was first led by the Minister Lim Boon Heng until his retirement from politics in 2011. After his retirement, Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam and Minister Desmond Lee Ti-Seng have assumed leadership for Jurong GRC, but Lee was transferred to West Coast GRC in 2020 together with three term MP Ang Wei Neng.

Ivan Lim was introduced on 24 June 2020 for the General Elections but withdrew 3 days later following allegations of his past behaviour. He was replaced by Xie Yao Quan.

Members of Parliament

Ong died on 14 July 2008 due to a heart failure. However, no by-election was called since it was a Group Representation Constituency (GRC), and the workload for the Bukit Batok division was given to Halimah Yacob.

On 8 June 2023, Tharman announced his scheduled resignation on 7 July 2023 from all his positions in the government and as a member of the People's Action Party (PAP) to run for the 2023 presidential election. However, no by-election was called since it was a Group Representation Constituency (GRC), and the workload for the Taman Jurong division was distributed among the other MPs in Jurong GRC.
