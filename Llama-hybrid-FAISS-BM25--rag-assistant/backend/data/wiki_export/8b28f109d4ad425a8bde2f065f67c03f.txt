History
When the American Civil War started, the federal government appropriated 18 cemetery lots from what was then Danville City Cemetery. The small lot was designated a National Cemetery in 1862. It is divided into six sections, five of which are for the interment of soldiers, and the other for civilians. The original interments were Union soldiers who died while under care in military hospitals in Danville. A Confederate lot in the city cemetery with 66 interments is next to Danville National Cemetery.

During the early months of 1863, Confederate detachments infiltrated among the Union garrisons trying to protect Kentucky. On March 24, 1863, the city of Danville was captured by Confederate General John Pegram and his cavalry brigade, despite stout resistance from Colonel Frank Lane Wolford, commander of the First Kentucky Union Cavalry. Danville was also the site of several hospitals which cared for the Civil War wounded.
