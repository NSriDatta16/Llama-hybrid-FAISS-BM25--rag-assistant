Wheelock's Latin (originally titled Latin and later Latin: An Introductory Course Based on Ancient Authors) is a comprehensive beginning Latin textbook. Chapters introduce related grammatical topics and assume little or no prior knowledge of Latin grammar or language. Each chapter has a collection of translation exercises created specifically for the book, most drawn directly from ancient sources. Those from Roman authors (Sententiae Antiquae—lit., "ancient sentences" or "ancient thoughts") and the reading passages that follow may be either direct quotations or adapted paraphrases of the originals.  Interspersed in the text are introductory remarks on Ancient Roman culture.  At the end of each chapter is a section called "Latina Est Gaudium — Et Utilis!", which means "Latin Is Fun — And Useful!"  This section introduces phrases that can be used in conversation (such as "Quid agis hodie?", meaning "How are you today?"), and in particular comments on English words and their relation to Latin. Originally published in 1956 in the Barnes & Noble College Outline Series, the textbook is currently in its seventh edition. The 6th edition has been translated into Korean (2005), with a Korean translation of the 7th edition pending; the 7th edition has been translated into Chinese (2017).

The most recent edition includes a foreword, preface, comments on the revised edition, maps, and numerous black and white photographs. It also provides help with pronunciation and information about the Roman authors presented in the chapter readings.
