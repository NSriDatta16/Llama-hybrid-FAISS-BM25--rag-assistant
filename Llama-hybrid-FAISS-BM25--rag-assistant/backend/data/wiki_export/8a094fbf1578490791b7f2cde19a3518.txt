Éric Gaudibert (21 December 1936 – 28 June 2012) was a Swiss composer.

Career
Gaudibert was born in Vevey. He studied piano and composition at the Conservatory of Lausanne, particularly with Denise Bidal and Hans Haug, and later in Paris in the École Normale de Musique with Alfred Cortot, Henri Dutilleux and Nadia Boulanger. He worked notably in the French "avant-garde" in 1972–1974 in the Maison de la Culture of Orléans.

A former professor in both Geneva (from 1975) and Neuchâtel, he pursued a tradition led by Béla Bartók, Arnold Schoenberg and Olivier Messiaen, and over time developed a personal style embracing electronics and the media, poetry, visual art (specifically that by Paul Klee), and literature in a specific spatial, timbral and philosophical inquiry on music.

He lived in Confignon, Switzerland, where he died aged 75.

 Gaudibert's works are largely published by Swiss Music Editions and Éditions Papillon.
