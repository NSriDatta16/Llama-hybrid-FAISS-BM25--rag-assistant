James Alexander Robertson Menzies (21 February 1821 â€“ 18 August 1888) was the first superintendent of the Southland Province in New Zealand from 3 August 1861 to November 1864, during its breakaway from Otago Province (1861 to 1870). He continued serving on the Provincial Council after his superintendency ended.

During Menzies' tenure as superintendent, two railways projects were undertaken, a railway to link Invercargill to the port at Bluff and a wooden railway to Winton. The former is now known as the Bluff Branch, while as the wooden rails were unsatisfactory they were replaces with "standard" steel rails, and the line was extended to ultimately form the Kingston Branch. Menzies, now in disagreement with his colleagues, retired to his 8000-acre estate near Wyndham.

Menzies served on the Legislative Council for 30 years, from 1858 until his death in 1888, and promoted the interests of Southland.
