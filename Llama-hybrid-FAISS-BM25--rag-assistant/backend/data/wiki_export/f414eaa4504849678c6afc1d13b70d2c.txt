Van Conner (March 17, 1967 â€“ January 17, 2023) was an American rock musician, best known as the bassist for Screaming Trees.

Career 
As a bass player in high school, Conner formed the band Explosive Generation with his brother Gary Lee Conner and Mark Pickerel. That band later evolved into Screaming Trees with the addition of singer Mark Lanegan in 1985. The band moved from their native Ellensburg, Washington to Seattle in the late 1980s to join that city's burgeoning alternative rock scene. Conner played on seven studio albums with Screaming Trees until the band split in 2000.

While he was with Screaming Trees, Conner formed the side project Solomon Grundy, in which he performed lead vocals and guitar. That band released an album in 1990, and during that period Conner also joined a live lineup of Dinosaur Jr. He later formed another side project called Gardener, which released an album in 1999. After the breakup of Screaming Trees, Conner worked as a session musician and had formed several additional alternative rock bands, including VALIS and Musk Ox.

Illness and death
In December of 2021, Conner fell into a comatose state after suffering complications from emergency stomach surgery. While hospitalized, Conner also contracted an infection of COVID-19, severely worsening his condition. Conner would continue to struggle with respiratory and mobility issues for the rest of his life.

Conner died from pneumonia on January 17, 2023, at the age of 55.
