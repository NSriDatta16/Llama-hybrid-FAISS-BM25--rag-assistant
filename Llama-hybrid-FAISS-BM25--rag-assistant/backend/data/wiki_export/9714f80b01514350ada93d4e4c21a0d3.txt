Background
The album got its title from the fact that some of the tracks were taken from EPs that the band released prior to the release of the full length. These 7" include Neurotic and Argyle. The song title "Lay 'Em Down And Smack 'Em, Yack 'Em" comes from the jive conversation in the movie Airplane!.
