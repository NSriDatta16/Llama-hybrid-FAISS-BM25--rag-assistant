History  
The Doctor of Health Administration was first introduced in the U.S. in the late 1990s at the Medical University of South Carolina as an advanced professional doctorate in health leadership. Prior to this the only D.H.A. degrees awarded were in Canada and Europe. The American version of this doctoral degree focuses on advanced professional knowledge and applied research in health administration, policy, and leadership. New programs have been instituted at other universities providing substantial amounts of online coursework. Most D.H.A. students are working health professionals who seek doctoral education. Admission to the three year degree typically requires two years of coursework beyond the master's degree (i.e. M.H.A., M.P.A., M.S.A., or M.P.H.) and an applied or theoretical dissertation to be completed in the third year.

Program structure 
Most D.H.A. programs require about 70 credit hours beyond the master's degree. Students are expected to take a number of core classes, electives, research/method classes, and dissertation credits. Candidates typically work with a committee and advisors throughout the process and the dissertation eventually requires an oral defense to the student's committee. Curricula may be offered on a full-time or part-time basis. The normal duration of a doctorate should correspond to 3–5 years of full-time graduate study or 7–10 years of sustained part-time graduate study.
