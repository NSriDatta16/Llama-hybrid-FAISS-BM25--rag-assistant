From the 1930s the town was known as Barbate de Franco because General Francisco Franco spent leisure time there. It ceased to be called this in 1998 after a decree was passed by the Junta de Andalucia.

Barbate has a long history of fishing stretching back to Roman times when fish salting was at its peak. The town has a central square, "Plaza de la Inmaculada", flanked by the Town Hall and the Church of St. Paul. Barbate is popular with Spanish tourists in the summer, but attracts few foreign visitors.
