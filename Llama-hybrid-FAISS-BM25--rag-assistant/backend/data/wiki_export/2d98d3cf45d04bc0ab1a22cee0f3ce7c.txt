"Like a Hurricane" is a song written by Neil Young in 1975 and first released on the album American Stars 'n Bars in 1977.

History
Young wrote the song in July 1975 at a time when he was unable to sing because of an operation on his vocal cords. An edited version of "Like a Hurricane" was released as a single on August 8, 1977, with "Hold Back the Tears" as B-side. Driven by Young's trademark fierce guitars, the song became a landmark of the 'electric side' of his concerts. The song has been played on nearly every tour Young has done since its release. It has also appeared on the compilations Decade and Greatest Hits and on the live albums Live Rust, Weld, Unplugged (this rendition is played almost entirely on a pump organ) and Way Down in the Rust Bucket.

Composition
The bridge into the chorus of "Like a Hurricane" was inspired by Del Shannon's 1961 song "Runaway".

Reception
Cash Box said that "the melodies are carried by Young's voice and guitar, all brought into focus against a distant landscape of multi-layered string effects."
