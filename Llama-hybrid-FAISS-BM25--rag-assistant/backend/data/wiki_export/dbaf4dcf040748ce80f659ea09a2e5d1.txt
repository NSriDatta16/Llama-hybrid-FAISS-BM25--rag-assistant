Details
The HW 45 is a spring powered, single-shot, air pistol with spring compression being achieved via an overarm cocking lever incorporating the barrel. The HW 45 features an adjustable two-stage trigger, fibre optic open sights and a grooved 11mm dovetail rail for mounting an optical sight.  The pistol has a manual safety catch and comes in four different levels of finish with all but the basic HW45 having contoured wood laminate grips.  Its design was based on the Colt Government, M1911 and the rear hammer acts as the release, for the overarm cocking lever

The .177 (4.5 mm) pistol has two power levels: low power is  and full power , dependent on weight of pellet.  The different power levels are created by cocking the gun to different lock points.
