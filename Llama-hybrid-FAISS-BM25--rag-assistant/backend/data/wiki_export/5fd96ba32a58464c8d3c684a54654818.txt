Señor Frog's (Mister Frog) is a Mexican-themed franchised bar and grill in tourist destinations throughout Mexico, the Caribbean, Tenerife, and the United States.

In Mexico and the western Caribbean, about 75% of its revenues come from alcoholic beverage sales. In Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, however, the company has been unable to promote drinking as successfully; food outsells liquor there by a slight margin.

The parent company, Grupo Anderson's, is headquartered in Cancun, Mexico.

History 
Señor Frog's was founded in 1971 by Chuy Juarez and Carlos Anderson in Mazatlán, Mexico. The goal was to create a lively and casual dining atmosphere that would appeal to both locals and tourists.

Señor Frog's is owned by Grupo Anderson's, founded in 1963, who claims there are more than 50 restaurants makes it Mexico's largest restaurateur. In addition to Señor Frog's, Grupo Anderson's owns the Carlos'n Charlie's chain.
