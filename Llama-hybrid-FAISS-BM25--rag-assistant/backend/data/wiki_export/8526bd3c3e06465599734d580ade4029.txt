Located immediately across the highway from Shannon Falls is a privately operated campground and restaurant, plus the entrance to the Darrell Bay ferry terminal for Woodfibre (Darrell Bay was formerly named Shannon Bay). The Sea to Sky Gondola adjoins the park. The gondola line was deliberately cut in 2019 and again in 2020 after repairs.

The falls and adjoining woods are commonly used in television and film production.
