The committee has undertaken numerous studies over the years on topics related to information sharing, national security and privacy such as Information Sharing with the United States and Privacy in Canadian Airports. The committee has also reviewed various pieces of legislation such as the Privacy Act and created corresponding reports with recommendations and amendments.
