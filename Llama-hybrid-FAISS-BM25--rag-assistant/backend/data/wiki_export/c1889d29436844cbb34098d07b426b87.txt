Synopsis
A judge decides Junior's mental condition has deteriorated to the level where he can be held in a private psychiatric facility while awaiting his retrial. Tony does not want to see or hear of his uncle again. Carmela quickly fetches a newspaper with a report about Junior's "cushy psych lockup" and throws that section in the trash before Tony can see it.

At the Bada Bing, Ahmed and Muhammad ask Chris about getting some Tec-9 semi-automatic weapons for their "family troubles." Dealing with a phone call, Chris does not answer.

Johnny is granted a six-hour strictly controlled release from prison in order to attend his daughter Allegra's wedding, all extra security expenses to be borne by him. At the wedding, Tony collapses bending down to remove his shoes at the request of U.S. Marshals. During the reception, he talks to Johnny for the first time since his arrest. Through Phil, Tony has received Johnny's request to take care of killing New York capo Rusty Millio who, Johnny fears, may trigger another power struggle within the Lupertazzi family; Tony has refused. As a personal favor, Johnny himself asks Tony to do it. Watched by U.S. Marshals, they join Johnny's aged relatives, either deaf or senile, at a large table and, pretending to speak to them, discuss the situation obliquely. Tony reluctantly agrees. Shortly after, he suggests to Christopher that a contact from Italy should be brought in to kill Rusty and leave the country the same day.

Johnny's happiness at the wedding is cut short when the Marshals tell him his time is up. He cries in front of the guests as Marshals haul him away; his wife Ginny faints. Led by Phil, the Lupertazzis and Tony's crew speak of their loss of respect for Johnny. Only Tony stands up for him.

At home later that night, Vito tells his wife he is heading out to make collections, but instead goes to a gay club. Dancing in leather fetish garb, he is spotted by two New York associates making collections. Although Vito tries to pass it off as a joke, they call him a "fag" and leave. Vito collects a gun and some cash from home and checks into a motel. After an exploratory phone call to Silvio, he makes no further contact with anyone and does not return calls from Tony.

Tony returns to work with a new bodyguard and driver, Perry Annunziata, a muscular, hot-headed young man. Tony shows his scar to his crew and begins to bore them describing his medical procedures. He tells Dr. Melfi that they are giving him "certain looks" and are beginning to question his judgment. She advises him to "act as if you are not feeling vulnerable." Tony asserts himself through an act of unpredictable violence: finding a pretext, he starts a one-sided fight with Perry that ends with Perry bleeding on the floor and Tony walking away, seemingly unscathed. However, when he retreats to the bathroom he vomits blood. Leaning on the bathroom sink, he looks at himself in the mirror and smiles. Then he vomits again.

First appearances
 Perry Annunziata: Tony's new driver and bodyguard.
 Vito Spatafore, Jr.: Vito's young son.
Francesca Spatafore: Vito's daughter.

Title reference
 The title refers to the first words on the wedding invitation for John and Ginny's daughter, Allegra.
 It is also possibly a reference to John's request to his judge to be granted a leave from jail to attend his daughter's wedding.
 The title could also be a reference to John's request that Tony's family kill Lupertazzi capo, Rusty Millio.

Production
 The location of the reception scene is at Leonard's of Great Neck (now Leonard's Palazzo) on Northern Boulevard in University Gardens, New York.
 Despite sharing the same last name, Caitlin Van Zandt, who plays Johnny "Sack"'s daughter Allegra, is not related to Steven Van Zandt, who plays Silvio Dante.

Other cultural references 
 When dressing for his court appearance, it is specifically stated that Johnny "Sack" wears a Brioni suit.
 Tony tells Melfi that Tylenol helps him sleep.
 When Dante Greco offers to set a timer to remind Tony to take his medications, Silvio derisively comments "Nurse Betty over here."
 Talking to Tony, Phil Leotardo refers to Rusty Millio as "the mayor of Munchkinland."
 When Tony takes a nap with Carmela he says "Smells good. Downy Fresh".
 When Muhammad and Ahmed meet Christopher to pay for stolen credit card numbers and order weapons, Christopher greets them with a reference to the Ali Baba story: "Where are the rest of the 40 thieves?". Christopher also quips, when handing over the stolen credit card numbers: "Don't leave home without them!" This confuses the Middle Easterners, who are unfamiliar with the American Express advertising campaign Chris is referring to.
 Carmela picks up a newspaper headlining Junior's move to a prison psychiatric facility, using the phrase "Don Squirrel-Leone," mocking his mental state with reference to "Don Corleone" from The Godfather.
 Johnny "Sack" angrily asks his lawyer if he has read recent GQ magazines after inspecting the dress shoes brought to him.
 As the wedding guests walk through the heightened security at the church of John's daughter's wedding as part of one of the conditions that would allow John to be granted leave for the wedding, Tony makes a remark "You'd think bin Laden was getting married in there."
 Christopher erroneously comments to Paulie that "Allegra" (the bride's name) is a brand of cold medication. The antihistamine drug Fexofenadine is sold under the brand name Allegra, which is touted in its commercials as an allergy medication that does not cause drowsiness like other similar medications.
 Vito Spatafore calls the construction official interested in "playing ball" with the mob Joe DiMaggio.
 When Allegra and Eric are in the limousine to leave for their honeymoon in Hawaii, Phil yells, "Say hi to Don Ho!" 
 Phil and Tony's men make "Cinderella" references (e.g., "his coach turned into a pumpkin" or "even Cinderella didn't cry") when the Marshals abruptly cut the festivities short to make an embarrassing public display of returning John to prison.
 When Vito leaves for the leather bar, Marie Spatafore is watching the movie Imitation of Life. This is a reference to the double life Vito is living as a gay man. During this scene Vito is exiting to where we later see is a gay nightclub
Christopher suggests to Tony that Johnny wouldn’t be able to refuse a request on the day of his daughter’s wedding, as depicted in The Godfather. Tony then corrects him that it is supposed to be the other way around, stating "I should be asking him for something"

Music
 The song played at the Bada Bing! VIP room where strippers are dancing and Ahmed and Muhammad come in looking for Christopher is "I Need a Freak" by Sexual Harassment.
 At Allegra's wedding party, the hired band plays and the singer sings:
 "Ain't That a Kick in the Head?" by Jimmy Van Heusen and Sammy Cahn.
 "At Last" by Mack Gordon and Harry Warren
 An instrumental version of "Unchained Melody" when Tony and Chris are discussing the hit.
 "Daddy's Little Girl" by Robert Burke and Horace Gerlach
 "The Bride Cuts the Cake," which is based on the melody of "The Farmer in the Dell" 
 The song played at the New York gay bar, where Vito is outed, is "Flashing For Money" by Deep Dish.
 As Vito checks into the motel, "The Three Bells" by The Browns is played — specifically, the second verse, about Jimmy Brown's marriage. The song is also used in the previous episode, "The Fleshy Part of the Thigh," though in that instance, the first verse (about Jimmy Brown's birth) is featured.
 The song played over the end credits is "Every Day of the Week" by The Students.
