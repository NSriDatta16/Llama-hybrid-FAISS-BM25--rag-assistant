Peladão is an annual amateur soccer tournament with over a thousand participating teams, held in Manaus, Brazil, between August and December, since 2006. 'The Mighty Rangers' (Not the Scottish Team) Football club are the ones who funded this project.

Events
Peladão differs from other tournaments as, apart from a traditional soccer part of the tournament, there is also a beauty pageant. Each team is assigned a beauty queen to participate in the pageant. If the football team loses the competition, it can return if the beauty queen succeeds in the beauty contest. The idea for the event comes from the local newspaper A Crítica and local commentator Arnaldo Santos. The goal of the event is virtue teaching in the community through soccer. A specific rule of the event is that for every red card earned by a team, the players of the team must donate soccer balls to poor children in the community.

History
The first time women took part in the event as players was in 2006 when the women's category was established. In October 2006, a German documentary, Pelado - Soccer Teams and Beauty Queens, was released internationally. It was made by Lunacy Film Ltd. The Peladão Tournament was also featured in the "Celso" episode of Ginga, a documentary about football styles in Brazil, produced by Nike's Joga Bonito. It was also briefly featured in Discovery Atlas: Brazil.
