The Bicaz Gorge (Romanian: Cheile Bicazului, Hungarian: Békás-szoros) is a gorge in Romania, located in the north-east part of the country, in Neamț and Harghita counties. It is situated in the central part of the  Hășmaș Mountains, and it is part of the Cheile Bicazului-Hășmaș National Park.

The gorge was excised by the waters of the river Bicaz and it serves as a passageway between the Romanian provinces of Moldova and Transylvania.

It is a noted location to see the wallcreeper, an uncommon cliff-dwelling bird.

National road  passes through the gorge. The road along the  of ravines, often in serpentines with rock on one side and a sheer drop on the other, is one of the most spectacular drives in the country. Also within the gorge is Lacul Roșu (the Red Lake), with its traditional cabins, hotels, and its famous lake (situated at  altitude) caused by a landslide in the 19th century.

Cheile Bicazului is one of the main rock climbing sites in Romania.
