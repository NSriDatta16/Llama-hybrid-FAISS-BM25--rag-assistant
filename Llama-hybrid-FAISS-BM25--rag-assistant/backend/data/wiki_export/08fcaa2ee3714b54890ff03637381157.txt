Geography 
Located just outside the city centre, (beyond the district of Ulus as far as the large Altınpark), this hillside has long been home to the workers in the city of Ankara but Altındağ remains one of the poorer quarters of the capital. The hillside is covered with illegally built gecekondu housing, home to low-income families. Among the housing there are some municipal buildings, public housing, state housing for civil servants and many car-repair workshops.

The ancient Ankara Castle is in Altındağ and there has recently been investment in restoration work. With this architectural heritage, Altındağ is a member of the Norwich-based European Association of Historic Towns and Regions.

History 
Altındağ includes parts of the historic city of Ankara, as well as the first National Assembly in which Republic of Turkey was founded is in Ulus.

Altındağ was the location of one of the first gecekondu developments in Turkey, when in the 1950s and 1960s people illegally built small, one-bedroom houses on small plots of land; then in the 1970s and 1980s these plots of land were made legal through amnesty legislation, and eventually sold to developers who replaced these shacks with larger, multi-story apartment buildings.

Prominent neighbourhoods 
 Aydınlıkevler - a quiet residential neighbourhood of civil servants and other members of Ankara's middle class; centred on an avenue of schools, banks and shops; contains the SSK teaching hospital, a military officers housing compound, the headquarters of Türk Telekom, Ankara University's faculty of agriculture and Altınpark.
 Hacı Bayram - home to one of the oldest mosques in Ankara, the mosque and tomb of the 14th-century Ankara-born mystic Haci Bayram Veli, famous for prophesying the conquest of Constantinople, and then founding his own Sufi sect. The district has recently been renovated by urban planner Raci Bademli.
