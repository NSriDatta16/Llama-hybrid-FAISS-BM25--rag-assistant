Anderson W. Clark Magnet High School is a high school located in Glendale, California, United States. The school is managed as a part of the Glendale Unified School District.

History
The school was conceived from the recommendations of the "Vision of the Future" Task Force, created by the Glendale Unified School District to investigate overcrowding at the school district's three comprehensive high schools, Glendale High School, Herbert Hoover and Crescenta Valley. The task force recommended a new magnet school be commissioned, to focus on advanced technologies and the physical and earth sciences. To alleviate overcrowding, Clark Magnet High School accepts students from the attendance of all three comprehensive high schools through a lottery system.

The school uses the former campus of Anderson W. Clark Junior High School. It underwent a US$15,000,000 renovation and opened in September, 1998. The school is bolstered by corporate sponsorships. Doug Dall was the inaugural principal for Clark Magnet. He served the school until his retirement in 2016. Lena Kortoshian has been principal since 2016 until 2022, where she got promoted to a district level job. Following Kortoshian's leave, Assistant Principal Dr. Brian Landisi, became Clark's new principal as of October 2022.

About 300 students are enrolled each year. The Class of 2013 accepted 325 students out of 607 applicants, or about 54%.

Robotics

FIRST Robotics Competition Team 696 (The Circuit Breakers) is based at Clark. Each year since 2001, members have created functional robots in the six-week time period allotted.  With the help of several mentors, the team of high school students has competed at FIRST Robotics regional competitions in Los Angeles, California, San Diego, California, and Phoenix, Arizona.  In the 2007 season, after taking finalist in the Los Angeles Regional and winning the San Diego Regional, the team attended the FIRST Championship in Atlanta, Georgia for the first time in the team's history.

VEX Robotics A VEX Robotics team was established during the 2014â€“2015 school year. The team, instead of using custom built and machined parts, uses VEX's prefabricated products and systems to create competition-ready, functional, and operational robots. The team attends its own competitions and competes with other schools, similar to the FIRST team.

Mentors
The FIRST team is supported by mentors who guide the students in the creation of each year's robot.  The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, located in Pasadena, California, has long been a source of mentors for the team.  Other mentors come from local community organizations and businesses and provide the team with machining resources and sponsorship.  Parents also mentor the team, and provide guidance through their knowledge of construction, machining, design, and strategy. During the 2010 season, mentor Hannah Goldberg was awarded the Woodie Flowers Award at the San Diego Regional. In the 2015 season, David Black, a Team 696 alumnus from 2002 who became the head mentor of the team in 2011 also received the Woodie Flowers Award during the Ventura Regional, presented by Woodie Flowers himself. The Woodie Flowers Award is presented to one outstanding mentor at each FRC competition.
