Richard Ingleby Jefferson (born 15 August 1941 in Frimley Green, Surrey) is a former professional cricketer who played for Surrey County Cricket Club. 

The son of Brigadier Julian Jefferson, Jefferson was educated at Ludgrove School, Winchester College and Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. He won a blue but left after a year. He went on to play a couple of seasons for Surrey before illness in 1965 curtailed his first-class career. He subsequently played for Norfolk, before taking a Certificate in Education and teaching in a private school.  

A right-arm medium-fast bowler and right-handed bat, he was mentioned in a 1981 article by John Arlott on the best English cricketers never to have played for England. Arlott wrote that "he may well have been the greatest loss to English cricket in the post-war period".

He is the father of the cricketer Will Jefferson.
