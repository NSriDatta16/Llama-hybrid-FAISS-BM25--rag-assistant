Grand station is a St. Louis MetroLink station. The station consists of a single island platform situated beneath the Grand Boulevard viaduct.  The station is near Saint Louis University and Grand Center and connects to the region's busiest bus line on Grand Boulevard, the #70, which runs fully electric, articulated buses.

In 2011, the station was temporarily closed to permit the demolition of the Grand Boulevard viaduct and the station's original 1993 elevator towers and stairs. A temporary station was employed while the bridge was replaced and a new MetroLink station was constructed. The new station and transfer center underneath the completed viaduct opened on August 20, 2012.

Station layout 
Grand is accessible by two elevators and sets of stairs that provide access to both northbound and southbound Grand Boulevard and a ramp on Scott Avenue.

Public artwork 
In 2012, Metro's Arts in Transit program commissioned the work Garden Under the Bridge by Barbara Grygutis for installation under the Grand Boulevard viaduct near the station. In the center of the transit plaza, two “seed pod forms” create a gateway to the station and illuminate the surrounding area with electric-blue light. LED lighting embedded in the pavers work in concert with this main sculpture.
