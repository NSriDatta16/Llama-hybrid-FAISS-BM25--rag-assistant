Diamond Days is the fourth album by the British band The Outfield. The album reached No. 90 on the Billboard 200 album chart. Diamond Days was the first album the band released under the MCA record label, having previously recorded for Columbia Records. Drummer Alan Jackman left the band prior to this album's recording, so this album featured a new session drummer in Simon Dawson.

The song "For You" was released as the first single from the album, and was the band's highest charting single in four years, reaching No. 21 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. It was also the band's only song to reach the Adult Contemporary chart, reaching the same No. 21 position. "Take It All" was released as the second single, but failed to chart.
