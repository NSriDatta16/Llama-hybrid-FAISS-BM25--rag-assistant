The Edward R. Madigan State Fish and Wildlife Area is a  conservation area located in the U.S. state of Illinois.  It is located south of Lincoln, Illinois. Founded in 1971 as Railsplitter State Park, it was renamed in 1995 in honor of Edward R. Madigan, a former member of the U.S. House of Representatives from the town of Lincoln and a U.S. Secretary of Agriculture.  The park is operated by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR).

The horseshoe-shaped park surrounds the Lincoln Correctional Center/Logan Correctional Center, a complex of state facilities operated by the Illinois Department of Corrections.  One of the park's primary assets is a  section of Salt Creek, a major tributary of central Illinois' Sangamon River.
