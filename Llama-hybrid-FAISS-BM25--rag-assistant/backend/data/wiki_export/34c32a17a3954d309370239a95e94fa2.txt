Creme Puff (August 3, 1967 – August 6, 2005) was a mixed Tabby domestic cat, owned by Jake Perry of Austin, Texas, US. She was the oldest cat ever recorded, according to the 2010 edition of Guinness World Records, when she died aged 38 years and 3 days. There are now records of another female cat in Britain, named Lucy, who is said to have lived to be 39 years old, making Creme Puff the second-oldest cat known.

Perry had another cat, Granpa Rex Allen, who he said was born in Paris, Texas, on February 1, 1964 and died aged 34 years and 59 days on April 1, 1998. The sixth oldest cat ever known, Granpa was posthumously awarded 1999 Cat of the Year by Cats & Kittens magazine. He was featured in an earlier version of the Guinness World Records as the (then) oldest cat ever.

Lifestyle 
Creme Puff's owner, Jake Perry, said her diet consisted of dry cat food supplemented with broccoli, eggs, turkey bacon, coffee with cream, and—every two days—"an eyedropper full of red wine". Perry claimed that this diet was key to her longevity, and that the wine "circulated the arteries".

Perry also kept Creme Puff very active within the home, turning his garage into a movie theater that played nature documentaries for his cats. Wooden steps were built into the walls of Perry's home for the cats to climb on, and Perry had built a screened enclosure in his backyard for his pets, including Creme Puff, to enjoy the outdoors.
