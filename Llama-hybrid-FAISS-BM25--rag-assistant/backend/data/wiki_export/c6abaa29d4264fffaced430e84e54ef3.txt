Charles Edgar Schoenbaum A. S. C. (April 28, 1893 â€“ January 21, 1951) was an American cinematographer. His known film credits began in 1917--although he probably had earlier films--and ended with his untimely death from cancer in 1951. He was nominated for an Academy Award in 1949 for his work on Little Women.

Early life 
He was born in Los Angeles, California, to Anna A. Campbell (age 20) and William E. Schoenbaum (age 22). His brother was Hollywood still photographer Emmett Schoenbaum.

Career 
He began working for Fox Film sometime in the 1910s. Some of the stars he worked with closely were Elizabeth Taylor, W. C. Fields, Mickey Rooney, Gary Cooper, Norma Shearer, Wallace Reid, Abbott and Costello, Chester Morris, Wallace Beery, and many others.

Schoenbaum worked on over 100 films, including several of the Lassie films in the late 1940s. Jeanette MacDonald (who was a dog lover), joked to him, "I've come to this, working with a dog!" He was frequently a cinematographer for Cecil B. DeMille, Louis B. Mayer, Jesse Lasky, and his good friend Victor Fleming. Schoenbaum was also known for Westerns, often shooting on location in the American Southwest and Canada.

Other work 
He sometimes registered screenplays under the pseudonym "Charles Edgar."
 He was also frequently uncredited on films when he was brought in on other people's projects to help fix problems. Some of his films are also missing because he worked under different versions of his name, C. Edgar Schoenbaum, Charles E. Schoenbaum, and C. E. Schoenbaum. Sometimes it has been misspelled "Shoenbaum."

Personal life 
He married Hazel Faye Pfeiffer (1892-1983) on February 11, 1915, in Los Angeles. They had a daughter, Vera Marie, on October 9, 1916, and a son, Charles Layton, in 1917. The son died at age six months, and is buried in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery. The daughter became a playwright, lived to be 98, and enjoyed sharing her stories of old Hollywood with various researchers. The family lived in Beverly Hills, where their daughter Vera attended Beverly Hills High School.

Vera Schoenbaum (later Gebbert), under the pen name Vera Mathews, had one play on Broadway. She worked for Broadway agent Audrey Wood, and worked closely with playwright Tennessee Williams. Her play Third Cousin was performed at Margo Jones' Theater-in-the-Round in 1947, where actor Jack Warden was just getting started, and also where Tennessee Williams debuted his first play. She corresponded for years with C. S. Lewis.
