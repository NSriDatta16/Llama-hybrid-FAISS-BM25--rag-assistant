The Utah Championship presented by Zions Bank is a professional golf tournament on the Korn Ferry Tour, played at Oakridge Country Club in Farmington, Utah.

One of the original tournaments of the 1990 Ben Hogan Tour as the Utah Classic, the tournament has been played every year but two (1997, 1998). The first seven (1990–1996) were played in Provo at Riverside Country Club and the next sixteen (1999–2014) at Willow Creek in Sandy.

Formerly played in early September, the tournament moved to late July in 2011 and to mid-July in 2012. It moved to Thanksgiving Point Golf Club in Lehi in 2015, a few miles north of Utah Lake and along the Jordan River.   In 2017, the tournament moved north to Oakridge Country Club in Farmington, between Salt Lake City and Ogden; its average elevation is slightly under  above sea level.

Two major champions have won this event: John Daly won $20,000 in the inaugural edition in 1990, and Zach Johnson won $81,000 in 2003. The purse in 2018 was $700,000, with a winner's share of $126,000.
