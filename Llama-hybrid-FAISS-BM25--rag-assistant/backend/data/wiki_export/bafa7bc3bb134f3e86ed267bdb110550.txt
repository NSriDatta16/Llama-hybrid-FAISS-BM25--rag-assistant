Berlin High School is a public high school located in Berlin, Connecticut, United States.

Overview
The current high school building on Patterson Way was opened in 1953.

An addition was added to the high school in 1959, which included science labs and other rooms. An addition was constructed in 1975 housing the Media Center, the main gym and locker rooms, industrial arts rooms, cafeteria, and several science rooms.
