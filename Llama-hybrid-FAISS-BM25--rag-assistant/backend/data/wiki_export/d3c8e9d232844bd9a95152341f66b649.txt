Geography and history
There are three main rivers in the region: the Paranaíba, São Marcos and São Bento, which all have great potential for tourism.

The origin of the town is connected to the donation of lands made by José David de Souza, in 1948, to the city government of Catalão, so that a school could be built. In the same decade houses began to appear around the school, forming the settlement that received the name of Grupo because it had a "grupo escolar". Soon the school began to attract residents to the region. In 1963 the district became a municipality with the name Davinópolis, named after David de Souza, the man who had donated the first lands for the school.
