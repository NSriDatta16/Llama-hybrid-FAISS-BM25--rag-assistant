William Joseph Dodd (November 25, 1909 – November 16, 1991) was an American politician who held five positions in the Louisiana state government in the mid-20th century, including state representative, lieutenant governor, state auditor, president and member of the State Board of Education, and state education superintendent.

Dodd died of cancer in Baton Rouge General Medical Center on the day of the Edwin Edwards-David Duke gubernatorial showdown. Memorial services were held at his home church, the Southside Baptist Church in Baton Rouge on November 18, 1991, with John Robson officiating.
