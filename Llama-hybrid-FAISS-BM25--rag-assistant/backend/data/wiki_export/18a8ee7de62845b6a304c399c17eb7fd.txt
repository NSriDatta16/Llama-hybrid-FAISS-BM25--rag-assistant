The Belarusian Arabic alphabet (, Biełaruski arabski ałfavit) or Belarusian Arabitsa (بَلاروُسقایا ارابیࢯا, Беларуская Арабіца, Biełaruskaja Arabica) was based on the Arabic script and was developed in the 16th century (possibly 15th). It consisted of twenty-eight graphemes, including several additions to represent Belarusian phonemes not found in the Arabic language.

The Belarusian Arabic alphabet was used by the Lipka Tatars, who had been invited to settle in Belarusian territory, at the time part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. During the 14th–16th centuries they gradually stopped using their own language and started using the Old Belarusian language rendered in the Belarusian Arabic alphabet. Books of that literary tradition are known in Belarusian as Kitab (), which is Arabic for written material.

Some Polish texts were also written in the Arabic script in the 17th century or later.

Additional graphemes
 For the sounds  (ж),  (ч) and  (п), which are absent from the Arabic language, the following Persian graphemes were used:

 For denoting the soft  (дзь) and  (ц) sounds, the following newly constructed graphemes were used:

‎  ( )

These graphemes were used during the 16th–20th centuries to write Belarusian and Polish.

 The sounds  (ў) and  (в) were both represented by the same symbol:
