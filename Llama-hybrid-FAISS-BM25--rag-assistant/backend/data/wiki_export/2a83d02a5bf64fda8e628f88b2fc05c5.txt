"I Keep Forgettin" is a song by Chuck Jackson, written by Jerry Leiber, Mike Stoller, and Gilbert Garfield. It appears on his second studio album Any Day Now. It peaked at No. 55 on the Billboard Top 100 and remained on the chart for 7 weeks. It did not chart on the R&B chart. This single is often cited as one of the most innovative yet least commercial singles written and produced by Leiber-Stoller.

In 1982, Michael McDonald released a song titled "I Keep Forgettin' (Every Time You're Near)". The song's similarity to Jackson's "I Keep Forgettin'" resulted in Leiber and Stoller being given a songwriting credit.
