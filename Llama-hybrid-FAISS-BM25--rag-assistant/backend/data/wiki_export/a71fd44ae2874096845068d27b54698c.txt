San Felipe-Del Rio Consolidated Independent School District (SFDR-CISD) is a school district based in Del Rio, Texas (USA).

The school district serves all of the city of Del Rio and some unincorporated portions of Val Verde County, including Cienegas Terrace, Lake View, and Val Verde Park, as well as  Laughlin Air Force Base. Dependent children who are residents of the base are zoned to SFDR-CISD schools.

In 2009 the superintendent took measures to crack down on students from Mexico who were illegally attending district schools. Prior to the crackdown many residents of Ciudad Acu√±a used false addresses to attend SFDR-CISD schools.

In 2009, the school district was rated "academically acceptable" by the Texas Education Agency.
