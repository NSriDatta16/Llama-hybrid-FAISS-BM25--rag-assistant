History
Opening on Tuesday, 4 October 1966, Northland Shopping Centre was one of the first self-contained shopping centres in Melbourne. The shopping centre was built and owned by the Myer Emporium. The original shopping centre consisted of 3 malls radiating north, east and west from a centre stage area.  It housed 73 tenants and 6 professional suites.  Some of the original retailers included Myer, Coles New World Supermarket, Buckley and Nunn Department Store, McEwans, Woolworths Variety Store and Coles Variety Store.  A feature of the shopping centre was the Northland Market located at the south-west end of the shopping centre.

In July 1983, the Myer Emporium sold the shopping centre to the Gandel Group of Companies. It is currently owned 50:50 by GPT and Vicinity Group.

Legionnaires Scare
In early 2006 Northland shopping centre was one of 7 buildings suspected of harbouring legionnaires disease after an outbreak which killed one and infected 7 others in the area. Subsequent investigation by the Coroner - Dr Jane Hendtlass (Case No 729/06) confirmed that alleged buildings nearby did not contain the disease.
