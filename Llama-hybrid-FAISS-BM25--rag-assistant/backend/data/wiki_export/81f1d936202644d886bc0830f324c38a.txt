, better known mononymously as , is a Japanese entertainer signed to GATE. Since 2009, she has recorded music under the stage name Becky♪♯.

Biography
Becky was born in Kanagawa Prefecture to a Japanese mother and an English father, Simon Rabone. She has one younger sister, dancer Jessica "JJ" Rabone. Until at least 2011, Becky held dual citizenship status in both Japan and the United Kingdom. 
She graduated from Tokyo's Asia University with a degree in business administration on 15 March 2006.

Although The Japan Times previously erroneously reported her full name as "Rebecca Eri Ray Vaughan", Australian airline Jetstar Airways, having used her in advertisements and promotions aimed towards Japanese audiences, gives her full name as being "Rebecca-Eri Rabone", this surname matching that used by her father and sister; the error arises from the fact that 'Rabone' and 'Ray Vaughan' would be spelled the same way in Japanese.

Career 
She debuted as a regular on the popular children's show Oha-Suta in 1999 reading out the English names of various Pokémon characters in a section of the show called Pokémon: The World. She became a popular mascot of the show, and eventually started landing spots on various Japanese variety shows. On television, she has also appeared in numerous commercials and has lent her voice to the characters of many anime shorts and movies.

In January 2016, Becky's reputation as Japan's most popular female personality took a hit after Japanese tabloid Shūkan Bunshun revealed that she had an affair with musician Enon Kawatani who at the time was married. Following the scandal, Kawatani announced that he officially divorced his wife. In order to appease the public backlash and as a condition for her comeback to show business in Japan, Becky tried to officially apologize to Kawatani's wife. However, having no direct channel to her, Becky contacted the Shūkan Bunshun'''s editorial department instead. Shukan Bunshun published the full contents of Becky’s letter at the end of April 2016. The letter acknowledged her affair yet also implied that she had not seen Kawatani since the scandal broke and that she no longer had feelings for him. As a result of her apologies, Becky was to make her comeback with an appearance on TBS. In her first appearance back on TV, she appeared on Full Chorus - Music is Full Chorus on the cable channel BS Skyperfect TV.
 Personal life 
On 13 February 2019, Becky announced that she had married Yomiuri Giants coach Yasuyuki Kataoka.

On 17 March 2020 The couple announced the birth of their first child, and their second child was born on 20 August 2021.
