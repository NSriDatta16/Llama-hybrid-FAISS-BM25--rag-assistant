HMS Sultan is a shore base of the Royal Navy in Gosport, Hampshire, England.  It is the primary engineering training establishment for the Royal Navy and home to the Network Rail Advanced Apprenticeship Scheme and the EDF Energy engineering maintenance apprenticeship. It is expected that HMS Sultan will close in the near future, but "no earlier than 2029".

The site was originally RAF Gosport it was then transferred to the Royal Navy during 1945 as HMS Siskin (Hence a nearby school being named Siskin School) it was then renamed HMS Sultan on 1 June 1956 when the airfield side was closed down and a Mechanical Repair Establishment was moved here from the Flathouse area by Portsmouth Dockyard.

A Better Defence Estate, published in November 2016, indicated that the Ministry of Defence intend on disposing of HMS Sultan by 2026. It was proposed that Submarine Engineer Training would move to HM Naval Base Clyde in 2024, Mechanical Engineering Training to HMS Collingwood in 2025 and the Admiralty Interview Board to HM Naval Base Portsmouth in 2026. However, in March 2019 the Ministry of Defence announced that closure would be delayed to 2029 at the earliest.
