Earl of Bellomont, in the Kingdom of Ireland, was a title that was created three times in the Peerage of Ireland. The first creation came on 9 December 1680 when Charles Kirkhoven, 1st Baron Wotton, was made Earl of Bellomont. He had already been created Baron Wotton, of Wotton in the County of Kent, in the Peerage of England on 31 August 1650. He was childless and both titles became extinct on his death in 1683.

The second creation came on 2 November 1689 Richard Coote, 2nd Baron Coote, later Governor of New York, was made Earl of Bellomont. He was the son of Richard Coote, who had been created Lord Coote, Baron of Coloony, in the County of Sligo, in the Peerage of Ireland on 6 September 1660. Lord Coote was a younger son of Sir Charles Coote, 1st Baronet, and the younger brother of Charles Coote, 1st Earl of Mountrath (see Coote baronets for more information on this branch of the family). Lord Bellomont was succeeded by his elder son, Nanfan, the second Earl, who in his turn was succeeded by his younger brother, Richard, the third Earl. The earldom became extinct when the latter died without surviving male issue in 1766.

The late Earl was succeeded in the barony of Coote by his first cousin once removed, Charles Coote, who became the fifth Baron. Charles was the son of Charles Coote (1695–1750), Member of Parliament for County Cavan, son of Thomas Coote, a Justice of the Court of King's Bench (Ireland), younger son of the first Baron. On 4 September 1767 the earldom of Bellomont was created for the third time when Charles was made Earl of Bellomont (although the title was probably erroneously spelt "Bellamont" in the letters patent). On 18 May 1774 Lord Bellomont was created a Baronet, of Donnybrooke in the County of Dublin, in the Baronetage of Ireland, with remainder to his illegitimate son Charles Coote. On his death in 1800 the barony and earldom became extinct as he left no surviving legitimate male issue. He was succeeded in the baronetcy according to the special remainder by his illegitimate son, Charles, the second Baronet (see Coote baronets for further history of this title).

Properties
The family seat was located at Bellamont House in County Cavan and at 15 Temple Street in Dublin. The Dublin townhouse was later to become Temple Street Children's Hospital from 1879.
