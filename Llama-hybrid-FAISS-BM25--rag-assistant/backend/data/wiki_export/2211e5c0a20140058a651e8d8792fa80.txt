Tonight for Sure is a 1962 American sexploitation comedy film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and Jerry Schafer. It was Coppola's feature directorial debut. The film was re-edited from two existing projects, an unreleased Western-themed 'nudie cutie' directed by Schafer called The Wide Open Spaces, and a short film directed by Coppola called The Peeper. The cast features former Playboy Playmate Marli Renfro. The film's score was composed by Coppola's father Carmine Coppola, with cinematography by Jack Hill.

Plot
On the Sunset Strip, two unlikely men rendezvous: Samuel Hill, an unkempt desert miner, and Benjamin Jabowski, a John Birch Society dandy from the city. Intent on some sort of mayhem, they enter the Herald Club before the burlesque show starts, and they wire something to the electrical box, set to blow at midnight. They sit at the back of the club to get to know each other. As they drink and glance at the stage, Sam tells of a partner driven mad by visions of naked women in the sagebrush; Ben tells a tale of trying to rid his neighborhood of a pin-up studio. As they get drunker and the clock ticks toward midnight, they pull their chairs closer to the women on stage.
