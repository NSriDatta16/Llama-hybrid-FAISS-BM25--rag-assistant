The Weed Tree is the second album from Espers, released on Locust Music in 2005.  It was, for the most part, a covers album, although it did feature the original song "Dead King".  The artists covered were The Durutti Column, Nico, Michael Hurley and Blue Öyster Cult.  It also included two traditional songs drawing influence from recordings by Bert Jansch and The Famous Jug Band.  The songs were performed in the psychedelic folk style of the band.
