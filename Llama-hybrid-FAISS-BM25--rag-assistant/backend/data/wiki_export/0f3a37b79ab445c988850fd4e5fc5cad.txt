Lorne Rubenstein (born 25 June 1948 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada) is a Canadian golf journalist and author. He was the golf columnist for the Globe and Mail in Canada from 1980 to 2013. Rubenstein has written 16 books about golf.

He maintained a near-scratch handicap for many years, and played in the Ontario Amateur and British Amateur.  He caddied on the PGA Tour a few tournaments a season for several years, first for 1967 U.S. and British Amateur champion Bob Dickson, and then for 1975 and 1976 Canadian Amateur winner Jim Nelford. He is a course ranking panelist for SCOREGolf Magazine.

Rubenstein co-hosted Acura World of Golf on The Sports Network in Canada for the 11 years that it ran. He has written for publications around the world, including Golf Digest, Golf World, Golf Magazine, Esquire, Travel & Leisure Golf, Masters Journal, Golf Monthly (U.K.)., Links, Toronto Life, and others.

Rubenstein has co-written books with Jim Nelford, George Knudson, David Leadbetter, Nick Price, and Tiger Woods. Tiger Woods told Golf Digest, "Only two golfers have ever truly owned their swings: Moe Norman and Ben Hogan." The book is called Moe & Me: Encounters with Moe Norman, Golf's Mysterious Genius. ECW Press published Moe & Me in the spring of 2012.
