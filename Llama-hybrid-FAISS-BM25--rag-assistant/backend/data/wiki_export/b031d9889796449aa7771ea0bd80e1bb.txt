The circuit
Consistently driving quickly is hard work on the fast and smooth circuit. The first turn, modified from its original rounded shape into a sharp 90-degree left, is a frequent source of multi-car accidents especially on the first lap, as a popular YouTube video of a touring race illustrates this case, with former BTCC driver-turned commentator John Cleland remarking that, "The guy who designed this first corner should be taken into a dark room and beat about the head". There are many key turns to master for a fast lap. The end of the finish straight is the fastest spot on the circuit. The McDonald's chicane allows for different racing lines. However, an aggressive line may lead to early retirement with broken suspension.
