I Looked Up (Elektra EKS 2469 002 / U.S. LP: EKS-74061) is the sixth album by the Incredible String Band.  Recorded at a time when the band was busy rehearsing for their ambitious upcoming stage show, U, the album has been described by band member Robin Williamson as a "quickie" album.

Background
Recording of the album came just 5 months after Changing Horses. Like its predecessor, the album included six tracks with two compositions exceeding 10 minutes. As usual with the band, there are several instruments utilised in unique arrangements and overdubbing in the development of the album.

A rewriting of "Black Jack Davey", a Scottish traditional folk song, begins the album, sung by Heron in an uptempo style. The album also contains Robin Williamson's most experimental, "Pictures in a Mirror". The epic, a mixture of folk and drama, tells the story of Lord Randell. Williamson's vocals are prominent on this track for his range and ability to distort his voice. A highlight of the album, Mike Heron's composition "This Moment,"  is regarded as one of Heron's best pieces.

Dave Mattacks, a drummer of Fairport Convention, is featured on "The Letter", a track which is more reflective of Fairport's electric folk style.

Recording sessions also produced an unreleased track titled "Queen Juanita and Her Fisherman Lover" that is over 16 minutes in length. It would later appear on the compilation Incredible String Band: Tricks of The Senses.
Three tracks from the album, "When You Find Out Who You Are ", "The Letter", and "This Moment", were performed at the Woodstock Festival, which constituted half of their set that day.

Many consider I Looked Up an improvement to Changing Horses however the album's chart success was limited and disappointing in the US as it only topped at No. 196.
