Akkuş is a municipality and district of Ordu Province, Turkey. Its area is 697 km2, and its population is 21,258 (2022). The town lies at an elevation of .

Geography
Akkuş is in the foothills of Mount Argan in the Canik range inland from the Black Sea coast. Two rivers, the Tifi and the Karakuş are formed from streams running down from these mountains. The climate is typical of high pasture country, the district is under snow for four to five months of the year, and fog and rain for the remainder. The summer sun occasionally shines and when it does the lush green countryside is beautiful. The area could attract visitors on trekking or winter sports vacations but lacks the infrastructure for this at the moment. The local economy depends on farming, forestry and grazing livestock plus some handicrafts including carpet weaving.

History
Formerly known as Karakuş, the area was once part of the Kingdom of Pontus. The first Turkish rulers were the Danishmend and Hacıemiroğlu Anatolian beyliks and then from the 15th century the Ottoman Empire.
