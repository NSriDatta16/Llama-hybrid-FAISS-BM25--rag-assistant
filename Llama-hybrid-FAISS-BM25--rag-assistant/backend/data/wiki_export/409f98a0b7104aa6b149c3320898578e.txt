Biography
Hürtgen started her career in karting and moved to German Formula Three. In 1993, during the F3 invitational race of the Monaco Grand Prix weekend, she suffered hand injuries in a roll-over crash, which ended her single-seater career.

She began racing again with touring cars in 1995, winning the Austrian championship, followed with sports car racing, in which she scored class wins, in an LMP-675 class car or a Porsche, in the American Le Mans Series as well as in the 24 Hours of Daytona and the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

In 2000, she returned to the site of her crash, to win the Monaco Historic Grand Prix in a Maserati.

Between 2003 and 2004, she was champion in Germany's Deutsche Tourenwagen Challenge (DTC), which was renamed DMSB-Produktionswagen-Meisterschaft (DPM).

In 2005, Team Schubert and Hürtgen moved on the VLN endurance racing series on the Nürburgring Nordschleife. Hürtgen won the VLN championship in 2005, making her the first female champion since Sabine Schmitz in 1998.

At the 2006 24 Hours Nürburgring, Hürtgen drove two cars for a total of 11 hours, scoring 5th place among 220 cars with a 245 bhp BMW 120d.

She won the Dubai 24 Hour and finished 2nd overall at the Spa 24 Hours having started from 49th on the grid, in addition to her three podiums in the FIA GT3 season.
