The hillfort was explored:

 in 1875 — by D. M. Gremenitsky;
 in 1884 — by N. Primkulov and N. I. Veselovsky;
 in 1890 — by K. H. T. Krause;
 in 1896 — by members of the Turkestan Group of Amateurs of Archeology;
 in 1923  — by M. E. Masson;
 in 1929 — by A. A. Potapov;
 in 1958 — by Y. F. Buryakov and S. X. Ishankhanov.

Small excavations and archaeological research were carried out here. Only a rectangular shahriston with an area of 20 hectares and a citadel in the northern part has been preserved.

Both the citadel and the shahriston are surrounded by defensive walls (enceinte), the latter retaining traces of 4 gates. The thickness of the cultural layer in some places exceeds 10 meters.

The available material allows us to attribute the settlement of the area to the time of the first centuries AD, and the blossoming of life - to the IX-X centuries and especially - to the XI-XII centuries.

During archaeological research, two ossuaries dating back to the 6th century and belonging to the Era of the Zoroastrianism were discovered. They are currently in the State Museum of History of Uzbekistan in Tashkent.
