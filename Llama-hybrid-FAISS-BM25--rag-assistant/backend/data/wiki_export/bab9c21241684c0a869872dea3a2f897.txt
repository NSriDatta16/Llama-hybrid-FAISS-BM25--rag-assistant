The Tripura Janasiksha Samiti is an organisation in the Indian state of Tripura which was created to setup schools and spread education among the children of the down-trodden people of that state. It was formed on 27 December 1945.

At that time, the movement of the Janasiksha Samiti speedily transformed into a mass movement. The Samiti could establish 488 primary schools in different remote areas of the state with the active co-operation, financial help and labour of the mass people. Subsequently, in 1950â€“51, most of these schools were recognised by the State Government. The Samiti also published the first Kokborok Magazine "Kwtal Kothoma" in 1954 AD under Sudhanwa Debbarma.
