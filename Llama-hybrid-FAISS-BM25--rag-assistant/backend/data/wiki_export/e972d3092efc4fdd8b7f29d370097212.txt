Dog & Butterfly is the fourth studio album by American rock band Heart, released in September 1978, by Portrait Records, following a legal dispute with Mushroom Records over the release of the band's second studio album, Magazine, in April 1978. Dog & Butterfly peaked at number 17 on the US Billboard 200 and has been certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album spawned the singles "Straight On" and "Dog & Butterfly".

As Heart themselves noted on the album's release, side one was the Dog side, and was the more "rocking" compared to the Butterfly side two, which consisted mostly of ballads, with the exception of the closer "Mistral Wind".

Though the first song, "Cook with Fire", sounds like a live recording, the liner notes to the 2004 CD reissue state that it was actually recorded at Sea-West Studios along with the rest of the album. Audience sounds from a live performance were overdubbed on the studio recording.

On June 29, 2004, the album was reissued by Epic Records and Legacy Recordings in a remastered edition, containing three bonus tracks. One of the songs, "Feels", was later reworked and became "Johnny Moon", included on the band's seventh studio album, Passionworks (1983).
