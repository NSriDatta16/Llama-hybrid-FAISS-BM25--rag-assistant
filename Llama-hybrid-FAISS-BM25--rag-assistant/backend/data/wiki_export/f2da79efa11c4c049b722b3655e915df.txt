Gable Garenamotse (born February 28, 1977 in Gumare, North-West) is a Botswana long jumper, who has won two silver medals at the Commonwealth Games.

In 1999 Garenamotse won the triple jump at the African Southern Region Championships, and participated in both long jump and triple jump at the World Championships. Having peaked at a 16.66 metres jump that year, a national record, he decided to concentrate on long jump from thereon. His first international medal was a bronze at the 21st Universiade in 2001.

At the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester Garenamotse placed second. He competed at the 2004 Olympics, without reaching the final. He repeated the second place four years later at the 2006 Commonwealth Games, setting a national record of 8.17 metres. In August the same year he improved to 8.27 metres. He won the gold medal at the 2007 All-Africa Games.

Gable Garenamotse did not reach the final at the 2007 World Championships, but finished fourth at the 2008 World Indoor Championships, seventh at the 2008 African Championships and ninth at the 2008 Olympic Games.
