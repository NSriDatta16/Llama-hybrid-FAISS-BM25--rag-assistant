Toobin is an Atari Games and Midway Games arcade video game released in 1988. It is based on the recreational activity tubing. Toobin was ported to the Amiga, Commodore 64, Atari ST, Amstrad CPC, Nintendo Entertainment System, MS-DOS, Game Boy Color, ZX Spectrum, and MSX. Players assume control of tubers Bif or Jet, guiding them along vertically scrolling rivers on an inner tube.

Gameplay 

The player competes in a river race against the computer or another player. The player's score increases by swishing the gates, hitting other characters with cans, collecting hidden letters to spell Toobin, and collecting treasures. Players try to avoid obstacles while pushing each other into them.

Power-ups allow players to carry multiple cans and combinations of gates increase a score multiplier. The game has three different classes, each with five rivers, for a total of 15.

Legacy 
The game is included as part of Midway Arcade Treasures and Arcade Party Pak, where it was given a remixed soundtrack. It was also included in the 2012 compilation Midway Arcade Origins. The game is one of the 23 arcade games that are included with the Midway Arcade Level Pack for Lego Dimensions, unlocked by using the hidden Arcade Dock in the level "Follow The Lego Brick Road".  It is also an included title on the Arcade1Up Midway Legacy Edition cabinet.
