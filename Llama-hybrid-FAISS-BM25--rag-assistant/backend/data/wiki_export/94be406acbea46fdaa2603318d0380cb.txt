History

Ayios Dhometios, has existed since ancient times as a small village, located 4 kilometres west of Nicosia. Mention of Ayios Dhometios comes from as early as the Franks era (Lusignan Period 1191–1489). The town is named after St. Dometios of Persia who originated from Persia in the 4th century AD and who became Christian later in his life. He lived in a cave in Mesopotamia and converted many people into Christianity. Roman Emperor Julian the Apostate accused Dhometios of tricking people, so Dhometios answered the Emperor that all of these harmless people visit him freely and he cannot just send them away. Julian the Apostate felt offended by his answer and ordered his death. Dhometios was stoned to death at 362 AD. The church of Ayios Dhometios was built in the 17th century and is dedicated to the Saint. It's built on a small hill and is one of the town's main attractions.

At the first British census in 1881, the population was 430. This had grown to 10,055 at independence in 1960, including Greek 7,672, Maronite 73, Armenian 66, Turkish 1,British 2,065.

Betting in Ayios Dhometios

Horseracing was revived in Cyprus, Ayios Dhometios from the end of the 19th century. However, the tradition of the sport in this country, as evidenced by archaeological findings existing in the Cyprus Museum, is lost in the depth of the Hellenistic period, where we come across horseracing descriptions by Homer and other ancient authors. Horseracing in those days was actually a "sport of kings" who participated in them. When Kings of ancient Salamis of Cyprus died, their horses were buried with them. Horse racing was for the first time entered in the Olympic Games in the 7th century BC.

Ayios Dhometios is dubbed by many as Cyprus betting capital. The presence of the island's horse race track in the municipality brings hefty revenue to the town but also attracts thousands of horse enthusiasts and gamblers during the races. Due to the presence of the race track, tens of betting parlours exist around the town.
