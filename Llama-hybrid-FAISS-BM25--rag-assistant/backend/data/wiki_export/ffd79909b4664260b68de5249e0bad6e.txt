Pozo (Spanish for "Well") is an unincorporated community along the former Butterfield Overland Mail stagecoach route, in San Luis Obispo County, California. The closest communities appearing on road maps are California Valley and Santa Margarita. A USGS-provided set of coordinates for the town are on the Santa Margarita Lake 7.5-minute quadrangle.

Pozo was named by George Washington Lingo, Esq., "a well known citizen" who proposed the name for the post office because the village is in a holelike valleyâ€”pozo means "well" or "hole" in Spanish.

Pozo is home to the still thriving Pozo Saloon, established in 1858. During its early years, the Pozo Saloon was the primary watering hole for weary travelers making their way over Pozo Summit. Today it is a well-known live music venue, hosting internationally-known acts including Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard, and G Love and Special Sauce.

The ZIP Code is 93453. The community is inside area code 805.
