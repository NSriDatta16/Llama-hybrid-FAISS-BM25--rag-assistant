ITV Weather is the national and regional forecast shown on UK terrestrial network ITV, and is provided by the Met Office (except the Channel Islands forecast, which is provided by the Jersey Meteorological Department). Bulletins are usually broadcast after every ITV News and ITV regional bulletin; since March 2022, however, ITV Weather runs as a segment of the ITV Evening News, live from the news studio on weekdays. Emma Jesson is the longest serving forecaster after 30 years with ITV Weather.

National weather
The national bulletin launched on the ITV network on 13 February 1989, complimenting the previous regional arrangements whereby the separate ITV regional licence holders were responsible for providing weather forecasts themselves only for their regional franchise areas.

National weather sponsors
The national weather for ITV has had commercial sponsors from the outset, as listed in the chart below. ITV Weather on Good Morning Britain and its predecessors have always had a different sponsorship deal.

Regional weather
Each region has at least one dedicated presenter.
At weekends three presenters cover all of the 15 sub-regions and one presenter covers the national forecast. Currently the weekend hubs are grouped and recorded from the following: 
Calendar (North/South opts), Granada Reports, ITV News Tyne Tees and Lookaround. 
MediaCityUK in Salford, Greater Manchester.
ITV News Anglia (East/West opts), ITV News Central (East/West opts), ITV News London and ITV News Cymru Wales.
Millbank Studios in Millbank, central London.
ITV News Channel TV, ITV News Meridian (East/West opts) and ITV News West Country (West/South West opts) 
Whiteley, Hampshire.
