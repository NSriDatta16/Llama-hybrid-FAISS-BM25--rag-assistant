Plot summary
SpongeBob receives a paddle ball sent to him in the mail and begins to play with it. He is totally consumed by the challenge of hitting the ball an absurd number of times and forgets to feed his pet snail Gary for ten days. Feeling neglected, Gary runs away from home. SpongeBob is shaken from his infatuation with the arrival of Patrick, and finds a note saying that Gary has left in search of a new owner. Gary wanders into a new city, where old lady mistakes him for one of her pets, Miss Tuffsy. Gary is showered with love and food while SpongeBob goes to work, sad that his pet is still missing. Mr. Krabs encourages SpongeBob to work, but SpongeBob misinterprets his words, and he takes the day off to look for Gary. He and Patrick put up posters and signs everywhere in the hope of finding Gary.

At the old lady's house, Gary is well-fed & finds and reads one of the flyers. Realizing that SpongeBob truly loves him, Gary tries to leave, but accidentally finds a closet filled with empty snail shells. When the old lady tries to feed him again, Gary suspects that the old lady has sinister motivesâ€”she is possibly trying to fatten and then eat him. He makes his escape, but the old lady chases him out onto the streets. Gary finds a feral snail, which the old lady now mistakes for Miss Tuffsy, and takes him home instead. Back home, SpongeBob gives up on his search for Gary, and tries to forget about him by taking a walk, but his memories keep coming to mind and upsetting him. He is constantly reminded as the streets are filled with posters and signs for Gary. SpongeBob hears a meow and turns around to find Gary at his side; he is overjoyed to see his beloved pet again and apologizes to Gary for doubting him, to which Gary forgives him.

Reception

"Have You Seen This Snail?" was watched by eight million viewers. It was the highest-rated program on all TV with children aged two-eleven for the year of 2005 behind the Super Bowl and the Super Bowl kick-off, and the highest-rated program on all of cable with children aged two to eleven and children aged six to eleven in 2005.

"Have You Seen This Snail?" received mostly positive reviews from television critics. Tom Shales of The Washington Post called the episode deeply hilarious and described the plot as a "bittersweet riot". He drew attention to how the story is similar to the plot of "Dumped", an earlier episode in which Gary deserted SpongeBob. David Johnson of the DVD Verdict positively reacted to the DVD release of the episode and said "I'm not sure what to say, here. Mr. Squarepants is so ridiculously popular, this disc will most definitely sell itself." Aida Ekberg of Yahoo! Voices ranked Amy Poehler on her "Top 10 SpongeBob SquarePants Guest Stars" list and said "I'm surprised more comedians haven't been guest stars on SpongeBob. Amy Poehler does a great job with her creepy grandma voice, playing pure evil masked behind plate after plate of chocolate chip cookies." Paul Mavis of DVD Talk loved the scene "[when] Gary realizes he has to escape from her crushing love (which equals constant overeating) or die like the other snail shells he finds", noting, "it's both funny and rather touching."

Nader Michael of the St. Petersburg Times was not so positive about the episode, however, criticizing how SpongeBob's disappointed and sad character for "Have You Seen This Snail?" is quite different from the character's normal bright personality. Blogger and Blogcritics founder Eric Olsen said "the episode itself is rather wan and slack, notably lacking in the air of giddy zaniness that millions of men, women and, um, children so happily cleave to."
