Lakelse Lake Provincial Park is a provincial park in British Columbia, Canada, located just west of Highway 37 between Terrace and Kitimat.  The name is derived from the Coast Tsimshian language word "LaxGyels" - "fresh water mussel", for the mollusk that is found on the bottom of both Lakelse Lake and Lakelse River. Before Lakelse Lake became a provincial park, Hatchery Creek, which runs throughout the park, was the site of a sockeye salmon hatchery operated by the Canadian Government between 1919 and 1936. Lakelse Lake Provincial Park was established on March 16, 1956.

The park is  in size and is primarily used for camping, boating, canoeing, swimming and nature trail walking.

The nearby Lakelse Hot Springs are located just east of the lake.
