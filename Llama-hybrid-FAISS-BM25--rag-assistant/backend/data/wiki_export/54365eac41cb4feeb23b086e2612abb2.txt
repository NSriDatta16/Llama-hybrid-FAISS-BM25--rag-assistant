Classic Disney: 60 Years of Musical Magic is a five-volume compilation series, each containing 25 (125 in total) songs compiled from Disneyland and Walt Disney World, various Disney films in animation and live-action, and the Walt Disney anthology television series.

The series was followed by Disney's Greatest, a three-volume compilation series released in 2001 and 2002. The series was very similar to Classic Disney and although each volume featured many of the same songs, only 20 songs appeared on each volume as opposed to Classic Disney'''s 25. In addition to containing only 20 songs, the Disney's Greatest compilations also contained songs from films released from 1999 - 2002, after the Classic Disney compilations were released.
