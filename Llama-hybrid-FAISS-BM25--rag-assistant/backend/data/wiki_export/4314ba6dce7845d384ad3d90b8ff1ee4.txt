"Every Shade of Blue" is a 1995 song by English musical duo Bananarama, from their seventh album, Ultra Violet. After appearing as a B-side in the promotional single "I Found Love", the song was officially released as lead single on 21 August 1995 only in Australia, Japan and dance radio station in US. Bananarama did not have a major-label contract at the time.

Background
The sentiments and sound of the song are melancholic and diverge from the upbeat nature of the majority of their hits. "Every Shade of Blue" reached number 124 in Australia and number 41 on Billboards Hot Dance Singles Sales chart in the United States.

In 2010, Bananarama re-recorded the song. This new version appeared on the B-side of the group's single "Love Don't Live Here".

Critical reception
Larry Flick from Billboard wrote that the song is "standard Euro-NRG fare that benefits from producer Gary Miller's ability to balance solid song arrangements with spine-crawling dance rhythms." He also added the track as a "vibrant single". Dave Sholin from the Gavin Report commented that Bananarama is now a twosome, and on the strength of this "slice of rhythmic pop, they stand a good chance of scoring their first success in this decade."

Music video
The music video was directed by fashion designer Roland Mouret and features footage of the two girls singing the song while sitting on the floor. These shots are interspersed with brief images of three young men who either pose for the camera or play with a soccer ball.
