Agnes Betty Jeffrey, OAM (14 May 1908 â€“ 13 September 2000) was an Australian writer who wrote about her Second World War nursing experiences in the book White Coolies.

Life
Jeffrey was a nurse in the 2/10th Australian General Hospital during World War II; she was taken captive by the Japanese Imperial Army and interned in the Dutch East Indies. While in the Japanese internment camp on Sumatra, Jeffrey joined the female vocal orchestra. Betty Jeffrey was freed and returned home on October 24, 1945.

Jeffrey and Vivian Bullwinkel visited every sizable hospital in Victoria to raise the money that created the Australian Nurses Memorial Centre. She is noted as a founder together with Edith Hughes-Jones, Wilma Oram and Annie M. Sage. The Melbourne Nurses Memorial Centre opened in 1949 to honour the heroism of nurses. 

She later wrote about her experiences in the book White Coolies, which partially inspired the film Paradise Road and the 1955 Australian radio series White Coolies.  Margaret Dryburgh, Vivian Bullwinkel and Wilma Oram were fellow internees with Jeffrey.
