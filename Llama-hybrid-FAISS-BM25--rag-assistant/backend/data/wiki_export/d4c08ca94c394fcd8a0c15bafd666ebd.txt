Greatest Hits is the first greatest hits album by singer/songwriter Barry Manilow, released in 1978. The album was certified 3Ã— Platinum in the US, and would be Manilow's last of that certification, . It also features the new single, "Ready to Take a Chance Again", which reached #11 in the US the same year. The US CD version has been released in three slightly different incarnations. The first pressing featured the single version of "Copacabana" (3:58), and the non-hit studio version of "Daybreak" (3:09). "Jump Shout Boogie" was omitted from all three versions.

In some European countries the album was released as Manilow Magic: The Best of Barry Manilow The Very Best of Barry Manilow, or simply The Best Of Barry Manilow. It was a single LP with either 11 or 12 tracks.
