Barry Paul "Gibby" Gibbs (born September 28, 1948) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey defenceman. He was selected first overall in the 1966 NHL Amateur Draft.

Playing career
During his NHL career, Gibbs played for the Boston Bruins, Minnesota North Stars, Atlanta Flames, St. Louis Blues and Los Angeles Kings. He retired in 1981.

Gibbs came to Minnesota from Boston in the deal that brought Tom Williams to the North Stars. He played junior hockey at Estevan, Sask. and in the Boston organization at Oklahoma City of the CHL.  He comes from a family of seven, four boys and three girls. His nephew, Darren Gibbs, has worked as an on-ice official in the National Hockey League since 1997.

On the final weekend of the 1969-70 season, Gibbs scored the only goal in Minnesota's 1-0 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers on April 4. The goal came on an 80-foot shot that somehow eluded Flyers' goalie Bernie Parent.  The loss eliminated the Flyers from playoff contention. He was traded along with Phil Myre and Curt Bennett from the Flames to the Blues for Bob MacMillan, Dick Redmond, Yves Bélanger and a second‐round selection in the 1979 NHL Entry Draft (23rd overall–Mike Perovich) on December 12, 1977.
