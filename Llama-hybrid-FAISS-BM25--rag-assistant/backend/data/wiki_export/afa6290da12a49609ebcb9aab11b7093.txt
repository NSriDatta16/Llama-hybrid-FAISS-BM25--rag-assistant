Lunch Boxes & Choklit Cows is a compilation album of previously unreleased demo tracks recorded in the early 1990s by American rock band Marilyn Manson (then known as Marilyn Manson & The Spooky Kids). Original guitarist Scott Putesky ("Daisy Berkowitz") obtained the rights to these and 11 other recordings in a lawsuit against Brian Warner ("Marilyn Manson"), and announced that this release is the first in a planned series of Spooky Kids CDs.  Some are from demos and others have never been previously released.  These are digitally remastered and Putesky says they sound better than the original cassettes because of it.

The album originally came packaged with a "bonus" DVD and slightly different artwork. The original cover had 5 cartoon figures of the band drawn by Marilyn Manson.  However, after a lawsuit was filed, Putesky removed the artwork (originally by Warner) and the DVD (which contained footage of Warner & Stephen Bier) and re-released the CD.  The re-released cover is the same as the original except the cartoon images are removed.

Copies of the original version with the DVD and artwork can occasionally be found on eBay or Amazon.
