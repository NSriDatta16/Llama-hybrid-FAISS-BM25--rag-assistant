Anyone's Daughter is a German progressive rock band founded in 1972 in Stuttgart by Uwe Karpa und Matthias Ulmer.  They are considered Progressive rock, similar to German bands like Eloy and Novalis.

History 
The band started out playing covers of Deep Purple and others, and gave themselves the name after the Deep Purple song was released in 1971. The group went through a number of personnel changes before they released their first album Adonis, in 1979.

Their third album was their first album in their native language; German.  "Piktors Verwandlungen," a 40-minute piece of music written for a fairy tale by German author Hermann Hesse, was narrated by the band's singer and bassist Harald Bareth.

Upon the release of two more albums and after Bareth's departure in 1984 due to military service commitments, the band drifted apart.

Karpa and Ulmer briefly reformed the group in 1986 with new musicians. The songs that were recorded at that time were released onto the album "Last Tracks"; the group's last release until they reunited again in 2000.

Two years after, they performed in Calw, in a festival honouring German author Hermann Hesse. On this occasion "Piktors Verwandlungen" was narrated by Heinz Rudolf Kunze.

After the release of two more studio albums, the group became a trio, releasing a live album.  Uwe Karpa left the group in 2015 due to solo project commitments, leaving Matthias Ulmer the sole remaining consistent member.
