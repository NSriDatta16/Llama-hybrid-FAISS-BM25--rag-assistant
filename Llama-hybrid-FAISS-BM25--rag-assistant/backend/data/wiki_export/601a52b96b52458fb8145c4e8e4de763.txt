Fearless Hyena Part II () is a 1983 Hong Kong martial arts action film directed by Chan Chuen, and starring Jackie Chan. It was the sequel to the first part The Fearless Hyena.

Background
When film producer Willie Chan left the Lo Wei Motion Picture Company to join Golden Harvest, he advised Jackie Chan to decide for himself whether or not to stay with Lo Wei. Chan began work on the film, but then broke his contract and joined Golden Harvest. This prompted Lo to blackmail him with triads, and to blame Willie Chan for his star's departure. The dispute was resolved with the help of fellow actor and director Jimmy Wang Yu, allowing Chan to stay with Golden Harvest.

In order to complete the film, Lo hired stunt doubles to take Chan's place in the remainder of the film, and used alternative takes and reused footage from the first film. Chan mentions that the end product of the film was so bad that he even tried to stop it from being released by going to court, but Lo released the film regardless.

Plot
Two cousins, Cheng Lung (Jackie Chan) and Tung (Austin Wai), get together to avenge the death of their fathers, who were killed by two rivals.
