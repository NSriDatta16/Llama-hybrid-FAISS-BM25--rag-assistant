Lüchow (Wendland) () is a city in northeastern Lower Saxony, in Germany. It is the seat of the Samtgemeinde ("collective municipality") Lüchow (Wendland), and is the capital of the district Lüchow-Dannenberg. Situated approximately 13 km north of Salzwedel, Lüchow is located on the German Framework Road. In the Polabian language, Lüchow is called Ljauchüw (Lgauchi or Lieuschü in older German reference material).

In Lüchow one can find the Stones Fan Museum. The museum is designated to the Rolling Stones and was founded in 2011.

Geography
The river Jeetzel, a tributary of the Elbe, flows through the city. The surrounding landscape was created by glacial action, rising in the west, lower in the east.

A total of 89 km2 are within the limits of the city, which is divided into 24 boroughs: 

Several of the boroughs are named for, and generally represent, previously independent settlements which Lüchow has incorporated. 

The site was first mentioned in 1158, and received city rights in 1293. The only remnant of the fortifications built to defend in the late Middle Ages is a tower, which was adapted and used as a bell tower by St John's Church. A gate was erected in 1555 which divided the city centre from its western suburbs; this gate was demolished in 1793. Lüchow suffered from an outbreak of the Plague in 1537, and barely half a century later, in 1589, was largely destroyed by fire. Another fire in 1608 destroyed much of what had been rebuilt. The worst fire, in 1811, destroyed even the city hall and the Schloss.
