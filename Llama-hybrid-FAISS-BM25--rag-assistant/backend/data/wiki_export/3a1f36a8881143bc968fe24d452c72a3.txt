History

1879–1964 overview
On the viaduct, at the north side of Dalmarnock Road, was the Caledonian Railway high-level station called Bridgeton. Opened on 1 April 1879, on what was then the London Road branch, it closed when the current station opened on 1 November 1895. 

The siding from the nearby rail yard to the gas works passed under the viaduct, above the current platform area, and across the Swanston Street level crossing. All remnants have since been demolished.

The low-level station closed on 5 October 1964 as a result of the Beeching Axe, but the station and tunnel remained intact.

1979 reopening
At the opening of the Argyle Line in November 1979, the station was served by six trains per hour on Mondays to Saturdays. in the westerly direction all went to , with three via  and three via . Two of these were extended to . In the easterly direction all trains travelled around the Hamilton Circle to  three in the clockwise direction passing through  prior to Motherwell and three passing through  first. The limited stop  to/from  trains did not stop at Dalmarnock.

Station refurbishment
The station underwent a full revamp in time for the 2014 Commonwealth Games, being handy to the athletes' village and several venues. Lifts were installed and a new street-level entrance and ticket office constructed along with landscaping aimed at better connecting the station environs to the nearby River Clyde and Glasgow Green. The station was temporarily closed for renovation on 4 June 2012 and was scheduled to reopen in November 2012, but the closure was extended to spring 2013 because of major problems over groundworks. The station reopened to passengers on 20 May 2013.
