Litchfieldite is a rare igneous rock. It is a coarse-grained, foliated variety of nepheline syenite, sometimes called nepheline syenite gneiss or gneissic nepeheline syenite. Litchfieldite is composed of two varieties of feldspar (mostly albite but also some microcline), with nepheline, sodalite, cancrinite and calcite. The mafic minerals, when present, are magnetite and an iron-rich variety of biotite (lepidomelane).

Occurrence
The rock was named after its occurrence at Litchfield, Maine, USA, by Bayley in 1892.

It is a very rare rock and also occurs in Blue Mountain and French River, Canada; Soroy and Val River, Norway; Cevadais, Portugal; Canaã, Boca Nova, Itajú da Colonia and Peixes, Brazil.

Petrology

Besides the mineral composition litchfieldites are characterized by one or more of the following structures:
 A gneissic appearance due to the alternation of leucocratic and mafic bearing mineral bands;
 A foliated appearance, due to preferred orientation of platey minerals like lepidomelane biotite,
 Parallel orientation of the optical axis of minerals like nepheline.
 Occurrence within zoned bodies, enveloped by amphibole bearing syenites and quartz-syenites rocks,
 Broken and/or bent twin lamellae in plagioclase (albite),
 Mortar structure,
 Biotite with kink banding structure and bent cleavage planes,
 Occurrence as large boudin or scattered blocks at the surface,
 Occurrence within metamorphic belt as elongated bodies parallel to the regional structures,
 Isotopic age according to the regional metamorphism

Origin

There are two hypotheses for the origin of these rocks:
1) A pre-tectonic magmatic nepheline syenite
2) A synorogenic intrusion of nepheline syenite

Both schools of thought are in accordance that rocks like litchfieldite owe their mineral and structural characteristics to the metamorphism.

Economy

Due to the content of alkali elements and alumina, they are very important ore for the glass industry. The iron-bearing minerals when present are strongly magnetic and can be removed through a magnetic field.
