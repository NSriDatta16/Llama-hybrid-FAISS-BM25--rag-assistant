Mount Deborah is a mountain in the U.S. state of Alaska.  It is one of the major peaks of the eastern Alaska Range.  Despite its low absolute elevation (compared to other major peaks in North America), it is a particularly large and steep peak in terms of its quick rise over local terrain.  For example, the Northeast Face rises 7000 feet (2135m) in approximately 1.5 miles (2.4Â km). This steepness, combined with difficult access, harsh weather, and classic Alaskan ice and snow features, make this a challenging peak to climb.

Mount Deborah was named in 1907 by James Wickersham for his first wife, Deborah Susan (Bell) Wickersham.

First ascent
Mount Deborah was first climbed in 1954 by Fred Beckey, Henry Meybohm, Heinrich Harrer, via the South Ridge.

Notable attempts and ascents

Today's standard route is the West Face; the Northwest Ridge is also a recommended route.

Mount Deborah is the subject of one of the classics of mountaineering literature, Deborah: A Wilderness Narrative, by David Roberts, which describes a failed attempt on the peak in 1964.
