Trump Model Management, later shortened to T Management, was a New York City-based modeling agency founded by Donald Trump as T Models in 1999. It was closed by Trump in April 2017, shortly after he became U.S. president.

History
In October 2014, Trump Model Management was sued by model Alexia Palmer.  Palmer alleged that 80% of her wages were taken away from her as "expenses" and that she had been paid less than $4000 over a two-year period. The lawsuit was dismissed in March 2016.

In July 2015, it was reported that Trump Model Management and Trump Management Group LLC combined had requested US visas for almost 250 international fashion models.
 
In August 2016, former Trump models alleged that they had worked for the agency without the company having obtained proper work visas on their behalf.

In September 2016, Senator Barbara Boxer called on United States Citizenship and Immigration Services to investigate the allegations.

In April 2017, after Trump was inaugurated as U.S president, it was announced that the agency would be closed down.
