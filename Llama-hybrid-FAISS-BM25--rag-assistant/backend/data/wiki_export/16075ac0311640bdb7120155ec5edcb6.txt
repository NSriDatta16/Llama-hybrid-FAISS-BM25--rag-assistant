Brad Murphey (born December 27, 1955, in Tucson, Arizona), is a former American racecar driver in the Indy Racing League.  He raced in the 1996 and 1996-1997 seasons for Hemelgarn Racing with 3 career starts, including the Indianapolis 500 where he was credited with 23rd place, but never finished a race or led a lap.  His last IRL race was the inaugural 500K at Las Vegas Motor Speedway where his right leg/pelvis was broken while involved in an accident with Eddie Cheever and Stephane Gregoire on lap 29.

He also has prior experience in Indy Lights, Trans-Am Series, Formula Super Vee, Formula Ford, and HotRod racing. In 1984 he attempted to qualify for the CART races at Mid Ohio and Las Vegas, but failed to do so.

Despite many websites stating that he is Australian, Murphey was born and raised in Arizona and has in fact never been to Australia. He believes the misconception was due to the fact that most of his race crew during his entire career was from Australia or New Zealand and that the phenomena of him being incorrectly identified as Australian predates the internet.
