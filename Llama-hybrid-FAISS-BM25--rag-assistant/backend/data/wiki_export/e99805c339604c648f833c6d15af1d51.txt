Cedar Lawn Cemetery is a rural cemetery in Paterson, New Jersey, and is also considered one of the finest Victorian cemeteries in the USA. Cedar Lawn Cemetery officially opened in September 1867, and recorded its first burial on September 27, 1867.

Cedar Lawn is located on a multi-acre plot bordered by Lakeview Avenue (CR 624), Crooks Avenue, I-80, and NJ-20; the plot is also home to the adjacent Calvary Cemetery, a Roman Catholic burial ground. Over 85,000 people are interned at Cedar Lawn.

During the Revolutionary War, the cemetery was farmland, owned by Annatje Von Riper, her son Henry Doremus, and Hessel Peterse. The British army plundered the three households on its march through New Jersey in November 1776.
