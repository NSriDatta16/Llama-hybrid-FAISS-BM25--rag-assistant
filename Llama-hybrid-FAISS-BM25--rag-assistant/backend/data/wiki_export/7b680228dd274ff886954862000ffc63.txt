In December 2010, Major confirmed that he had been directing some episodes of Neighbours with the help of an existing television director. Major admitted that he finds the directing part of his job "very tough to fit it in with the acting" because he is "running from location to location and getting the scene shot and then putting a different hat on and directing a scene." Of his decision to take on the new role, Major has said "I want to do it all. I also do a lot of writing. I write my own plays and put them on, direct and produce them. Australia is a very small industry acting-wise. I've been doing it professionally for 21 years and you just have to have more strings to your bow than acting." In 2019, Major won Best Direction in a TV or SVOD Drama Serial for his work on "Episode 7776A" at the Australian Directors' Guild Awards. He was nominated in the same category for "Episode 7776B". He directed over 200 episodes of Neighbours.

Major reprised his role of Rivers in Netflix's 2022 reboot of Heartbreak High''. Of the changes to his character, Major said "Rivers was a horrible, racist, sexist human being. But by the time he left, he was no longer that person and in this new series, he's on a whole new journey." Rivers is the father of Darren Rivers, one of the main characters, who is queer and non-binary. Major was adamant that Rivers would not be a homophobe and instead accepted Darren for who they were.
