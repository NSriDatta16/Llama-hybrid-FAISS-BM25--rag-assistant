Music video
The video was directed by Sophie Muller, who directed the video for her last single Just a Little Girl, and produced by Dawn Rose. The video was filmed at Eagle Rock High School in Los Angeles, California. American actress Danielle Panabaker appears in the video as a schoolgirl.

The video begins with Amy walking to school, before getting tripped up and pushed around when she gets in. She flees to the bathroom, and then imagines herself performing. Then she is shown in a dormitory with her in a nightdress. All the girls are crowding around her, and she doesn't seem to like it so she climbs on top of a cupboard. She is then shown dancing with some other girls imagining herself to be like everybody else, which clearly displeases her. Then she proceeds to dance by herself in her own unique way, until some people in suits drive up to the school, presumably talent scouts, see her and start shooting pictures with her, and the other girls are seen to be crying. At the end she is seen back on top of the cupboard smiling.
