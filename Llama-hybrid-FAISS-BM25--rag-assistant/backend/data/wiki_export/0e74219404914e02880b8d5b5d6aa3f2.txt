Club song
Chorus:Oh when the Saints come marching inOh When the Saints come marching inOh lord I want to be in that numberWhen the Saints come marching in(Chorus)We are travelling the footstepsOf those who've gone beforeBut we'll all be reunitedOn a new and sunlit shore(Chorus)Some days in this world of troubleIs the only one we needBut Iâ€™m waiting for that morningwhen the new world is revealed(Chorus x2)''
