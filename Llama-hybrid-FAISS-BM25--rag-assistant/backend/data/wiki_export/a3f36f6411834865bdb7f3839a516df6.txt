History
KAWZ began broadcasting on April 3, 1988 (Easter Sunday), with Pastor Mike Kestler as its founder. The network was launched on April 26, 1995, broadcasting Christian radio over satellite from KAWZ in Twin Falls. The first satellite-fed translator to begin receiving the network from KAWZ was in Yucca Valley, California, and within six months the network had dozens of translators. It was originally known as the Calvary Satellite Network.

By 1999, the network had grown to include 153 stations and translators, and by 2004 it had grown to approximately 400 stations and translators across the United States.

In 2007, an agreement was reached between the Twin Falls, Idaho based network and parties associated with Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa where the Twin Falls, Idaho based network kept 424 of the network's 457 stations and translators, but could no longer use Calvary Chapel branding. Most of the stations received by the parties associated with Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa were sold to the Calvary Radio Network the following year.
