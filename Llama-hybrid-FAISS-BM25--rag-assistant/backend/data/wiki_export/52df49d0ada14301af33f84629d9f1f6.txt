History
Northwest began as Tate County Agricultural High School in 1915. The College began in 1928 with support from Tate and Quitman counties and the Mississippi Junior College Commission. The first President was Porter Walker Berry.

The school changed with the times. Depression era students were allowed to pay for room and board with produce, and World War II male students studied at an accelerated pace to join the war effort. The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools gave accreditation to Northwest in 1953. Effective January 2, 1988, the institution changed its name from Northwest Mississippi Junior College to Northwest Mississippi Community College.

The college serves an eleven county district and gradually expanded its offerings. Today, Internet classes, noncredit classes, and non-traditional offerings for adults round out the modern campus.
