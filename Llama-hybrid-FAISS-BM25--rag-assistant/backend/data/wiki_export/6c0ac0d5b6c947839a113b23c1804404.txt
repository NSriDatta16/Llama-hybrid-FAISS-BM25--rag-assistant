Parc Festyland is a relatively small theme park situated within the Caen ringroad (A13/A84) in Lower Normandy, France. Sometimes referred to as being in Carpiquet in Greater Caen, the theme park receives approximately 110,000 visitors a year.

Background

Parc Festyland is a true theme park as it has a central unifying theme in accordance with which the whole park - from rides to restaurants to surroundings - is built. The theme of Parc Festyland 
is the 1066 era. Being a family theme park, it concentrates on the architecture and personalities of the time. The park's logo is a friendly, young-looking dragon's head sporting a Viking hat and a large grin.

Visiting Figures
In 2005, the park received 110,000 visitors, compared to Caen's five museums which received 550,000 visitors between them (source: Caen tourist office).

Advertising
Parc Festyland runs an advertising campaign in association with the Caen tourist office. In all language versions of the booklet, the first inner page is a full colour advert for the park. It consists of the Parc Festyland name and logo, the catchphrase ("defiez le!!!"), contact details (website address and phone number), and two pictures of females appearing to enjoy themselves at the park, with a large rollercoaster in the background.

Catchphrase
The park's motto is DÃ©fiez le!. The English version of the Caen tourist office booklet translates this phrase as 'brave it'. It refers to braving the main attraction (a 59 second long roller coaster).
