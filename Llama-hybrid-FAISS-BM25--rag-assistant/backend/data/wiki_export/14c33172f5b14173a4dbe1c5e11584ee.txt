The Buffalo Stampede were a Roller Hockey International team based in Buffalo, New York that was founded in the second season of the RHI. The team played at the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium from 1994 to 1995.  The team won the 1994 RHI Murphy Cup.

On September 2, 1994, the Stampede won the Murphy Cup in their inaugural season with an 8-7 win against the Portland Rage in front of a record-setting 14,175 hometown fans at the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium.

The team folded after the 1995 season. The Phoenix Cobras moved to the Albany area and assumed all of the Stampede's player contracts. They then changed their name to the Empire State Cobras and split their games between Albany and Glens Falls, NY. The team was purchased and relocated to Buffalo where it played three more seasons as the Buffalo Wings.
