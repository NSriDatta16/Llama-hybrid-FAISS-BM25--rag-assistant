It is sited  northwest of  (High Level), measured via Singer and Maryhill, between Alexandria and Dalreoch, on the line to Balloch.

History
It was opened in July 1850 by the Caledonian and Dumbartonshire Junction Railway on its line from  (on the north bank of the River Clyde) to . Through running to Glasgow did not commence until 1858, when the Glasgow, Dumbarton and Helensburgh Railway was opened; before this travellers had to transfer to steamships at Bowling to continue their journey southwards. The line through the station used to be double, but was reduced to single track around 1986.

The station buildings have now been taken over by Strathleven Artizans to become one of many taking part in ScotRail's Adopt a Station. The official opening was on 27 March 2010. A heritage centre has been created in a tribute to Robert the Bruce.
