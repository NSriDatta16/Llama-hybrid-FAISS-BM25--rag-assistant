The World Series of Darts was a professional darts tournament held from 19 to 21 May 2006 at the Mohegan Sun Casino, in Uncasville, Connecticut. It was the first and only edition of the competition, which was established by the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) to capitalise on the potentially large North American market. It was the second of four PDC non-ranking events in the 2006 season and featured 32 players: 16 American entrants and 16 PDC players. There was a $1,000,000 bonus to the winner of the tournament if they were from the United States.

Phil Taylor, the 13-time world champion, defeated Adrian Lewis 13 legs to five (13–5) in the final, which was the latter's first appearance in the final of a major broadcast tournament. Before his match with Lewis, Taylor defeated qualifier Tim O'Gorman in the first round, Terry Jenkins in the second round, Mark Dudbridge in the quarter-finals and Ronnie Baxter in the semi-finals. John Part, the two-time world champion, made the tournament's highest checkout, a 161 in leg seven of his first round loss to qualifier and American number one John Kuczynski.

Background and format

The World Series of Darts was announced in The New York Times as a "made-for-television darts championship" in October 2005. It was launched in early 2006 by sports promoter and Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) chairperson Barry Hearn, and executive producer Michael Davies. This was done because North America was possibly a large market for darts. The tournament was held from 19 to 21 May 2006, in Uncasville, Connecticut, and was the second of four non-ranking PDC-sanctioned events in the 2006 season. It was the only edition of the competition, which became the US Open in 2007. The competition featured a 32-player main draw held at the Mohegan Sun Casino.

A total of 16 PDC players automatically qualified for the tournament based on their positions in the PDC world rankings following the 2006 PDC World Darts Championship. There were 16 seeds: Colin Lloyd, the world number one, was the first seed and Phil Taylor, the 13-time world champion, was seeded second. There were 12 places decided by a series of qualifying rounds held between 4 February and 19 April at various locations across the United States. The remaining 4 spots were decided in a competition which took place at the Mohegan Sun Resort on 19 May. The maximum number of legs played in a match increased from 11 in the first and second rounds to 17 in the quarter-finals and 21 in the semi-finals, leading up to the best-of-25 legs final.

The tournament was broadcast in the United States on ESPN and ESPN2 as a series of eight one-hour highlight programmes through July to September 2006. In the United Kingdom, Sky Sports broadcast a weekly highlights programme of the event from August to October.

Prize fund
The event had a total prize fund of $300,000 for all PDC entrants; a special $1,000,000 bonus was put up for an American champion because of British dominance in world darts. A PDC player would earn $100,000 for winning the event. The breakdown of prize money is shown below:

The qualifying events were staged as single-elimination tournaments and featured a total prize fund of $9,600; $800 was available for each competition. All fixtures was best-of-seven legs with the players throwing for the bullseye ring to determine who would play first should a match enter a seventh, game-ending leg. There were four seeds given to the four highest-ranked participants at each competition, based on the Bull's Eye News Pro Rankings.

The two-stage Mohegan Sun tournament "Friday Night Madness" was held late on 19 May. Players had to be citizens of the United States and aged 21 or over; those who were in a previous qualifier could enter. A total of 256 competitors played within a 32-board setup in the arena. The first stage saw players attempt to achieve as low a score as possible in the fewest number of throws. The 16 players with the lowest overall scores including tiebreaks advanced to stage two, which was a single-elimination, bracket system and best-of-seven leg matches with no seeds. The four winners of stage two qualified for the main draw.
