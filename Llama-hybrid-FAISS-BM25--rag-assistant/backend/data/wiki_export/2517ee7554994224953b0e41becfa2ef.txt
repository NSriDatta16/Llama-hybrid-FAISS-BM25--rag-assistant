The oldest traces of life on Balkan Peninsula were discovered in the area, proofs of human presence from the Paleolithic were discovered in Bacho Kiro cave near Dryanovo monastery, situated in the Andaka river valley. Numerous relics of ancient villages, fortresses, pillars with inscriptions and ornaments from Thracian and Roman times (Boruna and Diskoduratera fortresses) were discovered there.
