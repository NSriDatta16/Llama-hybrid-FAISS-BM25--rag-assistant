Oakland Raiders

At the start of his second season, the emergence of other young defensive ends made him expendable in the eyes of Raiders management. He was traded to the Dallas Cowboys on August 31, 2003, in exchange for a 2004 7th round draft choice (#223-Jacques Reeves) and a 2005 6th round pick (#185-Chad Owens).

In 2005, he started five of the 12 games he appeared in, posting 17 tackles (one for loss), a half sack and one quarterback pressure.

In 2006, he registered 32 tackles (one for loss), 4 sacks, one quarterback pressure, 4 passes defensed and a forced fumble. He spent four seasons with the Cowboys as a reserve, recording 68 tackles and 6.5 sacks. He played in a 4–3 defense in his first two years, before the Cowboys switched to a 3–4 defense in 2005.

New York Jets

On April 25, 2009, he was traded to the Cleveland Browns along with Brett Ratliff, Abram Elam, a first round pick (#17-Josh Freeman) and a second round pick (#52-David Veikune), as part of a trade to acquire the fifth overall pick in the 2009 NFL Draft to select Mark Sanchez.

Cleveland Browns

On July 30, 2011, after losing Stephen Bowen in free agency and hiring his former Browns defensive coordinator Rob Ryan, the Cowboys signed him as a free agent to a 2-year contract worth $3.75 million. During his second stint with the Cowboys, he was named the starter at left defensive end, and his physical size and strength was used to improve the team's run defense, starting 15-of-16 games, while making 44 tackles (tenth on the team), one sack, 5 tackles for loss (fifth on the team), 2 passes defensed and 4 quarterback pressures.

In 2012, his season ended early with a torn triceps in his left arm (suffered against the Philadelphia Eagles) that required season-ending surgery, he finished with 5 starts (missed two games with a knee injury), 22 tackles, 2 quarterback pressures and one forced fumble.
