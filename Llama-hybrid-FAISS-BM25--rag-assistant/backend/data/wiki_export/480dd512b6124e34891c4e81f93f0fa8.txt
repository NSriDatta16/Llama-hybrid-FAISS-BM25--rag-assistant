History 
The squadron was created on June 13, 1948, for transportation purposes. 

The squadron first operated transport aircraft such as the C-46 Commandos, L-049 Constellations and Douglas C-54 Skymaster. It flew under the cover of a fake airliner company called Lineas Aereas de Panama. It first participated in Operation Balak in 1948. 

The squadron was disbanded in June 1949. The squadron's aircraft were transferred to an airliner company called Arkia Airlines. 

It was reformed on June 11, 1982, and fought in the 1982 Lebanon War. Since the Lebanon War, the squadron is credited with five aerial victories from 1982 to 1985. The squadron's F-15s flew combat air patrols during Desert Storm to screen possible air attacks from the Iraqi Air Force.
