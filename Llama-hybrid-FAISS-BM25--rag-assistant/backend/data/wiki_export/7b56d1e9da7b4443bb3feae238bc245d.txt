Coat of arms

First mentioned in 1849, the flag or coat of arms shows elk horns in gold with ten red flames along the horns tips with a bigger red flame over the head, on a black background.
Originally made in 1843, the coat of arms comes from an idea of St. Idda von Fischingen, whose church choir had the symbol of an elk with flaming horns. This goes back to around 1812 when the church was inaugurated. The oldest coat of arms still intact hangs in the old guardhouse from Bauen to see.
