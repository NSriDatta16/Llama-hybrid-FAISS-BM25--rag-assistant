The title track was originally released on the 2003 album Sunrise Over Sea, as was the original version of "Treat Yo Mama"; while "Pickapart" was included on the JBT EP. It is also featured in the movie 'In Her Skin' directed and written by Simone North and released in 2009.

The release includes a version of "Betterman" which is a previously unreleased re-recorded version with John Butler's current band, "Treat Yo Mama" is also a previously unreleased country funk version that was recorded during the '"Betterman" (US Version)' sessions. "Across the Universe" is the John Butler Trio's take on the Beatles Classic.
