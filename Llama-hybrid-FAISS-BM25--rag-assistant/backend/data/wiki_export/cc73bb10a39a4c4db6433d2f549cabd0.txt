Time Passages is the eighth studio album by Al Stewart, released in September 1978. It is the follow-up to his 1976 album Year of the Cat. The album, like 1975's Modern Times and 1976's Year of the Cat, was once again produced by Alan Parsons. The album's title track (which, when edited, reached #7 on the Billboard charts) and "End of the Day" were both co-written by Peter White. The title track also reached #1 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary charts for 10 weeks.

A digitally remastered version of the album was released in 2004.

Artwork
The album's front and back cover were designed by Hipgnosis. As Storm Thorgerson stated in For the Love of Vinyl: The Album Art of Hipgnosis, "For Al's Time Passages we showed a radio being tuned on the shelf of a kitchen window but at the same time "tuning" the view of the landscape outside the window". The front cover photograph was taken at Indian Route 42, Monument Valley, Arizona.

Historical references 
"A Man For All Seasons" refers to Sir Thomas More, statesman under Henry VIII of England (misidentified by Stewart as "Henry Plantagenet") and a Catholic martyr.
"The Palace of Versailles", the former residence of the French Kings and a key site in early days of the French Revolution. The lyrics contain specific allusions to many events and figures of the revolution.
"Life in Dark Water" – references the Mary Celeste, questioning the usage of the inaccurate term "Marie Celeste".  (Also see J. Habakuk Jephson's Statement)
