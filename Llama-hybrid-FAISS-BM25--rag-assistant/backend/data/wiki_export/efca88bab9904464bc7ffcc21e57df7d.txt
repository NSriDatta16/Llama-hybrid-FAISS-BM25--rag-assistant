Georg Branting (21 September 1887 – 6 July 1965) was a Swedish Social Democrat and Olympic fencer. He was the son of Hjalmar Branting and Anna Branting, and a member of the Riksdag 1932–1961.

In the Spanish Civil War, a Scandinavian battalion of the International Brigades was named after him, as a sign of thanks for his vehement support of the Spanish Republic. Related to the Civil War of Finland in 1918, he wrote a book translated in 1925 in Finnish as: Oikeudenkäyttö Suomessa, Muutamia asiakirjoja selityksineen. He competed for Sweden in fencing at the 1908 and 1912 Summer Olympics.
