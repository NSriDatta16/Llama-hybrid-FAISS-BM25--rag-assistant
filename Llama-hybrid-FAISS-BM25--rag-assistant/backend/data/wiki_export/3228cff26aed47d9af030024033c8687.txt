Track listing

Notes
 The track listing on the back cover of the CD is incorrect. "Rhydin" is track 6, while "Parting Visions" and "Once a Dream" are shifted down once each. The track listing shown here is the correct version, which is listed in the liner notes.
 The title of track 6 is a reference to the fantasy role-playing world, RhyDin.
