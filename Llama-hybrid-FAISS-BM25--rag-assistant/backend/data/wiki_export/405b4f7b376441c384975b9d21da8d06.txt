Delray Beach Tennis Center is a tennis center  in Delray Beach, Florida.  Built in 1992, the stadium (part of the tennis center) currently holds 8,200 spectators. It currently hosts the Delray Beach Open.

It has hosted Fed Cup and Davis Cup matches. 

In 2006, the Palm Beach Phantoms indoor football team planned on playing there, which would have made the Tennis Center the first outdoor facility to host the normally indoor sporting event. However, no agreement was made with the team, which forced the Phantoms to play all of its games on the road. The team folded after the 2006 season with a record of 1â€“6.
