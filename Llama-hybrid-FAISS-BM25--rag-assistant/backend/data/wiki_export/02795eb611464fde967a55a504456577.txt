The American Seasons is an album by Mark O'Connor, recorded with the Metamorphosen Chamber Orchestra, conducted by Scott Yoo. It is composed of three original orchestral works by O'Connor. First is his piece for violin and orchestra, "The American Seasons" loosely structurally based upon Vivaldi's "The Four Seasons", and is conceptually a piece on American life, grounded in American folk music. "Strings & Threads Suite" follows, which traces O'Connor's "version of how folk music on the violin evolved in America" (liner notes) through thirteen pieces in progressively more modern styles. The album concludes with an arrangement of O'Connor's Appalachia Waltz, arranged for orchestra without soloist.
