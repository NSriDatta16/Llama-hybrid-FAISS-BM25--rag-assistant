Jackline Maranga (born 16 December 1977, in Nyanturago, Kisii) is a retired Kenyan middle-distance runner. She won a silver medal at the World Junior Championships at the age of 15, and also won silver medals in the two following Championships, being the only athlete to do so.

She is perhaps best known for winning the 1500 metres gold at the 1998 Commonwealth Games. Together with 10000 metres winner Esther Wanjiru, she became the first Kenyan woman to win Commonwealth Games gold medal.

She is also a world champion in cross-country running as she won the women's short course at the 1999 IAAF World Cross Country Championships.

Maranga is married to Tom Nyariki.
