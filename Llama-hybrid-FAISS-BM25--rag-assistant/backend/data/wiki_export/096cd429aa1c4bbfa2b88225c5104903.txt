Jostedal is a former municipality in the old Sogn og Fjordane county in Norway.  The  municipality existed from 1838 until its dissolution in 1963.  It was located in the Jostedalen valley in the northern part of the present-day municipality of Luster, in Vestland county, north of the village of Gaupne. The administrative centre was also located near the Jostedal Church in the central part of the valley.

History
Jostedal was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1963, Jostedal municipality (population: 796) was merged with the neighboring municipalities of Luster (population: 2,674) and Hafslo (population: 2,384) which created a newer, larger Luster Municipality.

Name
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the Jostedalen valley () since the first Jostedal Church was built there. The first element is  which is the old name for the river Jostedøla. The name comes from the genitive case of the word  which means "yeast". This name is likely due to the fact that the water in the river comes from glaciers and during the summer time the river gets "frothy" or "foamy" due to all of the melting ice and the many waterfalls. The last element is  which means "valley" or "dale".

Geography

The river Jostedøla runs through the valley up to its headwaters at the Jostedalsbreen glacier, a plateau glacier which is the European mainland's largest with an area of . Jostedalsbreen National Park and Breheimen National Park are located on either side of the Jostedalen valley.
