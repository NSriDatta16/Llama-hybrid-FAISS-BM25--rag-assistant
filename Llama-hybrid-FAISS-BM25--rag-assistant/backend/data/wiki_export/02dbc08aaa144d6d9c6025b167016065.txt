"Little Star" is a song recorded by The Elegants. Members Vito Picone and Arthur Venosa co-wrote the lyrics. The music was adapted from "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star". When released as a single in 1958, it topped both the R&B Best Sellers list and the Billboard Hot 100; however, it was the only song that ever charted for The Elegants.  Reportedly, the Elegants refused to pay payola to a prominent New York disc jockey, which inhibited air play of their follow up recordings.

Little Star went on to chart at No.27 on the pop charts, No.2 on rock charts, and No.10 on R&B charts.

"Little Star" remains one of the most popular examples of doo-wop music. Phil Spector described it as an "awful good record". Other artists to record this song include Dion (Runaround Sue), Randy & the Rainbows, The Slades, Vera Lynn, Linda Scott and Bobby Vee.

A small portion of the song was performed by Paul Simon as part of the 1989 Dion song "Written on the Subway Wall."
