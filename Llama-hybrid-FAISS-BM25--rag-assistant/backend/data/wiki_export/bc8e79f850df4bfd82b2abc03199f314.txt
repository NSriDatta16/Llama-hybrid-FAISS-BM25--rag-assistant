Rabbi David Twersky (born October 28, 1940), originally spelled Twerski, is the Grand Rabbi and spiritual leader of the village of New Square, New York, and of Skverer Hasidism worldwide.

Early life
Twersky was born in Iaşi, Romania, in 1940. In 1945, at the end of World War II, his family moved to Bucharest. In 1947, they emigrated to the United States, where they settled in Borough Park, Brooklyn, and later in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Twersky's father, Rabbi Yakov Yosef Twersky, established the all-Hasidic village of New Square in Rockland County in 1954.

Family
At the age of 18, Twersky married Chana Chaya Hager, the elder daughter of the Vizhnitzer Rebbe of Bnei Brak, Israel, Rabbi Moshe Yehoshua Hager. The couple has four sons and three daughters:

Rabbi Aaron Menachem Mendel Twersky is the eldest son of the Skverer Rebbe. He is often sent as an emissary of his father. He married Chavah Reizel, daughter of his uncle, Grand Rabbi Mordechai Hager of Viznitz-Monsey.

As Grand Rabbi
In April 1968, following his father's death, Twersky assumed the leadership of New Square, and of Skverer Hasidim worldwide. According to The Jewish Daily Forward, most New Square residents "revere their rebbe as a Saint, and look to him for guidance on all issues", showing their devotion, singing and praying at his weekly "tish". The Forward also reports that Twersky lights his Hanukkah candles on a large sterling silver menorah that a wealthy follower bought him. He exerts authority through a body of about 15 persons appointed by him, known as "the Kehilla".

Political influence
As in many Hasidic communities, the community in New Square tends to exercise its voting power as a bloc, under the guidance of the Grand Rabbi. He usually supports incumbents or those likely to win, putting the community in a good position to receive government support.

In 1992, New Square voted 822 for President George Bush, to 93 for Bill Clinton. In 1996, voters supported President Clinton over Bob Dole, 1,110 to 31. In 1994, voters backed Mario Cuomo against George Pataki, 907 to 63, and in 1998, voters backed Governor Pataki over Democrat Peter Vallone, 1,132 to 8. In November 2000, vice president Al Gore received more votes than George W. Bush, 1,388 to 25, after Mr. Gore visited Twersky in February of the year. During the 2000 Senate campaign, First Lady Hillary Clinton visited Rabbi Twersky and his wife in New Square, while running for the U.S. Senate, and received nearly 100 percent of the local vote. Twersky was invited to the White House in December 2000 (Hanukkah 5761), and secured commutations for the criminal sentences of four Skver Hasidim, who had been convicted of defrauding the government of more than 30 million dollars to benefit the educational institutions of New Square.

Dismissing allegations of sexual abuse

Rabbi Twersky has been accused by multiple members of his community of dismissing allegations of sexual abuse of children by other community members and even assisting accuse offenders of evading prosecution.
