Charity work
Because of her mother's mental illness, DooLittle entered foster care as a teenager; today, she is working to raise awareness of conditions for foster children:

[M]y real goal is to use my story as an avenue to bring light to the fact that nearly half of all foster kids become homeless once they turn 18 years old. I want to start a movement to revamp the foster care system in America. I want to tell other current and former foster kids that they are not alone. Itâ€™s big. This is my purpose.
