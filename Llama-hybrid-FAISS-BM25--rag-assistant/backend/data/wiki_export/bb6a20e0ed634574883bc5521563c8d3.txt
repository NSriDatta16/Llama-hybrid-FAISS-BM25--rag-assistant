Spencerport High School is the only high school in the Spencerport Central School District, located at 2707 Spencerport Road, in Spencerport, New York, United States. Led by Principal Sean McCabe, the school has over 1200 students and staff and offers a wide variety of courses from Photography to Sports and Entertainment Marketing.

The school is two stories high and has two gymnasiums, two cafeterias, and a pool. The new larger eight-lane pool with a diving area was built in 2008, and is currently finished. A weight room with brand new equipment and an extra practice room used for cheerleading, wrestling, and baseball is also available. In 2003 the school built an auditorium that seats one thousand people, and hosts multiple school and community events. Also recently built was an additional hallway for health, second language, technology, and the academy classes.

Spencerport Academy

Spencerport Academy, the district's alternative high school, opened in September 2003, with 32 students. The Academy is located within Spencerport High School, in the recently built east wing.

The Academy serves 36 students in grades 9–12, and offers Regents-level courses. Students who graduate from the Academy are awarded a Spencerport Diploma, with the appropriate designation. The Academy is an integrated program that is open to students with or without an IEP.

The Academy is staffed by an administrator (Assistant Principal), full-time secretary, guidance counselor, social worker, and five teachers (English, Science, Social Studies, Math, and Special Ed.).

The Academy is a voluntary program for students who are at risk of dropping out or failing. Students must be referred to the program by the IST (Instructional Support Team) in conjunction with building administration. The student spends a day at the Academy, and is accepted or denied enrollment based on input from the student, parent, Academy staff and administration.
