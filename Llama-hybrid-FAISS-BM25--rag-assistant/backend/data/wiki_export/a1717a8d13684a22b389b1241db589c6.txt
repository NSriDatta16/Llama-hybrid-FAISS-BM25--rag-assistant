Rebel Extravaganza is the fourth studio album by Norwegian black metal band Satyricon. It was released in 1999, through Moonfog Productions. In 2021, it was named one of the 20 best metal albums of 1999 by Metal Hammer magazine.

Background 
Satyr viewed Rebel Extravaganza as an album that embodies both inhuman and anti-human characteristics: "The lyrics are very misanthropic and I feel the album itself is quite cold and cynical. It's not that emotional, it's more lifeless in a way."

While the album incorporates industrial elements, Frost contended that this aspect of the album has been overblown: "I don't hear as much of an industrial influence in Satyricon's music...I know that several people found Rebel Extravaganza to have lots of industrial qualities and influences, but I can hear them in very few places, not dominating the album in any way."

On the album, the band have commented that black metal "had come to a point where romance and bloodsucking seemed more important than darkness and extremity".
