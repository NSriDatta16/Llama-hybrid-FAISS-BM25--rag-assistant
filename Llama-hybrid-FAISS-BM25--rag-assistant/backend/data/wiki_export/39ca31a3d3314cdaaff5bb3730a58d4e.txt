Zbrojovka Brno, s.r.o is a maker of small arms in Brno, Czechoslovakia, wholly owned by Colt-CZ Group. In the past it also made light artillery, cars, motorcycles, tractors and various tools, such as typewriters and early computers.

In 1946, Zbrojovka started manufacturing tractors under the brand Zetor (a combination of the letter "Zet" and the word "tractor"). Zetor continues to make tractors as a separate company.

History
The company was founded in 1918 as a state-owned factory known as the State Armament and Engineering Works. The factory assembled German Gewehr 98 and Austrian Mannlicher M1895 rifles, but later began producing their own. In 1924–1925 a new factory was built, where cars, engines and other machines were produced in addition to rifles and machine guns. In the 1930s, the factory also produced Remington licensed typewriters and Skoda tractors.

During the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, Zbrojovka Brno was renamed to Waffenwerke Brunn and produced weapons for the Wehrmacht and the Waffen-SS. In 1944, the factory was severely damaged in the bombing of Brno. After liberation and rebuilding, it resumed production. In the second half of the 1940s, it produced engines, weapons and tractors. In November 1945, a prototype of the Zetor Z-25 tractor was produced, the name Zetor, which was maintained to this day, comes from the words "Zet" (the proclaimed first letter of the armory) and "or" (the end of the word tractor).

In the 1980s, the company refocused mainly on communication and computing technologies at the expense of weapons production and repair. In the 1990s, the number of employees began to decrease. 

From 2003, the company continued to decline; in June 2006, arms production was discontinued. On 8 August 2006, the last employees were made redundant. Shortly after, at the beginning of September 2006, Zbrojovka Brno auctioned machine equipment at public auction. The machines and intellectual property were purchased by Česká zbrojovka Uherský Brod. Česká Zbrojovka restarted rifle manufacturing on a smaller scale. Zbrojovka Brno continues to make hunting rifles to this day as a subsidiary of Colt-CZ.

The 22.5 hectare premises in Brno were auctioned at the end of January 2008 for 707 million CZK (~30 million USD) by the investment company J&T. As of 2023 the area is being re-built by a real estate developer with the intention of building apartment and office buildings.
