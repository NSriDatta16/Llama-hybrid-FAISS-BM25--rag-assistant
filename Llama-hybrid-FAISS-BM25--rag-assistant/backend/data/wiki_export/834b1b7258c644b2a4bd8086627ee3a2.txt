The Beatles began in 1957, when John Lennon formed a skiffle group with his friends called the Quarrymen. The band underwent many name and membership changes, culminating in 1962 with the famous line-up of Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. After the Beatles disbanded in 1970, each of the four members went on to have success, both as solo acts and with their own groups. Although Lennon died in 1980, the remaining Beatles re-united in 1994 to record new songs for the Anthology project. Since Harrison's death in 2001, the two remaining members had not reunited as the Beatles. However, in 2023, it was announced that the pair were finishing an unfinished project from the Anthology era which Harrison was a part of.
