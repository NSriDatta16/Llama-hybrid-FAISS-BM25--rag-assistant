Tara Anglican School for Girls (commonly referred to as Tara) is an independent Anglican single-sex, early learning, primary, secondary, day, and boarding school for girls, located in North Parramatta, a western suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.

Established in 1897, Tara has a non-selective enrollment policy and currently caters for approximately 800 students from early learning, through Kindergarten to Year 12, including 60 boarders from Year 5 to Year 12.

The school is affiliated with the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia (AHISA), the Association of Heads of Independent Girls' Schools (IGSSA), the Independent Primary School Heads of Australia (IPSHA), the Australian Boarding Schools' Association, the Alliance of Girls' Schools Australasia, and is a member of the Association of Heads of Independent Girls' Schools (AHIGS).

Tara's 2010 HSC results ranked the school the number one non-selective school in Sydney's west. In the 2007 NSW Higher School Certificate, the Sydney Morning Herald named Tara the best performing independent school in Sydney’s north-west.

History
The school traces its origins back to 1897, where it is thought to have started with the opening of St. Ronan's School, a Christian, co-educational, primary day school in George Street, Parramatta, by Mary Elizabeth "Joan" Waugh. In 1898, Waugh moved St. Ronan's to an already existing school, The Cedars, in Western Road, Parramatta, in partnership with its incumbent principal, Mrs. Bond. From here, in keeping with Waugh's Anglican vision, the partnership with Bond was dissolved and the school moved to St. John's Parish Hall, Parramatta, in 1902.

When Waugh's father, Isaac Waugh, died in 1912, the school moved to the family home, "Tara", in George Street, Parramatta (demolished in 1963). The name of this property had been chosen years earlier by the Waugh family who, being of Irish background, named it after the Hill of Tara, in Ireland. When Joan Waugh's mother died in 1926, the Tara home was sold, and Tara opened in larger premises at Hassall Street, Parramatta. This was to be Tara's home for the next twenty years and the final move for Joan Waugh. When she died in 1946, the school came under the protection of the Church of England in Australia. All Saints' Church Hall was to be Tara's next home. It is here that it is said that without the help of Paddy Walker and the active participation of a group of parents, the school would not have survived.

On 6 February 1952, 142 junior school boys and girls moved from All Saints', and began school at "Ellangowan", at 153 George Street, Parramatta. In 1953, the school commenced classes for senior school pupils. At this site, Tara grew rapidly, and thus it was determined that another larger premises was required. In Term 3 of 1958, 103 senior school girls commenced at the schools current site at Masons Drive, with a new Headmistress, Helen Claridge. This site had previously been The Smith Family Hospital for Children with Rheumatic Fever. A new Science Block was added in 1959; a library in 1962, and the swimming pool in 1965. Construction of the Tara Junior School, and the first floor extension to the main block commenced in 1969. The girls from the Junior School moved to the Masons Drive buildings late in 1970. Ellangowan was sold in 1969 to fund the construction.

Major building construction has occurred almost every year;  Science and Technology facilities, a Gymnasium and Music Block, Boarding facilities, Cafeteria and Function Area, Senior Learning Centre and in 2011, a new Junior School Library and Technology Centre. The school also runs a Telescope, given to Tara by Katherine Blundell, a professor at the University of Oxford. A team called the Space Odyssey Team is run in conjunction with the telescope, bringing girls and boys all over Sydney to join the team and participate in the program.
