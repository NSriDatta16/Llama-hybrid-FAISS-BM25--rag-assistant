History
The island was historically a part of Strandebarm municipality until 1902 when it was transferred to the new Varaldsøy Municipality.  The island made up the majority of the municipality (plus some of the mainland to the west and north).  In 1965, the municipality of Varaldsøy was dissolved in a period of municipal consolidations in Norway.  The island was then transferred to the municipality of Kvinnherad.
