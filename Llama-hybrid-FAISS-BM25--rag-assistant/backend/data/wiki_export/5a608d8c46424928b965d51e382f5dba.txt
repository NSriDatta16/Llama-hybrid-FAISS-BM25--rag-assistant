Doctor Who Adventures (abbreviated as DWA) was a British magazine devoted to the science fiction television programme Doctor Who. Originally published by Immediate Media Company, the magazine launched in 2006 to accompany the revived era of the show. It featured news, behind-the-scenes articles, comic strips, puzzles, pull-out posters and information from then-upcoming episodes of the series. Every issue also came with a free gift, usually in the form of stickers, stationery or a small toy. The magazine also covered content from the Doctor Who spin-off programme The Sarah Jane Adventures. Compared to its sister publication, Doctor Who Magazine, Doctor Who Adventures was aimed at a younger readership demographic of 6 to 13-year-olds.

Initially released fortnightly, the magazine became a weekly publication in 2008 before a loss in profits forced it to resume its fortnightly release in 2013. After discontinuing its subscription services, DWA became a monthly publication in 2014, and then bi-monthly in 2016. After issue 363, Panini Comics took over publication and 'rebooted' the magazine, re-starting the issue numbering at 1. In June 2017, after releasing 24 issues, Panini confirmed that publication of the magazine would to be paused, however, a special one-off edition was released in January 2019.
