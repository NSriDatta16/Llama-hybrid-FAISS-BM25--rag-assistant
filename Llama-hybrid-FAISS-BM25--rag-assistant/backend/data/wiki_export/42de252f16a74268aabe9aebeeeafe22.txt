Saunderton railway station is a railway station on the A4010 road between High Wycombe and Princes Risborough, in Buckinghamshire, England. It is located near the villages of Bledlow Ridge and Bradenham, and lies on the Chiltern Main Line between  and  stations.

Confusingly, the nucleus of the village of Saunderton, after which the station is named, is about  north of the station and is in fact much closer to the nearby Princes Risborough station. The hamlet immediately around the station is also known locally as Saunderton and is indicated as such on nearby road signs, but it is not named on maps.

History

The station was opened on 1 July 1901.

In March 1913 Suffragettes attacked Saunderton station, burning down the main building. Placards reading "Votes for Women" and "Burning to get the Vote" were left on the platform. They may have chosen Saunderton Station because it is near Benjamin Disraeli's birthplace at Bradenham Manor.

The station was transferred from the Western Region of British Rail to the London Midland Region on 24 March 1974.
