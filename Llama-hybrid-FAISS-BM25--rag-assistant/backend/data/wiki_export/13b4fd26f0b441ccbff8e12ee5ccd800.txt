Chichester station was the Ulster and Delaware Railroad's small station that served the village of Chichester, New York, branch MP 1.6. The old Chichester station was a lot like a small shack with a platform on it that was two miles away from the Phoenicia station, and 29.5 miles from Kingston Point. It had a nearby lumber shoot where wood would be delivered to the furniture factory across the creek. The old station burnt down in 1902, and was replaced with a shelter. It didn't generate much business, and was abandoned after the New York Central bought the U&D in 1932, and it was later scrapped.
