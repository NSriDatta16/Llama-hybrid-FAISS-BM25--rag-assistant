Album videos

The songs "Eleanor Rigby", "Just Hate Me" and "Shut Your Mouth" each have a video.
"Eleanor Rigby" is a cover from The Beatles for which the video is a live performance in a studio.
The video for "Just Hate Me" is about a robot that is forgotten by his maker which starts making another robot and even take parts from the first one to complete the second one.
"Shut Your Mouth" is about an alien that visits the band's frontman, Peter Tägtgren, and tells him to convince the people of his existence; he attempts this, but fails.
