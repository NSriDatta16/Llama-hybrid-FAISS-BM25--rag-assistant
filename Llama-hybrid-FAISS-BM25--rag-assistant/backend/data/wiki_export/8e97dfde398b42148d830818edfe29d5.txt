Priscilla Dean (November 25, 1896 â€“ December 27, 1987) was an American actress popular in silent film as well as in theatre, with a career spanning two decades.

Biography
Dean made her film debut at the age of fourteen in one-reelers for Biograph and several other studios. She was finally signed on to Universal (then called IMP) in 1911. She soon gained popularity as the female lead in the comedy series of Eddie Lyons and Lee Moran.

She was propelled to stardom after she appeared in The Gray Ghost in 1917. Following this film, she became very successful in her work. However, when the age of sound dawned, Dean's career was severely damaged. She continued to do several low-budget films for minor independent studios during the 1930s, but never regained the popularity she had earned in silent films.

Dean died at her home in Leonia, New Jersey at the age of 91 on December 27, 1987, from injuries related to a fall she had suffered the previous September.

Marriages
The Los Angeles Times reported on October 25, 1918, that Dean was to marry Eddie Rickenbacker, at the time a fighter pilot on the Western Front. There was nothing to Dean's claim that she and the ace of aces had been "affianced for some time." 
She married Wheeler Oakman, who was also under contract at Universal and appeared in The Virgin of Stamboul and Outside the Law with Priscilla. They divorced in 1926.
She married Leslie P. Arnold on October 6, 1928 in Tijuana, Mexico. He was famous as one of the "Around The World Flyers". He was previously married and divorced, and a court ruled that his divorce was invalid, making him a bigamist. A later court decree ruled his divorce valid. Dean and Arnold remained married until his death on March 21, 1961. She had no children.
