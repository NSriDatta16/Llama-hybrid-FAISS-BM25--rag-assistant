Dušan Fitzel (born 15 April 1963) is a Czech football coach and a former player. He is an assistant coach with FC Viktoria Plzeň.

He managed the Malta national team from 2006 to 2009.

Playing career
For the most part of his career Fitzel played in the Czechoslovakian league for Dukla Prague in the position of defensive midfielder. In 158 appearances he scored three goals. In 1992, he left for EPA Larnaca in Cyprus where he had 42 appearances and scored three goals. Fitzel retired from his career as a professional footballer in 1995 for FK Chmel Blšany.

Coaching career
His coaching career Fitzel started with the youth team of SK Slavia Praha. From 1998 to 2005 Fitzel worked within the Football Association of the Czech Republic, coaching teams from U18 to U21 level. His greatest achievement came when with him as assistant coach the Czech U21 team won the European Under-21 Championship in 2002. In January 2006 he was appointed the head coach for Malta as the successor to Horst Heese. His contract was to expire with the end of 2007.

The Maltese national team results under Fitzel were promising, including a 2–1 victory over Hungary (first win for the team in official games since 1993) and a 2–2 draw against the 2002 World Cup bronze medalists Turkey. Fitzel was nicknamed "La Valette" in Malta after the Maltese grandmaster and hero Jean de la Valette. In July 2009 health problems made it necessary to give up the role of manager. 

He is a lecturer in coach education as well as a contributor of articles on football and coaching in Fotbal a trénink.
