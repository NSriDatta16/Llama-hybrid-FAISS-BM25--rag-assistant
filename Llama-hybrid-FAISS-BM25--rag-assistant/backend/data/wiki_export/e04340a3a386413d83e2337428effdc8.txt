The  (PIT-CNT) is a national trade union center in Uruguay. It was founded in 1964 as the  (CNT), but was dissolved, and 18 council members "disappeared", in the wake of a general strike in 1973. Ten years later, in 1983, activities resumed under the name  (PIT), which was then also banned after a general strike in 1984. The union was then restored under the present name in March of 1985.
