The rest of the municipality of Eide, with 504 inhabitants, was merged into the neighboring municipality of Landvik. Later, in 1971, Landvik was incorporated into the municipality of Grimstad.

Name
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old Eide farm () since the first Eide Church was built there. The name is the dative case of the word  which means "isthmus". Tis is because the farm (and church) is located between two bodies of water: the Fosdalskilen and Engekilen.

Government
