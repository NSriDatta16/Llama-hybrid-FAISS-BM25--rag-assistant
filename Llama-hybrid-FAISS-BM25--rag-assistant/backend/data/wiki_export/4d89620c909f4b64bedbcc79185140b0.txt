Pierre Février (21 March 1696 – 5 November 1760) was a French baroque composer, organist and harpsichordist.

Biography 
Born in Abbeville in 1696, he arrived in Paris in 1720 and served as titular organist of two churches on Saint-Honoré street: the Jacobins' church (destroyed at the Revolution) and  Saint-Roch (still standing). Claude-Bénigne Balbastre, who moved to Paris in 1750, was among his pupils and eventually succeeded Février at Saint-Roch. Pierre Février died in Paris on 5 November 1760.

Works 
Two volumes of his harpsichord pieces are extant. The first one is dated 1734 and contains five suites:
 Suite in A major
 Allemande la Magnanime
 Le Concert des Dieux - Double du concert
 La Délectable
 Le Berceau
 La Boufonne ou la Paysanne
 Suite in D minor
 Fugue
 Courante
 Les Plaisirs des Sens
 Le Labyrinthe
 Ariette et doubles
 Suite in B minor
 Fugue
 L'Intrépide
 La Grotesque
 Suite in D major
 Gavotte et doubles
 Le Brinborion
 Le Tendre Language
 Tambourin
 Suite (Festes de Campagne) in C major
 Entrée
 Musette
 2 Menuets
 Le Gros Colas et la Grosse Jeanne

The second volume, composed after 1734 and before 1737, was discovered in the late 1990s in a private collection in Belgium (Arenberg). It contains two harpsichord suites that follow a similar pattern, mixing dances and descriptive pièces de caractère in the typical late Baroque French tradition:

 1st Suite in G Minor
 Les Liens Harmoniques - Rondeau
 La Caressante - Rondeau
 La Fertillante
 La petite Coquette
 Tambourin - Rondeau
 2nd Suite in C Minor
 Allemande
 Les Tendres Tourterelles - Rondeau
 Les Croisades - Rondeau
 Menuet
