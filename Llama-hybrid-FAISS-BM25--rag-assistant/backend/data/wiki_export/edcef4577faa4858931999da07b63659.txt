Motheo (Sesotho, meaning "foundation" or "cornerstone") was, until the municipal elections of 18 May 2011, a district of the Free State province of South Africa. At the time of the 2011 elections it was disestablished as a consequence of Mangaung Local Municipality being upgraded to a metropolitan municipality.

The Motheo District Municipality Head Office was based in Bloemfontein, which also serves as the capital of the Free State Province and as the judicial capital of South Africa.
