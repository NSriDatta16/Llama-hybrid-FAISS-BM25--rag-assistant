Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA) () is a state-owned autonomous body under the administrative control of the Secretary to the Government of Pakistan for Aviation, which oversees and regulates all aspects of civil aviation in Pakistan. PCAA's head office is situated in Terminal-1 of Jinnah International Airport in Karachi. PCAA is a member state of the International Civil Aviation Organization. Nearly all 44 civilian airports in Pakistan are owned and operated by the PCAA.

Organizational structure 
Civil Aviation Authority has been transformed into following divisions:

 Regulatory Division

In this role, the AAIB investigates and reports on aviation accidents and incidents. The investigation board is based in Rawalpindi near Benazir Bhutto International Airport (BBIAP). It has one regional office located in Karachi near Jinnah International Airport (JIAP).

Fake licenses scandal
Ghulam Sarwar Khan addressed Pakistan's National Assembly stating 262 pilots in the country "did not take the exam themselves" and had paid someone else to sit it on their behalf, according to CNN, and added "they don't have flying experience". This accounts for 30% of Pakistani civilian pilots not capable of flying commercial aircraft. The investigation was the preliminary report into a plane crash that killed 97 people in the southern city of Karachi on 22 May.

On 30 June, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) revoked PIA's 'third part authorisation', subsequently banning PIA from flying in European airspace for 6 months from the following day, following multiple safety failings.

Pakistan Civil Aviation Regulatory Authority 
A delinking process to distribute Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) into two separate divisions regulatory and service divisions has been started. The new division would be called Airport Services of Pakistan (ASP).

Pakistan Airports Authority 

The authority will be bifurcated into Pakistan Civil Aviation Regulatory Authority and the Pakistan Airports Authority as per National Aviation Policy 2019.
