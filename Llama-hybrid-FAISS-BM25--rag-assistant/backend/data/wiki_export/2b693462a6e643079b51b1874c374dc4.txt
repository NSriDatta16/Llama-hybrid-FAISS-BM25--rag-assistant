The lingual veins are multiple veins of the tongue with two distinct courses: one group drains into the lingual artery; another group drains either into the lingual artery, (common) facial vein, or internal jugular vein.

Clinical significance 
The lingual veins are important clinically as they are capable of rapid absorption of drugs; for this reason, nitroglycerin is given under the tongue to patients suspected of having angina pectoris.
