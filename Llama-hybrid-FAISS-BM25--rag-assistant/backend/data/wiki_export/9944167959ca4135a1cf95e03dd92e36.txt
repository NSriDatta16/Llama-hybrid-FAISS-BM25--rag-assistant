Seeta Aur Geeta (translation: Seeta And Geeta) is a 1972 Indian Hindi-language comedy drama film, written by Salim–Javed (Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar) and directed by Ramesh Sippy. The film stars an ensemble cast of Hema Malini (in a dual role), Dharmendra, Sanjeev Kumar, Roopesh Kumar, Manorama, Satyen Kappu, Honey Irani, Pratima Devi, Alankar Joshi and Master Ravi with music composed by R.D. Burman.

The story is about identical twins (played by Hema Malini) who are separated at birth and grow up with different temperaments. After they meet each other as adults, they swap places (like The Prince and the Pauper). The two sisters' partners in the film are played by Dharmendra and Sanjeev Kumar, while Manorama plays the villainous aunt.

The theme of the film was inspired by Ram Aur Shyam (1967), which inspired Salim-Javed to write Seeta Aur Geeta. Ram Aur Shyam is itself a remake of the 1964 Telugu film Ramudu Bheemudu. The film subverted the formula by having the heroine eventually become the "hero" while the male lead is in a mostly supporting role. An earlier film with a similar theme was Muqabala (1942), starring Fearless Nadia.

The film became a major hit, both in India and abroad in the Soviet Union. Hema Malini won her only competitive Filmfare Best Actress Award of her career, while K. Vaikunth won the Filmfare Best Cinematographer Award. Malini was noted for the novelty of her role as Geeta, where she is rambunctious and sometimes violent.

The film was remade in other languages, which includes the Telugu film Ganga Manga (1973) and the Tamil film Vani Rani (1974), both starring Vanisri in the dual roles. Subsequent Hindi remakes of the story have been made, including Geeta Mera Naam starring Sadhana Shivdasani, Jaise Ko Taisa starring Jeetendra, ChaalBaaz starring Sridevi, Kishen Kanhaiya starring Anil Kapoor, Judwaa starring Salman Khan, Kuch Khatti Kuch Meethi starring Kajol, in the dual roles.

Plot
Seeta and Geeta (Hema Malini in a dual role) are twin girls who were separated at birth. The long-suffering heiress Seeta is treated worse than a servant by her abusive, money-grubbing aunt Kaushalya (Manorama) and her equally cruel brother Ranjeet (Roopesh Kumar), despite the fact that the family is living off her late parents' money. Seeta's only consolations are her meek uncle Badrinath (Satyen Kappu), old wheelchair-bound grandmother (Pratima Devi) and helpful younger brother (Alankar Joshi). Meanwhile, the feisty Geeta is raised in a poor neighbourhood and is a gutsy street performer.

One day, Seeta decides life is not worthy and runs away from home to commit suicide. She is rescued but is mistaken for her identical twin Geeta and is taken to Geeta's home. Meanwhile, Kaushalya and Badrinath are frantically searching for Seeta and find Geeta. They mistake her for her identical twin Seeta and attempt to force her to go with them, but using some of her clever tricks, Geeta escapes from them and the police who have been searching for her. She then meets Ravi (Sanjeev Kumar), the prospective groom for Seeta and goes home with him, although he also mistakes her for Seeta. Ravi is surprised by this "Seeta" and the Seeta he had met previously.

After ending up at Seeta's house, Geeta realises the cruelty that she has been living under and vows to teach Kaushalya and Ranjeet a lesson for the sake of her grandmother and brother. Meanwhile, the real Seeta is living in Geeta's house where she meets Raka (Dharmendra), Geeta's friend and fellow performer. Raka is also surprised by the sudden gentle nature of "Geeta" and her desire to do the housework. Geeta's foster mother too has attributed Seeta's new docile attitude to shock. When Raka tries to coax Seeta into performing, she is unable to do so. Amidst all this, Raka falls in love with Seeta.

Elsewhere, Ravi falls in love with the real Geeta as well. At home, Geeta begins to set everything on a proper course with the help of her brother. She resumes control of the money and restores her grandmother to the head of the household, where she belongs. However, things take a drastic turn when Ranjeet comes to visit and sees the real Seeta in a marketplace. He follows her and discovers the truth, which leads to a showdown in the villains' den and then marriage.

Production
According to Salim Khan, one half of screenwriting duo Salim–Javed, the concept of Seeta Aur Geeta was inspired by the Dilip Kumar starrer Ram Aur Shyam (1967), but they altered the formula with twin female sisters. Seeta Aur Geeta subverted the formula by having the heroine Hema Malini eventually become the "hero" while male lead Dharmendra is in a mostly supporting role.

Ramesh Sippy initially wanted Nutan as Seeta and Geeta because he "saw the heroine as a mature woman with a child" but he was advised against casting a heroine who was "at a mature phase of her career when the hero, too, was getting along in age." The film was also offered to popular actress Mumtaz, who ironically starred in Ram Aur Shyam, but she refused the offer as she wasn't paid enough. Mumtaz stated in an interview that at the time, the film was offered to her, she was charging Rs 8-8.5 lakhs/film, but she was offered only Rs 2 lakhs for Seeta aur Geeta. So she had to refuse the film. According to Sippy, the film's budget cost  ().
