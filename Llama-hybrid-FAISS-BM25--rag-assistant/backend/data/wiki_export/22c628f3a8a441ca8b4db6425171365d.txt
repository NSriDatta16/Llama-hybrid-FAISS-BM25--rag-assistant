Rendezvous in Paris () is a 1995 French romantic comedy anthology film written and directed by Éric Rohmer.

The film consists of three loosely connected episodes revolving around chance meetings in Paris: "Le Rendez-vous de 7 heures" ("The Rendezvous at 7 P.M."), in which a student discovers her boyfriend is two-timing her; "Les Bancs de Paris" ("The Benches of Paris"), in which an unnamed woman has a series of meetings in parks with a handsome literature teacher from the suburbs; and "Mere et enfant 1907" ("Mother and Child 1907"), which takes its title from a Picasso painting, and centres on an artist who is attracted by a stranger. The three stories of the film are linked by a girl singing in the streets to an accordion accompaniment—a homage to René Clair's Under the Roofs of Paris (1930).
