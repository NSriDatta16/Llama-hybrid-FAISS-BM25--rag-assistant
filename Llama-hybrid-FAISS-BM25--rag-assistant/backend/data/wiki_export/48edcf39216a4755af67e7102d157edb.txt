Financing of the university 
Public universities in Spain occupy a large share of the national budget. Almost 80% of the funding for public universities is borne by the taxpayers, with student fees accounting for most of the remainder of this funding. Universities in Spain do not have final oversight over their funding; this is done by the government which receives, administers, and distributes all sources of revenue.

Financing projects 
The UC3M uses the crowdfunding system to finance its projects. The process usually involves four main steps: Firstly a scientist, student or an alumnus will develop an idea about research, innovation, and/or the diffusion of knowledge. Secondly, they spread this idea via Gotero.org, which is a website where donors can search for and endorse projects listed on the webpage. Thirdly, an interested donor will begin financing a project. Finally, the project reaches sufficient levels of funding, publicity, and related improvements to become reality.

There are several different types of crowdfunding. Rewards-based crowdfunding is when a sponsor funds a project for an incentive or reward in return, generally products or services that result from the project. Equity crowdfunding results in a sponsor receiving some form of equity in return for their investment. Debt-based funding involves a sponsor lending money to the project, with the promise of their investment being returned plus interest. Donation-based crowdfunding involves a donor investing out of altruistic interest, without any interest in financial or material rewards in return.

Crowdfunding has provided opportunities to many people for developing campus projects. At UC3M, Isabel García Gutiérrez, who is the vice-rector of the entrepreneurship and science park, said that the university turned to this system because of its innovative potential. The prior experience of the Polytechnic University of Catalonia's use of the crowdfunding system was also a helpful example to model from.

Financing cultural, sports, and volunteer activities 
The UC3M as with all other public universities received government funding, so students' tuition fees are a small percentage of the actual education costs. However, extra-curricular activities such as cultural, sports and volunteerism activities are not included in the enrollment fees and require additional fees for participation.

UC3M Foundation 
The UC3M Foundation is a private nonprofit organization. Created in 1990, its objectives are the promotion and financing of social, cultural, and scientific activities.

Consists of three large facilities, two in Getafe (Gregorio Peces-Barba and Fernando de los Ríos dormitories) and one in Leganés (Fernando Abril Matorell). All of these facilities are in close proximity to their respective campuses. An increasing number of both foreign students and students from other parts of Spain is rising demand in the residences.

Publications and reports: Study and analyze the impacts in today's world of the different degrees offered by the university.
