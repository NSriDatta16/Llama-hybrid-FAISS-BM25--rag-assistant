The Hungerford Stakes is a Group 2 flat horse race in Great Britain open to horses aged three years or older. It is run at Newbury over a distance of 7 furlongs (1,408 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in August.

History
The event is named after Hungerford, a town located several miles to the west of Newbury. It was established in 1949, and the inaugural running was contested over 1½ miles. The first winner was Star King (later renamed Star Kingdom).

The Hungerford Stakes was formerly held on Newbury's left-handed course, with a distance of about 7 furlongs and 64 yards. For a period it was classed at Group 3 level. It was switched to the straight track in 2002, and promoted to Group 2 status in 2006.
