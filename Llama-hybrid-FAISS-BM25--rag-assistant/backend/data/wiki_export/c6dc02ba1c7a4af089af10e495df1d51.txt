The Saskatchewan Dragoons is a Primary Reserve armoured regiment of the Canadian Army. The unit is based in Moose Jaw. Their primary job is to assist the Regular Force in meeting Canada's military commitments.  Their training and equipment closely follow that of the Regular Force, which the Reserves are called upon to assist increasingly often. The Saskatchewan Dragoons are part of 3rd Canadian Division's 38 Canadian Brigade Group.

Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, became colonel-in-chief of the regiment on visiting Saskatchewan in 2003, when he congratulated the regiment on its "contribution to Canada's proud tradition of citizen-soldiers in the community". Involved in peacekeeping operations in Cyprus, the Golan Heights, Bosnia and Croatia, members of the regiment have also provided aid during floods and forest fires in the prairies.

Role 
Their role is that of a reconnaissance squadron. They examine an area in preparation for the advance of a main body of troops. They go forward, sometimes many miles, and gather information on enemy strength, equipment, movements, and intentions.  They pass this information, together with other helpful information on such things as bridges, blocked roads, and areas of potential danger, back to higher command so the advance can take place as safely as possible. At the same time they deny such information to the enemy. In the withdrawal, they maintain contact with the enemy while the main body pulls back. Thus, they often speak of their role as "first in last out".
