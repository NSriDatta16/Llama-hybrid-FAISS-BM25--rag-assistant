The North Island takahē () (Porphyrio mantelli) is an extinct rail that was found in the North Island of New Zealand.

Description 
This flightless species is known from subfossils from a number of archeological sites and from one possible 1894 record. It appeared to have been even larger than the related South Island takahē (P. hochstetteri) and, if it did survive until the 1890s, would have been the largest rail in historic times.

Taxonomy 
Traditionally the North Island takahē was considered conspecific with the endangered South Island takahē. Trewick (1996) presented evidence that the two taxa were independently derived from flying ancestors, so proved to be separate species.

The binomial of this bird commemorates the naturalist and civil servant Walter Mantell.

Extinction 
The decline of the species has generally been attributed to the increasing incursion of forest into the alpine grasslands through the Holocene, although hunting by the Māori also may have played a big role.
