Lewis Parker is a British hip-hop producer born in London of Barbadian descent, who lived in Canterbury, Kent. As a teenager, Parker released an EP, B Boy Antiks, and a 12" single, Rise/Visions of Splendour, through Bite It! – a London-based recording label. He signed an album deal with Massive Attack's Virgin Records imprint Melankolic who released his first LP, Masquerades & Silhouettes, in 1998, and follow-up album It's All Happening Now four years later, before he went on to produce a number of records for UK hip hop artists such as Jehst, The Sundragon and Champions of Nature. Parker has also been credited for his work with Ghostface Killah on the albums Fishscale and More Fish. 

On September 1, 2009, he released The Rise and Fall of River Nelson with revered American rapper River Nelson, and the album received stellar reviews, with Andy Gill from The Independent writing,  "The Rise and Fall of River Nelson shows River's thoughtful sentiments and positive attitude set to infectious symphonic-soul beats by British producer Lewis Parker." Parker and Nelson then released River's album The Shape of They Sky in October of 2013, with Jamsphere Magazine writing, "It is one of those albums that fascinates you upon first listen and it keeps you hooked until the end."

In 2010, Parker also released a critically acclaimed album with American MC John Robinson called International Summers.
