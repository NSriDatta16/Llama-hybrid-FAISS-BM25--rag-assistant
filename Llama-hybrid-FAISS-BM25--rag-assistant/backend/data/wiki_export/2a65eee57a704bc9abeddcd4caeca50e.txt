Archery

France sent eight archers in its third Olympic archery appearance, all of whom won at least three medals. The team ended up with one gold medal, four silvers, and a bronze. Because of the lack of competition, the team's worst possible result would have been five silvers and a bronze; thus, Brulé's victory over Belgium's van Innis in the individual moving bird at 50 metres to take the gold medal was the only actual success the team had.

Aquatics

Diving

A single diver represented France in 1920. It was the nation's debut appearance in the sport. Weil came in last in his springboard semifinal group and did not advance to the final.

 Men

Swimming

Thirteen swimmers, ten men and three women, represented France in 1920. It was the nation's fourth appearance in the sport. None of the swimmers were able to advance to an event final.

Ranks given are within the heat.

 Women

Water polo

France competed in the Olympic water polo tournament for the third time in 1920. A modified version of the Bergvall System was in use at the time. France was defeated by Brazil in the opening round, not qualifying for either the silver or bronze tournaments.

 Final rank 11th

Athletics

59 athletes represented France in 1920. It was France's sixth appearance in athletics, having competed in the sport at every Olympics. Guillemot took the nation's first Olympic gold medal in athletics by winning the 5,000 metres. He also added a silver in the 10,000 while the team took two more medals in the relay events.

Ranks given are within the heat.

Boxing 

15 boxers represented France at the 1920 Games. It was the nation's second appearance in boxing. The team won three medals, including one of each type, after four of the 15 men advanced to the semifinals. The two French featherweight boxers faced off in the finals, taking gold and silver. The bronze came in the heavyweight class. France, which had not won a single bout in 1908, took fourth place on the boxing medals leader board.

Cycling

Thirteen cyclists represented France in 1920. It was the nation's fifth appearance in the sport. After a disappointing result in 1912, the French road cyclists had a better Games in 1920. The four-man team took the gold medal in the team time trial, on the strength of three top-10 individual performances including Canteloube's individual bronze. The track cyclists were unable to take a medal, with highlights including Lanusse reaching the semifinals of the sprint and Alancourt taking eighth in the 50 kilometres.

Equestrian

Twenty-four equestrians represented France in 1920. It was the nation's third appearance in the sport, having been one of three countries (along with Belgium and the United States) to have appeared at each Olympic equestrian competition. For the first time, France earned no gold medals in equestrian. The best results for the country were in vaulting with a pair of silvers, one by Field in the individual and one by the team in combined score.

Fencing

Eighteen fencers represented France in 1920. It was the nation's fourth appearance in the sport, and first since 1908. France, as usual, had a strong performance in the sport. The French épéeists swept the individual medals for the second time (having accomplished the feat in 1908 as well), and the foilists took a silver and a bronze. France took a medal in each of the three team events, but won no more gold medals. The team's eight total medals were the most of any nation in 1920, and the gold medal in the épée made France one of only two nations to win any golds (Italy took the other five).

Ranks given are within the group.

Field hockey

France competed in field hockey for the second time. The team took fourth place in the four-team round robin, losing to each of the other three teams.

Football

France competed in the Olympic football tournament for the third time. After receiving a bye into the quarterfinal, which was awarded as a 2–0 victory due to Switzerland withdrawing the morning before the first round due to internal dissent, France defeated Italy to move into the semifinals. The team was defeated there by Czechoslovakia. Under the Bergvall System in use for the tournament, France would still have gad the opportunity to play for the silver medal; however, the team left host nation Belgium after their semifinal loss and did not play in the tournament for second place.

Gymnastics

Twenty-nine gymnasts represented France in 1920. It was the nation's fifth appearance in the sport, matched only by Great Britain. France took three medals, a silver and two bronzes.

Artistic gymnastics

Ice hockey

France competed in the inaugural Olympic ice hockey tournament. The team received a bye into the semifinals, but was defeated by Sweden there. Under the Bergvall System in place at the time, Sweden's losses in the gold medal final and the silver medal semifinals meant that France played no further; a far different fate from the other semifinal loser—the United States, who won the silver medal.

Figure skating

Two figure skaters represented France in 1920. It was the nation's debut appearance in the sport. The Sabourets finished in seventh place of eight in the pairs.

France took a single medal: Johnson's silver in the 300 metre military rifle prone position.

Tennis

Ten tennis players, seven men and two women, competed for France in 1920. It was the nation's fifth appearance in the sport, tied with Great Britain for the most of any country. Lenglen won the women's singles gold, not losing a single game until her fourth match and not losing any of her ten sets. Lenglen also paired with Décugis to take the gold in the mixed pairs, and added a bronze medal in the women's pairs with D'Ayen. Décugis and Albarran won the bronze in the men's pairs, beating Blanchy and Brugnon in the bronze medal match.

Weightlifting

Ten weightlifters, two in each weight class, represented France in 1920. It was the nation's debut appearance in the sport. Cadine and Gance won their weight classes, making France the only country that year to take two championships. France tied Belgium for most total medals, with three.

Wrestling
