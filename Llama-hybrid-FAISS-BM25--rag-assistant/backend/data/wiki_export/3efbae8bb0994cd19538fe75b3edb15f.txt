The roadway continues east as County Road 800N, which becomes McGalliard Road, in Delaware County, before becoming SR 332 at an interchange with Interstate 69.

No segment of State Road 128 in Indiana is included in the National Highway System (NHS).  The NHS is a network of highways that are identified as being most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation.  The highway is maintained by the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) like all other state roads in the state. The department tracks the traffic volumes along all state roads as a part of its maintenance responsibilities using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). This measurement is a calculation of the traffic level along a segment of roadway for any average day of the year. In 2010, INDOT figured that lowest traffic levels were 1,200 vehicles and 110 commercial vehicles used the highway daily west of Frankton. The peak traffic volumes were 3,490 vehicles and 150 commercial vehicles AADT along the section east of Frankton.
