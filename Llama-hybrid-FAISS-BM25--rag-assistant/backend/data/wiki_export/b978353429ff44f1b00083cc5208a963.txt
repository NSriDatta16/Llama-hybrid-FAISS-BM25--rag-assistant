This is a list of the bird species recorded in the archipelago of Puerto Rico, which consists of the main island of Puerto Rico, two island municipalities off the east coast (Vieques and Culebra), three uninhabited islands off the west coast (Mona, Monito and Desecheo) and more than 125 smaller cays and islands.

The avifauna of Puerto Rico included a total of 385 species as of July 2022, according to Bird Checklists of the World. Of them, 201 are accidental, two have been extirpated, and one is believed to be extinct. Seventeen species are endemic. Non-native species are common; 43 listed here were introduced by humans. Individuals of many other species (mostly parrots, finches, and waxbills) are flying free, presumably after escaping or being released from captivity. For example, a 2018 study on introduced Psittacidae on the island found at least 46 species present, of which 24% are only found in the pet trade (captivity), 48% have been observed in the wild (but are not known to be breeding), and 28% are established (naturalized) and know to have bred or are currently breeding. Around 120 species breed in Puerto Rico while the majority of the others overwinter in the archipelago.

This list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the Check-list of North and Middle American Birds, 7th edition through the 63rd Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the Check-list, except that the common names of families are from the Clements taxonomy because the AOS list does not include them.

The following tags have been used to highlight several categories of occurrence:

 (A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Puerto Rico
 (E) Endemic - a species endemic to Puerto Rico
 (Ex) Extirpated - a species that no longer occurs in Puerto Rico although populations exist elsewhere
 (I) Introduced - a species introduced to Puerto Rico as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions
