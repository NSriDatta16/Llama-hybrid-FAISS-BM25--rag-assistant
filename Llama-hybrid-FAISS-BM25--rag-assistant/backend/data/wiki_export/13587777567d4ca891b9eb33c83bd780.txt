The Parliamentary Secretary to the Local Government Board was, from 1871 â€“ 1919, a junior ministerial post in the United Kingdom subordinate to the President of the Local Government Board.  The Local Government Board itself was established in 1871 and took in supervisory functions from the Board of Trade and the Home Office, including the Local Government Act Office that had been established by the Local Government Act 1858. 

The position was abolished in June 1919, following the First World War, and the duties transferred to the new position of Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Health.
