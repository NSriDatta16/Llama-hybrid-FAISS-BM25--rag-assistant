Doodle Do is a British 2006 arts and crafts television programme, specially designed for pre-school children (2 to 5 years). It aired on the CBeebies channel between 2006 and 2010. The programme features three "Doodle Doers" — puppets called "Dib-Dab", "Scribble" and "Stick" — who interact with a human presenter, Chris (played by Chris Corcoran, a Welsh stand-up comedian). The programme first aired on 30 January 2006 on the CBeebies channel at 9am and again at 1pm and 5pm Local Time.

Format
Dib-Dab, Scribble and Stick are three literal glove hand creatures, as they consist of colourful knitted gloves decorated with eyes, noses, and hair. They are each operated by three puppeteers who remain concealed behind features of the studio set, such as curtains or boxes, or beneath the raised studio floor. One episode was filmed in the French Ski Resort of 'Les Deux Alpes'.

The programme is a loose "how to" arts feature similar to SMarteenies, but aimed at an even younger audience. Chris and the puppets explore making models from boxes, simple collages and so on. A story or game is featured, during which the puppets play characters using the items they have created.

The programme always ends with some "Doodle do" and "Doodle don't" advice, such as "Doodle do: have fun with your model car, and doodle don't: forget to tidy up afterwards".

There are also small 5-minute portions of the show called "Doodle Do Making Moments" which are broadcast. These feature one "make" and do not have much of a storyline.

The three puppets all still have distinctive personalities. Dib-Dab (voiced by Yvonne Stone) is giddily enthusiastic, concerned for others and loves the colour pink so much, that whenever it seems someone else is going to get the pink paper, she will whimper with misery and longing; Scribble (voiced by Adam Carter) is a bit of a comedian with a fondness for puns; and Stick (voiced by Mark Mander) is rather anxious (similar to George from Rainbow, whom Mark Mander has also "played"), and often needs to be reassured by Chris. Stick enjoys chanting the word "Blob" whilst painting or glueing, and seems to get into a trance-like state doing so. After the children making clips, Dib-Dab, Scribble and Stick sit by the treasure chest, the treasure chest will open and an animation about sandworms drawing an object features in each episode.
