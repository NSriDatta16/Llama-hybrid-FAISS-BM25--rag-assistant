The International Skating Union has organised the European Speed Skating Championships for Women since 1970, but they were discontinued after the 1974 tournament because of lack of interest. The European Championships for Women were reinstated in 1981.

History

Distances used
 In the years 1970–1982, four distances had to be skated: 500 m – 1,000 m – 1,500 m – 3,000 m (the mini combination).
 From 1983 to 2017, four distances had to be skated: 500 m – 1,500 m – 3,000 m – 5,000 m (the small combination).
