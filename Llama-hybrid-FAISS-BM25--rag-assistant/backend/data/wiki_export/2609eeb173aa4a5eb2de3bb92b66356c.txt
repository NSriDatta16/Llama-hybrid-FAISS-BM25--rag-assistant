From Lisa Paul Streitfeld's review in NY Arts of Thomas McEvilley's new book: The Triumph of Anti-Art: Conceptual and Performance Art in the Formation of Postmodernism: 

"...Mark Kostabi's cynical conceptual art performance piece on his Manhattan cable television show where he invites critics to title his non-art objects (which proclaim their sole importance in not being painted by the artist).  Those who once had a crucial role as adversary are now participants in the celebrity-obsessed shadow that has swallowed up authenticity in art.  Kostabi has taken out a full-page ad in Art Forum as proof of this public triumph of the inauthentic.  Is this public undermining of the critical apparatus the logical conclusion of Anti-Art?"
