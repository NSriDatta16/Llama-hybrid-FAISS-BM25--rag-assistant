Now That's Awesome is a 2000 comedy album by comedian Bill Engvall. It was his only release for BNA Records.

The album includes the musical tracks "Now That's Awesome" and "Shoulda Shut Up", with guest vocals from T. Graham Brown, Neal McCoy and Tracy Byrd on the former, and Julie Reeves on the latter. These cuts respectively reached 59 and 71 on the Hot Country Songs charts, although Reeves did not receive chart credit for her song.

Engvall said that he chose to sign to BNA Records due to managerial changes at Warner Bros. He thought that it was "the best comedic album" that he had done.
