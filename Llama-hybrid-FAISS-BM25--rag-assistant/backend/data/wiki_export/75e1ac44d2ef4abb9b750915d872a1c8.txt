Hekurudha Shqiptare or HSH (Albanian Railways) is the state-owned operator of the Albanian railway system and became a private company in 2005. The system's main passenger terminal was Durrës railway station in the port city of Durrës.

HSH's infrastructure used to run east to Pogradec (up to Librazhd ), south to Vlorë and north to Shkodër. There was also a branch line to the capital Tirana (up to Kashar, 10 km away ). The network was extended beyond Shkodër in the 1980s into what is now Montenegro, via the Albanian border town of Hani i Hotit. But this section of the system is for freight only. There is also no physical rail connection between Albania and neighbouring North Macedonia or Greece.

The HSH network was entirely unelectrified, and trains were hauled by Czechoslovak T-669 diesel-electric locomotives. The system was basically single-track throughout, with passing loops at various points. Second-hand passenger rolling stock from Germany's DB and former DR, Italy's FS, Austria's ÖBB, and Poland's PKP was used. Trains suffered internal and external damage from vandalism, including the stoning of locomotives and carriages. Further problems arose from landslide damage to sections of the track or because lengths of rail were stolen for iron scrap. As of 2023 the system is barely surviving with an Elbasan Durrës train and a Shkoder Lac train that lasts until June 13, although there are some plans to rehabilitate parts of the network in the future.

Recent upgrades and new lines

Tirana-Rinas-Durres Railway Line 
Construction work to upgrade the Durrës–Tiranë line and linking it with Rinas Airport with Electric -powered trains started in 2021 with a loan from EBRD.

Proposed Prishtina-Durrës Railway Line

Approval given by the Albanian and Kosovo governments in 2021 to a feasibility study of a Prishtina-Durrës route to be undertaken in 2022.

Passenger services

In 2015, some rail stations and rolling stock along the Durres-Tirane line were renovated and adopted a red and white livery. The scenic Librazhd-Pogradec line was closed for passenger traffic in 2012. The stored locomotives and carriages from Prrenjas are being moved to Elbasan. As a result, this section may be dismantled, as it doesn't link any major cities.

There are several freight-only branch lines. Occasional freight trains may run between Podgorica and Shkodër and between Durrës and the oil refinery at Ballsh. The Tirana-Shkodër line is closed, except for the Durrës Elbasan train and a section between Shkodër and Lac.
