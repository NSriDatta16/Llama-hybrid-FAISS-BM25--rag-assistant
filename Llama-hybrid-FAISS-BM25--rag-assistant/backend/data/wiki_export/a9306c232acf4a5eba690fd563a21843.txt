Empolis Information Management GmbH is a software company specializing in content management and knowledge management with focus on "smart information management".

History 
Founded in 1986 as EPS (printing systems) Bertelsmann, a subsidiary of MohnDruck GmbH in Guetersloh, Germany. In 2000, the company was renamed to Empolis as a result of a merger of four German software companies (EPS, Step, Tecinno, Schnittstelle). In April 2009, Empolis GmbH, Living-e and Attensity Corporation joined forces to become the Attensity Group.

As of May 2010, Living-e and Empolis are doing business under the name Attensity Europe GmbH. In June 2012, the former “Enterprise Solutions” division of Attensity Europe GmbH, spun off and became a legally independent company called “Empolis Information Management GmbH”.
