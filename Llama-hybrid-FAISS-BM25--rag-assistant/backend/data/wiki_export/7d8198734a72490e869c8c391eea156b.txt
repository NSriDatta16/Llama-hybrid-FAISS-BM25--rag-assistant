History
The history of Aruanã began with the building of a military fort in 1849 at the point where the Rio Vermelho enters the Rio Araguaia.  The region was occupied by the Carajá Indians.  The fort was called Leopoldina and later Santa Leopoldina.  In 1868 the first steam boats appeared on the Araguaia and the settlement was a major port.  In 1939 the name was changed to Aruanã, a native fish and the dance of the local Indians, and the village became a district in the municipality of Goiás.  In 1958 it became an independent municipality.
