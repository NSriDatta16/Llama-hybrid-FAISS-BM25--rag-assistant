As state representative
Maybe there's some way you can teach somebody to manage a child who can't be managed at home, but I don't know what it is. – Carl N. Gunter Jr.

In 1991, Louisiana State Senator Allen Ray Bares (pronounced BAH REZ) of Lafayette sponsored a bill to outlaw most abortions in Louisiana. The National Organization for Women's national secretary, Kim Gandy, originally from Bossier City, directed a nine-month-long "grassroots organizing and recruiting effort" against the bill. In a debate over the bill's provision regarding incest, Gunter stated that "That's how we get thoroughbred race horses." Gunter's advocates argue that he was asserting that fetuses conceived within an incestuous relationship should also have a right to life. The comparison with race horses, however, was used against him by his opponents.

Gunter already had a longtime contentious relationship with the local press. Former colleague Claude "Buddy" Leach of Leesville, who delivered Gunter's eulogy, told how Gunter once threatened Governor Edwin Washington Edwards into removing businessman Joe D. Smith Jr., then publisher of the local newspaper, Alexandria Daily Town Talk from the LSU Board of Supervisors.

The result of it all was that both Gunter and Bares were defeated.

The Feminist Majority Foundation wrote in the 1991 edition of Feminist Chronicles that the defeats of Bares and Gunter were "among the sweetest victories" of the year. Gunter's choice of words will always be the subject of speculation and Louisiana political lore.

Death and legacy
In 1998, Gunter was diagnosed with cancer. He died on July 6, 1999, at his home at the age of sixty. He is interred at the Holloway Cemetery in Rapides Parish. Gunter was of Czech extraction and formerly resided in the community of Libuse.
