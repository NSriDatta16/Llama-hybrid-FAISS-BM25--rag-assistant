The liner notes are written by Carl Butler and Pearl, writers of the song "If Teardrops Were Pennies", originally a hit in 1951 for Carl Smith.

Critical reception
In a positive review of the album, Billboard said, "A collection of love ballads with some of the finest cuts this consistent pair have ever come up with. Aside from the single and one other cut, Dolly and/or Porter wrote every song, and they must have been in romantic moods. Good old fashioned love music, with some timeless lyrics, and it's one everyone will want. There is even a dialog recitation." They went on to say that eight of the ten tunes...have the potential to be around for a long time." They concluded with a note to record dealers, saying that the "good cover work by Les Leverett sets the mood for the album."

In another positive review, Cashbox said, "Aptly titled, this LP contains a soothing, sincere selection of tunes that touch lightly on loveâ€”hearts and flowers abound. And there's nothing wrong with that, as anyone familiar with the phenomenal success accorded Dolly and Porter for their rendering of such sentiments should know! This is the sort of album you put on the phonograph and relax to, love to, and let the troubled world fade away. Dolly penned several delightful tunes. Catch "I Get Lonesome by Myself"."
