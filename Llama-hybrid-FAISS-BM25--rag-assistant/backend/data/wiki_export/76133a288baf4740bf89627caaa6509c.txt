Early life and theatre

Williamson production of Seagulls Over Sorrento. He would also appear in the 1960 TV production of the play.

Television and film
According to screenwriter Richard Lane "in that first decade of television it seemed that Brian James was everywhere."

James appeared in several ABC drama plays in the late 1950s, including Duke In Darkness and Killer in Close-Up: The Wallace Case in 1957, Gaslight, The Small Victory, The Public Prosecutor, and The Governess (all 1958), Crime Passionel, Treason, and The House By The Stable (1959). 

He had the lead role as Dr Geoffrey Thompson in the early medical drama Emergency (1959). He also appeared in commercial dramas Shadow of a Pale Horse and Seagulls Over Sorrento in 1960, along with ABC dramas Heart Attack, Eye of the Night, and Mine Own Executioner, and was awarded the TV Week Logie award for "Best Actor" for the plum role of Governor William Bligh in the 1960 ABC drama serial Stormy Petrel (a role which he reprised in a 1974 episode of the anthology series Behind The Legend).
