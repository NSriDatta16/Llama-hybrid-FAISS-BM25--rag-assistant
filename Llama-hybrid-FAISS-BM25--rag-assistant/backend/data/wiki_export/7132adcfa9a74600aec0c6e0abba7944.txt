"Dance with Me" is a song by American R&B singer Debelah Morgan, released on June 19, 2000, as the first single from Morgan's third studio album of the same name. Morgan co-wrote the song with its producer Giloh Morgan, with Richard Adler and Jerry Ross receiving songwriting credits for the reworking of their composition "Hernando's Hideaway". Lyrically, "Dance with Me" revolves around the protagonist's declaration that she only wants to dance with her lover that night.

The song peaked at number eight on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart on January 6, 2001. The single also reached number three in Australia—where it was certified platinum for sales exceeding 70,000 copies—and number 10 in Romania and the United Kingdom. "Dance with Me" received international acclaim and has been performed in different versions, including a special Walt Disney version and a Spanish version entitled "Baila Conmigo".
