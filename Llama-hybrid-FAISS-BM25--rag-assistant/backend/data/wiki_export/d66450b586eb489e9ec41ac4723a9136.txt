The Miss Oklahoma Teen USA competition is the pageant that selects the representative for the state of Oklahoma in the Miss Teen USA pageant. This pageant is directed by Vanbros and Associates, headquartered in Lenexa, Kansas. In 1997, Oklahoma joined the Vanbros group of state pageants for the Miss USA and Teen USA system.

Oklahoma is in the top 5 most successful states at Miss Teen USA in terms of number and value of placements. Oklahoma's best performance came in the 1980s through the early 1990s. After Oklahoma was taken over by Vanbros there was a six-year lapse, before Nikki Carver brought the state back into the semi-finals in 2003. The state's most recent placement was in 2019, when Abigail Billings finished in the top 15. Oklahoma has produced one Miss Teen USA, Allison Brown, who won in 1986 becoming the 4th state that won the Miss Teen USA title for the first time.

Four Oklahoma teens have crossed over to win the Miss Oklahoma USA title and compete at Miss USA, with Morgan Woolard being the most successful with a 1st runner-up placement at Miss USA 2010.

Jaselyn Rossman of Sapulpa, was crowned Miss Oklahoma Teen USA 2023 on March 26, 2023, at OCCC Performing Arts Center in Oklahoma. She will represent Oklahoma for the title of Miss Teen USA 2023.
