Legion of Mary: The Jerry Garcia Collection, Vol. 1 is an album by Legion of Mary, a jazz influenced rock band led by Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead.  It was recorded live on various dates from December 1974 to July 1975, at the Keystone in Berkeley, California, the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco, California, and the Paramount Theatre in Portland, Oregon.  It was released on August 23, 2005.

Besides Garcia on guitar and vocals, Legion of Mary features Merl Saunders on keyboards, Martin Fierro on saxophone and flute, John Kahn on bass, and Ron Tutt on drums.

Another live album by Legion of Mary is Garcia Live Volume Three. Released on three CDs in October 2013, it contains recordings from the band's December 1974 tour of the Pacific Northwest.

A recording by a slightly earlier lineup of this band, not yet known as Legion of Mary, is Pure Jerry: Keystone Berkeley, September 1, 1974. Released in December 2004, it contains a complete concert on three CDs.  The lineup is the same as on the Legion of Mary album, except that the drummer is Ron Tutt's predecessor in the band, Paul Humphrey.

In August 1975, Garcia disbanded Legion of Mary, and formed a new group called the Jerry Garcia Band.  The first lineup of the Jerry Garcia Band also included Kahn and Tutt, along with Nicky Hopkins on piano.  A live recording of that band, from November 1975, was released in 2009 as the album Let It Rock: The Jerry Garcia Collection, Vol. 2.
