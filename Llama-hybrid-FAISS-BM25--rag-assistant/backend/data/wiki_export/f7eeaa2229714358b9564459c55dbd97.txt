Neath Port Talbot College (NPTC) was a further education institution established as two campuses in Port Talbot and Neath in Wales, United Kingdom.

The college allowed study of many courses including GCSEs, AS Level/A levels, AGCEs, AVCEs, Adult Lifelong Learning Services, GNVQs at both Foundation and Intermediate levels.

Neath Port Talbot College also offered higher education courses or HND/Cs in various subjects related to their AVCE/AGCE courses, notably in Computing, Health & Social Care, Hospitality and Childcare.

After the County Borough of Neath Port Talbot was formed in 1996, plans were put through to merge the Afan College and Neath College as one.  In 1997 this was achieved under the name of Neath Port Talbot College.

In August 2013 Neath Port Talbot College merged with Coleg Powys to become NPTC Group.

History 

Between the 1950s to the 1990s there was a Neath College and an Afan College; each college had their own administration and staff.  Both colleges independently offered O levels, A levels, National Diplomas and other qualifications.  When the boroughs of Neath and Port Talbot merged to form a unitary Authority in 1996, the two colleges decided to merge as one also.  Instead of each campus being called Neath College and Afan College, it became Neath Campus and Afan Campus.

The college also had an outpost at Queen Street in Neath Town Centre, where the ECDL were offered and other part-time courses were available too.  Further facilities were situated at Margam Country Park in Twyn Yr Hydd House from where the college ran its Management Training Centre, Horticulture Training Centre and Parc-Gro plant nursery.
