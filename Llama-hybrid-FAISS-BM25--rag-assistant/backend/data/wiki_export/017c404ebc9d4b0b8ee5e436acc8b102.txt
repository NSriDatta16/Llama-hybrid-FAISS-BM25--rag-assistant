Saint Augustine School (SAS) is the first private Catholic school in Tanza, Cavite, Philippines.

History 
Saint Augustine School (SAS) of Tanza was named after the town's patron saint, Augustine of Hippo, also fondly called, "Tata Usteng." It was founded on February 14, 1969 by Francisco V. Domingo , the town's parish priest at that time.  Envisioned as a school that will provide quality and Christian Catholic  educational formation to the young, it formally opened in June 1969 and offered kinder and grade one classes. The SAS educational system was placed under De La Salle supervision, and the impressive result of its first year operation convinced skeptics of the sincerity of its objectives and vision. From 44 pupils and two teachers, and succeeding school years saw the rapid growth of the school both in student environment and hired teachers.

After only one year a primary building was built beside the left wing of the church. Then in 1971, construction of another building for the high School classrooms started. It was completed in 1972. The basketball court followed.

Its first principal was Angeles Gabutina, who served  for two months, before Clemencia Ranin took over. When Ranin left, Matilde became the next principal in 1971. She stayed for two years, while Maria Leonora served as elementary principal for SY 1972-1973. Then, in 1973-1976, Patrocinio San Juan took over. The year 1975 also saw the retirement of Francisco V. Domingo, both as town parish and school director.
School Year 1975-1976 ushered in new administration for SAS. Luciano Paguiligan became the new director. San Juan left, and in 1977, Corsie Legaspi took over her post. He stayed up to SY 1978-79. Then, from 1979–80, Teresita Octavio acted as principal, followed by Julieta Hernandez from 1980–89 and then Teodoro Bawalan as School Director and Mercedita Pacumio as principal from 1989 up to present.
