They are the northernmost members of the Chatham Archipelago, located  east of New Zealand's South Island.

 Little Sister

Fauna

The islands have the second largest breeding colony of the northern royal albatross, and provide breeding sites for Buller's albatross, northern giant petrel, fairy prion, broad-billed prion, sooty shearwater, common diving petrel, grey-backed storm petrel, white-faced storm petrel, pitt shag, subantarctic skua, red-billed gull, and white-fronted tern. The site has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because it supports Buller's albatrosses and northern giant petrels.

A species of stag beetle called Geodorcus sororum'' is endemic to the islands.
