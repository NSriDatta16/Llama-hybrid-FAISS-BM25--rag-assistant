Service history
After shakedown along the west coast, Laub steamed through the Panama Canal, arriving Norfolk, Virginia 1 February 1943. She departed New York 7 February, escorting a convoy to North Africa. After reaching Casablanca, the destroyer patrolled the African coast until departing 14 March with a return convoy to the United States.

The destroyer departed New York on her third extended voyage 11 June to join Allied forces in north Africa preparing for the invasion of Sicily. On 5 July she sailed from Oran to screen the transports and their passage to the strategic Sicilian beaches.

The amphibious force arrived off Sicily 4 days later, made a dramatic night landing, and the next day fought off Nazi aircraft. On the 11th, while bombarding the shore, Laub assisted in downing an aircraft. Continuing fire support operations, Laub destroyed four tanks and damaged strategic bridges.

The destroyer returned to Mers el Kebir 15 July and continued operations in the Mediterranean Sea until joining a convoy for America on 28 July. Laub made additional convoy runs to north Africa and the United Kingdom before returning to Oran to support the Allied campaigns in the Mediterranean.
