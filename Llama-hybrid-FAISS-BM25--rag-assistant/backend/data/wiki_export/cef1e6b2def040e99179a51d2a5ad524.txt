The Prairie Junior Hockey League is a Junior "B" ice hockey league in Saskatchewan, Canada, sanctioned by Hockey Canada.

History 
Originally known as the South Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League (1992–2006) the Prairie Junior Hockey League was founded in 2007–2008 with the merger of the SSJHL and the North Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League (NSJHL).

Previously the playoff winners played-off against the champion of the NSJHL in the Provincial championships (Athol Murray Trophy). Since the amalgamation of the two leagues in 2007, the PJHL has been the only Junior 'B' league in the province; thus its champion has been awarded the provincial title. The provincial champion moves on to compete for the Keystone Cup Western Canadian Junior 'B' championship.

The league draws many players from Saskatchewan. Most teams draft players from nearby towns and cities, though it is not mandatory. Some teams outweigh other teams in the PJHL. For example, the Pilot Butte Storm advanced to the finals eleven years (2005–15) in a row, while the Ochapawace Thunder (0-40-0-0) didn't win a game in the 2015–16 PJHL season.
