The Hanover Tache Junior Hockey League is a junior ice hockey league in Manitoba, Canada, sanctioned by Hockey Manitoba. It is the only Junior 'C' league in Manitoba, and as such, league champions are also named provincial Junior 'C' champions.

History 
The HTJHL operates exclusively in the southeastern part of the province. It was created in 1987 to complement the now-defunct senior level Hanover-Taché Hockey League, which has since been succeeded by the Carillon Senior Hockey League.

The number of teams has fluctuated throughout the years, with a high of ten teams competing in 2011-12.

Steinbach Huskies are the most successful club claiming the HTJHL championship nine times (1989, 1990, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2012, 2014, 2023).
