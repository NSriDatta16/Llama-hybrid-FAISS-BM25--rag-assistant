Relentless is the second live album by American stand-up comedian and satirist Bill Hicks, released in 1992 by Invasion Records. It was Hicks' final release before his death from pancreatic cancer in February 1994. The album contains a song, "Chicks Dig Jerks", written and performed by Marblehead Johnson, a band Hicks had formed with friends.

In 1997, Rykodisc issued remastered versions of both Relentless and its predecessor, Dangerous (1990), on CD, as well as the posthumous albums Arizona Bay and Rant in E-Minor.
