José Salvador Carmona Álvarez (born 22 August 1975) is a Mexican former professional footballer who played as a defender who is currently banned for life from playing professional football affiliated to FIFA for failing two separate anti-doping tests.

During his career, he obtained 84 caps for the Mexico national team since his debut in 1996. He had an important role in the success of the team at two World Cup tournaments: 1998 and 2002.

He was involved in a doping controversy and suspended one year as was teammate Aaron Galindo, in the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup, therefore prohibiting both players from representing Mexico in the 2006 World Cup. On 16 May 2007, Carmona received a lifetime ban by the Court of Arbitration for Sport for testing positive once again in an antidoping control test taken on 31 January 2006.
