The Guangdong Provincial People's Stadium () is a multi-purpose stadium in Guangzhou, China.  It is currently used mostly for football matches. The stadium holds 15,000 people. The stadium is best reached by taking Guangzhou Metro Line 1 to Martyrs' Park Station.

History 
Formerly known as the dongjiaochang or Eastern Parade Ground, the site was first used as a sporting venue in 1906 when it hosted Guangdong's (and China's) first ever provincial level athletics competition. Sun Yat-Sen ordered the construction of a stadium on the site in 1922 but it wasn't finished until 1932.

It was used as a Japanese transport and supplies depot during the occupation of Guangzhou and was bombed when Guangzhou was liberated.

Construction of Yuexiushan meant that the People's Stadium didn't hold many high-profile sporting or civic events from the mid 1950s onwards. However, it did host many games in the Guangdong-Hong Kong Cup as well as games in the inaugural Women's World Cup in 1991.

Recent use 
For the 2017 Chinese Super League Season, Guangzhou R&F F.C. used the stadium as their temporary home for their first two matches whilst Yuexiushan was being refurbished.
