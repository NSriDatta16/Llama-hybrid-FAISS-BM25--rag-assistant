History
Keperra has a deep and rich indigenous history. The name Keperra comes from a Yuggera words kipper/kippa indicating a young man. Two bora rings used to be located within the suburb, one near the corner of Samford Road and Keperra Street (now under housing) and one which disappeared with the construction of the Keperra Country Club. It is thought that the name derives from the initiation ceremonies of young men performed at the bora rings.

In 1865, Thomas Price sold a large portion of land in Keperra to John and Mary Nicholson who built a home and named it Groveley Lodge (the extra 'e' in the name was dropped in later years). In the absence of a church in the area, the Nicholsons held services within Groveley Lodge and later built St Matthews Anglican Church, Grovely in what is now Church Street, Mitchelton; John and Mary Nicholson are buried in the churchyard cemetery.

The railway was built through the area in 1918 but it was originally a siding located near the western end of the Keperra Country Club. The Keperra railway station was named in 1932.

On 26 October 1918, 107 allotments of the "Grovely Station Estate" were advertised for auction by W.J. Down & Co.  The allotments were adjacent to the Grovely Railway Station on the Enoggera line.

Capt. Robert H Cottam founded the Keperra Golf Club in 1931. It was originally called the Enoggera Golf Club, but changed to its present name in 1940. The clubhouse was built in 1939â€“1940.

In about 1940 a military camp was established on the slaughterhouse site. The army camp constructed many of the roads and much of the land was transferred to the Housing Commission for housing development in 1951.

From 1966 to 1998, there was a drive-in movie theatre located at the corner of Settlement and Samford Roads. It was operated by R.W.P. Dodd Theatres and later by Birch Carol & Coyle. It could accommodate 650 cars. Initially it had a single screen but was later converted to a two-screen. The land is now the site of the Kings Grove housing estate, located within the Kings Park Estate.
