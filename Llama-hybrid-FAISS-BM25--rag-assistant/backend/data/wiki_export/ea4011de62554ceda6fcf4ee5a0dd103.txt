The musical fortunes of Friuli-Venezia Giulia (Furlanija â€“ Julijska krajina) are closely tied to its political fortunes over the course of centuries, all having to do with proximity to the great maritime Republic of Venice as well as to the Austro-Hungarian empire and the vicissitudes of being a heavily contested area during the first World War. The vast comings and goings of various ethnic groups through this section of Italy have led to cultural and musical variety  for diversity.

Furlana was a dance that was named from Friuli that became very popular in Venice, then was adopted by French royal court and then it spread all over Europe, being used by Johann Sebastian Bach and many other musicians. 
It could have a Slav origin, though.

The Villotta (or Vilote Furlane) is a traditional Friulian polyphonic song, initially handed down only orally, composed of 4 alternating octosyllable rhymes born in the 15th century.

The most prominent musical theater in the region was built in 1801 in Trieste and was named the Teatro Giuseppe Verdi in 1901. The city is the site of the Giuseppe Tartini music conservatory. It is also the home base for the internationally acclaimed Trieste Trio chamber music ensemble.

Elsewhere in the region, the province of Gorizia has at least five  spacious auditoriums and hosts a number of music events during the year, including the international Rudolfo Lipizer violin competition as well as various popular music festivals. The province of Pordenone hosts an international organ festival and competition as well as sponsoring an event dedicated to the Renaissance organ. Various musical associations in Pordenone include:
the Vincenzo Colombo Association for Sacred Music;
the Institute for Music of the Pedemontana;
the Farandola Cultural Association.

An additional music conservatory, named for Jacopo Tomadini, is located in the city of Udine.

Contemporary Friulian music includes various genres: Italian melodic song, songwriting, ethno-folk-rock, jazz, rock, rap and electronic music.

In this musical panorama, some artists stand out such as: the singer Beppino Lodolo, the jazz pianist and showman Lelio Lutazzi, the pianist and composer Glauco Venier, the dance music producer Robert Miles, the Italian pop singer Elisa , the singer-actress Lodovica Comello, the indie band Tre Allegri Ragazzi Morti, the group punk Prozac+, the reggae group Mellow Mood, the ethno rock group FLK, the folk rock group Arbe Garbe, the rapper Dj Tubet, the folk singer Lino Straulino, the singer-songwriter Dario Zampa.
