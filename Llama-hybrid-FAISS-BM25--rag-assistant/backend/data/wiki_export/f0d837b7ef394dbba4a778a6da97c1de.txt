Studio Fredman is a well-known recording studio in Gothenburg, Sweden, owned and operated by producer Fredrik Nordström.

It is popular among Swedish metal bands, with artists such as At the Gates, Deathstars, Nightrage, Norwegian band Dimmu Borgir, Arch Enemy, Soilwork, Dark Tranquillity, In Flames, Zonaria, Machinae Supremacy, HammerFall, England's Bring Me the Horizon, A Breach of Silence, and Opeth recording multiple releases in the studio.

Originally, it was located in Gothenburg, but by 2005, it was relocated to Hyssna about 30 miles outside Gothenburg.

The original facility was also co-owned by In Flames vocalist, Anders Fridén. By the time of relocation, the original studio became In Flames-owned IF Studios.

In 2008, Studio Fredman relocated once again in downtown Gothenburg at Västra Frölunda/Högsbo.
