History

According to some documents, Dětmarovice was mentioned as early as 1302, but these are unverified mentions. Officially the village was first mentioned in a Latin document of Diocese of Wrocław called Liber fundationis episcopatus Vratislaviensis from 1305. It was originally founded north of the present village, but after a great fire it was restored in its present location.

The village became a seat of a Catholic parish, mentioned in the register of Peter's Pence payment from 1447 among 50 parishes of Teschen deanery.

Politically the village belonged initially to the Duchy of Teschen, formed in 1290 in the process of feudal fragmentation of Poland and was ruled by a local branch of Piast dynasty. In 1327 the duchy became a fee of Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg monarchy. In 1573 it was sold as one of a dozen villages and the town of Freistadt and formed a state country split from the Duchy of Teschen.

The village was bought in 1792 by Jan Larisch who joined it with its Karviná properties. It was owned by the Larisch family until 1927.

After Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed in 1869 to the newly established Freistadt political district and Oderberg legal district, but before 1890 the municipality was transferred to Freistadt legal district.

The first written mention of Koukolná is from 1447. It was a separate municipality until 1872–1875, when it was merged with Dětmarovice.

According to the censuses conducted in 1880–1910 the population of the municipality grew from 1,769 in 1880 to 3,453 in 1910. In three censuses majority were Czech-speakers (84.9% in 1880, 64% in 1890, 77.1% in 1910, 12.5% minority in 1900), in 1900 majority were Polish-speakers (86.7%, in other censuses minority: 13.9% in 1880, 34.6% in 1890, 21.8% in 1910). They were accompanied by German-speaking minority (between 0.8% and 1.4%). In terms of religion in 1910 the majority were Roman Catholics (98.2%), followed by Jews (0.9%) and Protestants (0.6%).

After World War I, fall of Austria-Hungary, Polish–Czechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, the village became a part of Czechoslovakia. Following the Munich Agreement, in October 1938 together with the Trans-Olza region it was annexed by Poland, administratively organised in Frysztat County of Silesian Voivodeship. The village was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Czechoslovakia.
