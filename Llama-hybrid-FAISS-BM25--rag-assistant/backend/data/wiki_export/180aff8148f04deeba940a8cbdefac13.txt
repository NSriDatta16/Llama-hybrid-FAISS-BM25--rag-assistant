"Tell Me When to Go" is the first single from E-40's BME/Warner Bros. debut, My Ghetto Report Card. Keak da Sneak is also featured on the track. It was produced by Lil Jon, and one of the first singles to kick off the hyphy movement on a national level and popularized the phrase "ghost ride the whip".  The song reached number 35 in the U.S. and eventually was certified Gold by the RIAA. The song first premiered online on the MySpace.com homepage and it was the first hip hop single to premiere online before being released.

The song samples "Dumb Girl" by Run-DMC.

The song is featured in the 2007 Xbox 360/PlayStation 3 video game Def Jam: Icon. E-40 is a playable character in the video game and provides his own voice and likeness. It also appeared in “The Fugitive”, a season 4 episode of the scripted comedy series Brooklyn Nine-Nine.

Music video
The black and white music video, produced by production company Immigrant Films, was directed and edited by Bernard Gourley and lensed by cinematographer David Claessen. Filmed at the abandoned 16th Street station in West Oakland, it features cameo appearances from D-Shot, B-Legit, Dem Hoodstarz, Haji Springer, Too Short, Lil Jon, Rick Rock, The Federation, Battle Loco, Lil Scrappy, J. Valentine, Mistah F.A.B., Big Rich, Turf Talk, The Crest Creepaz, Frank D. and the Architeckz turf dancing crew with choreography by Jeriel Bey.

In 2016, director Dante Ariola and cinematographer Chris Soos recreated the music video for a Beats Studio Wireless  headphones commercial, also titled – and set to – "Tell Me When to Go", starring Golden State Warriors' power forward Draymond Green and featuring E-40 and cameos by Green's then-Warriors teammates Ian Clark, Brandon Rush, and Shaun Livingston as well as Oakland natives Gary Payton and Brian Shaw. The 90-second version also features Keak da Sneak. The spot is one of three that earned Ariola a DGA best commercial director nomination in 2017.

Live performances
"Tell Me When to Go" was performed live, the day before the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards in a club in New York City. This performance featured E-40 and Lil Jon rapping, while a rock instrumental was played by Metal Skool. The event was held at Snitch, a rock-themed club.
