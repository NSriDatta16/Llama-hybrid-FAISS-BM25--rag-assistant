Over the following years, they frequently entertained Caroline Gordon and Allen Tate there. When the Cheneys converted to Roman Catholicism in 1953, Gordon and Tate were their sponsors.

In 1939, Cheney published his first novel, Lightwood.  It deals with armed conflicts  over timber rights in Dodge and Telfair Counties in Georgia from 1870 to 1923.

That same year, he received a Guggenheim fellowship in 1941 to complete his second novel, River Rouge, published in 1942.  The novel is about a young man in backwoods Georgia who works his way up in the timber industry to become a rich, though corrupt, merchant.

In 1943, Cheney received a staff job with a U.S. Senate subcommittee, working there until 1945. In February 1952, Cheney's play, Strangers in This World, premiered at the Vanderbilt University Theater in Nashville.  In January 1956, it was staged at the Little Theater, University of Louisville, Belknap Campus.

In August 1952, Cheney wrote an appreciative review of Flannery O'Connor's first novel, Wise Blood. Obtaining Cheney's address from Caroline Gordon, O'Connor wrote Cheney to thank him for reviewing the book "so carefully and with so much understanding". In his reply, Cheney described himself to the Catholic O'Connor as "an ex-Protestant, ex-agnostic, who had just found his way back (after 10 or 12 generations) to The Church". The Cheneys visited O'Connor for the first time in June 1953. They became close friends, corresponding and sharing ideas until O'Connor's death in 1964.

Legacy 
Cheney's novels reveal his desire for a return to a simpler way of life, one founded on natural cycles and rooted in an appreciation of the land. His tragic characters often go astray by attempting to urbanize themselves or betray their own way of life. In his work, redemption can only be achieved by a return to a farm or a religious conversion, as in Devil's Elbow.

In 2011, The Lightwood Chronicles, being the true story of Brainard Cheney's novel, Lightwood, was published. The book includes a collection of essays and other information relating to the Dodge Timber Wars, divided into two sections: Lightwood as History and Lightwood as Fiction. The editor, Stephen Whigham, interviewed Cheney in 1982.
