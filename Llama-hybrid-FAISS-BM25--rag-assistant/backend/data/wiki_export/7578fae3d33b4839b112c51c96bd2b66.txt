History
In 1365 a first town (mueang) named Tranom (ตระนอม) was established, which was a subordinate of Nakhon Si Thammarat. During the thesaphiban administrative reforms of the early-20th century it became a tambon in Sichon District. On 1 March 1939 it was made a minor district (king amphoe), consisting of the two tambons Khanom and Thong Nian. The minor district was upgraded to a full district on 11 December 1959.

A third tambon, Khuan Thong, was created on 25 December 1963 with three mubans from Thong Nian and two from Khanom.

The sanitary district (sukhaphiban) Khanom was established on 28 December 1945, which became official on 28 January 1957. On 25 May 1999 it was converted to a township (thesaban tambon), as all sanitary districts were upgraded to municipalities.

Wat Kradangnga is the oldest Buddhist temple of the district, dating back to the Ayutthaya Kingdom.

Education
There are two high schools - Khanom Phitthaya High School and Thong Nian Khana Phi Ban High School - and a campus of the Rajamangala University of Technology Srivijaya.

Administration
The district is divided into three sub-districts (tambons), which are further subdivided into 34 villages (mubans). Khanom itself has sub-district municipality (thesaban tambon) status and covers part of tambon Khanom, village 1 and parts of village 3, altogether an area of 1.76 km2. Tambon Thong Nian forms another sub-district municipality. The non-municipal areas of tambon Khanom and Khuan Thong are each administered by a tambon administrative organization (TAO).
