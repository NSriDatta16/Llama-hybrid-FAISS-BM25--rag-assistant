Airdrie railway station is a railway station serving the town of Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, Scotland. The station is managed by ScotRail and is served by trains on the North Clyde Line,  east of Glasgow Queen Street.

History 
Opened by the Bathgate and Coatbridge Railway and absorbed into the North British Railway, it became part of the London and North Eastern Railway during the Grouping of 1923. The station then passed on to the Scottish Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. British Railways then ran the station for Strathclyde PTE, and continued to do so as ScotRail when sectorisation was introduced, until the privatisation of British Rail.  The station became a terminus in January 1956, when passenger services to Bathgate over the former B&CR were withdrawn - freight over this line continued until final closure & abandonment in 1982. The line from Glasgow was subsequently wired as part of the North Clyde electrification scheme in 1960. Strathclyde PTE & BR reopened a short portion of the line eastwards to a new station at Drumgelloch in 1989 and full reinstatement of the line to Bathgate followed in 2010 (see below).

As part of the Airdrie-Bathgate rail link reopening, the station has been refurbished, including the reinstatement of the second through platform with a capability of holding 9 carriages opposite the current Platform 2, which has been extended and a large car park facility (see link in sources below).
