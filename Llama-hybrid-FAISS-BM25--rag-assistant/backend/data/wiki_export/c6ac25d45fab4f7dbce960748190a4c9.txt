Concordia Lutheran Theological Seminary (CLTS), founded in 1976, is a seminary of the Lutheran Church–Canada (LCC) affiliated with Brock University in St. Catharines, Ontario. Its primary purpose is to educate students seeking ordination in LCC, but its graduate degree programs are open to laypeople.

History 
Concordia was started in 1976 as an extension site for Concordia Theological Seminary, a seminary of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS). At that time the LCC was part of the LCMS, not becoming an independent church body until 1988. CLTS initially used the facilities of Resurrection Lutheran Church in St. Catharines. The seminary moved to Brock University in 1983. In 2020, Resurrection Lutheran moved from its own building and began sharing the seminary building.

Programmes
As a graduate-level affiliated college of Brock University, Concordia offers a four-year Master of Divinity programme and a two-year Master of Theological Studies programme. The Divinity program, which includes one year of vicarage (parish internship) in the third year, is designed for students seeking ordination in LCC but open to others; while the Theological Studies programme is designed for laypeople.

Governance
Concordia Lutheran Theological Seminary is an accredited member of the Association of Theological Schools. As an affiliated college, the seminary is also responsible to Brock University for maintaining academic quality in its degree programs.
