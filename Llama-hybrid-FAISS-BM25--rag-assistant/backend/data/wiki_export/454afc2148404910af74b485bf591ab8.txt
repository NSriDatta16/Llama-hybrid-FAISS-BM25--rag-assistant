St. Martins is a former village on the Bay of Fundy now part of the village of Fundy-St. Martins, Canada.

The village was founded as Quaco by 1783 by soldiers from the disbanded loyalist King's Orange Rangers. It was incorporated in 1967. Led by shipbuilders such as James Moran, it was the third most productive shipbuilding town in the Maritimes, producing over 500 ships. Shipbuilding declined after the 1870s and today tourism is the major industry.

On 1 January 2023, St. Martins annexed all or part of three local service districts to form the new village of Fundy-St. Martins. The community's name remains in official use.
