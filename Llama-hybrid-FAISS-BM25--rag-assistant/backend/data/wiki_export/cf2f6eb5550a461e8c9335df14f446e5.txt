Mouton-Duvernet () is a Paris Métro station on line 4 in Paris' 14th arrondissement.

Location
The station is located on Avenue du Général-Leclerc at Rue Mouton-Duvernet.

History
The line 4 platforms were opened on 30 October 1909 when the southern section of the line opened between Raspail and Porte d'Orléans. The name refers to the Rue Mouton-Duvernet, named after 19th-century general Régis Barthélemy Mouton-Duvernet.

The station was renovated in early 1969 with a new design based on the orange tile, which was nicknamed the Mouton design. Twenty other stations are transformed on the same model during the following years. But it has lost the orange design since 13 March 13, 2007, following its renovation as part of the Renouveau du métro program, as at the Gare de l'Est station on Lines 5 and 7.

The station is now fitted with a set of platform screen doors, due to the RATP working to automate the line 4. The installation start in June 2018 and the installation ended in August 2018.

In 2018, 1,645,671 travelers entered this station which places it at 275th position of metro stations for its usage.
