Megalith Records is a ska record label founded on August 22, 2002 and located in Norman, Oklahoma. It is owned by Robert "Bucket" Hingley of The Toasters and the defunct label Moon Ska Records, and managed by Jeremy Patton, current webmaster and graphic artist for the Toasters. Manufacturing duties are carried out by Brett of AtoZ Media Services, a CD pressing plant company based in New York City.

In addition to CDs and LPs, all of the label's releases are available from more than 50 digital download pay sites. The label has released more than 60 records. The label has released some digital-only albums and plans to continue this, many of which are releases that have been out of print for years, or have not had physical releases available in the United States. The label has struck a physical distribution deal with MVD Entertainment Group, for in-store CD product sales and distribution.
