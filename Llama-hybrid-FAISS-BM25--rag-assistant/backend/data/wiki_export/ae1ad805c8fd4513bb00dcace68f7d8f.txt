CurlON (formerly the Ontario Curling Association) is the governing body of curling in Southern Ontario. Northern Ontario is governed by the Northern Ontario Curling Association (NOCA). The CurlON sends a team to represent Team Ontario at all major Canadian Championships. The NOCA sends a separate team to all of these events.

CurlON was founded in 1875. It was renamed from the Ontario Curling Association in 2016.

Ontario Scotties Tournament of Hearts

The Ontario Scotties Tournament of Hearts is the provincial championship for women's teams. Unlike the Dominion Tankard, the Hearts included teams from both southern and northern Ontario until 2015. The winner of the Ontario Hearts goes on to play in the national championship. Because the national champion returns the previous years champion to the event, if that team is from Ontario, they cannot defend their provincial championship. The national championship has been running since 1962, but the provincial championship has existed since 1956.

U-21 (Juniors)

The U-21 provincial curling championships are held annually in early January. The tournament is for curlers 20 years old and younger. A men's tournament has been held since 1950 and the women's since 1972. The winning team represents Ontario at the Canadian Junior Curling Championships.

Silver Tankard

In this event, each club that enters has two teams, who compete against other clubs, and scores are totalled in aggregate form. Regional and zone playdowns are single-knock out rather than double. It is the oldest of the O.C.A. events, dating back to 1875. The women's event has been held since 1914.

The event served as a provincial championship from 1927 to 1931 with a team selected from with winning club representing Ontario at the Brier. In 1932 and 1933, the winner entered a playoff to go to the Brier, and from 1934 to 1937, the winner of the Brier trophy event of the Tankard went to the Brier.

In 2022, the event format changed, with the men's and women's events being merged into one. The event is still a double rink event, except one team must be a men's team, and the other a women's team.
