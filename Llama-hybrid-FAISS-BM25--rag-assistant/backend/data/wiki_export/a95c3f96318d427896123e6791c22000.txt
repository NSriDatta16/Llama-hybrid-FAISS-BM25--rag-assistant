History
NC 89 is an original North Carolina state highway, established in 1921 by the North Carolina State Highway Commission. The highway began at NC 80 in Mount Airy and ran east to Francisco where it intersected NC 661. The highway then turned southeast, travelled through Danbury and Walnut Cove, before ending at NC 897 in Walkertown. At the time of establishment, NC 89 travelled through three counties, Surry County, Stokes County, and Forsyth County. By 1924, much of the route was considered a topsoil, sand-clay, and gravel road. Two exceptions existed, a segment north of Danbury, which was unimproved, and the segment in Forsyth County, which was paved. By 1926, NC 89 was removed from its routing between Walnut Cove and Walkertown, eliminating the highway in Forsyth County. The former routing became part of an extended NC 77. NC 89 was paved between its western terminus at NC 80 and NC 66 near Mount Airy, and between NC 891 near Danbury and NC 77 in Walnut Cove. The formerly unimproved section of road northwest of Danbury was upgraded to a topsoil, sand-clay, and gravel road by 1926 as well. Between 1929 and 1930, NC 89 was extended west to the Virginia state line. The highway was routed west of Mount Airy through Low Gap before ending at Virginia State Route 117 (SR 117) at the state line which continued toward Galax. 

On May 31, 1962, NC 89 was placed onto split streets in Mount Airy. Whereas the road had previously used South Main Street for both traffic directions, the northbound lanes were placed onto Cherry Street, Renfro Street, and Pine Street. The southbound lanes of NC 89 continued to use South Main Street. All lanes of traffic were moved onto Renfro Street and Pine Street on October 1, 1970. The most recent change to the routing of NC 89 occurred on June 27, 1997 when the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) removed the highway from Pine Street between Independence Boulevard and Renfro Street. Instead, NC 89 was rerouted to follow Independence Boulevard east to Renfro Street and then follow Renfro Street through downtown Mount Airy.
