Kid Confucius were an eight-piece Australian band from Sydney, Australia. They formed in 2001 and have since played well over 400 live shows around the country, including major festivals as well as their own headline shows at venues such as The Annandale Hotel and The Metro Theatre. In 2005 the band released a self-titled album and two singles "Words" and "Skintight." The album, a mish-mash of soul, hip-hop, pop and funk, received great critical acclaim, most notably from Rolling Stone who hailed the album as one of the standout local releases of the year. "Words" also enjoyed some solid months of radio and TV play. The band released its second album Stripes in 2007 with three singles "Closer", "Last Straw" and "Moment". Stripes was the band's attempt at making a Detroit-era Motown soul album and it was quick to earn rave reviews from press around the country as well as a publishing deal with Mushroom. "Moment" has enjoyed good radio play on triple j. Kid Confucius is set to release its third album in October 2008. The first single from this album, "Good Luck", is out now.

Kid C has also gained a stellar live reputation with many sold out appearances at various Sydney venues. The band has been touring nationally since 2004 as well as performing at big festivals such as Splendour in the Grass, Homebake, The Great Escape, Groovin' The Moo, Festival Of The Sun and more.

Taking a break from touring in early 2008, the band set its sights on writing and recording a new album - its third in as many years. The new album marks a dramatic and radical shift in style and sound for the band. With newfound influences such as Kings Of Leon, The Strokes, Phoenix and The Beatles meeting older influences such as Marvin Gaye and Otis Redding, the new Kid Confucius is more of a live garage soul experience.

Band Split
On 29 March 2010, Kid Confucius announced on their website that they would be splitting. They advised it was an amicable split and that they were going to pursue other musical projects.
