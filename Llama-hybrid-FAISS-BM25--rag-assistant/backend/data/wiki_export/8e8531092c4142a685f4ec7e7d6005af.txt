"Little Jeannie" (spelled "Little Jeanie" on the cover of certain single releases) is a song written by English musician Elton John and Gary Osborne recorded by John, and released as a single in 1980 from John's studio album 21 at 33. It reached number three on the Billboard pop chart in the United States, becoming the singer's biggest U.S. hit since 1976's "Don't Go Breaking My Heart" (a duet with singer Kiki Dee), and his highest-charting solo hit since 1975's "Island Girl". In the US, it would be John's highest-charting single co-written with Gary Osborne, while in the UK, where the song only reached number 33, "Blue Eyes" would eventually hold that honour.

It became John's fifth No. 1 on the U.S. Adult contemporary chart, and was certified Gold by the RIAA. It peaked at No. 3 in both Billboard and Cash Box. In Canada, it hit number one on the RPM 100 national singles chart.

Despite its impressive performance in the US charts, Elton John has rarely performed "Little Jeannie" live, doing so only on his 1980 tour and during 2000's One Night Only concerts.

Composition
Composed in the key of B flat, which allowed its notable saxophone solo to ring out, the song can be described as an uptempo ballad similar in feel, with its electric piano, to his earlier 1973 hit, "Daniel".

Critical reception
Billboard's reviewer noted that "this melodic midtempo ballad recalls the consummate commercial craftsmanship which characterized John's output around the time of Caribou in 1974" and "some brassy horn fills constitute the only real update on John's traditional sound." Cash Box said that "the Latin-flavored percussives and brass add a new exciting dimension to the mid-tempo beat." Record World said that it shows the "stylistic genius that brought us 'Your Song' and other pop ballad hits."
