The proceedings and case was later dropped.

Universal Music Australia claims that on Christmas Eve 2014 Modular Recordings owner Steve Pavlovic agreed to sign a separation deal, under which he would give, without compensation, Universal his half of Modular, together with music, trademarks, websites and other assets.
