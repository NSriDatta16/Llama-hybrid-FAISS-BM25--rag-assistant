Two Cops () is a 1993 South Korean action/comedy film directed by Kang Woo-suk. It stars Ahn Sung-ki and Park Joong-hoon as a pair of police detectives with different outlooks who end up working on a case together.

Plot
The experienced detective Jo has a new partner, Kang who recently graduated from the Police Academy at the top of the class. The idealistic Kang always sticks to his principles and often conflicts with Jo, an amoral cop who always tries to take advantage of his position. Kang tries to win Jo over to his side, but fails. One day, a beautiful woman who works in a bar comes to the police station for help, and Kang falls in love with her. He starts going to the bar often to see her, and begins to become more like Jo.

Reception
Despite criticism that its plot was copied from the 1984 French film My New Partner, Two Cops became a box office hit upon its release on December 18, 1993. A highly commercial crowd pleaser that also dealt with the serious theme of police corruption, it was the second most-watched Korean film of 1993, after Sopyonje.

The financial success of Two Cops enabled Kang Woo-suk to set up his own film production and distribution company, Cinema Service.

The film spawned two sequels came : Two Cops 2 (1996), and Two Cops 3 (1998).
