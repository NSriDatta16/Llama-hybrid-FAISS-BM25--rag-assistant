Blitzkrieg: From the Rise of Hitler to the Fall of Dunkirk is a 1979 military history book by Len Deighton. Unlike most of Deighton's other work the book is entirely non-fiction.

Details
The book explains Adolf Hitler's victory in 1940 in the Western Campaign. Deighton points out that Allies had far greater resources than the Germans. Deighton considers Hitler's military skills astonishing considering his background and complete lack of training (p.Â 52).

Literally meaning "Lightning War", Blitzkrieg is the tactic of speed and the avoidance of unnecessary conflict, which were the keys to the rapid German advance.

The foreword is by general Walter Nehring, formerly Heinz Guderian's chief of staff.

Contents
