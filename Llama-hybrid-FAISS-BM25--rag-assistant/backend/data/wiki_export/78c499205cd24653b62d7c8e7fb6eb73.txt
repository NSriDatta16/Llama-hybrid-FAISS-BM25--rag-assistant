In 1998 he moved up to Super Middleweight and after a tune up against Bernice Barber captured the WBC super middleweight title with a unanimous decision win over Thulani Malinga.  
He successfully defended the title twice, defeating fellow Briton and future World Champion Glenn Catley and former World Champ Vincenzo Nardiello before losing it to Markus Beyer by decision in 1999, a fight in which Woodhall was down in the 1st and twice in the 3rd.
