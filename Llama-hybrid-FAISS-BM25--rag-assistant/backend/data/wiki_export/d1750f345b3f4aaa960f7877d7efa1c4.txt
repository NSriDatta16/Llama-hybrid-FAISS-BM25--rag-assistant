He won a Super Bowl ring with the Steelers in Super Bowl XLIII, and made a Pro Bowl in 2011.

Clark has a sickle cell trait condition which made it dangerous for him to play at high altitudes, such as in Denver, Colorado.

College career
At Louisiana State University, Clark started 36 consecutive games for the LSU Tigers football team. In 2000, he was selected to the All-SEC second team by the league's coaches.

Professional career

New York Giants

2002
Clark went undrafted in the 2002 NFL Draft.
On April 26, 2002, the New York Giants signed Clark to a three-year, $906,000 contract as an undrafted free agent that included a signing bonus of $1,000.

During training camp, Clark delivered a late hit to teammate and rookie wide receiver Tim Carter that sidelined the second round pick for six weeks. Head coach Jim Fassel named Clark a backup safety and a part of the special teams unit to begin his rookie season. Clark made his professional regular season debut during the New York Giants' 16–13 loss against the San Francisco 49ers. The following week, Clark made his first career tackle as the Giants defeated the St. Louis Rams 26–21. On October 21, 2002, the New York Giants released Clark and replaced him with veteran safety Johnnie Harris. On October 23, 2002, the New York Giants signed Clark to their practice squad where he would remain for the rest of his rookie season.

2003
Throughout training camp in 2003, Clark competed for a roster spot against Shaun Williams and Ike Charlton. Head coach Jim Fassel named Clark the primary backup safety to begin the regular season, behind starters Shaun Williams and Omar Stoutmire. On October 19, 2003, Clark earned his first career start and deflected a single pass during a 14–10 loss against the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 7. In Week 12, he collected a season-high five solo tackle as the Giants lost 19–13 at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. On December 28, 2003, Clark recorded three solo tackles and made his first career sack during a 37–24 loss against the Carolina Panthers in Week 17. Clark sacked Panthers' quarterback Jake Delhomme for a seven-yard loss in the third quarter. Clark finished the 2003 NFL season with 21 combined tackles (19 solo), two pass deflections, and one sack in 16 games and four starts.

On May 28, 2004, the New York Giants waived Clark after signing free agent safety Brent Alexander.

Washington Redskins

On July 31, 2004, the Washington Redskins signed Clark to a two-year, $835,000 contract as an unrestricted free agent. Head coach Joe Gibbs named Clark a backup safety behind Matt Bowen, Andre Lott, and rookie Sean Taylor. In Week 6, Clark became the starting free safety, alongside strong safety Sean Taylor, after season-ending injuries sidelined Matt Bowen and Andre Lott. On November 14, 2004, Clark collected a season-high 11 combined tackles (ten solo) during a 17–10 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals. Clark finished the 2004 NFL season with 81 combined tackles (65 solo) and a pass deflection in 15 games and 11 starts.

2005
Throughout training camp in 2005, Clark competed to be a backup safety against Pierson Prioleau. Clark began the season as the backup strong safety and was inactive for the first two games due to a sprained knee. In Week 4, Clark became the starting strong safety after Prioleau sustained a hamstring injury. Clark was inactive for the Redskins' Week 6 loss at the Kansas City Chiefs due to a chest injury. On October 30, 2005, Clark collected a season-high 11 solo tackles, deflected one pass, and made his first career interception during a 36–0 loss at the New York Giants in Week 8. He intercepted a pass by Giants' quarterback Eli Manning that was initially intended for wide receiver Plaxico Burress during the first quarter. The following week, Clark recorded four combined tackles, a pass deflection, and intercepted a pass by Donovan McNabb during the fourth quarter of a 17–10 win against the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 9. Clark finished the 2005 NFL season 57 combined tackles (42 solo), a career-high three interceptions, two pass deflections, two forced fumbles, and was credited with half a sack in 13 games and 13 starts.

While he played well for Washington and wanted to re-sign with the team, the Redskins decided to cut ties with him and signed Adam Archuleta to be their new starting safety; the signing would be cited years later by NFL Network as one of the worst free agent signings in NFL history, along with other free agent busts by the Redskins including Deion Sanders and Albert Haynesworth.

Pittsburgh Steelers

2006
On March 14, 2006, the Pittsburgh Steelers signed Clark to a four-year, $7 million contract that included a signing bonus of $1.65 million. Clark was signed as a replacement for Chris Hope, who declined the Steelers' contract offer and opted to sign with the Tennessee Titans. Throughout training camp, Clark competed to be the starting free safety against Tyrone Carter. Head coach Bill Cowher named Clark the starting free safety to begin the regular season, alongside strong safety Troy Polamalu.

On October 8, 2006, Clark recorded nine combined tackles (six solo), one pass deflection, and made his first interception as a member of the Pittsburgh Steelers during a 23–12 loss at the San Diego Chargers in Week 5. He intercepted a pass by Chargers' quarterback Philip Rivers during the first quarter. Clark was inactive for two games (Weeks 16–17) due to a groin injury.
In 2006, Clark made 72 tackles playing free safety for the Steelers, along with one interception and three fumble recoveries. He played 13 games and started 12 of them, missing the final three with a groin injury. During training camp before the 2007 season, he remained a starter despite a position battle with second year player Anthony Smith.

2007
During a 2007 game against the Denver Broncos at Invesco Field at Mile High, Clark developed severe pain in his left side and had to be rushed to the hospital.  It turned out that Clark had had a splenic infarction due to the sickle cell trait which he has had since he was a child; these are usually a risk at high altitudes. Clark had to have his spleen and gall bladder removed, ending his season.  He lost 30 pounds after the removal, but returned to the Steelers in 2008.  Although Clark was medically cleared to play in Denver's thin air without any complications, the Steelers took the precautionary measure of deactivating him for the four games played in Denver thereafter during Clark's career with the team—a 2009 Monday Night game, a 2010 preseason game, a 2011 playoff game and the 2012 season opener.

2008–2010
Clark was the Steelers' recipient of the Ed Block Courage Award in 2008. After the 2008 season, Clark started in Super Bowl XLIII where the Steelers won against the Arizona Cardinals, recording five total tackles. After the 2010 season, he started in the Steelers' appearance in Super Bowl XLV against the Green Bay Packers, where he recorded eight total tackles in the 31–25 loss.

2011–2014
Set to become a free agent in the 2014 offseason, the Steelers made no attempt to resign Clark. The Steelers proceeded with their plans to replace him after they signed Mike Mitchell to a long-term contract on March 11, 2014, to become the team's new starting free safety.

Washington Redskins (second stint)
On March 31, 2014, Clark returned to Washington on a one-year contract. With DeAngelo Hall on injured reserve, he was named the team's defensive captain in his place. He recorded his only interception of the season against quarterback Andrew Luck in the loss against the Indianapolis Colts on November 30.

Retirement
On February 18, 2015, Clark announced his retirement from the NFL. He signed a one-day contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers to ensure he retired a Steeler.
