Manors

Langley
About  southeast of the village is the farmhouse of Langley, a largely mid-19th-century building. It is on the site of a royal hunting lodge that was built for Henry VII. Most of the Tudor monarchs stayed there when hunting in Wychwood Forest. King James I stayed at Langley in August 1605, and a French servant who died was buried at Shipton.  The de Langley family were hereditary keepers of Wychwood Forest, Oxon. The office carried with it the tenancy of the manor of Langley in Shipton-under-Wychwood parish. The heir was Simon Verney (d. 1368) whose brother was William Verney of Byfield, Northants., father of Alice Verney, 1st. wife of John Danvers (d. 1449) of Calthorpe, MP for Oxfordshire 1420, 1421, 1423 and 1435.  The de Langley family held the manor of Shipton, Oxfordshire, and Richard Lee in his Gleanings of Oxfordshire of 1574 states that these arms of "Gules, 2 bars or in chief 2 buck's heads cabossed of the 2nd" were then displayed in a stained glass window in St. Mary's parish church at Shipton with a tomb under it. The buck's heads seem to be a reference to the de Langley office of forester of Wychwood.

Lacey
Shipton Court, the estate of the Lacey family, was built in about 1603 but sold to Sir Compton Reade in 1663. It passed down in the Reade family until 1868 when, on the death of Sir John Reade, it was left to his footman Joseph Wakefield, on condition that he took the name Reade.

Parish church
The Church of England parish church of St. Mary has a tower built in about 1200â€“1250, a 15th-century stone pulpit and font and a Tudor wall monument.  The architect Richard Pace designed Saint Mary's Rectory, which was built in 1818.

Economic and social history
William Langland, the conjectured author of Piers Plowman, is known to have been a tenant in Shipton-under-Wychwood where he died.  The village has three historic public houses: the Shaven Crown Hotel, The Wychwood and the Lamb Inn. The Shaven Crown Hotel overlooking the village green was once a guest house run by the monks of Bruern Abbey. The present building is mainly 15th century. The former leader of the British Union of Fascists, Sir Oswald Mosley stayed at the hotel after his release from internment in 1943. The Lamb Inn is 16th century and is controlled by Greene King Brewery.
