Bedara Kannappa is a 1954 Indian Kannada-language Hindu mythological film directed by H. L. N. Simha and written by G. V. Iyer. The film stars Rajkumar playing the title character along with Pandari Bai, Kushala Kumari, G. V. Iyer, Sandhya and Narasimharaju in other prominent roles.

Bedara Kannappa started as a play produced by the Gubbi Veeranna Nataka Company before it became a Kannada film. The film rights of the play were later bought by A. V. Meiyappan of AVM Productions.

In 1953, Singanalluru Puttaswamaiah Muthuraj, a dramatist with Gubbi Veeranna Nataka Company was spotted by director H. L. N. Simha, who was on the lookout for well-built, pleasant-faced man for the starring role in film. Simha eventually signed Muthuraj for the film and named him Rajkumar. Filming began in mid-1953 and took over two months to complete. This was the debut film of both Rajkumar and Narasimharaju as actors and of G.V. Iyer as a scriptwriter.
