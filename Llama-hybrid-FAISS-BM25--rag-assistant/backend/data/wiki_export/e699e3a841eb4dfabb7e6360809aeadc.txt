The 2006 June rugby union tests (also known as the summer tests in the Northern Hemisphere) were rugby union Test matches played during between June in 2006. It saw several tests between touring Northern Hemisphere sides and home Southern Hemisphere sides, including a test series between Australia and England, Argentina and Wales, New Zealand and Ireland and South Africa and Scotland. France played Romania and the Springboks, while Italy played Fiji and Japan. 

Most of the fixtures acted as end-of-season tours of the Northern Hemisphere nations, and pre season matches for the Tri Nations Series and Pacific 5 Nations for the Southern Hemisphere nations.

Fixtures

The scoreline belied the closeness of the contest, as Ireland were 20 minutes away from a first-ever win over the All Blacks, holding a 23–15 lead halfway through the second half.

This was Scotland's largest-ever defeat in South Africa.

 This was Argentina's first-ever Test in Patagonia. Puerto Madryn was the site where the first Welsh colonists arrived in Argentina, leading to the establishment of Y Wladfa in the 1860s.

 Argentina win a Test series against Wales for the first time.

 This was England's fifth consecutive Test defeat, their worst streak since 1984. Australia's George Gregan made his 120th international appearance, setting an all-time record for the sport.

 Fiji claim a Six Nations scalp for the first time since 2000, when they defeated Italy (then newly admitted to the Six Nations), the last time the Azzurri visited Churchill Park.

 Fullback Percy Montgomery became the first Springbok to score 600 Test points.

 South Africa suffered their first defeat at home since 2003. The result meant that the teams switched places in the world rankings, with France overtaking South Africa for second.
