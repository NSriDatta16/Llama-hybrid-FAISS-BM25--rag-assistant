Pink Floyd's David Gilmour or simply David Gilmour is a film by David Gilmour from his 1984 tour from the album About Face for Europe.

The film is mainly a concert performance from The Hammersmith Odeon in London in April 1984, and also features promotional clips.

A documentary called After The Floyd which followed Gilmour on the 1984 solo tour includes interviews with David on tour buses (the bus driver refers to David as ex-guitarist of Pink Floyd) and in hotel rooms. Also included is more live footage of concerts and soundchecks in Europe. It is now out of production.

The VHS was not released in Europe, apparently due to "lack of commercial interest". This concert footage is now to be found on DVD, released by Crime Crow Productions. The DVD, however, does not contain the extra footage that could be found on the VHS.

Similarly, Sony Music has shown little interest in releasing the title on DVD in the US, possibly due to the age of the concert as well as Gilmour's own dislike of About Face as an album.
