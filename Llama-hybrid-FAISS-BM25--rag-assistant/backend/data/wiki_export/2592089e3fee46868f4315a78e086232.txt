Transport 

Tintenbar has a major highway that crosses through it, called the Pacific Highway.  This is a major road that links Sydney to Brisbane.  It has a large volume of traffic, especially over Easter.

The Tintenbar-end of the Pacific Highway upgrade was completed in early 2011.  An entrance and exit is now provided near the old Ross Lane entrance.  The upgrade means the highway is now further east than the old highway (now renamed Tamarind Drive), is much straighter, and is  dual-carriageway with bicycle lanes on either side.  The Highway was upgraded due to sharp corners which led to several traffic accidents, particularly around Tintenbar Hill.

Previously the Pacific Highway ran along Bangalow Road to Tintenbar along Emigrant Creek.  But this was changed in 1939.

There is no public transport in Tintenbar.  There are some bus routes that are run to transport children to primary and high schools.
