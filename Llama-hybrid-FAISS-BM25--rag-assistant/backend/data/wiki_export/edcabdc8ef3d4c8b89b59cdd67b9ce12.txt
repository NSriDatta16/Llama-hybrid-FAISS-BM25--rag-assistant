Montenegrin cuisine is a result of Montenegro's geographic position and its long history and tradition.

Review 

The first major influences to Montenegrin cuisine came from the Levant and Turkey, largely via Serbia: sarma, musaka, pilav, pita, gibanica, burek, ćevapi, kebab, đuveč, and Turkish sweets such as baklava and tulumba.

Hungarian cuisine influences stews and sataraš. Central European cuisine is evident in the prevalence of crêpes, doughnuts, jams, many types of biscuits and cakes, and various kinds of breads.

Montenegrin cuisine also varies geographically; the cuisine in the coastal area differs from that of the northern highland region. The coastal area is traditionally a representative of Mediterranean cuisine, with seafood being a common dish. The traditional dishes of Montenegro's Adriatic coast, unlike its heartland, have a distinctively Italian influence as well.

Common dishes

Bread
Homemade-style bread prepared in Montenegro is closest to what is known in Italy as pane casareccio. It is served with every meal. Types include ječmeni (barley bread), ražani (rye bread), pšenični (wheat bread), and rumetinov (corn bread).

Breakfast
 Cicvara - stewed cornmeal with kaymak (salted and then compressed fresh cream).
 Gibanica with yoghurt or kisjelo mlijeko (buttermilk).
 Popara and bread with kajmak
 Pršut (most notable is njeguški pršut)

Soups
Montenegrin language distinguishes between a clear soup (supa, pronounced ), a thick soup or stew (čorba, pronounced ), and a porridge-style dish (kaša, pronounced ). Soups are usually served as the first course of lunch at midday:

 Kokošija supa (chicken broth)
 Goveđa/juneća/teleća supa (beef/calf broth)
 Jagnjeća supa (lamb broth)

Traditionally, after the broth is made, a handful of rice is added to the pot to make the soup more substantial. Nowadays, pasta has taken over as the preferred addition.
