Georges P. Vanier Secondary School is a high school in Courtenay, British Columbia, Canada.  The school was named after Georges P. Vanier, one of Canada's most popular Governors General.

History
The school opened in January 1968, completing a move of students from the old Courtenay Senior High School.  Vanier was built to have a capacity of 1200 students.  The school population grew to more than 1700 in the early 2000s, with the addition of 36 portable classrooms. This led to the opening of Mark R. Isfeld Senior Secondary School, which became the third district secondary school in the early 2000s.

In 2016, the school started a $33.8Â million upgrade.
