The posterior interosseous recurrent artery (or recurrent interosseous artery) branches off the posterior interosseous artery near its origin. It ascends between the lateral epicondyle and olecranon, beneath the anconeus, upon or through the substance of the supinator muscle. It anastomoses with the middle collateral artery, posterior ulnar recurrent artery, and ulnar collateral artery. The artery is sometimes absent.
