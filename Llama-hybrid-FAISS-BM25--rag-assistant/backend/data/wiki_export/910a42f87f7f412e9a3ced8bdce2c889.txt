The park is part of the larger Muskwa-Kechika Management Area.  The community of Liard River, British Columbia is located nearby.

History and conservation

The Liard River Hot Springs Provincial Park was created in April 1957. The first boardwalk and pool facilities were built by the United States Army in 1942.  The Liard River Hot Springs proper are located at .  They were originally named the Theresa Hot Springs.

The park contains a warm water swamp and boreal forest which supports rich and diverse plant communities as well as mammal and bird species. Watch for moose feeding in the warm water swamps. Bears, as well, are a common hazard in summer months, and may be feeding only  away from bathers. Due to the lush plant life (including 14 species of orchids) influenced by the warmth of the springs, the area used to be known as the "Tropical Valley". A rare predatory black bear attack occurred on August 14, 1997, claiming two lives.
