History
Kanal 24 was awarded the license for the so-called FM4 network in 2003, which since 1994 had been occupied by P4. The Minister of Culture, Valgerd Svarstad Haugland announced the new station, which at that time was called Kanal4 as the winner of the FM4-license. P4 later received the license for the so-called FM5 network. Because of this, Kanal 24 took over the frequencies used previously by P4, while the latter got new, previously unused frequencies.

Kanal 24 had a rough start. Partially because P4 claiming the name Kanal 4 was too similar, and P4 also shut down their old transmitters before Kanal 24 went on the air on 1 January 2004. The main investors in Kanal 24 where TV 2, Fædrelandsvennen and Adresseavisen, who have since sold their shares.
