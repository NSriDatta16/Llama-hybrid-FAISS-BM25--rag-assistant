The University of Warwick Science Park (also known as UWSP and Warwick Science Park) was one of the first university based science parks in the United Kingdom when it was opened by the Rt. Hon. Margaret Thatcher in 1984. It was a joint venture between the University of Warwick, Coventry City Council, Warwickshire County Council and Barclays. The latter are no longer shareholders having been replaced by WM Enterprise. The University of Warwick agreed in 2011 to purchase the shareholding of Coventry City Council. The acquisition was completed in 2012 and today the Science Park is wholly owned by the University of Warwick. UWSP currently covers four sites; the main campus abutting the University of Warwick, the Business Innovation Centre in Binley, Warwick Innovation Centre on Warwick Technology Park and Blythe Valley Innovation Centre near Solihull.

UWSP typically provides office, workshop and lab space for up to 150 businesses.

History

The University of Warwick Science Park was established in 1982 by the then Vice Chancellor of the University of Warwick, Lord Butterworth. The first building, the Barclay's Venture Centre (now the Venture Centre) was formally opened by UK Prime Minister the Rt. Hon. Margaret Thatcher on 24 February 1984. In 2004, UWSP was awarded the 'Incubator of the Year' award by UKBI. The founding Director of UWSP, David Rowe, was awarded the Queen's Award for Enterprise Promotion in 2006.
In 2012 the University of Warwick acquired sole ownership of the Science Park.
