Early life
Ganga Singh was born on the auspicious day of Vijay Dashmi on 13 October 1880 to Maharaj Shri Lal Singh Sahib and his wife Maji Shri Chandravatiji Sahiba. He hailed from Royal Rajput family of Bikaner State. He was brother to Dungar Singh, whom he succeeded on 16 December 1888.

He received his early education from Pandit Ram Chandra Dube. He was educated privately at Mayo College, Ajmer, where he studied for five years. Later, he was tutored by Sir Brian Egerton, who also provided him administrative training.

As a ruler, he established a Chief Court in Bikaner, presided over by a Chief Judge who was assisted by two judges. Bikaner was the first State in Rajasthan to take such a step. He announced the establishment of a Representative Assembly in 1913. He later established a High Court with a Chief Justice and two sub-judges by an edict in 1922. Maharaja Ganga Singhji was the first prince in Rajputana to grant full charter of powers to a high court.

Achievements 

 Singh constructed the Ganga Canal. He inspired people to come and settle in this new Command area. A large population settled there from the surrounding areas of Punjab. Among them, the Sikh families, mostly landowners, migrated to the region in the 1920s, when the canal was built by Maharaja Ganga Singh of the former Bikaner state and brought waters of the Satluj River from the adjoining Ferozepur District in Punjab. There were no permanent settlements in the area except for a few towns under the old Bikaner state.
 He successfully dealt with the worst famine of the year 1899–1900 AD in the region. The famine inspired the young Maharaja to establish an irrigation system to get rid of the problem permanently.
 He developed the city of Sri Ganganagar and its surrounding area as the most fertile grain bowl of Rajasthan.
 He also constructed the Lalgarh Palace at Bikaner (named in memory of his father Lall Singh) between 1902 and 1926.
 He brought railways and an electricity network to the state.
 He introduced prison reforms. Bikaner prisoners wove and crafted carpets of India that were sold in the international markets.
 He established partial internal democracy such as election to the municipalities and appointed a council of ministers to aid and advice.
 Some land reforms were also introduced.
 He induced enterprising industrialists and agriculturists from neighbouring state for starting new ventures in his state.
 He built the existing temple above the Samadhi of Ramdev Pir at Ramdevra in year 1931.
 He founded several schools and colleges, especially of women
 He donated two ornately-designed silver gates to be used as main doors of Karni Mata Temple at Deshnok.
