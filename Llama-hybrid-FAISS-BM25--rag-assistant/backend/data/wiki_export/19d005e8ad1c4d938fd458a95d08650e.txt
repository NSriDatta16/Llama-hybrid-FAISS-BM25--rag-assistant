"Feel What You Want" is a song by American club music singer-songwriter Kristine W, released in 1994 as the first single from her debut album, Land of the Living (1996). It was produced by British producer Rollo and became a huge number-one club hit in both the UK and US. The song also reached number four in the Netherlands and number 22 in Belgium. On the Eurochart Hot 100, it peaked at number 83 in September 1994. On the UK Singles Chart, it charted three times; first time at number 33 in 1994, then at number 40 with a 1997 remix by German producer Peter Ries and last time in 2001 at number 85. "Feel What You Want" was also featured on the soundtrack of Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories on the Rise FM radio station. Its music video was directed by Lindy Heymann.

Background
Kristine W wrote "Feel What You Want" with Rollo and Rob Dougan. When asked in an interview about how she came up with this song, she said,

Critical reception
AllMusic editor John Bush felt that on "Feel What You Want", Kristine W. proves that she probably is "the most soulful vocalist in dance music, period." Larry Flick from Billboard wrote that after being the center of a fierce major-label bidding war, "this European dance/pop smash is finally available domestically—and the odds are mighty good that it will meet with similar success here both on dancefloors and over radio airwaves. Kristine has a striking voice, and she turns in an urgent performance that transforms the house-rooted song into an anthem to be reckoned with. Will sound great on boom-boxes on the beach." William Stevensen from Entertainment Weekly declared it as an "infectious anthem". Pan-European magazine Music & Media said that "a keyboard and a voice alone usually lead to a ballad. Dance has its own rules though. If there was a prize for the most sparsely arranged pop dance record, this track would win." Andy Beevers from Music Week rated it five out of five, stating that "the uplifting and catchy song is highly distinctive." In 1997, the magazine's Alan Jones viewed it as "haunting" and "one of the finest Rollo/Sister Bliss creations". 

Michael Morley from Muzik described it as "storming". A reviewer from The Network Forty remarked that it is "displaying a unique dance groove". Ben Wener from Orange County Register called it "irresistible". People Magazine named "Feel What You Want" as the "standout cut" on the Land of the Living album, noting "the thumping house rhythm, exuberant keyboard motif and her whopping vocal". Brad Beatnik from the RM Dance Update commented, "A record that needs no introduction, suffice to say that if you haven't heard, or heard of, it by now, you must be living like a hermit. The deliciously deep, swinging tune is topped by Kristine's restrained garage vocals and is at its most upfront and moody on the Our Tribe mix." Another editor, James Hamilton, declared it as "Vegas lounge singer's Rollo & Rob-D created sparse organ stabbed expressive garage skipper". Frank Own for Vibe named it the 'Vocal House Cut of the Year' and constated that the former Vegas lounge singer "moved the muscle boys this year with this sparse, smoldering floor filler."

Music video
A music video was produced to promote the single, directed by British director Lindy Heymann. It features Kristine W. performing the song dressed as many different characters, including as a clown and Elvis Presley. Heyman would also direct the video for the singer's next single, "One More Try".

Impact and legacy
DJ Magazine ranked "Feel What You Want" number 91 in their list of "Top 100 Club Tunes" in 1998.

Tomorrowland featured the song in their official list of "The Ibiza 500" in 2020.
