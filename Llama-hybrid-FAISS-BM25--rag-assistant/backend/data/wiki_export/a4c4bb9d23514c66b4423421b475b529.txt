Recurring segments
 Bruce Lee and Evel Knievel in Stunt Fu: A cut-out of Bruce Lee and a cut-out of Evel Knievel on a motorcycle are edited into short video clips from the year in question. Bruce Lee generally kicks someone who falls over, and Evel Knievel jumps his motorcycle over someone in each video clip.
 Charo TV: Charo, who was a frequent television guest star in the 1970s, presents ideas of how she could have been introduced into the cast of a popular show from the time period. Each idea includes some reference to her "cuchi cuchi" catchphrase.
 Porn or Not Porn: John Waters features a segment in which he poses a small test to see whether or not three films, selected based on their suggestive titles, are either considered pornographic or not pornographic. He ends the segment by stating he found a vintage copy of a parodic pornographic film.
 It's Time for Burt Reynolds' Mustache: The segment shows a picture of Burt Reynolds from the relevant year, illustrating how his mustache changed over time (or 1972 was gone from his face), and is introduced by several voices annoyingly chanting the segment's title and is followed by the same voices chanting "That was Burt Reynolds' mustache."
 Songs to Make Whoopee To: Bob Eubanks presents the love songs from each year. Some of the song titles are fake, and merely read aloud; whenever he reads the title of an actual song, a clip of the song is played. The segment takes the form of an advertisement for an album, also available on 8-track and cassette.
 Then and Now: Alison Arngrim presents the segment for each year in which pop culture personalities from the decade are shown in pictures from the 1970s and today, a difference of thirty years which she emphasizes.
 Look Who's Got a Farrah Do: The segment takes a look at each year to see what celebrity had a hairdo similar to that of Charlie's Angels star Farrah Fawcett.
 Guitar Gods: Peter Frampton presents the guitar players of each year.
 Survivors: Gloria Gaynor presents the survivors of each year. Each segment begins by Gaynor citing three trends she survived that year.
 What Dom Cooked For...: The segment has actor Dom DeLuise telling viewers what food he would make for an actor, or some actors, and the name of the food would be based on a film, TV program, etc. from the episode's year.
 That's No Jive Turkey: The segment takes place near the end of an episode and would let a certain celebrity give one last opinion on a topic that was covered in the episode.
 Hey, I'm Not a Brady: Christopher Knight has a rant for each year over how he does not wish to be known as Peter Brady anymore. Each year features Knight drawing a contrast between a member of the show's cast and the character that actor portrayed.
 Guess This Joe: At the conclusion of each episode, there's a small puzzle being put together of a famous person named Joe, with the viewer's job being to "Guess this Joe" before the puzzle is finished and the identity is revealed. Some segments involve a celebrity with a related name, such as "Joey," "Jos√©" or "Joseph." The lyrics to the "Guess this Joe" song are: "Guess this Joe, it's a Joe you know, if you don't know this Joe, then it's a Joe you don't know, so if you guess this Joe, it's a Joe you know, guess this Joe, hey, guess this Joe..."
During the credits of every episode, a performance of a popular song from that decade was played with no commentary. These were usually replaced with a show promo by VH1.
