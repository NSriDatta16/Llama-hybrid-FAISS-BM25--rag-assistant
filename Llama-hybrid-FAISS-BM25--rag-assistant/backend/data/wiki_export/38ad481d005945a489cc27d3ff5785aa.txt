Events
Somewhere in 1958 the Sicilian Mafia composed its first Sicilian Mafia Commission. It was formed among Mafia families in the province of Palermo, which had the highest concentration of cosche (Mafia families), approximately 46. Salvatore "Ciaschiteddu" Greco was appointed as its first segretario (secretary) or rappresentante regionale, essentially a "primus interpares" – the first among equals. Initially, the secretary had very little power. His task was simply to organize the meetings.
As a result of the Apalachin Conference, the FBI is forced to acknowledge the existence of organized crime and begins compiling a detailed report on the Mafia, known as, "La Cosa Nostra".
In a prelude to the Gallo-Profaci gang war, Gallo begins operating independently of the Profaci crime family.
