Michael John Miller (born 22 April 1951) is a Scottish professional golfer.

Miller was born in Lenzie, East Dunbartonshire, near Glasgow. He turned professional in 1978 at a relatively late age, and was the European Tour's Sir Henry Cotton Rookie of the Year in 1979. That year he lost a playoff to Mark James at the Welsh Golf Classic. He never came closer than that to winning a European Tour event, though he finished second in the 1983 Kronenbourg Open. His best ranking on the European Tour Order of Merit was forty-seventh in 1981. However he has won several professional tournaments, including one each on the Challenge Tour and the European Seniors Tour, which he joined in 2001.
