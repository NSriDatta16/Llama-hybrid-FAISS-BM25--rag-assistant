Church and chapel

Church of England
The Church of England parish church of All Saints was originally 13th century. The west wall of the nave has a recess containing a small bell cast by Henry I Bagley of Chacombe in 1673. In 1863 the church was almost entirely rebuilt to plans by the architect William White, who added a bell tower, separate from the church, built over the lychgate. It is one of only three such bell towers in Britain to be so sited. All Saints' parish is now part of the Benefice of Shires' Edge along with those of Claydon, Cropredy, Mollington and Wardington.

Methodist
Great Bourton village hall used to be the Methodist Chapel.

History
