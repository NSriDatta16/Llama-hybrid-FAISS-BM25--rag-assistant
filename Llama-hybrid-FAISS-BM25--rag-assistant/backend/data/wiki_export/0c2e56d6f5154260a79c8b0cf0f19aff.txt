Team information

Les Vernets

The Patinoire des Vernets was built in 1959 and is located in the Geneva neighborhood of the same name. It serves as the main arena for the GSHC. It was renovated in 2009 in order to increase the spectator capacity from 6400 to 7140.

On January 24, 2012, local authorities and the club reached an agreement to build a new arena, in another part of town, with a seating capacity of 10,000. In 2012, it was scheduled to open by 2015, or possibly 2016. As of 2019, construction has yet to start.

Mascots

The official mascots of Genève-Servette are Calvin and Calvina, two anthropomorphic eagles that first appeared at the beginning of the 2006-2007 season. They are Switzerland's first and only mascot duet. Their names are derived from John Calvin, famous theologian of the Protestant reformation in Geneva.

In addition, Sherkan, a bald eagle, opens every home game by flying throughout the arena, reaching for his master standing in the center of ice. Sherkan is very popular amongst fans and players alike. Sherkan is Europe's first living animal to partake in an ice-hockey game opening ceremony.

Sherkan first appeared during the NLB playoffs of 2001 and has been present to every home game ever since, only missing two.

Chris McSorley served as head coach and general manager between 2001 and 2017 and was also co-owner until 2014, alongside Hugh Quennec.
