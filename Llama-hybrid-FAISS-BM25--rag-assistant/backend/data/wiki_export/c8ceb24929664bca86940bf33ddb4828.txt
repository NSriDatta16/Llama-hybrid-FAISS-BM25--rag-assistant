Stage
Lacey made her stage debut, performing with Mrs Patrick Campbell, in The Thirteenth Chair at the West Pier Brighton on 13 April 1925. Her first appearance in the West End was in July 1926 in Cock o' the Roost at the Garrick Theatre.

Her other West End credits included The Beetle (Strand Theatre 1928), The Venetian (Little Theatre 1931; her Broadway debut, at the Masque Theatre, followed in the same play the same year), The Green Bay Tree (St Martin's Theatre 1933), After the Dance (St James' Theatre 1939), The Late Edwina Black (Ambassadors Theatre 1949), Tiger at the Gates (Apollo Theatre 1955; she appeared at the Plymouth Theatre on Broadway in the same play later the same year), The Tiger and the Horse (Queen's Theatre 1960) and I Never Sang for My Father (Duke of York's Theatre 1970).

Having acted at Stratford and the Old Vic in 1935/36, she returned to both companies in later years: to the Old Vic in 1951 (Clytemnestra in Electra) and 1962 (Aase in Peer Gynt, Emilia in Othello), and to the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1967, playing Volumnia in Coriolanus and the Countess of Rousillon in All's Well That Ends Well.
