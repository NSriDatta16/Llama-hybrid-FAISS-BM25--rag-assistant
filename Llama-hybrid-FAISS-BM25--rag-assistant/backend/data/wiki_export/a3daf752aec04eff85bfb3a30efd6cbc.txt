Course
The river originates at the confluence of the Zhaldama and Kara-Turgai rivers, which have their sources in the Kazakh Uplands. It  then flows along the Turgay Depression. The Turgay disappears in the endorheic basin of Shalkarteniz.

The Ubagan, a tributary of the Tobol, drains the valley to the north, the Turgay to the south. There are many shallow, often salty lakes in the valley. In the summer it dries up and its water becomes salty in the lower reaches of certain sections. The river is mostly fed by snow. It freezes in November and thaws in April.

Tributaries
The main tributaries of the Turgay are the  long Irgiz, the  long Kara-Turgay and the Kobarga on the left, as well as the Zhaldama, Tokanay and Ulkayak on the right. In years of high water the  long Saryozen river may flow across lake Sarykopa into the Turgay through a channel near Tauysh village.
