The 2000–01 Serie A (known as the Serie A TIM for sponsorship reasons) was the 99th season of top-tier Italian football, the 69th in a round-robin tournament. It was contested by 18 teams, for the 13th consecutive season since 1988–89.

Roma won its first Scudetto since 1982–83, its third title overall. Juventus finished second, and these two teams automatically qualified for the first group stage of the 2001–02 UEFA Champions League. Lazio, the defending champions, and Parma finished third and fourth respectively, to enter the third qualifying round of the same competition. Internazionale and Milan finished fifth and sixth respectively, and qualified for the 2001–02 UEFA Cup along with Fiorentina, the winners of the Coppa Italia. Brescia gained entry into the 2001 UEFA Intertoto Cup.

Vicenza, Napoli and Bari were automatically relegated to Serie B. Reggina and Hellas Verona were forced to contest a relegation tie-breaker after finishing level on points, with Verona winning on away goals to relegate Reggina.

Rule changes
In the middle of the season, the old quota system was abolished, meaning that each team was no longer limited to having no more than five non-EU players and using no more than three in each match.

Passport scandal
Concurrent with the abolition of the quota system, the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) investigated footballers from South America and Africa who had used fake passports in order to enable their teams to field them as Europeans. Alberto, Warley, Alejandro Da Silva and Jorginho of Udinese, Fábio Júnior and Gustavo Bartelt of Roma, Dida of Milan, Álvaro Recoba of Inter, Thomas Job, Francis Zé and Jean Ondoa of Sampdoria, and Jeda and André Leone of Vicenza were all handed bans in July 2001, ranging from six months to one year. However, most of these bans were subsequently reduced.
