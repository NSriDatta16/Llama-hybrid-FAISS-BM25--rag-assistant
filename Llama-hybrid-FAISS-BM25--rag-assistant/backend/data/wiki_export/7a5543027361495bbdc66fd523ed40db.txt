Biography

Early life 
Altynai Asylmuratova was born in Almaty, Kazakhstan into a theatrical family: the life of her parents and grandparents were associated with ballet. Altynai Asylmuratova's parents were graduates of the Leningrad Choreographic School. Her father, Abduakhim Asylmuratov, honored Artist of the Kazakh SSR, was a soloist of the Abay Opera House, after – the artistic director of the Almaty choreographic school. Her grandfather was the chief choreographer of the Kazakh National Conservatory, and her paternal great-grandfather was a deputy of the State Duma (Russian Empire) of the first convocation.  

Her mother, Galina Sidorova, was originally from Leningrad, where her parents danced on the stage in the 1920s and 30s. After graduating from college, Galina Sidorova married a military man, during World War II on the Eastern Front. Together with Galina Sidorova's parents, Galina was evacuated to Almaty. There Galina began to dance in the ballet troupe of the Abay Opera House and, having divorced her first husband, married Abduakhim Asylmuratov. After the end of the war, Galina Sidorova stayed in Almaty, where Altynai was born. 

Altynai spent her childhood behind the scenes of the theater. She loved to dance, but her mother, knowing the difficulties of the profession, did not want to send her child to a ballet school. Altynai was sent to Leningrad for the entrance exams to the Leningrad Choreographic School only thanks to the persistence of her grandmother and grandfather.

Ballet career 
Asylmuratova graduated in 1978 in the class of Inna Zubkovskaya, after which she was accepted into the corps de ballet of the Kirov State Academic Theatre of Opera and Ballet. From 1980 to 1999, Asylmuratova was a soloist of this theater, and was also a prima ballerina from 1987 to 1999. She worked with teacher/tutor Olga Moiseeva. Asylmuratova was also a soloist of the Royal Ballet from 1989 to 1993.

Asylmuratova became more popular in Western theaters than in those of her home country due to her frequent guest appearances abroad, including Roland Petit's company. She was much admired both for her looks and the beauty of her dancing. Her repertoire included all the classical ballet rôles in Swan Lake, The Sleeping Beauty, Giselle, Don Quixote, and La Bayadère, Mikhail Fokine pieces such as The Firebird and Les Sylphides, as well as modern classics like Romeo and Juliet, works by choreographer George Balanchine and Roland Petit. Among Asylmuratova's partners were dancers Konstantin Zaklinsky, Farukh Ruzimatov, Evgenii Neff, Igor Zelensky, Makhar Vaziev (in St. Petersburg), Irek Mukhamedov (in London), and Jan Brex (in Marseille).

Videos of her dancing in Le Corsaire, La Bayadère, Les Sylphides, and The Sleeping Beauty  are available. In addition, Asylmuratova was the subject of a 1982 documentary Backstage at the Kirov which followed her as she prepared to dance the lead in Swan Lake.

In 1999, she received the St. Petersburg theater award "Golden Sofit" for her performance of the title role in the ballet Carmen, staged at the Mariinsky Theater. In the same year, at the peak of her career, Asylmuratova left the stage and took up teaching at her alma mater, the Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet.

In 2000 she was appointed artistic director of the Vaganova Academy. 

In 2002 and again in 2012, she was a juror of Benois de la Danse. In 2003, she was a juror of the international competition Le Prix de Lausanne (Switzerland), and was repeatedly a juror of the Dance Open (St. Petersburg).

In 2013, Asylmuratova was forced to resign from her position at Vaganova after the new rector, Nikolai Tsiskaridze, was appointed by the Ministry of Culture.
She was immediately invited to work at the Mikhailovsky Theater, where from 13 December 2013 to March 2014, she was an adviser to the General Director for ballet. In 2015, Asylmuratova became artistic director of ballet at Astana Opera, Kazakhstan. In 2016 Nursultan Nazarbaev hired her as rector of the Kazakhstan Academy of Choreography.
