Plot 
Diana (Sara Maldonado) teenage girl, who was emotionally neglected from her parents, and felt unwanted. After being expelled from her boarding school in Switzerland, Diana goes back to live with her parents. Diana's aunt, Pilar, comes over and witnesses a great deal fighting and tension within the household.

She offers solace to Diana by letting her live with her. Diana goes to the mall where she bumps into Braulio (Aarón Díaz). She keeps bumping into him in various places, especially school. Braulio was orphaned when he was about twelve years old.

He lives with his wicked aunt; his kind, but oblivious uncle; and his cruel cousin, Esteban (Jorge de Silva). Braulio has a friend named Conny (Sherlyn) who tries to date him, but he isn't interested. Conny absolutely hates Diana as he is attracted to her. Braulio later finds out that Diana comes from a rich background, something Diana never told him, which leads to them splitting up. Diana later ends up dating Esteban, not knowing that he is Braulio's wicked cousin.

The plot, in essence, tells the story of several teens in a school. The story lines are designed to affect pre-teen minds: The orphan Braulio, Diana at her boarding school, and Connie and her parents winning the lottery, to name just a few.

In addition to all this, when Aunt Pilar (Erika Buenfil) first registers Diana into school, she meets her long lost love, Álvaro, who works at the school. Álvaro also works with Emma, who has feelings for him, but now that Pilar is back in the picture, Álvaro only has eyes for Pilar.

Things change when Alvaro mistakenly thinks Pilar is married, and sleeps with Emma. After finding out his mistake, Álvaro goes back to Pilar, but keeps his affair with Emma a secret, even when Pilar asks if there was anything going on.

The jealous Emma finds out that Álvaro is dating Pilar after seeing the two at a restaurant. She later discovers she is pregnant and lies to Álvaro, telling him that she is positive that he is the father. (She doesn't mention that she had also slept with Esteban.)
