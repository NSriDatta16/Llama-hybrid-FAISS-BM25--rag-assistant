History
The history of the settlement goes back to Neolithic times, and it is thought that the city was founded by Celts sometime in the period between 550 BC and 50 BC. Sometime around 100 AD, the Romans conquered the area around the city, although they were in turn overthrown by Alemannic tribes in the vicinity of 300 AD.

In Germany, because many cities are extremely old and dating is inexact, a city's official history is considered to begin at the first time it is mentioned in writing. Holzgerlingen was first mentioned in the year 1007 in a history written by the Bishop of Bamberg during the reign of Henry II of the Holy Roman Empire. The city was in the possession of the Palatinate of Tübingen from approximately 1100 until 1348, when the city was sold to the state of Württemberg.

The city was deeply affected by the German Peasants' War, a popular revolt which took place in 1525. The Protestant Reformation reached the city in 1534, and the city has remained Lutheran ever since. In 1735, during the War of the Polish Succession, Russian troops were quartered in the city as they marched on France. Just eight years later, in 1743, the city was used to quarter troops for Franz Freiherr von der Trenck during the War of the Austrian Succession.

In 1812 fifteen people from Holzgerlingen joined the troops of Napoleon for his war against Russia so their families would be guaranteed safety, but never returned. The first post office was constructed in 1865, and in 1907, the city was connected to the electric power grid. In 1945, during World War II, French troops burned down the city hall. It was rebuilt in 1950. The city obtained home-rule rights from the German government in 1993.

Religion
The Protestant Reformation reached the city in 1534. In 1635, since then the town has been influenced by Protestantism.
