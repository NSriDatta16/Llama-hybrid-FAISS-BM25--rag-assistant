Kabzeel () is a Hebrew Bible place name. It was the most remote city of Judah; located in southern Judah on the border of Edom (Idumaea) (). The location is tentatively identified with Khirbet Hora (Horvat Hur), about 10 km (6 mi) ENE of Beersheba. Kabzeel was the birthplace of Benaiah, one of David's chief warriors (; ). Following the Exile, it was resettled under the name Jekabzeel ().
