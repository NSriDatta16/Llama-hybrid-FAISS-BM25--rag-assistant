Zopf or Züpfe ( in French and  in Italian) is a type of Swiss, Austrian, and German bread made from white flour, milk, eggs, butter and yeast. The  is typically brushed with egg yolk, egg wash, or milk before baking, lending it its golden crust. It is baked in the form of a plait and traditionally eaten on Sunday mornings.
The German and French names are derived from the shape of the bread, meaning "braid" or "pigtail."

Swiss Zopf differs from other braid-shaped breads such as Challah or Hefekranz by way of being unsweetened.
