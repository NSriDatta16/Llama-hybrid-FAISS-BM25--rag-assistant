Scooby-Doo and the Ghoul School is a 1988 animated comedy horror made-for-television film produced by Hanna-Barbera for syndication as part of the Hanna-Barbera Superstars 10 series.

Plot
Scooby-Doo, Shaggy, and Scrappy-Doo are on their way to Miss Grimwood's Finishing School for Girls, where they have been hired as gym teachers. However, once there, they find that it is actually a school for daughters of paranormal beings. The pupils include Sibella, the daughter of Count Dracula; Elsa Frankenteen, the daughter of Frankenteen Sr.; Winnie, the daughter of the Wolfman; Phantasma (usually called Phanty for short) the ghostly daughter of a phantom; and Tanis (named after an Egyptian city), the daughter of the Mummy–all inspired by Universal Monsters of the 1930s-40s. Other residents include a floating white hand; an octopus butler; a two-headed shark that lives in the school's moat; Legs, a spider that helps with the upcoming volleyball match; Miss Grimwood, the headmistress; and her diminutive pet dragon Matches. Frightened by this, Shaggy and Scooby are initially hesitant, but they ultimately agree to stay as gym teachers.

At the annual volleyball match against the boys of the neighboring Calloway Military Academy, the boys rig the volleyball with a remote control, but Scooby accidentally swallows the remote and allows the girls to win instead.

The girls' fathers come for an open house party on Halloween night. Though Scooby and Shaggy fear being trapped in a house full of ghosts and monsters, the fathers are friendly and polite, and the party is a success. Before leaving, the fathers warn a fearful Shaggy and Scooby not to let any harm come to their daughters, lest they face severe consequences.

A power-hungry witch named Revolta and her minion the Grim Creeper plan to kidnap the girls and make them her slaves. She starts by hypnotizing Shaggy into taking the girls on a field trip to the Barren Bog. Matches wants to come along, but is told to stay. The Calloway Cadets are also at the bog on a hike and get stuck in quicksand, but are saved by Elsa and Tanis. Meanwhile, Revolta's spider bats slowly capture the girls one by one as Revolta makes a potion that will turn them evil forever at the stroke of midnight. Figuring this out, Scooby, Scrappy, Shaggy and Matches, who catches up with them, head for Revolta's castle. Scrappy tries to convince the Cadets to join them, but they refuse, believing that the girls stole the volleyball match. Arriving at the castle, the gang faces an evil Mirror Monster that can change its shape to look like evil versions of those who look at its mirror, a giant Well Dweller, and Revolta herself. When the clock strikes midnight, Revolta gives the girls the potion through hairdryers, which instantly takes effect. However, Scooby and Shaggy manage to interrupt the process and accidentally reverse the potion's effect. Elsa then throws Revolta's wand into the potion, which causes it to start exploding. At this point, the Cadets, having felt remorseful for treating the girls poorly and respecting them for saving their lives, arrive in a pedal power helicopter and fly everyone to safety as Revolta swears vengeance.

Soon afterward, the Cadets and the Grimwood Girls throw a party celebrating Revolta's defeat and everyone's heroism. Despite being well liked by all their students, Shaggy and Scooby run away in terror when new monsters; such as an alien, the Gill-man and Godzilla enroll their daughters at the school for the following year. As they leave, they see the girls and Matches waving goodbye. Shaggy, Scooby and Scrappy then give them a last werewolf howl before driving off into the night.
