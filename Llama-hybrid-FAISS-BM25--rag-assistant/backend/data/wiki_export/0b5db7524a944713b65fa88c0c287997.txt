Jacob ben Joseph Reischer (Bechofen) (1661–1733) was an Austrian rabbi and halakhist.

Biography
Jacob Reischer was born in Prague. He was the son of Rabbi Joseph Reischer, author of Giv'ot 'Olam, and a pupil of R. Simon Spira of Prague. Reischer married Spira's granddaughter, the daughter of his son Benjamin Wolf.

Rabbinic career
Reischer was dayyan at Prague, whence he was called to the rabbinate of Rzeszów in Galicia, deriving his name Reischer from that city, which is known as Reische among the Jews. He was subsequently called to the rabbinate of Ansbach, and then occupied a similar position at Worms, from 1713 to 1719, when he went to Metz, officiating there until his death in February 1733.  He is buried in the Jewish cemetery in Metz.
