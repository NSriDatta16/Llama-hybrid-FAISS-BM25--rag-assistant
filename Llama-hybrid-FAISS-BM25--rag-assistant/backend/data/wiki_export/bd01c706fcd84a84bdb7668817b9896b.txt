Fairy Tale () is the third solo album by Malaysian Chinese singer Michael Wong, released on 21 January 2005.

Wong's previous two albums, Michael's First Album and Ray of Light earned a fan base but did not make much ground in terms of record sales. Fairy Tale was critically acclaimed and became Wong's best-selling album.

Title song 
The first single from this album, also called Fairy Tale, was composed by himself. Wong, who is more of a composer and hardly wrote lyrics, asked about 30 lyricists for suggestions for this particular song. After finally adding a finishing touch to the song with lyrics he wrote himself, he then left it to be arranged and produced by the experienced Japanese producer, Taichi Nakamura. Fairy Tale is considered by many fans as Wong's strongest single. It became number one at the Baidu 500 immediately after it was released in January 2005, making it to the top of the download counter  for 15 weeks. The single is arguably the most successful Chinese language song in the 21st Century. As of 2007 it is still among the top in the karaoke charts. Wong became the first Malaysian to win four main awards in the Chinese music scene's biggest award show, the Hong Kong TVB8 Golden Music Awards on 3 December 2005. He won Best Composition, Best Composer/Artist, Top Ten Songs of the Year, and Best of the Year's Top 10 Songs.

The music video accompanying Fairy Tale has been the subject of heated debate. It depicts Wong playing the song at a concert, transmitted to a girl in a hospital bed by phone. Intermittent flashbacks during the song reveal that she had a nosebleed before collapsing. She was most likely suffering from some form of cancer. At the conclusion of the video, she dies, and a voice-over says, "When the whole world ignores me, only you can never ignore me okay?"

As of 2021, the song is celebrated as a cult classic among the overseas Chinese community, often described as the one Mandarin song that everyone knows, regardless of how strong or weak their link to Chinese culture is. This is especially prevalent on the widely popular Facebook group Subtle Asian Traits.
