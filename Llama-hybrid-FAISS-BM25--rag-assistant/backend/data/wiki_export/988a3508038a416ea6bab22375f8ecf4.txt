Bijon Bhattacharya (; 17 July 1906 â€“ 19 January 1978) was an Indian theatre and film actor from West Bengal. He was an eminent playwright and dramatist.

Bhattacharya was born in 1906 at Faridpur (now in Bangladesh) to a Hindu, Bengali Brahmin family, and was an early witness to the destitution and penury of the peasantry of that land. He became a member of the Indian People's Theatre Association (IPTA).
