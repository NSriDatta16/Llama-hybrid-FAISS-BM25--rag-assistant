Under the Covers, Vol. 1 is the first collaboration between alternative rock artist Matthew Sweet and Bangles singer/guitarist Susanna Hoffs. Released by Shout! Factory in 2006, the album contains 15 cover versions of songs from the 1960s and 1970s. The album was a result of their mutual love for songwriting from the 1960s. Matthew Sweet and Susanna Hoffs decided to record an album together in dedication of that era consisting of only cover versions.

The album was released April 2006, and they appeared July 18 on Late Night with Conan O'Brien to promote the album and tour.
