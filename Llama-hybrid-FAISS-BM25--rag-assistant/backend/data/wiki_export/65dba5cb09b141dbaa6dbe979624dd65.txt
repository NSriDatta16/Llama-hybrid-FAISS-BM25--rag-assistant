"Let Me Go" (stylised as "Let Me Go!" on the sleeve of the single) is a song by English synthpop band Heaven 17, released as the lead single from their second album The Luxury Gap. It reached #41 on the UK Singles Chart, the lowest chart placement among the singles from that album but their highest at the time of its release.

In 1983, the song also spent five weeks at #4 on the American dance chart and entered the US Billboard Hot 100.

About the song
Allmusic cites the song as "a club hit that features Glenn Gregory's moody, dramatic lead above a percolating vocal and synth arrangement."

Band member Martyn Ware has acknowledged "Let Me Go" as Heaven 17's finest song: “There’s a certain sonata form to it as well where it builds and then it dies down towards the end. You end with the same chord as the first chord. It feels like an integrated piece of art to me.”

The song was recorded at AIR Studios, London, and made heavy use of its expansive facilities; the opening chord of the song, for instance, consists of 118 multi-tracked voices singing in fourteen-part harmony.

"Let Me Go" was one of the first commercial releases to feature the Roland TB-303, a bass synthesiser which would play a pivotal role in the acid house movement that emerged in Chicago and Manchester later in the decade.

Music Video 
A music video was produced to promote the song. Directed by Steve Barron, the video was primarily filmed in black and white, and starts at Lothbury showing a deserted London. Filming also took place at Marylebone station, which was filmed during the night after the station had closed to passenger services. Behind the scenes footage from the filming at the station featured in an edition of the BBC arts series Riverside, which was broadcast on 29 November 1982.

Legacy
The song appeared at #81 on Q101 Top 500 Songs of "All Time".
