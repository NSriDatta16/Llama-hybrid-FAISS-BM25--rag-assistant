The Conecuh River (upper portion) and Escambia River (lower portion) are a single  river in the southern United States, which flows from Alabama through Florida into the Gulf of Mexico.

The Conecuh River rises near Union Springs, Alabama and flows  in a general southwesterly direction into Florida near the town of Century. The river's name changes from the Conecuh to the Escambia at the junction of Escambia Creek,  downstream from the Florida-Alabama line. After this point, the Escambia River flows  south to Escambia Bay, an arm of Pensacola Bay.

The river is dredged in the lower course.
