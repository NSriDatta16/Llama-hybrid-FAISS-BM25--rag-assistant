Restoration
In 1998, for the Philippines's centennial, the Australian government, through its National Film and Sound Archive, gifted the country with a restored copy of Giliw Ko. In 2022, ABS-CBN Film Restoration Project announced it was undergoing a new scan of the film print.

Restoration Notes for Giliw Ko
Giliw Ko is a 1939 musical drama that was scanned in 2K resolution using the existing 16mm print from LVN Pictures. stored at the ABS-CBN Film Archives. The film elements were in bad shape, with a deep state of vinegar syndrome, irreparable film tear, warps, and crystals. It took nearly 2 years to complete the scanning and enhancement combined because certain scenes had to be repeatedly rescanned frame by frame or at a very slow scan speed due to the image moving out of frame every time the irreparable film tears bump through the scanner’s sprockets. The enhancement of the picture took more than 500 hours to adjust the color and minimize impairments such as flicker, dirt, specks, shallow scratches, and watermarks. Half of the total hours was used for the stabilization of the image due to the heavy shaking caused by the severe warps of the source material.
 
Due to the musical nature of the film, it took close to 2 months to restore the audio and address the ticks and pops, audio drop outs, and “wow” problems. The wobbling music with the deep unintelligible audio track was the most challenging part in the audio restoration given the limited resources available from 16mm print and Betacam tape. Another major challenge that was toughly addressed was the syncing of the audio to the enhanced picture due to the different frame rates of the available source materials.
 
The scanning and enhancement of the picture were completed at the ABS-CBN Film Archives while the audio restoration was done at Narra by Wildsound Studios in 2023.
