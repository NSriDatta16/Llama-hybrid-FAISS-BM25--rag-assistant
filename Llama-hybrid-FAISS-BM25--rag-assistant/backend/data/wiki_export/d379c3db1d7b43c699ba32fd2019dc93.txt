The Intercontinental Tag Team Championship is a professional wrestling tag team title in Japanese promoting Pro Wrestling Zero1, typically reserved for (but not exclusive to) heavyweight (>) wrestlers. It was created on June 14, 2001, three months after then Pro Wrestling Zero-One's creation, when Samoa Joe and Keiji Sakoda (though Zero1 has since ceased to recognize both their reign as well as the following reign by Steve Corino and Mike Rapada) defeated Yuuki Ishikawa and Katsumi Usuda. This was during a time when Zero-One was a member of the National Wrestling Alliance; since the two organizations' parting in late 2004, the NWA does not recognize or sanction it, though it retains the NWA initials. It is one of two tag team titles currently active in Zero1, along with the NWA International Lightweight Tag Team Championship, contested exclusively among junior heavyweights. There have been a total of 56 recognized individual champions and 45 recognized teams, who have had a combined 49 official reigns.
