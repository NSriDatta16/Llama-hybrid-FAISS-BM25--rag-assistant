In 1993, Cartwright joined Electronic Arts. He soon took over producer responsibility on the fledgling PGA Tour line and helped redesign the NBA Live product line. Among the many innovations to the golf line were the first use of digitized golfers, the first EA golf product with 3D terrain, and the first use of a targeting arc and putting guides in a golf product.

Additionally, Cartwright designed the product to include 1-button access to a game server and match server—making this EA's first online multiplayer sports game.
