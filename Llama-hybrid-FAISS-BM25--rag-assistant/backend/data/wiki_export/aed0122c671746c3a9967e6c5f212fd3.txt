History 
The Liberal Friends of Israel group was the first friends of Israel group in the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

The SDP Friends of Israel group was formed in July 1981 with Bill Rodgers as President.

The Liberal Friends of Israel and the SDP Friends of Israel groups were amalgamated into the Liberal Democrat Friends of Israel when the parties merged in 1988.

In July 2020, the LDFI issued a statement expressing "deep concern" about plans by the Israeli Government to annex part of the West Bank.

In October 2020, the LDFI and the Board of Deputies of British Jews jointly wrote to Mendip District Council urging it to adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism, after the council voted unanimously against adopting it.
