John Frederick Campbell, 1st Earl Cawdor  (8 November 1790 – 7 November 1860) was a British peer and MP.

He was born the son of John Campbell, 1st Baron Cawdor and Lady Caroline Howard and educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, graduating BA in 1812. In 1827 he became Viscount Emlyn of Emlyn and Earl Cawdor of Castlemartin in the county of Pembroke.

In June 1812, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. That same year, he stood for election to the House of Commons for Pembrokeshire after the sitting member, Lord Milford, stood down in his favour. Campbell was, however, defeated by Sir John Owen of Orielton. 

He was MP for Carmarthen from 1813 to 1821 and Lord Lieutenant of Carmarthenshire from 1817 to 1860. He died on his family estate at Stackpole, Pembrokeshire.
