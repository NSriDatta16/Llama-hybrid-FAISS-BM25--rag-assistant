Thurso railway station is a railway station located in Thurso, in the Highland council area in the far north of Scotland. It serves the town of Thurso and its surrounding areas in the historic county of Caithness. It is also the nearest station to the port of Scrabster (about  to the northwest), which has ferry services linking the mainland with Stromness on the Orkney Islands. It is the northernmost station on the National Rail network.

The station is situated at the end of a short branch line off the Far North Line. It is  down the line from  (the other end of the branch), and  from .

Thurso station is managed by ScotRail, which also operates all trains serving the station.

History
The station opened on 28 July 1874. A wrought-iron turntable,  in diameter, was built at the station by the Railway Steel and Plant Company of Manchester.

The station was threatened with closure in the 1960s under the Beeching Axe.

Until 2000, trains from  would split in half at , with one portion going to  and the other to Thurso. In the age of locomotive-hauled trains prior to the introduction of diesel multiple units by British Rail, a locomotive was based at Georgemas Junction to take the Thurso portion to and from the junction. The practice of splitting trains ended when s were introduced on the line  since then all services run in full between Inverness and Wick via Thurso, in both directions, meaning they call at Georgemas Junction twice.

Facilities
There is one platform, which is long enough to accommodate a nine-carriage train. The station is fully wheelchair-accessible, but it is not monitored by CCTV. The station has a ticket office, although there are no self-service ticket machines , except for some smartcard validators. Other facilities include: a small car park, a sheltered bike stand, a payphone, waiting rooms, toilets and a post box.

There is a bus stop located directly outside the station, although the majority of bus services call at the nearby Miller Academy stop,  to the north.

Despite being located at the end of the branch line, Thurso is not the terminus for any passenger services. On weekdays and Saturdays, the station is served by eight trains per day to , of which four continue to  (via , , ,  and ), and four continue to . On Sundays the frequency drops to just two trains per day to Georgemas Junction, of which one goes to Inverness and one to Wick.

An hourly shuttle between Wick and Thurso making use of Vivarail's Class 230 Battery Multiple Units was proposed by the Friends of the Far North line.
