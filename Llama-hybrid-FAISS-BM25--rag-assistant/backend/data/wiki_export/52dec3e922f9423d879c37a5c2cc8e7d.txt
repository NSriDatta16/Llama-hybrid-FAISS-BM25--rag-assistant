Fiskerton railway station, is on the Nottingham to Lincoln Line, situated  south-east of the small town of Southwell and serves the village of Fiskerton in Nottinghamshire, England.

History
The station opened on 4 August 1846 by the Midland Railway. It was taken over by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923, and by British Rail in 1948.

A signal box was installed at the station in 1902. This Midland Railway Type 3a box was downgraded to a gate box from 2 December 1934. 

A new junction was laid between Fiskerton and the Rolleston Junction to Southwell line in 1929 to allow mineral trains from Mansfield and district to access Nottingham without reversing at Rolleston Junction. At the same time a new signal box was built to a Midland Railway Type 3c design with a 30 lever frame and gate wheel to operate the level crossing barriers. The curve closed on 1 March 1965 and the railway junction was abolished.

It is managed by the East Midlands Railway, which provides services to the station.

Signalling on the line was upgraded in 2016 when the manual signal boxes were decommissioned and control transferred to the East Midlands Integrated Electronic Control Centre at Derby.

In 2017, Network Rail announced that the platforms would be extended to cater for longer trains.

In 2020 Network Rail announced a plan to relocate the signal box to the Vale of Berkley Railway in Gloucestershire.
