Paul B. Thompson (born 1958) is a freelance writer and novelist. He has published twenty-nine books to date, many of which are novels set in the Dragonlance fictional universe. A number of these novels are co-authored with Tonya C. Cook.

Career
Paul grew up in North Carolina, and was influenced by Greek mythology, The Arabian Nights, and writers such as L. Sprague de Camp, Alfred Bester, and Cordwainer Smith.

He graduated from the University of North Carolina in 1980 with a degree in history. While at UNC he met Tonya Cook through the student science fiction club, Chimera. He received his master's degree in 1983. In the period 1980-84 he wrote magazine articles and historical novels. When he found no market for historical novels he turned to fantasy and science fiction. He also began collaborating with Tonya Cook at that time.

From 1990 to 1994 he published Forbidden Lines, a semi-pro magazine of science fiction, horror, and speculative fiction.

Paul lives in Chapel Hill, North Carolina with his wife Elizabeth.
