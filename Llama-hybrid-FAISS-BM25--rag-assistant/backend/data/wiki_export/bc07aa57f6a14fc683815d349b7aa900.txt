William Desmond (died 5 September 1941) was an Irish Cumann na nGaedheal and later Fine Gael politician. A hotel proprietor, he was first elected to Dáil Éireann at the 1932 general election as a Cumann na nGaedheal Teachta Dála (TD) for the Cork Borough constituency, where his party colleague W. T. Cosgrave (the President of the Executive Council) topped the poll.

He was re-elected at the 1933 election, but lost his seat at the 1937 general election, when the constituency was reduced from 5 seats to 4. He then retired from politics.

Desmond was Lord Mayor of Cork from 1940 to 1941.
