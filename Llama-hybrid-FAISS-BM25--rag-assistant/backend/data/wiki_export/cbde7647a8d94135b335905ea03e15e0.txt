The La Jolla Handicap is a Grade III American Thoroughbred horse race for three-year-olds over a distance of one and one-sixteenth miles on the turf scheduled annually in August at Del Mar Racetrack in Del Mar, California. The event currently carries a purse of $150,000.

History
The event is named for the city of La Jolla, California, which is not far from Del Mar.

The event was inaugurated on July 11, 1937, as an event for three-year-olds and older and was won by the five-year-old mare Topsy Omar by the shortest of margins defeating the favorite Grey Count in a time of 1:45. The event was not run in 1939 but moved to early February 1940 to Santa Anita as a seven furlong event for four-year-olds and older on the turf. The champion Seabiscuit resumed in this event after a long layoff carrying 128 pounds after injury and was placed third to Heelfly. Later in the year the event was run at Del Mar at the set distance of one mile.

The event was idle during 1942–1944 due to World War II, resuming in 1945 as a three-year-olds and older California bred handicap.

In 1950 the event's conditions were set for three-year-olds at the distance.

In 1973 the event was classified as Grade III and in 1975 was moved to the turf track and has been run since then on that surface. In 1987 the event's distance was extended from one mile to  miles.  From 2004 to 2013 the event was run as a Grade II.

The event's position in the racing calendar at Del Mar has led to the race being a preparatory race for the Del Mar Derby which is scheduled usually several weeks later.

The event has been split into division four times, the last being in 1982.

Two fillies or mares have won this event. The inaugural running in 1937 and Henpecker in 1948 when the event was restricted to three-year-old fillies.
