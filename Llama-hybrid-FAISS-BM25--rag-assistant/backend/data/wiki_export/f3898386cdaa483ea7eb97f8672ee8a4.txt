Tomaz Salom達o (born 16 October 1954) is a Mozambican politician and economist. He was Minister of Economy and Finance from 1994 to 2000. 
He served as the third Executive Secretary of the Southern African Development Community (SADC). Salom達o was appointed at the 2005 Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Southern African Development Community in Gaborone, Botswana. He earned his doctorate at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, United States.

Opponents of President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe have criticized Salom達o for his assessment of Zimbabwean elections as free and fair. Salom達o said that SADC would pull out an EU summit to be held in Lisbon in December 2007 if Zimbabwe was on the agenda. "SADC will not go to Lisbon to discuss Zimbabwe because the summit is not about Zimbabwe, but about relations between the EU and Africa," he said.
