Kill the Musicians is a compilation album released in 1995 which was meant to serve as a "cleaning up" of loose ends after Screeching Weasel's breakup in 1994.  The compilation collects demos, B-sides, vinyl-only EPs, and other various odds and ends the band had accumulated in their career from 1989 to 1994.  It came on the heels of 1994's How to Make Enemies and Irritate People, which itself was a collection of the final songs the band had written prior to splitting up.  The band would soon reform in 1996 and remain together again until 2000, when they disbanded again.  This collection was out of print for a short period until it was remastered and re-released by Asian Man Records in 2005. The original album contained an in-depth essay written by Ben Weasel covering the history of the band. This was later omitted from the re-issue. In 2010, Recess Records had intentions to release a double LP vinyl reissue, however production was aborted and only a small amount of test pressings exist.
