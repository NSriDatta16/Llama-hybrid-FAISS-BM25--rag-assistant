Black Cadillac is Rosanne Cash's eleventh studio album, released on January 23, 2006. The album is dedicated to Cash's mother, Vivian Liberto, and father, Johnny Cash, both of whom died at the age of 71, hence the 71-second silent track at the end. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk album in 2007. This was Cash's last album for Capitol Records, a label Cash worked from 1996 to 2007. After that album's release, Cash left Capitol.
