The Battlefords North Stars are a Junior "A" ice hockey team based in North Battleford, Saskatchewan, Canada, that plays in the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League.  The team was founded in 1973 as the Battlefords Barons and has been known as the North Stars since 1983. They have won four SJHL Championships, most recently in 2023.

History 
The team was founded in 1973 when the team's first board of directors, led by Art Streuby, created a franchise to join the SJHL named the Battlefords Barons.

In the team's first season, they posted an abysmal record of 10-40-0, improving to 31-26-1 the following year.

In 1983-84 the team's name was changed to the North Battleford North Stars, adopting a logo similar to their namesake, the Minnesota North Stars in the National Hockey League.

In the 1990s a new logo taking heavy inspiration from the first Dallas Stars logo would be brought into use, and remains the team's logo today, along with the black and silver colour scheme. The team's name was also shortened to "Battlefords North Stars".

The team celebrated its 50th anniversary in June 2023.
