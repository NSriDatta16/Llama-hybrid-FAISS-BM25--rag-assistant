The 2002 ICC Champions Trophy was a cricket tournament held in Sri Lanka in 2002. It marked the third edition of the ICC Champions Trophy, with the previous two tournaments being known as the ICC Knock Out Tournaments. Originally scheduled to be held in India, the tournament was moved to Sri Lanka when India did not grant an exemption from tax, as needed. The tournament consisted of fifteen matches, including two semi-finals and a final match. This event was notable as it marked the first time that teams from all member nations of the International Cricket Council (ICC) visited Sri Lanka to participate in a cricket tournament.

Twelve teams participated in the tournament: the ten Test-playing nations, along with Kenya, who held full One Day International (ODI) status, and the Netherlands, who were the winners of the 2001 ICC Trophy. The teams were divided into four pools, each consisting of three teams. In the pool stage, each team played the other two teams in its pool once. The top team from each pool advanced to the semi-finals. 

In the first semi-final, Australia was defeated by Sri Lanka, while India emerged victorious over South Africa in the second semi-final. However, the final match between India and Sri Lanka was affected by rain and had to be abandoned on two occasions, resulting in no result being declared. 

Virender Sehwag emerged as the highest run-scorer of the tournament, while Muttiah Muralitharan claimed the title of highest wicket-taker.

Prize money
The total prize money for the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy was $1 million, and in addition, the 12 teams received $165,000 each for taking part in the tournament. The winning team of the tournament collected $525,000: $100,000 for winning both of its Pool matches, $125,000 for winning semi-final and $300,000 for winning the final.

Venues 
All the matches were played in Colombo at two grounds: R. Premadasa Stadium and Sinhalese Sports Club Ground.

Tournament structure
Unlike the previous two editions of the Champions Trophy which had a direct knockout format, this edition had a format in which teams were divided into pools instead and the first-placed teams of the respective pools at the end of pool stage would qualify to the knockout stage. The 12 teams—10 Test playing nations (plus Kenya and Netherlands)—were divided into four pools of three teams each, with every team playing two matches. Australia, Bangladesh and New Zealand were placed in Pool 1 whereas England, India and Zimbabwe were allotted Pool 2. Kenya, South Africa and West Indies were put together in Pool 3, and Netherlands, Pakistan and Sri Lanka played each other in Pool 4. The semi finals were played between the winners of Pool 2 and the winners of Pool 3, and Pool 1 and Pool 4.

Final

The 2002 ICC Champions Trophy Final was played on 29 and 30 September 2002 at the R. Premadasa Stadium, Colombo. On 29 September, Sri Lanka scored 244 runs including Jayasuriya and Kumar Sangakkara scoring fifties, and Indian off-spinner Harbhajan Singh took three wickets for 27 in 10 overs. In reply, India started their batting and scored 14 runs without any loss in two overs before the match was abandoned due to heavy rain; the match was finished in no result. It was decided that the new match would be played on the reserve day.

On the reserve day the Sri Lankans again batted first, scoring 222 runs including Mahela Jayawardene and Russel Arnold scoring 77 and 56 runs respectively, and Indian Zaheer Khan took three wickets for 44 runs. India scored 38 runs in 8.4 overs and the match was abandoned due to rain without result. According to ICC rules, an ODI match is only official after 25 overs bowled to the side batting second. A Man of the Series award was not made.

Criticism
The International Cricket Council's (ICC) rule for One Day International (ODI) cricket at that time, "a minimum of 25 overs have to be bowled to the side batting second to constitute a match", was criticized by former Indian cricketers. Former Indian wicket-keeper Farokh Engineer rejected the rule saying that it "doesn't make any sense". Another former Test cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar said that the ICC "should look at that rule straight away and change it", and the "obvious thing is to continue from where they left off".

Tournament statistics
Indian opener Virender Sehwag was the highest run-scorer of the tournament. He scored 271 runs from four innings at the average of over 90, including a century and a fifty. His highest score was 126 runs against England. Followed by Sri Lankan captain Sanath Jayasuriya who scored 254 runs. Herschelle Gibbs of South Africa scored two centuries in the tournament. He also had the highest average of 120 from three innings. Zimbabwean Andy Flower's score of 145 against India was the highest individual score in a match.

Sri Lankan off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan was the most successful bowler of the tournament. He took ten wickets in three innings, while his best bowling figures were four wickets for 15 runs against the Netherlands at the R. Premadasa Stadium. The only five-wicket haul of the tournament was taken by Australian fast bowler Glenn McGrath. He took five wickets for 37 runs against New Zealand at the Sinhalese Sports Club Ground.
