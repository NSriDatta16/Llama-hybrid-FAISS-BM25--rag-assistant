The Secret Society of Super Villains is a team of fictional supervillains appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Over the years, they have featured a large number of ne'er-do-wells as they attempt to subvert the superheroic population of the world for a variety of schemes.

This page lists the known members of the Secret Society of Super Villains:

Darkseid's Society
These members of the Secret Society of Super Villains were secretly gathered by Darkseid when the group was first founded in 1976 through their splintering after the discovery of their benefactor's true identity. Since then, various leaders like Lex Luthor, the Wizard and the Silver Ghost have taken over or re-formed the Society, including old and new members in the roster.

In JLA #119 (late Nov. 2005), it was revealed that Catwoman was an early member of the SSoSV briefly as well (Catwoman was mentioned in the text of Secret Society of Super Villains #1 as being a member, though the penciller omitted her from the issue; this brief mention is the only known connection of Catwoman to the SSoSV prior to the present). Also, Despero brought the memories of the members back, and was responsible of the subsequent attack of the Society.

The Ultra-Humanite's Society
The next incarnation of the Secret Society was organized by the Ultra-Humanite, who organized foes of both the Justice League of America and the Justice Society of America.

 Ultra-Humanite 
 Brain Wave 
 Monocle 
 Psycho-Pirate (Roger Hayden)
 Rag Doll (Peter Merkel) 
 Cheetah (Deborah Domaine)
 Floronic Man
 Killer Frost (Crystal Frost)
 Mist 
 Signalman

Underground
When the JLA resurfaced with the Big Seven members, Brain Wave started to gather a new Secret Society to take down the newly formed Justice League (JLA 80-Page Giant #1), but Brainwave was actually the Martian Manhunter in disguise—the formation of this Society was a trap made by the League to defeat more supervillains in the same time (as the tale was told by the Rainbow Raider to Sonar III, it is uncertain whether this tale actually happened; at the very least, there may have been some embellishment).

Members gathered by "Brainwave" were:

 Amos Fortune 
 Black Hand 
 Blockbuster (Roland Desmond)
 Bolt
 Captain Boomerang (Digger Harkness)
 Cheetah (Barbara Ann Minerva)
 Cheshire
 Crazy Quilt
 Deadshot
 Doctor Alchemy
 Doctor Phosphorus
 Doctor Sivana
 Fiddler

 Killer Frost (Louise Lincoln)
 Major Disaster
 Monocle

Members in other branches that are on TV screens:

 Mister Mind
 Rainbow Raider
 Ra's al Ghul
 Two-Face
 Vandal Savage

Alexander Luthor Jr.'s Society
Organized by Alexander Luthor Jr. in the guise of Lex Luthor, the Society formed over rumors of the JLA mindwiping Dr. Light. With a ruling council of six members overseeing a structured roster of 200 strong (Villains United #1), the Society is a grave threat to the superheroes of the world. Joker is notably absent from this roster, because he is the only villain the other villains all feared — and rightly so, as the Joker murdered several of the Society's roster in revenge for being left out.

 Lex Luthor (Alexander Luthor Jr. in disguise, leader)
 Black Adam (betrayed by the Society)
 Talia al Ghul
 Doctor Psycho
 the Calculator

 In the novelization, Doctor Spectro is a member as well of the Society and dies in the same explosion that killed Solomon Grundy and the Bloodlines heroes.
 In an interview with DC editor-in-chief Dan DiDio, he confirms that Boss Moxie did indeed die in Infinite Crisis #7 by stating that Superboy-Prime snapped his neck.

The Wizard's Society
Some former members of the Wizard's Secret Society, also victims of the JLA's mindwiping in the past, had their memories unlocked by Despero and then were summoned back together for revenge by the Wizard. Zatanna reluctantly re-erased their memories of the JLA's identities. Whether they were members of Alexander Luthor Jr.'s Society as well is unknown.

In addition to the Wizard, Felix Faust and Chronos, the membership included:

 Floronic Man
 Star Sapphire (Deborah Camille "Debbie" Darnell)
 Matter Master
