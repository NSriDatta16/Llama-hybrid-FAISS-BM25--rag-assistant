Bocanada (Puff) is the second solo album by Argentine rock musician Gustavo Cerati, released by BMG International on 28 June 1999. The album, an eclectic mix of neo-psychedelia and trip hop with a variety of styles, is considered by critics and fans as a highlight in Cerati's career and one of his best albums. His first album release after the breakup of Soda Stereo, Bocanada followed Cerati's time with the groups Plan V and Ocio, two bands oriented towards electronic music. "Raíz" was the album's first cut played in radio stations, "Puente" being the first music video to be released; Bocanada had the most music videos produced of any Cerati album to date.
