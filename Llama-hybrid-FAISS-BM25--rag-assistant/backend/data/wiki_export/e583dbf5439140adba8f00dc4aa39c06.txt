History

Mentioned in the Domesday Book Survey of 1086, Breaston was a settlement in the Hundred of Morleystone wapentake and the county of Derbyshire. It had an estimated population of 15.8 households in 1086. At the time it was mentioned as belonging to Henry de Ferrers (Henry was given a large number of manors in Derbyshire including land in Swarkestone, Markeaton, Sinfin and Cowley) and being worth four shillings. The village Church of St Michael is a Grade I listed building. Structural parts of the interior, for example "double-chamfered pointed arches on octagonal piers" appear to be of 11th century in origin. The village of Breaston is clearly visible on the 1648 map of Derbyshire, produced (in Latin) by the Dutch cartographer Joan Blaeu, written as "Braston".

Breaston today is mainly residential. There is the church (St Michael), a primary school, a Methodist chapel, three pubs (three of them still named as they were in 1846 - The Bulls Head, Chequers Inn and The Navigation Inn); a medical centre and a comprehensive range of shops, including a Co-op, located in the centre of the village around the church and the village green. The green (known as Duffield Close) is said to be one of the largest in the country   and an annual May Day Fete is held there.

The first Long Eaton railway station was on Sawley Lane, Breaston.  First used in 1839, when the line opened, it was the third station on the line west from Nottingham.  It was originally called Breaston, but the name was changed to Sawley railway station to avoid confusion with nearby Beeston.
