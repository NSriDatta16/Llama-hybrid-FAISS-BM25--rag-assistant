Maritime collision
About 0134 on 20 June 1985 the Australian registered bulk carrier River Boyne of 51,994 gross tons, on passage from Weipa to Gladstone with a cargo of bauxite, collided with the Australian registered fishing vessel Babirusa, on passage from Cairns to the Gulf of Carpentaria, in approximate position 1 4 ' 18'S, 114° 39'E. There was no injury to any person and the only damage sustained was to the starboard outrigger boom and the sternlight on the Babirusa.

Having established that the Babirusa required no assistance, the River Boyne continued its voyage to Gladstone. The Babirusa returned to Cairns for repairs.
