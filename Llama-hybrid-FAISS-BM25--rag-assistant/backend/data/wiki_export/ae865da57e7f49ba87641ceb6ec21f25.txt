Give Me a Wall was the debut album from ¡Forward, Russia!, and was released in the UK on 15 May 2006 and in the US on 19 December 2006. Tracks on the album include previous singles "Twelve", "Nine" and "Thirteen". The album was released through the band's own label, "dance to the radio". When asked why the album was self-produced, guitarist Whiskas proclaimed, "We're sick of waiting around for labels to sort themselves out, so we're doing it ourselves." Following the previous releases tradition, all the tracks are named after the order they were written.
