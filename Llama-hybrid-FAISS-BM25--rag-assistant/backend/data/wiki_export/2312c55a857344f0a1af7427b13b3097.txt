.gc.ca is a privately held second-level domain in the .ca top-level domain. It is used by the Government of Canada and operated by Government Telecommunications and Informatics Services, which holds all third level domains under the .gc.ca banner.

In 2012, the government of Canada had launched a plan to move all federal government sites to a single domain, "canada.ca". However, much of the plan was abandoned in 2017, with only a handful of departments and agencies such as the Canada Revenue Agency relocating; most government sites will remain under their own domains for the foreseeable future.

In addition to many official government websites, a process has been implemented where many of the Canadian diplomatic mission locations also have gc.ca domains as well.  (i.e. the Canadian High Commission in Barbados has a forwarding service from "barbados.gc.ca", or similarly the Consulate-General in Boston as "boston.gc.ca".)
