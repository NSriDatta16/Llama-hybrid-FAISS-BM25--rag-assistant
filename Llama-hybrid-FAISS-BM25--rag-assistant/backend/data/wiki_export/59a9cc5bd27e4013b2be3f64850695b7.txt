History 
Addison Trail High School opened on 1 September 1966. Before the opening of Addison Trail, there were two other high schools within District 88 – York High School in Elmhurst and Willowbrook High School in Villa Park. Due to the rapid growth within District 88, Addison Trail was approved for construction, making it the third in the district.

Since the opening of Addison Trail, there have been significant changes to the school. In 1976, construction of a new addition was approved because of a growing student population. In 2008, construction began on new renovations, which included a new 3-story classroom addition, student commons area and field house. The renovations and additions were completed in 2010. In 2010, Village of Addison purchased what was once Driscoll High School with the primary intention of using it as Addison Trail's athletic fields. The acquired land was named Blazer Park. The school has 120 classrooms and its still going on. The basement has an auto tech classroom, including a woodshop, a photography classroom plus driver eds room, a credit recovery room and an BRC (behavioral resource center) and a fitness gym. Plus there is a couple of classrooms used for sports and education classes.
