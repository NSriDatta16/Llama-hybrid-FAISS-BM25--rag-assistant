The Attractive Young Rabbi was a BBC Radio 4 comedy series of three series from 1999 to 2002, written by Barry Grossman. Starring Tracy-Ann Oberman, David de Keyser and Doreen Mantle, the series was about two rabbis in "Hillfield", in north west London. Oberman is Reform Rabbi Su Jacobs, the attractive young rabbi of the title, who clashes with de Keyser's Orthodox and very traditional Rabbi Abraham Fine, with Doreen Mantle as the latter's wife, Sadie, trying to keep the peace between them, and Henry Goodman and Jonathan Kydd as Melvin Livingstone and Brian Franks, chairmen of their respective synagogue councils.

The theme tune was written by Max Harris in klezmer style. The series has been frequently repeated on BBC 7, later BBC Radio 4 Extra, where it is described as a 'gentle comedy'.
