The sexual contacts started when the girl was 17 and Mervil was 29, and continued after she turned 18. Despite age of consent in Canada being 14 years old at the time, the conviction stems from the fact Mervil was "in a position of authority" when the sexual contacts started while the girl was a minor. The judge, accepting the joint recommendation of the prosecution and defense, sentenced Mervil to 6 months to be served in the community, the first three of which under house arrest.
