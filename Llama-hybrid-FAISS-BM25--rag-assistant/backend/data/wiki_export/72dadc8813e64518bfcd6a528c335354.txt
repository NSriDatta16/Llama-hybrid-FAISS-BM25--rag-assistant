The Yacoubian Building (, ) is a mixed-use building in Downtown Cairo, Egypt, built in 1937. Located on No. 34 on Talaat Harb Street, Cairo, the Art Deco style edifice was named after its Lebanese-Armenian owner and businessman Hagop Yacoubian. The architect of the building was Garo Balian.

The building served as a residence for Cairo's upper-class during the Kingdom of Egypt, home to cotton millionaires, members of the royal family, and foreign nationals. During and after the 1952 revolution the building was used as a domicile for Egyptian military officers and their wives. By the 1970s the building was transferred to mixed use, including shopfronts and offices. 

A fictionalised version of the building serves as a metaphor for Cairo's own deterioration in the 2003 Arabic language novel  The Yacoubian Building by Alaa Al Aswany. The novel was adapted into a 2006 film of the same name, directed by Marwan Hamed. A larger building, located on Talaat Harb Square was used for the exteriors.

The Yacoubian Building in Beirut, Lebanon belonged to the same family.
