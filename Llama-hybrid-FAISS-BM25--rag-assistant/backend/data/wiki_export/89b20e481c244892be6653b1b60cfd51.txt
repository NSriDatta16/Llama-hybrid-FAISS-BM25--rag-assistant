The Faculty of Medicine (French: Faculté de médecine) at the University of Ottawa is a bilingual medical school in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada founded in 1945. It is located at a campus centred on Roger-Guindon Hall in the east end of Ottawa and is attached to the Ottawa Hospital's General Campus. The Health Sciences Complex is separate from the downtown University of Ottawa campus.

Undergraduate program

The current undergraduate MD program at the University of Ottawa is a 4-year program accepting about 160 students per year; 44 in the French stream and 116 in the English stream.  All courses are offered in both languages and students can attend any course they choose.  Exams are written in either language.  
The undergraduate MD curriculum has recently undergone major changes.  The first year for the new curriculum was the 2008-2009 school year.  Major changes include a more global teaching system with 1 cumulative exam per semester, the restrictions of classes to the hours between 8 am and noon to allow students to complete more elective experiences as well as the institution of Self-Learning Modules (SLM) which the student complete on their own time outside of class.

The undergraduate medical society is known as the Aesculapian Society.

In 2015-16, the medical program introduced the CASPer test, developed by McMaster University Medical School, as part of their admissions process.
