The majority of songs featured on the DVD are from Tyler's 2005 album Wings, which had been released during the tour.

A CD version of Bonnie on Tour titled Bonnie Tyler Live was released by Stick Music on 9 July 2006.

Background 
Tyler embarked on a European tour to support the release of her fifteenth studio album Wings in 2005. The album was recorded and produced at the Pasteur Studio in Paris, France and many of the session musicians joined Tyler for a series of concerts. The first half of the DVD includes footage from Tyler's concert to celebrate her 54th birthday on 8 June 2005 at La Cigale in Paris. Additional concert footage includes her appearance at the Sopot International Song Festival in Poland in September 2005, and a free open air concert at the Fiestas del Pilar in Zaragoza, Spain on 10 October 2005.

Bonus features include the music video for her 2005 single "Louise" and behind-the-scenes footage on location in Bizerte, Tunisia.

Critical reception 
Tomas Mureika of AllMusic gave the accompanying live CD a positive review, stating that "Tyler is -- at heart -- an amazing live performer and this is a great chronicle of her abilities." His only criticism was that the majority of songs performed were her most recent work, stating that he would have preferred more of "the masterpieces Tyler created with Jim Steinman."
