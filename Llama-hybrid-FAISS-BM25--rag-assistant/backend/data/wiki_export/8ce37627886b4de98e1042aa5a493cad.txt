The National Hindu Students' Forum (NHSF (UK)) is a network of Hindu societies operating on university and further education campuses in the United Kingdom. The NHSF (UK) was started in 1991 from a stall at a Hindu marathon, but now operates in around 50 different institutions around the United Kingdom. The NHSF has been described by historian Edward Anderson as having ties to the Sangh Parivar, a group of Hindu nationalist organisations in India such as the RSS and the BJP. In early years the NHSF had the same address as the HSS, a UK charity, per Manoj Ladwa, the then HSS spokesman. Ladwa later served as a senior advisor to Narendra Modi during his successful Indian election campaign of 2014.  Although the HSS is considered to be inspired by the RSS, a UK charity commission inquiry in 2016 found no formal links between the two.
