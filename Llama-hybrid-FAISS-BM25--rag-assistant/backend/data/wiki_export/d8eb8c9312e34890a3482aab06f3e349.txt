Listed in order of appearance:

 Eddie Cook (Richard Moir - episodes 1-16), an original character, electrician Eddie was contracted to do repair work at the prison. At Wentworth, he enjoys the company of inmate Marilyn Mason and so finds reasons to prolong his work, with the pair stowing away for a number of romantic liaisons - notably up in the rec room roof during the riot of episodes 3-4 in which Meg Jackson's husband Bill is killed. When Marilyn is released, the pair move in together, but Marilyn is hard up for money and finding it hard to get work, so reluctantly turns back to prostitution (albeit to afford to buy Eddie a gift for his birthday), leaving Marilyn back inside and putting a severe strain on their relationship. With Marilyn released a second time, Bea Smith eventually sets them straight, arranging for them to run Monica Ferguson's milk bar, which we later hear of them buying permanently.
 Judith-Anne Watkins (Kim Deacon - episodes 5-67), Mum's granddaughter, and the only member of her family to take any interest in her. Visits her in Wentworth to reveal she is pregnant, and shortly afterwards moves into a flat with Mum after her release. When Bea seeks refuge with them when she is on the run, she uses all of Mum's savings to buy a disguise for Bea, just to get rid of her.

They move in with Doug's friend Bernie and get married, but Bernie involves them both in a payroll snatch, and Doug is caught and gets shot by a police officer and later  dies in hospital, hence Lynn is recaptured.
 Detective Inspector Jack Grace (Terry Gill - episodes 8-635), a cynical and overbearing Detective Inspector who becomes the main representative of the police force in the series.
 Ethel Warner (Beverly Dunn - episodes 10-11), Lynn's mother, who seems more concerned with her social standing in the local community than her daughter's problems.
 Steve Wilson (James Smillie - episodes 15-42), a slick, dashing solicitor who represents a number of the women during the mid-first year of the series. His main case is that of Karen Travers, and with her permitted day release to study at University, the pair start to become romantically involved, although it does not extend much beyond holding hands. However, with his position at the struggling law practice jeopardised (mostly due to all of the unpaying cases he is taking at Wentworth), when an old flame suddenly reappears and offers to go into business him, and believing Karen not to be interested in him, he leaves for the new venture, and is not heard from again in the series.
 Jason Richards (David Bradshaw - episodes 27-29), Pop star who is alleged to be the lover of Susan Rice's husband Frederick. In fact, they are the same person, and this is her way of expressing her feelings about him deserting her for his career. Susan throws acid in his face during a live TV show, but he has also been seen in flashback.

 Leila Fletcher (Penny Ramsey - episodes 42-109), Jim Fletcher's estranged wife, who first appears leaning out of a window telling a drunken Jim to shut up or he'll wake the kids. In her early episodes, she seems cast as the stereotyped bitter ambitious wife. She becomes a little more sympathetic after she shows her dislike for Jim's mate, Geoff Butler when Jim invites him to dinner. She is introduced again when she throws Jim out of the house after she is told about his relationship with Caroline Simpson. Eventually dies with her children in a bomb blast intended to kill Jim, unknowingly planted by Caroline's husband, Michael, orchestrated by Geoff.
 Peter Clements (Carrillo Gantner - episodes 44-52), a sleazy and manipulative psychology lecturer, who teaches at the University that Karen attends, and who is granted permission to conduct research into prison life at Wentworth, but who is covertly studying the officers rather more than the prisoners. His case study of Doreen causes her to have a breakdown, and he is also duped by Bea into giving information over mysterious new prisoner, Bella Albrecht. His findings over the running of the prison and its staff causes the Department embarrassment, but the storyline seems to fade away without much impact.
 Angela Jeffries (Jeanie Drynan - episodes 59-114), a lesbian lawyer involved with the Prison Reform Group and in the plan to set up a halfway house. She offers Karen accommodation and a job, so Karen moves in with her for a while. Angela has to warn Karen off from falling in love with her.

She continues to be mentioned for some time after her last appearance, for instance in 114 in connection with Doreen's mother's will.
 Ted Douglas (Ian Smith - episodes 61-382), the pompous, generally disliked representative of the Department Of Corrective Services, forever visiting Wentworth to demand that governor Erica Davidson increase security.

 David O'Connell  (David Letch - episodes 69-79), Son of Pat O'Connell, first mentioned by name in 68, when we find that he is in Pentridge with his father. The scriptwriters stretch co-incidence to its limits by getting him to Wentworth in the next episode in a prison work party so that Pat can talk to him and tell him why she's divorcing his father. When Pat gets paroled just before Christmas, she visits him in Pentridge and sees him get punched by one of the guards. Shortly after this, David escapes and seeks shelter with his friend Shayne. When he goes to see his mother, the police are already on their way, and there is a shootout in which David kills a policeman. As a result his mother is sent back to Wentworth, and David becomes convinced that Greg Miller tipped off the police. With his friend Herbie, he plans to kill Greg, but shoots Karen instead. Herbie becomes worried about him and leads the police to their hideout, where David is recaptured and is not seen again. In episode 80 Angela Jeffries tells Pat that David will plead insanity and as a result will probably spend the rest of his life in an institution. After his preliminary hearing goes badly, Erica tells Pat that David has hung himself in his cell.

Geoff also tries to get Jim interested in joining him in becoming part of a mercenary army overseas. When Jim and Geoff are out for a drink one evening, a homosexual man is found badly beaten in the toilets soon after. Following the previous incident, Leila is convinced Geoff is behind it, but Jim refuses to listen. By the time Leila finally convinces Jim to contact the Police about him, Geoff is in the middle of attacking Meg in her apartment after Leila's warnings turned her away from him. Jim arrives just in time to save Meg, and the Police take Geoff away. However, the character returns in 106 to face trial and escapes charge. Embittered at his friend Jim turning him in, Geoff joins forces with Caroline Simpson's estranged husband Michael, who is jaded at Jim seeing his ex-wife. The pair plot to get even with Jim; Michael does not want anyone seriously hurt, but Geoff tricks him into delivering a bomb to Jim's hotel room intended to kill him. Instead, the bomb kills Leila and the children. Geoff makes one final attempt at the devastated Jim back at home, until a Police marksman shoots him.

He becomes curious about her secret background (she is living at the Halfway House at the time), and after he finds out her true identity he sticks with her, willing to accept her for whatever she is. He soon proposes to her and they plan to marry, much to the disdain of his rather snobbish mother. However, a drunken incident sees Doreen, and Lizzie, breaking parole and sent back to Wentworth, but Kevin tells Doreen that he is willing to wait for her. When a tussle breaks out over Doreen's late mother's house, which crooked land developers want to buy up cheap, the pair decide to marry on Wentworth grounds. A while later, Doreen is included as part of the prison's work project with a local textile company, where worker Vince Talbot rapes Doreen. She soon discovers that she is pregnant as a result; Doreen considers not letting on and claiming the child to be Kevin's, but when, unaware of her condition, he says that he is not ready to start a family yet, Doreen plans an abortion, before breaking down and admitting that she was raped by Talbot. The Police do not have enough evidence to charge Talbot, and Doreen admits to Kevin that on a second occasion, she allowed Talbot, in hope of gaining the information needed for Kevin to win a lucrative work contract at the factory. This confession puts a strain on the pair's marriage and Kevin decides he wants a divorce.
