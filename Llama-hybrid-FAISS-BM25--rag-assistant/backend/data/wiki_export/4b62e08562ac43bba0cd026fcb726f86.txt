Career

Chris Makos was born in 1948 in Lowell, Massachusetts, but grew up in California before moving to Paris.

In 1976, he worked as an apprentice with Man Ray in Fregenae, Italy. He met Andy Warhol in 1977, and became more visible in the Warhol social circle around 1979 and 1980. During that time Makos worked a photo assistant for Warhol and was involved with the publication of the 1979 art photo book, "Andy Warhol's Exposures". His book, Warhol: A Photographic Memoir (1989, New American Library), chronicled his friendship and extensive travels with Warhol in photos.

Since the early 1970s, Makos has worked at developing a style of boldly graphic photojournalism. His photographs have been the subject of numerous exhibitions both in galleries and museums throughout the United States, Europe and Japan and have appeared in countless magazines and newspapers worldwide. He has been a seminal figure in the contemporary art scene in New York. He is responsible for introducing the work of Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring to Andy Warhol.

Makos' photographs have been published in Interview, Rolling Stone, House & Garden, Connoisseur, New York Magazine, Esquire, Genre and People, among others. His portrait of Warhol wrapped in a flag was featured on the front cover of the Spring 1990 issue of the Smithsonian Studies, the academic journal of the Smithsonian Institution. Makos' Icons portfolio is a collection of silkscreen portraits of Andy Warhol, Elizabeth Taylor, Salvador Dalí, John Lennon, and Mick Jagger.
