Kilcullen is an Intermediate Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) club in Kilcullen, County Kildare, Ireland, which played a leading role in developing the games in the county.

History
Kilcullen town sports predate the GAA. The club was founded in 1889, and at first wore green and gold. They changed to black and white to honour the New Zealand national rugby union team ("All Blacks"), who played in Dublin in 1905. Their nickname, "The Rags", comes from a friendly game against Isles of the Sea where the Dubliners insulted the Kilcullen team's shabby kit.

The club crest depicts the round tower of Old Kilcullen, with its distinctive uneven top.

Gaelic football
Kilcullen were beaten by Clane in the 1892 county final. They lost to Moorefield 0-2 to 2-11 in the 1962 final.

Ladies Gaelic football
Kilcullen Ladies won their first ever Championship at senior level on 3 September 2016. They defeated Celbridge in the final of the Junior B Championship with a final scoreline of 5-17 to 2-05.

And, to round off the success, the Senior side added the club's second ever Ladies Senior championship by defeating Na Fianna in the Ladies Junior A final.
