In set theory, the critical point of an elementary embedding of a transitive class into another transitive class is the smallest ordinal which is not mapped to itself.

Suppose that  is an elementary embedding where  and  are transitive classes and  is definable in  by a formula of set theory with parameters from .  Then  must take ordinals to ordinals and  must be strictly increasing.  Also .  If  for all  and , then  is said to be the critical point of .

If  is V, then  (the critical point of ) is always a measurable cardinal, i.e. an uncountable cardinal number κ such that there exists a -complete, non-principal ultrafilter over . Specifically, one may take the filter to be . Generally, there will be many other <κ-complete, non-principal ultrafilters over . However,  might be different from the ultrapower(s) arising from such filter(s).

If  and  are the same and  is the identity function on , then  is called "trivial".  If the transitive class  is an inner model of ZFC and  has no critical point, i.e. every ordinal maps to itself, then  is trivial.
