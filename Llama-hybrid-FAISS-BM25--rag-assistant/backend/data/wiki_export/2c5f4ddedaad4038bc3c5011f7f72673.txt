Santa Paula Airport  is a privately owned, public use airport located one nautical mile (2 km) southeast of the central business district of Santa Paula, a city in Ventura County, California, United States. It exclusively serves privately operated general aviation aircraft with no scheduled commercial service.

History 
Santa Paula's first airport was originally established in 1927 when local rancher Ralph Dickenson purchased an OX-5 powered International biplane, cut a dirt airstrip on his ranch, and built a hangar. Dickenson Airport soon advertised airplane rides and flight lessons available.

Less than five months later, the Santa Clara Valley flooded following the collapse of the St. Francis Dam, killing many people and destroying acres of property along the Santa Clara River, where the ranch was built. Dickenson's hangar was found half a mile downstream with his airplane still inside. He moved it back, made repairs, and began flying again within a month.

In the following year, two more hangars were built as more locals began flying and purchasing aircraft. Recognizing the importance of having a community airport in the area, Dickenson and Dan Emmet obtained $1,000 from 19 local ranchers and purchased land south of the city of Santa Paula, adjacent to the river.

In 1930, following months of personal construction and development by these founders, the newly named Santa Paula Airport opened to the public with a lavish celebration of aerobatics, celebrity appearances, and aircraft.

This airport was also one of the favorite flying spots of actor Steve McQueen.

2005 flood disaster 
On February 21 and 22, 2005, the Santa Paula Airport was heavily damaged when the rain-swollen Santa Clara River ate into the airport property, destroying airplane tiedowns, ramps, and approximately  part of the western one-third of the runway. The airport's only flight school, CP Aviation, temporarily moved to nearby Oxnard Airport as a result of the damage. Repairs began in March 2005 following the receding of the floodwaters, and as of February 2007, the airport was fully open to the public.

Thomas Fire 
In December 2017, the Thomas Fire erupted and burned across Ventura and Santa Barbara counties. The Santa Paula Airport became a helibase for CAL FIRE by the morning after the fire started. The airport was outfitted as a base of operations for the water-dropping helicopters, and closed to all of the regular general aviation operations. About 23 helicopters began operating out of the airport, along with the necessary support crews, tanker trucks, and other equipment. In addition to water, brightly colored fire retardant was dropped on the fire from the air. During the first couple of weeks, there had been limited ability to use fixed-wing air tankers and VLAT (very large air tankers) to drop fire retardant, due to the smoky skies. After having been in the air all day, the helicopters underwent maintenance at night. Other activities included a daily briefing each morning, lunches, and distributing maps.

Many aircraft and their operations moved to other airports, such as Camarillo, which remained open to normal activities, while being involved in firefighting efforts. Amid all this, the Santa Paula airport was able to make one of its hangars available for cats after one of the local animal shelters was filled to capacity, and for one local family with its dogs for three nights, on its premises as well.

Facilities and aircraft 
Santa Paula Airport covers an area of 51 acres (21 ha) at an elevation of 243 feet (74 m) above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 4/22 with an asphalt surface measuring 2,713×60 feet (827×18 m); it also one helipad designated H1 which is 60×60 feet (18×18 m).

The airport is a non-towered facility handling approximately 97,000 arrivals and/or departures a year, and is home to over 309 individual aircraft.  

For the 12-month period ending December 8, 2011, the airport had 97,000 general aviation aircraft operations, an average of 265 per day. At that time there were 309 aircraft based at this airport: 96% single-engine, 2% multi-engine, 1% helicopter, 1% glider, and 1% ultralight.

The airport is used for training flights by pilots around Southern and Central California, due to the unique operating environment, short field and challenging terrain. Much of the original 1930s-era facilities still exist and are used today, giving the airport a very authentic representation of the interwar years. As a result of the airport's history and theme, many vintage aircraft owners have long sought hangar space at the airport's limited facilities for use and display.

Tenants
CP Aviation offers flight school, aircraft rental, and aircraft maintenance activities. Fuel is also sold at the airport.

The Aviation Museum of Santa Paula is headquartered at the airport.

The former Logsdon's Restaurant closed in early 2013. In its place, Flight 126 Cafe opened in July 2014 serving breakfast and lunch from 6am to 2 pm, seven days a week.

Events
Every first Sunday of the month, the airport comes alive with visitors. People put their airplanes on display with info cards on the propeller. CP Aviation sells Santa Paula souvenirs. Also, car clubs come in and there are always nice cars to look at. The Petersen Auto Museum has displayed its Ferrari collection there.
