is a video game developed by NanaOn-Sha and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 2. It was created by Masaya Matsuura, who also created the 1999 PlayStation game Vib-Ribbon, of which Vib-Ripple is a sequel to. It was exclusively released in Japan in 2004.

Vib-Ripple is notable for allowing the player to import photographs to be used as the game's playing field.

Gameplay
The player takes control of Vibri, a simple, vector-shaped rabbit from the game's predecessor Vib-Ribbon. The game puts the player on top of various photographs, using each one as a trampoline. Jumping on a photograph loosens up 2D items called "Peta Characters", which Vibri must collect before a time limit expires. An icon on the left side of the screen gives the player a hint as to what part of the photograph to jump on to find the item; the icon's color, shape, and size corresponds to a certain combination of the three on the photograph. When Vibri is close enough to the item, a drumming sound is made and the controller vibrates. Vibri must also avoid creatures called "Boonchies" that inhabit the surface of the picture. Coming in contact with a Boonchie will cause Vibri to de-evolve from a rabbit, to a frog, to a worm, and eventually cause a Game over. However, it is possible for Vibri to evolve into a form called "Super Vibri", allowing the player to temporarily disable a Boonchie, as well as see hidden Peta Characters.

Vib-Ripple has 60 default photographs. The player can create their own stages by uploading their own photographs from a digital camera or cellphone via the PlayStation 2's USB port, or even send pictures across the system's online network. The game automatically scales photographs down to 256 by 256 pixels.
