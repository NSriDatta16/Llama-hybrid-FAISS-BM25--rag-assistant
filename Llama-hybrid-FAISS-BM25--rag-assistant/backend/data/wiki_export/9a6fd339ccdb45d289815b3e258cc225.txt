Love & Understanding is the seventh studio album by the funk band Kool & the Gang, released in 1976. The album had mild success. Three tracks, "Hollywood Swinging", "Summer Madness" and "Universal Sound" were recorded live at the Rainbow Theatre in London, England.

Record World said of the title track that "Kool's combination of chanting vocals, horns and electronics forms a patented style all his own."
