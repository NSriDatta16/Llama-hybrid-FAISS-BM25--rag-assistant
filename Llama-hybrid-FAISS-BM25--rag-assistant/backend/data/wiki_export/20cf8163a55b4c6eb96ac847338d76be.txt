The  Miss Wisconsin USA competition is the pageant that selects the representative for the state of Wisconsin in the Miss USA pageant.  Since 2007, the state pageant has been directed by Future Productions of Savage, Minnesota.

Wisconsin is one of the least successful states in the Miss USA system with only seven placements in over sixty years as the state has yet to win the Miss USA title. The most recent placement was Alexis Maria Loomans in 2023, placing 2nd runner-up that is the state highest placing since Mary Cook earning 2nd runner-up in 1974 as well, and they had no placements from 1979 until 2007, when Caitlin Morrall made the top fifteen. In 2005, Melissa Ann Young won the Miss Congeniality award. Elyzabeth Lee Pham won Miss Photogenic in 1999 and Kate Redeker at Miss USA 2016.
