Overview
Originally produced by Willie Revillame's WBR Entertainment Productions Inc., it served as a blocktimer on GMA Network. Randy Santiago originally served as the show's director. The show's theme song was composed by Lito Camo and arranged by Albert Tamayo. In late 2015, the show became a co-production between GMA Entertainment Group and WBR Entertainment Productions Inc. On February 1, 2016, the show joined the network's Telebabad line up.

In June 2017, co-host Super Tekla was fired from the show. On September 30, 2019, Sugar Mercado and comedian Donita Nose returned to the show.
The show's Saturday edition, Wowowin Primetime premiered on February 15, 2020, on the network's Sabado Star Power sa Gabi line up replacing Daddy's Gurl. Gab Valenciano, who was hired in January 2020 served as the director. In March 2020, the admission of a live audience in the studio and production were suspended due to the enhanced community quarantine in Luzon caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The show resumed its programming on April 13, 2020.

The show ended on GMA Network on February 11, 2022, as Revillame's contract with the network expired in the same month.

The show resumed through livestreaming on YouTube and Facebook on March 15, 2022. On July 15, 2022, it was announced that the show would return to television, this time on All TV, on September 13, after Revillame signed a contract with AMBS.
