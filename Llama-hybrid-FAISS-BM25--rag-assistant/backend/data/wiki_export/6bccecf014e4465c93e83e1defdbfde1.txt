In the 2001 Census it had a population of 72 people. It lies within the Antrim Coast and Glens Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and is part of Causeway Coast and Glens District Council.

The village is sited between a high ridge to the north, and the valley of the Carey River to the south with its distinctive terraces and wooded banks. The village, for its size, has a good range of commercial, social, educational and community facilities. After a long period of inactivity in  housing development, a medium-sized development has been undertaken at Blackpark Road.
