Falmouth Docks railway station () is situated in Falmouth, Cornwall, England. It was opened in 1863 as the terminus of the Maritime Line from , although since 1970  has been the principal station for the town. Services are operated by Great Western Railway, who also manage the station.

History
The original Cornwall Railway Act had provided for a terminus at Falmouth on the waterfront at Greenbank.  By the time the line was built the packet ships, which had been the commercial justification for the line, no longer called there.  Instead new docks had been constructed near Pendennis Castle to which the railway was diverted. The grand Falmouth Hotel was opened in 1865 just outside the station, with sea views across Gyllyngvase beach. The railway, Falmouth docks and hotel companies shared several directors, the hotel company even leased the refreshment rooms on the station.

The station was constructed out of granite was  long and  wide, the three tracks and two platforms being covered by a train shed. As no other stations were provided in the town at the time it was known just as 'Falmouth', and was opened on 24 August 1863. A large goods shed and a  long engine shed were both provided just outside the station. A siding ran down to the docks from the end of the platform. A camping coach was positioned here by the Western Region from 1962 to 1964.

The need to provide accommodation for all the staff were met by building twenty dwellings, known as Railway Cottages, in four terraces of five dwellings. These are situated just below the station by the entrance to the docks.

The Cornwall Railway was amalgamated into the Great Western Railway on 1 July 1889. The Great Western Railway was nationalised into British Railways from 1 January 1948 which was in turn privatised in the 1990s.

The station was closed on 7 December 1970 when a new station, also named 'Falmouth', was opened  away and nearer to the town; on 5 May 1975 the latter was renamed 'The Dell' and the 1863 station was reopened under its original name. On 15 May 1989, both were renamed: 'Falmouth' (this station) became 'Falmouth Docks', and 'The Dell' became 'Falmouth Town'. Passengers now have a choice of three stations in the town: Falmouth Docks, , and  (opened in 1925).

Location
The station is at the south end of the town on the hillside above the docks and near Pendennis Castle and Gyllyngvase Beach. The single platform is on the left hand side of trains arriving from . It is covered by a canopy but features a mosaic panel on its wall which depicts the link between the railway and the area's maritime heritage. It has level access from the car park.

Passenger volume
While passenger numbers have been steadily growing at most Cornish stations in recent years, the growth at Falmouth Docks has been exceptional.  More than 28,000 people passed through the station in the twelve months ending March 2003, but this had more than doubled just four years later and almost quadrupled by 2014–15.  Falmouth Town, however, continues to be the busiest of the three stations in Falmouth.

The statistics cover twelve month periods that start in April.

Services

They are now every 30 minutes Monday - Saturday day time and hourly at evenings and on Sundays. This is possible because of the new passing loop at .
