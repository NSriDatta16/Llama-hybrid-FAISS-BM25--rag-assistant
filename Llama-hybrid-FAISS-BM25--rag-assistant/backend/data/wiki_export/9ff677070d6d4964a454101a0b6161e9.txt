Osmorhiza is a genus of perennial herbs, known generally as sweet cicely, sweetcicely, or sweetroot.  Most species are native to North America, but some grow in South America and Asia.  Some species are used for medicinal purposes, but have dangerous lookalikes.  The fruits of this plant have barbs on the end allowing them to stick to clothing, fur, or feathers.

American Indians used the roots of sweet cicely as a panacea. It was used as a tonic for upset stomach and to ease childbirth. The root was poulticed on boils and wounds, and a root tea was used as an eye wash. Folk medicine list uses of the plant as an expectorant and as a tonic for coughs and for stomachaches.
