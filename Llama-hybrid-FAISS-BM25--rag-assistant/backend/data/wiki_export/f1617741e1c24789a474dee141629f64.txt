Lincoln High School is a public high school in Gahanna, Ohio, United States. It is in the Gahanna-Jefferson Public Schools district.

History 

The current school building opened in 1928 in what is now known as Lincoln Hall. Multiple expansions have been made to the building, most recently with the addition of Clark Hall in 2011.

The name 'Lincoln High School' is a result of an early struggle between the city of Gahanna and Jefferson Township. Despite being considered as an option, Jefferson High School was not chosen, and the City and Township compromised, naming the school Lincoln High School.

Lincoln High School's mascot is the Lion, giving rise to the nickname the "Home of the Lions." The school colors are Royal Blue and Athletic Gold. The  campus is made up of three buildings, named "Lincoln", "Jefferson", and "Hamilton". This compound, along with athletic facilities and the district administration building , take up nearly an entire block, bounded on the north by Havens Corners Road, and on the west by South Hamilton Road. The original 1928 building, renovated in 1987, is known today as Lincoln Hall.  The 2000 addition is known as Jefferson Hall and was built to replace the previous C Building which stood where the entrance to the stadium is today.  Hamilton Hall was originally constructed in 1963 and had additions in 1982 (an auditorium, a library, a band room, and an auxiliary gym) and 1995 (science classrooms, theater and TV classrooms, a choir room, a new main office complex and a second cafeteria).  The three buildings are all connected by inner hallways, however they can also all be accessed by outside doors.  Starting in the 2011-2012 school year the names Hamilton, Lincoln, and Jefferson Hall replaced the names A, B, and C Building, respectively.

The field was named the "Wib Strait, Sr. Field" in honor of Mr. Strait, a LHS Alum and lifetime Gahanna resident. Mr. Strait's family donated the funds for the first turf field in 2008. The locker room used by the football and boys track and field teams was renamed the "John Hickman Locker Room" in honor and memory of Mr. Hickman who served LHS for 45+ years in roles including: coach, teacher, head athletic trainer and Equipment Manager for many sports.
