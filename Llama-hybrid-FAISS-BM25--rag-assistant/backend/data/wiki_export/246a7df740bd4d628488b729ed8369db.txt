The Malaysian Chess Federation (MCF; ) is the principal authority over all chess events in Malaysia and organizes the Malaysian Chess Championship.

Controversies 
In 2017, a 12 year old girl was barred from attending the National Scholastic Chess Championship organised by the MCF held in a school in Putrajaya over her “seductive” knee-length dress. The news sparked outrage online with the MCF vowing to investigate the incident while denying that the decision was due to religious sensitivities.
