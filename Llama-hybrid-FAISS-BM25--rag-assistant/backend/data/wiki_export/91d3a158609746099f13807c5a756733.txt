He has won the Swedish Chess Championship three times, in 2007, 2008, and again in 2021, finishing then half a point ahead of three other players, including 2019 winner Erik Blomqvist.

Tiger has been called 'one of the most creative and non-traditional players', exemplified by his construction of 'one of the few self-administered pawn forks in chess history' in the game against Peter Heine Nielsen. His game against Tomas Laurusas at the 43rd Chess Olympiad was ranked best game of 2018 by the editors of Chess.com.

Tiger has written two books on the Modern Defense, including Tiger's Modern.
