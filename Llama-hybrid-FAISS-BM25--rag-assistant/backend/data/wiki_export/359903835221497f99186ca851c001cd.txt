Nordenskiöld Land National Park () is a national park in Spitsbergen island in the Svalbard archipelago, Norway. 

Opened in 2003, the park covers the southern part of Nordenskiöld Land, on the north shore of Van Mijenfjorden. The park includes Reindalen, which is Svalbard's largest ice-free valley and features moraines, rock glaciers, pingos and avalanche features. The valley has lush vegetation and the lower part is a wetland. The area is important for reindeer, Arctic fox, waders, geese and ducks.
