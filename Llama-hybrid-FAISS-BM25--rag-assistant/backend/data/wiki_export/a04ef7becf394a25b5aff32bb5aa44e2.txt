Sébastien Lifshitz (born 1968) is a French screenwriter and director. He teaches at La Fémis, a school that focuses on the subject of image and sound. He studied at the École du Louvre, and has a bachelor's degree from the University of Paris in history of art.

Career
Lifshitz's work involves LGBTQ+ themes. His 2004 film, Wild Side, involves several narratives, some told forward and some backward, about a transgender prostitute.

He is a two-time winner of the Teddy Award, presented by an independent committee at the Berlin International Film Festival to the year's best films with LGBT themes, winning Best Feature Film in 2004 for Wild Side and Best Documentary Film in 2013 for Bambi, a documentary profile of transgender French entertainer Marie-Pierre Pruvot.

In 2014, Rizzoli International published Lifshitz's The Invisibles: Vintage Portraits of Love and Pride, a collection of gay-themed photos from the early 20th century.
