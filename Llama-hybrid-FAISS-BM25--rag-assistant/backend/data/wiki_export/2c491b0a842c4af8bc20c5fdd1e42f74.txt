History

Work
The hospital supports the Human Tissue Resource Network by housing a constitute organization called the Tissue Procurement Shared Resources.

New hospital and expansion
In December 2014, The James opened a new hospital. With more than 1.1 million square feet, and 21 floors, "the New James" is now the third largest cancer hospital in the country. Designed by Architecture Firm, HOK, the construction project broke ground in 2010 and was the largest development project in The Ohio State University's history. The cost of construction was $1.1 billion. Every inpatient floor specializes in specific cancer sub-types, has dedicated areas for education as well as a translational research lab.

The James also has its own 15 bed emergency department that is strictly for cancer patients. It is fully integrated with the Medical Center's emergency department.
