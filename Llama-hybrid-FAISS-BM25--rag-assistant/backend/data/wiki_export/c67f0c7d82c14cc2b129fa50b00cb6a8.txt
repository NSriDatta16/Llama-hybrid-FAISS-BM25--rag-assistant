Umm Al Hassam () (trans. Mother of Sea Shells) is a middle-class neighbourhood on the southern coast of Manama, which is the capital of Bahrain. The neighborhood is home to the majority of Bahrain's local Jewish community. It consists of a mixture of grand villas and newer apartment buildings, and is well known for its Lebanese and Indian restaurants.

Abdulaziz Shamlan, a Bahraini nationalist leader from the 1950s and later Bahrain's Ambassador in Cairo, is one of the area's most famous ex-residents, along with the late Yousuf Abdulrahman Engineer whose house symbolizes tradition. Umm Al Hassam maintains its leftist traditions with the large headquarters for the National Democratic Action situated there.
