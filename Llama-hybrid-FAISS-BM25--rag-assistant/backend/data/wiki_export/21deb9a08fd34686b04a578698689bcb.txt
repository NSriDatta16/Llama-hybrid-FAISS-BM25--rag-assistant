Let 3 (; ) is a Croatian rock band based in Rijeka, Croatia formed in 1987. The frontmen are Damir "Mrle" Martinović (born 15 July 1961) and Zoran "Prlja" Prodanović (born 18 December 1964). Particularly popular in the former Yugoslavia, the band is known for their original approach to rock music and their obscene live performances. Their songs often contain provocative and vulgar lyrics. They represented Croatia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2023 with the song "".

History 

Let 3 was formed in Rijeka in the late 1980s. The band soon gained a reputation for their unprecedented, controversial and sometimes obscene performances, exemplifying the eclectic nature of Rijeka's music scene. The band's members have voiced support for liberal causes, such as women's and LGBT rights, and have taken a vocal stance against conservative politics and the Catholic Church.

In 1997, the band released their fifth album, titled  (translated as 'Outrageous' or 'Unheard-of'). It was distributed as a CD, but it had nothing recorded on it. Nonetheless, 350 copies of the album were sold. Just one copy of their follow-up,  (), was initially made; the band refused to sell or distribute it. The record company eventually released the album in slightly different versions. As a protest, the band staged a mock suicide by firing squad on Ban Jelačić Square in Zagreb.

In late 2000, the band unveiled a four-metre tall statue titled  (), depicting a woman with a horseshoe moustache and a one-metre long phallus. It was exhibited in various cities throughout Croatia.

In 2005, Let 3 released the single "" (), a play on the Serbian patriotic song "". In the song's music video, extras dressed in Serbian and Albanian national costumes are seen masturbating. The single featured on the studio album , which parodies Balkan machismo and militarism. The band stated: "We wanted to create an album of what people here fear the most; namely peasantry… and pornography". 

In December 2006, the band was sanctioned by police after performing naked at an open-air concert in Varaždin. The band's defence that they had not been naked because they had corks in their anuses did not convince the judge; the court found them guilty and fined each member  (). On 14 December 2008, the live afternoon talk show  was cut short by the host after two of the band members simulated the ejection of a cork from their rectums.

On 9 December 2022, Let 3 was announced as one of eighteen participants in , the Croatian national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2023, with the song "". For their performance, they were joined by artist Žanil Tataj Žak as the character "" (meaning 'Lenin' in ). They went on to win the competition by a landslide with a total of 279 points, thus gaining the right to represent Croatia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2023 in Liverpool, United Kingdom. They performed at the first semi-final on 9 May 2023, placing eighth and thus qualifying for the final, where they ultimately came 13th with a score of 123 points.
