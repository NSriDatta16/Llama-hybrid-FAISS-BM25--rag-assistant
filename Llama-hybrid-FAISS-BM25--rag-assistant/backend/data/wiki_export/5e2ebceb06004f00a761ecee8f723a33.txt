Club career
Spann has played in Italy, for Perugia and Sambenedettese. His move to Japan occurred after he failed to get a work permit in England, where Derby County and Crystal Palace were both interested in him.

Spann's contract with Japanese club Yokohama FC finished just before the 2006 World Cup, forcing him to return home where he re-signed for W Connection.

It was announced in July 2007 that Spann would be attending a two-week trial with Sunderland. He also spent time on trial at Sheffield United.

Silvio Spann later went on to sign a 3-year contract with Wrexham who play their football in the Football League Two after international teammates, and former Wrexham players, Carlos Edwards and Dennis Lawrence gave the club a glowing report. Silvio has been granted the number 16 shirt at Wrexham. He scored his first goal for the club in a 2–1 league defeat to Notts County, a game in which he later got sent off. He was transfer listed by Wrexham in May 2008 following the club's relegation to the Football Conference. Despite being transfer listed, he remained with the club until he was released at the end of the 2009–10 season.

International career
His international debut came against Barbados in July 2002. Spann had been named in the Trinidad and Tobago national team for the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, but had to drop out after sustaining a hamstring injury in the run-up to the tournament.

On 7 June 2007, in the Gold Cup Tournament at the Home Depot Center in Carson, Silvio Spann scored a spectacular free kick more than 40 meters out against El Salvador, but Trinidad & Tobago were defeated 2–1.
