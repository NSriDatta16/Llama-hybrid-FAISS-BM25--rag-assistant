The Luxembourg Cup () is the national knockout cup competition in Luxembourgian football. It was first held in 1922, and has been held annually since, with the exception of the four seasons during the German occupation during Second World War, though the 2019-20 and 2020-21 seasons were unable to be completed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Stade de Luxembourg hosts the final of the tournament.
