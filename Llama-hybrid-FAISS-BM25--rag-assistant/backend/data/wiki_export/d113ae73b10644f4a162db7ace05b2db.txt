History

Etymology 
The village has been known by many names over the years. These include Llangennydd, Llangennich, Llangenardh, Llangennach, Llangenarth, Llangenneth, Llangenyth, Llangennych and Langenardh. The likely origin of the village's name comes from the parish church, known as both St. Cennech's or St. Gwynnog's. The church is believed to have been dedicated to the brothers St. Cennydd and St. Gwynog, the sons of St. Gildas. Documents reveal that the village has commemorated St. Gwynog since at least the 16th century.

After their education, the Celtic saints who studied in Wales would become missionaries and form Christian cells. If successful, these cells would become a "Llan", an early Welsh word for enclosure.

Llangennech Estate 

The Llangennech Estate, covering around 4,000 acres of land, was formed between 1801 and 1803 when John Symmonds bought land from Sir John Stepney and various others. In 1804 it entered the hands of the Earl of Warwick and John Vancouver, brother of George Vancouver. After surrendering the estate back to Symmons in 1806, it was sold to the MP Edward Rose Tunno in 1821 or 1824. Tunno leased much of the estate. Thomas Margrave of the Llangennech Coal Company leased the "Llangennech Mansion" in 1826. The industrialist Richard Janion Nevill leased the mansion among other lands. He suffered a stroke at the Mansion and died the same day on ; his son and wife lived there until 1870. After Tunno's death, Edward Sartoris, Nevill's nephew and MP for Carmarthenshire, received the Llangennech estate. He went on to marry Nellie Grant, daughter of President Ulysses Grant.

Llangennech Park House was a country estate in what is now Maes Tŷ Gwyn. Attempts at securing protected site status were futile and it now stands abandoned.

The Rebecca Riots 
On 28 June 1843, rioters attacked and destroyed the Bridge End toll gate, which stood near where The Bridge public house stands today.

Whilst this is the only recorded occurrence of the Rebecca Riots in the village, residents still took part in them elsewhere. The Welshman reported that the  murderer of Sarah Williams, who is believed to be the only victim killed during the riots, was a "named shoemaker of Llangennech".

Industry

Coal 

The village's coal industry dates back to at least the 17th century, where the Duchy of Lancaster survey in 1609 talks of a Thomas Lloyd's "coleworks" in the Allt area of the village. "Llangennech Coal", as it was known, was used extensively around the world.

The 'RN' 
The village was home to a Royal Navy Stores Depot colloquially known as the 'RN'. Over 1,000 workers were employed by the depot during the Second World War. 

Its closure in 1988 exacerbated the problems caused by the closures of other industry in the area, namely unemployment.

Though it no longer belongs to the Royal Navy, the site still operates as a contractor for the Ministry of Defence, helping to equip the Bronco All Terrain Tracked Carrier vehicles which were used by the British Army during the war in Afghanistan.

Aircraft crashes 

On 17 March 1992, a Piper PA-30-320 Twin Comanche aircraft carrying two passengers and one pilot crashed in Llangennech on its flight back to Haverfordwest. The pilot and front seat passenger sustained only minor injuries, but the other passenger suffered a broken neck. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair.

During an air test flight of an English Electric Canberra on 13 January 1958, the engine failed, causing a steep dive to the ground. It crashed into marshland 200 yards from the railway station. The only occupant, Flight Lieutenant James Turnbull Wallace, was killed. He is buried at Llantwit Major Cemetery. The crash caused a thirty foot (9 metre) crater. Eyewitnesses saw a flaming parachute in the air as the plane came crashing down. No one was attached. Part of the parachute was later found fifty yards from the crater.

Derailment incident 
On 26 August 2020, ten tankers derailed near the village and spilled around 446,000 litres of fuel. The area of the spillage included a site of special scientific interest (SSSI) and a Special Area of Conservation (SAC). The incident caused major damage to these environments.
