David Adam (1936 – 24 January 2020) was a British Anglican priest and writer.

Adam was born in Alnwick, Northumberland. When he left school at 15, he went to work underground in the coal mines for three years before training for ordained ministry at Kelham Theological College. He was vicar of Danby-Castleton-Commondale in North Yorkshire for over 20 years, where he began writing prayers in the Celtic pattern. He later became rector of Holy Island, Lindisfarne, where he ministered to thousands of pilgrims and other visitors. He was made a canon of York Minster in 1989. He lived on the coast near Lindisfarne.
