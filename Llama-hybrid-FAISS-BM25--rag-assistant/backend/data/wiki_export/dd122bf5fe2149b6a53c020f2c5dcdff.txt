Metaphysical Interior with Biscuits () is a 1916 painting by Italian metaphysical painter Giorgio de Chirico. It is one of the earliest editions in a series of works that extended late into Chirico's career.

Like the others in this series, this painting depicts a room cluttered with objects in a surreal arrangement. In this case the main focus is a panel on which are mounted several biscuits (crackers) arranged to resemble an abstract face. Behind this panel is a picture in an irregularly shaped frame. The image in the frame is an architectural scene in the style of de Chirico's earlier work.
