In 2015, when Singapore hosted the 2015 Southeast Asian Games, it was the venue for the group stage matches of the football event. Later in the year, Japan national football team used the Bishan stadium as part of its training base ahead of their 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification against Singapore.

In 2016, Argentina national football team used the stadium as part of its training base ahead of the friendly match against Singapore.

In 2019, Italian club, Juventus also used its training facilities as part of the 2019 International Champions Cup. One of the greatest football players of all time, Cristiano Ronaldo also trained at the Bishan stadium.  

Following the conclusion of the 2020 Singapore Premier League season, the Bishan Stadium pitch was closed for play as it underwent a returfing exercise.

With the pitch laying completed towards the end of 2021, the venue was then used for the 2020 AFF Championship and hosted most of the matches in Group B involving Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Laos and Cambodia. However, following the tournament, the pitch was declared as unplayable even though the turf had been freshly laid.

Lion City Sailors returned to the Bishan Stadium for the 2023 Singapore Premier League season after a 2 years hiatus.

Video Assistant Referee 
The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) technology will feature for the first time in Singapore league history, starting from the upcoming 2023 season of the Singapore Premier League

Bishan Stadium have been retrofitted with remote cameras that relay the feeds back to the FAS headquarters in Jalan Besar which is operated centrally by a three-man team in the Production Control Room 2, which is the second such facility at the stadium. The VAR will have access to all the camera angles in the stadium and the Control Room can get these angles to check for any kind of situation from live speed to slow motion. New pitch-side camera systems that allow up to 40-time zoom have been installed, while network connectivity has been improved to deliver enhanced reliability and a smoother viewing experience. With VAR serving as extra pairs of eyes on the pitch, local football authorities hope to reduce bad refereeing calls, such as when a goal is wrongly disallowed for offside.
