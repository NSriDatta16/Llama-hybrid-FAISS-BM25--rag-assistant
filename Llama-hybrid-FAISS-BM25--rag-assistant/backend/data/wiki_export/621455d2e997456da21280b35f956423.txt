It was first held in 2009 in a growing response to include Dunedin into the Armageddon Expo family. The first event was held in the Dunedin Town Hall and from 2010 onwards at Castle Lecture Complex in the University of Otago. This event ceased after two years and was replaced by the Armageddon Expo Dunedin Show in 2012.
