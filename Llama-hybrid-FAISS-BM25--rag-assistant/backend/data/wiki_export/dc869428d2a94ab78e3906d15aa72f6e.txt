R3 was a 50-minute British television drama series produced by the BBC between 1964 and 1965. Its full title was Ministry of Research Centre No. 3. The series starred John Robinson as Sir Michael Gerrard, Jeremy Young as Wilson, David Blake Kelly as Captain Rogers, and was set in a scientific research facility at the Ministry of Research. R3 is also notable for providing early TV exposure for a young Oliver Reed, cast as one of the scientists on the ministry staff, Dr. Richard Franklin.

No episodes of this series are thought to have survived the BBC's purging of the archives between the 1960s and 70s. However, a trailer from one edition was supposedly recovered from a tape in 2004, but has not been shown publicly.
