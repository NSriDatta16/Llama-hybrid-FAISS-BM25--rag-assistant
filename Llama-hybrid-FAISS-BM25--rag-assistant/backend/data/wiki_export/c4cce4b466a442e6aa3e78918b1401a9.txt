History

Depletion of Natural Resources  
Pinchot State Forest was formed in response to the depletion of the forests of Pennsylvania during the mid-to-late 19th century. Conservationists like Dr. Joseph Rothrock feared that the forests would not regrow if they were not managed properly. Lumber and Iron companies had harvested the old-growth forests on a massive scale. They clear cut the forests and left behind nothing but dried tree tops and rotting stumps. The sparks of passing steam locomotives ignited wildfires that prevented the formation of second growth forests. Conservationists feared that the forest would never regrow if there was not a change in the philosophy of forest management. They called for the state to purchase land from the lumber and iron companies and the lumber and iron companies were more than willing to sell their land since that had depleted the natural resources of the forests.

Legislative Response 
A change began in 1895 when Dr. Rothrock was appointed the first commissioner of the Pennsylvania Department of Forests and Waters, the forerunner of today's Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. The Pennsylvania General Assembly passed legislation in 1897 that authorized the purchase of "unseated lands for forest reservations." This was the beginning of the State Forest system. Pinchot State Forest began a few years later, in 1902, with the purchase of  of land in Thornhurst Township, Lackawanna County, from William and Catherine McMurtry for $3,567.40. It was originally known as Lackawanna State Forest.

Expansion and Renaming 
Since 2005, the state forest has expanded from  to . Added tracts include  in Mocanaqua, the  Seven Tubs Recreation Area,  at Deep Hollow, the  Moon Lake State Forest Recreation Area,  on Montage Mountain, and  in the Thornhurst section in Lackawanna County. In 2015, Lackawanna State Forest was renamed Pinchot State Forest in honor of Gifford Pinchot.
