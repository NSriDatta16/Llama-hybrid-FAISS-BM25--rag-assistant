Journalism

Stephen was the founding editor of Black Belt Presents: FIGHTSPORT with Stephen Quadros (2001–2002), a full-color glossy magazine with newsstand distribution published by Black Belt Magazine. Prior to that, Quadros was a contributing editor/columnist for Black Belt (1998–2001) and Fighters Only (2005–2006), editor-in-chief of Kickboxing Ring Report (1993–1998) and was published in popular combat sport publications such as Inside Kung Fu, Karate/Kung Fu Illustrated, Grappling Magazine and Full Contact Fighter.

Quadros was the host of the eponymously titled Stephen Quadros Show on the Sherdog Radio Network, which debuted on June 12, 2007. It was a weekly, one-hour program that aired live on Tuesdays at 12:00 PM PST, featuring commentary by Quadros and co-host Aaron Crecy, listener calls and interviews. The show featured live segments with mixed martial arts stars such as Dan Henderson, Randy Couture, Quinton Jackson, Renzo Gracie, Frank Shamrock, Ken Shamrock, Bas Rutten, B.J. Penn, Rashad Evans, Matt Lindland, Matt Serra, Ian Freeman and Don Frye. Quadros left Sherdog Radio Network in 2008, citing his schedule could no longer accommodate it.

During Quadros' career as a broadcaster, he has been known for his creative descriptions of fighters and fights, occasionally giving nicknames, or coining terms or phrases. Case is point is "lay and pray," a frequently used mixed martial arts (MMA) term coined by Quadros during the televised broadcast of the PRIDE Fighting Championships event titled "Cold Fury", which was held at the Saitama Super Arena in Japan on December 9, 2000.

The phrase (‘lay and pray’) refers to a situation where a wrestler or grappler keeps another fighter, who is perceived to have the better striking skills, pinned or controlled on the mat to avoid a stand up, boxing, kickboxing or Muay Thai style fight, yet exhibiting little or no urgency to finish the grounded opponent with a knockout or a submission. The inference is that the wrestler/grappler takes the striker down, lies on him to neutralize the opponent's striking weapons, and prays that they don't return to the standing position.

At the PRIDE "Cold Fury" show in 2000, in the 7th fight of the evening, former Japan national Greco-Roman wrestling champion Kazuyuki Fujita faced Dutch Muay Thai stylist Gilbert Yvel, in a classic wrestler versus striker mixed martial arts (MMA) matchup. The result a relatively slow-paced fight that ended in a decision, where Fujita took Yvel to the floor repeatedly and mostly just held him in the downed position, which lead PRIDE play-by-play announcer Stephen Quadros to utter the following passage in the final round during the broadcast:

"There’s ground and pound, that’s when a wrestler, primarily, is on top and throws punches downward. But there’s also Bas (Rutten, Quadros's PRIDE broadcasting partner), can I coin a phrase tonight? Can you call it ‘lay and pray’ that they don’t stand up?"
