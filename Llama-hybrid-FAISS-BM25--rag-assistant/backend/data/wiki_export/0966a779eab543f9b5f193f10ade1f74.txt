History

Founded in 1911, the team plays its home games at Neilson Park.

Haddington player Jock Wemyss founded the Co-optimists; following a Barbarians inspired match in Haddington in 1924.

Player development

The minis section was set up almost 50 years ago by Bill Hamilton.

The minis and the School of Rugby with Knox Academy are key to the ongoing success serving as nursery for players. Haddington currently have over 100 kids in each; and the club are delighted that they recently managed to play a couple of girls matches as they seek to develop a woman's team.

There is a tradition of families serving the Club, with many sets of brothers, fathers sons and grandsons turning out.
