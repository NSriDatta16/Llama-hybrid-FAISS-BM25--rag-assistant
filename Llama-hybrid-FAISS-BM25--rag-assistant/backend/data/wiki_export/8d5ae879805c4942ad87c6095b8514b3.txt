The  is a supermini/subcompact hatchback or a mini MPV manufactured and marketed worldwide by Nissan. Introduced in 2004, the first-generation Note was primarily marketed in Japan and Europe, and was produced in Japan and the United Kingdom. The second-generation model was sold in other regions, including North America where it was manufactured in Mexico and marketed as the Versa Note, and Thailand, where it serves as one of the B-segment hatchback offered by the brand alongside the smaller March/Micra under the Eco Car tax scheme.

In 2017, the second-generation Note was replaced by the French-built K14 Micra for the European market. The Versa Note was discontinued in North America in 2019 due to the decreasing demand for subcompact hatchbacks in the region. It continued to be produced and sold in Japan up to the introduction of the third-generation Note in late 2020.

The Note was introduced with a series hybrid drivetrain in late 2016 as the Note e-Power. Due to its popularity and the push of electrification, the third-generation Note is only available with the e-Power drivetrain, which consumes 29.5km/l (69m/USg).

First generation (E11; 2004)

Tone concept (2004) 
Nissan Note was developed to replace the unpopular Almera Tino which has proved to be a failure in Europe, with only 200,000 cars sold in 7 years. The main rival of Almera Tino, Renault Scénic, had 1,400,000 cars sold just in two years after the introduction of the second-generation model. Renault will later also introduce their mini-MPV named Modus, which will also become best-seller by late 2005. The development of what would become Note started around summer 2002. As a result, the Nissan Tone concept was created. It was unveiled at the 2004 Paris Motor Show. While similar to production model in general, the concept has some unique features such as U-shaped panoramic roof, and a large dashboard screen inside. The concept was equipped with automatic gearbox and always had its rear doors locked. Chris Lee, Nissan's product manager, says that many millions of dollars were invested in development and that Note was meant to be sold with pricetag under €13,000.

Production model (2005) 
The production version was unveiled and went on sale on 20 January 2005 in Japan. The European model was unveiled at the 2005 Frankfurt Motor Show, followed by the 2006 Geneva Motor Show. Retail models went on sale in Europe in early 2006. The United Kingdom was the first market to have the Note launch, being released on 1 March 2006. The car shares some of its underpinnings with the Renault Modus, and manufactured at Nissan's plant in Washington, England. Early models included a choice of four engines, which are 1.4-litre and 1.6-litre petrol; and two options of 1.5-litre diesel. It is an indirect successor to the conventional medium-sized Almera hatchback for the region.

The trim levels for the European market were the S, SE and SVE, while later it is replaced by Visia, Visia+, Acenta, Acenta R and Tekna. In Russia/CIS region, Nissan sold Note with Comfort, Luxury and Tekna trim levels. Cars made for this market before 2009 have standard OBDII diagnostics especially software disabled by Nissan.
