Tiddas were an all-female folk trio from Victoria, Australia.

Biography

1990–1992: Career beginnings and Inside My Kitchen

Originally the three women, Amy Saunders (a Gunditjmara woman from Portland), Lou Bennett (a Yorta Yorta Dja Dja Wurrung woman from Echuca) and Sally Dastey (from West Heidelberg) combined their vocal talents as backing singers for Aboriginal band Djaambi, led by Saunders' brother Richard Frankland in 1990. The group were invited to perform at a musical celebration for women's artistic achievement, 'Hot Jam Cooking', in Richmond, Victoria. Their performance was well received and inspired Ruby Hunter to dub the trio Tiddas, which is Koori for the "sisters".

After performing together for over a year the band came to the attention of Paul Petran, host of ABC National Radio show 'Music Deli', who assisted Tiddas to record their debut EP, Inside My Kitchen in 1991. Inside My Kitchen was released in October 1992 and received two nominations, for 'Best New Talent' and 'Best Indigenous Release', at the ARIA Music Awards of 1993.

1993–1997: Sing About Life and Tiddas

Tiddas quickly became live favourites, touring with Sweet Honey in the Rock and Midnight Oil, adding didgeridoo player Tim "Froggie" Holtze for their first studio album Sing About Life which was released in November 1993. The album peaked at No. 36 on the ARIA charts, achieved gold record sales in Australia (35,000 copies sold), was nominated 'Breakthrough Artist – Album', and won 'Best Indigenous Record' at the ARIA Music Awards of 1994. National and international tours followed, including several WOMAD concerts. Sing About Life was released in the United States in September 1995, spurring tours of North America and Europe.

The group's second studio album was produced by Joe Camilleri titled Tiddas and was released in Australia in August 1996 reaching No. 26 on the ARIA charts. The album was nominated for 'Best Indigenous Release' at the ARIA Music Awards of 1997. The first single, "Ignorance is Bliss", was reputedly inspired by an argument with Bob Geldof while touring in 1993. Backing musicians on the album included the Black Sorrows' Jen Anderson on violin, Joe Camilleri on sax (on "Waving Goodbye"), Peter Luscombe on drums, Steve Hadley on bass, and Weddings, Parties, Anything's Mark "Squeezebox Wally" Wallace on piano accordion. A second single "Walk Alone" was released in 1997.

1998–2000: Lethal By the Kilo, Show Us Ya Tiddas and split

In 1998, the girls sang on "Yil Lull" which was released as Singers For The Red Black & Gold. The third studio album, Lethal By the Kilo, was recorded in Melbourne's ABC studios in late 1998. The album received almost no promotion from the record company and failed to chart. On 11 September 1999, Tiddas recorded a live performance at Continental Café which was released as Show Us Ya Tiddas later in 1999.

In May 2000 Tiddas announced they were to break up, and spent months on a national tour to say farewell to their fans. In 2000 Tiddas were awarded a Deadly Award for 'Outstanding Contribution to Aboriginal Music'.

2018: Reformation and NIMA Hall of Fame
In 2018, the trio announced they were reuniting for a one-off national tour to celebrate the release of Archie Roach's “lost” album, Dancing with My Spirit, which was recorded in the 1990s and released in April 2018.

In August 2019, Tiddas were inducted into the National Indigenous Music Awards Hall of Fame.
