Family
She married Cecil Calvert, second Lord Baltimore. A settlement arrangement for the union was made on 20 March 1627/28. According to Gibbs, she is said to have been a most beautiful and accomplished woman. The marriage coincided with the groom's father Sir George Calvert, first Lord Baltimore, (1578-1632) embarking on his first colonial endeavor in Avalon, located in Newfoundland (of future eastern Canada). Following the failure of the Avalon Colony, Cecil Calvert oversaw a second colonial enterprise in 1633, this time aimed at the Chesapeake Bay area, north of the colony of Virginia. The new colony was named "Maryland" after Henrietta Maria, the French-born consort of King Charles I.
