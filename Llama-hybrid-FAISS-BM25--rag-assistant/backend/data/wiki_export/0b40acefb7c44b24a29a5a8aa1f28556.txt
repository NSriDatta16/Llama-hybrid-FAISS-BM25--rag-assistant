Radio Battalions are tactical signals intelligence units of Marine Corps Intelligence. There are currently three operational Radio Battalions in the Marine Corps organization: 1st, 2nd, and 3rd. In fleet operations, teams from Radio Battalions are most often attached to the command element of Marine Expeditionary Units.

Concept

A Radio Battalion consists mainly of signals intelligence and electronic intelligence operators organized into smaller tactical units with different roles. Basic collection teams consist of 4–6 operators using specialized equipment based in HMMWVs. A variation on this is the MEWSS (Mobile Electronic Warfare Support System), which is an amphibious light armored vehicle equipped with similar electronic warfare equipment. MEWSS crews serve dual roles as electronic warfare operators and LAV crewmen. Radio Reconnaissance Platoons serve in a special operations role where the use of standard collection teams is not possible, such as covert infiltrations or tactical recovery of aircraft and personnel (TRAP).

History

In June 1943, 2nd Radio Intelligence Platoon was activated at Camp Elliott, California. The unit took part in the Battle of Guadalcanal and the Battle of Peleliu. The 3rd Radio Intelligence Platoon was also formed in June 1943 and took part in the Battles of the Kwajalein Atoll and Okinawa. 

General Alfred M. Gray Jr., who served as the 29th Commandant of the Marine Corps from 1 July 1987 until his retirement on 30 June 1991, is considered the founding father of post-war Marine Corps signals intelligence (SIGINT).  In 1955 then Captain Gray was tasked with forming two SIGINT units, one to be assigned to Europe and the other to the Pacific area, chosen from Marines undergoing Manual Morse intercept training.  Captain Gray established the Pacific team at NSG Kamiseya, Japan in May 1956. 

In 1958 then-Captain Gray was assigned to Hawaii to form and activate the 1st Radio Company, a tactical signals intelligence (SIGINT) unit, where he would serve from September 1958 to May 1961.  From World War II until the early 1960s, various units performed radio intercepts, growing from platoon to company and, in 1964, to 1st Radio Battalion.

Sub-units of the battalion were deployed to Vietnam from 1965 to 1975, including participation in evacuation efforts during the Fall of Saigon. In the early 1980s, 2nd Radio Battalion was part of the multinational peacekeeping force in Beirut, Lebanon. More recently, Radio Battalions served in Operation Desert Storm, Somalia, Kosovo, the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, and the 2004 Operation Phantom Fury in Fallujah. Radio Battalions also send detachments to augment intelligence efforts at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba, and at other bases throughout the world.

In Afghanistan, Radio Battalion proved especially effective against improvised explosive devices.

Organization

1st Radio Battalion

1st Radio Battalion, reformed in August 2004, is based at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, California, and supports the I Marine Expeditionary Force (I MEF). The battalion maintains four companies: Alpha, Bravo, Charlie and H&S Companies. 1st Radio Battalion was first based at Marine Corps Base Hawaii, Kāneohe Bay, and operated out of there for several decades until it was reformed at Camp Pendleton.

Operation Iraqi Freedom

During the battle for Diyala Bridge in Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), 1st RadBn supported Regimental Combat Team-1 (RCT-1) with an operational control element (OCE) and a SIGINT Support Team (SST) that identified Iraqi conduct of fire nets and Iraqi forward observers preparing to call in artillery fire on RCT-1.   The RadBn OCE coordinated via the RCT-1 air officer with a Marine EA-6B "Prowler" from VMAQ-2 to jam the conduct of fire net for the duration of RCT-1's assault, resulting in the inability of Iraqi Army units defending the bridge to call in artillery on the RCT-1 units.

2nd Radio Battalion

2nd Radio Battalion, also known as America's Radio Battalion, is the oldest Radio Battalion having been established as the 1st Radio Intelligence Platoon, Signals Company, Headquarters Battalion, 1st Marine Division on 2 January 1943. 2nd Radio Battalion (informally known as RadBn) based at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, supports the II Marine Expeditionary Force (II MEF). The battalion consists of three operations companies and a Headquarters and Support company. Alpha Company consists of Operation and Control Element's (OCE) 1 and 2 and an Operation Control and Analysis Center (OCAC). Bravo company is charged with supporting the 22nd, 24th and 26th Marine Expeditionary Units. Bravo supplies Collection Teams, Analysts and also contains MEWSS Teams and Radio Reconnaissance Teams. Charlie Company currently has two OCEs and currently serves as an EAS platoon for those Marines about to get out and a training platoon for new Marines arriving from MOS School. Headquarters and Support Company supports all activities of Alpha, Bravo and Charlie companies as needed.
In 2011, Sgt. Paul Boothroyd of 2nd Radio Battalion notably survived being shot in the head by a round fired from a 7.62 x 54mm Dragunov sniper in Afghanistan. The bullet reportedly pierced his kevlar helmet and was deflected into his neck. The round was later surgically removed. On the same deployment, during a combat operation, Sgt Lucas Todd Pyeatt was killed by an IED while approaching Taliban insurgents in Machi Kehyl, Kajaki District, Helmand Province.  Luke was Charlie Co. SIGINT Support Team 6 team leader and insisted on taking the first patrol so he would have a better understanding of the area to better prepare his team for similar actions. For this action Luke was awarded the Director of National Intelligence Medal of Valor.  Luke's name has also been added to the National Security Agency Wall of Honor.  He is buried in Section 60 at Arlington National Cemetery. Also notably, just weeks prior to the death of Sgt Pyeatt, LCpl Marcus Dandrea had also suffered injuries due to an IED and was awarded the Purple Heart after losing both of his legs and receiving extensive damage to one of his hands.

3rd Radio Battalion

3rd Radio Battalion, located aboard Marine Corps Base Hawaii in Kāneohe Bay, traces its lineage to 1943 with the creation of the 3d Radio Intelligence Platoon. Most recently, since August 2003, the Battalion has served in a dual support role of both I and III Marine Expeditionary Force including providing the signals intelligence support platoon for the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit. Following the units return from Iraq in February 2006, 3d Radio Battalion began focusing on supporting the Global War on Terrorism, most notably by providing personnel to SOCPAC in support of Operation Enduring Freedom – Philippines

In October 2008 3rd Radio Battalion deployed as part of SPMAGTF-A to Helmand Province in Southern Afghanistan as part of the ISAF troop surge, and participated in several major operations including the Battle of Now Zad as well as Operation Khanjar.
