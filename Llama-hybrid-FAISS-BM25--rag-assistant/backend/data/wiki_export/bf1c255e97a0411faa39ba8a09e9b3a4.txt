Tennis career

He was granted direct entry into the qualifying draw, which saw him defeat Johan Rousseaux 6–4, 6–4 and Cristiano Caratti 6–2, 7–6(10–8) in the first two rounds prior to being defeated in the third and final round by Renzo Furlan 3–6, 3–6. He would however be gifted a lucky loser entry when sixth seeded Roger Federer withdrew from the tournament. He faced wild card compatriot Nicolas Mahut in the first round and bettered him by a score of 6–4, 6–3 before falling to another Frenchman and eventual runner-up Nicolas Escudé 1–6, 6–7(3–7).

Gicquel made his ATP Tour doubles main draw debut when he received a wild card entry into the 2005 French Open alongside compatriot Nicolas Devilder. They would optimize the opportunity they were given and defeated first round opponents Jordan Kerr and Sebastián Prieto 4–6, 7–5. 11–9 prior to bowing out with a second round loss to sixth seeds Leander Paes and Nenad Zimonjić 1–6, 3–6. He would also be given a wild card entry into the mixed doubles draw alongside Sandrine Testud, and they won their first two matches including a second round upset of the number 3 seeded Zimbabwean siblings Cara Black and Wayne Black 6–3, 2–6. 6–3 before falling in the quarterfinals to Paul Hanley and Samantha Stosur 4–6, 1–6.

On November 6, 2006, he broke into the top 50 after reaching his first ATP Tour final in Lyon, where he was defeated by Richard Gasquet. On April 30, 2007, Gicquel broke into the top 40 after reaching the semifinals of Casablanca. He reached a career high ATP singles ranking of World No. 37 achieved on 8 September 2008. He also reached a career high ATP doubles ranking of World No. 38 achieved on 12 January 2009.

He defeated second seed Tommy Robredo at the 2007 Grand Prix de Tennis de Lyon in the first round, and beat Alejandro Falla in the semifinals to reach the Lyon final for the second year running. Gicquel's run, however, was halted by another Frenchman, Sébastien Grosjean.

One of Gicquel's most famous matches was against Nicolas Kiefer at the French Open in 2006. Kiefer won the first two sets 6–0, 6–1, but Gicquel won the next two 7–5, 6–3. Kiefer eventually won the fifth set 11–9 after Gicquel had already saved multiple match points.
