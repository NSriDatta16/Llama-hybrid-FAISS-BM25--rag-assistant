Stephen Shelton Bradley (born March 26, 1962 in Middleburg, Virginia) is an internationally successful rider in the equestrian sport of eventing. He has competed internationally since 1989, with great achievements including a place on the US Eventing Team at the 1992 Summer Olympics, and in 1993 he became only the second American to have won the prestigious Burghley Horse Trials.

Bradley had a bad fall at the 1992 Rolex Kentucky Three Day, but returned to competition the following year with several impressive wins.

Some of his best horses include Brandenburg’s Joshua, Sassy Reason, Dr. Dolittle, and Fröm
