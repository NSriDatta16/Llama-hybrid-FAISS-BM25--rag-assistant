KWBN (channel 44) is a religious television station in Honolulu, Hawaii, United States, airing programming from the Daystar Television Network. The station is owned and operated by Ho'ona'auao Community Television, a subsidiary of Daystar parent company Word of God Fellowship. KWBN's transmitter is located in Akupu, Hawaii.

KWBN, which signed on the air in 1999, is one of six religious stations serving the Honolulu television market, with KWHE, KAAH-TV, KALO, KKAI and KUPU being the other five.

KWBN's allocation channel, like KALO and PBS member station KHET, is reserved for non-commercial use, and as such, must rely on paid religious programs, educational fare, and viewer donations for support.
