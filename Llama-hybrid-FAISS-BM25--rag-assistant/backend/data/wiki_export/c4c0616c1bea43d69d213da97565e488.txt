Bauer Street contains several hotels, restaurants and clothing shops. Bargara is also a popular fishing, swimming and surfing location.

The Mon Repos turtle rookery is located just north of Bargara.

History

The district was originally known as Sandhills, but was renamed Bargara in 1913. The name Bargara is derived from the names of two adjacent localities, Barolin and Woongarra.
