The 554th Electronic Systems Wing (554 ELSW) is an inactive wing of the United States Air Force.  It was last stationed at Hanscom Air Force Base, Massachusetts, where it was inactivated in 2010.

History

World War II
The wing was first activated in Northern Ireland under VII Air Force Composite Command as the 3d Combat Crew Replacement Center Group.  It used Martin B-26 Marauders and Douglas A-20 Havocs to provide combat and theater indoctrination for Eighth Air Force combat crews from November 1943 until September 1944, when the need for dedicated Army Air Forces training units in the United Kingdom was reduced.

The group's resources were used to man and equip provisional air disarmament units participating in Operation Lusty.  These units moved to France in February 1945 and advanced with Allied ground forces, seizing, securing, inventorying, and disposing of  captured Luftwaffe equipment and materiel through October 1945.  The group inactivated the following month. It was disbanded in the fall of 1948.

Support for Nellis Air Force Base and the Continental Range
The group was reconstituted as the 554th Operations Support Wing in 1980.  It provided base support functions for Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada and its associated ranges from 1980 to 1991. The wing developed, operated, and maintained all range facilities and threat simulators and provided combat support functions at Indian Springs Air Force Auxiliary Field.

Systems Management
The 554th Electronic Systems Wing was consolidated in 2006 with the Operations Support Systems Wing, which had been established in 2004 at Hanscom AFB, Massachusetts.  The wing was inactivated in June 2010.
