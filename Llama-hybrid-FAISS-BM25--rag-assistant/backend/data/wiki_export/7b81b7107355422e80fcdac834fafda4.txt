Harlequins
On 16 December 2009, Harlequins announced that O'Shea would become their new Director of Rugby replacing Dean Richards. He started his new position on 15 March 2010, midway through the 2009/10 season.

In his first full season in charge, he restored Harlequins to the Heineken Cup for the 2011–12 season following a 7th-place finish in the 2010–11 Aviva Premiership. He guided Quins to the semi-finals of the 2010–11 LV Cup and to the final of the 2010–11 European Challenge Cup, defeating Stade Français 19–18. In 2012, Quins topped the 2011–12 Aviva Premiership table at the end of the regular season with 75 points (17 wins, 1 draw, 4 losses). They defeated Northampton Saints 25–23 in the semi-finals to progress to the final against Leicester Tigers.

Harlequins dropped even further down the table during the 2014–15 Aviva Premiership, finishing 8th overall, which also meant they dropped out of the top flight European tournament. Quins did, however, make it all the way to the final of the 2015–16 European Rugby Challenge Cup, but were defeated by Montpellier 26–19, which was O'Shea's last match in charge of the team.

Head coach of Italy
On 25 March 2016, after months of speculation, O'Shea was named the new head coach of the Italian national team, bringing with him Englishman Mike Catt. O'Shea's first match in charge was during the 2016 June internationals, where Italy toured the Americas. The tour began with a closely fought defeat to Argentina 30–24, before going onto beat the United States, 24–20, and Canada, 20–18. During the 2016 end of year tests, having heavily lost to New Zealand 68–10, O'Shea on 19 November, helped Italy to their first-ever victory against South Africa winning 20–18. However, the following week saw Italy lose to Tonga for the first time since 1999, 19–17.

In O'Shea's first Six Nations Championship, Italy lost all five games and failed to pick up a single point for the table. Despite leading Wales 7–3 in the opening round, they conceded 30 points in the second half to lose 33–7. This was followed by a loss to Ireland 63–10 and a loss to England despite also leading England at Twickenham 10–5 at half time and still within a score to win at the 60th minute. A loss to France 40–18 meant it was guaranteed Italy would finish bottom. The last week saw Italy fail to score any points against Scotland, losing 29–0. During Italy's June tests, Italy failed to win a game, losing to Scotland 34–13 in Singapore, Fiji 22–19 with a last minute drop goal by Ben Volavola to seal the victory for Fiji, before going onto lose to Australia 40–27. However the score was 28–27 with less than five minutes to go in the game, but two quick tries by the Wallabies saw them comfortably win the game. The 2017 end-of-year tests saw Italy gain a single victory in three tests, defeating Fiji 19–10, but losing to Argentina 15–31 and South Africa 6–35.

The 2018 Six Nations Championship saw Italy gain their first table point since 2015, with a losers bonus point being earned in the final round when Italy lost to Scotland 29–27. The other matches, saw Italy not only fail to gain a victory, but were also denied a losers and try bonus point, losing 46–15 to England, 56–19 to Ireland, 34–17 to France and 38–14 to Wales. In June 2018, O'Shea took Italy on a two-test series against Japan. The series ended in a 1–1 draw, after losing the first test 34–17, but brought the series level in the second test with a 25–22 victory.

During the 2018/19 international season for Italy, they won just one in nine games; defeating Georgia 28–17 during the November test window. They lost all games during the 2019 Six Nations Championship, finishing bottom of the table for the fourth year in a row, three times under O'Shea. At the 2019 Rugby World Cup, Italy were eliminated in the pool stage, finishing in third place in Pool B behind New Zealand and South Africa; although this granted them automatic qualification for the 2023 Rugby World Cup, O'Shea resigned in November 2019, six months before the end of his contract with the Italian Rugby Federation, to take a position as the Rugby Football Union's (England) director of performance.
