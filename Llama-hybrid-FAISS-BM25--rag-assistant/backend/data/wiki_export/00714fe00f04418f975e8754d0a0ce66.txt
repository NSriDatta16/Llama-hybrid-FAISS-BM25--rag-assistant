Everton de Viña del Mar is a Chilean football club based in the city of Viña del Mar.

The club was founded 24 June 1909 after a group of Anglo-Chilean teenagers formed a football club and named it after the English team Everton who had recently completed a pioneering tour of South America. The club's nickname is "Ruleteros" or the roulette players in English, after Viña del Mar's status as a gambling resort.

Everton is Chile's sixth most successful team, having won the national title 4 times, an achievement shared with both Audax Italiano and Magallanes. Additionally, it is the second most successful team outside Santiago de Chile, behind Cobreloa of Calama.

The club's home stadium is the 22,340 capacity Estadio Sausalito, while its biggest rival is Santiago Wanderers of Valparaíso. In the meetings between the two clubs, Everton have won 65 to 49 losses.

History

Foundation and Amateur Era
On 24 June 1909, a group of immigrants from England, led by David Foxley, founded Everton Football Club in Cerro Alegre of Valparaíso. The choice of this name is still to this day a mystery, although there are various competing theories. The most accepted theory is that this was chosen in honour of the namesake club in the city of Liverpool, which was, by then, touring Argentina. Another theory states the name of a toffee at the time. The first president was Francisco Boundy, while David Foxley was appointed honorary chairman. In 1950 the club was renamed Everton de Viña del Mar.

The first match played was against Graphie FC with the starting lineup composed of Arturo Foxley as the goalkeeper, Percy Holmes and Francisco Boundy as the defenders; Alberto González, Hugo Boundy and Carlos González as the midfielders and finally J. Escobar, A. Aravena, David Foxley, V. Estay and Malcolm Fraser as the strikers.

Originally the club was a compendium of different sports, the most important being track and field, human swimming, badminton, rugby, gymnastics, basketball and football.

Everton's first championship participation was the 1912 amateur championship of the Liga de Valparaíso.

The Golden age

Everton's first championship win was in 1950 under the Argentine coach Martín García. They defeated Unión Española 1–0 away in a play-off on 14 January 1951. The lone goal was scored by René Meléndez in the Estadio Nacional de Chile before 45,000 spectators.

In 1951, Everton finished the league in fourth, 5 points behind Audax Italiano. The following year, Everton clinched the Primera División with two weeks to spare, as Martín García's side beat Audax Italiano 4–0 at home win. In the championship-winning squad the most prominent players were José María Lourido, Elías Cid and René Meléndez, top-scorer of the tournament with 30 goals. During this period the club also won against important clubs of South America, the most recorded match was against the Argentine club Independiente of Avellaneda, in a 5–0 home win at Estadio El Tranque with 12,000 spectators.

The performance of the club began to decline, and apart from a third-place finish in 1955, Everton's highest finish for the remainder of the 1950s would be sixth position in the 12-team league.
