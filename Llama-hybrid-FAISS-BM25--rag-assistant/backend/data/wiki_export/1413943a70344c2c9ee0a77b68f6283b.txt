History 
The town's name comes from a story of a milk maid by the name of Marika who was graced with a son by Swamy Chennakesava. The milk maid, in commemoration of this event, constructed a small temple. Soon afterwards a village grew round and about this temple and was known as Marikapuram. By afflux of time this name evolved into Markapuram. The temple, originally constructed by Marika, underwent numerous additions and renovations, the later large and prominent temple being dedicated to Sri Chennakesava.

This town was a part of Kurnool District until 1971. Yerragondapalem, Markapuram, and Giddalur talukas were in Kurnool district until, in 1971 a carve-out made a new district (along with Kanigiri, Podili, Darsi, Kandukur from Nellore District and Ongole and Chirala from Guntur district).
