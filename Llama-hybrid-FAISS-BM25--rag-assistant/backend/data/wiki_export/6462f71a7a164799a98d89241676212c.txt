Florent Prévost (1794 – 1 February 1870) was a French naturalist and illustrator.

Prévost was assistant naturalist at the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle. He was the author of various zoological works, including Les Pigeons par Madame Knip (1843) and, with C. L. Lemaire,  Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux d'Europe (1845). He did illustrative work in books by Coenraad Jacob Temminck (1778–1858), Charles Lucien Bonaparte (1803–1857) and Georges-Louis Leclerc de Buffon (1707–1788).

He worked on the birds from the voyage of La Venus with Marc Athanese Parfait Oeillet Des Murs, and on the birds and mammals brought back from the French expedition to Abyssinia between 1839 and 1843.

Prevost's ground sparrow (Melozone biarcuatum), Prevost's squirrel (Callosciurus prevostii), and Gerard's water snake (Gerarda prevostiana) are named after him.
