A World Without Dave is an EP by Carter the Unstoppable Sex Machine. It was the group's only EP release of original material and was their first release after signing for Cooking Vinyl in 1997.

A World Without Dave was released as an EP to reduce the retail price compared to a full-length album, with the intention of generating higher sales.  The album was also the first recorded with bass player Salv and guitarist Steve, each of whom would remain part of Carter until the group's demise.  The album reached number 73 in the UK Albums Chart.

 The U.S version and the German version contain 9 tracks rather than just the first six due to Cooking Vinyl's American arm asking for more tracks.
 The EP was included in the 2018 vinyl box set “The Studio Recordings 1988-1998”, and featured the U.S. and Germany track listing plus one additional track, making it the length of a full studio album.
