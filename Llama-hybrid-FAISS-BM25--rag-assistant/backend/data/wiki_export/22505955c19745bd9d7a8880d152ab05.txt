Music video
The video for the song was directed by Ulf Buddensieck. The band is performing in a garage, and the story is each of them going out with a girl and being popular. It then ends up with the girl being seen with one of the school football team players. There is also an adult version, while they are singing the final chorus, which sees a woman with no bra on underneath some pom-poms. The girl then removes the pom-poms, exposing her breasts.
