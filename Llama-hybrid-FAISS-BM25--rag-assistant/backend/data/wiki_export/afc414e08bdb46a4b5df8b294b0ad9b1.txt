Eagle Street Pier ferry wharf was located on the northern side of the Brisbane River serving the Brisbane central business district in Queensland, Australia. It was served by Transdev Brisbane Ferries' CityHopper service and a cross-river service to Kangaroo Point (to the Holman Street and Thornton Street ferry terminals). These services were suspended in July 2020 and formally cancelled to stop at this wharf in October 2020.

History 
The area was operated by the Australasian Steam Navigation Company from the 1800s to the 1960s. The maritime industry then fell into decline and the structures were converted into carparking. The public ferry service at Eagle Street Pier commenced in 1989.

The wharf sustained moderate damage during the January 2011 Brisbane floods. It reopened after repairs on 14 February 2011.

The ferry wharf attached to the Eagle Street Pier waterfront complex, built in 1988. The popular site housed a range of retail commercial, and hospitality venues. It was demolished in 2023 and a new development is planned.
