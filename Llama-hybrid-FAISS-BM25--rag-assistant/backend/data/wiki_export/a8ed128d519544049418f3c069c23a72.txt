K with stroke (Ꝁ, ꝁ) is a letter of the Latin alphabet, derived from K with the addition of a bar through the letter.

It was used in Latin as an abbreviation for words that start with k. In Old Norse it was used for "konungr" (king) or to abbreviate the word "skulu" (shall) to "sꝁ".

It was also found in Latin alphabets of languages in the Soviet Union.
