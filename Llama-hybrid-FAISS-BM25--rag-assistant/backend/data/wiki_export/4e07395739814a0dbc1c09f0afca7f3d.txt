Lamontville Golden Arrows F.C. are a South African soccer club based in Durban that plays in the Premier Soccer League.

History
It was founded in 1943 in the streets of Lamontville, a township in Durban. The club played in the defunct National Professional Soccer League in the 1970s until they were relegated in 1976. They played in the Second Division thereafter until 1980 when they were embroiled in a soccer scandal and thrown out of the National Professional Soccer League.

The team was formed again in 1996 when the Madlala family bought the Second Division franchise of Ntokozo FC and changed its name to Lamontville Golden Arrows.

In 2000 they won promotion to the PSL by winning the National First Division Coastal Stream.

Arrows claimed their first piece of major silverware when they won the 2009 MTN 8, routing Ajax Cape Town 6–0 in the final played at Orlando Stadium.
