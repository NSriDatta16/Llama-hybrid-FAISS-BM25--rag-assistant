Durbanville is a town in the Western Cape province of South Africa, part of the greater Cape Town metropolitan area. Durbanville is a semi-rural residential suburb on the north-eastern outskirts of the metropolis surrounded by farms producing wine and wheat.

History
Precolonial period (before 1652)

The first modern humans indigenous to the Cape area included the Khoina and the Khoisan tribes. The indigenous people lived in the Cape and its surrounding coastal areas dating as far back as 60 000 years ago. They migrated from the interior of the country, what is today the Northern Cape province, and from Botswana and Namibia to the Cape.

Dutch colonial period (1652-1795)

Durbanville's inception can be traced to a fresh water spring located in the town. The spring is currently situated behind the Durbanville Children's Home. The spring was designated by the VOC (Dutch East India Company, Dutch: Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie) in the mid-1600s to be used as a water replenishment station for travelers on their way from Cape Town to the interior of southern Africa. In 1661 rhinoceros and ostrich were known to inhabit the area. Durbanville was originally known as Pampoenkraal (from the Afrikaans words pampoen meaning pumpkin, and kraal meaning corral - an enclosure for livestock). This name was attributed to the town because of a pumpkin patch which grew alongside a dam located behind the current Town Hall. Due to the natural spring, Pampoenkraal became a preferred resting place for travellers before continuing on their journey into the interior.

During the late 1600s, the VOC allocated farms to free burghers situated around the town. Some of those farms are still in existence today, many of which are renowned for their wine production. These include Bloemendal, Meerendal, Diemersdal and Altydgedacht.

British colonial period (1795-1902)

The first portions of land were earmarked as residential properties and allocated in 1806, signifying the start and development of Durbanville.

In 1825 a group of local farmers requested permission from Lord Charles Somerset (governor of the Cape Colony at that time) to build their own church. The Dutch Reformed Church was commenced in 1825 and inaugurated a year later on 6 August 1826. A small village grew between the church and the outspan (overnight stop). During 1836 the inhabitants of Pampoenkraal petitioned the Governor of the Cape Colony, Sir Benjamin d'Urban, for permission to rename the village D'Urban in his honour. Permission was duly granted and the new name persisted until 1886 when it was renamed to Durbanville in order to avoid confusion with Durban - a major port city in the east of South Africa.

Durbanville had its own court house, jail and magistrate from the 1870s and became a Magisterial District of Bellville. The court house complex still exists in altered form within the Rust-en-Vrede complex, originally erected in 1850. A village management board was established in 1897 and a municipality in 1901. The first mayor elected was John King.

The village grew rapidly after the turn of the 19th century and a local wagon industry developed. The King Brothers Wagon Works' used to be South Africa's biggest wagon works. At the turn of the century, it employed more than 200 men, which just about accounted for the entire village. 

Post-Apartheid (1994-) 

In 1996, Durbanville lost its municipal status and was dissolved into the Tygerberg Municipality along with Bellville, Parow and Goodwood as part of the transition in local government. As of 2000, Durbanville was amalgamated into the City of Cape Town Metropolitan Municipality and is effectively a suburb of the City of Cape Town. Although Durbanville is now part of the City of Cape Town it is still a town in its own right

Durbanville today 
Over the past years, Durbanville has seen considerable development in the greater area which has seen the town evolve from a rural area into a large middle-income residential area with a strong suburban character evident in its leafy neighbourhoods, parks, greenbelts and sophisticated infrastructure. 

Due to its location on edge of the metropolis, Durbanville has experienced a growing demand for secure country living, resulting in the development of a number of gated communities, the most prominent being Pinehurst Garden City, Graanendal and Clara Anna Fontein, which have caused much of the surrounding farmland to be absorbed into the town. As a result, Durbanville is now considered as one of the most sought-after addresses in the northern suburbs of Cape Town.

In spite of the influx of infrastructure and residential development in the area, Durbanville has consistently remained a residential area (compared to its neighbouring suburbs) and still strongly preserves its distinctly "semi-rural" and scenic feel, with a number of its suburbs still backing on vineyards, wheat farms and smallholdings.

Geography

Durbanville lies nestled between the Tygerberg Hills and the Koeberg Hills in the northern suburbs of Cape Town, approximately 28 kilometres (17.4 mi) from the city. The town has Bellville to the south, Brackenfell to the south-east and Kraaifontein to the east as its neighbours which have expanded to such an extent there is barely any green space left between these towns, while to the north and west of the town, the suburban area dissolves into the wine and wheat farms. The elevations of the area range from 100 m (328 ft) to 240 m (787 ft) in the south-western neighbourhood of Durbanville Hills.

Economy
With Durbanville as a peri-urban town, the urban economy largely based on retail, hospitality and real estate co-exists with the traditional rural economy largely based on agriculture and rural tourism. The rural economy continues to be a central part of the local economy with the main farming categories including viticulture, dairy and wheat. 

Durbanville also functions as a service hub to the surrounding rural and peri-urban population in Fisantekraal, Philadelphia and Klipheuwel which have close economic ties with the town.

Agriculture

Viticulture 
Durbanville is a wine-producing region forming part of the Durbanville Wine Valley, home to thirteen wine estates set on the Tygerberg Hills. Many of the wine estates offer wine tastings and fine dining restaurants too.

Durbanville is also well-known as the "Sauvignon Blanc Country" owing to the amount of sauvignon blanc produced in the wine valley which is favoured by winemakers for its cooler climate (by comparison to the Boland wine region) influenced by the winds of Table and False bays resulting in a different style of wine produced within the valley.

The picturesque hilly landscape of the Durbanville wine valley and its close proximity to Cape Town (roughly a 30 minute-drive) by comparison to the Paarl, Stellenbosch and Franschhoek winelands have made it an increasingly popular tourist destination among local residents and visitors.

Dairy 
Durbanville is home to the dairy farm ("Welgegund") of Fair Cape, one of the Western Cape's largest dairy producers, situated just north of Durbanville along Malanshoogte Road.

Retail

Central Business District

The arms, derived from those of Sir Benjamin d'Urban, were : Or, on a chevron between in chief two six-pointed stars Sable and in base a bunch of grapes proper, three garbs Or. In layman's term, the shield is gold and depicts, from top to bottom, two black six-pointed stars, a blue chevron bearing three golden sheaves of wheat, and a bunch of grapes.

The crest was a red sphinx charged with three golden rings, and the motto Sit nomine digna.
