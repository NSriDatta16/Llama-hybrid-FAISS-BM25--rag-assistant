Now I'm a Cowboy is the 1994 second album by British rock band the Auteurs. On 2 June 2014 Now I'm a Cowboy was reissued alongside After Murder Park and How I Learned to Love the Bootboys. The reissue features unreleased songs and liner notes written by Luke Haines. It was released through 3 Loop Music.

Background
The Auteurs released their debut studio album New Wave in early 1993, through Hut Records, a subsidiary of major label Virgin Records. It reached number 35 on the UK Albums Chart. Celloist James Banbury joined the band around this time, and by mid-1993, drummer Glenn Collins was replaced by Barny C. Rockford.

"Lenny Valentino" was released as the lead single in November 1993, followed by "Chinese Bakery" Promotion of Now I'm a Cowboy was stunted as a result of Haines breaking both of his ankles. "Lenny Valentino" was released to modern rock radio stations in the United States in June 1994.

Reception

Author Dave Thompson wrote in his book Alternative Rock (2000) that Lenny Valentino' says it all casual, camp, and knowing – the rest of the album simply follows in its semi-sordid wake and there's a sinister edge coming through which remains deliciously shocking long after the initial fission has faded."

In 2003, Mojo placed the album at number 40 on its list of the "Top 50 Eccentric Albums".
