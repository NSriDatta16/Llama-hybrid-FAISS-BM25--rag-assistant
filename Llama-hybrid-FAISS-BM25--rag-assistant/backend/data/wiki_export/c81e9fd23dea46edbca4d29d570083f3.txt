God Module is an American dark electronic band founded in 1999 from Orlando, Florida. Since 2006 they have been based out of Washington state. God Module is currently signed to Metropolis Records.

History
God Module was formed in 1999 by Jasyn Bangert and Andrew Ramirez. The band name was derived from an episode of The X-Files that dramatized a theory about a part of the human brain rumored to be responsible for mankind's belief in religion and the concept of God. The band's first album, Artificial, was released by Inception Records in 2000.

God Module has toured the US and North America frequently, touring almost yearly in the States since 2010, and have played festivals and short tours in Europe.

In 2017, Bangert and Andrew Pearson along with Patrick Hogan of Voicecoil recorded music under the name Hexheart. Hexheart released an album, Midnight On A Moonless Night, and the accompanying single for "A Thousand Times" on Metropolis Records.
