Auf Achse (, "on the road",  "on the axle") is a logistics-themed board game designed by Wolfgang Kramer and published in 1987 by FX Schmid.  The game won the Spiel des Jahres award.  In 1992, a junior edition was released; and in 1994 a rummy-like card game spinoff was released. In 2007 a revised edition was published by Schmidt Spiele.

In a 1990 interview, Kramer revealed that "Although it has sold very well, Auf Achse is not really one of my favourites."
