History
Kale means castle in Turkish and in antiquity the castle of Tabae (or Tabai, Taba Tabenon) stood high on a rock commanding a mountain pass (although there are many places called Tabae and it may be that this was simply the word for rock.) The castle was apparently built by the followers of Alexander the Great, and coinage was minted here in the Hellenistic and Roman periods.

The area remained under Byzantine rule until the beginning of the 12th century when it fell to the Seljuk Turks, who ruled until the late 13th century, when Seljuk power was weakened in the wake of Mongol invasion. The area was brought into the Ottoman Empire in 1424 by Murat II.
