The fourth metacarpal bone (metacarpal bone of the ring finger) is shorter and smaller than the third.

The base is small and quadrilateral; its superior surface presents two facets, a large one medially for articulation with the hamate, and a small one laterally for the capitate.

On the radial side are two oval facets, for articulation with the third metacarpal; and on the ulnar side a single concave facet, for the fifth metacarpal.

Clinical relevance
A shortened fourth metacarpal bone can be a symptom of Kallmann syndrome, a genetic condition which results in the failure to commence or the non-completion of puberty.
A short fourth metacarpal bone can also be found in Turner syndrome, a disorder involving sex chromosomes.

A fracture of the fourth and/or fifth metacarpal bones transverse neck secondary due to axial loading is known as a boxer's fracture.

Ossification
The ossification process begins in the shaft during prenatal life, and in the head between 11th and 37th months.
