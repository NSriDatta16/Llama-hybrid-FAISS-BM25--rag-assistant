Government Hazi Mohammad Mohsin College () (alternatively spelled Government Hazi Muhammad Mohsin College) is one of the renowned colleges of Bangladesh located in Chittagong, Bangladesh. Named after Muhammad Mohsin, a 19th-century philanthropist, it is one of the oldest educational institutions in the country, originally established in British India. It offers Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) (classes 11â€“12) in the national curriculum of Bangladesh coupled with bachelor's degree and master's degree in various disciplines in association with National University, Bangladesh.

History
Chittagong Madrasa was established in 1874 using a waqf donated by Muhammad Mohsin. In 1918, plans to improve education at the institution were developed and by 1927 it had gradually evolved into Islamic Intermediate College. Forty years later, a government-run higher secondary college was founded at the foot of the hill on which Islamic Intermediate College stood. On 20 July 1979, Hazi Muhammad Mohsin College came into existence when the two institutions merged.

Campus
The college has eight buildings which cover almost  of land. Two hostels situated to the west of the Administrative Building offer housing for one hundred students. Another hostel and the dean's residence are situated south of the Commerce Department Building. On top of a hill stands the college mosque.

One of the buildings is almost a century old. It is called Darul Adalat, and it was the first court of Chittagong under British colonial rule; the site may also have been fortified by Portuguese pirates in the 16th century. The locals refer to it the Portuguese Building due to its architectural style. Mohsin College (then Chittagong Madrasa) bought the hill, along with the building, for 30000 tk in 1879, and it remained central to the institution for many years, though by 2013 it had fallen into disrepair and was in danger of being demolished to make way for a library.
