Hamilton Central Collegiate in 1923. HCI moved in to Central High School of Commerce (established 1897) in 1950 and closed with building reused as an Sanford Avenue elementary school from 1985 to 2011.

Trustees 
The HWDSB consists of 11 trustees elected from wards across the City of Hamilton. These wards either match or are the combination of multiple municipal wards for council elections. Trustees are elected for a four-year term during each municipal election. The last election for trustees was held on October 22, 2018. The next election for trustees will be held on October 24, 2022.

The Chair of the Board, the Vice-Chair and the Honorary Treasurer are elected at the Inaugural meeting of the Board, and serve for one year. Trustees are officials, elected to serve parents, students, taxpayers and the school system. They are the link between communities and the school board, ensuring Hamilton public schools meet the diverse needs of students in their communities. Student trustees are elected by Grade 7-12 students to represent the interests of students during deliberations and decision making of the board.
