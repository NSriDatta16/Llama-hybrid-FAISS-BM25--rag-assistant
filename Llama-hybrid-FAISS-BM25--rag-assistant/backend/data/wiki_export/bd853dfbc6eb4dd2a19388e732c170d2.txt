EndSerenading is the second studio album by Mineral, released on August 25, 1998, after the band had broken up.

The album was noted for its overall softer and quieter sound in comparison to the band's former album, The Power of Failing, which featured much louder and more energetic pieces. Tensions rose among the band during recording, and after recording was completed, the band split up. Simpson and Gomez formed The Gloria Record, while McCarver and Wiley formed Imbroco.
