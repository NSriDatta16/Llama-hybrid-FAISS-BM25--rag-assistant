The omega meson () is a flavourless meson formed from a superposition of an up quark–antiquark and a down quark–antiquark pair. It is part of the vector meson nonet and mediates the nuclear force along with pions and rho mesons.

Properties 
The most common decay mode for the ω meson is  at 89.2±0.7%, followed by  at 8.34±0.26%.

The quark composition of the  meson can be thought of as a mix between ,  and  states, but it is very nearly a pure symmetric - state. This can be shown by deconstructing the wave function of the  into its component parts. We see that the  and  mesons are mixtures of the SU(3) wave functions as follows.

where
  is the nonet mixing angle,

 .

The mixing angle at which the components decouple completely can be calculated to be , which almost corresponds to the actual value calculated from the masses of 35°. Therefore, the  meson is nearly a pure symmetric - state.
