The Holland Society of New York is a historical and genealogical society founded in 1885 in New York City. Its primary goal is to gather and preserve information about the settlement and history of New Netherland, a Dutch colony in North America. The society focuses on researching and documenting the lives and experiences of the colony's inhabitants, shedding light on its political, social, and religious patterns. It supports genealogical research and publishes historical publications.

The Holland Society is known for initiating projects such as the New Netherland Project, which translates and publishes 17th-century records from the New York State Archives. The society also sponsors projects like The Papers of Jacob Leisler Project and Records of the Translations of the Reformed Protestant Dutch Church of Flatbush, Kings County, New York. Its motto, Eindelijk wordt een Spruit een Boom ("Finally, a sprout becomes a tree"), reflects its commitment to preserving Dutch heritage.

Membership in the society is open to both males and females, who are directly descended from an ancestor who lived in New Netherland before or during 1675. The society boasts notable members such as Cecil B. DeMille, Humphrey Bogart, Theodore Roosevelt, and Franklin D. Roosevelt, who served as a Trustee during his tenure as Governor of New York.

One of the society's significant events is the Annual Banquet, where contributions made by individuals of Dutch descent are recognized and celebrated. Past honorees include Henry Fonda, Gloria Vanderbilt, astronaut Jerry L. Ross, and Theodore Roosevelt.

The Holland Society's library is a valuable resource for those interested in New Netherland studies, particularly genealogy and family history. The library holds approximately 7,000 books, including local histories, family histories, genealogies, and reference materials. It also features a comprehensive collection of vertical files containing letters, photographs, genealogies, and press clippings. The society's publications are available in the library, and copies of early church records provide information on births, marriages, and deaths in New Netherland. The library subscribes to publications from historical and genealogical societies, gathering newsletters from family organizations with New Netherland ancestry. Although the collection primarily focuses on New Amsterdam and Hudson River settlements, it also covers early Dutch and allied migrations in North America.

The Holland Society's library is located within the New York State Library in Albany. Public access is available by appointment with the office.
