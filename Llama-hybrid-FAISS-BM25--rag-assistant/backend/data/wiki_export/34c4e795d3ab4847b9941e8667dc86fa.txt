The lake sits at an elevation of  above sea level, high up in the Setesdalsheiene mountains, just north of the mountains Urevassnutene and Djuptj√∏nnuten and just west of Snjoheinuten.  

The northeastern arm of the lake has a dam on it which leads to a canal that brings the out-flowing water to the nearby lake Vatndalsvatnet.

The lake has large populations of brook trout and brown trout, which makes it a popular fishing location.
