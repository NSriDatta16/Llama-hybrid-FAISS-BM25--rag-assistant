Background
Al-Rasheed was born in Paris to a Saudi father and a Lebanese mother. Her father descends from the Rashidi dynasty. Shortly after her birth, the family moved to Saudi Arabia, where al-Rasheed grew up.

In 1975, King Faisal of Saudi Arabia was assassinated by his nephew, Faisal bin Musaid. His mother was a sister of al-Rasheed's father, and the Saudi government accused the Rashidi family of being behind the assassination. Further investigation found this to be untrue, but in 1975, al-Rasheed's family moved to Lebanon, where al‐Rasheed finished her baccalaureate in 1981. She then started her studies in anthropology and sociology at the American University of Beirut.

In 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon. Al-Rasheed went into exile a second time, to the UK, first to Salford University, then to the University of Cambridge, where she obtained her PhD with Ernest Gellner as her supervisor.

In 2005, after an appearance on Al Jazeera TV criticizing the Saudi government, Salman of Saudi Arabia, at the time the governor of Riyadh province, who later became king of Saudi Arabia, telephoned al-Rasheed's father, claiming that her Saudi citizenship was withdrawn as punishment for her television appearance.

Al-Rasheed was one of the targets in the so-called Pegasus spyware scandal, but the attack on her device was apparently unsuccessful.

Recognition
Al-Rasheed was recognized as one of the BBC's 100 women of 2013.
