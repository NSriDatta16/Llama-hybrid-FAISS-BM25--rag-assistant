The Swedish Free Church Council () is an association of free churches in Sweden. It is part of the Christian Council of Sweden () . The Swedish Free Church Council was established in 1992.

In total the member churches have about 250,000 members, with almost double that figure involved in the churches' activities. The largest member church is the Uniting Church in Sweden, with approximately 85,000 members.

The free churches belong to various Protestant denominations: Baptists, Methodists, Reformed, Pentecostal etc. Most of the free church denominations in Sweden began during the nineteenth century when an evangelical revival broke out. The Swedish free church family has many branches, often quite different, but united in the common bond of the necessity of a personal faith.
