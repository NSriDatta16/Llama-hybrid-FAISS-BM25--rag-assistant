Anangeon (, "necessary"), also known as dicaeologia (, "a plea in defense"), is a specious method of argument, in which the basis lies in inevitability or necessity. For example, "Yes, I missed school today, but I was sick and wouldn't have learned anything anyway," is an argument that ignores the need to go to school, mitigating the controversy of not going.  It is used to limit or contradict fault in a matter.

Anangeon can be seen as a part of logos and is a type of non sequitur.
