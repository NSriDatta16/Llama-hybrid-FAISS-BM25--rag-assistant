Peter Tsou has been employed as a principal science staff member at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) of the California Institute of Technology for the past 34 years. His research primarily centers around the utilization of aerogel in space exploration.

Tsou has served as the principal investigator (PI) for several missions conducted on the Space Shuttle and Mir, during which he devised the method of intact capture for hypervelocity particles. He gained recognition for his involvement in the capture and retrieval of cometary particles through NASA's Stardust mission, where he served as the deputy PI.

Education
Tsou completed his undergraduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley, where he obtained a B.S. degree in electrical engineering in 1965, followed by an M.S. degree in the same field in 1966. In 1972, he obtained his Ph.D. in large-scale engineering systems from the University of California, Los Angeles.

Career

Since 1974, Tsou has been employed at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, CA. Currently, he holds the position of Deputy Principal Investigator for the STARDUST mission, a role he has held since 1994. Tsou has also served as principal investigator for various projects, including the MIR Sample Return Experiment (1994–1997), the Spacehab II Sample Return Experiment, and the Get Away Special Sample Return Experiment (1989–present). He has held several managerial and engineering positions at JPL, including STARDUST proposal manager (1992–1994), instrument definition manager (1984–1990), spacecraft system engineer (1982–1990), task manager for the Low-Cost Solar Array program (1975–1980), and system engineer (1974–1975).

Research
Dr. Tsou's research focus has primarily been on the retrieval of cometary samples. He is credited with inventing the method of capturing hypervelocity particles intact, which has been instrumental in missions such as Stardust. Collaborating with scientists from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, he contributed to the development of a lighter aerogel specifically designed for capturing cometary particles. Additionally, he played a significant role in introducing aerogel as a flight-qualified variable density material and capture medium for space missions.

Furthermore, Dr. Tsou has made notable contributions to the field of space thermal insulation by inventing an integrated aerogel thermal-structural design for the Mars Pathfinder Sojourner rover.

His research interests extend to investigating the potential exobiological effects of extraterrestrial bodies and exploring methods to retrieve samples of materials from other planets.
