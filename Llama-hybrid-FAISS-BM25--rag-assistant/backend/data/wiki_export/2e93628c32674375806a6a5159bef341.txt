Neil Robert Fuller, OAM (born 2 August 1969 in Shoreham by Sea, Sussex)  is an Australian athlete, Paralympic competitor, and amputee.

During his youth, Neil was an ambitious soccer player, gaining a position playing at state level for South Australia. It was during a soccer match on 25 July 1987 that his tibia and fibula were broken, and a major artery in his right leg was severed in an attempted tackle to the shin. Legally
becoming an adult during his 22 days in hospital, he opted to have the lower part of his right leg amputated after gangrene had set in.

In February 1989, Fuller entered the Amputee Nationals in Adelaide in the 100m race, long jump and high jump. Fuller was then selected as a member of the Australian team to compete at the Far East and South Pacific International Championships where he competed in the 100m, long jump, high jump and the pentathlon.

After the accident, Fuller made a comeback into the world of sports becoming a world class runner and world record holder.
