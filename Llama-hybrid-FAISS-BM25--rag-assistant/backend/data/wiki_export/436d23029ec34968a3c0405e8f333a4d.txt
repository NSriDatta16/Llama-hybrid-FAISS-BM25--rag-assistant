History
The original Cape Henlopen High School opened in 1969. It was a combination of three area schools that housed their high school grade levels with other grades: Rehoboth School, Lewes School, and Milton School. Initially school was held at the former Lewes High School.

The district began construction of a new building to house Cape Henlopen High School in 1974. In September 1976, the new Cape Henlopen High School opened on Kings Hwy. The school was a model of 1970s architecture and echoed the educational sentiment of the day that called for minimal distraction in a classroom.  The school's very few windows were positioned in places where it would be difficult for students to gaze out of them during classroom time. It was possible for a student to enter the building at the beginning of the school day and not see the sunshine again until he or she left at the end of the school day.  Over time the sentiments of educators changed, and, because the school was showing its age, when construction began on the new school (located on the same property of the current school) in 2007, the decision was made to make it as bright a place as possible.

Construction of the new school was completed in the fall of 2009. The new Cape Henlopen High School incorporates energy-efficient materials and state-of-the-art technology. It also incorporates a separate 9th-grade academy and vocational wing, eliminating the use of the Ninth Grade Campus building. The main building's design relies heavily on the school colors, with walls being painted to match the colors. The floor tiles are adorned with the blue and gold. The exterior is primary brick. The gymnasium features a wooden floor with blue decorations and “Vikings” written at each end. The large bleachers have “CAPE” painted onto them. The school's expansive library features a high rising ceiling with modern light fixtures and coves cut into the wall for students to sit and read.  The cafeteria has a high rising ceiling. multiple TV's display pertinent information to students. On the wall above the cafeteria's exit is multiple clocks showing times from other capes around the world including Cape Town

It was announced during the 2018–19 school year that an addition would be placed on the school. The addition is to have two stories, with a commons to span both stories. The new number of classrooms ranging 20-21 based on how many classrooms the funds can obtain. A skylight was to be installed. The school board approved it in 2018. The plans were announced during the 2018 referendum. The addition is complete and located on the Kings Highway side of the building. It would result in an additional capacity of about 450 students. New features include a UN-style classrooms, 6 dedicated consortium classrooms, access corridors from the ninth grade wing, and an additional courtyard. The addition follows the same exterior architecture as the main campus. The addition also adds an extension to the cafeteria that has been completed. Groundbreaking occurred in 2019.
During the 2021-22 school year the wing would open, serving as a “Freshman” wing. Most students refer to it as the “J Wing” because all room numbers start with a J. 

The additions architecture follows the main building with an extreme modern twist. The first floor common area features a massive mural composing pictures of local landmarks all tinted blue. All of the new classrooms feature new desk and chairs. The bathrooms have some of the fanciest features. Including sinks, with soap dispensers, a faucet, and a dryer all built into one. The addition provided space for a secondary courtyard with a stage.
