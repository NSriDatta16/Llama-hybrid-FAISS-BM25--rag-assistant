Patrik Sjöland (born 13 May 1971) is a Swedish professional golfer.

Early life
Sjöland was born in Borås.

Professional career
He turned professional in 1990 and after several season on the second tier Challenge Tour, graduated to the European Tour for the start of the 1996 season. His most successful year by far was 1998, when he finished 5th on the European Tour Order of Merit and featured in the top 50 of the Official World Golf Rankings. After a poor 2005 season, during which he slipped outside the top 100 on the Order of Merit and lost his European Tour card, he took a break from the tour, playing just two tournaments in 2006.

Sjöland secured a return to the European Tour at the end of season qualifying school season in 2006. He was unable to regain his early career form during 2007 and returned to qualifying school at the end of the year where he again regained his card, helped by a holed 7 iron for eagle during the final round. Having again missed out on retaining his card again in 2008, he was not able to repeat the trick and would have limited opportunities in 2009.

Sjöland has won twice on the European Tour, the first title coming in the 1998 Italian Open and the second in the 2000 Irish Open. He has won several other tournaments around the world, including the 1999 Hong Kong Open.
