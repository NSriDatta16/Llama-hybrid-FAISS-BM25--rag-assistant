Minot High School (MHS) is a public high school in Minot, North Dakota, divided between two main campuses: Magic City (1974, grades 11–12) and Central (1918, grades 9–10). The enrollment is among the largest in the state, drawing from the entire city as well as Minot Air Force Base. MHS also includes an alternative campus: Souris River Campus.

Athletics
The boys' athletic teams are known as the "Magicians" or "Magi", while the girls' teams are called the "Majettes". The school's mascot is a magician and the varsity teams compete against the largest high schools in the state in Class A (Class AAA for football, see North Dakota High School Activities Association).

Minot is known as the "Magic City" because of its rapid development in 1886, after the arrival of the Great Northern railroad.
