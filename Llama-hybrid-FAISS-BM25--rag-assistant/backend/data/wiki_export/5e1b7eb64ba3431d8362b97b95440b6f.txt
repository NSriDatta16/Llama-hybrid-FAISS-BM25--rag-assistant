Corydoras narcissus, commonly known as the long nosed arched cory, is a freshwater fish belonging to the Corydoradinae subfamily of the family Callichthyidae, native to the Madeira and Purus river basins in Amazonian Brazil. It has a longer, more concave ("saddle-shaped") nose, but its color pattern resembles that also seen in a few other Corydoras species (for example, C. arcuatus, C. bethanae, C. granti and C. urucu) from the western Amazon basin, as well as Brachyrhamdia thayeria; they all have spiny fins with a (to humans) painful but not dangerous venom and their similarity is an example of Müllerian mimicry. C. narcissus generally is an uncommon species in its range.

C. narcissus is large for a Corydoras and may reach up to  in standard length. It feeds on worms, small crustaceans, insects, and plant matter.  It lays eggs in dense vegetation, and adults do not guard the eggs. Unlike most Corydoras species but similar to the other "saddlenoses", C. narcissus tend to occur in small groups (not larger groups) and especially during the breeding period mature males are quite aggressive towards each other.

The species was first collected by Herbert R. Axelrod and Martin R. Brittan. It was first described and named narcissus by Han Nijssen and Isaäc J. H. Isbrücker to recognize the collectors "for their many naming suggestions".
