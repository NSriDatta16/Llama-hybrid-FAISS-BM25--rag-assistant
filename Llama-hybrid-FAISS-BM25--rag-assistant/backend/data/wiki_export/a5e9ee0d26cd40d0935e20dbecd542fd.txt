Features
Bački Monoštor is located on a small peninsula surrounded by the Danube backwaters and channels that can be reached only by passing over the bridges - hence the name "Village on the 7 Danube." A bridge is placed at the entrance to the village from the direction of Sombor - the so-called "Pislin bridge" which is on the Grand Bačka Canal, the other is at the entrance to the village from the direction of Bezdan - pontoon bridge, also over the Grand Canal and the third is placed at the southwestern side of the village over Canal Danube-Tisa-Danube, so called "Gypsy bridge" that connects Bački Monoštor with his woods and cottage settlements. Previously, there was another bridge in the district near monoštorski road to Sombor, set over the Grand Canal which connected the former estates and farms to the main road, but was destroyed during World War II.
