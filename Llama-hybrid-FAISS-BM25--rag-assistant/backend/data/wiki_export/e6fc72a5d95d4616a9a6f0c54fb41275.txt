Holy Family High School in Broomfield, Colorado, is a Roman Catholic college-preparatory high school located in the technology corridor between Denver and Boulder. The school is operated under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Denver.

History
Holy Family High School was established in 1922 as a parish high school. The first commencement was held in 1926. Staffed by the Sisters of Loretto and dedicated lay teachers, the school added a second building in 1956 to meet the demands of increasing enrollment.

In 1958 Holy Family changed its affiliation from a parish high school to an archdiocesan secondary school and was one of four Catholic high schools to serve the urban geographical region of North Denver. By the 1980s it was apparent that expansion to a new location was essential to continue its mission of educating young men and women. A  site was secured by the school and the Archdiocese of Denver and the groundbreaking was held in March 1998. The doors to the new campus building were opened in August 1999 in sprawling Broomfield, Colorado. The new facility features a chapel, 22 classrooms, four science laboratories, a multimedia library, a wireless network, two technology centers, athletic practice and playing fields, and the lighted Mike G. Gabriel football stadium.

In 2008, a new larger than life statue of the Holy Family was dedicated. In 2020 Holy Family added a 34,000 sq ft. addition including Engineering rooms, classrooms, a new Auxiliary gym, and renovated many of its other facilities. Holy Family has 65 faculty members, giving the school a 11:1 student/faculty ratio. Over 75% of the faculty holds a Master's or other advanced degrees. Over $1 million of tuition assistance and scholarships were awarded for the 2020-2021 school year. (42% of the student body).
