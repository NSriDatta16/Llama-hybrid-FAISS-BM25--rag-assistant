The Kimber Eclipse is a model 1911 semi-automatic pistol chambered for the .45 ACP and 10mm Auto cartridges. It is made by Kimber Manufacturing in Yonkers, New York.  There are several models of Kimber Eclipse, of different sizes and with different combinations of features.

Features

It has front and back strap checkering, and rear and forward cocking serrations on the slide.

The stainless steel slide and frame are finished in a matte black oxide, then all flat surfaces are brush polished, leaving the recessed and curved surfaces dark and contrasting.
