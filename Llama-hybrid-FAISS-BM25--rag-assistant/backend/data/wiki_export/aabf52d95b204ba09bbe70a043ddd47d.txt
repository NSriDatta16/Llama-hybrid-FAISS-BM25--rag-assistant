The Bishopp Baronetcy, of Parham in the County of Sussex, was a baronetcy in the Baronetage of England. From around 1780 the name was sometimes also spelled Bisshopp. It was created 24 July 1620 for Sir Thomas Bishopp who had previously represented Gatton in Parliament. He was by then almost 70 years old and who had earlier been created a knight by King James I on 7 May 1603 at Theobalds, shortly after James's accession to the throne. Thomas Bishopp was the son of Thomas Bishopp and Elizabeth Belknap, heir and daughter of Sir Edward Belknap, who was active in the service of the English crown, both on the battlefield and as a court official.

The second Baronet sat as Member of Parliament for Steyning and Bramber. The fourth Baronet was Member of Parliament for Bramber. The sixth Baronet represented Penrhyn and Boroughbridge in Parliament. The eighth Baronet was Member of Parliament for New Shoreham. In 1815 the abeyance of the ancient Barony of Zouche was terminated in his favour, as a descendant through his mother from the Honourable Elizabeth la Zouche, eldest daughter of Edward la Zouche, 11th Baron Zouche, on whose death in 1625 the barony had fallen into abeyance. However, on Lord Zouche's death in 1828 the Barony once again fell into abeyance while he was succeeded in the baronetcy (but not the family estate at Parham) by his cousin. The title became extinct on the death of the twelfth Baronet in 1870.

The second son of the first Baronet Henry Bishopp, (1611–1691), was a Postmaster General of England and inventor of the first postmark used on mail.
