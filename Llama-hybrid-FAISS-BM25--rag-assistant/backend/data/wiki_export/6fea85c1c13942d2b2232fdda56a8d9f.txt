Georg Rörer (Latin: Georgius Rorarius) (1 October 1492, Deggendorf – 24 April 1557 Jena) was a German Lutheran theologian, clergyman and Protestant reformer.

Georg Rörer began his studies at Leipzig University in 1511.  He was awarded his Magister in 1520. From 1522, he continued his studies at the University of Wittenberg, where he met Martin Luther, Philipp Melanchthon and Johannes Bugenhagen. He was one of the first clergymen ordained to the office of deacon by Martin Luther in 1525.

He assisted as proof-reader in Martin Luther's work of translating the Bible (1522–1545) into the German language.  He also served as Luther's secretary. In 1537, John Frederick I, Elector of Saxony exempted him from his ecclesiastical duties and officially commissioned him to work with the documentation of Luther's work. In this capacity, Rörer became one of the editors of Luther's Tischreden ("table talk") as well as a collected edition of Luther's works. He moved to Copenhagen in 1551 and to Halle in 1553.
