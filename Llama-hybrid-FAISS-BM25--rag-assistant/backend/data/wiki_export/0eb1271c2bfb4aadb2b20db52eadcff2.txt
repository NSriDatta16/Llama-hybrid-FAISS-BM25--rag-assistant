A Site of Special Scientific Interest () or SSSI is a special area to protect wildlife, habitats and geographic features based on scientific interest in Hong Kong. Scientific interests are special features relating to animal life, plant life, geology and/or geography. After being identified by the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, these areas are documented by the Planning Department and added to maps. From 1975 to 2005, 67 locations were designated SSSIs throughout Hong Kong.
