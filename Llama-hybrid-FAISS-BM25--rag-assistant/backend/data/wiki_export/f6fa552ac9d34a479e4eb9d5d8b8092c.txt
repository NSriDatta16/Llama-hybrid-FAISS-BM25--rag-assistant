A Work in Progress is a Neil Peart DVD, documenting the "work in progress" of recording Rush's Test for Echo album, as well as an extensive discussion of the fundamental reinvention of Peart's percussion technique by the tutelage of the expert Freddie Gruber. Neil's special approach to drums is featured in various individual songs from Test for Echo. Other topics include a discussion of Neil's DW drumset, his approach to odd times, playing with a vocalist, and a "guided tour" of Neil's warmup routine.
