Gladstone Secondary School is a public secondary school located in the Kensington-Cedar Cottage neighbourhood in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.  It is named after William Ewart Gladstone, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom four times between 1868 and 1894.

History
Gladstone is built on property that was once an old farm. The location was designated for a school in the late 1920s, but because of the Great Depression and Second World War, construction did not begin until 1949.

Gladstone opened as a junior high school in 1950 with an enrollment of 1376 students. Mr. D.B. Mackenzie, who was Gladstone's first principal, opened the sliding gym doors to symbolize the opening of the school at a ceremony attended by all staff members and students.
From the opening year in 1950, Gladstone added a grade each year until the first class graduated in 1954. Since then, many students have been through Gladstone's doors.

Current
Gladstone is a school of approximately 950 students from grades 8-12. The students participate in many extracurricular activities, including clubs and sports teams.

Sports 
Gladstone is well known for its successful sports teams (e.g. Volleyball, Basketball, Badminton). and its participation in competitions related to engineering (Electrathon, Robotics). Gladstone's Fine Arts department is also highly regarded, with especially strong Music, Drama, and Dance programs.

Gladstone is a participant in the Think & Eat Green @ School program, designed to enrich student knowledge of sustainable food practices. Gladstone's focus in this project is on the redesign and infrastructural change to the kitchen and cafeteria. Gladstone was also featured in Season 1, Episode 7 of 21 Jump Street.

Gladstone has a diverse array of academic courses and programs that provide students with a range of educational options for them to pursue.
