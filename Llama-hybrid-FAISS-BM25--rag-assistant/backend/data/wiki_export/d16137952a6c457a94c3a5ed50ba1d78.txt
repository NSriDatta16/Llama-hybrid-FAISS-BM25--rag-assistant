The Cotton Exchange, Karachi is located in Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan. It is the largest cotton trading exchange in Pakistan.

History
Founded in 1933, it is the oldest commodity exchange in Pakistan.

Building
The exterior of the structure has remained intact over time. The fa√ßade is as beautiful as it was when it was initially built. There are small indications of wear and tear, but the interiors have not changed considerably. The unchanged furnishings, slow-moving ceiling fans, and historic portraits that adorn the building's walls preserve its authenticity.
