The Green Party of New York is the affiliate of the Green Party of the United States in the U.S. state of New York. It was founded in 1992 and is a part of the Green Party movement. The Party has had ballot access at various points in its history. It regained ballot status for four years when Howie Hawkins received over 50,000 votes in the 2010 gubernatorial election and retained it for another four years in the 2014 election, when the party moved up to line D, the fourth line on state ballots, passing the Working Families and Independence parties, with 5 percent of the vote. It lost its status as a ballot-qualified political party in New York as of November 2020 when the law governing ballot access was changed requiring a larger number of votes in the Presidential and Gubernatorial elections.

History
The Green Party of New York had its roots in local Green organizing of the mid-1980s. In 1998 the Green Party in New York achieved ballot status when its candidate for governor, Al Lewis, received over 50,000 votes. Ralph Nader received 244,030 votes for President on the Green Party line in 2000. As provided under electoral law, the party formed a State Committee, several County Committees, and set up county organizations. The party lost ballot status in 2002, when gubernatorial candidate Stanley Aronowitz received 41,727 votes, fewer than the 50,000 votes required.

From 2003 to 2004 the Green Party had a city council majority (3 of 5 seats), in the Village of New Paltz. This was the third-ever Green city council majority in the United States. New Paltz also elected a Green mayor Jason West in 2003.

The party's petition for the 2004 Presidential election was successfully challenged, and no Green Party candidate appeared on the ballot in 2004. National Green Party nominee David Cobb received 138 votes in New York as a write-in candidate. Meanwhile, Nader received 99,873 votes, appearing on the "Peace and Justice Party" and the "Independence Party" ballot lines.

In the 2006 election, the party nominated Malachy McCourt for governor and failed to obtain ballot status by garnering only 40,729 votes, less than the required 50,000.  Down-ticket candidates Rachel Treichler for Attorney General and Julia Willebrand for Comptroller fared better, but these votes do not count towards earning ballot status, and neither of these candidates were elected. The party also nominated Howie Hawkins for Senate who criticized incumbent Democrat Hillary Clinton for, among other things, supporting the Iraq War.
