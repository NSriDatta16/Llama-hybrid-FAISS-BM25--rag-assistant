Major league career

1970s

Cleveland Indians (1975-76)
Cerone was drafted by the Cleveland Indians with the seventh overall pick in the first round of the 1975 MLB Draft.  He made his MLB debut on August 17, 1975, pinch hitting for first baseman Boog Powell in the top of the ninth inning in a 14â€“5 win over the Minnesota Twins, as he lined out.  Cerone then replaced catcher Alan Ashby in the bottom of the ninth. On August 22, Cerone collected his first career hit, a single off Paul Splittorff of the Kansas City Royals. Overall, he finished the season playing in seven games with the Indians, batting .250.

Cerone saw little action again with the Indians in 1976, hitting .125 with an RBI in seven games with the club. On December 6, the Indians traded Cerone and John Lowenstein to the Toronto Blue Jays for Rico Carty.

Toronto Blue Jays (1977-79)
Cerone joined the Toronto Blue Jays for their expansion season in 1977, and was the starting catcher for their first game on April 7, in which he had two hits in their 9-5 victory over the Chicago White Sox. On August 17, Cerone hit his first career home run off Nelson Briles of the Texas Rangers. Overall, Cerone played in 31 games with Toronto, hitting .200 with a home run and ten RBI.

After the season, the Blue Jays and the New York Yankees completed a trade which sent Cerone, Tom Underwood and Ted Wilborn to the Yankees for Damaso Garcia, Chris Chambliss and Paul Mirabella.

1980s

New York Yankees (1980-84)
Cerone joined the New York Yankees for the 1980 season, following the death of catcher Thurman Munson the year before.  In his first season with the Yankees, Cerone batted .277 with 14 home runs and 85 RBI in 147 games, and finished seventh in American League MVP voting, as he helped New York win the American League East division and qualify for the playoffs.  Defensively, Cerone led the American League as he threw out 57 attempted stolen base attempts, which was a league best 51.8%.  In his first playoffs, Cerone hit .333 with a home run and two RBI, however, the Yankees were swept by the Kansas City Royals in three games.

Cerone's production dipped in the 1981 season, as he hit .244 with two home runs and 21 RBI in 71 games. He told the Associated Press in October he had been getting threatening telegrams and phone calls for over a month, forcing him to change his phone number. However, the Yankees reached the post-season once again.  After a tough loss in Game 3 of the American League Divisional Series (ALDS) against the Milwaukee Brewers, Yankee owner George Steinbrenner accused the team of showing him up and not playing well. Cerone swore at Steinbrenner, who responded, "You're gone next year. Nobody talks to me that way." Cerone left the room, returned, and shouted, "What do you know about it? You never played this game!" Steinbrenner's only response was a glare. In the playoffs, Cerone hit .333 with a home run and five RBI in the Yankees victory over the Brewers in the ALDS.  In the American League Championship Series against the Oakland Athletics, Cerone struggled with a .100 batting average, however, the Yankees won the series and reached the 1981 World Series.  In the World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, Cerone hit .190 with a home run and three RBI, as the Yankees lost to Los Angeles in six games.

Despite Steinbrenner's threat, Cerone remained with the Yankees in 1982. He split his playing time with Butch Wynegar, as he appeared in 89 games, hitting .227 with five home runs and 28 RBI, as the Yankees failed to make the playoffs.  Cerone's production continued to drop in 1983, as he hit .220 with two homers and 22 RBI in 80 games.  In 1984, Cerone became the backup catcher to Wynegar, appearing in only 38 games, batting .208 with two home runs and 13 RBI.  On November 5, the Yankees traded Cerone to the Atlanta Braves for Brian Fisher.

In 1988, the Yankees designated Joel Skinner as their starting catcher and released Cerone on April 4, before the season, in favor of Don Slaught, who was expected to provide more offense as a backup.

Boston Red Sox (1988-89)
Not initially getting much interest from teams, Cerone was considering other jobs after his release by the Yankees, even interviewing with WABC for an advertising sales position. However, he signed with the Boston Red Sox on April 15, 1988, and in 84 games with the Red Sox, Cerone had a .269 batting average with three homers and 27 RBI, as he and Rich Gedman shared the catching duties.

He returned to the Red Sox for the 1989 season, as Cerone hit .243 with four home runs and 48 RBI in 102 games with Boston, however, the Red Sox fell short in making the post-season.  On December 19, Boston released Cerone.

On December 20, 1989, one day after being released by the Boston Red Sox, Cerone rejoined the Yankees for a third time, as he signed a two-year contract with the club as a free agent.
