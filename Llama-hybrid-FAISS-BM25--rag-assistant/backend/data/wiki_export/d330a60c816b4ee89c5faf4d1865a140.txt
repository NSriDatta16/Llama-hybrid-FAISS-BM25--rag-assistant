The University of the Philippines Madrigal Singers (UPMS), also known as the Philippine Madrigal Singers or simply Madz, is one of the major choral groups based in the University of the Philippines, Diliman.  Its current conductor, musical director, and choirmaster is Mark Anthony A. Carpio. The Madz is the first choir to win the European Grand Prix for Choral Singing (EGP) twice (in 1997 and in 2007).

History 

The Philippine Madrigal Singers, also known as the "Madz", was founded in 1963 by National Artist for Music, Professor Andrea O. Veneracion. Most of the members are associated with the University of the Philippines.

The ensemble performs a wide repertoire of various styles and forms: renaissance music, classical music, Filipino and international folksongs, contemporary and avant-garde music, opera, and even popular music. Their specialization and focus on the Madrigal, a polyphonic and challenging musical style popular during the Renaissance period where singers and guests would gather around the table during a banquet to sight-sing and make music together. This served as the inspiration for their unique style of singing – singing seated in a semicircle without a conductor.

As a Philippine ambassador of culture and goodwill, the Madz has given command performances for royalty and heads of state.  These include Pope Paul VI, Pope John Paul II, Pope Francis, United States Presidents Gerald Ford, Richard Nixon, Barack Obama, Queen Sofia of Spain, King Juan Carlos I of Spain, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew Chinese President Hu Jintao.

As resident artists of the Cultural Center of the Philippines, the group has performed in outreach concerts in far-flung areas seldom reached by most performing artists.

The group is presently under the leadership of Madz alumnus Mark Anthony A. Carpio.
