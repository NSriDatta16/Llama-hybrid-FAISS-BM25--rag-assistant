Dehl Berti (January 17, 1921 – November 26, 1991) was a Chiricahua Apache actor who often appeared in Westerns. One of his more recognized roles was as John Taylor on the 1988–1991 CBS western television series, Paradise, starring Lee Horsley as the reformed gunfighter Ethan Allen Cord.

A native of Pueblo, Colorado, of Apache descent, he married Francis Cummins Collins in 1944. 

Berti appeared in guest-starring roles on many television programs from the 1950s through the 1980s, primarily in westerns such as Bonanza, Bat Masterson and Gunsmoke, but in other roles as well. In 1960, Berti appeared as Joe Maybe on Cheyenne in the episode titled "The Long Rope."  In 1963, he played the Indian, Little Buffalo, in the episode "The Day of the Flying Dutchman" on ABC's western series, The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters, starring child actor Kurt Russell. In 1982, he costarred as One Feather on the short-lived NBC drama series Born to the Wind.

Berti's final appearance was on a 1990 episode of the sitcom, Saved by the Bell. Since 1982, Berti can be heard as the voice of Chief Joseph of the Nez Perce in The American Adventure at Walt Disney World's Epcot Center in Florida.

Berti died of a heart attack in Los Angeles, California, on November 26, 1991, at the age of 70. He is interred there at Oakwood Memorial Park Cemetery.
