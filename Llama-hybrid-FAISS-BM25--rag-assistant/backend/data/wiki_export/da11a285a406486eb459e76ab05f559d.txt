A Buyer's Market is the second novel in Anthony Powell's twelve-novel series A Dance to the Music of Time. Published in 1952, it continues the story of narrator Nick Jenkins with his introduction into society after boarding school and university.

The book presents new characters, notably the painter Mr. Deacon, female acquaintance Gypsy Jones and artist Ralph Barnby, as well as reappearances by Jenkins' school friends Peter Templer, Charles Stringham and Kenneth Widmerpool. The action takes place in London high society in the late 1920s. At a dinner party there is discussion of the Earl Haig statue.

After the dinner party Jenkins and Widmerpool meet Mr. Deacon and Gypsy Jones and Charles Stringham at a coffee stall on the street. The group then goes together to a party at the home of Milly Andriadis. 

At the party Nick meets his former professor, Sillery, and observes industrialist Magnus Donners. Prince Theodoric, Baby Wentworth and Bijou Ardglass are also at the party. 

In the summer Nick visits the castle of industrialist Donners, who employs both Stringham and Widmerpool.

A Buyer's Market is dedicated to Sir Osbert Lancaster and first wife, Karen.
