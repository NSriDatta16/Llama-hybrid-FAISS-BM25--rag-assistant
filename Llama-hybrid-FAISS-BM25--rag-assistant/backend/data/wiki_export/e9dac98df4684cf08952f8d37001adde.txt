Georgia's 5th congressional district is a congressional district in the U.S. state of Georgia. The district was represented by Democrat John Lewis from January 3, 1987, until his death on July 17, 2020. Kwanza Hall was elected to replace Lewis on December 1, 2020, and served until January 3, 2021, when Nikema Williams took his place. Hall was elected in a special election for the balance of Lewis' 17th term. He chose not to run in the general election for a full two-year term, which was won by Williams. 

The district's boundaries were redrawn following the 2010 census, which granted an additional congressional seat to Georgia. The first election using the new district boundaries (listed below) were the 2012 congressional elections.

Based in central Fulton and parts of DeKalb and Clayton counties, the majority black district includes almost three-fourths of Atlanta, the state capital and largest city. It also includes some of the surrounding suburbs, including East Point, Druid Hills, and Forest Park. With a Cook Partisan Voting Index rating of D+32, it is the most Democratic district in Georgia.
