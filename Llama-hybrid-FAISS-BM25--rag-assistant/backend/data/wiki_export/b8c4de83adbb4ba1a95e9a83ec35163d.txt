Innocent passage is a concept in the law of the sea that allows for a vessel to pass through the archipelagic and territorial waters of another state, subject to certain restrictions. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea Article 19 defines innocent passage as:

Innocent passage concedes the coastal country's territorial sea claim, unlike freedom of navigation, which directly contests it.

History
Initially, the right of innocent passage in the current sense began to take shape in the 1840s (as a  customary rule) with the development of world trade and the emergence of steamships navigation, for which it was economically significant to use the shortest possible route often through the coastal waters of a foreign state.
The law was codified in the 1958 Geneva Convention and affirmed in  the 1982 UNCLOS.
