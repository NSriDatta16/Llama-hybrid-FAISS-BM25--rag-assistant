All That Matters is an album by Michael Bolton, released in 1997, and was his first studio album since 1993's The One Thing. Bolton was aided in production by Babyface and Tony Rich, and among the songwriters are Bolton, Diane Warren, Babyface, Lamont Dozier, Gary Burr, and Tony Rich. Bolton’s U.S. fans were puzzled by the album’s title, "All That Matters", until the phrase was found on the bonus track, "When There Are No Words", on the UK version of the album. The two singles from the album, "The Best of Love", and "Safe Place from the Storm" were disappointing in sales and radio play, and fans were disappointed that the songs were performed only a handful of times during Bolton’s 1998 tour in support of the album.

Bolton recorded the pop version of "Go the Distance" for the soundtrack to the animated film Hercules. The song was nominated for both the Academy Award for Best Original Song and the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song, but ultimately lost both to Celine Dion's hit "My Heart Will Go On" from Titanic. "Go the Distance" peaked at #24 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and went to #1 on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart, Bolton's ninth song to top this chart. The song was also included on the All That Matters album.

Despite the lead single's relative success (#24 on the Hot 100), the album failed to achieve substantial success, partly because subsequent singles from the album failed to make any significant impact on the charts and due to the altering musical tastes (which were in favor of teen-pop at the time). Thus, the album debuted at a disappointing #39 and after some weeks of descending the chart it completely disappeared from the Billboard Top 200.
