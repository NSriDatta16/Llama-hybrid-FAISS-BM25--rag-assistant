Synopsis
Antique Bakery follows the lives of the four workers at Antique, a pâtisserie in residential Tokyo: store owner and manager Keiichirō Tachibana, pastry chef Yusuke Ono, apprentice pastry chef Eiji Kanda, and waiter Chikage Kobayakawa. Antique is so named because the pâtisserie is located in a former antique shop, and uses antique tableware and furniture in its café. The series focuses on the men as they encounter a variety of comedic and dramatic scenarios, often focused around workplace comedy, the creation and development of pastries, or romantic intrigue. Though the series largely proceeds as a slice of life story without an overarching plot, Tachibana's desire to find the man who kidnapped him as a child is a recurring storyline; the series climaxes with Tachibana working with the police to find a child kidnapper.

In North America, Digital Manga Publishing published an English-language translation of Antique Bakery as four volumes published from 2000 to 2002, making Antique Bakery Yoshinaga's first manga series to be translated into English. Volumes in the English language release feature scratch and sniff covers.

Spin-off dōjinshi series
Following the conclusion of the Antique Bakery manga series, Yoshinga began writing and illustrating , a spin-off manga published as a series of dōjinshi (self-published fan comics). In contrast to the main manga series, Antique Afterwards is more overtly influenced by the yaoi (male-male romance, also known as boys' love or BL) genre, and has sexually-explicit content. This includes both sexual encounters merely alluded to in the original series and slash fiction-inspired scenarios that depict same-sex sexual encounters involving the series' canonically heterosexual characters; for example, in one such story, three female customers tell each other improvised erotic stories involving Antique's staff. Fourteen dōjinshi in the Antique Afterwards series have been created by Yoshinga.

Live-action television drama

Reception

Critical reception
Antique Bakery is noted as Yoshinaga's first major commercial success as a manga artist, following a career in which she was best known as an author of boys' love (BL) and dōjinshi. In Manga: The Complete Guide, writer Jason Thompson gave the manga series four out of five stars, writing that it avoids "cliched sitcom plot while managing to be both character-driven and totally hilarious," and praised its pacing, artwork, and dialogue. Reviewing the series for The Comics Journal, Noah Berlatsky wrote that its "pop Freudianism is depressingly ill-advised" in regards to the tragic backstories of the primary characters, while he praised the series' art and character designs. In his review for Anime News Network, Jason Thompson commended the series' simple art, and praised it as "one of the few bishonen manga which depicts gay characters and prejudice in even a remotely realistic way."

Reviewing the anime adaptation for Anime News Network, Carl Kimlinger praised the series' animation and characters but criticized its romance and kidnapping subplots, writing that Antique Bakery "top-loads its plot with preposterous romantic entanglements and forces unnecessary structure onto it with Tachibana's kidnapping." Cathy Yan lauded the series' voice acting in her review for Manga Bookshelf, but criticized its animation as overly reliant on CGI elements.

Awards
The Antique Bakery manga series won the Kodansha Manga Award in the shōjo category in 2002, and the English-language translation was nominated for an Eisner Award for "Best U.S. Edition of International Material – Japan" in 2007. At the 31st  in 2001, the Japanese television drama adaptation won awards in the Best Series, Supporting Actor (for Kippei Shiina), Theme Song, Music, Casting, and Title Sequence categories; a special award was also given to  for the design of the pastries and baked goods used in the series. In 2002, the Japanese television drama adaptation won the Nikkan Sports Drama Grand Prix for Best Drama and Best Actor (for Hideaki Takizawa).

Analysis

Portrayal of cooking and gender
Tomoko Aoyama has considered the depiction of cooking in Antique Bakery in relation to the Japanese concepts of  and . While the elaborate cakes and pastries of Antique Bakery are self-evidently hare, she notes how Antique Bakery complicates the hare-ke dichotomy through its presentation of gender. While male professional cooking and connoisseurship are generally regarded as hare and female cooking is seen as ke, the main characters of Antique Bakery subvert "assumptions based on age, gender, sexuality, appearance, occupation, education, class, [and] status." For example, Ono is a skilled chef but is coded as female as a result of his homosexuality, while Kanda is regarded by others as cute (a feminine trait) but vulgar (a masculine trait). Desserts in general are seemingly ke for being delicate and "unmanly", but their exoticism as French pastries for a Japanese clientele, as well as the level of skill and craftsmanship required to create them, renders them as hare.

Portrayal of homosexuality
Yoshinaga has described Antique Bakery as not a work of BL, but as a shōjo manga with gay characters, stating that "being regarded as BL may limit the range of the audience, but there’s nothing I can do about it, and more importantly, I want my readers to read as they like. Surely we should be allowed to read manga with whatever dogma and prejudice we like." Critics and readers have often considered the series as a work of BL, with Xuan Bach Tran describing Antique Bakery as "not a BL manga, but a shōjo work with a lot of BL flavour." Tomoko Aoyama states that while BL elements are "clearly present" in Antique Bakery, in contrast to typical BL works the series does not depict sex or sexuality graphically, and instead "encourages readers to use their imagination" in regards to the nature of the relationships between the characters. She praises the series' effective "use and parody [of] BL conventions," particularly Antique Afterwards, which she commends as "by no means simple, formulaic pornography" but instead a series that subverts expectations of BL narratives through their use of comedy and irony.

Akiko Mizoguchi discusses Antique Afterwards in her research of yaoi dōjinshi, noting that while most dōjinshi are derivative works created by fan artists, Antique Afterwards is notable as a fan work created by the artist themselves. Mizoguchi considers the series a form of underground comics despite being created by Yoshinaga, noting that the series contains material that would be regarded as too explicit by shōjo editorial standards, and that Antique Bakery publisher Shinshokan has not acknowledged the existence of Antique Afterwards in either Wings or in the series' tankōbon editions.
