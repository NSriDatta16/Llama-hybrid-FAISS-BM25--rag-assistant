RouteViews is a project founded by the Advanced Network Technology Center at the University of Oregon to allow Internet users to view global Border Gateway Protocol routing information from the perspective of other locations around the internet. Originally created to help Internet Service Providers determine how their network prefixes were viewed by others in order to debug and optimize access to their network, RouteViews is now used for a range of other purposes including academic research.

RouteViews collectors obtain BGP data by directly peering with network operators at Internet exchange points or by multi-hop peering with network operators that aren't colocated at an exchange where RouteViews has a collector. The collectors can be queried using telnet. Historical data is stored in MRT format and can be downloaded using HTTP or FTP from archive.routeviews.org.

As of 2023, the RouteViews project has collectors at 39 exchange points and more than 1,000 peers.
