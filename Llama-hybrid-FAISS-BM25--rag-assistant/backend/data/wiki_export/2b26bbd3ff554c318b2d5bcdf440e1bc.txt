History
Fort Janesville
In 1860, after the First Battle of Pyramid Lake, part of the Paiute War, and the Ormsby Massacre, settlers built a loopholed stockade for protection from an Indian attack that never materialized. The fort, which had a bastion, or block house, in its southwest corner, was located less than a mile from the town of Janesville. The site of the fort is now a California Historic Landmark No.758.

In 1864, Janesville lost to Susanville by one vote from becoming the county seat. The Janesville post office opened in 1861, closed for a time in 1864, changed its name to Lassen in 1914, and renamed to Janesville in 1923. The name honors Jane Bankhead, wife of an early settler.
