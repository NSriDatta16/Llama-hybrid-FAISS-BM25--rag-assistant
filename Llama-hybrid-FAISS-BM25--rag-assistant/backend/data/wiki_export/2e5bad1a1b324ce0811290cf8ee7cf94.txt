Playing career 
Kennedy started his post-school career playing rugby union for three years with the Manly Marlins in the Shute Shield. His NRL career started with the Canberra Raiders in 1996 where he was named the club's Rookie of the Year.

He was first selected for New South Wales in 1999 and went on to play 13 State of Origins.

In 1999, Kennedy and Brandon Pearson were sent home from training after being involved in a drinking session. There were claims that the pair had taken drugs, and Pearson confessed to taking an illicit substance, but Kennedy claimed to have spat the tablet out. Subsequent drug tests for both returned negative.

Kennedy saw premiership victory during his five-year stint with the Newcastle Knights from 2000 and was selected to national honours while playing for the Knights. He debuted for Australia in 2000 when the Kangaroos played Fiji in the World Cup tournament.

Kennedy scored a try in Newcastle's 2001 NRL Grand Final victory. At the end of the 2001 NRL season, he went on the 2001 Kangaroo tour. In 2011, 10 years after Newcastle's grand final victory, Kennedy spoke to the media at The Once a Knight reunion lunch recalling his memories of the 2001 final. Kennedy said ‘'They came into the game under a shitload of pressure but for us, it was just a good time and a heap of fun. Parra were shitting themselves and we were having a good time".

In his final seasons 2005–06 he captained the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles. He appeared in six out of the seven Australian Test matches in 2005. Along with former club teammate and friend Andrew Johns, Kennedy finished his international career in the 2006 Anzac Test.
