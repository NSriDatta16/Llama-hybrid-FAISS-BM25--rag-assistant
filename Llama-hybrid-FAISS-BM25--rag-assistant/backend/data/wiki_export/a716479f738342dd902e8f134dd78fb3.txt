The British Motor Show is an annual car show that was initially launched in 2020 as a new format for a national motor show and the first show took place in 2021 with the first show delayed due to the pandemic. It effectively took over from the London Motor Show which last was held in Excel_London in 2019.

The event recorded 45,000 visitors in its first year returning, and proceeded to grow to almost 60,000 visitors in 2022. The British Motor Show is committed to a presence at Farnborough until at least 2025 as an annual event.
