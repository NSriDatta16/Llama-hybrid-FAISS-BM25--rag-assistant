Competition structure

The Connacht Rugby Schools Cup is a three tier competition.

Junior Cup [Junior A Cup]

The premier competition played by the strongest rugby playing schools in the region. 
Current competition format is two pools [A & B] of three teams playing each other round robin.
The Winners & Runner Up in each pool proceeding to the Semi-Finals. 

 Winner Pool A vs Runner Up Pool B
 Winner Pool B vs Runner Up Pool A

The two other tiers cater for schools who cannot consistently compete at Junior Cup level by reason of playing population or experience.

In total 30 Schools representing all five provincial counties participated in the various Connacht Rugby Junior Schools Cups in 2019.

Connacht Junior Development Cup [Junior B Cup]
Is the Second Tier Competition for schools with established Rugby programs but who due to lower playing numbers or do not have the high level of population experience to consistently compete at Junior Cup Level. 
Nine schools compete in three pools of three, leading to semi-finals and a final.

Connacht Junior Emerging Cup [Junior C Cup]
Is the Third Tier Competition for Schools who have recently introduced Rugby programs within their schools.
Nine schools compete in three pools of three, leading to semi-finals and a final.

The target is for schools to establish themselves within the lowest tier initially, and progress through to the highest tier.
