Matija Ban (; 6 December 1818 – 14 March 1903) was a Serbo-Croatian poet, dramatist, and playwright. He is known as one of the earliest proponents of the Serb-Catholic movement in Dubrovnik.

Ban was born in Petrovo Selo near Dubrovnik, then in the Kingdom of Dalmatia in the Austrian Empire, now in Croatia. Matija Ban settled in Serbia in 1844. He is commonly regarded as being the first to use the term "Yugoslav", in a poem in 1835. In 1848 he came from Serbia to Dalmatia to study the state of national sentiment there. He is known for his Romanticist popular tragedies.
