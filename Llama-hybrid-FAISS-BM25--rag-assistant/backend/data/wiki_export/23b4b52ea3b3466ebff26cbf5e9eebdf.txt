William Henry Leffingwell (June 4, 1876 â€“ December 19, 1934) was an American organizational theorist, president of W. H. Leffingwell, Inc., New Jersey, management author, and the founder of National Office Management Association.

Leffingwell was born in Oxford County, Ontario to Wendell Phillips and Mary Catherine (Edwards) Leffingwell, both Americans. He was trained as a stenographer and "applied scientific management to the office." Throughout the 1920s, Leffingwell was a key figure in the Taylor Society.

Along with F.W. Taylor, Lyndall Urwick, and others, Leffingwell was subjected to attack by Harry Braverman in Labor and Monopoly Capital: The Degradation of Work in the Twentieth Century (1974).
