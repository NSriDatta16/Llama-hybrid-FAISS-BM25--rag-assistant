In measure theory and probability, the monotone class theorem connects monotone classes and -algebras. The theorem says that the smallest monotone class containing an algebra of sets  is precisely the smallest -algebra containingÂ  It is used as a type of transfinite induction to prove many other theorems, such as Fubini's theorem.

Definition of a monotone class

A  is a family (i.e. class)  of sets that is closed under countable monotone unions and also under countable monotone intersections. Explicitly, this means  has the following properties:

 if  and  then  and
 if  and  then

Monotone class theorem for sets

Monotone class theorem for functions

Proof

The following argument originates in Rick Durrett's Probability: Theory and Examples.

Results and applications

As a corollary, if  is a ring of sets, then the smallest monotone class containing it coincides with the -ring of 

By invoking this theorem, one can use monotone classes to help verify that a certain collection of subsets is a -algebra.

The monotone class theorem for functions can be a powerful tool that allows statements about particularly simple classes of functions to be generalized to arbitrary bounded and measurable functions.
