Telshe Yeshiva (Chicago) (or Telshe Chicago or Telz Chicago) is a Yeshiva (Jewish Talmudical and Rabbinical School) in Chicago, Illinois. In 1960, Rabbi Chaim Mordechai Katz, Rosh Yeshiva of the Telshe Yeshiva in Cleveland, Ohio, established Telshe Chicago as a branch of the Telshe Yeshiva (named after the Lithuanian town of Tel≈°iai).

History

At the request of members of the Chicago Jewish Community who wanted a Lithuanian-style Yeshiva in their midst, Rabbi Chaim Mordechai Katz selected a group of exemplary students, led by Rabbis Avrohom Chaim Levin and Chaim Schmelczer, to open the Chicago branch. Rabbi Chaim Dov Keller joined them a year later.
