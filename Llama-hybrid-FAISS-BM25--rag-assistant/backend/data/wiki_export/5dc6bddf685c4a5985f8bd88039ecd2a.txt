Economy
As of 2015, internet and telephone were limited and post was the primary mode of communication.

In 2016 gold was discovered in the region, and many people from all over Chad, and some from as far away as Niger and Sudan, began flocking here. However, the Chadian army moved to prevent anyone from getting into the region.

Administration
As a part of decentralisation in February 2003, Chad was administratively split into regions, departments, municipalities and rural communities. The prefectures which were originally 14 in number were re-designated in 23 regions. The regions are administered by Governors appointed by the President. The Prefects, who originally held the responsibility of the 14 prefects, still retained the titles and were responsible for the administration of smaller departments in each region. The members of local assemblies are elected every six years, while the executive organs are elected every three years. As of 2016, there are 23 regions in Chad, which are divided based on population and administrative convenience.

Subdivisions
The region of Batha is divided into three departments: Batha Est, Batha Ouest and Fitri.
