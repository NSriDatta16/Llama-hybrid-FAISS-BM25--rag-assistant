United States

The United States does not have a centralized blood donation service.  The American Red Cross collects approximately 35% of the blood used, while the rest is collected by independent nonprofit blood centers, most of which are members of America's Blood Centers.  The US military collects blood from service members for its own use, but also draws blood from the civilian supply.
