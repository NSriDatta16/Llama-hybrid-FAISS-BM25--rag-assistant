History 
Rutalahti is named after the Rutalahti bay of Päijänne, originally held by the people of Sääksmäki as hunting grounds. As a village, Rutalahti was first mentioned in the 1540s. It was originally one of the villages of Vespuoli in Korpilahti, but was transferred to Leivonmäki in 1936. The village became a part of Joutsa with the rest of Leivonmäki in 2008.
