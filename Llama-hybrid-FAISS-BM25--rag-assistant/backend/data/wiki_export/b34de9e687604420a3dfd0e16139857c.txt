History
Unlike many of the municipalities in Goiás, Santa Cruz has its origins in the 18th century, when mule drivers in 1721 on their way to the mines of Cuiabá discovered gold in the region.  A cross was raised and the arraial (village) of Santa Cruz was founded in 1729.  Later when the territory was divided in two Santa Cruz was the center of a julgado, which was almost the size of Portugal.  In 1833 it was raised to the status of a municipality.  The first railroad arrived 28 kilometers away in 1914 and the station was called Pires do Rio, which later became the most important city of the region.

With attractive landscapes around the city, Santa Cruz has rivers and waterfalls that promise future touristic development.
