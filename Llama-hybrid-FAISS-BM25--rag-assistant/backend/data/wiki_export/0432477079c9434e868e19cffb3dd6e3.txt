The municipality of Høvaag was created in 1865 when the municipality of Vestre Moland was split into two separate municipalities: Høvåg (population: 2,069) in the south and Vestre Moland (population: 2,167) in the north. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1962, the municipality of Høvåg (population: 1,330) was merged with the neighboring municipality of Vestre Moland (population: 2,454), the ladested of Lillesand (population: 1,041), and the Gitmark farm area of Eide (population: 22). Together, these areas formed a new, larger Lillesand municipality.
