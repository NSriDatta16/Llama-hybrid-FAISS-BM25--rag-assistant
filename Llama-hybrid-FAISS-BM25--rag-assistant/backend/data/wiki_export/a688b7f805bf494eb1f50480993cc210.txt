The 10th Infantry Regiment is a regiment in the United States Army first formed in 1855. Formerly a standard line regiment that served the United States in the American Civil War and again in World War II and into the Cold War, the 10th Infantry Regiment is now a garrison regiment housing training cadre and trainees undergoing Basic Combat Training with the United States Army.

History
Since its inception, the 10th Infantry Regiment has been famous for its mobility and lethality both of which it displayed in conflicts ranging from the Civil War to WWII. The Regiment's rich battle history and success in war directly correlates with its historically high-quality leadership which all started with the inspirational first commander of the regiment, COL Edmund Brooke Alexander.

The regiment was first commissioned as the 10th Infantry on 3 March 1855 and was officially organized in April 1855 at Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania. The regiment was first commanded by Colonel Edmund B. Alexander, serving from 1855 to 1869. During his tenure, COL Alexander guided the Regiment through the Indian Wars and Civil War. He is also the man responsible for coining the regimental motto- Courage and Fidelity, which is an excerpt from his famous "Order of the Day" speech, given upon presentation of the colors to the Regiment and prior to deployment to Fort Snelling, Minnesota, the first duty station of the 10th Infantry Regiment. The Regiment's rich battle history and success in war directly correlates with its historically high-quality leadership, which all started with the inspirational first Commander of the Regiment, Colonel Alexander. 25 September 1855, Colonel Alexander, commanding the six-month-old 10th Infantry Regiment, read his order of the day to the cocky, confident group of men assembled on the parade grounds of Carlisle Barracks. He began:

The first Command Sergeant Major of the regiment was Command Sergeant Major Charles C. Monton. At some point the Regiment was transferred to Fort Snelling in the Minnesota Territory for garrison duty. From there it was sent West to Utah in 1857 for the Utah War by President James Buchanan.  Post Civil War the Regiment was reassigned to the Department of the Northwest in June 1865 taking command of its posts; Fort Snelling, Fort Ridgely, Fort Ripley, Fort Abercrombie, Fort Rice, and Fort Wadsworth.  In 1869 the regiment was consolidated with elements of the 26th Infantry Regiment after having served in the Civil War. It was assigned to the 14th Division on 5 July 1918 and stayed there until it was relieved from assignment in 1919.

The regiment was inactively stationed at Camp Sherman, Ohio from December 1921 until June 1922 when it was reassigned to Fort Knox again on active duty. In 1923 it was assigned to the 5th Infantry Division and stayed there through World War II.

After World War II, the regiment was stationed in Kentucky on inactive duty. In 1947 it was moved to South Carolina until 1951, when it was then stationed at Indiantown Gap Military Reservation, Pennsylvania. Due to Cold War escalations, it was sent to West Germany in 1953 on active duty. Four years later it was relieved from assignment and reorganized as a parent regiment under the Combat Arms Regimental System. In 1989 it was again reorganized, this time under the United States Army Regimental System, and transferred to the United States Army Training and Doctrine Command.

The regiment was divided into three separate battalions. For the most part, they served in the same theaters. However, there are some slight differences in the active service of these battalions.

Regimental colors 
The regimental colors of the 10th Infantry Regiment are sewn on a blue background representing infantry. The American Bald Eagle holds an olive branch for peace and arrows for war. There are thirteen leaves and thirteen arrows representing the original thirteen colonies. The eagle faces the olive branch as a sign that all Soldiers seek peace. The Regimental Motto and Crest are also present.

Regimental crest 
The 10th Regimental Insignia is known as the "Bug" because the combination of the "X" and saber appear to be an insect's head, tail, and legs, respectively. The Bug consists of an argent (silver) circle, representing continuity, super-imposed on a roman numeral "X". The argent circle reads Courage and Fidelity, the Regimental motto, and the roman numeral MDCCCLV (1855), the year the Regiment formed. The sword in its scabbard is a weapon of the 10th Roman Legion, and shows that the Regiment activated in peace time.

1st Battalion
The 1st battalion of this regiment was stationed at Fort Ord, California from 1961 until February 1962 when it went on active duty at Fort Carson in Colorado, where it remained until 1970. It was then relieved of its duty and reassigned to the 4th Infantry Division. Its headquarters were last transferred in 1996 to United States Army Training and Doctrine Command and activated at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri.  It is no longer active.

2nd Battalion 
Originally constituted as Company B, 10th Infantry on 3 March 1855, the Battalion first went to the New Mexico Territory in 1862. The Battalion participated in frontier duty there until enlisted in the Army of the Potomac to suppress Rebel advances during the Civil War. The Battalion participated in every major Civil War battle and won the aforementioned blue and gray campaign streamers for its efforts. Following the Civil War, 2nd Battalion participated in the Indian Wars, Spanish-American War and was active in the Philippine Insurrection. In World War II, the 2nd Battalion, 10th Infantry Regiment earned a French Croix de Guerre with Palm for the crossing of the Seine River: "A unit possessing fine qualities of skill in maneuvers and heroism. Near Fountainbleau, on 23 and 24 August 1944, it crossed the Seine under fire from mortars and artillery, and established a bridgehead on the opposite bank. In spite of furious counterattacks, it succeeded in breaking the enemy vise, thus permitting the main body of Allied troops to continue its advance in the liberation of French territory. The 2nd battalion was inactivated 1 June 1957 at Fort Ord, California, and relieved from assignment to the 5th Infantry Division. After the same duties, it was activated 23 April 1960 in the Panama Canal Zone. Finally, its headquarters were transferred 4 June 1987 to the United States Army Training and Doctrine Command and activated at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. The unit is currently commanded by LTC Benjamin L. Shumaker, with CSM Russell L. Odonnell. 2nd Battalion, 10th Infantry Lineage

Military service

Military action
The 10th Infantry regiment saw extensive service through several wars. Its first major tour of service was in the Civil War. Afterwards the regiment was used in the Indian wars, the Spanish and Philippine wars, and finally saw action in World War II.

Civil War:

The Regiment's first Civil War battle was at Val Verde, in 1861, while on duty in New Mexico. Then, because of a Rebel advance into Union territory, the Regiment traveled nearly 2000 miles to the main theater and fell under the command of the Army of the Potomac. The impressive re-deployment from the east illustrates the 10th's mobility - a trait that would distinguish the Regiment from its contemporaries for several years. The Regiment earned thirteen battle streamers during the Civil War. The regiment saw the most action in its history during the civil war and participated in several battles listed below.

 Peninsula Campaign;
 Manassas;
 Battle of Antietam;
 Battle of Fredericksburg;
 Battle of Chancellorsville;
 Battle of Gettysburg;
 Battle of the Wilderness;
 Battle of Spotsylvania;
 Battle of Cold Harbor;
 Battle of Petersburg;
 New Mexico 1862;
 Virginia 1862;
 Virginia 1863

Indian Wars:

After the Civil War, the regiment was used to combat several hostile tribes in the Indian wars.

 Comanche Wars;
 Apache Wars
Spanish–American War:

The end of the Civil War took the 10th back to frontier duty, protecting settlers and suppressing banditry in the west. The year 1898 brought the Spanish–American War. The 10th Infantry Regiment was among the first to see action in Cuba. On 1 July 1898, the 10th was chosen to lead the charge up San Juan Hill to post the Stars and Stripes on its heights.

Step off point: Tampa, FL
 Battle of Santiago de Cuba

Philippine–American War:

Following duty in Cuba, the Regiment deployed to the Philippines to help suppress the insurrection. There followed months of small engagements against the Moros in the untamed jungles. The Regiment earned a battle streamer for the Philippine Insurrection.

World War I 
During "The Great War", the 10th Infantry Regiment had the important mission of Canal Guard. This position allowed the 10th to regulate shipments to the front lines, and it provided a checkpoint for the Allies to control possible enemy shipments. In 1918, the 10th Infantry Regiment distributed its personnel to other regiments that fought on all fronts at the end of World War I.

World War II:

On 9 July 1944, the 10th landed at Les Dunes de Varreveille, France, and moved up the coast of Montebourg, relieving the 18th Infantry Regiment on 15 July. During this time, the 10th distinguished itself in open warfare and assaults on fortified positions; thus dubbing a new motto: "When the going gets tough for everyone else, it's just getting right for us!" Perhaps the most significant contribution the 10th gave to the Allied effort in World War II was repulsing the German counter-offensive after the Battle of the Bulge. The 10th Infantry saw heavy action across Western Europe during World War II including:

 Invasion of Normandy;
 Northern France;
 Rhineland;
 Battle of the Bulge;
 Central Europe
World War II Statistics for 10th Infantry Regiment

 Total battle casualties for the 10th in WWII: 7,124
 1,500 bloody miles, across 20 European rivers, and through the harsh winter of 1944, it had been a long hard journey, fraught with the hazards of bitter front line combat and the remarkable challenges of human resiliency. 
 The 10th boarded the S.S. Sea Porpoise for an 8-day voyage to NY then on to Fort Campbell, KY.

Unit honors
 The 10th Infantry Regiment earned the French Croix de Guerre with Palm from the French Government for actions surrounding the Moselle River crossing: "A unit animated to the highest degree with the spirit of sacrifice and always in the front in battle. Picked to carry out a surprise action in the course of its operations from 9 to 15 September 1944, in the region of Arnaville and Army, it succeeded in placing two battalions on the right bank of the Moselle in the middle of the night on terrain where progress was difficult due to heavy rainfall. Counterattacked at dawn by a powerful enemy, it succeeded in holding its position in spite of heavy losses due to a lack of antitank arms. After six days of uninterrupted combat, it occupied the village of Army and forced the enemy to fall back."
The 2nd Battalion, 10th Infantry Regiment earned a second French Croix de Guerre with Palm for the crossing of the Seine River:  "A unit possessing fine qualities of skill in maneuvers and heroism. Near Fountainbleau, on 23 and 24 August 1944, it crossed the Seine under fire from mortars and artillery, and established a bridgehead on the opposite bank. In spite of furious counterattacks, it succeeded in breaking the enemy vise, thus permitting the main body of Allied troops to continue its advance in the liberation of French territory."

Persons of noteworthy contribution 
Edmund Brooke Alexander (6 October 1802 – 3 January 1888) was an officer in the United States Army in the Mexican-American War through the American Civil War who rose to the rank of Brevet Brigadier General in 1865.

COL Alexander was born in Haymarket, Virginia and was an 1823 graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point. In March 1855, promoted to Colonel, Alexander was appointed as Commander of the new 10th Infantry which participated in the Utah Expedition in 1858.

COL Alexander was the very first Commander of the 10th Infantry Regiment, serving from 1855 to 1869. During his tenure, COL Alexander guided the Regiment through the Indian Wars and Civil War. He is also the man responsible for coining the regimental motto- Courage and Fidelity, which is an excerpt from his famous "Order of the day" speech, given upon presentation of the colors to the regiment and prior to deployment to Fort Snelling, Minnesota, the first duty station for the 10th Infantry Regiment.

The Regiment's rich battle history and success in war directly correlates with its historically high-quality leadership, which all started with the inspirational first Commander of the Regiment, COL Alexander.

25 September 1855, COL Alexander, commanding the six-month-old 10th Infantry Regiment, read his order of the day to the cocky, confident group of men assembled on the parade grounds of Carlisle Barracks. He began:

William Mattingly Breckinridge (1905–1996) held various leadership positions in the 10th Infantry including Regimental Executive Officer and Regimental Commander during World War II (WWII). WWII marked the last foreign conflict that the 10th Infantry Regiment served in direct support of.

Breckinridge's father was a captain in the 10th Infantry Regiment at the time of his birth. After being promoted to the rank of Major, he was assigned as Executive Officer of the 2nd Battalion and finally as its Regimental Commander.

A graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, he was a likely candidate for transfer to other jobs during WWII, with the likelihood of promotion. He feared that might happen and was open in letting it be known that he wanted to remain with his regiment. It was his regiment more than others could possess it or fully appreciate its deep significance to him. Breckinridge was assigned to the 10th Infantry Regiment at Fort Thomas, in Kentucky. He recalled that his father had 14 years with the 10th. As he said later: "...that suited me all right... after all, I had a soft spot in my heart for the 10th Infantry. I'd already spent nine years with it as a child".

The pride, selfless service, camaraderie, esprit de corps, and recognized high performance of the 10th Infantry through WWII and beyond is unequivocally linked to the servant leadership of Breckinridge. 1,500 bloody miles, across 20 European rivers, and through the harsh winter of 1944–1945, it had been a long hard journey, fraught with the hazards of bitter front line combat and the remarkable challenges of human resiliency. The 10th Infantry, under the command of MG Breckinridge, saw heavy action across Western Europe during World War II including:

 Invasion of Normandy
 Northern France
 Rhineland
 Battle of the Bulge/Ardennes-Alsace
 Central Europe
Roy Arthur Crumrine (1917-2001)

Captain Crumrine served with distinction first as an enlisted soldier in the Pacific theater, and later becoming a commissioned officer in 2nd Battalion, 10th Infantry Regiment. Captain Crumrine was Commander of F company during the Battle of Metz. For his actions during World War II he was awarded, the Combat Infantryman's Badge, two Purple Hearts, and a total of five Bronze Stars.
