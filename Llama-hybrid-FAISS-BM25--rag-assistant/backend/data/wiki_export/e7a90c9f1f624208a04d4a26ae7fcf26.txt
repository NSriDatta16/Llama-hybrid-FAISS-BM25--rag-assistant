History

Pre-Colonial 
Prior to the arrival of the Spanish, the Potosi Plateau region was inhabited by the indigenous Guachichiles, a group of  Chichimeca peoples that occupied the southen and central portions of the Mexican Plateau. A nomadic people, they generally lived in small mobile villages and were primarily hunter-gatherers, making them experts of the local herbs and vegetation in the arid region.

The Guachichiles were known as fierce warriors.

Colonial 
Some sources claim that the name "Matehuala" was derived from a warning war cry of the Guachichiles that translates to "do not come [here]!"

In the early 16th century, Spanish expeditions sought metals and mining opportunities in the Altiplano region. Captain Gabriel Ortiz de Fuenmayor and a contingent of soldiers, adventurers, and missionaries entered from Zacatecas, founding San Francisco de Matehuala in 1550. The Chichimec War erupted in 1549, lasting 40 years, causing the abandonment of Matehuala. Viceroy Luis de Velasco organized expeditions between 1551 and 1553 to end the war, using allies to settle for peace and create settlements.

The conflict continued until 1568 when frontier presidios were established. King Philip II sought peace negotiations, leading to conferences attended by indigenous leaders. In 1638, Matehuala's possession changed hands due to language barriers. By the 17th century, mineral discoveries boosted Matehuala's economy.

In 1706, the town's second founding occurred after a commission verified land ownership. In 1786, New Spain was divided into intendancies, including San Luis Potosí. In 1799, a parish was established in Matehuala, although conflicts between Spaniards and indigenous people resurfaced due to fees for newcomers. The mining boom in Real de Catorce led to economic growth in Matehuala. Finally, in 1808, Matehuala was designated a villa, marking a significant historical event.
