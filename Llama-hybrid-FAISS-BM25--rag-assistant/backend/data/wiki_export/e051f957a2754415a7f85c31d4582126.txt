Opel Performance Center (OPC) is a division of the German automobile manufacturer Opel, initially set up as a subsidiary in 1997. The main focus of OPC is the development of performance derivatives of the Opel range, such as the hot hatch Corsa OPC and Astra OPC.

The OPC name is also used in some motorsport activities such as the VLN. In the United Kingdom, where Opel vehicles are sold under the Vauxhall marque, the VXR name is used instead. Former DTM racer Volker Strycek is managing director of Opel Performance Center.

History
Opel Performance Center GmbH was established in 1997. The first OPC car was an Astra G launched in 1999.

Prior to OPC models, Opel used the Grand Sport Injection (GSi) designation in the mid 1980s and the end of the 1990s for its high performance and hot hatch derivatives. Opel has offered many GSi models, e.g. the Manta B GSi, Kadett E GSi or Astra F GSi. The last vehicle with the GSi moniker was the Corsa C GSi, which was offered in the Opel model range until 2004. After three years, Opel decided to use the GSi moniker for the Corsa D in 2007.

With the Insignia B OPC Line being discontinued in 2022, the OPC sub-brand will be replaced by GSe, which now stands for Grand Sport electric.

OPC models
The retail versions developed by OPC are sold under the Opel brand, as special versions of the standard Opel vehicles. They are typically painted in a bright shade of blue, called Arden Blue (though other colours are available too). Their competition in Europe are, e.g. the ST versions of Ford's European range and Volkswagen's GTI and R range. In the United Kingdom, Vauxhall's versions of OPC models are badged as VXR.
