Maine Guides are individuals certified to accompany travelers on a number of outdoor activities in the wilderness of the State of Maine, in the United States.

History

On March 19, 1897, The Maine legislature passed a bill requiring hunting guides to register with the state. Maine registered 1316 guides in that first year.

The first Registered Maine Guide was a woman, Cornelia Thurza Crosby, or "Fly Rod Crosby", as she was popularly known. In addition to being its first licensed guide, she promoted Maine's outdoor sports at shows in metropolitan areas, and wrote a popular column that appeared in many newspapers around the country. Her efforts helped to attract thousands of would-be outdoorsmen - and women - to the woods and streams of Maine.

The tradition of women pioneering Maine guiding continued in 1976 when Suzie Hockmeyer, the "Queen of the Kennebec", became the first female whitewater rafting guide.
