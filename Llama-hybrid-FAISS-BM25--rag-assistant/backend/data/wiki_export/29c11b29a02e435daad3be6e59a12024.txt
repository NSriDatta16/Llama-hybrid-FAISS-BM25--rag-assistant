The Puma Trophy () is an international rugby union competition between Argentina and Australia. The trophy is a bronzed statue of a puma. Argentina and Australia first played against each other in 1979 and the trophy itself was established in 2000. 

In 2012, it became a part of The Rugby Championship. The first draw between the two sides since the creation of the Puma Trophy happened in 2020 (15–15). The next meeting – two weeks later – was also a draw. Subsequently, Australia retained the Trophy for another year.
