The Complete Reprise Studio Recordings is a 1995 box set album by the American singer Frank Sinatra. The release coincided with Sinatra's 80th birthday celebration.

The original 1995 packaging had the 20 discs encased in a small, leather-bound trunk. When it was re-released in 1998, it was repackaged in a more-standard (and cheaper) cardboard format.

Features
As the title implies, the set claims to contain every song ever recorded in the studio during Sinatra's career with Reprise Records, but misses the 49-second "I'm Getting Sentimental Over You (Reprise)" included as the closing track from the 1961 album I Remember Tommy and also leaves off a remake of "Body and Soul" and "Leave It All To Me" (a song written by Paul Anka), in addition to several alternate versions of songs included in the set. The set is the largest ever released for Sinatra to-date, containing 452 tracks on twenty compact discs. The albums represented are:

Ring-a-Ding-Ding!
Swing Along With Me
I Remember Tommy

The set also contained tracks that were never released prior, as well as songs new to compact disc, including those originally recorded for the album America, I Hear You Singing.

They are generally presented in order of when they were recorded, although there are exceptions to that rule, including the concept albums September of My Years and the "Future" section of the triple album Trilogy: Past Present Future. Also, the song cycle Watertown (a story told with its songs) is presented out of order.
