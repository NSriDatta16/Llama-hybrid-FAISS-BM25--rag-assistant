History

Settlement of the territory of Nelas dates back to the settlement by Neolithic and Stone age cultures, between 5000 and 3000 BC. Many of the structures that developed in this period were stone slabs and large rocks, and included megalithic monuments such as the Orca Pramelas, in Canas de Senhorim, and Outeiro Roque, near the village Lapa do Lobo.

Roman settlements also intersected this territory, with the construction of roads (such as those still visible in Santar and Vilar Seco).

Remnants of Middle Age influences can be since on the gravestone in Pedras da Forca.

The municipality of Nelas was created on 9 December 1852, during the politico-administrative reforms following the Liberal Revolution, that rationalized the chaotic local administration, and merged the two older municipalities of Senhorim with Canas de Senhorim. By Decree, Queen Maria II of Portugal and the Queen's Minister Rodrigo da Fonseca Magalhães, created the municipality of Nelas.

The municipality advanced due to its privileged geographic situation, at the junction of several roadways connecting Viseu to the Serra da Estrela mountain range, and the railway that also crossed the mountains.
