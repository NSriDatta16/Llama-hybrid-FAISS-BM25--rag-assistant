Jacques Drouin (; 28 May 1943 – 28 August 2021) was a Canadian animator and director most known for his pinscreen animation.

Biography
Jacques Drouin was born in Mont-Joli, Quebec. He studied at the École des Beaux-Arts de Montréal for several years before leaving to study filmmaking at the UCLA in California.

He first encountered the pinscreen at an animation exhibition in 1967. By the early 1970s, he was an apprentice at the National Film Board of Canada and experimenting with this unique form of animation. His first film, Three Exercises on Alexeieff's Pinscreen, was released in 1974.

Until his death, Jacques Drouin continued making pinscreen animation films for the National Film Board of Canada, one of the only animators in the world to still use this difficult but rewarding process. Some of his short films are available on NFB DVD collections, and a few are available online. His film, A Hunting Lesson, was included in the Animation Show of Shows.
